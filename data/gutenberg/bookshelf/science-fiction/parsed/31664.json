S. Herringbone_ of the Interstellar\nExploration, Examination (and Exploitation) Service was due to start her\nreturn journey to Earth, one of her scouts disconcertingly reported the\ndiscovery of intelligent life in the Virago System.\n\n\"Thirteen planets,\" Captain Iversen snarled, wishing there were someone\non whom he could place the blame for this mischance, \"and we spend a\nfull year here exploring each one of them with all the resources of\nTerrestrial science and technology, and what happens? On the nineteenth\nmoon of the eleventh planet, intelligent life is discovered. And who has\nto discover it? Harkaway, of all people. I thought for sure all the\nmoons were cinders or I would never have sent him out to them just to\nkeep him from getting in my hair.\"\n\n\"The boy's not a bad boy, sir,\" the first officer said. \"Just a thought\nincompetent, that's all--which is to be expected if the Service will\nchoose its officers on the basis of written examinations. I'm glad to\nsee him make good.\"\n\nIversen would have been glad to see Harkaway make good, too, only such a\nconcept seemed utterly beyond the bounds of possibility. From the moment\nthe young man had first set foot on the _S. S. Herringbone_, he had\nseemed unable to make anything but bad. Even in such a conglomeration of\nfools under Captain Iverson, his idiocy was of outstanding quality.\n\nThe captain, however, had not been wholly beyond reproach in this\ninstance, as he himself knew. Pity he had made such an error about the\neleventh planet's moons. It was really such a small mistake. Moons one\nto eighteen and twenty to forty-six still appeared to be cinders. It was\nall too easy for the spectroscope to overlook Flimbot, the nineteenth.\n\nBut it would be Flimbot which had turned out to be a green and pleasant\nplanet, very similar to Earth. Or so Harkaway reported on the intercom.\n\n\"And the other forty-five aren't really moons at all,\" he began.\n\"They're--\"\n\n\"You can tell me all that when we reach Flimbot,\" Iversen interrupted,\n\"which should be in about six hours. Remember, that intercom uses a lot\nof power and we're tight on fuel.\"\n\nBut it proved to be more than six _days_ later before the ship reached\nFlimbot. This was owing to certain mechanical difficulties that arose\nwhen the crew tried to lift the mother ship from the third planet, on\nwhich it was based. For sentimental reasons, the IEE(E) always tried to\nestablish its prime base on the third planet of a system. Anyhow, when\nthe _Herringbone_ was on the point of takeoff, it was discovered that\nthe rock-eating species which was the only life on the third planet had\neaten all the projecting metal parts on the ship, including the\nrocket-exhaust tubes, the airlock handles and the chromium trim.\n\n\"I had been wondering what made the little fellows so sick,\" Smullyan,\nthe ship's doctor, said. \"They went wump, wump, wump all night long,\nuntil my heart bled for them. Ah, everywhere it goes, humanity spreads\nthe fell seeds of death and destruction--\"\n\n\"Are you a doctor or a veterinarian?\" Iversen demanded furiously. \"By\nBetelgeuse, you act as if I'd crammed those blasted tubes down their\nstinking little throats!\"\n\n\"It was you who invaded their paradise with your ship. It was you--\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" Iversen yelled. \"Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!\"\n\nSo Dr. Smullyan went off, like many a ship's physician before him, and\ngot good and drunk on the medical stores.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time they finally arrived on Flimbot, Harkaway had already gone\nnative. He appeared at the airlock wearing nothing but a brief, colorful\nloincloth of alien fabric and a wreath of flowers in his hair. He was\nfondling a large, woolly pink caterpillar.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Where is your uniform, sir!\" Captain Iversen barked, aghast. If there\nwas one thing he was intolerant of in his command, it was sloppiness.\n\n\"This is the undress uniform of the Royal Flimbotzi Navy, sir. I was\ngiven the privilege of wearing one as a great _msu'gri_--honor--to our\nrace. If I were to return to my own uniform, it might set back\ndiplomatic relations between Flimbot and Earth as much as--\"\n\n\"All right!\" the captain snapped. \"All right, all right, all right!\"\n\nHe didn't ask any questions about the Royal Flimbotzi Navy. He had\ndeduced its nature when, on nearing Flimbot, he had discovered that the\neleventh planet actually had only one moon. The other forty-five\ncelestial objects were spacecraft, quaint and primitive, it was true,\nbut spacecraft nonetheless. Probably it was their orbital formation that\nhad made him think they were moons. Oh, the crew must be in great\nspirits; they did so enjoy having a good laugh at his expense!\n\nHe looked for something with which to reproach Harkaway, and his eye\nlighted on the caterpillar. \"What's that thing you're carrying there?\"\nhe barked.\n\nRaising itself on its tail, the caterpillar barked right back at him.\n\nCaptain Iversen paled. First he had overlooked the spacecraft, and now,\nafter thirty years of faithful service to the IEE(E) in the less\ndesirable sectors of space, he had committed the ultimate error in his\nfirst contact with a new form of intelligent life!\n\n\"Sorry, sir,\" he said, forgetting that the creature--whatever its mental\nprowess--could hardly be expected to understand Terran yet. \"I am just a\nsimple spaceman and my ways are crude, but I mean no harm.\" He whirled\non Harkaway. \"I thought you said the natives were humanoid.\"\n\nThe young officer grinned. \"They are. This is just a greech. Cuddly\nlittle fellow, isn't he?\" The greech licked Harkaway's face with a\ntripartite blue tongue. \"The Flimbotzik are mad about pets. Great\nanimal-lovers. That's how I knew I could trust them right from the\nstart. Show me a life-form that loves animals, I always say, and--\"\n\n\"I'm not interested in what you always say,\" Iversen interrupted,\nknowing Harkaway's premise was fundamentally unsound, because he himself\nwas the kindliest of all men, and he hated animals. And, although he\ndidn't hate Harkaway, who was not an animal, save in the strictly\nDarwinian sense, he could not repress unsportsmanlike feelings of\nbitterness.\n\nWhy couldn't it have been one of the other officers who had discovered\nthe Flimbotzik? Why must it be Harkaway--the most inept of his scouts,\nwhose only talent seemed to be the egregious error, who always rushed\ninto a thing half-cocked, who mistook superficialities for profundities,\nHarkaway, the blundering fool, the blithering idiot--who had stumbled\ninto this greatest discovery of Iversen's career? And, of course,\nHarkaway's, too. Well, life was like that and always had been.\n\n\"Have you tested those air and soil samples yet?\" Iversen snarled into\nhis communicator, for his spacesuit was beginning to itch again as the\ngentle warmth of Flimbot activated certain small and opportunistic\nlife-forms which had emigrated from a previous system along with the\nTerrans.\n\n\"We're running them through as fast as we can, sir,\" said a harried\nvoice. \"We can offer you no more than our poor best.\"\n\n\"But why bother with all that?\" Harkaway wanted to know. \"This planet is\nabsolutely safe for human life. I can guarantee it personally.\"\n\n\"On what basis?\" Iversen asked.\n\n\"Well, I've been here two weeks and I've survived, haven't I?\"\n\n\"That,\" Iversen told him, \"does not prove that the planet can sustain\nhuman life.\"\n\nHarkaway laughed richly. \"Wonderful how you can still keep that\nmarvelous sense of humor, Skipper, after all the things that have been\ngoing wrong on the voyage. Ah, here comes the _flim'tuu_--the welcoming\ncommittee,\" he said quickly. \"They were a little shy before. Because of\nthe rockets, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't their ships have any?\"\n\n\"They don't seem to. They're really very primitive affairs, barely able\nto go from planet to planet.\"\n\n\"If they _go_,\" Iversen said, \"stands to reason _something_ must power\nthem.\"\n\n\"I really don't know what it is,\" Harkaway retorted defensively. \"After\nall, even though I've been busy as a beaver, three weeks would hardly\ngive me time to investigate every aspect of their culture.... Don't you\nthink the natives are remarkably humanoid?\" he changed the subject.\n\nThey were, indeed. Except for a somewhat greenish cast of countenance\nand distinctly purple hair, as they approached, in their brief, gay\ngarments and flower garlands, the natives resembled nothing so much as a\ngroup of idealized South Sea Islanders of the nineteenth century.\n\nGigantic butterflies whizzed about their heads. Countless small animals\nfrisked about their feet--more of the pink caterpillars; bright blue\ncreatures that were a winsome combination of monkey and koala; a kind of\nlarge, merry-eyed snake that moved by holding its tail in its mouth and\nrolling like a hoop. All had faces that reminded the captain of the work\nof the celebrated twentieth-century artist W. Disney.\n\n\"By Polaris,\" he cried in disgust, \"I might have known you'd find a\n_cute_ planet!\"\n\n\"Moon, actually,\" the first officer said, \"since it is in orbit around\nVirago XI, rather than Virago itself.\"\n\n\"Would you have _wanted_ them to be hostile?\" Harkaway asked peevishly.\n\"Honestly, some people never seem to be satisfied.\"\n\nFrom his proprietary airs, one would think Harkaway had created the\nnatives himself. \"At least, with hostile races, you know where you are,\"\nIversen said. \"I always suspect friendly life-forms. Friendliness simply\nisn't a natural instinct.\"\n\n\"Who's being anthropomorphic now!\" Harkaway chided.\n\nIversen flushed, for he had berated the young man for that particular\nfault on more than one occasion. Harkaway was too prone to interpret\nalien traits in terms of terrestrial culture. Previously, since all\nintelligent life-forms with which the _Herringbone_ had come into\ncontact had already been discovered by somebody else, that didn't matter\ntoo much. In this instance, however, any mistakes of contact or\ninterpretation mattered terribly. And Iversen couldn't see Harkaway not\nmaking a mistake; the boy simply didn't have it in him.\n\n\"You know you're superimposing our attitude on theirs,\" the junior\nofficer continued tactlessly. \"The Flimbotzik are a simple, friendly,\n_shig-livi_ people, closely resembling some of our historical\nprimitives--in a nice way, of course.\"\n\n\"None of our primitives had space travel,\" Iversen pointed out.\n\n\"Well, you couldn't really call those things spaceships,\" Harkaway said\ndeprecatingly.\n\n\"They go through space, don't they? I don't know what else you'd call\nthem.\"\n\n\"One judges the primitiveness of a race by its cultural and\ntechnological institutions,\" Harkaway said, with a lofty smile. \"And\nthese people are laughably backward. Why, they even believe in\nreincarnation--_mpoola_, they call it.\"\n\n\"How do you know all this?\" Iversen demanded. \"Don't tell me you profess\nto speak the language already?\"\n\n\"It's not a difficult language,\" Harkaway said modestly, \"and I have\nmanaged to pick up quite a comprehensive smattering. I dare-say I\nhaven't caught all the nuances--_heeka lob peeka_, as the Flimbotzik\nthemselves say--but they are a very simple people and probably they\ndon't have--\"\n\n\"Are we going to keep them waiting,\" Iversen asked, \"while we discuss\nnuances? Since you say you speak the language so well, suppose you make\nthem a pretty speech all about how the Earth government extends the--I\nsuppose it would be hand, in this instance--of friendship to Flimbot\nand--\"\n\nHarkaway blushed. \"I sort of did that already, acting as your deputy.\n_Mpoo_--status--means so much in these simple societies, you know, and\nthey seemed to expect something of the sort. However, I'll introduce you\nto the Flimflim--the king, you know--\" he pointed to an imposing\nindividual in the forefront of the crowd--\"and get over all the\namenities, shall I?\"\n\n\"It would be jolly good of you,\" Iversen said frigidly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a pity they hadn't discovered Flimbot much earlier in their\nsurvey of the Virago System, Iversen thought with regret, because it was\ntruly a pleasant spot and a week was very little time in which to\nexplore a world and study a race, even one as simple as the gentle\nFlimbotzik actually turned out to be. It seemed amazing that they should\nhave developed anything as advanced as space travel, when their only\nground conveyances were a species of wagon drawn by plookik, a species\nof animal.\n\nBut Iversen had no time for further investigation. The _Herringbone's_\nfuel supply was calculated almost to the minute and so, willy-nilly, the\nEarthmen had to leave beautiful Flimbot at the end of the week, knowing\nlittle more about the Flimbotzik than they had before they came. Only\nHarkaway, who had spent the three previous weeks on Flimbot, had any\nfurther knowledge of the Flimbotzik--and Iversen had little faith in any\ndata he might have collected.\n\n\"I don't believe Harkaway knows the language nearly as well as he\npretends to,\" Iversen told the first officer as both of them watched\nthe young lieutenant make the formal speech of farewell.\n\n\"Come now,\" the first officer protested. \"Seems to me the boy is doing\nquite well. Acquired a remarkable command of the language, considering\nhe's been here only four weeks.\"\n\n\"Remarkable, I'll grant you, but is it accurate?\"\n\n\"He seems to communicate and that is the ultimate objective of language,\nis it not?\"\n\n\"Then why did the Flimbotzik fill the tanks with wine when I distinctly\ntold him to ask for water?\"\n\nOf course the ship could synthesize water from its own waste products,\nif necessary, but there was no point in resorting to that expedient when\na plentiful supply of pure H_{2}O was available on the world.\n\n\"A very understandable error, sir. Harkaway explained it to me. It seems\nthe word for water, _m'koog_, is very similar to the word for wine,\n_mk'oog_. Harkaway himself admits his pronunciation isn't perfect and--\"\n\n\"All right,\" Iversen interrupted. \"What I'd like to know is what\nhappened to the _mk'oog_, then--\"\n\n\"The m'koog, you mean? It's in the tanks.\"\n\n\"--because, when they came to drain the wine out of the tanks to put the\nwater in, the tanks were already totally empty.\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" the first officer said frostily, \"no idea at all. If\nyou'll glance at my papers, you'll note I'm Temperance by affiliation,\nbut if you'd like to search my cabin, anyway, I--\"\n\n\"By Miaplacidus, man,\" Iversen exclaimed, \"I wasn't accusing you! Of\nthat, anyway!\"\n\nEverybody on the vessel was so confoundedly touchy. Lucky they had a\nstable commanding officer like himself, or morale would simply go to\npot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, it's all over,\" Harkaway said, joining them up at the airlock in\none lithe bound--a mean feat in that light gravity. \"And a right good\nspeech, if I do say so myself. The Flimflim says he will count the\nthlubbzik with ardent expectation until the mission from Earth arrives\nwith the promised gifts.\"\n\n\"Just what gifts did you take it upon yourself to--\" Iversen began, when\nhe was interrupted by a voice behind them crying, \"Woe, woe, woe!\"\n\nAnd, thrusting himself past the three other officers, Dr. Smullyan\naddressed the flim'puu, or farewell committee, assembled outside the\nship. \"Do not let the Earthmen return to your fair planet, O happily\nignorant Flimbotzik,\" he declaimed, \"lest wretchedness and misery be\nyour lot as a result. Tell them, 'Hence!' Tell them, 'Begone!' Tell\nthem, 'Avaunt!' For, know ye, humanity is a blight, a creeping canker--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the captain's broad palm clamping down over his\nmouth.\n\n\"Clap him in the brig, somebody, until we get clear of this place,\"\nIversen ordered wearily. \"If Harkaway could pick up the Flimbotzi\nlanguage, the odds are that some of the natives have picked up Terran.\"\n\n\"That's right, always keep belittling me,\" Harkaway said sulkily as two\nof the crewmen carried off the struggling medical officer, who left an\naromatic wake behind him that bore pungent testimonial to where a part,\nat least, of the _mk'oog_ had gone. \"No wonder it took me so long to\nfind myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you found yourself at last?\" Iversen purred. \"Splendid! Now\nthat you know where you are, supposing you do me a big favor and go lose\nyourself again while we make ready for blastoff.\"\n\n\"For shame,\" said the first officer as Harkaway stamped off. \"For\nshame!\"\n\n\"The captain's a hard man,\" observed the chief petty officer, who was\nlounging negligently against a wall, doing nothing.\n\n\"Ay, that he is,\" agreed the crewman who was assisting him. \"That he\nis--a hard man, indeed.\"\n\n\"By Caroli, be quiet, all of you!\" Iversen yelled. The very next voyage,\nhe was going to have a new crew if he had to transfer to Colonization to\ndo it! Even colonists couldn't be as obnoxious as the sons of space with\nwhich he was cursed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was only after the _Herringbone_ had left the Virago System entirely\nthat Iversen discovered Harkaway had taken the greech along.\n\n\"But you can't abscond with one of the natives' pets!\" he protested,\noverlooking, for the sake of rhetoric, the undeniable fact that Harkaway\nhad already done so and that there could be no turning back. It would\nexpend too much precious fuel and leave them stranded for life on Virago\nXI^a.\n\n\"Nonsense, sir!\" Harkaway retorted. \"Didn't the Flimflim say everything\non Flimbot was mine? _Thlu'pt shig-nliv, snusnigg bnig-nliv_ were his\nvery words. Anyhow, they have plenty more greechi. They won't miss this\nlittle one.\"\n\n\"But he may have belonged to someone,\" Iversen objected. \"An incident\nlike this could start a war.\"\n\n\"I don't see how he could have belonged to anyone. Followed me around\nmost of the time I was there. We've become great pals, haven't we,\nlittle fellow?\" He ruffled the greech's pink fur and the creature gave a\ndelighted squeal.\n\nIversen could already see that the greechik were going to be Flimbot's\nfirst lucrative export. From time immemorial, the people of Earth had\nbeen susceptible to cuddly little life-forms, which was why Earth had\nnearly been conquered by the zz^{iu} from Sirius VII, before they\ndiscovered them to be hostile and quite intelligent life-forms rather\nthan a new species of tabby.\n\n\"Couldn't bear to leave him,\" Harkaway went on as the greech draped\nitself around his shoulders and regarded Iversen with large round blue\neyes. \"The Flimflim won't mind, because I promised him an elephant.\"\n\n\"You mean the diplomatic mission will have to waste valuable cargo space\non an _elephant_!\" Iversen sputtered. \"And you should know, if anyone\ndoes, just how spacesick an elephant can get. By Pherkad, Lieutenant\nHarkaway, you had no authority to make any promises to the Flimflim!\"\n\n\"I discovered the Flimbotzik,\" Harkaway said sullenly. \"_I_ learned the\nlanguage. _I_ established rapport. Just because you happen to be the\ncommander of this expedition doesn't mean you're God, Captain Iversen!\"\n\n\"Harkaway,\" the captain barked, \"this smacks of downright mutiny! Go to\nyour cabin forthwith and memorize six verses of the Spaceman's Credo!\"\n\nThe greech lifted its head and barked back at Iversen, again. \"That's my\nbrave little watch-greech,\" Harkaway said fondly. \"As a matter of fact,\nsir,\" he told the captain, \"that was just what I was proposing to do\nmyself. Go to my cabin, I mean; I have no time to waste on inferior\nprose. I plan to spend the rest of the voyage, or such part as I can\nspare from my duties--\"\n\n\"You're relieved of them,\" Iversen said grimly.\n\n\"--working on my book. It's all about the doctrine of\n_mpoola_--reincarnation, or, if you prefer, metempsychosis. The\nFlimbotzi religion is so similar to many of the earlier terrestrial\ntheologies--Hindu, Greek, Egyptian, Southern Californian--that sometimes\none is almost tempted to stop and wonder if simplicity is not the\nessence of truth.\"\n\nIversen knew that, for the sake of discipline, he should not, once he\nhad ordered Harkaway to his cabin, stop to bandy words, but he was a\nchronic word-bandier, having inherited the trait from his stalwart\nViking ancestors. \"How can you have learned all about their religion,\ntheir doctrine of reincarnation, in just four ridiculously short weeks?\"\n\n\"It's a gift,\" Harkaway said modestly.\n\n\"Go to your cabin, sir! No, wait a moment!\" For, suddenly overcome by a\nstrange, warm, utterly repulsive emotion, Iversen pointed a quivering\nfinger at the caterpillar. \"Did you bring along the proper food for\nthat--that thing? Can't have him starving, you know,\" he added gruffly.\nAfter all, he was a humane man, he told himself; it wasn't that he found\nthe creature tugging at his heart-strings, or anything like that.\n\n\"Oh, he'll eat anything we eat, sir. As long as it's not meat. All the\nspecies on Flimbot are herbivores. I can't figure out whether the\nFlimbotzik themselves are vegetarians because they practice _mpoola_, or\npractice _mpoola_ because they're--\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear another word about _mpoola_ or about Flimbot!\"\nIversen yelled. \"Get out of here! And stay away from the library!\"\n\n\"I have already exhausted its painfully limited resources, sir.\"\nHarkaway saluted with grace and withdrew to his cabin, wearing the\ngreech like an affectionate lei about his neck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIverson heard no more about _mpoola_ from Harkaway--who, though he did\nnot remain confined to his cabin when he had pursuits to pursue in other\nparts of the ship, at least had the tact to keep out of the captain's\nway as much as possible--but the rest of his men seemed able to talk of\nnothing else. The voyage back from a star system was always longer in\nrelative terms than the voyage out, because the thrill of new worlds to\nexplore was gone; already anticipating boredom, the men were ripe for\nalmost any distraction.\n\nOn one return voyage, the whole crew had set itself to the study of\nHittite with very creditable results. On another, they had all devoted\nthemselves to the ancient art of alchemy, and, after nearly blowing up\nthe ship, had come up with an elixir which, although not the\nquintessence--as they had, in their initial enthusiasm, alleged--proved\nto be an effective cure for hiccups. Patented under the name of\nHerringbone Hiccup Shoo, it brought each one of them an income which\nwould have been enough to support them in more than modest comfort for\nthe rest of their lives.\n\nHowever, the adventurous life seemed to exert an irresistible lure upon\nthem and they all shipped upon the _Herringbone_ again--much to the\ncaptain's dismay, for he had hoped for a fresh start with a new crew\nand there seemed to be no way of getting rid of them short of reaching\nretirement age.\n\nThe men weren't quite ready to accept _mpoola_ as a practical\nreligion--Harkaway hadn't finished his book yet--but as something very\nclose to it. The concept of reincarnation had always been very appealing\nto the human mind, which would rather have envisaged itself perpetuated\nin the body of a cockroach than vanishing completely into nothingness.\n\n\"It's all so logical, sir,\" the first officer told Iversen. \"The\nindividuality or the soul or the psyche--however you want to look at\nit--starts the essentially simple cycle of life as a greech--\"\n\n\"Why as a greech?\" Iversen asked, humoring him for the moment. \"There\nare lower life-forms on Flimbot.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" The first officer sounded almost testy. \"That's where\nHarkaway starts the progression.\"\n\n\"Harkaway! Is there no escaping that cretin's name?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the first officer, \"may I speak frankly?\"\n\n\"No,\" Iversen said, \"you may not.\"\n\n\"Your skepticism arises less from disbelief than from the fact that you\nare jealous of Harkaway because it was he who made the great discovery,\nnot you.\"\n\n\"Which great discovery?\" Iversen asked, sneering to conceal his hurt at\nbeing so overwhelmingly misunderstood. \"Flimbot or _mpoola_?\"\n\n\"Both,\" the first officer said. \"You refuse to accept the fact that this\nhitherto incompetent youth has at last blossomed forth in the lambent\ncolors of genius, just as the worthy greech becomes a zkoort, and the\nclean-living zkoort in his turn passes on to the next higher plane of\nexistence, which is, in the Flimbotzik scale--\"\n\n\"Spare me the theology, please,\" Iversen begged. \"Once a greech, always\na greech, I say. And I can't help thinking that somehow, somewhere,\nHarkaway has committed some horrible error.\"\n\n\"Humanity is frail, fumbling, futile,\" Dr. Smullyan declared, coming\nupon them so suddenly that both officers jumped. \"To err is human, to\nforgive divine, and I am an atheist, thank God!\"\n\n\"That _mk'oog_ is powerful stuff,\" the first officer said. \"Or so they\ntell me,\" he added.\n\n\"This is more than mere _mk'oog_,\" Iversen said sourly. \"Smullyan has\nbeen too long in space. It hits everyone in the long run--some sooner\nthan others.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" the doctor said, ignoring these remarks as he ignored\neverything not on a cosmic level, which included the crew's ailments,\n\"I am in full agreement with you. Young Harkaway has doomed that pretty\nlittle planet--\"\n\n\"Moon,\" the first officer corrected. \"It's a satellite, not a--\"\n\n\"We ourselves were doomed _ab origine_, but the tragic flaw inherent in\neach one of our pitiful species is contagious, dooming all with whom we\ncome in contact. And Harkaway is the most infectious carrier on the\nship. Woe, I tell you. Woe!\" And, with a hollow moan, the doctor left\nthem to meditate upon the state of their souls, while he went off to his\nsecret stores of oblivion.\n\n\"Wonder where he's hidden that _mk'oog_,\" Iversen brooded. \"I've turned\nthe ship inside out and I haven't been able to locate it.\"\n\nThe first officer shivered. \"Somehow, although I know Smullyan's part\ndrunk, part mad, he makes me a little nervous. He's been right so often\non all the other voyages.\"\n\n\"Ruchbah!\" Iversen said, not particularly grateful for support from such\na dithyrambic source as the ship's medical officer. \"Anyone who\nprophesies doom has a hundred per cent chance of ultimately being right,\nif only because of entropy.\"\n\nHe was still brooding over the first officer's thrust, even though he\nhad been well aware that most of his officers and men considered him a\nsorehead for doubting Harkaway in the young man's moment of triumph.\nHowever, Iversen could not believe that Harkaway had undergone such a\nradical transformation. Even on the basis of _mpoola_, one obviously had\nto die before passing on to the next existence and Harkaway had been\ncontinuously alive--from the neck down, at least.\n\nFurthermore, all that aside, Iversen just couldn't see Harkaway going on\nto a higher plane. Although he supposed the young man was well-meaning\nenough--he'd grant him that negligible virtue--wouldn't it be terrible\nto have a system of existence in which one was advanced on the basis of\nintent rather than result? The higher life-forms would degenerate into\nprimitivism.\n\nBut weren't the Flimbotzik virtually primitive? Or so Harkaway had said,\nfor Iversen himself had not had enough contact with them to determine\ntheir degree of sophistication, and only the spaceships gave Harkaway's\nclaim the lie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIversen condescended to take a look at the opening chapter of Harkaway's\nbook, just to see what the whole thing was about. The book began:\n\n\"What is the difference between life and death? Can we say definitely\nand definitively that life is life and death is death? Are we sure that\ndeath is not life and life is not death?\n\n\"No, we are not sure!\n\n\"Must the individuality have a corporeal essence in which to enshroud\nitself before it can proceed in its rapt, inexorable progress toward the\nUltimate Non-actuality? And even if such be needful, why must the\npersonal essence be trammeled by the same old worn-out habiliments of\nerror?\n\n\"Think upon this!\n\n\"What is the extremest intensification of individuality? It is the\nAll-encompassing Nothingness. Of what value are the fur, the feathers,\nthe skin, the temporal trappings of imperfection in our perpetual\nstruggle toward the final undefinable resolution into the Infinite\nInterplay of Cosmic Forces?\n\n\"Less than nothing!\"\n\nAt this point, Iversen stopped reading and returned the manuscript to\nits creator, without a word. This last was less out of self-restraint\nthan through sheer semantic inadequacy.\n\nThe young man might have spent his time more profitably in a little\nresearch on the biology or social organization of the Flimbotzik,\nIversen thought bitterly when he had calmed down, thus saving the next\nexpedition some work. But, instead, he'd been blinded by the flashy\ntheological aspects of the culture and, as a result, the whole crew had\ngone metempsychotic.\n\nThis was going to be one of the _Herringbone's_ more unendurable\nvoyages, Iversen knew. And he couldn't put his foot down effectively,\neither, because the crew, all being gentlemen of independent means now,\nwere outrageously independent.\n\nHowever, in spite of knowing that all of them fully deserved what they\ngot, Iversen couldn't help feeling guilty as he ate steak while the\nother officers consumed fish, vegetables and eggs in an aura of\nunbearable virtue.\n\n\"But if the soul transmigrates and not the body,\" he argued, \"what harm\nis there in consuming the vacated receptacle?\"\n\n\"For all you know,\" the first officer said, averting his eyes from\nIversen's plate with a little--wholly gratuitous, to the captain's\nmind--shudder, \"that cow might have housed the psyche of your\ngrandmother.\"\n\n\"Well, then, by indirectly participating in that animal's slaughter, I\nhave released my grandmother from her physical bondage to advance to the\nnext plane. That is, if she was a good cow.\"\n\n\"You just don't understand,\" Harkaway said. \"Not that you could be\nexpected to.\"\n\n\"He's a clod,\" the radio operator agreed. \"Forgive me, sir,\" he\napologized as Iversen turned to glare incredulously at him, \"but,\naccording to _mpoola_, candor is a Step Upward.\"\n\n\"Onward and Upward,\" Harkaway commented, and Iversen was almost sure\nthat, had he not been there, the men would have bowed their heads in\ncontemplation, if not actual prayer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs time went on, the greech thrived and grew remarkably stout on the\nEarth viands, which it consumed in almost improbable quantities. Then,\none day, it disappeared and its happy squeal was heard no longer.\n\nThere was much mourning aboard the _Herringbone_--for, with its lovable\npersonality and innocently engaging ways, the little fellow had won its\nway into the hearts of all the spacemen--until the first officer\ndiscovered a substantial pink cocoon resting on the ship's control board\nand rushed to the intercom to spread the glad tidings. That was a breach\nof regulations, of course, but Iversen knew when not to crowd his\nfragile authority.\n\n\"I should have known there was some material basis for the spiritual\ndoctrine of _mpoola_,\" Harkaway declared with tears in his eyes as he\nregarded the dormant form of his little pet. \"Was it not the\ntransformation of the caterpillar into the butterfly that first showed\nus on Earth how the soul might emerge winged and beautiful from its vile\nhouse of clay? Gentlemen,\" he said, in a voice choked with emotion, \"our\nlittle greech is about to become a zkoort. Praised be the Impersonal\nBeing who has allowed such a miracle to take place before our very eyes.\n_J'goona lo mpoona_.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" said the first officer reverently.\n\nAll those in the control room bowed their heads except Iversen. And even\nhe didn't quite have the nerve to tell them that the cocoon was pushing\nthe _Herringbone_ two points off course.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Take that thing away before I lose my temper and clobber it,\" Iversen\nsaid impatiently as the zkoort dived low to buzz him, then whizzed just\nout of its reach on its huge, brilliant wings, giggling raucously.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"He was just having his bit of fun,\" the first officer said with\nreproach. \"Have you no tolerance, Captain, no appreciation of the joys\nof golden youth?\"\n\n\"A spaceship is no place for a butterfly,\" Iversen said, \"especially a\nfour-foot butterfly.\"\n\n\"How can you say that?\" Harkaway retorted. \"The _Herringbone_ is the\nonly spaceship that ever had one, to my knowledge. And I think I can\nsafely say our lives are all a bit brighter and better and _m'poo'p_\nfor having a zkoort among us. Thanks be to the Divine Nonentity for--\"\n\n\"Poor little butterfly,\" Dr. Smullyan declared sonorously, \"living out\nhis brief life span so far from the fresh air, the sunshine, the pretty\nflowers--\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know that it's as bad as all that,\" the first officer said.\n\"He hangs around hydroponics a lot and he gets a daily ration of\nvitamins.\" Then he paled. \"But that's right--a butterfly does live only\na day, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It's different with a zkoort,\" Harkaway maintained stoutly, though he\nalso, Iversen noted, lost his ruddy color. \"After all, he isn't really a\nbutterfly, merely an analogous life-form.\"\n\n\"My, my! In four weeks, you've mastered their entomology as well as\ntheir theology and language,\" Iversen jeered. \"Is there no end to your\naccomplishments, Lieutenant?\"\n\nHarkaway's color came back twofold. \"He's already been around half a\n_thubb_,\" he pointed out. \"Over two weeks.\"\n\n\"Well, the thing _is_ bigger than a Terrestrial butterfly,\" Iversen\nconceded, \"so you have to make some allowances for size. On the other\nhand--\"\n\nLaughing madly, the zkoort swooped down on him. Iversen beat it away\nwith a snarl.\n\n\"Playful little fellow, isn't he?\" the first officer said, with\nthoroughly annoying fondness.\n\n\"He likes you, Skipper,\" Harkaway explained. \"_Urg'h n gurg'h_--or, to\ngive it the crude Terran equivalent, living is loving. He can tell that\nbeneath that grizzled and seemingly harsh exterior of yours, Captain--\"\n\nBut, with a scream of rage, Iversen had locked himself into his cabin.\nOutside, he could hear the zkoort beating its wings against the door and\nwailing disappointedly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome days later, a pair of rapidly dulling wings were found on the floor\nof the hydroponics chamber. But of the zkoort's little body, there was\nno sign. An air of gloom and despondency hung over the _Herringbone_ and\neven Iversen felt a pang, though he would never admit it without\nbrainwashing.\n\nDuring the next week, the men, seeking to forget their loss, plunged\nthemselves into _mpoola_ with real fanaticism. Harkaway took to wearing\nsome sort of ecclesiastical robes which he whipped up out of the\nrecreation room curtains. Iversen had neither the heart nor the courage\nto stop him, though this, too, was against regulations. Everyone except\nIversen gave up eating fish and eggs in addition to meat.\n\nThen, suddenly, one day a roly-poly blue animal appeared at the officers\nmess, claiming everyone as an old friend with loud squeals of joy. This\ntime, Iversen was the only one who was glad to see him--really glad.\n\n\"Aren't you happy to see your little friend again, Harkaway?\" he asked,\nscratching the delighted animal between the ears.\n\n\"Why, sure,\" Harkaway said, putting his fork down and leaving his\nvegetable _mac\u00e9doine_ virtually untasted. \"Sure. I'm very happy--\" his\nvoice broke--\"very happy.\"\n\n\"Of course, it does kind of knock your theory of the transmigration of\nsouls into a cocked hat,\" the captain grinned. \"Because, in order for\nthe soul to transmigrate, the previous body's got to be dead, and I'm\nafraid our little pal here was alive all the time.\"\n\n\"Looks it, doesn't it?\" muttered Harkaway.\n\n\"I rather think,\" Iversen went on, tickling the creature under the chin\nuntil it squealed happily, \"that you didn't _quite_ get the nuances of\nthe language, did you, Harkaway? Because I gather now that the whole\ndifficulty was a semantic one. The Flimbotzik were explaining the\nzoology of the native life-forms to you and you misunderstood it as\ntheir theology.\"\n\n\"Looks it, doesn't it?\" Harkaway repeated glumly. \"It certainly looks\nit.\"\n\n\"Cheer up,\" Iversen said, reaching over to slap the young man on the\nback--a bit to his own amazement. \"No real harm done. What if the\nFlimbotzik are less primitive than you fancied? It makes our discovery\nthe more worthwhile, doesn't it?\"\n\nAt this point, the radio operator almost sobbingly asked to be excused\nfrom the table. Following his departure, there was a long silence. It\nwas hard, Iversen realized in a burst of uncharacteristic tolerance, to\nhave one's belief, even so newly born a credo, annihilated with such\nsuddenness.\n\n\"After all, you did run across the Flimbotzik first,\" he told Harkaway\nas he spread gooseberry jam on a hard roll for the ravenous ex-zkoort\n(now a chu-wugg, he had been told). \"That's the main thing, and a\nlife-form that passes through two such striking metamorphoses is not\nunfraught with interest. You shall receive full credit, my boy, and your\nlittle mistake doesn't mean a thing except--\"\n\n\"Doom,\" said Dr. Smullyan, sopping up the last of his gravy with a piece\nof bread. \"Doom, doom, doom.\" He stuffed the bread into his mouth.\n\n\"Look, Smullyan,\" Iversen told him jovially, \"you better watch out. If\nyou keep talking that way, next voyage out we'll sign on a parrot\ninstead of a medical officer. Cheaper and just as efficient.\"\n\nOnly the chu-wugg joined in his laughter.\n\n\"Ever since I can remember,\" the first officer said, looking gloomily at\nthe doctor, \"he's never been wrong. Maybe _he_ has powers beyond our\ncomprehension. Perhaps we sought at the end of the Galaxy what was in\nour own back yard all the time.\"\n\n\"Who was seeking what?\" Iversen asked as all the officers looked at\nSmullyan with respectful awe. \"I demand an answer!\"\n\nBut the only one who spoke was the doctor. \"Only Man is vile,\" he said,\nas if to himself, and fell asleep with his head on the table.\n\n\"Make a cult out of Smullyan,\" Iversen warned the others, \"and I'll\nscuttle the ship!\"\n\nLater on, the first officer got the captain alone. \"Look here, sir,\" he\nbegan tensely, \"have you read Harkaway's book about _mpoola_?\"\n\n\"I read part of the first chapter,\" Iversen told him, \"and that was\nenough. Maybe to Harkaway it's eschatology, but to me it's just plain\nscatology!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Why in Zubeneschamali,\" Iversen said patiently, \"should I waste my time\nreading a book devoted to a theory which has already been proved\nerroneous? Answer me that!\"\n\n\"I think you should have a look at the whole thing,\" the first officer\npersisted.\n\n\"Baham!\" Iversen replied, but amiably enough, for he was in rare good\nhumor these days. And he needed good humor to tolerate the way his\nofficers and men were behaving. All right, they had made idiots of\nthemselves; that was understandable, expected, familiar. But it wasn't\nthe chu-wugg's fault. Iversen had never seen such a bunch of soreheads.\nWhy did they have to take their embarrassment and humiliation out on an\ninnocent little animal?\n\nFor, although no one actually mistreated the chu-wugg, the men avoided\nhim as much as possible. Often Iversen would come upon the little fellow\nweeping from loneliness in a corner with no one to play with and, giving\nin to his own human weakness, the captain would dry the creature's\ntears and comfort him. In return, the chu-wugg would laugh at all his\njokes, for he seemed to have acquired an elementary knowledge of Terran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"By Vindemiatrix, Lieutenant,\" the captain roared as Harkaway, foiled in\nhis attempt to scurry off unobserved, stood quivering before him, \"why\nhave you been avoiding me like this?\"\n\n\"I didn't think I was avoiding you any particular way, sir,\" Harkaway\nsaid. \"I mean does it appear like that, sir? It's only that I've been\nbusy with my duties, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's the matter with you! I told you I handsomely\nforgave you for your mistake.\"\n\n\"But I can never forgive myself, sir--\"\n\n\"Are you trying to go over my head?\" Iversen thundered.\n\n\"No, sir. I--\"\n\n\"If I am willing to forgive you, you will forgive yourself. That's an\norder!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the young man said feebly.\n\nHarkaway had changed back to his uniform, Iversen noted, but he looked\nunkempt, ill, harrowed. The boy had really been suffering for his\nprecipitance. Perhaps the captain himself had been a little hard on him.\n\nIversen modulated his tone to active friendliness. \"Thought you might\nlike to know the chu-wugg turned into a hoop-snake this morning!\"\n\nBut Harkaway did not seem cheered by this social note. \"So soon!\"\n\n\"You knew there would be a fourth metamorphosis!\" Iversen was\ndisappointed. But he realized that Harkaway was bound to have acquired\nsuch fundamental data, no matter how he interpreted them. It was\npossible, Iversen thought, that the book could actually have some value,\nif there were some way of weeding fact from fancy, and surely there must\nbe scholars trained in such an art, for Earth had many wholly indigenous\ntexts of like nature.\n\n\"He's a thor'glitch now,\" Harkaway told him dully.\n\n\"And what comes next?... No, don't tell me. It's more fun not knowing\nbeforehand. You know,\" Iversen went on, almost rubbing his hands\ntogether, \"I think this species is going to excite more interest on\nEarth than the Flimbotzik themselves. After all, people are people, even\nif they're green, but an animal that changes shape so many times and so\nradically is really going to set biologists by the ears. What did you\nsay the name of the species as a whole was?\"\n\n\"I--I couldn't say, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Iversen remarked waggishly, \"so there are one or two things you\ndon't know about Flimbot, eh?\"\n\nHarkaway opened his mouth, but only a faint bleating sound came out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the days went on, Iversen found himself growing fonder and fonder of\nthe thor'glitch. Finally, in spite of the fact that it had now attained\nthe dimensions of a well-developed boa constrictor, he took it to live\nin his quarters.\n\nMany was the quiet evening they spent together, Iversen entering acid\ncomments upon the crew in the ship's log, while the thor'glitch looked\nover viewtapes from the ship's library.\n\nThe captain was surprised to find how much he--well, enjoyed this\ndomestic tranquility. I must be growing old, he thought--old and mellow.\nAnd he named the creature Bridey, after a twentieth-century figure who\nhad, he believed, been connected with another metempsychotic furor.\n\nWhen the thor'glitch grew listless and began to swell in the middle,\nIversen got alarmed and sent for Dr. Smullyan.\n\n\"Aha!\" the medical officer declaimed, with a casual glance at the\nsuffering snake. \"The day of reckoning is at hand! Reap the fruit of\nyour transgression, scurvy humans! Calamity approaches with jets\naflame!\"\n\nIversen clutched the doctor's sleeve. \"Is he--is he going to die?\"\n\n\"Unhand me, presumptuous navigator!\" Dr. Smullyan shook the captain's\nfingers off his arm. \"I didn't say he was going to die,\" he offered in\nordinary bedside tones. \"Not being a specialist in this particular\nsector, I am not qualified to offer an opinion, but, strictly off the\nrecord, I would hazard the guess that he's about to metamorphose again.\"\n\n\"He never did it in public before,\" Iversen said worriedly.\n\n\"The old order changeth,\" Smullyan told him. \"You'd better call\nHarkaway.\"\n\n\"What does _he_ know!\"\n\n\"Too little and, at the same time, too much,\" the doctor declaimed,\ndissociating himself professionally from the case. \"Too much and too\nlittle. Eat, drink, be merry, iniquitous Earthmen, for you died\nyesterday!\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Iversen said automatically, and dispatched a message to\nHarkaway with the information that the thor'glitch appeared to be\nmetamorphosing again and that his presence was requested in the\ncaptain's cabin.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe rest of the officers accompanied Harkaway, all of them with the air\nof attending a funeral rather than a rebirth, Iversen noted nervously.\nThey weren't armed, though, so Bridey couldn't be turning into anything\ndangerous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow it came to pass that the thor'glitch's mid-section, having swelled\nto unbearable proportions, began to quiver. Suddenly, the skin split\nlengthwise and dropped cleanly to either side, like a banana peel.\n\nIversen pressed forward to see what fresh life-form the bulging cavity\nhad held. The other officers all stood in a somber row without moving,\nfor all along, Iversen realized, they had known what to expect, what was\nto come. And they had not told him. But then, he knew, it was his own\nfault; he had refused to be told.\n\nNow, looking down at the new life-form, he saw for himself what it was.\nLying languidly in the thor'glitch skin was a slender youth of a pallor\nwhich seemed excessive even for a member of a green-skinned race. He had\nlarge limpid eyes and a smile of ineffable sweetness.\n\n\"By Nopus Secundus,\" Iversen groaned. \"I'm sunk.\"\n\n\"Naturally the ultimate incarnation for a life-form would be humanoid,\"\nHarkaway said with deep reproach. \"What else?\"\n\n\"I'm surprised you didn't figure that out for yourself, sir,\" the first\nofficer added. \"Even if you did refuse to read Harkaway's book, it seems\nobvious.\"\n\n\"Does it?\" Smullyan challenged. \"Does it, indeed? Is Man the highest\nform of life in an irrational cosmos? Then all causes are lost ones!...\nSo many worlds,\" he muttered in more subdued tones, \"so much to do, so\nlittle done, such things to be!\"\n\n\"The Flimbotzik were telling Harkaway about their _own_ life cycle,\"\nIversen whispered as revelation bathed him in its murky light. \"The\nhuman embryo undergoes a series of changes _inside_ the womb. It's just\nthat the Flimbotzik fetus develops _outside_ the womb.\"\n\n\"Handily bypassing the earliest and most unpleasant stages of humanity,\"\nSmullyan sighed. \"Oh, idyllic planet, where one need never be a\nchild--where one need never see a child!\"\n\n\"Then they were trying to explain their biology to you quite clearly and\ncoherently, you lunkhead,\" Iversen roared at Harkaway, \"and you took it\nfor a religious doctrine!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Harkaway said weakly. \"I--I kind of figured that out myself\nin these last few weeks of intensive soul-searching. I--I'm sorry, sir.\nAll I can say is that it was an honest mistake.\"\n\n\"Why, they weren't necessarily pet-lovers at all. Those animals they had\nwith them were.... By Nair al Zaurak!\" The captain's voice rose to a\nshriek as the whole enormity of the situation finally dawned upon him.\n\"You went and kidnaped one of the children!\"\n\n\"That's a serious charge, kidnaping,\" the first officer said with\nmelancholy pleasure. \"And you, as head of this expedition, Captain, are\nresponsible. Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Told you all this spelled doom and disaster,\" the doctor observed\ncheerfully.\n\nJust then, the young humanoid sat up--with considerable effort, Iversen\nwas disturbed to notice. But perhaps that was one of the consequences of\nbeing born. A new-born infant was weak; why not a new-born adult, then?\n\n\"Why doom?\" the humanoid asked in a high, clear voice. \"Why disaster?\"\n\n\"You--you speak Terran?\" the captain stammered.\n\nBridey gave his sad, sweet smile. \"I was reared amongst you. You are my\npeople. Why should I not speak your tongue?\"\n\n\"But we're not your people,\" Iversen blurted, thinking perhaps the youth\ndid not remember back to his greechi days. \"We're an entirely different\nspecies--\"\n\n\"Our souls vibrate in unison and that is the vital essence. But do not\nbe afraid, shipmates; the Flimbotzik do not regard the abduction of a\ntransitory corporeal shelter as a matter of any great moment. Moreover,\nwhat took place could not rightly be termed abduction, for I came with\nyou of my own volition--and the Flimbotzik recognize individual\nresponsibility from the very first moment of the psyche's drawing breath\nin any material casing.\"\n\nBridey talked so much like Harkaway's book that Iversen was almost\nrelieved when, a few hours later, the alien died. Of course the captain\nwas worried about possible repercussions from the governments of both\nTerra and Flimbot, in spite of Bridey's assurances.\n\nAnd he could not help but feel a pang when the young humanoid expired in\nhis arms, murmuring, \"Do not grieve for me, soul-mates. In the midst of\nlife, there is life....\"\n\n\"Funny,\" Smullyan said, with one of his disconcerting returns to a\nprofessional manner, \"all the other forms seemed perfectly healthy. Why\ndid this one go like that? Almost as if he _wanted_ to die.\"\n\n\"He was too good for this ship, that's what,\" the radio operator said,\nglaring at the captain. \"Too fine and brave and--and noble.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Harkaway agreed. \"What truly sensitive soul could exist in a\nstultifying atmosphere like this?\"\n\nAll the officers glared at the captain. He glared back with right good\nwill. \"How come you gentlemen are still with us?\" he inquired. \"One\nwould have thought you would have perished of pure sensibility long\nsince, then.\"\n\n\"It's not nice to talk that way,\" the chief petty officer burst out,\n\"not with him lying there not yet cold.... Ah,\" he heaved a long sigh,\n\"we'll never see his like again.\"\n\n\"Ay, that we won't,\" agreed the crew, huddled in the corridor outside\nthe captain's cabin.\n\nIversen sincerely hoped not, but he forbore to speak.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSince Bridey had reached the ultimate point in his life cycle, it seemed\ncertain that he was not going to change into anything else and so he was\ngiven a spaceman's burial. Feeling like a put-upon fool, Captain Iversen\nread a short prayer as Bridey's slight body was consigned to the vast\nemptiness of space.\n\nThen the airlock clanged shut behind the last mortal remains of the\nill-fated extraterrestrial and that was the end of it.\n\nBut the funereal atmosphere did not diminish as the ship forged on\ntoward Earth. Gloomy days passed, one after the other, during which no\none spoke, save to issue or dispute an order. Looking at himself one day\nin the mirror on his cabin wall, the captain realized that he was\ngetting old. Perhaps he ought to retire instead of still dreaming of a\nnew command and a new crew.\n\nAnd then one day, as he sat in his cabin reading the Spaceman's Credo,\nthe lights on the _Herringbone_ went out, all at once, while the\nconstant hum of the motors died down slowly, leaving a strange,\nuncomfortable silence. Iversen found himself suspended weightless in the\ndark, for the gravity, of course, had gone off with the power. What, he\nwondered, had come to pass? He often found himself thinking in such\nterms these days.\n\nHoarse cries issued from the passageway outside; then he heard a squeak\nas his cabin door opened and persons unknown floated inside, breathing\nheavily.\n\n\"The power has failed, sir!\" gasped the first officer's voice.\n\n\"That has not escaped my notice,\" Iversen said icily. Were not even his\nlast moments to be free from persecution?\n\n\"It's all that maniac Smullyan's fault. He stored his _mk'oog_ in the\nfuel tanks. After emptying them out first, that is. We're out of fuel.\"\n\nThe captain put a finger in his book to mark his place, which was, he\nknew with a kind of supernal detachment, rather foolish, because there\nwas no prospect of there ever being lights to read by again.\n\n\"Put him in irons, if you can find him,\" he ordered. \"And tell the men\nto prepare themselves gracefully for a lingering death.\"\n\nIversen could hear a faint creak as the first officer drew himself to\nattention in the darkness. \"The men of the _Herringbone_, sir,\" he said,\nstiffly, \"are always prepared for calamity.\"\n\n\"Ay, that we are,\" agreed various voices.\n\nSo they were all there, were they? Well, it was too much to expect that\nthey would leave him in death any more than they had in life.\n\n\"It is well,\" Iversen said. \"It is well,\" he repeated, unable to think\nof anything more fitting.\n\nSuddenly the lights went on again and the ship gave a leap. From his\nsprawling position on the floor, amid his recumbent officers, Iversen\ncould hear the hum of motors galvanized into life.\n\n\"But if the fuel tanks are empty,\" he asked of no one in particular,\n\"where did the power come from?\"\n\n\"I am the power,\" said a vast, deep voice that filled the ship from hold\nto hold.\n\n\"And the glory,\" said the radio operator reverently. \"Don't forget the\nglory.\"\n\n\"No,\" the voice replied and it was the voice of Bridey, resonant with\nall the amplitude of the immense chest cavity he had acquired. \"Not the\nglory, merely the power. I have reached a higher plane of existence. I\nam a spaceship.\"\n\n\"Praise be to the Ultimate Nothingness!\" Harkaway cried.\n\n\"Ultimate Nothingness, nothing!\" Bridey said impatiently. \"I achieved it\nall myself.\"\n\n\"Then that's how the Flimbotzi spaceships were powered!\" Iversen\nexclaimed. \"By themselves--the Flimbotzik themselves, I mean--\"\n\n\"Even so,\" Bridey replied grandly. \"And this lofty form of life happens\nto be one which we poor humans cannot reach unassisted. Someone has to\nbuild the shell for us to occupy, which is the reason humans dwell\ntogether in fellowship and harmony--\"\n\n\"You purposely got Harkaway to take you aboard the _Herringbone_,\"\nIversen interrupted wrathfully. \"You--you stowaway!\"\n\nBridey's laugh rang through the ship, setting the loose parts quivering.\n\"Of course. When first I set eyes upon this vessel of yours, I saw\nbefore me the epitome of all dreams. Never had any of our kind so\nsplendid an encasement. And, upon determining that the vessel was, as\nyet, a soulless thing, I got myself aboard; I was born, I died, and was\nreborn again with the greatest swiftness consonant with comfort, so that\nI could awaken in this magnificent form. Oh, joy, joy, joy!\"\n\n\"You know,\" Iversen said, \"now that I hear one of you talk at length, I\nreally can't blame Harkaway for his typically imbecilic mistake.\"\n\n\"We are a wordy species,\" Bridey conceded.\n\n\"You had no right to do what you did,\" Iversen told him, \"no right to\ntake over--\"\n\n\"But I didn't take over,\" Bridey the _Herringbone_ said complacently. \"I\nmerely remained quiescent and content in the knowledge of my power until\nyours failed. Without me, you would even now be spinning in the vasty\nvoids, a chrome-trimmed sepulcher. Now, three times as swiftly as\nbefore, shall I bear you back to the planet you very naively call home.\"\n\n\"Not three times as fast, please!\" Iversen was quick to plead. \"The ship\nisn't built--_we're_ not built to stand such speeds.\"\n\nThe ship sighed. \"Disappointment needs must come to all--the high, the\nlow, the man, the spaceship. It must be borne--\" the voice\nbroke--\"bravely. Somehow.\"\n\n\"What am I going to do?\" Iversen asked, turning to the first officer for\nadvice for the first time ever. \"I was planning to ask for a transfer or\nresign my command when we got back to Earth. But how can I leave Bridey\nin the hands of the IEE(E)?\"\n\n\"You can't, sir,\" the first officer said. \"Neither can we.\"\n\n\"If you explain,\" Harkaway offered timidly, \"perhaps they'll present the\nship to the government.\"\n\nBoth Iversen and the first officer snorted, united for once. \"Not the\nIEE(E),\" Iversen said. \"They'd--they'd exhibit it or something and\ncharge admission.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Bridey cried, \"I don't want to be exhibited! I want to sail\nthrough the trackless paths of space. What good is a body like this if I\ncannot use it to its fullest?\"\n\n\"Have no fear,\" Iversen assured it. \"We'll just--\" he shrugged, his\ndreams of escape forever blighted--\"just have to buy the ship from the\nIEE(E), that's all.\"\n\n\"Right you are, sir,\" the first officer agreed. \"We must club together,\nevery man Jack of us, and buy her. Him. It. That's the only decent thing\nto do.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they won't sell,\" Harkaway worried. \"Maybe--\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll sell, all right,\" Iversen said wearily. \"They'd sell the\nchairman of the board, if you made them an offer, and throw in all the\ndirectors if the price was right.\"\n\n\"And then what will we do?\" the first officer asked. \"Once the ship has\nbeen purchased, what will our course be? What, in other words, are we to\ndo?\"\n\nIt was Bridey who answered. \"We will speed through space seeking,\nlearning, searching, until you--all of you--pass on to higher planes\nand, leaving the frail shells you now inhabit, occupy proud, splendid\nvessels like the one I wear now. Then, a vast transcendent flotilla, we\nwill seek other universes....\"\n\n\"But we don't become spaceships,\" Iversen said unhappily. \"We don't\nbecome anything.\"\n\n\"How do you know we don't?\" Smullyan demanded, appearing on the\nthreshold. \"How do you know what we become? Build thee more stately\nspaceships, O my soul!\"\n\nAbove all else, Iversen was a space officer and dereliction of duty\ncould not be condoned even in exceptional circumstances. \"Put him in\nirons, somebody!\"\n\n\"Ask Bridey why there were only forty-five spaceships on his planet!\"\nthe doctor yelled over his shoulder as he was dragged off. \"Ask where\nthe others went--where they are now.\"\n\nBut Bridey wouldn't answer that question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Once a Greech, by Evelyn E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
