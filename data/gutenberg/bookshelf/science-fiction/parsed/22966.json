The children--and most of the parents--gaped in wide-eyed\nwonder. Biff Hawton was too sophisticated to be awed. He stayed on\nbecause he wanted to find out what the trick was that made the gadget\nwork.\n\n\"It's all explained right here in your instruction book,\" the\ndemonstrator said, holding up a garishly printed booklet opened to a\nfour-color diagram. \"You all know how magnets pick up things and I bet\nyou even know that the earth itself is one great big magnet--that's why\ncompasses always point north. Well ... the Atomic Wonder Space Wave\nTapper hangs onto those space waves. Invisibly all about us, and even\ngoing right through us, are the magnetic waves of the earth. The Atomic\nWonder rides these waves just the way a ship rides the waves in the\nocean. Now watch....\"\n\nEvery eye was on him as he put the gaudy model rocketship on top of the\ntable and stepped back. It was made of stamped metal and seemed as\nincapable of flying as a can of ham--which it very much resembled.\nNeither wings, propellors, nor jets broke through the painted surface.\nIt rested on three rubber wheels and coming out through the bottom was a\ndouble strand of thin insulated wire. This white wire ran across the top\nof the black table and terminated in a control box in the demonstrator's\nhand. An indicator light, a switch and a knob appeared to be the only\ncontrols.\n\n\"I turn on the Power Switch, sending a surge of current to the Wave\nReceptors,\" he said. The switch clicked and the light blinked on and off\nwith a steady pulse. Then the man began to slowly turn the knob. \"A\ncareful touch on the Wave Generator is necessary as we are dealing with\nthe powers of the whole world here....\"\n\nA concerted _ahhhh_ swept through the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper\nshivered a bit, then rose slowly into the air. The demonstrator stepped\nback and the toy rose higher and higher, bobbing gently on the invisible\nwaves of magnetic force that supported it. Ever so slowly the power was\nreduced and it settled back to the table.\n\n\"Only $17.95,\" the young man said, putting a large price sign on the\ntable. \"For the complete set of the Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper\ncontrol box, battery and instruction book ...\"\n\nAt the appearance of the price card the crowd broke up noisily and the\nchildren rushed away towards the operating model trains. The\ndemonstrator's words were lost in their noisy passage, and after a\nmoment he sank into a gloomy silence. He put the control box down,\nyawned and sat on the edge of the table. Colonel Hawton was the only one\nleft after the crowd had moved on.\n\n\"Could you tell me how this thing works?\" the colonel asked, coming\nforward. The demonstrator brightened up and picked up one of the toys.\n\n\"Well, if you will look here, sir....\" He opened the hinged top. \"You\nwill see the Space Wave coils at each end of the ship.\" With a pencil he\npointed out the odd shaped plastic forms about an inch in diameter that\nhad been wound--apparently at random--with a few turns of copper wire.\nExcept for these coils the interior of the model was empty. The coils\nwere wired together and other wires ran out through the hole in the\nbottom of the control box. Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical eye on\nthe gadget and upon the demonstrator who completely ignored this sign of\ndisbelief.\n\n\"Inside the control box is the battery,\" the young man said, snapping it\nopen and pointing to an ordinary flashlight battery. \"The current goes\nthrough the Power Switch and Power Light to the Wave Generator ...\"\n\n\"What you mean to say,\" Biff broke in, \"is that the juice from this\nfifteen cent battery goes through this cheap rheostat to those\nmeaningless coils in the model and absolutely nothing happens. Now tell\nme what really flies the thing. If I'm going to drop eighteen bucks for\nsix-bits worth of tin, I want to know what I'm getting.\"\n\nThe demonstrator flushed. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he stammered. \"I wasn't\ntrying to hide anything. Like any magic trick this one can't be really\ndemonstrated until it has been purchased.\" He leaned forward and\nwhispered confidentially. \"I'll tell you what I'll do though. This\nthing is way overpriced and hasn't been moving at all. The manager said\nI could let them go at three dollars if I could find any takers. If you\nwant to buy it for that price....\"\n\n\"Sold, my boy!\" the colonel said, slamming three bills down on the\ntable. \"I'll give that much for it no matter _how_ it works. The boys in\nthe shop will get a kick out of it,\" he tapped the winged rocket on his\nchest. \"Now _really_--what holds it up?\"\n\nThe demonstrator looked around carefully, then pointed. \"Strings!\" he\nsaid. \"Or rather a black thread. It runs from the top of the model,\nthrough a tiny loop in the ceiling, and back down to my hand--tied to\nthis ring on my finger. When I back up--the model rises. It's as simple\nas that.\"\n\n\"All good illusions are simple,\" the colonel grunted, tracing the black\nthread with his eye. \"As long as there is plenty of flimflam to distract\nthe viewer.\"\n\n\"If you don't have a black table, a black cloth will do,\" the young man\nsaid. \"And the arch of a doorway is a good site, just see that the room\nin back is dark.\"\n\n\"Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born yesterday. I'm an old hand at this\nkind of thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBiff Hawton sprang it at the next Thursday-night poker party. The gang\nwere all missile men and they cheered and jeered as he hammed up the\nintroduction.\n\n\"Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I could use some of those magnetic waves\nin the new bird!\"\n\n\"Those flashlight batteries are cheaper than lox, this is the thing of\nthe future!\"\n\nOnly Teddy Kaner caught wise as the flight began. He was an amateur\nmagician and spotted the gimmick at once. He kept silent with\nprofessional courtesy, and smiled ironically as the rest of the bunch\ngrew silent one by one. The colonel was a good showman and he had set\nthe scene well. He almost had them believing in the Space Wave Tapper\nbefore he was through. When the model had landed and he had switched it\noff he couldn't stop them from crowding around the table.\n\n\"A thread!\" one of the engineers shouted, almost with relief, and they\nall laughed along with him.\n\n\"Too bad,\" the head project physicist said, \"I was hoping that a little\nSpace Wave Tapping could help us out. Let me try a flight with it.\"\n\n\"Teddy Kaner first,\" Biff announced. \"He spotted it while you were all\nwatching the flashing lights, only he didn't say anything.\"\n\nKaner slipped the ring with the black thread over his finger and started\nto step back.\n\n\"You have to turn the switch on first,\" Biff said.\n\n\"I know,\" Kaner smiled. \"But that's part of illusion--the spiel and the\nmisdirection. I'm going to try this cold first, so I can get it moving\nup and down smoothly, then go through it with the whole works.\"\n\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY BREY]\n\nHe moved his hand back smoothly, in a professional manner that drew no\nattention to it. The model lifted from the table--then crashed back\ndown.\n\n\"The thread broke,\" Kaner said.\n\n\"You jerked it, instead of pulling smoothly,\" Biff said and knotted the\nbroken thread. \"Here let me show you how to do it.\"\n\nThe thread broke again when Biff tried it, which got a good laugh that\nmade his collar a little warm. Someone mentioned the poker game.\n\nThis was the only time that poker was mentioned or even remembered that\nnight. Because very soon after this they found that the thread would\nlift the model only when the switch was on and two and a half volts\nflowing through the joke coils. With the current turned off the model\nwas too heavy to lift. The thread broke every time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I still think it's a screwy idea,\" the young man said. \"One week\ngetting fallen arches, demonstrating those toy ships for every brat\nwithin a thousand miles. Then selling the things for three bucks when\nthey must have cost at least a hundred dollars apiece to make.\"\n\n\"But you _did_ sell the ten of them to people who would be interested?\"\nthe older man asked.\n\n\"I think so, I caught a few Air Force officers and a colonel in missiles\none day. Then there was one official I remembered from the Bureau of\nStandards. Luckily he didn't recognize me. Then those two professors you\nspotted from the university.\"\n\n\"Then the problem is out of our hands and into theirs. All we have to do\nnow is sit back and wait for results.\"\n\n\"_What_ results?! These people weren't interested when we were hammering\non their doors with the proof. We've patented the coils and can prove to\nanyone that there is a reduction in weight around them when they are\noperating....\"\n\n\"But a small reduction. And we don't know what is causing it. No one can\nbe interested in a thing like that--a fractional weight decrease in a\nclumsy model, certainly not enough to lift the weight of the generator.\nNo one wrapped up in massive fuel consumption, tons of lift and such is\ngoing to have time to worry about a crackpot who thinks he has found a\nminor slip in Newton's laws.\"\n\n\"You think they will now?\" the young man asked, cracking his knuckles\nimpatiently.\n\n\"I _know_ they will. The tensile strength of that thread is correctly\nadjusted to the weight of the model. The thread will break if you try to\nlift the model with it. Yet you can lift the model--after a small\nincrement of its weight has been removed by the coils. This is going to\nbug these men. Nobody is going to ask them to solve the problem or\nconcern themselves with it. But it will nag at them because they know\nthis effect can't possibly exist. They'll see at once that the\nmagnetic-wave theory is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We don't know. But\nthey will all be thinking about it and worrying about it. Someone is\ngoing to experiment in his basement--just as a hobby of course--to find\nthe cause of the error. And he or someone else is going to find out what\nmakes those coils work, or maybe a way to improve them!\"\n\n\"And we have the patents....\"\n\n\"Correct. They will be doing the research that will take them out of the\nmassive-lift-propulsion business and into the field of pure space\nflight.\"\n\n\"And in doing so they will be making us rich--whenever the time comes to\nmanufacture,\" the young man said cynically.\n\n\"We'll all be rich, son,\" the older man said, patting him on the\nshoulder. \"Believe me, you're not going to recognize this old world ten\nyears from now.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog_ April 1962.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
