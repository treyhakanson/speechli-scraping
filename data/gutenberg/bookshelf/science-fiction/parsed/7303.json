Since it was published what was left out\nof it has loomed up as so much more important than what it contained that\nI have been constrained to write another book. I have taken the date of\nLooking Backward, the year 2000, as that of Equality, and have utilized\nthe framework of the former story as a starting point for this which I\nnow offer. In order that those who have not read Looking Backward may be\nat no disadvantage, an outline of the essential features of that story is\nsubjoined:\n\nIn the year 1887 Julian West was a rich young man living in Boston. He\nwas soon to be married to a young lady of wealthy family named Edith\nBartlett, and meanwhile lived alone with his man-servant Sawyer in the\nfamily mansion. Being a sufferer from insomnia, he had caused a chamber\nto be built of stone beneath the foundation of the house, which he used\nfor a sleeping room. When even the silence and seclusion of this retreat\nfailed to bring slumber, he sometimes called in a professional mesmerizer\nto put him into a hypnotic sleep, from which Sawyer knew how to arouse\nhim at a fixed time. This habit, as well as the existence of the\nunderground chamber, were secrets known only to Sawyer and the hypnotist\nwho rendered his services. On the night of May 30, 1887, West sent for\nthe latter, and was put to sleep as usual. The hypnotist had previously\ninformed his patron that he was intending to leave the city permanently\nthe same evening, and referred him to other practitioners. That night the\nhouse of Julian West took fire and was wholly destroyed. Remains\nidentified as those of Sawyer were found and, though no vestige of West\nappeared, it was assumed that he of course had also perished.\n\nOne hundred and thirteen years later, in September, A. D. 2000, Dr.\nLeete, a physician of Boston, on the retired list, was conducting\nexcavations in his garden for the foundations of a private laboratory,\nwhen the workers came on a mass of masonry covered with ashes and\ncharcoal. On opening it, a vault, luxuriously fitted up in the style of a\nnineteenth-century bedchamber, was found, and on the bed the body of a\nyoung man looking as if he had just lain down to sleep. Although great\ntrees had been growing above the vault, the unaccountable preservation of\nthe youth's body tempted Dr. Leete to attempt resuscitation, and to his\nown astonishment his efforts proved successful. The sleeper returned to\nlife, and after a short time to the full vigor of youth which his\nappearance had indicated. His shock on learning what had befallen him was\nso great as to have endangered his sanity but for the medical skill of\nDr. Leete, and the not less sympathetic ministrations of the other\nmembers of the household, the doctor's wife, and Edith the beautiful\ndaughter. Presently, however, the young man forgot to wonder at what had\nhappened to himself in his astonishment on learning of the social\ntransformation through which the world had passed while he lay sleeping.\nStep by step, almost as to a child, his hosts explained to him, who had\nknown no other way of living except the struggle for existence, what were\nthe simple principles of national co-operation for the promotion of the\ngeneral welfare on which the new civilization rested. He learned that\nthere were no longer any who were or could be richer or poorer than\nothers, but that all were economic equals. He learned that no one any\nlonger worked for another, either by compulsion or for hire, but that all\nalike were in the service of the nation working for the common fund,\nwhich all equally shared, and that even necessary personal attendance, as\nof the physician, was rendered as to the state like that of the military\nsurgeon. All these wonders, it was explained, had very simply come about\nas the results of replacing private capitalism by public capitalism, and\norganizing the machinery of production and distribution, like the\npolitical government, as business of general concern to be carried on for\nthe public benefit instead of private gain.\n\nBut, though it was not long before the young stranger's first\nastonishment at the institutions of the new world had passed into\nenthusiastic admiration and he was ready to admit that the race had for\nthe first time learned how to live, he presently began to repine at a\nfate which had introduced him to the new world, only to leave him\noppressed by a sense of hopeless loneliness which all the kindness of his\nnew friends could not relieve, feeling, as he must, that it was dictated\nby pity only. Then it was that he first learned that his experience had\nbeen a yet more marvelous one than he had supposed. Edith Leete was no\nother than the great-granddaughter of Edith Bartlett, his betrothed, who,\nafter long mourning her lost lover, had at last allowed herself to be\nconsoled. The story of the tragical bereavement which had shadowed her\nearly life was a family tradition, and among the family heirlooms were\nletters from Julian West, together with a photograph which represented so\nhandsome a youth that Edith was illogically inclined to quarrel with her\ngreat-grandmother for ever marrying anybody else. As for the young man's\npicture, she kept it on her dressing table. Of course, it followed that\nthe identity of the tenant of the subterranean chamber had been fully\nknown to his rescuers from the moment of the discovery; but Edith, for\nreasons of her own, had insisted that he should not know who she was till\nshe saw fit to tell him. When, at the proper time, she had seen fit to do\nthis, there was no further question of loneliness for the young man, for\nhow could destiny more unmistakably have indicated that two persons were\nmeant for each other?\n\nHis cup of happiness now being full, he had an experience in which it\nseemed to be dashed from his lips. As he lay on his bed in Dr. Leete's\nhouse he was oppressed by a hideous nightmare. It seemed to him that he\nopened his eyes to find himself on his bed in the underground chamber\nwhere the mesmerizer had put him to sleep. Sawyer was just completing the\npasses used to break the hypnotic influence. He called for the morning\npaper, and read on the date line May 31, 1887. Then he knew that all this\nwonderful matter about the year 2000, its happy, care-free world of\nbrothers and the fair girl he had met there were but fragments of a\ndream. His brain in a whirl, he went forth into the city. He saw\neverything with new eyes, contrasting it with what he had seen in the\nBoston of the year 2000. The frenzied folly of the competitive industrial\nsystem, the inhuman contrasts of luxury and woe--pride and\nabjectness--the boundless squalor, wretchedness, and madness of the whole\nscheme of things which met his eye at every turn, outraged his reason and\nmade his heart sick. He felt like a sane man shut up by accident in a\nmadhouse. After a day of this wandering he found himself at nightfall in\na company of his former companions, who rallied him on his distraught\nappearance. He told them of his dream and what it had taught him of the\npossibilities of a juster, nobler, wiser social system. He reasoned with\nthem, showing how easy it would be, laying aside the suicidal folly of\ncompetition, by means of fraternal co-operation, to make the actual world\nas blessed as that he had dreamed of. At first they derided him, but,\nseeing his earnestness, grew angry, and denounced him as a pestilent\nfellow, an anarchist, an enemy of society, and drove him from them. Then\nit was that, in an agony of weeping, he awoke, this time awaking really,\nnot falsely, and found himself in his bed in Dr. Leete's house, with the\nmorning sun of the twentieth century shining in his eyes. Looking from\nthe window of his room, he saw Edith in the garden gathering flowers for\nthe breakfast table, and hastened to descend to her and relate his\nexperience. At this point we will leave him to continue the narrative for\nhimself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nI.--A SHARP CROSS-EXAMINER\n\nII.--WHY THE REVOLUTION DID NOT COME EARLIER\n\nIII.--I ACQUIRE A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY\n\nIV.--A TWENTIETH-CENTURY BANK PARLOR\n\nV.--I EXPERIENCE A NEW SENSATION\n\nVI.--HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE\n\nVII.--A STRING OF SURPRISES\n\nVIII.--THE GREATEST WONDER YET--FASHION DETHRONED\n\nIX.--SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT CHANGED\n\nX.--A MIDNIGHT PLUNGE\n\nXI.--LIFE THE BASIS OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY\n\nXII.--HOW INEQUALITY OF WEALTH DESTROYS LIBERTY\n\nXIII.--PRIVATE CAPITAL STOLEN FROM THE SOCIAL FUND\n\nXIV.--WE LOOK OVER MY COLLECTION OF HARNESSES\n\nXV.--WHAT WE WERE COMING TO BUT FOR THE REVOLUTION\n\nXVI.--AN EXCUSE THAT CONDEMNED\n\nXVII.--THE REVOLUTION SAVES PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM MONOPOLY\n\nXVIII.--AN ECHO OF THE PAST\n\nXIX.--\"CAN A MAID FORGET HER ORNAMENTS?\"\n\nXX.--WHAT THE REVOLUTION DID FOR WOMEN\n\nXXI.--AT THE GYMNASIUM\n\nXXII.--ECONOMIC SUICIDE OF THE PROFIT SYSTEM\n\nXXIII.--\"THE PARABLE OF THE WATER TANK\"\n\nXXIV.--I AM SHOWN ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH\n\nXXV.--THE STRIKERS\n\nXXVI.--FOREIGN COMMERCE UNDER PROFITS; PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE, OR\nBETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA\n\nXXVII.--HOSTILITY OF A SYSTEM OF VESTED INTERESTS TO IMPROVEMENT\n\nXXVIII.--HOW THE PROFIT SYSTEM NULLIFIED THE BENEFIT OF INVENTIONS\n\nXXIX.--I RECEIVE AN OVATION\n\nXXX.--WHAT UNIVERSAL CULTURE MEANS\n\nXXXI.--\"NEITHER IN THIS MOUNTAIN NOR AT JERUSALEM\"\n\nXXXII.--ERITIS SICUT DEUS\n\nXXXIII.--SEVERAL IMPORTANT MATTERS OVERLOOKED\n\nXXXIV.--WHAT STARTED THE REVOLUTION\n\nXXXV.--WHY THE REVOLUTION WENT SLOW AT FIRST BUT FAST AT LAST\n\nXXXVI.--THEATER-GOING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nXXXVII.--THE TRANSITION PERIOD\n\nXXXVIII.--THE BOOK OF THE BLIND\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEQUALITY.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nA SHARP CROSS-EXAMINER.\n\nWith many expressions of sympathy and interest Edith listened to the\nstory of my dream. When, finally, I had made an end, she remained musing.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" I said.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" she answered, \"how it would have been if your dream had\nbeen true.\"\n\n\"True!\" I exclaimed. \"How could it have been true?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" she said, \"if it had all been a dream, as you supposed it was\nin your nightmare, and you had never really seen our Republic of the\nGolden Rule or me, but had only slept a night and dreamed the whole thing\nabout us. And suppose you had gone forth just as you did in your dream,\nand had passed up and down telling men of the terrible folly and\nwickedness of their way of life and how much nobler and happier a way\nthere was. Just think what good you might have done, how you might have\nhelped people in those days when they needed help so much. It seems to me\nyou must be almost sorry you came back to us.\"\n\n\"You look as if you were almost sorry yourself,\" I said, for her wistful\nexpression seemed susceptible of that interpretation.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she answered, smiling. \"It was only on your own account. As for\nme, I have very good reasons for being glad that you came back.\"\n\n\"I should say so, indeed. Have you reflected that if I had dreamed it all\nyou would have had no existence save as a figment in the brain of a\nsleeping man a hundred years ago?\"\n\n\"I had not thought of that part of it,\" she said smiling and still half\nserious; \"yet if I could have been more useful to humanity as a fiction\nthan as a reality, I ought not to have minded the--the inconvenience.\"\n\nBut I replied that I greatly feared no amount of opportunity to help\nmankind in general would have reconciled me to life anywhere or under any\nconditions after leaving her behind in a dream--a confession of shameless\nselfishness which she was pleased to pass over without special rebuke, in\nconsideration, no doubt, of my unfortunate bringing up.\n\n\"Besides,\" I resumed, being willing a little further to vindicate myself,\n\"it would not have done any good. I have just told you how in my\nnightmare last night, when I tried to tell my contemporaries and even my\nbest friends about the nobler way men might live together, they derided\nme as a fool and madman. That is exactly what they would have done in\nreality had the dream been true and I had gone about preaching as in the\ncase you supposed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps a few might at first have acted as you dreamed they did,\" she\nreplied. \"Perhaps they would not at once have liked the idea of economic\nequality, fearing that it might mean a leveling down for them, and not\nunderstanding that it would presently mean a leveling up of all together\nto a vastly higher plane of life and happiness, of material welfare and\nmoral dignity than the most fortunate had ever enjoyed. But even if the\nrich had at first mistaken you for an enemy to their class, the poor, the\ngreat masses of the poor, the real nation, they surely from the first\nwould have listened as for their lives, for to them your story would have\nmeant glad tidings of great joy.\"\n\n\"I do not wonder that you think so,\" I answered, \"but, though I am still\nlearning the A B C of this new world, I knew my contemporaries, and I\nknow that it would not have been as you fancy. The poor would have\nlistened no better than the rich, for, though poor and rich in my day\nwere at bitter odds in everything else, they were agreed in believing\nthat there must always be rich and poor, and that a condition of material\nequality was impossible. It used to be commonly said, and it often seemed\ntrue, that the social reformer who tried to better the condition of the\npeople found a more discouraging obstacle in the hopelessness of the\nmasses he would raise than in the active resistance of the few, whose\nsuperiority was threatened. And indeed, Edith, to be fair to my own\nclass, I am bound to say that with the best of the rich it was often as\nmuch this same hopelessness as deliberate selfishness that made them what\nwe used to call conservative. So you see, it would have done no good even\nif I had gone to preaching as you fancied. The poor would have regarded\nmy talk about the possibility of an equality of wealth as a fairy tale,\nnot worth a laboring man's time to listen to. Of the rich, the baser sort\nwould have mocked and the better sort would have sighed, but none would\nhave given ear seriously.\"\n\nBut Edith smiled serenely.\n\n\"It seems very audacious for me to try to correct your impressions of\nyour own contemporaries and of what they might be expected to think and\ndo, but you see the peculiar circumstances give me a rather unfair\nadvantage. Your knowledge of your times necessarily stops short with\n1887, when you became oblivious of the course of events. I, on the other\nhand, having gone to school in the twentieth century, and been obliged,\nmuch against my will, to study nineteenth-century history, naturally know\nwhat happened after the date at which your knowledge ceased. I know,\nimpossible as it may seem to you, that you had scarcely fallen into that\nlong sleep before the American people began to be deeply and widely\nstirred with aspirations for an equal order such as we enjoy, and that\nvery soon the political movement arose which, after various mutations,\nresulted early in the twentieth century in overthrowing the old system\nand setting up the present one.\"\n\nThis was indeed interesting information to me, but when I began to\nquestion Edith further, she sighed and shook her head.\n\n\"Having tried to show my superior knowledge, I must now confess my\nignorance. All I know is the bare fact that the revolutionary movement\nbegan, as I said, very soon after you fell asleep. Father must tell you\nthe rest. I might as well admit while I am about it, for you would soon\nfind it out, that I know almost nothing either as to the Revolution or\nnineteenth-century matters generally. You have no idea how hard I have\nbeen trying to post myself on the subject so as to be able to talk\nintelligently with you, but I fear it is of no use. I could not\nunderstand it in school and can not seem to understand it any better now.\nMore than ever this morning I am sure that I never shall. Since you have\nbeen telling me how the old world appeared to you in that dream, your\ntalk has brought those days so terribly near that I can almost see them,\nand yet I can not say that they seem a bit more intelligible than\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Things were bad enough and black enough certainly,\" I said; \"but I don't\nsee what there was particularly unintelligible about them. What is the\ndifficulty?\"\n\n\"The main difficulty comes from the complete lack of agreement between\nthe pretensions of your contemporaries about the way their society was\norganized and the actual facts as given in the histories.\"\n\n\"For example?\" I queried.\n\n\"I don't suppose there is much use in trying to explain my trouble,\" she\nsaid. \"You will only think me stupid for my pains, but I'll try to make\nyou see what I mean. You ought to be able to clear up the matter if\nanybody can. You have just been telling me about the shockingly unequal\nconditions of the people, the contrasts of waste and want, the pride and\npower of the rich, the abjectness and servitude of the poor, and all the\nrest of the dreadful story.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It appears that these contrasts were almost as great as at any previous\nperiod of history.\"\n\n\"It is doubtful,\" I replied, \"if there was ever a greater disparity\nbetween the conditions of different classes than you would find in a half\nhour's walk in Boston, New York, Chicago, or any other great city of\nAmerica in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said Edith, \"it appears from all the books that meanwhile the\nAmericans' great boast was that they differed from all other and former\nnations in that they were free and equal. One is constantly coming upon\nthis phrase in the literature of the day. Now, you have made it clear\nthat they were neither free nor equal in any ordinary sense of the word,\nbut were divided as mankind had always been before into rich and poor,\nmasters and servants. Won't you please tell me, then, what they meant by\ncalling themselves free and equal?\"\n\n\"It was meant, I suppose, that they were all equal before the law.\"\n\n\"That means in the courts. And were the rich and poor equal in the\ncourts? Did they receive the same treatment?\"\n\n\"I am bound to say,\" I replied, \"that they were nowhere else more\nunequal. The law applied in terms to all alike, but not in fact. There\nwas more difference in the position of the rich and the poor man before\nthe law than in any other respect. The rich were practically above the\nlaw, the poor under its wheels.\"\n\n\"In what respect, then, were the rich and poor equal?\"\n\n\"They were said to be equal in opportunities.\"\n\n\"Opportunities for what?\"\n\n\"For bettering themselves, for getting rich, for getting ahead of others\nin the struggle for wealth.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that only meant, if it were true, not that all were\nequal, but that all had an equal chance to make themselves unequal. But\nwas it true that all had equal opportunities for getting rich and\nbettering themselves?\"\n\n\"It may have been so to some extent at one time when the country was\nnew,\" I replied, \"but it was no more so in my day. Capital had\npractically monopolized all economic opportunities by that time; there\nwas no opening in business enterprise for those without large capital\nsave by some extraordinary fortune.\"\n\n\"But surely,\" said Edith, \"there must have been, in order to give at\nleast a color to all this boasting about equality, some one respect in\nwhich the people were really equal?\"\n\n\"Yes, there was. They were political equals. They all had one vote alike,\nand the majority was the supreme lawgiver.\"\n\n\"So the books say, but that only makes the actual condition of things\nmore absolutely unaccountable.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Why, because if these people all had an equal voice in the\ngovernment--these toiling, starving, freezing, wretched masses of the\npoor--why did they not without a moment's delay put an end to the\ninequalities from which they suffered?\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" she added, as I did not at once reply, \"I am only showing\nhow stupid I am by saying this. Doubtless I am overlooking some important\nfact, but did you not say that all the people, at least all the men, had\na voice in the government?\"\n\n\"Certainly; by the latter part of the nineteenth century manhood suffrage\nhad become practically universal in America.\"\n\n\"That is to say, the people through their chosen agents made all the\nlaws. Is that what you mean?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But I remember you had Constitutions of the nation and of the States.\nPerhaps they prevented the people from doing quite what they wished.\"\n\n\"No; the Constitutions were only a little more fundamental sort of laws.\nThe majority made and altered them at will. The people were the sole and\nsupreme final power, and their will was absolute.\"\n\n\"If, then, the majority did not like any existing arrangement, or think\nit to their advantage, they could change it as radically as they wished?\"\n\n\"Certainly; the popular majority could do anything if it was large and\ndetermined enough.\"\n\n\"And the majority, I understand, were the poor, not the rich--the ones\nwho had the wrong side of the inequalities that prevailed?\"\n\n\"Emphatically so; the rich were but a handful comparatively.\"\n\n\"Then there was nothing whatever to prevent the people at any time, if\nthey just willed it, from making an end of their sufferings and\norganizing a system like ours which would guarantee their equality and\nprosperity?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever.\"\n\n\"Then once more I ask you to kindly tell me why, in the name of common\nsense, they didn't do it at once and be happy instead of making a\nspectacle of themselves so woeful that even a hundred years after it\nmakes us cry?\"\n\n\"Because,\" I replied, \"they were taught and believed that the regulation\nof industry and commerce and the production and distribution of wealth\nwas something wholly outside of the proper province of government.\"\n\n\"But, dear me, Julian, life itself and everything that meanwhile makes\nlife worth living, from the satisfaction of the most primary physical\nneeds to the gratification of the most refined tastes, all that belongs\nto the development of mind as well as body, depend first, last, and\nalways on the manner in which the production and distribution of wealth\nis regulated. Surely that must have been as true in your day as ours.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"And yet you tell me, Julian, that the people, after having abolished the\nrule of kings and taken the supreme power of regulating their affairs\ninto their own hands, deliberately consented to exclude from their\njurisdiction the control of the most important, and indeed the only\nreally important, class of their interests.\"\n\n\"Do not the histories say so?\"\n\n\"They do say so, and that is precisely why I could never believe them.\nThe thing seemed so incomprehensible I thought there must be some way of\nexplaining it. But tell me, Julian, seeing the people did not think that\nthey could trust themselves to regulate their own industry and the\ndistribution of the product, to whom did they leave the responsibility?\"\n\n\"To the capitalists.\"\n\n\"And did the people elect the capitalists?\"\n\n\"Nobody elected them.\"\n\n\"By whom, then, were they appointed?\"\n\n\"Nobody appointed them.\"\n\n\"What a singular system! Well, if nobody elected or appointed them, yet\nsurely they must have been accountable to somebody for the manner in\nwhich they exercised powers on which the welfare and very existence of\neverybody depended.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were accountable to nobody and nothing but their\nown consciences.\"\n\n\"Their consciences! Ah, I see! You mean that they were so benevolent, so\nunselfish, so devoted to the public good, that people tolerated their\nusurpation out of gratitude. The people nowadays would not endure the\nirresponsible rule even of demigods, but probably it was different in\nyour day.\"\n\n\"As an ex-capitalist myself, I should be pleased to confirm your surmise,\nbut nothing could really be further from the fact. As to any benevolent\ninterest in the conduct of industry and commerce, the capitalists\nexpressly disavowed it. Their only object was to secure the greatest\npossible gain for themselves without any regard whatever to the welfare\nof the public.\"\n\n\"Dear me! Dear me! Why you make out these capitalists to have been even\nworse than the kings, for the kings at least professed to govern for the\nwelfare of their people, as fathers acting for children, and the good\nones did try to. But the capitalists, you say, did not even pretend to\nfeel any responsibility for the welfare of their subjects?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"And, if I understand,\" pursued Edith, \"this government of the\ncapitalists was not only without moral sanction of any sort or plea of\nbenevolent intentions, but was practically an economic failure--that is,\nit did not secure the prosperity of the people.\"\n\n\"What I saw in my dream last night,\" I replied, \"and have tried to tell\nyou this morning, gives but a faint suggestion of the misery of the world\nunder capitalist rule.\"\n\nEdith meditated in silence for some moments. Finally she said: \"Your\ncontemporaries were not madmen nor fools; surely there is something you\nhave not told me; there must be some explanation or at least color of\nexcuse why the people not only abdicated the power of controling their\nmost vital and important interests, but turned them over to a class which\ndid not even pretend any interest in their welfare, and whose government\ncompletely failed to secure it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said, \"there was an explanation, and a very fine-sounding\none. It was in the name of individual liberty, industrial freedom, and\nindividual initiative that the economic government of the country was\nsurrendered to the capitalists.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that a form of government which seems to have been the most\nirresponsible and despotic possible was defended in the name of liberty?\"\n\n\"Certainly; the liberty of economic initiative by the individual.\"\n\n\"But did you not just tell me that economic initiative and business\nopportunity in your day were practically monopolized by the capitalists\nthemselves?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It was admitted that there was no opening for any but\ncapitalists in business, and it was rapidly becoming so that only the\ngreatest of the capitalists themselves had any power of initiative.\"\n\n\"And yet you say that the reason given for abandoning industry to\ncapitalist government was the promotion of industrial freedom and\nindividual initiative among the people at large.\"\n\n\"Certainly. The people were taught that they would individually enjoy\ngreater liberty and freedom of action in industrial matters under the\ndominion of the capitalists than if they collectively conducted the\nindustrial system for their own benefit; that the capitalists would,\nmoreover, look out for their welfare more wisely and kindly than they\ncould possibly do it themselves, so that they would be able to provide\nfor themselves more bountifully out of such portion of their product as\nthe capitalists might be disposed to give them than they possibly could\ndo if they became their own employers and divided the whole product among\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"But that was mere mockery; it was adding insult to injury.\"\n\n\"It sounds so, doesn't it? But I assure you it was considered the\nsoundest sort of political economy in my time. Those who questioned it\nwere set down as dangerous visionaries.\"\n\n\"But I suppose the people's government, the government they voted for,\nmust have done something. There must have been some odds and ends of\nthings which the capitalists left the political government to attend to.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed. It had its hands full keeping the peace among the\npeople. That was the main part of the business of political governments\nin my day.\"\n\n\"Why did the peace require such a great amount of keeping? Why didn't it\nkeep itself, as it does now?\"\n\n\"On account of the inequality of conditions which prevailed. The strife\nfor wealth and desperation of want kept in quenchless blaze a hell of\ngreed and envy, fear, lust, hate, revenge, and every foul passion of the\npit. To keep this general frenzy in some restraint, so that the entire\nsocial system should not resolve itself into a general massacre, required\nan army of soldiers, police, judges, and jailers, and endless law-making\nto settle the quarrels. Add to these elements of discord a horde of\noutcasts degraded and desperate, made enemies of society by their\nsufferings and requiring to be kept in check, and you will readily admit\nthere was enough for the people's government to do.\"\n\n\"So far as I can see,\" said Edith, \"the main business of the people's\ngovernment was to struggle with the social chaos which resulted from its\nfailure to take hold of the economic system and regulate it on a basis of\njustice.\"\n\n\"That is exactly so. You could not state the whole case more adequately\nif you wrote a book.\"\n\n\"Beyond protecting the capitalist system from its own effects, did the\npolitical government do absolutely nothing?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it appointed postmasters and tidewaiters, maintained an army\nand navy, and picked quarrels with foreign countries.\"\n\n\"I should say that the right of a citizen to have a voice in a government\nlimited to the range of functions you have mentioned would scarcely have\nseemed to him of much value.\"\n\n\"I believe the average price of votes in close elections in America in my\ntime was about two dollars.\"\n\n\"Dear me, so much as that!\" said Edith. \"I don't know exactly what the\nvalue of money was in your day, but I should say the price was rather\nextortionate.\"\n\n\"I think you are right,\" I answered. \"I used to give in to the talk about\nthe pricelessness of the right of suffrage, and the denunciation of those\nwhom any stress of poverty could induce to sell it for money, but from\nthe point of view to which you have brought me this morning I am inclined\nto think that the fellows who sold their votes had a far clearer idea of\nthe sham of our so-called popular government, as limited to the class of\nfunctions I have described, than any of the rest of us did, and that if\nthey were wrong it was, as you suggest, in asking too high a price.\"\n\n\"But who paid for the votes?\"\n\n\"You are a merciless cross-examiner,\" I said. \"The classes which had an\ninterest in controling the government--that is, the capitalists and the\noffice-seekers--did the buying. The capitalists advanced the money\nnecessary to procure the election of the office-seekers on the\nunderstanding that when elected the latter should do what the capitalists\nwanted. But I ought not to give you the impression that the bulk of the\nvotes were bought outright. That would have been too open a confession of\nthe sham of popular government as well as too expensive. The money\ncontributed by the capitalists to procure the election of the\noffice-seekers was mainly expended to influence the people by indirect\nmeans. Immense sums under the name of campaign funds were raised for this\npurpose and used in innumerable devices, such as fireworks, oratory,\nprocessions, brass bands, barbecues, and all sorts of devices, the object\nof which was to galvanize the people to a sufficient degree of interest\nin the election to go through the motion of voting. Nobody who has not\nactually witnessed a nineteenth-century American election could even\nbegin to imagine the grotesqueness of the spectacle.\"\n\n\"It seems, then,\" said Edith, \"that the capitalists not only carried on\nthe economic government as their special province, but also practically\nmanaged the machinery of the political government as well.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, the capitalists could not have got along at all without control\nof the political government. Congress, the Legislatures, and the city\ncouncils were quite necessary as instruments for putting through their\nschemes. Moreover, in order to protect themselves and their property\nagainst popular outbreaks, it was highly needful that they should have\nthe police, the courts, and the soldiers devoted to their interests, and\nthe President, Governors, and mayors at their beck.\"\n\n\"But I thought the President, the Governors, and Legislatures represented\nthe people who voted for them.\"\n\n\"Bless your heart! no, why should they? It was to the capitalists and not\nto the people that they owed the opportunity of officeholding. The people\nwho voted had little choice for whom they should vote. That question was\ndetermined by the political party organizations, which were beggars to\nthe capitalists for pecuniary support. No man who was opposed to\ncapitalist interests was permitted the opportunity as a candidate to\nappeal to the people. For a public official to support the people's\ninterest as against that of the capitalists would be a sure way of\nsacrificing his career. You must remember, if you would understand how\nabsolutely the capitalists controled the Government, that a President,\nGovernor, or mayor, or member of the municipal, State, or national\ncouncil, was only temporarily a servant of the people or dependent on\ntheir favour. His public position he held only from election to election,\nand rarely long. His permanent, lifelong, and all-controling interest,\nlike that of us all, was his livelihood, and that was dependent, not on\nthe applause of the people, but the favor and patronage of capital, and\nthis he could not afford to imperil in the pursuit of the bubbles of\npopularity. These circumstances, even if there had been no instances of\ndirect bribery, sufficiently explained why our politicians and\nofficeholders with few exceptions were vassals and tools of the\ncapitalists. The lawyers, who, on account of the complexities of our\nsystem, were almost the only class competent for public business, were\nespecially and directly dependent upon the patronage of the great\ncapitalistic interests for their living.\"\n\n\"But why did not the people elect officials and representatives of their\nown class, who would look out for the interests of the masses?\"\n\n\"There was no assurance that they would be more faithful. Their very\npoverty would make them the more liable to money temptation; and the\npoor, you must remember, although so much more pitiable, were not morally\nany better than the rich. Then, too--and that was the most important\nreason why the masses of the people, who were poor, did not send men of\ntheir class to represent them--poverty as a rule implied ignorance, and\ntherefore practical inability, even where the intention was good. As soon\nas the poor man developed intelligence he had every temptation to desert\nhis class and seek the patronage of capital.\"\n\nEdith remained silent and thoughtful for some moments.\n\n\"Really,\" she said, finally, \"it seems that the reason I could not\nunderstand the so-called popular system of government in your day is that\nI was trying to find out what part the people had in it, and it appears\nthat they had no part at all.\"\n\n\"You are getting on famously,\" I exclaimed. \"Undoubtedly the confusion of\nterms in our political system is rather calculated to puzzle one at\nfirst, but if you only grasp firmly the vital point that the rule of the\nrich, the supremacy of capital and its interests, as against those of the\npeople at large, was the central principle of our system, to which every\nother interest was made subservient, you will have the key that clears up\nevery mystery.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nWHY THE REVOLUTION DID NOT COME EARLIER.\n\nAbsorbed in our talk, we had not heard the steps of Dr. Leete as he\napproached.\n\n\"I have been watching you for ten minutes from the house,\" he said,\n\"until, in fact, I could no longer resist the desire to know what you\nfind so interesting.\"\n\n\"Your daughter,\" said I, \"has been proving herself a mistress of the\nSocratic method. Under a plausible pretext of gross ignorance, she has\nbeen asking me a series of easy questions, with the result that I see as\nI never imagined it before the colossal sham of our pretended popular\ngovernment in America. As one of the rich I knew, of course, that we had\na great deal of power in the state, but I did not before realize how\nabsolutely the people were without influence in their own government.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" exclaimed the doctor in great glee, \"so my daughter gets up early\nin the morning with the design of supplanting her father in his position\nof historical instructor?\"\n\nEdith had risen from the garden bench on which we had been seated and was\narranging her flowers to take into the house. She shook her head rather\ngravely in reply to her father's challenge.\n\n\"You need not be at all apprehensive,\" she said; \"Julian has quite cured\nme this morning of any wish I might have had to inquire further into the\ncondition of our ancestors. I have always been dreadfully sorry for the\npoor people of that day on account of the misery they endured from\npoverty and the oppression of the rich. Henceforth, however, I wash my\nhands of them and shall reserve my sympathy for more deserving objects.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the doctor, \"what has so suddenly dried up the fountains\nof your pity? What has Julian been telling you?\"\n\n\"Nothing, really, I suppose, that I had not read before and ought to have\nknown, but the story always seemed so unreasonable and incredible that I\nnever quite believed it until now. I thought there must be some modifying\nfacts not set down in the histories.\"\n\n\"But what is this that he has been telling you?\"\n\n\"It seems,\" said Edith, \"that these very people, these very masses of the\npoor, had all the time the supreme control of the Government and were\nable, if determined and united, to put an end at any moment to all the\ninequalities and oppressions of which they complained and to equalize\nthings as we have done. Not only did they not do this, but they gave as a\nreason for enduring their bondage that their liberties would be\nendangered unless they had irresponsible masters to manage their\ninterests, and that to take charge of their own affairs would imperil\ntheir freedom. I feel that I have been cheated out of all the tears I\nhave shed over the sufferings of such people. Those who tamely endure\nwrongs which they have the power to end deserve not compassion but\ncontempt. I have felt a little badly that Julian should have been one of\nthe oppressor class, one of the rich. Now that I really understand the\nmatter, I am glad. I fear that, had he been one of the poor, one of the\nmass of real masters, who with supreme power in their hands consented to\nbe bondsmen, I should have despised him.\"\n\nHaving thus served formal notice on my contemporaries that they must\nexpect no more sympathy from her, Edith went into the house, leaving me\nwith a vivid impression that if the men of the twentieth century should\nprove incapable of preserving their liberties, the women might be trusted\nto do so.\n\n\"Really, doctor,\" I said, \"you ought to be greatly obliged to your\ndaughter. She has saved you lots of time and effort.\"\n\n\"How so, precisely?\"\n\n\"By rendering it unnecessary for you to trouble yourself to explain to me\nany further how and why you came to set up your nationalized industrial\nsystem and your economic equality. If you have ever seen a desert or sea\nmirage, you remember that, while the picture in the sky is very clear and\ndistinct in itself, its unreality is betrayed by a lack of detail, a sort\nof blur, where it blends with the foreground on which you are standing.\nDo you know that this new social order of which I have so strangely\nbecome a witness has hitherto had something of this mirage effect? In\nitself it is a scheme precise, orderly, and very reasonable, but I could\nsee no way by which it could have naturally grown out of the utterly\ndifferent conditions of the nineteenth century. I could only imagine that\nthis world transformation must have been the result of new ideas and\nforces that had come into action since my day. I had a volume of\nquestions all ready to ask you on the subject, but now we shall be able\nto use the time in talking of other things, for Edith has shown me in ten\nminutes' time that the only wonderful thing about your organization of\nthe industrial system as public business is not that it has taken place,\nbut that it waited so long before taking place, that a nation of rational\nbeings consented to remain economic serfs of irresponsible masters for\nmore than a century after coming into possession of absolute power to\nchange at pleasure all social institutions which inconvenienced them.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said the doctor, \"Edith has shown herself a very efficient\nteacher, if an involuntary one. She has succeeded at one stroke in giving\nyou the modern point of view as to your period. As we look at it, the\nimmortal preamble of the American Declaration of Independence, away back\nin 1776, logically contained the entire statement of the doctrine of\nuniversal economic equality guaranteed by the nation collectively to its\nmembers individually. You remember how the words run:\n\n\"'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created\nequal, with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights\ngovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the\nconsent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes\ndestructive of these rights it is the right of the people to alter or to\nabolish it and institute a new government, laying its foundations on such\nprinciples and organizing its powers in such form as may seem most likely\nto effect their safety and happiness.'\n\n\"Is it possible, Julian, to imagine any governmental system less adequate\nthan ours which could possibly realize this great ideal of what a true\npeople's government should be? The corner stone of our state is economic\nequality, and is not that the obvious, necessary, and only adequate\npledge of these three birthrights--life, liberty, and happiness? What is\nlife without its material basis, and what is an equal right to life but a\nright to an equal material basis for it? What is liberty? How can men be\nfree who must ask the right to labor and to live from their fellow-men\nand seek their bread from the hands of others? How else can any\ngovernment guarantee liberty to men save by providing them a means of\nlabor and of life coupled with independence; and how could that be done\nunless the government conducted the economic system upon which employment\nand maintenance depend? Finally, what is implied in the equal right of\nall to the pursuit of happiness? What form of happiness, so far as it\ndepends at all on material facts, is not bound up with economic\nconditions; and how shall an equal opportunity for the pursuit of\nhappiness be guaranteed to all save by a guarantee of economic equality?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it is indeed all there, but why were we so long in seeing\nit?\"\n\n\"Let us make ourselves comfortable on this bench,\" said the doctor, \"and\nI will tell you what is the modern answer to the very interesting\nquestion you raise. At first glance, certainly the delay of the world in\ngeneral, and especially of the American people, to realize that democracy\nlogically meant the substitution of popular government for the rule of\nthe rich in regulating the production and distribution of wealth seems\nincomprehensible, not only because it was so plain an inference from the\nidea of popular government, but also because it was one which the masses\nof the people were so directly interested in carrying out. Edith's\nconclusion that people who were not capable of so simple a process of\nreasoning as that did not deserve much sympathy for the afflictions they\nmight so easily have remedied, is a very natural first impression.\n\n\"On reflection, however, I think we shall conclude that the time taken by\nthe world in general and the Americans in particular in finding out the\nfull meaning of democracy as an economic as well as a political\nproposition was not greater than might have been expected, considering\nthe vastness of the conclusions involved. It is the democratic idea that\nall human beings are peers in rights and dignity, and that the sole just\nexcuse and end of human governments is, therefore, the maintenance and\nfurtherance of the common welfare on equal terms. This idea was the\ngreatest social conception that the human mind had up to that time ever\nformed. It contained, when first conceived, the promise and potency of a\ncomplete transformation of all then existing social institutions, one and\nall of which had hitherto been based and formed on the principle of\npersonal and class privilege and authority and the domination and selfish\nuse of the many by the few. But it was simply inconsistent with the\nlimitations of the human intellect that the implications of an idea so\nprodigious should at once have been taken in. The idea must absolutely\nhave time to grow. The entire present order of economic democracy and\nequality was indeed logically bound up in the first full statement of the\ndemocratic idea, but only as the full-grown tree is in the seed: in the\none case, as in the other, time was an essential element in the evolution\nof the result.\n\n\"We divide the history of the evolution of the democratic idea into two\nbroadly contrasted phases. The first of these we call the phase of\nnegative democracy. To understand it we must consider how the democratic\nidea originated. Ideas are born of previous ideas and are long in\noutgrowing the characteristics and limitations impressed on them by the\ncircumstances under which they came into existence. The idea of popular\ngovernment, in the case of America as in previous republican experiments\nin general, was a protest against royal government and its abuses.\nNothing is more certain than that the signers of the immortal Declaration\nhad no idea that democracy necessarily meant anything more than a device\nfor getting along without kings. They conceived of it as a change in the\nforms of government only, and not at all in the principles and purposes\nof government.\n\n\"They were not, indeed, wholly without misgivings lest it might some time\noccur to the sovereign people that, being sovereign, it would be a good\nidea to use their sovereignty to improve their own condition. In fact,\nthey seem to have given some serious thought to that possibility, but so\nlittle were they yet able to appreciate the logic and force of the\ndemocratic idea that they believed it possible by ingenious clauses in\npaper Constitutions to prevent the people from using their power to help\nthemselves even if they should wish to.\n\n\"This first phase of the evolution of democracy, during which it was\nconceived of solely as a substitute for royalty, includes all the\nso-called republican experiments up to the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, of which, of course, the American Republic was the most\nimportant. During this period the democratic idea remained a mere protest\nagainst a previous form of government, absolutely without any new\npositive or vital principle of its own. Although the people had deposed\nthe king as driver of the social chariot, and taken the reins into their\nown hands, they did not think as yet of anything but keeping the vehicle\nin the old ruts and naturally the passengers scarcely noticed the change.\n\n\"The second phase in the evolution of the democratic idea began with the\nawakening of the people to the perception that the deposing of kings,\ninstead of being the main end and mission of democracy, was merely\npreliminary to its real programme, which was the use of the collective\nsocial machinery for the indefinite promotion of the welfare of the\npeople at large.\n\n\"It is an interesting fact that the people began to think of applying\ntheir political power to the improvement of their material condition in\nEurope earlier than in America, although democratic forms had found much\nless acceptance there. This was, of course, on account of the perennial\neconomic distress of the masses in the old countries, which prompted them\nto think first about the bearing any new idea might have on the question\nof livelihood. On the other hand, the general prosperity of the masses in\nAmerica and the comparative ease of making a living up to the beginning\nof the last quarter of the nineteenth century account for the fact that\nit was not till then that the American people began to think seriously of\nimproving their economic condition by collective action.\n\n\"During the negative phase of democracy it had been considered as\ndiffering from monarchy only as two machines might differ, the general\nuse and purpose of which were the same. With the evolution of the\ndemocratic idea into the second or positive phase, it was recognized that\nthe transfer of the supreme power from king and nobles to people meant\nnot merely a change in the forms of government, but a fundamental\nrevolution in the whole idea of government, its motives, purposes, and\nfunctions--a revolution equivalent to a reversal of polarity of the\nentire social system, carrying, so to speak, the entire compass card with\nit, and making north south, and east west. Then was seen what seems so\nplain to us that it is hard to understand why it was not always seen,\nthat instead of its being proper for the sovereign people to confine\nthemselves to the functions which the kings and classes had discharged\nwhen they were in power, the presumption was, on the contrary, since the\ninterest of kings and classes had always been exactly opposed to those of\nthe people, that whatever the previous governments had done, the people\nas rulers ought not to do, and whatever the previous governments had not\ndone, it would be presumably for the interest of the people to do; and\nthat the main use and function of popular government was properly one\nwhich no previous government had ever paid any attention to, namely, the\nuse of the power of the social organization to raise the material and\nmoral welfare of the whole body of the sovereign people to the highest\npossible point at which the same degree of welfare could be secured to\nall--that is to say, an equal level. The democracy of the second or\npositive phase triumphed in the great Revolution, and has since been the\nonly form of government known in the world.\"\n\n\"Which amounts to saying,\" I observed, \"that there never was a democratic\ngovernment properly so called before the twentieth century.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" assented the doctor. \"The so-called republics of the first\nphase we class as pseudo-republics or negative democracies. They were\nnot, of course, in any sense, truly popular governments at all, but\nmerely masks for plutocracy, under which the rich were the real though\nirresponsible rulers! You will readily see that they could have been\nnothing else. The masses from the beginning of the world had been the\nsubjects and servants of the rich, but the kings had been above the rich,\nand constituted a check on their dominion. The overthrow of the kings\nleft no check at all on the power of the rich, which became supreme. The\npeople, indeed, nominally were sovereigns; but as these sovereigns were\nindividually and as a class the economic serfs of the rich, and lived\nat their mercy, the so-called popular government became the mere\nstalking-horse of the capitalists.\n\n\"Regarded as necessary steps in the evolution of society from pure\nmonarchy to pure democracy, these republics of the negative phase mark a\nstage of progress; but if regarded as finalities they were a type far\nless admirable on the whole than decent monarchies. In respect especially\nto their susceptibility to corruption and plutocratic subversion they\nwere the worst kind of government possible. The nineteenth century,\nduring which this crop of pseudo-democracies ripened for the sickle of\nthe great Revolution, seems to the modern view nothing but a dreary\ninterregnum of nondescript, _faineant_ government intervening\nbetween the decadence of virile monarchy in the eighteenth century and\nthe rise of positive democracy in the twentieth. The period may be\ncompared to that of the minority of a king, during which the royal power\nis abused by wicked stewards. The people had been proclaimed as\nsovereign, but they had not yet assumed the sceptre.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said I, \"during the latter part of the nineteenth century,\nwhen, as you say, the world had not yet seen a single specimen of popular\ngovernment, our wise men were telling us that the democratic system had\nbeen fully tested and was ready to be judged on its results. Not a few of\nthem, indeed, went so far as to say that the democratic experiment had\nproved a failure when, in point of fact, it seems that no experiment in\ndemocracy, properly understood, had as yet ever been so much as\nattempted.\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"It is a very sympathetic task,\" he said, \"to explain the slowness of the\nmasses in feeling their way to a comprehension of all that the democratic\nidea meant for them, but it is one equally difficult and thankless to\naccount for the blank failure of the philosophers, historians, and\nstatesmen of your day to arrive at an intelligent estimate of the logical\ncontent of democracy and to forecast its outcome. Surely the very\nsmallness of the practical results thus far achieved by the democratic\nmovement as compared with the magnitude of its proposition and the forces\nbehind it ought to have suggested to them that its evolution was yet but\nin the first stage. How could intelligent men delude themselves with the\nnotion that the most portentous and revolutionary idea of all time had\nexhausted its influence and fulfilled its mission in changing the title\nof the executive of a nation from king to President, and the name of the\nnational Legislature from Parliament to Congress? If your pedagogues,\ncollege professors and presidents, and others who were responsible for\nyour education, had been worth their salt, you would have found nothing\nin the present order of economic equality that would in the least have\nsurprised you. You would have said at once that it was just what you had\nbeen taught must necessarily be the next phase in the inevitable\nevolution of the democratic idea.\"\n\nEdith beckoned from the door and we rose from our seat.\n\n\"The revolutionary party in the great Revolution,\" said the doctor, as we\nsauntered toward the house, \"carried on the work of agitation and\npropaganda under various names more or less grotesque and ill-fitting as\npolitical party names were apt to be, but the one word democracy, with\nits various equivalents and derivatives, more accurately and completely\nexpressed, explained, and justified their method, reason, and purpose\nthan a library of books could do. The American people fancied that they\nhad set up a popular government when they separated from England, but\nthey were deluded. In conquering the political power formerly exercised\nby the king, the people had but taken the outworks of the fortress of\ntyranny. The economic system which was the citadel and commanded every\npart of the social structure remained in possession of private and\nirresponsible rulers, and so long as it was so held, the possession of\nthe outworks was of no use to the people, and only retained by the\nsufferance of the garrison of the citadel. The Revolution came when the\npeople saw that they must either take the citadel or evacuate the\noutworks. They must either complete the work of establishing popular\ngovernment which had been barely begun by their fathers, or abandon all\nthat their fathers had accomplished.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nI ACQUIRE A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY.\n\nOn going into breakfast the ladies met us with a highly interesting piece\nof intelligence which they had found in the morning's news. It was, in\nfact, nothing less than an announcement of action taken by the United\nStates Congress in relation to myself. A resolution had, it appeared,\nbeen unanimously passed which, after reciting the facts of my\nextraordinary return to life, proceeded to clear up any conceivable\nquestion that might arise as to my legal status by declaring me an\nAmerican citizen in full standing and entitled to all a citizen's rights\nand immunities, but at the same time a guest of the nation, and as such\nfree of the duties and services incumbent upon citizens in general except\nas I might choose to assume them.\n\nSecluded as I had been hitherto in the Leete household, this was almost\nthe first intimation I had the public in my case. That interest, I was\nnow informed, had passed beyond my personality and was already producing\na general revival of the study of nineteenth-century literature and\npolitics, and especially of the history and philosophy of the transition\nperiod, when the old order passed into the new.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the doctor, \"the nation has only discharged a debt of\ngratitude in making you its guest, for you have already done more for our\neducational interests by promoting historical study than a regiment of\ninstructors could achieve in a lifetime.\"\n\nRecurring to the topic of the congressional resolution, the doctor said\nthat, in his opinion, it was superfluous, for though I had certainly\nslept on my rights as a citizen rather an extraordinary length of time,\nthere was no ground on which I could be argued to have forfeited any of\nthem. However that might be, seeing the resolution left no doubt as to my\nstatus, he suggested that the first thing we did after breakfast should\nbe to go down to the National Bank and open my citizen's account.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, as we left the house, \"I am glad to be relieved of\nthe necessity of being a pensioner on you any longer, but I confess I\nfeel a little cheap about accepting as a gift this generous provision of\nthe nation.\"\n\n\"My dear Julian,\" replied the doctor, \"it is sometimes a little difficult\nfor me to quite get your point of view of our institutions.\"\n\n\"I should think it ought to be easy enough in this case. I feel as if I\nwere an object of public charity.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the doctor, \"you feel that the nation has done you a favor,\nlaid you under an obligation. You must excuse my obtuseness, but the fact\nis we look at this matter of the economic provision for citizens from an\nentirely different standpoint. It seems to us that in claiming and\naccepting your citizen's maintenance you perform a civic duty,\nwhereby you put the nation--that is, the general body of your\nfellow-citizens--under rather more obligation than you incur.\"\n\nI turned to see if the doctor were not jesting, but he was evidently\nquite serious.\n\n\"I ought by this time to be used to finding that everything goes by\ncontraries in these days,\" I said, \"but really, by what inversion of\ncommon sense, as it was understood in the nineteenth century, do you make\nout that by accepting a pecuniary provision from the nation I oblige it\nmore than it obliges me?\"\n\n\"I think it will be easy to make you see that,\" replied the doctor,\n\"without requiring you to do any violence to the methods of reasoning to\nwhich your contemporaries were accustomed. You used to have, I believe, a\nsystem of gratuitous public education maintained by the state.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What was the idea of it?\"\n\n\"That a citizen was not a safe voter without education.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. The state therefore at great expense provided free\neducation for the people. It was greatly for the advantage of the citizen\nto accept this education just as it is for you to accept this provision,\nbut it was still more for the interest of the state that the citizen\nshould accept it. Do you see the point?\"\n\n\"I can see that it is the interest of the state that I should accept an\neducation, but not exactly why it is for the state's interest that I\nshould accept a share of the public wealth.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless it is the same reason, namely, the public interest in good\ngovernment. We hold it to be a self-evident principle that every one who\nexercises the suffrage should not only be educated, but should have a\nstake in the country, in order that self-interest may be identified with\npublic interest. As the power exercised by every citizen through the\nsuffrage is the same, the economic stake should be the same, and so you\nsee we come to the reason why the public safety requires that you should\nloyally accept your equal stake in the country quite apart from the\npersonal advantage you derive by doing so.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I said, \"that this idea of yours, that every one who votes\nshould have an economic stake in the country, is one which our rankest\nTories were very fond of insisting on, but the practical conclusion they\ndrew from it was diametrically opposed to that which you draw? They would\nhave agreed with you on the axiom that political power and economic stake\nin the country should go together, but the practical application they\nmade of it was negative instead of positive. You argue that because an\neconomic interest in the country should go with the suffrage, all who\nhave the suffrage should have that interest guaranteed them. They argued,\non the contrary, that from all who had not the economic stake the\nsuffrage should be taken away. There were not a few of my friends who\nmaintained that some such limitation of the suffrage was needed to save\nthe democratic experiment from failure.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" observed the doctor, \"it was proposed to save the\ndemocratic experiment by abandoning it. It was an ingenious thought, but\nit so happened that democracy was not an experiment which could be\nabandoned, but an evolution which must be fulfilled. In what a striking\nmanner does that talk of your contemporaries about limiting the suffrage\nto correspond with the economic position of citizens illustrate the\nfailure of even the most intelligent classes in your time to grasp the\nfull significance of the democratic faith which they professed! The\nprimal principle of democracy is the worth and dignity of the individual.\nThat dignity, consisting in the quality of human nature, is essentially\nthe same in all individuals, and therefore equality is the vital\nprinciple of democracy. To this intrinsic and equal dignity of the\nindividual all material conditions must be made subservient, and personal\naccidents and attributes subordinated. The raising up of the human being\nwithout respect of persons is the constant and only rational motive of\nthe democratic policy. Contrast with this conception that precious notion\nof your contemporaries as to restricting suffrage. Recognizing the\nmaterial disparities in the circumstances of individuals, they proposed\nto conform the rights and dignities of the individual to his material\ncircumstances instead of conforming the material circumstances to the\nessential and equal dignity of the man.\"\n\n\"In short,\" said I, \"while under our system we conformed men to things,\nyou think it more reasonable to conform things to men?\"\n\n\"That is, indeed,\" replied the doctor, \"the vital difference between the\nold and the new orders.\"\n\nWe walked in silence for some moments. Presently the doctor said: \"I was\ntrying to recall an expression you just used which suggested a wide\ndifference between the sense in which the same phrase was understood in\nyour day and now is. I was saying that we thought everybody who voted\nought to have a property stake in the country, and you observed that some\npeople had the same idea in your time, but according to our view of what\na stake in the country is no one had it or could have it under your\neconomic system.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I demanded. \"Did not men who owned property in a country--a\nmillionaire, for instance, like myself--have a stake in it?\"\n\n\"In the sense that his property was geographically located in the country\nit might be perhaps called a stake within the country but not a stake in\nthe country. It was the exclusive ownership of a piece of the country or\na portion of the wealth in the country, and all it prompted the owner to\nwas devotion to and care for that specific portion without regard to the\nrest. Such a separate stake or the ambition to obtain it, far from making\nits owner or seeker a citizen devoted to the common weal, was quite as\nlikely to make him a dangerous one, for his selfish interest was to\naggrandize his separate stake at the expense of his fellow-citizens and\nof the public interest. Your millionaires--with no personal reflection\nupon yourself, of course--appear to have been the most dangerous class of\ncitizens you had, and that is just what might be expected from their\nhaving what you called but what we should not call a stake in the\ncountry. Wealth owned in that way could only be a divisive and antisocial\ninfluence.\n\n\"What we mean by a stake in the country is something which nobody could\npossibly have until economic solidarity had replaced the private\nownership of capital. Every one, of course, has his own house and piece\nof land if he or she desires them, and always his or her own income to\nuse at pleasure; but these are allotments for use only, and, being always\nequal, can furnish no ground for dissension. The capital of the nation,\nthe source of all this consumption, is indivisibly held by all in common,\nand it is impossible that there should be any dispute on selfish grounds\nas to the administration of this common interest on which all private\ninterests depend, whatever differences of judgment there may be. The\ncitizen's share in this common fund is a sort of stake in the country\nthat makes it impossible to hurt another's interest without hurting one's\nown, or to help one's own interest without promoting equally all other\ninterests. As to its economic bearings it may be said that it makes the\nGolden Rule an automatic principle of government. What we would do for\nourselves we must of necessity do also for others. Until economic\nsolidarity made it possible to carry out in this sense the idea that\nevery citizen ought to have a stake in the country, the democratic system\nnever had a chance to develop its genius.\"\n\n\"It seems,\" I said, \"that your foundation principle of economic equality\nwhich I supposed was mainly suggested and intended in the interest of the\nmaterial well-being of the people, is quite as much a principle of\npolitical policy for safeguarding the stability and wise ordering of\ngovernment.\"\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" replied the doctor. \"Our economic system is a measure\nof statesmanship quite as much as of humanity. You see, the first\ncondition of efficiency or stability in any government is that the\ngoverning power should have a direct, constant, and supreme interest in\nthe general welfare--that is, in the prosperity of the whole state as\ndistinguished from any part of it. It had been the strong point of\nmonarchy that the king, for selfish reasons as proprietor of the country,\nfelt this interest. The autocratic form of government, solely on that\naccount, had always a certain rough sort of efficiency. It had been, on\nthe other hand, the fatal weakness of democracy, during its negative\nphase previous to the great Revolution, that the people, who were the\nrulers, had individually only an indirect and sentimental interest in the\nstate as a whole, or its machinery--their real, main, constant, and\ndirect interest being concentrated upon their personal fortunes, their\nprivate stakes, distinct from and adverse to the general stake. In\nmoments of enthusiasm they might rally to the support of the\ncommonwealth, but for the most part that had no custodian, but was at the\nmercy of designing men and factions who sought to plunder the\ncommonwealth and use the machinery of government for personal or class\nends. This was the structural weakness of democracies, by the effect of\nwhich, after passing their first youth, they became invariably, as the\ninequality of wealth developed, the most corrupt and worthless of all\nforms of government and the most susceptible to misuse and perversion for\nselfish, personal, and class purposes. It was a weakness incurable so\nlong as the capital of the country, its economic interests, remained in\nprivate hands, and one that could be remedied only by the radical\nabolition of private capitalism and the unification of the nation's\ncapital under collective control. This done, the same economic\nmotive--which, while the capital remained in private hands, was a\ndivisive influence tending to destroy that public spirit which is the\nbreath of life in a democracy--became the most powerful of cohesive\nforces, making popular government not only ideally the most just but\npractically the most successful and efficient of political systems. The\ncitizen, who before had been the champion of a part against the rest,\nbecame by this change a guardian of the whole.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA TWENTIETH-CENTURY BANK PARLOR.\n\nThe formalities at the bank proved to be very simple. Dr. Leete\nintroduced me to the superintendent, and the rest followed as a matter of\ncourse, the whole process not taking three minutes. I was informed that\nthe annual credit of the adult citizen for that year was $4,000, and that\nthe portion due me for the remainder of the year, it being the latter\npart of September, was $1,075.41. Taking vouchers to the amount of $300,\nI left the rest on deposit precisely as I should have done at one of the\nnineteenth-century banks in drawing money for present use. The\ntransaction concluded, Mr. Chapin, the superintendent, invited me into\nhis office.\n\n\"How does our banking system strike you as compared with that of your\nday?\" he asked.\n\n\"It has one manifest advantage from the point of view of a penniless\n_revenant_ like myself,\" I said--\"namely, that one receives a credit\nwithout having made a deposit; otherwise I scarcely know enough of it to\ngive an opinion.\"\n\n\"When you come to be more familiar with our banking methods,\" said the\nsuperintendent. \"I think you will be struck with their similarity to your\nown. Of course, we have no money and nothing answering to money, but the\nwhole science of banking from its inception was preparing the way for the\nabolition of money. The only way, really, in which our system differs\nfrom yours is that every one starts the year with the same balance to his\ncredit and that this credit is not transferable. As to requiring deposits\nbefore accounts are opened, we are necessarily quite as strict as your\nbankers were, only in our case the people, collectively, make the deposit\nfor all at once. This collective deposit is made up of such provisions of\ndifferent commodities and such installations for the various public\nservices as are expected to be necessary. Prices or cost estimates are\nput on these commodities and services, and the aggregate sum of the\nprices being divided by the population gives the amount of the citizen's\npersonal credit, which is simply his aliquot share of the commodities and\nservices available for the year. No doubt, however, Dr. Leete has told\nyou all about this.\"\n\n\"But I was not here to be included in the estimate of the year,\" I said.\n\"I hope that my credit is not taken out of other people's.\"\n\n\"You need feel no concern,\" replied the superintendent. \"While it is\nastonishing how variations in demand balance one another when great\npopulations are concerned, yet it would be impossible to conduct so big a\nbusiness as ours without large margins. It is the aim in the production\nof perishable things, and those in which fancy often changes, to keep as\nlittle ahead of the demand as possible, but in all the important staples\nsuch great surpluses are constantly carried that a two years' drought\nwould not affect the price of non-perishable produce, while an unexpected\naddition of several millions to the population could be taken care of at\nany time without disturbance.\"\n\n\"Dr. Leete has told me,\" I said, \"that any part of the credit not used by\na citizen during the year is canceled, not being good for the next year.\nI suppose that is to prevent the possibility of hoarding, by which the\nequality of your economic condition might be undermined.\"\n\n\"It would have the effect to prevent such hoarding, certainly,\" said the\nsuperintendent, \"but it is otherwise needful to simplify the national\nbookkeeping and prevent confusion. The annual credit is an order on a\nspecific provision available during a certain year. For the next year a\nnew calculation with somewhat different elements has to be made, and to\nmake it the books must be balanced and all orders canceled that have not\nbeen presented, so that we may know just where we stand.\"\n\n\"What, on the other hand, will happen if I run through my credit before\nthe year is out?\"\n\nThe superintendent smiled. \"I have read,\" he said, \"that the spendthrift\nevil was quite a serious one in your day. Our system has the advantage\nover yours that the most incorrigible spendthrift can not trench on his\nprincipal, which consists in his indivisible equal share in the capital\nof the nation. All he can at most do is to waste the annual dividend.\nShould you do this, I have no doubt your friends will take care of you,\nand if they do not you may be sure the nation will, for we have not the\nstrong stomachs that enabled our forefathers to enjoy plenty with hungry\npeople about them. The fact is, we are so squeamish that the knowledge\nthat a single individual in the nation was in want would keep us all\nawake nights. If you insisted on being in need, you would have to hide\naway for the purpose.\n\n\"Have you any idea,\" I asked, \"how much this credit of $4,000 would have\nbeen equal to in purchasing power in 1887?\"\n\n\"Somewhere about $6,000 or $7,000, I should say,\" replied Mr. Chapin. \"In\nestimating the economic position of the citizen you must consider that a\ngreat variety of services and commodities are now supplied gratuitously\non public account, which formerly individuals had to pay for, as, for\nexample, water, light, music, news, the theatre and opera, all sorts of\npostal and electrical communications, transportation, and other things\ntoo numerous to detail.\"\n\n\"Since you furnish so much on public or common account, why not furnish\neverything in that way? It would simplify matters, I should say.\"\n\n\"We think, on the contrary, that it would complicate the administration,\nand certainly it would not suit the people as well. You see, while we\ninsist on equality we detest uniformity, and seek to provide free play to\nthe greatest possible variety of tastes in our expenditure.\"\n\nThinking I might be interested in looking them over, the superintendent\nhad brought into the office some of the books of the bank. Without having\nbeen at all expert in nineteenth-century methods of bookkeeping, I was\nmuch impressed with the extreme simplicity of these accounts compared\nwith any I had been familiar with. Speaking of this, I added that it\nimpressed me the more, as I had received an impression that, great as\nwere the superiorities of the national co-operative system over our way\nof doing business, it must involve a great increase in the amount of\nbookkeeping as compared with what was necessary under the old system. The\nsuperintendent and Dr. Leete looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. West,\" said the former, \"it strikes us as very odd that\nyou should have that idea? We estimate that under our system one\naccountant serves where dozens were needed in your day.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"the nation has now a separate account with or for every\nman, woman, and child in the country.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the superintendent, \"but did it not have the same in\nyour day? How else could it have assessed and collected taxes or exacted\na dozen other duties from citizens? For example, your tax system alone\nwith its inquisitions, appraisements, machinery of collection and\npenalties was vastly more complex than the accounts in these books before\nyou, which consist, as you see, in giving to every person the same credit\nat the beginning of the year, and afterward simply recording the\nwithdrawals without calculations of interest or other incidents whatever.\nIn fact, Mr. West, so simple and invariable are the conditions that the\naccounts are kept automatically by a machine, the accountant merely\nplaying on a keyboard.\"\n\n\"But I understand that every citizen has a record kept also of his\nservices as the basis of grading and regrading.\"\n\n\"Certainly, and a most minute one, with most careful guards against error\nor unfairness. But it is a record having none of the complications of one\nof your money or wages accounts for work done, but is rather like the\nsimple honor records of your educational institutions by which the\nranking of the students was determined.\"\n\n\"But the citizen also has relations with the public stores from which he\nsupplies his needs?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but not a relation of account. As your people would have\nsaid, all purchases are for cash only--that is, on the credit card.\"\n\n\"There remains,\" I persisted, \"the accounting for goods and services\nbetween the stores and the productive departments and between the several\ndepartments.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but the whole system being under one head and all the parts\nworking together with no friction and no motive for any indirection, such\naccounting is child's work compared with the adjustment of dealings\nbetween the mutually suspicious private capitalists, who divided among\nthemselves the field of business in your day, and sat up nights devising\ntricks to deceive, defeat, and overreach one another.\"\n\n\"But how about the elaborate statistics on which you base the\ncalculations that guide production? There at least is need of a good deal\nof figuring.\"\n\n\"Your national and State governments,\" replied Mr. Chapin, \"published\nannually great masses of similar statistics, which, while often very\ninaccurate, must have cost far more trouble to accumulate, seeing that\nthey involved an unwelcome inquisition into the affairs of private\npersons instead of a mere collection of reports from the books of\ndifferent departments of one great business. Forecasts of probable\nconsumption every manufacturer, merchant, and storekeeper had to make in\nyour day, and mistakes meant ruin. Nevertheless, he could but guess,\nbecause he had no sufficient data. Given the complete data that we have,\nand a forecast is as much increased in certainty as it is simplified in\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"Kindly spare me any further demonstration of the stupidity of my\ncriticism.\"\n\n\"Dear me, Mr. West, there is no question of stupidity. A wholly new\nsystem of things always impresses the mind at first sight with an effect\nof complexity, although it may be found on examination to be simplicity\nitself. But please do not stop me just yet, for I have told you only one\nside of the matter. I have shown you how few and simple are the accounts\nwe keep compared with those in corresponding relations kept by you; but\nthe biggest part of the subject is the accounts you had to keep which we\ndo not keep at all. Debit and credit are no longer known; interest,\nrents, profits, and all the calculations based on them no more have any\nplace in human affairs. In your day everybody, besides his account with\nthe state, was involved in a network of accounts with all about him. Even\nthe humblest wage-earner was on the books of half a dozen tradesmen,\nwhile a man of substance might be down in scores or hundreds, and this\nwithout speaking of men not engaged in commerce. A fairly nimble dollar\nhad to be set down so many times in so many places, as it went from hand\nto hand, that we calculate in about five years it must have cost itself\nin ink, paper, pens, and clerk hire, let alone fret and worry. All these\nforms of private and business accounts have now been done away with.\nNobody owes anybody, or is owed by anybody, or has any contract with\nanybody, or any account of any sort with anybody, but is simply beholden\nto everybody for such kindly regard as his virtues may attract.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nI EXPERIENCE A NEW SENSATION.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said I as we came out of the bank, \"I have a most extraordinary\nfeeling.\"\n\n\"What sort of a feeling?\"\n\n\"It is a sensation which I never had anything like before,\" I said, \"and\nnever expected to have. I feel as if I wanted to go to work. Yes, Julian\nWest, millionaire, loafer by profession, who never did anything useful in\nhis life and never wanted to, finds himself seized with an overmastering\ndesire to roll up his sleeves and do something toward rendering an\nequivalent for his living.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"Congress has declared you the guest of the\nnation, and expressly exempted you from the duty of rendering any sort of\npublic service.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, and I take it kindly, but I begin to feel that I\nshould not enjoy knowing that I was living on other people.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose it is,\" said the doctor, smiling, \"that has given\nyou this sensitiveness about living on others which, as you say, you\nnever felt before?\"\n\n\"I have never been much given to self-analysis,\" I replied, \"but the\nchange of feeling is very easily explained in this case. I find myself\nsurrounded by a community every member of which not physically\ndisqualified is doing his or her own part toward providing the material\nprosperity which I share. A person must be of remarkably tough\nsensibilities who would not feel ashamed under such circumstances if he\ndid not take hold with the rest and do his part. Why didn't I feel that\nway about the duty of working in the nineteenth century? Why, simply\nbecause there was no such system then for sharing work, or indeed any\nsystem at all. For the reason that there was no fair play or suggestion\nof justice in the distribution of work, everybody shirked it who could,\nand those who could not shirk it cursed the luckier ones and got even by\ndoing as bad work as they could. Suppose a rich young fellow like myself\nhad a feeling that he would like to do his part. How was he going to go\nabout it? There was absolutely no social organization by which labor\ncould be shared on any principle of justice. There was no possibility of\nco-operation. We had to choose between taking advantage of the economic\nsystem to live on other people or have them take advantage of it to live\non us. We had to climb on their backs as the only way of preventing them\nfrom climbing on our backs. We had the alternative of profiting by an\nunjust system or being its victims. There being no more moral\nsatisfaction in the one alternative than the other, we naturally\npreferred the first. By glimpses all the more decent of us realized the\nineffable meanness of sponging our living out of the toilers, but our\nconsciences were completely bedeviled by an economic system which seemed\na hopeless muddle that nobody could see through or set right or do right\nunder. I will undertake to say that there was not a man of my set,\ncertainly not of my friends, who, placed just as I am this morning in\npresence of an absolutely simple, just, and equal system for distributing\nthe industrial burden, would not feel just as I do the impulse to roll up\nhis sleeves and take hold.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of it,\" said the doctor. \"Your experience strikingly\nconfirms the chapter of revolutionary history which tells us that when\nthe present economic order was established those who had been under the\nold system the most irreclaimable loafers and vagabonds, responding to\nthe absolute justice and fairness of the new arrangements, rallied to the\nservice of the state with enthusiasm. But talking of what you are to do,\nwhy was not my former suggestion a good one, that you should tell our\npeople in lectures about the nineteenth century?\"\n\n\"I thought at first that it would be a good idea,\" I replied, \"but our\ntalk in the garden this morning has about convinced me that the very last\npeople who had any intelligent idea of the nineteenth century, what it\nmeant, and what it was leading to, were just myself and my contemporaries\nof that time. After I have been with you a few years I may learn enough\nabout my own period to discuss it intelligently.\"\n\n\"There is something in that,\" replied the doctor. \"Meanwhile, you see\nthat great building with the dome just across the square? That is our\nlocal Industrial Exchange. Perhaps, seeing that we are talking of what\nyou are to do to make yourself useful, you may be interested in learning\na little of the method by which our people choose their occupations.\"\n\nI readily assented, and we crossed the square to the exchange.\n\n\"I have given you thus far,\" said the doctor, \"only a general outline of\nour system of universal industrial service. You know that every one of\neither sex, unless for some reason temporarily or permanently exempt,\nenters the public industrial service in the twenty-first year, and after\nthree years of a sort of general apprenticeship in the unclassified\ngrades elects a special occupation, unless he prefers to study further\nfor one of the scientific professions. As there are a million youth, more\nor less, who thus annually elect their occupations, you may imagine that\nit must be a complex task to find a place for each in which his or her\nown taste shall be suited as well as the needs of the public service.\"\n\nI assured the doctor that I had indeed made this reflection.\n\n\"A very few moments will suffice,\" he said, \"to disabuse your mind of\nthat notion and to show you how wonderfully a little rational system has\nsimplified the task of finding a fitting vocation in life which used to\nbe so difficult a matter in your day and so rarely was accomplished in a\nsatisfactory manner.\"\n\nFinding a comfortable corner for us near one of the windows of the\ncentral hall, the doctor presently brought a lot of sample blanks and\nschedules and proceeded to explain them to me. First he showed me the\nannual statement of exigencies by the General Government, specifying in\nwhat proportion the force of workers that was to become available that\nyear ought to be distributed among the several occupations in order to\ncarry on the industrial service. That was the side of the subject which\nrepresented the necessities of the public service that must be met. Next\nhe showed me the volunteering or preference blank, on which every youth\nthat year graduating from the unclassified service indicated, if he chose\nto, the order of his preference as to the various occupations making up\nthe public service, it being inferred, if he did not fill out the blank,\nthat he or she was willing to be assigned for the convenience of the\nservice.\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"locality of residence is often quite as important as the\nkind of one's occupation. For example, one might not wish to be separated\nfrom parents, and certainly would not wish to be from a sweetheart,\nhowever agreeable the occupation assigned might be in other respects.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the doctor. \"If, indeed, our industrial system\nundertook to separate lovers and friends, husbands and wives, parents and\nchildren, without regard to their wishes, it certainly would not last\nlong. You see this column of localities. If you make your cross against\nBoston in that column, it becomes imperative upon the administration to\nprovide you employment somewhere in this district. It is one of the\nrights of every citizen to demand employment within his home district.\nOtherwise, as you say, ties of love and friendship might be rudely\nbroken. But, of course, one can not have his cake and eat it too; if you\nmake work in the home district imperative, you may have to take an\noccupation to which you would have preferred some other that might have\nbeen open to you had you been willing to leave home. However, it is not\ncommon that one needs to sacrifice a chosen career to the ties of\naffection. The country is divided into industrial districts or circles,\nin each of which there is intended to be as nearly as possible a complete\nsystem of industry, wherein all the important arts and occupations are\nrepresented. It is in this way made possible for most of us to find an\nopportunity in a chosen occupation without separation from friends. This\nis the more simply done, as the modern means of communication have so far\nabolished distance that the man who lives in Boston and works in\nSpringfield, one hundred miles away, is quite as near his place of\nbusiness as was the average workingman of your day. One who, living in\nBoston, should work two hundred miles away (in Albany), would be far\nbetter situated than the average suburbanite doing business in Boston a\ncentury ago. But while a great number desire to find occupations at home,\nthere are also many who from love of change much prefer to leave the\nscenes of their childhood. These, too, indicate their preferences by\nmarking the number of the district to which they prefer to be assigned.\nSecond or third preferences may likewise be indicated, so that it would\ngo hard indeed if one could not obtain a location in at least the part of\nthe country he desired, though the locality preference is imperative only\nwhen the person desires to stay in the home district. Otherwise it is\nconsulted so far as consistent with conflicting claims. The volunteer\nhaving thus filled out his preference blank, takes it to the proper\nregistrar and has his ranking officially stamped upon it.\"\n\n\"What is the ranking?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is the figure which indicates his previous standing in the schools\nand during his service as an unclassified worker, and is supposed to give\nthe best attainable criterion thus far of his relative intelligence,\nefficiency, and devotion to duty. Where there are more volunteers for\nparticular occupations than there is room for, the lowest in ranking have\nto be content with a second or third preference. The preference blanks\nare finally handed in at the local exchange, and are collated at the\ncentral office of the industrial district. All who have made home work\nimperative are first provided for in accordance with rank. The blanks of\nthose preferring work in other districts are forwarded to the national\nbureau and there collated with those from other districts, so that the\nvolunteers may be provided for as nearly as may be according to their\nwishes, subject, where conflict of claim arises, to their relative\nranking right. It has always been observed that the personal\neccentricities of individuals in great bodies have a wonderful tendency\nto balance and mutually complement one another, and this principle is\nstrikingly illustrated in our system of choice of occupation and\nlocality. The preference blanks are filled out in June, and by the first\nof August everybody knows just where he or she is to report for service\nin October.\n\n\"However, if any one has received an assignment which is decidedly\nunwelcome either as to location or occupation, it is not even then, or\nindeed at any time, too late to endeavor to find another. The\nadministration has done its best to adjust the individual aptitude and\nwishes of each worker to the needs of the public service, but its\nmachinery is at his service for any further attempts he may wish to make\nto suit himself better.\"\n\nAnd then the doctor took me to the Transfer Department and showed me how\npersons who were dissatisfied either with their assignment of occupation\nor locality could put themselves in communication with all others in any\npart of the country who were similarly dissatisfied, and arrange, subject\nto liberal regulations, such exchanges as might be mutually agreeable.\n\n\"If a person is not absolutely unwilling to do anything at all,\" he said,\n\"and does not object to all parts of the country equally, he ought to be\nable sooner or later to provide himself both with pretty nearly the\noccupation and locality he desires. And if, after all, there should be\nany one so dull that he can not hope to succeed in his occupation or make\na better exchange with another, yet there is no occupation now tolerated\nby the state which would not have been as to its conditions a godsend to\nthe most fortunately situated workman of your day. There is none in which\nperil to life or health is not reduced to a minimum, and the dignity and\nrights of the worker absolutely guaranteed. It is a constant study of the\nadministration so to bait the less attractive occupations with special\nadvantages as to leisure and otherwise always to keep the balance of\npreference between them as nearly true as possible; and if, finally,\nthere were any occupation which, after all, remained so distasteful as to\nattract no volunteers, and yet was necessary, its duties would be\nperformed by all in rotation.\"\n\n\"As, for example,\" I said, \"the work of repairing and cleansing the\nsewers.\"\n\n\"If that sort of work were as offensive as it must have been in your day,\nI dare say it might have to be done by a rotation in which all would take\ntheir turn,\" replied the doctor, \"but our sewers are as clean as our\nstreets. They convey only water which has been chemically purified and\ndeodorized before it enters them by an apparatus connected with every\ndwelling. By the same apparatus all solid sewage is electrically\ncremated, and removed in the form of ashes. This improvement in the sewer\nsystem, which followed the great Revolution very closely, might have\nwaited a hundred years before introduction but for the Revolution,\nalthough the necessary scientific knowledge and appliances had long been\navailable. The case furnishes merely one instance out of a thousand of\nthe devices for avoiding repulsive and perilous sorts of work which,\nwhile simple enough, the world would never have troubled itself to adopt\nso long as the rich had in the poor a race of uncomplaining economic\nserfs on which to lay all their burdens. The effect of economic equality\nwas to make it equally the interest of all to avoid, so far as possible,\nthe more unpleasant tasks, since henceforth they must be shared by all.\nIn this way, wholly apart from the moral aspects of the matter, the\nprogress of chemical, sanitary, and mechanical science owes an\nincalculable debt to the Revolution.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" I said, \"you have sometimes eccentric persons--'crooked\nsticks' we used to call them--who refuse to adapt themselves to the\nsocial order on any terms or admit any such thing as social duty. If such\na person should flatly refuse to render any sort of industrial or useful\nservice on any terms, what would be done with him? No doubt there is a\ncompulsory side to your system for dealing with such persons?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the doctor. \"If our system can not stand on its\nmerits as the best possible arrangement for promoting the highest welfare\nof all, let it fall. As to the matter of industrial service, the law is\nsimply that if any one shall refuse to do his or her part toward the\nmaintenance of the social order he shall not be allowed to partake of its\nbenefits. It would obviously not be fair to the rest that he should do\nso. But as to compelling him to work against his will by force, such an\nidea would be abhorrent to our people. The service of society is, above\nall, a service of honor, and all its associations are what you used to\ncall chivalrous. Even as in your day soldiers would not serve with\nskulkers, but drummed cowards out of the camp, so would our workers\nrefuse the companionship of persons openly seeking to evade their civic\nduty.\"\n\n\"But what do you do with such persons?\"\n\n\"If an adult, being neither criminal nor insane, should deliberately and\nfixedly refuse to render his quota of service in any way, either in a\nchosen occupation or, on failure to choose, in an assigned one, he would\nbe furnished with such a collection of seeds and tools as he might choose\nand turned loose on a reservation expressly prepared for such persons,\ncorresponding a little perhaps with the reservations set apart for such\nIndians in your day as were unwilling to accept civilization. There he\nwould be left to work out a better solution of the problem of existence\nthan our society offers, if he could do so. We think we have the best\npossible social system, but if there is a better we want to know it, so\nthat we may adopt it. We encourage the spirit of experiment.\"\n\n\"And are there really cases,\" I said, \"of individuals who thus\nvoluntarily abandon society in preference to fulfilling their social\nduty?\"\n\n\"There have been such cases, though I do not know that there are any at\nthe present time. But the provision for them exists.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nHONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.\n\nWhen we reached the house the doctor said:\n\n\"I am going to leave you to Edith this morning. The fact is, my duties as\nmentor, while extremely to my taste, are not quite a sinecure. The\nquestions raised in our talks frequently suggest the necessity of\nrefreshing my general knowledge of the contrasts between your day and\nthis by looking up the historical authorities. The conversation this\nmorning has indicated lines of research which will keep me busy in the\nlibrary the rest of the day.\"\n\nI found Edith in the garden, and received her congratulations upon my\nfully fledged citizenship. She did not seem at all surprised on learning\nmy intention promptly to find a place in the industrial service.\n\n\"Of course you will want to enter the service as soon as you can,\" she\nsaid. \"I knew you would. It is the only way to get in touch with the\npeople and feel really one of the nation. It is the great event we all\nlook forward to from childhood.\"\n\n\"Talking of industrial service,\" I said, \"reminds me of a question it has\na dozen times occurred to me to ask you. I understand that everyone who\nis able to do so, women as well as men, serves the nation from twenty-one\nto forty-five years of age in some useful occupation; but so far as I\nhave seen, although you are the picture of health and vigor, you have no\nemployment, but are quite like young ladies of elegant leisure in my day,\nwho spent their time sitting in the parlor and looking handsome. Of\ncourse, it is highly agreeable to me that you should be so free, but how,\nexactly, is so much leisure on your part squared with the universal\nobligation of service?\"\n\nEdith was greatly amused. \"And so you thought I was shirking? Had it not\noccurred to you that there might probably be such things as vacations or\nfurloughs in the industrial service, and that the rather unusual and\ninteresting guest in our household might furnish a natural occasion for\nme to take an outing if I could get it?\"\n\n\"And can you take your vacation when you please?\"\n\n\"We can take a portion of it when we please, always subject, of course,\nto the needs of the service.\"\n\n\"But what do you do when you are at work--teach school, paint china, keep\nbooks for the Government, stand behind a counter in the public stores, or\noperate a typewriter or telegraph wire?\"\n\n\"Does that list exhaust the number of women's occupations in your day?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; those were only some of their lighter and pleasanter\noccupations. Women were also the scrubbers, the washers, the servants of\nall work. The most repulsive and humiliating kinds of drudgery were put\noff upon the women of the poorer class; but I suppose, of course, you do\nnot do any such work.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that I do my part of whatever unpleasant things there\nare to do, and so does every one in the nation; but, indeed, we have long\nago arranged affairs so that there is very little such work to do. But,\ntell me, were there no women in your day who were machinists, farmers,\nengineers, carpenters, iron workers, builders, engine drivers, or members\nof the other great crafts?\"\n\n\"There were no women in such occupations. They were followed by men\nonly.\"\n\n\"I suppose I knew that,\" she said; \"I have read as much; but it is\nstrange to talk with a man of the nineteenth century who is so much like\na man of to-day and realize that the women were so different as to seem\nlike another order of beings.\"\n\n\"But, really,\" said I, \"I don't understand how in these respects the\nwomen can do very differently now unless they are physically much\nstronger. Most of these occupations you have just mentioned were too\nheavy for their strength, and for that reason, largely, were limited to\nmen, as I should suppose they must still be.\"\n\n\"There is not a trade or occupation in the whole list,\" replied Edith,\n\"in which women do not take part. It is partly because we are physically\nmuch more vigorous than the poor creatures of your time that we do the\nsorts of work that were too heavy for them, but it is still more an\naccount of the perfection of machinery. As we have grown stronger, all\nsorts of work have grown lighter. Almost no heavy work is done directly\nnow; machines do all, and we only need to guide them, and the lighter the\nhand that guides, the better the work done. So you see that nowadays\nphysical qualities have much less to do than mental with the choice of\noccupations. The mind is constantly getting nearer to the work, and\nfather says some day we may be able to work by sheer will power directly\nand have no need of hands at all. It is said that there are actually more\nwomen than men in great machine works. My mother was first lieutenant in\na great iron works. Some have a theory that the sense of power which one\nhas in controlling giant engines appeals to women's sensibilities even\nmore than to men's. But really it is not quite fair to make you guess\nwhat my occupation is, for I have not fully decided on it.\"\n\n\"But you said you were already at work.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, but you know that before we choose our life occupation we are\nthree years in the unclassified or miscellaneous class of workers. I am\nin my second year in that class.\"\n\n\"What do you do?\"\n\n\"A little of everything and nothing long. The idea is to give us during\nthat period a little practical experience in all the main departments of\nwork, so that we may know better how and what to choose as an occupation.\nWe are supposed to have got through with the schools before we enter this\nclass, but really I have learned more since I have been at work than in\ntwice the time spent in school. You can not imagine how perfectly\ndelightful this grade of work is. I don't wonder some people prefer to\nstay in it all their lives for the sake of the constant change in tasks,\nrather than elect a regular occupation. Just now I am among the\nagricultural workers on the great farm near Lexington. It is delightful,\nand I have about made up my mind to choose farm work as an occupation.\nThat is what I had in mind when I asked you to guess my trade. Do you\nthink you would ever have guessed that?\"\n\n\"I don't think I ever should, and unless the conditions of farm work have\ngreatly changed since my day I can not imagine how you could manage it in\na woman's costume.\"\n\nEdith regarded me for a moment with an expression of simple surprise, her\neyes growing large. Then her glance fell to her dress, and when she again\nlooked up her expression had changed to one which was at once meditative,\nhumorous, and wholly inscrutable. Presently she said:\n\n\"Have you not observed, my dear Julian, that the dress of the women you\nsee on the streets is different from that which women wore in the\nnineteenth century?\"\n\n\"I have noticed, of course, that they generally wear no skirts, but you\nand your mother dress as women did in my day.\"\n\n\"And has it not occurred to you to wonder why our dress was not like\ntheirs--why we wear skirts and they do not?\"\n\n\"Possibly that has occurred to me among the thousand other questions that\nevery day arise in my mind, only to be driven out by a thousand others\nbefore I can ask them; but I think in this case I should have rather\nwondered why these other women did not dress as you do instead of why you\ndid not dress as they do, for your costume, being the one I was\naccustomed to, naturally struck me as the normal type, and this other\nstyle as a variation for some special or local reason which I should\nlater learn about. You must not think me altogether stupid. To tell the\ntruth, these other women have as yet scarcely impressed me as being very\nreal. You were at first the only person about whose reality I felt\nentirely sure. All the others seemed merely parts of a fantastic farrago\nof wonders, more or less possible, which is only just beginning to become\nintelligible and coherent. In time I should doubtless have awakened to\nthe fact that there were other women in the world besides yourself and\nbegun to make inquiries about them.\"\n\nAs I spoke of the absoluteness with which I had depended on her during\nthose first bewildering days for the assurance even of my own identity\nthe quick tears rushed to my companion's eyes, and--well, for a space the\nother women were more completely forgotten than ever.\n\nPresently she said: \"What were we talking about? Oh, yes,\nI remember--about those other women. I have a confession to make. I have\nbeen guilty toward you all this time of a sort of fraud, or at least of a\nflagrant suppression of the truth, which ought not to be kept up a moment\nlonger. I sincerely hope you will forgive me, in consideration of my\nmotive, and not----\"\n\n\"Not what?\"\n\n\"Not be too much startled.\"\n\n\"You make me very curious,\" I said. \"What is this mystery? I think I can\nstand the disclosure.\"\n\n\"Listen, then,\" she said. \"That wonderful night when we saw you first, of\ncourse our great thought was to avoid agitating you when you should\nrecover full consciousness by any more evidence of the amazing things\nthat had happened since your day than it was necessary you should see. We\nknew that in your time the use of long skirts by women was universal, and\nwe reflected that to see mother and me in the modern dress would no doubt\nstrike you very strangely. Now, you see, although skirtless costumes are\nthe general--indeed, almost universal--wear for most occasions, all\npossible costumes, ancient and modern, of all races, ages, and\ncivilizations, are either provided or to be obtained on the shortest\npossible notice at the stores. It was therefore very easy for us to\nfurnish ourselves with the old-style dress before father introduced you\nto us. He said people had in your day such strange ideas of feminine\nmodesty and propriety that it would be the best way to do. Can you\nforgive us, Julian, for taking such an advantage of your ignorance?\"\n\n\"Edith,\" I said, \"there were a great many institutions of the nineteenth\ncentury which we tolerated because we did not know how to get rid of\nthem, without, however, having a bit better opinion of them than you\nhave, and one of them was the costume by means of which our women used to\ndisguise and cripple themselves.\"\n\n\"I am delighted!\" exclaimed Edith. \"I perfectly detest these horrible\nbags, and will not wear them a moment longer!\" And bidding me wait where\nI was, she ran into the house.\n\nFive minutes, perhaps, I waited there in the arbor, where we had been\nsitting, and then, at a light step on the grass, looked up to see Edith\nwith eyes of smiling challenge standing before me in modern dress. I have\nseen her in a hundred varieties of that costume since then, and have\ngrown familiar with the exhaustless diversity of its adaptations, but I\ndefy the imagination of the greatest artist to devise a scheme of color\nand fabric that would again produce upon me the effect of enchanting\nsurprise which I received from that quite simple and hasty toilet.\n\nI don't know how long I stood looking at her without a thought of words,\nmy eyes meanwhile no doubt testifying eloquently enough how adorable I\nfound her. She seemed, however, to divine more than that in my\nexpression, for presently she exclaimed:\n\n\"I would give anything to know what you are thinking down in the bottom\nof your mind! It must be something awfully funny. What are you turning so\nred for?\"\n\n\"I am blushing for myself,\" I said, and that is all I would tell her,\nmuch as she teased me. Now, at this distance of time I may tell the\ntruth. My first sentiment, apart from overwhelming admiration, had been a\nslight astonishment at her absolute ease and composure of bearing under\nmy gaze. This is a confession that may well seem incomprehensible to\ntwentieth-century readers, and God forbid that they should ever catch the\npoint of view which would enable them to understand it better! A woman of\nmy day, unless professionally accustomed to use this sort of costume,\nwould have seemed embarrassed and ill at ease, at least for a time, under\na gaze so intent as mine, even though it were a brother's or a father's.\nI, it seems, had been prepared for at least some slight appearance of\ndiscomposure on Edith's part, and was consciously surprised at a manner\nwhich simply expressed an ingenuous gratification at my admiration. I\nrefer to this momentary experience because it has always seemed to me to\nillustrate in a particularly vivid way the change that has taken place\nnot only in the customs but in the mental attitude of the sexes as to\neach other since my former life. In justice to myself I must hasten to\nadd that this first feeling of surprise vanished even as it arose, in a\nmoment, between two heart-beats. I caught from her clear, serene eyes the\nview point of the modern man as to woman, never again to lose it. Then it\nwas that I flushed red with shame for myself. Wild horses could not have\ndragged from me the secret of that blush at the time, though I have told\nher long ago.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" I said, and I was thinking so, too, \"that we ought to\nbe greatly obliged to twentieth-century women for revealing for the first\ntime the artistic possibilities of the masculine dress.\"\n\n\"The masculine dress,\" she repeated, as if not quite comprehending my\nmeaning. \"Do you mean my dress?\"\n\n\"Why, yes; it is a man's dress I suppose, is it not?\"\n\n\"Why any more than a woman's?\" she answered rather blankly. \"Ah, yes, I\nactually forgot for a moment whom I was talking to. I see; so it was\nconsidered a man's dress in your day, when the women masqueraded as\nmermaids. You may think me stupid not to catch your idea more quickly,\nbut I told you I was dull at history. It is now two full generations\nsince women as well as men have worn this dress, and the idea of\nassociating it with men more than women would occur to no one but a\nprofessor of history. It strikes us merely as the only natural and\nconvenient solution of the dress necessity, which is essentially the same\nfor both sexes, since their bodily conformation is on the same general\nlines.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nA STRING OF SURPRISES.\n\nThe extremely delicate tints of Edith's costume led me to remark that the\ncolor effects of the modern dress seemed to be in general very light as\ncompared with those which prevailed in my day.\n\n\"The result,\" I said, \"is extremely pleasing, but if you will excuse a\nrather prosaic suggestion, it occurs to me that with the whole nation\ngiven over to wearing these delicate schemes of color, the accounts for\nwashing must be pretty large. I should suppose they would swamp the\nnational treasury if laundry bills are anything like what they used to\nbe.\"\n\nThis remark, which I thought a very sensible one, set Edith to laughing.\n\"Doubtless we could not do much else if we washed our clothes,\" she said;\n\"but you see we do not wash them.\"\n\n\"Not wash them!--why not?\"\n\n\"Because we don't think it nice to wear clothes again after they have\nbeen so much soiled as to need washing.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't say that I am surprised,\" I replied; \"in fact, I think I\nam no longer capable of being surprised at anything; but perhaps you will\nkindly tell me what you do with a dress when it becomes soiled.\"\n\n\"We throw it away--that is, it goes back to the mills to be made into\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"Indeed! To my nineteenth-century intellect, throwing away clothing would\nseem even more expensive than washing it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, much less so. What do you suppose, now, this costume of mine\ncost?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I am sure. I never had a wife to pay dressmaker's bills\nfor, but I should say certainly it cost a great deal of money.\"\n\n\"Such costumes cost from ten to twenty cents,\" said Edith. \"What do you\nsuppose it is made of?\"\n\nI took the edge of her mantle between my fingers.\n\n\"I thought it was silk or fine linen,\" I replied, \"but I see it is not.\nDoubtless it is some new fiber.\"\n\n\"We have discovered many new fibers, but it is rather a question of\nprocess than material that I had in mind. This is not a textile fabric at\nall, but paper. That is the most common material for garments nowadays.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" I exclaimed, \"what if it should come on to rain on these\npaper clothes? Would they not melt, and at a little strain would they not\npart?\"\n\n\"A costume such as this,\" said Edith, \"is not meant for stormy weather,\nand yet it would by no means melt in a rainstorm, however severe. For\nstorm-garments we have a paper that is absolutely impervious to moisture\non the outer surface. As to toughness, I think you would find it as hard\nto tear this paper as any ordinary cloth. The fabric is so strengthened\nwith fiber as to hold together very stoutly.\"\n\n\"But in winter, at least, when you need warmth, you must have to fall\nback on our old friend the sheep.\"\n\n\"You mean garments made of sheep's hair? Oh, no, there is no modern use\nfor them. Porous paper makes a garment quite as warm as woolen could, and\nvastly lighter than the clothes you had. Nothing but eider down could\nhave been at once so warm and light as our winter coats of paper.\"\n\n\"And cotton!--linen! Don't tell me that they have been given up, like\nwool?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; we weave fabrics of these and other vegetable products, and they\nare nearly as cheap as paper, but paper is so much lighter and more\neasily fashioned into all shapes that it is generally preferred for\ngarments. But, at any rate, we should consider no material fit for\ngarments which could not be thrown away after being soiled. The idea of\nwashing and cleaning articles of bodily use and using them over and over\nagain would be quite intolerable. For this reason, while we want\nbeautiful garments, we distinctly do not want durable ones. In your day,\nit seems, even worse than the practice of washing garments to be used\nagain you were in the habit of keeping your outer garments without\nwashing at all, not only day after day, but week after week, year after\nyear, sometimes whole lifetimes, when they were specially valuable, and\nfinally, perhaps, giving them away to others. It seems that women\nsometimes kept their wedding dresses long enough for their daughters to\nwear at their weddings. That would seem shocking to us, and yet, even\nyour fine ladies did such things. As for what the poor had to do in the\nway of keeping and wearing their old clothes till they went to rags, that\nis something which won't bear thinking of.\"\n\n\"It is rather startling,\" I said, \"to find the problem of clean clothing\nsolved by the abolition of the wash tub, although I perceive that that\nwas the only radical solution. 'Warranted to wear and wash' used to be\nthe advertisement of our clothing merchants, but now it seems, if you\nwould sell clothing, you must warrant the goods neither to wear nor to\nwash.\"\n\n\"As for wearing,\" said Edith, \"our clothing never gets the chance to show\nhow it would wear before we throw it away, any more than the other\nfabrics, such as carpets, bedding, and hangings that we use about our\nhouses.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that they are paper-made also!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Not always made of paper, but always of some fabric so cheap that they\ncan be rejected after the briefest period of using. When you would have\nswept a carpet we put in a new one. Where you would wash or air bedding\nwe renew it, and so with all the hangings about our houses so far as we\nuse them at all. We upholster with air or water instead of feathers. It\nis more than I can understand how you ever endured your musty, fusty,\ndusty rooms with the filth and disease germs of whole generations stored\nin the woolen and hair fabrics that furnished them. When we clean out a\nroom we turn the hose on ceiling, walls, and floor. There is nothing to\nharm--nothing but tiled or other hard-finished surfaces. Our hygienists\nsay that the change in customs in these matters relating to the purity of\nour clothing and dwellings, has done more than all our other improvements\nto eradicate the germs of contagious and other diseases and relegate\nepidemics to ancient history.\n\n\"Talking of paper,\" said Edith, extending a very trim foot by way of\nattracting attention to its gear, \"what do you think of our modern\nshoes?\"\n\n\"Do you mean that they also are made of paper?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I noticed the shoes your father gave me were very light as compared with\nanything I had ever worn before. Really that is a great idea, for\nlightness in foot wear is the first necessity. Scamp shoemakers used to\nput paper soles in shoes in my day. It is evident that instead of\nprosecuting them for rascals we should have revered them as unconscious\nprophets. But, for that matter, how do you prepare soles of paper that\nwill last?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of solutions which will make paper as hard as iron.\"\n\n\"And do not these shoes leak in winter?\"\n\n\"We have different kinds for different weathers. All are seamless, and\nthe wet-weather sort are coated outside with a lacquer impervious to\nmoisture.\"\n\n\"That means, I suppose, that rubbers too as articles of wear have been\nsent to the museum?\"\n\n\"We use rubber, but not for wear. Our waterproof paper is much lighter\nand better every way.\"\n\n\"After all this it is easy to believe that your hats and caps are also\npaper-made.\"\n\n\"And so they are to a great extent,\" said Edith; \"the heavy headgear that\nmade your men bald ours would not endure. We want as little as possible\non our heads, and that as light as may be.\"\n\n\"Go on!\" I exclaimed. \"I suppose I am next to be told that the delicious\nbut mysterious articles of food which come by the pneumatic carrier from\nthe restaurant or are served there are likewise made out of paper.\nProceed--I am prepared to believe it!\"\n\n\"Not quite so bad as that,\" laughed my companion, \"but really the next\nthing to it, for the dishes you eat them from are made of paper. The\ncrash of crockery and glass, which seems to have been a sort of running\naccompaniment to housekeeping in your day, is no more heard in the land.\nOur dishes and kettles for eating or cooking, when they need cleaning are\nthrown away, or rather, as in the case of all these rejected materials I\nhave spoken of, sent back to the factories to be reduced again to pulp\nand made over into other forms.\"\n\n\"But you certainly do not use paper kettles? Fire will still burn, I\nfancy, although you seem to have changed most of the other rules we went\nby.\"\n\n\"Fire will still burn, indeed, but the electrical heat has been adopted\nfor cooking as well as for all other purposes. We no longer heat our\nvessels from without but from within, and the consequence is that we do\nour cooking in paper vessels on wooden stoves, even as the savages used\nto do it in birch-bark vessels with hot stones, for, so the philosophers\nsay, history repeats itself in an ever-ascending spiral.\"\n\nAnd now Edith began to laugh at my perplexed expression. She declared\nthat it was clear my credulity had been taxed with these accounts of\nmodern novelties about as far as it would be prudent to try it without\nfurnishing some further evidence of the truth of the statements she had\nmade. She proposed accordingly, for the balance of the morning, a visit\nto some of the great paper-process factories.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE GREATEST WONDER YET--FASHION DETHRONED.\n\n\"You surely can not form the slightest idea of the bodily ecstasy it\ngives me to have done with that horrible masquerade in mummy clothes,\"\nexclaimed my companion as we left the house. \"To think this is the first\ntime we have actually been walking together!\"\n\n\"Surely you forget,\" I replied; \"we have been out together several\ntimes.\"\n\n\"Out together, yes, but not walking,\" she answered; \"at least I was not\nwalking. I don't know what would be the proper zoological term to\ndescribe the way I got over the ground inside of those bags, but it\ncertainly was not walking. The women of your day, you see, were trained\nfrom childhood in that mode of progression, and no doubt acquired some\nskill in it; but I never had skirts on in my life except once, in some\ntheatricals. It was the hardest thing I ever tried, and I doubt if I ever\nagain give you so strong a proof of my regard. I am astonished that you\ndid not seem to notice what a distressful time I was having.\"\n\nBut if, being accustomed, as I had been, to the gait of women hampered by\ndraperies, I had not observed anything unusual in Edith's walk when we\nhad been out on previous occasions, the buoyant grace of her carriage and\nthe elastic vigor of her step as she strode now by my side was a\nrevelation of the possibilities of an athletic companionship which was\nnot a little intoxicating.\n\nTo describe in detail what I saw in my tour that day through\nthe paper-process factories would be to tell an old story to\ntwentieth-century readers; but what far more impressed me than all the\ningenuity and variety of mechanical adaptations was the workers\nthemselves and the conditions of their labor. I need not tell my readers\nwhat the great mills are in these days--lofty, airy halls, walled with\nbeautiful designs in tiles and metal, furnished like palaces, with every\nconvenience, the machinery running almost noiselessly, and every incident\nof the work that might be offensive to any sense reduced by ingenious\ndevices to the minimum. Neither need I describe to you the princely\nworkers in these palaces of industry, the strong and splendid men and\nwomen, with their refined and cultured faces, prosecuting with the\nenthusiasm of artists their self-chosen tasks of combining use and\nbeauty. You all know what your factories are to-day; no doubt you find\nthem none too pleasant or convenient, having been used to such things all\nyour lives. No doubt you even criticise them in various ways as falling\nshort of what they might be, for such is human nature; but if you would\nunderstand how they seem to me, shut your eyes a moment and try to\nconceive in fancy what our cotton and woolen and paper mills were like a\nhundred years ago.\n\nPicture low rooms roofed with rough and grimy timbers and walled with\nbare or whitewashed brick. Imagine the floor so crammed with machinery\nfor economy of space as to allow bare room for the workers to writhe\nabout among the flying arms and jaws of steel, a false motion meaning\ndeath or mutilation. Imagine the air space above filled, instead of air,\nwith a mixture of stenches of oil and filth, unwashed human bodies, and\nfoul clothing. Conceive a perpetual clang and clash of machinery like the\nscreech of a tornado.\n\nBut these were only the material conditions of the scene. Shut your eyes\nonce more, that you may see what I would fain forget I had ever seen--the\ninterminable rows of women, pallid, hollow-cheeked, with faces vacant and\nstolid but for the accent of misery, their clothing tattered, faded, and\nfoul; and not women only, but multitudes of little children, weazen-faced\nand ragged--children whose mother's milk was barely out of their blood,\ntheir bones yet in the gristle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEdith introduced me to the superintendent of one of the factories, a\nhandsome woman of perhaps forty years. She very kindly showed us about\nand explained matters to me, and was much interested in turn to know what\nI thought of the modern factories and their points of contrast with those\nof former days. Naturally, I told her that I had been impressed, far more\nthan by anything in the new mechanical appliances, with the\ntransformation in the condition of the workers themselves.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said, \"of course you would say so; that must indeed be the\ngreat contrast, though the present ways seem so entirely a matter of\ncourse to us that we forget it was not always so. When the workers settle\nhow the work shall be done, it is not wonderful that the conditions\nshould be the pleasantest possible. On the other hand, when, as in your\nday, a class like your private capitalists, who did not share the work,\nnevertheless settled how it should be done it is not surprising that the\nconditions of industry should have been as barbarous as they were,\nespecially when the operation of the competitive system compelled the\ncapitalists to get the most work possible out of the workers on the\ncheapest terms.\"\n\n\"Do I understand.\" I asked, \"that the workers in each trade regulate for\nthemselves the conditions of their particular occupation?\"\n\n\"By no means. The unitary character of our industrial administration is\nthe vital idea of it, without which it would instantly become\nimpracticable. If the members of each trade controlled its conditions,\nthey would presently be tempted to conduct it selfishly and adversely to\nthe general interest of the community, seeking, as your private\ncapitalists did, to get as much and give as little as possible. And not\nonly would every distinctive class of workers be tempted to act in this\nmanner, but every subdivision of workers in the same trade would\npresently be pursuing the same policy, until the whole industrial system\nwould become disintegrated, and we should have to call the capitalists\nfrom their graves to save us. When I said that the workers regulated the\nconditions of work, I meant the workers as a whole--that is, the people\nat large, all of whom are nowadays workers, you know. The regulation and\nmutual adjustment of the conditions of the several branches of the\nindustrial system are wholly done by the General Government. At the same\ntime, however, the regulation of the conditions of work in any occupation\nis effectively, though indirectly, controlled by the workers in it\nthrough the right we all have to choose and change our occupations.\nNobody would choose an occupation the conditions of which were not\nsatisfactory, so they have to be made and kept satisfactory.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile we were at the factory the noon hour came, and I asked the\nsuperintendent and Edith to go out to lunch with me. In fact, I wanted to\nascertain whether my newly acquired credit card was really good for\nanything or not.\n\n\"There is one point about your modern costumes,\" I said, as we sat at our\ntable in the dining hall, \"about which I am rather curious. Will you tell\nme who or what sets the fashions?\"\n\n\"The Creator sets the only fashion which is now generally followed,\"\nEdith answered.\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"The fashion of our bodies,\" she answered.\n\n\"Ah, yes, very good,\" I replied, \"and very true, too, of your costumes,\nas it certainly was not of ours; but my question still remains. Allowing\nthat you have a general theory of dress, there are a thousand differences\nin details, with possible variations of style, shape, color, material,\nand what not. Now, the making of garments is carried on, I suppose, like\nall your other industries, as public business, under collective\nmanagement, is it not?\"\n\n\"Certainly. People, of course, can make their own clothes if they wish\nto, just as they can make anything else, but it would be a great waste of\ntime and energy.\"\n\n\"Very well. The garments turned out by the factories have to be made up\non some particular design or designs. In my day the question of designs\nof garments was settled by society leaders, fashion journals, edicts from\nParis, or the Lord knows how; but at any rate the question was settled\nfor us, and we had nothing to do but to obey. I don't say it was a good\nway; on the contrary, it was detestable; but what I want to know is, What\nsystem have you instead, for I suppose you have now no society leaders,\nfashion journals, or Paris edicts? Who settles the question what you\nshall wear?\"\n\n\"We do,\" replied the superintendent.\n\n\"You mean, I suppose, that you determine it collectively by democratic\nmethods. Now, when I look around me in this dining hall and see the\nvariety and beauty of the costumes, I am bound to say that the result of\nyour system seems satisfactory, and yet I think it would strike even the\nstrongest believer in the principle of democracy that the rule of the\nmajority ought scarcely to extend to dress. I admit that the yoke of\nfashion which we bowed to was very onerous, and yet it was true that if\nwe were brave enough, as few indeed were, we might defy it; but with the\nstyle of dress determined by the administration, and only certain styles\nmade, you must either follow the taste of the majority or lie abed. Why\ndo you laugh? Is it not so?\"\n\n\"We were smiling,\" replied the superintendent, \"on account of a slight\nmisapprehension on your part. When I said that we regulated questions of\ndress, I meant that we regulated them not collectively, by majority, but\nindividually, each for himself or herself.\"\n\n\"But I don't see how you can,\" I persisted. \"The business of producing\nfabrics and of making them into garments is carried on by the Government.\nDoes not that imply, practically, a governmental control or initiative in\nfashions of dress?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no!\" exclaimed the superintendent. \"It is evident, Mr. West, as\nindeed the histories say, that governmental action carried with it in\nyour day an arbitrary implication which it does not now. The Government\nis actually now what it nominally was in the America of your day--the\nservant, tool, and instrument by which the people give effect to their\nwill, itself being without will. The popular will is expressed in two\nways, which are quite distinct and relate to different provinces: First,\ncollectively, by majority, in regard to blended, mutually involved\ninterests, such as the large economic and political concerns of the\ncommunity; second, personally, by each individual for himself or herself\nin the furtherance of private and self-regarding matters. The Government\nis not more absolutely the servant of the collective will in regard to\nthe blended interests of the community than it is of the individual\nconvenience in personal matters. It is at once the august representative\nof all in general concerns, and everybody's agent, errand boy, and\nfactotum for all private ends. Nothing is too high or too low, too great\nor too little, for it to do for us.\n\n\"The dressmaking department holds its vast provision of fabrics and\nmachinery at the absolute disposition of the whims of every man or woman\nin the nation. You can go to one of the stores and order any costume of\nwhich a historical description exists, from the days of Eve to yesterday,\nor you can furnish a design of your own invention for a brand-new\ncostume, designating any material at present existing, and it will be\nsent home to you in less time than any nineteenth-century dressmaker ever\neven promised to fill an order. Really, talking of this, I want you to\nsee our garment-making machines in operation. Our paper garments, of\ncourse, are seamless, and made wholly by machinery. The apparatus being\nadjustable to any measure, you can have a costume turned out for you\ncomplete while you are looking over the machine. There are, of course,\nsome general styles and shapes that are usually popular, and the stores\nkeep a supply of them on hand, but that is for the convenience of the\npeople, not of the department, which holds itself always ready to follow\nthe initiative of any citizen and provide anything ordered in the least\npossible time.\"\n\n\"Then anybody can set the fashion?\" I said.\n\n\"Anybody can set it, but whether it is followed depends on whether it is\na good one, and really has some new point in respect of convenience or\nbeauty; otherwise it certainly will not become a fashion. Its vogue will\nbe precisely proportioned to the merit the popular taste recognizes in\nit, just as if it were an invention in mechanics. If a new idea in dress\nhas any merit in it, it is taken up with great promptness, for our people\nare extremely interested in enhancing personal beauty by costume, and the\nabsence of any arbitrary standards of style such as fashion set for you\nleaves us on the alert for attractions and novelties in shape and color.\nIt is in variety of effect that our mode of dressing seems indeed to\ndiffer most from yours. Your styles were constantly being varied by the\nedicts of fashion, but as only one style was tolerated at a time, you had\nonly a successive and not a simultaneous variety, such as we have. I\nshould imagine that this uniformity of style, extending, as I understand\nit often did, to fabric, color, and shape alike, must have caused your\ngreat assemblages to present a depressing effect of sameness.\n\n\"That was a fact fully admitted in my day,\" I replied. \"The artists were\nthe enemies of fashion, as indeed all sensible people were, but\nresistance was in vain. Do you know, if I were to return to the\nnineteenth century, there is perhaps nothing else I could tell my\ncontemporaries of the changes you have made that would so deeply impress\nthem as the information that you had broken the scepter of fashion, that\nthere were no longer any arbitrary standards in dress recognized, and\nthat no style had any other vogue that might be given it by individual\nrecognition of its merits. That most of the other yokes humanity wore\nmight some day be broken, the more hopeful of us believed, but the yoke\nof fashion we never expected to be freed from, unless perhaps in heaven.\"\n\n\"The reign of fashion, as the history books call it, always seemed to me\none of the most utterly incomprehensible things about the old order,\"\nsaid Edith. \"It would seem that it must have had some great force behind\nit to compel such abject submission to a rule so tyrannical. And yet\nthere seems to have been no force at all used. Do tell us what the secret\nwas, Julian?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me,\" I protested. \"It seemed to be some fell enchantment that\nwe were subject to--that is all I know. Nobody professed to understand\nwhy we did as we did. Can't you tell us,\" I added, turning to the\nsuperintendent--\"how do you moderns diagnose the fashion mania that made\nour lives such a burden to us?\"\n\n\"Since you appeal to me,\" replied our companion, \"I may say that the\nhistorians explain the dominion of fashion in your age as the natural\nresult of a disparity of economic conditions prevailing in a community in\nwhich rigid distinctions of caste had ceased to exist. It resulted from\ntwo factors: the desire of the common herd to imitate the superior class,\nand the desire of the superior class to protect themselves from that\nimitation and preserve distinction of appearance. In times and countries\nwhere class was caste, and fixed by law or iron custom, each caste had\nits distinctive dress, to imitate which was not allowed to another class.\nConsequently fashions were stationary. With the rise of democracy, the\nlegal protection of class distinctions was abolished, while the actual\ndisparity in social ranks still existed, owing to the persistence of\neconomic inequalities. It was now free for all to imitate the superior\nclass, and thus seem at least to be as good as it, and no kind of\nimitation was so natural and easy as dress. First, the socially ambitious\nled off in this imitation; then presently the less pretentious were\nconstrained to follow their example, to avoid an apparent confession of\nsocial inferiority; till, finally, even the philosophers had to follow\nthe herd and conform to the fashion, to avoid being conspicuous by an\nexceptional appearance.\"\n\n\"I can see,\" said Edith, \"how social emulation should make the masses\nimitate the richer and superior class, and how the fashions should in\nthis way be set; but why were they changed so often, when it must have\nbeen so terribly expensive and troublesome to make the changes?\"\n\n\"For the reason,\" answered the superintendent, \"that the only way the\nsuperior class could escape their imitators and preserve their\ndistinction in dress was by adopting constantly new fashions, only to\ndrop them for still newer ones as soon as they were imitated.--Does it\nseem to you, Mr. West, that this explanation corresponds with the facts\nas you observed them?\"\n\n\"Entirely so,\" I replied. \"It might be added, too, that the changes in\nfashions were greatly fomented and assisted by the self-interest of vast\nindustrial and commercial interests engaged in purveying the materials of\ndress and personal belongings. Every change, by creating a demand for new\nmaterials and rendering those in use obsolete, was what we called good\nfor trade, though if tradesmen were unlucky enough to be caught by a\nsudden change of fashion with a lot of goods on hand it meant ruin to\nthem. Great losses of this sort, indeed, attended every change in\nfashion.\"\n\n\"But we read that there were fashions in many things besides dress,\" said\nEdith.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the superintendent. \"Dress was the stronghold and main\nprovince of fashion because imitation was easiest and most effective\nthrough dress, but in nearly everything that pertained to the habits of\nliving, eating, drinking, recreation, to houses, furniture, horses and\ncarriages, and servants, to the manner of bowing even, and shaking hands,\nto the mode of eating food and taking tea, and I don't know what\nelse--there were fashions which must be followed, and were changed as\nsoon as they were followed. It was indeed a sad, fantastic race, and, Mr.\nWest's contemporaries appear to have fully realized it; but as long as\nsociety was made up of unequals with no caste barriers to prevent\nimitation, the inferiors were bound to ape the superiors, and the\nsuperiors were bound to baffle imitation, so far as possible, by seeking\never-fresh devices for expressing their superiority.\"\n\n\"In short,\" I said, \"our tedious sameness in dress and manners appears to\nyou to have been the logical result of our lack of equality in\nconditions.\"\n\n\"Precisely so,\" answered the superintendent. \"Because you were not equal,\nyou made yourself miserable and ugly in the attempt to seem so. The\naesthetic equivalent of the moral wrong of inequality was the artistic\nabomination of uniformity. On the other hand, equality creates an\natmosphere which kills imitation, and is pregnant with originality, for\nevery one acts out himself, having nothing to gain by imitating any one\nelse.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSOMETHING THAT HAD NOT CHANGED.\n\nWhen we parted with the superintendent of the paper-process factory I\nsaid to Edith that I had taken in since that morning about all the new\nimpressions and new philosophies I could for the time mentally digest,\nand felt great need of resting my mind for a space in the contemplation\nof something--if indeed there were anything--which had not changed or\nbeen improved in the last century.\n\nAfter a moment's consideration Edith exclaimed: \"I have it! Ask no\nquestions, but just come with me.\"\n\nPresently, as we were making our way along the route she had taken, she\ntouched my arm, saying, \"Let us hurry a little.\"\n\nNow, hurrying was the regulation gait of the nineteenth century. \"Hurry\nup!\" was about the most threadbare phrase in the English language, and\nrather than \"_E pluribus unum_\" should especially have been the\nmotto of the American people, but it was the first time the note of haste\nhad impressed my consciousness since I had been living twentieth-century\ndays. This fact, together with the touch of my companion upon my arm as\nshe sought to quicken my pace, caused me to look around, and in so doing\nto pause abruptly.\n\n\"What is this?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"It is too bad!\" said my companion. \"I tried to get you past without\nseeing it.\"\n\nBut indeed, though I had asked what was this building we stood in\npresence of, nobody could know so well as I what it was. The mystery was\nhow it had come to be there for in the midst of this splendid city of\nequals, where poverty was an unknown word, I found myself face to face\nwith a typical nineteenth-century tenement house of the worst sort--one\nof the rookeries, in fact, that used to abound in the North End and other\nparts of the city. The environment was indeed in strong enough contrast\nwith that of such buildings in my time, shut in as they generally were by\na labyrinth of noisome alleys and dark, damp courtyards which were\nreeking reservoirs of foetid odors, kept in by lofty, light-excluding\nwalls. This building stood by itself, in the midst of an open square, as\nif it had been a palace or other show place. But all the more, indeed, by\nthis fine setting was the dismal squalor of the grimy structure\nemphasized. It seemed to exhale an atmosphere of gloom and chill which\nall the bright sunshine of the breezy September afternoon was unable to\ndominate. One would not have been surprised, even at noonday, to see\nghosts at the black windows. There was an inscription over the door, and\nI went across the square to read it, Edith reluctantly following me.\nThese words I read, above the central doorway:\n\n\"THIS HABITATION OF CRUELTY IS PRESERVED AS A MEMENTO TO COMING\nGENERATIONS OF THE RULE OF THE RICH.\"\n\n\"This is one of the ghost buildings,\" said Edith, \"kept to scare the\npeople with, so that they may never risk anything that looks like\nbringing back the old order of things by allowing any one on any plea to\nobtain an economic advantage over another. I think they had much better\nbe torn down, for there is no more danger of the world's going back to\nthe old order than there is of the globe reversing its rotation.\"\n\nA band of children, accompanied by a young woman, came across the square\nas we stood before the building, and filed into the doorway and up the\nblack and narrow stairway. The faces of the little ones were very\nserious, and they spoke in whispers.\n\n\"They are school children.\" said Edith. \"We are all taken through this\nbuilding, or some other like it, when we are in the schools, and the\nteacher explains what manner of things used to be done and endured there.\nI remember well when I was taken through this building as a child. It was\nlong afterward before I quite recovered from the terrible impression I\nreceived. Really, I don't think it is a good idea to bring young children\nhere, but it is a custom that became settled in the period after the\nRevolution, when the horror of the bondage they had escaped from was yet\nfresh in the minds of the people, and their great fear was that by some\nlack of vigilance the rule of the rich might be restored.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continued, \"this building and the others like it, which\nwere reserved for warnings when the rest were razed to the ground, have\nbeen thoroughly cleaned and strengthened and made sanitary and safe every\nway, but our artists have very cunningly counterfeited all the old\neffects of filth and squalor, so that the appearance of everything is\njust as it was. Tablets in the rooms describe how many human beings used\nto be crowded into them, and the horrible conditions of their lives. The\nworst about it is that the facts are all taken from historical records,\nand are absolutely true. There are some of these places in which the\ninhabitants of the buildings as they used to swarm in them are reproduced\nin wax or plaster with every detail of garments, furniture, and all the\nother features based on actual records or pictures of the time. There is\nsomething indescribably dreadful in going through the buildings fitted\nout in that way. The dumb figures seem to appeal to you to help them. It\nwas so long ago, and yet it makes one feel conscience-stricken not to be\nable to do anything.\"\n\n\"But, Julian, come away. It was just a stupid accident my bringing you\npast here. When I undertook to show you something that had not changed\nsince your day, I did not mean to mock you.\"\n\nThanks to modern rapid transit, ten minutes later we stood on the ocean\nshore, with the waves of the Atlantic breaking noisily at our feet and\nits blue floor extending unbroken to the horizon. Here indeed was\nsomething that had not been changed--a mighty existence, to which a\nthousand years were as one day and one day as a thousand years. There\ncould be no tonic for my case like the inspiration of this great\npresence, this unchanging witness of all earth's mutations. How petty\nseemed the little trick of time that had been played on me as I stood in\nthe presence of this symbol of everlastingness which made past, present,\nand future terms of little meaning!\n\nIn accompanying Edith to the part of the beach where we stood I had taken\nno note of directions, but now, as I began to study the shore, I observed\nwith lively emotion that she had unwittingly brought me to the site of my\nold seaside place at Nahant. The buildings were indeed gone, and the\ngrowth of trees had quite changed the aspect of the landscape, but the\nshore line remained unaltered, and I knew it at once. Bidding her follow\nme, I led the way around a point to a little strip of beach between the\nsea and a wall of rock which shut off all sight or sound of the land\nbehind. In my former life the spot had been a favorite resort when I\nvisited the shore. Here in that life so long ago, and yet recalled as if\nof yesterday, I had been used from a lad to go to do my day dreaming.\nEvery feature of the little nook was as familiar to me as my bedroom and\nall was quite unchanged. The sea in front, the sky above, the islands and\nthe blue headlands of the distant coast--all, indeed, that filled the\nview was the same in every detail. I threw myself upon the warm sand by\nthe margin of the sea, as I had been wont to do, and in a moment the\nflood of familiar associations had so completely carried me back to my\nold life that all the marvels that had happened to me, when presently I\nbegan to recall them, seemed merely as a day dream that had come to me\nlike so many others before it in that spot by the shore. But what a dream\nit had been, that vision of the world to be; surely of all the dreams\nthat had come to me there by the sea the weirdest!\n\nThere had been a girl in the dream, a maiden much to be desired. It had\nbeen ill if I had lost her; but I had not, for this was she, the girl in\nthis strange and graceful garb, standing by my side and smiling down at\nme. I had by some great hap brought her back from dreamland, holding her\nby the very strength of my love when all else of the vision had dissolved\nat the opening of the eyes.\n\nWhy not? What youth has not often been visited in his dreams by maidenly\nideals fairer than walk on earth, whom, waking, he has sighed for and for\ndays been followed by the haunting beauty of their half-remembered faces?\nI, more fortunate than they, had baffled the jealous warder at the gates\nof sleep and brought my queen of dreamland through.\n\nWhen I proceeded to state to Edith this theory to account for her\npresence, she professed to find it highly reasonable, and we proceeded at\nmuch length to develop the idea. Falling into the conceit that she was an\nanticipation of the twentieth-century woman instead of my being an\nexcavated relic of the nineteenth-century man, we speculated what we\nshould do for the summer. We decided to visit the great pleasure resorts,\nwhere, no doubt, she would under the circumstances excite much curiosity\nand at the same time have an opportunity of studying what to her\ntwentieth-century mind would seem even more astonishing types of humanity\nthan she would seem to them--namely, people who, surrounded by a needy\nand anguished world, could get their own consent to be happy in a\nfrivolous and wasteful idleness. Afterward we would go to Europe and\ninspect such things there as might naturally be curiosities to a girl out\nof the year 2000, such as a Rothschild, an emperor, and a few specimens\nof human beings, some of which were at that time still extant in Germany,\nAustria, and Russia, who honestly believed that God had given to certain\nfellow-beings a divine title to reign over them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nA MIDNIGHT PLUNGE.\n\nIt was after dark when we reached home, and several hours later before we\nhad made an end of telling our adventures. Indeed, my hosts seemed at all\ntimes unable to hear too much of my impressions of modern things,\nappearing to be as much interested in what I thought of them as I was in\nthe things themselves.\n\n\"It is really, you see,\" Edith's mother had said, \"the manifestation of\nvanity on our part. You are a sort of looking-glass to us, in which we\ncan see how we appear from a different point of view from our own. If it\nwere not for you, we should never have realized what remarkable people we\nare, for to one another, I assure you, we seem very ordinary.\"\n\nTo which I replied that in talking with them I got the same looking-glass\neffect as to myself and my contemporaries, but that it was one which by\nno means ministered to my vanity.\n\nWhen, as we talked, the globe of the color clock turning white announced\nthat it was midnight, some one spoke of bed, but the doctor had another\nscheme.\n\n\"I propose,\" said he, \"by way of preparing a good night's rest for us\nall, that we go over to the natatorium and take a plunge.\"\n\n\"Are there any public baths open so late as this?\" I said. \"In my day\neverything was shut up long before now.\"\n\nThen and there the doctor gave me the information which, matter of course\nas it is to twentieth-century readers, was surprising enough to me, that\nno public service or convenience is ever suspended at the present day,\nwhether by day or night, the year round; and that, although the service\nprovided varies in extent, according to the demand, it never varies in\nquality.\n\n\"It seems to us,\" said the doctor, \"that among the minor inconveniences\nof life in your day none could have been more vexing than the recurrent\ninterruption of all, or of the larger part of all, public services every\nnight. Most of the people, of course, are asleep then, but always a\nportion of them have occasion to be awake and about, and all of us\nsometimes, and we should consider it a very lame public service that did\nnot provide for the night workers as good a service as for the day\nworkers. Of course, you could not do it, lacking any unitary industrial\norganization, but it is very easy with us. We have day and night shifts\nfor all the public services--the latter, of course, much the smaller.\"\n\n\"How about public holidays; have you abandoned them?\"\n\n\"Pretty generally. The occasional public holidays in your time were\nprized by the people, as giving them much-needed breathing spaces.\nNowadays, when the working day is so short and the working year so\ninterspersed with ample vacations, the old-fashioned holiday has ceased\nto serve any purpose, and would be regarded as a nuisance. We prefer to\nchoose and use our leisure time as we please.\"\n\nIt was to the Leander Natatorium that we had directed our steps. As I\nneed not remind Bostonians, this is one of the older baths, and\nconsidered quite inferior to the modern structures. To me, however, it\nwas a vastly impressive spectacle. The lofty interior glowing with light,\nthe immense swimming tank, the four great fountains filling the air with\ndiamond-dazzle and the noise of falling water, together with the throng\nof gayly dressed and laughing bathers, made an exhilarating and\nmagnificent scene, which was a very effective introduction to the\nathletic side of the modern life. The loveliest thing of all was the\ngreat expanse of water made translucent by the light reflected from the\nwhite tiled bottom, so that the swimmers, their whole bodies visible,\nseemed as if floating on a pale emerald cloud, with an effect of buoyancy\nand weightlessness that was as startling as charming. Edith was quick to\ntell me, however, that this was as nothing to the beauty of some of the\nnew and larger baths, where, by varying the colors of the tiling at the\nbottom, the water is made to shade through all the tints of the rainbow\nwhile preserving the same translucent appearance.\n\nI had formed an impression that the water would be fresh, but the green\nhue, of course, showed it to be from the sea.\n\n\"We have a poor opinion of fresh water for swimming when we can get\nsalt,\" said the doctor. \"This water came in on the last tide from the\nAtlantic.\"\n\n\"But how do you get it up to this level?\"\n\n\"We make it carry itself up,\" laughed the doctor; \"it would be a pity if\nthe tidal force that raises the whole harbor fully seven feet, could not\nraise what little we want a bit higher. Don't look at it so\nsuspiciously,\" he added. \"I know that Boston Harbor water was far from\nbeing clean enough for bathing in your day, but all that is changed. Your\nsewerage systems, remember, are forgotten abominations, and nothing that\ncan defile is allowed to reach sea or river nowadays. For that reason we\ncan and do use sea water, not only for all the public baths, but provide\nit as a distinct service for our home baths and also for all the public\nfountains, which, thus inexhaustibly supplied, can be kept always\nplaying. But let us go in.\"\n\n\"Certainly, if you say so,\" said I, with a shiver, \"but are you sure that\nit is not a trifle cool? Ocean water was thought by us to be chilly for\nbathing in late September.\"\n\n\"Did you think we were going to give you your death?\" said the doctor.\n\"Of course, the water is warmed to a comfortable temperature; these baths\nare open all winter.\"\n\n\"But, dear me! how can you possibly warm such great bodies of water,\nwhich are so constantly renewed, especially in winter?\"\n\n\"Oh, we have no conscience at all about what we make the tides do for\nus,\" replied the doctor. \"We not only make them lift the water up here,\nbut heat it, too. Why, Julian, cold or hot are terms without real\nmeaning, mere coquettish airs which Nature puts on, indicating that she\nwants to be wooed a little. She would just as soon warm you as freeze\nyou, if you will approach her rightly. The blizzards which used to freeze\nyour generation might just as well have taken the place of your coal\nmines. You look incredulous, but let me tell you now, as a first step\ntoward the understanding of modern conditions, that power, with all its\napplications of light, heat, and energy, is to-day practically\nexhaustless and costless, and scarcely enters as an element into\nmechanical calculation. The uses of the tides, winds, and waterfalls are\nindeed but crude methods of drawing on Nature's resources of strength\ncompared with others that are employed by which boundless power is\ndeveloped from natural inequalities of temperature.\"\n\nA few moments later I was enjoying the most delicious sea bath that ever\nup to that time had fallen to my lot; the pleasure of the pelting under\nthe fountains was to me a new sensation in life.\n\n\"You'll make a first-rate twentieth-century Bostonian,\" said the doctor,\nlaughing at my delight. \"It is said that a marked feature of our modern\ncivilization is that we are tending to revert to the amphibious type of\nour remote ancestry; evidently you will not object to drifting with the\ntide.\"\n\nIt was one o'clock when we reached home.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Edith, as I bade her good-night, \"that in ten minutes\nyou will be back among your friends of the nineteenth century if you\ndream as you did last night. What would I not give to take the journey\nwith you and see for myself what the world was like!\"\n\n\"And I would give as much to be spared a repetition of the experience,\" I\nsaid, \"unless it were in your company.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you really are afraid you will dream of the old times\nagain?\"\n\n\"So much afraid,\" I replied, \"that I have a good mind to sit up all night\nto avoid the possibility of another such nightmare.\"\n\n\"Dear me! you need not do that,\" she said. \"If you wish me to, I will see\nthat you are troubled no more in that way.\"\n\n\"Are you, then, a magician?\"\n\n\"If I tell you not to dream of any particular matter, you will not,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"You are easily the mistress of my waking thoughts,\" I said; \"but can you\nrule my sleeping mind as well?\"\n\n\"You shall see,\" she said, and, fixing her eyes upon mine, she said\nquietly, \"Remember, you are not to dream of anything to-night which\nbelonged to your old life!\" and, as she spoke, I knew in my mind that it\nwould be as she said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nLIFE THE BASIS OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY.\n\nAmong the pieces of furniture in the subterranean bedchamber where Dr.\nLeete had found me sleeping was one of the strong boxes of iron cunningly\nlocked which in my time were used for the storage of money and valuables.\nThe location of this chamber so far underground, its solid stone\nconstruction and heavy doors, had not only made it impervious to noise\nbut equally proof against thieves, and its very existence being,\nmoreover, a secret, I had thought that no place could be safer for\nkeeping the evidences of my wealth.\n\nEdith had been very curious about the safe, which was the name we gave to\nthese strong boxes, and several times when we were visiting the vault had\nexpressed a lively desire to see what was inside. I had proposed to open\nit for her, but she had suggested that, as her father and mother would be\nas much interested in the process as herself, it would be best to\npostpone the treat till all should be present.\n\nAs we sat at breakfast the day after the experiences narrated in the\nprevious chapters, she asked why that morning would not be a good time to\nshow the inside of the safe, and everybody agreed that there could be no\nbetter.\n\n\"What is in the safe?\" asked Edith's mother.\n\n\"When I last locked it in the year 1887,\" I replied, \"there were in it\nsecurities and evidences of value of various sorts representing something\nlike a million dollars. When we open it this morning we shall find,\nthanks to the great Revolution, a fine collection of waste paper.--I\nwonder, by the way, doctor, just what your judges would say if I were to\ntake those securities to them and make a formal demand to be reinstated\nin the possessions which they represented? Suppose I said: 'Your Honors,\nthese properties were once mine and I have never voluntarily parted with\nthem. Why are they not mine now, and why should they not be returned to\nme?' You understand, of course, that I have no desire to start a revolt\nagainst the present order, which I am very ready to admit is much better\nthan the old arrangements, but I am quite curious to know just what the\njudges would reply to such a demand, provided they consented to entertain\nit seriously. I suppose they would laugh me out of court. Still, I think\nI might argue with some plausibility that, seeing I was not present when\nthe Revolution divested us capitalists of our wealth, I am at least\nentitled to a courteous explanation of the grounds on which that course\nwas justified at the time. I do not want my million back, even if it were\npossible to return it, but as a matter of rational satisfaction I should\nlike to know on just what plea it was appropriated and is retained by the\ncommunity.\"\n\n\"Really Julian,\" said the doctor, \"it would be an excellent idea if you\nwere to do just what you have suggested--that is, bring a formal suit\nagainst the nation for reinstatement in your former property. It would\narouse the liveliest popular interest and stimulate a discussion of the\nethical basis of our economic equality that would be of great educational\nvalue to the community. You see the present order has been so long\nestablished that it does not often occur to anybody except historians\nthat there ever was any other. It would be a good thing for the people to\nhave their minds stirred up on the subject and be compelled to do some\nfundamental thinking as to the merits of the differences between the old\nand the new order and the reasons for the present system. Confronting the\ncourt with those securities in your hand, you would make a fine dramatic\nsituation. It would be the nineteenth century challenging the twentieth,\nthe old civilization, demanding an accounting of the new. The judges, you\nmay be sure, would treat you with the greatest consideration. They would\nat once admit your rights under the peculiar circumstances to have the\nwhole question of wealth distribution and the rights of property reopened\nfrom the beginning, and be ready to discuss it in the broadest spirit.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I answered, \"but it is just an illustration, I suppose, of\nthe lack of unselfish public spirit among my contemporaries that I do not\nfeel disposed to make myself a spectacle even in the cause of education.\nBesides, what is the need? You can tell me as well as the judges could\nwhat the answer would be, and as it is the answer I want and not the\nproperty that will do just as well.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said the doctor, \"I could give you the general line of\nreasoning they would follow.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let us suppose, then, that you are the court. On what ground\nwould you refuse to return me my million, for I assume that you would\nrefuse?\"\n\n\"Of course it would be the same ground,\" replied the doctor, \"that the\nnation proceeded upon in nationalizing the property which that same\nmillion represented at the time of the great Revolution.\"\n\n\"I suppose so; that is what I want to get at. What is that ground?\"\n\n\"The court would say that to allow any person to withdraw or withhold\nfrom the public administration for the common use any larger portion of\ncapital than the equal portion allotted to all for personal use and\nconsumption would in so far impair the ability of society to perform its\nfirst duty to its members.\"\n\n\"What is this first duty of society to its members, which would be\ninterfered with by allowing particular citizens to appropriate more than\nan equal proportion of the capital of the country?\"\n\n\"The duty of safeguarding the first and highest right of its members--the\nright of life.\"\n\n\"But how is the duty of society to safeguard the lives of its members\ninterfered with when one person, has more capital than another?\"\n\n\"Simply,\" answered the doctor, \"because people have to eat in order to\nlive, also to be clothed and to consume a mass of necessary and desirable\nthings, the sum of which constitutes what we call wealth or capital. Now,\nif the supply of these things was always unlimited, as is the air we need\nto breathe, it would not be necessary to see that each one had his share,\nbut the supply of wealth being, in fact, at any one time limited, it\nfollows that if some have a disproportionate share, the rest will not\nhave enough and may be left with nothing, as was indeed the case of\nmillions all over the world until the great Revolution established\neconomic equality. If, then, the first right of the citizen is protection\nto life and the first duty of society is to furnish it, the state must\nevidently see to it that the means of life are not unduly appropriated by\nparticular individuals, but are distributed so as to meet the needs of\nall. Moreover, in order to secure the means of life to all, it is not\nmerely necessary that the state should see that the wealth available for\nconsumption is properly distributed at any given time; for, although all\nmight in that case fare well for to-day, tomorrow all might starve\nunless, meanwhile, new wealth were being produced. The duty of society to\nguarantee the life of the citizen implies, therefore, not merely the\nequal distribution of wealth for consumption, but its employment as\ncapital to the best possible advantage for all in the production of more\nwealth. In both ways, therefore, you will readily see that society would\nfail in its first and greatest function in proportion as it were to\npermit individuals beyond the equal allotment to withdraw wealth, whether\nfor consumption or employment as capital, from the public administration\nin the common interest.\"\n\n\"The modern ethics of ownership is rather startlingly simple to a\nrepresentative of the nineteenth century,\" I observed. \"Would not the\njudges even ask me by what right or title of ownership I claimed my\nwealth?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. It is impossible that you or any one could have so strong\na title to material things as the least of your fellow-citizens have to\ntheir lives, or could make so strong a plea for the use of the collective\npower to enforce your right to things as they could make that the\ncollective power should enforce their right to life against your right to\nthings at whatever point the two claims might directly or indirectly\nconflict. The effect of the disproportionate possession of the wealth of\na community by some of its members to curtail and threaten the living of\nthe rest is not in any way affected by the means by which that wealth was\nobtained. The means may have constituted, as in past times they often did\nby their iniquity, an added injury to the community; but the fact of the\ndisproportion, however resulting, was a continuing injury, without regard\nto its beginnings. Our ethics of wealth is indeed, as you say, extremely\nsimple. It consists merely in the law of self-preservation, asserted in\nthe name of all against the encroachments of any. It rests upon a\nprinciple which a child can understand as well as a philosopher, and\nwhich no philosopher ever attempted to refute--namely, the supreme right\nof all to live, and consequently to insist that society shall be so\norganized as to secure that right.\n\n\"But, after all,\" said the doctor, \"what is there in our economic\napplication of this principle which need impress a man of your time with\nany other sensation than one of surprise that it was not earlier made?\nSince what you were wont to call modern civilization existed, it has been\na principle subscribed to by all governments and peoples that it is the\nfirst and supreme duty of the state to protect the lives of the citizens.\nFor the purpose of doing this the police, the courts, the army, and the\ngreater part of the machinery of governments has existed. You went so far\nas to hold that a state which did not at any cost and to the utmost of\nits resources safeguard the lives of its citizens forfeited all claim to\ntheir allegiance.\n\n\"But while professing this principle so broadly in words, you completely\nignored in practice half and vastly the greater half of its meaning. You\nwholly overlooked and disregarded the peril to which life is exposed on\nthe economic side--the hunger, cold, and thirst side. You went on the\ntheory that it was only by club, knife, bullet, poison, or some other\nform of physical violence that life could be endangered, as if hunger,\ncold, and thirst--in a word, economic want--were not a far more constant\nand more deadly foe to existence than all the forms of violence together.\nYou overlooked the plain fact that anybody who by any means, however\nindirect or remote, took away or curtailed one's means of subsistence\nattacked his life quite as dangerously as it could be done with knife or\nbullet--more so, indeed, seeing that against direct attack he would have\na better chance of defending himself. You failed to consider that no\namount of police, judicial, and military protection would prevent one\nfrom perishing miserably if he had not enough to eat and wear.\"\n\n\"We went on the theory,\" I said, \"that it was not well for the state to\nintervene to do for the individual or to help him to do what he was able\nto do for himself. We held that the collective organization should only\nbe appealed to when the power of the individual was manifestly unequal to\nthe task of self-defense.\"\n\n\"It was not so bad a theory if you had lived up to it,\" said the doctor,\n\"although the modern theory is far more rational that whatever can be\ndone better by collective than individual action ought to be so\nundertaken, even if it could, after a more imperfect fashion, be\nindividually accomplished. But don't you think that under the economic\nconditions which prevailed in America at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury, not to speak of Europe, the average man armed with a good\nrevolver would have found the task of protecting himself and family\nagainst violence a far easier one than that of protecting them against\nwant? Were not the odds against him far greater in the latter struggle\nthan they could have been, if he were a tolerably good shot, in the\nformer? Why, then, according to your own maxim, was the collective force\nof society devoted without stint to safeguarding him against violence,\nwhich he could have done for himself fairly well, while he was left to\nstruggle against hopeless odds for the means of a decent existence? What\nhour, of what day of what year ever passed in which the number of deaths,\nand the physical and moral anguish resulting from the anarchy of the\neconomic struggle and the crushing odds against the poor, did not\noutweigh as a hundred to one that same hour's record of death or\nsuffering resulting from violence? Far better would society have\nfulfilled its recognized duty of safeguarding the lives of its members\nif, repealing every criminal law and dismissing every judge and\npoliceman, it had left men to protect themselves as best they might\nagainst physical violence, while establishing in place of the machinery\nof criminal justice a system of economic administration whereby all would\nhave been guaranteed against want. If, indeed, it had but substituted\nthis collective economic organization for the criminal and judicial\nsystem it presently would have had as little need of the latter as we do,\nfor most of the crimes that plagued you were direct or indirect\nconsequences of your unjust economic conditions, and would have\ndisappeared with them.\n\n\"But excuse my vehemence. Remember that I am arraigning your civilization\nand not you. What I wanted to bring out is that the principle that the\nfirst duty of society is to safeguard the lives of its members was as\nfully admitted by your world as by ours, and that in failing to give the\nprinciple an economic as well as police, judicial, and military\ninterpretation, your world convicted itself of an inconsistency as\nglaring in logic as it was cruel in consequences. We, on the other hand,\nin assuming as a nation the responsibility of safeguarding the lives of\nthe people on the economic side, have merely, for the first time,\nhonestly carried out a principle as old as the civilized state.\"\n\n\"That is clear enough,\" I said. \"Any one, on the mere statement of the\ncase, would of course be bound to admit that the recognized duty of the\nstate to guarantee the life of the citizen against the action of his\nfellows does logically involve responsibility to protect him from\ninfluences attacking the economic basis of life quite as much as from\ndirect forcible assaults. The more advanced governments of my day, by\ntheir poor laws and pauper systems, in a dim way admitted this\nresponsibility, although the kind of provision they made for the\neconomically unfortunate was so meager and accompanied with such\nconditions of ignominy that men would ordinarily rather die than accept\nit. But grant that the sort of recognition we gave of the right of the\ncitizen to be guaranteed a subsistence was a mockery more brutal than its\ntotal denial would have been, and that a far larger interpretation of its\nduty in this respect was incumbent on the state, yet how does it\nlogically follow that society is bound to guarantee or the citizen to\ndemand an absolute economic equality?\"\n\n\"It is very true, as you say,\" answered the doctor, \"that the duty of\nsociety to guarantee every member the economic basis of his life might be\nafter some fashion discharged short of establishing economic equality.\nJust so in your day might the duty of the state to safeguard the lives of\ncitizens from physical violence have been discharged after a nominal\nfashion if it had contented itself with preventing outright murders,\nwhile leaving the people to suffer from one another's wantonness all\nmanner of violence not directly deadly; but tell me, Julian, were\ngovernments in your day content with so construing the limit of their\nduty to protect citizens from violence, or would the citizens have been\ncontent with such a limitation?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"A government which in your day,\" continued the doctor, \"had limited its\nundertaking to protect citizens from violence to merely preventing\nmurders would not have lasted a day. There were no people so barbarous as\nto have tolerated it. In fact, not only did all civilized governments\nundertake to protect citizens from assaults against their lives, but from\nany and every sort of physical assault and offense, however petty. Not\nonly might not a man so much as lay a finger on another in anger, but if\nhe only wagged his tongue against him maliciously he was laid by the\nheels in jail. The law undertook to protect men in their dignity as well\nas in their mere bodily integrity, rightly recognizing that to be\ninsulted or spit upon is as great a grievance as any assault upon life\nitself.\n\n\"Now, in undertaking to secure the citizen in his right to life on the\neconomic side, we do but studiously follow your precedents in\nsafeguarding him from direct assault. If we did but secure his economic\nbasis so far as to avert death by direct effect of hunger and cold as\nyour pauper laws made a pretense of doing, we should be like a State in\nyour day which forbade outright murder but permitted every kind of\nassault that fell short of it. Distress and deprivation resulting from\neconomic want falling short of actual starvation precisely correspond to\nthe acts of minor violence against which your State protected citizens as\ncarefully as against murder. The right of the citizen to have his life\nsecured him on the economic side can not therefore be satisfied by any\nprovision for bare subsistence, or by anything less than the means for\nthe fullest supply of every need which it is in the power of the nation\nby the thriftiest stewardship of the national resources to provide for\nall.\n\n\"That is to say, in extending the reign of law and public justice to the\nprotection and security of men's interests on the economic side, we have\nmerely followed, as we were reasonably bound to follow, your much-vaunted\nmaxim of 'equality before the law.' That maxim meant that in so far as\nsociety collectively undertook any governmental function, it must act\nabsolutely without respect of persons for the equal benefit of all.\nUnless, therefore, we were to reject the principle of 'equality before\nthe law,' it was impossible that society, having assumed charge of the\nproduction and distribution of wealth as a collective function, could\ndischarge it on any other principle than equality.\"\n\n\"If the court please,\" I said, \"I should like to be permitted at this\npoint to discontinue and withdraw my suit for the restoration of my\nformer property. In my day we used to hold on to all we had and fight for\nall we could get with a good stomach, for our rivals were as selfish as\nwe, and represented no higher right or larger view. But this modern\nsocial system with its public stewardship of all capital for the general\nwelfare quite changes the situation. It puts the man who demands more\nthan his share in the light of a person attacking the livelihood and\nseeking to impair the welfare of everybody else in the nation. To enjoy\nthat attitude anybody must be a good deal better convinced of the justice\nof his title than I ever was even in the old days.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHOW INEQUALITY OF WEALTH DESTROYS LIBERTY.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the doctor, \"I have stated only half the reason the\njudges would give wherefore they could not, by returning your wealth,\npermit the impairment of our collective economic system and the\nbeginnings of economic inequality in the nation. There is another great\nand equal right of all men which, though strictly included under the\nright of life, is by generous minds set even above it: I mean the right\nof liberty--that is to say, the right not only to live, but to live in\npersonal independence of one's fellows, owning only those common social\nobligations resting on all alike.\n\n\"Now, the duty of the state to safeguard the liberty of citizens was\nrecognized in your day just as was its duty to safeguard their lives, but\nwith the same limitation, namely, that the safeguard should apply only to\nprotect from attacks by violence. If it were attempted to kidnap a\ncitizen and reduce him by force to slavery, the state would interfere,\nbut not otherwise. Nevertheless, it was true in your day of liberty and\npersonal independence, as of life, that the perils to which they were\nchiefly exposed were not from force or violence, but resulted from\neconomic causes, the necessary consequences of inequalities of wealth.\nBecause the state absolutely ignored this side, which was incomparably\nthe largest side of the liberty question, its pretense of defending the\nliberties of citizens was as gross a mockery as that of guaranteeing\ntheir lives. Nay, it was a yet more absolute mockery and on a far vaster\nscale.\n\n\"For, although I have spoken of the monopolization of wealth and of the\nproductive machinery by a portion of the people as being first of all a\nthreat to the lives of the rest of the community and to be resisted as\nsuch, nevertheless the main practical effect of the system was not to\ndeprive the masses of mankind of life outright, but to force them,\nthrough want, to buy their lives by the surrender of their liberties.\nThat is to say, they accepted servitude to the possessing class and\nbecame their serfs on condition of receiving the means of subsistence.\nAlthough multitudes were always perishing from lack of subsistence, yet\nit was not the deliberate policy of the possessing class that they should\ndo so. The rich had no use for dead men; on the other hand, they had\nendless use for human beings as servants, not only to produce more\nwealth, but as the instruments of their pleasure and luxury.\n\n\"As I need not remind you who were familiar with it, the industrial\nsystem of the world before the great Revolution was wholly based upon the\ncompulsory servitude of the mass of mankind to the possessing class,\nenforced by the coercion of economic need.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I said, \"the poor as a class were in the economic service\nof the rich, or, as we used to say, labor was dependent on capital for\nemployment, but this service and employment had become in the nineteenth\ncentury an entirely voluntary relation on the part of the servant or\nemployee. The rich had no power to compel the poor to be their servants.\nThey only took such as came voluntarily to ask to be taken into service,\nand even begged to be, with tears. Surely a service so sought after could\nscarcely be called compulsory.\"\n\n\"Tell us, Julian,\" said the doctor, \"did the rich go to one another and\nask the privilege of being one another's servants or employees?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"Because, naturally, no one could wish to be another's servant or subject\nto his orders who could get along without it.\"\n\n\"I should suppose so, but why, then, did the poor so eagerly seek to\nserve the rich when the rich refused with scorn to serve one another? Was\nit because the poor so loved the rich?\"\n\n\"Scarcely.\"\n\n\"Why then?\"\n\n\"It was, of course, for the reason that it was the only way the poor\ncould get a living.\"\n\n\"You mean that it was only the pressure of want or the fear of it that\ndrove the poor to the point of becoming the servants of the rich?\"\n\n\"That is about it.\"\n\n\"And would you call that voluntary service? The distinction between\nforced service and such service as that would seem quite imperceptible to\nus. If a man may be said to do voluntarily that which only the pressure\nof bitter necessity compels him to elect to do, there has never been any\nsuch thing as slavery, for all the acts of a slave are at the last the\nacceptance of a less evil for fear of a worse. Suppose, Julian, you or a\nfew of you owned the main water supply, or food supply, clothing supply,\nland supply, or main industrial opportunities in a community and could\nmaintain your ownership, that fact alone would make the rest of the\npeople your slaves, would it not, and that, too, without any direct\ncompulsion on your part whatever?\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"Suppose somebody should charge you with holding the people under\ncompulsory servitude, and you should answer that you laid no hand on them\nbut that they willingly resorted to you and kissed your hands for the\nprivilege of being allowed to serve you in exchange for water, food, or\nclothing, would not that be a very transparent evasion on your part of\nthe charge of slaveholding?\"\n\n\"No doubt it would be.\"\n\n\"Well, and was not that precisely the relation the capitalists or\nemployers as a class held toward the rest of the community through their\nmonopolization of wealth and the machinery of production?\"\n\n\"I must say that it was.\"\n\n\"There was a great deal said by the economists of your day,\" the doctor\nwent on, \"about the freedom of contract--the voluntary, unconstrained\nagreement of the laborer with the employer as to the terms of his\nemployment. What hypocrisy could have been so brazen as that pretense\nwhen, as a matter of fact, every contract made between the capitalist who\nhad bread and could keep it and the laborer who must have it or die would\nhave been declared void, if fairly judged, even under your laws as a\ncontract made under duress of hunger, cold, and nakedness, nothing less\nthan the threat of death! If you own the things men must have, you own\nthe men who must have them.\"\n\n\"But the compulsion of want,\" said I, \"meaning hunger and cold, is a\ncompulsion of Nature. In that sense we are all under compulsory servitude\nto Nature.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not to one another. That is the whole difference between\nslavery and freedom. To-day no man serves another, but all the common\ngood in which we equally share. Under your system the compulsion of\nNature through the appropriation by the rich of the means of supplying\nNature's demands was turned into a club by which the rich made the poor\npay Nature's debt of labor not only for themselves but for the rich also,\nwith a vast overcharge besides for the needless waste of the system.\"\n\n\"You make out our system to have been little better than slavery. That is\na hard word.\"\n\n\"It is a very hard word, and we want above all things to be fair. Let us\nlook at the question. Slavery exists where there is a compulsory using of\nmen by other men for the benefit of the users. I think we are quite\nagreed that the poor man in your day worked for the rich only because his\nnecessities compelled him to. That compulsion varied in force according\nto the degree of want the worker was in. Those who had a little economic\nmeans would only render the lighter kinds of service on more or less easy\nand honorable conditions, while those who had less means or no means at\nall would do anything on any terms however painful or degrading. With the\nmass of the workers the compulsion of necessity was of the sharpest kind.\nThe chattel slave had the choice between working for his master and the\nlash. The wage-earner chose between laboring for an employer or starving.\nIn the older, cruder forms of slavery the masters had to be watching\nconstantly to prevent the escape of their slaves, and were troubled with\nthe charge of providing for them. Your system was more convenient, in\nthat it made Nature your taskmaster, and depended on her to keep your\nservants to the task. It was a difference between the direct exercise of\ncoercion, in which the slave was always on the point of rebellion, and an\nindirect coercion by which the same industrial result was obtained, while\nthe slave, instead of rebelling against his master's authority, was\ngrateful for the opportunity of serving him.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"the wage-earner received wages and the slave received\nnothing.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon. The slave received subsistence--clothing and\nshelter--and the wage-earner who could get more than these out of his\nwages was rarely fortunate. The rate of wages, except in new countries\nand under special conditions and for skilled workers, kept at about the\nsubsistence point, quite as often dropping below as rising above. The\nmain difference was that the master expended the subsistence wage of the\nchattel slave for him while the earner expended it for himself. This was\nbetter for the worker in some ways; in others less desirable, for the\nmaster out of self-interest usually saw that the chattel,\nchildren had enough; while the employer, having no stake in the life or\nhealth of the wage-earner, did not concern himself as to whether he lived\nor died. There were never any slave quarters so vile as the tenement\nhouses of the city slums where the wage-earners were housed.\"\n\n\"But at least,\" said I, \"there was this radical difference between the\nwage-earner of my day and the chattel slave: the former could leave his\nemployer at will, the latter could not.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is a difference, but one surely that told not so much in favor\nof as against the wage-earner. In all save temporarily fortunate\ncountries with sparse population the laborer would have been glad indeed\nto exchange the right to leave his employer for a guarantee that he would\nnot be discharged by him. Fear of losing his opportunity to work--his\njob, as you called it--was the nightmare of the laborer's life as it was\nreflected in the literature of your period. Was it not so?\"\n\nI had to admit that it was even so.\n\n\"The privilege of leaving one employer for another,\" pursued the doctor,\n\"even if it had not been more than balanced by the liability to\ndischarge, was of very little worth to the worker, in view of the fact\nthat the rate of wages was at about the same point wherever he might go,\nand the change would be merely a choice between the personal dispositions\nof different masters, and that difference was slight enough, for business\nrules controlled the relations of masters and men.\"\n\nI rallied once more.\n\n\"One point of real superiority at least you must admit the wage-earner\nhad over the chattel slave. He could by merit rise out of his condition\nand become himself an employer, a rich man.\"\n\n\"Surely, Julian, you forget that there has rarely been a slave system\nunder which the more energetic, intelligent, and thrifty slaves could and\ndid not buy their freedom or have it given them by their masters. The\nfreedmen in ancient Rome rose to places of importance and power quite as\nfrequently as did the born proletarian of Europe or America get out of\nhis condition.\"\n\nI did not think of anything to reply at the moment, and the doctor,\nhaving compassion on me, pursued: \"It is an old illustration of the\ndifferent view points of the centuries that precisely this point which\nyou make of the possibility of the wage-earner rising, although it was\ngetting to be a vanishing point in your day, seems to us the most truly\ndiabolical feature of the whole system. The prospect of rising as a\nmotive to reconcile the wage-earner or the poor man in general to his\nsubjection, what did it amount to? It was but saying to him, 'Be a good\nslave, and you, too, shall have slaves of your own.' By this wedge did\nyou separate the cleverer of the wage-workers from the mass of them and\ndignify treason to humanity by the name of ambition. No true man should\nwish to rise save to raise others with him.\"\n\n\"One point of difference, however, you must at least admit,\" I said. \"In\nchattel slavery the master had a power over the persons of his slaves\nwhich the employer did not have over even the poorest of his employees:\nhe could not lay his hand upon them in violence.\"\n\n\"Again, Julian,\" said the doctor, \"you have mentioned a point of\ndifference that tells in favor of chattel slavery as a more humane\nindustrial method than the wage system. If here and there the anger of\nthe chattel slave owner made him forget his self-restraint so far as to\ncripple or maim his slaves, yet such cases were on the whole rare, and\nsuch masters were held to an account by public opinion if not by law; but\nunder the wage system the employer had no motive of self-restraint to\nspare life or limb of his employees, and he escaped responsibility by the\nfact of the consent and even eagerness of the needy people to undertake\nthe most perilous and painful tasks for the sake of bread. We read that\nin the United States every year at least two hundred thousand men, women,\nand children were done to death or maimed in the performance of their\nindustrial duties, nearly forty thousand alone in the single branch of\nthe steam railroad service. No estimate seems to have ever been attempted\nof the many times greater number who perished more indirectly through the\ninjurious effects of bad industrial conditions. What chattel-slave system\never made a record of such wastefulness of human life, as that?\n\n\"Nay, more, the chattel-slave owner, if he smote his slave, did it in\nanger and, as likely as not, with some provocation; but these wholesale\nslaughters of wage-earners that made your land red were done in sheer\ncold-bloodedness, without any other motive on the part of the\ncapitalists, who were responsible, save gain.\n\n\"Still again, one of the more revolting features of chattel slavery has\nalways been considered the subjection of the slave women to the lust of\ntheir masters. How was it in this respect under the rule of the rich? We\nread in our histories that great armies of women in your day were forced\nby poverty to make a business of submitting their bodies to those who had\nthe means of furnishing them a little bread. The books say that these\narmies amounted in your great cities to bodies of thirty or forty\nthousand women. Tales come down to us of the magnitude of the maiden\ntribute levied upon the poorer classes for the gratification of the lusts\nof those who could pay, which the annals of antiquity could scarcely\nmatch for horror. Am I saying too much, Julian?\"\n\n\"You have mentioned nothing but facts which stared me in the face all my\nlife,\" I replied, \"and yet it appears I have had to wait for a man of\nanother century to tell me what they meant.\"\n\n\"It was precisely because they stared you and your contemporaries so\nconstantly in the face, and always had done so, that you lost the faculty\nof judging their meaning. They were, as we might say, too near the eyes\nto be seen aright. You are far enough away from the facts now to begin to\nsee them clearly and to realize their significance. As you shall continue\nto occupy this modern view point, you will more and more completely come\nto see with us that the most revolting aspect of the human condition\nbefore the great Revolution was not the suffering from physical privation\nor even the outright starvation of multitudes which directly resulted\nfrom the unequal distribution of wealth, but the indirect effect of that\ninequality to reduce almost the total human race to a state of degrading\nbondage to their fellows. As it seems to us, the offense of the old order\nagainst liberty was even greater than the offense to life; and even if it\nwere conceivable that it could have satisfied the right of life by\nguaranteeing abundance to all, it must just the same have been destroyed,\nfor, although the collective administration of the economic system had\nbeen unnecessary to guarantee life, there could be no such thing as\nliberty so long as by the effect of inequalities of wealth and the\nprivate control of the means of production the opportunity of men to\nobtain the means of subsistence depended on the will of other men.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nPRIVATE CAPITAL STOLEN FROM THE SOCIAL FUND.\n\n\"I observe,\" pursued the doctor, \"that Edith is getting very impatient\nwith these dry disquisitions, and thinks it high time we passed from\nwealth in the abstract to wealth in the concrete, as illustrated by the\ncontents of your safe. I will delay the company only while I say a very\nfew words more; but really this question of the restoration of your\nmillion, raised half in jest as it was, so vitally touches the central\nand fundamental principle of our social order that I want to give you at\nleast an outline idea of the modern ethics of wealth distribution.\n\n\"The essential difference between the new and the old point of view you\nfully possess by this time. The old ethics conceived of the question of\nwhat a man might rightfully possess as one which began and ended with the\nrelation of individuals to things. Things have no rights as against moral\nbeings, and there was no reason, therefore, in the nature of the case as\nthus stated, why individuals should not acquire an unlimited ownership of\nthings so far as their abilities permitted. But this view absolutely\nignored the social consequences which result from an unequal distribution\nof material things in a world where everybody absolutely depends for life\nand all its uses on their share of those things. That is to say, the old\nso-called ethics of property absolutely overlooked the whole ethical side\nof the subject--namely, its bearing on human relations. It is precisely\nthis consideration which furnishes the whole basis of the modern ethics\nof property. All human beings are equal in rights and dignity, and only\nsuch a system of wealth distribution can therefore be defensible as\nrespects and secures those equalities. But while this is the principle\nwhich you will hear most generally stated as the moral ground of our\neconomic equality, there is another quite sufficient and wholly different\nground on which, even if the rights of life and liberty were not\ninvolved, we should yet maintain that equal sharing of the total product\nof industry was the only just plan, and that any other was robbery.\n\n\"The main factor in the production of wealth among civilized men is the\nsocial organism, the machinery of associated labor and exchange by which\nhundreds of millions of individuals provide the demand for one another's\nproduct and mutually complement one another's labors, thereby making the\nproductive and distributive systems of a nation and of the world one\ngreat machine. This was true even under private capitalism, despite the\nprodigious waste and friction of its methods; but of course it is a far\nmore important truth now when the machinery of co-operation runs with\nabsolute smoothness and every ounce of energy is utilized to the utmost\neffect. The element in the total industrial product which is due to the\nsocial organism is represented by the difference between the value of\nwhat one man produces as a worker in connection with the social\norganization and what he could produce in a condition of isolation.\nWorking in concert with his fellows by aid of the social organism, he and\nthey produce enough to support all in the highest luxury and refinement.\nToiling in isolation, human experience has proved that he would be\nfortunate if he could at the utmost produce enough to keep himself alive.\nIt is estimated, I believe, that the average daily product of a worker in\nAmerica to-day is some fifty dollars. The product of the same man working\nin isolation would probably be highly estimated on the same basis of\ncalculation if put at a quarter of a dollar. Now tell me, Julian, to whom\nbelongs the social organism, this vast machinery of human association,\nwhich enhances some two hundredfold the product of every one's labor?\"\n\n\"Manifestly,\" I replied, \"it can belong to no one in particular, but to\nnothing less than society collectively. Society collectively can be the\nonly heir to the social inheritance of intellect and discovery, and it is\nsociety collectively which furnishes the continuous daily concourse by\nwhich alone that inheritance is made effective.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. The social organism, with all that it is and all it makes\npossible, is the indivisible inheritance of all in common. To whom, then,\nproperly belongs that two hundredfold enhancement of the value of every\none's labor which is owing to the social organism?\"\n\n\"Manifestly to society collectively--to the general fund.\"\n\n\"Previous to the great Revolution,\" pursued the doctor. \"Although there\nseems to have been a vague idea of some such social fund as this, which\nbelonged to society collectively, there was no clear conception of its\nvastness, and no custodian of it, or possible provision to see that it\nwas collected and applied for the common use. A public organization of\nindustry, a nationalized economic system, was necessary before the social\nfund could be properly protected and administered. Until then it must\nneeds be the subject of universal plunder and embezzlement. The social\nmachinery was seized upon by adventurers and made a means of enriching\nthemselves by collecting tribute from the people to whom it belonged and\nwhom it should have enriched. It would be one way of describing the\neffect of the Revolution to say that it was only the taking possession by\nthe people collectively of the social machinery which had always belonged\nto them, thenceforth to be conducted as a public plant, the returns of\nwhich were to go to the owners as the equal proprietors and no longer to\nbuccaneers.\n\n\"You will readily see,\" the doctor went on, \"how this analysis of the\nproduct of industry must needs tend to minimize the importance of the\npersonal equation of performance as between individual workers. If the\nmodern man, by aid of the social machinery, can produce fifty dollars'\nworth of product where he could produce not over a quarter of a dollar's\nworth without society, then forty-nine dollars and three quarters out of\nevery fifty dollars must be credited to the social fund to be equally\ndistributed. The industrial efficiency of two men working without society\nmight have differed as two to one--that is, while one man was able to\nproduce a full quarter dollar's worth of work a day, the other could\nproduce only twelve and a half cents' worth. This was a very great\ndifference under those circumstances, but twelve and a half cents is so\nslight a proportion of fifty dollars as not to be worth mentioning. That\nis to say, the difference in individual endowments between the two men\nwould remain the same, but that difference would be reduced to relative\nunimportance by the prodigious equal addition made to the product of both\nalike by the social organism. Or again, before gunpowder was invented one\nman might easily be worth two as a warrior. The difference between the\nmen as individuals remained what it was; yet the overwhelming factor\nadded to the power of both alike by the gun practically equalized them as\nfighters. Speaking of guns, take a still better illustration--the\nrelation of the individual soldiers in a square of infantry to the\nformation. There might be large differences in the fighting power of the\nindividual soldiers singly outside the ranks. Once in the ranks, however,\nthe formation added to the fighting efficiency of every soldier equally\nan element so overwhelming as to dwarf the difference between the\nindividual efficiency of different men. Say, for instance, that the\nformation added ten to the fighting force of every member, then the man\nwho outside the ranks was as two to one in power compared with his\ncomrade would, when they both stood in the ranks, compare with him only\nas twelve to eleven--an inconsiderable difference.\n\n\"I need scarcely point out to you, Julian, the bearing of the principle\nof the social fund on economic equality when the industrial system was\nnationalized. It made it obvious that even if it were possible to figure\nout in a satisfactory manner the difference in the industrial products\nwhich in an accounting with the social fund could be respectively\ncredited to differences in individual performance, the result would not\nbe worth the trouble. Even the worker of special ability, who might hope\nto gain most by it, could not hope to gain so much as he would lose in\ncommon with others by sacrificing the increased efficiency of the\nindustrial machinery that would result from the sentiment of solidarity\nand public spirit among the workers arising from a feeling of complete\nunity of interest.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I exclaimed, \"I like that idea of the social fund immensely! It\nmakes me understand, among other things, the completeness with which you\nseem to have outgrown the wages notion, which in one form or other was\nfundamental to all economic thought in my day. It is because you are\naccustomed to regarding the social capital rather than your day-to-day\nspecific exertions as the main source of your wealth. It is, in a word,\nthe difference between the attitude of the capitalist and the\nproletarian.\"\n\n\"Even so,\" said the doctor. \"The Revolution made us all capitalists, and\nthe idea of the dividend has driven out that of the stipend. We take\nwages only in honor. From our point of view as to the collective\nownership of the economic machinery of the social system, and the\nabsolute claim of society collectively to its product, there is something\namusing in the laborious disputations by which your contemporaries used\nto try to settle just how much or little wages or compensation for\nservices this or that individual or group was entitled to. Why, dear me,\nJulian, if the cleverest worker were limited to his own product, strictly\nseparated and distinguished from the elements by which the use of the\nsocial machinery had multiplied it, he would fare no better than a\nhalf-starved savage. Everybody is entitled not only to his own product,\nbut to vastly more--namely, to his share of the product of the social\norganism, in addition to his personal product, but he is entitled to this\nshare not on the grab-as-grab-can plan of your day, by which some made\nthemselves millionaires and others were left beggars, but on equal terms\nwith all his fellow-capitalists.\"\n\n\"The idea of an unearned increment given to private properties by the\nsocial organism was talked of in my day,\" I said, \"but only, as I\nremember, with reference to land values. There were reformers who held\nthat society had the right to take in taxes all increase in value of land\nthat resulted from social factors, such as increased population or public\nimprovements, but they seemed to think the doctrine applicable to land\nonly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"and it is rather odd that, having hold of the\nclew, they did not follow it up.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nWE LOOK OVER MY COLLECTION OF HARNESSES.\n\nWires for light and heat had been put into the vault, and it was as warm\nand bright and habitable a place as it had been a century before, when it\nwas my sleeping chamber. Kneeling before the door of the safe, I at once\naddressed myself to manipulating the dial, my companions meanwhile\nleaning over me in attitudes of eager interest.\n\nIt had been one hundred years since I locked the safe the last time, and\nunder ordinary circumstances that would have been long enough for me to\nforget the combination several times over, but it was as fresh in my mind\nas if I had devised it a fortnight before, that being, in fact, the\nentire length of the intervening period so far as my conscious life was\nconcerned.\n\n\"You observe,\" I said, \"that I turn this dial until the letter 'K' comes\nopposite the letter 'R.' Then I move this other dial till the number '9'\ncomes opposite the same point. Now the safe is practically unlocked. All\nI have to do to open it is to turn this knob, which moves the bolts, and\nthen swing the door open, as you see.\"\n\nBut they did not see just then, for the knob would not turn, the lock\nremaining fast. I knew that I had made no mistake about the combination.\nSome of the tumblers in the lock had failed to fall. I tried it over\nagain several times and thumped the dial and the door, but it was of no\nuse. The lock remained stubborn. One might have said that its memory was\nnot as good as mine. It had forgotten the combination. A materialistic\nexplanation somewhat more probable was that the oil in the lock had been\nhardened by time so as to offer a slight resistance. The lock could not\nhave rusted, for the atmosphere of the room had been absolutely dry.\nOtherwise I should not have survived.\n\n\"I am sorry to disappoint you,\" I said, \"but we shall have to send to the\nheadquarters of the safe manufacturers for a locksmith. I used to know\njust where in Sudbury Street to go, but I suppose the safe business has\nmoved since then.\"\n\n\"It has not merely moved,\" said the doctor, \"it has disappeared; there\nare safes like this at the historical museum, but I never knew how they\nwere opened until now. It is really very ingenious.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say that there are actually no locksmiths to-day who\ncould open this safe?\"\n\n\"Any machinist can cut the steel like cardboard,\" replied the doctor;\n\"but really I don't believe there is a man in the world who could pick\nthe lock. We have, of course, simple locks to insure privacy and keep\nchildren out of mischief, but nothing calculated to offer serious\nresistance either to force or cunning. The craft of the locksmith is\nextinct.\"\n\nAt this Edith, who was impatient to see the safe opened, exclaimed that\nthe twentieth century had nothing to boast of if it could not solve a\npuzzle which any clever burglar of the nineteenth century was equal to.\n\n\"From the point of view of an impatient young woman it may seem so,\" said\nthe doctor. \"But we must remember that lost arts often are monuments of\nhuman progress, indicating outgrown limitations and necessities, to which\nthey ministered. It is because we have no more thieves that we have no\nmore locksmiths. Poor Julian had to go to all this pains to protect the\npapers in that safe, because if he lost them he would be left a beggar,\nand, from being one of the masters of the many, would have become one of\nthe servants of the few, and perhaps be tempted to turn burglar himself.\nNo wonder locksmiths were in demand in those days. But now you see, even\nsupposing any one in a community enjoying universal and equal wealth\ncould wish to steal anything, there is nothing that he could steal with a\nview to selling it again. Our wealth consists in the guarantee of an\nequal share in the capital and income of the nation--a guarantee that is\npersonal and can not be taken from us nor given away, being vested in\neach one at birth, and divested only by death. So you see the locksmith\nand safe-maker would be very useless persons.\"\n\nAs we talked, I had continued to work the dial in the hope that the\nobstinate tumbler might be coaxed to act, and presently a faint click\nrewarded my efforts and I swung the door open.\n\n\"Faugh!\" exclaimed Edith at the musty gust of confined air which\nfollowed. \"I am sorry for your people if that is a fair sample of what\nyou had to breathe.\"\n\n\"It is probably about the only sample left, at any rate,\" observed the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Dear me! what a ridiculous little box it turns out to be for such a\npretentious outside!\" exclaimed Edith's mother.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"The thick walls are to make the contents fireproof as\nwell as burglar-proof--and, by the way, I should think you would need\nfireproof safes still.\"\n\n\"We have no fires, except in the old structures,\" replied the doctor.\n\"Since building was undertaken by the people collectively, you see we\ncould not afford to have them, for destruction of property means to the\nnation a dead loss, while under private capitalism the loss might be\nshuffled off on others in all sorts of ways. They could get insured, but\nthe nation has to insure itself.\"\n\nOpening the inner door of the safe, I took out several drawers full of\nsecurities of all sorts, and emptied them on the table in the room.\n\n\"Are these stuffy-looking papers what you used to call wealth?\" said\nEdith, with evident disappointment.\n\n\"Not the papers in themselves,\" I said, \"but what they represented.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\" she asked.\n\n\"The ownership of land, houses, mills, ships, railroads, and all manner\nof other things,\" I replied, and went on as best I could to explain to\nher mother and herself about rents, profits, interest, dividends, etc.\nBut it was evident, from the blank expression of their countenances, that\nI was not making much headway.\n\nPresently the doctor looked up from the papers which he was devouring\nwith the zeal of an antiquarian, and chuckled.\n\n\"I am afraid, Julian, you are on the wrong tack. You see economic science\nin your day was a science of things; in our day it is a science of human\nbeings. We have nothing at all answering to your rent, interest, profits,\nor other financial devices, and the terms expressing them have no meaning\nnow except to students. If you wish Edith and her mother to understand\nyou, you must translate these money terms into terms of men and women and\nchildren, and the plain facts of their relations as affected by your\nsystem. Shall you consider it impertinent if I try to make the matter a\nlittle clearer to them?\"\n\n\"I shall be much obliged to you,\" I said; \"and perhaps you will at the\nsame time make it clearer to me.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the doctor, \"that we shall all understand the nature and\nvalue of these documents much better if, instead of speaking of them as\ntitles of ownership in farms, factories, mines, railroads, etc., we state\nplainly that they were evidences that their possessors were the masters\nof various groups of men, women, and children in different parts of the\ncountry. Of course, as Julian says, the documents nominally state his\ntitle to things only, and say nothing about men and women. But it is the\nmen and women who went with the lands, the machines, and various other\nthings, and were bound to them by their bodily necessities, which gave\nall the value to the possession of the things.\n\n\"But for the implication that there were men who, because they must have\nthe use of the land, would submit to labor for the owner of it in return\nfor permission to occupy it, these deeds and mortgages would have been of\nno value. So of these factory shares. They speak only of water power and\nlooms, but they would be valueless but for the thousands of human workers\nbound to the machines by bodily necessities as fixedly as if they were\nchained there. So of these coal-mine shares. But for the multitude of\nwretched beings condemned by want to labor in living graves, of what\nvalue would have been these shares which yet make no mention of them? And\nsee again how significant is the fact that it was deemed needless to make\nmention of and to enumerate by name these serfs of the field, of the\nloom, of the mine! Under systems of chattel slavery, such as had formerly\nprevailed, it was necessary to name and identify each chattel, that he\nmight be recovered in case of escape, and an account made of the loss in\ncase of death. But there was no danger of loss by the escape or the death\nof the serfs transferred by these documents. They would not run away, for\nthere was nothing better to run to or any escape from the world-wide\neconomic system which enthralled them; and if they died, that involved no\nloss to their owners, for there were always plenty more to take their\nplaces. Decidedly, it would have been a waste of paper to enumerate them.\n\n\"Just now at the breakfast table,\" continued the doctor, \"I was\nexplaining the modern view of the economic system of private capitalism\nas one based on the compulsory servitude of the masses to the\ncapitalists, a servitude which the latter enforced by monopolizing the\nbulk of the world's resources and machinery, leaving the pressure of want\nto compel the masses to accept their yoke, the police and soldiers\nmeanwhile defending them in their monopolies. These documents turn up in\na very timely way to illustrate the ingenious and effectual methods by\nwhich the different sorts of workers were organized for the service of\nthe capitalists. To use a plain illustration, these various sorts of\nso-called securities may be described as so many kinds of human harness\nby which the masses, broken and tamed by the pressure of want, were yoked\nand strapped to the chariots of the capitalists.\n\n\"For instance, here is a bundle of farm mortgages on Kansas farms. Very\ngood; by virtue of the operation of this security certain Kansas farmers\nworked for the owner of it, and though they might never know who he was\nnor he who they were, yet they were as securely and certainly his thralls\nas if he had stood over them with a whip instead of sitting in his parlor\nat Boston, New York, or London. This mortgage harness was generally used\nto hitch in the agricultural class of the population. Most of the farmers\nof the West were pulling in it toward the end of the nineteenth\ncentury.--Was it not so, Julian? Correct me if I am wrong.\"\n\n\"You are stating the facts very accurately,\" I answered. \"I am beginning\nto understand more clearly the nature of my former property.\"\n\n\"Now let us see what this bundle is,\" pursued the doctor. \"Ah! yes; these\nare shares in New England cotton factories. This sort of harness was\nchiefly used for women and children, the sizes ranging away down so as to\nfit girls and boys of eleven and twelve. It used to be said that it was\nonly the margin of profit furnished by the almost costless labor of the\nlittle children that made these factories paying properties. The\npopulation of New England was largely broken in at a very tender age to\nwork in this style of harness.\n\n\"Here, now, is a little different sort. These are railroad, gas, and\nwater-works shares. They were a sort of comprehensive harness, by which\nnot only a particular class of workers but whole communities were hitched\nin and made to work for the owner of the security.\n\n\"And, finally, we have here the strongest harness of all, the Government\nbond. This document, you sec, is a bond of the United States Government.\nBy it seventy million people--the whole nation, in fact--were harnessed\nto the coach of the owner of this bond; and, what was more, the driver in\nthis case was the Government itself, against which the team would find it\nhard to kick. There was a great deal of kicking and balking in the other\nsorts of harness, and the capitalists were often inconvenienced and\ntemporarily deprived of the labor of the men they had bought and paid for\nwith good money. Naturally, therefore, the Government bond was greatly\nprized by them as an investment. They used every possible effort to\ninduce the various governments to put more and more of this sort of\nharness on the people, and the governments, being carried on by the\nagents of the capitalists, of course kept on doing so, up to the very eve\nof the great Revolution, which was to turn the bonds and all the other\nharnesses into waste paper.\"\n\n\"As a representative of the nineteenth century,\" I said, \"I can not deny\nthe substantial correctness of your rather startling way of describing\nour system of investments. Still, you will admit that, bad as the system\nwas and bitter as was the condition of the masses under it, the function\nperformed by the capitalists in organizing and directing such industry as\nwe had was a service to the world of some value.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" replied the doctor. \"The same plea might be\nurged, and has been, in defense of every system by which men have ever\nmade other men their servants from the beginning. There was always some\nservice, generally valuable and indispensable, which the oppressors could\nurge and did urge as the ground and excuse of the servitude they\nenforced. As men grew wiser they observed that they were paying a ruinous\nprice for the services thus rendered. So at first they said to the kings:\n'To be sure, you help defend the state from foreigners and hang thieves,\nbut it is too much to ask us to be your serfs in exchange; we can do\nbetter.' And so they established republics. So also, presently, the\npeople said to the priests: 'You have done something for us, but you have\ncharged too much for your services in asking us to submit our minds to\nyou; we can do better.' And so they established religious liberty.\n\n\"And likewise, in this last matter we are speaking of, the people finally\nsaid to the capitalists: 'Yes, you have organized our industry, but at\nthe price of enslaving us. We can do better.' And substituting national\nco-operation for capitalism, they established the industrial republic\nbased on economic democracy. If it were true, Julian, that any\nconsideration of service rendered to others, however valuable, could\nexcuse the benefactors for making bondmen of the benefited, then there\nnever was a despotism or slave system which could not excuse itself.\"\n\n\"Haven't you some real money to show us,\" said Edith, \"something besides\nthese papers--some gold and silver such as they have at the museum?\"\n\nIt was not customary in the nineteenth century for people to keep large\nsupplies of ready money in their houses, but for emergencies I had a\nlittle stock of it in my safe, and in response to Edith's request I took\nout a drawer containing several hundred dollars in gold and emptied it on\nthe table.\n\n\"How pretty they are!\" exclaimed Edith, thrusting her hands in the pile\nof yellow coins and clinking them together. \"And is it really true that\nif you only had enough of these things, no matter how or where you got\nthem, men and women would submit themselves to you and let you make what\nuse you pleased of them?\"\n\n\"Not only would they let you use them as you pleased, but they would be\nextremely grateful to you for being so good as to use them instead of\nothers. The poor fought each other for the privilege of being the\nservants and underlings of those who had the money.\"\n\n\"Now I see,\" said Edith, \"what the Masters of the Bread meant.\"\n\n\"What is that about Masters of the Bread?\" I asked. \"Who were they?\"\n\n\"It was a name given to the capitalists in the revolutionary period,\"\nreplied the doctor. \"This thing Edith speaks of is a scrap of the\nliterature of that time, when the people first began to fully wake up to\nthe fact that class monopoly of the machinery of production meant slavery\nfor the mass.\"\n\n\"Let me see if I can recall it,\" said Edith. \"It begins this way:\n'Everywhere men, women, and children stood in the market-place crying to\nthe Masters of the Bread to take them to be their servants, that they\nmight have bread. The strong men said: \"O Lords of the Bread, feel our\nthews and sinews, our arms and our legs; see how strong we are. Take us\nand use us. Let us dig for you. Let us hew for you. Let us go down in the\nmine and delve for you. Let us freeze and starve in the forecastles of\nyour ships. Send us into the hells of your steamship stokeholes. Do what\nyou will with us, but let us serve you, that we may eat and not die!\"\n\n\"'Then spoke up also the learned men, the scribes and the lawyers, whose\nstrength was in their brains and not in their bodies: \"O Masters of the\nBread,\" they said, \"take us to be your servants and to do your will. See\nhow fine is our wit, how great our knowledge; our minds are stored with\nthe treasures of learning and the subtlety of all the philosophies. To us\nhas been given clearer vision than to others, and the power of persuasion\nthat we should be leaders of the people, voices to the voiceless, and\neyes to the blind. But the people whom we should serve have no bread to\ngive us. Therefore, Masters of the Bread, give us to eat, and we will\nbetray the people to you, for we must live. We will plead for you in the\ncourts against the widow and the fatherless. We will speak and write in\nyour praise, and with cunning words confound those who speak against you\nand your power and state. And nothing that you require of us shall seem\ntoo much. But because we sell not only our bodies, but our souls also,\ngive us more bread than these laborers receive, who sell their bodies\nonly.\"\n\n\"'And the priests and Levites also cried out as the Lords of the Bread\npassed through the market-place: \"Take us, Masters, to be your servants\nand to do your will, for we also must eat, and you only have the bread.\nWe are the guardians of the sacred oracles, and the people hearken unto\nus and reply not, for our voice to them is as the voice of God. But we\nmust have bread to eat like others. Give us therefore plentifully of your\nbread, and we will speak to the people, that they be still and trouble\nyou not with their murmurings because of hunger. In the name of God the\nFather will we forbid them to claim the rights of brothers, and in the\nname of the Prince of Peace will we preach your law of competition.\"\n\n\"'And above all the clamor of the men were heard the voices of a\nmultitude of women crying to the Masters of the Bread: \"Pass us not by,\nfor we must also eat. The men are stronger than we, but they eat much\nbread while we eat little, so that though we be not so strong yet in the\nend you shall not lose if you take us to be your servants instead of\nthem. And if you will not take us for our labor's sake, yet look upon us:\nwe are women, and should be fair in your eyes. Take us and do with us\naccording to your pleasure, for we must eat.\"\n\n\"'And above all the chaffering of the market, the hoarse voices of the\nmen, and the shrill voices of the women, rose the piping treble of the\nlittle children, crying: \"Take us to be your servants, for the breasts of\nour mothers are dry and our fathers have no bread for us, and we hunger.\nWe are weak, indeed, but we ask so little, so very little, that at last\nwe shall be cheaper to you than the men, our fathers, who eat so much,\nand the women, our mothers, who eat more than we.\"\n\n\"'And the Masters of the Bread, having taken for their use or pleasure\nsuch of the men, the women, and the little ones as they saw fit, passed\nby. And there was left a great multitude in the market-place for whom\nthere was no bread.'\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the doctor, breaking the silence which followed the ceasing of\nEdith's voice, \"it was indeed the last refinement of indignity put upon\nhuman nature by your economic system that it compelled men to seek the\nsale of themselves. Voluntary in a real sense the sale was not, of\ncourse, for want or the fear of it left no choice as to the necessity of\nselling themselves to somebody, but as to the particular transaction\nthere was choice enough to make it shameful. They had to seek those to\nwhom to offer themselves and actively to procure their own purchase. In\nthis respect the submission of men to other men through the relation of\nhire was more abject than under a slavery resting directly on force. In\nthat case the slave might be compelled to yield to physical duress, but\nhe could still keep a mind free and resentful toward his master; but in\nthe relation of hire men sought for their masters and begged as a favor\nthat they would use them, body and mind, for their profit or pleasure. To\nthe view of us moderns, therefore, the chattel slave was a more dignified\nand heroic figure than the hireling of your day who called himself a free\nworker.\n\n\"It was possible for the slave to rise in soul above his circumstances\nand be a philosopher in bondage like Epictetus, but the hireling could\nnot scorn the bonds he sought. The abjectness of his position was not\nmerely physical but mental. In selling himself he had necessarily sold\nhis independence of mind also. Your whole industrial system seems in this\npoint of view best and most fitly described by a word which you oddly\nenough reserved to designate a particular phase of self-selling practiced\nby women.\n\n\"Labor for others in the name of love and kindness, and labor with others\nfor a common end in which all are mutually interested, and labor for its\nown joy, are alike honorable, but the hiring out of our faculties to the\nselfish uses of others, which was the form labor generally took in your\nday, is unworthy of human nature. The Revolution for the first time in\nhistory made labor truly honorable by putting it on the basis of\nfraternal co-operation for a common and equally shared result. Until then\nit was at best but a shameful necessity.\"\n\nPresently I said: \"When you have satisfied your curiosity as to these\npapers I suppose we might as well make a bonfire of them, for they seem\nto have no more value now than a collection of heathen fetiches after the\nformer worshipers have embraced Christianity.\"\n\n\"Well, and has not such a collection a value to the student of history?\"\nsaid the doctor. \"Of course, these documents are scarcely now valuable in\nthe sense they were, but in another they have much value. I see among\nthem several varieties which are quite scarce in the historical\ncollections, and if you feel disposed to present the whole lot to our\nmuseum I am sure the gift will be much appreciated. The fact is, the\ngreat bonfire our grandfathers made, while a very natural and excusable\nexpression of jubilation over broken bondage, is much to be regretted\nfrom an archaeological point of view.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by the great bonfire?\" I inquired.\n\n\"It was a rather dramatic incident at the close of the great Revolution.\nWhen the long struggle was ended and economic equality, guaranteed by the\npublic administration of capital, had been established, the people got\ntogether from all parts of the land enormous collections of what you used\nto call the evidences of value, which, while purporting to be\ncertificates of property in things, had been really certificates of the\nownership of men, deriving, as we have seen, their whole value from the\nserfs attached to the things by the constraint of bodily necessities.\nThese it pleased the people--exalted, as you may well imagine, by the\nafflatus of liberty--to collect in a vast mass on the site of the New\nYork Stock Exchange, the great altar of Plutus, whereon millions of human\nbeings had been sacrificed to him, and there to make a bonfire of them. A\ngreat pillar stands on the spot to-day, and from its summit a mighty\ntorch of electric flame is always streaming, in commemoration of that\nevent and as a testimony forever to the ending of the parchment bondage\nthat was heavier than the scepters of kings. It is estimated that\ncertificates of ownership in human beings, or, as you called them, titles\nto property, to the value of forty billion dollars, together with\nhundreds of millions of paper money, went up in that great blaze, which\nwe devoutly consider must have been, of all the innumerable burnt\nsacrifices which have been offered up to God from the beginning, the one\nthat pleased him best.\n\n\"Now, if I had been there, I can easily imagine that I should have\nrejoiced over that conflagration as much as did the most exultant of\nthose who danced about it; but from the calmer point of view of the\npresent I regret the destruction of a mass of historic material. So you\nsee that your bonds and deeds and mortgages and shares of stock are\nreally valuable still.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nWHAT WE WERE COMING TO BUT FOR THE REVOLUTION.\n\n\"We read in the histories,\" said Edith's mother, \"much about the amazing\nextent to which particular individuals and families succeeded in\nconcentrating in their own hands the natural resources, industrial\nmachinery, and products of the several countries. Julian had only a\nmillion dollars, but many individuals or families had, we are told,\nwealth amounting to fifty, a hundred, and even two or three hundred\nmillions. We read of infants who in the cradle were heirs of hundreds of\nmillions. Now, something I never saw mentioned in the books was the\nlimit, for there must have been some limit fixed, to which one individual\nmight appropriate the earth's surface and resources, the means of\nproduction, and the products of labor.\"\n\n\"There was no limit,\" I replied.\n\n\"Do you mean,\" exclaimed Edith, \"that if a man were only clever and\nunscrupulous enough he might appropriate, say, the entire territory of a\ncountry and leave the people actually nothing to stand on unless by his\nconsent?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"In fact, in many countries of the Old World\nindividuals owned whole provinces, and in the United States even vaster\ntracts had passed and were passing into private and corporate hands.\nThere was no limit whatever to the extent of land which one person might\nown, and of course this ownership implied the right to evict every human\nbeing from the territory unless the owner chose to let individuals remain\non payment of tribute.\"\n\n\"And how about other things besides land?\" asked Edith.\n\n\"It was the same,\" I said. \"There was no limit to the extent to which an\nindividual might acquire the exclusive ownership of all the factories,\nshops, mines, and means of industry, and commerce of every sort, so that\nno person could find an opportunity to earn a living except as the\nservant of the owner and on his terms.\"\n\n\"If we are correctly informed,\" said the doctor, \"the concentration of\nthe ownership of the machinery of production and distribution, trade and\nindustry, had already, before you fell asleep, been carried to a point in\nthe United States through trusts and syndicates which excited general\nalarm.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"It was then already in the power of a score of\nmen in New York city to stop at will every car-wheel in the United\nStates, and the combined action of a few other groups of capitalists\nwould have sufficed practically to arrest the industries and commerce of\nthe entire country, forbid employment to everybody, and starve the entire\npopulation. The self-interest of these capitalists in keeping business\ngoing on was the only ground of assurance the rest of the people had for\ntheir livelihood from day to day. Indeed, when the capitalists desired to\ncompel the people to vote as they wished, it was their regular custom to\nthreaten to stop the industries of the country and produce a business\ncrisis if the election did not go to suit them.\"\n\n\"Suppose, Julian, an individual or family or group of capitalists, having\nbecome sole owners of all the land and machinery of one nation, should\nwish to go on and acquire the sole ownership of all the land and economic\nmeans and machinery of the whole earth, would that have been inconsistent\nwith your law of property?\"\n\n\"Not at all. If one individual, as you suggest, through the effect of\ncunning and skill combined with inheritances, should obtain a legal title\nto the whole globe, it would be his to do what he pleased with as\nabsolutely as if it were a garden patch, according to our law of\nproperty. Nor is your supposition about one person or family becoming\nowner of the whole earth a wholly fanciful one. There was, when I fell\nasleep, one family of European bankers whose world-wide power and\nresources were so vast and increasing at such a prodigious and\naccelerating rate that they had already an influence over the destinies\nof nations wider than perhaps any monarch ever exercised.\"\n\n\"And if I understand your system, if they had gone on and attained the\nownership of the globe to the lowest inch of standing room at low tide,\nit would have been the legal right of that family or single individual,\nin the name of the sacred right of property, to give the people of the\nhuman race legal notice to move off the earth, and in case of their\nfailure to comply with the requirement of the notice, to call upon them\nin the name of the law to form themselves into sheriffs' _posses_\nand evict themselves from the earth's surface?\"\n\n\"Unquestionably.\"\n\n\"O father,\" exclaimed Edith, \"you and Julian are trying to make fun of\nus. You must think we will believe anything if you only keep straight\nfaces. But you are going too far.\"\n\n\"I do not wonder you think so,\" said the doctor. \"But you can easily\nsatisfy yourself from the books that we have in no way exaggerated the\npossibilities of the old system of property. What was called under that\nsystem the right of property meant the unlimited right of anybody who was\nclever enough to deprive everybody else of any property whatever.\"\n\n\"It would seem, then,\" said Edith, \"that the dream of world conquest by\nan individual, if ever realized, was more likely under the old _regime\n_ to be realized by economic than by military means.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the doctor. \"Alexander and Napoleon mistook their\ntrade; they should have been bankers, not soldiers. But, indeed, the time\nwas not in their day ripe for a world-wide money dynasty, such as we have\nbeen speaking of. Kings had a rude way of interfering with the so-called\nrights of property when they conflicted with royal prestige or produced\ndangerous popular discontent. Tyrants themselves, they did not willingly\nbrook rival tyrants in their dominions. It was not till the kings had\nbeen shorn of power and the interregnum of sham democracy had set in,\nleaving no virile force in the state or the world to resist the money\npower, that the opportunity for a world-wide plutocratic despotism\narrived. Then, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, when\ninternational trade and financial relations had broken down national\nbarriers and the world had become one field of economic enterprise, did\nthe idea of a universally dominant and centralized money power become not\nonly possible, but, as Julian has said, had already so far materialized\nitself as to cast its shadow before. If the Revolution had not come when\nit did, we can not doubt that something like this universal plutocratic\ndynasty or some highly centered oligarchy, based upon the complete\nmonopoly of all property by a small body, would long before this time\nhave become the government of the world. But of course the Revolution\nmust have come when it did, so we need not talk of what would have\nhappened if it had not come.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nAN EXCUSE THAT CONDEMNED.\n\n\"I have read,\" said Edith, \"that there never was a system of oppression\nso bad that those who benefited by it did not recognize the moral sense\nso far as to make some excuse for themselves. Was the old system of\nproperty distribution, by which the few held the many in servitude\nthrough fear of starvation, an exception to this rule? Surely the rich\ncould not have looked the poor in the face unless they had some excuse to\noffer, some color of reason to give for the cruel contrast between their\nconditions.\"\n\n\"Thanks for reminding us of that point,\" said the doctor. \"As you say,\nthere never was a system so bad that it did not make an excuse for\nitself. It would not be strictly fair to the old system to dismiss it\nwithout considering the excuse made for it, although, on the other hand,\nit would really be kinder not to mention it, for it was an excuse that,\nfar from excusing, furnished an additional ground of condemnation for the\nsystem which it undertook to justify.\"\n\n\"What was the excuse?\" asked Edith.\n\n\"It was the claim that, as a matter of justice, every one is entitled to\nthe effect of his qualities--that is to say, the result of his abilities,\nthe fruit of his efforts. The qualities, abilities, and efforts of\ndifferent persons being different, they would naturally acquire\nadvantages over others in wealth seeking as in other ways; but as this\nwas according to Nature, it was urged that it must be right, and nobody\nhad any business to complain, unless of the Creator.\n\n\"Now, in the first place, the theory that a person has a right in dealing\nwith his fellows to take advantage of his superior abilities is nothing\nother than a slightly more roundabout expression of the doctrine that\nmight is right. It was precisely to prevent their doing this that the\npoliceman stood on the corner, the judge sat on the bench, and the\nhangman drew his fees. The whole end and amount of civilization had\nindeed been to substitute for the natural law of superior might an\nartificial equality by force of statute, whereby, in disregard of their\nnatural differences, the weak and simple were made equal to the strong\nand cunning by means of the collective force lent them.\n\n\"But while the nineteenth-century moralists denied as sharply as we do\nmen's right to take advantage of their superiorities in direct dealings\nby physical force, they held that they might rightly do so when the\ndealings were indirect and carried on through the medium of things. That\nis to say, a man might not so much as jostle another while drinking a cup\nof water lest he should spill it, but he might acquire the spring of\nwater on which the community solely depended and make the people pay a\ndollar a drop for water or go without. Or if he filled up the spring so\nas to deprive the population of water on any terms, he was held to be\nacting within his right. He might not by force take away a bone from a\nbeggar's dog, but he might corner the grain supply of a nation and reduce\nmillions to starvation.\n\n\"If you touch a man's living you touch him, would seem to be about as\nplain a truth as could be put in words; but our ancestors had not the\nleast difficulty in getting around it. 'Of course,' they said, 'you must\nnot touch the man; to lay a finger on him would be an assault punishable\nby law. But his living is quite a different thing. That depends on bread,\nmeat, clothing, land, houses, and other material things, which you have\nan unlimited right to appropriate and dispose of as you please without\nthe slightest regard to whether anything is left for the rest of the\nworld.'\n\n\"I think I scarcely need dwell on the entire lack of any moral\njustification for the different rule which our ancestors followed in\ndetermining what use you might rightly make of your superior powers in\ndealing with your neighbor directly by physical force and indirectly by\neconomic duress. No one can have any more or other right to take away\nanother's living by superior economic skill or financial cunning than if\nhe used a club, simply because no one has any right to take advantage of\nany one else or to deal with him otherwise than justly by any means\nwhatever. The end itself being immoral, the means employed could not\npossibly make any difference. Moralists at a pinch used to argue that a\ngood end might justify bad means, but none, I think, went so far as to\nclaim that good means justified a bad end; yet this was precisely what\nthe defenders of the old property system did in fact claim when they\nargued that it was right for a man to take away the living of others and\nmake them his servants, if only his triumph resulted from superior talent\nor more diligent devotion to the acquisition of material things.\n\n\"But indeed the theory that the monopoly of wealth could be justified by\nsuperior economic ability, even if morally sound, would not at all have\nfitted the old property system, for of all conceivable plans for\ndistributing property, none could have more absolutely defied every\nnotion of desert based on economic effort. None could have been more\nutterly wrong if it were true that wealth ought to be distributed\naccording to the ability and industry displayed by individuals.\"\n\n\"All this talk started with the discussion of Julian's fortune. Now tell\nus, Julian, was your million dollars the result of your economic ability,\nthe fruit of your industry?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" I replied. \"Every cent of it was inherited. As I have\noften told you, I never lifted a finger in a useful way in my life.\"\n\n\"And were you the only person whose property came to him by descent\nwithout effort of his own?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, title by descent was the basis and backbone of the\nwhole property system. All land, except in the newest countries, together\nwith the bulk of the more stable kinds of property, was held by that\ntitle.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. We hear what Julian says. While the moralists and the\nclergy solemnly justified the inequalities of wealth and reproved the\ndiscontent of the poor on the ground that those inequalities were\njustified by natural differences in ability and diligence, they knew all\nthe time, and everybody knew who listened to them, that the foundation\nprinciple of the whole property system was not ability, effort, or desert\nof any kind whatever, but merely the accident of birth, than which no\npossible claim could more completely mock at ethics.\"\n\n\"But, Julian,\" exclaimed Edith, \"you must surely have had some way of\nexcusing yourself to your conscience for retaining in the presence of a\nneedy world such an excess of good things as you had!\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" I said, \"that you can not easily imagine how callous was\nthe cuticle of the nineteenth-century conscience. There may have been\nsome of my class on the intellectual plane of little Jack Horner in\nMother Goose, who concluded he must be a good boy because he pulled out a\nplum, but I did not at least belong to that grade. I never gave much\nthought to the subject of my right to an abundance which I had done\nnothing to earn in the midst of a starving world of toilers, but\noccasionally, when I did think of it, I felt like craving pardon of the\nbeggar who asked alms for being in a position to give to him.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to get up any sort of a quarrel with Julian,\" said the\ndoctor; \"but there were others of his class less rational. Cornered as to\ntheir moral claim to their possessions, they fell back on that of their\nancestors. They argued that these ancestors, assuming them to have had a\nright by merit to their possessions, had as an incident of that merit the\nright to give them to others. Here, of course, they absolutely confused\nthe ideas of legal and moral right. The law might indeed give a person\npower to transfer a legal title to property in any way that suited the\nlawmakers, but the meritorious right to the property, resting as it did\non personal desert, could not in the nature of moral things be\ntransferred or ascribed to any one else. The cleverest lawyer would never\nhave pretended that he could draw up a document that would carry over the\nsmallest tittle of merit from one person to another, however close the\ntie of blood.\n\n\"In ancient times it was customary to hold children responsible for the\ndebts of their fathers and sell them into slavery to make satisfaction.\nThe people of Julian's day found it unjust thus to inflict upon innocent\noffspring the penalty of their ancestors' faults. But if these children\ndid not deserve the consequences of their ancestors' sloth, no more had\nthey any title to the product of their ancestors' industry. The\nbarbarians who insisted on both sorts of inheritance were more logical\nthan Julian's contemporaries, who, rejecting one sort of inheritance,\nretained the other. Will it be said that at least the later theory of\ninheritance was more humane, although one-sided? Upon that point you\nshould have been able to get the opinion of the disinherited masses who,\nby reason of the monopolizing of the earth and its resources from\ngeneration to generation by the possessors of inherited property, were\nleft no place to stand on and no way to live except by permission of the\ninheriting class.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I said, \"I have nothing to offer against all that. We who\ninherited our wealth had no moral title to it, and that we knew as well\nas everybody else did, although it was not considered polite to refer to\nthe fact in our presence. But if I am going to stand up here in the\npillory as a representative of the inheriting class, there are others who\nought to stand beside me. We were not the only ones who had no right to\nour money. Are you not going to say anything about the money makers, the\nrascals who raked together great fortunes in a few years by wholesale\nfraud and extortion?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I was just coming to them,\" said the doctor. \"You ladies must\nremember,\" he continued, \"that the rich, who in Julian's day possessed\nnearly everything of value in every country, leaving the masses mere\nscraps and crumbs, were of two sorts: those who had inherited their\nwealth, and those who, as the saying was, had made it. We have seen how\nfar the inheriting class were justified in their holdings by the\nprinciple which the nineteenth century asserted to be the excuse for\nwealth--namely, that individuals were entitled to the fruit of their\nlabors. Let us next inquire how far the same principle justified the\npossessions of these others whom Julian refers to, who claimed that they\nhad made their money themselves, and showed in proof lives absolutely\ndevoted from childhood to age without rest or respite to the piling up of\ngains. Now, of course, labor in itself, however arduous, does not imply\nmoral desert. It may be a criminal activity. Let us see if these men who\nclaimed that they made their money had any better title to it than\nJulian's class by the rule put forward as the excuse for unequal wealth,\nthat every one has a right to the product of his labor. The most complete\nstatement of the principle of the right of property, as based on economic\neffort, which has come down to us, is this maxim: 'Every man is entitled\nto his own product, his whole product, and nothing but his product.' Now,\nthis maxim had a double edge, a negative as well as a positive, and the\nnegative edge is very sharp. If everybody was entitled to his own\nproduct, nobody else was entitled to any part of it, and if any one's\naccumulation was found to contain any product not strictly his own, he\nstood condemned as a thief by the law he had invoked. If in the great\nfortunes of the stockjobbers, the railroad kings, the bankers, the great\nlandlords, and the other moneyed lords who boasted that they had begun\nlife with a shilling--if in these great fortunes of mushroom rapidity of\ngrowth there was anything that was properly the product of the efforts of\nany one but the owner, it was not his, and his possession of it condemned\nhim as a thief. If he would be justified, he must not be more careful to\nobtain all that was his own product than to avoid taking anything that\nwas not his product. If he insisted upon the pound of flesh awarded him\nby the letter of the law, he must stick to the letter, observing the\nwarning of Portia to Shylock:\n\n      Nor cut thou less nor more\n  But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak'st more\n  Or less than a just pound, be it so much\n  As makes light or heavy in the substance,\n  Or the division of the twentieth part\n  Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn\n  But in the estimation of a hair,\n  Thou diest, and thy goods are confiscate.\n\nHow many of the great fortunes heaped up by the self-made men of your\nday, Julian, would have stood that test?\"\n\n\"It is safe to say,\" I replied, \"that there was not one of the lot whose\nlawyer would not have advised him to do as Shylock did, and resign his\nclaim rather than try to push it at the risk of the penalty. Why, dear\nme, there never would have been any possibility of making a great fortune\nin a lifetime if the maker had confined himself to his own product. The\nwhole acknowledged art of wealth-making on a large scale consisted in\ndevices for getting possession of other people's product without too open\nbreach of the law. It was a current and a true saying of the times that\nnobody could honestly acquire a million dollars. Everybody knew that it\nwas only by extortion, speculation, stock gambling, or some other form of\nplunder under pretext of law that such a feat could be accomplished. You\nyourselves can not condemn the human cormorants who piled up these heaps\nof ill-gotten gains more bitterly than did the public opinion of their\nown time. The execration and contempt of the community followed the great\nmoney-getters to their graves, and with the best of reason. I have had\nnothing to say in defense of my own class, who inherited our wealth, but\nactually the people seemed to have more respect for us than for these\nothers who claimed to have made their money. For if we inheritors had\nconfessedly no moral right to the wealth we had done nothing to produce\nor acquire, yet we had committed no positive wrong to obtain it.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the doctor, \"what a pity it would have been if we had\nforgotten to compare the excuse offered by the nineteenth century for the\nunequal distribution of wealth with the actual facts of that\ndistribution. Ethical standards advance from age to age, and it is not\nalways fair to judge the systems of one age by the moral standards of a\nlater one. But we have seen that the property system of the nineteenth\ncentury would have gained nothing by way of a milder verdict by appealing\nfrom the moral standards of the twentieth to those of the nineteenth\ncentury. It was not necessary, in order to justify its condemnation, to\ninvoke the modern ethics of wealth which deduce the rights of property\nfrom the rights of man. It was only necessary to apply to the\nactual realities of the system the ethical plea put forth in its\ndefense--namely, that everybody was entitled to the fruit of his own\nlabor, and was not entitled to the fruit of anybody's else--to leave not\none stone upon another of the whole fabric.\"\n\n\"But was there, then, absolutely no class under your system,\" said\nEdith's mother, \"which even by the standards of your time could claim an\nethical as well as a legal title to their possessions?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" I replied, \"we have been speaking of the rich. You may set it\ndown as a rule that the rich, the possessors of great wealth, had no\nmoral right to it as based upon desert, for either their fortunes\nbelonged to the class of inherited wealth, or else, when accumulated in a\nlifetime, necessarily represented chiefly the product of others, more or\nless forcibly or fraudulently obtained. There were, however, a great\nnumber of modest competencies, which were recognized by public opinion as\nbeing no more than a fair measure of the service rendered by their\npossessors to the community. Below these there was the vast mass of\nwell-nigh wholly penniless toilers, the real people. Here there was\nindeed abundance of ethical title to property, for these were the\nproducers of all; but beyond the shabby clothing they wore, they had\nlittle or no property.\"\n\n\"It would seem,\" said Edith, \"that, speaking generally, the class which\nchiefly had the property had little or no right to it, even according to\nthe ideas of your day, while the masses which had the right had little or\nno property.\"\n\n\"Substantially that was the case,\" I replied. \"That is to say, if you\ntook the aggregate of property held by the merely legal title of\ninheritance, and added to it all that had been obtained by means which\npublic opinion held to be speculative, extortionate, fraudulent, or\nrepresenting results in excess of services rendered, there would be\nlittle property left, and certainly none at all in considerable amounts.\"\n\n\"From the preaching of the clergy in Julian's time,\" said the doctor,\n\"you would have thought the corner stone of Christianity was the right of\nproperty, and the supreme crime was the wrongful appropriation of\nproperty. But if stealing meant only taking that from another to which he\nhad a sound ethical title, it must have been one of the most difficult of\nall crimes to commit for lack of the requisite material. When one took\naway the possessions of the poor it was reasonably certain that he was\nstealing, but then they had nothing to take away.\"\n\n\"The thing that seems to me the most utterly incredible about all this\nterrible story,\" said Edith, \"is that a system which was such a\ndisastrous failure in its effects on the general welfare, which, by\ndisinheriting the great mass of the people, had made them its bitter\nfoes, and which finally even people like Julian, who were its\nbeneficiaries, did not attempt to defend as having any ground of\nfairness, could have maintained itself a day.\"\n\n\"No wonder it seems incomprehensible to you, as now, indeed, it seems to\nme as I look back,\" I replied. \"But you can not possibly imagine, as I\nmyself am fast losing the power to do, in my new environment, how\nbenumbing to the mind was the prestige belonging to the immemorial\nantiquity of the property system as we knew it and of the rule of the\nrich based on it. No other institution, no other fabric of power ever\nknown to man, could be compared with it as to duration. No different\neconomic order could really be said ever to have been known. There had\nbeen changes and fashions in all other human institutions, but no radical\nchange in the system of property. The procession of political, social,\nand religious systems, the royal, imperial, priestly, democratic epochs,\nand all other great phases of human affairs, had been as passing cloud\nshadows, mere fashions of a day, compared with the hoary antiquity of the\nrule of the rich. Consider how profound and how widely ramified a root in\nhuman prejudices such a system must have had, how overwhelming the\npresumption must have been with the mass of minds against the possibility\nof making an end of an order that had never been known to have a\nbeginning! What need for excuses or defenders had a system so deeply\nbased in usage and antiquity as this? It is not too much to say that to\nthe mass of mankind in my day the division of the race into rich and\npoor, and the subjection of the latter to the former, seemed almost as\nmuch a law of Nature as the succession of the seasons--something that\nmight not be agreeable, but was certainly unchangeable. And just here, I\ncan well understand, must have come the hardest as well as, necessarily,\nthe first task of the revolutionary leaders--that is, of overcoming the\nenormous dead weight of immemorial inherited prejudice against the\npossibility of getting rid of abuses which had lasted so long, and\nopening people's eyes to the fact that the system of wealth distribution\nwas merely a human institution like others, and that if there is any\ntruth in human progress, the longer an institution had endured unchanged,\nthe more completely it was likely to have become out of joint with the\nworld's progress, and the more radical the change must be which, should\nbring it into correspondence with other lines of social evolution.\"\n\n\"That is quite the modern view of the subject,\" said the doctor. \"I shall\nbe understood in talking with a representative of the century which\ninvented poker if I say that when the revolutionists attacked the\nfundamental justice of the old property system, its defenders were able\non account of its antiquity to meet them with a tremendous bluff--one\nwhich it is no wonder should have been for a time almost paralyzing. But\nbehind the bluff there was absolutely nothing. The moment public opinion\ncould be nerved up to the point of calling it, the game was up. The\nprinciple of inheritance, the backbone of the whole property system, at\nthe first challenge of serious criticism abandoned all ethical defense\nand shriveled into a mere convention established by law, and as\nrightfully to be disestablished by it in the name of anything fairer. As\nfor the buccaneers, the great money-getters, when the light was once\nturned on their methods, the question was not so much of saving their\nbooty as their bacon.\n\n\"There is historically a marked difference,\" the doctor went on, \"between\nthe decline and fall of the systems of royal and priestly power and the\npassing of the rule of the rich. The former systems were rooted deeply in\nsentiment and romance, and for ages after their overthrow retained a\nstrong hold on the hearts and imaginations of men. Our generous race has\nremembered without rancor all the oppressions it has endured save only\nthe rule of the rich. The dominion of the money power had always been\ndevoid of moral basis or dignity, and from the moment its material\nsupports were destroyed, it not only perished, but seemed to sink away at\nonce into a state of putrescence that made the world hurry to bury it\nforever out of sight and memory.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE REVOLUTION SAVES PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM MONOPOLY.\n\n\"Really,\" said her mother, \"Edith touched the match to quite a large\ndiscussion when she suggested that you should open the safe for us.\"\n\nTo which I added that I had learned more that morning about the moral\nbasis of economic equality and the grounds for the abolition of private\nproperty than in my entire previous experience as a citizen of the\ntwentieth century.\n\n\"The abolition of private property!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"What is that\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"I am quite ready to admit that you have\nsomething--very much better in its place, but private property you have\ncertainly abolished--have you not? Is not that what we have been talking\nabout?\"\n\nThe doctor turned as if for sympathy to the ladies. \"And this young\nman,\" he said, \"who thinks that we have abolished private property has at\nthis moment in his pocket a card of credit representing a private annual\nincome, for strictly personal use, of four thousand dollars, based upon a\nshare of stock in the wealthiest and soundest corporation in the world,\nthe value of his share, calculating the income on a four-per-cent basis,\ncoming to one hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\nI felt a little silly at being convicted so palpably of making a\nthoughtless observation, but the doctor hastened to say that he\nunderstood perfectly what had been in my mind. I had, no doubt, heard it\na hundred times asserted by the wise men of my day that the equalization\nof human conditions as to wealth would necessitate destroying the\ninstitution of private property, and, without having given special\nthought to the subject, had naturally assumed that the equalization of\nwealth having been effected, private property must have been abolished,\naccording to the prediction.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said; \"that is it exactly.\"\n\n\"The Revolution,\" said the doctor, \"abolished private capitalism--that is\nto say, it put an end to the direction of the industries and commerce of\nthe people by irresponsible persons for their own benefit and transferred\nthat function to the people collectively to be carried on by responsible\nagents for the common benefit. The change created an entirely new system\nof property holding, but did not either directly or indirectly involve\nany denial of the right of private property. Quite on the contrary, the\nchange in system placed the private and personal property rights of every\ncitizen upon a basis incomparably more solid and secure and extensive\nthan they ever before had or could have had while private capitalism\nlasted. Let us analyze the effects of the change of systems and see if it\nwas not so.\"\n\n\"Suppose you and a number of other men of your time, all having separate\nclaims in a mining region, formed a corporation to carry on as one mine\nyour consolidated properties, would you have any less private property\nthan you had when you owned your claims separately? You would have\nchanged the mode and tenure of your property, but if the arrangement were\na wise one that would be wholly to your advantage, would it not?\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"Of course, you could no longer exercise the personal and complete\ncontrol over the consolidated mine which you exercised over your separate\nclaim. You would have, with your fellow-corporators, to intrust the\nmanagement of the combined property to a board of directors chosen by\nyourselves, but you would not think that meant a sacrifice of your\nprivate property, would you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. That was the form under which a very large part, if not\nthe largest part, of private property in my day was invested and\ncontrolled.\"\n\n\"It appears, then,\" said the doctor, \"that it is not necessary to the\nfull possession and enjoyment of private property that it should be in a\nseparate parcel or that the owner should exercise a direct and personal\ncontrol over it. Now, let us further suppose that instead of intrusting\nthe management of your consolidated property to private directors more or\nless rascally, who would be constantly trying to cheat the stockholders,\nthe nation undertook to manage the business for you by agents chosen by\nand responsible to you; would that be an attack on your property\ninterests?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it would greatly enhance the value of the property. It\nwould be as if a government guarantee were obtained for private bonds.\"\n\n\"Well, that is what the people in the Revolution did with private\nproperty. They simply consolidated the property in the country previously\nheld in separate parcels and put the management of the business into the\nhands of a national agency charged with paying over the dividends to the\nstockholders for their individual use. So far, surely, it must be\nadmitted the Revolution did not involve any abolition of private\nproperty.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said I, \"except in one particular. It is or used to be a\nusual incident to the ownership of property that it may be disposed of at\nwill by the owner. The owner of stock in a mine or mill could not indeed\nsell a piece of the mine or mill, but he could sell his stock in it; but\nthe citizen now can not dispose of his share in the national concern. He\ncan only dispose of the dividend.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the doctor; \"but while the power of alienating the\nprincipal of one's property was a usual incident of ownership in your\ntime, it was very far from being a necessary incident or one which was\nbeneficial to the owner, for the right of disposing of property involved\nthe risk of being dispossessed of it by others. I think there were few\nproperty owners in your day who would not very gladly have relinquished\nthe right to alienate their property if they could have had it guaranteed\nindefeasibly to them and their children. So to tie up property by trusts\nthat the beneficiary could not touch the principal was the study of rich\npeople who desired best to protect their heirs. Take the case of entailed\nestates as another illustration of this idea. Under that mode of holding\nproperty the possessor could not sell it, yet it was considered the most\ndesirable sort of property on account of that very fact. The fact you\nrefer to--that the citizen can not alienate his share in the national\ncorporation which forms the basis of his income--tends in the same way to\nmake it a more and not a less valuable sort of property. Certainly its\nquality as a strictly personal and private sort of property is\nintensified by the very indefeasibleness with which it is attached to the\nindividual. It might be said that the reorganization of the property\nsystem which we are speaking of amounted to making the United States an\nentailed estate for the equal benefit of the citizens thereof and their\ndescendants forever.\"\n\n\"You have not yet mentioned\" I said, \"the most drastic measure of all by\nwhich the Revolution affected private property, namely, the absolute\nequalizing of the amount of property to be held by each. Here was not\nperhaps any denial of the principle itself of private property, but it\nwas certainly a prodigious interference with property holders.\"\n\n\"The distinction is well made. It is of vital importance to a correct\napprehension of this subject. History has been full of just such\nwholesale readjustments of property interests by spoliation, conquest, or\nconfiscation. They have been more or less justifiable, but when least so\nthey were never thought to involve any denial of the idea of private\nproperty in itself, for they went right on to reassert it under a\ndifferent form. Less than any previous readjustment of property relations\ncould the general equalizing of property in the Revolution be called a\ndenial of the right of property. On the precise contrary it was an\nassertion and vindication of that right on a scale never before dreamed\nof. Before the Revolution very few of the people had any property at all\nand no economic provision save from day to day. By the new system all\nwere assured of a large, equal, and fixed share in the total national\nprincipal and income. Before the Revolution even those who had secured a\nproperty were likely to have it taken from them or to slip from them by a\nthousand accidents. Even the millionaire had no assurance that his\ngrandson might not become a homeless vagabond or his granddaughter be\nforced to a life of shame. Under the new system the title of every\ncitizen to his individual fortune became indefeasible, and he could lose\nit only when the nation became bankrupt. The Revolution, that is to say,\ninstead of denying or abolishing the institution of private property,\naffirmed it in an incomparably more positive, beneficial, permanent, and\ngeneral form than had ever been known before.\n\n\"Of course, Julian, it was in the way of human nature quite a matter of\ncourse that your contemporaries should have cried out against the idea of\na universal right of property as an attack on the principle of property.\nThere was never a prophet or reformer who raised his voice for a purer,\nmore spiritual, and perfect idea of religion whom his contemporaries did\nnot accuse of seeking to abolish religion; nor ever in political affairs\ndid any party proclaim a juster, larger, wiser ideal of government\nwithout being accused of seeking to abolish government. So it was quite\naccording to precedent that those who taught the right of all to property\nshould be accused of attacking the right of property. But who, think you,\nwere the true friends and champions of private property? those who\nadvocated a system under which one man if clever enough could monopolize\nthe earth--and a very small number were fast monopolizing it--turning the\nrest of the race into proletarians, or, on the other hand, those who\ndemanded a system by which all should become property holders on equal\nterms?\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" I said, \"that as soon as the revolutionary leaders\nsucceeded in opening the eyes of the people to this view of the matter,\nmy old friends the capitalists must have found their cry about 'the\nsacred right of property' turned into a most dangerous sort of\nboomerang.\"\n\n\"So they did. Nothing could have better served the ends of the\nRevolution, as we have seen, than to raise the issue of the right of\nproperty. Nothing was so desirable as that the people at large should be\nled to give a little serious consideration on rational and moral grounds\nto what that right was as compared with what it ought to be. It was very\nsoon, then, that the cry of 'the sacred right of property,' first raised\nby the rich in the name of the few, was re-echoed with overwhelming\neffect by the disinherited millions in the name of all.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nAN ECHO OF THE PAST.\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Edith, who with her mother had been rummaging the drawers\nof the safe as the doctor and I talked, \"here are some letters, if I am\nnot mistaken. It seems, then, you used safes for something besides\nmoney.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, as I noted with quite indescribable emotion, a packet of\nletters and notes from Edith Bartlett, written on various occasions\nduring our relation as lovers, that Edith, her great-granddaughter, held\nin her hand. I took them from her, and opening one, found it to be a note\ndated May 30, 1887, the very day on which I parted with her forever. In\nit she asked me to join her family in their Decoration-day visit to the\ngrave at Mount Auburn where her brother lay, who had fallen in the civil\nwar.\n\n\"I do not expect, Julian,\" she had written, \"that you will adopt all my\nrelations as your own because you marry me--that would be too much--but\nmy hero brother I want you to take for yours, and that is why I would\nlike you to go with us to-day.\"\n\nThe gold and parchments, once so priceless, now carelessly scattered\nabout the chamber, had lost their value, but these tokens of love had not\nparted with their potency through lapse of time. As by a magic power they\ncalled up in a moment a mist of memories which shut me up in a world of\nmy own--a world in which the present had no part. I do not know for how\nlong I sat thus tranced and oblivious of the silent, sympathizing group\naround me. It was by a deep involuntary sigh from my own lips that I was\nat last roused from my abstraction, and returned from the dream world of\nthe past to a consciousness of my present environment and its conditions.\n\n\"These are letters,\" I said, \"from the other Edith--Edith Bartlett, your\ngreat-grandmother. Perhaps you would be interested in looking them over.\nI don't know who has a nearer or better claim to them after myself than\nyou and your mother.\"\n\nEdith took the letters and began to examine them with reverent curiosity.\n\n\"They will be very interesting,\" said her mother, \"but I am afraid,\nJulian, we shall have to ask you to read them for us.\"\n\nMy countenance no doubt expressed the surprise I felt at this confession\nof illiteracy on the part of such highly cultivated persons.\n\n\"Am I to understand,\" I finally inquired, \"that handwriting, and the\nreading of it, like lock-making, is a lost art?\"\n\n\"I am afraid it is about so,\" replied the doctor, \"although the\nexplanation here is not, as in the other case, economic equality so much\nas the progress of invention. Our children are still taught to write and\nto read writing, but they have so little practice in after-life that they\nusually forget their acquirements pretty soon after leaving school; but\nreally Edith ought still to be able to make out a nineteenth-century\nletter.--My dear, I am a little ashamed of you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can read this, papa,\" she exclaimed, looking up, with brows still\ncorrugated, from a page she had been studying. \"Don't you remember I\nstudied out those old letters of Julian's to Edith Bartlett, which mother\nhad?--though that was years ago, and I have grown rusty since. But I have\nread nearly two lines of this already. It is really quite plain. I am\ngoing to work it all out without any help from anybody except mother.\"\n\n\"Dear me, dear me!\" said I, \"don't you write letters any more?\"\n\n\"Well, no,\" replied the doctor, \"practically speaking, handwriting has\ngone out of use. For correspondence, when we do not telephone, we send\nphonographs, and use the latter, indeed, for all purposes for which you\nemployed handwriting. It has been so now so long that it scarcely occurs\nto us that people ever did anything else. But surely this is an evolution\nthat need surprise you little: you had the phonograph, and its\npossibilities were patent enough from the first. For our important\nrecords we still largely use types, of course, but the printed matter is\ntranscribed from phonographic copy, so that really, except in\nemergencies, there is little use for handwriting. Curious, isn't it, when\none comes to think of it, that the riper civilization has grown, the more\nperishable its records have become? The Chaldeans and Egyptians used\nbricks, and the Greeks and Romans made more or less use of stone and\nbronze, for writing. If the race were destroyed to-day and the earth\nshould be visited, say, from Mars, five hundred years later or even less,\nour books would have perished, and the Roman Empire be accounted the\nlatest and highest stage of human civilization.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\"CAN A MAID FORGET HER ORNAMENTS?\"\n\nPresently Edith and her mother went into the house to study out the\nletters, and the doctor being so delightfully absorbed with the stocks\nand bonds that it would have been unkind not to leave him alone, it\nstruck me that the occasion was favorable for the execution of a private\nproject for which opportunity had hitherto been lacking.\n\nFrom the moment of receiving my credit card I had contemplated a\nparticular purchase which I desired to make on the first opportunity.\nThis was a betrothal ring for Edith. Gifts in general, it was evident,\nhad lost their value in this age when everybody had everything he wanted,\nbut this was one which, for sentiment's sake, I was sure would still seem\nas desirable to a woman as ever.\n\nTaking advantage, therefore, of the unusual absorption of my hosts in\nspecial interests, I made my way to the great store Edith had taken me to\non a former occasion, the only one I had thus far entered. Not seeing the\nclass of goods which I desired indicated by any of the placards over the\nalcoves, I presently asked one of the young women attendants to direct me\nto the jewelry department.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, raising her eyebrows a little, \"what did I\nunderstand you to ask for?\"\n\n\"The jewelry department,\" I repeated. \"I want to look at some rings.\"\n\n\"Rings,\" she repeated, regarding me with a rather blank expression. \"May\nI ask what kind of rings, for what sort of use?\"\n\n\"Finger rings,\" I repeated, feeling that the young woman could not be so\nintelligent as she looked.\n\nAt the word she glanced at my left hand, on one of the fingers of which I\nwore a seal ring after a fashion of my day. Her countenance took on an\nexpression at once of intelligence and the keenest interest.\n\n\"I beg your pardon a thousand times!\" she exclaimed. \"I ought to have\nunderstood before. You are Julian West?\"\n\nI was beginning to be a little nettled with so much mystery about so\nsimple a matter.\n\n\"I certainly am Julian West,\" I said; \"but pardon me if I do not see the\nrelevancy of that fact to the question I asked you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you must really excuse me,\" she said, \"but it is most relevant.\nNobody in America but just yourself would ask for finger rings. You see\nthey have not been used for so long a period that we have quite ceased to\nkeep them in stock; but if you would like one made to order you have only\nto leave a description of what you want and it will be at once\nmanufactured.\"\n\nI thanked her, but concluded that I would not prosecute the undertaking\nany further until I had looked over the ground a little more thoroughly.\n\nI said nothing about my adventure at home, not caring to be laughed at\nmore than was necessary; but when after dinner I found the doctor alone\nin his favorite outdoor study on the housetop, I cautiously sounded him\non the subject.\n\nRemarking, as if quite in a casual way, that I had not noticed so much as\na finger ring worn by any one, I asked him whether the wearing of jewelry\nhad been disused, and, if so, what was the explanation of the abandonment\nof the custom?\n\nThe doctor said that it certainly was a fact that the wearing of jewelry\nhad been virtually an obsolete custom for a couple of generations if not\nmore. \"As for the reasons for the fact,\" he continued, \"they really go\nrather deeply into the direct and indirect consequences of our present\neconomic system. Speaking broadly, I suppose the main and sufficient\nreason why gold and silver and precious stones have ceased to be prized\nas ornaments is that they entirely lost their commercial value when the\nnation organized wealth distribution on the basis of the indefeasible\neconomic equality of all citizens. As you know, a ton of gold or a bushel\nof diamonds would not secure a loaf of bread at the public stores,\nnothing availing there except or in addition to the citizen's credit,\nwhich depends solely on his citizenship, and is always equal to that of\nevery other citizen. Consequently nothing is worth anything to anybody\nnowadays save for the use or pleasure he can personally derive from it.\nThe main reason why gems and the precious metals were formerly used as\nornaments seems to have been the great convertible value belonging to\nthem, which made them symbols of wealth and importance, and consequently\na favorite means of social ostentation. The fact that they have entirely\nlost this quality would account, I think, largely for their disuse as\nornaments, even if ostentation itself had not been deprived of its motive\nby the law of equality.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I said; \"yet there were those who thought them pretty\nquite apart from their value.\"\n\n\"Well, possibly,\" replied the doctor. \"Yes, I suppose savage races\nhonestly thought so, but, being honest, they did not distinguish between\nprecious stones and glass beads so long as both were equally shiny. As to\nthe pretension of civilized persons to admire gems or gold for their\nintrinsic beauty apart from their value, I suspect that was a more or\nless unconscious sham. Suppose, by any sudden abundance, diamonds of the\nfirst water had gone down to the value of bottle glass, how much longer\ndo you think they would have been worn by anybody in your day?\"\n\nI was constrained to admit that undoubtedly they would have disappeared\nfrom view promptly and permanently.\n\n\"I imagine,\" said the doctor, \"that good taste, which we understand even\nin your day rather frowned on the use of such ornaments, came to the aid\nof the economic influence in promoting their disuse when once the new\norder of things had been established. The loss by the gems and precious\nmetals of the glamour that belonged to them as forms of concentrated\nwealth left the taste free to judge of the real aesthetic value of\nornamental effects obtained by hanging bits of shining stones and plates\nand chains and rings of metal about the face and neck and fingers, and\nthe view seems to have been soon generally acquiesced in that such\ncombinations were barbaric and not really beautiful at all.\"\n\n\"But what has become of all the diamonds and rubies and emeralds, and\ngold and silver jewels?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"The metals, of course--silver and gold--kept their uses, mechanical and\nartistic. They are always beautiful in their proper places, and are as\nmuch used for decorative purposes as ever, but those purposes are\narchitectural, not personal, as formerly. Because we do not follow the\nancient practice of using paints on our faces and bodies, we use them not\nthe less in what we consider their proper places, and it is just so with\ngold and silver. As for the precious stones, some of them have found use\nin mechanical applications, and there are, of course, collections of them\nin museums here and there. Probably there never were more than a few\nhundred bushels of precious stones in existence, and it is easy to\naccount for the disappearance and speedy loss of so small a quantity of\nsuch minute objects after they had ceased to be prized.\"\n\n\"The reasons you give for the passing of jewelry,\" I said, \"certainly\naccount for the fact, and yet you can scarcely imagine what a surprise I\nfind in it. The degradation of the diamond to the rank of the glass bead,\nsave for its mechanical uses, expresses and typifies as no other one fact\nto me the completeness of the revolution which at the present time has\nsubordinated things to humanity. It would not be so difficult, of course,\nto understand that men might readily have dispensed with jewel-wearing,\nwhich indeed was never considered in the best of taste as a masculine\npractice except in barbarous countries, but it would have staggered the\nprophet Jeremiah to have his query 'Can a maid forget her ornaments?'\nanswered in the affirmative.\"\n\nThe doctor laughed.\n\n\"Jeremiah was a very wise man,\" he said, \"and if his attention had been\ndrawn to the subject of economic equality and its effect upon the\nrelation of the sexes, I am sure he would have foreseen as one of its\nlogical results the growth of a sentiment of quite as much philosophy\nconcerning personal ornamentation on the part of women as men have ever\ndisplayed. He would not have been surprised to learn that one effect of\nthat equality as between men and women had been to revolutionize women's\nattitude on the whole question of dress so completely that the most\nbilious of misogynists--if indeed any were left--would no longer be able\nto accuse them of being more absorbed in that interest than are men.\"\n\n\"Doctor, doctor, do not ask me to believe that the desire to make herself\nattractive has ceased to move woman!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, I did not mean to say anything of the sort,\" replied the\ndoctor. \"I spoke of the disproportionate development of that desire which\ntends to defeat its own end by over-ornament and excess of artifice. If\nwe may judge from the records of your time, this was quite generally the\nresult of the excessive devotion to dress on the part of your women; was\nit not so?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. Overdressing, overexertion to be attractive, was the\ngreatest drawback to the real attractiveness of women in my day.\"\n\n\"And how was it with the men?\"\n\n\"That could not be said of any men worth calling men. There were, of\ncourse, the dandies, but most men paid too little attention to their\nappearance rather than too much.\"\n\n\"That is to say, one sex paid too much attention to dress and the other\ntoo little?\"\n\n\"That was it.\"\n\n\"Very well; the effect of economic equality of the sexes and the\nconsequent independence of women at all times as to maintenance upon men\nis that women give much less thought to dress than in your day and men\nconsiderably more. No one would indeed think of suggesting that either\nsex is nowadays more absorbed in setting off its personal attractions\nthan the other. Individuals differ as to their interest in this matter,\nbut the difference is not along the line of sex.\"\n\n\"But why do you attribute this miracle,\" I exclaimed, \"for miracle it\nseems, to the effect of economic equality on the relation of men and\nwomen?\"\n\n\"Because from the moment that equality became established between them it\nceased to be a whit more the interest of women to make themselves\nattractive and desirable to men than for men to produce the same\nimpression upon women.\"\n\n\"Meaning thereby that previous to the establishment of economic equality\nbetween men and women it was decidedly more the interest of the women to\nmake themselves personally attractive than of the men.\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said the doctor. \"Tell me to what motive did men in your day\nascribe the excessive devotion of the other sex to matters of dress as\ncompared with men's comparative neglect of the subject?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think we did much clear thinking on the subject. In fact,\nanything which had any sexual suggestion about it was scarcely ever\ntreated in any other than a sentimental or jesting tone.\"\n\n\"That is indeed,\" said the doctor, \"a striking trait of your age, though\nexplainable enough in view of the utter hypocrisy underlying the entire\nrelation of the sexes, the pretended chivalric deference to women on the\none hand, coupled with their practical suppression on the other, but you\nmust have had some theory to account for women's excessive devotion to\npersonal adornment.\"\n\n\"The theory, I think, was that handed down from the ancients--namely,\nthat women were naturally vainer than men. But they did not like to hear\nthat said: so the polite way of accounting for the obvious fact that they\ncared so much more for dress than did men was that they were more\nsensitive to beauty, more unselfishly desirous of pleasing, and other\nagreeable phrases.\"\n\n\"And did it not occur to you that the real reason why woman gave so much\nthought to devices for enhancing her beauty was simply that, owing to her\neconomic dependence on man's favor, a woman's face was her fortune, and\nthat the reason men were so careless for the most part as to their\npersonal appearance was that their fortune in no way depended on their\nbeauty; and that even when it came to commending themselves to the favor\nof the other sex their economic position told more potently in their\nfavor than any question of personal advantages? Surely this obvious\nconsideration fully explained woman's greater devotion to personal\nadornment, without assuming any difference whatever in the natural\nendowment of the sexes as to vanity.\"\n\n\"And consequently,\" I put in, \"when women ceased any more to depend for\ntheir economic welfare upon men's favor, it ceased to be their main aim\nin life to make themselves attractive to men's eyes?\"\n\n\"Precisely so, to their unspeakable gain in comfort, dignity, and freedom\nof mind for more important interests.\"\n\n\"But to the diminution, I suspect, of the picturesqueness of the social\npanorama?\"\n\n\"Not at all, but most decidedly to its notable advantage. So far as we\ncan judge, what claim the women of your period had to be regarded as\nattractive was achieved distinctly in spite of their efforts to make\nthemselves so. Let us recall that we are talking about that excessive\nconcern of women for the enhancement of their charms which led to a mad\nrace after effect that for the most part defeated the end sought. Take\naway the economic motive which made women's attractiveness to men a means\nof getting on in life, and there remained Nature's impulse to attract the\nadmiration of the other sex, a motive quite strong enough for beauty's\nend, and the more effective for not being too strong.\"\n\n\"It is easy enough to see,\" I said, \"why the economic independence of\nwomen should have had the effect of moderating to a reasonable measure\ntheir interest in personal adornment; but why should it have operated in\nthe opposite direction upon men, in making them more attentive to dress\nand personal appearance than before?\"\n\n\"For the simple reason that their economic superiority to women having\ndisappeared, they must henceforth depend wholly upon personal\nattractiveness if they would either win the favor of women or retain it\nwhen won.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nWHAT THE REVOLUTION DID FOR WOMEN.\n\n\"It occurs to me, doctor,\" I said, \"that it would have been even better\nworth the while of a woman of my day to have slept over till now than for\nme, seeing that the establishment of economic equality seems to have\nmeant for more for women than for men.\"\n\n\"Edith would perhaps not have been pleased with the substitution,\" said\nthe doctor; \"but really there is much in what you say, for the\nestablishment of economic equality did in fact mean incomparably more for\nwomen than for men. In your day the condition of the mass of men was\nabject as compared with their present state, but the lot of women was\nabject as compared with that of the men. The most of men were indeed the\nservants of the rich, but the woman was subject to the man whether he\nwere rich or poor, and in the latter and more common case was thus the\nservant of a servant. However low down in poverty a man might be, he had\none or more lower even than he in the persons of the women dependent on\nhim and subject to his will. At the very bottom of the social heap,\nbearing the accumulated burden of the whole mass, was woman. All the\ntyrannies of soul and mind and body which the race endured, weighed at\nlast with cumulative force upon her. So far beneath even the mean estate\nof man was that of woman that it would have been a mighty uplift for her\ncould she have only attained his level. But the great Revolution not\nmerely lifted her to an equality with man but raised them both with the\nsame mighty upthrust to a plane of moral dignity and material welfare as\nmuch above the former state of man as his former state had been above\nthat of woman. If men then owe gratitude to the Revolution, how much\ngreater must women esteem their debt to it! If to the men the voice of\nthe Revolution was a call to a higher and nobler plane of living, to\nwoman it was as the voice of God calling her to a new creation.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I said, \"the women of the poor had a pretty abject time of\nit, but the women of the rich certainly were not oppressed.\"\n\n\"The women of the rich,\" replied the doctor, \"were numerically too\ninsignificant a proportion of the mass of women to be worth considering\nin a general statement of woman's condition in your day. Nor, for that\nmatter, do we consider their lot preferable to that of their poorer\nsisters. It is true that they did not endure physical hardship, but were,\non the contrary, petted and spoiled by their men protectors like\nover-indulged children; but that seems to us not a sort of life to be\ndesired. So far as we can learn from contemporary accounts and social\npictures, the women of the rich lived in a hothouse atmosphere of\nadulation and affectation, altogether less favorable to moral or mental\ndevelopment than the harder conditions of the women of the poor. A woman\nof to-day, if she were doomed to go back to live in your world, would beg\nat least to be reincarnated as a scrub woman rather than as a wealthy\nwoman of fashion. The latter rather than the former seems to us the sort\nof woman which most completely typified the degradation of the sex in\nyour age.\"\n\nAs the same thought had occurred to me, even in my former life, I did not\nargue the point.\n\n\"The so-called woman movement, the beginning of the great transformation\nin her condition,\" continued the doctor, \"was already making quite a stir\nin your day. You must have heard and seen much of it, and may have even\nknown some of the noble women who were the early leaders.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" I replied. \"There was a great stir about women's rights, but\nthe programme then announced was by no means revolutionary. It only aimed\nat securing the right to vote, together with various changes in the laws\nabout property-holding by women, the custody of children in divorces, and\nsuch details. I assure you that the women no more than the men had at\nthat time any notion of revolutionizing the economic system.\"\n\n\"So we understand,\" replied the doctor. \"In that respect the women's\nstruggle for independence resembled revolutionary movements in general,\nwhich, in their earlier stages, go blundering and stumbling along in such\na seemingly erratic and illogical way that it takes a philosopher to\ncalculate what outcome to expect. The calculation as to the ultimate\noutcome of the women's movement was, however, as simple as was the same\ncalculation in the case of what you called the labor movement. What the\nwomen were after was independence of men and equality with them, while\nthe workingmen's desire was to put an end to their vassalage to\ncapitalists. Now, the key to the fetters the women wore was the same that\nlocked the shackles of the workers. It was the economic key, the control\nof the means of subsistence. Men, as a sex, held that power over women,\nand the rich as a class held it over the working masses. The secret of\nthe sexual bondage and of the industrial bondage was the same--namely,\nthe unequal distribution of the wealth power, and the change which was\nnecessary to put an end to both forms of bondage must obviously be\neconomic equalization, which in the sexual as in the industrial relation\nwould at once insure the substitution of co-operation for coercion.\n\n\"The first leaders of the women's revolt were unable to see beyond the\nends of their noses, and consequently ascribed their subject condition\nand the abuses they endured to the wickedness of man, and appeared to\nbelieve that the only remedy necessary was a moral reform on his part.\nThis was the period during which such expressions as the 'tyrant man' and\n'man the monster' were watchwords of the agitation. The champions of the\nwomen fell into precisely the same mistake committed by a large\nproportion of the early leaders of the workingmen, who wasted good breath\nand wore out their tempers in denouncing the capitalists as the willful\nauthors of all the ills of the proletarian. This was worse than idle\nrant; it was misleading and blinding. The men were essentially no worse\nthan the women they oppressed nor the capitalists than the workmen they\nexploited. Put workingmen in the places of the capitalists and they would\nhave done just as the capitalists were doing. In fact, whenever\nworkingmen did become capitalists they were commonly said to make the\nhardest sort of masters. So, also, if women could have changed places\nwith the men, they would undoubtedly have dealt with the men precisely as\nthe men had dealt with them. It was the system which permitted human\nbeings to come into relations of superiority and inferiority to one\nanother which was the cause of the whole evil. Power over others is\nnecessarily demoralizing to the master and degrading to the subject.\nEquality is the only moral relation between human beings. Any reform\nwhich should result in remedying the abuse of women by men, or workingmen\nby capitalists, must therefore be addressed to equalizing their economic\ncondition. Not till the women, as well as the workingmen, gave over the\nfolly of attacking the consequences of economic inequality and attacked\nthe inequality itself, was there any hope for the enfranchisement of\neither class.\n\n\"The utterly inadequate idea which the early leaders of the women had of\nthe great salvation they must have, and how it must come, are curiously\nillustrated by their enthusiasm for the various so-called temperance\nagitations of the period for the purpose of checking drunkenness among\nmen. The special interest of the women as a class in this reform in men's\nmanners--for women as a rule did not drink intoxicants--consisted in the\ncalculation that if the men drank less they would be less likely to abuse\nthem, and would provide more liberally for their maintenance; that is to\nsay, their highest aspirations were limited to the hope that, by\nreforming the morals of their masters, they might secure a little better\ntreatment for themselves. The idea of abolishing the mastership had not\nyet occurred to them as a possibility.\n\n\"This point, by the way, as to the efforts of women in your day to reform\nmen's drinking habits by law rather strikingly suggests the difference\nbetween the position of women then and now in their relation to men. If\nnowadays men were addicted to any practice which made them seriously and\ngenerally offensive to women, it would not occur to the latter to attempt\nto curb it by law. Our spirit of personal sovereignty and the rightful\nindependence of the individual in all matters mainly self-regarding would\nindeed not tolerate any of the legal interferences with the private\npractices of individuals so common in your day. But the women would not\nfind force necessary to correct the manners of the men. Their absolute\neconomic independence, whether in or out of marriage, would enable them\nto use a more potent influence. It would presently be found that the men\nwho made themselves offensive to women's susceptibilities would sue for\ntheir favor in vain. But it was practically impossible for women of your\nday to protect themselves or assert their wills by assuming that\nattitude. It was economically a necessity for a woman to marry, or at\nleast of so great advantage to her that she could not well dictate terms\nto her suitors, unless very fortunately situated, and once married it was\nthe practical understanding that in return for her maintenance by her\nhusband she must hold herself at his disposal.\"\n\n\"It sounds horribly,\" I said, \"at this distance of time, but I beg you to\nbelieve that it was not always quite as bad as it sounds. The better men\nexercised their power with consideration, and with persons of refinement\nthe wife virtually retained her self-control, and for that matter in many\nfamilies the woman was practically the head of the house.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt,\" replied the doctor. \"So it has always been under\nevery form of servitude. However absolute the power of a master, it has\nbeen exercised with a fair degree of humanity in a large proportion of\ninstances, and in many cases the nominal slave, when of strong character,\nhas in reality exercised a controlling influence over the master. This\nobserved fact is not, however, considered a valid argument for subjecting\nhuman beings to the arbitrary will of others. Speaking generally, it is\nundoubtedly true that both the condition of women when subjected to men,\nas well as that of the poor in subjection to the rich, were in fact far\nless intolerable than it seems to us they possibly could have been. As\nthe physical life of man can be maintained and often thrive in any\nclimate from the poles to the equator, so his moral nature has shown its\npower to live and even put forth fragrant flowers under the most terrible\nsocial conditions.\"\n\n\"In order to realize the prodigious debt of woman to the great\nRevolution,\" resumed the doctor, \"we must remember that the bondage from\nwhich it delivered her was incomparably more complete and abject than any\nto which men had ever been subjected by their fellow-men. It was enforced\nnot by a single but by a triple yoke. The first yoke was the subjection\nto the personal and class rule of the rich, which the mass of women bore\nin common with the mass of men. The other two yokes were peculiar to her.\nOne of them was her personal subjection not only in the sexual relation,\nbut in all her behavior to the particular man on whom she depended for\nsubsistence. The third yoke was an intellectual and moral one, and\nconsisted in the slavish conformity exacted of her in all her thinking,\nspeaking, and acting to a set of traditions and conventional standards\ncalculated to repress all that was spontaneous and individual, and impose\nan artificial uniformity upon both the inner and outer life.\n\n\"The last was the heaviest yoke of the three, and most disastrous in its\neffects both upon women directly and indirectly upon mankind through the\ndegradation of the mothers of the race. Upon the woman herself the effect\nwas so soul-stifling and mind-stunting as to be made a plausible excuse\nfor treating her as a natural inferior by men not philosophical enough to\nsee that what they would make an excuse for her subjection was itself the\nresult of that subjection. The explanation of woman's submission in\nthought and action to what was practically a slave code--a code peculiar\nto her sex and scorned and derided by men--was the fact that the main\nhope of a comfortable life for every woman consisted in attracting the\nfavorable attention of some man who could provide for her. Now, under\nyour economic system it was very desirable for a man who sought\nemployment to think and talk as his employer did if he was to get on in\nlife. Yet a certain degree of independence of mind and conduct was\nconceded to men by their economic superiors under most circumstances, so\nlong as they were not actually offensive, for, after all, what was mainly\nwanted of them was their labor. But the relation of a woman to the man\nwho supported her was of a very different and much closer character. She\nmust be to him _persona grata_, as your diplomats used to say. To\nattract him she must be personally pleasing to him, must not offend his\ntastes or prejudices by her opinions or conduct. Otherwise he would be\nlikely to prefer some one else. It followed from this fact that while a\nboy's training looked toward fitting him to earn a living, a girl was\neducated with a chief end to making her, if not pleasing, at least not\ndispleasing to men.\n\n\"Now, if particular women had been especially trained to suit particular\nmen's tastes--trained to order, so to speak--while that would have been\noffensive enough to any idea of feminine dignity, yet it would have been\nfar less disastrous, for many men would have vastly preferred women of\nindependent minds and original and natural opinions. But as it was not\nknown beforehand what particular men would support particular women, the\nonly safe way was to train girls with a view to a negative rather than a\npositive attractiveness, so that at least they might not offend average\nmasculine prejudices. This ideal was most likely to be secured by\neducating a girl to conform herself to the customary traditional and\nfashionable habits of thinking, talking, and behaving--in a word, to the\nconventional standards prevailing at the time. She must above all things\navoid as a contagion any new or original ideas or lines of conduct in any\nimportant respect, especially in religious, political, and social\nmatters. Her mind, that is to say, like her body, must be trained and\ndressed according to the current fashion plates. By all her hopes of\nmarried comfort she must not be known to have any peculiar or unusual or\npositive notions on any subject more important than embroidery or parlor\ndecoration. Conventionality in the essentials having been thus secured,\nthe brighter and more piquant she could be in small ways and frivolous\nmatters the better for her chances. Have I erred in describing the\nworking of your system in this particular, Julian?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I replied, \"you have described to the life the correct and\nfashionable ideal of feminine education in my time, but there were, you\nmust understand, a great many women who were persons of entirely original\nand serious minds, who dared to think and speak for themselves.\"\n\n\"Of course there were. They were the prototypes of the universal woman of\nto-day. They represented the coming woman, who to-day has come. They had\nbroken for themselves the conventional trammels of their sex, and proved\nto the world the potential equality of women with men in every field of\nthought and action. But while great minds master their circumstances, the\nmass of minds are mastered by them and formed by them. It is when we\nthink of the bearing of the system upon this vast majority of women, and\nhow the virus of moral and mental slavery through their veins entered\ninto the blood of the race, that we realize how tremendous is the\nindictment of humanity against your economic arrangements on account of\nwoman, and how vast a benefit to mankind was the Revolution that gave\nfree mothers to the race-free not merely from physical but from moral and\nintellectual fetters.\n\n\"I referred a moment ago,\" pursued the doctor, \"to the close parallelism\nexisting in your time between the industrial and the sexual situation,\nbetween the relations of the working masses to the capitalists, and those\nof the women to men. It is strikingly illustrated in yet another way.\n\n\"The subjection of the workingmen to the owners of capital was insured by\nthe existence at all times of a large class of the unemployed ready to\nunderbid the workers and eager to get employment at any price and on any\nterms. This was the club with which the capitalist kept down the workers.\nIn like manner it was the existence of a body of unappropriated women\nwhich riveted the yoke of women's subjection to men. When maintenance was\nthe difficult problem it was in your day there were many men who could\nnot maintain themselves, and a vast number who could not maintain women\nin addition to themselves. The failure of a man to marry might cost him\nhappiness, but in the case of women it not only involved loss of\nhappiness, but, as a rule, exposed them to the pressure or peril of\npoverty, for it was a much more difficult thing for women than for men to\nsecure an adequate support by their own efforts. The result was one of\nthe most shocking spectacles the world has ever known--nothing less, in\nfact, than a state of rivalry and competition among women for the\nopportunity of marriage. To realize how helpless were women in your day,\nto assume toward men an attitude of physical, mental, or moral dignity\nand independence, it is enough to remember their terrible disadvantage in\nwhat your contemporaries called with brutal plainness the marriage\nmarket.\n\n\"And still woman's cup of humiliation was not full. There was yet another\nand more dreadful form of competition by her own sex to which she was\nexposed. Not only was there a constant vast surplus of unmarried women\ndesirous of securing the economic support which marriage implied, but\nbeneath these there were hordes of wretched women, hopeless of obtaining\nthe support of men on honorable terms, and eager to sell themselves for a\ncrust. Julian, do you wonder that, of all the aspects of the horrible\nmess you called civilization in the nineteenth century, the sexual\nrelation reeks worst?\"\n\n\"Our philanthropists were greatly disturbed over what we called the\nsocial evil,\" said I--\"that is, the existence of this great multitude of\noutcast women--but it was not common to diagnose it as a part of the\neconomic problem. It was regarded rather as a moral evil resulting from\nthe depravity of the human heart, to be properly dealt with by moral and\nreligious influences.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know. No one in your day, of course, was allowed to intimate\nthat the economic system was radically wicked, and consequently it was\ncustomary to lay off all its hideous consequences upon poor human nature.\nYes, I know there were, people who agreed that it might be possible by\npreaching to lessen the horrors of the social evil while yet the land\ncontained millions of women in desperate need, who had no other means of\ngetting bread save by catering to the desires of men. I am a bit of a\nphrenologist, and have often wished for the chance of examining the\ncranial developments of a nineteenth-century philanthropist who honestly\nbelieved this, if indeed any of them honestly did.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" I said, \"high-spirited women, even in my day, objected to\nthe custom that required them to take their husbands' names on marriage.\nHow do you manage that now?\"\n\n\"Women's names are no more affected by marriage than men's.\"\n\n\"But how about the children?\"\n\n\"Girls take the mother's last name with the father's as a middle name,\nwhile with boys it is just the reverse.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It occurs to me,\" I said, \"that it would be surprising if a fact so\nprofoundly affecting woman's relations with man as her achievement of\neconomic independence, had not modified the previous conventional\nstandards of sexual morality in some respects.\"\n\n\"Say rather,\" replied the doctor, \"that the economic equalization of men\nand women for the first time made it possible to establish their\nrelations on a moral basis. The first condition of ethical action in any\nrelation is the freedom of the actor. So long as women's economic\ndependence upon men prevented them from being free agents in the sexual\nrelation, there could be no ethics of that relation. A proper ethics of\nsexual conduct was first made possible when women became capable of\nindependent action through the attainment of economic equality.\"\n\n\"It would have startled the moralists of my day,\" I said, \"to be told\nthat we had no sexual ethics. We certainly had a very strict and\nelaborate system of 'thou shalt nots.'\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" replied my companion. \"Let us understand each\nother exactly at this point, for the subject is highly important. You\nhad, as you say, a set of very rigid rules and regulations as to the\nconduct of the sexes--that is, especially as to women--but the basis of\nit, for the most part, was not ethical but prudential, the object being\nthe safeguarding of the economic interests of women in their relations\nwith men. Nothing could have been more important to the protection of\nwomen on the whole, although so often bearing cruelly upon them\nindividually, than these rules. They were the only method by which, so\nlong as woman remained an economically helpless and dependent person, she\nand her children could be even partially guarded from masculine abuse and\nneglect. Do not imagine for a moment that I would speak lightly of the\nvalue of this social code to the race during the time it was necessary.\nBut because it was entirely based upon considerations not suggested by\nthe natural sanctities of the sexual relation in itself, but wholly upon\nprudential considerations affecting economic results, it would be an\ninexact use of terms to call it a system of ethics. It would be more\naccurately described as a code of sexual economics--that is to say, a\nset of laws and customs providing for the economic protection of women\nand children in the sexual and family relation.\n\n\"The marriage contract was embellished by a rich embroidery of\nsentimental and religious fancies, but I need not remind you that its\nessence in the eyes of the law and of society was its character as a\ncontract, a strictly economic _quid-pro-quo_ transaction. It was a\nlegal undertaking by the man to maintain the woman and future family in\nconsideration of her surrender of herself to his exclusive disposal--that\nis to say, on condition of obtaining a lien on his property, she became a\npart of it. The only point which the law or the social censor looked to\nas fixing the morality or immorality, purity or impurity, of any sexual\nact was simply the question whether this bargain had been previously\nexecuted in accordance with legal forms. That point properly attended to,\neverything that formerly had been regarded as wrong and impure for the\nparties became rightful and chaste. They might have been persons unfit to\nmarry or to be parents; they might have been drawn together by the basest\nand most sordid motives; the bride may have been constrained by need to\naccept a man she loathed; youth may have been sacrificed to decrepitude,\nand every natural propriety outraged; but according to your standard, if\nthe contract had been legally executed, all that followed was white and\nbeautiful. On the other hand, if the contract had been neglected, and a\nwoman had accepted a lover without it, then, however great their love,\nhowever fit their union in every natural way, the woman was cast out as\nunchaste, impure, and abandoned, and consigned to the living death of\nsocial ignominy. Now let me repeat that we fully recognize the excuse for\nthis social law under your atrocious system as the only possible way of\nprotecting the economic interests of women and children, but to speak of\nit as ethical or moral in its view of the sex relation is certainly about\nas absurd a misuse of words as could be committed. On the contrary, we\nmust say that it was a law which, in order to protect women's material\ninterests, was obliged deliberately to disregard all the laws that are\nwritten on the heart touching such matters.\n\n\"It seems from the records that there was much talk in your day about the\nscandalous fact that there were two distinct moral codes in sexual\nmatters, one for men and another for women--men refusing to be bound by\nthe law imposed on women, and society not even attempting to enforce it\nagainst them. It was claimed by the advocates of one code for both sexes\nthat what was wrong or right for woman was so for man, and that there\nshould be one standard of right and wrong, purity and impurity, morality\nand immorality, for both. That was obviously the correct view of the\nmatter; but what moral gain would there have been for the race even if\nmen could have been induced to accept the women's code--a code so utterly\nunworthy in its central idea of the ethics of the sexual relation?\nNothing but the bitter duress of their economic bondage had forced women\nto accept a law against which the blood of ten thousand stainless\nMarguerites, and the ruined lives of a countless multitude of women,\nwhose only fault had been too tender loving, cried to God perpetually.\nYes, there should doubtless be one standard of conduct for both men and\nwomen as there is now, but it was not to be the slave code, with its\nsordid basis, imposed upon the women by their necessities. The common and\nhigher code for men and women which the conscience of the race demanded\nwould first become possible, and at once thereafter would become assured\nwhen men and women stood over against each other in the sexual relation,\nas in all others, in attitudes of absolute equality and mutual\nindependence.\"\n\n\"After all, doctor,\" I said, \"although at first it startled me a little\nto hear you say that we had no sexual ethics, yet you really say no more,\nnor use stronger words, than did our poets and satirists in treating the\nsame theme. The complete divergence between our conventional sexual\nmorality and the instinctive morality of love was a commonplace with us,\nand furnished, as doubtless you well know, the motive of a large part of\nour romantic and dramatic literature.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"nothing could be added to the force and\nfeeling with which your writers exposed the cruelty and injustice of the\niron law of society as to these matters--a law made doubly cruel and\nunjust by the fact that it bore almost exclusively on women. But their\ndenunciations were wasted, and the plentiful emotions they evoked were\nbarren of result, for the reason that they failed entirely to point out\nthe basic fact that was responsible for the law they attacked, and must\nbe abolished if the law were ever to be replaced by a just ethics. That\nfact, as we have seen, was the system of wealth distribution, by which\nwoman's only hope of comfort and security was made to depend on her\nsuccess in obtaining a legal guarantee of support from some man as the\nprice of her person.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" I observed, \"that when the women, once fairly opened\ntheir eyes to what the revolutionary programme meant for their sex by its\ndemand of economic equality for all, self-interest must have made them\nmore ardent devotees of the cause than even the men.\"\n\n\"It did indeed,\" replied the doctor. \"Of course the blinding, binding\ninfluence of conventionality, tradition, and prejudice, as well as the\ntimidity bred of immemorial servitude, for a long while prevented the\nmass of women from understanding the greatness of the deliverance which\nwas offered them; but when once they did understand it they threw\nthemselves into the revolutionary movement with a unanimity and\nenthusiasm that had a decisive effect upon the struggle. Men might regard\neconomic equality with favor or disfavor, according to their economic\npositions, but every woman, simply because she was a woman, was bound to\nbe for it as soon as she got it through her head what it meant for her\nhalf of the race.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nAT THE GYMNASIUM.\n\nEdith had come up on the house top in time to hear the last of our talk,\nand now she said to her father:\n\n\"Considering what you have been telling Julian about women nowadays as\ncompared with the old days, I wonder if he would not be interested in\nvisiting the gymnasium this afternoon and seeing something of how we\ntrain ourselves? There are going to be some foot races and air races, and\na number of other tests. It is the afternoon when our year has the\ngrounds, and I ought to be there anyway.\"\n\nTo this suggestion, which was eagerly accepted, I owe one of the most\ninteresting and instructive experiences of those early days during which\nI was forming the acquaintance of the twentieth-century civilization.\n\nAt the door of the gymnasium Edith left us to join her class in the\namphitheater.\n\n\"Is she to compete in anything?\" I asked.\n\n\"All her year--that is, all of her age--in this ward will be entered in\nmore or less events.\"\n\n\"What is Edith's specialty?\" I asked.\n\n\"As to specialties,\" replied the doctor, \"our people do not greatly\ncultivate them. Of course, privately they do what they please, but the\nobject of our public training is not so much to develop athletic\nspecialties as to produce an all-around and well-proportioned physical\ndevelopment. We aim first of all to secure a certain standard of strength\nand measurement for legs, thighs, arms, loins, chest, shoulders, neck,\netc. This is not the highest point of perfection either of physique or\nperformance. It is the necessary minimum. All who attain it may be\nregarded as sound and proper men and women. It is then left to them as\nthey please individually to develop themselves beyond that point in\nspecial directions.\n\n\"How long does this public gymnastic education last?\"\n\n\"It is as obligatory as any part of the educational course until the body\nis set, which we put at the age of twenty-four; but it is practically\nkept up through life, although, of course, that is according to just how\none feels.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you take regular exercise in a gymnasium?\"\n\n\"Why should I not? It is no less of an object to me to be well at sixty\nthan it was at twenty.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" said I, \"if I seem surprised you must remember that in my day\nit was an adage that no man over forty-five ought to allow himself to run\nfor a car, and as for women, they stopped running at fifteen, when their\nbodies were put in a vise, their legs in bags, their toes in thumbscrews,\nand they bade farewell to health.\"\n\n\"You do indeed seem to have disagreed terribly with your bodies,\" said\nthe doctor. \"The women ignored theirs altogether, and as for the men, so\nfar as I can make out, up to forty they abused their bodies, and after\nforty their bodies abused them, which, after all, was only fair. The vast\nmass of physical misery caused by weakness and sickness, resulting from\nwholly preventable causes, seems to us, next to the moral aspect of the\nsubject, to be one of the largest single items chargeable to your system\nof economic inequality, for to that primal cause nearly every feature of\nthe account appears directly or indirectly traceable. Neither souls nor\nbodies could be considered by your men in their mad struggle for a\nliving, and for a grip on the livelihood of others, while the complicated\nsystem of bondage under which the women were held perverted mind and body\nalike, till it was a wonder if there were any health left in them.\"\n\nOn entering the amphitheater we saw gathered at one end of the arena some\ntwo or three hundred young men and women talking and lounging. These, the\ndoctor told me, were Edith's companions of the class of 1978, being all\nthose of twenty-two years of age, born in that ward or since coming there\nto live. I viewed with admiration the figures of these young men and\nwomen, all strong and beautiful as the gods and goddesses of Olympus.\n\n\"Am I to understand,\" I asked, \"that this is a fair sample of your youth,\nand not a picked assembly of the more athletic?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied; \"all the youth in their twenty-third year who\nlive in this ward are here to-day, with perhaps two or three exceptions\non account of some special reason.\"\n\n\"But where are the cripples, the deformed, the feeble, the consumptive?\"\n\n\"Do you see that young man yonder in the chair with so many of the others\nabout him?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Ah! there is then at least one invalid?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my companion: \"he met with an accident, and will never be\nvigorous. He is the only sickly one of the class, and you see how much\nthe others make of him. Your cripples and sickly were so many that pity\nitself grew weary and spent of tears, and compassion callous with use;\nbut with us they are so few as to be our pets and darlings.\"\n\nAt that moment a bugle sounded, and some scores of young men and women\ndashed by us in a foot race. While they ran, the bugle continued to sound\na nerve-bracing strain. The thing that astonished me was the evenness of\nthe finish, in view of the fact that the contestants were not specially\ntrained for racing, but were merely the group which in the round of tests\nhad that day come to the running test. In a race of similarly unselected\ncompetitors in my day, they would have been strung along the track from\nthe finish to the half, and the most of them nearest that.\n\n\"Edith, I see, was third in,\" said the doctor, reading from the signals.\n\"She will be pleased to have done so well, seeing you were here.\"\n\nThe next event was a surprise. I had noticed a group of youths on a lofty\nplatform at the far end of the amphitheater making some sort of\npreparations, and wondered what they were going to do. Now suddenly, at\nthe sound of a trumpet, I saw them leap forward over the edge of the\nplatform. I gave an involuntary cry of horror, for it was a deadly\ndistance to the ground below.\n\n\"It's all right,\" laughed the doctor, and the next moment I was staring\nup at a score of young men and women charging through the air fifty feet\nabove the race course.\n\nThen followed contests in ball-throwing and putting the shot.\n\n\"It is plain where your women get their splendid chests and shoulders,\"\nsaid I.\n\n\"You have noticed that, then!\" exclaimed the doctor.\n\n\"I have certainly noticed,\" was my answer, \"that your modern women seem\ngenerally to possess a vigorous development and appearance of power above\nthe waist which were only occasionally seen in our day.\"\n\n\"You will be interested, no doubt,\" said the doctor, \"to have your\nimpression corroborated by positive evidence. Suppose we leave the\namphitheater for a few minutes and step into the anatomical rooms. It is\nindeed a rare fortune for an anatomical enthusiast like myself to have a\npupil so well qualified to be appreciative, to whom to point out the\neffect our principle of social equality, and the best opportunities of\nculture for all, have had in modifying toward perfection the human form\nin general, and especially the female figure. I say especially the female\nfigure, for that had been most perverted in your day by the influences\nwhich denied woman a full life. Here are a group of plaster statues,\nbased on the lines handed down to us by the anthropometric experts of the\nlast decades of the nineteenth century, to whom we are vastly indebted.\nYou will observe, as your remark just now indicated that you had\nobserved, that the tendency was to a spindling and inadequate development\nabove the waist and an excessive development below. The figure seemed a\nlittle as if it had softened and run down like a sugar cast in warm\nweather. See, the front breadth flat measurement of the hips is actually\ngreater than across the shoulders, whereas it ought to be an inch or two\nless, and the bulbous effect must have been exaggerated by the bulging\nmass of draperies your women accumulated about the waist.\"\n\nAt his words I raised my eyes to the stony face of the woman figure, the\ncharms of which he had thus disparaged, and it seemed to me that the\nsightless eyes rested on mine with an expression of reproach, of which my\nheart instantly confessed the justice. I had been the contemporary of\nthis type of women, and had been indebted to the light of their eyes for\nall that made life worth living. Complete or not, as might be their\nbeauty by modern standards, through them I had learned to know the stress\nof the ever-womanly, and been made an initiate of Nature's sacred\nmysteries. Well might these stony eyes reproach me for consenting by my\nsilence to the disparagement of charms to which I owed so much, by a man\nof another age.\n\n\"Hush, doctor, hush!\" I exclaimed. \"No doubt you are right, but it is not\nfor me to hear these words.\"\n\nI could not find the language to explain what was in my mind, but it was\nnot necessary. The doctor understood, and his keen gray eyes glistened as\nhe laid his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"Right, my boy, quite right! That is the thing for you to say, and Edith\nwould like you the better for your words, for women nowadays are jealous\nfor one another's honor, as I judge they were not in your day. But, on\nthe other hand, if there were present in this room disembodied shades of\nthose women of your day, they would rejoice more than any others could at\nthe fairer, ampler temples liberty has built for their daughters' souls\nto dwell in.\n\n\"Look!\" he added, pointing to another figure; \"this is the typical woman\nof to-day, the lines not ideal, but based on an average of measurements\nfor the purpose of scientific comparison. First, you will observe that\nthe figure is over two inches taller than the other. Note the shoulders!\nThey have gained two inches in width relatively to the hips, as compared\nwith the figure we have been examining. On the other hand, the girth at\nthe hips is greater, showing more powerful muscular development. The\nchest is an inch and a half deeper, while the abdominal measure is fully\ntwo inches deeper. These increased developments are all over and above\nwhat the mere increase in stature would call for. As to the general\ndevelopment of the muscular system, you will see there is simply no\ncomparison.\n\n\"Now, what is the explanation? Simply the effect upon woman of the full,\nfree, untrammeled physical life to which her economic independence opened\nthe way. To develop the shoulders, arms, chest, loins, legs, and body\ngenerally, exercise is needed--not mild and gentle, but vigorous,\ncontinuous exertion, undertaken not spasmodically but regularly. There is\nno dispensation of Providence that will or ever would give a woman\nphysical development on any other terms than those by which men have\nacquired their development. But your women had recourse to no such means.\nTheir work had been confined for countless ages to a multiplicity of\npetty tasks--hand work and finger work--tasks wearing to body and mind in\nthe extreme, but of a sort wholly failing to provoke that reaction of the\nvital forces which builds up and develops the parts exercised. From time\nimmemorial the boy had gone out to dig and hunt with his father, or\ncontend for the mastery with other youths while the girl stayed at home\nto spin and bake. Up to fifteen she might share with her brother a few of\nhis more insipid sports, but with the beginnings of womanhood came the\nend of all participation in active physical outdoor life. What could be\nexpected save what resulted--a dwarfed and enfeebled physique and a\nsemi-invalid existence? The only wonder is that, after so long a period\nof bodily repression and perversion, the feminine physique should have\nresponded, by so great an improvement in so brief a period, to the free\nlife opened up to woman within the last century.\"\n\n\"We had very many beautiful women; physically perfect they seemed at\nleast to us,\" I said.\n\n\"Of course you did, and no doubt they were the perfect types you deemed\nthem,\" replied the doctor. \"They showed you what Nature meant the whole\nsex to be. But am I wrong in assuming that ill health was a general\ncondition among your women? Certainly the records tell us so. If we may\nbelieve them, four fifths of the practice of doctors was among women, and\nit seemed to do them mighty little good either, although perhaps I ought\nnot to reflect on my own profession. The fact is, they could not do\nanything, and probably knew they couldn't, so long as the social customs\ngoverning women remained unchanged.\"\n\n\"Of course you are right enough as to the general fact,\" I replied.\n\"Indeed, a great writer had given currency to a generally accepted maxim\nwhen he said that invalidism was the normal condition of woman.\"\n\n\"I remember that expression. What a confession it was of the abject\nfailure of your civilization to solve the most fundamental proposition of\nhappiness for half the race! Woman's invalidism was one of the great\ntragedies of your civilization, and her physical rehabilitation is one of\nthe greatest single elements in the total increment of happiness which\neconomic equality has brought the human race. Consider what is implied in\nthe transformation of the woman's world of sighs and tears and suffering,\nas you know it, into the woman's world of to-day, with its atmosphere of\ncheer and joy and overflowing vigor and vitality!\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"one thing is not quite clear to me. Without being a\nphysician, or knowing more of such matters than a young man might be\nsupposed to, I have yet understood in a general way that the weakness and\ndelicacy of women's physical condition had their causes in certain\nnatural disabilities of the sex.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it was the general notion in your day that woman's physical\nconstitution doomed her by its necessary effect to be sick, wretched, and\nunhappy, and that at most her condition could not be rendered more than\ntolerable in a physical sense. A more blighting blasphemy against Nature\nnever found expression. No natural function ought to cause constant\nsuffering or disease; and if it does, the rational inference is that\nsomething is wrong in the circumstances. The Orientals invented the myth\nof Eve and the apple, and the curse pronounced upon her, to explain the\nsorrows and infirmities of the sex, which were, in fact, a consequence,\nnot of God's wrath, but of man-made conditions and customs. If you once\nadmit that these sorrows and infirmities are inseparable from woman's\nnatural constitution, why, then there is no logical explanation but to\naccept that myth as a matter of history. There were, however, plentiful\nillustrations already in your day of the great differences in the\nphysical conditions of women under different circumstances and different\nsocial environments to convince unprejudiced minds that thoroughly\nhealthful conditions which should be maintained a sufficiently long\nperiod would lead to a physical rehabilitation for woman that would quite\nredeem from its undeserved obloquy the reputation of her Creator.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand that maternity now is unattended with risk or\nsuffering?\"\n\n\"It is not nowadays an experience which is considered at all critical\neither in its actual occurrence or consequences. As to the other supposed\nnatural disabilities which your wise men used to make so much of as\nexcuses for keeping women in economic subjection, they have ceased to\ninvolve any physical disturbance whatever.\n\n\"And the end of this physical rebuilding of the feminine physique is not\nyet in view. While men still retain superiority in certain lines of\nathletics, we believe the sexes will yet stand on a plane of entire\nphysical equality, with differences only as between individuals.\"\n\n\"There is one question,\" said I, \"which this wonderful physical rebirth\nof woman suggests. You say that she is already the physical equal of man,\nand that your physiologists anticipate in a few generations more her\nevolution to a complete equality with him. That amounts to saying, does\nit not, that normally and potentially she always has been man's physical\nequal and that nothing but adverse circumstances and conditions have ever\nmade her seem less than his equal?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"How, then, do you account for the fact that she has in all ages and\ncountries since the dawn of history, with perhaps a few doubtful and\ntransient exceptions, been his physical subject and thrall? If she ever\nwas his equal, why did she cease to become so, and by a rule so\nuniversal? If her inferiority since historic times may be ascribed to\nunfavorable man-made conditions, why, if she was his equal, did she\npermit those conditions to be imposed upon her? A philosophical theory as\nto how a condition is to cease should contain a rational suggestion as to\nhow it arose.\"\n\n\"Very true indeed,\" replied the doctor. \"Your question is practical. The\ntheory of those who hold that woman will yet be man's full equal in\nphysical vigor necessarily implies, as you suggest, that she must\nprobably once have been his actual equal, and calls for an explanation of\nthe loss of that equality. Suppose man and woman actual physical equals\nat some point of the past. There remains a radical difference in their\nrelation as sexes--namely, that man can passionally appropriate woman\nagainst her will if he can overpower her, while woman can not, even if\ndisposed, so appropriate man without his full volition, however great her\nsuperiority of force. I have often speculated as to the reason of this\nradical difference, lying as it does at the root of all the sex tyranny\nof the past, now happily for evermore replaced by mutuality. It has\nsometimes seemed to me that it was Nature's provision to keep the race\nalive in periods of its evolution when life was not worth living save for\na far-off posterity's sake. This end, we may say, she shrewdly secured by\nvesting the aggressive and appropriating power in the sex relation in\nthat sex which had to bear the least part of the consequences resultant\non its exercise. We may call the device a rather mean one on Nature's\npart, but it was well calculated to effect the purpose. But for it, owing\nto the natural and rational reluctance of the child-bearing sex to assume\na burden so bitter and so seemingly profitless, the race might easily\nhave been exposed to the risk of ceasing utterly during the darker\nperiods of its upward evolution.\n\n\"But let us come back to the specific question we were talking about.\nSuppose man and woman in some former age to have been, on the whole,\nphysically equal, sex for sex. Nevertheless, there would be many\nindividual variations. Some of each sex would be stronger than others of\ntheir own sex. Some men would be stronger than some women, and as many\nwomen be stronger than some men. Very good; we know that well within\nhistoric times the savage method of taking wives has been by forcible\ncapture. Much more may we suppose force to have been used wherever\npossible in more primitive periods. Now, a strong woman would have no\nobject to gain in making captive a weaker man for any sexual purpose, and\nwould not therefore pursue him. Conversely, however, strong men would\nhave an object in making captive and keeping as their wives women weaker\nthan themselves. In seeking to capture wives, men would naturally avoid\nthe stronger women, whom they might have difficulty in dominating, and\nprefer as mates the weaker individuals, who would be less able to resist\ntheir will. On the other hand, the weaker of the men would find it\nrelatively difficult to capture any mates at all, and would be\nconsequently less likely to leave progeny. Do you see the inference?\"\n\n\"It is plain enough,\" I replied. \"You mean that the stronger women and\nthe weaker men would both be discriminated against, and that the types\nwhich survived would be the stronger of the men and the weaker of the\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. Now, suppose a difference in the physical strength of the\nsexes to have become well established through this process in prehistoric\ntimes, before the dawn of civilization, the rest of the story follows\nvery simply. The now confessedly dominant sex would, of course, seek to\nretain and increase its domination and the now fully subordinated sex\nwould in time come to regard the inferiority to which it was born as\nnatural, inevitable, and Heaven-ordained. And so it would go on as it did\ngo on, until the world's awakening, at the end of the last century, to\nthe necessity and possibility of a reorganization of human society on a\nmoral basis, the first principle of which must be the equal liberty and\ndignity of all human beings. Since then women have been reconquering, as\nthey will later fully reconquer, their pristine physical equality with\nmen.\"\n\n\"A rather alarming notion occurs to me,\" said I. \"What if woman should in\nthe end not only equal but excel man in physical and mental powers, as he\nhas her in the past, and what if she should take as mean an advantage of\nthat superiority as he did?\"\n\nThe doctor laughed. \"I think you need not be apprehensive that such a\nsuperiority, even if attained, would be abused. Not that women, as such,\nare any more safely to be trusted with irresponsible power than men, but\nfor the reason that the race is rising fast toward the plane already in\npart attained in which spiritual forces will fully dominate all things,\nand questions of physical power will cease to be of any importance in\nhuman relations. The control and leading of humanity go already largely,\nand are plainly destined soon to go wholly, to those who have the largest\nsouls--that is to say, to those who partake most of the Spirit of the\nGreater Self; and that condition is one which in itself is the most\nabsolute guarantee against the misuse of that power for selfish ends,\nseeing that with such misuse it would cease to be a power.\"\n\n\"The Greater Self--what does that mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is one of our names for the soul and for God,\" replied the doctor,\n\"but that is too great a theme to enter on now.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nECONOMIC SUICIDE OF THE PROFIT SYSTEM.\n\nThe morning following, Edith received a call to report at her post of\nduty for some special occasion. After she had gone, I sought out the\ndoctor in the library and began to ply him with questions, of which, as\nusual, a store had accumulated in my mind overnight.\n\n\"If you desire to continue your historical studies this morning,\" he said\npresently, \"I am going to propose a change of teachers.\"\n\n\"I am very well satisfied with the one whom Providence assigned to me,\" I\nanswered, \"but it is quite natural you should want a little relief from\nsuch persistent cross-questioning.\"\n\n\"It is not that at all,\" replied the doctor. \"I am sure no one could\nconceivably have a more inspiring task than mine has been, nor have I any\nidea of giving it up as yet. But it occurred to me that a little change\nin the method and medium of instruction this morning might be agreeable.\"\n\n\"Who is to be the new teacher?\" I asked.\n\n\"There are to be a number of them, and they are not teachers at all, but\npupils.\"\n\n\"Come, doctor,\" I protested, \"don't you think a man in my position has\nenough riddles to guess, without making them up for him?\"\n\n\"It sounds like a riddle, doesn't it? But it is not. However, I will\nhasten to explain. As one of those citizens to whom for supposed public\nservices the people have voted the blue ribbon, I have various honorary\nfunctions as to public matters, and especially educational affairs. This\nmorning I have notice of an examination at ten o'clock of the ninth grade\nin the Arlington School. They have been studying the history of the\nperiod before the great Revolution, and are going to give their general\nimpressions of it. I thought that perhaps, by way of a change, you might\nbe interested in listening to them, especially in view of the special\ntopic they are going to discuss.\"\n\nI assured the doctor that no programme could promise more entertainment.\n\"What is the topic they discuss?\" I inquired.\n\n\"The profit system as a method of economic suicide is their theme,\"\nreplied the doctor. \"In our talks hitherto we have chiefly touched on the\nmoral wrongfulness of the old economic order. In the discussion we shall\nlisten to this morning there will be no reference unless incidentally to\nmoral considerations. The young people will endeavor to show us that\nthere were certain inherent and fatal defects in private capitalism as a\nmachine for producing wealth which, quite apart from its ethical\ncharacter, made its abolition necessary if the race was ever to get out\nof the mire of poverty.\"\n\n\"That is a very different doctrine from the preaching I used to hear,\" I\nsaid. \"The clergy and moralists in general assured us that there were no\nsocial evils for which moral and religious medicine was not adequate.\nPoverty, they said, was in the end the result of human depravity, and\nwould disappear if everybody would only be good.\"\n\n\"So we read,\" said the doctor. \"How far the clergy and the moralists\npreached this doctrine with a professional motive as calculated to\nenhance the importance of their services as moral instructors, how far\nthey merely echoed it as an excuse for mental indolence, and how far they\nmay really have been sincere, we can not judge at this distance, but\ncertainly more injurious nonsense was never taught. The industrial and\ncommercial system by which the labor of a great population is organized\nand directed constitutes a complex machine. If the machine is constructed\nunscientifically, it will result in loss and disaster, without the\nslightest regard to whether the managers are the rarest of saints or the\nworst of sinners. The world always has had and will have need of all the\nvirtue and true religion that men can be induced to practice; but to tell\nfarmers that personal religion will take the place of a scientific\nagriculture, or the master of an unseaworthy ship that the practice of\ngood morals will bring his craft to shore, would be no greater\nchildishness than the priests and moralists of your day committed in\nassuring a world beggared by a crazy economic system that the secret of\nplenty was good works and personal piety. History gives a bitter chapter\nto these blind guides, who, during the revolutionary period, did far more\nharm than those who openly defended the old order, because, while the\nbrutal frankness of the latter repelled good men, the former misled them\nand long diverted from the guilty system the indignation which otherwise\nwould have sooner destroyed it.\n\n\"And just here let me say, Julian, as a most important point for you to\nremember in the history of the great Revolution, that it was not until\nthe people had outgrown this childish teaching and saw the causes of the\nworld's want and misery, not primarily in human depravity, but in the\neconomic madness of the profit system on which private capitalism\ndepended, that the Revolution began to go forward in earnest.\"\n\nNow, although the doctor had said that the school we were to visit was in\nArlington, which I knew to be some distance out of the city, and that the\nexamination would take place at ten o'clock, he continued to sit\ncomfortably in his chair, though the time was five minutes of ten.\n\n\"Is this Arlington the same town that was a suburb of the city in my\ntime?\" I presently ventured to inquire.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"It was then ten or twelve miles from the city,\" I said.\n\n\"It has not been moved, I assure you,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Then if not, and if the examination is to begin in five minutes, are we\nnot likely to be late?\" I mildly observed.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied the doctor, \"there are three or four minutes left yet.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" said I, \"I have been introduced within the last few days to\nmany new and speedy modes of locomotion, but I can't see how you are\ngoing to get me to Arlington from here in time for the examination that\nbegins three minutes hence, unless you reduce me to an electrified\nsolution, send me by wire, and have me precipitated back to my shape at\nthe other end of the line; and even in that case I should suppose we had\nno time to waste.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't have, certainly, if we were intending to go to Arlington\neven by that process. It did not occur to me that you would care to go,\nor we might just as well have started earlier. It is too bad!\"\n\n\"I did not care about visiting Arlington.\" I replied, \"but I assumed that\nit would be rather necessary to do so if I were to attend an examination\nat that place. I see my mistake. I ought to have learned by this time not\nto take for granted that any of what we used to consider the laws of\nNature are still in force.\"\n\n\"The laws of Nature are all right,\" laughed the doctor. \"But is it\npossible that Edith has not shown you the electroscope?\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"It does for vision what the telephone does for hearing,\" replied the\ndoctor, and, leading the way to the music room, he showed me the\napparatus.\n\n\"It is ten o'clock,\" he said, \"and we have no time for explanations now.\nTake this chair and adjust the instrument as you see me do. Now!\"\n\nInstantly, without warning, or the faintest preparation for what was\ncoming, I found myself looking into the interior of a large room. Some\ntwenty boys and girls, thirteen to fourteen years of age, occupied a\ndouble row of chairs arranged in the form of a semicircle about a desk at\nwhich a young man was seated with his back to us. The rows of students\nwere facing us, apparently not twenty feet away. The rustling of their\ngarments and every change of expression in their mobile faces were as\ndistinct to my eyes and ears as if we had been directly behind the\nteacher, as indeed we seemed to be. At the moment the scene had flashed\nupon me I was in the act of making some remark to the doctor. As I\nchecked myself, he laughed. \"You need not be afraid of interrupting\nthem,\" he said. \"They don't see or hear us, though we both see and hear\nthem so well. They are a dozen miles away.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I whispered--for, in spite of his assurance, I could not\nrealize that they did not hear me--\"are we here or there?\"\n\n\"We are here certainly,\" replied the doctor, \"but our eyes and ears are\nthere. This is the electroscope and telephone combined. We could have\nheard the examination just as well without the electroscope, but I\nthought you would be better entertained if you could both see and hear.\nFine-looking young people, are they not? We shall see now whether they\nare as intelligent as they are handsome.\"\n\nHOW PROFITS CUT DOWN CONSUMPTION.\n\n\"Our subject this morning,\" said the teacher briskly, \"is 'The Economic\nSuicide of Production for Profit,' or 'The Hopelessness of the Economic\nOutlook of the Race under Private Capitalism.'--Now, Frank, will you tell\nus exactly what this proposition means?\"\n\nAt these words one of the boys of the class rose to his feet.\n\n\"It means,\" he said, \"that communities which depended--as they had to\ndepend, so long as private capitalism lasted--upon the motive of profit\nmaking for the production of the things by which they lived, must always\nsuffer poverty, because the profit system, by its necessary nature,\noperated to stop limit and cripple production at the point where it began\nto be efficient.\"\n\n\"By what is the possible production of wealth limited?\"\n\n\"By its consumption.\"\n\n\"May not production fall short of possible consumption? May not the\ndemand for consumption exceed the resources of production?\"\n\n\"Theoretically it may, but not practically--that is, speaking of demand\nas limited to rational desires, and not extending to merely fanciful\nobjects. Since the division of labor was introduced, and especially since\nthe great inventions multiplied indefinitely the powers of man,\nproduction has been practically limited only by the demand created by\nconsumption.\"\n\n\"Was this so before the great Revolution?\"\n\n\"Certainly. It was a truism among economists that either England,\nGermany, or the United States alone could easily have supplied the\nworld's whole consumption of manufactured goods. No country began to\nproduce up to its capacity in any line.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"On account of the necessary law of the profit system, by which it\noperated to limit production.\"\n\n\"In what way did this law operate?\"\n\n\"By creating a gap between the producing and consuming power of the\ncommunity, the result of which was that the people were not able to\nconsume as much as they could produce.\"\n\n\"Please tell us just how the profit system led to this result.\"\n\n\"There being under the old order of things,\" replied the boy Frank, \"no\ncollective agency to undertake the organization of labor and exchange,\nthat function naturally fell into the hands of enterprising individuals\nwho, because the undertaking called for much capital, had to be\ncapitalists. They were of two general classes--the capitalist who\norganized labor for production; and the traders, the middlemen, and\nstorekeepers, who organized distribution, and having collected all the\nvarieties of products in the market, sold them again to the general\npublic for consumption. The great mass of the people--nine, perhaps, out\nof ten--were wage-earners who sold their labor to the producing\ncapitalists; or small first-hand producers, who sold their personal\nproduct to the middlemen. The farmers were of the latter class. With the\nmoney the wage-earners and farmers received in wages, or as the price of\ntheir produce, they afterward went into the market, where the products of\nall sorts were assembled, and bought back as much as they could for\nconsumption. Now, of course, the capitalists, whether engaged in\norganizing production or distribution, had to have some inducement for\nrisking their capital and spending their time in this work. That\ninducement was profit.\"\n\n\"Tell us how the profits were collected.\"\n\n\"The manufacturing or employing capitalists paid the people who worked\nfor them, and the merchants paid the farmers for their products in tokens\ncalled money, which were good to buy back the blended products of all in\nthe market. But the capitalists gave neither the wage-earner nor the\nfarmer enough of these money tokens to buy back the equivalent of the\nproduct of his labor. The difference which the capitalists kept back for\nthemselves was their profit. It was collected by putting a higher price\non the products when sold in the stores than the cost of the product had\nbeen to the capitalists.\"\n\n\"Give us an example.\"\n\n\"We will take then, first, the manufacturing capitalist, who employed\nlabor. Suppose he manufactured shoes. Suppose for each pair of shoes he\npaid ten cents to the tanner for leather, twenty cents for the labor of\nputting, the shoe together, and ten cents for all other labor in any way\nentering into the making of the shoe, so that the pair cost him in\nactual outlay forty cents. He sold the shoes to a middleman for, say,\nseventy-five cents. The middleman sold them to the retailer for a dollar,\nand the retailer sold them over his counter to the consumer for a dollar\nand a half. Take next the case of the farmer, who sold not merely his\nlabor like the wage-earner, but his labor blended with his material.\nSuppose he sold his wheat to the grain merchant for forty cents a bushel.\nThe grain merchant, in selling it to the flouring mill, would ask, say,\nsixty cents a bushel. The flouring mill would sell it to the wholesale\nflour merchant for a price over and above the labor cost of milling at a\nfigure which would include a handsome profit for him. The wholesale flour\nmerchant would add another profit in selling to the retail grocer, and\nthe last yet another in selling to the consumer. So that finally the\nequivalent of the bushel of wheat in finished flour as bought back by the\noriginal farmer for consumption would cost him, on account of profit\ncharges alone, over and above the actual labor cost of intermediate\nprocesses, perhaps twice what he received for it from the grain\nmerchant.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the teacher. \"Now for the practical effect of this\nsystem.\"\n\n\"The practical effect,\" replied the boy, \"was necessarily to create a gap\nbetween the producing and consuming power of those engaged in the\nproduction of the things upon which profits were charged. Their ability\nto consume would be measured by the value of the money tokens they\nreceived for producing the goods, which by the statement was less than\nthe value put upon those goods in the stores. That difference would\nrepresent a gap between what they could produce and what they could\nconsume.\"\n\nMARGARET TELLS ABOUT THE DEADLY GAP.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said the teacher, \"you may now take up the subject where\nFrank leaves it, and tell us what would be the effect upon the economic\nsystem of a people of such a gap between its consuming and producing\npower as Frank shows us was caused by profit taking.\"\n\n\"The effect,\" said the girl who answered to the name of Margaret, \"would\ndepend on two factors: first, on how numerous a body were the\nwage-earners and first producers, on whose products the profits were\ncharged; and, second, how large was the rate of profit charged, and the\nconsequent discrepancy between the producing and consuming power of each\nindividual of the working body. If the producers on whose product a\nprofit was charged were but a handful of the people, the total effect of\ntheir inability to buy back and consume more than a part of their product\nwould create but a slight gap between the producing and consuming power\nof the community as a whole. If, on the other hand, they constituted a\nlarge proportion of the whole population, the gap would be\ncorrespondingly great, and the reactive effect to check production would\nbe disastrous in proportion.\"\n\n\"And what was the actual proportion of the total population made up by\nthe wage-earners and original producers, who by the profit system were\nprevented from consuming as much as they produced?\"\n\n\"It constituted, as Frank has said, at least nine tenths of the whole\npeople, probably more. The profit takers, whether they were organizers of\nproduction or of distribution, were a group numerically insignificant,\nwhile those on whose product the profits were charged constituted the\nbulk of the community.\"\n\n\"Very well. We will now consider the other factor on which the size of\nthe gap between the producing and consuming power of the community\ncreated by the profit system was dependent--namely, the rate of profits\ncharged. Tell us, then, what was the rule followed by the capitalists in\ncharging profits. No doubt, as rational men who realized the effect of\nhigh profits to prevent consumption, they made a point of making their\nprofits as low as possible.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, the capitalists made their profits as high as possible.\nTheir maxim was, 'Tax the traffic all it will bear.'\"\n\n\"Do you mean that instead of trying to minimize the effect of profit\ncharging to diminish consumption, they deliberately sought to magnify it\nto the greatest possible degree?\"\n\n\"I mean that precisely,\" replied Margaret. \"The golden rule of the profit\nsystem, the great motto of the capitalists, was, 'Buy in the Cheapest\nMarket, and sell in the Dearest.'\"\n\n\"What did that mean?\"\n\n\"It meant that the capitalist ought to pay the least possible to those\nwho worked for him or sold him their produce, and on the other hand\nshould charge the highest possible price for their product when he\noffered it for sale to the general public in the market.\"\n\n\"That general public,\" observed the teacher, \"being chiefly composed of\nthe workers to whom he and his fellow-capitalists had just been paying as\nnearly nothing as possible for creating the product which they were now\nexpected to buy back at the highest possible price.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, let us try to realize the full economic wisdom of this rule as\napplied to the business of a nation. It means, doesn't it, Get something\nfor nothing, or as near nothing as you can. Well, then, if you can get it\nfor absolutely nothing, you are carrying out the maxim to perfection. For\nexample, if a manufacturer could hypnotize his workmen so as to get them\nto work for him for no wages at all, he would be realizing the full\nmeaning of the maxim, would he not?\"\n\n\"Certainly; a manufacturer who could do that, and then put the product of\nhis unpaid workmen on the market at the usual price, would have become\nrich in a very short time.\"\n\n\"And the same would be true, I suppose, of a grain merchant who was able\nto take such advantage of the farmers as to obtain their grain for\nnothing, afterward selling it at the top price.\"\n\n\"Certainly. He would become a millionaire at once.\"\n\n\"Well, now, suppose the secret of this hypnotizing process should get\nabroad among the capitalists engaged in production and exchange, and\nshould be generally applied by them so that all of them were able to get\nworkmen without wages, and buy produce without paying anything for it,\nthen doubtless all the capitalists at once would become fabulously rich.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Dear me! why not?\"\n\n\"Because if the whole body of wage-earners failed to receive any wages\nfor their work, and the farmers received nothing for their produce, there\nwould be nobody to buy anything, and the market would collapse entirely.\nThere would be no demand for any goods except what little the capitalists\nthemselves and their friends could consume. The working people would then\npresently starve, and the capitalists be left to do their own work.\"\n\n\"Then it appears that what would be good for the particular capitalist,\nif he alone did it, would be ruinous to him and everybody else if all the\ncapitalists did it. Why was this?\"\n\n\"Because the particular capitalist, in expecting to get rich by\nunderpaying his employees, would calculate on selling his produce, not to\nthe particular group of workmen he had cheated, but to the community at\nlarge, consisting of the employees of other capitalists not so successful\nin cheating their workmen, who therefore would have something to buy\nwith. The success of his trick depended on the presumption that his\nfellow-capitalists would not succeed in practicing the same trick. If\nthat presumption failed, and all the capitalists succeeded at once in\ndealing with their employees, as all were trying to do, the result would\nbe to stop the whole industrial system outright.\"\n\n\"It appears, then, that in the profit system we have an economic method,\nof which the working rule only needed to be applied thoroughly enough in\norder to bring the system to a complete standstill and that all which\nkept the system going was the difficulty found in fully carrying out the\nworking rule.\n\n\"That was precisely so,\" replied the girl; \"the individual capitalist\ngrew rich fastest who succeeded best in beggaring those whose labor or\nproduce he bought; but obviously it was only necessary for enough\ncapitalists to succeed in so doing in order to involve capitalists and\npeople alike in general ruin. To make the sharpest possible bargain with\nthe employer or producer, to give him the least possible return for his\nlabor or product, was the ideal every capitalist must constantly keep\nbefore him, and yet it was mathematically certain that every such sharp\nbargain tended to undermine the whole business fabric, and that it was\nonly necessary that enough capitalists should succeed in making enough\nsuch sharp bargains to topple the fabric over.\"\n\n\"One question more. The bad effects of a bad system are always aggravated\nby the willfulness of men who take advantage of it, and so, no doubt, the\nprofit system was made by selfish men to work worse than it might have\ndone. Now, suppose the capitalists had all been fair-minded men and not\nextortioners, and had made their charges for their services as small as\nwas consistent with reasonable gains and self-protection, would that\ncourse have involved such a reduction of profit charges as would have\ngreatly helped the people to consume their products and thus to promote\nproduction?\"\n\n\"It would not,\" replied the girl. \"The antagonism of the profit system to\neffective wealth production arose from causes inherent in and inseparable\nfrom private capitalism; and so long as private capitalism was retained,\nthose causes must have made the profit system inconsistent with any\neconomic improvement in the condition of the people, even if the\ncapitalists had been, angels. The root of the evil was not moral, but\nstrictly economic.\"\n\n\"But would not the rate of profits have been much reduced in the case\nsupposed?\"\n\n\"In some instances temporarily no doubt, but not generally, and in no\ncase permanently. It is doubtful if profits, on the whole, were higher\nthan they had to be to encourage capitalists to undertake production and\ntrade.\"\n\n\"Tell us why the profits had to be so large for this purpose.\"\n\n\"Legitimate profits under private capitalism,\" replied the girl\nMargaret--\"that is, such profits as men going into production or trade\nmust in self-protection calculate upon, however well disposed toward the\npublic--consisted of three elements, all growing out of conditions\ninseparable from private capitalism, none of which longer exist. First,\nthe capitalist must calculate on at least as large a return on the\ncapital he was to put into the venture as he could obtain by lending it\non good security--that is to say, the ruling rate of interest. If he were\nnot sure of that, he would prefer to lend his capital. But that was not\nenough. In going into business he risked the entire loss of his capital,\nas he would not if it were lent on good security. Therefore, in addition\nto the ruling rate of interest on capital, his profits must cover the\ncost of insurance on the capital risked--that is, there must be a\nprospect of gains large enough in case the venture succeeded to cover the\nrisk of loss of capital in case of failure. If the chances of failure,\nfor instance, were even, he must calculate on more than a hundred per\ncent profit in case of success. In point of fact, the chances of failure\nin business and loss of capital in those days were often far more than\neven. Business was indeed little more than a speculative risk, a lottery\nin which the blanks greatly outnumbered the prizes. The prizes to tempt\ninvestment must therefore be large. Moreover, if a capitalist were\npersonally to take charge of the business in which he invested his\ncapital, he would reasonably have expected adequate wages of\nsuperintendence--compensation, in other words, for his skill and judgment\nin navigating the venture through the stormy waters of the business sea,\ncompared with which, as it was in that day, the North Atlantic in\nmidwinter is a mill pond. For this service he would be considered\njustified in making a large addition to the margin of profit charged.\"\n\n\"Then you conclude, Margaret, that, even if disposed to be fair toward\nthe community, a capitalist of those days would not have been able safely\nto reduce his rate of profits sufficiently to bring the people much\nnearer the point of being able to consume their products than they were.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. The root of the evil lay in the tremendous difficulties,\ncomplexities, mistakes, risks, and wastes with which private capitalism\nnecessarily involved the processes of production and distribution, which\nunder public capitalism have become so entirely simple, expeditious, and\ncertain.\"\n\n\"Then it seems it is not necessary to consider our capitalist ancestors\nmoral monsters in order to account for the tragical outcome of their\neconomic methods.\"\n\n\"By no means. The capitalists were no doubt good and bad, like other\npeople, but probably stood up as well as any people could against the\ndepraving influences of a system which in fifty years would have turned\nheaven itself into hell.\"\n\nMARION EXPLAINS OVER-PRODUCTION.\n\n\"That will do, Margaret,\" said the teacher. \"We will next ask you,\nMarion, to assist us in further elucidating the subject. If the profit\nsystem worked according to the description we have listened to, we shall\nbe prepared to learn that the economic situation was marked by the\nexistence of large stores of consumable goods in the hands of the profit\ntakers which they would be glad to sell, and, on the other hand, by a\ngreat population composed of the original producers of the goods, who\nwere in sharp need of the goods but unable to purchase them. How does\nthis theory agree with the facts stated in the histories?\"\n\n\"So well,\" replied Marion, \"that one might almost think you had been\nreading them.\" At which the class smiled, and so did I.\n\n\"Describe, without unnecessary infusion of humor--for the subject was not\nhumorous to our ancestors--the condition of things to which you refer.\nDid our great-grandfathers recognize in this excess of goods over buyers\na cause of economic disturbance?\"\n\n\"They recognized it as the great and constant cause of such disturbance.\nThe perpetual burden of their complaints was dull times, stagnant trade,\nglut of products. Occasionally they had brief periods of what they called\ngood times, resulting from a little brisker buying, but in the best of\nwhat they called good times the condition of the mass of the people was\nwhat we should call abjectly wretched.\"\n\n\"What was the term by which they most commonly described the presence in\nthe market of more products than could be sold?\"\n\n\"Overproduction.\"\n\n\"Was it meant by this expression that there had been actually more food,\nclothing, and other good things produced than the people could use?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The mass of the people were in great need always, and in\nmore bitter need than ever precisely at the times when the business\nmachine was clogged by what they called overproduction. The people, if\nthey could have obtained access to the overproduced goods, would at any\ntime have consumed them in a moment and loudly called for more. The\ntrouble was, as has been said, that the profits charged by the capitalist\nmanufacturers and traders had put them out of the power of the original\nproducers to buy back with the price they had received for their labor or\nproducts.\"\n\n\"To what have our historians been wont to compare the condition of the\ncommunity under the profit system?\"\n\n\"To that of a victim of the disease of chronic dyspepsia so prevalent\namong our ancestors.\"\n\n\"Please develop the parallel.\"\n\n\"In dyspepsia the patient suffered from inability to assimilate food.\nWith abundance of dainties at hand he wasted away from the lack of power\nto absorb nutriment. Although unable to eat enough to support life, he\nwas constantly suffering the pangs of indigestion, and while actually\nstarving for want of nourishment, was tormented by the sensation of an\noverloaded stomach. Now, the economic condition of a community under the\nprofit system afforded a striking analogy to the plight of such a\ndyspeptic. The masses of the people were always in bitter need of all\nthings, and were abundantly able by their industry to provide for all\ntheir needs, but the profit system would not permit them to consume even\nwhat they produced, much less produce what they could. No sooner did they\ntake the first edge off of their appetite than the commercial system was\nseized with the pangs of acute indigestion and all the symptoms of an\noverloaded system, which nothing but a course of starvation would\nrelieve, after which the experience would be repeated with the same\nresult, and so on indefinitely.\"\n\n\"Can you explain why such an extraordinary misnomer as overproduction,\nshould be applied to a situation that would better be described as\nfamine; why a condition should be said to result from glut when it was\nobviously the consequence of enforced abstinence? Surely, the mistake was\nequivalent to diagnosing a case of starvation as one of gluttony.\"\n\n\"It was because the economists and the learned classes, who alone had a\nvoice, regarded the economic question entirely from the side of the\ncapitalists and ignored the interest of the people. From the point of\nview of the capitalist it was a case of overproduction when he had\ncharged profits on products which took them beyond the power of the\npeople to buy, and so the economist writing in his interest called it.\nFrom the point of view of the capitalist, and consequently of the\neconomist, the only question was the condition of the market, not of the\npeople. They did not concern themselves whether the people were famished\nor glutted; the only question was the condition of the market. Their\nmaxim that demand governed supply, and supply would always meet demand,\nreferred in no way to the demand representing human need, but wholly to\nan artificial thing called the market, itself the product of the profit\nsystem.\"\n\n\"What was the market?\"\n\n\"The market was the number of those who had money to buy with. Those who\nhad no money were non-existent so far as the market was concerned, and in\nproportion as people had little money they were a small part of the\nmarket. The needs of the market were the needs of those who had the money\nto supply their needs with. The rest, who had needs in plenty but no\nmoney, were not counted, though they were as a hundred to one of the\nmoneyed. The market was supplied when those who could buy had enough,\nthough the most of the people had little and many had nothing. The market\nwas glutted when the well-to-do were satisfied, though starving and naked\nmobs might riot in the streets.\"\n\n\"Would such a thing be possible nowadays as full storehouses and a hungry\nand naked people existing at the same time?\"\n\n\"Of course not. Until every one was satisfied there could be no such\nthing as overproduct now. Our system is so arranged that there can be too\nlittle nowhere so long as there is too much anywhere. But the old system\nhad no circulation of the blood.\"\n\n\"What name did our ancestors give to the various economic disturbances\nwhich they ascribed to overproduction?\"\n\n\"They called them commercial crises. That is to say, there was a chronic\nstate of glut which might be called a chronic crisis, but every now and\nthen the arrears resulting from the constant discrepancy between\nconsumption and production accumulated to such a degree as to nearly\nblock business. When this happened they called it, in distinction from\nthe chronic glut, a crisis or panic, on account of the blind terror which\nit caused.\"\n\n\"To what cause did they ascribe the crises?\"\n\n\"To almost everything besides the perfectly plain reason. An extensive\nliterature seems to have been devoted to the subject. There are shelves\nof it up at the museum which I have been trying to go through, or at\nleast to skim over, in connection with this study. If the books were not\nso dull in style they would be very amusing, just on account of the\nextraordinary ingenuity the writers display in avoiding the natural and\nobvious explanation of the facts they discuss. They even go into\nastronomy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I suppose the class will think I am romancing, but it is a fact that one\nof the most famous of the theories by which our ancestors accounted for\nthe periodical breakdowns of business resulting from the profit system\nwas the so-called 'sun-spot theory.' During the first half of the\nnineteenth century it so happened that there were severe crises at\nperiods about ten or eleven years apart. Now, it happened that sun spots\nwere at a maximum about every ten years, and a certain eminent English\neconomist concluded that these sun spots caused the panics. Later on it\nseems this theory was found unsatisfactory, and gave place to the\nlack-of-confidence explanation.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\n\"I could not exactly make out, but it seemed reasonable to suppose that\nthere must have developed a considerable lack of confidence in an\neconomic system which turned out such results.\"\n\n\"Marion, I fear you do not bring a spirit of sympathy to the study of the\nways of our forefathers, and without sympathy we can not understand\nothers.\"\n\n\"I am afraid they are a little too other, for me to understand.\"\n\nThe class tittered, and Marion was allowed to take her seat.\n\nJOHN TELLS ABOUT COMPETITION.\n\n\"Now, John,\" said the teacher, \"we will ask you a few questions. We have\nseen by what process a chronic glut of goods in the market resulted from\nthe operation of the profit system to put products out of reach of the\npurchasing power of the people at large. Now, what notable characteristic\nand main feature of the business system of our forefathers resulted from\nthe glut thus produced?\"\n\n\"I suppose you refer to competition?\" said the boy.\n\n\"Yes. What was competition and what caused it, referring especially to\nthe competition between capitalists?\"\n\n\"It resulted, as you intimate, from the insufficient consuming power of\nthe public at large, which in turn resulted from the profit system. If\nthe wage-earners and first-hand producers had received purchasing power\nsufficient to enable them to take up their numerical proportion of the\ntotal product offered in the market, it would have been cleared of goods\nwithout any effort on the part of sellers, for the buyers would have\nsought the sellers and been enough to buy all. But the purchasing power\nof the masses, owing to the profits charged on their products, being left\nwholly inadequate to take those products out of the market, there\nnaturally followed a great struggle between the capitalists engaged in\nproduction and distribution to divert the most possible of the all too\nscanty buying each in his own direction. The total buying could not of\ncourse be increased a dollar without relatively, or absolutely increasing\nthe purchasing power in the people's hands, but it was possible by effort\nto alter the particular directions in which it should be expended, and\nthis was the sole aim and effect of competition. Our forefathers thought\nit a wonderfully fine thing. They called it the life of trade, but, as we\nhave seen, it was merely a symptom of the effect of the profit system to\ncripple consumption.\"\n\n\"What were the methods which the capitalists engaged in production and\nexchange made use of to bring trade their way, as they used to say?\"\n\n\"First was direct solicitation of buyers and a shameless vaunting of\nevery one's wares by himself and his hired mouthpieces, coupled with a\nboundless depreciation of rival sellers and the wares they offered.\nUnscrupulous and unbounded misrepresentation was so universally the rule\nin business that even when here and there a dealer told the truth he\ncommanded no credence. History indicates that lying has always been more\nor less common, but it remained for the competitive system as fully\ndeveloped in the nineteenth century to make it the means of livelihood of\nthe whole world. According to our grandfathers--and they certainly ought\nto have known--the only lubricant which was adapted to the machinery of\nthe profit system was falsehood, and the demand for it was unlimited.\"\n\n\"And all this ocean of lying, you say, did not and could not increase the\ntotal of goods consumed by a dollar's worth.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Nothing, as I said, could increase that save an increase\nin the purchasing power of the people. The system of solicitation or\nadvertising, as it was called, far from increasing the total sale, tended\npowerfully to decrease it.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because it was prodigiously expensive and the expense had to be added to\nthe price of the goods and paid by the consumer, who therefore could buy\njust so much less than if he had been left in peace and the price of the\ngoods had been reduced by the saving in advertising.\"\n\n\"You say that the only way by which consumption could have been increased\nwas by increasing the purchasing power in the hands of the people\nrelatively to the goods to be bought. Now, our forefathers claimed that\nthis was just what competition did. They claimed that it was a potent\nmeans of reducing prices and cutting down the rate of profits, thereby\nrelatively increasing the purchasing power of the masses. Was this claim\nwell based?\"\n\n\"The rivalry of the capitalists among themselves,\" replied the lad, \"to\ntempt the buyers' custom certainly prompted them to undersell one another\nby nominal reductions of prices, but it was rarely that these nominal\nreductions, though often in appearance very large, really represented in\nthe long run any economic benefit to the people at large, for they were\ngenerally effected by means which nullified their practical value.\"\n\n\"Please make that clear.\"\n\n\"Well, naturally, the capitalist would prefer to reduce the prices of his\ngoods in such a way, if possible, as not to reduce his profits, and that\nwould be his study. There were numerous devices which he employed to this\nend. The first was that of reducing the quality and real worth of the\ngoods on which the price was nominally cut down. This was done by\nadulteration and scamped work, and the practice extended in the\nnineteenth century to every branch of industry and commerce and affected\npretty nearly all articles of human consumption. It came to that point,\nas the histories tell us, that no one could ever depend on anything he\npurchased being what it appeared or was represented. The whole atmosphere\nof trade was mephitic with chicane. It became the policy of the\ncapitalists engaged in the most important lines of manufacture to turn\nout goods expressly made with a view to wearing as short a time as\npossible, so as to need the speedier renewal. They taught their very\nmachines to be dishonest, and corrupted steel and brass. Even the\npurblind people of that day recognized the vanity of the pretended\nreductions in price by the epithet 'cheap and nasty,' with which they\ncharacterized cheapened goods. All this class of reductions, it is plain,\ncost the consumer two dollars for every one it professed to save him. As\na single illustration of the utterly deceptive character of reductions in\nprice under the profit system, it may be recalled that toward the close\nof the nineteenth century in America, after almost magical inventions for\nreducing the cost of shoemaking, it was a common saying that although the\nprice of shoes was considerably lower than fifty years before, when they\nwere made by hand, yet that later-made shoes were so much poorer in\nquality as to be really quite as expensive as the earlier.\"\n\n\"Were adulteration and scamped work the only devices by which sham\nreductions of prices was effected?\"\n\n\"There were two other ways. The first was where the capitalist saved his\nprofits while reducing the price of goods by taking the reduction out of\nthe wages he had paid his employees. This was the method by which the\nreductions in price were very generally brought about. Of course, the\nprocess was one which crippled the purchasing power of the community by\nthe amount of the lowered wages. By this means the particular group of\ncapitalists cutting down wages might quicken their sales for a time until\nother capitalists likewise cut wages. In the end nobody was helped, not\neven the capitalist. Then there was the third of the three main kinds of\nreductions in price to be credited to competition--namely, that made on\naccount of labor-saving machinery or other inventions which enabled the\ncapitalist to discharge his laborers. The reduction in price on the goods\nwas here based, as in the former case, on the reduced amount of wages\npaid out, and consequently meant a reduced purchasing power on the part\nof the community, which, in the total effect, usually nullified the\nadvantage of reduced price, and often more than nullified it.\"\n\n\"You have shown,\" said the teacher, \"that most of the reductions of price\neffected by competition were reductions at the expense of the original\nproducers or of the final consumers, and not reductions in profits. Do\nyou mean to say that the competition of capitalists for trade never\noperated to reduce profits?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly it did so operate in countries where from the long operation\nof the profit system surplus capital had accumulated so as to compete\nunder great pressure for investment; but under such circumstances\nreductions in prices, even though they might come from sacrifices of\nprofits, usually came too late to increase the consumption of the\npeople.\"\n\n\"How too late?\"\n\n\"Because the capitalist had naturally refrained from sacrificing his\nprofits in order to reduce prices so long as he could take the cost of\nthe reduction out of the wages of his workmen or out of the first-hand\nproducer. That is to say, it was only when the working masses had been\nreduced to pretty near the minimum subsistence point that the capitalist\nwould decide to sacrifice a portion of his profits. By that time it was\ntoo late for the people to take advantage of the reduction. When a\npopulation had reached that point, it had no buying power left to be\nstimulated. Nothing short of giving commodities away freely could help\nit. Accordingly, we observe that in the nineteenth century it was always\nin the countries where the populations were most hopelessly poor that the\nprices were lowest. It was in this sense a bad sign for the economic\ncondition of a community when the capitalist found it necessary to make a\nreal sacrifice of profits, for it was a clear indication that the working\nmasses had been squeezed until they could be squeezed no longer.\"\n\n\"Then, on the whole, competition was not a palliative of the profit\nsystem?\"\n\n\"I think that it has been made apparent that it was a grievous\naggravation of it. The desperate rivalry of the capitalists for a share\nin the scanty market which their own profit taking had beggared drove\nthem to the practice of deception and brutality, and compelled a\nhard-heartedness such as we are bound to believe human beings would not\nunder a less pressure have been guilty of.\"\n\n\"What was the general economic effect of competition?\"\n\n\"It operated in all fields of industry, and in the long run for all\nclasses, the capitalists as well as the non-capitalists, as a steady\ndownward pull as irresistible and universal as gravitation. Those felt it\nfirst who had least capital, the wage-earners who had none, and the\nfarmer proprietors who, having next to none, were under almost the same\npressure to find a prompt market at any sacrifice of their product, as\nwere the wage-earners to find prompt buyers for their labor. These\nclasses were the first victims of the competition to sell in the glutted\nmarkets of things and of men. Next came the turn of the smaller\ncapitalists, till finally only the largest were left, and these found it\nnecessary for self-preservation to protect themselves against the process\nof competitive decimation by the consolidation of their interests. One of\nthe signs of the times in the period preceding the Revolution was this\ntendency among the great capitalists to seek refuge from the destructive\nefforts of competition through the pooling of their undertakings in great\ntrusts and syndicates.\"\n\n\"Suppose the Revolution had not come to interrupt that process, would a\nsystem under which capital and the control of all business had been\nconsolidated in a few hands have been worse for the public interest than\nthe effect of competition?\"\n\n\"Such a consolidated system would, of course, have been an intolerable\ndespotism, the yoke of which, once assumed, the race might never have\nbeen able to break. In that respect private capitalism under a\nconsolidated plutocracy, such as impended at the time of the Revolution,\nwould have been a worse threat to the world's future than the competitive\nsystem; but as to the immediate bearings of the two systems on human\nwelfare, private capital in the consolidated form might have had some\npoints of advantage. Being an autocracy, it would have at least given\nsome chance to a benevolent despot to be better than the system and to\nameliorate a little the conditions of the people, and that was something\ncompetition did not allow the capitalists to do.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that under competition there was no free play whatever allowed\nfor the capitalist's better feelings even if he had any. He could not be\nbetter than the system. If he tried to be, the system would crush him. He\nhad to follow the pace set by his competitors or fail in business.\nWhatever rascality or cruelty his rivals might devise, he must imitate or\ndrop out of the struggle. The very wickedest, meanest, and most rascally\nof the competitors, the one who ground his employees lowest, adulterated\nhis goods most shamefully, and lied about them most skillfully, set the\npace for all the rest.\"\n\n\"Evidently, John, if you had lived in the early part of the revolutionary\nagitation you would have had scant sympathy with those early reformers\nwhose fear was lest the great monopolies would put an end to\ncompetition.\"\n\n\"I can't say whether I should have been wiser than my contemporaries in\nthat case,\" replied the lad, \"but I think my gratitude to the monopolists\nfor destroying competition would have been only equaled by my eagerness\nto destroy the monopolists to make way for public capitalism.\"\n\nROBERT TELLS ABOUT THE GLUT OF MEN.\n\n\"Now, Robert,\" said the teacher, \"John has told us how the glut of\nproducts resulting from the profit system caused a competition among\ncapitalists to sell goods and what its consequences were. There was,\nhowever, another sort of glut besides that of goods which resulted from\nthe profit system. What was that?\"\n\n\"A glut of men,\" replied the boy Robert. \"Lack of buying power on the\npart of the people, whether from lack of employment or lowered wages,\nmeant less demand for products, and that meant less work for producers.\nClogged storehouses meant closed factories and idle populations of\nworkers who could get no work--that is to say, the glut in the goods\nmarket caused a corresponding glut in the labor or man market. And as the\nglut in the goods market stimulated competition among the capitalists to\nsell their goods, so likewise did the glut in the labor market stimulate\nan equally desperate competition among the workers to sell their labor.\nThe capitalists who could not find buyers for their goods lost their\nmoney indeed, but those who had nothing to sell but their strength and\nskill, and could find none to buy, must perish. The capitalist, unless\nhis goods were perishable, could wait for a market, but the workingman\nmust find a buyer for his labor at once or die. And in respect to this\ninability to wait for a market, the farmer, while technically a\ncapitalist, was little better off than the wage-earner, being, on account\nof the smallness of his capital, almost as unable to withhold his product\nas the workingman his labor. The pressing necessity of the wage-earner to\nsell his labor at once on any terms and of the small capitalist to\ndispose of his product was the means by which the great capitalists were\nable steadily to force down the rate of wages and the prices paid for\ntheir product to the first producers.\"\n\n\"And was it only among the wage-earners and the small producers that this\nglut of men existed?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, every trade, every occupation, every art, and every\nprofession, including the most learned ones, was similarly overcrowded,\nand those in the ranks of each regarded every fresh recruit with jealous\neyes, seeing in him one more rival in the struggle for life, making it\njust so much more difficult than it had been before. It would seem that\nin those days no man could have had any satisfaction in his labor,\nhowever self-denying and arduous, for he must always have been haunted by\nthe feeling that it would have been kinder to have stood aside and let\nanother do the work and take the pay, seeing that there was not work and\npay for all.\"\n\n\"Tell us, Robert, did not our ancestors recognize the facts of the\nsituation you have described? Did they not see that this glut of men\nindicated something out of order in the social arrangements?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They professed to be much distressed over it. A large\nliterature was devoted to discussing why there was not enough work to go\naround in a world in which so much more work evidently needed to be done\nas indicated by its general poverty. The Congresses and Legislatures were\nconstantly appointing commissions of learned men to investigate and\nreport on the subject.\"\n\n\"And did these learned men ascribe it to its obvious cause as the\nnecessary effect of the profit system to maintain and constantly increase\na gap between the consuming and producing power of the community?\"\n\n\"Dear me, no! To have criticised the profit system would have been flat\nblasphemy. The learned men called it a problem--the problem of the\nunemployed--and gave it up as a conundrum. It was a favorite way our\nancestors had of dodging questions which they could not answer without\nattacking vested interests to call them problems and give them up as\ninsolvable mysteries of Divine Providence.\"\n\n\"There was one philosopher, Robert--an Englishman--who went to the bottom\nof this difficulty of the glut of men resulting from the profit system.\nHe stated the only way possible to avoid the glut, provided the profit\nsystem was retained. Do you remember his name?\"\n\n\"You mean Malthus, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes. What was his plan?\"\n\n\"He advised poor people, as the only way to avoid starvation, not to get\nborn--that is, I mean he advised poor people not to have children. This\nold fellow, as you say, was the only one of the lot who went to the root\nof the profit system, and saw that there was not room for it and for\nmankind on the earth. Regarding the profit system as a God-ordained\nnecessity, there could be no doubt in his mind that it was mankind which\nmust, under the circumstances, get off the earth. People called Malthus a\ncold-blooded philosopher. Perhaps he was, but certainly it was only\ncommon humanity that, so long as the profit system lasted, a red flag\nshould be hung out on the planet, warning souls not to land except at\ntheir own risk.\"\n\nEMILY SHOWS THE NECESSITY OF WASTE PIPES.\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Robert,\" said the teacher, \"and now, Emily, we\nwill ask you to take us in charge as we pursue a little further this\ninteresting, if not very edifying theme. The economic system of\nproduction and distribution by which a nation lives may fitly be compared\nto a cistern with a supply pipe, representing production, by which water\nis pumped in; and an escape pipe, representing consumption, by which the\nproduct is disposed of. When the cistern is scientifically constructed\nthe supply pipe and escape pipe correspond in capacity, so that the water\nmay be drawn off as fast as supplied, and none be wasted by overflow.\nUnder the profit system of our ancestors, however, the arrangement was\ndifferent. Instead of corresponding in capacity with the supply pipe\nrepresenting production, the outlet representing consumption was half or\ntwo thirds shut off by the water-gate of profits, so that it was not able\nto carry off more than, say, a half or a third of the supply that was\npumped into the cistern through the feed pipe of production. Now, Emily,\nwhat would be the natural effect of such a lack of correspondence between\nthe inlet and the outlet capacity of the cistern?\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" replied the girl who answered to the name of Emily, \"the\neffect would be to clog the cistern, and compel the pumps to slow down to\nhalf or one third of their capacity--namely, to the capacity of the\nescape pipe.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the teacher, \"suppose that in the case of the cistern used by\nour ancestors the effect of slowing down the pump of production was to\ndiminish still further the capacity of the escape pipe of consumption,\nalready much too small, by depriving the working masses of even the small\npurchasing power they had before possessed in the form of wages for labor\nor prices for produce.\"\n\n\"Why, in that case,\" replied the girl, \"it is evident that since slowing\ndown production only checked instead of hastening relief by consumption,\nthere would be no way to avoid a stoppage of the whole service except to\nrelieve the pressure in the cistern by opening waste pipes.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. Well, now, we are in a position to appreciate how\nnecessary a part the waste pipes played in the economic system of our\nforefathers. We have seen that under that system the bulk of the people\nsold their labor or produce to the capitalists, but were unable to buy\nback and consume but a small part of the result of that labor or produce\nin the market, the rest remaining in the hands of the capitalists as\nprofits. Now, the capitalists, being a very small body numerically, could\nconsume upon their necessities but a petty part of these accumulated\nprofits, and yet, if they did not get rid of them somehow, production\nwould stop, for the capitalists absolutely controlled the initiative in\nproduction, and would have no motive to increase accumulations they could\nnot dispose of. In proportion, moreover, as the capitalists from lack of\nuse for more profits should slacken production, the mass of the people,\nfinding none to hire them, or buy their produce to sell again, would lose\nwhat little consuming power they had before, and a still larger\naccumulation of products be left on the capitalists' hands. The question\nthen is, How did the capitalists, after consuming all they could of their\nprofits upon their own necessities, dispose of the surplus, so as to make\nroom for more production?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the girl Emily, \"if the surplus products were to be so\nexpended as to relieve the glut, the first point was that they must be\nexpended in such ways that there should be no return, for them. They must\nbe absolutely wasted--like water poured into the sea. This was\naccomplished by the use of the surplus products in the support of bodies\nof workers employed in unproductive kinds of labor. This waste labor was\nof two sorts--the first was that employed in wasteful industrial and\ncommercial competition; the second was that employed in the means and\nservices of luxury.\"\n\n\"Tell us about the wasteful expenditure of labor in competition.\"\n\n\"That was through the undertaking of industrial and commercial\nenterprises which were not called for by any increase in consumption,\ntheir object being merely the displacement of the enterprises of one\ncapitalist by those of another.\"\n\n\"And was this a very large cause of waste?\"\n\n\"Its magnitude may be inferred from the saying current at the time that\nninety-five per cent of industrial and commercial enterprises failed,\nwhich merely meant that in this proportion of instances capitalists\nwasted their investments in trying to fill a demand which either did not\nexist or was supplied already. If that estimate were even a remote\nsuggestion of the truth, it would serve to give an idea of the enormous\namounts of accumulated profits which were absolutely wasted in\ncompetitive expenditure. And it must be remembered also that when a\ncapitalist succeeded in displacing another and getting away his business\nthe total waste of capital was just as great as if he failed, only in the\none case it was the capital of the previous investor that was destroyed\ninstead of the capital of the newcomer. In every country which had\nattained any degree of economic development there were many times more\nbusiness enterprises in every line than there was business for, and many\ntimes as much capital already invested as there was a return for. The\nonly way in which new capital could be put into business was by forcing\nout and destroying old capital already invested. The ever-mounting\naggregation of profits seeking part of a market that was prevented from\nincreasing by the effect of those very profits, created a pressure of\ncompetition among capitalists which, by all accounts that come down to\nus, must have been like a conflagration in its consuming effects upon\ncapital.\n\n\"Now tell us something about the other great waste of profits by which\nthe pressure in the cistern was sufficiently relieved to permit\nproduction to go on--that is to say, the expenditure of profits for the\nemployment of labor in the service of luxury. What was luxury?\"\n\n\"The term luxury, in referring to the state of society before the\nRevolution, meant the lavish expenditure of wealth by the rich to gratify\na refined sensualism, while the masses of the people were suffering lack\nof the primary necessities.\"\n\n\"What were some of the modes of luxurious expenditure indulged in by the\ncapitalists?\"\n\n\"They were unlimited in variety, as, for example, the construction of\ncostly palaces for residence and their decoration in royal style, the\nsupport of great retinues of servants, costly supplies for the table,\nrich equipages, pleasure ships, and all manner of boundless expenditure\nin fine raiment and precious stones. Ingenuity was exhausted in\ncontriving devices by which the rich might waste the abundance the people\nwere dying for. A vast army of laborers was constantly engaged in\nmanufacturing an infinite variety of articles and appliances of elegance\nand ostentation which mocked the unsatisfied primary necessities of those\nwho toiled to produce them.\"\n\n\"What have you to say of the moral aspect of this expenditure for\nluxury?\"\n\n\"If the entire community had arrived at that stage of economic prosperity\nwhich would enable all alike to enjoy the luxuries equally,\" replied the\ngirl, \"indulgence in them would have been merely a question of taste. But\nthis waste of wealth by the rich in the presence of a vast population\nsuffering lack of the bare necessaries of life was an illustration of\ninhumanity that would seem incredible on the part of civilized people\nwere not the facts so well substantiated. Imagine a company of persons\nsitting down with enjoyment to a banquet, while on the floors and all\nabout the corners of the banquet hall were groups of fellow-beings dying\nwith want and following with hungry eyes every morsel the feasters lifted\nto their mouths. And yet that precisely describes the way in which the\nrich used to spend their profits in the great cities of America, France,\nEngland, and Germany before the Revolution, the one difference being that\nthe needy and the hungry, instead of being in the banquet room itself,\nwere just outside on the street.\"\n\n\"It was claimed, was it not, by the apologists of the luxurious\nexpenditure of the capitalists that they thus gave employment to many who\nwould otherwise have lacked it?\"\n\n\"And why would they have lacked employment? Why were the people glad to\nfind employment in catering to the luxurious pleasures and indulgences of\nthe capitalists, selling themselves to the most frivolous and degrading\nuses? It was simply because the profit taking of these same capitalists,\nby reducing the consuming power of the people to a fraction of its\nproducing power, had correspondingly limited the field of productive\nemployment, in which under a rational system there must always have been\nwork for every hand until all needs were satisfied, even as there is now.\nIn excusing their luxurious expenditure on the ground you have mentioned,\nthe capitalists pleaded the results of one wrong to justify the\ncommission of another.\"\n\n\"The moralists of all ages,\" said the teacher, \"condemned the luxury of\nthe rich. Why did their censures effect no change?\"\n\n\"Because they did not understand the economics of the subject. They\nfailed to see that under the profit system the absolute waste of the\nexcess of profits in unproductive expenditure was an economic necessity,\nif production was to proceed, as you showed in comparing it with the\ncistern. The waste of profits in luxury was an economic necessity, to use\nanother figure, precisely as a running sore is a necessary vent in some\ncases for the impurities of a diseased body. Under our system of equal\nsharing, the wealth of a community is freely and equally distributed\namong its members as is the blood in a healthy body. But when, as under\nthe old system, that wealth was concentrated in the hands of a portion of\nthe community, it lost its vitalizing quality, as does the blood when\ncongested in particular organs, and like that becomes an active poison,\nto be got rid of at any cost. Luxury in this way might be called an\nulcer, which must be kept open if the profit system was to continue on\nany terms.\"\n\n\"You say,\" said the teacher, \"that in order that production should go on\nit was absolutely necessary to get the excess of profits wasted in some\nsort of unproductive expenditure. But might not the profit takers have\ndevised some way of getting rid of the surplus more intelligent than mere\ncompetition to displace one another, and more consistent with humane\nfeeling than wasting wealth upon refinements of sensual indulgence in the\npresence of a needy multitude?\"\n\n\"Certainly. If the capitalists had cared at all about the humane aspect\nof the matter, they could have taken a much less demoralizing method in\ngetting rid of the obstructive surplus. They could have periodically made\na bonfire of it as a burnt sacrifice to the god Profit, or, if they\npreferred, it might have been carried out in scows beyond soundings and\ndumped there.\"\n\n\"It is easy to see,\" said the teacher, \"that from a moral point of view\nsuch a periodical bonfire or dump would have been vastly more edifying to\ngods and men than was the actual practice of expending it in luxuries\nwhich mocked the bitter want of the mass. But how about the economic\noperation of this plan?\"\n\n\"It would have been as advantageous economically as morally. The process\nof wasting the surplus profits in competition and luxury was slow and\nprotracted, and meanwhile productive industry languished and the workers\nwaited in idleness and want for the surplus to be so far reduced as to\nmake room for more production. But if the surplus at once, on being\nascertained, were destroyed, productive industry would go right on.\"\n\n\"But how about the workmen employed by the capitalists in ministering to\ntheir luxuries? Would they not have been thrown out of work if luxury had\nbeen given up?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, under the bonfire system there would have been a\nconstant demand for them in productive employment to provide material for\nthe blaze, and that surely would have been a far more worthy occupation\nthan helping the capitalists to consume in folly the product of their\nbrethren employed in productive industry. But the greatest advantage of\nall which would have resulted from the substitution of the bonfire for\nluxury remains to be mentioned. By the time the nation had made a few\nsuch annual burnt offerings to the principle of profit, perhaps even\nafter the first one, it is likely they would begin to question, in the\nlight of such vivid object lessons, whether the moral beauties of the\nprofit system were sufficient compensation for so large an economic\nsacrifice.\"\n\nCHARLES REMOVES AN APPREHENSION.\n\n\"Now, Charles,\" said the teacher, \"you shall help us a little on a point\nof conscience. We have, one and another, told a very bad story about the\nprofit system, both in its moral and its economic aspects. Now, is it not\npossible that we have done it injustice? Have we not painted too black a\npicture? From an ethical point of view we could indeed scarcely have done\nso, for there are no words strong enough to justly characterize the mock\nit made of all the humanities. But have we not possibly asserted too\nstrongly its economic imbecility and the hopelessness of the world's\noutlook for material welfare so long as it should be tolerated? Can you\nreassure us on this point?\"\n\n\"Easily,\" replied the lad Charles. \"No more conclusive testimony to the\nhopelessness of the economic outlook under private capitalism could be\ndesired than is abundantly given by the nineteenth-century economists\nthemselves. While they seemed quite incapable of imagining anything\ndifferent from private capitalism as the basis of an economic system,\nthey cherished no illusions as to its operation. Far from trying to\ncomfort mankind by promising that if present ills were bravely borne\nmatters would grow better, they expressly taught that the profit system\nmust inevitably result at some time not far ahead in the arrest of\nindustrial progress and a stationary condition of production.\"\n\n\"How did they make that out?\"\n\n\"They recognized, as we do, the tendency under private capitalism of\nrents, interest, and profits to accumulate as capital in the hands of the\ncapitalist class, while, on the other hand, the consuming power of the\nmasses did not increase, but either decreased or remained practically\nstationary. From this lack of equilibrium between production and\nconsumption it followed that the difficulty of profitably employing\ncapital in productive industry must increase as the accumulations of\ncapital so disposable should grow. The home market having been first,\nglutted with products and afterward the foreign market, the competition\nof the capitalists to find productive employment for their capital would\nlead them, after having reduced wages to the lowest possible point, to\nbid for what was left of the market by reducing their own profits to the\nminimum point at which it was worth while to risk capital. Below this\npoint more capital would not be invested in business. Thus the rate of\nwealth production would cease to advance, and become stationary.\"\n\n\"This, you say, is what the nineteenth-century economists themselves\ntaught concerning the outcome of the profit system?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could, quote from their standard books any number of\npassages foretelling this condition of things, which, indeed, it required\nno prophet to foretell.\"\n\n\"How near was the world--that is, of course, the nations whose industrial\nevolution had gone farthest--to this condition when the Revolution came?\"\n\n\"They were apparently on its verge. The more economically advanced\ncountries had generally exhausted their home markets and were struggling\ndesperately for what was left of foreign markets. The rate of interest,\nwhich indicated the degree to which capital had become glutted, had\nfallen in England to two per cent and in America within thirty years had\nsunk from seven and six to five and three and four per cent, and was\nfalling year by year. Productive industry had become generally clogged,\nand proceeded by fits and starts. In America the wage-earners were\nbecoming proletarians, and the farmers fast sinking into the state of a\ntenantry. It was indeed the popular discontent caused by these\nconditions, coupled with apprehension of worse to come, which finally\nroused the people at the close of the nineteenth century to the necessity\nof destroying private capitalism for good and all.\"\n\n\"And do I understand, then, that this stationary condition, after which\nno increase in the rate of wealth production could be looked for, was\nsetting in while yet the primary needs of the masses remained unprovided\nfor?\"\n\n\"Certainly. The satisfaction of the needs of the masses, as we have\nabundantly seen, was in no way recognized as a motive for production\nunder the profit system. As production approached the stationary point\nthe misery of the people would, in fact, increase as a direct result of\nthe competition among capitalists to invest their glut of capital in\nbusiness. In order to do so, as has already been shown, they sought to\nreduce the prices of products, and that meant the reduction of wages to\nwage-earners and prices to first producers to the lowest possible point\nbefore any reduction in the profits of the capitalist was considered.\nWhat the old economists called the stationary condition of production\nmeant, therefore, the perpetuation indefinitely of the maximum degree of\nhardship endurable by the people at large.\"\n\n\"That will do, Charles; you have said enough to relieve any apprehension\nthat possibly we were doing injustice to the profit system. Evidently\nthat could not be done to a system of which its own champions foretold\nsuch an outcome as you have described. What, indeed, could be added to\nthe description they give of it in these predictions of the stationary\ncondition as a programme of industry confessing itself at the end of its\nresources in the midst of a naked and starving race? This was the good\ntime coming, with the hope of which the nineteenth-century economists\ncheered the cold and hungry world of toilers--a time when, being worse\noff than ever, they must abandon forever even the hope of improvement. No\nwonder our forefathers described their so-called political economy as a\ndismal science, for never was there a pessimism blacker, a hopelessness\nmore hopeless than it preached. Ill indeed had it been for humanity if it\nhad been truly a science.\n\nESTHER COUNTS THE COST OF THE PROFIT SYSTEM.\n\n\"Now, Esther,\" the teacher pursued, \"I am going to ask you to do a little\nestimating as to about how much the privilege of retaining the profit\nsystem cost our forefathers. Emily has given us an idea of the magnitude\nof the two great wastes of profits--the waste of competition and the\nwaste of luxury. Now, did the capital wasted in these two ways represent\nall that the profit system cost the people?\"\n\n\"It did not give a faint idea of it, much less represent it,\" replied the\ngirl Esther. \"The aggregate wealth wasted respectively in competition and\nluxury, could it have been distributed equally for consumption among the\npeople, would undoubtedly have considerably raised the general level of\ncomfort. In the cost of the profit system to a community, the wealth\nwasted by the capitalists was, however, an insignificant item. The bulk\nof that cost consisted in the effect of the profit system to prevent\nwealth from being produced, in holding back and tying down the almost\nboundless wealth-producing power of man. Imagine the mass of the\npopulation, instead of being sunk in poverty and a large part of them in\nbitter want, to have received sufficient to satisfy all their needs and\ngive them ample, comfortable lives, and estimate the amount of additional\nwealth which it would have been necessary to produce to meet this\nstandard of consumption. That will give you a basis for calculating the\namount of wealth which the American people or any people of those days\nmight and would have produced but for the profit system. You may estimate\nthat this would have meant a fivefold, sevenfold, or tenfold increase of\nproduction, as you please to guess.\n\n\"But tell us this: Would it have been possible for the people of America,\nsay, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, to have multiplied\ntheir production at such a rate if consumption had demanded it?\"\n\n\"Nothing is more certain than that they could easily have done so. The\nprogress of invention had been so great in the nineteenth century as to\nmultiply from twentyfold to many hundredfold the productive power of\nindustry. There was no time during the last quarter of the century in\nAmerica or in any of the advanced countries when the existing productive\nplants could not have produced enough in six months to have supplied the\ntotal annual consumption as it actually was. And those plants could have\nbeen multiplied indefinitely. In like manner the agricultural product of\nthe country was always kept far within its possibility, for a plentiful\ncrop under the profit system meant ruinous prices to the farmers. As has\nbeen said, it was an admitted proposition of the old economists that\nthere was no visible limit to production if only sufficient demand for\nconsumption could be secured.\"\n\n\"Can you recall any instance in history in which it can be argued that a\npeople paid so large a price in delayed and prevented development for the\nprivilege of retaining any other tyranny as they did for keeping the\nprofit system?\"\n\n\"I am sure there never was such another instance, and I will tell you why\nI think so. Human progress has been delayed at various stages by\noppressive institutions, and the world has leaped forward at their\noverthrow. But there was never before a time when the conditions had been\nso long ready and waiting for so great and so instantaneous a forward\nmovement all along the line of social improvement as in the period\npreceding the Revolution. The mechanical and industrial forces, held in\ncheck by the profit system, only required to be unleashed to transform\nthe economic condition of the race as by magic. So much for the material\ncost of the profit system to our forefathers; but, vast as that was, it\nis not worth considering for a moment in comparison with its cost in\nhuman happiness. I mean the moral cost in wrong and tears and black\nnegations and stifled moral possibilities which the world paid for every\nday's retention of private capitalism: there are no words adequate to\nexpress the sum of that.\"\n\nNO POLITICAL ECONOMY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.\n\n\"That will do, Esther.--Now, George, I want you to tell us just a little\nabout a particular body among the learned class of the nineteenth\ncentury, which, according to the professions of its members, ought to\nhave known and to have taught the people all that we have so easily\nperceived as to the suicidal character of the profit system and the\neconomic perdition it meant for mankind so long as it should be\ntolerated. I refer to the political economists.\"\n\n\"There were no political economists before the Revolution,\" replied the\nlad.\n\n\"But there certainly was a large class of learned men who called\nthemselves political economists.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but they labeled themselves wrongly.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\"\n\n\"Because there was not, until the Revolution--except, of course, among\nthose who sought to bring it to pass--any conception whatever of what\npolitical economy is.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Economy,\" replied the lad, \"means the wise husbandry of wealth in\nproduction and distribution. Individual economy is the science of this\nhusbandry when conducted in the interest of the individual without regard\nto any others. Family economy is this husbandry carried on for the\nadvantage of a family group without regard to other groups. Political\neconomy, however, can only mean the husbandry of wealth for the greatest\nadvantage of the political or social body, the whole number of the\ncitizens constituting the political organization. This sort of husbandry\nnecessarily implies a public or political regulation of economic affairs\nfor the general interest. But before the Revolution there was no\nconception of such an economy, nor any organization to carry it out. All\nsystems and doctrines of economy previous to that time were distinctly\nand exclusively private and individual in their whole theory and\npractice. While in other respects our forefathers did in various ways and\ndegrees recognize a social solidarity and a political unity with\nproportionate rights and duties, their theory and practice as to all\nmatters touching the getting and sharing of wealth were aggressively and\nbrutally individualistic, antisocial, and unpolitical.\"\n\n\"Have you ever looked over any of the treatises which our forefathers\ncalled political economies, at the Historical Library?\"\n\n\"I confess,\" the boy answered, \"that the title of the leading work under\nthat head was enough for me. It was called The Wealth of Nations. That\nwould be an admirable title for a political economy nowadays, when the\nproduction and distribution of wealth are conducted altogether by and for\nthe people collectively; but what meaning could it conceivably have had\nas applied to a book written nearly a hundred years before such a thing\nas a national economic organization was thought of, with the sole view of\ninstructing capitalists how to get rich at the cost of, or at least in\ntotal disregard of, the welfare of their fellow-citizens? I noticed too\nthat quite a common subtitle used for these so-called works on political\neconomy was the phrase 'The Science of Wealth.' Now what could an\napologist of private capitalism and the profit system possibly have to\nsay about the science of wealth? The A B C of any science of wealth\nproduction is the necessity of co-ordination and concert of effort;\nwhereas competition, conflict, and endless cross-purposes were the sum\nand substance of the economic methods set forth by these writers.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said the teacher, \"the only real fault of these so-called\nbooks on Political Economy consists in the absurdity of the title.\nCorrect that, and their value as documents of the times at once becomes\nevident. For example, we might call them 'Examinations into the Economic\nand Social Consequences of trying to get along without any Political\nEconomy.' A title scarcely less fit would perhaps be 'Studies into the\nNatural Course of Economic Affairs when left to Anarchy by the Lack of\nany Regulation in the General Interest.' It is, when regarded in this\nlight, as painstaking and conclusive expositions of the ruinous effects\nof private capitalism upon the welfare of communities, that we perceive\nthe true use and value of these works. Taking up in detail the various\nphenomena of the industrial and commercial world of that day, with their\nreactions upon the social status, their authors show how the results\ncould not have been other than they were, owing to the laws of private\ncapitalism, and that it was nothing but weak sentimentalism to suppose\nthat while those laws continued in operation any different results could\nbe obtained, however good men's intentions. Although somewhat heavy in\nstyle for popular reading, I have often thought that during the\nrevolutionary period no documents could have been better calculated to\nconvince rational men who could be induced to read them, that it was\nabsolutely necessary to put an end to private capitalism if humanity were\never to get forward.\n\n\"The fatal and quite incomprehensible mistake of their authors was that\nthey did not themselves see this, conclusion and preach it. Instead of\nthat they committed the incredible blunder of accepting a set of\nconditions that were manifestly mere barbaric survivals as the basis of a\nsocial science when they ought easily to have seen that the very idea of\na scientific social order suggested the abolition of those conditions as\nthe first step toward its realization.\n\n\"Meanwhile, as to the present lesson, there are two or three points to\nclear up before leaving it. We have been talking altogether of profit\ntaking, but this was only one of the three main methods by which the\ncapitalists collected the tribute from the toiling world by which their\npower was acquired and maintained. What were the other two?\"\n\n\"Rent and interest.\"\n\n\"What was rent?\"\n\n\"In those days,\" replied George, \"the right to a reasonable and equal\nallotment of land for private uses did not belong as a matter of course\nto every person as it does now. No one was admitted to have any natural\nright to land at all. On the other hand, there was no limit to the extent\nof land, though it were a whole province, which any one might not legally\npossess if he could get hold of it. By natural consequence of this\narrangement the strong and cunning had acquired most of the land, while\nthe majority of the people were left with none at all. Now, the owner of\nthe land had the right to drive any one off his land and have him\npunished for entering on it. Nevertheless, the people who owned n\nrequired to have it and to use it and must needs go to the capitalists\nfor it. Rent was the price charged by capitalists for not driving people\noff their land.\"\n\n\"Did this rent represent any economic service of any sort rendered to the\ncommunity by the rent receiver?\"\n\n\"So far as regards the charge for the use of the land itself apart from\nimprovements it represented no service of any sort, nothing but the\nwaiver for a price of the owner's legal right of ejecting the occupant.\nIt was not a charge for doing anything, but for not doing something.\"\n\n\"Now tell us about interest; what was that?\"\n\n\"Interest was the price paid for the use of money. Nowadays the\ncollective administration directs the industrial forces of the nation for\nthe general welfare, but in those days all economic enterprises were for\nprivate profit, and their projectors had to hire the labor they needed\nwith money. Naturally, the loan of so indispensable a means as this\ncommanded a high price; that price was interest.\"\n\n\"And did interest represent any economic service to the community on the\npart of the interest taker in lending his money?\"\n\n\"None whatever. On the contrary, it was by the very nature of the\ntransaction, a waiver on the part of the lender of the power of action in\nfavor of the borrower. It was a price charged for letting some one else\ndo what the lender might have done but chose not to. It was a tribute\nlevied by inaction upon action.\"\n\n\"If all the landlords and money lenders had died over night, would it\nhave made any difference to the world?\"\n\n\"None whatever, so long as they left the land and the money behind. Their\neconomic role was a passive one, and in strong contrast with that of the\nprofit-seeking capitalists, which, for good or bad, was at least active.\"\n\n\"What was the general effect of rent and interest upon the consumption\nand consequently the production of wealth by the community?\"\n\n\"It operated to reduce both.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"In the same way that profit taking did. Those who received rent were\nvery few, those who paid it were nearly all. Those who received interest\nwere few, and those who paid it many. Rent and interest meant, therefore,\nlike profits, a constant drawing away of the purchasing power of the\ncommunity at large and its concentration in the hands of a small part of\nit.\"\n\n\"What have you to say of these three processes as to their comparative\neffect in destroying the consuming power of the masses, and consequently\nthe demand for production?\"\n\n\"That differed in different ages and countries according to the stage of\ntheir economic development. Private capitalism has been compared to a\nthree-horned bull, the horns being rent, profit, and interest, differing\nin comparative length and strength according to the age of the animal. In\nthe United States, at the time covered by our lesson, profits were still\nthe longest of the three horns, though the others were growing terribly\nfast.\"\n\n\"We have seen, George,\" said his teacher, \"that from a period long before\nthe great Revolution it was as true as it is now that the only limit to\nthe production of wealth in society was its consumption. We have seen\nthat what kept the world in poverty under private capitalism was the\neffect of profits, aided by rent and interest to reduce consumption and\nthus cripple production, by concentrating the purchasing power of the\npeople in the hands of a few. Now, that was the wrong way of doing\nthings. Before leaving the subject I want you to tell us in a word what\nis the right way. Seeing that production is limited by consumption, what\nrule must be followed in distributing the results of production to be\nconsumed in order to develop consumption to the highest possible point,\nand thereby in turn to create the greatest possible demand for\nproduction.\"\n\n\"For that purpose the results of production must be distributed equally\namong all the members of the producing community.\"\n\n\"Show why that is so.\"\n\n\"It is a self-evident mathematical proposition. The more people a loaf of\nbread or any given thing is divided among, and the more equally it is\ndivided, the sooner it will be consumed and more bread be called for. To\nput it in a more formal way, the needs of human beings result from the\nsame natural constitution and are substantially the same. An equal\ndistribution of the things needed by them is therefore that general plan\nby which the consumption of such things will be at once enlarged to the\ngreatest possible extent and continued on that scale without interruption\nto the point of complete satisfaction for all. It follows that the equal\ndistribution of products is the rule by which the largest possible\nconsumption can be secured, and thus in turn the largest production be\nstimulated.\"\n\n\"What, on the other hand, would be the effect on consumption of an\nunequal division of consumable products?\"\n\n\"If the division were unequal, the result would be that some would have\nmore than they could consume in a given time, and others would have less\nthan they could have consumed in the same time, the result meaning a\nreduction of total consumption below what it would have been for that\ntime with an equal division of products. If a million dollars were\nequally divided among one thousand men, it would presently be wholly\nexpended in the consumption of needed things, creating a demand for the\nproduction of as much more; but if concentrated in one man's hands, not a\nhundredth part of it, however great his luxury, would be likely to be so\nexpended in the same period. The fundamental general law in the science\nof social wealth is, therefore, that the efficiency of a given amount of\npurchasing power to promote consumption is in exact proportion to its\nwide distribution, and is most efficient when equally distributed among\nthe whole body of consumers because that is the widest possible\ndistribution.\"\n\n\"You have not called attention to the fact that the formula of the\ngreatest wealth production--namely, equal sharing of the product among\nthe community--is also that application of the product which will cause\nthe greatest sum of human happiness.\"\n\n\"I spoke strictly of the economic side of the subject.\"\n\n\"Would it not have startled the old economists to hear that the secret of\nthe most efficient system of wealth production was conformity on a\nnational scale to the ethical idea of equal treatment for all embodied by\nJesus Christ in the golden rule?\"\n\n\"No doubt, for they falsely taught that there were two kinds of science\ndealing with human conduct--one moral, the other economic; and two lines\nof reasoning as to conduct--the economic, and the ethical; both right in\ndifferent ways. We know better. There can be but one science of human\nconduct in whatever field, and that is ethical. Any economic proposition\nwhich can not be stated in ethical terms is false. Nothing can be in the\nlong run or on a large scale sound economics which is not sound ethics.\nIt is not, therefore, a mere coincidence, but a logical necessity, that\nthe supreme word of both ethics and economics should be one and the\nsame--equality. The golden rule in its social application is as truly the\nsecret of plenty as of peace.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\"THE PARABLE OF THE WATER TANK.\"\n\n\"That will do, George. We will close the session here. Our discussion, I\nfind, has taken a broader range than I expected, and to complete the\nsubject we shall need to have a brief session this afternoon.--And now,\nby way of concluding the morning, I propose to offer a little\ncontribution of my own. The other day, at the museum, I was delving among\nthe relics of literature of the great Revolution, with a view to finding\nsomething that might illustrate our theme. I came across a little\npamphlet of the period, yellow and almost undecipherable, which, on\nexamination, I found to be a rather amusing skit or satirical take-off on\nthe profit system. It struck me that probably our lesson might prepare us\nto appreciate it, and I made a copy. It is entitled \"The Parable of the\nWater Tank,\" and runs this way:\n\n\"'There was a certain very dry land, the people whereof were in sore need\nof water. And they did nothing but to seek after water from morning until\nnight, and many perished because they could not find it.\n\n\"'Howbeit, there were certain men in that land who were more crafty and\ndiligent than the rest, and these had gathered stores of water where\nothers could find none, and the name of these men was called capitalists.\nAnd it came to pass that the people of the land came unto the capitalists\nand prayed them that they would give them of the water they had gathered\nthat they might drink, for their need was sore. But the capitalists\nanswered them and said:\n\n\"'\"Go to, ye silly people! why should we give you of the water which we\nhave gathered, for then we should become even as ye are, and perish with\nyou? But behold what we will do unto you. Be ye our servants and ye shall\nhave water.\"\n\n\"'And the people said, \"Only give us to drink and we will be your\nservants, we and our children.\" And it was so.\n\n\"'Now, the capitalists were men of understanding, and wise in their\ngeneration. They ordered the people who were their servants in bands with\ncaptains and officers, and some they put at the springs to dip, and\nothers did they make to carry the water, and others did they cause to\nseek for new springs. And all the water was brought together in one\nplace, and there did the capitalists make a great tank for to hold it,\nand the tank was called the Market, for it was there that the people,\neven the servants of the capitalists, came to get water. And the\ncapitalists said unto the people:\n\n\"'\"For every bucket of water that ye bring to us, that we may pour it\ninto the tank, which is the Market, behold! we will give you a penny, but\nfor every bucket that we shall draw forth to give unto you that ye may\ndrink of it, ye and your wives and your children, ye shall give to us two\npennies, and the difference shall be our profit, seeing that if it were\nnot for this profit we would not do this thing for you, but ye should all\nperish.\"\n\n\"'And it was good in the people's eyes, for they were dull of\nunderstanding, and they diligently brought water unto the tank for many\ndays, and for every bucket which they did bring the capitalists gave them\nevery man a penny; but for every bucket that the capitalists drew forth\nfrom the tank to give again unto the people, behold! the people rendered\nto the capitalists two pennies.\n\n\"'And after many days the water tank, which was the Market, overflowed at\nthe top, seeing that for every bucket the people poured in they received\nonly so much as would buy again half of a bucket. And because of the\nexcess that was left of every bucket, did the tank overflow, for the\npeople were many, but the capitalists were few, and could drink no more\nthan others. Therefore did the tank overflow.\n\n\"'And when the capitalists saw that the water overflowed, they said to\nthe people:\n\n\"'\"See ye not the tank, which is the Market, doth overflow? Sit ye down,\ntherefore and be patient, for ye shall bring us no more water till the\ntank be empty.\"\n\n\"'But when the people no more received the pennies of the capitalists for\nthe water they brought, they could buy no more water from the\ncapitalists, having naught wherewith to buy. And when the capitalists saw\nthat they had no more profit because no man bought water of them, they\nwere troubled. And they sent forth men in the highways, the byways, and\nthe hedges, crying, \"If any thirst let him come to the tank and buy water\nof us, for it doth overflow.\" For they said among themselves, \"Behold,\nthe times are dull; we must advertise.\"\n\n\"'But the people answered, saying: \"How can we buy unless ye hire us, for\nhow else shall we have wherewithal to buy? Hire ye us, therefore, as\nbefore, and we will gladly buy water, for we thirst, and ye will have no\nneed to advertise.\" But the capitalists said to the people: \"Shall we\nhire you to bring water when the tank, which is the Market, doth already\noverflow? Buy ye, therefore, first water, and when the tank is empty,\nthrough your buying, will we hire you again.\" And so it was because the\ncapitalists hired them no more to bring water that the people could not\nbuy the water they had brought already, and because the people could not\nbuy the water they had brought already, the capitalists no more hired\nthem to bring water. And the saying went abroad, \"It is a crisis.\"\n\n\"'And the thirst of the people was great, for it was not now as it had\nbeen in the days of their fathers, when the land was open before them,\nfor every one to seek water for himself, seeing that the capitalists had\ntaken all the springs, and the wells, and the water wheels, and the\nvessels and the buckets, so that no man might come by water save from the\ntank, which was the Market. And the people murmured against the\ncapitalists and said: \"Behold, the tank runneth over, and we die of\nthirst. Give us, therefore, of the water, that we perish not.\"\n\n\"'But the capitalists answered: \"Not so. The water is ours. Ye shall not\ndrink thereof unless ye buy it of us with pennies.\" And they confirmed it\nwith an oath, saying, after their manner, \"Business is business.\"\n\n\"'But the capitalists were disquieted that the people bought no more\nwater, whereby they had no more any profits, and they spake one to\nanother, saying: \"It seemeth that our profits have stopped our profits,\nand by reason of the profits we have made, we can make no more profits.\nHow is it that our profits are become unprofitable to us, and our gains\ndo make us poor? Let us therefore send for the soothsayers, that they may\ninterpret this thing unto us,\" and they sent for them.\n\n\"'Now, the soothsayers were men learned in dark sayings, who joined\nthemselves to the capitalists by reason of the water of the capitalists,\nthat they might have thereof and live, they and their children. And they\nspake for the capitalists unto the people, and did their embassies for\nthem, seeing that the capitalists were not a folk quick of understanding\nneither ready of speech.\n\n\"'And the capitalists demanded of the soothsayers that they should\ninterpret this thing unto them, wherefore it was that the people bought\nno more water of them, although the tank was full. And certain of the\nsoothsayers answered and said, \"It is by reason of overproduction,\" and\nsome said, \"It is glut\"; but the signification of the two words is the\nsame. And others said, \"Nay, but this thing is by reason of the spots on\nthe sun.\" And yet others answered, saying, \"It is neither by reason of\nglut, nor yet of spots on the sun that this evil hath come to pass, but\nbecause of lack of confidence.\"\n\n\"'And while the soothsayers contended among themselves, according to\ntheir manner, the men of profit did slumber and sleep, and when they\nawoke they said to the soothsayers: \"It is enough. Ye have spoken\ncomfortably unto us. Now go ye forth and speak comfortably likewise unto\nthis people, so that they be at rest and leave us also in peace.\"\n\n\"'But the soothsayers, even the men of the dismal science--for so they\nwere named of some--were loath to go forth to the people lest they should\nbe stoned, for the people loved them not. And they said to the\ncapitalists:\n\n\"'\"Masters, it is a mystery of our craft that if men be full and thirst\nnot but be at rest, then shall they find comfort in our speech even as\nye. Yet if they thirst and be empty, find they no comfort therein but\nrather mock us, for it seemeth that unless a man be full our wisdom\nappeareth unto him but emptiness.\" But the capitalists said: \"Go ye\nforth. Are ye not our men to do our embassies?\"\n\n\"'And the soothsayers went forth to the people and expounded to them the\nmystery of overproduction, and how it was that they must needs perish of\nthirst because there was overmuch water, and how there could not be\nenough because there was too much. And likewise spoke they unto the\npeople concerning the sun spots, and also wherefore it was that these\nthings had come upon them by reason of lack of confidence. And it was\neven as the soothsayers had said, for to the people their wisdom seemed\nemptiness. And the people reviled them, saying: \"Go up, ye bald-heads!\nWill ye mock us? Doth plenty breed famine? Doth nothing come out of\nmuch?\" And they took up stones to stone them.\n\n\"'And when the capitalists saw that the people still murmured and would\nnot give ear to the soothsayers, and because also they feared lest they\nshould come upon the tank and take of the water by force, they brought\nforth to them certain holy men (but they were false priests), who spake\nunto the people that they should be quiet and trouble not the capitalists\nbecause they thirsted. And these holy men, who were false priests,\ntestified to the people that this affliction was sent to them of God for\nthe healing of their souls, and that if they should bear it in patience\nand lust not after the water, neither trouble the capitalists, it would\ncome to pass that after they had given up the ghost they would come to a\ncountry where there should be no capitalists but an abundance of water.\nHowbeit, there were certain true prophets of God also, and these had\ncompassion on the people and would not prophesy for the capitalists, but\nrather spake constantly against them.\n\n\"'Now, when the capitalists saw that the people still murmured and would\nnot be still, neither for the words of the soothsayers nor of the false\npriests, they came forth themselves unto them and put the ends of their\nfingers in the water that overflowed in the tank and wet the tips\nthereof, and they scattered the drops from the tips of their fingers\nabroad upon the people who thronged the tank, and the name of the drops\nof water was charity, and they were exceeding bitter.\n\n\"'And when the capitalists saw yet again that neither for the words of\nthe soothsayers, nor of the holy men who were false priests, nor yet for\nthe drops that were called charity, would the people be still, but raged\nthe more, and crowded upon the tank as if they would take it by force,\nthen took they counsel together and sent men privily forth among the\npeople. And these men sought out the mightiest among the people and all\nwho had skill in war, and took them apart and spake craftily with them,\nsaying:\n\n\"'\"Come, now, why cast ye not your lot in with the capitalists? If ye\nwill be their men and serve them against the people, that they break not\nin upon the tank, then shall ye have abundance of water, that ye perish\nnot, ye and your children.\"\n\n\"'And the mighty men and they who were skilled in war hearkened unto this\nspeech and suffered themselves to be persuaded, for their thirst\nconstrained them, and they went within unto the capitalists and became\ntheir men, and staves and swords were put in their hands and they became\na defense unto the capitalists and smote the people when they thronged\nupon the tank.\n\n\"'And after many days the water was low in the tank, for the capitalists\ndid make fountains and fish ponds of the water thereof, and did bathe\ntherein, they and their wives and their children, and did waste the water\nfor their pleasure.\n\n\"'And when the capitalists saw that the tank was empty, they said, \"The\ncrisis is ended\"; and they sent forth and hired the people that they\nshould bring water to fill it again. And for the water that the people\nbrought to the tank they received for every bucket a penny, but for the\nwater which the capitalists drew forth from the tank to give again to the\npeople they received two pennies, that they might have their profit. And\nafter a time did the tank again overflow even as before.\n\n\"'And now, when many times the people had filled the tank until it\noverflowed and had thirsted till the water therein had been wasted by the\ncapitalists, it came to pass that there arose in the land certain men who\nwere called agitators, for that they did stir up the people. And they\nspake to the people, saying that they should associate, and then would\nthey have no need to be servants of the capitalists and should thirst no\nmore for water. And in the eyes of the capitalists were the agitators\npestilent fellows, and they would fain have crucified them, but durst not\nfor fear of the people.\n\n\"'And the words of the agitators which they spake to the people were on\nthis wise:\n\n\"'\"Ye foolish people, how long will ye be deceived by a lie and believe\nto your hurt that which is not? for behold all these things that have\nbeen said unto you by the capitalists and by the soothsayers are\ncunningly devised fables. And likewise the holy men, who say that it is\nthe will of God that ye should always be poor and miserable and athirst,\nbehold! they do blaspheme God and are liars, whom he will bitterly judge\nthough he forgive all others. How cometh it that ye may not come by the\nwater in the tank? Is it not because ye have no money? And why have ye no\nmoney? Is it not because ye receive but one penny for every bucket that\nye bring to the tank, which is the Market, but must render two pennies\nfor every bucket ye take out, so that the capitalists may have their\nprofit? See ye not how by this means the tank must overflow, being filled\nby that ye lack and made to abound out of your emptiness? See ye not also\nthat the harder ye toil and the more diligently ye seek and bring the\nwater, the worse and not the better it shall be for you by reason of the\nprofit, and that forever?\"\n\n\"'After this manner spake the agitators for many days unto the people,\nand none heeded them, but it was so that after a time the people\nhearkened. And they answered and said unto the agitators:\n\n\"'\"Ye say truth. It is because of the capitalists and of their profits\nthat we want, seeing that by reason of them and their profits we may by\nno means come by the fruit of our labor, so that our labor is in vain,\nand the more we toil to fill the tank the sooner doth it overflow, and we\nmay receive nothing because there is too much, according to the words of\nthe soothsayers. But behold, the capitalists are hard men and their\ntender mercies are cruel. Tell us if ye know any way whereby we may\ndeliver ourselves out of our bondage unto them. But if ye know of no\ncertain way of deliverance we beseech you to hold your peace and let us\nalone, that we may forget our misery.\"\n\n\"'And the agitators answered and said, \"We know a way.\"\n\n\"'And the people said: \"Deceive us not, for this thing hath been from the\nbeginning, and none hath found a way of deliverance until now, though\nmany have sought it carefully with tears. But if ye know a way, speak\nunto us quickly.\"\n\n\"'Then the agitators spake unto the people of the way. And they said:\n\n\"'\"Behold, what need have ye at all of these capitalists, that ye should\nyield them profits upon your labor? What great thing do they wherefore ye\nrender them this tribute? Lo! it is only because they do order you in\nbands and lead you out and in and set your tasks and afterward give you a\nlittle of the water yourselves have brought and not they. Now, behold the\nway out of this bondage! Do ye for yourselves that which is done by the\ncapitalists--namely, the ordering of your labor, and the marshaling of\nyour bands, and the dividing of your tasks. So shall ye have no need at\nall of the capitalists and no more yield to them any profit, but all the\nfruit of your labor shall ye share as brethren, every one having the\nsame; and so shall the tank never overflow until every man is full, and\nwould not wag the tongue for more, and afterward shall ye with the\noverflow make pleasant fountains and fish ponds to delight yourselves\nwithal even as did the capitalists; but these shall be for the delight of\nall.\"\n\n\"'And the people answered, \"How shall we go about to do this thing, for\nit seemeth good to us?\"\n\n\"'And the agitators answered: \"Choose ye discreet men to go in and out\nbefore you and to marshal your bands and order your labor, and these men\nshall be as the capitalists were; but, behold, they shall not be your\nmasters as the capitalists are, but your brethren and officers who do\nyour will, and they shall not take any profits, but every man his share\nlike the others, that there may be no more masters and servants among\nyou, but brethren only. And from time to time, as ye see fit, ye shall\nchoose other discreet men in place of the first to order the labor.\"\n\n\"'And the people hearkened, and the thing was very good to them. Likewise\nseemed it not a hard thing. And with one voice they cried out, \"So let it\nbe as ye have said, for we will do it!\"\n\n\"'And the capitalists heard the noise of the shouting and what the people\nsaid, and the soothsayers heard it also, and likewise the false priests\nand the mighty men of war, who were a defense unto the capitalists; and\nwhen they heard they trembled exceedingly, so that their knees smote\ntogether, and they said one to another, \"It is the end of us!\"\n\n\"'Howbeit, there were certain true priests of the living God who would\nnot prophesy for the capitalists, but had compassion on the people; and\nwhen they heard the shouting of the people and what they said, they\nrejoiced with exceeding great joy, and gave thanks to God because of the\ndeliverance.\n\n\"'And the people went and did all the things that were told them of the\nagitators to do. And it came to pass as the agitators had said, even\naccording to all their words. And there was no more any thirst in that\nland, neither any that was ahungered, nor naked, nor cold, nor in any\nmanner of want; and every man said unto his fellow, \"My brother,\" and\nevery woman said unto her companion, \"My sister,\" for so were they with\none another as brethren and sisters which do dwell together in unity. And\nthe blessing of God rested upon that land forever.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nI AM SHOWN ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH.\n\nThe boys and girls of the political-economy class rose to their feet at\nthe teacher's word of dismissal, and in the twinkling of an eye the scene\nwhich had been absorbing my attention disappeared, and I found myself\nstaring at Dr. Leete's smiling countenance and endeavoring to imagine how\nI had come to be where I was. During the greater part and all the latter\npart of the session of the class so absolute had been the illusion of\nbeing actually present in the schoolroom, and so absorbing the interest\nof the theme, that I had quite forgotten the extraordinary device by\nwhich I was enabled to see and hear the proceedings. Now, as I recalled\nit, my mind reverted with an impulse of boundless curiosity to the\nelectroscope and the processes by which it performed its miracles.\n\nHaving given me some explanation of the mechanical operation of the\napparatus and the way in which it served the purpose of a prolonged optic\nnerve, the doctor went on to exhibit its powers on a large scale. During\nthe following hour, without leaving my chair, I made the tour of the\nearth, and learned by the testimony of my senses that the transformation\nwhich had come over Boston since my former life was but a sample of that\nwhich the whole world of men had undergone. I had but to name a great\ncity or a famous locality in any country to be at once present there so\nfar as sight and hearing were concerned. I looked down on modern New\nYork, then upon Chicago, upon San Francisco, and upon New Orleans,\nfinding each of these cities quite unrecognizable but for the natural\nfeatures which constituted their setting. I visited London. I heard the\nParisians talk French and the Berlinese talk German, and from St.\nPetersburg went to Cairo by way of Delhi. One city would be bathed in the\nnoonday sun; over the next I visited, the moon, perhaps, was rising and\nthe stars coming out; while over the third the silence of midnight\nbrooded. In Paris, I remember, it was raining hard, and in London fog\nreigned supreme. In St. Petersburg there was a snow squall. Turning from\nthe contemplation of the changing world of men to the changeless face of\nNature, I renewed my old-time acquaintance with the natural wonders of\nthe earth--the thundering cataracts, the stormy ocean shores, the lonely\nmountain tops, the great rivers, the glittering splendors of the polar\nregions, and the desolate places of the deserts.\n\nMeanwhile the doctor explained to me that not only the telephone and\nelectroscope were always connected with a great number of regular\nstations commanding all scenes of special interest, but that whenever in\nany part of the world there occurred a spectacle or accident of\nparticular interest, special connections were instantly made, so that all\nmankind could at once see what the situation was for themselves without\nneed of actual or alleged special artists on the spot.\n\nWith all my conceptions of time and space reduced to chaos, and well-nigh\ndrunk with wonder, I exclaimed at last:\n\n\"I can stand no more of this just now! I am beginning to doubt seriously\nwhether I am in or out of the body.\"\n\nAs a practical way of settling that question the doctor proposed a brisk\nwalk, for we had not been out of the house that morning.\n\n\"Have we had enough of economics for the day?\" he asked as we left the\nhouse, \"or would you like to attend the afternoon session the teacher\nspoke of?\"\n\nI replied that I wished to attend it by all means.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the doctor; \"it will doubtless be very short, and what\ndo you say to attending it this time in person? We shall have plenty of\ntime for our walk and can easily get to the school before the hour by\ntaking a car from any point. Seeing this is the first time you have used\nthe electroscope, and have no assurance except its testimony that any\nsuch school or pupils really exist, perhaps it would help to confirm any\nimpressions you may have received to visit the spot in the body.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nTHE STRIKERS.\n\nPresently, as we were crossing Boston Common, absorbed in conversation, a\nshadow fell athwart the way, and looking up, I saw towering above us a\nsculptured group of heroic size.\n\n\"Who are these?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You ought to know if any one,\" said the doctor. \"They are contemporaries\nof yours who were making a good deal of disturbance in your day.\"\n\nBut, indeed, it had only been as an involuntary expression of surprise\nthat I had questioned what the figures stood for.\n\nLet me tell you, readers of the twentieth century, what I saw up there on\nthe pedestal, and you will recognize the world-famous group. Shoulder to\nshoulder, as if rallied to resist assault, were three figures of men in\nthe garb of the laboring class of my time. They were bareheaded, and\ntheir coarse-textured shirts, rolled above the elbow and open at the\nbreast, showed the sinewy arms and chest. Before them, on the ground, lay\na pair of shovels and a pickaxe. The central figure, with the right hand\nextended, palm outward, was pointing to the discarded tools. The arms of\nthe other two were folded on their breasts. The faces were coarse and\nhard in outline and bristled with unkempt beards. Their expression was\none of dogged defiance, and their gaze was fixed with such scowling\nintensity upon the void space before them that I involuntarily glanced\nbehind me to see what they were looking at. There were two women also in\nthe group, as coarse of dress and features as the men. One was kneeling\nbefore the figure on the right, holding up to him with one arm an\nemaciated, half-clad infant, while with the other she indicated the\nimplements at his feet with an imploring gesture. The second of the women\nwas plucking by the sleeve the man on the left as if to draw him back,\nwhile with the other hand she covered her eyes. But the men heeded the\nwomen not at all, or seemed, in their bitter wrath, to know that they\nwere there.\n\n\"Why,\" I exclaimed, \"these are strikers!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"this is The Strikers, Huntington's masterpiece,\nconsidered the greatest group of statuary in the city and one of the\ngreatest in the country.\"\n\n\"Those people are alive!\" I said.\n\n\"That is expert testimony,\" replied the doctor. \"It is a pity Huntington\ndied too soon to hear it. He would have been pleased.\"\n\nNow, I, in common with the wealthy and cultured class generally, of my\nday, had always held strikers in contempt and abhorrence, as blundering,\ndangerous marplots, as ignorant of their own best interests as they were\nreckless of other people's, and generally as pestilent fellows, whose\ndemonstrations, so long as they were not violent, could not unfortunately\nbe repressed by force, but ought always to be condemned, and promptly put\ndown with an iron hand the moment there was an excuse for police\ninterference. There was more or less tolerance among the well-to-do, for\nsocial reformers, who, by book or voice, advocated even very radical\neconomic changes so long as they observed the conventionalities of\nspeech, but for the striker there were few apologists. Of course, the\ncapitalists emptied on him the vials of their wrath and contempt, and\neven people who thought they sympathized with the working class shook\ntheir heads at the mention of strikes, regarding them as calculated\nrather to hinder than help the emancipation of labor. Bred as I was in\nthese prejudices, it may not seem strange that I was taken aback at\nfinding such unpromising subjects selected for the highest place in the\ncity.\n\n\"There is no doubt as to the excellence of the artist's work,\" I said,\n\"but what was there about the strikers that has made you pick them out of\nour generation as objects of veneration?\"\n\n\"We see in them,\" replied the doctor, \"the pioneers in the revolt against\nprivate capitalism which brought in the present civilization. We honor\nthem as those who, like Winkelried, 'made way for liberty, and died.' We\nrevere in them the protomartyrs of co-operative industry and economic\nequality.\"\n\n\"But I can assure you, doctor, that these fellows, at least in my day,\nhad not the slightest idea of revolting against private capitalism as a\nsystem. They were very ignorant and quite incapable of grasping so large\na conception. They had no notion of getting along without capitalists.\nAll they imagined as possible or desirable was a little better treatment\nby their employers, a few cents more an hour, a few minutes less working\ntime a day, or maybe merely the discharge of an unpopular foreman. The\nmost they aimed at was some petty improvement in their condition, to\nattain which they did not hesitate to throw the whole industrial machine\ninto disorder.\"\n\n\"All which we moderns know quite well,\" replied the doctor. \"Look at\nthose faces. Has the sculptor idealized them? Are they the faces of\nphilosophers? Do they not bear out your statement that the strikers, like\nthe working-men generally, were, as a rule, ignorant, narrow-minded men,\nwith no grasp of large questions, and incapable of so great an idea as\nthe overthrow of an immemorial economic order? It is quite true that\nuntil some years after you fell asleep they did not realize that their\nquarrel was with private capitalism and not with individual capitalists.\nIn this slowness of awakening to the full meaning of their revolt they\nwere precisely on a par with the pioneers of all the great liberty\nrevolutions. The minutemen at Concord and Lexington, in 1775, did not\nrealize that they were pointing their guns at the monarchical idea. As\nlittle did the third estate of France, when it entered the Convention in\n1789, realize that its road lay over the ruins of the throne. As little\ndid the pioneers of English freedom, when they began to resist the will\nof Charles I, foresee that they would be compelled, before they got\nthrough, to take his head. In none of these instances, however, has\nposterity considered that the limited foresight of the pioneers as to the\nfull consequences of their action lessened the world's debt to the crude\ninitiative, without which the fuller triumph would never have come. The\nlogic of the strike meant the overthrow of the irresponsible conduct of\nindustry, whether the strikers knew it or not, and we can not rejoice in\nthe consequences of that overthrow without honoring them in a way which\nvery likely, as you intimate, would surprise them, could they know of it,\nas much as it does you. Let me try to give you the modern point of view\nas to the part played by their originals.\" We sat down upon one of the\nbenches before the statue, and the doctor went on:\n\n\"My dear Julian, who was it, pray, that first roused the world of your\nday to the fact that there was an industrial question, and by their\npathetic demonstrations of passive resistance to wrong for fifty years\nkept the public attention fixed on that question till it was settled? Was\nit your statesmen, perchance your economists, your scholars, or any other\nof your so-called wise men? No. It was just those despised, ridiculed,\ncursed, and hooted fellows up there on that pedestal who with their\nperpetual strikes would not let the world rest till their wrong, which\nwas also the whole world's wrong, was righted. Once more had God chosen\nthe foolish things of this world to confound the wise, the weak things to\nconfound the mighty.\n\n\"In order to realize how powerfully these strikes operated to impress\nupon the people the intolerable wickedness and folly of private\ncapitalism, you must remember that events are what teach men, that deeds\nhave a far more potent educating influence than any amount of doctrine,\nand especially so in an age like yours, when the masses had almost no\nculture or ability to reason. There were not lacking in the revolutionary\nperiod many cultured men and women, who, with voice and pen, espoused the\nworkers' cause, and showed them the way out; but their words might well\nhave availed little but for the tremendous emphasis with which they were\nconfirmed by the men up there, who starved to prove them true. Those\nrough-looking fellows, who probably could not have constructed a\ngrammatical sentence, by their combined efforts, were demonstrating the\nnecessity of a radically new industrial system by a more convincing\nargument than any rhetorician's skill could frame. When men take their\nlives in their hands to resist oppression, as those men did, other men\nare compelled to give heed to them. We have inscribed on the pedestal\nyonder, where you see the lettering, the words, which the action of the\ngroup above seems to voice:\n\n\"'We can bear no more. It is better to starve than live on the terms you\ngive us. Our lives, the lives of our wives and of our children, we set\nagainst your gains. If you put your foot upon our neck, we will bite your\nheel!'\n\n\"This was the cry,\" pursued the doctor, \"of men made desperate by\noppression, to whom existence through suffering had become of no value.\nIt was the same cry that in varied form but in one sense has been the\nwatchword of every revolution that has marked an advance of the\nrace--'Give us liberty, or give us death!' and never did it ring out with\na cause so adequate, or wake the world to an issue so mighty, as in the\nmouths of these first rebels against the folly and the tyranny of private\ncapital.\n\n\"In your age, I know, Julian,\" the doctor went on in a gentler tone, \"it\nwas customary to associate valor with the clang of arms and the pomp and\ncircumstance of war. But the echo of the fife and drum comes very faintly\nup to us, and moves us not at all. The soldier has had his day, and\npassed away forever with the ideal of manhood which he illustrated. But\nthat group yonder stands for a type of self-devotion that appeals to us\nprofoundly. Those men risked their lives when they flung down the tools\nof their trade, as truly as any soldiers going into battle, and took odds\nas desperate, and not only for themselves, but for their families, which\nno grateful country would care for in case of casualty to them. The\nsoldier went forth cheered with music, and supported by the enthusiasm of\nthe country, but these others were covered with ignominy and public\ncontempt, and their failures and defeats were hailed with general\nacclamation. And yet they sought not the lives of others, but only that\nthey might barely live; and though they had first thought of the welfare\nof themselves, and those nearest them, yet not the less were they\nfighting the fight of humanity and posterity in striking in the only way\nthey could, and while yet no one else dared strike at all, against the\neconomic system that had the world by the throat, and would never relax\nits grip by dint of soft words, or anything less than disabling blows.\nThe clergy, the economists and the pedagogues, having left these ignorant\nmen to seek as they might the solution of the social problem, while they\nthemselves sat at ease and denied that there was any problem, were very\nvoluble in their criticisms of the mistakes of the workingmen, as if it\nwere possible to make any mistake in seeking a way out of the social\nchaos, which could be so fatuous or so criminal as the mistake of not\ntrying to seek any. No doubt, Julian, I have put finer words in the\nmouths of those men up there than their originals might have even\nunderstood, but if the meaning was not in their words it was in their\ndeeds. And it is for what they did, not for what they said, that we honor\nthem as protomartyrs of the industrial republic of to-day, and bring our\nchildren, that they may kiss in gratitude the rough-shod feet of those\nwho made the way for us.\"\n\nMy experiences since I waked up in this year 2000 might be said to have\nconsisted of a succession of instantaneous mental readjustments of a\nrevolutionary character, in which what had formerly seemed evil to me had\nbecome good, and what had seemed wisdom had become foolishness. Had this\nconversation about the strikers taken place anywhere else, the entirely\nnew impression I had received of the part played by them in the great\nsocial revolution of which I shared the benefit would simply have been\none more of these readjustments, and the process entirely a mental one.\nBut the presence of this wondrous group, the lifelikeness of the figures\ngrowing on my gaze as I listened to the doctor's words, imparted a\npeculiar personal quality--if I may use the term--to the revulsion of\nfeeling that I experienced. Moved by an irresistible impulse, I rose to\nmy feet, and, removing my hat, saluted the grim forms whose living\noriginals I had joined my contemporaries in reviling.\n\nThe doctor smiled gravely.\n\n\"Do you know, my boy,\" he said, \"it is not often that the whirligig of\nTime brings round his revenges in quite so dramatic a way as this?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nFOREIGN COMMERCE UNDER PROFITS; PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE, OR BETWEEN THE\nDEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA.\n\nWe arrived at the Arlington School some time before the beginning of the\nrecitation which we were to attend, and the doctor took the opportunity\nto introduce me to the teacher. He was extremely interested to learn that\nI had attended the morning session, and very desirous to know something\nof my impressions. As to the forthcoming recitation, he suggested that if\nthe members of the class were aware that they had so distinguished an\nauditor, it would be likely to embarrass them, and he should therefore\nsay nothing about my presence until the close of the session, when he\nshould crave the privilege of presenting his pupils to me personally. He\nhoped I would permit this, as it would be for them the event of a\nlifetime which their grandchildren would never tire of hearing them\ndescribe. The entrance of the class interrupted our conversation, and the\ndoctor and myself, having taken our seats in a gallery, where we could\nhear and see without being seen, the session at once began.\n\n\"This morning,\" said the teacher, \"we confined ourselves for the sake of\nclearness to the effects of the profit system upon a nation or community\nconsidered as if it were alone in the world and without relations to\nother communities. There is no way in which such outside relations\noperated to negative any of the laws of profit which were brought out\nthis morning, but they did operate to extend the effect of those laws in\nmany interesting ways, and without some reference to foreign commerce our\nreview of the profit system would be incomplete.\n\n\"In the so-called political economies of our forefathers we read a vast\ndeal about the advantages to a country of having an international trade.\nIt was supposed to be one of the great secrets of national prosperity,\nand a chief study of the nineteenth-century statesmen seems to have been\nto establish and extend foreign commerce.--Now, Paul, will you tell us\nthe economic theory as to the advantages of foreign commerce?\"\n\n\"It is based on the fact,\" said the lad Paul, \"that countries differ in\nclimate, natural resources, and other conditions, so that in some it is\nwholly impossible or very difficult to produce certain needful things,\nwhile it is very easy to produce certain other things in greater\nabundance than is needed. In former times also there were marked\ndifferences in the grade of civilization and the condition of the arts in\ndifferent countries, which still further modified their respective powers\nin the production of wealth. This being so, it might obviously be for the\nmutual advantage of countries to exchange with one another what they\ncould produce against what they could not produce at all or only with\ndifficulty, and not merely thus secure many things which otherwise they\nmust go without, but also greatly increase the total effectiveness of\ntheir industry by applying it to the sorts of production best fitted to\ntheir conditions. In order, however, that the people of the respective\ncountries should actually derive this advantage or any advantage from\nforeign exchange, it would be necessary that the exchanges should be\ncarried on in the general interest for the purpose of giving the people\nat large the benefit of them, as is done at the present day, when foreign\ncommerce, like other economic undertakings, is carried on by the\ngovernments of the several countries. But there was, of course, no\nnational agency to carry on foreign commerce in that day. The foreign\ntrade, just like the internal processes of production and distribution,\nwas conducted by the capitalists on the profit system. The result was\nthat all the benefits of this fair sounding theory of foreign commerce\nwere either totally nullified or turned into curses, and the\ninternational trade relations of the countries constituted merely a\nlarger field for illustrating the baneful effects of the profit system\nand its power to turn good to evil and 'shut the gates of mercy on\nmankind.'\"\n\nHOW PROFITS NULLIFIED THE BENEFIT OF COMMERCE.\n\n\"Illustrate, please, the operation of the profit system in international\ntrade.\"\n\n\"Let us suppose,\" said the boy Paul, \"that America could produce grain\nand other food stuffs with great cheapness and in greater quantities than\nthe people needed. Suppose, on the contrary, that England could produce\nfood stuffs only with difficulty and in small quantities. Suppose,\nhowever, that England, on account of various conditions, could produce\nclothing and hardware much more cheaply and abundantly than America. In\nsuch a case it would seem that both countries would be gainers if\nAmericans exchanged the food stuffs which it was so easy for them to\nproduce for the clothing and hardware which it was so easy for the\nEnglish to produce. The result would appear to promise a clear and equal\ngain for both people. But this, of course, is on the supposition that the\nexchange should be negotiated by a public agency for the benefit of the\nrespective populations at large. But when, as in those days, the exchange\nwas negotiated wholly by private capitalists competing for private\nprofits at the expense of the communities, the result was totally\ndifferent.\n\n\"The American grain merchant who exported grain to the English would be\nimpelled, by the competition of other American grain merchants, to put\nhis price to the English as low as possible, and to do that he would beat\ndown to the lowest possible figure the American farmer who produced the\ngrain. And not only must the American merchant sell as low as his\nAmerican rivals, but he must also undersell the grain merchants of other\ngrain-producing countries, such as Russia, Egypt, and India. And now let\nus see how much benefit the English people received from the cheap\nAmerican grain. We will say that, owing to the foreign food supply, the\ncost of living declined one half or a third in England. Here would seem a\ngreat gain surely; but look at the other side of it. The English must pay\nfor their grain by supplying the Americans with cloth and hardware. The\nEnglish manufacturers of these things were rivals just as the American\ngrain merchants were--each one desirous of capturing as large a part of\nthe American market as he could. He must therefore, if possible,\nundersell his home rivals. Moreover, like the American grain merchant,\nthe English manufacturer must contend with foreign rivals. Belgium and\nGermany made hardware and cloth very cheaply, and the Americans would\nexchange their grain for these commodities with the Belgians and the\nGermans unless the English sold cheaper. Now, the main element in the\ncost of making cloth and hardware was the wages paid for labor. A\npressure was accordingly sure to be brought to bear by every English\nmanufacturer upon his workmen to compel them to accept lower wages so\nthat he might undersell his English rivals, and also cut under the German\nand Belgian manufacturers, who were trying to get the American trade. Now\ncan the English workman live on less wages than before? Plainly he can,\nfor his food supply has been greatly cheapened. Presently, therefore, he\nfinds his wages forced down by as much as the cheaper food supply has\ncheapened his living, and so finds himself just where he was to start\nwith before the American trade began. And now look again at the American\nfarmer. He is now getting his imported clothing and tools much cheaper\nthan before, and consequently the lowest living price at which he can\nafford to sell grain is considerably lower than before the English trade\nbegan--lower by so much, in fact, as he has saved on his tools and\nclothing. Of this, the grain merchant, of course, took prompt advantage,\nfor unless he put his grain into the English market lower than other\ngrain merchants, he would lose his trade, and Russia, Egypt, and India\nstood ready to flood England with grain if the Americans could not bid\nbelow them, and then farewell to cheap cloth and tools! So down presently\nwent the price the American farmer received for his grain, until the\nreduction absorbed all that he had gained by the cheaper imported fabrics\nand hardware, and he, like his fellow-victim across the sea--the English\niron worker or factory operative--was no better off than he was before\nEnglish trade had been suggested.\n\n\"But was he as well off? Was either the American or the English worker as\nwell off as before this interchange of products began, which, if rightly\nconducted, would have been so greatly beneficial to both? On the\ncontrary, both alike were in important ways distinctly worse off. Each\nhad indeed done badly enough before, but the industrial system on which\nthey depended, being limited by the national borders, was comparatively\nsimple and uncomplex, self-sustaining, and liable only to local and\ntransient disturbances, the effect of which could be to some extent\nestimated, possibly remedied. Now, however, the English operatives and\nthe American farmer had alike become dependent upon the delicate balance\nof a complex set of international adjustments liable at any moment to\nderangements that might take away their livelihood, without leaving them\neven the small satisfaction of understanding what hurt them. The prices\nof their labor or their produce were no longer dependent as before upon\nestablished local customs and national standards of living, but had\nbecome subject to determination by the pitiless necessities of a\nworld-wide competition in which the American farmer and the English\nartisan were forced into rivalship with the Indian ryot, the Egyptian\nfellah, the half-starved Belgian miner, or the German weaver. In former\nages, before international trade had become general, when one nation was\ndown another was up, and there was always hope in looking over seas; but\nthe prospect which the unlimited development of international commerce\nupon the profit system was opening to mankind the latter part of the\nnineteenth century was that of a world-wide standard of living fixed by\nthe rate at which life could be supported by the worst-used races.\nInternational trade was already showing itself to be the instrumentality\nby which the world-wide plutocracy would soon have established its sway\nif the great Revolution had tarried.\"\n\n\"In the case of the supposed reciprocal trade between England and\nAmerica, which you have used as an illustration,\" said the teacher, \"you\nhave assumed that the trade relation was an exchange of commodities on\nequal terms. In such a case it appears that the effect of the profit\nsystem was to leave the masses of both countries somewhat worse off than\nthey would have been without foreign trade, the gain on both the American\nand English side inuring wholly to the manufacturing and trading\ncapitalists. But in fact both countries in a trade relation were not\nusually on equal terms. The capitalists of one were often far more\npowerful than those of another, and had a stronger or older economic\norganization at their service. In that case what was the result?\"\n\n\"The overwhelming competition of the capitalists of the stronger country\ncrushed out the enterprises of the capitalists of the weaker country, the\npeople of which consequently became wholly dependent upon the foreign\ncapitalists for many productions which otherwise would have been produced\nat home to the profit of home capitalists, and in proportion as the\ncapitalists of the dependent country were thus rendered economically\nincapable of resistance the capitalists of the stronger country regulated\nat their pleasure the terms of trade. The American colonies, in 1776,\nwere driven to revolt against England by the oppression resulting from\nsuch a relation. The object of founding colonies, which was one of the\nmain ends of seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth century\nstatesmanship, was to bring new communities into this relation of\neconomic vassalage to the home capitalists, who, having beggared the home\nmarket by their profit, saw no prospect of making more except by\nfastening their suckers upon outside communities. Great Britain, whose\ncapitalists were strongest of all, was naturally the leader in this\npolicy, and the main end of her wars and her diplomacy for many centuries\nbefore the great Revolution was to obtain such colonies, and to secure\nfrom weaker nations trade concessions and openings--peaceably if\npossible, at the mouth of the cannon if necessary.\"\n\n\"How about the condition of the masses in a country thus reduced to\ncommercial vassalage to the capitalists of another country? Was it\nnecessarily worse than the condition of the masses of the superior\ncountry?\"\n\n\"That did not follow at all. We must constantly keep in mind that the\ninterests of the capitalists and of the people were not identical. The\nprosperity of the capitalists of a country by no means implied prosperity\non the part of the population, nor the reverse. If the masses of the\ndependent country had not been exploited by foreign capitalists, they\nwould have been by domestic capitalists. Both they and the working masses\nof the superior country were equally the tools and slaves of the\ncapitalists, who did not treat workingmen any better on account of being\ntheir fellow countrymen than if they had been foreigners. It was the\ncapitalists of the dependent country rather than the masses who suffered\nby the suppression of independent business enterprises.\"\n\nBETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA.\n\n\"That will do, Paul.--We will now ask some information from you, Helen,\nas to a point which Paul's last words have suggested. During the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries a bitter controversy raged among our\nancestors between two parties in opinion and politics, calling\nthemselves, respectively, the Protectionists and the Free Traders, the\nformer of whom held that it was well to shut out the competition of\nforeign capitalists in the market of a country by a tariff upon imports,\nwhile the latter held that no impediment should be allowed to the\nentirely free course of trade. What have you to say as to the merits of\nthis controversy?\"\n\n\"Merely,\" replied the girl called Helen, \"that the difference between the\ntwo policies, so far as it affected the people at large, reduced itself\nto the question whether they preferred being fleeced by home or foreign\ncapitalists. Free trade was the cry of the capitalists who felt\nthemselves able to crush those of rival nations if allowed the\nopportunity to compete with them. Protection was the cry of the\ncapitalists who felt themselves weaker than those of other nations, and\nfeared that their enterprises would be crushed and their profits taken\naway if free competition were allowed. The Free Traders were like a man\nwho, seeing his antagonist is no match for him, boldly calls for a free\nfight and no favor, while the Protectionist was the man who, seeing\nhimself overmatched, called for the police. The Free Trader held that the\nnatural, God-given right of the capitalist to shear the people anywhere\nhe found them was superior to considerations of race, nationality, or\nboundary lines. The Protectionist, on the contrary, maintained the\npatriotic right of the capitalist to the exclusive shearing of his own\nfellow-countrymen without interference of foreign capitalists. As to the\nmass of the people, the nation at large, it was, as Paul has just said, a\nmatter of indifference whether they were fleeced by the capitalists of\ntheir own country under protection or the capitalists of foreign\ncountries under free trade. The literature of the controversy between\nProtectionists and Free Traders makes this very clear. Whatever else the\nProtectionists failed to prove, they were able to demonstrate that the\ncondition of the people in free-trade countries was quite as bad as\nanywhere else, and, on the other hand, the Free Traders were equally\nconclusive in the proofs they presented that the people in protected\ncountries, other things being equal, were no better off than those in\nfree-trade lands. The question of Protection or Free Trade interested the\ncapitalists only. For the people, it was the choice between the devil and\nthe deep sea.\"\n\n\"Let us have a concrete illustration.\" said the teacher. \"Take the case\nof England. She was beyond comparison the country of all others in the\nnineteenth century which had most foreign trade and commanded most\nforeign markets. If a large volume of foreign trade under conditions\npractically dictated by its capitalists was under the profit system a\nsource of national prosperity to a country, we should expect to see the\nmass of the British people at the end of the nineteenth century enjoying\nan altogether extraordinary felicity and general welfare as compared with\nthat of other peoples or any former people, for never before did a nation\ndevelop so vast a foreign commerce. What were the facts?\"\n\n\"It was common,\" replied the girl, \"for our ancestors in the vague and\nfoggy way in which they used the terms 'nation' and 'national' to speak\nof Great Britain as rich. But it was only her capitalists, some scores of\nthousands of individuals among some forty million people, who were rich.\nThese indeed had incredible accumulations, but the remainder of the forty\nmillions--the whole people, in fact, save an infinitesimal fraction--were\nsunk in poverty. It is said that England had a larger and more hopeless\npauper problem than any other civilized nation. The condition of her\nworking masses was not only more wretched than that of many contemporary\npeople, but was worse, as proved by the most careful economic\ncomparisons, than it had been in the fifteenth century, before foreign\ntrade was thought of. People do not emigrate from a land where they are\nwell off, but the British people, driven out by want, had found the\nfrozen Canadas and the torrid zone more hospitable than their native\nland. As an illustration of the fact that the welfare of the working\nmasses was in no way improved when the capitalists of a country commanded\nforeign markets, it is interesting to note the fact that the British\nemigrant was able to make a better living in English colonies whose\nmarkets were wholly dominated by English capitalists than he had been at\nhome as the employee of those capitalists. We shall remember also that\nMalthus, with his doctrine that it was the best thing that could happen\nto a workingman not to be born, was an Englishman, and based his\nconclusions very logically upon his observation of the conditions of life\nfor the masses in that country which had been more successful than any\nother in any age in monopolizing the foreign markets of the world by its\ncommerce.\n\n\"Or,\" the lad went on, \"take Belgium, that old Flemish land of merchants,\nwhere foreign trade had been longer and more steadily used than in any\nother European country. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the\nmass of the Belgian people, the hardest-worked population in the world,\nwas said to have been, as a rule, without adequate food--to be\nundergoing, in short, a process of slow starvation. They, like the people\nof England and the people of Germany, are proved, by statistical\ncalculations upon the subject that have come down to us, to have been\neconomically very much better off during the fifteenth and early part of\nthe sixteenth century, when foreign trade was hardly known, than they\nwere in the nineteenth. There was a possibility before foreign trade for\nprofit began that a population might obtain some share of the richness of\na bountiful land just from the lack of any outlet for it. But with the\nbeginning of foreign commerce, under the profit system, that possibility\nvanished. Thenceforth everything good or desirable, above what might\nserve for the barest subsistence of labor, was systematically and\nexhaustively gathered up by the capitalists, to be exchanged in foreign\nlands for gold and gems, silks, velvets, and ostrich plumes for the rich.\nAs Goldsmith had it:\n\n  \"Around the world each needful product flies\n  For all the luxuries the world supplies.\"\n\n\"To what has the struggle of the nations for foreign markets in the\nnineteenth century been aptly compared?\"\n\n\"To a contest between galleys manned by slaves, whose owners were racing\nfor a prize.\"\n\n\"In such a race, which crew was likely to fare worse, that of the winning\nor the losing galley?\"\n\n\"That of the winning galley, by all means,\" replied the girl, \"for the\nsupposition is that, other conditions being equal, it was the more sorely\nscourged.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the teacher, \"and on the same principle, when the\ncapitalists of two countries contended for the supplying of a foreign\nmarket it was the workers subject to the successful group of capitalists\nwho were most to be pitied, for, other conditions being equal, they were\nlikely to be those whose wages had been cut lowest and whose general\ncondition was most degraded.\"\n\n\"But tell us,\" said the teacher, \"were there not instances of a general\npoverty in countries having no foreign trade as great as prevailed in the\ncountries you have mentioned?\"\n\n\"Dear me, yes!\" replied the girl. \"I have not meant to convey any\nimpression that because the tender mercies of the foreign capitalists\nwere cruel, those of the domestic capitalist were any less so. The\ncomparison is merely between the operation of the profit system on a\nlarger or smaller scale. So long as the profit system was retained, it\nwould be all one in the end, whether you built a wall around a country\nand left the people to be exploited exclusively by home capitalists, or\nthrew the wall down and let in the foreigners.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nHOSTILITY OF A SYSTEM OF VESTED INTERESTS TO IMPROVEMENT.\n\n\"Now, Florence,\" said the teacher, \"with your assistance we will take up\nthe closing topic in our consideration of the economic system of our\nfathers--namely, its hostility to invention and improvement. It has been\nour painful duty to point out numerous respects in which our respected\nancestors were strangely blind to the true character and effects of their\neconomic institutions, but no instance perhaps is more striking than\nthis. Far from seeing the necessary antagonism between private capitalism\nand the march of improvement which is so plain to us, they appear to have\nsincerely believed that their system was peculiarly favorable to the\nprogress of invention, and that its advantage in this respect was so\ngreat as to be an important set-off to its admitted ethical defects. Here\nthere is decidedly a broad difference in opinion, but fortunately the\nfacts are so well authenticated that we shall have no difficulty in\nconcluding which view is correct.\n\n\"The subject divides itself into two branches: First, the natural\nantagonism of the old system to economic changes; and, second, the effect\nof the profit principle to minimize if not wholly to nullify the benefit\nof such economic improvements as were able to overcome that antagonism so\nfar as to get themselves introduced.--Now, Florence, tell us what there\nwas about the old economic system, the system of private capitalism,\nwhich made it constitutionally opposed to changes in methods.\"\n\n\"It was,\" replied the girl, \"the fact that it consisted of independent\nvested interests without any principle of coordination or combination,\nthe result being that the economic welfare of every individual or group\nwas wholly dependent upon his or its particular vested interest without\nregard to others or to the welfare of the whole body.\"\n\n\"Please bring out your meaning by comparing our modern system in the\nrespect you speak of with private capitalism.\"\n\n\"Our system is a strictly integrated one--that is to say, no one has any\neconomic interest in any part or function of the economic organization\nwhich is distinct from his interest in every other part and function. His\nonly interest is in the greatest possible output of the whole. We have\nour several occupations, but only that we may work the more efficiently\nfor the common fund. We may become very enthusiastic about our special\npursuit, but as a matter of sentiment only, for our economic interests\nare no more dependent upon our special occupation than upon any other. We\nshare equally in the total product, whatever it is.\"\n\n\"How does the integrated character of the economic system affect our\nattitude toward improvements or inventions of any sort in economic\nprocesses?\"\n\n\"We welcome them with eagerness. Why should we not? Any improvement of\nthis sort must necessarily redound to the advantage of every one in the\nnation and to every one's advantage equally. If the occupation affected\nby the invention happens to be our particular employment we lose nothing,\nthough it should make that occupation wholly superfluous. We might in\nthat case feel a little sentimental regret over the passing away of old\nhabits, but that is all. No one's substantial interests are in any way\nmore identified with one pursuit than another. All are in the service of\nthe nation, and it is the business and interest of the nation to see that\nevery one is provided with other work as soon as his former occupation\nbecomes unnecessary to the general weal, and under no circumstances is\nhis rate of maintenance affected. From its first production every\nimprovement in economic processes is therefore an unalloyed blessing to\nall. The inventor comes bringing a gift of greater wealth or leisure in\nhis hand for every one on earth, and it is no wonder that the people's\ngratitude makes his reward the most enviable to be won by a public\nbenefactor.\"\n\n\"Now, Florence, tell us in what way the multitude of distinct vested\ninterests which made up private capitalism operated to produce an\nantagonism toward economic inventions and improvements.\"\n\nHOW PROGRESS ANTAGONIZED VESTED INTERESTS.\n\n\"As I have said,\" replied the girl, \"everybody's interest was wholly\nconfined to and bound up with the particular occupation he was engaged\nin. If he was a capitalist, his capital was embarked in it; if he was an\nartisan, his capital was the knowledge of some particular craft or part\nof a craft, and he depended for his livelihood on the demand for the sort\nof work he had learned how to do. Neither as capitalist or artisan, as\nemployer or employee, had he any economic interest or dependence outside\nof or larger than his special business. Now, the effect of any new idea,\ninvention, or discovery for economic application is to dispense more or\nless completely with the process formerly used in that department, and so\nfar to destroy the economic basis of the occupations connected with that\nbusiness. Under our system, as I have said, that means no loss to\nanybody, but simply a shifting of workers, with a net gain in wealth or\nleisure to all; but then it meant ruin to those involved in the change.\nThe capitalist lost his capital, his plant, his investments more or less\ntotally, and the workingmen lost their means of livelihood and were\nthrown on what you well called the cold charity of the world--a charity\nusually well below zero; and this loss without any rebate or compensation\nwhatever from the public at large on account of any general benefit that\nmight be received from the invention. It was complete. Consequently, the\nmost beneficent of inventions was cruel as death to those who had been\ndependent for living or for profit on the particular occupations it\naffected. The capitalists grew gray from fear of discoveries which in a\nday might turn their costly plants to old iron fit only for the junkshop,\nand the nightmare of the artisan was some machine which should take bread\nfrom his children's mouths by enabling his employer to dispense with his\nservices.\n\n\"Owing to this division of the economic field into a set of vested\npersonal and group interests wholly without coherency or integrating\nidea, each standing or falling by and for itself, every step in the\nadvance of the arts and sciences was gained only at the cost of an amount\nof loss and ruin to particular portions of the community such as would be\nwrought by a blight or pestilence. The march of invention was white with\nthe bleaching bones of innumerable hecatombs of victims. The spinning\njenny replaced the spinning wheel, and famine stalked through English\nvillages. The railroad supplanted the stagecoach, and a thousand hill\ntowns died while as many sprang up in the valleys, and the farmers of the\nEast were pauperized by the new agriculture of the West. Petroleum\nsucceeded whale-oil, and a hundred seaports withered. Coal and iron were\nfound in the South, and the grass grew in the streets of the Northern\ncenters of iron-making. Electricity succeeded steam, and billions of\nrailroad property were wiped out. But what is the use of lengthening a\nlist which might be made interminable? The rule was always the same:\nevery important invention brought uncompensated disaster to some portion\nof the people. Armies of bankrupts, hosts of workers forced into\nvagabondage, a sea of suffering of every sort, made up the price which\nour ancestors paid for every step of progress.\n\n\"Afterward, when the victims had been buried or put out of the way, it\nwas customary with our fathers to celebrate these industrial triumphs,\nand on such occasions a common quotation in the mouths of the orators was\na line of verse to the effect that--\n\n  \"Peace hath her victories not less renowned than those of war.\n\nThe orators were not wont to dwell on the fact that these victories of\nwhat they so oddly called peace were usually purchased at a cost in human\nlife and suffering quite as great as--yes, often greater than--those of\nso-called war. We have all read of Tamerlane's pyramid at Damascus made\nof seventy thousand skulls of his victims. It may be said that if the\nvictims of the various inventions connected with the introduction of\nsteam had consented to contribute their skulls to a monument in honor of\nStevenson or Arkwright it would dwarf Tamerlane's into insignificance.\nTamerlane was a beast, and Arkwright was a genius sent to help men, yet\nthe hideous juggle of the old-time economic system made the benefactor\nthe cause of as much human suffering as the brutal conqueror. It was bad\nenough when men stoned and crucified those who came to help them, but\nprivate capitalism did them a worse outrage still in turning the gifts\nthey brought into curses.\"\n\n\"And did the workers and the capitalists whose interests were threatened\nby the progress of invention take practical means of resisting that\nprogress and suppressing the inventions and the inventors?\"\n\n\"They did all they could in that way. If the working-men had been strong\nenough they would have put an absolute veto on inventions of any sort\ntending to diminish the demand for crude hand labor in their respective\ncrafts. As it was, they did all it was possible for them to accomplish in\nthat direction by trades-union dictation and mob violence; nor can any\none blame the poor fellows for resisting to the utmost improvements which\nimproved them out of the means of livelihood. A machine gun would have\nbeen scarcely more deadly if turned upon the workingmen of that day than\na labor-saving machine. In those bitter times a man thrown out of the\nemployment he had fitted himself for might about as well have been shot,\nand if he were not able to get any other work, as so many were not, he\nwould have been altogether better off had he been killed in battle with\nthe drum and fife to cheer him and the hope of a pension for his family.\nOnly, of course, it was the system of private capitalism and not the\nlabor-saving machine which the workingmen should have attacked, for with\na rational economic system the machine would have been wholly\nbeneficent.\"\n\n\"How did the capitalists resist inventions?\"\n\n\"Chiefly by negative means, though much more effective ones than the mob\nviolence which the workingmen used. The initiative in everything belonged\nto the capitalists. No inventor could introduce an invention, however\nexcellent, unless he could get capitalists to take it up, and this\nusually they would not do unless the inventor relinquished to them most\nof his hopes of profit from the discovery. A much more important\nhindrance to the introduction of inventions resulted from the fact that\nthose who would be interested in taking them up were those already\ncarrying on the business the invention applied to, and their interest was\nin most cases to suppress an innovation which threatened to make obsolete\nthe machinery and methods in which their capital was invested. The\ncapitalist had to be fully assured not only that the invention was a good\none in itself, but that it would be so profitable to himself personally\nas to make up for all the damage to his existing capital before he would\ntouch it. When inventions wholly did away with processes which had been\nthe basis of profit-charging it was often suicidal for the capitalist to\nadopt them. If they could not suppress such inventions in any other way,\nit was their custom to buy them up and pigeonhole them. After the\nRevolution there were found enough of these patents which had been bought\nup and pigeonholed in self-protection by the capitalists to have kept the\nworld in novelties for ten years if nothing more had been discovered. One\nof the most tragical chapters in the history of the old order is made up\nof the difficulties, rebuffs, and lifelong disappointments which\ninventors had to contend with before they could get their discoveries\nintroduced, and the frauds by which in most cases they were swindled out\nof the profits of them by the capitalists through whom their introduction\nwas obtained. These stories seem, indeed, well-nigh incredible nowadays,\nwhen the nation is alert and eager to foster and encourage every stirring\nof the inventive spirit, and every one with any sort of new idea can\ncommand the offices of the administration without cost to safeguard his\nclaim to priority and to furnish him all possible facilities of\ninformation, material, and appliances to perfect his conception.\"\n\n\"Considering,\" said the teacher, \"that these facts as to the resistance\noffered by vested interests to the march of improvement must have been\neven more obvious to our ancestors than to us, how do you account for the\nbelief they seem to have sincerely held that private capitalism as a\nsystem was favorable to invention?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" replied the girl, \"it was because they saw that whenever an\ninvention was introduced it was under the patronage of capitalists. This\nwas, of course, necessarily so because all economic initiative was\nconfined to the capitalists. Our forefathers, observing that inventions\nwhen introduced at all were introduced through the machinery of private\ncapitalism, overlooked the fact that usually it was only after exhausting\nits power as an obstruction to invention that capital lent itself to its\nadvancement. They were in this respect like children who, seeing the\nwater pouring over the edge of a dam and coming over nowhere else, should\nconclude that the dam was an agency for aiding the flow of the river\ninstead of being an obstruction which let it over only when it could be\nkept back no longer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Our lesson,\" said the teacher, \"relates in strictness only to the\neconomic results of the old order, but at times the theme suggests\naspects of former social conditions too important to pass without\nmention. We have seen how obstructive was the system of vested interests\nwhich underlaid private capitalism to the introduction of improvements\nand inventions in the economic field. But there was another field in\nwhich the same influence was exerted with effects really far more\nimportant and disastrous.--Tell us, Florence, something of the manner in\nwhich the vested interest system tended to resist the advance of new\nideas in the field of thought, of morals, science, and religion.\"\n\n\"Previous to the great Revolution,\" the girl replied, \"the highest\neducation not being universal as with us, but limited to a small body,\nthe members of this body, known as the learned and professional classes,\nnecessarily became the moral and intellectual teachers and leaders of the\nnation. They molded the thoughts of the people, set them their standards,\nand through the control of their minds dominated their material interests\nand determined the course of civilization. No such power is now\nmonopolized by any class, because the high level of general education\nwould make it impossible for any class of mere men to lead the people\nblindly. Seeing, however, that such a power was exercised in that day and\nlimited to so small a class, it was a most vital point that this class\nshould be qualified to discharge so responsible a duty in a spirit of\ndevotion to the general weal unbiased by distracting motives. But under\nthe system of private capitalism, which made every person and group\neconomically dependent upon and exclusively concerned in the prosperity\nof the occupation followed by himself and his group, this ideal was\nimpossible of attainment. The learned class, the teachers, the preachers,\nwriters, and professional men were only tradesmen after all, just like\nthe shoemakers and the carpenters, and their welfare was absolutely bound\nup with the demand for the particular sets of ideas and doctrines they\nrepresented and the particular sorts of professional services they got\ntheir living by rendering. Each man's line of teaching or preaching was\nhis vested interest--the means of his livelihood. That being so, the\nmembers of the learned and professional class were bound to be affected\nby innovations in their departments precisely as shoemakers or carpenters\nby inventions affecting their trades. It necessarily followed that when\nany new idea was suggested in religion, in medicine, in science, in\neconomics, in sociology, and indeed in almost any field of thought, the\nfirst question which the learned body having charge of that field and\nmaking a living out of it would ask itself was not whether the idea was\ngood and true and would tend to the general welfare, but how it would\nimmediately and directly affect the set of doctrines, traditions, and\ninstitutions, with the prestige of which their own personal interests\nwere identified. If it was a new religious conception that had been\nsuggested, the clergyman considered, first of all, how it would affect\nhis sect and his personal standing in it. If it were a new medical idea,\nthe doctor asked first how it would affect the practice of the school he\nwas identified with. If it was a new economic or social theory, then all\nthose whose professional capital was their reputation as teachers in that\nbranch questioned first how the new idea agreed with the doctrines and\ntraditions constituting their stock in trade. Now, as any new idea,\nalmost as a matter of course, must operate to discredit previous ideas in\nthe same field, it followed that the economic self-interest of the\nlearned classes would instinctively and almost invariably be opposed to\nreform or advance of thought in their fields.\n\n\"Being human, they were scarcely more to be blamed for involuntarily\nregarding new ideas in their specialties with aversion than the weaver or\nthe brickmaker for resisting the introduction of inventions calculated to\ntake the bread out of his mouth. And yet consider what a tremendous,\nalmost insurmountable, obstacle to human progress was presented by the\nfact that the intellectual leaders of the nations and the molders of the\npeople's thoughts, by their economic dependence upon vested interests in\nestablished ideas, were biased against progress by the strongest motives\nof self-interest. When we give due thought to the significance of this\nfact, we shall find ourselves wondering no longer at the slow rate of\nhuman advance in the past, but rather that there should have been any\nadvance at all.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nHOW THE PROFIT SYSTEM NULLIFIED THE BENEFIT OF INVENTIONS.\n\n\"The general subject of the hostility of private capitalism to\nprogress,\" pursued the teacher, \"divides itself, as I said, into two\nbranches. First, the constitutional antagonism between a system of\ndistinct and separate vested interests and all unsettling changes which,\nwhatever their ultimate effect, must be directly damaging to those\ninterests. We will now ask you, Harold, to take up the second branch of\nthe subject--namely, the effect of the profit principle to minimize, if\nnot wholly to nullify, the benefit to the community of such inventions\nand improvements as were able to overcome the antagonism of vested\ninterests so far as to get themselves introduced. The nineteenth century,\nincluding the last quarter of the eighteenth, was marked by an\nastonishing and absolutely unprecedented number of great inventions in\neconomic processes. To what was this outburst of inventive genius due?\"\n\n\"To the same cause,\" replied the boy, \"which accounts for the rise of the\ndemocratic movement and the idea of human equality during the same\nperiod--that is to say, the diffusion of intelligence among the masses,\nwhich, for the first time becoming somewhat general, multiplied\nten-thousandfold the thinking force of mankind, and, in the political\naspect of the matter, changed the purpose of that thinking from the\ninterest of the few to that of the many.\"\n\n\"Our ancestors,\" said the teacher, \"seeing that this outburst of\ninvention took place under private capitalism, assumed that there must be\nsomething in that system peculiarly favorable to the genius of invention.\nHave you anything to say on that point beyond what has been said?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied the boy, \"except that by the same rule we ought to\ngive credit to the institutions of royalty, nobility, and plutocracy for\nthe democratic idea which under their fostering influence during the same\nperiod grew to flowering in the great Revolution.\"\n\n\"I think that will do on that point,\" answered the teacher. \"We will now\nask you to tell us something more particularly of this great period of\ninvention which began in the latter part of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nHAROLD STATES THE FACTS.\n\n\"From the times of antiquity up to the last quarter of the eighteenth\ncentury,\" said the lad, \"there had been almost no progress in the\nmechanical sciences save as to shipbuilding and arms. From 1780, or\nthereabouts, dates the beginning of a series of discoveries of sources of\npower, and their application by machinery to economic purposes, which,\nduring the century following, completely revolutionized the conditions of\nindustry and commerce. Steam and coal meant a multiplication of human\nenergy in the production of wealth which was almost incalculable. For\nindustrial purposes it is not too much to say that they transformed man\nfrom a pygmy to a Titan. These were, of course, only the greatest factors\nin a countless variety of discoveries by which prodigious economies of\nlabor were effected in every detail of the arts by which human life is\nmaintained and ministered to. In agriculture, where Nature, which can not\nbe too much hurried, is a large partner, and wherein, therefore, man's\npart is less controlling than in other industries, it might be expected\nthat the increase of productive energy through human invention would be\nleast. Yet here it was estimated that agricultural machinery, as most\nperfectly developed in America, had multiplied some fifteenfold the\nproduct of the individual worker. In most sorts of production less\ndirectly dependent upon Nature, invention during this period had\nmultiplied the efficiency of labor in a much greater degree, ranging from\nfifty and a hundred-fold to several thousand-fold, one man being able to\naccomplish as much as a small army in all previous ages.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" said the teacher, \"it would seem that while the needs\nof the human race had not increased, its power to supply those needs had\nbeen indefinitely multiplied. This prodigious increase in the potency of\nlabor was a clear net economic gain for the world, such as the previous\nhistory of the race furnished nothing comparable to. It was as if God had\ngiven to man his power of attorney in full, to command all the forces of\nthe universe to serve him. Now, Harold, suppose you had merely been told\nas much as you have told us concerning the hundredfold multiplication of\nthe wealth-producing power of the race which took place at this period,\nand were left, without further information, to infer for yourself how\ngreat a change for the better in the condition of mankind would naturally\nfollow, what would it seem reasonable to suppose?\"\n\n\"It would seem safe to take for granted at the least,\" replied the boy,\n\"that every form of human unhappiness or imperfection resulting directly\nor indirectly from economic want would be absolutely banished from the\nearth. That the very meaning of the word poverty would have been\nforgotten would seem to be a matter-of-course assumption to begin with.\nBeyond that we might go on and fancy almost anything in the way of\nuniversal diffusion of luxury that we pleased. The facts given as the\nbasis of the speculation would justify the wildest day-dreams of\nuniversal happiness, so far as material abundance could directly or\nindirectly minister to it.\"\n\n\"Very good, Harold. We know now what to expect when you shall go on to\ntell us what the historical facts are as to the degree of improvement in\nthe economic condition of the mass of the race, which actually did result\nfrom the great inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nTake the condition of the mass of the people in the advanced countries at\nthe close of the nineteenth century, after they had been enjoying the\nbenefits of coal and steam, and the most of the other great inventions\nfor a century, more or less, and comparing it with their condition, say,\nin 1780, give us some idea of the change for the better which had taken\nplace in their economic welfare. Doubtless it was something marvelous.\"\n\n\"It was a subject of much nice debate and close figuring,\" replied the\nboy, \"whether in the most advanced countries there had been, taking one\nclass with another, and disregarding mere changes in fashions, any real\nimprovement at all in the economic basis of the great majority of the\npeople.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that the improvement had been so small that there could\nbe a question raised whether there had been any at all?\"\n\n\"Precisely so. As to the English people in the nineteenth century,\nFlorence has given us the facts in speaking of the effects of foreign\ncommerce. The English had not only a greater foreign commerce than any\nother nation, but had also made earlier and fuller use of the great\ninventions than any other. She has told us that the sociologists of the\ntime had no difficulty in proving that the economic condition of the\nEnglish people was more wretched in the latter part of the nineteenth\ncentury than it had been centuries previous, before steam had been\nthought of, and that this was equally true of the peoples of the Low\nCountries, and the masses of Germany. As to the working masses of Italy\nand Spain, they had been in much better economic condition during periods\nof the Roman Empire than they were in the nineteenth century. If the\nFrench were a little better off in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth\ncentury, it was owing wholly to the distribution of land effected by the\nFrench Revolution, and in no way to the great inventions.\"\n\n\"How was it in the United States?\"\n\n\"If America,\" replied the lad, \"had shown a notable improvement in the\ncondition of the people, it would not be necessary to ascribe it to the\nprogress of invention, for the wonderful economic opportunities of a new\ncountry had given them a vast though necessarily temporary advantage over\nother nations. It does not appear, however, that there was any more\nagreement of testimony as to whether the condition of the masses had on\nthe whole improved in America than in the Old World. In the last decade\nof the nineteenth century, with a view to allaying the discontent of the\nwage-earners and the farmers, which was then beginning to swell to\nrevolutionary volume, agents of the United States Government published\nelaborate comparisons of wages and prices, in which they argued out a\nsmall percentage of gain on the whole in the economic condition of the\nAmerican artisans during the century. At this distance we can not, of\ncourse, criticise these calculations in detail, but we may base a\nreasonable doubt of the conclusion that the condition of the masses had\nvery greatly improved upon the existence of the popular discontent which\nthey were published in the vain hope of moderating. It seems safe to\nassume that the people were better acquainted with their own condition\nthan the sociologists, and it is certain that it was the growing\nconviction of the American masses during the closing decades of the\nnineteenth century that they were losing ground economically and in\ndanger of sinking into the degraded condition of the proletariat and\npeasantry of the ancient and contemporary European world. Against the\nlaborious tabulations of the apologists of capitalism we may adduce, as\nfar superior and more convincing evidence of the economic tendency of the\nAmerican people during the latter part of the nineteenth century, such\nsigns of the times as the growth of beggary and vagabondage to Old World\nproportions, the embittered revolts of the wage-earners which kept up a\nconstant industrial war, and finally the condition of bankruptcy into\nwhich the farming population was sinking.\"\n\n\"That will do as to that point,\" said the teacher. \"In such a comparison\nas this small margins and nice points of difference are impertinent. It\nis enough that if the indefinite multiplication of man's wealth-producing\npower by inventive progress had been developed and distributed with any\ndegree of intelligence for the general interest, poverty would have\ndisappeared and comfort if not luxury have become the universal\ncondition. This being a fact as plain and large as the sun, it is\nneedless to consider the hairsplitting debates of the economists as to\nwhether the condition of this or that class of the masses in this or that\ncountry was a grain better or two grains worse than it had been. It is\nenough for the purpose of the argument that nobody anywhere in any\ncountry pretended that there had been an improvement noticeable enough to\nmake even a beginning toward that complete transformation in the human\ncondition for the better, of which the great inventions by universal\nadmission had contained the full and immediate promise and potency.\n\n\"And now tell us, Harold, what our ancestors had to say as to this\nastonishing fact--a fact more marvelous than the great inventions\nthemselves, namely, their failure to prove of any considerable benefit to\nmankind. Surely a phenomenon at once so amazing in itself and involving\nso prodigious a defeat to the hopes of human happiness must have set a\nworld of rational beings to speculating in a very impassioned way as to\nwhat the explanation might be. One would suppose that the facts of this\nfailure with which our ancestors were confronted would have been enough\nto convince them that there must be something radically and horribly\nwrong about any economic system which was responsible for it or had\npermitted it, and that no further argument would have been wanted to\ninduce them to make a radical change in it.\"\n\n\"One would think so, certainly,\" said the boy, \"but it did not seem to\noccur to our great-grandfathers to hold their economic system to any\nresponsibility for the result. As we have seen, they recognized, however\nthey might dispute as to percentages, that the great inventions had\nfailed to make any notable improvement in the human condition, but they\nnever seemed to get so far as to inquire seriously why this was so. In\nthe voluminous works of the economists of the period we find no\ndiscussions, much less any attempt to explain, a fact which to our view\nabsolutely overshadows all the other features of the economic situation\nbefore the Revolution. And the strangest thing about it all is that their\nfailure to derive any benefit worth speaking of from the progress of\ninvention in no way seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of our ancestors\nabout the inventions. They seemed fairly intoxicated with the pride of\ntheir achievements, barren of benefit as they had been, and their day\ndreams were of further discoveries that to a yet more amazing degree\nshould put the forces of the universe at their disposal. None of them\napparently paused to reflect that though God might empty his treasure\nhouse for their benefit of its every secret of use and of power, the race\nwould not be a whit the better off for it unless they devised some\neconomic machinery by which these discoveries might be made to serve the\ngeneral welfare more effectually than they had done before. They do not\nseem to have realized that so long as poverty remained, every new\ninvention which multiplied the power of wealth production was but one\nmore charge in the indictment against their economic system as guilty of\nan imbecility as great as its iniquity. They appear to have wholly\noverlooked the fact that until their mighty engines should be devoted to\nincreasing human welfare they were and would continue mere curious\nscientific toys of no more real worth or utility to the race than so many\nparticularly ingenious jumping-jacks. This craze for more and more and\never greater and wider inventions for economic purposes, coupled with\napparent complete indifference as to whether mankind derived any ultimate\nbenefit from them or not, can only be understood by regarding it as one\nof those strange epidemics of insane excitement which have been known to\naffect whole populations at certain periods, especially of the middle\nages. Rational explanation it has none.\"\n\n\"You may well say so,\" exclaimed the teacher. \"Of what use indeed was it\nthat coal had been discovered, when there were still as many fireless\nhomes as ever? Of what use was the machinery by which one man could weave\nas much cloth as a thousand a century before when there were as many\nragged, shivering human beings as ever? Of what use was the machinery by\nwhich the American farmer could produce a dozen times as much food as his\ngrandfather when there were more cases of starvation and a larger\nproportion of half-fed and badly fed people in the country than ever\nbefore, and hordes of homeless, desperate vagabonds traversed the land,\nbegging for bread at every door? They had invented steamships, these\nancestors of ours, that were miracles, but their main business was\ntransporting paupers from lands where they had been beggared in spite of\nlabor-saving machinery to newer lands where, after a short space, they\nwould inevitably be beggared again. About the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury the world went wild over the invention of the sewing-machine and\nthe burden it was to lift from the shoulders of the race. Yet, fifty\nyears after, the business of garment-making, which it had been expected\nto revolutionize for the better, had become a slavery both in America and\nEurope which, under the name of the 'sweating system,' scandalized even\nthat tough generation. They had lucifer matches instead of flint and\nsteel, kerosene and electricity instead of candles and whale-oil, but the\nspectacles of squalor, misery, and degradation upon which the improved\nlight shone were the same and only looked the worse for it. What few\nbeggars there had been in America in the first quarter of the nineteenth\ncentury went afoot, while in the last quarter they stole their\ntransportation on trains drawn by steam engines, but there were fifty\ntimes as many beggars. The world traveled sixty miles an hour instead of\nfive or ten at the beginning of the century, but it had not gained an\ninch on poverty, which clung to it as the shadow to the racer.\"\n\nHELEN GIVES THE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS.\n\n\"Now, Helen,\" pursued the teacher, \"we want you to explain the facts that\nHarold has so clearly brought out. We want you to tell us why it was that\nthe economic condition of humanity derived but a barely perceptible\nadvantage at most, if indeed any at all, from an inventive progress which\nby its indefinite multiplication of productive energy should by every\nrule of reason have completely transformed for the better the economic\ncondition of the race and wholly banished want from earth. What was there\nabout the old system of private capitalism to account for a _fiasco_\nso tremendous?\"\n\n\"It was the operation of the profit principle,\" replied the girl Helen.\n\n\"Please proceed with the explanation.\"\n\n\"The great economic inventions which Harold has been talking about,\" said\nthe girl, \"were of the class of what were called labor-saving machines\nand devices--that is to say, they enabled one man to produce more than\nbefore with the same labor, or to produce the same as before with less\nlabor. Under a collective administration of industry in the equal general\ninterest like ours, the effect of any such invention would be to increase\nthe total output to be shared equally among all, or, if the people\npreferred and so voted, the output would remain what it was, and the\nsaving of labor be appropriated as a dividend of leisure to be equally\nenjoyed by all. But under the old system there was, of course, no\ncollective administration. Capitalists were the administrators, being the\nonly persons who were able to carry on extensive operations or take the\ninitiative in economic enterprises, and in what they did or did not do\nthey had no regard to the public interest or the general gain, but to\ntheir own profit only. The only motive which could induce a capitalist to\nadopt an invention was the idea of increasing his profits either by\ngetting a larger product at the same labor cost, or else getting the same\nproduct at a reduced labor cost. We will take the first case. Suppose a\ncapitalist in adopting labor-saving machinery calculated to keep all his\nformer employees and make his profit by getting a larger product with the\nsame labor cost. Now, when a capitalist proposed to increase his output\nwithout the aid of a machine he had to hire more workers, who must be\npaid wages to be afterward expended in purchasing products in the market.\nIn this case, for every increase of product there was some increase,\nalthough not at all an equal one, in the buying power of the community.\nBut when the capitalist increased his output by the aid of machinery,\nwith no increase in the number of workers employed, there was no\ncorresponding increase of purchasing power on the part of the community\nto set off against the increased product. A certain amount of purchasing\npower went, indeed, in wages to the mechanics who constructed the\nlabor-saving machines, but it was small in comparison with the increase\nin the output which the capitalist expected to make by means of the\nmachinery, otherwise it would have been no object to him to buy the\nmachine. The increased product would therefore tend directly to glut yet\nmore the always glutted market; and if any considerable number of\ncapitalists should introduce machinery in the same way, the glut would\nbecome intensified into a crisis and general stoppage of production.\n\n\"In order to avert or minimize such a disaster, the capitalists could\ntake one or two courses. They could, if they chose, reduce the price of\ntheir increased machine product so that the purchasing power of the\ncommunity, which had remained stationary, could take it up at least as\nnearly as it had taken up the lesser quantity of higher-priced product\nbefore the machinery was introduced. But if the capitalists did this,\nthey would derive no additional profit whatever from the adoption of the\nmachinery, the whole benefit going to the community. It is scarcely\nnecessary to say that this was not what the capitalists were in business\nfor. The other course before them was to keep their product where it was\nbefore introducing the machine, and to realize their profit by\ndischarging the workers, thus saving on the labor cost of the output.\nThis was the course most commonly taken, because the glut of goods was\ngenerally so threatening that, except when inventions opened up wholly\nnew fields, capitalists were careful not greatly to increase outputs. For\nexample, if the machine enabled one man to do two men's work, the\ncapitalist would discharge half of his force, put the saving in labor\ncost in his pocket, and still produce as many goods as ever. Moreover,\nthere was another advantage about this plan. The discharged workers\nswelled the numbers of the unemployed, who were underbidding one another\nfor the opportunity to work. The increased desperation of this\ncompetition made it possible presently for the capitalist to reduce the\nwages of the half of his former force which he still retained. That was\nthe usual result of the introduction of labor-saving machinery: First,\nthe discharge of workers, then, after more or less time, reduced wages\nfor those who were retained.\"\n\n\"If I understand you, then,\" said the teacher, \"the effect of\nlabor-saving inventions was either to increase the product without any\ncorresponding increase in the purchasing power of the community, thereby\naggravating the glut of goods, or else to positively decrease the\npurchasing power of the community, through discharges and wage\nreductions, while the product remained the same as before. That is to\nsay, the net result of labor-saving machinery was to increase the\ndifference between the production and consumption of the community which\nremained in the hands of the capitalists as profit.\"\n\n\"Precisely so. The only motive of the capitalist in introducing\nlabor-saving machinery was to retain as profit a larger share of the\nproduct than before by cutting down the share of labor--that is to say,\nlabor-saving machinery which should have banished poverty from the world\nbecame the means under the profit system of impoverishing the masses more\nrapidly than ever.\"\n\n\"But did not the competition among the capitalists compel them to\nsacrifice a part of these increased profits in reductions of prices in\norder to get rid of their goods?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly; but such reductions in price would not increase the\nconsuming power of the people except when taken out of profits, and, as\nJohn explained to us this morning, when capitalists were forced by\ncompetition to reduce their prices they saved their profits as long as\npossible by making up for the reductions in price by debasing the quality\nof the goods or cutting down wages until the public and the wage-earners\ncould be cheated and squeezed no longer. Then only did they begin to\nsacrifice profits, and it was then too late for the impoverished\nconsumers to respond by increasing consumption. It was always, as John\ntold us, in the countries where the people were poorest that the prices\nwere lowest, but without benefit to the people.\"\n\nTHE AMERICAN FARMER AND MACHINERY.\n\n\"And now,\" said the teacher, \"I want to ask you something about the\neffect of labor-saving inventions upon a class of so-called capitalists\nwho made up the greater half of the American people--I mean the farmers.\nIn so far as they owned their farms and tools, however encumbered by\ndebts and mortgages, they were technically capitalists, although\nthemselves quite as pitiable victims of the capitalists as were the\nproletarian artisans. The agricultural labor-saving inventions of the\nnineteenth century in America were something simply marvelous, enabling,\nas we have been told, one man to do the work of fifteen a century before.\nNevertheless, the American farmer was going straight to the dogs all the\nwhile these inventions were being introduced. Now, how do you account for\nthat? Why did not the farmer, as a sort of capitalist, pile up his\nprofits on labor-saving machinery like the other capitalists?\"\n\n\"As I have said,\" replied the girl, \"the profits made by labor-saving\nmachinery resulted from the increased productiveness of the labor\nemployed, thus enabling the capitalist either to turn out a greater\nproduct with the same labor cost or an equal product with a less labor\ncost, the workers supplanted by the machine being discharged. The amount\nof profits made was therefore dependent on the scale of the business\ncarried on--that is, the number of workers employed and the consequent\nfigure which labor cost made in the business. When farming was carried on\nupon a very large scale, as were the so-called bonanza farms in the\nUnited States of that period, consisting of twenty to thirty thousand\nacres of land, the capitalists conducting them did for a time make great\nprofits, which were directly owing to the labor-saving agricultural\nmachines, and would have been impossible without them. These machines\nenabled them to put a greatly increased product on the market with small\nincrease of labor cost or else the same product at a great decrease of\nlabor cost. But the mass of the American farmers operated on a small\nscale only and employed very little labor, doing largely their own work.\nThey could therefore make little profit, if any, out of labor-saving\nmachinery by discharging employees. The only way they could utilize it\nwas not by cutting down the expense of their output but by increasing the\namount of the output through the increased efficiency of their own labor.\nBut seeing that there had been no increase meanwhile in the purchasing\npower of the community at large, there was no more money demand for their\nproducts than before, and consequently if the general body of farmers\nthrough labor-saving machinery increased their output, they could dispose\nof the greater aggregate only at a reduced price, so that in the end they\nwould get no more for the greater output than for the less. Indeed, they\nwould not get so much, for the effect of even a small surplus when held\nby weak capitalists who could not keep it back, but must press for sale,\nhad an effect to reduce the market price quite out of proportion to the\namount of the surplus. In the United States the mass of these small\nfarmers was so great and their pressure to sell so desperate that in the\nlatter part of the century they destroyed the market not only for\nthemselves but finally even for the great capitalists who conducted the\ngreat farms.\"\n\n\"The conclusion is, then, Helen,\" said the teacher, \"that the net effect\nof labor-saving machinery upon the mass of small farmers in the United\nStates was ruinous.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied the girl. \"This is a case in which the historical\nfacts absolutely confirm the rational theory. Thanks to the profit\nsystem, inventions which multiplied the productive power of the farmer\nfifteenfold made a bankrupt of him, and so long as the profit system was\nretained there was no help for him.\"\n\n\"Were farmers the only class of small capitalists who were injured rather\nthan helped by labor-saving machinery?\"\n\n\"The rule was the same for all small capitalists whatever business they\nwere engaged in. Its basis, as I have said, was the fact that the\nadvantage to be gained by the capitalists from introducing labor-saving\nmachinery was in proportion to the amount of labor which the machinery\nenabled them to dispense with--that is to say, was dependent upon the\nscale of their business. If the scale of the capitalist's operations was\nso small that he could not make a large saving in reduced labor cost by\nintroducing machinery, then the introduction of such machinery put him at\na crushing disadvantage as compared with larger capitalists. Labor-saving\nmachinery was in this way one of the most potent of the influences which\ntoward the close of the nineteenth century made it impossible for the\nsmall capitalists in any field to compete with the great ones, and helped\nto concentrate the economic dominion of the world in few and ever fewer\nhands.\"\n\n\"Suppose, Helen, that the Revolution had not come, that labor-saving\nmachinery had continued to be invented as fast as ever, and that the\nconsolidation of the great capitalists' interests, already foreshadowed,\nhad been completed, so that the waste of profits in competition among\nthemselves had ceased, what would have been the result?\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied the girl, \"all the wealth that had been wasted in\ncommercial rivalry would have been expended in luxury in addition to what\nhad been formerly so expended. The new machinery year by year would have\ngone on making it possible for a smaller and ever smaller fraction of the\npopulation to produce all the necessaries for the support of mankind, and\nthe rest of the world, including the great mass of the workers, would\nhave found employment in unproductive labor to provide the materials of\nluxury for the rich or in personal services to them. The world would thus\ncome to be divided into three classes: a master caste, very limited in\nnumbers; a vast body of unproductive workers employed in ministering to\nthe luxury and pomp of the master caste; and a small body of strictly\nproductive workers, which, owing to the perfection of machinery, would be\nable to provide for the needs of all. It is needless to say that all save\nthe masters would be at the minimum point as to means of subsistence.\nDecaying empires in ancient times have often presented such spectacles of\nimperial and aristocratic splendor, to the supply and maintenance of\nwhich the labor of starving nations was devoted. But no such spectacle\never presented in the past would have been comparable to that which the\ntwentieth century would have witnessed if the great Revolution had\npermitted private capitalism to complete its evolution. In former ages\nthe great mass of the population has been necessarily employed in\nproductive labor to supply the needs of the world, so that the portion of\nthe working force available for the service of the pomp and pleasures of\nthe masters as unproductive laborers has always been relatively small.\nBut in the plutocratic empire we are imagining, the genius of invention,\nthrough labor-saving machinery, would have enabled the masters to devote\na greater proportion of the subject population to the direct service of\ntheir state and luxury than had been possible under any of the historic\ndespotisms. The abhorrent spectacles of men enthroned as gods above\nabject and worshiping masses, which Assyria, Egypt, Persia, and Rome\nexhibited in their day, would have been eclipsed.\"\n\n\"That will do, Helen,\" said the teacher. \"With your testimony we will\nwind up our review of the economic system of private capitalism which the\ngreat Revolution abolished forever. There are of course a multitude of\nother aspects and branches of the subject which we might take up, but the\nstudy would be as unprofitable as depressing. We have, I think, covered\nthe essential points. If you understand why and how profits, rent, and\ninterest operated to limit the consuming power of most of the community\nto a fractional part of its productive power, thereby in turn\ncorrespondingly crippling the latter, you have the open secret of the\npoverty of the world before the Revolution, and of the impossibility of\nany important or lasting improvement from any source whatever in the\neconomic circumstances of mankind, until and unless private capitalism,\nof which the profit system with rent and interest were necessary and\ninseparable parts, should be put an end to.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nI RECEIVE AN OVATION.\n\n\"And now,\" the teacher went on, glancing at the gallery where the doctor\nand I had been sitting unseen, \"I have a great surprise for you. Among\nthose who have listened to your recitation to-day, both in the forenoon\nand afternoon, has been a certain personage whose identity you ought to\nbe able to infer when I say that, of all persons now on earth, he is\nabsolutely the one best able, and the only one fully able, to judge how\naccurate your portrayal of nineteenth-century conditions has been. Lest\nthe knowledge should disturb your equanimity, I have refrained from\ntelling you, until the present moment, that we have present with us this\nafternoon a no less distinguished visitor than Julian West, and that with\ngreat kindness he has consented to permit me to present you to him.\"\n\nI had assented, rather reluctantly, to the teacher's request, not being\ndesirous of exposing myself unnecessarily to curious staring. But I had\nyet to make the acquaintance of twentieth-century boys and girls. When\nthey came around me it was easy to see in the wistful eyes of the girls\nand the moved faces of the boys how deeply their imaginations were\nstirred by the suggestions of my presence among them, and how far their\nsentiment was from one of common or frivolous curiosity. The interest\nthey showed in me was so wholly and delicately sympathetic that it could\nnot have offended the most sensitive temperament.\n\nThis had indeed been the attitude of all the persons of mature years whom\nI had met, but I had scarcely expected the same considerateness from\nschool children. I had not, it seemed, sufficiently allowed for the\ninfluence upon manners of the atmosphere of refinement which surrounds\nthe child of to-day from the cradle. These young people had never seen\ncoarseness, rudeness, or brusqueness on the part of any one. Their\nconfidence had never been abused, their sympathy wounded, or their\nsuspicion excited. Having never imagined such a thing as a person\nsocially superior or inferior to themselves, they had never learned but\none sort of manners. Having never had any occasion to create a false or\ndeceitful impression or to accomplish anything by indirection, it was\nnatural that they should not know what affectation was.\n\nTruly, it is these secondary consequences, these moral and social\nreactions of economic equality to create a noble atmosphere of human\nintercourse, that, after all, have been the greatest contribution which\nthe principle has made to human happiness.\n\nAt once I found myself talking and jesting with the young people as\neasily as if I had always known them, and what with their interest in\nwhat I told them of the old-time schools, and my delight in their naive\ncomments, an hour slipped away unnoticed. Youth is always inspiring, and\nthe atmosphere of these fresh, beautiful, ingenuous lives was like a wine\nbath.\n\nFlorence! Esther! Helen! Marion! Margaret! George! Robert! Harold!\nPaul!--Never shall I forget that group of star-eyed girls and splendid\nlads, in whom I first made acquaintance with the boys and girls of the\ntwentieth century. Can it be that God sends sweeter souls to earth now\nthat the world is so much fitter for them?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nWHAT UNIVERSAL CULTURE MEANS.\n\nIt was one of those Indian summer afternoons when it seems sinful waste\nof opportunity to spend a needless hour within. Being in no sort of\nhurry, the doctor and I chartered a motor-carriage for two at the next\nstation, and set forth in the general direction of home, indulging\nourselves in as many deviations from the route as pleased our fancy.\nPresently, as we rolled noiselessly over the smooth streets, leaf-strewn\nfrom the bordering colonnades of trees, I began to exclaim about the\nprecocity of school children who at the age of thirteen or fourteen were\nable to handle themes usually reserved in my day for the college and\nuniversity. This, however, the doctor made light of.\n\n\"Political economy,\" he said, \"from the time the world adopted the plan\nof equal sharing of labor and its results, became a science so simple\nthat any child who knows the proper way to divide an apple with his\nlittle brothers has mastered the secret of it. Of course, to point out\nthe fallacies of a false political economy is a very simple matter also,\nwhen one has only to compare it with the true one.\n\n\"As to intellectual precocity in general,\" pursued the doctor, \"I do not\nthink it is particularly noticeable in our children as compared with\nthose of your day. We certainly make no effort to develop it. A bright\nschool child of twelve in the nineteenth century would probably not\ncompare badly as to acquirements with the average twelve-year-old in our\nschools. It would be as you compared them ten years later that the\ndifference in the educational systems would show its effect. At\ntwenty-one or twenty-two the average youth would probably in your day\nhave been little more advanced in education than at fourteen, having\nprobably left school for the factory or farm at about that age or a\ncouple of years later unless perhaps he happened to be one of the\nchildren of the rich minority. The corresponding child under our system\nwould have continued his or her education without break, and at\ntwenty-one have acquired what you used to call a college education.\"\n\n\"The extension of the educational machinery necessary to provide the\nhigher education for all must have been enormous,\" I said. \"Our\nprimary-school system provided the rudiments for nearly all children, but\nnot one in twenty went as far as the grammar school, not one in a hundred\nas far as the high school, and not one in a thousand ever saw a college.\nThe great universities of my day--Harvard, Yale, and the rest--must have\nbecome small cities in order to receive the students flocking to them.\"\n\n\"They would need to be very large cities certainly,\" replied the doctor,\n\"if it were a question of their undertaking the higher education of our\nyouth, for every year we graduate not the thousands or tens of thousands\nthat made up your annual grist of college graduates, but millions. For\nthat very reason--that is, the numbers to be dealt with--we can have no\ncenters of the higher education any more than you had of the primary\neducation. Every community has its university just as formerly its common\nschools, and has in it more students from the vicinage than one of your\ngreat universities could collect with its drag net from the ends of the\nearth.\"\n\n\"But does not the reputation of particular teachers attract students to\nspecial universities?\"\n\n\"That is a matter easily provided for,\" replied the doctor. \"The\nperfection of our telephone and electroscope systems makes it possible to\nenjoy at any distance the instruction of any teacher. One of much\npopularity lectures to a million pupils in a whisper, if he happens to be\nhoarse, much easier than one of your professors could talk to a class of\nfifty when in good voice.\"\n\n\"Really, doctor,\" said I, \"there is no fact about your civilization that\nseems to open so many vistas of possibility and solve beforehand so many\npossible difficulties in the arrangement and operation of your social\nsystem as this universality of culture. I am bound to say that nothing\nthat is rational seems impossible in the way of social adjustments when\nonce you assume the existence of that condition. My own contemporaries\nfully recognized in theory, as you know, the importance of popular\neducation to secure good government in a democracy; but our system, which\nbarely at best taught the masses to spell, was a farce indeed compared\nwith the popular education of to-day.\"\n\n\"Necessarily so,\" replied the doctor. \"The basis of education is\neconomic, requiring as it does the maintenance of the pupil without\neconomic return during the educational period. If the education is to\namount to anything, that period must cover the years of childhood and\nadolescence to the age of at least twenty. That involves a very large\nexpenditure, which not one parent in a thousand was able to support in\nyour day. The state might have assumed it, of course, but that would have\namounted to the rich supporting the children of the poor, and naturally\nthey would not hear to that, at least beyond the primary grades of\neducation. And even if there had been no money question, the rich, if\nthey hoped to retain their power, would have been crazy to provide for\nthe masses destined to do their dirty work--a culture which would have\nmade them social rebels. For these two reasons your economic system was\nincompatible with any popular education worthy of the name. On the other\nhand, the first effect of economic equality was to provide equal\neducational advantages for all and the best the community could afford.\nOne of the most interesting chapters in the history of the Revolution is\nthat which tells how at once after the new order was established the\nyoung men and women under twenty-one years of age who had been working in\nfields or factories, perhaps since childhood, left their work and poured\nback into the schools and colleges as fast as room could be made for\nthem, so that they might as far as possible repair their early loss. All\nalike recognized, now that education had been made economically possible\nfor all, that it was the greatest boon the new order had brought. It\nrecorded also in the books that not only the youth, but the men and\nwomen, and even the elderly who had been without educational advantages,\ndevoted all the leisure left from their industrial duties to making up,\nso far as possible, for their lack of earlier advantages, that they might\nnot be too much ashamed in the presence of a rising generation to be\ncomposed altogether of college graduates.\n\n\"In speaking of our educational system as it is at present,\" the doctor\nwent on, \"I should guard you against the possible mistake of supposing\nthat the course which ends at twenty-one completes the educational\ncurriculum of the average individual. On the contrary, it is only the\nrequired minimum of culture which society insists that all youth shall\nreceive during their minority to make them barely fit for citizenship. We\nshould consider it a very meager education indeed that ended there. As we\nlook at it, the graduation from the schools at the attainment of majority\nmeans merely that the graduate has reached an age at which he can be\npresumed to be competent and has the right as an adult to carry on his\nfurther education without the guidance or compulsion of the state. To\nprovide means for this end the nation maintains a vast system of what you\nwould call elective post-graduate courses of study in every branch of\nscience, and these are open freely to every one to the end of life to be\npursued as long or as briefly, as constantly or as intermittently, as\nprofoundly or superficially, as desired.\n\n\"The mind is really not fit for many most important branches of\nknowledge, the taste for them does not awake, and the intellect is not\nable to grasp them, until mature life, when a month of application will\ngive a comprehension of a subject which years would have been wasted in\ntrying to impart to a youth. It is our idea, so far as possible, to\npostpone the serious study of such branches to the post-graduate schools.\nYoung people must get a smattering of things in general, but really\ntheirs is not the time of life for ardent and effective study. If you\nwould see enthusiastic students to whom the pursuit of knowledge is the\ngreatest joy of life you must seek them among the middle-aged fathers and\nmothers in the post-graduate schools.\n\n\"For the proper use of these opportunities for the lifelong pursuit of\nknowledge we find the leisure of our lives, which seems to you so ample,\nall too small. And yet that leisure, vast as it is, with half of every\nday and half of every year and the whole latter half of life sacred to\npersonal uses--even the aggregate of these great spaces, growing greater\nwith every labor-saving invention, which are reserved for the higher uses\nof life, would seem to us of little value for intellectual culture, but\nfor a condition commanded by almost none in your day but secured to all\nby our institutions. I mean the moral atmosphere of serenity resulting\nfrom an absolute freedom of mind from disturbing anxieties and carking\ncares concerning our material welfare or that of those dear to us. Our\neconomic system puts us in a position where we can follow Christ's maxim,\nso impossible for you, to 'take no thought for the morrow.' You must not\nunderstand, of course, that all our people are students or philosophers,\nbut you may understand that we are more or less assiduous and systematic\nstudents and school-goers all our lives.\"\n\n\"Really, doctor,\" I said, \"I do not remember that you have ever told me\nanything that has suggested a more complete and striking contrast between\nyour age and mine than this about the persistent and growing development\nof the purely intellectual interests through life. In my day there was,\nafter all, only six or eight years' difference in the duration of the\nintellectual life of the poor man's son drafted into the factory at\nfourteen and the more fortunate youth's who went to college. If that of\nthe one stopped at fourteen, that of the other ceased about as completely\nat twenty-one or twenty-two. Instead of being in a position to begin his\nreal education on graduating from college, that event meant the close of\nit for the average student, and was the high-water mark of his life, so\nfar as concerned the culture and knowledge of the sciences and\nhumanities. In these respects the average college man never afterward\nknew so much as on his graduation day. For immediately thereafter, unless\nof the richest class, he must needs plunge into the turmoil and strife of\nbusiness life and engage in the struggle for the material means of\nexistence. Whether he failed or succeeded, made little difference as to\nthe effect to stunt and wither his intellectual life. He had no time and\ncould command no thought for anything else. If he failed, or barely\navoided failure, perpetual anxiety ate out his heart; and if he\nsucceeded, his success usually made him a grosser and more hopelessly\nself-satisfied materialist than if he had failed. There was no hope for\nhis mind or soul either way. If at the end of life his efforts had won\nhim a little breathing space, it could be of no high use to him, for the\nspiritual and intellectual parts had become atrophied from disuse, and\nwere no longer capable of responding to opportunity.\n\n\"And this apology for an existence,\" said the doctor, \"was the life of\nthose whom you counted most fortunate and most successful--of those who\nwere reckoned to have won the prizes of life. Can you be surprised that\nwe look back to the great Revolution as a sort of second creation of man,\ninasmuch as it added the conditions of an adequate mind and soul life to\nthe bare physical existence under more or less agreeable conditions,\nwhich was about all the life the most of human being's, rich or poor, had\nup to that time known? The effect of the struggle for existence in\narresting, with its engrossments, the intellectual development at the\nvery threshold of adult life would have been disastrous enough had the\ncharacter of the struggle been morally unobjectionable. It is when we\ncome to consider that the struggle was one which not only prevented\nmental culture, but was utterly withering to the moral life, that we\nfully realize the unfortunate condition of the race before the\nRevolution. Youth is visited with noble aspirations and high dreams of\nduty and perfection. It sees the world as it should be, not as it is; and\nit is well for the race if the institutions of society are such as do not\noffend these moral enthusiasms, but rather tend to conserve and develop\nthem through life. This, I think, we may fully claim the modern social\norder does. Thanks to an economic system which illustrates the highest\nethical idea in all its workings, the youth going forth into the world\nfinds it a practice school for all the moralities. He finds full room and\nscope in its duties and occupations for every generous enthusiasm, every\nunselfish aspiration he ever cherished. He can not possibly have formed a\nmoral idea higher or completer than that which dominates our industrial\nand commercial order.\n\n\"Youth was as noble in your day as now, and dreamed the same great dreams\nof life's possibilities. But when the young man went forth into the world\nof practical life it was to find his dreams mocked and his ideals derided\nat every turn. He found himself compelled, whether he would or not, to\ntake part in a fight for life, in which the first condition of success\nwas to put his ethics on the shelf and cut the acquaintance of his\nconscience. You had various terms with which to describe the process\nwhereby the young man, reluctantly laying aside his ideals, accepted the\nconditions of the sordid struggle. You described it as a 'learning to\ntake the world as it is,' 'getting over romantic notions,' 'becoming\npractical,' and all that. In fact, it was nothing more nor less than the\ndebauching of a soul. Is that too much to say?\n\n\"It is no more than the truth, and we all knew it,\" I answered.\n\n\"Thank God, that day is over forever! The father need now no longer\ninstruct the son in cynicism lest he should fail in life, nor the mother\nher daughter in worldly wisdom as a protection from generous instinct.\nThe parents are worthy of their children and fit to associate with them,\nas it seems to us they were not and could not be in your day. Life is all\nthe way through as spacious and noble as it seems to the ardent child\nstanding on the threshold. The ideals of perfection, the enthusiasms of\nself-devotion, honor, love, and duty, which thrill the boy and girl, no\nlonger yield with advancing years to baser motives, but continue to\nanimate life to the end. You remember what Wordsworth said:\n\n  \"Heaven lies about us in our infancy.\n  Shades of the prison house begin to close\n  Upon the growing boy.\n\nI think if he were a partaker of our life he would not have been moved to\nextol childhood at the expense of maturity, for life grows ever wider and\nhigher to the last.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\"NEITHER IN THIS MOUNTAIN NOR AT JERUSALEM.\"\n\nThe next morning, it being again necessary for Edith to report at her\npost of duty, I accompanied her to the railway station. While we stood\nwaiting for the train my attention was drawn to a distinguished-looking\nman who alighted from an incoming car. He appeared by nineteenth-century\nstandards about sixty years old, and was therefore presumably eighty or\nninety, that being about the rate of allowance I have found it necessary\nto make in estimating the ages of my new contemporaries, owing to the\nslower advent of signs of age in these times. On speaking to Edith of\nthis person I was much interested when she informed me that he was no\nother than Mr. Barton, whose sermon by telephone had so impressed me on\nthe first Sunday of my new life, as set forth in Looking Backward. Edith\nhad just time to introduce me before taking the train.\n\nAs we left the station together I said to my companion that if he would\nexcuse the inquiry I should be interested to know what particular sect or\nreligious body he represented.\n\n\"My dear Mr. West,\" was the reply, \"your question suggests that my friend\nDr. Leete has not probably said much to you about the modern way of\nregarding religious matters.\"\n\n\"Our conversation has turned but little on that subject,\" I answered,\n\"but it will not surprise me to learn that your ideas and practices are\nquite different from those of my day. Indeed, religious ideas and\necclesiastical institutions were already at that time undergoing such\nrapid and radical decomposition that it was safe to predict if religion\nwere to survive another century it would be under very different forms\nfrom any the past had known.\"\n\n\"You have suggested a topic,\" said my companion, \"of the greatest\npossible interest to me. If you have nothing else to do, and would like\nto talk a little about it, nothing would give me more pleasure.\"\n\nUpon receiving the assurance that I had absolutely no occupation except\nto pick up information about the twentieth century, Mr. Barton said:\n\n\"Let us then go into this old church, which you will no doubt have\nalready recognized as a relic of your time. There we can sit comfortably\nwhile we talk, amid surroundings well fitted to our theme.\"\n\nI then perceived that we stood before one of the last-century church\nbuildings which have been preserved as historical monuments, and,\nmoreover, as it oddly enough fell out, that this particular church was no\nother than the one my family had always attended, and I as well--that is,\nwhenever I attended any church, which was not often.\n\n\"What an extraordinary coincidence!\" exclaimed Mr. Barton, when I told\nhim this; \"who would have expected it? Naturally, when you revisit a spot\nso fraught with affecting associations, you will wish to be alone. You\nmust pardon my involuntary indiscretion in proposing to turn in here.\"\n\n\"Really,\" I replied, \"the coincidence is interesting merely, not at all\naffecting. Young men of my day did not, as a rule, take their church\nrelations very seriously. I shall be interested to see how the old place\nlooks. Let us go in, by all means.\"\n\nThe interior proved to be quite unchanged in essential particulars since\nthe last time I had been within its walls, more than a century before.\nThat last occasion, I well remembered, had been an Easter service, to\nwhich I had escorted some pretty country cousins who wanted to hear the\nmusic and see the flowers. No doubt the processes of decay had rendered\nnecessary many restorations, but they had been carried out so as to\npreserve completely the original effects.\n\nLeading the way down the main aisle, I paused in front of the family pew.\n\n\"This, Mr. Barton,\" I said, \"is, or was, my pew. It is true that I am a\nlittle in arrears on pew rent, but I think I may venture to invite you to\nsit with me.\"\n\nI had truly told Mr. Barton that there was very little sentiment\nconnected with such church relations as I had maintained. They were\nindeed merely a matter of family tradition and social propriety. But in\nanother way I found myself not a little moved, as, dropping into my\naccustomed place at the head of the pew, I looked about the dim and\nsilent interior. As my eye roved from pew to pew, my imagination called\nback to life the men and women, the young men and maidens, who had been\nwont of a Sunday, a hundred years before, to sit in those places. As I\nrecalled their various activities, ambitions, hopes, fears, envies, and\nintrigues, all dominated, as they had been, by the idea of money\npossessed, lost, or lusted after, I was impressed not so much with the\npersonal death which had come to these my old acquaintances as by the\nthought of the completeness with which the whole social scheme in which\nthey had lived and moved and had their being had passed away. Not only\nwere they gone, but their world was gone, and its place knew it no more.\nHow strange, how artificial, how grotesque that world had been!--and yet\nto them and to me, while I was one of them, it had seemed the only\npossible mode of existence.\n\nMr. Barton, with delicate respect for my absorption, waited for me to\nbreak the silence.\n\n\"No doubt,\" I said, \"since you preserve our churches as curiosities, you\nmust have better ones of your own for use?\"\n\n\"In point of fact,\" my companion replied, \"we have little or no use for\nchurches at all.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! I had forgotten for the moment that it was by telephone I heard\nyour sermon. The telephone, in its present perfection, must indeed have\nquite dispensed with the necessity of the church as an audience room.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" replied Mr. Barton, \"when we assemble now we need no\nlonger bring our bodies with us. It is a curious paradox that while the\ntelephone and electroscope, by abolishing distance as a hindrance to\nsight and hearing, have brought mankind into a closeness of sympathetic\nand intellectual rapport never before imagined, they have at the same\ntime enabled individuals, although keeping in closest touch with\neverything going on in the world, to enjoy, if they choose, a physical\nprivacy, such as one had to be a hermit to command in your day. Our\nadvantages in this respect have so far spoiled us that being in a crowd,\nwhich was the matter-of-course penalty you had to pay for seeing or\nhearing anything interesting, would seem too dear a price to pay for\nalmost any enjoyment.\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" I said, \"that ecclesiastical institutions must have been\naffected in other ways besides the disuse of church buildings, by the\ngeneral adaptation of the telephone system to religious teaching. In my\nday, the fact that no speaker could reach by voice more than a small\ngroup of hearers made it necessary to have a veritable army of\npreachers--some fifty thousand, say, in the United States alone--in order\nto instruct the population. Of these, not one in many hundreds was a\nperson who had anything to utter really worth hearing. For example, we\nwill say that fifty thousand clergymen preached every Sunday as many\nsermons to as many congregations. Four fifths of these sermons were poor,\nhalf of the rest perhaps fair, some of the others good, and a few score,\npossibly, out of the whole really of a fine class. Now, nobody, of\ncourse, would hear a poor discourse on any subject when he could just as\neasily hear a fine one, and if we had perfected the telephone system to\nthe point you have, the result would have been, the first Sunday after\nits introduction, that everybody who wanted to hear a sermon would have\nconnected with the lecture rooms or churches of the few widely celebrated\npreachers, and the rest would have had no hearers at all, and presently\nhave been obliged to seek new occupations.\"\n\nMr. Barton was amused. \"You have, in fact, hit,\" he said, \"upon the\nmechanical side of one of the most important contrasts between your times\nand ours--namely, the modern suppression of mediocrity in teaching,\nwhether intellectual or religious. Being able to pick from the choicest\nintellects, and most inspired moralists and seers of the generation,\neverybody of course agrees in regarding it a waste of time to listen to\nany who have less weighty messages to deliver. When you consider that all\nare thus able to obtain the best inspiration the greatest minds can give,\nand couple this with the fact that, thanks to the universality of the\nhigher education, all are at least pretty good judges of what is best,\nyou have the secret of what might be called at once the strongest\nsafeguard of the degree of civilization we have attained, and the surest\npledge of the highest possible rate of progress toward ever better\nconditions--namely, the leadership of moral and intellectual genius. To\none like you, educated according to the ideas of the nineteenth century\nas to what democracy meant, it may seem like a paradox that the\nequalizing of economic and educational conditions, which has perfected\ndemocracy, should have resulted in the most perfect aristocracy, or\ngovernment by the best, that could be conceived; yet what result could be\nmore matter-of-course? The people of to-day, too intelligent to be misled\nor abused for selfish ends even by demigods, are ready, on the other\nhand, to comprehend and to follow with enthusiasm every better leading.\nThe result is, that our greatest men and women wield to-day an unselfish\nempire, more absolute than your czars dreamed of, and of an extent to\nmake Alexander's conquests seem provincial. There are men in the world\nwho when they choose to appeal to their fellow-men, by the bare\nannouncement are able to command the simultaneous attention of one to\nfive or eight hundred millions of people. In fact, if the occasion be a\ngreat one, and the speaker worthy of it, a world-wide silence reigns as\nin their various places, some beneath the sun and others under the stars,\nsome by the light of dawn and others at sunset, all hang on the lips of\nthe teacher. Such power would have seemed, perhaps, in your day\ndangerous, but when you consider that its tenure is conditional on the\nwisdom and unselfishness of its exercise, and would fail with the first\nfalse note, you may judge that it is a dominion as safe as God's.\"\n\n\"Dr. Leete,\" I said, \"has told me something of the way in which the\nuniversality of culture, combined with your scientific appliances, has\nmade physically possible this leadership of the best; but, I beg your\npardon, how could a speaker address numbers so vast as you speak of\nunless the pentecostal miracle were repeated? Surely the audience must be\nlimited at least by the number of those understanding one language.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that Dr. Leete has not told you of our universal\nlanguage?\"\n\n\"I have heard no language but English.\"\n\n\"Of course, everybody talks the language of his own country with his\ncountrymen, but with the rest of the world he talks the general\nlanguage--that is to say, we have nowadays to acquire but two languages\nto talk to all peoples--our own, and the universal. We may learn as many\nmore as we please, and we usually please to learn many, but these two are\nalone needful to go all over the world or to speak across it without an\ninterpreter. A number of the smaller nations have wholly abandoned their\nnational tongue and talk only the general language. The greater nations,\nwhich have fine literature embalmed in their languages, have been more\nreluctant to abandon them, and in this way the smaller folks have\nactually had a certain sort of advantage over the greater. The tendency,\nhowever, to cultivate but one language as a living tongue and to treat\nall the others as dead or moribund is increasing at such a rate that if\nyou had slept through another generation you might have found none but\nphilological experts able to talk with you.\"\n\n\"But even with the universal telephone and the universal language,\" I\nsaid, \"there still remains the ceremonial and ritual side of religion to\nbe considered. For the practice of that I should suppose the piously\ninclined would still need churches to assemble in, however able to\ndispense with them for purposes of instruction.\"\n\n\"If any feel that need, there is no reason why they should not have as\nmany churches as they wish and assemble as often as they see fit. I do\nnot know but there are still those who do so. But with a high grade of\nintelligence become universal the world was bound to outgrow the\nceremonial side of religion, which with its forms and symbols, its holy\ntimes and places, its sacrifices, feasts, fasts, and new moons, meant so\nmuch in the child-time of the race. The time has now fully come which\nChrist foretold in that talk with the woman by the well of Samaria when\nthe idea of the Temple and all it stood for would give place to the\nwholly spiritual religion, without respect of times or places, which he\ndeclared most pleasing to God.\n\n\"With the ritual and ceremonial side of religion outgrown,\" said I, \"with\nchurch attendance become superfluous for purposes of instruction, and\neverybody selecting his own preacher on personal grounds, I should say\nthat sectarian lines must have pretty nearly disappeared.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said Mr. Barton, \"that reminds me that our talk began with\nyour inquiry as to what religious sect I belonged to. It is a very long\ntime since it has been customary for people to divide themselves into\nsects and classify themselves under different names on account of\nvariations of opinion as to matters of religion.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" I exclaimed, \"that you mean to say people no longer\nquarrel over religion? Do you actually tell me that human beings have\nbecome capable of entertaining different opinions about the next world\nwithout becoming enemies in this? Dr. Leete has compelled me to believe a\ngood many miracles, but this is too much.\"\n\n\"I do not wonder that it seems rather a startling proposition, at first\nstatement, to a man of the nineteenth century,\" replied Mr. Barton. \"But,\nafter all, who was it who started and kept up the quarreling over\nreligion in former days?\"\n\n\"It was, of course, the ecclesiastical bodies--the priests and\npreachers.\"\n\n\"But they were not many. How were they able to make so much trouble?\"\n\n\"On account of the masses of the people who, being densely ignorant, were\ncorrespondingly superstitious and bigoted, and were tools in the hands of\nthe ecclesiastics.\"\n\n\"But there was a minority of the cultured. Were they bigoted also? Were\nthey tools of the ecclesiastics?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they always held a calm and tolerant attitude on\nreligious questions and were independent of the priesthoods. If they\ndeferred to ecclesiastical influence at all, it was because they held it\nneedful for the purpose of controlling the ignorant populace.\"\n\n\"Very good. You have explained your miracle. There is no ignorant\npopulace now for whose sake it is necessary for the more intelligent to\nmake any compromises with truth. Your cultured class, with their tolerant\nand philosophical view of religious differences, and the criminal folly\nof quarreling about them, has become the only class there is.\"\n\n\"How long is it since people ceased to call themselves Catholics,\nProtestants, Baptists, Methodists, and so on?\"\n\n\"That kind of classification may be said to have received a fatal shock\nat the time of the great Revolution, when sectarian demarcations and\ndoctrinal differences, already fallen into a good deal of disregard, were\ncompletely swept away and forgotten in the passionate impulse of\nbrotherly love which brought men together for the founding of a nobler\nsocial order. The old habit might possibly have revived in time had it\nnot been for the new culture, which, during the first generation\nsubsequent to the Revolution, destroyed the soil of ignorance and\nsuperstition which had supported ecclesiastical influence, and made its\nrecrudescence impossible for evermore.\n\n\"Although, of course,\" continued my companion, \"the universalizing of\nintellectual culture is the only cause that needs to be considered in\naccounting for the total disappearance of religious sectarianism, yet it\nwill give you a more vivid realization of the gulf fixed between the\nancient and the modern usages as to religion if you consider certain\neconomic conditions, now wholly passed away, which in your time\nbuttressed the power of ecclesiastical institutions in very substantial\nways. Of course, in the first place, church buildings were needful to\npreach in, and equally so for the ritual and ceremonial side of religion.\nMoreover, the sanction of religious teaching, depending chiefly on the\nauthority of tradition instead of its own reasonableness, made it\nnecessary for any preacher who would command hearers to enter the service\nof some of the established sectarian organizations. Religion, in a word,\nlike industry and politics, was capitalized by greater or smaller\ncorporations which exclusively controlled the plant and machinery, and\nconducted it for the prestige and power of the firms. As all those who\ndesired to engage in politics or industry were obliged to do so in\nsubjection to the individuals and corporations controlling the machinery,\nso was it in religious matters likewise. Persons desirous of entering on\nthe occupation of religious teaching could do so only by conforming to\nthe conditions of some of the organizations controlling the machinery,\nplant, and good will of the business--that is to say, of some one of the\ngreat ecclesiastical corporations. To teach religion outside of these\ncorporations, when not positively illegal, was a most difficult\nundertaking, however great the ability of the teacher--as difficult,\nindeed, as it was to get on in politics without wearing a party badge, or\nto succeed in business in opposition to the great capitalists. The\nwould-be religious teacher had to attach himself, therefore, to some one\nor other of the sectarian organizations, whose mouthpiece he must consent\nto be, as the condition of obtaining any hearing at all. The organization\nmight be hierarchical, in which case he took his instructions from above,\nor it might be congregational, in which case he took his orders from\nbelow. The one method was monarchical, the other democratic, but one as\ninconsistent as the other with the office of the religious teacher, the\nfirst condition of which, as we look at it, should be absolute\nspontaneity of feeling and liberty of utterance.\n\n\"It may be said that the old ecclesiastical system depended on a double\nbondage: first, the intellectual subjection of the masses through\nignorance to their spiritual directors; and, secondly, the bondage of the\ndirectors themselves to the sectarian organizations, which as spiritual\ncapitalists monopolized the opportunities of teaching. As the bondage was\ntwofold, so also was the enfranchisement--a deliverance alike of the\npeople and of their teachers, who, under the guise of leaders, had been\nthemselves but puppets. Nowadays preaching is as free as hearing, and as\nopen to all. The man who feels a special calling to talk to his fellows\nupon religious themes has no need of any other capital than something\nworth saying. Given this, without need of any further machinery than the\nfree telephone, he is able to command an audience limited only by the\nforce and fitness of what he has to say. He now does not live by his\npreaching. His business is not a distinct profession. He does not belong\nto a class apart from other citizens, either by education or occupation.\nIt is not needful for any purpose that he should do so. The higher\neducation which he shares with all others furnishes ample intellectual\nequipment, while the abundant leisure for personal pursuits with which\nour life is interfused, and the entire exemption from public duty after\nforty-five, give abundant opportunity for the exercise of his vocation.\nIn a word, the modern religious teacher is a prophet, not a priest. The\nsanction of his words lies not in any human ordination or ecclesiastical\n_exequatur,_ but, even as it was with the prophets of old, in such\nresponse as his words may have power to evoke from human hearts.\"\n\n\"If people,\" I suggested, \"still retaining a taste for the old-time\nritual and ceremonial observances and face-to-face preaching, should\ndesire to have churches and clergy for their special service, is there\nanything to prevent it?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Liberty is the first and last word of our civilization. It\nis perfectly consistent with our economic system for a group of\nindividuals, by contributing out of their incomes, not only to rent\nbuildings for group purposes, but by indemnifying the nation for the loss\nof an individual's public service to secure him as their special\nminister. Though the state will enforce no private contracts of any sort,\nit does not forbid them. The old ecclesiastical system was, for a time\nafter the Revolution, kept up by remnants in this way, and might be until\nnow if anybody had wished. But the contempt into which the hireling\nrelation had fallen at once after the Revolution soon made the position\nof such hired clergymen intolerable, and presently there were none who\nwould demean themselves by entering upon so despised a relation, and\nnone, indeed, who would have spiritual service, of all others, on such\nterms.\"\n\n\"As you tell the story,\" I said, \"it seems very plain how it all came\nabout, and could not have been otherwise; but you can perhaps hardly\nimagine how a man of the nineteenth century, accustomed to the vast place\noccupied by the ecclesiastical edifice and influence in human affairs, is\naffected by the idea of a world getting on without anything of the sort.\"\n\n\"I can imagine something of your sensation,\" replied my companion,\n\"though doubtless not adequately. And yet I must say that no change in\nthe social order seems to us to have been more distinctly foreshadowed by\nthe signs of the times in your day than precisely this passing away of\nthe ecclesiastical system. As you yourself observed, just before we came\ninto this church, there was then going on a general deliquescence of\ndogmatism which made your contemporaries wonder what was going to be\nleft. The influence and authority of the clergy were rapidly\ndisappearing, the sectarian lines were being obliterated, the creeds were\nfalling into contempt, and the authority of tradition was being\nrepudiated. Surely if anything could be safely predicted it was that the\nreligious ideas and institutions of the world were approaching some great\nchange.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"if the ecclesiastics of my day had regarded the\nresult as merely depending on the drift of opinion among men, they would\nhave been inclined to give up all hope of retaining their influence, but\nthere was another element in the case which gave them courage.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\n\"The women. They were in my day called the religious sex. The clergy\ngenerally were ready to admit that so far as the interest of the cultured\nclass of men, and indeed of the men generally, in the churches went, they\nwere in a bad way, but they had faith that the devotion of the women\nwould save the cause. Woman was the sheet anchor of the Church. Not only\nwere women the chief attendants at religious functions, but it was\nlargely through their influence on the men that the latter tolerated,\neven so far as they did, the ecclesiastical pretensions. Now, were not\nour clergymen justified in counting on the continued support of women,\nwhatever the men might do?\"\n\n\"Certainly they would have been if woman's position was to remain\nunchanged, but, as you are doubtless by this time well aware, the\nelevation and enlargement of woman's sphere in all directions was perhaps\nthe most notable single aspect of the Revolution. When women were called\nthe religious sex it would have been indeed a high ascription if it had\nbeen meant that they were the more spiritually minded, but that was not\nat all what the phrase signified to those who used it; it was merely\nintended to put in a complimentary way the fact that women in your day\nwere the docile sex. Less educated, as a rule, than men, unaccustomed to\nresponsibility, and trained in habits of subordination and self-distrust,\nthey leaned in all things upon precedent and authority. Naturally,\ntherefore, they still held to the principle of authoritative teaching in\nreligion long after men had generally rejected it. All that was changed\nwith the Revolution, and indeed began to change long before it. Since the\nRevolution there has been no difference in the education of the sexes nor\nin the independence of their economic and social position, in the\nexercise of responsibility or experience in the practical conduct of\naffairs. As you might naturally infer, they are no longer, as formerly, a\npeculiarly docile class, nor have they any more toleration for authority,\nwhether in religion, politics, or economics, than their brethren. In\nevery pursuit of life they join with men on equal terms, including the\nmost important and engrossing of all our pursuits--the search after\nknowledge concerning the nature and destiny of man and his relation to\nthe spiritual and material infinity of which he is a part.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nERITIS SICUT DEUS.\n\n\"I infer, then,\" I said, \"that the disappearance of religious divisions\nand the priestly caste has not operated to lessen the general interest in\nreligion.\"\n\n\"Should you have supposed that it would so operate?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I never gave much thought to such matters. The\necclesiastical class represented that they were very essential to the\nconservation of religion, and the rest of us took it for granted that it\nwas so.\"\n\n\"Every social institution which has existed for a considerable time,\"\nreplied Mr. Barton, \"has doubtless performed some function which was at\nthe time more or less useful and necessary. Kings, ecclesiastics, and\ncapitalists--all of them, for that matter, merely different sorts of\ncapitalists--have, no doubt, in their proper periods, performed functions\nwhich, however badly discharged, were necessary and could not then have\nbeen discharged in any better manner. But just as the abolition of\nroyalty was the beginning of decent government, just as the abolition of\nprivate capitalism was the beginning of effective wealth production, so\nthe disappearance of church organization and machinery, or ecclesiastical\ncapitalism, was the beginning of a world-awakening of impassioned\ninterest in the vast concerns covered by the word religion.\n\n\"Necessary as may have been the subjection of the race to priestly\nauthority in the course of human evolution, it was the form of tutelage\nwhich, of all others, was most calculated to benumb and deaden the\nfaculties affected by it, and the collapse of ecclesiasticism presently\nprepared the way for an enthusiasm of interest in the great problems of\nhuman nature and destiny which would have been scarcely conceivable by\nthe worthy ecclesiastics of your day who with such painful efforts and\nsmall results sought to awake their flocks to spiritual concerns. The\nlack of general interest in these questions in your time was the natural\nresult of their monopoly as the special province of the priestly class\nwhose members stood as interpreters between man and the mystery about\nhim, undertaking to guarantee the spiritual welfare of all who would\ntrust them. The decay of priestly authority left every soul face to face\nwith that mystery, with the responsibility of its interpretation upon\nhimself. The collapse of the traditional theologies relieved the whole\nsubject of man's relation with the infinite from the oppressive effect of\nthe false finalities of dogma which had till then made the most boundless\nof sciences the most cramped and narrow. Instead of the mind-paralyzing\nworship of the past and the bondage of the present to that which is\nwritten, the conviction took hold on men that there was no limit to what\nthey might know concerning their nature and destiny and no limit to that\ndestiny. The priestly idea that the past was diviner than the present,\nthat God was behind the race, gave place to the belief that we should\nlook forward and not backward for inspiration, and that the present and\nthe future promised a fuller and more certain knowledge concerning the\nsoul and God than any the past had attained.\"\n\n\"Has this belief,\" I asked, \"been thus far practically confirmed by any\nprogress actually made in the assurance of what is true as to these\nthings? Do you consider that you really know more about them than we did,\nor that you know more positively the things which we merely tried to\nbelieve?\"\n\nMr. Barton paused a moment before replying.\n\n\"You remarked a little while ago,\" he said, \"that your talks with Dr.\nLeete had as yet turned little on religious matters. In introducing you\nto the modern world it was entirely right and logical that he should\ndwell at first mainly upon the change in economic systems, for that has,\nof course, furnished the necessary material basis for all the other\nchanges that have taken place. But I am sure that you will never meet any\none who, being asked in what direction the progress of the race during\nthe past century has tended most to increase human happiness, would not\nreply that it had been in the science of the soul and its relation to the\nEternal and Infinite.\n\n\"This progress has been the result not merely of a more rational\nconception of the subject and complete intellectual freedom in its study,\nbut largely also of social conditions which have set us almost wholly\nfree from material engrossments. We have now for nearly a century enjoyed\nan economic welfare which has left nothing to be wished for in the way of\nphysical satisfactions, especially as in proportion to the increase of\nthis abundance there has been through culture a development of simplicity\nin taste which rejects excess and surfeit and ever makes less and less of\nthe material side of life and more of the mental and moral. Thanks to\nthis co-operation of the material with the moral evolution, the more we\nhave the less we need. Long ago it came to be recognized that on the\nmaterial side the race had reached the goal of its evolution. We have\npractically lost ambition for further progress in that direction. The\nnatural result has been that for a long period the main energies of the\nintellect have been concentrated upon the possibilities of the spiritual\nevolution of mankind for which the completion of its material evolution\nhas but prepared the beginning. What we have so far learned we are\nconvinced is but the first faint inkling of the knowledge we shall attain\nto; and yet if the limitations of this earthly state were such that we\nmight never hope here to know more than now we should not repine, for the\nknowledge we have has sufficed to turn the shadow of death into a bow of\npromise and distill the saltness out of human tears. You will observe, as\nyou shall come to know more of our literature, that one respect in which\nit differs from yours is the total lack of the tragic note. This has very\nnaturally followed, from a conception of our real life, as having an\ninaccessible security, 'hid in God,' as Paul said, whereby the accidents\nand vicissitudes of the personality are reduced to relative triviality.\n\n\"Your seers and poets in exalted moments had seen that death was but a\nstep in life, but this seemed to most of you to have been a hard saying.\nNowadays, as life advances toward its close, instead of being shadowed by\ngloom, it is marked by an access of impassioned expectancy which would\ncause the young to envy the old, but for the knowledge that in a little\nwhile the same door will be opened to them. In your day the undertone of\nlife seems to have been one of unutterable sadness, which, like the\nmoaning of the sea to those who live near the ocean, made itself audible\nwhenever for a moment the noise and bustle of petty engrossments ceased.\nNow this undertone is so exultant that we are still to hear it.\"\n\n\"If men go on,\" I said, \"growing at this rate in the knowledge of divine\nthings and the sharing of the divine life, what will they yet come to?\"\n\nMr. Barton smiled.\n\n\"Said not the serpent in the old story, 'If you eat of the fruit of the\ntree of knowledge you shall be as gods'? The promise was true in words,\nbut apparently there was some mistake about the tree. Perhaps it was the\ntree of selfish knowledge, or else the fruit was not ripe. The story is\nobscure. Christ later said the same thing when he told men that they\nmight be the sons of God. But he made no mistake as to the tree he showed\nthem, and the fruit was ripe. It was the fruit of love, for universal\nlove is at once the seed and fruit, cause and effect, of the highest and\ncompletest knowledge. Through boundless love man becomes a god, for\nthereby is he made conscious of his oneness with God, and all things are\nput under his feet. It has been only since the great Revolution brought\nin the era of human brotherhood that mankind has been able to eat\nabundantly of this fruit of the true tree of knowledge, and thereby grow\nmore and more into the consciousness of the divine soul as the essential\nself and the true hiding of our lives. Yes, indeed, we shall be gods. The\nmotto of the modern civilization is '_Eritis sicut Deus_.'\"\n\n\"You speak of Christ. Do I understand that this modern religion is\nconsidered by you to be the same doctrine Christ taught?\"\n\n\"Most certainly. It has been taught from the beginning of history and\ndoubtless earlier, but Christ's teaching is that which has most fully and\nclearly come down to us. It was the doctrine that he taught, but the\nworld could not then receive it save a few, nor indeed has it ever been\npossible for the world in general to receive it or even to understand it\nuntil this present century.\"\n\n\"Why could not the world receive earlier the revelation it seems to find\nso easy of comprehension now?\"\n\n\"Because,\" replied Mr. Barton, \"the prophet and revealer of the soul and\nof God, which are the same, is love, and until these latter days the\nworld refused to hear love, but crucified him. The religion of Christ,\ndepending as it did upon the experience and intuitions of the unselfish\nenthusiasms, could not possibly be accepted or understood generally by a\nworld which tolerated a social system based upon fratricidal struggle as\nthe condition of existence. Prophets, messiahs, seers, and saints might\nindeed for themselves see God face to face, but it was impossible that\nthere should be any general apprehension of God as Christ saw him until\nsocial justice had brought in brotherly love. Man must be revealed to man\nas brother before God could be revealed to him as father. Nominally, the\nclergy professed to accept and repeat Christ's teaching that God is a\nloving father, but of course it was simply impossible that any such idea\nshould actually germinate and take root in hearts as cold and hard as\nstone toward their fellow-beings and sodden with hate and suspicion of\nthem. 'If a man love not his brother whom he hath seen, how shall he love\nGod whom he hath not seen?' The priests deafened their flocks with\nappeals to love God, to give their hearts to him. They should have rather\ntaught them, as Christ did, to love their fellow-men and give their\nhearts to them. Hearts so given the love of God would presently enkindle,\neven as, according to the ancients, fire from heaven might be depended on\nto ignite a sacrifice fitly prepared and laid.\n\n\"From the pulpit yonder, Mr. West, doubtless you have many times heard\nthese words and many like them repeated: 'If we love one another God\ndwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.' 'He that loveth his\nbrother dwelleth in the light.' 'If any man say I love God, and hateth\nhis brother, he is a liar.' 'He that loveth not his brother, abideth in\ndeath.' 'God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God.'\n'Every one that loveth knoweth God.' 'He that loveth not knoweth not\nGod.'\n\n\"Here is the very distillation of Christ's teaching as to the conditions\nof entering on the divine life. In this we find the sufficient\nexplanation why the revelation which came to Christ so long ago and to\nother illumined souls could not possibly be received by mankind in\ngeneral so long as an inhuman social order made a wall between man and\nGod, and why, the moment that wall was cast down, the revelation flooded\nthe earth like a sunburst.\n\n\"'If we love one another God dwelleth in us,' and mark how the words were\nmade good in the way by which at last the race found God! It was not,\nremember, by directly, purposely, or consciously seeking God. The great\nenthusiasm of humanity which overthrew the old order and brought in the\nfraternal society was not primarily or consciously a godward aspiration\nat all. It was essentially a humane movement. It was a melting and\nflowing forth of men's hearts toward one another, a rush of contrite,\nrepentant tenderness, an impassioned impulse of mutual love and\nself-devotion to the common weal. But 'if we love one another God\ndwelleth in us,' and so men found it. It appears that there came a\nmoment, the most transcendent moment in the history of the race of man,\nwhen with the fraternal glow of this world of new-found embracing\nbrothers there seems to have mingled the ineffable thrill of a divine\nparticipation, as if the hand of God were clasped over the joined hands\nof men. And so it has continued to this day and shall for evermore.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nSEVERAL IMPORTANT MATTERS OVERLOOKED.\n\nAfter dinner the doctor said that he had an excursion to suggest for the\nafternoon.\n\n\"It has often occurred to me,\" he went on, \"that when you shall go out\ninto the world and become familiar with its features by your own\nobservation, you will, in looking back on these preparatory lessons I\nhave tried to give you, form a very poor impression of my talent as a\npedagogue. I am very much dissatisfied myself with the method in which I\nhave developed the subject, which, instead of having been philosophically\nconceived as a plan of instruction, has been merely a series of random\ntalks, guided rather by your own curiosity than any scheme on my part.\"\n\n\"I am very thankful, my dear friend and teacher,\" I replied, \"that you\nhave spared me the philosophical method. Without boasting that I have\nacquired so soon a complete understanding of your modern system, I am\nvery sure that I know a good deal more about it than I otherwise should,\nfor the very reason that you have so good-naturedly followed the lead of\nmy curiosity instead of tying me to the tailboard of a method.\"\n\n\"I should certainly like to believe,\" said the doctor, \"that our talks\nhave been as instructive to you as they have been delightful to me, and\nif I have made mistakes it should be remembered that perhaps no\ninstructor ever had or is likely to have a task quite so large as mine,\nor one so unexpectedly thrust upon him, or, finally, one which, being so\nlarge, the natural curiosity of his pupil compelled him to cover in so\nshort a time.\"\n\n\"But you were speaking of an excursion for this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor. \"It is a suggestion in the line of an attempt to\nremedy some few of my too probable omissions of important things in\ntrying to acquaint you with how we live now. What do you say to\nchartering an air car this afternoon for the purpose of taking a\nbird's-eye view of the city and environs, and seeing what its various\naspects may suggest in the way of features of present-day civilization\nwhich we have not touched upon?\"\n\nThe idea struck me as admirable, and we at once proceeded to put it in\nexecution.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn these brief and fragmentary reminiscences of my first experiences in\nthe modern world it is, of course, impossible that I should refer to one\nin a hundred of the startling things which happened to me. Still, even\nwith that limitation, it may seem strange to my readers that I have not\nhad more to say of the wonder excited in my mind by the number and\ncharacter of the great mechanical inventions and applications unknown in\nmy day, which contribute to the material fabric and actuate the mechanism\nof your civilization. For example, although this was very far from being\nmy first air trip, I do not think that I have before referred to a sort\nof experience which, to a representative of the last century, must\nnaturally have been nothing less than astounding. I can only say, by way\nof explanation of this seeming indifference to the mechanical wonders of\nthis age, that had they been ten times more marvelous, they would still\nhave impressed me with infinitely less astonishment than the moral\nrevolution illustrated by your new social order.\n\nThis, I am sure, is what would be the experience of any man of my time\nunder my circumstances. The march of scientific discovery and mechanical\ninvention during the last half of the nineteenth century had already been\nso great and was proceeding so rapidly that we were prepared to expect\nalmost any amount of development in the same lines in the future. Your\nsubmarine shipping we had distinctly anticipated and even partially\nrealized. The discovery of the electrical powers had made almost any\nmechanical conception seem possible. As to navigation of the air, we\nfully expected that would be somehow successfully solved by our\ngrandchildren if not by our children. If, indeed, I had not found men\nsailing the air I should have been distinctly disappointed.\n\nBut while we were prepared to expect well-nigh anything of man's\nintellectual development and the perfecting of his mastery over the\nmaterial world, we were utterly skeptical as to the possibility of any\nlarge moral improvement on his part. As a moral being, we believed that\nhe had got his growth, as the saying was, and would never in this world\nat least attain to a nobler stature. As a philosophical proposition, we\nrecognized as fully as you do that the golden rule would afford the basis\nof a social life in which every one would be infinitely happier than\nanybody was in our world, and that the true interest of all would be\nfurthered by establishing such a social order; but we held at the same\ntime that the moral baseness and self-blinding selfishness of man would\nforever prevent him from realizing such an ideal. In vain, had he been\nendowed with a godlike intellect; it would not avail him for any of the\nhigher uses of life, for an ineradicable moral perverseness would always\nhinder him from doing as well as he knew and hold him in hopeless\nsubjection to the basest and most suicidal impulses of his nature.\n\n\"Impossible; it is against human nature!\" was the cry which met and for\nthe most part overbore and silenced every prophet or teacher who sought\nto rouse the world to discontent with the reign of chaos and awaken faith\nin the possibility of a kingdom of God on earth.\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that one like me, bred in that atmosphere of\nmoral despair, should pass over with comparatively little attention the\nmiraculous material achievements of this age, to study with ever-growing\nawe and wonder the secret of your just and joyous living?\n\nAs I look back I see now how truly this base view of human nature was the\ngreatest infidelity to God and man which the human race ever fell into,\nbut, alas! it was not the infidelity which the churches condemned, but\nrather a sort which their teachings of man's hopeless depravity were\ncalculated to implant and confirm.\n\nThis very matter of air navigation of which I was speaking suggests a\nstriking illustration of the strange combination on the part of my\ncontemporaries of unlimited faith in man's material progress with total\nunbelief in his moral possibilities. As I have said, we fully expected\nthat posterity would achieve air navigation, but the application of the\nart most discussed was its use in war to drop dynamite bombs in the midst\nof crowded cities. Try to realize that if you can. Even Tennyson, in his\nvision of the future, saw nothing more. You remember how he\n\n  Heard the heavens fill with shouting,\n    And there rained a ghastly dew\n  From the nations airy navies,\n    Grappling in the central blue.\n\nHOW THE PEOPLE HOLD THE REINS.\n\n\"And now,\" said the doctor, as he checked the rise of our car at an\naltitude of about one thousand feet, \"let us attend to our lesson. What\ndo you see down there to suggest a question?\"\n\n\"Well, to begin with,\" I said, as the dome of the Statehouse caught my\neye, \"what on earth have you stuck up there? It looks for all the world\nlike one of those self-steering windmills the farmers in my day used to\npump up water with. Surely that is an odd sort of ornament for a public\nbuilding.\"\n\n\"It is not intended as an ornament, but a symbol,\" replied the doctor.\n\"It represents the modern ideal of a proper system of government. The\nmill stands for the machinery of administration, the wind that drives it\nsymbolizes the public will, and the rudder that always keeps the vane of\nthe mill before the wind, however suddenly or completely the wind may\nchange, stands for the method by which the administration is kept at all\ntimes responsive and obedient to every mandate of the people, though it\nbe but a breath.\n\n\"I have talked to you so much on that subject that I need enlarge no\nfurther on the impossibility of having any popular government worthy of\nthe name which is not based upon the economic equality of the citizens\nwith its implications and consequences. No constitutional devices or\ncleverness of parliamentary machinery could have possibly made popular\ngovernment anything but a farce, so long as the private economic interest\nof the citizen was distinct from and opposed to the public interest, and\nthe so-called sovereign people ate their bread from the hand of\ncapitalists. Given, on the other hand, economic unity of private\ninterests with public interest, the complete independence of every\nindividual on every other, and universal culture to cap all, and no\nimperfection of administrative machinery could prevent the government\nfrom being a good one. Nevertheless, we have improved the machinery as\nmuch as we have the motive force. You used to vote once a year, or in two\nyears, or in six years, as the case might be, for those who were to rule\nover you till the next election, and those rulers, from the moment of\ntheir election to the term of their offices, were as irresponsible as\nczars. They were far more so, indeed, for the czar at least had a supreme\nmotive to leave his inheritance unimpaired to his son, while these\nelected tyrants had no interest except in making the most they could out\nof their power while they held it.\n\n\"It appears to us that it is an axiom of democratic government that power\nshould never be delegated irrevocably for an hour, but should always be\nsubject to recall by the delegating power. Public officials are nowadays\nchosen for a term as a matter of convenience, but it is not a term\npositive. They are liable to have their powers revoked at any moment by\nthe vote of their principals; neither is any measure of more than merely\nroutine character ever passed by a representative body without reference\nback to the people. The vote of no delegate upon any important measure\ncan stand until his principals--or constituents, as you used to call\nthem--have had the opportunity to cancel it. An elected agent of the\npeople who offended the sentiment of the electors would be displaced, and\nhis act repudiated the next day. You may infer that under this system the\nagent is solicitous to keep in contact with his principals. Not only do\nthese precautions exist against irresponsible legislation, but the\noriginal proposition of measures comes from the people more often than\nfrom their representatives.\n\n\"So complete through our telephone system has the most complicated sort\nof voting become, that the entire nation is organized so as to be able to\nproceed almost like one parliament if needful. Our representative bodies,\ncorresponding to your former Congresses, Legislatures, and Parliaments,\nare under this system reduced to the exercise of the functions of what\nyou used to call congressional committees. The people not only nominally\nbut actually govern. We have a democracy in fact.\n\n\"We take pains to exercise this direct and constant supervision of our\naffairs not because we suspect or fear our elected agents. Under our\nsystem of indefeasible, unchangeable, economic equality there is no\nmotive or opportunity for venality. There is no motive for doing evil\nthat could be for a moment set against the overwhelming motive of\ndeserving the public esteem, which is indeed the only possible object\nthat nowadays could induce any one to accept office. All our vital\ninterests are secured beyond disturbance by the very framework of\nsociety. We could safely turn over to a selected body of citizens the\nmanagement of the public affairs for their lifetime. The reason we do not\nis that we enjoy the exhilaration of conducting the government of affairs\ndirectly. You might compare us to a wealthy man of your day who, though\nhaving in his service any number of expert coachmen, preferred to handle\nthe reins himself for the pleasure of it. You used to vote perhaps once a\nyear, taking five minutes for it, and grudging the time at that as lost\nfrom your private business, the pursuit of which you called, I believe,\n'the main chance.' Our private business is the public business, and we\nhave no other of importance. Our 'main chance' is the public welfare, and\nwe have no other chance. We vote a hundred times perhaps in a year, on\nall manner of questions, from the temperature of the public baths or the\nplan to be selected for a public building, to the greatest questions of\nthe world union, and find the exercise at once as exhilarating as it is\nin the highest sense educational.\n\n\"And now, Julian, look down again and see if you do not find some other\nfeature of the scene to hang a question on.\"\n\nTHE LITTLE WARS AND THE GREAT WAR.\n\n\"I observe,\" I said, \"that the harbor forts are still there. I suppose\nyou retain them, like the specimen tenement houses, as historical\nevidences of the barbarism of your ancestors, my contemporaries.\"\n\n\"You must not be offended,\" said the doctor, \"if I say that we really\nhave to keep a full assortment of such exhibits, for fear the children\nshould flatly refuse to believe the accounts the books give of the\nunaccountable antics of their great-grandfathers.\"\n\n\"The guarantee of international peace which the world union has\nbrought,\" I said, \"must surely be regarded by your people as one of the\nmost signal achievements of the new order, and yet it strikes me I have\nheard you say very little about it.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the doctor, \"it is a great thing in itself, but so\nincomparably less important than the abolition of the economic war\nbetween man and man that we regard it as merely incidental to the latter.\nNothing is much more astonishing about the mental operations of your\ncontemporaries than the fuss they made about the cruelty of your\noccasional international wars while seemingly oblivious to the horrors of\nthe battle for existence in which you all were perpetually involved. From\nour point of view, your wars, while of course very foolish, were\ncomparatively humane and altogether petty exhibitions as contrasted\nwith the fratricidal economic struggle. In the wars only men took\npart--strong, selected men, comprising but a very small part of the total\npopulation. There were no women, no children, no old people, no cripples\nallowed to go to war. The wounded were carefully looked after, whether by\nfriends or foes, and nursed back to health. The rules of war forbade\nunnecessary cruelty, and at any time an honorable surrender, with good\ntreatment, was open to the beaten. The battles generally took place on\nthe frontiers, out of sight and sound of the masses. Wars were also very\nrare, often not one in a generation. Finally, the sentiments appealed\nto in international conflicts were, as a rule, those of courage and\nself-devotion. Often, indeed generally, the causes of the wars were\nunworthy of the sentiments of self-devotion which the fighting called\nout, but the sentiments themselves belonged to the noblest order.\n\n\"Compare with warfare of this character the conditions of the economic\nstruggle for existence. That was a war in which not merely small selected\nbodies of combatants took part, but one in which the entire population of\nevery country, excepting the inconsiderable groups of the rich, were\nforcibly enlisted and compelled to serve. Not only did women, children,\nthe aged and crippled have to participate in it, but the weaker the\ncombatants the harder the conditions under which they must contend. It\nwas a war in which there was no help for the wounded, no quarter for the\nvanquished. It was a war not on far frontiers, but in every city, every\nstreet, and every house, and its wounded, broken, and dying victims lay\nunderfoot everywhere and shocked the eye in every direction that it might\nglance with some new form of misery. The ear could not escape the\nlamentations of the stricken and their vain cries for pity. And this war\ncame not once or twice in a century, lasting for a few red weeks or\nmonths or years, and giving way again to peace, as did the battles of the\nsoldiers, but was perennial and perpetual, truceless, lifelong. Finally,\nit was a war which neither appealed to nor developed any noble, any\ngenerous, any honorable sentiment, but, on the contrary, set a constant\npremium on the meanest, falsest, and most cruel propensities of human\nnature.\n\n\"As we look back upon your era, the sort of fighting those old forts down\nthere stood for seems almost noble and barely tragical at all, as\ncompared with the awful spectacle of the struggle for existence.\n\n\"We even are able to sympathize with the declaration of some of the\nprofessional soldiers of your age that occasional wars, with their\nappeals, however false, to the generous and self-devoting passions, were\nabsolutely necessary to prevent your society, otherwise so utterly sordid\nand selfish in its ideals, from dissolving into absolute putrescence.\"\n\n\"It is to be feared,\" I was moved to observe, \"that posterity has not\nbuilt so high a monument to the promoters of the universal peace\nsocieties of my day as they expected.\"\n\n\"They were well meaning enough so far as they saw, no doubt,\" said the\ndoctor, \"but seem to have been a dreadfully short-sighted and purblind\nset of people. Their efforts to stop wars between nations, while\ntranquilly ignoring the world-wide economic struggle for existence which\ncost more lives and suffering in any one month than did the international\nwars of a generation, was a most striking case of straining at a gnat and\nswallowing a camel.\n\n\"As to the gain to humanity which has come from the abolition of all war\nor possibility of war between nations of to-day, it seems to us to\nconsist not so much in the mere prevention of actual bloodshed as in the\ndying out of the old jealousies and rancors which used to embitter\npeoples against one another almost as much in peace as in war, and the\ngrowth in their stead of a fraternal sympathy and mutual good will,\nunconscious of any barrier of race or country.\"\n\nTHE OLD PATRIOTISM AND THE NEW.\n\nAs the doctor was speaking, the waving folds of a flag floating far below\ncaught my eye. It was the Star-Spangled Banner. My heart leaped at the\nsight and my eyes grew moist.\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed, \"it is Old Glory!\" for so it had been a custom to call\nthe flag in the days of the civil war and after.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my companion, as his eyes followed my gaze, \"but it wears\na new glory now, because nowhere in the land it floats over is there\nfound a human being oppressed or suffering any want that human aid can\nrelieve.\n\n\"The Americans of your day,\" he continued, \"were extremely patriotic\nafter their fashion, but the difference between the old and the new\npatriotism is so great that it scarcely seems like the same sentiment. In\nyour day and ever before, the emotions and associations of the flag were\nchiefly of the martial sort. Self-devotion to the nation in war with\nother nations was the idea most commonly conveyed by the word\n'patriotism' and its derivatives. Of course, that must be so in ages when\nthe nations had constantly to stand ready to fight one another for their\nexistence. But the result was that the sentiment of national solidarity\nwas arrayed against the sentiment of human solidarity. A lesser social\nenthusiasm was set in opposition to a greater, and the result was\nnecessarily full of moral contradictions. Too often what was called love\nof country might better have been described as hate and jealousy of other\ncountries, for no better reason than that there were other, and bigoted\nprejudices against foreign ideas and institutions--often far better than\ndomestic ones--for no other reason than that they were foreign. This sort\nof patriotism was a most potent hindrance for countless ages to the\nprogress of civilization, opposing to the spread of new ideas barriers\nhigher than mountains, broader than rivers, deeper than seas.\n\n\"The new patriotism is the natural outcome of the new social and\ninternational conditions which date from the great Revolution. Wars,\nwhich were already growing infrequent in your day, were made impossible\nby the rise of the world union, and for generations have now been\nunknown. The old blood-stained frontiers of the nations have become\nscarcely more than delimitations of territory for administrative\nconvenience, like the State lines in the American Union. Under these\ncircumstances international jealousies, suspicions, animosities, and\napprehensions have died a natural death. The anniversaries of battles and\ntriumphs over other nations, by which the antique patriotism was kept\nburning, have been long ago forgotten. In a word, patriotism is no longer\na martial sentiment and is quite without warlike associations. As the\nflag has lost its former significance as an emblem of outward defiance,\nit has gained a new meaning as the supreme symbol of internal concord and\nmutuality; it has become the visible sign of the social solidarity in\nwhich the welfare of all is equally and impregnably secured. The\nAmerican, as he now lifts his eyes to the ensign of the nation, is not\nreminded of its military prowess as compared with other nations, of its\npast triumphs in battle and possible future victories. To him the waving\nfolds convey no such suggestions. They recall rather the compact of\nbrotherhood in which he stands pledged with all his countrymen mutually\nto safeguard the equal dignity and welfare of each by the might of all.\n\n\"The idea of the old-time patriots was that foreigners were the only\npeople at whose hands the flag could suffer dishonor, and the report of\nany lack of etiquette toward it on their part used to excite the people\nto a patriotic frenzy. That sort of feeling would be simply\nincomprehensible now. As we look at it, foreigners have no power to\ninsult the flag, for they have nothing to do with it, nor with what it\nstands for. Its honor or dishonor must depend upon the people whose\nplighted faith one to another it represents, to maintain the social\ncontract. To the old-time patriot there was nothing incongruous in the\nspectacle of the symbol of the national unity floating over cities\nreeking with foulest oppressions, full of prostitution, beggary, and dens\nof nameless misery. According to the modern view, the existence of a\nsingle instance in any corner of the land where a citizen had been\ndeprived of the full enjoyment of equality would turn the flag into a\nflaunting lie, and the people would demand with indignation that it\nshould be hauled down and not raised again till the wrong was remedied.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" I said, \"the new glory which Old Glory wears is a greater than\nthe old glory.\"\n\nMORE FOREIGN TRAVEL BUT LESS FOREIGN TRADE.\n\nAs we had talked, the doctor had allowed our car to drift before the\nwesterly breeze till now we were over the harbor, and I was moved to\nexclaim at the scanty array of shipping it contained.\n\n\"It does not seem to me,\" I said, \"that there are more vessels here than\nin my day, much less the great fleets one might expect to see after a\ncentury's development in population and resources.\"\n\n\"In point of fact,\" said the doctor, \"the new order has tended to\ndecrease the volume of foreign trade, though on the other hand there is a\nthousandfold more foreign travel for instruction and pleasure.\"\n\n\"In just what way,\" I asked, \"did the new order tend to decrease\nexchanges with foreign countries?\"\n\n\"In two ways,\" replied the doctor. \"In the first place, as you know, the\nprofit idea is now abolished in foreign trade as well as in domestic\ndistribution. The International Council supervises all exchanges between\nnations, and the price of any product exported by one nation to another\nmust not be more than that at which the exporting nation provides its own\npeople with the same. Consequently there is no reason why a nation should\ncare to produce goods for export unless and in so far as it needs for\nactual consumption products of another country which it can not itself so\nwell produce.\n\n\"Another yet more potent effect of the new order in limiting foreign\nexchange is the general equalization of all nations which has long ago\ncome about as to intelligence and the knowledge and practice of sciences\nand arts. A nation of to-day would be humiliated to have to import any\ncommodity which insuperable natural conditions did not prevent the\nproduction of at home. It is consequently to such productions that\ncommerce is now limited, and the list of them grows ever shorter as with\nthe progress of invention man's conquest of Nature proceeds. As to the\nold advantage of coal-producing countries in manufacturing, that\ndisappeared nearly a century ago with the great discoveries which made\nthe unlimited development of electrical power practically costless.\n\n\"But you should understand that it is not merely on economic grounds or\nfor self-esteem's sake that the various peoples desire to do everything\npossible for themselves rather than depend on people at a distance. It is\nquite as much for the education and mind-awakening influence of a\ndiversified industrial system within a small space. It is our policy, so\nfar as it can be economically carried out in the grouping of industries,\nnot only to make the system of each nation complete, but so to group the\nvarious industries within each particular country that every considerable\ndistrict shall present within its own limits a sort of microcosm of the\nindustrial world. We were speaking of that, you may remember, the other\nmorning, in the Labor Exchange.\"\n\nTHE MODERN DOCTOR'S EASY TASK.\n\nThe doctor had some time before reversed our course, and we were now\nmoving westward over the city.\n\n\"What is that building which we are just passing over that has so much\nglass about it?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is one of the sanitariums,\" replied the doctor, \"which people go to\nwho are in bad health and do not wish to change their climate, as we\nthink persons in serious chronic ill health ought to do and as all can\nnow do if they desire. In these buildings everything is as absolutely\nadapted to the condition of the patient as if he were for the time being\nin a world in which his disease were the normal type.\"\n\n\"Doubtless there have been great improvements in all matters relating to\nyour profession--medicine, hygiene, surgery, and the rest--since my day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"there have been great improvements in two\nways--negative and positive--and the more important of the two is perhaps\nthe negative way, consisting in the disappearance of conditions inimical\nto health, which physicians formerly had to combat with little chance of\nsuccess in many cases. For example, it is now two full generations since\nthe guarantee of equal maintenance for all placed women in a position of\neconomic independence and consequent complete control of their relations\nto men. You will readily understand how, as one result of this, the taint\nof syphilis has been long since eliminated from the blood of the race.\nThe universal prevalence now for three generations of the most cleanly\nand refined conditions of housing, clothing, heating, and living\ngenerally, with the best treatment available for all in case of sickness,\nhave practically--indeed I may say completely--put an end to the zymotic\nand other contagious diseases. To complete the story, add to these\nimprovements in the hygienic conditions of the people the systematic and\nuniversal physical culture which is a part of the training of youth, and\nthen as a crowning consideration think of the effect of the physical\nrehabilitation--you might almost call it the second creation of woman in\na bodily sense--which has purified and energized the stream of life at\nits source.\"\n\n\"Really, doctor, I should say that, without going further, you have\nfairly reasoned your profession out of its occupation.\"\n\n\"You may well say so,\" replied the doctor. \"The progress of invention and\nimprovement since your day has several times over improved the doctors\nout of their former occupations, just as it has every other sort of\nworkers, but only to open new and higher fields of finer work.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" my companion resumed, \"a more important negative factor in the\nimprovement in medical and hygienic conditions than any I have mentioned\nis the fact that people are no longer in the state of ignorance as to\ntheir own bodies that they seem formerly to have been. The progress of\nknowledge in that respect has kept pace with the march of universal\nculture. It is evident from what we read that even the cultured classes\nin your day thought it no shame to be wholly uninformed as to physiology\nand the ordinary conditions of health and disease. They appear to have\nleft their physical interests to the doctors, with much the same spirit\nof cynical resignation with which they turned over their souls to the\ncare of the clergy. Nowadays a system of education would be thought\nfarcical which did not impart a sufficient knowledge of the general\nprinciples of physiology, hygiene, and medicine to enable a person to\ntreat any ordinary physical disturbance without recourse to a physician.\nIt is perhaps not too much to say that everybody nowadays knows as much\nabout the treatment of disease as a large proportion of the members of\nthe medical profession did in your time. As you may readily suppose, this\nis a situation which, even apart from the general improvement in health,\nwould enable the people to get on with one physician where a score\nformerly found business. We doctors are merely specialists and experts on\nsubjects that everybody is supposed to be well grounded in. When we are\ncalled in, it is really only in consultation, to use a phrase of the\nprofession in your day, the other parties being the patient and his\nfriends.\n\n\"But of all the factors in the advance of medical science, one of the\nmost important has been the disappearance of sectarianism, resulting\nlargely from the same causes, moral and economic, which banished it from\nreligion. You will scarcely need to be reminded that in your day\nmedicine, next to theology, suffered most of all branches of knowledge\nfrom the benumbing influence of dogmatic schools. There seems to have\nbeen well-nigh as much bigotry as to the science of curing the body as\nthe soul, and its influence to discourage original thought and retard\nprogress was much the same in one field as the other.\n\n\"There are really no conditions to limit the course of physicians. The\nmedical education is the fullest possible, but the methods of practice\nare left to the doctor and patient. It is assumed that people as cultured\nas ours are as competent to elect the treatment for their bodies as to\nchoose that for their souls. The progress in medical science which has\nresulted from this complete independence and freedom of initiative on the\npart of the physician, stimulated by the criticism and applause of a\npeople well able to judge of results, has been unprecedented. Not only in\nthe specific application of the preserving and healing arts have\ninnumerable achievements been made and radically new principles\ndiscovered, but we have made advances toward a knowledge of the central\nmystery of life which in your day it would have been deemed almost\nsacrilegious to dream of. As to pain, we permit it only for its\nsymptomatic indications, and so far only as we need its guidance in\ndiagnosis.\"\n\n\"I take it, however, that you have not abolished death.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" laughed the doctor, \"that if perchance any one should\nfind out the secret of that, the people would mob him and burn up his\nformula. Do you suppose we want to be shut up here forever?\"\n\n\"HOW COULD WE INDEED?\"\n\nApplying myself again to the study of the moving panorama below us, I\npresently remarked to the doctor that we must be pretty nearly over what\nwas formerly called Brighton, a suburb of the city at which the live\nstock for the food supply of the city had mainly been delivered.\n\n\"I see the old cattle-sheds are gone,\" I said. \"Doubtless you have much\nbetter arrangements. By the way, now that everybody is well-to-do, and\ncan afford the best cuts of beef, I imagine the problem of providing a\nbig city with fresh meats must be much more difficult than in my day,\nwhen the poor were able to consume little flesh food, and that of the\npoorest sort.\"\n\nThe doctor looked over the side of the car for some moments before\nanswering.\n\n\"I take it,\" he said, \"that you have not spoken to any one before on this\npoint.\"\n\n\"Why, I think not. It has not before occurred to me.\"\n\n\"It is just as well,\" said the doctor. \"You see, Julian, in the\ntransformation in customs and habits of thought and standards of fitness\nsince your day, it could scarcely have happened but that in some cases\nthe changes should have been attended with a decided revulsion in\nsentiment against the former practices. I hardly know how to express\nmyself, but I am rather glad that you first spoke of this matter to me.\"\n\nA light dawned on me, and suddenly brought out the significance of\nnumerous half-digested observations which I had previously made.\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed, \"you mean you don't eat the flesh of animals any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Is it possible you have not guessed that? Had you not noticed that you\nwere offered no such food?\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" I replied, \"the cooking is so different in all respects\nfrom that of my day that I have given up all attempt to identify\nanything. But I have certainly missed no flavor to which I have been\naccustomed, though I have been delighted by a great many novel ones.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"instead of the one or two rude processes\ninherited from primitive men by which you used to prepare food and elicit\nits qualities, we have a great number and variety. I doubt if there was\nany flavor you had which we do not reproduce, besides the great number of\nnew ones discovered since your time.\"\n\n\"But when was the use of animals for food discontinued?\"\n\n\"Soon after the great Revolution.\"\n\n\"What caused the change? Was it a conviction that health would be favored\nby avoiding flesh?\"\n\n\"It does not seem to have been that motive which chiefly led to the\nchange. Undoubtedly the abandonment of the custom of eating animals, by\nwhich we inherited all their diseases, has had something to do with the\ngreat physical improvement of the race, but people did not apparently\ngive up eating animals mainly for health's sake any more than cannibals\nin more ancient times abandoned eating their fellow-men on that account.\nIt was, of course, a very long time ago, and there was perhaps no\npractice of the former order of which the people, immediately after\ngiving it up, seem to have become so much ashamed. This is doubtless why\nwe find such meager information in the histories of the period as to the\ncircumstances of the change. There appears, however, to be no doubt that\nthe abandonment of the custom was chiefly an effect of the great wave of\nhumane feeling, the passion of pity and compunction for all suffering--in\na word, the impulse of tender-heartedness--which was really the great\nmoral power behind the Revolution. As might be expected, this outburst\ndid not affect merely the relations of men with men, but likewise their\nrelations with the whole sentient world. The sentiment of brotherhood,\nthe feeling of solidarity, asserted itself not merely toward men and\nwomen, but likewise toward the humbler companions of our life on earth\nand sharers of its fortunes, the animals. The new and vivid light thrown\non the rights and duties of men to one another brought also into view and\nrecognition the rights of the lower orders of being. A sentiment against\ncruelty to animals of every kind had long been growing in civilized\nlands, and formed a distinct feature of the general softening of manners\nwhich led up to the Revolution. This sentiment now became an enthusiasm.\nThe new conception of our relation to the animals appealed to the heart\nand captivated the imagination of mankind. Instead of sacrificing the\nweaker races to our use or pleasure, with no thought for their welfare,\nit began to be seen that we should rather, as elder brothers in the great\nfamily of Nature, be, so far as possible, guardians and helpers to the\nweaker orders whose fate is in our hands and to which we are as gods. Do\nyou not see, Julian, how the prevalence of this new view might soon have\nled people to regard the eating of their fellow-animals as a revolting\npractice, almost akin to cannibalism?\"\n\n\"That is, of course, very easily understood. Indeed, doctor, you must not\nsuppose that my contemporaries were wholly without feeling on this\nsubject. Long before the Revolution was dreamed of there were a great\nmany persons of my acquaintance who owned to serious qualms over\nflesh-eating, and perhaps the greater part of refined persons were not\nwithout pangs of conscience at various times over the practice. The\ntrouble was, there really seemed nothing else to do. It was just like our\neconomic system. Humane persons generally admitted that it was very bad\nand brutal, and yet very few could distinctly see what the world was\ngoing to replace it with. You people seem to have succeeded in perfecting\na _cuisine_ without using flesh, and I admit it is every way more\nsatisfactory than ours was, but you can not imagine how absolutely\nimpossible the idea of getting on without the use of animal food looked\nin my day, when as yet nothing definite had been suggested to take its\nplace which offered any reasonable amount of gratification to the palate,\neven if it provided the means of aliment.\"\n\n\"I can imagine the difficulty to some extent. It was, as you say, like\nthat which so long hindered the change of economic systems. People could\nnot clearly realize what was to take its place. While one's mouth is full\nof one flavor it is difficult to imagine another. That lack of\nconstructive imagination on the part of the mass is the obstacle that has\nstood in the way of removing every ancient evil, and made necessary a\nwave of revolutionary force to do the work. Such a wave of feeling as I\nhave described was needful in this case to do away with the immemorial\nhabit of flesh-eating. As soon as the new attitude of men's minds took\naway their taste for flesh, and there was a demand that had to be\nsatisfied for some other and adequate sort of food, it seems to have been\nvery promptly met.\"\n\n\"From what source?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the doctor, \"chiefly from the vegetable world,\nthough by no means wholly. There had never been any serious attempt\nbefore to ascertain what its provisions for food actually were, still\nless what might be made of them by scientific treatment. Nor, as long as\nthere was no objection to killing some animal and appropriating without\ntrouble the benefit of its experiments, was there likely to be. The rich\nlived chiefly on flesh. As for the working masses, which had always drawn\ntheir vigor mainly from vegetables, nobody of the influential classes\ncared to make their lot more agreeable. Now, however, all with one\nconsent set about inquiring what sort of a table Nature might provide for\nmen who had forsworn murder.\n\n\"Just as the crude and simple method of slavery, first chattel slavery\nand afterward wage slavery, had, so long as it prevailed, prevented men\nfrom seeking to replace its crude convenience by a scientific industrial\nsystem, so in like manner the coarse convenience of flesh for food had\nhitherto prevented men from making a serious perquisition of Nature's\nedible resources. The delay in this respect is further accounted for by\nthe fact that the preparation of food, on account of the manner of its\nconduct as an industry, had been the least progressive of all the arts of\nlife.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" I said. \"The least progressive of arts? Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it had always been carried on as an isolated household industry,\nand as such chiefly left to servants or women, who in former times were\nthe most conservative and habit-bound class in the communities. The rules\nof the art of cookery had been handed down little changed in essentials\nsince the wife of the Aryan cowherd dressed her husband's food for him.\n\n\"Now, it must remain very doubtful how immediately successful the revolt\nagainst animal food would have proved if the average family cook, whether\nwife or hireling, had been left each for herself in her private kitchen\nto grapple with the problem of providing for the table a satisfactory\nsubstitute for flesh. But, thanks to the many-sided character of the\ngreat Revolution, the juncture of time at which the growth of humane\nfeeling created a revolt against animal food coincided with the complete\nbreakdown of domestic service and the demand of women for a wider life,\nfacts which compelled the placing of the business of providing and\npreparing food on a co-operative basis, and the making of it a branch of\nthe public service. So it was that as soon as men, losing appetite for\ntheir fellow-creatures, began to ask earnestly what else could be eaten,\nthere was already being organized a great governmental department\ncommanding all the scientific talent of the nation, and backed by the\nresources of the country, for the purpose of solving the question. And it\nis easy to believe that none of the new departments was stimulated in its\nefforts by a keener public interest than this which had in charge the\npreparation of the new national bill of fare. These were the conditions\nfor which alimentation had waited from the beginnings of the race to\nbecome a science.\n\n\"In the first place, the food materials and methods of preparing them\nactually extant, and used in the different nations, were, for the first\ntime in history, collected and collated. In presence of the cosmopolitan\nvariety and extent of the international _menu_ thus presented, every\nnational _cuisine_ was convicted of having until then run in a rut.\nIt was apparent that in nothing had the nations been more provincial,\nmore stupidly prejudiced against learning from one another, than in\nmatters of food and cooking. It was discovered, as observing travelers\nhad always been aware, that every nation and country, often every\nprovince, had half a dozen gastronomic secrets that had never crossed the\nborder, or at best on very brief excursions.\n\n\"It is well enough to mention, in passing, that the collation of this\ninternational bill of fare was only one illustration of the innumerable\nways in which the nations, as soon as the new order put an end to the old\nprejudices, began right and left to borrow and adopt the best of one\nanother's ideas and institutions, to the great general enrichment.\n\n\"But the organization of a scientific system of alimentation did not\ncease with utilizing the materials and methods already existing. The\nbotanist and the chemist next set about finding new food materials and\nnew methods of preparing them. At once it was discovered that of the\nnatural products capable of being used as food by man, but a petty\nproportion had ever been utilized; only those, and a small part even of\nthat class, which readily lent themselves to the single primitive process\nwhereby the race hitherto had attempted to prepare food--namely, the\napplication of dry or wet heat. To this, manifold other processes\nsuggested by chemistry were now added, with effects that our ancestors\nfound as delightful as novel. It had hitherto been with the science of\ncooking as with metallurgy when simple fire remained its only method.\n\n\"It is written that the children of Israel, when practicing an enforced\nvegetarian diet in the wilderness, yearned after the flesh-pots of Egypt,\nand probably with good reason. The experience of our ancestors appears to\nhave been in this respect quite different. It would seem that the\nsentiments with which, after a very short period had elapsed, they looked\nback upon the flesh-pots they had left behind were charged with a feeling\nquite the reverse of regret. There is an amusing cartoon of the period,\nwhich suggests how brief a time it took for them to discover what a good\nthing they had done for themselves in resolving to spare the animals. The\ncartoon, as I remember it, is in two parts. The first shows Humanity,\ntypified by a feminine figure regarding a group of animals consisting of\nthe ox, the sheep, and the hog. Her face expresses the deepest\ncompunction, while she tearfully exclaims, 'Poor things! How could we\never bring ourselves to eat you?' The second part reproduces the same\ngroup, with the heading 'Five Years After.' But here the countenance\nof Humanity as she regards the animals expresses not contrition or\nself-reproach, but disgust and loathing, while she exclaims in nearly\nidentical terms, but very different emphasis, 'How could we, indeed?'\"\n\nWHAT BECAME OF THE GREAT CITIES.\n\nContinuing to move westward toward the interior, we had now gradually\nleft behind the more thickly settled portions of the city, if indeed any\nportion of these modern cities, in which every home stands in its own\ninclosure, can be called thickly settled. The groves and meadows and\nlarger woods had become numerous, and villages occurred at frequent\nintervals. We were out in the country.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said I, \"it has so happened, you will remember, that what I\nhave seen of twentieth-century life has been mainly its city side. If\ncountry life has changed since my day as much as city life, it will be\nvery interesting to make its acquaintance again. Tell me something about\nit.\"\n\n\"There are few respects, I suppose,\" replied the doctor, \"in which the\neffect of the nationalization of production and distribution on the basis\nof economic equality has worked a greater transformation than in the\nrelations of city and country, and it is odd we should not have chanced\nto speak of this before now.\"\n\n\"When I was last in the world of living people,\" I said, \"the city was\nfast devouring the country. Has that process gone on, or has it possibly\nbeen reversed?\"\n\n\"Decidedly the latter,\" replied the doctor, \"as indeed you will at once\nsee must have been the case when you consider that the enormous growth of\nthe great cities of the past was entirely an economic consequence of the\nsystem of private capitalism, with its necessary dependence upon\nindividual initiative, and the competitive system.\"\n\n\"That is a new idea to me,\" I said.\n\n\"I think you will find it a very obvious one upon reflection,\" replied\nthe doctor. \"Under private capitalism, you see, there was no public or\ngovernmental system for organizing productive effort and distributing its\nresults. There was no general and unfailing machinery for bringing\nproducers and consumers together. Everybody had to seek his own\noccupation and maintenance on his own account, and success depended on\nhis finding an opportunity to exchange his labor or possessions for the\npossessions or labor of others. For this purpose the best place, of\ncourse, was where there were many people who likewise wanted to buy or\nsell their labor or goods. Consequently, when, owing either to accident\nor calculation, a mass of people were drawn together, others flocked to\nthem, for every such aggregation made a market place where, owing simply\nto the number of persons desiring to buy and sell, better opportunities\nfor exchange were to be found than where fewer people were, and the\ngreater the number of people the larger and better the facilities for\nexchange. The city having thus taken a start, the larger it became, the\nfaster it was likely to grow by the same logic that accounted for its\nfirst rise. The laborer went there to find the largest and steadiest\nmarket for his muscle, and the capitalist--who, being a conductor of\nproduction, desired the largest and steadiest labor market--went there\nalso. The capitalist trader went there to find the greatest group of\nconsumers of his goods within least space.\n\n\"Although at first the cities rose and grew, mainly because of the\nfacilities for exchange among their own citizens, yet presently the\nresult of the superior organization of exchange facilities made them\ncenters of exchange for the produce of the surrounding country. In this\nway those who lived in the cities had not only great opportunities to\ngrow rich by supplying the needs of the dense resident population, but\nwere able also to levy a tribute upon the products of the people in the\ncountry round about by compelling those products to pass through their\nhands on the way to the consumers, even though the consumers, like the\nproducers, lived in the country, and might be next door neighbors.\n\n\"In due course,\" pursued the doctor, \"this concentration of material\nwealth in the cities led to a concentration there of all the superior,\nthe refined, the pleasant, and the luxurious ministrations of life. Not\nonly did the manual laborers flock to the cities as the market where they\ncould best exchange their labor for the money of the capitalists, but the\nprofessional and learned class resorted thither for the same purpose. The\nlawyers, the pedagogues, the doctors, the rhetoricians, and men of\nspecial skill in every branch, went there as the best place to find the\nrichest and most numerous employers of their talents, and to make their\ncareers.\n\n\"And in like manner all who had pleasure to sell--the artists, the\nplayers, the singers, yes, and the courtesans also--flocked to the cities\nfor the same reasons. And those who desired pleasure and had wealth to\nbuy it, those who wished to enjoy life, either as to its coarse or\nrefined gratifications, followed the pleasure-givers. And, finally, the\nthieves and robbers, and those pre-eminent in the wicked arts of living\non their fellow-men, followed the throng to the cities, as offering them\nalso the best field for their talents. And so the cities became great\nwhirlpools, which drew to themselves all that was richest and best, and\nalso everything that was vilest, in the whole land.\n\n\"Such, Julian, was the law of the genesis and growth of the cities, and\nit was by necessary consequence the law of the shrinkage, decay, and\ndeath of the country and country life. It was only necessary that the era\nof private capitalism in America should last long enough for the rural\ndistricts to have been reduced to what they were in the days of the Roman\nEmpire, and of every empire which achieved full development--namely,\nregions whence all who could escape had gone to seek their fortune in the\ncities, leaving only a population of serfs and overseers.\n\n\"To do your contemporaries justice, they seemed themselves to realize\nthat the swallowing up of the country by the city boded no good to\ncivilization, and would apparently have been glad to find a cure for it,\nbut they failed entirely to observe that, as it was a necessary effect of\nprivate capitalism, it could only be remedied by abolishing that.\"\n\n\"Just how,\" said I, \"did the abolition of private capitalism and the\nsubstitution of a nationalized economic system operate to stop the growth\nof the cities?\"\n\n\"By abolishing the need of markets for the exchange of labor and\ncommodities,\" replied the doctor. \"The facilities of exchange organized\nin the cities under the private capitalists were rendered wholly\nsuperfluous and impertinent by the national organization of production\nand distribution. The produce of the country was no longer handled by or\ndistributed through the cities, except so far as produced or consumed\nthere. The quality of goods furnished in all localities, and the measure\nof industrial service required of all, was the same. Economic equality\nhaving done away with rich and poor, the city ceased to be a place where\ngreater luxury could be enjoyed or displayed than the country. The\nprovision of employment and of maintenance on equal terms to all took\naway the advantages of locality as helps to livelihood. In a word, there\nwas no longer any motive to lead a person to prefer city to country life,\nwho did not like crowds for the sake of being crowded. Under these\ncircumstances you will not find it strange that the growth of the cities\nceased, and their depopulation began from the moment the effects of the\nRevolution became apparent.\"\n\n\"But you have cities yet!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Certainly--that is, we have localities where population still remains\ndenser than in other places. None of the great cities of your day have\nbecome extinct, but their populations are but small fractions of what\nthey were.\"\n\n\"But Boston is certainly a far finer-looking city than in my day.\"\n\n\"All the modern cities are far finer and fairer in every way than their\npredecessors and infinitely fitter for human habitation, but in order to\nmake them so it was necessary to get rid of their surplus population.\nThere are in Boston to-day perhaps a quarter as many people as lived in\nthe same limits in the Boston of your day, and that is simply because\nthere were four times as many people within those limits as could be\nhoused and furnished with environments consistent with the modern idea of\nhealthful and agreeable living. New York, having been far worse crowded\nthan Boston, has lost a still larger proportion of its former population.\nWere you to visit Manhattan Island I fancy your first impression would be\nthat the Central Park of your day had been extended all the way from the\nBattery to Harlem River, though in fact the place is rather thickly built\nup according to modern notions, some two hundred and fifty thousand\npeople living there among the groves and fountains.\"\n\n\"And you say this amazing depopulation took place at once after the\nRevolution?\"\n\n\"It began then. The only way in which the vast populations of the old\ncities could be crowded into spaces so small was by packing them like\nsardines in tenement houses. As soon as it was settled that everybody\nmust be provided with really and equally good habitations, it followed\nthat the cities must lose the greater part of their population. These had\nto be provided with dwellings in the country. Of course, so vast a work\ncould not be accomplished instantly, but it proceeded with all possible\nspeed. In addition to the exodus of people from the cities because there\nwas no room for them to live decently, there was also a great outflow of\nothers who, now there had ceased to be any economic advantages in city\nlife, were attracted by the natural charms of the country; so that you\nmay easily see that it was one of the great tasks of the first decade\nafter the Revolution to provide homes elsewhere for those who desired to\nleave the cities. The tendency countryward continued until the cities\nhaving been emptied of their excess of people, it was possible to make\nradical changes in their arrangements. A large proportion of the old\nbuildings and all the unsightly, lofty, and inartistic ones were cleared\naway and replaced with structures of the low, broad, roomy style adapted\nto the new ways of living. Parks, gardens, and roomy spaces were\nmultiplied on every hand and the system of transit so modified as to get\nrid of the noise and dust, and finally, in a word, the city of your day\nwas changed into the modern city. Having thus been made as pleasant\nplaces to live in as was the country itself, the outflow of population\nfrom the cities ceased and an equilibrium became established.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" I observed, \"that under any circumstances cities must\nstill, on account of their greater concentration of people, have certain\nbetter public services than small villages, for naturally such\nconveniences are least expensive where a dense population is to be\nsupplied.\"\n\n\"As to that,\" replied the doctor, \"if a person desires to live in some\nremote spot far away from neighbors he will have to put up with some\ninconveniences. He will have to bring his supplies from the nearest\npublic store and dispense with various public services enjoyed by those\nwho live nearer together; but in order to be really out of reach of these\nservices he must go a good way off. You must remember that nowadays the\nproblems of communication and transportation both by public and private\nmeans have been so entirely solved that conditions of space which were\nprohibitive in your day are unimportant now. Villages five and ten miles\napart are as near together for purposes of social intercourse and\neconomic administration as the adjoining wards of your cities. Either on\ntheir own account or by group combinations with other communities\ndwellers in the smallest villages enjoy installations of all sorts of\npublic services as complete as exist in the cities. All have public\nstores and kitchens with telephone and delivery systems, public baths,\nlibraries, and institutions of the highest education. As to the quality\nof the services and commodities provided, they are of absolutely equal\nexcellence wherever furnished. Finally, by telephone and electroscope the\ndwellers in any part of the country, however deeply secluded among the\nforests or the mountains, may enjoy the theater, the concert, and the\norator quite as advantageously as the residents of the largest cities.\"\n\nTHE REFORESTING.\n\nStill we swept on mile after mile, league after league, toward the\ninterior, and still the surface below presented the same parklike aspect\nthat had marked the immediate environs of the city. Every natural feature\nappeared to have been idealized and all its latent meaning brought out by\nthe loving skill of some consummate landscape artist, the works of man\nblending with the face of Nature in perfect harmony. Such arrangements of\nscenery had not been uncommon in my day, when great cities prepared\ncostly pleasure grounds, but I had never imagined anything on a scale\nlike this.\n\n\"How far does this park extend?\" I demanded at last. \"There seems no end\nto it.\"\n\n\"It extends to the Pacific Ocean,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Do you mean that the whole United States is laid out in this way?\"\n\n\"Not precisely in this way by any means, but in a hundred different ways\naccording to the natural suggestions of the face of the country and the\nmost effective way of co-operating with them. In this region, for\ninstance, where there are few bold natural features, the best effect to\nbe obtained was that of a smiling, peaceful landscape with as much\ndiversification in detail as possible. In the mountainous regions, on the\ncontrary, where Nature has furnished effects which man's art could not\nstrengthen, the method has been to leave everything absolutely as Nature\nleft it, only providing the utmost facilities for travel and observation.\nWhen you visit the White Mountains or the Berkshire Hills you will find,\nI fancy, their slopes shaggier, the torrents wilder, the forests loftier\nand more gloomy than they were a hundred years ago. The only evidences of\nman's handiwork to be found there are the roadways which traverse every\ngorge and top every summit, carrying the traveler within reach of all the\nwild, rugged, or beautiful bits of Nature.\"\n\n\"As far as forests go, it will not be necessary for me to visit the\nmountains in order to perceive that the trees are not only a great deal\nloftier as a rule, but that there are vastly more of them than formerly.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor, \"it would be odd if you did not notice that\ndifference in the landscape. There are said to be five or ten trees\nnowadays where there was one in your day, and a good part of those you\nsee down there are from seventy-five to a hundred years old, dating from\nthe reforesting.\"\n\n\"What was the reforesting?\" I asked.\n\n\"It was the restoration of the forests after the Revolution. Under\nprivate capitalism the greed or need of individuals had led to so general\na wasting of the woods that the streams were greatly reduced and the land\nwas constantly plagued with droughts. It was found after the Revolution\nthat one of the things most urgent to be done was to reforest the\ncountry. Of course, it has taken a long time for the new plantings to\ncome to maturity, but I believe it is now some twenty-five years since\nthe forest plan reached its full development and the last vestiges of the\nformer ravages disappeared.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I said presently, \"that one feature which is missing from\nthe landscape impresses me quite as much as any that it presents?\"\n\n\"What is it that is missing?\"\n\n\"The hayfield.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, no wonder you miss it,\" said the doctor. \"I understand that in\nyour day hay was the main crop of New England?\"\n\n\"Altogether so,\" I replied, \"and now I suppose you have no use for hay at\nall. Dear me, in what a multitude of important ways the passing of the\nanimals out of use both for food and work must have affected human\noccupations and interests!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said the doctor, \"and always to the notable improvement of\nthe social condition, though it may sound ungrateful to say so. Take the\ncase of the horse, for example. With the passing of that long-suffering\nservant of man to his well earned reward, smooth, permanent, and clean\nroadways first became possible; dust, dirt, danger, and discomfort ceased\nto be necessary incidents of travel.\n\n\"Thanks to the passing of the horse, it was possible to reduce the\nbreadth of roadways by half or a third, to construct them of smooth\nconcrete from grass to grass, leaving no soil to be disturbed by wind or\nwater, and such ways once built, last like Roman roads, and can never be\novergrown by vegetation. These paths, penetrating every nook and corner\nof the land, have, together with the electric motors, made travel such a\nluxury that as a rule we make all short journeys, and when time does not\npress even very long ones, by private conveyance. Had land travel\nremained in the condition it was in when it depended on the horse, the\ninvention of the air-car would have strongly tempted humanity to treat\nthe earth as the birds do--merely as a place to alight on between\nflights. As it is, we consider the question an even one whether it is\npleasanter to swim through the air or to glide over the ground, the\nmotion being well-nigh as swift, noiseless, and easy in one case as in\nthe other.\"\n\n\"Even before 1887,\" I said, \"the bicycle was coming into such favor and\nthe possibilities of electricity were beginning so to loom up that\nprophetic people began to talk about the day of the horse as almost over.\nBut it was believed that, although dispensed with for road purposes, he\nmust always remain a necessity for the multifarious purposes of farm\nwork, and so I should have supposed. How is it about that?\"\n\nTWENTIETH-CENTURY FARMING.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" replied the doctor; \"when we have descended a little I\nwill give you a practical answer.\"\n\nAfter we had dropped from an altitude of perhaps a thousand feet to a\ncouple of hundred, the doctor said:\n\n\"Look down there to the right.\"\n\nI did so, and saw a large field from which the crops had been cut. Over\nits surface was moving a row of great machines, behind which the earth\nsurged up in brown and rigid billows. On each machine stood or sat in\neasy attitude a young man or woman with quite the air of persons on a\npleasure excursion.\n\n\"Evidently,\" I said, \"these are plows, but what drives them?\"\n\n\"They are electric plows,\" replied the doctor. \"Do you see that snakelike\ncord trailing away over the broken ground behind each machine? That is\nthe cable by which the force is supplied. Observe those posts at regular\nintervals about the field. It is only necessary to attach one of those\ncables to a post to have a power which, connected with any sort of\nagricultural machine, furnishes energy graduated from a man's strength to\nthat of a hundred horses, and requiring for its guidance no other force\nthan the fingers of a child can supply.\"\n\nAnd not only this, but it was further explained to me that by this system\nof flexible cables of all sizes the electric power was applied not only\nto all the heavy tasks formerly done by animals, but also to the hand\ninstruments--the spade, the shovel, and the fork--which the farmer in my\ntime must bend his own back to, however well supplied he might be with\nhorse power. There was, indeed, no tool, however small, the doctor\nexplained, whether used in agriculture or any other art, to which this\nmotor was not applicable, leaving to the worker only the adjustment and\nguiding of the instrument.\n\n\"With one of our shovels,\" said the doctor, \"an intelligent boy can\nexcavate a trench or dig a mile of potatoes quicker than a gang of men in\nyour day, and with no more effort than he would use in wheeling a\nbarrow.\"\n\nI had been told several times that at the present day farm work was\nconsidered quite as desirable as any other occupation, but, with my\nimpressions as to the peculiar arduousness of the earth worker's task, I\nhad not been able to realize how this could really be so. It began to\nseem possible.\n\nThe doctor suggested that perhaps I would like to land and inspect some\nof the arrangements of a modern farm, and I gladly assented. But first he\ntook advantage of our elevated position to point out the network of\nrailways by which all the farm transportation was done and whereby the\ncrops when gathered could, if desirable, be shipped directly, without\nfurther handling, to any point in the country. Having alighted from our\ncar, we crossed the field toward the nearest of the great plows, the\nrider of which was a dark-haired young woman daintily costumed, such a\nfigure certainly as no nineteenth-century farm field ever saw. As she sat\ngracefully upon the back of the shining metal monster which, as it\nadvanced, tore up the earth with terrible horns, I could but be reminded\nof Europa on her bull. If her prototype was as charming as this young\nwoman, Jupiter certainly was excusable for running away with her.\n\nAs we approached, she stopped the plow and pleasantly returned our\ngreeting. It was evident that she recognized me at the first glance, as,\nthanks doubtless to the diffusion of my portrait, everybody seemed to do.\nThe interest with which she regarded me would have been more flattering\nhad I not been aware that I owed it entirely to my character as a freak\nof Nature and not at all to my personality.\n\nWhen I asked her what sort of a crop they were expecting to plant at this\nseason, she replied that this was merely one of the many annual plowings\ngiven to all soil to keep it in condition.\n\n\"We use, of course, abundant fertilizers,\" she said, \"but consider the\nsoil its own best fertilizer if kept moving.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"labor is the best fertilizer of the soil. So old an\nauthority as Aesop taught us that in his fable of 'The Buried Treasure,'\nbut it was a terribly expensive sort of fertilizer in my day when it had\nto come out of the muscles of men and beasts. One plowing a year was all\nour farmers could manage, and that nearly broke their backs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I have read of those poor men. Now you see it is\ndifferent. So long as the tides rise and fall twice a day, let alone the\nwinds and waterfalls, there is no reason why we should not plow every day\nif it were desirable. I believe it is estimated that about ten times the\namount of power is nowadays given to the working of every acre of land\nthat it was possible to apply in former times.\"\n\nWe spent some time inspecting the farm. The doctor explained the drainage\nand pumping systems by which both excess and deficiency of rain are\nguarded against, and gave me opportunity to examine in detail some of the\nwonderful tools he had described, which make practically no requisition\non the muscle of the worker, only needing a mind behind them.\n\nConnected with the farm was one of the systems of great greenhouse\nestablishments upon which the people depend for fresh vegetables in the\nwinter, and this, too, we visited. The wonders of intensive culture which\nI saw in that great structure would of course astonish none of my\nreaders, but to me the revelation of what could be done with plants when\nall the conditions of light, heat, moisture, and soil ingredients were\nabsolutely to be commanded, was a never-to-be-forgotten experience. It\nseemed to me that I had stolen into the very laboratory of the Creator,\nand found him at the task of fashioning with invisible hands the dust of\nthe earth and the viewless air into forms of life. I had never seen\nplants actually grow before and had deemed the Indian juggler's trick an\nimposture. But here I saw them lifting their heads, putting forth their\nbuds, and opening their flowers by movements which the eye could follow.\nI confess that I fairly listened to hear them whisper.\n\n\"In my day, greenhouse culture of vegetables out of season had been\ncarried on only to an extent to meet the demands of a small class of very\nrich. The idea of providing such supplies at moderate prices for the\nentire community, according to the modern practice, was of course quite\nundreamed of.\"\n\nWhen we left the greenhouse the afternoon had worn away and the sun was\nsetting. Rising swiftly to a height where its rays still warmed us, we\nset out homeward.\n\nStrongest of all the impressions of that to me so wonderful afternoon\nthere lingered most firmly fixed in my mind the latest--namely, the\nobject lesson I had received of the transformation in the conditions of\nagriculture, the great staple human occupation from the beginning, and\nthe basis of every industrial system. Presently I said:\n\n\"Since you have so successfully done away with the first of the two main\ndrawbacks of the agricultural occupation as known in my day--namely, its\nexcessive laboriousness--you have no doubt also known how to eliminate\nthe other, which was the isolation, the loneliness, the lack of social\nintercourse and opportunity of social culture which were incident to the\nfarmer's life.\"\n\n\"Nobody would certainly do farm work,\" replied the doctor, \"if it had\ncontinued to be either more lonesome or more laborious than other sorts\nof work. As regards the social surroundings of the agriculturist, he is\nin no way differently situated from the artisan or any other class of\nworkers. He, like the others, lives where he pleases, and is carried to\nand fro just as they are between the place of his residence and\noccupation by the lines of swift transit with which the country is\nthreaded. Work on a farm no longer implies life on a farm, unless for\nthose who like it.\"\n\n\"One of the conditions of the farmer's life, owing to the variations of\nthe season,\" I said, \"has always been the alternation of slack work and\nperiods of special exigency, such as planting and harvesting, when the\nsudden need of a multiplied labor force has necessitated the severest\nstrain of effort for a time. This alternation of too little with too much\nwork, I should suppose, would still continue to distinguish agriculture\nfrom other occupations.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied the doctor, \"but this alternation, far from involving\neither a wasteful relaxation of effort or an excessive strain on the\nworker, furnishes occasions of recreation which add a special attraction\nto the agricultural occupation. The seasons of planting and harvesting\nare of course slightly or largely different in the several districts of a\ncountry so extensive as this. The fact makes it possible successively to\nconcentrate in each district as large an extra contingent of workers\ndrawn from other districts as is needed. It is not uncommon on a few\ndays' notice to throw a hundred thousand extra workers into a region\nwhere there is a special temporary demand for labor. The inspiration of\nthese great mass movements is remarkable, and must be something like that\nwhich attended in your day the mobilizing and marching of armies to war.\"\n\nWe drifted on for a space in silence through the darkening sky.\n\n\"Truly, Julian,\" said the doctor at length, \"no industrial transformation\nsince your day has been so complete, and none surely has affected so\ngreat a proportion of the people, as that which has come over\nagriculture. The poets from Virgil up and down have recognized in rural\npursuits and the cultivation of the earth the conditions most favorable\nto a serene and happy life. Their fancies in this respect have, however,\nuntil the present time, been mocked by the actual conditions of\nagriculture, which have combined to make the lot of the farmer, the\nsustainer of all the world, the saddest, most difficult, and most\nhopeless endured by any class of men. From the beginning of the world\nuntil the last century the tiller of the soil has been the most pathetic\nfigure in history. In the ages of slavery his was the lowest class of\nslaves. After slavery disappeared his remained the most anxious, arduous,\nand despairing of occupations. He endured more than the poverty of the\nwage-earner without his freedom from care, and all the anxiety of the\ncapitalist without his hope of compensating profits. On the one side he\nwas dependent for his product, as was no other class, upon the caprices\nof Nature, while on the other in disposing of it he was more completely\nat the mercy of the middleman than any other producer. Well might he\nwonder whether man or Nature were the more heartless. If the crops\nfailed, the farmer perished; if they prospered, the middleman took the\nprofit. Standing as a buffer between the elemental forces and human\nsociety, he was smitten by the one only to be thrust back by the other.\nBound to the soil, he fell into a commercial serfdom to the cities\nwell-nigh as complete as the feudal bondage had been. By reason of his\nisolated and unsocial life he was uncouth, unlettered, out of touch with\nculture, without opportunities for self-improvement, even if his bitter\ntoil had left him energy or time for it. For this reason the dwellers in\nthe towns looked down upon him as one belonging to an inferior race. In\nall lands, in all ages, the countryman has been considered a proper butt\nby the most loutish townsman. The starving proletarian of the city\npavement scoffed at the farmer as a boor. Voiceless, there was none to\nspeak for him, and his rude, inarticulate complaints were met with jeers.\nBaalam was not more astonished when the ass he was riding rebuked him\nthan the ruling classes of America seem to have been when the farmers,\ntoward the close of the last century, undertook to have something to say\nabout the government of the country.\n\n\"From time to time in the progress of history the condition of the farmer\nhas for brief periods been tolerable. The yeoman of England was once for\na little while one who looked nobles in the face. Again, the American\nfarmer, up to the middle of the nineteenth century, enjoyed the golden\nage of agriculture. Then for a space, producing chiefly for use and not\nfor sale to middlemen, he was the most independent of men and enjoyed a\nrude abundance. But before the nineteenth century had reached its last\nthird, American agriculture had passed through its brief idyllic period,\nand, by the inevitable operation of private capitalism, the farmer began\nto go down hill toward the condition of serfdom, which in all ages before\nhad been his normal state, and must be for evermore, so long as the\neconomic exploitation of men by men should continue. While in one sense\neconomic equality brought an equal blessing to all, two classes had\nespecial reason to hail it as bringing to them a greater elevation from a\ndeeper degradation than to any others. One of these classes was the\nwomen, the other the farmers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nWHAT STARTED THE REVOLUTION.\n\nWhat did I say to the theater for that evening? was the question with\nwhich Edith met me when we reached home. It seemed that a celebrated\nhistorical drama of the great Revolution was to be given in Honolulu that\nafternoon, and she had thought I might like to see it.\n\n\"Really you ought to attend,\" she said, \"for the presentation of the play\nis a sort of compliment to you, seeing that it is revived in response to\nthe popular interest in revolutionary history which your presence has\naroused.\"\n\nNo way of spending the evening could have been more agreeable to me, and\nit was agreed that we should make up a family theater party.\n\n\"The only trouble,\" I said, as we sat around the tea table, \"is that I\ndon't know enough yet about the Revolution to follow the play very\nintelligently. Of course, I have heard revolutionary events referred to\nfrequently, but I have no connected idea of the Revolution as a whole.\"\n\n\"That will not matter,\" said Edith. \"There is plenty of time before the\nplay for father to tell you what is necessary. The matinee does not begin\ntill three in the afternoon at Honolulu, and as it is only six now the\ndifference in time will give us a good hour before the curtain rises.\"\n\n\"That's rather a short time, as well as a short notice, for so big a task\nas explaining the great Revolution,\" the doctor mildly protested, \"but\nunder the circumstances I suppose I shall have to do the best I can.\"\n\n\"Beginnings are always misty,\" he said, when I straightway opened at him\nwith the question when the great Revolution began. \"Perhaps St. John\ndisposed of that point in the simplest way when he said that 'in the\nbeginning was God.' To come down nearer, it might be said that Jesus\nChrist stated the doctrinal basis and practical purpose of the great\nRevolution when he declared that the golden rule of equal and the best\ntreatment for all was the only right principle on which people could live\ntogether. To speak, however, in the language of historians, the great\nRevolution, like all important events, had two sets of causes--first, the\ngeneral, necessary, and fundamental cause which must have brought it\nabout in the end, whatever the minor circumstances had been; and, second,\nthe proximate or provoking causes which, within certain limits,\ndetermined when it actually did take place, together with the incidental\nfeatures. These immediate or provoking causes were, of course, different\nin different countries, but the general, necessary, and fundamental cause\nwas the same in all countries, the great Revolution being, as you know,\nworld-wide and nearly simultaneous, as regards the more advanced nations.\n\n\"That cause, as I have often intimated in our talks, was the growth of\nintelligence and diffusion of knowledge among the masses, which,\nbeginning with the introduction of printing, spread slowly through the\nsixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, and much more rapidly\nduring the nineteenth, when, in the more favored countries, it began, to\nbe something like general. Previous to the beginning of this process of\nenlightenment the condition of the mass of mankind as to intelligence,\nfrom the most ancient times, had been practically stationary at a point\nlittle above the level of the brutes. With no more thought or will of\ntheir own than clay in the hands of the potter, they were unresistingly\nmolded to the uses of the more intelligent and powerful individuals and\ngroups of their kind. So it went on for innumerable ages, and nobody\ndreamed of anything else until at last the conditions were ripe for the\ninbreathing of an intellectual life into these inert and senseless clods.\nThe process by which this awakening took place was silent, gradual,\nimperceptible, but no previous event or series of events in the history\nof the race had been comparable to it in the effect it was to have upon\nhuman destiny. It meant that the interest of the many instead of the few,\nthe welfare of the whole instead of that of a part, were henceforth to be\nthe paramount purpose of the social order and the goal of its evolution.\n\n\"Dimly your nineteenth-century philosophers seem to have perceived that\nthe general diffusion of intelligence was a new and large fact, and that\nit introduced a very important force into the social evolution, but they\nwere wall-eyed in their failure to see the certainty with which it\nforeshadowed a complete revolution of the economic basis of society in\nthe interest of the whole body of the people as opposed to class interest\nor partial interest of every sort. Its first effect was the democratic\nmovement by which personal and class rule in political matters was\noverthrown in the name of the supreme interest and authority of the\npeople. It is astonishing that there should have been any intelligent\npersons among you who did not perceive that political democracy was but\nthe pioneer corps and advance guard of economic democracy, clearing the\nway and providing the instrumentality for the substantial part of the\nprogramme--namely, the equalization of the distribution of work and\nwealth. So much for the main, general, and necessary cause and\nexplanation of the great Revolution--namely, the progressive diffusion of\nintelligence among the masses from the sixteenth to the end of the\nnineteenth centuries. Given this force in operation, and the revolution\nof the economic basis of society must sooner or later have been its\noutcome everywhere: whether a little sooner or later and in just what way\nand with just what circumstances, the differing conditions of different\ncountries determined.\n\n\"In the case of America, the period of revolutionary agitation which\nresulted in the establishment of the present order began almost at once\nupon the close of the civil war. Some historians date the beginning of\nthe Revolution from 1873.\"\n\n\"Eighteen seventy-three!\" I exclaimed; \"why, that was more than a dozen\nyears before I fell asleep! It seems, then, that I was a contemporary and\nwitness of at least a part of the Revolution, and yet I saw no\nRevolution. It is true that we recognized the highly serious condition of\nindustrial confusion and popular discontent, but we did not realize that\na Revolution was on.\"\n\n\"It was to have been expected that you would not,\" replied the doctor.\n\"It is very rarely that the contemporaries of great revolutionary\nmovements have understood their nature until they have nearly run their\ncourse. Following generations always think that they would have been\nwiser in reading the signs of the times, but that is not likely.\"\n\n\"But what was there,\" I said, \"about 1873 which has led historians to\ntake it as the date from which to reckon the beginning of the\nRevolution?\"\n\n\"Simply the fact that it marked in a rather distinct way the beginning of\na period of economic distress among the American people, which continued,\nwith temporary and partial alleviations, until the overthrow of private\ncapitalism. The popular discontent resulting from this experience was the\nprovoking cause of the Revolution. It awoke Americans from their\nself-complacent dream that the social problem had been solved or could be\nsolved by a system of democracy limited to merely political forms, and\nset them to seeking the true solution.\n\n\"The economic distress beginning at the last third of the century, which\nwas the direct provocation of the Revolution, was very slight compared\nwith that which had been the constant lot and ancient heritage of other\nnations. It represented merely the first turn or two of the screw by\nwhich capitalism in due time squeezed dry the masses always and\neverywhere. The unexampled space and richness of their new land had given\nAmericans a century's respite from the universal fate. Those advantages\nhad passed, the respite was ended, and the time had come when the people\nmust adapt their necks to the yoke all peoples before had worn. But\nhaving grown high-spirited from so long an experience of comparative\nwelfare, the Americans resisted the imposition, and, finding mere\nresistance vain, ended by making a revolution. That in brief is the whole\nstory of the way the great Revolution came on in America. But while this\nmight satisfy a languid twentieth-century curiosity as to a matter so\nremote in time, you will naturally want a little more detail. There is a\nparticular chapter in Storiot's History of the Revolution explaining just\nhow and why the growth of the power of capital provoked the great\nuprising, which deeply impressed me in my school days, and I don't think\nI can make a better use of a part of our short time than by reading a few\nparagraphs from it.\"\n\nAnd Edith having brought the book from the library--for we still sat at\nthe tea table--the doctor read:\n\n\"'With reference to the evolution of the system of private capitalism to\nthe point where it provoked the Revolution by threatening the lives and\nliberties of the people, historians divide the history of the American\nRepublic, from its foundation in 1787 to the great Revolution which made\nit a true republic, into three periods.\n\n\"'The first comprises the decades from the foundation of the republic to\nabout the end of the first third of the nineteenth century--say, up to\nthe thirties or forties. This was the period during which the power of\ncapital in private hands had not as yet shown itself seriously\naggressive. The moneyed class was small and the accumulations of capital\npetty. The vastness of the natural resources of the virgin country defied\nas yet the lust of greed. The ample lands to be had for the taking\nguaranteed independence to all at the price of labor. With this resource\nno man needed to call another master. This may be considered the idyllic\nperiod of the republic, the time when De Tocqueville saw and admired it,\nthough not without prescience of the doom that awaited it. The seed of\ndeath was in the state in the principle of private capitalism, and was\nsure in time to grow and ripen, but as yet the conditions were not\nfavorable to its development. All seemed to go well, and it is not\nstrange that the American people indulged in the hope that their republic\nhad indeed solved the social question.\n\n\"'From about 1830 or 1840, speaking of course in a general way as\nto date, we consider the republic to have entered on its second\nphase--namely, that in which the growth and concentration of capital\nbegan to be rapid. The moneyed class now grew powerful, and began to\nreach out and absorb the natural resources of the country and to organize\nfor its profit the labor of the people. In a word, the growth of the\nplutocracy became vigorous. The event which gave the great impulse to\nthis movement, and fixed the time of the transition from the first to the\nsecond period in the history of the nation, was of course the general\napplication of steam to commerce and industry. The transition may indeed\nbe said to have begun somewhat earlier, with the introduction of the\nfactory system. Of course, if neither steam nor the inventions which made\nthe factory system possible had ever been introduced, it would have been\nmerely a question of a longer time before the capitalist class,\nproceeding in this case by landlordism and usury, would have reduced the\nmasses to vassalage, and overthrown democracy even as in the ancient\nrepublics, but the great inventions amazingly accelerated the plutocratic\nconquest. For the first time in history the capitalist in the subjugation\nof his fellows had machinery for his ally, and a most potent one it was.\nThis was the mighty factor which, by multiplying the power of capital and\nrelatively dwarfing the importance of the workingman, accounts for the\nextraordinary rapidity with which, during the second and third periods\nthe conquest of the republic by the plutocracy was carried out.\n\n\"'It is a fact creditable to Americans that they appear to have begun to\nrealize as early as the forties that new and dangerous tendencies were\naffecting the republic and threatening to falsify its promise of a wide\ndiffusion of welfare. That decade is notable in American history for the\npopular interest taken in the discussion of the possibility of a better\nsocial order, and for the numerous experiments undertaken to test the\nfeasibility of dispensing with the private capitalist by co-operative\nindustry. Already the more intelligent and public-spirited citizens were\nbeginning to observe that their so-called popular government did not seem\nto interfere in the slightest degree with the rule of the rich and the\nsubjection of the masses to economic masters, and to wonder, if that were\nto continue to be so, of exactly how much value the so-called republican\ninstitutions were on which they had so prided themselves.\n\n\"'This nascent agitation of the social question on radical lines was,\nhowever, for the time destined to prove abortive by force of a condition\npeculiar to America--namely, the existence on a vast scale of African\nchattel slavery in the country. It was fitting in the evolution of\ncomplete human liberty that this form of bondage, cruder and more brutal,\nif not on the whole more cruel, than wage slavery, should first be put\nout of the way. But for this necessity and the conditions that produced\nit, we may believe that the great Revolution would have occurred in\nAmerica twenty-five years earlier. From the period of 1840 to 1870 the\nslavery issue, involving as it did a conflict of stupendous forces,\nabsorbed all the moral and mental as well as physical energies of the\nnation.\n\n\"'During the thirty or forty years from the serious beginning of the\nantislavery movement till the war was ended and its issues disposed of,\nthe nation had no thought to spare for any other interests. During this\nperiod the concentration of capital in few hands, already alarming to the\nfar-sighted in the forties, had time, almost unobserved and quite\nunresisted, to push its conquest of the country and the people. Under\ncover of the civil war, with its preceding and succeeding periods of\nagitation over the issues of the war, the capitalists may be said to have\nstolen a march upon the nation and intrenched themselves in a commanding\nposition.\n\n\"'Eighteen seventy-three is the point, as near as any date, at which the\ncountry, delivered at last from the distracting ethical, and sectional\nissues of slavery, first began to open its eyes to the irrepressible\nconflict which the growth of capitalism had forced--a conflict between\nthe power of wealth and the democratic idea of the equal right of all to\nlife, liberty, and happiness. From about this time we date, therefore,\nthe beginning of the final or revolutionary period of the pseudo-American\nRepublic which resulted in the establishment of the present system.\n\n\"'History had furnished abundant previous illustrations of the overthrow\nof republican societies by the growth and concentration of private\nwealth, but never before had it recorded a revolution in the economic\nbasis of a great nation at once so complete and so swiftly effected. In\nAmerica before the war, as we have seen, wealth had been distributed with\na general effect of evenness never previously known in a large community.\nThere had been few rich men and very few considerable fortunes. It had\nbeen in the power neither of individuals nor a class, through the\npossession of overwhelming capital, to exercise oppression upon the rest\nof the community. In the short space of twenty-five to thirty years these\neconomic conditions had been so completely reversed as to give America in\nthe seventies and eighties the name of the land of millionaires, and make\nit famous to the ends of the earth as the country of all others where the\nvastest private accumulations of wealth existed. The consequences of this\namazing concentration of wealth formerly so equally diffused, as it had\naffected the industrial, the social, and the political interests of the\npeople, could not have been other than revolutionary.\n\n\"'Free competition in business had ceased to exist. Personal initiative\nin industrial enterprises, which formerly had been open to all, was\nrestricted to the capitalists, and to the larger capitalists at that.\nFormerly known all over the world as the land of opportunities, America\nhad in the time of a generation become equally celebrated as the land of\nmonopolies. A man no longer counted chiefly for what he was, but for what\nhe had. Brains and industry, if coupled with civility, might indeed win\nan upper servant's place in the employ of capital, but no longer could\ncommand a career.\n\n\"'The concentration of the economic administration of the country in the\nhands of a comparatively small body of great capitalists had necessarily\nconsolidated and centralized in a corresponding manner all the functions\nof production and distribution. Single great concerns, backed by enormous\naggregations of capital, had appropriated tracts of the business field\nformerly occupied by innumerable smaller concerns. In this process, as a\nmatter of course, swarms of small businesses were crushed like flies, and\ntheir former independent proprietors were fortunate to find places as\nunderlings in the great establishments which had supplanted them.\nStraight through the seventies and eighties, every month, every week,\nevery day saw some fresh province of the economic state, some new branch\nof industry or commerce formerly open to the enterprise of all, captured\nby a combination of capitalists and turned into an intrenched camp of\nmonopoly. The words _syndicate_ and _trust_ were coined to\ndescribe these monstrous growths, for which the former language of the\nbusiness world had no name.\n\n\"'Of the two great divisions of the working masses it would be hard to\nsay whether the wage-earner or the farmer had suffered most by the\nchanged order. The old personal relationship and kindly feeling between\nemployee and employer had passed away. The great aggregations of capital\nwhich had taken the place of the former employers were impersonal forces,\nwhich knew the worker no longer as a man, but as a unit of force. He was\nmerely a tool in the employ of a machine, the managers of which regarded\nhim as a necessary nuisance, who must unfortunately be retained at the\nleast possible expense, until he could be invented wholly out of\nexistence by some new mechanical contrivance.\n\n\"'The economic function and possibilities of the farmer had similarly\nbeen dwarfed or cut off as a result of the concentration of the business\nsystem of the country in the hands of a few. The railroads and the grain\nmarket had, between them, absorbed the former profits of farming, and\nleft the farmer only the wages of a day laborer in case of a good crop,\nand a mortgage debt in case of a bad one; and all this, moreover, coupled\nwith the responsibilities of a capitalist whose money was invested in his\nfarm. This latter responsibility, however, did not long continue to\ntrouble the farmer, for, as naturally might be supposed, the only way he\ncould exist from year to year under such conditions was by contracting\ndebts without the slightest prospect of paying them, which presently led\nto the foreclosure of his land, and his reduction from the once proud\nestate of an American farmer to that of a tenant on his way to become a\npeasant.\n\n\"'From 1873 to 1896 the histories quote some six distinct business\ncrises. The periods of rallying between them were, however, so brief that\nwe may say a continuous crisis existed during a large part of that\nperiod. Now, business crises had been numerous and disastrous in the\nearly and middle epoch of the republic, but the business system, resting\nat that time on a widely extended popular initiative, had shown itself\nquickly and strongly elastic, and the rallies that promptly followed the\ncrashes had always led to a greater prosperity than that before enjoyed.\nBut this elasticity, with the cause of it, was now gone. There was little\nor slow reaction after the crises of the seventies, eighties, and early\nnineties, but, on the contrary, a scarcely interrupted decline of prices,\nwages, and the general prosperity and content of the farming and\nwage-earning masses.\n\n\"'There could not be a more striking proof of the downward tendency in\nthe welfare of the wage-earner and the farmer than the deteriorating\nquality and dwindling volume of foreign immigration which marked the\nperiod. The rush of European emigrants to the United States as the land\nof promise for the poor, since its beginning half a century before, had\ncontinued with increasing volume, and drawn to us a great population from\nthe best stocks of the Old World. Soon after the war the character of the\nimmigration began to change, and during the eighties and nineties came to\nbe almost entirely made up of the lowest, most wretched, and barbarous\nraces of Europe--the very scum of the continent. Even to secure these\nwretched recruits the agents of the transatlantic steamers and the\nAmerican land syndicates had to send their agents all over the worst\ndistricts of Europe and flood the countries with lying circulars. Matters\nhad come to the point that no European peasant or workingman, who was yet\nabove the estate of a beggar or an exile, could any longer afford to\nshare the lot of the American workingman and farmer, so little time\nbefore the envy of the toiling world.\n\n\"'While the politicians sought, especially about election time, to cheer\nthe workingman with the assurance of better times just ahead, the more\nserious economic writers seem to have frankly admitted that the\nsuperiority formerly enjoyed by American workingmen over those of other\ncountries could not be expected to last longer, that the tendency\nhenceforward was to be toward a world-wide level of prices and\nwages--namely, the level of the country where they were lowest. In\nkeeping with this prediction we note that for the first time, about the\nbeginning of the nineties, the American employer began to find himself,\nthrough the reduced cost of production in which wages were the main\nelement, in a position to undersell in foreign markets the products of\nthe slave gangs of British, Belgian, French, and German capitalists.\n\n\"'It was during this period, when the economic distress of the masses was\ncreating industrial war and making revolutionists of the most contented\nand previously prosperous agricultural population in history, that the\nvastest private fortunes in the history of the world were being\naccumulated. The millionaire, who had been unknown before the war and was\nstill an unusual and portentous figure in the early seventies, was\npresently succeeded by the multimillionaire, and above the\nmultimillionaires towered yet a new race of economic Titans, the hundred\nmillionaires, and already the coming of the billionaire was being\ndiscussed. It is not difficult, nor did the people of the time find it\nso, to see, in view of this comparison, where the wealth went which the\nmasses were losing. Tens of thousands of modest competencies disappeared,\nto reappear in colossal fortunes in single hands. Visibly as the body of\nthe spider swells as he sucks the juices of his victims, had these vast\naggregations grown in measure as the welfare of the once prosperous\npeople had shrunk away.\n\n\"'The social consequences of so complete an overthrow of the former\neconomic equilibrium as had taken place could not have been less than\nrevolutionary. In America, before the war, the accumulations of wealth\nwere usually the result of the personal efforts of the possessor and were\nconsequently small and correspondingly precarious. It was a saying of the\ntime that there were usually but three generations from shirt-sleeves to\nshirt-sleeves--meaning that if a man accumulated a little wealth, his son\ngenerally lost it, and the grandson was again a manual laborer. Under\nthese circumstances the economic disparities, slight at most and\nconstantly fluctuating, entirely failed to furnish a basis for class\ndistinctions. There were recognized no laboring class as such, no leisure\nclass, no fixed classes of rich and poor. Riches or poverty, the\ncondition of being at leisure or obliged to work were considered merely\ntemporary accidents of fortune and not permanent conditions. All this was\nnow changed. The great fortunes of the new order of things by their very\nmagnitude were stable acquisitions, not easily liable to be lost, capable\nof being handed down from generation to generation with almost as much\nsecurity as a title of nobility. On the other hand, the monopolization of\nall the valuable economic opportunities in the country by the great\ncapitalists made it correspondingly impossible for those not of the\ncapitalist class to attain wealth. The hope of becoming rich some day,\nwhich before the war every energetic American had cherished, was now\npractically beyond the horizon of the man born to poverty. Between rich\nand poor the door was henceforth shut. The way up, hitherto the social\nsafety valve, had been closed, and the bar weighted with money bags.\n\n\"'A natural reflex of the changed social conditions of the country is\nseen in the new class terminology, borrowed from the Old World, which\nsoon after the war crept into use in the United States. It had been the\nboast of the former American that everybody in this country was a\nworkingman; but now that term we find more and more frankly employed to\ndistinguish the poor from the well-to-do. For the first time in American\nliterature we begin to read of the lower classes, the upper classes, and\nthe middle classes--terms which would have been meaningless in America\nbefore the war, but now corresponded so closely with the real facts of\nthe situation that those who detested them most could not avoid their\nuse.\n\n\"'A prodigious display of luxury such as Europe could not rival had begun\nto characterize the manner of life of the possessors of the new and\nunexampled fortunes. Spectacles of gilded splendor, of royal pomp and\nboundless prodigality mocked the popular discontent and brought out in\ndazzling light the width and depth of the gulf that was being fixed\nbetween the masters and the masses.\n\n\"'Meanwhile the money kings took no pains to disguise the fullness of\ntheir conviction that the day of democracy was passing and the dream of\nequality nearly at an end. As the popular feeling in America had grown\nbitter against them they had responded with frank indications of their\ndislike of the country and disgust with its democratic institutions. The\nleading American millionaires had become international personages,\nspending the greater part of their time and their revenue in European\ncountries, sending their children there for education and in some\ninstances carrying their preference for the Old World to the extent of\nbecoming subjects of foreign powers. The disposition on the part of the\ngreater American capitalists to turn their backs upon democracy and ally\nthemselves with European and monarchical institutions was emphasized in a\nstriking manner by the long list of marriages arranged during this period\nbetween great American heiresses and foreign noblemen. It seemed to be\nconsidered that the fitting destiny for the daughter of an American\nmultimillionaire was such a union. These great capitalists were very\nshrewd in money matters, and their investments of vast sums in the\npurchase of titles for their posterity was the strongest evidence they\ncould give of a sincere conviction that the future of the world, like its\npast, belonged not to the people but to class and privilege.\n\n\"'The influence exercised over the political government by the moneyed\nclass under the convenient euphemism of \"the business interests,\" which\nmerely meant the interests of the rich, had always been considerable, and\nat times caused grave scandals. In measure as the wealth of the country\nhad become concentrated and allied, its influence in the government had\nnaturally increased, and during the seventies, eighties, and nineties it\nbecame a scarcely veiled dictatorship. Lest the nominal representatives\nof the people should go astray in doing the will of the capitalists, the\nlatter were represented by bodies of picked agents at all the places of\ngovernment. These agents closely followed the conduct of all public\nofficials, and wherever there was any wavering in their fidelity to the\ncapitalists, were able to bring to bear influences of intimidation or\nbribery which were rarely unsuccessful. These bodies of agents had a\nrecognized semi-legal place in the political system of the day under the\nname of lobbyists.\n\n\"'The history of government contains few more shameful chapters than that\nwhich records how during this period the Legislatures--municipal, State,\nand national--seconded by the Executives and the courts, vied with each\nother by wholesale grants of land, privileges, franchises, and monopolies\nof all kinds, in turning over the country, its resources, and its people\nto the domination of the capitalists, their heirs and assigns forever.\nThe public lands, which a few decades before had promised a boundless\ninheritance to future generations, were ceded in vast domains to\nsyndicates and individual capitalists, to be held against the people as\nthe basis of a future territorial aristocracy with tributary populations\nof peasants. Not only had the material substance of the national\npatrimony been thus surrendered to a handful of the people, but in the\nfields of commerce and of industry all the valuable economic\nopportunities had been secured by franchises to monopolies, precluding\nfuture generations from opportunity of livelihood or employment, save as\nthe dependents and liegemen of a hereditary capitalist class. In the\nchronicles of royal misdoings there have been many dark chapters\nrecording how besotted or imbecile monarchs have sold their people into\nbondage and sapped the welfare of their realms to enrich licentious\nfavorites, but the darkest of those chapters is bright beside that which\nrecords the sale of the heritage and hopes of the American people to the\nhighest bidder by the so-called democratic State, national, and local\ngovernments during the period of which we are speaking.\n\n\"'Especially necessary had it become for the plutocracy to be able to use\nthe powers of government at will, on account of the embittered and\ndesperate temper of the working masses.\n\n\"'The labor strikes often resulted in disturbances too extensive to be\ndealt with by the police, and it became the common practice of the\ncapitalists, in case of serious strikes, to call on the State and\nnational governments to furnish troops to protect their property\ninterest. The principal function of the militia of the States had become\nthe suppression of strikes with bullet or bayonet, or the standing guard\nover the plants of the capitalists, till hunger compelled the insurgent\nworkmen to surrender.\n\n\"'During the eighties the State governments entered upon a general policy\nof preparing the militia for this new and ever-enlarging field of\nusefulness. The National Guard was turned into a Capitalist Guard. The\nforce was generally reorganized, increased in numbers, improved in\ndiscipline, and trained with especial reference to the business of\nshooting riotous workingmen. The drill in street firing--a quite new\nfeature in the training of the American militiaman, and a most ominous\none--became the prominent test of efficiency. Stone and brick armories,\nfortified against attack, loopholed for musketry and mounted with guns to\nsweep the streets, were erected at the strategic points of the large\ncities. In some instances the militia, which, after all, was pretty near\nthe people, had, however, shown such unwillingness to fire on strikers\nand such symptoms of sympathy for their grievances, that the capitalists\ndid not trust them fully, but in serious cases preferred to depend on the\npitiless professional soldiers of the General Government, the regulars.\nConsequently, the Government, upon request of the capitalists, adopted\nthe policy of establishing fortified camps near the great cities, and\nposting heavy garrisons in them. The Indian wars were ceasing at about\nthis time, and the troops that had been stationed on the Western plains\nto protect the white settlements from the Indians were brought East to\nprotect the capitalists from the white settlements. Such was the\nevolution of private capitalism.\n\n\"'The extent and practical character of the use to which the capitalists\nintended to put the military arm of the Government in their controversy\nwith the workingmen may be judged from the fact that in single years of\nthe early nineties armies of eight and ten thousand men were on the\nmarch, in New York and Pennsylvania, to suppress strikes. In 1892 the\nmilitia of five States, aided by the regulars, were under arms against\nstrikers simultaneously, the aggregate force of troops probably making a\nlarger body than General Washington ever commanded. Here surely was civil\nwar already.\n\n\"'Americans of the former days had laughed scornfully at the\nbayonet-propped monarchies of Europe, saying rightly that a government\nwhich needed to be defended by force from its own people was a\nself-confessed failure. To this pass, however, the industrial system of\nthe United States was fast coming--it was becoming a government by\nbayonets.\n\n\"'Thus briefly, and without attempt at detail, may be recapitulated some\nof the main aspects of the transformation in the condition of the\nAmerican people, resulting from the concentration of the wealth of the\ncountry, which first began to excite serious alarm at the close of the\ncivil war.\n\n\"'It might almost be said that the citizen armies of the North had\nreturned from saving the republic from open foes, to find that it had\nbeen stolen from them by more stealthy but far more dangerous enemies\nwhom they had left at home. While they had been putting down caste rule\nbased on race at the South, class rule based on wealth had been set up at\nthe North, to be in time extended over South and North alike. While the\narmies of the people had been shedding rivers of blood in the effort to\npreserve the political unity of the nation, its social unity, upon which\nthe very life of a republic depends, had been attacked by the beginnings\nof class divisions, which could only end by splitting the once coherent\nnation into mutually suspicious and inimical bodies of citizens,\nrequiring the iron bands of despotism to hold them together in a\npolitical organization. Four million negroes had indeed been freed from\nchattel slavery, but meanwhile a nation of white men had passed under the\nyoke of an economic and social vassalage which, though the common fate of\nEuropean peoples and of the ancient world, the founders of the republic\nhad been proudly confident their posterity would never wear.'\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doctor closed the book from which he had been reading and laid it\ndown.\n\n\"Julian,\" he said, \"this story of the subversion of the American Republic\nby the plutocracy is an astounding one. You were a witness of the\nsituation it describes, and are able to judge whether the statements are\nexaggerated.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"I should think you had been reading aloud\nfrom a collection of newspapers of the period. All the political, social,\nand business facts and symptoms to which the writer has referred were\nmatters of public discussion and common notoriety. If they did not\nimpress me as they do now, it is simply because I imagine I never heard\nthem grouped and marshaled with the purpose of bringing out their\nsignificance.\"\n\nOnce more the doctor asked Edith to bring him a book from the library.\nTurning the pages until he had found the desired place, he said:\n\n\"Lest you should fancy that the force of Storiot's statement of the\neconomic situation in the United States during the last third of the\nnineteenth century owes anything to the rhetorical arrangement, I want to\ngive you just a few hard, cold statistics as to the actual distribution\nof property during that period, showing the extent to which its ownership\nhad been concentrated. Here is a volume made up of information on this\nsubject based upon analyses of census reports, tax assessments, the files\nof probate courts, and other official documents. I will give you three\nsets of calculations, each prepared by a separate authority and based\nupon a distinct line of investigation, and all agreeing with a closeness\nwhich, considering the magnitude of the calculation, is astounding, and\nleaves no room to doubt the substantial accuracy of the conclusions.\n\n\"From the first set of tables, which was prepared in 1893 by a census\nofficial from the returns of the United States census, we find it\nestimated that out of sixty-two billions of wealth in the country a group\nof millionaires and multimillionaires, representing three one-hundredths\nof one per cent of the population, owned twelve billions, or one fifth.\nThirty-three billions of the rest was owned by a little less than nine\nper cent of the American people, being the rich and well-to-do class less\nthan millionaires. That is, the millionaires, rich, and well-to-do,\nmaking altogether but nine per cent of the whole nation, owned forty-five\nbillions of the total national valuation of sixty-two billions. The\nremaining ninety-one per cent of the whole nation, constituting the bulk\nof the people, were classed as the poor, and divided among themselves the\nremaining seventeen million dollars.\n\n\"A second table, published in 1894 and based upon the surrogates' records\nof estates in the great State of New York, estimates that one per cent of\nthe people, one one-hundredth of the nation, possessed over half, or\nfifty-five per cent, of its total wealth. It finds that a further\nfraction of the population, including the well-to-do, and amounting to\neleven per cent, owned over thirty-two per cent of the total wealth, so\nthat twelve per cent of the whole nation, including the very rich and the\nwell-to-do, monopolized eighty-seven per cent of the total wealth of the\ncountry, leaving but thirteen per cent of that wealth to be shared among\nthe remaining eighty-eight per cent of the nation. This eighty-eight per\ncent of the nation was subdivided into the poor and the very poor. The\nlast, constituting fifty per cent out of the eighty-eight, or half the\nentire nation, had too little wealth to be estimated at all, apparently\nliving a hand-to-mouth existence.\n\n\"The estimates of a third computator whom I shall quote, although taken\nfrom quite different data, agree remarkably with the others, representing\nas they do about the same period. These last estimates, which were\npublished in 1889 and 1891, and like the others produced a strong\nimpression, divide the nation into three classes--the rich, the middle,\nand the working class. The rich, being one and four tenths per cent of\nthe population, are credited with seventy per cent of the total wealth.\nThe middle class, representing nine and two tenths per cent of the\npopulation, is credited with twelve per cent of the total wealth, the\nrich and middle classes, together, representing ten and six tenths per\ncent of the population, having therefore eighty-two per cent of the total\nwealth, leaving to the working class, which constituted eighty-nine and\nfour tenths of the nation, but eighteen per cent of the wealth, to share\namong them.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I exclaimed, \"I knew things were pretty unequally divided in my\nday, but figures like these are overwhelming. You need not take the\ntrouble to tell me anything further by way of explaining why the people\nrevolted against private capitalism. These figures were enough to turn\nthe very stones into revolutionists.\"\n\n\"I thought you would say so,\" replied the doctor. \"And please remember\nalso that these tremendous figures represent only the progress made\ntoward the concentration of wealth mainly within the period of a single\ngeneration. Well might Americans say to themselves 'If such things are\ndone in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?' If private\ncapitalism, dealing with a community in which had previously existed a\ndegree of economic equality never before known, could within a period of\nsome thirty years make such a prodigious stride toward the complete\nexpropriation of the rest of the nation for the enrichment of a class,\nwhat was likely to be left to the people at the end of a century? What\nwas to be left even to the next generation?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nWHY THE REVOLUTION WENT SLOW AT FIRST BUT FAST AT LAST.\n\n\"So much for the causes of the Revolution in America, both the general\nfundamental cause, consisting in the factor newly introduced into social\nevolution by the enlightenment of the masses and irresistibly tending to\nequality, and the immediate local causes peculiar to America, which\naccount for the Revolution having come at the particular time it did and\nfor its taking the particular course it did. Now, briefly as to that\ncourse:\n\n\"The pinching of the economic shoe resulting from the concentration of\nwealth was naturally first felt by the class with least reserves, the\nwage-earners, and the Revolution may be said to have begun with their\nrevolt. In 1869 the first great labor organization in America was formed\nto resist the power of capital. Previous to the war the number of strikes\nthat had taken place in the country could be counted on the fingers.\nBefore the sixties were out they were counted by hundreds, during the\nseventies by thousands, and during the eighties the labor reports\nenumerate nearly ten thousand, involving two or three million workers.\nMany of these strikes were of continental scope, shaking the whole\ncommercial fabric and causing general panics.\n\n\"Close after the revolt of the wage earners came that of the\nfarmers--less turbulent in methods but more serious and abiding in\nresults. This took the form of secret leagues and open political parties\ndevoted to resisting what was called the money power. Already in the\nseventies these organizations threw State and national politics into\nconfusion, and later became the nucleus of the revolutionary party.\n\n\"Your contemporaries of the thinking classes can not be taxed with\nindifference to these signs and portents. The public discussion and\nliterature of the time reflect the confusion and anxiety with which the\nunprecedented manifestations of popular discontent had affected all\nserious persons. The old-fashioned Fourth-of-July boastings had ceased to\nbe heard in the land. All agreed that somehow republican forms of\ngovernment had not fulfilled their promise as guarantees of the popular\nwelfare, but were showing themselves impotent to prevent the\nrecrudescence in the New World of all the Old World's evils, especially\nthose of class and caste, which it had been supposed could never exist in\nthe atmosphere of a republic. It was recognized on all sides that the old\norder was changing for the worse, and that the republic and all it had\nbeen thought to stand for was in danger. It was the universal cry that\nsomething must be done to check the ruinous tendency. Reform was the word\nin everybody's mouth, and the rallying cry, whether in sincerity or\npretense, of every party. But indeed, Julian, I need waste no time\ndescribing this state of affairs to you, for you were a witness of it\ntill 1887.\"\n\n\"It was all quite as you describe it, the industrial and political\nwarfare and turmoil, the general sense that the country was going wrong,\nand the universal cry for some sort of reform. But, as I said before, the\nagitation, while alarming enough, was too confused and purposeless to\nseem revolutionary. All agreed that something ailed the country, but no\ntwo agreed what it was or how to cure it.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the doctor. \"Our historians divide the entire\nrevolutionary epoch--from the close of the war, or the beginning of the\nseventies, to the establishment of the present order early in the\ntwentieth century--into two periods, the incoherent and the rational. The\nfirst of these is the period of which we have been talking, and with\nwhich Storiot deals with in the paragraphs I have read--the period with\nwhich you were, for the most part, contemporary. As we have seen, and you\nknow better than we can, it was a time of terror and tumult, of confused\nand purposeless agitation, and a Babel of contradictory clamor. The\npeople were blindly kicking in the dark against the pricks of capitalism,\nwithout any clear idea of what they were kicking against.\n\n\"The two great divisions of the toilers, the wage-earners and the\nfarmers, were equally far from seeing clear and whole the nature\nof the situation and the forces of which they were the victims. The\nwage-earners' only idea was that by organizing the artisans and manual\nworkers their wages could be forced up and maintained indefinitely. They\nseem to have had absolutely no more knowledge than children of the effect\nof the profit system always and inevitably to keep the consuming power of\nthe community indefinitely below its producing power and thus to maintain\na constant state of more or less aggravated glut in the goods and labor\nmarkets, and that nothing could possibly prevent the constant presence of\nthese conditions so long as the profit system was tolerated, or their\neffect finally to reduce the wage-earner to the subsistence point or\nbelow as profits tended downward. Until the wage-earners saw this and no\nlonger wasted their strength in hopeless or trivial strikes against\nindividual capitalists which could not possibly affect the general\nresult, and united to overthrow the profit system, the Revolution must\nwait, and the capitalists had no reason to disturb themselves.\n\n\"As for the farmers, as they were not wage-earners, they took no\ninterest in the plans of the latter, which aimed merely to benefit the\nwage-earning class, but devoted themselves to equally futile schemes for\ntheir class, in which, for the same reason that they were merely class\nremedies, the wage-earners took no interest. Their aim was to obtain aid\nfrom the Government to improve their condition as petty capitalists\noppressed by the greater capitalists who controlled the traffic and\nmarkets of the country; as if any conceivable device, so long as private\ncapitalism should be tolerated, would prevent its natural evolution,\nwhich was the crushing of the smaller capitalists by the larger.\n\n\"Their main idea seems to have been that their troubles as farmers were\nchiefly if not wholly to be accounted for by certain vicious acts of\nfinancial legislation, the effect of which they held had been to make\nmoney scarce and dear. What they demanded as the sufficient cure of the\nexisting evils was the repeal of the vicious legislation and a larger\nissue of currency. This they believed would be especially beneficial to\nthe farming class by reducing the interest on their debts and raising the\nprice of their product.\n\n\"Undoubtedly the currency and the coinage and the governmental financial\nsystem in general had been shamelessly abused by the capitalists to\ncorner the wealth of the nation in their hands, but their misuse of this\npart of the economic machinery had been no worse than their manipulation\nof the other portions of the system. Their trickery with the currency had\nonly helped them to monopolize the wealth of the people a little faster\nthan they would have done it had they depended for their enrichment on\nwhat were called the legitimate operations of rent, interest, and\nprofits. While a part of their general policy of economic subjugation of\nthe people, the manipulation of the currency had not been essential to\nthat policy, which would have succeeded just as certainly had it been\nleft out. The capitalists were under no necessity to juggle with the\ncoinage had they been content to make a little more leisurely process of\ndevouring the lands and effects of the people. For that result no\nparticular form of currency system was necessary, and no conceivable\nmonetary system would have prevented it. Gold, silver, paper, dear money,\ncheap money, hard money, bad money, good money--every form of token from\ncowries to guineas--had all answered equally well in different times and\ncountries for the designs of the capitalist, the details of the game\nbeing only slightly modified according to the conditions.\n\n\"To have convinced himself of the folly of ascribing the economic\ndistress to which his class as well as the people at large had been\nreduced, to an act of Congress relating to the currency, the American\nfarmer need only have looked abroad to foreign lands, where he would have\nseen that the agricultural class everywhere was plunged in a misery\ngreater than his own, and that, too, without the slightest regard to the\nnature of the various monetary systems in use.\n\n\"Was it indeed a new or strange phenomenon in human affairs that the\nagriculturists were going to the wall, that the American farmer should\nseek to account for the fact by some new and peculiarly American policy?\nOn the contrary, this had been the fate of the agricultural class in all\nages, and what was now threatening the American tiller of the soil was\nnothing other than the doom which had befallen his kind in every previous\ngeneration and in every part of the world. Manifestly, then, he should\nseek the explanation not in any particular or local conjunction of\ncircumstances, but in some general and always operative cause. This\ngeneral cause, operative in all lands and times and among all races, he\nwould presently see when he should interrogate history, was the\nirresistible tendency by which the capitalist class in the evolution of\nany society through rent, interest, and profits absorbs to itself the\nwhole wealth of the country, and thus reduces the masses of the people to\neconomic, social, and political subjection, the most abject class of all\nbeing invariably the tillers of the soil. For a time the American\npopulation, including the farmers, had been enabled, thanks to the vast\nbounty of a virgin and empty continent, to evade the operation of this\nuniversal law, but the common fate was now about to overtake them, and\nnothing would avail to avert it save the overthrow of the system of\nprivate capitalism of which it always had been and always must be the\nnecessary effect.\n\n\"Time would fail even to mention the innumerable reform nostrums offered\nfor the cure of the nation by smaller bodies of reformers. They ranged\nfrom the theory of the prohibitionists that the chief cause of the\neconomic distress--from which the teetotal farmers of the West were the\nworst sufferers--was the use of intoxicants, to that of the party which\nagreed that the nation was being divinely chastised because there was no\nformal recognition of the Trinity in the Constitution. Of course, these\nwere extravagant persons, but even those who recognized the concentration\nof wealth as the cause of the whole trouble quite failed to see that this\nconcentration was itself the natural evolution of private capitalism, and\nthat it was not possible to prevent it or any of its consequences unless\nand until private capitalism itself should be put an end to.\n\n\"As might be expected, efforts at resistance so ill calculated as these\ndemonstrations of the wage-earners and farmers, not to speak of the host\nof petty sects of so-called reformers during the first phase of the\nRevolution, were ineffectual. The great labor organizations which had\nsprung up shortly after the war as soon as the wage-earners felt the\nnecessity of banding themselves to resist the yoke of concentrated\ncapital, after twenty-five years of fighting, had demonstrated their\nutter inability to maintain, much less to improve, the condition of the\nworkingman. During this period ten or fifteen thousand recorded strikes\nand lock-outs had taken place, but the net result of the industrial civil\nwar, protracted through so long a period, had been to prove to the\ndullest of workingmen the hopelessness of securing any considerable\namelioration of their lot by class action or organization, or indeed of\neven maintaining it against encroachments. After all this unexampled\nsuffering and fighting, the wage-earners found themselves worse off than\never. Nor had the farmers, the other great division of the insurgent\nmasses, been any more successful in resisting the money power. Their\nleagues, although controlling votes by the million, had proved even more\nimpotent if possible than the wage-earners' organizations to help their\nmembers. Even where they had been apparently successful and succeeded in\ncapturing the political control of states, they found the money power\nstill able by a thousand indirect influences to balk their efforts and\nturn their seeming victories into apples of Sodom, which became ashes in\nthe hands of those who would pluck them.\n\n\"Of the vast, anxious, and anguished volume of public discussion as to\nwhat should be done, what after twenty-five years had been the practical\noutcome? Absolutely nothing. If here and there petty reforms had been\nintroduced, on the whole the power of the evils against which those\nreforms were directed had vastly increased. If the power of the\nplutocracy in 1873 had been as the little finger of a man, in 1895 it was\nthicker than his loins. Certainly, so far as superficial and material\nindications went, it looked as if the battle had been going thus far\nsteadily, swiftly, and hopelessly against the people, and that the\nAmerican capitalists who expended their millions in buying titles of\nnobility for their children were wiser in their generation than the\nchildren of light and better judges of the future.\n\n\"Nevertheless, no conclusion could possibly have been more mistaken.\nDuring these decades of apparently unvaried failure and disaster the\nrevolutionary movement for the complete overthrow of private capitalism\nhad made a progress which to rational minds should have presaged its\ncomplete triumph in the near future.\"\n\n\"Where had the progress been?\" I said; \"I don't see any.\"\n\n\"In the development among, the masses of the people of the necessary\nrevolutionary temper,\" replied the doctor; \"in the preparation of the\npopular mind by the only process that could have prepared it, to accept\nthe programme of a radical reorganization of the economic system from the\nground up. A great revolution, you must remember, which is to profoundly\nchange a form of society, must accumulate a tremendous moral force, an\noverwhelming weight of justification, so to speak, behind it before it\ncan start. The processes by which and the period during which this\naccumulation of impulse is effected are by no means so spectacular as the\nevents of the subsequent period when the revolutionary movement, having\nobtained an irresistible momentum, sweeps away like straws the obstacles\nthat so long held it back only to swell its force and volume at last. But\nto the student the period of preparation is the more truly interesting\nand critical field of study. It was absolutely necessary that the\nAmerican people, before they would seriously think of undertaking so\ntremendous a reformation as was implied in the substitution of public for\nprivate capitalism, should be fully convinced not by argument only, but\nby abundant bitter experience and convincing object lessons, that no\nremedy for the evils of the time less complete or radical would suffice.\nThey must become convinced by numerous experiments that private\ncapitalism had evolved to a point where it was impossible to amend it\nbefore they would listen to the proposition to end it. This painful but\nnecessary experience the people were gaining during the earlier decades\nof the struggle. In this way the innumerable defeats, disappointments,\nand fiascoes which met their every effort at curbing and reforming the\nmoney power during the seventies, eighties, and early nineties,\ncontributed far more than as many victories would have done to the\nmagnitude and completeness of the final triumph of the people. It was\nindeed necessary that all these things should come to pass to make the\nRevolution possible. It was necessary that the system of private and\nclass tyranny called private capitalism should fill up the measure of its\niniquities and reveal all it was capable of, as the irreconcilable enemy\nof democracy, the foe of life and liberty and human happiness, in order\nto insure that degree of momentum to the coming uprising against it which\nwas necessary to guarantee its complete and final overthrow. Revolutions\nwhich start too soon stop too soon, and the welfare of the race demanded\nthat this revolution should not cease, nor pause, until the last vestige\nof the system by which men usurped power over the lives and liberties of\ntheir fellows through economic means was destroyed. Therefore not one\noutrage, not one act of oppression, not one exhibition of conscienceless\nrapacity, not one prostitution of power on the part of Executive,\nLegislature, or judiciary, not one tear of patriotic shame over the\ndegradation of the national name, not one blow of the policeman's\nbludgeon, not a single bullet or bayonet thrust of the soldiery, could\nhave been spared. Nothing but just this discipline of failure,\ndisappointment, and defeat on the part of the earlier reformers could\nhave educated the people to the necessity of attacking the system of\nprivate capitalism in its existence instead of merely in its particular\nmanifestations.\n\n\"We reckon the beginning of the second part of the revolutionary movement\nto which we give the name of the coherent or rational phase, from the\ntime when there became apparent a clear conception, on the part of at\nleast a considerable body of the people, of the true nature of the issue\nas one between the rights of man and the principle of irresponsible power\nembodied in private capitalism, and the realization that its outcome, if\nthe people were to triumph, must be the establishment of a wholly new\neconomic system which should be based upon the public control in the\npublic interest of the system of production and distribution hitherto\nleft to private management.\"\n\n\"At about what date,\" I asked, \"do you consider that the revolutionary\nmovement began to pass from the incoherent into the logical phase?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the doctor, \"it was not the case of an immediate\noutright change of character, but only of the beginning of a new spirit\nand intelligence. The confusion and incoherence and short-sightedness of\nthe first period long overlapped the time when the infusion of a more\nrational spirit and adequate ideal began to appear, but from about the\nbeginning of the nineties we date the first appearance of an intelligent\npurpose in the revolutionary movement and the beginning of its\ndevelopment from a mere formless revolt against intolerable conditions\ninto a logical and self-conscious evolution toward the order of to-day.\"\n\n\"It seems I barely missed it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"if you had been able to keep awake only a\nyear or two longer you would not have been so wholly surprised by our\nindustrial system, and especially by the economic equality for and by\nwhich it exists, for within a couple of years after your supposed demise\nthe possibility that such a social order might be the outcome of the\nexisting crisis was being discussed from one end of America to the other.\n\n\"Of course,\" the doctor went on, \"the idea of an integrated economic\nsystem co-ordinating the efforts of all for the common welfare, which is\nthe basis of the modern state, is as old as philosophy. As a theory it\ndates back to Plato at least, and nobody knows how much further, for it\nis a conception of the most natural and obvious order. Not, however,\nuntil popular government had been made possible by the diffusion of\nintelligence was the world ripe for the realization of such a form of\nsociety. Until that time the idea, like the soul waiting for a fit\nincarnation, must remain without social embodiment. Selfish rulers\nthought of the masses only as instruments for their own aggrandizement,\nand if they had interested themselves in a more exact organization of\nindustry it would only have been with a view of making that organization\nthe means of a more complete tyranny. Not till the masses themselves\nbecame competent to rule was a serious agitation possible or desirable\nfor an economic organization on a co-operative basis. With the first\nstirrings of the democratic spirit in Europe had come the beginning of\nearnest discussion as to the feasibility of such a social order. Already,\nby the middle of the century, this agitation in the Old World had become,\nto discerning eyes, one of the signs of the times, but as yet America, if\nwe except the brief and abortive social experiments in the forties, had\nremained wholly unresponsive to the European movement.\n\n\"I need not repeat that the reason, of course, was the fact that the\neconomic conditions in America had been more satisfactory to the masses\nthan ever before, or anywhere else in the world. The individualistic\nmethod of making a living, every man for himself, had answered the\npurpose on the whole so well that the people did not care to discuss\nother methods. The powerful motive necessary to rouse the sluggish and\nhabit-bound minds of the masses and interest them in a new and\nrevolutionary set of ideas was lacking. Even during the early stage of\nthe revolutionary period it had been found impossible to obtain any\nhearing for the notions of a new economic order which were already\nagitating Europe. It was not till the close of the eighties that the\ntotal and ridiculous failure of twenty years of desperate efforts to\nreform the abuses of private capitalism had prepared the American people\nto give serious attention to the idea of dispensing with the capitalist\naltogether by a public organization of industry to be administered like\nother common affairs in the common interest.\n\n\"The two great points of the revolutionary programme--the principle of\neconomic equality and a nationalized industrial system as its means and\npledge--the American people were peculiarly adapted to understand and\nappreciate. The lawyers had made a Constitution of the United States, but\nthe true American constitution--the one written on the people's\nhearts--had always remained the immortal Declaration with its assertion\nof the inalienable equality of all men. As to the nationalization of\nindustry, while it involved a set of consequences which would completely\ntransform society, the principle on which the proposition was based, and\nto which it appealed for justification, was not new to Americans in any\nsense, but, on the contrary, was merely a logical development of the idea\nof popular self-government on which the American system was founded. The\napplication of this principle to the regulation of the economic\nadministration was indeed a use of it which was historically new, but it\nwas one so absolutely and obviously implied in the content of the idea\nthat, as soon as it was proposed, it was impossible that any sincere\ndemocrat should not be astonished that so plain and common-sense a\ncorollary of popular government had waited so long for recognition. The\napostles of a collective administration of the economic system in the\ncommon interest had in Europe a twofold task: first, to teach the general\ndoctrine of the absolute right of the people to govern, and then to show\nthe economic application of that right. To Americans, however, it was\nonly necessary to point out an obvious although hitherto overlooked\napplication of a principle already fully accepted as an axiom.\n\n\"The acceptance of the new ideal did not imply merely a change in\nspecific programmes, but a total facing about of the revolutionary\nmovement. It had thus far been an attempt to resist the new economic\nconditions being imposed by the capitalists by bringing back the former\neconomic conditions through the restoration of free competition as it had\nexisted before the war. This was an effort of necessity hopeless, seeing\nthat the economic changes which had taken place were merely the necessary\nevolution of any system of private capitalism, and could not be\nsuccessfully resisted while the system was retained.\n\n\"'Face about!' was the new word of command. 'Fight forward, not backward!\nMarch with the course of economic evolution, not against it. The\ncompetitive system can never be restored, neither is it worthy of\nrestoration, having been at best an immoral, wasteful, brutal scramble\nfor existence. New issues demand new answers. It is in vain to pit the\nmoribund system of competition against the young giant of private\nmonopoly; it must rather be opposed by the greater giant of public\nmonopoly. The consolidation of business in private interests must be met\nwith greater consolidation in the public interest, the trust and the\nsyndicate with the city, State, and nation, capitalism with nationalism.\nThe capitalists have destroyed the competitive system. Do not try to\nrestore it, but rather thank them for the work, if not the motive, and\nset about, not to rebuild the old village of hovels, but to rear on the\ncleared place the temple humanity so long has waited for.'\n\n\"By the light of the new teaching the people began to recognize that the\nstrait place into which the republic had come was but the narrow and\nfrowning portal of a future of universal welfare and happiness such as\nonly the Hebrew prophets had colors strong enough to paint.\n\n\"By the new philosophy the issue which had arisen between the people and\nthe plutocracy was seen not to be a strange and unaccountable or\ndeplorable event, but a necessary phase in the evolution of a democratic\nsociety in passing from a lower to an incomparably higher plane, an issue\ntherefore to be welcomed not shunned, to be forced not evaded, seeing\nthat its outcome in the existing state of human enlightenment and\nworld-wide democratic sentiment could not be doubtful. By the road by\nwhich every republic had toiled upward from the barren lowlands of early\nhardship and poverty, just at the point where the steepness of the hill\nhad been overcome and a prospect opened of pleasant uplands of wealth and\nprosperity, a sphinx had ever stood, propounding the riddle, 'How shall a\nstate combine the preservation of democratic equality with the increase\nof wealth?' Simple indeed had been the answer, for it was only needful\nthat the people should so order their system of economy that wealth\nshould be equally shared as it increased, in order that, however great\nthe increase, it should in no way interfere with the equalities of the\npeople; for the great justice of equality is the well of political life\neverlasting for peoples, whereof if a nation drink it may live forever.\nNevertheless, no republic before had been able to answer the riddle, and\ntherefore their bones whitened the hilltop, and not one had ever survived\nto enter on the pleasant land in view. But the time had now come in the\nevolution of human intelligence when the riddle so often asked and never\nanswered was to be answered aright, the sphinx made an end of, and the\nroad freed forever for all the nations.\n\n\"It was this note of perfect assurance, of confident and boundless hope,\nwhich distinguished the new propaganda, and was the more commanding and\nuplifting from its contrast with the blank pessimism on the one side of\nthe capitalist party, and the petty aims, class interests, short vision,\nand timid spirit of the reformers who had hitherto opposed them.\n\n\"With a doctrine to preach of so compelling force and beauty, promising\nsuch good things to men in so great want of them, it might seem that it\nwould require but a brief time to rally the whole people to its support.\nAnd so it would doubtless have been if the machinery of public\ninformation and direction had been in the hands of the reformers or in\nany hands that were impartial, instead of being, as it was, almost wholly\nin those of the capitalists. In previous periods the newspapers had not\nrepresented large investments of capital, having been quite crude\naffairs. For this very reason, however, they were more likely to\nrepresent the popular feeling. In the latter part of the nineteenth\ncentury a great newspaper with large circulation necessarily required a\nvast investment of capital, and consequently the important newspapers of\nthe country were owned by capitalists and of course carried on in the\nowners' interests. Except when the capitalists in control chanced to be\nmen of high principle, the great papers were therefore upon the side of\nthe existing order of things and against the revolutionary movement.\nThese papers monopolized the facilities of gathering and disseminating\npublic intelligence and thereby exercised a censorship, almost as\neffective as that prevailing at the same time in Russia or Turkey, over\nthe greater part of the information which reached the people.\n\n\"Not only the press but the religious instruction of the people was under\nthe control of the capitalists. The churches were the pensioners of the\nrich and well-to-do tenth of the people, and abjectly dependent on them\nfor the means of carrying on and extending their work. The universities\nand institutions of higher learning were in like manner harnessed to the\nplutocratic chariot by golden chains. Like the churches, they were\ndependent for support and prosperity upon the benefactions of the rich,\nand to offend them would have been suicidal. Moreover, the rich and\nwell-to-do tenth of the population was the only class which could afford\nto send children to institutions of the secondary education, and they\nnaturally preferred schools teaching a doctrine comfortable to the\npossessing class.\n\n\"If the reformers had been put in possession of press, pulpit, and\nuniversity, which the capitalists controlled, whereby to set home their\ndoctrine to the heart and mind and conscience of the nation, they would\nhave converted and carried the country in a month.\n\n\"Feeling how quickly the day would be theirs if they could but reach the\npeople, it was natural that they should chafe bitterly at the delay,\nconfronted as they were by the spectacle of humanity daily crucified\nafresh and enduring an illimitable anguish which they knew was needless.\nWho indeed would not have been impatient in their place, and cried as\nthey did, 'How long, O Lord, how long?' To men so situated, each day's\npostponement of the great deliverance might well have seemed like a\ncentury. Involved as they were in the din and dust of innumerable petty\ncombats, it was as difficult for them as for soldiers in the midst of a\nbattle to obtain an idea of the general course of the conflict and the\noperation of the forces which would determine its issue. To us, however,\nas we look back, the rapidity of the process by which during the nineties\nthe American people were won over to the revolutionary programme seems\nalmost miraculous, while as to the ultimate result there was, of course,\nat no time the slightest ground of question.\n\n\"From about the beginning of the second phase of the revolutionary\nmovement, the literature of the times begins to reflect in the most\nextraordinary manner a wholly new spirit of radical protest against the\ninjustices of the social order. Not only in the serious journals and\nbooks of public discussion, but in fiction and in belles-lettres, the\nsubject of social reform becomes prominent and almost commanding. The\nfigures that have come down to us of the amazing circulation of some of\nthe books devoted to the advocacy of a radical social reorganization are\nalmost enough in themselves to explain the revolution. The antislavery\nmovement had one Uncle Tom's Cabin; the anticapitalist movement had many.\n\n\"A particularly significant fact was the extraordinary unanimity and\nenthusiasm with which the purely agricultural communities of the far West\nwelcomed the new gospel of a new and equal economic system. In the past,\ngovernments had always been prepared for revolutionary agitation among\nthe proletarian wage-earners of the cities, and had always counted on the\nstolid conservatism of the agricultural class for the force to keep the\ninflammable artisans down. But in this revolution it was the\nagriculturists who were in the van. This fact alone should have\nsufficiently foreshadowed the swift course and certain issue of the\nstruggle. At the beginning of the battle the capitalists had lost their\nreserves.\n\n\"At about the beginning of the nineties the revolutionary movement first\nprominently appears in the political field. For twenty years after the\nclose of the civil war the surviving animosities between North and South\nmainly determined party lines, and this fact, together with the lack of\nagreement on a definite policy, had hitherto prevented the forces of\nindustrial discontent from making any striking political demonstration.\nBut toward the close of the eighties the diminished bitterness of feeling\nbetween North and South left the people free to align themselves on the\nnew issue, which had been steadily looming up ever since the war, as the\nirrepressible conflict of the near future--the struggle to the death\nbetween democracy and plutocracy, between the rights of man and the\ntyranny of capital in irresponsible hands.\n\n\"Although the idea of the public conduct of economic enterprises by\npublic agencies had never previously attracted attention or favor in\nAmerica, yet already in 1890, almost as soon as it began to be talked\nabout, political parties favoring its application to important branches\nof business had polled heavy votes. In 1892 a party, organized in nearly\nevery State in the Union, cast a million votes in favor of nationalizing\nat least the railroads, telegraphs, banking system, and other monopolized\nbusinesses. Two years later the same party showed large gains, and in\n1896 its platform was substantially adopted by one of the great historic\nparties of the country, and the nation divided nearly equally on the\nissue.\n\n\"The terror which this demonstration of the strength of the party of\nsocial discontent caused among the possessing class seems at this\ndistance rather remarkable, seeing that its demands, while attacking many\nimportant capitalist abuses, did not as yet directly assail the principle\nof the private control of capital as the root of the whole social evil.\nNo doubt, what alarmed the capitalists even more than the specific\npropositions of the social insurgents were the signs of a settled popular\nexasperation against them and all their works, which indicated that what\nwas now called for was but the beginning of what would be demanded later.\nThe antislavery party had not begun with demanding the abolition of\nslavery, but merely its limitation. The slaveholders were not, however,\ndeceived as to the significance of the new political portent, and the\ncapitalists would have been less wise in their generation than their\npredecessors had they not seen in the political situation the beginning\nof a confrontation of the people and the capitalists--the masses and the\nclasses, as the expression of the day was--which threatened an economic\nand social revolution in the near future.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" I said, \"that by this stage of the revolutionary\nmovement American capitalists capable of a dispassionate view of the\nsituation ought to have seen the necessity of making concessions if they\nwere to preserve any part of their advantages.\"\n\n\"If they had,\" replied the doctor, \"they would have been the first\nbeneficiaries of a tyranny who in presence of a rising flood of\nrevolution ever realized its force or thought of making concessions until\nit was hopelessly too late. You see, tyrants are always materialists,\nwhile the forces behind great revolutions are moral. That is why the\ntyrants never foresee their fate till it is too late to avert it.\"\n\n\"We ought to be in our chairs pretty soon,\" said Edith. \"I don't want\nJulian to miss the opening scene.\"\n\n\"There are a few minutes yet,\" said the doctor, \"and seeing that I have\nbeen rather unintentionally led into giving this sort of outline sketch\nof the course of the Revolution, I want to say a word about the\nextraordinary access of popular enthusiasm which made a short story of\nits later stages, especially as it is that period with which the play\ndeals that we are to attend.\n\n\"There had been many, you must know, Julian, who, while admitting that a\nsystem of co-operation, must eventually take the place of private\ncapitalism in America and everywhere, had expected that the process would\nbe a slow and gradual one, extending over several decades, perhaps half a\ncentury, or even more. Probably that was the more general opinion. But\nthose who held it failed to take account of the popular enthusiasm which\nwould certainly take possession of the movement and drive it irresistibly\nforward from the moment that the prospect of its success became fairly\nclear to the masses. Undoubtedly, when the plan of a nationalized\nindustrial system, and an equal sharing of results, with its promise of\nthe abolition of poverty and the reign of universal comfort, was first\npresented to the people, the very greatness of the salvation it offered\noperated to hinder its acceptance. It seemed too good to be true. With\ndifficulty the masses, sodden in misery and inured to hopelessness, had\nbeen able to believe that in heaven there would be no poor, but that it\nwas possible here and now in this everyday America to establish such an\nearthly paradise was too much to believe.\n\n\"But gradually, as the revolutionary propaganda diffused a knowledge of\nthe clear and unquestionable grounds on which this great assurance\nrested, and as the growing majorities of the revolutionary party\nconvinced the most doubtful that the hour of its triumph was at hand, the\nhope of the multitude grew into confidence, and confidence flamed into a\nresistless enthusiasm. By the very magnitude of the promise which at\nfirst appalled them they were now transported. An impassioned eagerness\nseized upon them to enter into the delectable land, so that they found\nevery day's, every hour's delay intolerable. The young said, 'Let us make\nhaste, and go in to the promised land while we are young, that we may\nknow what living is': and the old said, 'Let us go in ere we die, that we\nmay close our eyes in peace, knowing that it will be well with our\nchildren after us.' The leaders and pioneers of the Revolution, after\nhaving for so many years exhorted and appealed to a people for the most\npart indifferent or incredulous, now found themselves caught up and borne\nonward by a mighty wave of enthusiasm which it was impossible for them to\ncheck, and difficult for them to guide, had not the way been so plain.\n\n\"Then, to cap the climax, as if the popular mind were not already in a\nsufficiently exalted frame, came 'The Great Revival,' touching this\nenthusiasm with religious emotion.\"\n\n\"We used to have what were called revivals of religion in my day,\" I\nsaid, \"sometimes quite extensive ones. Was this of the same nature?\"\n\n\"Scarcely,\" replied the doctor. \"The Great Revival was a tide of\nenthusiasm for the social, not the personal, salvation, and for the\nestablishment in brotherly love of the kingdom of God on earth which\nChrist bade men hope and work for. It was the general awakening of the\npeople of America in the closing years of the last century to the\nprofoundly ethical and truly religious character and claims of the\nmovement for an industrial system which should guarantee the economic\nequality of all the people.\n\n\"Nothing, surely, could be more self-evident than the strictly Christian\ninspiration of the idea of this guarantee. It contemplated nothing less\nthan a literal fulfillment, on a complete social scale, of Christ's\ninculcation that all should feel the same solicitude and make the same\neffort for the welfare of others as for their own. The first effect of\nsuch a solicitude must needs be to prompt effort to bring about an equal\nmaterial provision for all, as the primary condition of welfare. One\nwould certainly think that a nominally Christian people having some\nfamiliarity with the New Testament would have needed no one to tell them\nthese things, but that they would have recognized on its first statement\nthat the programme of the revolutionists was simply a paraphrase of the\ngolden rule expressed in economic and political terms. One would have\nsaid that whatever other members of the community might do, the Christian\nbelievers would at once have flocked to the support of such a movement\nwith their whole heart, soul, mind, and might. That they were so slow to\ndo so must be ascribed to the wrong teaching and non-teaching of a class\nof persons whose express duty, above all other persons and classes, was\nto prompt them to that action--namely, the Christian clergy.\n\n\"For many ages--almost, indeed, from the beginning of the Christian\nera--the churches had turned their backs on Christ's ideal of a kingdom\nof God to be realized on earth by the adoption of the law of mutual\nhelpfulness and fraternal love. Giving up the regeneration of human\nsociety in this world as a hopeless undertaking, the clergy, in the name\nof the author of the Lord's Prayer, had taught the people not to expect\nGod's will to be done on earth. Directly reversing the attitude of Christ\ntoward society as an evil and perverse order of things needing to be made\nover, they had made themselves the bulwarks and defenses of existing\nsocial and political institutions, and exerted their whole influence to\ndiscourage popular aspirations for a more just and equal order. In the\nOld World they had been the champions and apologists of power and\nprivilege and vested rights against every movement for freedom and\nequality. In resisting the upward strivings of their people, the kings\nand emperors had always found the clergy more useful servants than the\nsoldiers and the police. In the New World, when royalty, in the act of\nabdication, had passed the scepter behind its back to capitalism, the\necclesiastical bodies had transferred their allegiance to the money\npower, and as formerly they had preached the divine right of kings to\nrule their fellow-men, now preached the divine right of ruling and using\nothers which inhered in the possession of accumulated or inherited\nwealth, and the duty of the people to submit without murmuring to the\nexclusive appropriation of all good things by the rich.\n\n\"The historical attitude of the churches as the champions and apologists\nof power and privilege in every controversy with the rights of man and\nthe idea of equality had always been a prodigious scandal, and in every\nrevolutionary crisis had not failed to cost them great losses in public\nrespect and popular following. Inasmuch as the now impending crisis\nbetween the full assertion of human equality and the existence of private\ncapitalism was incomparably the most radical issue of the sort that had\never arisen, the attitude of the churches was likely to have a critical\neffect upon their future. Should they make the mistake of placing\nthemselves upon the unpopular side in this tremendous controversy, it\nwould be for them a colossal if not a fatal mistake--one that would\nthreaten the loss of their last hold as organizations on the hearts and\nminds of the people. On the other hand, had the leaders of the churches\nbeen able to discern the full significance of the great turning of the\nworld's heart toward Christ's ideal of human society, which marked the\nclosing of the nineteenth century, they might have hoped by taking the\nright side to rehabilitate the churches in the esteem and respect of the\nworld, as, after all, despite so many mistakes, the faithful\nrepresentatives of the spirit and doctrine of Christianity. Some there\nwere indeed--yes, many, in the aggregate--among the clergy who did see\nthis and sought desperately to show it to their fellows, but, blinded by\nclouds of vain traditions, and bent before the tremendous pressure of\ncapitalism, the ecclesiastical bodies in general did not, with these\nnoble exceptions, awake to their great opportunity until it had passed\nby. Other bodies of learned men there were which equally failed to\ndiscern the irresistible force and divine sanction of the tidal wave of\nhumane enthusiasm that was sweeping over the earth, and to see that it\nwas destined to leave behind it a transformed and regenerated world. But\nthe failure of these others, however lamentable, to discern the nature of\nthe crisis, was not like the failure of the Christian clergy, for it was\ntheir express calling and business to preach and teach the application to\nhuman relations of the Golden Rule of equal treatment for all which the\nRevolution came to establish, and to watch for the coming of this very\nkingdom of brotherly love, whose advent they met with anathemas.\n\n\"The reformers of that time were most bitter against the clergy for their\ndouble treason to humanity and Christianity, in opposing instead of\nsupporting the Revolution; but time has tempered harsh judgments of every\nsort, and it is rather with deep pity than with indignation that we look\nback on these unfortunate men, who will ever retain the tragic\ndistinction of having missed the grandest opportunity of leadership ever\noffered to men. Why add reproach to the burden of such a failure as that?\n\n\"While the influence of ecclesiastical authority in America, on account\nof the growth of intelligence, had at this time greatly shrunken from\nformer proportions, the generally unfavorable or negative attitude of the\nchurches toward the programme of equality had told heavily to hold back\nthe popular support which the movement might reasonably have expected\nfrom professedly Christian people. It was, however, only a question of\ntime, and the educating influence of public discussion, when the people\nwould become acquainted for themselves with the merits of the subject.\n'The Great Revival' followed, when, in the course of this process of\neducation, the masses of the nation reached the conviction that the\nrevolution against which the clergy had warned them as unchristian was,\nin fact, the most essentially and intensely Christian movement that had\never appealed to men since Christ called his disciples, and as such\nimperatively commanded the strongest support of every believer or admirer\nof Christ's doctrine.\n\n\"The American people appear to have been, on the whole, the most\nintelligently religious of the large populations of the world--as\nreligion was understood at that time--and the most generally influenced\nby the sentiment of Christianity. When the people came to recognize that\nthe ideal of a world of equal welfare, which had been represented to them\nby the clergy as a dangerous delusion, was no other than the very dream\nof Christ; when they realized that the hope which led on the advocates of\nthe new order was no baleful _ignis fatuus_, as the churches had\ntaught, but nothing less nor other than the Star of Bethlehem, it is not\nto be wondered at that the impulse which the revolutionary movement\nreceived should have been overwhelming. From that time on it assumes more\nand more the character of a crusade, the first of the many so-called\ncrusades of history which had a valid and adequate title to that name and\nright to make the cross its emblem. As the conviction took hold on the\nalways religious masses that the plan of an equalized human welfare was\nnothing less than the divine design, and that in seeking their own\nhighest happiness by its adoption they were also fulfilling God's purpose\nfor the race, the spirit of the Revolution became a religious enthusiasm.\nAs to the preaching of Peter the Hermit, so now once more the masses\nresponded to the preaching of the reformers with the exultant cry, 'God\nwills it!' and none doubted any longer that the vision would come to\npass. So it was that the Revolution, which had begun its course under the\nban of the churches, was carried to its consummation upon a wave of moral\nand religious emotion.\"\n\n\"But what became of the churches and the clergy when the people found out\nwhat blind guides they had been?\" I asked.\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied the doctor, \"it must have seemed to them something\nlike the Judgment Day when their flocks challenged them with open Bibles\nand demanded why they had hid the Gospel all these ages and falsified the\noracles of God which they had claimed to interpret. But so far as\nappears, the joyous exultation of the people over the great discovery\nthat liberty, equality, and fraternity were nothing less than the\npractical meaning and content of Christ's religion seems to have left no\nroom in their heart for bitterness toward any class. The world had\nreceived a crowning demonstration that was to remain conclusive to all\ntime of the untrustworthiness of ecclesiastical guidance; that was all.\nThe clergy who had failed in their office of guides had not done so, it\nis needless to say, because they were not as good as other men, but on\naccount of the hopeless falsity of their position as the economic\ndependents of those they assumed to lead. As soon as the great revival\nhad fairly begun they threw themselves into it as eagerly as any of the\npeople, but not now with any pretensions of leadership. They followed the\npeople whom they might have led.\n\n\"From the great revival we date the beginning of the era of modern\nreligion--a religion which has dispensed with the rites and ceremonies,\ncreeds and dogmas, and banished from this life fear and concern for the\nmeaner self; a religion of life and conduct dominated by an impassioned\nsense of the solidarity of humanity and of man with God; the religion of\na race that knows itself divine and fears no evil, either now or\nhereafter.\"\n\n\"I need not ask,\" I said, \"as to any subsequent stages of the Revolution,\nfor I fancy its consummation did not tarry long after 'The Great\nRevival.'\"\n\n\"That was indeed the culminating impulse,\" replied the doctor; \"but while\nit lent a momentum to the movement for the immediate realization of an\nequality of welfare which no obstacle could have resisted, it did its\nwork, in fact, not so much by breaking down opposition as by melting it\naway. The capitalists, as you who were one of them scarcely need to be\ntold, were not persons of a more depraved disposition than other people,\nbut merely, like other classes, what the economic system had made them.\nHaving like passions and sensibilities with other men, they were as\nincapable of standing out against the contagion of the enthusiasm of\nhumanity, the passion of pity, and the compulsion of humane tenderness\nwhich The Great Revival had aroused, as any other class of people. From\nthe time that the sense of the people came generally to recognize that\nthe fight of the existing order to prevent the new order was nothing more\nnor less than a controversy between the almighty dollar and the Almighty\nGod, there was substantially but one side to it. A bitter minority of the\ncapitalist party and its supporters seems indeed to have continued its\noutcry against the Revolution till the end, but it was of little\nimportance. The greater and all the better part of the capitalists joined\nwith the people in completing the installation of the new order which all\nhad now come to see was to redound to the benefit of all alike.\"\n\n\"And there was no war?\"\n\n\"War! Of course not. Who was there to fight on the other side? It is odd\nhow many of the early reformers seem to have anticipated a war before\nprivate capitalism could be overthrown. They were constantly referring to\nthe civil war in the United States and to the French Revolution as\nprecedents which justified their fear, but really those were not\nanalogous cases. In the controversy over slavery, two geographical\nsections, mutually impenetrable to each other's ideas were opposed and\nwar was inevitable. In the French Revolution there would have been no\nbloodshed in France but for the interference of the neighboring nations\nwith their brutal kings and brutish populations. The peaceful outcome of\nthe great Revolution in America was, moreover, potently favored by the\nlack as yet of deep class distinctions, and consequently of rooted class\nhatred. Their growth was indeed beginning to proceed at an alarming rate,\nbut the process had not yet gone far or deep and was ineffectual to\nresist the glow of social enthusiasm which in the culminating years of\nthe Revolution blended the whole nation in a common faith and purpose.\n\n\"You must not fail to bear in mind that the great Revolution, as it came\nin America, was not a revolution at all in the political sense in which\nall former revolutions in the popular interest had been. In all these\ninstances the people, after making up their minds what they wanted\nchanged, had to overthrow the Government and seize the power in order to\nchange it. But in a democratic state like America the Revolution was\npractically done when the people had made up their minds that it was for\ntheir interest. There was no one to dispute their power and right to do\ntheir will when once resolved on it. The Revolution as regards America\nand in other countries, in proportion as their governments were popular,\nwas more like the trial of a case in court than a revolution of the\ntraditional blood-and-thunder sort. The court was the people, and the\nonly way that either contestant could win was by convincing the court,\nfrom which there was no appeal.\n\n\"So far as the stage properties of the traditional revolution were\nconcerned, plots, conspiracies, powder-smoke, blood and thunder, any one\nof the ten thousand squabbles in the mediaeval, Italian, and Flemish\ntowns, furnishes far more material to the romancer or playwright than did\nthe great Revolution in America.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand that there was actually no violent doings in\nconnection with this great transformation?\"\n\n\"There were a great number of minor disturbances and collisions,\ninvolving in the aggregate a considerable amount of violence and\nbloodshed, but there was nothing like the war with pitched lines which\nthe early reformers looked for. Many a petty dispute, causeless and\nresultless, between nameless kings in the past, too small for historical\nmention, has cost far more violence and bloodshed than, so far as America\nis concerned, did the greatest of all revolutions.\"\n\n\"And did the European nations fare as well when they passed through the\nsame crisis?\"\n\n\"The conditions of none of them were so favorable to peaceful social\nrevolution as were those of the United States, and the experience of most\nwas longer and harder, but it may be said that in the case of none of the\nEuropean peoples were the direful apprehensions of blood and slaughter\njustified which the earlier reformers seem to have entertained. All over\nthe world the Revolution was, as to its main factors, a triumph of moral\nforces.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nTHEATER-GOING IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.\n\n\"I am sorry to interrupt,\" said Edith, \"but it wants only five minutes of\nthe time for the rising of the curtain, and Julian ought not to miss the\nfirst scene.\"\n\nOn this notice we at once betook ourselves to the music room, where four\neasy chairs had been cozily arranged for our convenience. While the\ndoctor was adjusting the telephone and electroscope connections for our\nuse, I expatiated to my companion upon the contrasts between the\nconditions of theater-going in the nineteenth and in the twentieth\ncenturies--contrasts which the happy denizens of the present world can\nscarcely, by any effort of imagination, appreciate. \"In my time, only the\nresidents of the larger cities, or visitors to them, were ever able to\nenjoy good plays or operas, pleasures which were by necessary consequence\nforbidden and unknown to the mass of the people. But even those who as to\nlocality might enjoy these recreations were obliged, in order to do so,\nto undergo and endure such prodigious fuss, crowding, expense, and\ngeneral derangement of comfort that for the most part they preferred to\nstay at home. As for enjoying the great artists of other countries, one\nhad to travel to do so or wait for the artists to travel. To-day, I need\nnot tell you how it is: you stay at home and send your eyes and ears\nabroad to see and hear for you. Wherever the electric connection is\ncarried--and there need be no human habitation however remote from social\ncenters, be it the mid-air balloon or mid-ocean float of the weather\nwatchman, or the ice-crusted hut of the polar observer, where it may not\nreach--it is possible in slippers and dressing gown for the dweller to\ntake his choice of the public entertainments given that day in every city\nof the earth. And remember, too, although you can not understand it, who\nhave never seen bad acting or heard bad singing, how this ability of one\ntroupe to play or sing to the whole earth at once has operated to take\naway the occupation of mediocre artists, seeing that everybody, being\nable to see and hear the best, will hear them and see them only.\"\n\n\"There goes the bell for the curtain,\" said the doctor, and in another\nmoment I had forgotten all else in the scene upon the stage. I need not\nsketch the action of a play so familiar as \"The Knights of the Golden\nRule.\" It is enough for this purpose to recall the fact that the costumes\nand setting were of the last days of the nineteenth century, little\ndifferent from what they had been when I looked last on the world of that\nday. There were a few anachronisms and inaccuracies in the setting which\nthe theatrical administration has since done me the honor to solicit my\nassistance in correcting, but the best tribute to the general correctness\nof the scheme was its effect to make me from the first moment oblivious\nof my actual surroundings. I found myself in presence of a group of\nliving contemporaries of my former life, men and women dressed as I had\nseen them dressed, talking and acting, as till within a few weeks I had\nalways seen people talk and act; persons, in short, of like passions,\nprejudices, and manners to my own, even to minute mannerisms ingeniously\nintroduced by the playwright, which even more than the larger traits of\nresemblance affected my imagination. The only feeling that hindered my\nfull acceptance of the idea that I was attending a nineteenth-century\nshow was a puzzled wonder why I should seem to know so much more than the\nactors appeared to about the outcome of the social revolution they were\nalluding to as in progress.\n\nWhen the curtain fell on the first scene, and I looked about and saw\nEdith, her mother and father, sitting about me in the music room, the\nrealization of my actual situation came with a shock that earlier in my\ntwentieth-century career would have set my brain swimming. But I was too\nfirm on my new feet now for anything of that sort, and for the rest of\nthe play the constant sense of the tremendous experience which had made\nme at once a contemporary of two ages so widely apart, contributed an\nindescribable intensity to my enjoyment of the play.\n\nAfter the curtain fell, we sat talking of the drama, and everything else,\ntill the globe of the color clock, turning from bottle-green to white,\nwarned us of midnight, when the ladies left the doctor and myself to our\nown devices.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nTHE TRANSITION PERIOD.\n\n\"It is pretty late,\" I said, \"but I want very much to ask you just a few\nmore questions about the Revolution. All that I have learned leaves me\nquite as puzzled as ever to imagine any set of practical measures by\nwhich the substitution of public for private capitalism could have been\neffected without a prodigious shock. We had in our day engineers clever\nenough to move great buildings from one site to another, keeping them\nmeanwhile so steady and upright as not to interfere with the dwellers in\nthem, or to cause an interruption of the domestic operations. A problem\nsomething like this, but a millionfold greater and more complex, must\nhave been raised when it came to changing the entire basis of production\nand distribution and revolutionizing the conditions of everybody's\nemployment and maintenance, and doing it, moreover, without meanwhile\nseriously interrupting the ongoing of the various parts of the economic\nmachinery on which the livelihood of the people from day to day depended.\nI should be greatly interested to have you tell me something about how\nthis was done.\"\n\n\"Your question,\" replied the doctor, \"reflects a feeling which had no\nlittle influence during the revolutionary period to prolong the\ntoleration extended by the people to private capitalism despite the\nmounting indignation against its enormities. A complete change of\neconomic systems seemed to them, as it does to you, such a colossal and\ncomplicated undertaking that even many who ardently desired the new order\nand fully believed in its feasibility when once established, shrank back\nfrom what they apprehended would be the vast confusion and difficulty of\nthe transition process. Of course, the capitalists, and champions of\nthings as they were, made the most of this feeling, and apparently\nbothered the reformers not a little by calling on them to name the\nspecific measures by which they would, if they had the power, proceed to\nsubstitute for the existing system a nationalized plan of industry\nmanaged in the equal interest of all.\n\n\"One school of revolutionists declined to formulate or suggest any\ndefinite programme whatever for the consummating or constructive stage of\nthe Revolution. They said that the crisis would suggest the method for\ndealing with it, and it would be foolish and fanciful to discuss the\nemergency before it arose. But a good general makes plans which provide\nin advance for all the main eventualities of his campaign. His plans are,\nof course, subject to radical modifications or complete abandonment,\naccording to circumstances, but a provisional plan he ought to have. The\nreply of this school of revolutionists was not, therefore, satisfactory,\nand, so long as no better one could be made, a timid and conservative\ncommunity inclined to look askance at the revolutionary programme.\n\n\"Realizing the need of something more positive as a plan of campaign,\nvarious schools of reformers suggested more or less definite schemes. One\nthere was which argued that the trades unions might develop strength\nenough to control the great trades, and put their own elected officers in\nplace of the capitalists, thus organizing a sort of federation of trades\nunions. This, if practicable, would have brought in a system of group\ncapitalism as divisive and antisocial, in the large sense, as private\ncapitalism itself, and far more dangerous to civil order. This idea was\nlater heard little of, as it became evident that the possible growth and\nfunctions of trade unionism were very limited.\n\n\"There was another school which held that the solution was to be found by\nthe establishment of great numbers of voluntary colonies, organized on\nco-operative principles, which by their success would lead to the\nformation of more and yet more, and that, finally, when most of the\npopulation had joined such groups they would simply coalesce and form\none. Many noble and enthusiastic souls devoted themselves to this line of\neffort, and the numerous colonies that were organized in the United\nStates during the revolutionary period were a striking indication of the\ngeneral turning of men's hearts toward a better social order. Otherwise\nsuch experiments led, and could lead, to nothing. Economically weak, held\ntogether by a sentimental motive, generally composed of eccentric though\nworthy persons, and surrounded by a hostile environment which had the\nwhole use and advantage of the social and economic machinery, it was\nscarcely possible that such enterprises should come to anything practical\nunless under exceptional leadership or circumstances.\n\n\"There was another school still which held that the better order was to\nevolve gradually out of the old as the result of an indefinite series of\nhumane legislation, consisting of factory acts, short-hour laws, pensions\nfor the old, improved tenement houses, abolition of slums, and I don't\nknow how many other poultices for particular evils resultant from the\nsystem of private capitalism. These good people argued that when at some\nindefinitely remote time all the evil consequences of capitalism had been\nabolished, it would be time enough and then comparatively easy to abolish\ncapitalism itself--that is to say, after all the rotten fruit of the evil\ntree had been picked by hand, one at a time, off the branches, it would\nbe time enough to cut down the tree. Of course, an obvious objection to\nthis plan was that, so long as the tree remained standing, the evil fruit\nwould be likely to grow as fast as it was plucked. The various reform\nmeasures, and many others urged by these reformers, were wholly humane\nand excellent, and only to be criticised when put forward as a sufficient\nmethod of overthrowing capitalism. They did not even tend toward such a\nresult, but were quite as likely to help capitalism to obtain a longer\nlease of life by making it a little less abhorrent. There was really a\ntime after the revolutionary movement had gained considerable headway\nwhen judicious leaders felt considerable apprehension lest it might be\ndiverted from its real aim, and its force wasted in this programme of\npiecemeal reforms.\n\n\"But you have asked me what was the plan of operation by which the\nrevolutionists, when they finally came into power, actually overthrew\nprivate capitalism. It was really as pretty an illustration of the\nmilitary manoeuvre that used to be called flanking as the history of war\ncontains. Now, a flanking operation is one by which an army, instead of\nattacking its antagonist directly in front, moves round one of his flanks\nin such a way that without striking a blow it forces the enemy to leave\nhis position. That is just the strategy the revolutionists used in the\nfinal issue with capitalism.\n\n\"The capitalists had taken for granted that they were to be directly\nassaulted by wholesale forcible seizure and confiscation of their\nproperties. Not a bit of it. Although in the end, of course, collective\nownership was wholly substituted for the private ownership of capital,\nyet that was not done until after the whole system of private capitalism\nhad broken down and fallen to pieces, and not as a means of throwing it\ndown. To recur to the military illustration, the revolutionary army did\nnot directly attack the fortress of capitalism at all, but so manoeuvred\nas to make it untenable, and to compel its evacuation.\n\n\"Of course, you will understand that this policy was not suggested by any\nconsideration for the rights of the capitalists. Long before this time\nthe people had been educated to see in private capitalism the source and\nsum of all villainies, convicting mankind of deadly sin every day that it\nwas tolerated. The policy of indirect attack pursued by the\nrevolutionists was wholly dictated by the interest of the people at\nlarge, which demanded that serious derangements of the economic system\nshould be, so far as possible, avoided during the transition from the old\norder to the new.\n\n\"And now, dropping figures of speech, let me tell you plainly what was\ndone--that is, so far as I remember the story. I have made no special\nstudy of the period since my college days, and very likely when you come\nto read the histories you will find that I have made many mistakes as to\nthe details of the process. I am just trying to give you a general idea\nof the main course of events, to the best of my remembrance. I have\nalready explained that the first step in the programme of political\naction adopted by the opponents of private capitalism had been to induce\nthe people to municipalize and nationalize various quasi-public services,\nsuch as waterworks, lighting plants, ferries, local railroads, the\ntelegraph and telephone systems, the general railroad system, the coal\nmines and petroleum production, and the traffic in intoxicating liquors.\nThese being a class of enterprises partly or wholly non-competitive and\nmonopolistic in character, the assumption of public control over them did\nnot directly attack the system of production and distribution in general,\nand even the timid and conservative viewed the step with little\napprehension. This whole class of natural or legal monopolies might\nindeed have been taken under public management without logically\ninvolving an assault on the system of private capitalism as a whole. Not\nonly was this so, but even if this entire class of businesses was made\npublic and run at cost, the cheapening in the cost of living to the\ncommunity thus effected would presently be swallowed up by reductions of\nwages and prices, resulting from the remorseless operation of the\ncompetitive profit system.\n\n\"It was therefore chiefly as a means to an ulterior end that the opponent\nof capitalism favored the public operation of these businesses. One part\nof that ulterior end was to prove to the people the superior simplicity,\nefficiency, and humanity of public over private management of economic\nundertakings. But the principal use which this partial process of\nnationalization served was to prepare a body of public employees\nsufficiently large to furnish a nucleus of consumers when the Government\nshould undertake the establishment of a general system of production and\ndistribution on a non-profit basis. The employees of the nationalized\nrailroads alone numbered nearly a million, and with their dependent women\nand children represented some 4,000,000 people. The employees in the coal\nmines, iron mines, and other businesses taken charge of by the Government\nas subsidiary to the railroads, together with the telegraph and telephone\nworkers, also in the public service, made some hundreds of thousands more\npersons with their dependents. Previous to these additions there had been\nin the regular civil service of the Government nearly 250,000 persons,\nand the army and navy made some 50,000 more. These groups with their\ndependents amounted probably to a million more persons, who, added to the\nrailroad, mining, telegraph, and other employees, made an aggregate of\nsomething like 5,000,000 persons dependent on the national employment.\nBesides these were the various bodies of State and municipal employees in\nall grades, from the Governors of States down to the street-cleaners.\n\nTHE PUBLIC-SERVICE STORES.\n\n\"The first step of the revolutionary party when it came to power, with\nthe mandate of a popular majority to bring in the new order, was to\nestablish in all important centers public-service stores, where public\nemployees could procure at cost all provisions of necessity or luxury\npreviously bought at private stores. The idea was the less startling for\nnot being wholly new. It had been the custom of various governments to\nprovide for certain of the needs of their soldiers and sailors by\nestablishing service stores at which everything was of absolutely\nguaranteed quality and sold strictly at cost. The articles thus furnished\nwere proverbial for their cheapness and quality compared with anything\nthat could be bought elsewhere, and the soldier's privilege of obtaining\nsuch goods was envied by the civilian, left to the tender mercies of the\nadulterating and profit-gorging retailer. The public stores now set up by\nthe Government were, however, on a scale of completeness quite beyond any\nprevious undertakings, intended as they were to supply all the\nconsumption of a population large enough for a small-sized nation.\n\n\"At first the goods in these stores were of necessity bought by the\nGovernment of the private capitalists, producers, or importers. On these\nthe public employee saved all the middlemen's and retailers' profits,\ngetting them at perhaps half or two thirds of what they must have paid at\nprivate stores, with the guarantee, moreover, of a careful Government\ninspection as to quality. But these substantial advantages were but a\nforetaste of the prosperity he enjoyed when the Government added the\nfunction of production to that of distribution, and proceeded as rapidly\nas possible to manufacture products, instead of buying them of\ncapitalists.\n\n\"To this end great food and cotton farms were established in all sections\nof the country and innumerable shops and factories started, so that\npresently the Government had in public employ not only the original\n5,000,000, but as many more--farmers, artisans, and laborers of all\nsorts. These, of course, also had the right to be provided for at the\npublic stores, and the system had to be extended correspondingly. The\nbuyers in the public stores now saved not only the profits of the\nmiddleman and the retailer, but those as well of the manufacturer, the\nproducer, and the importer.\n\n\"Still further, not only did the public stores furnish the public\nemployees with every kind of goods for consumption, but the Government\nlikewise organized all sorts of needful services, such as cooking,\nlaundry work, housework agencies, etc., for the exclusive benefit of\npublic employees--all, of course, conducted absolutely at cost. The\nresult was that the public employee was able to be supplied at home or in\nrestaurants with food prepared by the best skill out of the best material\nand in the greatest possible variety, and more cheaply than he had ever\nbeen able to provide himself with even the coarsest provisions.\"\n\n\"How did the Government acquire the lands and manufacturing plants it\nneeded?\" I inquired. \"Did it buy them of the owners, or as to the plants\ndid it build them?\"\n\n\"It co\nerected them without affecting the success of the programme, but that was\ngenerally needless. As to land, the farmers by millions were only too\nglad to turn over their farms to the Government and accept employment on\nthem, with the security of livelihood which that implied for them and\ntheirs. The Government, moreover, took for cultivation all unoccupied\nlands that were convenient for the purpose, remitting the taxes for\ncompensation.\n\n\"It was much the same with the factories and shops which the national\nsystem called for. They were standing idle by thousands in all parts of\nthe country, in the midst of starving populations of the unemployed. When\nthese plants were suited to the Government requirements they were taken\npossession of, put in operation, and the former workers provided with\nemployment. In most instances former superintendents and foremen as well\nas the main body of operatives were glad to keep their old places, with\nthe nation as employer. The owners of such plants, if I remember rightly,\nreceived some allowance, equal to a very low rate of interest, for the\nuse of their property until such time as the complete establishment of\nthe new order should make the equal maintenance of all citizens the\nsubject of a national guarantee. That this was to be the speedy and\ncertain outcome of the course of events was now no longer doubted, and\npending that result the owners of idle plants were only too glad to get\nanything at all for their use.\n\n\"The manufacturing plants were not the only form of idle capital which\nthe Government on similar terms made use of. Considerable quantities of\nforeign imports were required to supply the public stores; and to avoid\nthe payment of profits to capitalists on these, the Government took\npossession of idle shipping, building what it further needed, and went\ninto foreign trade, exporting products of the public industries, and\nbringing home in exchange the needed foreign goods. Fishing fleets flying\nthe national flag also brought home the harvest of the seas. These peace\nfleets soon far outnumbered the war ships which up to that time\nexclusively had borne the national commission. On these fleets the sailor\nwas no more a slave.\n\nHOW MONEY LOST ITS VALUE.\n\n\"And now consider the effect of another feature of the public-store\nsystem, namely, the disuse of money in its operations. Ordinary money was\nnot received in the public stores, but a sort of scrip canceled on use\nand good for a limited time only. The public employee had the right of\nexchanging the money he received for wages, at par, into this scrip.\nWhile the Government issued it only to public employees, it was accepted\nat the public stores from any who presented it, the Government being only\ncareful that the total amount did not exceed the wages exchanged into\nsuch scrip by the public employees. It thus became a currency which\ncommanded three, four, and five hundred per cent premium over money which\nwould only buy the high-priced and adulterated goods for sale in the\nremaining stores of the capitalists. The gain of the premium went, of\ncourse, to the public employees. Gold, which had been worshiped by the\ncapitalists as the supreme and eternal type of money, was no more\nreceivable than silver, copper, or paper currency at the public stores,\nand people who desired the best goods were fortunate to find a public\nemployee foolish enough to accept three or four dollars in gold for one\nin scrip.\n\n\"The effect to make money a drug in the market, of this sweeping\nreduction in its purchasing utility, was greatly increased by its\npractically complete disuse by the large and ever-enlarging proportion of\nthe people in the public service. The demand for money was still further\nlessened by the fact that nobody wanted to borrow it now for use in\nextending business, seeing that the field of enterprise open to private\ncapital was shrinking every hour, and evidently destined presently to\ndisappear. Neither did any one desire money to hoard it, for it was more\nevident every day that it would soon become worthless. I have spoken of\nthe public-store scrip commanding several hundred per cent premium over\nmoney, but that was in the earlier stages of the transition period.\nToward the last the premium mounted to ever-dizzier altitudes, until the\nvalue of money quite disappeared, it being literally good for nothing as\nmoney.\n\n\"If you would imagine the complete collapse of the entire monetary and\nfinancial system with all its standards and influences upon human\nrelations and conditions, you have only to fancy what the effect would\nhave been upon the same interests and relations in your day if positive\nand unquestioned information had become general that the world was to be\ndestroyed within a few weeks or months, or at longest within a year. In\nthis case indeed the world was not to be destroyed, but to be rejuvenated\nand to enter on an incomparably higher and happier and more vigorous\nphase of evolution; but the effect on the monetary system and all\ndependent on it was quite the same as if the world were to come to an\nend, for the new world would have no use for money, nor recognize any\nhuman rights or relations as measured by it.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" said I, \"that as money grew valueless the public taxes\nmust have failed to bring in anything to support the Government.\"\n\n\"Taxes,\" replied the doctor, \"were an incident of private capitalism and\nwere to pass away with it. Their use had been to give the Government a\nmeans of commanding labor under the money system. In proportion as the\nnation collectively organized and directly applied the whole labor of the\npeople as the public welfare required it, had no need and could make no\nuse of taxes any more than of money in other respects. Taxation went to\npieces in the culminating stage of the Revolution, in measure as the\norganization of the capital and labor of the people for public purposes\nput an end to its functions.\"\n\nHOW THE REST OF THE PEOPLE CAME IN.\n\n\"It seems to me that about this time, if not before, the mass of the\npeople outside of the public service must have begun to insist pretty\nloudly upon being let in to share these good things.\"\n\n\"Of course they did,\" replied the doctor; \"and of course that was just\nwhat they were expected to do and what it had been arranged they should\ndo as soon as the nationalized system of production and distribution was\nin full running order. The previously existing body of public employees\nhad merely been utilized as furnishing a convenient nucleus of consumers\nto start with, which might be supplied without deranging meantime any\nmore than necessary the outside wage or commodity markets. As soon as the\nsystem was in working order the Government undertook to receive into the\npublic service not merely selected bodies of workers, but all who\napplied. From that time the industrial army received its recruits by tens\nand fifties of thousands a day till within a brief time the people as a\nwhole were in the public service.\n\n\"Of course, everybody who had an occupation or trade was kept right on at\nit at the place where he had formerly been employed, and the labor\nexchanges, already in full use, managed the rest. Later on, when all was\ngoing smoothly, would be time enough for the changings and shiftings\nabout that would seem desirable.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" I said, \"under the operation of the public employment\nprogramme, the working people must have been those first brought into the\nsystem, and the rich and well-to-do must probably have remained outside\nlongest, and come in, so to speak, all in a batch, when they did.\"\n\n\"Evidently so,\" replied the doctor. \"Of course, the original nucleus of\npublic employees, for whom the public stores were first opened, were all\nworking people, and so were the bodies of people successively taken into\nthe public service, as farmers, artisans, and tradesmen of all sorts.\nThere was nothing to prevent a capitalist from joining the service, but\nhe could do so only as a worker on a par with the others. He could buy in\nthe public stores only to the extent of his pay as a worker. His other\nmoney would not be good there. There were many men and women of the rich\nwho, in the humane enthusiasm of the closing days of the Revolution,\nabandoned their lands and mills to the Government and volunteered in the\npublic service at anything that could be given them to do; but on the\nwhole, as might be expected, the idea of going to work for a living on an\neconomic equality with their former servants was not one that the rich\nwelcomed, and they did not come to it till they had to.\"\n\n\"And were they then, at last, enlisted by force?\" I asked.\n\n\"By force!\" exclaimed the doctor; \"dear me! no. There was no sort of\nconstraint brought to bear upon them any more than upon anybody else,\nsave that created by the growing difficulty and final impossibility of\nhiring persons for private employment, or obtaining the necessities of\nlife except from the public stores with the new scrip. Before the\nGovernment entered on the policy of receiving into the public service\nevery one who applied, the unemployed had thronged upon the capitalists,\nseeking to be hired. But immediately afterward the rich began to find it\nimpossible to obtain men and women to serve them in field, factory, or\nkitchen. They could offer no inducements in the depreciated money which\nalone they possessed that were enough to counterbalance the advantages of\nthe public service. Everybody knew also that there was no future for the\nwealthy class, and nothing to be gained through their favor.\n\n\"Moreover, as you may imagine, there was already a strong popular feeling\nof contempt for those who would abase themselves to serve others for hire\nwhen they might serve the nation of which they were citizens; and, as you\nmay well imagine, this growing sentiment made the position of a private\nservant or employee of any sort intolerable. And not only did the\nunfortunate capitalists find it impossible to induce people to cook for\nthem, wash for them, to black their boots, to sweep their rooms, or drive\ntheir coaches, but they were put to straits to obtain in the dwindling\nprivate markets, where alone their money was good, the bare necessities\nof life, and presently found even that impossible. For a while, it would\nseem, they struggled against a relentless fate, sullenly supporting life\non crusts in the corners of their lonesome palaces; but at last, of\ncourse, they all had to follow their former servants into the new nation,\nfor there was no way of living save by connection with the national\neconomic organization. Thus strikingly was illustrated, in the final exit\nof the capitalists from the human stage, how absolute was and always had\nbeen the dependence of capital upon the labor it despised and tyrannized\nover.\"\n\n\"And do I understand that there was no compulsion upon anybody to join\nthe public service?\"\n\n\"None but what was inherent in the circumstances I have named,\" replied\nthe doctor. \"The new order had no need or use for unwilling recruits. In\nfact, it needed no one, but every one needed it. If any one did not wish\nto enter the public service and could live outside of it without stealing\nor begging, he was quite welcome to. The books say that the woods were\nfull of self-exiled hermits for a while, but one by one they tired of it\nand came into the new social house. Some isolated communities, however,\nremained outside for years.\"\n\n\"The mill seems, indeed, to have been calculated to grind to an exceeding\nfineness all opposition to the new order,\" I observed, \"and yet it must\nhave had its own difficulties, too, in the natural refractoriness of the\nmaterials it had to make grist of. Take, for example, my own class of the\nidle rich, the men and women whose only business had been the pursuit of\npleasure. What useful work could have been got out of such people as we\nwere, however well disposed we might have become to render service? Where\ncould we have been fitted into any sort of industrial service without\nbeing more hindrance than help?\"\n\n\"The problem might have been serious if the idle rich of whom you speak\nhad been a very large proportion of the population, but, of course,\nthough very much in evidence, they were in numbers insignificant compared\nwith the mass of useful workers. So far as they were educated\npersons--and quite generally they had some smattering of knowledge--there\nwas an ample demand for their services as teachers. Of course, they were\nnot trained teachers, or capable of good pedagogical work; but directly\nafter the Revolution, when the children and youth of the former poor were\nturned back by millions from the field and factories to the schools, and\nwhen the adults also of the working classes passionately demanded some\ndegree of education to correspond with the improved conditions of life\nthey had entered on, there was unlimited call for the services as\ninstructors of everybody who was able to teach anything, even one of the\nprimary branches, spelling, writing, geography, or arithmetic in the\nrudiments. The women of the former wealthy class, being mostly well\neducated, found in this task of teaching the children of the masses, the\nnew heirs of the world, an employment in which I fancy they must have\ntasted more real happiness in the feeling of being useful to their kind\nthan all their former frivolous existences could have given them. Few,\nindeed, were there of any class who did not prove to have some physical\nor mental quality by which they might with pleasure to themselves be\nserviceable to their kind.\"\n\nWHAT WAS DONE WITH THE VICIOUS AND CRIMINAL.\n\n\"There was another class of my contemporaries,\" I said, \"which I fancy\nmust have given the new order more trouble to make anything out of than\nthe rich, and those were the vicious and criminal idle. The rich were at\nleast intelligent and fairly well behaved, and knew enough to adapt\nthemselves to a new state of things and make the best of the inevitable,\nbut these others must have been harder to deal with. There was a great\nfloating population of vagabond criminals, loafers, and vicious of every\nclass, male and female, in my day, as doubtless you well know. Admit that\nour vicious form of society was responsible for them; nevertheless, there\nthey were, for the new society to deal with. To all intents and purposes\nthey were dehumanized, and as dangerous as wild beasts. They were barely\nkept in some sort of restraint by an army of police and the weapons of\ncriminal law, and constituted a permanent menace to law and order. At\ntimes of unusual agitation, and especially at all revolutionary crises,\nthey were wont to muster in alarming force and become aggressive. At the\ncrisis you are describing they must doubtless have made themselves\nextremely turbulent. What did the new order do with them? Its just and\nhumane propositions would scarcely appeal to the members of the criminal\nclass. They were not reasonable beings; they preferred to live by lawless\nviolence, rather than by orderly industry, on terms however just. Surely\nthe new nation must have found this class of citizens a very tough morsel\nfor its digestion.\"\n\n\"Not nearly so tough,\" replied the doctor, \"as the former society had\nfound it. In the first place, the former society, being itself based on\ninjustice, was wholly without moral prestige or ethical authority in\ndealing with the criminal and lawless classes. Society itself stood\ncondemned in their presence for the injustice which had been the\nprovocation and excuse of their revolt. This was a fact which made the\nwhole machinery of so-called criminal justice in your day a mockery.\nEvery intelligent man knew in his heart that the criminal and vicious\nwere, for the most part, what they were on account of neglect and\ninjustice, and an environment of depraving influences for which a\ndefective social order was responsible, and that if righteousness were\ndone, society, instead of judging them, ought to stand with them in the\ndock before a higher justice, and take upon itself the heavier\ncondemnation. This the criminals themselves felt in the bottom of their\nhearts, and that feeling forbade them to respect the law they feared.\nThey felt that the society which bade them reform was itself in yet\ngreater need of reformation. The new order, on the other hand, held forth\nto the outcasts hands purged of guilt toward them. Admitting the wrong\nthat they had suffered in the past, it invited them to a new life under\nnew conditions, offering them, on just and equal terms, their share in\nthe social heritage. Do you suppose that there ever was a human heart so\nbase that it did not at least know the difference between justice and\ninjustice, and to some extent respond to it?\n\n\"A surprising number of the cases you speak of, who had been given up as\nfailures by your civilization, while in fact they had been proofs of its\nfailure, responded with alacrity to the first fair opportunity to be\ndecent men and women which had ever come to them. There was, of course, a\nlarge residuum too hopelessly perverted, too congenitally deformed, to\nhave the power of leading a good life, however assisted. Toward these the\nnew society, strong in the perfect justice of its attitude, proceeded\nwith merciful firmness. The new society was not to tolerate, as the old\nhad done, a criminal class in its midst any more than a destitute class.\nThe old society never had any moral right to forbid stealing or to punish\nrobbers, for the whole economic system was based on the appropriation, by\nforce or fraud on the part of a few, of the earth and its resources and\nthe fruit of the toil of the poor. Still less had it any right to forbid\nbeggary or to punish violence, seeing that the economic system which it\nmaintained and defended necessarily operated to make beggars and to\nprovoke violence. But the new order, guaranteeing an equality of plenty\nto all, left no plea for the thief and robber, no excuse for the beggar,\nno provocation for the violent. By preferring their evil courses to the\nfair and honorable life offered them, such persons would henceforth\npronounce sentence on themselves as unfit for human intercourse. With a\ngood conscience, therefore, the new society proceeded to deal with all\nvicious and criminal persons as morally insane, and to segregate them in\nplaces of confinement, there to spend their lives--not, indeed, under\npunishment, or enduring hardships of any sort beyond enough labor for\nself-support, but wholly secluded from the world--and absolutely\nprevented from continuing their kind. By this means the race, in the\nfirst generation after the Revolution, was able to leave behind itself\nforever a load of inherited depravity and base congenital instincts, and\nso ever since it has gone on from generation to generation, purging\nitself of its uncleanness.\"\n\nTHE COLORED RACE AND THE NEW ORDER.\n\n\"In my day,\" I said, \"a peculiar complication of the social problem in\nAmerica was the existence in the Southern States of many millions of\nrecently freed negro slaves, but partially as yet equal to the\nresponsibility of freedom. I should be interested to know just how the\nnew order adapted itself to the condition of the colored race in the\nSouth.\"\n\n\"It proved,\" replied the doctor, \"the prompt solution of a problem which\notherwise might have continued indefinitely to plague the American\npeople. The population of recent slaves was in need of some sort of\nindustrial regimen, at once firm and benevolent, administered under\nconditions which should meanwhile tend to educate, refine, and elevate\nits members. These conditions the new order met with ideal perfection.\nThe centralized discipline of the national industrial army, depending for\nits enforcement not so much on force as on the inability of any one to\nsubsist outside of the system of which it was a part, furnished just the\nsort of a control--gentle yet resistless--which was needed by the\nrecently emancipated bondsman. On the other hand, the universal education\nand the refinements and amenities of life which came with the economic\nwelfare presently brought to all alike by the new order, meant for the\ncolored race even more as a civilizing agent than it did to the white\npopulation which relatively had been further advanced.\"\n\n\"There would have been in some parts,\" I remarked, \"a strong prejudice on\nthe part of the white population against any system which compelled a\ncloser commingling of the races.\"\n\n\"So we read, but there was absolutely nothing in the new system to offend\nthat prejudice. It related entirely to economic organization, and had\nnothing more to do then than it has now with social relations. Even for\nindustrial purposes the new system involved no more commingling of races\nthan the old had done. It was perfectly consistent with any degree of\nrace separation in industry which the most bigoted local prejudices might\ndemand.\"\n\nHOW THE TRANSITION MIGHT HAVE BEEN HASTENED.\n\n\"There is just one point about the transition stage that I want to go\nback to,\" I said. \"In the actual case, as you have stated it, it seems\nthat the capitalists held on to their capital and continued to conduct\nbusiness as long as they could induce anybody to work for them or buy of\nthem. I suppose that was human nature--capitalist human nature anyway;\nbut it was also convenient for the Revolution, for this course gave time\nto get the new economic system perfected as a framework before the strain\nof providing for the whole people was thrown on it. But it was just\npossible, I suppose, that the capitalists might have taken a different\ncourse. For example, suppose, from the moment the popular majority gave\ncontrol of the national Government to the revolutionists the capitalists\nhad with one accord abandoned their functions and refused to do business\nof any kind. This, mind you, would have been before the Government had\nany time to organize even the beginnings of the new system. That would\nhave made a more difficult problem to deal with, would it not?\"\n\n\"I do not think that the problem would have been more difficult,\" replied\nthe doctor, \"though it would have called for more prompt and summary\naction. The Government would have had two things to do and to do at once:\non the one hand, to take up and carry on the machinery of productive\nindustry abandoned by the capitalists, and simultaneously to provide\nmaintenance for the people pending the time when the new product should\nbecome available. I suppose that as to the matter of providing for the\nmaintenance of the people the action taken would be like that usually\nfollowed by a government when by flood, famine, siege, or other sudden\nemergency the livelihood of a whole community has been endangered. No\ndoubt the first step would have been to requisition, for public use all\nstores of grain, clothing, shoes, and commodities in general throughout\nthe country, excepting of course reasonable stocks in strictly private\nuse. There was always in any civilized country a supply ahead of these\nnecessities sufficient for several months or a year which would be many\ntimes more than would be needful to bridge over the gap between the\nstoppage of the wheels of production under private management and their\ngetting into full motion under public administration. Orders on the\npublic stores for food and clothing would have been issued to all\ncitizens making application and enrolling themselves in the public\nindustrial service. Meanwhile the Government would have immediately\nresumed the operation of the various productive enterprises abandoned by\nthe capitalists. Everybody previously employed in them would simply have\nkept on, and employment would have been as rapidly as possible provided\nfor those who had formerly been without it. The new product, as fast as\nmade, would be turned into the public stores and the process would, in\nfact, have been just the same as that I have described, save that it\nwould have gone through in much quicker time. If it did not go quite so\nsmoothly on account of the necessary haste, on the other hand it would\nhave been done with sooner, and at most we can hardly imagine that the\ninconvenience and hardship to the people would have been greater than\nresulted from even a mild specimen of the business crises which your\ncontemporaries thought necessary every seven years, and toward the last\nof the old order became perpetual.\n\nHOW CAPITALIST COERCION OF EMPLOYEES WAS MET.\n\n\"Your question, however,\" continued the doctor, \"reminds me of another\npoint which I had forgotten to mention--namely, the provisional methods\nof furnishing employment for the unemployed before the organization of\nthe complete national system of industry. What your contemporaries were\npleased to call 'the problem of the unemployed'--namely, the necessary\neffect of the profit system to create and perpetuate an unemployed\nclass--had been increasing in magnitude from the beginning of the\nrevolutionary period, and toward the close of the century the involuntary\nidlers were numbered by millions. While this state of things on the one\nhand furnished a powerful argument for the revolutionary propaganda by\nthe object lesson it furnished of the incompetence of private capitalism\nto solve the problem of national maintenance, on the other hand, in\nproportion as employment became hard to get, the hold of the employers\nover the actual and would-be employees became strengthened. Those who had\nemployment and feared to lose it, and those who had it not but hoped to\nget it, became, through fear and hope, very puppets in the hands of the\nemploying class and cast their votes at their bidding. Election after\nelection was carried in this way by the capitalists through their power\nto compel the workingman to vote the capitalist ticket against his own\nconvictions, from the fear of losing or hope of obtaining an opportunity\nto work.\n\n\"This was the situation which made it necessary previous to the conquest\nof the General Government by the revolutionary party, in order that the\nworkingmen should be made free to vote for their own deliverance, that at\nleast a provisional system of employment should be established whereby\nthe wage-earner might be insured a livelihood when unable to find a\nprivate employer.\n\n\"In different States of the Union, as the revolutionary party came into\npower, slightly different methods were adopted for meeting this\nemergency. The crude and wasteful makeshift of indiscriminate employment\non public works, which had been previously adopted by governments in\ndealing with similar emergencies, would not stand the criticism of the\nnew economic science. A more intelligent method was necessary and easily\nfound. The usual plan, though varied in different localities, was for the\nState to guarantee to every citizen who applied therefor the means of\nmaintenance, to be paid for in his or her labor, and to be taken in the\nform of commodities and lodgings, these commodities and lodgings being\nthemselves produced and maintained by the sum of the labor of those, past\nand present, who shared them. The necessary imported commodities or raw\nmaterials were obtained by the sale of the excess of product at market\nrates, a special market being also found in the consumption of the State\nprisons, asylums, etc. This system, whereby the State enabled the\notherwise unemployed mutually to maintain themselves by merely furnishing\nthe machinery and superintendence, came very largely into use to meet the\nemergencies of the transition period, and played an important part in\npreparing the people for the new order, of which it was in an imperfect\nway a sort of anticipation. In some of these State establishments for the\nunemployed the circle of industries was remarkably complete, and the\nwhole product of their labor above expenses being shared among the\nworkers, they enjoyed far better fare than when in private employment,\ntogether with a sense of security then impossible. The employer's power\nto control his workmen by the threat of discharge was broken from the\ntime these co-operative systems began to be established, and when, later,\nthe national industrial organization was ready to absorb them, they\nmerely melted into it.\"\n\nHOW ABOUT THE WOMEN?\n\n\"How about the women?\" I said. \"Do I understand that, from the first\norganization of the industrial public service on a complete scale, the\nwomen were expected, like the men, if physically able, to take their\nplaces in the ranks?\"\n\n\"Where women were sufficiently employed already in housework in their own\nfamilies,\" replied the doctor, \"they were recognized as rendering public\nservice until the new co-operative housekeeping was sufficiently\nsystematized to do away with the necessity of separate kitchens and other\nelaborate domestic machinery for each family. Otherwise, except as\noccasions for exemption existed, women took their place from the\nbeginning of the new order as units in the industrial state on the same\nbasis with men.\n\n\"If the Revolution had come a hundred years before, when as yet women had\nno other vocation but housework, the change in customs might have been a\nstriking one, but already at that time women had made themselves a place\nin the industrial and business world, and by the time the Revolution came\nit was rather exceptional when unmarried women not of the rich and idle\nclass did not have some regular occupation outside the home. In\nrecognizing women as equally eligible and liable to public service with\nmen, the new order simply confirmed to the women workers the independence\nthey had already won.\"\n\n\"But how about the married women?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the doctor, \"there would be considerable periods\nduring which married women and mothers would naturally be wholly exempt\nfrom the performance of any public duty. But except at such times there\nseems to be nothing in the nature of the sexual relation constituting a\nreason why a married woman should lead a more secluded and useless life\nthan a man. In this matter of the place of women under the new order, you\nmust understand that it was the women themselves, rather than the men,\nwho insisted that they must share in full the duties as well as the\nprivileges of citizenship. The men would not have demanded it of them. In\nthis respect you must remember that during its whole course the\nRevolution had been contemporary with a movement for the enlargement and\ngreater freedom of women's lives, and their equalization as to rights and\nduties with men. The women, married as well as unmarried, had become\nthoroughly tired of being effaced, and were in full revolt against the\nheadship of man. If the Revolution had not guaranteed the equality and\ncomradeship with him which she was fast conquering under the old order,\nit could never have counted on her support.\"\n\n\"But how about the care of children, of the home, etc.?\"\n\n\"Certainly the mothers could have been trusted to see that nothing\ninterfered with the welfare of their children, nor was there anything in\nthe public service expected of them that need do so. There is nothing in\nthe maternal function which establishes such a relation between mother\nand child as need permanently interfere with her performance of social\nand public duties, nor indeed does it appear that it was allowed to do so\nin your day by women of sufficient economic means to command needed\nassistance. The fact that women of the masses so often found it necessary\nto abandon an independent existence, and cease to live any more for\nthemselves the moment they had children, was simply a mark of the\nimperfection of your social arrangements, and not a natural or moral\nnecessity. So, too, as to what you call caring for a home. As soon as\nco-operative methods were applied to housekeeping, and its various\ndepartments were systematized as branches of the public service, the\nformer housewife had perforce to find another vocation in order to keep\nherself busy.\"\n\nTHE LODGINGS QUESTION.\n\n\"Talking about housework,\" I said, \"how did they manage about houses?\nThere were, of course, not enough good lodgings to go around, now that\nall were economic equals. How was it settled who should have the good\nhouses and who the poor?\"\n\n\"As I have said,\" replied the doctor, \"the controlling idea of the\nrevolutionary policy at the climax of the Revolution was not to\ncomplicate the general readjustment by making any changes at that time\nnot necessary to its main purpose. For the vast number of the badly\nhoused the building of better houses was one of the first and greatest\ntasks of the nation. As to the habitable houses, they were all assessed\nat a graduated rental according to size and desirability, which their\nformer occupants, if they desired to keep them, were expected to pay out\nof their new incomes as citizens. For a modest house the rent was\nnominal, but for a great house--one of the palaces of the millionaires,\nfor instance--the rent was so large that no individual could pay it, and\nindeed no individual without a host of servants would be able to occupy\nit, and these, of course, he had no means of employing. Such buildings\nhad to be used as hotels, apartment houses, or for public purposes. It\nwould appear that nobody changed dwellings except the very poor, whose\nhouses were unfit for habitation, and the very rich, who could make no\nuse of their former habitation under the changed condition of things.\"\n\nWHEN ECONOMIC EQUALITY WAS FULLY REALIZED.\n\n\"There is one point not quite clear in my mind,\" I said, \"and that is\njust when the guarantee of equal maintenance for all citizens went into\neffect.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" replied the doctor, \"that it must have been when, after the\nfinal collapse of what was left of private capitalism, the nation assumed\nthe responsibility of providing for all the people. Until then the\norganization of the public service had been on the wage basis, which\nindeed was the only practicable way of initiating the plan of universal\npublic employment while yet the mass of business was conducted by the\ncapitalists, and the new and rising system had to be accommodated at so\nmany points to the existing order of things. The tremendous rate at which\nthe membership of the national industrial army was growing from week to\nweek during the transition period would have made it impossible to find\nany basis of equal distribution that would hold good for a fortnight. The\npolicy of the Government had, however, been to prepare the workers for\nequal sharing by establishing, as far as possible, a level wage for all\nkinds of public employees. This it was possible to do, owing to the\ncheapening of all sorts of commodities by the abolition of profits,\nwithout reducing any one's income.\n\n\"For example, suppose one workman had received two dollars a day, and\nanother a dollar and a half. Owing to the cheapening of goods in the\npublic stores, these wages presently purchased twice as much as before.\nBut, instead of permitting the virtual increase of wages to operate by\nmultiplication, so as to double the original discrepancy between the pay\nof the two, it was applied by equal additions to the account of each.\nWhile both alike were better off than before, the disproportion in their\nwelfare was thus reduced. Nor could the one previously more highly paid\nobject to this as unfair, because the increased value of his wages was\nnot the result of his own efforts, but of the new public organization,\nfrom which he could only ask an equal benefit with all others. Thus by\nthe time the nation was ready for equal sharing, a substantially level\nwage, secured by leveling up, not leveling down, had already been\nestablished. As to the high salaries of special employees, out of all\nproportion to workmen's wages, which obtained under private capitalism,\nthey were ruthlessly cut down in the public service from the inception of\nthe revolutionary policy.\n\n\"But of course the most radical innovation in establishing universal\neconomic equality was not the establishment of a level wage as between\nthe workers, but the admission of the entire population, both of workers\nand of those unable to work or past the working age, to an equal share in\nthe national product. During the transition period the Government had of\nnecessity proceeded like a capitalist in respect to recognizing and\ndealing only with effective workers. It took no more cognizance of the\nexistence of the women, except when workers, or the children, or the old,\nor the infirm, crippled, or sick, or other dependents on the workers than\nthe capitalists had been in the habit of doing. But when the nation\ngathered into its hands the entire economic resources of the country it\nproceeded to administer them on the principle--proclaimed, indeed, in the\ngreat Declaration, but practically mocked by the former republic--that\nall human beings have an equal right to liberty, life, and happiness, and\nthat governments rightfully exist only for the purpose of making good\nthat right--a principle of which the first practical consequence ought to\nbe the guarantee to all on equal terms of the economic basis. Thenceforth\nall adult persons who could render any useful service to the nation were\nrequired to do so if they desired to enjoy the benefits of the economic\nsystem; but all who acknowledged the new order, whether they were able or\nunable to render any economic service, received an equal share with all\nothers of the national product, and such provision was made for the needs\nof children as should absolutely safeguard their interests from the\nneglect or caprice of selfish parents.\n\n\"Of course, the immediate effect must have been that the active workers\nreceived a less income than when they had been the only sharers; but if\nthey had been good men and distributed their wages as they ought among\nthose dependent on them, they still had for their personal use quite as\nmuch as before. Only those wage-earners who had formerly had none\ndependent on them or had neglected them suffered any curtailment of\nincome, and they deserved to. But indeed there was no question of\ncurtailment for more than a very short time for any; for, as soon as the\nnow completed economic organization was fairly in motion, everybody was\nkept too busy devising ways to expend his or her own allowance to give\nany thought to that of others. Of course, the equalizing of the economic\nmaintenance of all on the basis of citizenship put a final end to the\nemployment of private servants, even if the practice had lasted till\nthen, which is doubtful; for if any one desired a personal servant he\nmust henceforth pay him as much as he could receive in the public\nservice, which would be equivalent to the whole income of the would-be\nemployer, leaving him nothing for himself.\"\n\nTHE FINAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE CAPITALISTS.\n\n\"There is one point,\" I said, \"on which I should like to be a little more\nclearly informed. When the nation finally took possession absolutely in\nperpetuity of all the lands, machinery, and capital after the final\ncollapse of private capitalism, there must have been doubtless some sort\nof final settling and balancing of accounts between the people and the\ncapitalists whose former properties had been nationalized. How was that\nmanaged? What was the basis of final settlement?\"\n\n\"The people waived a settlement,\" replied the doctor. \"The guillotine,\nthe gallows, and the firing platoon played no part in the consummation of\nthe great Revolution. During the previous phases of the revolutionary\nagitation there had indeed been much bitter talk of the reckoning which\nthe people in the hour of their triumph would demand of the capitalists\nfor the cruel past; but when the hour of triumph came, the enthusiasm of\nhumanity which glorified it extinguished the fires of hate and took away\nall desire of barren vengeance. No, there was no settlement demanded; the\npeople forgave the past.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I said, \"you have sufficiently--in fact,\noverwhelmingly--answered my question, and all the more so because you did\nnot catch my meaning. Remember that I represent the mental and moral\ncondition of the average American capitalist in 1887. What I meant was to\ninquire what compensation the people made to the capitalists for\nnationalizing what had been their property. Evidently, however, from the\ntwentieth-century point of view, if there were to be any final settlement\nbetween the people and the capitalists it was the former who had the bill\nto present.\"\n\n\"I rather pride myself,\" replied the doctor, \"in keeping track of your\npoint of view and distinguishing it from ours, but I confess that time I\nfairly missed the cue. You see, as we look back upon the Revolution, one\nof its most impressive features seems to be the vast magnanimity of the\npeople at the moment of their complete triumph in according a free\nquittance to their former oppressors.\n\n\"Do you not see that if private capitalism was right, then the Revolution\nwas wrong; but, on the other hand, if the Revolution was right, then\nprivate capitalism was wrong, and the greatest wrong that ever existed;\nand in that case it was the capitalists who owed reparation to the people\nthey had wronged, rather than the people who owed compensation to the\ncapitalists for taking from them the means of that wrong? For the people\nto have consented on any terms to buy their freedom from their former\nmasters would have been to admit the justice of their former bondage.\nWhen insurgent slaves triumph, they are not in the habit of paying their\nformer masters the price of the shackles and fetters they have broken;\nthe masters usually consider themselves fortunate if they do not have\ntheir heads broken with them. Had the question of compensating the\ncapitalists been raised at the time we are speaking of, it would have\nbeen an unfortunate issue for them. To their question, Who was to pay\nthem for what the people had taken from them? the response would have\nbeen, Who was to pay the people for what the capitalist system had taken\nfrom them and their ancestors, the light of life and liberty and\nhappiness which it had shut off from unnumbered generations? That was an\naccounting which would have gone so deep and reached back so far that the\ndebtors might well be glad to waive it. In taking possession of the earth\nand all the works of man that stood upon it, the people were but\nreclaiming their own heritage and the work of their own hands, kept back\nfrom them by fraud. When the rightful heirs come to their own, the unjust\nstewards who kept them out of their inheritance may deem themselves\nmercifully dealt with if the new masters are willing to let bygones be\nbygones.\n\n\"But while the idea of compensating the capitalists for putting an end to\ntheir oppression would have been ethically absurd, you will scarcely get\na full conception of the situation without considering that any such\ncompensation was in the nature of the case impossible. To have\ncompensated the capitalists in any practical way--that is, any way which\nwould have preserved to them under the new order any economic equivalent\nfor their former holdings--would have necessarily been to set up private\ncapitalism over again in the very act of destroying it, thus defeating\nand stultifying the Revolution in the moment of its triumph.\n\n\"You see that this last and greatest of revolutions in the nature of the\ncase absolutely differed from all former ones in the finality and\ncompleteness of its work. In all previous instances in which governments\nhad abolished or converted to public use forms of property in the hands\nof citizens it had been possible to compensate them in some other kind of\nproperty through which their former economic advantage should be\nperpetuated under a different form. For example, in condemning lands it\nwas possible to pay for them in money, and in abolishing property in men\nit was possible to pay for the slaves, so that the previous superiority\nor privilege held by the property owner was not destroyed outright, but\nmerely translated, so to speak, into other terms. But the great\nRevolution, aiming as it did at the final destruction of all forms of\nadvantage, dominion, or privilege among men, left no guise or mode\npossible under which the capitalist could continue to exercise his former\nsuperiority. All the modes under which in past time men had exercised\ndominion over their fellows had been by one revolution after another\nreduced to the single form of economic superiority, and now that this\nlast incarnation of the spirit of selfish dominion was to perish there\nwas no further refuge for it. The ultimate mask torn off, it was left to\nwither in the face of the sun.\"\n\n\"Your explanation leaves me nothing further to ask as to the matter of a\nfinal settling between the people and the capitalists,\" I said. \"Still, I\nhave understood that in the first steps toward the substitution of public\nbusiness management for private capitalism, consisting in the\nnationalizing or municipalizing of quasi-public services, such as gas\nworks, railroads, telegraphs, etc., some theory of compensation was\nfollowed. Public opinion, at that stage not having accepted the whole\nrevolutionary programme, must probably have insisted upon this practice.\nJust when was it discontinued?'\n\n\"You will readily perceive,\" replied the doctor, \"that in measure as it\nbecame generally recognized that economic equality was at hand, it began\nto seem farcical to pay the capitalists for their possessions in forms of\nwealth which must presently, as all knew, become valueless. So it was\nthat, as the Revolution approached its consummation, the idea of buying\nthe capitalists out gave place to plans for safeguarding them from\nunnecessary hardships pending the transition period. All the businesses\nof the class you speak of which were taken over by the people in the\nearly stages of the revolutionary agitation, were paid for in money or\nbonds, and usually at prices most favorable to the capitalists. As to the\ngreater plants, which were taken over later, such as railroads and the\nmines, a different course was followed. By the time public opinion was\nripe for these steps, it began to be recognized by the dullest that it\nwas possible, even if not probable, that the revolutionary programme\nwould go completely through, and all forms of monetary value or\nobligation become waste paper. With this prospect the capitalists owning\nthe properties were naturally not particularly desirous of taking\nnational bonds for them which would have been the natural form of\ncompensation had they been bought outright. Even if the capitalists had\nbeen willing to take the bonds, the people would never have consented to\nincrease the public debt by the five or six billions of bonds that would\nhave been necessary to carry out the purchase. Neither the railroads nor\nthe mines were therefore purchased at all. It was their management, not\ntheir ownership, which had excited the public indignation and created the\ndemand for their nationalization. It was their management, therefore,\nwhich was nationalized, their ownership remaining undisturbed.\n\n\"That is to say, the Government, on the high ground of public policy and\nfor the correction of grievances that had become intolerable, assumed the\nexclusive and perpetual management and operation of the railroad lines.\nAn honest valuation of the plants having been made, the earnings, if any,\nup to a reasonable percentage, were paid over to the security holders.\nThis arrangement answered the purpose of delivering the people and the\nsecurity holders alike from the extortions and mismanagement of the\nformer private operators, and at the same time brought a million railroad\nemployees into the public service and the enjoyment of all its benefits\nquite as effectively as if the lines had been bought outright. A similar\nplan was followed with the coal and other mines. This combination of\nprivate ownership with public management continued until, the Revolution\nhaving been consummated, all the capital of the country was nationalized\nby comprehensive enactment.\n\n\"The general principle which governed the revolutionary policy in dealing\nwith property owners of all sorts was that while the distribution of\nproperty was essentially unjust and existing property rights morally\ninvalid, and as soon as possible a wholly new system should be\nestablished, yet that, until the new system of property could as a whole\nreplace the existing one, the legal rights of property owners ought to be\nrespected, and when overruled in the public interest proper provision\nshould be made to prevent hardship. The means of private maintenance\nshould not, that is to say, be taken away from any one until the\nguarantee of maintenance from public sources could take its place. The\napplication of this principle by the revolutionists seems to have been\nextremely logical, clean cut, and positive. The old law of property, bad\nas it was, they did not aim to abolish in the name of license,\nspoliation, and confusion, but in the name of a stricter and more logical\nas well as more righteous law. In the most nourishing days of capitalism,\nstealing, so called, was never repressed more sternly than up to the very\neve of the complete introduction of the new system.\n\n\"To sum up the case in a word,\" I suggested, \"it seems that in passing\nfrom the old order into the new it necessarily fared with the rich as it\ndid when they passed out of this world into the next. In one case, as in\nthe other, they just absolutely had to leave their money behind them.\"\n\n\"The illustration is really very apt,\" laughed the doctor, \"except in one\nimportant particular. It has been rumored that the change which Dives\nmade from this world to the next was an unhappy one for him; but within\nhalf a dozen years after the new economic system had been in operation\nthere was not an ex-millionaire of the lot who was not ready to admit\nthat life had been made as much better worth living for him and his class\nas for the rest of the community.\"\n\n\"Did the new order get into full running condition so quickly as that?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Of course, it could not get into perfect order as you see it now for\nmany years. The _personnel_ of any community is the prime factor in\nits economic efficiency, and not until the first generation born under\nthe new order had come to maturity--a generation of which every member\nhad received the highest intellectual and industrial training--did the\neconomic order fully show what it was capable of. But not ten nor two\nyears had elapsed from the time when the national Government took all the\npeople into employment on the basis of equal sharing in the product\nbefore the system showed results which overwhelmed the world with\namazement. The partial system of public industries and public stores\nwhich the Government had already undertaken had given the people some\nintimation of the cheapening of products and improvement in their quality\nwhich might follow from the abolition of profits even under a wage\nsystem, but not until the entire economic system had been nationalized\nand all co-operated for a common weal was it possible completely to pool\nthe product and share it equally. No previous experience had therefore\nprepared the public for the prodigious efficiency of the new economic\nenginery. The people had thought the reformers made rather large promises\nas to what the new system would do in the way of wealth-making, but now\nthey charged them of keeping back the truth. And yet the result was one\nthat need not have surprised any one who had taken the trouble to\ncalculate the economic effect of the change in systems. The incalculable\nincrease of wealth which but for the profit system the great inventions\nof the century would long before have brought the world, was being reaped\nin a long-postponed but overwhelming harvest.\n\n\"The difficulty under the profit system had been to avoid producing too\nmuch; the difficulty under the equal sharing system was how to produce\nenough. The smallness of demand had before limited supply, but supply had\nnow set to it an unlimited task. Under private capitalism demand had been\na dwarf and lame at that, and yet this cripple had been pace-maker for\nthe giant production. National cooperation had put wings on the dwarf and\nshod the cripple with Mercury's sandals. Henceforth the giant would need\nall his strength, all his thews of steel and sinews of brass even, to\nkeep him in sight as he flitted on before.\n\n\"It would be difficult to give you an idea of the tremendous burst of\nindustrial energy with which the rejuvenated nation on the morrow of the\nRevolution threw itself into the task of uplifting the welfare of all\nclasses to a level where the former rich man might find in sharing the\ncommon lot nothing to regret. Nothing like the Titanic achievement by\nwhich this result was effected had ever before been known in human\nhistory, and nothing like it seems likely ever to occur again. In the\npast there had not been work enough for the people. Millions, some rich,\nsome poor, some willingly, some unwillingly, had always been idle, and\nnot only that, but half the work that was done was wasted in competition\nor in producing luxuries to gratify the secondary wants of the few, while\nyet the primary wants of the mass remained unsatisfied. Idle machinery\nequal to the power of other millions of men, idle land, idle capital of\nevery sort, mocked the need of the people. Now, all at once there were\nnot hands enough in the country, wheels enough in the machinery, power\nenough in steam and electricity, hours enough in the day, days enough in\nthe week, for the vast task of preparing the basis of a comfortable\nexistence for all. For not until all were well-to-do, well housed, well\nclothed, well fed, might any be so under the new order of things.\n\n\"It is said that in the first full year after the new order was\nestablished the total product of the country was tripled, and in the\nsecond the first year's product was doubled, and every bit of it\nconsumed.\n\n\"While, of course, the improvement in the material welfare of the nation\nwas the most notable feature in the first years after the Revolution,\nsimply because it was the place at which any improvement must begin, yet\nthe ennobling and softening of manners and the growth of geniality in\nsocial intercourse are said to have been changes scarcely less notable.\nWhile the class differences inherited from the former order in point of\nhabits, education, and culture must, of course, continue to mark and in a\nmeasure separate the members of the generation then on the stage, yet the\ncertain knowledge that the basis of these differences had passed away\nforever, and that the children of all would mingle not only upon terms of\neconomic equality, but of moral, intellectual, and social sympathy, and\nentire community of interest, seems to have had a strong anticipatory\ninfluence in bringing together in a sentiment of essential brotherhood\nthose who were too far on in life to expect to see the full promise of\nthe Revolution realized.\n\n\"One other matter is worth speaking of, and that is the effect almost at\nonce of the universal and abounding material prosperity which the nation\nhad entered on to make the people forget all about the importance they\nhad so lately attached to petty differences in pay and wages and salary.\nIn the old days of general poverty, when a sufficiency was so hard to\ncome by, a difference in wages of fifty cents or a dollar had seemed so\ngreat to the artisan that it was hard for him to accept the idea of an\neconomic equality in which such important distinctions should disappear.\nIt was quite natural that it should be so. Men fight for crusts when they\nare starving, but they do not quarrel over bread at a banquet table.\nSomewhat so it befell when in the years after the Revolution material\nabundance and all the comforts of life came to be a matter of course for\nevery one, and storing for the future was needless. Then it was that the\nhunger motive died out of human nature and covetousness as to material\nthings, mocked to death by abundance, perished by atrophy, and the\nmotives of the modern worker, the love of honor, the joy of beneficence,\nthe delight of achievement, and the enthusiasm of humanity, became the\nimpulses of the economic world. Labor was glorified, and the cringing\nwage-slave of the nineteenth century stood forth transfigured as the\nknight of humanity.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nTHE BOOK OF THE BLIND.\n\nIf the reader were to judge merely from what has been set down in these\npages he would be likely to infer that my most absorbing interest during\nthese days I am endeavoring to recall was the study of the political\neconomy and social philosophy of the modern world, which I was pursuing\nunder the direction of Dr. Leete. That, however, would be a great\nmistake. Full of wonder and fascination as was that occupation, it was\nprosaic business compared with the interest of a certain old story which\nhis daughter and I were going over together, whereof but slight mention\nhas been made, because it is a story which all know or ought to know for\nthemselves. The dear doctor, being aware of the usual course of such\nstories, no doubt realized that this one might be expected presently to\nreach a stage of interest where it would be likely, for a time at least,\nwholly to distract my attention from other themes. No doubt he had been\ngoverned by this consideration in trying to give to our talks a range\nwhich should result in furnishing me with a view of the institutions of\nthe modern world and their rational basis that would be as symmetrical\nand rounded out as was at all consistent with the vastness of the subject\nand the shortness of the time. It was some days after he had told me the\nstory of the transition period before we had an opportunity for another\nlong talk, and the turn he gave to our discourse on that occasion seemed\nto indicate that he intended it as a sort of conclusion of the series, as\nindeed it proved to be.\n\nEdith and I had come home rather late that evening, and when she left me\nI turned into the library, where a light showed that the doctor was still\nsitting. As I entered he was turning over the leaves of a very old and\nyellow-looking volume, the title of which, by its oddity, caught my eye.\n\n\"Kenloe's Book of the Blind,\" I said. \"That is an odd title.\"\n\n\"It is the title of an odd book,\" replied the doctor. \"The Book of the\nBlind is nearly a hundred years old, having been compiled soon after the\ntriumph of the Revolution. Everybody was happy, and the people in their\njoy were willing to forgive and forget the bitter opposition of the\ncapitalists and the learned class, which had so long held back the\nblessed change. The preachers who had preached, the teachers who had\ntaught, and the writers who had written against the Revolution, were now\nthe loudest in its praise, and desired nothing so much as to have their\nprevious utterances forgotten. But Kenloe, moved by a certain crabbed\nsense of justice, was bound that they should not be forgotten.\nAccordingly, he took the pains to compile, with great care as to\nauthenticity, names, dates, and places, a mass of excerpts from speeches,\nbooks, sermons, and newspapers, in which the apologists of private\ncapitalism had defended that system and assailed the advocates of\neconomic equality during the long period of revolutionary agitation. Thus\nhe proposed to pillory for all time the blind guides who had done their\nbest to lead the nation and the world into the ditch. The time would\ncome, he foresaw, as it has come, when it would seem incredible to\nposterity that rational men and, above all, learned men should have\nopposed in the name of reason a measure which, like economic equality\nobviously meant nothing more nor less than the general diffusion of\nhappiness. Against that time he prepared this book to serve as a\nperpetual testimony. It was dreadfully hard on the men, all alive at the\ntime and desiring the past to be forgotten, on whom he conferred this\nmost undesirable immortality. One can imagine how they must have\nanathematized him when the book came out. Nevertheless it must be said\nthat if men ever deserved to endure perpetual obloquy those fellows did.\n\n\"When I came across this old volume on the top shelf of the library the\nother day it occurred to me that it might be helpful to complete your\nimpression of the great Revolution by giving you an idea of the other\nside of the controversy--the side of your own class, the capitalists, and\nwhat sort of reasons they were able to give against the proposition to\nequalize the basis of human welfare.\"\n\nI assured the doctor that nothing would interest me more. Indeed, I had\nbecome so thoroughly naturalized as a twentieth-century American that\nthere was something decidedly piquant in the idea of having my former\npoint of view as a nineteenth-century capitalist recalled to me.\n\n\"Anticipating that you would take that view,\" said the doctor, \"I have\nprepared a little list of the main heads of objection from Kenloe's\ncollection, and we will go over them, if you like, this evening. Of\ncourse, there are many more than I shall quote, but the others are mainly\nvariations of these, or else relate to points which have been covered in\nour talks.\"\n\nI made myself comfortable, and the doctor proceeded:\n\nTHE PULPIT OBJECTION.\n\n\"The clergy in your day assumed to be the leaders of the people, and it\nis but respectful to their pretensions to take up first what seems to\nhave been the main pulpit argument against the proposed system of\neconomic equality collectively guaranteed. It appears to have been rather\nin the nature of an excuse for not espousing the new social ideal than a\ndirect attack on it, which indeed it would have been rather difficult for\nnominal Christians to make, seeing that it was merely the proposal to\ncarry out the golden rule.\n\n\"The clergy reasoned that the fundamental cause of social misery was\nhuman sin and depravity, and that it was vain to expect any great\nimprovement in the social condition through mere improvements in social\nforms and institutions unless there was a corresponding moral improvement\nin men. Until that improvement took place it was therefore of no use to\nintroduce improved social systems, for they would work as badly as the\nold ones if those who were to operate them were not themselves better men\nand women.\n\n\"The element of truth in this argument is the admitted fact that the use\nwhich individuals or communities are able to make of any idea,\ninstrument, or institution depends on the degree to which they have been\neducated up to the point of understanding and appreciating it.\n\n\"On the other hand, however, it is equally true, as the clergy must at\nonce have admitted, that from the time a people begins to be morally and\nintellectually educated up to the point of understanding and appreciating\nbetter institutions, their adoption is likely to be of the greatest\nbenefit to them. Take, for example, the ideas of religious liberty and of\ndemocracy. There was a time when the race could not understand or fitly\nuse either, and their adoption as formal institutions would have done no\ngood. Afterward there came a time when the world was ready for the ideas,\nand then their realization by means of new social institutions\nconstituted great forward steps in civilization.\n\n\"That is to say, if, on the one hand, it is of no use to introduce an\nimproved institution before people begin to be ready for it, on the other\nhand great loss results if there be a delay or refusal to adopt the\nbetter institution as soon as the readiness begins to manifest itself.\n\n\"This being the general law of progress, the practical question is, How\nare we to determine as to any particular proposed improvement in\ninstitutions whether the world is yet ready to make a good use of it or\nwhether it is premature?\n\n\"The testimony of history is that the only test of the fitness of people\nat any time for a new institution is the volume and earnestness of the\npopular demand for the change. When the peoples began in earnest to cry\nout for religious liberty and freedom of conscience, it was evident that\nthey were ready for them. When nations began strongly to demand popular\ngovernment, it was proof that they were ready for that. It did not follow\nthat they were entirely able at once to make the best possible use of the\nnew institution; that they could only learn to do by experience, and the\nfurther development which they would attain through the use of the better\ninstitution and could not otherwise attain at all. What was certain was\nthat after the people had reached this state of mind the old institution\nhad ceased to be serviceable, and that however badly for a time the new\none might work, the interest of the race demanded its adoption, and\nresistance to the change was resistance to progress.\n\n\"Applying this test to the situation toward the close of the nineteenth\ncentury, what evidence was there that the world was beginning to be ready\nfor a radically different and more humane set of social institutions? The\nevidence was the volume, earnestness, and persistence of the popular\ndemand for it which at that period had come to be the most widespread,\nprofound, and powerful movement going on in the civilized world. This was\nthe tremendous fact which should have warned the clergy who withstood the\npeople's demand for better things to beware lest haply they be found\nfighting even against God. What more convincing proof could be asked that\nthe world had morally and intellectually outgrown the old economic order\nthan the detestation and denunciation of its cruelties and fatuities\nwhich had become the universal voice? What stronger evidence could there\nbe that the race was ready at least to attempt the experiment of social\nlife on a nobler plane than the marvelous development during this period\nof the humanitarian and philanthropic spirit, the passionate acceptance\nby the masses of the new idea of social solidarity and the universal\nbrotherhood of man?\n\n\"If the clergymen who objected to the Revolution on the ground that\nbetter institutions would be of no utility without a better spirit had\nbeen sincere in that objection, they would have found in a survey of the\nstate and tendencies of popular feeling the most striking proof of the\npresence of the very conditions in extraordinary measure which they\ndemanded as necessary to insure the success of the experiment.\n\n\"But indeed it is to be greatly feared that they were not sincere. They\npretended to hold Christ's doctrine that hatred of the old life and a\ndesire to lead a better one is the only vocation necessary to enter upon\nsuch a life. If they had been sincere in professing this doctrine, they\nwould have hailed with exultation the appeal of the masses to be\ndelivered from their bondage to a wicked social order and to be permitted\nto live together on better, kinder, juster terms. But what they actually\nsaid to the people was in substance this: It is true, as you complain,\nthat the present social and economic system is morally abominable and\nthoroughly antichristian, and that it destroys men's souls and bodies.\nNevertheless, you must not think of trying to change it for a better\nsystem, because you are not yet good enough to try to be better. It is\nnecessary that you should wait until you are more righteous before you\nattempt to leave off doing evil. You must go on stealing and fighting\nuntil you shall become fully sanctified.\n\n\"How would the clergy have been scandalized to hear that a Christian\nminister had in like terms attempted to discourage an individual penitent\nwho professed loathing for his former life and a desire to lead a better!\nWhat language shall we find then that is strong enough fitly to\ncharacterize the attitude of these so-called ministers of Christ, who in\nhis name rebuked and derided the aspirations of a world weary of social\nwrong and seeking for a better way?\"\n\n\nTHE LACK OF INCENTIVE OBJECTION.\n\n\"But, after all,\" pursued the doctor, turning the pages of Kenloe, \"let\nus not be too hard on these unfortunate clergymen, as if they were more\nblinded or bigoted in their opposition to progress than were other\nclasses of the learned men of the day, as, for example, the\neconomists. One of the main arguments--perhaps the leading one--of the\nnineteenth-century economists against the programme of economic equality\nunder a nationalized economic system was that the people would not prove\nefficient workers owing to the lack of sufficiently sharp personal\nincentives to diligence.\n\n\"Now, let us look at this objection. Under the old system there were two\nmain incentives to economic exertion: the one chiefly operative on the\nmasses, who lived from hand to mouth, with no hope of more than a bare\nsubsistence; the other operating to stimulate the well-to-do and rich to\ncontinue their efforts to accumulate wealth. The first of these motives,\nthe lash that drove the masses to their tasks, was the actual pressure or\nimminent fear of want. The second of the motives, that which spurred the\nalready rich, was the desire to be ever richer, a passion which we know\nincreased with what it fed on. Under the new system every one on easy\nconditions would be sure of as good a maintenance as any one else and be\nquite relieved from the pressure or fear of want. No one, on the other\nhand, by any amount of effort, could hope to become the economic superior\nof another. Moreover, it was said, since every one looked to his share in\nthe general result rather than to his personal product, the nerve of zeal\nwould be cut. It was argued that the result would be that everybody would\ndo as little as he could and keep within the minimum requirement of the\nlaw, and that therefore, while the system might barely support itself, it\ncould never be an economic success.\"\n\n\"That sounds very natural,\" I said. \"I imagine it is just the sort of\nargument that I should have thought very powerful.\"\n\n\"So your friends the capitalists seem to have regarded it, and yet the\nvery statement of the argument contains a confession of the economic\nimbecility of private capitalism which really leaves nothing to be\ndesired as to completeness. Consider, Julian, what is implied as to an\neconomic system by the admission that under it the people never escape\nthe actual pressure of want or the immediate dread of it. What more could\nthe worst enemy of private capitalism allege against it, or what stronger\nreason could he give for demanding that some radically new system be at\nleast given a trial, than the fact which its defenders stated in this\nargument for retaining it--namely, that under it the masses were always\nhungry? Surely no possible new system could work any worse than one which\nconfessedly depended upon the perpetual famine of the people to keep it\ngoing.\"\n\n\"It was a pretty bad giving away of their case,\" I said, \"when you come\nto think of it that way. And yet at first statement it really had a\nformidable sound.\"\n\n\"Manifestly,\" said the doctor, \"the incentives to wealth-production under\na system confessedly resulting in perpetual famine must be ineffectual,\nand we really need consider them no further; but your economists praised\nso highly the ambition to get rich as an economic motive and objected so\nstrongly to economic equality because it would shut it off, that a word\nmay be well as to the real value of the lust of wealth as an economic\nmotive. Did the individual pursuit of riches under your system\nnecessarily tend to increase the aggregate wealth of the community? The\nanswer is significant. It tended to increase the aggregate wealth only\nwhen it prompted the production of new wealth. When, on the other hand,\nit merely prompted individuals to get possession of wealth already\nproduced and in the hands of others, it tended only to change the\ndistribution without at all increasing the total of wealth. Not only,\nindeed, did the pursuit of wealth by acquisition, as distinguished from\nproduction, not tend to increase the total, but greatly to decrease it by\nwasteful strife. Now, I will leave it to you, Julian, whether the\nsuccessful pursuers of wealth, those who illustrated most strikingly the\nforce of this motive of accumulation, usually sought their wealth by\nthemselves producing it or by getting hold of what other people had\nproduced or supplanting other people's enterprises and reaping the field\nothers had sown.\"\n\n\"By the latter processes, of course,\" I replied. \"Production was slow and\nhard work. Great wealth could not be gained that way, and everybody knew\nit. The acquisition of other people's product and the supplanting of\ntheir enterprises were the easy and speedy and royal ways to riches for\nthose who were clever enough, and were the basis of all large and rapid\naccumulations.\"\n\n\"So we read,\" said the doctor; \"but the desire of getting rich also\nstimulated capitalists to more or less productive activity which was the\nsource of what little wealth you had. This was called production for\nprofit, but the political-economy class the other morning showed us that\nproduction for profit was economic suicide, tending inevitably, by\nlimiting the consuming power of a community, to a fractional part of its\nproductive power to cripple production in turn, and so to keep the mass\nof mankind in perpetual poverty. And surely this is enough to say about\nthe incentives to wealth-making which the world lost in abandoning\nprivate capitalism, first general poverty, and second the profit system,\nwhich caused that poverty. Decidedly we can dispense with those\nincentives.\n\n\"Under the modern system it is indeed true that no one ever imagined such\na thing as coming to want unless he deliberately chose to, but we think\nthat fear is on the whole the weakest as well as certainly the cruelest\nof incentives. We would not have it on any terms were it merely for\ngain's sake. Even in your day your capitalists knew that the best man was\nnot he who was working for his next dinner, but he who was so well off\nthat no immediate concern for his living affected his mind. Self-respect\nand pride in achievement made him a far better workman than he who was\nthinking of his day's pay. But if those motives were as strong then,\nthink how much more powerful they are now! In your day when two men\nworked side by side for an employer it was no concern of the one, however\nthe other might cheat or loaf. It was not his loss, but the employer's.\nBut now that all work for the common fund, the one who evades or scamps\nhis work robs every one of his fellows. A man had better hang himself\nnowadays than get the reputation of a shirk.\n\n\"As to the notion of these objectors that economic equality would cut the\nnerve of zeal by denying the individual the reward of his personal\nachievements, it was a complete misconception of the effects of the\nsystem. The assumption that there would be no incentives to impel\nindividuals to excel one another in industry merely because these\nincentives would not take a money form was absurd. Every one is as\ndirectly and far more certainly the beneficiary of his own merits as in\nyour day, save only that the reward is not in what you called 'cash.' As\nyou know, the whole system of social and official rank and headship,\ntogether with the special honors of the state, are determined by the\nrelative value of the economic and other services of individuals to the\ncommunity. Compared with the emulation aroused by this system of nobility\nby merit, the incentives to effort offered under the old order of things\nmust have been slight indeed.\n\n\"The whole of this subject of incentive taken by your contemporaries\nseems, in fact, to have been based upon the crude and childish theory\nthat the main factor in diligence or execution of any kind is external,\nwhereas it is wholly internal. A person is congenitally slothful or\nenergetic. In the one case no opportunity and no incentive can make him\nwork beyond a certain minimum of efficiency, while in the other case he\nwill make his opportunity and find his incentives, and nothing but\nsuperior force can prevent his doing the utmost possible. If the motive\nforce is not in the man to start with, it can not be supplied from\nwithout, and there is no substitute for it. If a man's mainspring is not\nwound up when he is born, it never can be wound up afterward. The most\nthat any industrial system can do to promote diligence is to establish\nsuch absolutely fair conditions as shall promise sure recognition for all\nmerit in its measure. This fairness, which your system, utterly unjust in\nall respects, wholly failed to secure, ours absolutely provides. As to\nthe unfortunates who are born lazy, our system has certainly no\nmiraculous power to make them energetic, but it does see to it with\nabsolute certainty that every able-bodied person who receives economic\nmaintenance of the nation shall render at least the minimum of service.\nThe laziest is sure to pay his cost. In your day, on the other hand,\nsociety supported millions of able-bodied loafers in idleness, a dead\nweight on the world's industry. From the hour of the consummation of the\ngreat Revolution, this burden ceased to be borne.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I said, \"I am sure my old friends could do better than that.\nLet us have another of their objections.\"\n\nAFRAID THAT EQUALITY WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY ALIKE.\n\n\"Here, then, is one which they seem to have thought a great deal of. They\nargued that the effect of economic equality would be to make everybody\njust alike, as if they had been sawed off to one measure, and that\nconsequently life would become so monotonous that people would all hang\nthemselves at the end of a month. This objection is beautifully typical\nof an age when everything and everybody had been reduced to a money\nvaluation. It having been proposed to equalize everybody's supply of\nmoney, it was at once assumed, as a matter of course, that there would be\nleft no points of difference between individuals that would be worth\nconsidering. How perfectly does this conclusion express the philosophy of\nlife held by a generation in which it was the custom to sum up men as\nrespectively 'worth' so many thousands, hundred thousands, or millions of\ndollars! Naturally enough, to such people it seemed that human beings\nwould become well-nigh indistinguishable if their bank accounts were the\nsame.\n\n\"But let us be entirely fair to your contemporaries. Possibly those who\nused this argument against economic equality would have felt aggrieved to\nhave it made out the baldly sordid proposition it seems to be. They\nappear, to judge from the excerpts collected in this book, to have had a\nvague but sincere apprehension that in some quite undefined way economic\nequality would really tend to make people monotonously alike, tediously\nsimilar, not merely as to bank accounts, but as to qualities in general,\nwith the result of obscuring the differences in natural endowments, the\ninteraction of which lends all the zest to social intercourse. It seems\nalmost incredible that the obvious and necessary effect of economic\nequality could be apprehended in a sense so absolutely opposed to the\ntruth. How could your contemporaries look about them without seeing that\nit is always inequality which prompts the suppression of individuality by\nputting a premium on servile imitation of superiors, and, on the other\nhand, that it is always among equals that one finds independence?\nSuppose, Julian, you had a squad of recruits and wanted to ascertain at a\nglance their difference in height, what sort of ground would you select\nto line them up on?\"\n\n\"The levelest piece I could find, of course.\"\n\n\"Evidently; and no doubt these very objectors would have done the same in\na like case, and yet they wholly failed to see that this was precisely\nwhat economic equality would mean for the community at large. Economic\nequality with the equalities of education and opportunity implied in it\nwas the level standing ground, the even floor, on which the new order\nproposed to range all alike, that they might be known for what they were,\nand all their natural inequalities be brought fully out. The charge of\nabolishing and obscuring the natural differences between men lay justly\nnot against the new order, but against the old, which, by a thousand\nartificial conditions and opportunities arising from economic inequality,\nmade it impossible to know how far the apparent differences in\nindividuals were natural, and how far they were the result of artificial\nconditions. Those who voiced the objection to economic equality as\ntending to make men all alike were fond of calling it a leveling process.\nSo it was, but it was not men whom the process leveled, but the ground\nthey stood on. From its introduction dates the first full and clear\nrevelation of the natural and inherent varieties in human endowments.\nEconomic equality, with all it implies, is the first condition of any\ntrue anthropometric or man-measuring system.\"\n\n\"Really,\" I said, \"all these objections seem to be of the boomerang\npattern, doing more damage to the side that used them than to the enemy.\"\n\n\"For that matter,\" replied the doctor, \"the revolutionists would have\nbeen well off for ammunition if they had used only that furnished by\ntheir opponents' arguments. Take, for example, another specimen, which we\nmay call the aesthetic objection to economic equality, and might regard\nas a development of the one just considered. It was asserted that the\npicturesqueness and amusement of the human spectacle would suffer without\nthe contrast of conditions between the rich and poor. The question first\nsuggested by this statement is: To whom, to what class did these\ncontrasts tend to make life more amusing? Certainly not to the poor, who\nmade up the mass of the race. To them they must have been maddening. It\nwas then in the interest of the mere handful of rich and fortunate that\nthis argument for retaining poverty was urged. Indeed this appears to\nhave been quite a fine ladies' argument. Kenloe puts it in the mouths of\nleaders of polite society. As coolly as if it had been a question of\nparlor decoration, they appear to have argued that the black background\nof the general misery was a desirable foil to set off the pomp of the\nrich. But, after all, this objection was not more brutal than it was\nstupid. If here and there might be found some perverted being who\nrelished his luxuries the more keenly for the sight of others' want, yet\nthe general and universal rule is that happiness is stimulated by the\nsight of the happiness of others. As a matter of fact, far from desiring\nto see or be even reminded of squalor and poverty, the rich seem to have\ntried to get as far as possible from sight or sound of them, and to wish\nto forget their existence.\n\n\"A great part of the objections to economic equality in this book seems\nto have been based on such complete misapprehensions of what the plan\nimplied as to have no sort of relevancy to it. Some of these I have\npassed over. One of them, by way of illustration, was based on the\nassumption that the new social order would in some way operate to\nenforce, by law, relations of social intimacy of all with all, without\nregard to personal tastes or affinities. Quite a number of Kenloe's\nsubjects worked themselves up to a frenzy, protesting against the\nintolerable effects of such a requirement. Of course, they were fighting\nimaginary foes. There was nothing under the old social order which\ncompelled men to associate merely because their bank accounts or incomes\nwere the same, and there was nothing under the new order that would any\nmore do so. While the universality of culture and refinement vastly\nwidens the circle from which one may choose congenial associates, there\nis nothing to prevent anybody from living a life as absolutely unsocial\nas the veriest cynic of the old time could have desired.\n\nOBJECTION THAT EQUALITY WOULD END THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM.\n\n\"The theory of Kenloe,\" continued the doctor, \"that unless he carefully\nrecorded and authenticated these objections to economic equality,\nposterity would refuse to believe that they had ever been seriously\noffered, is specially justified by the next one on the list. This is an\nargument against the new order because it would abolish the competitive\nsystem and put an end to the struggle for existence. According to the\nobjectors, this would be to destroy an invaluable school of character and\ntesting process for the weeding out of inferiority, and the development\nand survival as leaders of the best types of humanity. Now, if your\ncontemporaries had excused themselves for tolerating the competitive\nsystem on the ground that, bad and cruel as it was, the world was not\nripe for any other, the attitude would have been intelligible, if not\nrational; but that they should defend it as a desirable institution in\nitself, on account of its moral results, and therefore not to be\ndispensed with even if it could be, seems hard to believe. For what was\nthe competitive system but a pitiless, all-involving combat for the means\nof life, the whole zest of which depended on the fact that there was not\nenough to go round, and the losers must perish or purchase bare existence\nby becoming the bondmen of the successful? Between a fight for the\nnecessary means of life like this and a fight for life itself with sword\nand gun, it is impossible to make any real distinction. However, let us\ngive the objection a fair hearing.\n\n\"In the first place, let us admit that, however dreadful were the\nincidents of the fight for the means of life called competition, yet, if\nit were such a school of character and testing process for developing the\nbest types of the race as these objectors claimed, there would be\nsomething to have been said in favor of its retention. But the first\ncondition of any competition or test, the results of which are to command\nrespect or possess any value, is the fairness and equality of the\nstruggle. Did this first and essential condition of any true competitive\nstruggle characterize the competitive system of your day?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I replied, \"the vast majority of the contestants were\nhopelessly handicapped at the start by ignorance and lack of early\nadvantages, and never had even the ghost of a chance from the word go.\nDifferences in economic advantages and backing, moreover, gave half the\nrace at the beginning to some, leaving the others at a distance which\nonly extraordinary endowments might overcome. Finally, in the race for\nwealth all the greatest prizes were not subject to competition at all,\nbut were awarded without any contest according to the accident of birth.\"\n\n\"On the whole, then, it would appear,\" resumed the doctor, \"that of all\nthe utterly unequal, unfair, fraudulent, sham contests, whether in sport\nor earnest, that were ever engaged in, the so-called competitive system\nwas the ghastliest farce. It was called the competitive system apparently\nfor no other reason than that there was not a particle of genuine\ncompetition in it, nothing but brutal and cowardly slaughter of the\nunarmed and overmatched by bullies in armor; for, although we have\ncompared the competitive struggle to a foot race, it was no such harmless\nsport as that, but a struggle to the death for life and liberty, which,\nmind you, the contestants did not even choose to risk, but were forced to\nundertake, whatever their chances. The old Romans used to enjoy the\nspectacle of seeing men fight for their lives, but they at least were\ncareful to pair their gladiators as nearly as possible. The most hardened\nattendants at the Coliseum would have hissed from the arena a performance\nin which the combatants were matched with such utter disregard of\nfairness as were those who fought for their lives in the so-called\ncompetitive struggle of your day.\"\n\n\"Even you, doctor,\" I said, \"though you know these things so well through\nthe written record, can not realize how terribly true your words are.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now tell me what it would have been necessary to do by way of\nequalizing the conditions of the competitive struggle in order that it\nmight be called, without mockery, a fair test of the qualities of the\ncontestants.\"\n\n\"It would have been necessary, at least,\" I said, \"to equalize their\neducational equipment, early advantages, and economic or money backing.\"\n\n\"Precisely so; and that is just what economic equality proposed to do.\nYour extraordinary contemporaries objected to economic equality because\nit would destroy the competitive system, when, in fact, it promised the\nworld the first and only genuine competitive system it ever had.\"\n\n\"This objection seems the biggest boomerang yet,\" I said.\n\n\"It is a double-ended one,\" said the doctor, \"and we have yet observed\nbut one end. We have seen that the so-called competitive system under\nprivate capitalism was not a competitive system at all, and that nothing\nbut economic equality could make a truly competitive system possible.\nGrant, however, for the sake of the argument, that the old system was\nhonestly competitive, and that the prizes went to the most proficient\nunder the requirements of the competition; the question would remain\nwhether the qualities the competition tended to develop were desirable\nones. A training school in the art of lying, for example, or burglary, or\nslander, or fraud, might be efficient in its method and the prizes might\nbe fairly distributed to the most proficient pupils, and yet it would\nscarcely be argued that the maintenance of the school was in the public\ninterest. The objection we are considering assumes that the qualities\nencouraged and rewarded under the competitive system were desirable\nqualities, and such as it was for the public policy to develop. Now, if\nthis was so, we may confidently expect to find that the prize-winners in\nthe competitive struggle, the great money-makers of your age, were\nadmitted to be intellectually and morally the finest types of the race at\nthe time. How was that?\"\n\n\"Don't be sarcastic, doctor.\"\n\n\"No, I will not be sarcastic, however great the temptation, but just\ntalk straight on. What did the world, as a rule, think of the great\nfortune-makers of your time? What sort of human types did they represent?\nAs to intellectual culture, it was held as an axiom that a college\neducation was a drawback to success in business, and naturally so, for\nany knowledge of the humanities would in so far have unmanned men for the\nsordid and pitiless conditions of the fight for wealth. We find the great\nprize takers in the competitive struggle to have generally been men who\nmade it a boast that they had never had any mental education beyond the\nrudiments. As a rule, the children and grandchildren, who gladly\ninherited their wealth, were ashamed of their appearance and manners as\ntoo gross for refined surroundings.\n\n\"So much for the intellectual qualities that marked the victors in the\nrace for wealth under the miscalled competitive system; what of the\nmoral? What were the qualities and practices which the successful seeker\nafter great wealth must systematically cultivate and follow? A lifelong\nhabit of calculating upon and taking advantage of the weaknesses,\nnecessities, and mistakes of others, a pitiless insistence upon making\nthe most of every advantage which one might gain over another, whether by\nskill or accident, the constant habit of undervaluing and depreciating\nwhat one would buy, and overvaluing what one would sell; finally, such a\nlifelong study to regulate every thought and act with sole reference to\nthe pole star of self-interest in its narrowest conception as must needs\npresently render the man incapable of every generous or self-forgetting\nimpulse. That was the condition of mind and soul which the competitive\npursuit of wealth in your day tended to develop, and which was naturally\nmost brilliantly exemplified in the cases of those who carried away the\ngreat prizes of the struggle.\n\n\"But, of course, these winners of the great prizes were few, and had the\ndemoralizing influence of the struggle been limited to them it would have\ninvolved the moral ruin of a small number. To realize how wide and deadly\nwas the depraving influence of the struggle for existence, we must\nremember that it was not confined to its effect upon the characters of\nthe few who succeeded, but demoralized equally the millions who failed,\nnot on account of a virtue superior to that of the few winners, or any\nunwillingness to adopt their methods, but merely through lack of the\nrequisite ability or fortune. Though not one in ten thousand might\nsucceed largely in the pursuit of wealth, yet the rules of the contest\nmust be followed as closely to make a bare living as to gain a fortune,\nin bargaining for a bag of old rags as in buying a railroad. So it was\nthat the necessity equally upon all of seeking their living, however\nhumble, by the methods of competition, forbade the solace of a good\nconscience as effectually to the poor man as to the rich, to the many\nlosers at the game as to the few winners. You remember the familiar\nlegend which represents the devil as bargaining with people for their\nsouls, with the promise of worldly success as the price. The bargain was\nin a manner fair as set forth in the old story. The man always received\nthe price agreed on. But the competitive system was a fraudulent devil,\nwhich, while requiring everybody to forfeit their souls, gave in return\nworldly success to but one in a thousand.\n\n\"And now, Julian, just let us glance at the contrast between what winning\nmeant under the old false competitive system and what it means under the\nnew and true competitive system, both to the winner and to the others.\nThe winners then were those who had been most successful in getting away\nthe wealth of others. They had not even pretended to seek the good of the\ncommunity or to advance its interest, and if they had done so, that\nresult had been quite incidental. More often than otherwise their wealth\nrepresented the loss of others. What wonder that their riches became a\nbadge of ignominy and their victory their shame? The winners in the\ncompetition of to-day are those who have done most to increase the\ngeneral wealth and welfare. The losers, those who have failed to win the\nprizes, are not the victims of the winners, but those whose interest,\ntogether with the general interest, has been served by them better than\nthey themselves could have served it. They are actually better off\nbecause a higher ability than theirs was developed in the race, seeing\nthat this ability redounded wholly to the common interest. The badges of\nhonor and rewards of rank and office which are the tangible evidence of\nsuccess won in the modern competitive struggle are but expressions of the\nlove and gratitude of the people to those who have proved themselves\ntheir most devoted and efficient servants and benefactors.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" I said, \"so far as you have gone, that if some one had\nbeen employed to draw up a list of the worst and weakest aspects of\nprivate capitalism, he could not have done better than to select the\nfeatures of the system on which its champions seem to have based their\nobjections to a change.\"\n\nOBJECTION THAT EQUALITY WOULD DISCOURAGE INDEPENDENCE AND ORIGINALITY.\n\n\"That is an impression,\" said the doctor, \"which you will find confirmed\nas we take up the next of the arguments on our list against economic\nequality. It was asserted that to have an economic maintenance on simple\nand easy terms guaranteed to all by the nation would tend to discourage\noriginality and independence of thought and conduct on the part of the\npeople, and hinder the development of character and individuality. This\nobjection might be regarded as a branch of the former one that economic\nequality would make everybody just alike, or it might be considered a\ncorollary of the argument we have just disposed of about the value of\ncompetition as a school of character. But so much seems to have been made\nof it by the opponents of the Revolution that I have set it down\nseparately.\n\n\"The objection is one which, by the very terms necessary to state it,\nseems to answer itself, for it amounts to saying that a person will be in\ndanger of losing independence of feeling by gaining independence of\nposition. If I were to ask you what economic condition was regarded as\nmost favorable to moral and intellectual independence in your day, and\nmost likely to encourage a man to act out himself without fear or favor,\nwhat would you say?\"\n\n\"I should say, of course, that a secure and independent basis of\nlivelihood was that condition.\"\n\n\"Of course. Now, what the new order promised to give and guarantee\neverybody was precisely this absolute independence and security of\nlivelihood. And yet it was argued that the arrangement would be\nobjectionable, as tending to discourage independence of character. It\nseems to us that if there is any one particular in which the influence\nupon humanity of economic equality has been more beneficent than any\nother, it has been the effect which security of economic position has had\nto make every one absolute lord of himself and answerable for his\nopinions, speech, and conduct to his own conscience only.\n\n\"That is perhaps enough to say in answer to an objection which, as I\nremarked, really confutes itself, but the monumental audacity of the\ndefenders of private capitalism in arguing that any other possible system\ncould be more unfavorable than itself to human dignity and independence\ntempts a little comment, especially as this is an aspect of the old order\non which I do not remember that we have had much talk. As it seems to us,\nperhaps the most offensive feature of private capitalism, if one may\nselect among so many offensive features, was its effect to make cowardly,\ntime-serving, abject creatures of human beings, as a consequence of the\ndependence for a living, of pretty nearly everybody upon some individual\nor group.\n\n\"Let us just glance at the spectacle which the old order presented in\nthis respect. Take the women in the first place, half the human race.\nBecause they stood almost universally in a relation of economic\ndependence, first upon men in general and next upon some man in\nparticular, they were all their lives in a state of subjection both to\nthe personal dictation of some individual man, and to a set of irksome\nand mind-benumbing conventions representing traditional standards of\nopinion as to their proper conduct fixed in accordance with the masculine\nsentiment. But if the women had no independence at all, the men were not\nso very much better off. Of the masculine half of the world, the greater\npart were hirelings dependent for their living upon the favor of\nemployers and having the most direct interest to conform so far as\npossible in opinions and conduct to the prejudices of their masters, and,\nwhen they could not conform, to be silent. Look at your secret ballot\nlaws. You thought them absolutely necessary in order to enable workingmen\nto vote freely. What a confession is that fact of the universal\nintimidation of the employed by the employer! Next there were the\nbusiness men, who held themselves above the workingmen. I mean the\ntradesmen, who sought a living by persuading the people to buy of them.\nBut here our quest of independence is even more hopeless than among the\nworkingmen, for, in order to be successful in attracting the custom of\nthose whom they cringingly styled their patrons, it was necessary for the\nmerchant to be all things to all men, and to make an art of\nobsequiousness.\n\n\"Let us look yet higher. We may surely expect to find independence of\nthought and speech among the learned classes in the so-called liberal\nprofessions if nowhere else. Let us see how our inquiry fares there. Take\nthe clerical profession first--that of the religious ministers and\nteachers. We find that they were economic servants and hirelings either\nof hierarchies or congregations, and paid to voice the opinions of their\nemployers and no others. Every word that dropped from their lips was\ncarefully weighed lest it should indicate a trace of independent\nthinking, and if it were found, the clergyman risked his living. Take the\nhigher branches of secular teaching in the colleges and professions.\nThere seems to have been some freedom allowed in teaching the dead\nlanguages; but let the instructor take up some living issue and handle it\nin a manner inconsistent with the capitalist interest, and you know well\nenough what became of him. Finally, take the editorial profession, the\nwriters for the press, who on the whole represented the most influential\nbranch of the learned class. The great nineteenth-century newspaper was a\ncapitalistic enterprise as purely commercial in its principle as a woolen\nfactory, and the editors were no more allowed to write their own opinions\nthan the weavers to choose the patterns they wove. They were employed to\nadvocate the opinions and interests of the capitalists owning the paper\nand no others. The only respect in which the journalists seem to have\ndiffered from the clergy was in the fact that the creeds which the latter\nwere employed to preach were more or less fixed traditions, while those\nwhich the editors must preach changed with the ownership of the paper.\nThis, Julian, is the truly exhilarating spectacle of abounding and\nunfettered originality, of sturdy moral and intellectual independence and\nrugged individuality, which it was feared by your contemporaries might be\nendangered by any change in the economic system. We may agree with them\nthat it would have been indeed a pity if any influence should operate to\nmake independence any rarer than it was, but they need not have been\napprehensive; it could not be.\"\n\n\"Judging from these examples of the sort of argumentative opposition\nwhich the revolutionists had to meet,\" I observed, \"it strikes me that\nthey must have had a mighty easy time of it.\"\n\n\"So far as rational argument was concerned,\" replied the doctor, \"no\ngreat revolutionary movement ever had to contend with so little\nopposition. The cause of the capitalists was so utterly bad, either from\nthe point of view of ethics, politics, or economic science, that there\nwas literally nothing that could be said for it that could not be turned\nagainst it with greater effect. Silence was the only safe policy for the\ncapitalists, and they would have been glad enough to follow it if the\npeople had not insisted that they should make some sort of a plea to the\nindictment against them. But because the argumentative opposition which\nthe revolutionists had to meet was contemptible in quality, it did not\nfollow that their work was an easy one. Their real task--and it was one\nfor giants--was not to dispose of the arguments against their cause, but\nto overcome the moral and intellectual inertia of the masses and rouse\nthem to do just a little clear thinking for themselves.\n\nPOLITICAL CORRUPTION AS AN OBJECTION TO NATIONALIZING INDUSTRY.\n\n\"The next objection--there are only two or three more worth\nmentioning--is directed not so much against economic equality in itself\nas against the fitness of the machinery by which the new industrial\nsystem was to be carried on. The extension of popular government over\nindustry and commerce involved of course the substitution of public and\npolitical administration on a large scale for the previous irresponsible\ncontrol of private capitalists. Now, as I need not tell you, the\nGovernment of the United States--municipal, State, and national--in the\nlast third of the nineteenth century had become very corrupt. It was\nargued that to intrust any additional functions to governments so corrupt\nwould be nothing short of madness.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I exclaimed, \"that is perhaps the rational objection we have been\nwaiting for. I am sure it is one that would have weighed heavily with me,\nfor the corruption of our governmental system smelled to heaven.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt,\" said the doctor, \"that there was a great deal of\npolitical corruption and that it was a very bad thing, but we must look a\nlittle deeper than these objectors did to see the true bearing of this\nfact on the propriety of nationalizing industry.\n\n\"An instance of political corruption was one where the public servant\nabused his trust by using the administration under his control for\npurposes of private gain instead of solely for the public interest--that\nis to say, he managed his public trust just as if it were his private\nbusiness and tried to make a profit out of it. A great outcry was made,\nand very properly, when any such conduct was suspected; and therefore the\ncorrupt officers operated under great difficulties, and were in constant\ndanger of detection and punishment. Consequently, even in the worst\ngovernments of your period the mass of business was honestly conducted,\nas it professed to be, in the public interest, comparatively few and\noccasional transactions being affected by corrupt influences.\n\n\"On the other hand, what were the theory and practice pursued by the\ncapitalists in carrying on the economic machinery which were under their\ncontrol? They did not profess to act in the public interest or to have\nany regard for it. The avowed object of their whole policy was so to use\nthe machinery of their position as to make the greatest personal gains\npossible for themselves out of the community. That is to say, the use of\nhis control of the public machinery for his personal gain--which on the\npart of the public official was denounced and punished as a crime, and\nfor the greater part prevented by public vigilance--was the avowed policy\nof the capitalist. It was the pride of the public official that he left\noffice as poor as when he entered it, but it was the boast of the\ncapitalist that he made a fortune out of the opportunities of his\nposition. In the case of the capitalist these gains were not called\ncorrupt, as they were when made by public officials in the discharge of\npublic business. They were called profits, and regarded as legitimate;\nbut the practical point to consider as to the results of the two systems\nwas that these profits cost the people they came out of just as much as\nif they had been called political plunder.\n\n\"And yet these wise men in Kenloe's collection taught the people, and\nsomebody must have listened to them, that because in some instances\npublic officials succeeded in spite of all precautions in using the\npublic administration for their own gain, it would not be safe to put any\nmore public interests under public administration, but would be safer to\nleave them to private capitalists, who frankly proposed as their regular\npolicy just what the public officials were punished whenever caught\ndoing--namely, taking advantage of the opportunities of their position to\nenrich themselves at public expense. It was precisely as if the owner of\nan estate, finding it difficult to secure stewards who were perfectly\nfaithful, should be counseled to protect himself by putting his affairs\nin the hands of professional thieves.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" I said, \"that political corruption merely meant the\noccasional application to the public administration of the profit-seeking\nprinciple on which all private business was conducted.\"\n\n\"Certainly. A case of corruption in office was simply a case where the\npublic official forgot his oath and for the occasion took a businesslike\nview of the opportunities of his position--that is to say, when the\npublic official fell from grace he only fell to the normal level on which\nall private business was admittedly conducted. It is simply astonishing,\nJulian, how completely your contemporaries overlooked this obvious fact.\nOf course, it was highly proper that they should be extremely critical of\nthe conduct of their public officials; but it is unaccountable that they\nshould fail to see that the profits of private capitalists came out of\nthe community's pockets just as certainly as did the stealings of\ndishonest officials, and that even in the most corrupt public departments\nthe stealings represented a far less percentage than would have been\ntaken as profits if the same business were done for the public by\ncapitalists.\n\n\"So much for the precious argument that, because some officials sometimes\ntook profits of the people, it would be more economical to leave their\nbusiness in the hands of those who would systematically do so! But, of\ncourse, although the public conduct of business, even if it were marked\nwith a certain amount of corruption, would still be more economical\nfor the community than leaving it under the profit system, yet no\nself-respecting community would wish to tolerate any public corruption at\nall, and need not, if only the people would exercise vigilance. Now, what\nwill compel the people to exercise vigilance as to the public\nadministration? The closeness with which we follow the course of an agent\ndepends on the importance of the interests put in his hands. Corruption\nhas always thrived in political departments in which the mass of the\npeople have felt little direct concern. Place under public administration\nvital concerns of the community touching their welfare daily at many\npoints, and there will be no further lack of vigilance. Had they been\nwiser, the people who objected to the governmental assumption of new\neconomic functions on account of existing political corruption would have\nadvocated precisely that policy as the specific cure for the evil.\n\n\"A reason why these objectors seem to have been especially short-sighted\nis the fact that by all odds the most serious form which political\ncorruption took in America at that day was the bribery of legislators by\nprivate capitalists and corporations in order to obtain franchises and\nprivileges. In comparison with this abuse, peculation or bribery of crude\ndirect sorts were of little extent or importance. Now, the immediate and\nexpress effect of the governmental assumption of economic businesses\nwould be, so far as it went, to dry up this source of corruption, for it\nwas precisely this class of capitalist undertakings which the\nrevolutionists proposed first to bring under public control.\n\n\"Of course, this objection was directed only against the new order while\nin process of introduction. With its complete establishment the very\npossibility of corruption, would disappear with the law of absolute\nuniformity governing all incomes.\n\n\"Worse and worse,\" I exclaimed. \"What is the use of going further?\"\n\n\"Patience,\" said the doctor. \"Let us complete the subject while we are on\nit. There are only a couple more of the objections that have shape enough\nto admit of being stated.\"\n\nOBJECTION THAT A NATIONALIZED INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM WOULD THREATEN LIBERTY.\n\n\"The first of them,\" pursued the doctor, \"was the argument that such an\nextension of the functions of public administration as nationalized\nindustries involved would lodge a power in the hands of the Government,\neven though it were the people's own government, that would be dangerous\nto their liberties.\n\n\"All the plausibility there was to this objection rested on the tacit\nassumption that the people in their industrial relations had under\nprivate capitalism been free and unconstrained and subject to no form of\nauthority. But what assumption could have been more regardless of facts\nthan this? Under private capitalism the entire scheme of industry and\ncommerce, involving the employment and livelihood of everybody, was\nsubject to the despotic and irresponsible government of private masters.\nThe very demand for nationalizing industry has resulted wholly from the\nsufferings of the people under the yoke of the capitalists.\n\n\"In 1776 the Americans overthrew the British royal government in the\ncolonies and established their own in its place. Suppose at that time the\nking had sent an embassy to warn the American people that by assuming\nthese new functions of government which formerly had been performed for\nthem by him they were endangering their liberty. Such an embassy would,\nof course, have been laughed at. If any reply had been thought needful,\nit would have been pointed out that the Americans were not establishing\nover themselves any new government, but were substituting a government of\ntheir own, acting in their own interests, for the government of others\nconducted in an indifferent or hostile interest. Now, that was precisely\nwhat nationalizing industry meant. The question was, Given the necessity\nof some sort of regulation and direction of the industrial system,\nwhether it would tend more to liberty for the people to leave that power\nto irresponsible persons with hostile interests, or to exercise it\nthemselves through responsible agents? Could there conceivably be but one\nanswer to that question?\n\n\"And yet it seems that a noted philosopher of the period, in a tract\nwhich has come down to us, undertook to demonstrate that if the people\nperfected the democratic system by assuming control of industry in the\npublic interest, they would presently fall into a state of slavery which\nwould cause them to sigh for the days of Nero and Caligula. I wish we had\nthat philosopher here, that we might ask him how, in accordance with any\nobserved laws of human nature, slavery was going to come about as the\nresult of a system aiming to establish and perpetuate a more perfect\ndegree of equality, intellectual as well as material, than had ever been\nknown. Did he fancy that the people would deliberately and maliciously\nimpose a yoke upon themselves, or did he apprehend that some usurper\nwould get hold of the social machinery and use it to reduce the people to\nservitude? But what usurper from the beginning ever essayed a task so\nhopeless as the subversion of a state in which there were no classes or\ninterests to set against one another, a state in which there was no\naristocracy and no populace, a state the stability of which represented\nthe equal and entire stake in life of every human being in it? Truly it\nwould seem that people who conceived the subversion of such a republic\npossible ought to have lost no time in chaining down the Pyramids, lest\nthey, too, defying ordinary laws of Nature, should incontinently turn\nupon their tops.\n\n\"But let us leave the dead to bury their dead, and consider how the\nnationalization of industry actually did affect the bearing of government\nupon the people. If the amount of governmental machinery--that is, the\namount of regulating, controlling, assigning, and directing under the\npublic management of industry--had continued to be just the same it was\nunder the private administration of the capitalists, the fact that it was\nnow the people's government, managing everything in the people's interest\nunder responsibility to the people, instead of an irresponsible tyranny\nseeking its own interest, would of course make an absolute difference in\nthe whole character and effect of the system and make it vastly more\ntolerable. But not merely did the nationalization of industry give a\nwholly new character and purpose to the economic administration, but it\nalso greatly diminished the net amount of governing necessary to carry it\non. This resulted naturally from the unity of system with the consequent\nco-ordination and interworking of all the parts which took the place of\nthe former thousand-headed management following as many different and\nconflicting lines of interest, each a law to itself. To the workers the\ndifference was as if they had passed out from under the capricious\npersonal domination of innumerable petty despots to a government of laws\nand principles so simple and systematic that the sense of being subject\nto personal authority was gone.\n\n\"But to fully realize how strongly this argument of too much government\ndirected against the system of nationalized industry partook of the\nboomerang quality of the previous objections, we must look on to the\nlater effects which the social justice of the new order would naturally\nhave to render superfluous well-nigh the whole machinery of government as\npreviously conducted. The main, often almost sole, business of\ngovernments in your day was the protection of property and person against\ncriminals, a system involving a vast amount of interference with the\ninnocent. This function of the state has now become almost obsolete.\nThere are no more any disputes about property, any thefts of property, or\nany need of protecting property. Everybody has all he needs and as much\nas anybody else. In former ages a great number of crimes have resulted\nfrom the passions of love and jealousy. They were consequences of the\nidea derived from immemorial barbarism that men and women might acquire\nsexual proprietorship in one another, to be maintained and asserted\nagainst the will of the person. Such crimes ceased to be known after the\nfirst generation had grown up under the absolute sexual autonomy and\nindependence which followed from economic equality. There being no lower\nclasses now which upper classes feel it their duty to bring up in the way\nthey should go, in spite of themselves, all sorts of attempts to regulate\npersonal behavior in self-regarding matters by sumptuary legislation have\nlong ago ceased. A government in the sense of a coordinating directory of\nour associated industries we shall always need, but that is practically\nall the government we have now. It used to be a dream of philosophers\nthat the world would some time enjoy such a reign of reason and justice\nthat men would be able to live together without laws. That condition, so\nfar as concerns punitive and coercive regulations, we have practically\nattained. As to compulsory laws, we might be said to live almost in a\nstate of anarchy.\n\n\"There is, as I explained to you in the Labor Exchange the other morning,\nno compulsion, in the end, even as to the performance of the universal\nduty of public service. We only insist that those who finally refuse to\ndo their part toward maintaining the social welfare shall not be\npartakers of it, but shall resort by themselves and provide for\nthemselves.\n\nTHE MALTHUSIAN OBJECTION.\n\n\"And now we come to the last objection on my list. It is entirely\ndifferent in character from any of the others. It does not deny that\neconomic equality would be practicable or desirable, or assert that the\nmachinery would work badly. It admits that the system would prove a\ntriumphant success in raising human welfare to an unprecedented point and\nmaking the world an incomparably more agreeable place to live in. It was\nindeed the conceded success of the plan which was made the basis of this\nobjection to it.\"\n\n\"That must be a curious sort of objection,\" I said. \"Let us hear about\nit.\"\n\n\"The objectors put it in this way: 'Let us suppose,' they said, 'that\npoverty and all the baneful influences upon life and health that follow\nin its train are abolished and all live out their natural span of life.\nEverybody being assured of maintenance for self and children, no motive\nof prudence would be operative to restrict the number of offspring. Other\nthings being equal, these conditions would mean a much faster increase of\npopulation than ever before known, and ultimately an overcrowding of the\nearth and a pressure on the food supply, unless indeed we suppose new and\nindefinite food sources to be found?'\"\n\n\"I do not see why it might not be reasonable to anticipate such a\nresult,\" I observed, \"other things being equal.\"\n\n\"Other things being equal,\" replied the doctor, \"such a result might be\nanticipated. But other things would not be equal, but so different that\ntheir influence could be depended on to prevent any such result.\"\n\n\"What are the other things that would not be equal?\"\n\n\"Well, the first would be the diffusion of education, culture, and\ngeneral refinement. Tell me, were the families of the well-to-do and\ncultured class in the America of your day, as a whole, large?\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary. They did not, as a rule, more than replace\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"Still, they were not prevented by any motive of prudence from increasing\ntheir numbers. They occupied in this respect as independent a position as\nfamilies do under the present order of economic equality and guaranteed\nmaintenance. Did it never occur to you why the families of the well-to-do\nand cultured in your day were not larger?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" I said, \"it was on account of the fact that in proportion as\nculture and refinement opened intellectual and aesthetic fields of\ninterest, the impulses of crude animalism played less important parts in\nlife. Then, too, in proportion as families were refined the woman ceased\nto be the mere sexual slave of the husband, and her wishes as to such\nmatters were considered.\"\n\n\"Quite so. The reflection you have suggested is enough to indicate the\nfallacy of the whole Malthusian theory of the increase of population on\nwhich this objection to better social conditions was founded. Malthus, as\nyou know, held that population tended to increase faster than means of\nsubsistence, and therefore that poverty and the tremendous wastes of life\nit stood for were absolutely necessary in order to prevent the world from\nstarving to death by overcrowding. Of course, this doctrine was\nenormously popular with the rich and learned class, who were responsible\nfor the world's misery. They naturally were delighted to be assured that\ntheir indifference to the woes of the poor, and even their positive\nagency in multiplying those woes, were providentially overruled for good,\nso as to be really rather praiseworthy than otherwise. The Malthus\ndoctrine also was very convenient as a means of turning the tables on\nreformers who proposed to abolish poverty by proving that, instead of\nbenefiting mankind, their reforms would only make matters worse in the\nend by overcrowding the earth and starving everybody. By means of the\nMalthus doctrine, the meanest man who ever ground the face of the poor\nhad no difficulty in showing that he was really a slightly disguised\nbenefactor of the race, while the philanthropist was an injurious fellow.\n\n\"This prodigious convenience of Malthusianism has an excuse for things as\nthey were, furnishes the explanation for the otherwise incomprehensible\nvogue of so absurd a theory. That absurdity consists in the fact that,\nwhile laying such stress on the direct effects of poverty and all the\nills it stands for to destroy life, it utterly failed to allow for the\nfar greater influence which the brutalizing circumstances of poverty\nexerted to promote the reckless multiplication of the species. Poverty,\nwith all its deadly consequences, slew its millions, but only after\nhaving, by means of its brutalizing conditions, promoted the reckless\nreproduction of tens of millions--that is to say, the Malthus doctrine\nrecognized only the secondary effects of misery and degradation in\nreducing population, and wholly overlooked their far more important\nprimary effect in multiplying it. That was its fatal fallacy.\n\n\"It was a fallacy the more inexcusable because Malthus and all his\nfollowers were surrounded by a society the conditions of which absolutely\nrefuted their theory. They had only to open then eyes to see that\nwherever the poverty and squalor chiefly abounded, which they vaunted as\nsuch valuable checks to population, humankind multiplied like rabbits,\nwhile in proportion as the economic level of a class was raised its\nproliferousness declined. What corollary from this fact of universal\nobservation could be more obvious than that the way to prevent reckless\noverpopulation was to raise, not to depress, the economic status of the\nmass, with all the general improvement in well-being which that implied?\nHow long do you suppose such an absurdly fundamental fallacy as underlay\nthe Malthus theory would have remained unexposed if Malthus had been a\nrevolutionist instead of a champion and defender of capitalism?\n\n\"But let Malthus go. While the low birth-rate among the cultured\nclasses--whose condition was the prototype of the general condition under\neconomic equality--was refutation enough of the overpopulation objection,\nyet there is another and far more conclusive answer, the full force of\nwhich remains to be brought out. You said a few moments ago that one\nreason why the birth-rate was so moderate among the cultured classes was\nthe fact that in that class the wishes of women were more considered than\nin the lower classes. The necessary effect of economic equality between\nthe sexes would mean, however, that, instead of being more or less\nconsidered, the wishes of women in all matters touching the subject we\nare discussing would be final and absolute. Previous to the establishment\nof economic equality by the great Revolution the non-child-bearing sex\nwas the sex which determined the question of child-bearing, and the\nnatural consequence was the possibility of a Malthus and his doctrine.\nNature has provided in the distress and inconvenience of the maternal\nfunction a sufficient check upon its abuse, just as she has in regard to\nall the other natural functions. But, in order that Nature's check should\nbe properly operative, it is necessary that the women through whose wills\nit must operate, if at all, should be absolutely free agents in the\ndisposition of themselves, and the necessary condition of that free\nagency is economic independence. That secured, while we may be sure that\nthe maternal instinct will forever prevent the race from dying out, the\nworld will be equally little in danger of being recklessly overcrowded.\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Equality, by Edward Bellamy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EQUALITY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7303.txt or 7303.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/3/0/7303/\n\nProduced by Thomas Berger, Eric Eldred, Charles Franks and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
