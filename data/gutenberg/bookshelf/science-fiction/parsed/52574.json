The Council of the Western Defense Alliance, as usual,\nhad made the decision. And, as usual, the WDA Coordinator had to tell\nthe Com Ambassador that the Coms had won again. The WDA would not risk\natomic war over a thirty-mile shift of a national border in southeast\nAsia.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Com Ambassador politely, \"it will be easier for\nyou personally if I admit that our Intelligence Service has reported\nthe decision of your Council.\" He paused, and added, \"in detail.\"\n\nThe Coordinator asked wearily, \"How much detail?\"\n\n\"First,\" said the Ambassador, \"you are to insist that no decision\nhas been reached. You are to play for time. If I do not agree, you\nare to offer to compromise. If I do not agree, you are to accept the\nsettlement we suggested. But you are to ask urgently for time in which\nto remove the citizens we might feel ought to be shot. This is not an\nabsolute condition, but you are to use every possible means to persuade\nme to grant it.\"\n\nThe Coordinator ground his teeth. But the Council wouldn't go to war\nfor a few thousand citizens of an Asiatic country--who would probably\nbe killed in the war anyhow. There would be millions killed in Western\ncountries if the war did come.\n\n\"I have much respect for you,\" said the Ambassador politely, \"so I\nagree to three days of delay during which you may evacuate disloyal\ncitizens by helicopter. On the fourth day our troops will move up to\nthe new border. It would be unfortunate if there were clashes on the\nway.\"\n\n\"We can't get them out in three days!\" protested the Coordinator. \"It's\nimpossible! We haven't enough copters!\"\n\n\"With warning to flee,\" said the Ambassador, \"many can reach the new\nborder on foot.\"\n\nThe Coordinator ground his teeth again. That would be a public\ndisgrace--and not the first one--for the WDA for not protecting its\nfriends. But the public in the Western nations did not want war. It\nwould not allow its governments to fight over trivial matters. Its\nalliance could not make threats. On the other hand, the public in the\nCom nations had no opinions its governments had not decreed. The Com\nnations could threaten. They could even carry out threats, though made\nfor trivialities. So the WDA found itself yielding upon one point after\nanother. Eventually it would fight, and fight bravely, but too late.\n\nThe Coordinator said heavily, \"You will excuse me, Mr. Ambassador. I\nhave to see about getting as many copters as possible to southeast\nAsia.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome hundreds of light-years away, the Survey ship _Lotus_ floated in\nspace, a discreet number of millions of miles from the local sun. It\nwas on a strictly scientific mission, so it would not be subject to\nCom suspicion of having undesirable political intentions. At least\nthey hadn't demanded to have an observer on board. Com intelligence\nreports were notoriously sound, however, and possibly spies had assured\ntheir employers that the _Lotus's_ mission was bona fide. Her errand\nwas the mapping and first-examination of a series of sol-type solar\nsystems. This was the ninth such system on the list. The third planet\nout from the sun, here, lay off to starboard. It was near enough to\nhave a visible disk to the naked eye, and moderate magnification\nshowed ice-caps and permanent surface markings that could be seas\nand continents. As was to be expected, it was very much like a more\nfamiliar third planet out--Earth.\n\nThe skipper gave Nolan the job of remote inspection while the gross\nexamination of the system went on. Nolan had a knack for such work,\nand much of it naturally fell to him.\n\n\"Okay!\" he said resignedly, \"Another day, another world!\"\n\n\"My private nightmare,\" said the skipper, with humor, \"is bug-eyed\nmonsters. Try not to find 'em here, Nolan. Eh?\"\n\nHe'd said that eight times before on this voyage. Nolan said, \"My\nprivate nightmare is getting home and finding out that while we've been\nfinding new worlds for men to live on, they've started a war and made\nEarth a place to die on. Try to arrange that it doesn't happen before\nwe get home. Eh?\"\n\nHe'd said that eight times before on this voyage, too.\n\n\"I wish us both luck. Nolan,\" said the skipper. \"But that ball out\nyonder looks plausible as a nest for bug-eyed monsters!\"\n\nHe shook his head and went out. He was still being humorous. Nolan\nset up his instruments and went to work. As he worked, he tried to\nthrust away the thoughts that came to everybody on Earth every day.\nThey were as haunting, some light-centuries from Earth, as back at\nhome. There was the base the Coms were building on the moon. The WDA\nhad an observatory there, but the Coms were believed to be mounting\nmany more rockets than telescopes. And there was that unsatisfying\nagreement made between the Coms and WDA just before the _Lotus_ took\noff. Each promised solemnly to notify the other of all space take-offs\nbefore they happened. The idea was to prevent a mistake by which a\nPearl-Harbor-style attack might be inferred when it wasn't really\nhappening. The fact that it could be prepared against was evidence of\nthe kind of tension back on Earth.\n\nBut the _Lotus_ was far from home. She lay some seventy-odd millions of\nmiles out from the sol-type star Fanuel Alpha, whose third planet Nolan\nwas to look over.\n\nHe sent off a distance-pulse and took angular measurements of the\nplanet's disk. The ratio of polar to equatorial diameters was\ninformative. The polar flattening said that the day lasted about thirty\nhours. Almost like Earth's. The equatorial diameter of 8200 miles was\nmuch like Earth's. The inclination of the axis of rotation indicated\nseasons--not exaggerated, but much like the seasons on the third planet\nof Sol. The size of the ice-caps indicated the overall planetary\ntemperature. There were clouds. In fact, there was a cloudmass in the\nsouthern hemisphere that looked just like an Earthly tropic storm\nundergoing the usual changes as it went away from the equator. This was\nvery much like Earth! And the dark masses which were seas....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNolan frowned. Those mud-colored patches were water. Undoubtedly. A\nnarrow-band light filter proved it. But the areas which were neither\nsea nor cloud mass? There were three levels of brightness to be seen on\nthe disk outside the polar areas. One was sea-bottom. One was cloud.\nThe other....\n\nNolan fretted a little. There was something wrong. The solid ground\nsurface of the planet was too light in color. It was such items that a\nperson with a knack for it would notice sooner than a man without the\nknack. Vegetation should be more nearly midway between sea-bottom and\ncloud mass in color.\n\nNolan fitted in the chlorophyll filter. On the planet of a sol-type\nsun, vegetation had to use chlorophyll or else. Through this filter the\nclouds would show, of course. They were white and reflected all colors\nof light. But no color that chlorophyll didn't reflect could pass\nthrough the filter.\n\nThe cloud masses showed clearly. Nothing else appeared. The filters\nwould have shown vegetation. It didn't. It said there wasn't any.\n\nNolan stepped up the magnification. He saw other things. He didn't like\nthem. He got some maximum-magnification pictures and interpreted them\nwith increasing grimness.\n\nHe went to make his report just as the system constants began to reach\nthe skipper. The local sun's mass was 1.3 sols. The solar rotation\nperiod was thirty-four days. There were sunspots of perfectly familiar\nkinds. The Lauriac Laws about the size and distribution of planets\nin a sol-type system were borne out. One was small, and its sunward\nside was probably at a low red heat. This was like Mercury. Planet\nTwo, like its analogue Venus in the home system, would be resolutely\nunoccupiable by man. Planet Four--analogous to Mars--was smaller than\nThree and had a very thin atmosphere. There were gas-giants in orbits\nsix and seven. Then a novelty Lauriac's laws predicted things about\nfifth planets, too, but they'd never been verified because fifth\nplanets were unstable. They blew up. Only fragments--asteroids--had so\nfar been noted where fifth planets of sol-type suns ought to be. But\nthere was a fifth planet here, rolling magnificently through emptiness.\nIt matched the Lauriac predictions. It had an atmosphere, which should\ncontain oxygen. It was the first sol-system fifth planet ever observed.\n\nThere was a babble in the skipper's office as the discoverers of the\nfifth planet told him about it.\n\nNolan said curtly, \"I've something more urgent to report. Planet Three\nought to be like Earth. It was. It isn't, any longer. It's dead!\"\n\nNobody paid attention. There was a fifth planet! It was unparalleled!\nAll the theories about the absence of fifth planets could now be\nchecked!\n\n\"I'm telling you,\" said Nolan sharply, \"that the third planet's dead!\nIt was alive, and something happened to it! It has seas and clouds and\nice-caps, and they're water! But its land surface is pure desert! Where\nlife can exist, it does. Always! Life did exist here. Now it doesn't.\"\nHe turned to the skipper, \"Maybe bug-eyed monsters killed it, skipper.\nIt looks to me like murder!\"\n\nThen they stared at him. He spread out his pictures. He pointed out\nthis item and that. They were conclusive. Nobody else might have\nrealized the facts behind them quite so soon, but when put together\nthey fitted.\n\n\"Familiar, eh?\" asked Nolan sardonically. \"You recognize the pictures\nlike them before. They weren't made with cameras, like these, but\nartists drew them from descriptions of what would happen. Here it's\nhappened! I think,\" he added, looking at the skipper, \"that this is\nmore important than fifth planets. I think we'd better go over and get\nwhat information we can and take it home. Death like this implies life\na lot like men. If non-human creatures can do something as human as\nthis, we'd better get the word back home so something can be done to\nget ready before we find them--or they find us.\"\n\nThe skipper went carefully over the pictures. On one he put his finger\non a feature Nolan hadn't mentioned. He seemed to wince.\n\n\"I think you win, Nolan,\" he said painfully. \"We'll send a drone down.\nI doubt we can land, but this ought to be checked. Immediately. Maybe I\nshould add--inconspicuously.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Confidentially,\" said the Com Ambassador to the Coordinator of the\nWDA, \"confidentially I agree that it is a trivial matter. But we are a\nnew nation. Our people lack perspective. They rejoice in the strength\nand vigor of the nation of which they are citizens. They will not allow\nthat nation to display what they consider weakness in any matter. One\nhas to allow for a certain exuberance in the people of a nation newly\nfreed from the tyranny of capitalists and warmongers such as still\nenslave the people of your countries. We cannot yield in this matter.\"\n\nThe Coordinator said:\n\n\"To be confidential in my turn, we both know that what you just said\nsimply isn't true. Your government decides what its public shall think.\nIt makes sure they don't think anything it doesn't want them to.\"\n\nThe Com Ambassador shrugged his shoulders. He was very polite. He did\nnot even pretend to resent being called a liar.\n\n\"Now, my country intends to move forward in this matter in ten days,\"\nhe observed. \"And it would be deplorable if our soldiers were fired on.\"\n\n\nII\n\nIt turned out that it wouldn't have mattered if the _Lotus_ had sent\nscreaming notifications of its presence throughout all nearby space.\nThere were detectors out, of course, but they reported absolutely\nnothing as the _Lotus_ moved on toward Planet Three. There was static\nfrom storms upon the planet. It grew louder as the survey ship\napproached. But there was no sign of anything alive.\n\nThe _Lotus_ cruised some two hundred miles above seas and cloud masses\nand desert, photographing as she followed a search pattern that covered\nall the sunlit hemisphere. There were mountains in the tropics which\nby all the rules of meteorology should have had rain forests at their\nfeet. They didn't. There was a river system which ran like the Nile for\na thousand miles or more, through deserts like those of Egypt. There\nshould have been at least a ribbon of vegetation along its banks. There\nwasn't. Where it reached the sea was an enormous delta.\n\nA drone went down and reported temperatures and humidity and the\ncomposition of the atmosphere, and the radiation background count. One\nwould have thought the records those of Earth. The background count\nwas a trifle high--3.9 instead of 3.6--but there was eighteen per cent\nof oxygen in the atmosphere. The only oddity, there, was nearly a full\nper cent of helium. When the drone came up it brought samples of soil\nand sea water. There was no life in either. The soil was mostly mineral\ndust, but an electron microscope disclosed abraded fractions of pollen\ngrains and the like. The sea water sample had evidently been picked up\nby the drone's dredge from some shallow. There were tiny, silicious\nshells in it. Plankton. They had been alive, but were so no longer.\n\n\"I think,\" said Nolan, \"that I make a landing. Right?\"\n\nThe skipper said crossly, \"Yes. You're the best man for it. You notice\nthings. But I doubt you'll learn very much.\" He tapped the written\nreport that the radiation background count was 3.9. \"It happened a\nlong time ago. A long, long time ago!\" Then he said with a totally\nunsuccessful attempt at humor, \"Try and find out that it was bug-eyed\nmonsters, eh? It looks too much like Earth! I'd rather blame monsters\nthan men!\"\n\nNolan growled and went to prepare for the landing. Two other men would\ngo with him, of course. The _Lotus_ wouldn't descend. It cost fuel to\nmake landings. Unless there was some remarkable specimen that a drone\ncouldn't handle the ship would stay aloft.\n\nSo a drone took three of them down to ground, a second drone following\nwith equipment. They had weapons, of course. Men never land anywhere\nwithout weapons. They had the material for a foam-house camp. They had\na roller-jeep, running on huge inflated bags. It would run efficiently\non anything from sand to swamp mud, and float itself across bogs or\nrivers. They had cameras and communicators. Nolan had picked Crawford\nfor geology and Kelley for communications. They could get other\nspecialists from the ship, if desirable.\n\nThe ground where they landed was desert: nothing more. There were\nenormous dunes like gigantic frozen swells of sand. Sometimes there\nwere miles between crests. They landed close to the mud banks northern\nice-cap to avoid the deep gorges in which rivers ran farther south. On\nthe first day they set up their camp.\n\nMountains reared to the north of them, covered almost to their bases\nwith ice. These they need not explore. Instruments would do most of\nthe landing-party work, in any case. But they inflated small balloons\nand sent them skyward, to learn about currents of the upper air, and\nCrawford took painstaking photographs of dune formations, and they set\nup a weather radar. They checked the water recovery from the camp's\nair-conditioner. It would supply their needs. When night drew near,\nwith all instruments recording, they watched the sunset.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was amazing how splendid and how magnificent a sunset could be. Not\nmany men see sunsets these days. The three of them, aground at the\nice-cap's edge, saw enormous mile-long dunes reaching away as far as it\nwas possible to see. They cast black shadows. Then glories of crimson\nand gold rose from the western horizon of this dead and empty world.\nThere was ice and snow upon the mountains, and unbelievable tints and\nblends of colors appeared there. After a long, long time the light\nfaded away. Then there was nothing to see but the stars, and nothing to\nlisten to at all. This world was dead. They went in their camp-house\nand shut out the dark and the silence.\n\nOn the second day, Nolan went in search of permafrost. Their\ninstruments faithfully recorded everything they needed except such\nitems as this. Nolan found permanent ice in a valley of the northern\nmountains. It was perpetually frozen ground which might not have thawed\nin a thousand thousand years. He dug down through surface ice to the\npermanently frozen soil beneath it. That soil was not desert sand.\nAnd preserved in it Nolan found the blackened roots of plants, and\nthe blackened blades of something like grass, and even some small,\nindefinite objects which had been seeds or fruit.\n\nThey hadn't died with the planet. They were far older than that\ncatastrophe. But they were proof that once this world lived and throve.\n\nDuring what was left of the day-light, Nolan and Kelley went south to\na river gorge and photographed it for the record. The river had cut a\ngorge a full two hundred feet deep in the wind-deposited dust which was\neverywhere. There were now-dry gullies which undercut the dune-sides\nand at times dumped mud into the slowly flowing liquid of the river.\nThere were no colorings save dust and mud. The river itself was mud. It\nflowed very, very slowly and without elation.\n\nThey came back depressed. An airless planet holds no life, but it\ndefies life to establish itself. A methane-ammonia planet fights the\nintrusion of men with monstrous frigid storms. But this world was\ndesigned for life. That it was dead was tragedy. Its rivers flowed\nsullen, syrupy mud which moved reluctantly toward the lifeless seas.\n\nKelley wouldn't look at the sunset this second night. He went into the\ncamp and turned on music. Crawford watched for a little while only.\nThere were clouds. There were breezes. One knew that here and there\nrain fell in gentle showers which should have nourished grasses and\nflowers and filled the air with fragrance. But instead it fell upon\nimpalpable dust and turned it to mud which flowed slowly into gullies\nand into rivers which were also mud and moved onward, until perhaps\nafter years the soil would become part of a mud-bank in the ocean.\n\nNolan came into the foam-walled house and said shortly, \"We'll finish\nup tomorrow and leave.\"\n\nKelley said abruptly. \"Nobody's made any guess about why everything\ndied, here. But we all know!\"\n\nCrawford said reflectively, \"It must've taken a lot of intelligence to\nmurder this planet. When d'you suppose it happened?\"\n\n\"Ten thousand--twenty thousand years ago,\" said Nolan. \"The whole place\nmust have been radioactive, air and all. But if they used cobalt the\nbackground count could be down to 3.9 in ten or twenty thousand years.\"\n\n\"We haven't,\" said Kelley, \"seen any craters. Even the pictures from\nout in space didn't show bomb-craters.\"\n\n\"When everything died and turned to dust,\" said Nolan, \"there'd be\ndust storms. There still must be. They'd cover anything! There was a\nterrific civilization in part of what's now the Sahara, back on Earth.\nBy pure accident they've found a patch of highway and a post-house.\nEverything else is covered up. Cities, highways, dams, canals.... And\nthat's heavy sand instead of fine dust! The _Lotus_ found some shadows\non a photo. They want us to look and see what cast them. We'll look at\nit tomorrow and then leave.\"\n\nCrawford said deliberately:\n\n\"We three have had a preview of what Earth will be like before too\nlong! I wonder if it would do any good on Earth to show them what we've\nfound?\"\n\n\"It's being argued on the ship,\" said Nolan. \"Some say we'd better\nsuppress the whole business.\"\n\nCrawford considered.\n\n\"The Coms aren't a very believing people,\" he said slowly. \"But our\npeople are. If we report this, our people will believe it. But the Coms\ncan tell their people it is lies. Our people will want peace more than\never if they see what a war will mean. But the big-shot Coms will just\ntake that as a reason to demand some more concessions, and more, and\nmore. Like demanding to build a base on the moon....\"\n\n\"I'm going to bed,\" said Nolan. He added ironically, \"I hope you have\npleasant dreams!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did go to bed, but he slept very badly. The others slept no better.\nAll three of them were up before sunrise. They saw it. And to Nolan\nthe coming of the light seemed somehow like an eager arrival of the\nnew day, anxious to see if some tiny thread of green somewhere lifted\nproudly from brown earth to greet it. But none ever did. Or would.\n\n\"We should be through by noon,\" said Nolan.\n\nThey set out in the jeep. They abandoned the camp. They would abandon\nthe jeep, too, presently, when they went up the ship that waited in\norbit.\n\nThey headed west, and Kelley took over the microwave set that sent a\nwide-fanning beacon skyward. The _Lotus_ was in orbit now. Every ninety\nminutes she was overhead. She'd completed the mapping of the planet.\nEvery square foot of its surface had been photographed from aloft.\n\nThey drove. The ungainly inflated bags which took the place of wheels\nrolled unweariedly, at first over dew-wetted dust and then over the\nminor gullies which, so near the ice-cap, were not yet gorges. They\nwent on for twenty miles, and the abomination of desolation was all\nabout them.\n\n\"We shouldn't tell about this back home,\" said Kelley abruptly.\n\"If the Com people saw it, they'd know that no--\" his tone was\nironic--\"national aspiration justified the risk of this. But they\nwouldn't see it. And our people might look at it and decide that\nanything was better than this. But it isn't.\"\n\nNolan said nothing. He didn't believe that the discovery of this dead\nplanet could be kept a secret for very long.\n\nThe mountains drew back to northward and the desert took their place.\nThe _Lotus_ went by overhead, unseen. But it gave a message to Kelley.\n\n\"We're on course,\" he reported. \"The ship just said so. Ten miles more.\"\n\nIn ten miles they came upon a city, or what had been one. It was\npartly buried in the omnipresent dust. That is, they saw part of a\ncity's remnants showing in the mile wide trough between dunes hundreds\nof feet high. There were other remnants between two other dunes,\nand still more in yet other troughs beyond. Structures of stone had\nexisted, and portions of them remained. They had cast shadows the\n_Lotus_ had discovered from aloft. The stone remains were abraded by\nthe dust-carrying winds of a hundred centuries. Their roofs had been\ncrushed when monster dunes formed over them. They had been reexposed\nto the sunshine when winds moved the dunes away. There was no metal\nleft. No glass. No artifacts. They had been buried tens or hundreds of\ntimes, and uncovered as many. There was nothing left but skeletons of\nstone which cast angular shadows, though their fragments were rounded\nby centuries of patient wind erosion.\n\nIt had been a very great city, but Nolan made the only observation\nthat could tell anything about its occupants.\n\n\"The builders of this city,\" he said tonelessly, \"used doors about the\nsame size we do.\"\n\nAnd that was all they could find out. Presently:\n\n\"New York will be like this eventually,\" said Crawford. \"And Chicago.\nAnd everywhere else.\"\n\nKelley spoke suddenly into the microwave transmitter. He said sharply\nto the ship, invisibly overhead:\n\n\"Yes! Send down the drone! We've had it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Council-member from Brazil made an impassioned speech in the\nsupposedly secret meeting of the Western Defense Alliance. He pointed\nout with bitter factuality that no past yielding to Com demands\nhad gained anything. Further yielding would be suicidal. He made a\nfierce demand that the WDA present a united front against this fresh\ndiplomatic pressure. That it refuse, flatly and firmly and with\nfinality, to make a single concession on a single point. It was a good\nspeech. It was an excellent speech. It and others like it should have\nbeen made a long time before. The Coordinator of the Western Defensive\nAlliance nodded at its end.\n\n\"I agree,\" he said, \"with every word the representative from Brazil has\nspoken. I think we all agree. The practical thing to do, of course, is\nto send a combined expeditionary force to maintain the independence\nof Sierra Leone. This force should be formed of contingents from every\nWestern Defense Alliance nation, and it should have orders to prevent\nthe entry of Com troops into Sierra Leone territory. I do not think\nthat anything less will prevent the extinction of another member nation\nof the Western Defense Alliance. Will any Council member propose such\naction for a vote?\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then babblings. It would mean war! It would mean\natomic war! Tens or hundreds of millions of human beings would die over\na matter affecting less than two hundred thousand! It was ridiculous!\nPublic opinion--\n\nThe Council meeting ended with no vote upon the matter. Without even a\nproposal on which a vote could be taken.\n\nTwo days later, Com troops from one of the African Com nations moved\nin and occupied Sierra Leone. A great many of its citizens were shot,\nsome for opposing the new state of affairs, but some seemingly just on\ngeneral principles.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe _Lotus_ went on toward Planet Five, leaving a world which should\nhave been alive and wasn't, to go to a world which should not exist,\nbut did. On the way there was argument which became embittered. In\ntheory, the discoveries made by a Survey ship became automatically\navailable to all the world. But the discovery of Three in the state it\nwas in would have political results on Earth.\n\nIt was--and is--a fact that nobody really believes in death until he\nsees a dead man. And nobody can believe in the destruction of a planet\nunless he's seen the corpse or color photographs of it. But that was\nprecisely what the _Lotus_ had to carry back to Earth. The WDA nations\nwould see those pictures and read the facts. They would believe in\natomic war and the complete sterilization of a world. The Com nations\nwould not see the pictures. They would continue to believe that the\nWest--the WDA--was decadent and enslaved to tyrannical warmongers,\nand obviously could not resist the splendid armed forces of the Com\nassociation. And they wouldn't really believe there could be more than\nisolated, crazy resistance to their valiant troops. So they'd back\ntheir leaders with enthusiasm, and the Western peoples at most would be\nmerely desperate.\n\nThe _Lotus_ arrived at Planet Four--which by the Lauriac laws should\nhave been similar to Mars. It was almost its twin. It had ice-caps\nof hoarfrost and its atmosphere was thin and barely contaminated by\noxygen. A base could be maintained here, of course, provided one had a\nsource of supply. A base here, incidentally, would have much the value\nof the Com base on Luna.\n\nThe _Lotus_ did not find that base. It found no cities or signs of\nsettlement. But it did find a bombcrater, miles across and it seemed\nmiles deep. There was an accumulation of reddish dust at its bottom,\ntrapped from the thin winds that blew over this half-frozen world.\n\nThe _Lotus_ went on to Planet Five.\n\nThe sun, so far out, was very small and its warmth was barely\nperceptible. But there was vegetation. The surface temperature was\nabove freezing. The Lauriac Laws had predicted that the central\nmetallic core would be small, and the greater part of its mass should\nbe stony. The radioactives in Earth's thin rocky crust produce\na constant flow of heat from the interior to the surface. It is\nconsidered that it is enough heat to melt a fraction of an inch of ice\nin a year. On this planet, with a crust many hundreds instead of mere\nscores of miles thickness, the internal heat was greater. The world was\nnot frozen, and life existed here. It was a pallid, unnatural sort of\nlife which had developed to live in starlight with a feeble assist from\na very bright nearby star which happened to be its sun.\n\nThere was a base here, too. Kelley located it when he found a resonant\nreturn of certain frequencies from the ground. It was not a reflection,\nbut resonance. And so they found the base.\n\nIt had been built by engineers the humans on the _Lotus_ could only\nadmire. There were gigantic doors which could admit the _Lotus_\nherself. They were rusted shut and had to be opened with explosives.\nThere were galleries and tunnels and laboratories. There were missile\nlaunchers and missile-storage chambers. There was a giant dome housing\na telescope men had not even dreamed of equalling. It was not an\noptical telescope.\n\nUltimately they found a mortuary, where the members of the garrison\nwere placed when they died. The _Lotus_ was not equipped for the\narcheological and technological studies the base called for. Its\nfunction was to scout out things for especially qualified expeditions\nto study. And, of course, there was the political situation back on\nEarth....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the fourth day after landing, the skipper sent for Nolan. The\nskipper sweated a little.\n\n\"Nolan,\" he said querulously, \"we've found something.\"\n\n\"A bug-eyed monster?\" asked Nolan dourly.\n\n\"No.\" The skipper mopped his forehead. \"Back yonder, on Three, you took\na few looks from twenty million miles and figured out what had happened\nthere. We'd have worked it out eventually, but you saw it at once.\nYou're lucky that way. Now we've found something. It's an--instrument.\nWe're short on time. Come with me and make some guesses.\"\n\nHe led the way, explaining jerkily as he went. The thing was in a room\nby itself, with its own air system and apparently its own food store.\nIt was inside four successive systems of locked doors--all of them\ninches-thick stainless steel. It was intended that the last door could\nbe opened from inside. It was evidently the very heart of the armed\nbase on Planet Five. Anything sealed up like that would have to be\neither incredibly valuable or incredibly dangerous.\n\nNolan followed through the shattered doors, and presently the skipper\nmade a helpless gesture. There was the discovery. It looked more like\nan old-fashioned telescope than anything else. It had a brass barrel,\nand it was very solidly mounted, and there were micro-micro adjustments\nto point it with almost infinite exactitude. It had been sealed in a\ncompletely air-tight environment, and what moisture was present had\ncombined with other metals. It wasn't rusted. There was an eyepiece,\nplaced in an improbable position, and there was a trigger. It wasn't\nlike a gun-trigger, but it couldn't have any other purpose. There was\nno porthole for it to fire through. The compartment in which it had\nbeen sealed was deep underground.\n\nNolan said uneasily:\n\n\"It's a weapon, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said the skipper. He mopped his forehead. \"I--I think we\nshould take it home. It might make a difference to WDA. But we don't\nknow what it does! It could be a mistake....\"\n\nNolan walked around it. He saw that it could be aimed in almost any\ndirection. But not quite. There was a direction that stops prevented it\nfrom pointing to. Nolan said:\n\n\"What's in that direction?\"\n\nThe skipper jumped. When Nolan asked the question he began to suspect\nmany answers. He said in a stricken voice, \"That's where the missiles\nwere launched--and where the others are stored.\"\n\nNolan stared at the thing. It looked hateful. It had the savage feel of\na frozen snarl.\n\n\"The power-pile?\"\n\nThe skipper nodded. He mopped his face again.\n\n\"Right alongside. We figured they wanted to shield the rest of the base\nfrom radioactives.\"\n\nNolan said carefully:\n\n\"It could be that they wanted to shield the radioactives from something\nin the base. Maybe something that would act on radioactives is\ninvolved.\" He said painfully, \"Men can't change the rate of fission\nexcept by building up a critical mass. But maybe--possibly bug-eyed\nmonsters could.\"\n\nThe skipper perspired. He'd have worked out the same thing in the long\nrun, but Nolan saw it right away. He went away and got the ship's\nengineers. They brought an X-ray for finding flaws in metal. They took\npictures of the inwards of the brass-barreled instrument in its place.\nThey traced two separate, incomprehensible circuits. But they were\nseparate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt long last the skipper nodded permission for Nolan to try the\neyepiece, to see what it showed with heavy metal and much soil and\nvegetation atop it. They taped the trigger so it could not be moved.\nThe controls affecting the eyepiece they left free. The skipper almost\ndripped sweat as Nolan turned on the eyepiece circuit, peering in.\n\nFor a long time he saw nothing whatever. Then a tiny disk moved slowly\ninto the eyepiece's field. It was barely larger than a point. Nolan\nmoved one of the eyepiece controls. The disk enlarged. It enlarged\nagain. A tiny red dot appeared in the center of the field of vision. As\nthe disk enlarged, the red dot grew larger and became a tiny red circle.\n\nNolan fumbled. He shifted the position of the instrument with a\nmicro-control. He moved the faintly glowing disk until it was enclosed\nin the red circle. He enlarged.... Presently the disk was very large,\nand the red circle ceased to enlarge. It enclosed only a part of the\ndisk.\n\nNolan felt cold chills down his spine. He swallowed and asked for\nthe angular relationship of Planet Four to Three. The skipper sent\nsomeone to find it out. But Nolan had found Planet Four before the\nanswer came. The first disk was in some fashion a representation of\nPlanet Three--the Earthlike world which was dead. The second was a\nrepresentation of Four. There was a bright spot near the equator of\nFour--the equator being located by the flattening of the poles. It\nwould be just about where a gigantic atom-bomb crater still existed.\n\nNolan drew back and took a deep breath.\n\n\"Apparently,\" he said unsteadily, \"this eyepiece detects radioactives,\nconverting something that I can't imagine into visible light after\nit's passed through a few feet of metal and a good many more of dirt.\nThere's a red ring which makes me think of a gun-sight. And there's a\ntrigger. Skipper, would you send half an ounce or so of ship-fuel out\nto space in a drone? I think we're going to have to pull this trigger.\"\n\nThe skipper wrung his hands. He went away. And Nolan stood staring at\nnothing in particular, appalled and sickened by the thoughts that came\nto him.\n\nPresently the skipper came back and mumbled that a drone was on the\nway up. Nolan searched for it with the eyepiece. He found it. The\nsensitivity of the eyepiece was practically beyond belief. What it\nworked on--what it transmuted and amplified to light--was wholly beyond\nhis imagination.\n\nThe drone went four thousand miles out. Nolan absently asked for\nsomebody to be posted out of doors, watching the sky. He got the vivid\nspark that was the half ounce of ship-fuel in the center of the red\nluminous ring. He turned his eyes away and pulled the trigger.\n\nThere was no sound. There was no vibration. There was no indication in\nthe underground room that anything at all had happened. There was only\na violent flare in the eyepiece, from which Nolan had just drawn back.\n\nSomeone came shouting from out of doors that there had been an\nintolerable flash of brilliance in the sky.\n\nA few moments later the word came that the drone control board\nindicated that the drone had ceased to exist.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Com Ambassador sighed a little when he saw the expression on the\nCoordinator's face. Interviews with the titular head of the alliance of\nall Western nations became increasingly a strain on his politeness. But\nthe Coordinator said grimly:\n\n\"I think I can guess what you're here to tell me!\"\n\nThe Com Ambassador said politely:\n\n\"It is painful to--ah--beat around the bush. May I speak plainly?\"\n\n\"Do,\" said the Coordinator.\n\n\"Our base on the Moon,\" said the Ambassador with a fine air of\nfrankness, \"some time ago reported military preparations on Earth,\namong the WDA nations. Those preparations could have no purpose other\nthan an unwarned attack upon us. We felt it necessary, then, to take\ncountermeasures of preparation only. We modified the plans for our moon\nbase to have it contain not only the telescopes and such observational\nequipment, but to have an adequate armament of missiles. It is now so\narmed.\"\n\nThe Coordinator whitened a little, but he did not look surprised.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I have to inform you,\" said the Com Ambassador, \"that any military\naction directed against any Com nation, or its troops, or the Union of\nCom Republics, will be met by atomic bombardment from the moon as well\nas--ah--our standard military establishments. This, of course, does not\nmean war. To the contrary, we hope that it will end the possibility of\nwar. We trust that all causes of tension between our nations will one\nby one be removed, and that an era of perpetual peace and prosperity\nwill follow.\"\n\nThe Coordinator's lips twisted in an entirely mirthless smile.\n\n\"Military action against Com troops,\" he observed, \"means resistance to\ninvasion or occupation, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It would be wiser,\" said the Ambassador carefully, \"to protest than to\nresist. At least, so it seems to me.\"\n\nThe Coordinator of the Western Defense Alliance said:\n\n\"Tell me something confidentially, Mr. Ambassador. How long before you\nexpect--no. You wouldn't answer that. Ah! How long do you think it will\nbe before I am shot?\"\n\nThe Com Ambassador said politely:\n\n\"I would hesitate to guess.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Lotus_ started back to Earth with the enigmatic weapon fastened\nfirmly in its cargo hold. Great pains had been taken to keep it from\nbeing knocked or shocked or battered in its transfer to the ship.\nFirmly anchored, Nolan had insisted that the stops, which prevented it\nfrom being aimed below the horizon or toward the radioactives in the\nbase, be adjusted so it could not be aimed at the _Lotus's_ own engines\nor fuel-stores. There were no missiles to worry about, of course.\n\nEven this precaution, however, roused doubt and uneasiness, especially\namong the scientific staff. It was highly probable that when the\n_Lotus_ reported in from space, the Coms would ask to examine such\nspecimens as she brought back. The request would be expressed as\nscientific interest, but a refusal would be treated as a concealment\nof dire designs. There were those on the ship who felt that the weapon\nshould be dismantled and made to seem meaningless, to avoid any chance\nof a humiliating squabble with the Coms.\n\nThe skipper roared at them. It was the only time on the voyage when\nhe displayed anger. But he glared at those who proposed the act of\ndiscretion. He drove them out of the cabin in which the suggestion was\nmade. He turned to Nolan, who definitely was not a party to it. His\nmanner changed. He said querulously:\n\n\"Nolan, why do you want that thing mounted so it could be used if\nnecessary?\"\n\n\"That's the way it was mounted on Planet Five. To box it or case it\nmight injure it. To take it apart might mean that it could never be got\ntogether in working order again.\"\n\n\"Is that the real reason?\" demanded the skipper. \"It's a good reason,\nbut is it the real one?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Nolan. \"It isn't.\"\n\nThe skipper fumed to himself.\n\n\"We might get home,\" he said fretfully, \"and find things just as we\nleft them. Then there'd be no harm in the mounting. We'd at least try\nto diddle the Coms and get it ashore without their knowing it was\nimportant. We might get home and find that war'd broken out and Earth\nwas dead like the Third Planet back yonder, only not all yet turned to\ndesert. Then the mounting wouldn't matter. Nothing would! Or we could\nfind that the Coms had smashed the West and were all cockahoop about\nwhat they'd managed to do in a sneak attack. So it had better stay\nmounted. I covered everything, didn't I?\"\n\nNolan wasn't feeling any better than anybody else on the _Lotus_. The\njitters that affected everybody but conditioned Coms had been bad when\nthe _Lotus_ went about its business. But when the ship headed for home,\nnerves got visibly worse. They didn't know what they'd find there.\nWith the third planet of Fanuel Alpha in mind, it was all too easy to\nbelieve in disaster.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" said Nolan painfully, \"that bothers me. I've\nbeen trying to think like a Com top brass. The WDA is a well meaning\norganization, and it's gained time, no doubt. But aside from the Com\nmissiles, ninety-five per cent of the atomic warheads on Earth are\nin the hands of just one WDA nation. It happens to be ours. It's\nbeen bearing most of the load of defense costs for the West. It's the\nrichest country in the world. There's practically no poverty in it.\"\n\n\"What has poverty to do with a possible war?\" demanded the skipper.\n\n\"Everything,\" Nolan said uncomfortably. \"The Coms take over a country.\nThey march in. There are rich people and poor people. The Coms start to\nhumiliate and destroy the rich. The poor people hated them. So the Coms\nare popular long enough to get things going right. But if they tried\nthat in our country--\"\n\n\"It wouldn't work,\" said the skipper. \"Not for a minute.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't,\" agreed Nolan. \"Most of our people think of themselves\nas well to do, and the rest can hope to become so. So the Coms would\nhave to try to govern two hundred million indignant and subversive\nunderground resisters. They couldn't hold down such a country. They\nwouldn't try!\"\n\nThe skipper blinked.\n\n\"If you mean they'd leave our country alone--\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Nolan. \"They'd destroy it. They'd have to. So they\nmight as well destroy it out of hand and destroy most of the fighting\npotential and a lot of resolution in the West. A well handled\natomic-missile bombardment and some luck, and they could take over the\nrest of the world without trouble. I think that's the practical thing\nfor them to do. I think they'll do it if they can.\"\n\nThe skipper grimaced. Then he said, almost ashamedly:\n\n\"Maybe we're talking nonsense, Nolan. Maybe we've just got bad cases of\nnerves. Maybe things have gotten better since we left. We could arrive\nback home and find nobody even dreaming of war any more!\"\n\n\"That,\" said Nolan, \"would scare me to death. That would be the time to\nmake a sneak attack!\"\n\nWhich was pessimism. But nothing else seemed justified. It was not even\neasy to be hopeful about the value of the fifth-planet weapon to the\nWestern Defensive Alliance. The WDA couldn't use it in a preventive\nwar. Their people wouldn't allow it. The initiative would always remain\nwith the Coms.\n\nThe _Lotus_ moved Earthward. She carried a more deadly instrument for\nwar than men had ever dreamed of. But the ship's company daily jittered\na little more violently.\n\nThe war might have been fought and be over by now. If it had, the Coms\nwould have won it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Coordinator for the WDA handed the Com Ambassador his passport.\n\n\"I'm sorry you've been recalled,\" he said heavily, \"Because I think I\nsee the meaning of the move.\"\n\n\"I am only called home for conference and instructions,\" said the\nAmbassador politely. \"I shall miss our friendly chats. We have had a\nvery fine personal relationship, though we have disagreed so often.\"\n\nThe Coordinator absently shifted objects on his desk. He said suddenly:\n\n\"Mr. Ambassador, have I ever lied to you?\"\n\nThe Ambassador raised his eyebrows. Then he smiled.\n\n\"Never!\" he said pleasantly. \"I have marveled!\"\n\nThe Coordinator took a quick, sharp breath.\n\n\"I shall not lie now,\" he said abruptly. \"I hope you will believe me,\nMr. Ambassador, when I tell you one of our best-kept military secrets.\"\n\nThe Ambassador blinked and then shrugged politely.\n\n\"You always astonish me,\" he said mildly.\n\n\"Your High Command,\" said the Coordinator grimly, \"has decided not to\ntry to take over the nation around us. It is considered impractical. So\nthis nation is to be destroyed, to shatter the backbone of the WDA and\nmake resistance anywhere else unthinkable.\"\n\nThe Ambassador said reproachfully:\n\n\"Ah, but you begin to believe your own propaganda!\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Coordinator. \"I have simply told you the facts you\nundoubtedly already know. Now I tell you our best-kept military\nsecret. We know that we cannot deal with you. We know that you might\nbe successful in an overwhelming, unwarned attack. We know that if you\ndecide upon war, it will be directed primarily at this nation. So\nwe have set up some very special atomic bombs where it is extremely\nunlikely that you will find them. They are 'dirty' bombs. They are\ndesigned to make the maximum possible amount of radioactive dust--of\nfallout. Timing mechanisms are set to detonate them. Every day a man\ngoes and sets back the timing mechanism in each place where a bomb\nis established. On the day that a man fails to do so the bombs will\ncertainly explode.\"\n\nThe Coordinator said almost briskly:\n\n\"We calculate that the bombs will make the atmosphere of the whole\nEarth lethally radioactive. They will raise the background count on\nEarth to the point where nothing can live: no plant, no animal, no fish\nin any sea. This will only happen if this nation is destroyed. It will\nfight if it is attacked, of course, but your chances of substantial\nsuccess are good. But if you are successful the Earth will die. I may\nadd that the people of the Com nations will die also, to the last\nindividual.\"\n\nThe Ambassador started to his feet.\n\n\"But you could not do that!\" he protested white-lipped. \"You cannot!\"\n\nThe Coordinator shrugged and shook his head.\n\n\"I have not lied to you before, Mr. Ambassador. I do not lie to you\nnow.\" Then he said formally: \"I hope you have a pleasant journey home.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nThe _Lotus_ came out of the usual sequence of arrival-hops no more than\nsix light-seconds from Earth. A million miles, more or less; perhaps\nfour times the distance of the Moon. Nolan examined the planet's sunlit\nface and said steadily:\n\n\"Nothing's happened yet.\"\n\nThere was almost agonized relief. Only the skipper did not seem to\nrelax. He went stolidly to the control-room and got out the scrambler\ncard that matched just one other scrambler card in the world. He put\nit in the communicator. To speak to Earth by scrambler would be an\noffense. It would be protested by the Coms. They would insist that a\nsurvey ship should have nothing secret to report and that anything\nsecret must be inimical to the Com Association of Nations.\n\nThe skipper formally reported in, in the clear, and then insisted\non completing his report by scrambler. He did complete it, over the\nagitated protest of the ground. Then there was silence. He mopped his\nforehead.\n\n\"Nolan, better get down to the eyepiece. The Coms could send something\nup to blast us. I'll get the detectors out. You be ready! You're sure\nyou can handle things?\"\n\n\"This is a little bit late to raise the question,\" said Nolan. \"I think\nI can do it, though.\"\n\nHe went down into the hold. He turned on the eyepiece. He saw the\ndistinct, luminous disk which was Earth in the not-at-all-believable\nfield of the impossible instrument. He saw points--not dots--of\nextremely vivid light. Obviously the size of a radioactive object did\nnot determine the brightness of its report to the weapon from Planet\nFive of Fanuel Alpha. Something else controlled the brilliance.\n\nHe saw the groupings of many dimensionless points of light. There were\nthe patterns which meant the silos holding the monster atomic missiles\nof the West. He could distinguish them from the much more concentrated\nfiring-points of the Com nations. The oceans had few or no bright\npoints at all. There were only so many atomic-powered ocean-going\nvessels. Nolan could tell well enough which were the Western\naccumulations of radioactives for defense purposes, and which were the\nCom stores of warheads.\n\nHis throat went dry as he realized the power in his hands. Neither he\nor anyone else could make one blade of grass grow, but he could turn\nthe third planet of this sun into a desert and a dreariness like the\nthird planet of another sun far, far away.\n\nThe skipper came into the hold. He locked the entrance door behind him.\n\n\"I got to the Coordinator,\" he said in a shaking voice. \"I started\nenough trouble by reporting by scrambler. He talked to me. I showed him\npictures. He's telling the Coms most of what I reported, saying that if\nthey like they can try to blast us. If they try, and don't succeed, we\ncan try to figure out what to do next.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Com premiership was in some ways the equivalent of the office of\nCoordinator of the Western Defense Alliance. But the men who held the\ntwo posts were quite unlike and the amount of authority they could\nexercise was vastly different. The Com premier read, again, the newly\narrived message from the Coordinator. The high officials he'd sent for\ncame streaming into the room. Most of them had flimsies of the message\nin their hands. The Premier beamed at them.\n\n\"You have the news,\" he said humorously. \"The WDA Coordinator first\nthreatened to make all Earth's air radioactive if we attacked\nthe--ah--leading member of the WDA and destroyed it. He has evidently\ndecided that this threat is not strong enough. So he assures us that\na Western survey ship has come back from an exploring voyage with a\ncargo of artifacts from a non-human civilization. Among the artifacts\nthere is what he says is the absolute weapon. He says that the skipper\nwho has brought it back claims that it can end the tension between\nthe WDA and us--by ending us!\" The Premier chuckled. \"He invites us\nto verify the skipper's claim by attempting to blast the survey ship,\nwhose coordinates of position he gives us. I think he has made a rather\nsubstantial error of judgment.\"\n\nHis eyes twinkled as he looked from one to another of the high\nofficials he had summoned.\n\n\"We accepted the invitation,\" said the Premier. \"Naturally! General?\"\n\nHe looked at a tall general officer with twin silver rockets in his\nlapels. The general said proudly:\n\n\"Yes, Excellency! Our space-radar located an object at the survey\nship's stated position. We sent six rockets with atomic warheads at\nit. We used satellite-placing rockets for maximum acceleration. They\nare well on their way now. Of course they can be disarmed or destroyed\nas well as maneuvered to intercept this survey ship if it attempts to\nflee. They will reach the target area in just under three hours.\"\n\nThe Premier nodded, very humorously.\n\n\"Since we accepted their invitation, naturally the Western staff\nconcludes that we are disturbed. That we will wait to see what our\nrockets learn. It would be interesting, but our scientists tell me that\nthe alleged weapon is impossible. Utterly impossible! So it is merely a\ntrick.... And we will not wait for our rockets to arrive. We might be\nlate for our dinners, and we would not like that!\"\n\nThe high officials made sounds of amusement.\n\n\"So we put our own ending to the comedy,\" said the Premier blandly.\n\"The circuits are joined?\" He asked the question of a craggy-faced\nservice-of-supply colonel. The colonel managed to nod, and was\nstricken numb by the importance of the gesture.\n\n\"Then,\" said the Premier humorously, \"we will destroy our enemy.\"\n\nHe waddled across the room. He put a pudgy forefinger on a button. He\npushed it.\n\nEven here, deep underground, there were roaring sounds as rockets took\noff for the west. All over the Com nations, carefully distributed\nrocket-firing sites received signals from the one pushbutton. They sent\nbellowing monsters up into the sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree Com rockets reached their targets, and Nolan never quite forgave\nhimself for it. They were murderous. They wiped out cities. But that\nwas all. The rest of the rockets went off prematurely. A spread of half\na hundred, crossing the North Pole, detonated just out of atmosphere.\nOthers went off over the Atlantic. Not a few made temporary suns above\nthe Pacific. Nolan brought moving specks within the thin red circle of\nhis instrument, and pulled the trigger. The points flamed momentarily\nand left patches of luminosity behind them. And that was that.\n\nBut they continued to rise. On Earth they made noises like dragons.\nThere was panic from their starting points. Those first out had not\nreached their targets! So the Com launching-sites flung more and more\nmissiles skyward. One of them reached a city of the West. A second. A\nthird.\n\nThe only possible answer was to blast them as they rose. Then to blast\nthem before they rose. Nolan's task became the terribly necessary one\nof preventing radioactives from moving away from Com territory and\ninto WDA nations--specifically one WDA nation. He did not think of the\nconsequences of his actions except in terms of preventing excessively\nbright mathematical points of light from getting to the areas where\nthere were so many fewer points of similar light which did not move at\nall. He tried to stop only those that moved.\n\nBut three got by him, and he could do nothing but detonate all the\nradioactives in Com territory. He had to! When that was done, there\nwere six warheads coming up from Earth. He detonated them. There were\nmassed warheads moving toward Earth from the Moon. It seemed that they\npractically tore space apart that they went off together. Then the moon\nbase began to fire rockets, hysterically, at the _Lotus_, and it was\nnecessary to detonate the radioactives in the moon base.\n\nIt had been estimated that an atomic war might be over in three hours.\nBut prophecies are usually underestimates. Between the first and last\nexplosions on Earth, in space and on the moon--there was a truly\ngigantic crater where the Com base had been--some thirty-seven minutes\nelapsed. Then the war was over.\n\nThere were some survivors in Com territory, of course. But they\ncouldn't retaliate for the destruction of their nations. Their own\nbombs had done the destruction. They couldn't even gloat that the\nrest of Earth shared their catastrophe. It didn't. Most of the bombs\nexploded high, and over ocean. No less than three-fifths of all fallout\nlanded in the sea and sank immediately. For the rest, the background\ncount on Earth nowhere went above 4.9, and people could be protected\nagainst that.\n\nThe survey ship _Lotus_ came gingerly down to ground. There was no\nlonger any reason for tension. Its crew reported in and scattered to\nthe various places they called home. They were very glad to be back. In\nthe course of time they were all suitably bemedalled and admired and\ntold that their names would live forever. Of course, it was not true.\n\nNolan didn't pay much attention to this. He left the Survey. He went\nto live in a small town. He married a small-town girl. And he never,\nnever, never took any one of the excursions so many WDA people took\nto see the result of atomic explosions in Com territory, when their\nattempt to murder one Western nation backfired. Nolan had caused that\nbackfiring. He very passionately did not want to see its results.\n\nHe'd seen all he wanted of that sort of thing on the third planet of a\nsol-type sun, some light-centuries from Earth.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Third Planet, by Murray Leinster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THIRD PLANET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 52574.txt or 52574.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/2/5/7/52574/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
