And at the time I thought\nthat so far as he was concerned it was a true story.\n\nHe told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that\nI could not do otherwise than believe in him.  But in the morning,\nin my own flat, I woke to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in\nbed and recalled the things he had told me, stripped of the glamour\nof his earnest slow voice, denuded of the focussed shaded table\nlight, the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and the\npleasant bright things, the dessert and glasses and napery of the\ndinner we had shared, making them for the time a bright little\nworld quite cut off from every-day realities, I saw it all as\nfrankly incredible.  \"He was mystifying!\" I said, and then: \"How\nwell he did it!. . . . .  It isn't quite the thing I should have\nexpected him, of all people, to do well.\"\n\nAfterwards, as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I\nfound myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that\nperplexed me in his impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did\nin some way suggest, present, convey--I hardly know which word to\nuse--experiences it was otherwise impossible to tell.\n\nWell, I don't resort to that explanation now.  I have got over\nmy intervening doubts.  I believe now, as I believed at the moment\nof telling, that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip\nthe truth of his secret for me.  But whether he himself saw, or\nonly thought he saw, whether he himself was the possessor of an\ninestimable privilege, or the victim of a fantastic dream, I cannot\npretend to guess.  Even the facts of his death, which ended my\ndoubts forever, throw no light on that.  That much the reader must\njudge for himself.\n\nI forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so\nreticent a man to confide in me.  He was, I think, defending\nhimself against an imputation of slackness and unreliability I had\nmade in relation to a great public movement in which he had\ndisappointed me.  But he plunged suddenly.  \"I have\" he said, \"a\npreoccupation--\"\n\n\"I know,\" he went on, after a pause that he devoted to the\nstudy of his cigar ash, \"I have been negligent.  The fact is--it\nisn't a case of ghosts or apparitions--but--it's an odd thing to\ntell of, Redmond--I am haunted.  I am haunted by something--that\nrather takes the light out of things, that fills me with longings\n. . . . .\"\n\nHe paused, checked by that English shyness that so often\novercomes us when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful\nthings.  \"You were at Saint Athelstan's all through,\" he said, and\nfor a moment that seemed to me quite irrelevant.  \"Well\"--and he\npaused.  Then very haltingly at first, but afterwards more easily,\nhe began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his life, the\nhaunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart\nwith insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle\nof worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him.\n\nNow that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written\nvisibly in his face.  I have a photograph in which that look of\ndetachment has been caught and intensified.  It reminds me of what\na woman once said of him--a woman who had loved him greatly.\n\"Suddenly,\" she said, \"the interest goes out of him.  He forgets\nyou.  He doesn't care a rap for you--under his very nose . . . . .\"\n\nYet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was\nholding his attention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an\nextremely successful man.  His career, indeed, is set with\nsuccesses.  He left me behind him long ago; he soared up over my\nhead, and cut a figure in the world that I couldn't cut--anyhow.\nHe was still a year short of forty, and they say now that he would\nhave been in office and very probably in the new Cabinet if he had\nlived.  At school he always beat me without effort--as it were by\nnature.  We were at school together at Saint Athelstan's College in\nWest Kensington for almost all our school time.  He came into the\nschool as my co-equal, but he left far above me, in a blaze of\nscholarships and brilliant performance.  Yet I think I made a fair\naverage running.  And it was at school I heard first of the Door in\nthe Wall--that I was to hear of a second time only a month before\nhis death.\n\nTo him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door leading\nthrough a real wall to immortal realities.  Of that I am now quite\nassured.\n\nAnd it came into his life early, when he was a little fellow\nbetween five and six.  I remember how, as he sat making his\nconfession to me with a slow gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the\ndate of it.  \"There was,\" he said, \"a crimson Virginia creeper in\nit--all one bright uniform crimson in a clear amber sunshine\nagainst a white wall.  That came into the impression somehow,\nthough I don't clearly remember how, and there were horse-chestnut\nleaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door.  They were\nblotched yellow and green, you know, not brown nor dirty, so that\nthey must have been new fallen.  I take it that means October.  I\nlook out for horse-chestnut leaves every year, and I ought to know.\n\n\"If I'm right in that, I was about five years and four months old.\"\n\nHe was, he said, rather a precocious little boy--he learned to\ntalk at an abnormally early age, and he was so sane and\n\"old-fashioned,\" as people say, that he was permitted an amount of\ninitiative that most children scarcely attain by seven or eight.\nHis mother died when he was born, and he was under the less\nvigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess.  His father\nwas a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave him little attention, and\nexpected great things of him.  For all his brightness he found life\na little grey and dull I think.  And one day he wandered.\n\nHe could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to\nget away, nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads.\nAll that had faded among the incurable blurs of memory.  But the\nwhite wall and the green door stood out quite distinctly.\n\nAs his memory of that remote childish experience ran, he did\nat the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion,\nan attraction, a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in.\nAnd at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it\nwas unwise or it was wrong of him--he could not tell which--to\nyield to this attraction.  He insisted upon it as a curious thing\nthat he knew from the very beginning--unless memory has played him\nthe queerest trick--that the door was unfastened, and that he could\ngo in as he chose.\n\nI seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and\nrepelled.  And it was very clear in his mind, too, though why it\nshould be so was never explained, that his father would be very\nangry if he went through that door.\n\nWallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with\nthe utmost particularity.  He went right past the door, and then,\nwith his hands in his pockets, and making an infantile attempt to\nwhistle, strolled right along beyond the end of the wall.  There he\nrecalls a number of mean, dirty shops, and particularly that of a\nplumber and decorator, with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes,\nsheet lead ball taps, pattern books of wall paper, and tins of\nenamel.  He stood pretending to examine these things, and coveting,\npassionately desiring the green door.\n\nThen, he said, he had a gust of emotion.  He made a run for\nit, lest hesitation should grip him again, he went plump with\noutstretched hand through the green door and let it slam behind\nhim.  And so, in a trice, he came into the garden that has haunted\nall his life.\n\nIt was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of\nthat garden into which he came.\n\nThere was something in the very air of it that exhilarated,\nthat gave one a sense of lightness and good happening and well\nbeing; there was something in the sight of it that made all its\ncolour clean and perfect and subtly luminous.  In the instant of\ncoming into it one was exquisitely glad--as only in rare moments\nand when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this world.\nAnd everything was beautiful there . . . . .\n\nWallace mused before he went on telling me.  \"You see,\" he\nsaid, with the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at\nincredible things, \"there were two great panthers there . . . Yes,\nspotted panthers.  And I was not afraid.  There was a long wide\npath with marble-edged flower borders on either side, and these two\nhuge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball.  One looked up\nand came towards me, a little curious as it seemed.  It came right\nup to me, rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small\nhand I held out and purred.  It was, I tell you, an enchanted\ngarden.  I know.  And the size?  Oh! it stretched far and wide,\nthis way and that.  I believe there were hills far away.  Heaven\nknows where West Kensington had suddenly got to.  And somehow it\nwas just like coming home.\n\n\"You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I\nforgot the road with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and\ntradesmen's carts, I forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to\nthe discipline and obedience of home, I forgot all hesitations and\nfear, forgot discretion, forgot all the intimate realities of this\nlife.  I became in a moment a very glad and wonder-happy little\nboy--in another world.  It was a world with a different quality, a\nwarmer, more penetrating and mellower light, with a faint clear\ngladness in its air, and wisps of sun-touched cloud in the blueness\nof its sky.  And before me ran this long wide path, invitingly,\nwith weedless beds on either side, rich with untended flowers, and\nthese two great panthers.  I put my little hands fearlessly on\ntheir soft fur, and caressed their round ears and the sensitive\ncorners under their ears, and played with them, and it was as\nthough they welcomed me home.  There was a keen sense of\nhome-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall, fair girl\nappeared in the pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said\n'Well?' to me, and lifted me, and kissed me, and put me down, and\nled me by the hand, there was no amazement, but only an impression\nof delightful rightness, of being reminded of happy things that had\nin some strange way been overlooked.  There were broad steps, I\nremember, that came into view between spikes of delphinium, and up\nthese we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark\ntrees.  All down this avenue, you know, between the red chapped\nstems, were marble seats of honour and statuary, and very tame and\nfriendly white doves . . . . .\n\n\"And along this avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down--I\nrecall the pleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet\nkind face--asking me questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and\ntelling me things, pleasant things I know, though what they were I\nwas never able to recall . . .  And presently a little Capuchin\nmonkey, very clean, with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel\neyes, came down a tree to us and ran beside me, looking up at me\nand grinning, and presently leapt to my shoulder.  So we went on\nour way in great happiness . . . .\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"Go on,\" I said.\n\n\"I remember little things.  We passed an old man musing among\nlaurels, I remember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came\nthrough a broad shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of\npleasant fountains, full of beautiful things, full of the quality\nand promise of heart's desire.  And there were many things and many\npeople, some that still seem to stand out clearly and some that are\na little vague, but all these people were beautiful and kind.  In\nsome way--I don't know how--it was conveyed to me that they all\nwere kind to me, glad to have me there, and filling me with\ngladness by their gestures, by the touch of their hands, by the\nwelcome and love in their eyes.  Yes--\"\n\nHe mused for awhile.  \"Playmates I found there.  That was very\nmuch to me, because I was a lonely little boy.  They played\ndelightful games in a grass-covered court where there was a\nsun-dial set about with flowers.  And as one played one loved . . . .\n\n\"But--it's odd--there's a gap in my memory.  I don't remember the\ngames we played.  I never remembered.  Afterwards, as a child, I\nspent long hours trying, even with tears, to recall the form of that\nhappiness.  I wanted to play it all over again--in my nursery--by\nmyself.  No!  All I remember is the happiness and two dear\nplayfellows who were most with me . . . .  Then presently came a\nsombre dark woman, with a grave, pale face and dreamy eyes, a\nsombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple, who carried\na book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above\na hall--though my playmates were loth to have me go, and ceased\ntheir game and stood watching as I was carried away.  'Come back to\nus!' they cried.  'Come back to us soon!' I looked up at her face,\nbut she heeded them not at all.  Her face was very gentle and\ngrave.  She took me to a seat in the gallery, and I stood beside\nher, ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee.  The\npages fell open.  She pointed, and I looked, marvelling, for in the\nliving pages of that book I saw myself; it was a story about\nmyself, and in it were all the things that had happened to me since\never I was born . . . .\n\n\"It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were\nnot pictures, you understand, but realities.\"\n\nWallace paused gravely--looked at me doubtfully.\n\n\"Go on,\" I said.  \"I understand.\"\n\n\"They were realities--yes, they must have been; people moved\nand things came and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near\nforgotten; then my father, stern and upright, the servants, the\nnursery, all the familiar things of home.  Then the front door and\nthe busy streets, with traffic to and fro: I looked and marvelled,\nand looked half doubtfully again into the woman's face and turned\nthe pages over, skipping this and that, to see more of this book,\nand more, and so at last I came to myself hovering and hesitating\noutside the green door in the long white wall, and felt again the\nconflict and the fear.\n\n\"'And next?' I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool\nhand of the grave woman delayed me.\n\n\"'Next?' I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand,\npulling up her fingers with all my childish strength, and as she\nyielded and the page came over she bent down upon me like a shadow\nand kissed my brow.\n\n\"But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the\npanthers, nor the girl who had led me by the hand, nor the\nplayfellows who had been so loth to let me go.  It showed a long\ngrey street in West Kensington, on that chill hour of afternoon\nbefore the lamps are lit, and I was there, a wretched little\nfigure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do to restrain myself,\nand I was weeping because I could not return to my dear\nplay-fellows who had called after me, 'Come back to us!  Come back\nto us soon!'  I was there.  This was no page in a book, but harsh\nreality; that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave\nmother at whose knee I stood had gone--whither have they gone?\"\n\nHe halted again, and remained for a time, staring into the fire.\n\n\"Oh! the wretchedness of that return!\" he murmured.\n\n\"Well?\" I said after a minute or so.\n\n\"Poor little wretch I was--brought back to this grey world\nagain!  As I realised the fulness of what had happened to me, I\ngave way to quite ungovernable grief.  And the shame and\nhumiliation of that public weeping and my disgraceful homecoming\nremain with me still.  I see again the benevolent-looking old\ngentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to me--prodding\nme first with his umbrella.  'Poor little chap,' said he; 'and are\nyou lost then?'--and me a London boy of five and more!  And he must\nneeds bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me, and\nso march me home.  Sobbing, conspicuous and frightened, I came from\nthe enchanted garden to the steps of my father's house.\n\n\"That is as well as I can remember my vision of that\ngarden--the garden that haunts me still.  Of course, I can convey\nnothing of that indescribable quality of translucent unreality,\nthat difference from the common things of experience that hung\nabout it all; but that--that is what happened.  If it was a dream,\nI am sure it was a day-time and altogether extraordinary dream . .\n. . . .  H'm!--naturally there followed a terrible questioning, by\nmy aunt, my father, the nurse, the governess--everyone . . . . . .\n\n\"I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first\nthrashing for telling lies.  When afterwards I tried to tell my\naunt, she punished me again for my wicked persistence.  Then, as I\nsaid, everyone was forbidden to listen to me, to hear a word about\nit.  Even my fairy tale books were taken away from me for a\ntime--because I was 'too imaginative.' Eh?  Yes, they did that!  My\nfather belonged to the old school . . . . . And my story was driven\nback upon myself.  I whispered it to my pillow--my pillow that was\noften damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears.  And\nI added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one\nheartfelt request: 'Please God I may dream of the garden.  Oh! take\nme back to my garden!  Take me back to my garden!'\n\n\"I dreamt often of the garden.  I may have added to it, I may\nhave changed it; I do not know . . . . .  All this you understand\nis an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early\nexperience.  Between that and the other consecutive memories of my\nboyhood there is a gulf.  A time came when it seemed impossible I\nshould ever speak of that wonder glimpse again.\"\n\nI asked an obvious question.\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"I don't remember that I ever attempted to\nfind my way back to the garden in those early years.  This seems\nodd to me now, but I think that very probably a closer watch was\nkept on my movements after this misadventure to prevent my going\nastray.  No, it wasn't until you knew me that I tried for the\ngarden again.  And I believe there was a period--incredible as it\nseems now--when I forgot the garden altogether--when I was about\neight or nine it may have been.  Do you remember me as a kid at\nSaint Athelstan's?\"\n\n\"Rather!\"\n\n\"I didn't show any signs did I in those days of having a secret dream?\"\n\n\nII\n\n\nHe looked up with a sudden smile.\n\n\"Did you ever play North-West Passage with me? . . . . .  No,\nof course you didn't come my way!\"\n\n\"It was the sort of game,\" he went on, \"that every imaginative\nchild plays all day.  The idea was the discovery of a North-West\nPassage to school.  The way to school was plain enough; the game\nconsisted in finding some way that wasn't plain, starting off ten\nminutes early in some almost hopeless direction, and working one's\nway round through unaccustomed streets to my goal.  And one day I\ngot entangled among some rather low-class streets on the other side\nof Campden Hill, and I began to think that for once the game would\nbe against me and that I should get to school late.  I tried rather\ndesperately a street that seemed a _cul de sac_, and found a\npassage at the end.  I hurried through that with renewed hope.  'I\nshall do it yet,' I said, and passed a row of frowsy little shops\nthat were inexplicably familiar to me, and behold! there was my\nlong white wall and the green door that led to the enchanted\ngarden!\n\n\"The thing whacked upon me suddenly.  Then, after all, that garden,\nthat wonderful garden, wasn't a dream!\" . . . .\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the\nworld of difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy\nand the infinite leisure of a child.  Anyhow, this second time I\ndidn't for a moment think of going in straight away.  You see . . .\nFor one thing my mind was full of the idea of getting to school\nin time--set on not breaking my record for punctuality.  I must\nsurely have felt _some_ little desire at least to try the\ndoor--yes, I must have felt that . . . . .  But I seem to remember\nthe attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my\novermastering determination to get to school.  I was immediately\ninterested by this discovery I had made, of course--I went on with\nmy mind full of it--but I went on.  It didn't check me.  I ran past\ntugging out my watch, found I had ten minutes still to spare, and\nthen I was going downhill into familiar surroundings.  I got to\nschool, breathless, it is true, and wet with perspiration, but in\ntime.  I can remember hanging up my coat and hat . . . Went right\nby it and left it behind me.  Odd, eh?\"\n\nHe looked at me thoughtfully.  \"Of course, I didn't know then\nthat it wouldn't always be there.  School boys have limited\nimaginations.  I suppose I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to\nhave it there, to know my way back to it, but there was the school\ntugging at me.  I expect I was a good deal distraught and\ninattentive that morning, recalling what I could of the beautiful\nstrange people I should presently see again.  Oddly enough I had no\ndoubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me . . . Yes, I\nmust have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort\nof place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous\nscholastic career.\n\n\"I didn't go that day at all.  The next day was a half\nholiday, and that may have weighed with me.  Perhaps, too, my state\nof inattention brought down impositions upon me and docked the\nmargin of time necessary for the detour.  I don't know.  What I do\nknow is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon\nmy mind that I could not keep it to myself.\n\n\"I told--What was his name?--a ferrety-looking youngster we\nused to call Squiff.\"\n\n\"Young Hopkins,\" said I.\n\n\"Hopkins it was.  I did not like telling him, I had a feeling\nthat in some way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did.\nHe was walking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and\nif we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have\ntalked of something else, and it was intolerable to me to think\nabout any other subject.  So I blabbed.\n\n\"Well, he told my secret.  The next day in the play interval\nI found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing\nand wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden.  There was\nthat big Fawcett--you remember him?--and Carnaby and Morley\nReynolds.  You weren't there by any chance?  No, I think I should\nhave remembered if you were . . . . .\n\n\"A boy is a creature of odd feelings.  I was, I really\nbelieve, in spite of my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to\nhave the attention of these big fellows.  I remember particularly\na moment of pleasure caused by the praise of Crawshaw--you remember\nCrawshaw major, the son of Crawshaw the composer?--who said it was\nthe best lie he had ever heard.  But at the same time there was a\nreally painful undertow of shame at telling what I felt was indeed\na sacred secret.  That beast Fawcett made a joke about the girl in\ngreen--.\"\n\nWallace's voice sank with the keen memory of that shame.  \"I\npretended not to hear,\" he said.  \"Well, then Carnaby suddenly\ncalled me a young liar and disputed with me when I said the thing\nwas true.  I said I knew where to find the green door, could lead\nthem all there in ten minutes.   Carnaby became outrageously\nvirtuous, and said I'd have to--and bear out my words or suffer.\nDid you ever have Carnaby twist your arm?  Then perhaps you'll\nunderstand how it went with me.  I swore my story was true.  There\nwas nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby though\nCrawshaw put in a word or so.  Carnaby had got his game.  I grew\nexcited and red-eared, and a little frightened, I behaved\naltogether like a silly little chap, and the outcome of it all was\nthat instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the\nway presently--cheeks flushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul\none burning misery and shame--for a party of six mocking, curious\nand threatening school-fellows.\n\n\"We never found the white wall and the green door . . .\"\n\n\"You mean?--\"\n\n\"I mean I couldn't find it.  I would have found it if I could.\n\n\"And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn't find it.  I\nnever found it.  I seem now to have been always looking for it\nthrough my school-boy days, but I've never come upon it again.\"\n\n\"Did the fellows--make it disagreeable?\"\n\n\"Beastly . . . . .  Carnaby held a council over me for wanton\nlying.  I remember how I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the\nmarks of my blubbering.  But when I cried myself to sleep at last\nit wasn't for Carnaby, but for the garden, for the beautiful\nafternoon I had hoped for, for the sweet friendly women and the\nwaiting playfellows and the game I had hoped to learn again, that\nbeautiful forgotten game . . . . .\n\n\"I believed firmly that if I had not told-- . . . . .  I had\nbad times after that--crying at night and wool-gathering by day.\nFor two terms I slackened and had bad reports.  Do you remember?\nOf course you would!  It was _you_--your beating me in mathematics\nthat brought me back to the grind again.\"\n\n\nIII\n\n\nFor a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the\nfire.  Then he said: \"I never saw it again until I was seventeen.\n\n\"It leapt upon me for the third time--as I was driving to\nPaddington on my way to Oxford and a scholarship.  I had just one\nmomentary glimpse.  I was leaning over the apron of my hansom\nsmoking a cigarette, and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man\nof the world, and suddenly there was the door, the wall, the dear\nsense of unforgettable and still attainable things.\n\n\"We clattered by--I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until\nwe were well past and round a corner.  Then I had a queer moment,\na double and divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little\ndoor in the roof of the cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my\nwatch.  'Yes, sir!' said the cabman, smartly.  'Er--well--it's\nnothing,' I cried.  '_My_ mistake!  We haven't much time!  Go\non!' and he went on . . .\n\n\"I got my scholarship.  And the night after I was told of that\nI sat over my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my\nfather's house, with his praise--his rare praise--and his sound\ncounsels ringing in my ears, and I smoked my favourite pipe--the\nformidable bulldog of adolescence--and thought of that door in the\nlong white wall.  'If I had stopped,' I thought, 'I should have\nmissed my scholarship, I should have missed Oxford--muddled all the\nfine career before me!  I begin to see things better!' I fell\nmusing deeply, but I did not doubt then this career of mine was a\nthing that merited sacrifice.\n\n\"Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very\nsweet to me, very fine, but remote.  My grip was fixing now upon\nthe world.  I saw another door opening--the door of my career.\"\n\nHe stared again into the fire.  Its red lights picked out a\nstubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment, and\nthen it vanished again.\n\n\"Well\", he said and sighed, \"I have served that career.  I\nhave done--much work, much hard work.  But I have dreamt of the\nenchanted garden a thousand dreams, and seen its door, or at least\nglimpsed its door, four times since then.  Yes--four times.  For a\nwhile this world was so bright and interesting, seemed so full of\nmeaning and opportunity that the half-effaced charm of the garden\nwas by comparison gentle and remote.  Who wants to pat panthers on\nthe way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men?  I came\ndown to London from Oxford, a man of bold promise that I have done\nsomething to redeem.  Something--and yet there have been\ndisappointments . . . . .\n\n\"Twice I have been in love--I will not dwell on that--but\nonce, as I went to someone who, I know, doubted whether I dared to\ncome, I took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road\nnear Earl's Court, and so happened on a white wall and a familiar\ngreen door.  'Odd!' said I to myself, 'but I thought this place was\non Campden Hill.  It's the place I never could find somehow--like\ncounting Stonehenge--the place of that queer day dream of mine.'\nAnd I went by it intent upon my purpose.  It had no appeal to me\nthat afternoon.\n\n\"I had just a moment's impulse to try the door, three steps\naside were needed at the most--though I was sure enough in my heart\nthat it would open to me--and then I thought that doing so might\ndelay me on the way to that appointment in which I thought my\nhonour was involved.  Afterwards I was sorry for my punctuality--I\nmight at least have peeped in I thought, and waved a hand to those\npanthers, but I knew enough by this time not to seek again\nbelatedly that which is not found by seeking.  Yes, that time made\nme very sorry . . . . .\n\n\"Years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door.\nIt's only recently it has come back to me.  With it there has come\na sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world.\nI began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should\nnever see that door again.  Perhaps I was suffering a little from\noverwork--perhaps it was what I've heard spoken of as the feeling\nof forty.  I don't know.  But certainly the keen brightness that\nmakes effort easy has gone out of things recently, and that just\nat a time with all these new political developments--when I ought to\nbe working.  Odd, isn't it?  But I do begin to find life toilsome,\nits rewards, as I come near them, cheap.  I began a little while ago\nto want the garden quite badly.  Yes--and I've seen it three times.\"\n\n\"The garden?\"\n\n\"No--the door!  And I haven't gone in!\"\n\nHe leaned over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his\nvoice as he spoke.  \"Thrice I have had my chance--_thrice!_  If ever\nthat door offers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in out of\nthis dust and heat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these\ntoilsome futilities.  I will go and never return.  This time I will\nstay . . . . .  I swore it and when the time came--_I didn't go_.\n\n\"Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to\nenter.  Three times in the last year.\n\n\"The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the\nTenants' Redemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a\nmajority of three.  You remember?  No one on our side--perhaps very\nfew on the opposite side--expected the end that night.  Then the\ndebate collapsed like eggshells.  I and Hotchkiss were dining with\nhis cousin at Brentford, we were both unpaired, and we were called\nup by telephone, and set off at once in his cousin's motor.  We got\nin barely in time, and on the way we passed my wall and door--livid\nin the moonlight, blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our\nlamps lit it, but unmistakable.  'My God!' cried I.  'What?' said\nHotchkiss.  'Nothing!' I answered, and the moment passed.\n\n\"'I've made a great sacrifice,' I told the whip as I got in.\n'They all have,' he said, and hurried by.\n\n\"I do not see how I could have done otherwise then.  And the\nnext occasion was as I rushed to my father's bedside to bid that\nstern old man farewell.  Then, too, the claims of life were\nimperative.  But the third time was different; it happened a week\nago.  It fills me with hot remorse to recall it.  I was with Gurker\nand Ralphs--it's no secret now you know that I've had my talk with\nGurker.  We had been dining at Frobisher's, and the talk had become\nintimate between us.  The question of my place in the reconstructed\nministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion.\nYes--yes.  That's all settled.  It needn't be talked about yet, but\nthere's no reason to keep a secret from you . . . . .  Yes--thanks!\nthanks!  But let me tell you my story.\n\n\"Then, on that night things were very much in the air.  My\nposition was a very delicate one.  I was keenly anxious to get some\ndefinite word from Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs' presence.\nI was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and\ncareless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerns\nme.  I had to.  Ralphs' behaviour since has more than justified my\ncaution . . . . .  Ralphs, I knew, would leave us beyond the\nKensington High Street, and then I could surprise Gurker by a\nsudden frankness.  One has sometimes to resort to these little\ndevices. . . . .  And then it was that in the margin of my field of\nvision I became aware once more of the white wall, the green door\nbefore us down the road.\n\n\"We passed it talking.  I passed it.  I can still see the\nshadow of Gurker's marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward\nover his prominent nose, the many folds of his neck wrap going\nbefore my shadow and Ralphs' as we sauntered past.\n\n\"I passed within twenty inches of the door.  'If I say\ngood-night to them, and go in,' I asked myself, 'what will happen?'\nAnd I was all a-tingle for that word with Gurker.\n\n\"I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other\nproblems.  'They will think me mad,' I thought.  'And suppose I\nvanish now!--Amazing disappearance of a prominent politician!'\nThat weighed with me.  A thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses\nweighed with me in that crisis.\"\n\nThen he turned on me with a sorrowful smile, and, speaking\nslowly; \"Here I am!\" he said.\n\n\"Here I am!\" he repeated, \"and my chance has gone from me.\nThree times in one year the door has been offered me--the door that\ngoes into peace, into delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a\nkindness no man on earth can know.  And I have rejected it,\nRedmond, and it has gone--\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I know.  I know.  I am left now to work it out, to stick to\nthe tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came.  You say,\nI have success--this vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing.  I have\nit.\"  He had a walnut in his big hand.  \"If that was my success,\"\nhe said, and crushed it, and held it out for me to see.\n\n\"Let me tell you something, Redmond.  This loss is destroying\nme.  For two months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work\nat all, except the most necessary and urgent duties.  My soul is\nfull of inappeasable regrets.  At nights--when it is less likely I\nshall be recognised--I go out.  I wander.  Yes.  I wonder what\npeople would think of that if they knew.  A Cabinet Minister, the\nresponsible head of that most vital of all departments, wandering\nalone--grieving--sometimes near audibly lamenting--for a door, for\na garden!\"\n\n\nIV\n\n\nI can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar\nsombre fire that had come into his eyes.  I see him very vividly\nto-night.  I sit recalling his words, his tones, and last evening's\n_Westminster Gazette_ still lies on my sofa, containing the\nnotice of his death.  At lunch to-day the club was busy with him\nand the strange riddle of his fate.\n\nThey found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep\nexcavation near East Kensington Station.  It is one of two shafts\nthat have been made in connection with an extension of the railway\nsouthward.  It is protected from the intrusion of the public by a\nhoarding upon the high road, in which a small doorway has been\ncut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in\nthat direction.  The doorway was left unfastened through a\nmisunderstanding between two gangers, and through it he made his\nway . . . . .\n\nMy mind is darkened with questions and riddles.\n\nIt would seem he walked all the way from the House that\nnight--he has frequently walked home during the past Session--and\nso it is I figure his dark form coming along the late and empty\nstreets, wrapped up, intent.  And then did the pale electric lights\nnear the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of\nwhite?  Did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory?\n\nWas there, after all, ever any green door in the wall at all?\n\nI do not know.  I have told his story as he told it to me.\nThere are times when I believe that Wallace was no more than the\nvictim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type\nof hallucination and a careless trap, but that indeed is not my\nprofoundest belief.  You may think me superstitious if you will,\nand foolish; but, indeed, I am more than half convinced that he had\nin truth, an abnormal gift, and a sense, something--I know not\nwhat--that in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet, a\nsecret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether\nmore beautiful world.  At any rate, you will say, it betrayed him\nin the end.  But did it betray him?  There you touch the inmost\nmystery of these dreamers, these men of vision and the imagination.\nWe see our world fair and common, the hoarding and the pit.  By our\ndaylight standard he walked out of security into darkness, danger\nand death.  But did he see like that?\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAR\n\nIt was on the first day of the New Year that the announcement\nwas made, almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the\nmotion of the planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets\nthat wheel about the sun, had become very erratic.  Ogilvy had\nalready called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity\nin December.  Such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to\ninterest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were\nunaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor outside the\nastronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint\nremote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause\nany very great excitement.  Scientific people, however, found the\nintelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that\nthe new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its\nmotion was quite different from the orderly progress of the\nplanets, and that the deflection of Neptune and its satellite was\nbecoming now of an unprecedented kind.\n\nFew people without a training in science can realise the huge\nisolation of the solar system.  The sun with its specks of planets,\nits dust of planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a\nvacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination.  Beyond the\norbit of Neptune there is space, vacant so far as human observation\nhas penetrated, without warmth or light or sound, blank emptiness,\nfor twenty million times a million miles.  That is the smallest\nestimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of\nthe stars is attained.  And, saving a few comets more unsubstantial\nthan the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to human knowledge\ncrossed this gulf of space, until early in the twentieth century\nthis strange wanderer appeared.  A vast mass of matter it was,\nbulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of\nthe sky into the radiance of the sun.  By the second day it was\nclearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely\nsensible diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus.  In a\nlittle while an opera glass could attain it.\n\nOn the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two\nhemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real\nimportance of this unusual apparition in the heavens.  \"A Planetary\nCollision,\" one London paper headed the news, and proclaimed\nDuchaine's opinion that this strange new planet would probably\ncollide with Neptune.  The leader writers enlarged upon the topic;\nso that in most of the capitals of the world, on January 3rd, there\nwas an expectation, however vague of some imminent phenomenon in\nthe sky; and as the night followed the sunset round the globe,\nthousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see--the old familiar\nstars just as they had always been.\n\nUntil it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars\noverhead grown pale.  The Winter's dawn it was, a sickly filtering\naccumulation of daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone\nyellow in the windows to show where people were astir.  But the\nyawning policeman saw the thing, the busy crowds in the markets\nstopped agape, workmen going to their work betimes, milkmen, the\ndrivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded and pale,\nhomeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and in the country,\nlabourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the\ndusky quickening country it could be seen--and out at sea by seamen\nwatching for the day--a great white star, come suddenly into the\nwestward sky!\n\nBrighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the\nevening star at its brightest.  It still glowed out white and\nlarge, no mere twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear\nshining disc, an hour after the day had come.  And where science\nhas not reached, men stared and feared, telling one another of the\nwars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in\nthe Heavens.  Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold Coast Negroes,\nFrenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of the\nsunrise watching the setting of this strange new star.\n\nAnd in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed\nexcitement, rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote\nbodies had rushed together; and a hurrying to and fro, to gather\nphotographic apparatus and spectroscope, and this appliance and\nthat, to record this novel astonishing sight, the destruction of a\nworld.  For it was a world, a sister planet of our earth, far\ngreater than our earth indeed, that had so suddenly flashed into\nflaming death.  Neptune it was, had been struck, fairly and\nsquarely, by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of\nthe concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one\nvast mass of incandescence.  Round the world that day, two hours\nbefore the dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as\nit sank westward and the sun mounted above it.  Everywhere men\nmarvelled at it, but of all those who saw it none could have\nmarvelled more than those sailors, habitual watchers of the stars,\nwho far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now\nrise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and\nsink westward with the passing of the night.\n\nAnd when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of\nwatchers on hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring\neastward for the rising of the great new star.  It rose with a\nwhite glow in front of it, like the glare of a white fire, and\nthose who had seen it come into existence the night before cried\nout at the sight of it.  \"It is larger,\" they cried.  \"It is\nbrighter!\"  And, indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the\nwest was in its apparent size beyond comparison, but scarcely in\nall its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle\nof the strange new star.\n\n\"It is brighter!\" cried the people clustering in the streets.\nBut in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and\npeered at one another.  \"_It is nearer_,\" they said.  \"_Nearer!_\"\n\nAnd voice after voice repeated, \"It is nearer,\" and the\nclicking telegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone\nwires, and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the\ntype.  \"It is nearer.\"  Men writing in offices, struck with a\nstrange realisation, flung down their pens, men talking in a\nthousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in\nthose words, \"It is nearer.\"  It hurried along wakening streets, it\nwas shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages; men who\nhad read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit\ndoorways shouting the news to the passersby.  \"It is nearer.\"\nPretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told jestingly\nbetween the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they did\nnot feel.  \"Nearer!  Indeed.  How curious!  How very, very clever\npeople must be to find out things like that!\"\n\nLonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those\nwords to comfort themselves--looking skyward.  \"It has need to be\nnearer, for the night's as cold as charity.  Don't seem much warmth\nfrom it if it _is_ nearer, all the same.\"\n\n\"What is a new star to me?\" cried the weeping woman kneeling\nbeside her dead.\n\nThe schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled\nit out for himself--with the great white star shining broad and\nbright through the frost-flowers of his window.  \"Centrifugal,\ncentripetal,\" he said, with his chin on his fist.  \"Stop a planet\nin its flight, rob it of its centrifugal force, what then?\nCentripetal has it, and down it falls into the sun!  And this--!\n\n\"Do _we_ come in the way?  I wonder--\"\n\nThe light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with\nthe later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star\nagain.  And it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a\npale yellow ghost of itself, hanging huge in the sunset.  In a\nSouth African City a great man had married, and the streets were\nalight to welcome his return with his bride.  \"Even the skies have\nilluminated,\" said the flatterer.  Under Capricorn, two negro\nlovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits, for love of one\nanother, crouched together in a cane brake where the fire-flies\nhovered.  \"That is our star,\" they whispered, and felt strangely\ncomforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.\n\nThe master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed\nthe papers from him.  His calculations were already finished.  In\na small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that\nhad kept him awake and active for four long nights.  Each day,\nserene, explicit, patient as ever, he had given his lecture to his\nstudents, and then had come back at once to this momentous\ncalculation.  His face was grave, a little drawn and hectic from\nhis drugged activity.  For some time he seemed lost in thought.\nThen he went to the window, and the blind went up with a click.\nHalf way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and\nsteeples of the city, hung the star.\n\nHe looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave\nenemy.  \"You may kill me,\" he said after a silence.  \"But I can\nhold you--and all the universe for that matter--in the grip of this\nlittle brain.  I would not change.  Even now.\"\n\nHe looked at the little phial.  \"There will be no need of\nsleep again,\" he said.  The next day at noon--punctual to the\nminute, he entered his lecture theatre, put his hat on the end of\nthe table as his habit was, and carefully selected a large piece of\nchalk.  It was a joke among his students that he could not lecture\nwithout that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers, and once he\nhad been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply.  He came\nand looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young\nfresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of\nphrasing.  \"Circumstances have arisen--circumstances beyond my\ncontrol,\" he said and paused, \"which will debar me from completing\nthe course I had designed.  It would seem, gentlemen, if I may put\nthe thing clearly and briefly, that--Man has lived in vain.\"\n\nThe students glanced at one another.  Had they heard aright?\nMad?  Raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two\nfaces remained intent upon his calm grey-fringed face.  \"It will be\ninteresting,\" he was saying, \"to devote this morning to an\nexposition, so far as I can make it clear to you, of the\ncalculations that have led me to this conclusion.  Let us assume--\"\n\nHe turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the\nway that was usual to him.  \"What was that about 'lived in vain?'\"\nwhispered one student to another.  \"Listen,\" said the other,\nnodding towards the lecturer.\n\nAnd presently they began to understand.\n\nThat night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion\nhad carried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its\nbrightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it\nrose, and every star was hidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near\nthe zenith, Capella, Aldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the\nBear.  It was very white and beautiful.  In many parts of the world\nthat night a pallid halo encircled it about.  It was perceptibly\nlarger; in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if\nit were nearly a quarter the size of the moon.  The frost was still\non the ground in England, but the world was as brightly lit as if\nit were midsummer moonlight.  One could see to read quite ordinary\nprint by that cold clear light, and in the cities the lamps burnt\nyellow and wan.\n\nAnd everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout\nChristendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country\nside like the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous\ntumult grew to a clangour in the cities.  It was the tolling of the\nbells in a million belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people\nto sleep no more, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches\nand pray.  And overhead, growing larger and brighter as the earth\nrolled on its way and the night passed, rose the dazzling star.\n\nAnd the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the\nshipyards glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit\nand crowded all night long.  And in all the seas about the\ncivilised lands, ships with throbbing engines, and ships with\nbellying sails, crowded with men and living creatures, were\nstanding out to ocean and the north.  For already the warning of\nthe master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world,\nand translated into a hundred tongues.  The new planet and Neptune,\nlocked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster and\nfaster towards the sun.  Already every second this blazing mass\nflew a hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity\nincreased.  As it flew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million\nof miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it.  But near its\ndestined path, as yet only slightly perturbed, spun the mighty\nplanet Jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun.\nEvery moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the\ngreatest of the planets grew stronger.  And the result of that\nattraction?  Inevitably Jupiter would be deflected from its orbit\ninto an elliptical path, and the burning star, swung by his\nattraction wide of its sunward rush, would \"describe a curved path\"\nand perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close to, our\nearth.  \"Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves,\nfloods, and a steady rise in temperature to I know not what\nlimit\"--so prophesied the master mathematician.\n\nAnd overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and\nlivid, blazed the star of the coming doom.\n\nTo many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it\nseemed that it was visibly approaching.  And that night, too, the\nweather changed, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe\nand France and England softened towards a thaw.\n\nBut you must not imagine because I have spoken of people\npraying through the night and people going aboard ships and people\nfleeing toward mountainous country that the whole world was already\nin a terror because of the star.  As a matter of fact, use and wont\nstill ruled the world, and save for the talk of idle moments and\nthe splendour of the night, nine human beings out of ten were still\nbusy at their common occupations.  In all the cities the shops,\nsave one here and there, opened and closed at their proper hours,\nthe doctor and the undertaker plied their trades, the workers\ngathered in the factories, soldiers drilled, scholars studied,\nlovers sought one another, thieves lurked and fled, politicians\nplanned their schemes.  The presses of the newspapers roared\nthrough the night, and many a priest of this church and that would\nnot open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish\npanic.  The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for\nthen, too, people had anticipated the end.  The star was no\nstar--mere gas--a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly\nstrike the earth.  There was no precedent for such a thing.  Common\nsense was sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little inclined\nto persecute the obdurate fearful.  That night, at seven-fifteen by\nGreenwich time, the star would be at its nearest to Jupiter.  Then\nthe world would see the turn things would take.  The master\nmathematician's grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere\nelaborate self-advertisement.  Common sense at last, a little heated\nby argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed.\nSo, too, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went\nabout their nightly business, and save for a howling dog here and\nthere, the beast world left the star unheeded.\n\nAnd yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw\nthe star rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had\nbeen the night before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at\nthe master mathematician--to take the danger as if it had passed.\n\nBut hereafter the laughter ceased.  The star grew--it grew\nwith a terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each\nhour, a little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and\nbrighter, until it had turned night into a second day.  Had it come\nstraight to the earth instead of in a curved path, had it lost no\nvelocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a\nday, but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our\nplanet.  The next night it had become a third the size of the moon\nbefore it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured.  It rose\nover America near the size of the moon, but blinding white to look\nat, and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew now with its\nrising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and Brazil, and\ndown the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently through a\ndriving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning,\nand hail unprecedented.  In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating\nfloods.  And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and\nice began to melt that night, and all the rivers coming out of\nhigh country flowed thick and turbid, and soon--in their upper\nreaches--with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men.\nThey rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly brilliance, and came\ntrickling over their banks at last, behind the flying population\nof their valleys.\n\nAnd along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the\ntides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the\nstorms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland,\ndrowning whole cities.  And so great grew the heat during the night\nthat the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow.  The\nearthquakes began and grew until all down America from the Arctic\nCircle to Cape Horn, hillsides were sliding, fissures were opening,\nand houses and walls crumbling to destruction.  The whole side of\nCotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion, and a tumult of lava\npoured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day\nit reached the sea.\n\nSo the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the\nPacific, trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the\ngrowing tidal wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager,\npoured over island and island and swept them clear of men.  Until\nthat wave came at last--in a blinding light and with the breath of\na furnace, swift and terrible it came--a wall of water, fifty feet\nhigh, roaring hungrily, upon the long coasts of Asia, and swept\ninland across the plains of China.  For a space the star, hotter\nnow and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength, showed\nwith pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country; towns and\nvillages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated\nfields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at\nthe incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of\nthe flood.  And thus it was with millions of men that night--a\nflight nowhither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and\nscant, and the flood like a wall swift and white behind.  And then\ndeath.\n\nChina was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all\nthe islands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red\nfire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were\nspouting forth to salute its coming.  Above was the lava, hot gases\nand ash, and below the seething floods, and the whole earth swayed\nand rumbled with the earthquake shocks.  Soon the immemorial snows\nof Thibet and the Himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten\nmillion deepening converging channels upon the plains of Burmah and\nHindostan.  The tangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame\nin a thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the\nstems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected\nthe blood-red tongues of fire.  And in a rudderless confusion a\nmultitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to that\none last hope of men--the open sea.\n\nLarger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a\nterrible swiftness now.  The tropical ocean had lost its\nphosphorescence, and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths\nfrom the black waves that plunged incessantly, speckled with\nstorm-tossed ships.\n\nAnd then came a wonder.  It seemed to those who in Europe\nwatched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased\nits rotation.  In a thousand open spaces of down and upland the\npeople who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses\nand sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain.  Hour\nfollowed hour through a terrible suspense, and the star rose not.\nOnce again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had\ncounted lost to them forever.  In England it was hot and clear\noverhead, though the ground quivered perpetually, but in the\ntropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil of\nsteam.  And when at last the great star rose near ten hours late,\nthe sun rose close upon it, and in the centre of its white heart\nwas a disc of black.\n\nOver Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the\nmovement of the sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its\nlight had been veiled.  All the plain of India from the mouth of\nthe Indus to the mouths of the Ganges was a shallow waste of\nshining water that night, out of which rose temples and palaces,\nmounds and hills, black with people.  Every minaret was a\nclustering mass of people, who fell one by one into the turbid\nwaters, as heat and terror overcame them.  The whole land seemed\na-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of\ndespair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of clouds, out\nof the cooling air.  Men looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw\nthat a black disc was creeping across the light.  It was the moon,\ncoming between the star and the earth.  And even as men cried to\nGod at this respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable\nswiftness sprang the sun.  And then star, sun and moon rushed\ntogether across the heavens.\n\nSo it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and\nsun rose close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then\nslower, and at last came to rest, star and sun merged into one\nglare of flame at the zenith of the sky.  The moon no longer\neclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the\nsky.  And though those who were still alive regarded it for the\nmost part with that dull stupidity that hunger, fatigue, heat and\ndespair engender, there were still men who could perceive the\nmeaning of these signs.  Star and earth had been at their nearest,\nhad swung about one another, and the star had passed.  Already it\nwas receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its\nheadlong journey downward into the sun.\n\nAnd then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the\nsky, the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all\nover the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before\nseen, and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy\nthere descended torrents of mud.  Everywhere the waters were\npouring off the land, leaving mud-silted ruins, and the earth\nlittered like a storm-worn beach with all that had floated, and the\ndead bodies of the men and brutes, its children.  For days the\nwater streamed off the land, sweeping away soil and trees and\nhouses in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out Titanic\ngullies over the country side.  Those were the days of darkness\nthat followed the star and the heat.  All through them, and for\nmany weeks and months, the earthquakes continued.\n\nBut the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering\ncourage only slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities,\nburied granaries, and sodden fields.  Such few ships as had escaped\nthe storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding\ntheir way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once\nfamiliar ports.  And as the storms subsided men perceived that\neverywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the sun larger,\nand the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now\nfourscore days between its new and new.\n\nBut of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of\nthe saving of laws and books and machines, of the strange change\nthat had come over Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin's\nBay, so that the sailors coming there presently found them green\nand gracious, and could scarce believe their eyes, this story does\nnot tell.  Nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was\nhotter, northward and southward towards the poles of the earth.  It\nconcerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the Star.\n\nThe Martian astronomers--for there are astronomers on Mars,\nalthough they are very different beings from men--were naturally\nprofoundly interested by these things.  They saw them from their\nown standpoint of course.  \"Considering the mass and temperature of\nthe missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun,\"\none wrote, \"it is astonishing what a little damage the earth, which\nit missed so narrowly, has sustained.  All the familiar continental\nmarkings and the masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the\nonly difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration\n(supposed to be frozen water) round either pole.\"  Which only shows\nhow small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem, at a distance\nof a few million miles.\n\n\n\n\nA DREAM OF ARMAGEDDON\n\nThe man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby.  He\nmoved slowly in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while\nhe was still on the platform I noted how ill he seemed.  He dropped\ninto the corner over against me with a sigh, made an incomplete\nattempt to arrange his travelling shawl, and became motionless,\nwith his eyes staring vacantly.  Presently he was moved by a sense\nof my observation, looked up at me, and put out a spiritless hand\nfor his newspaper.  Then he glanced again in my direction.\n\nI feigned to read.  I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed\nhim, and in a moment I was surprised to find him speaking.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said I.\n\n\"That book,\" he repeated, pointing a lean finger, \"is about\ndreams.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" I answered, for it was Fortnum Roscoe's Dream\nStates, and the title was on the cover.\n\nHe hung silent for a space as if he sought words. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid at last, \"but they tell you nothing.\"\n\nI did not catch his meaning for a second.\n\n\"They don't know,\" he added.\n\nI looked a little more attentively at his face.\n\n\"There are dreams,\" he said, \"and dreams.\"\n\nThat sort of proposition I never dispute.\n\n\"I suppose--\" he hesitated. \"Do you ever dream?  I mean\nvividly.\"\n\n\"I dream very little,\" I answered.  \"I doubt if I have three\nvivid dreams in a year.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, and seemed for a moment to collect his\nthoughts.\n\n\"Your dreams don't mix with your memories?\" he asked abruptly.\n\"You don't find yourself in doubt; did this happen or did it not?\"\n\n\"Hardly ever.  Except just for a momentary hesitation now and\nthen.  I suppose few people do.\"\n\n\"Does he say--?\"  He indicated the book.\n\n\"Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation\nabout intensity of impression and the like to account for its not\nhappening as a rule.  I suppose you know something of these\ntheories--\"\n\n\"Very little--except that they are wrong.\"\n\nHis emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a\ntime.  I prepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate\nhis next remark.  He leant forward almost as though he would touch\nme.\n\n\"Isn't there something called consecutive dreaming--that goes\non night after night?\"\n\n\"I believe there is.  There are cases given in most books on\nmental trouble.\"\n\n\"Mental trouble!  Yes.  I daresay there are.  It's the right\nplace for them.  But what I mean--\"  He looked at his bony\nknuckles.  \"Is that sort of thing always dreaming?  Is it dreaming?\nOr is it something else?  Mightn't it be something else?\"\n\nI should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the\ndrawn anxiety of his face.  I remember now the look of his faded\neyes and the lids red stained--perhaps you know that look.\n\n\"I'm not just arguing about a matter of opinion,\" he said.\n\"The thing's killing me.\"\n\n\"Dreams?\"\n\n\"If you call them dreams.  Night after night.  Vivid!--so\nvivid . . . . this--\" (he indicated the landscape that went\nstreaming by the window) \"seems unreal in comparison!  I can\nscarcely remember who I am, what business I am on . . . .\"\n\nHe paused.  \"Even now--\"\n\n\"The dream is always the same--do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's over.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"I died.\"\n\n\"Died?\"\n\n\"Smashed and killed, and now, so much of me as that dream was,\nis dead.  Dead forever.  I dreamt I was another man, you know,\nliving in a different part of the world and in a different time.\nI dreamt that night after night.  Night after night I woke into\nthat other life.  Fresh scenes and fresh happenings--until I came\nupon the last--\"\n\n\"When you died?\"\n\n\"When I died.\"\n\n\"And since then--\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"Thank God!  That was the end of the dream . . .\"\n\nIt was clear I was in for this dream.  And after all, I had an\nhour before me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum Roscoe has\na dreary way with him.  \"Living in a different time,\" I said: \"do\nyou mean in some different age?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Past?\"\n\n\"No, to come--to come.\"\n\n\"The year three thousand, for example?\"\n\n\"I don't know what year it was.  I did when I was asleep, when\nI was dreaming, that is, but not now--not now that I am awake.\nThere's a lot of things I have forgotten since I woke out of these\ndreams, though I knew them at the time when I was--I suppose it was\ndreaming.  They called the year differently from our way of calling\nthe year . . . What did they call it?\"  He put his hand to his\nforehead.  \"No,\" said he, \"I forget.\"\n\nHe sat smiling weakly.  For a moment I feared he did not mean\nto tell me his dream.  As a rule I hate people who tell their\ndreams, but this struck me differently.  I proffered assistance\neven.  \"It began--\" I suggested.\n\n\"It was vivid from the first.  I seemed to wake up in it\nsuddenly.  And it's curious that in these dreams I am speaking of\nI never remembered this life I am living now.  It seemed as if the\ndream life was enough while it lasted.  Perhaps--But I will tell\nyou how I find myself when I do my best to recall it all.  I don't\nremember anything clearly until I found myself sitting in a sort of\nloggia looking out over the sea.  I had been dozing, and suddenly\nI woke up--fresh and vivid--not a bit dreamlike--because the girl\nhad stopped fanning me.\"\n\n\"The girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, the girl.  You must not interrupt or you will put me\nout.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly.  \"You won't think I'm mad?\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" I answered.  \"You've been dreaming.  Tell me your\ndream.\"\n\n\"I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me.\nI was not surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort,\nyou understand.  I did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly.  I\nsimply took it up at that point.  Whatever memory I had of this\nlife, this nineteenth-century life, faded as I woke, vanished like\na dream.  I knew all about myself, knew that my name was no longer\nCooper but Hedon, and all about my position in the world.  I've\nforgotten a lot since I woke--there's a want of connection--but it\nwas all quite clear and matter of fact then.\"\n\nHe hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his\nface forward and looking up to me appealingly.\n\n\"This seems bosh to you?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I cried.  \"Go on.  Tell me what this loggia was\nlike!\"\n\n\"It was not really a loggia--I don't know what to call it.  It\nfaced south.  It was small.  It was all in shadow except the\nsemicircle above the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the\ncorner where the girl stood.  I was on a couch--it was a metal\ncouch with light striped cushions--and the girl was leaning over\nthe balcony with her back to me.  The light of the sunrise fell on\nher ear and cheek.  Her pretty white neck and the little curls\nthat nestled there, and her white shoulder were in the sun, and\nall the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow.  She was\ndressed--how can I describe it?  It was easy and flowing.  And\naltogether there she stood, so that it came to me how beautiful\nand desirable she was, as though I had never seen her before.\nAnd when at last I sighed and raised myself upon my arm she\nturned her face to me--\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world.  I have had\nmother, sisters, friends, wife and daughters--all their faces, the\nplay of their faces, I know.  But the face of this girl--it is much\nmore real to me.  I can bring it back into memory so that I see it\nagain--I could draw it or paint it.  And after all--\"\n\nHe stopped--but I said nothing.\n\n\"The face of a dream--the face of a dream.  She was beautiful.\nNot that beauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the\nbeauty of a saint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but\na sort of radiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and\ngrave gray eyes.  And she moved gracefully, she seemed to have part\nwith all pleasant and gracious things--\"\n\nHe stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden.  Then he\nlooked up at me and went on, making no further attempt to disguise\nhis absolute belief in the reality of his story.\n\n\"You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up\nall I had ever worked for or desired for her sake.  I had been a\nmaster man away there in the north, with influence and property and\na great reputation, but none of it had seemed worth having beside\nher.  I had come to the place, this city of sunny pleasures with\nher, and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save a\nremnant at least of my life.  While I had been in love with her\nbefore I knew that she had any care for me, before I had imagined\nthat she would dare--that we should dare, all my life had seemed\nvain and hollow, dust and ashes.  It was dust and ashes.  Night\nafter night and through the long days I had longed and desired--my\nsoul had beaten against the thing forbidden!\n\n\"But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these\nthings.  It's emotion, it's a tint, a light that comes and goes.\nOnly while it's there, everything changes, everything.  The thing\nis I came away and left them in their Crisis to do what they\ncould.\"\n\n\"Left whom?\" I asked, puzzled.\n\n\"The people up in the north there.  You see--in this dream,\nanyhow--I had been a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in,\nto group themselves about.  Millions of men who had never seen me\nwere ready to do things and risk things because of their confidence\nin me.  I had been playing that game for years, that big laborious\ngame, that vague, monstrous political game amidst intrigues and\nbetrayals, speech and agitation.  It was a vast weltering world,\nand at last I had a sort of leadership against the Gang--you know\nit was called the Gang--a sort of compromise of scoundrelly\nprojects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities\nand catch-words--the Gang that kept the world noisy and blind year\nby year, and all the while that it was drifting, drifting towards\ninfinite disaster.  But I can't expect you to understand the shades\nand complications of the year--the year something or other ahead.\nI had it all--down to the smallest details--in my dream.  I suppose\nI had been dreaming of it before I awoke, and the fading outline of\nsome queer new development I had imagined still hung about me as I\nrubbed my eyes.  It was some grubby affair that made me thank God\nfor the sunlight.  I sat up on the couch and remained looking at\nthe woman and rejoicing--rejoicing that I had come away out of all\nthat tumult and folly and violence before it was too late.  After\nall, I thought, this is life--love and beauty, desire and delight,\nare they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic\nends?  And I blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader\nwhen I might have given my days to love.  But then, thought I, if\nI had not spent my early days sternly and austerely, I might have\nwasted myself upon vain and worthless women, and at the thought all\nmy being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress, my\ndear lady, who had come at last and compelled me--compelled me by\nher invincible charm for me--to lay that life aside.\n\n\"'You are worth it,' I said, speaking without intending her to\nhear; 'you are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and\nall things.  Love! to have you is worth them all together.\"  And at\nthe murmur of my voice she turned about.\n\n\"'Come and see,' she cried--I can hear her now--'come and see\nthe sunrise upon Monte Solaro.'\n\n\"I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the\nbalcony.  She put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards\ngreat masses of limestone, flushing, as it were, into life.  I\nlooked.  But first I noted the sunlight on her face caressing the\nlines of her cheeks and neck.  How can I describe to you the scene\nwe had before us?  We were at Capri--\"\n\n\"I have been there,\" I said.  \"I have clambered up Monte\nSolaro and drunk vero Capri--muddy stuff like cider--at the\nsummit.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the man with the white face; \"then perhaps you can\ntell me--you will know if this is indeed Capri.  For in this life\nI have never been there.  Let me describe it.  We were in a little\nroom, one of a vast multitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny,\nhollowed out of the limestone of a sort of cape, very high above\nthe sea.  The whole island, you know, was one enormous hotel,\ncomplex beyond explaining, and on the other side there were miles\nof floating hotels, and huge floating stages to which the flying\nmachines came.  They called it a pleasure city.  Of course, there\nwas none of that in your time--rather, I should say, is none of\nthat now.  Of course.  Now!--yes.\n\n\"Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so\nthat one could see east and west.  Eastward was a great cliff--a\nthousand feet high perhaps--coldly gray except for one bright edge\nof gold, and beyond it the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast\nthat faded and passed into the hot sunrise.  And when one turned to\nthe west, distinct and near was a little bay, a little beach still\nin shadow.  And out of that shadow rose Solaro straight and tall,\nflushed and golden crested, like a beauty throned, and the white\nmoon was floating behind her in the sky.  And before us from east\nto west stretched the many-tinted sea all dotted with little\nsailing boats.\n\n\"To the eastward, of course, these little boats were gray and\nvery minute and clear, but to the westward they were little boats\nof gold--shining gold--almost like little flames.  And just below\nus was a rock with an arch worn through it.  The blue sea-water\nbroke to green and foam all round the rock, and a galley came\ngliding out of the arch.\"\n\n\"I know that rock.\"  I said.  \"I was nearly drowned there.  It\nis called the Faraglioni.\"\n\n\"I Faraglioni?  Yes, she called it that,\" answered the man\nwith the white face.  \"There was some story--but that--\"\n\nHe put his hand to his forehead again.  \"No,\" he said, \"I\nforget that story.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I\nhad, that little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that\ndear lady of mine, with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and\nhow we sat and talked in half whispers to one another.  We talked\nin whispers not because there was any one to hear, but because\nthere was still such a freshness of mind between us that our\nthoughts were a little frightened, I think, to find themselves at\nlast in words.  And so they went softly.\n\n\"Presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment,\ngoing by a strange passage with a moving floor, until we came to\nthe great breakfast room--there was a fountain and music.  A\npleasant and joyful place it was, with its sunlight and splashing,\nand the murmur of plucked strings.  And we sat and ate and smiled\nat one another, and I would not heed a man who was watching me from\na table near by.\n\n\"And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall.  But I cannot\ndescribe that hall.  The place was enormous--larger than any\nbuilding you have ever seen--and in one place there was the old\ngate of Capri, caught into the wall of a gallery high overhead.\nLight girders, stems and threads of gold, burst from the pillars\nlike fountains, streamed like an Aurora across the roof and\ninterlaced, like--like conjuring tricks.  All about the great\ncircle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange\ndragons, and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights.\nThe place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the\nnewborn day.  And as we went through the throng the people turned\nabout and looked at us, for all through the world my name and face\nwere known, and how I had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to\ncome to this place.  And they looked also at the lady beside me,\nthough half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown\nor mistold.  And few of the men who were there, I know, but judged\nme a happy man, in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had\ncome upon my name.\n\n\"The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of\nthe rhythm of beautiful motions.  Thousands of beautiful people\nswarmed about the hall, crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad\nrecesses; they were dressed in splendid colours and crowned with\nflowers; thousands danced about the great circle beneath the white\nimages of the ancient gods, and glorious processions of youths and\nmaidens came and went.  We two danced, not the dreary monotonies of\nyour days--of this time, I mean--but dances that were beautiful,\nintoxicating.  And even now I can see my lady dancing--dancing\njoyously.  She danced, you know, with a serious face; she danced\nwith a serious dignity, and yet she was smiling at me and caressing\nme--smiling and caressing with her eyes.\n\n\"The music was different,\" he murmured.  \"It went--I cannot\ndescribe it; but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any\nmusic that has ever come to me awake.\n\n\"And then--it was when we had done dancing--a man came to\nspeak to me.  He was a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for\nthat place, and already I had marked his face watching me in the\nbreakfasting hall, and afterwards as we went along the passage I\nhad avoided his eye.  But now, as we sat in a little alcove,\nsmiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and fro\nacross the shining floor, he came and touched me, and spoke to me\nso that I was forced to listen.  And he asked that he might speak\nto me for a little time apart.\n\n\"'No,' I said.  'I have no secrets from this lady.  What do\nyou want to tell me?'\n\n\"He said it was a trivial matter, or at least a dry matter,\nfor a lady to hear.\n\n\"'Perhaps for me to hear,' said I.\n\n\"He glanced at her, as though almost he would appeal to her.\nThen he asked me suddenly if I had heard of a great and avenging\ndeclaration that Evesham had made?  Now, Evesham had always before\nbeen the man next to myself in the leadership of that great party\nin the north.  He was a forcible, hard, and tactless man, and only\nI had been able to control and soften him.  It was on his account\neven more than my own, I think, that the others had been so\ndismayed at my retreat.  So this question about what he had done\nreawakened my old interest in the life I had put aside just for\na moment.\n\n\"'I have taken no heed of any news for many days,' I said.\n'What has Evesham been saying?'\n\n\"And with that the man began, nothing loth, and I must confess\neven I was struck by Evesham's reckless folly in the wild and\nthreatening words he had used.  And this messenger they had sent to\nme not only told me of Evesham's speech, but went on to ask counsel\nand to point out what need they had of me.  While he talked, my\nlady sat a little forward and watched his face and mine.\n\n\"My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted\nthemselves.  I could even see myself suddenly returning to the\nnorth, and all the dramatic effect of it.  All that this man said\nwitnessed to the disorder of the party indeed, but not to its\ndamage.  I should go back stronger than I had come.  And then I\nthought of my lady.  You see--how can I tell you?  There were\ncertain peculiarities of our relationship--as things are I need not\ntell you about that--which would render her presence with me\nimpossible.  I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have\nhad to renounce her clearly and openly, if I was to do all that I\ncould do in the north.  And the man knew that, even as he talked to\nher and me, knew it as well as she did, that my steps to duty\nwere--first, separation, then abandonment.  At the touch of that\nthought my dream of a return was shattered.  I turned on the man\nsuddenly, as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with\nme.\n\n\"'What have I to do with these things now?' I said.  'I have\ndone with them.  Do you think I am coquetting with your people in\ncoming here?'\n\n\"'No,' he said.  'But--'\n\n\"'Why  cannot you leave me alone.  I have done with these\nthings.  I have ceased to be anything but a private man.'\n\n\"'Yes,' he answered.  'But have you thought?--this talk of\nwar, these reckless challenges, these wild aggressions--'\n\n\"I stood up.\n\n\"'No,' I cried.  'I won't hear you.  I took count of all those\nthings, I weighed them--and I have come away.'\n\n\"He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence.  He\nlooked from me to where the lady sat regarding us.\n\n\"'War,' he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then\nturned slowly from me and walked away.\n\n\"I stood, caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set\ngoing.\n\n\"I heard my lady's voice.\n\n\"'Dear,' she said; 'but if they had need of you--'\n\n\"She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there.  I\nturned to her sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and\nreeled.\n\n\"'They want me only to do the thing they dare not do\nthemselves,' I said.  'If they distrust Evesham they must settle\nwith him themselves.'\n\n\"She looked at me doubtfully.\n\n\"'But war--' she said.\n\n\"I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of\nherself and me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen\nstrongly and completely, must drive us apart for ever.\n\n\"Now, I was an older mind than hers, and I could sway her to\nthis belief or that.\n\n\"'My dear one,' I said, 'you must not trouble over these\nthings.  There will be no war.  Certainly there will be no war.\nThe age of wars is past.  Trust me to know the justice of this\ncase.  They have no right upon me, dearest, and no one has a right\nupon me.  I have been free to choose my life, and I have chosen\nthis.'\n\n\"'But war--,' she said.\n\n\"I sat down beside her.  I put an arm behind her and took her\nhand in mine.  I set myself to drive that doubt away--I set myself\nto fill her mind with pleasant things again.  I lied to her, and in\nlying to her I lied also to myself.  And she was only too ready to\nbelieve me, only too ready to forget.\n\n\"Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to\nour bathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our\ncustom to bathe every day.  We swam and splashed one another, and\nin that buoyant water I seemed to become something lighter and\nstronger than a man.  And at last we came out dripping and\nrejoicing and raced among the rocks.  And then I put on a dry\nbathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun, and presently I\nnodded, resting my head against her knee, and she put her hand upon\nmy hair and stroked it softly and I dozed.  And behold! as it\nwere with the snapping of the string of a violin, I was awakening,\nand I was in my own bed in Liverpool, in the life of to-day.\n\n\"Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid\nmoments had been no more than the substance of a dream.\n\n\"In truth, I could not believe it a dream for all the sobering\nreality of things about me.  I bathed and dressed as it were by\nhabit, and as I shaved I argued why I of all men should leave the\nwoman I loved to go back to fantastic politics in the hard and\nstrenuous north.  Even if Evesham did force the world back to war,\nwhat was that to me?  I was a man with the heart of a man, and why\nshould I feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the world\nmight go?\n\n\"You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs,\nabout my real affairs.  I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of\nview.\n\n\"The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly\nunlike a dream that I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant\ndetails; even the ornament of the book-cover that lay on my wife's\nsewing-machine in the breakfast-room recalled with the utmost\nvividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where\nI had talked with the messenger from my deserted party.  Have you\never heard of a dream that had a quality like that?\"\n\n\"Like--?\"\n\n\"So that afterwards you remembered little details you had\nforgotten.\"\n\nI thought.  I had never noticed the point before, but he was\nright.\n\n\"Never,\" I said.  \"That is what you never seem to do with\ndreams.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered.  \"But that is just what I did.  I am a solicitor,\nyou must understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering\nwhat the clients and business people I found myself talking to in my\noffice would think if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl\nwho would be born a couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried\nabout the politics of my great-great-great-grandchildren.  I was\nchiefly busy that day negotiating a ninety-nine-year building lease.\nIt was a private builder in a hurry, and we wanted to tie him in\nevery possible way.  I had an interview with him, and he showed a\ncertain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated.  That\nnight I had no dream.  Nor did I dream the next night, at least,\nto remember.\n\n\"Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished.  I\nbegan to feel sure it was a dream.  And then it came again.\n\n\"When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was\nvery different.  I think it certain that four days had also elapsed\nin the dream.  Many things had happened in the north, and the\nshadow of them was back again between us, and this time it was not\nso easily dispelled.  I began I know with moody musings.  Why, in\nspite of all, should I go back, go back for all the rest of my days\nto toil and stress, insults and perpetual dissatisfaction, simply\nto save hundreds of millions of common people, whom I did not love,\nwhom too often I could do no other than despise, from the stress\nand anguish of war and infinite misrule?  And after all I might\nfail.  They all sought their own narrow ends, and why should not\nI--why should not I also live as a man?  And out of such thoughts\nher voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes.\n\n\"I found myself awake and walking.  We had come out above the\nPleasure City, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking\ntowards the bay.  It was the late afternoon and very clear.  Far\naway to the left Ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky,\nand Naples was coldly white against the hills, and before us was\nVesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last\ntowards the south, and the ruins of Torre dell' Annunziata and\nCastellammare glittering and near.\"\n\nI interrupted suddenly: \"You have been to Capri, of course?\"\n\n\"Only in this dream,\" he said, \"only in this dream.  All\nacross the bay beyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the\nPleasure City moored and chained.  And northward were the broad\nfloating stages that received the aeroplanes.  Aeroplanes fell out\nof the sky every afternoon, each bringing its thousands of\npleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to Capri and\nits delights.  All these things, I say, stretched below.\n\n\"But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual\nsight that evening had to show.  Five war aeroplanes that had long\nslumbered useless in the distant arsenals of the Rhinemouth were\nmanoeuvring now in the eastward sky.  Evesham had astonished the\nworld by producing them and others, and sending them to circle here\nand there.  It was the threat material in the great game of bluff\nhe was playing, and it had taken even me by surprise.  He was one\nof those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven\nto create disasters.  His energy to the first glance seemed so\nwonderfully like capacity!  But he had no imagination, no\ninvention, only a stupid, vast, driving force of will, and a mad\nfaith in his stupid idiot 'luck' to pull him through.  I remember\nhow we stood upon the headland watching the squadron circling far\naway, and how I weighed the full meaning of the sight, seeing\nclearly the way things must go.  And then even it was not too late.\nI might have gone back, I think, and saved the world.  The people\nof the north would follow me, I knew, granted only that in one\nthing I respected their moral standards.  The east and south would\ntrust me as they would trust no other northern man.  And I knew\nI had only to put it to her and she would have let me go . . . .\nNot because she did not love me!\n\n\"Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way\nabout.  I had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I\nwas still so fresh a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness\nof what I ought to do had no power at all to touch my will.  My\nwill was to live, to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy.\nBut though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw\nme, it could make me silent and preoccupied, it robbed the days I\nhad spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark\nmeditations in the silence of the night.  And as I stood and\nwatched Evesham's aeroplanes sweep to and fro--those birds of\ninfinite ill omen--she stood beside me watching me, perceiving the\ntrouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly--her eyes questioning\nmy face, her expression shaded with perplexity.  Her face was gray\nbecause the sunset was fading out of the sky.  It was no fault of\nhers that she held me.  She had asked me to go from her, and again\nin the night time and with tears she had asked me to go.\n\n\"At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood.\nI turned upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the\nmountain slopes.  'No,' she said, as if I had jarred with her\ngravity, but I was resolved to end that gravity, and make her\nrun--no one can be very gray and sad who is out of breath--and when\nshe stumbled I ran with my hand beneath her arm.  We ran down past\na couple of men, who turned back staring in astonishment at my\nbehaviour--they must have recognised my face.  And half way down\nthe slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank, clang-clank, and\nwe stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those war things came\nflying one behind the other.\"\n\nThe man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description.\n\n\"What were they like?\" I asked.\n\n\"They had never fought,\" he said.  \"They were just like our\nironclads are nowadays; they had never fought.  No one knew what\nthey might do, with excited men inside them; few even cared to\nspeculate.  They were great driving things shaped like spear-heads\nwithout a shaft, with a propeller in the place of the shaft.\"\n\n\"Steel?\"\n\n\"Not steel.\"\n\n\"Aluminum?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing of that sort.  An alloy that was very\ncommon--as common as brass, for example.  It was called--let me\nsee--\"  He squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand.  \"I\nam forgetting everything,\" he said.\n\n\"And they carried guns?\"\n\n\"Little guns, firing high explosive shells.  They fired the\nguns backwards, out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and\nrammed with the beak.  That was the theory, you know, but they had\nnever been fought.  No one could tell exactly what was going to\nhappen.  And meanwhile I suppose it was very fine to go whirling\nthrough the air like a flight of young swallows, swift and easy.\nI guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real\nthing would be like.  And these flying war machines, you know, were\nonly one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been\ninvented and had fallen into abeyance during the long peace.  There\nwere all sorts of these things that people were routing out and\nfurbishing up; infernal things, silly things; things that had never\nbeen tried; big engines, terrible explosives, great guns.  You know\nthe silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things;\nthey turn 'em out as beavers build dams, and with no more sense of\nthe rivers they're going to divert and the lands they're going to\nflood!\n\n\"As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again, in\nthe twilight, I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably\nthings were driving for war in Evesham's silly, violent hands, and\nI had some inkling of what war was bound to be under these new\nconditions.  And even then, though I knew it was drawing near the\nlimit of my opportunity, I could find no will to go back.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"That was my last chance.\n\n\"We didn't go into the city until the sky was full of stars,\nso we walked out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and--she\ncounselled me to go back.\n\n\"'My dearest,' she said, and her sweet face looked up to me,\n'this is Death.  This life you lead is Death.  Go back to them, go\nback to your duty--'\n\n\"She began to weep, saying, between her sobs, and clinging to\nmy arm as she said it, 'Go back--Go back.'\n\n\"Then suddenly she fell mute, and, glancing down at her face,\nI read in an instant the thing she had thought to do.  It was one\nof those moments when one sees.\n\n\"'No!' I said.\n\n\"'No?' she asked, in surprise and I think a little fearful at\nthe answer to her thought.\n\n\"'Nothing,' I said, 'shall send me back.  Nothing!  I have\nchosen.  Love, I have chosen, and the world must go.  Whatever\nhappens I will live this life--I will live for you!  It--nothing\nshall turn me aside; nothing, my dear one.  Even if you died--even\nif you died--'\n\n\"'Yes?' she murmured, softly.\n\n\"'Then--I also would die.'\n\n\"And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking\neloquently--as I could do in that life--talking to exalt love, to\nmake the life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the\nthing I was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it\nwas a fine thing to set aside.  I bent all my mind to throw that\nglamour upon it, seeking not only to convert her but myself to\nthat.  We talked, and she clung to me, torn too between all that\nshe deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet.  And at last I\ndid make it heroic, made all the thickening disaster of the world\nonly a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love, and we\ntwo poor foolish souls strutted there at last, clad in that\nsplendid delusion, drunken rather with that glorious delusion,\nunder the still stars.\n\n\"And so my moment passed.\n\n\"It was my last chance.  Even as we went to and fro there, the\nleaders of the south and east were gathering their resolve, and the\nhot answer that shattered Evesham's bluffing for ever, took shape and\nwaited.  And, all over Asia, and the ocean, and the South, the air\nand the wires were throbbing with their warnings to prepare--prepare.\n\n\"No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could\nimagine, with all these new inventions, what horror war might\nbring.  I believe most people still believed it would be a matter\nof bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and\nbands--in a time when half the world drew its food supply from\nregions ten thousand miles away--\"\n\nThe man with the white face paused.  I glanced at him, and his\nface was intent on the floor of the carriage.  A little railway\nstation, a string of loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of\na cottage, shot by the carriage window, and a bridge passed with a\nclap of noise, echoing the tumult of the train.\n\n\"After that,\" he said, \"I dreamt often.  For three weeks of\nnights that dream was my life.  And the worst of it was there were\nnights when I could not dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in this\naccursed life; and there--somewhere lost to me--things were\nhappening--momentous, terrible things . . . I lived at nights--my\ndays, my waking days, this life I am living now, became a faded,\nfar-away dream, a drab setting, the cover of the book.\"\n\nHe thought.\n\n\"I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the\ndream, but as to what I did in the daytime--no.  I could not\ntell--I do not remember.  My memory--my memory has gone.  The\nbusiness of life slips from me--\"\n\nHe leant forward, and pressed his hands upon his eyes.  For a\nlong time he said nothing.\n\n\"And then?\" said I.\n\n\"The war burst like a hurricane.\"\n\nHe stared before him at unspeakable things.\n\n\"And then?\" I urged again.\n\n\"One touch of unreality,\" he said, in the low tone of a man\nwho speaks to himself, \"and they would have been nightmares.\nBut they were not nightmares--they were not nightmares.  No!\"\n\nHe was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there\nwas a danger of losing the rest of the story.  But he went on\ntalking again in the same tone of questioning self-communion.\n\n\"What was there to do but flight?  I had not thought the war\nwould touch Capri--I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it\nall, as the contrast to it all; but two nights after the whole\nplace was shouting and bawling, every woman almost and every other\nman wore a badge--Evesham's badge--and there was no music but a\njangling war-song over and over again, and everywhere men\nenlisting, and in the dancing halls they were drilling.  The whole\nisland was awhirl with rumours; it was said, again and again, that\nfighting had begun.  I had not expected this.  I had seen so little\nof the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this\nviolence of the amateurs.  And as for me, I was out of it.  I was\nlike the man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine.\nThe time had gone.  I was no one; the vainest stripling with a\nbadge counted for more than I.  The crowd jostled us and bawled in\nour ears; that accursed song deafened us; a woman shrieked at my\nlady because no badge was on her, and we two went back to our own\nplace again, ruffled and insulted--my lady white and silent, and I\naquiver with rage.  So furious was I, I could have quarrelled with\nher if I could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes.\n\n\"All my magnificence had gone from me.  I walked up and down\nour rock cell, and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the\nsouthward that flared and passed and came again.\n\n\"'We must get out of this place,' I said over and over.  'I\nhave made my choice, and I will have no hand in these troubles.  I\nwill have nothing of this war.  We have taken our lives out of all\nthese things.  This is no refuge for us.  Let us go.'\n\n\"And the next day we were already in flight from the war that\ncovered the world.\n\n\"And all the rest was Flight--all the rest was Flight.\"\n\nHe mused darkly.\n\n\"How much was there of it?\"\n\nHe made no answer.\n\n\"How many days?\"\n\nHis face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched.  He\ntook no heed of my curiosity.\n\nI tried to draw him back to his story with questions.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" I said.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When you left Capri.\"\n\n\"South-west,\" he said, and glanced at me for a second.  \"We\nwent in a boat.\"\n\n\"But I should have thought an aeroplane?\"\n\n\"They had been seized.\"\n\nI questioned him no more.  Presently I thought he was beginning\nagain.  He broke out in an argumentative monotone:\n\n\"But why should it be?  If, indeed, this battle, this\nslaughter and stress is life, why have we this craving for pleasure\nand beauty?  If there is no refuge, if there is no place of peace,\nand if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare, why\nhave we such dreams?  Surely it was no ignoble cravings, no base\nintentions, had brought us to this; it was Love had isolated us.\nLove had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty, more\nglorious than all else in life, in the very shape and colour of\nlife, and summoned me away.  I had silenced all the voices, I had\nanswered all the questions--I had come to her.  And suddenly there\nwas nothing but War and Death!\"\n\nI had an inspiration.  \"After all,\" I said, \"it could have\nbeen only a dream.\"\n\n\"A dream!\" he cried, flaming upon me, \"a dream--when, even\nnow--\"\n\nFor the first time he became animated.  A faint flush crept\ninto his cheek.  He raised his open hand and clenched it, and\ndropped it to his knee.  He spoke, looking away from me, and for\nall the rest of the time he looked away.  \"We are but phantoms!\" he\nsaid, \"and the phantoms of phantoms, desires like cloud-shadows and\nwills of straw that eddy in the wind; the days pass, use and wont\ncarry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lights--so be\nit!  But one thing is real and certain, one thing is no dream-stuff,\nbut eternal and enduring.  It is the centre of my life, and\nall other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain.  I\nloved her, that woman of a dream.  And she and I are dead together!\n\n\"A dream!  How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living\nlife with unappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived\nfor and cared for, worthless and unmeaning?\n\n\"Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had\nstill a chance of getting away,\" he said.  \"All through the night\nand morning that we sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno, we\ntalked of escape.  We were full of hope, and it clung about us to\nthe end, hope for the life together we should lead, out of it all,\nout of the battle and struggle, the wild and empty passions, the\nempty arbitrary 'thou shalt' and 'thou shalt not' of the world.  We\nwere uplifted, as though our quest was a holy thing, as though love\nfor another was a mission . . . .\n\n\"Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great\nrock Capri--already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and\nhiding-places that were to make it a fastness--we reckoned nothing\nof the imminent slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung\nabout in the puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst\nthe gray; but, indeed, I made a text of that and talked.  There,\nyou know, was the rock, still beautiful for all its scars, with its\ncountless windows and arches and ways, tier upon tier, for a\nthousand feet, a vast carving of gray, broken by vine-clad\nterraces, and lemon and orange groves, and masses of agave and\nprickly pear, and puffs of almond blossom.  And out under the\narchway that is built over the Piccola Marina other boats were\ncoming; and as we came round the cape and within sight of the\nmainland, another little string of boats came into view, driving\nbefore the wind towards the south-west.  In a little while a\nmultitude had come out, the remoter just little specks of\nultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff.\n\n\"'It is love and reason,' I said, 'fleeing from all this\nmadness of war.'\n\n\"And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying\nacross the southern sky we did not heed it.  There it was--a line\nof little dots in the sky--and then more, dotting the south-eastern\nhorizon, and then still more, until all that quarter of the sky was\nstippled with blue specks.  Now they were all thin little strokes\nof blue, and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the\nsun and become short flashes of light.  They came, rising and\nfalling and growing larger, like some huge flight of gulls or rooks\nor such-like birds, moving with a marvellous uniformity, and ever\nas they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky.  The\nsouthward wind flung itself in an arrow-headed cloud athwart the\nsun.  And then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and\nstreamed eastward, growing smaller and smaller and clearer and\nclearer again until they vanished from the sky.  And after that we\nnoted to the northward and very high Evesham's fighting machines\nhanging high over Naples like an evening swarm of gnats.\n\n\"It seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of\nbirds.\n\n\"Even the mutter of guns far away in the south-east seemed to\nus to signify nothing . . .\n\n\"Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still\nseeking that refuge where we might live and love.  Fatigue had come\nupon us, pain and many distresses.  For though we were dusty and\nstained by our toilsome tramping, and half starved and with the\nhorror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the\npeasants--for very soon a gust of fighting swept up the\npeninsula--with these things haunting our minds it still resulted\nonly in a deepening resolution to escape.  Oh, but she was brave\nand patient!  She who had never faced hardship and exposure had\ncourage for herself and me.  We went to and fro seeking an outlet,\nover a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering\nhosts of war.  Always we went on foot.  At first there were other\nfugitives, but we did not mingle with them.  Some escaped\nnorthward, some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept\nalong the main roads; many gave themselves into the hands of the\nsoldiery and were sent northward.  Many of the men were impressed.\nBut we kept away from these things; we had brought no money to\nbribe a passage north, and I feared for my lady at the hands of\nthese conscript crowds.  We had landed at Salerno, and we had been\nturned back from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards Taranto by\na pass over Mount Alburno, but we had been driven back for want of\nfood, and so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum, where\nthose great temples stand alone.  I had some vague idea that by\nPaestum it might be possible to find a boat or something, and take\nonce more to sea.  And there it was the battle overtook us.\n\n\"A sort of soul-blindness had me.  Plainly I could see that we\nwere being hemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had\nus in its toils.  Many times we had seen the levies that had come\ndown from the north going to and fro, and had come upon them in the\ndistance amidst the mountains making ways for the ammunition and\npreparing the mounting of the guns.  Once we fancied they had fired\nat us, taking us for spies--at any rate a shot had gone shuddering\nover us.  Several times we had hidden in woods from hovering\naeroplanes.\n\n\"But all these things do not matter now, these nights of\nflight and pain . . .  We were in an open place near those great\ntemples at Paestum, at last, on a blank stony place dotted with\nspiky bushes, empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of\neucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems.  How I can see\nit!  My lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little, for\nshe was very weak and weary, and I was standing up watching to see\nif I could tell the distance of the firing that came and went.\nThey were still, you know, fighting far from each other, with those\nterrible new weapons that had never before been used: guns that\nwould carry beyond sight, and aeroplanes that would do--What they\nwould do no man could foretell.\n\n\"I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they\ndrew together.  I knew we were in danger, and that we could not\nstop there and rest!\n\n\"Though all these things were in my mind, they were in the\nbackground.  They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern.\nChiefly, I was thinking of my lady.  An aching distress filled me.\nFor the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen\na-weeping.  Behind me I could hear her sobbing, but I would not\nturn round to her because I knew she had need of weeping, and had\nheld herself so far and so long for me.  It was well, I thought,\nthat she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again, for\nI had no inkling of the thing that hung so near.  Even now I can\nsee her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can\nmark again the deepening hollow of her cheek.\n\n\"'If we had parted,' she said, 'if I had let you go.'\n\n\"'No,' said I.'  Even now, I do not repent.  I will not repent;\nI made my choice, and I will hold on to the end.'\n\n\"And then--\n\n\"Overhead in the sky flashed something and burst, and all\nabout us I heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas\nsuddenly thrown.  They chipped the stones about us, and whirled\nfragments from the bricks and passed . . . .\"\n\nHe put his hand to his mouth, and then moistened his lips.\n\n\"At the flash I had turned about . . .\n\n\"You know--she stood up--\n\n\"She stood up, you know, and moved a step towards me--as\nthough she wanted to reach me--\n\n\"And she had been shot through the heart.\"\n\nHe stopped and stared at me.  I felt all that foolish\nincapacity an Englishman feels on such occasions.  I met his eyes\nfor a moment, and then stared out of the window.  For a long space\nwe kept silence.  When at last I looked at him he was sitting back\nin his corner, his arms folded, and his teeth gnawing at his\nknuckles.\n\nHe bit his nail suddenly, and stared at it.\n\n\"I carried her,\" he said, \"towards the temples, in my arms--as\nthough it mattered.  I don't know why.  They seemed a sort of\nsanctuary, you know, they had lasted so long, I suppose.\n\n\"She must have died almost instantly.  Only--I talked to her\nall the way.\"\n\nSilence again.\n\n\"I have seen those temples,\" I said abruptly, and indeed he\nhad brought those still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very\nvividly before me.\n\n\"It was the brown one, the big brown one.  I sat down on a\nfallen pillar and held her in my arms . . . Silent after the first\nbabble was over.  And after a little while the lizards came out and\nran about again, as though nothing unusual was going on, as though\nnothing had changed . . .  It was tremendously still there, the sun\nhigh and the shadows still; even the shadows of the weeds upon the\nentablature were still--in spite of the thudding and banging that\nwent all about the sky.\n\n\"I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the\nsouth, and that the battle went away to the west.  One aeroplane\nwas struck, and overset and fell.  I remember that--though it\ndidn't interest me in the least.  It didn't seem to signify.  It\nwas like a wounded gull, you know--flapping for a time in the\nwater.  I could see it down the aisle of the temple--a black thing\nin the bright blue water.\n\n\"Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then\nthat ceased.  Each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in\nand hid for a space.  That was all the mischief done, except that\nonce a stray bullet gashed the stone hard by--made just a fresh\nbright surface.\n\n\"As the shadows grew longer, the stillness seemed greater.\n\n\"The curious thing,\" he remarked, with the manner of a man who\nmakes a trivial conversation, \"is that I didn't _think_--at\nall.  I sat with her in my arms amidst the stones--in a sort of\nlethargy--stagnant.\n\n\"And I don't remember waking up.  I don't remember dressing\nthat day.  I know I found myself in my office, with my letters all\nslit open in front of me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of\nbeing there, seeing that in reality I was sitting, stunned, in that\nPaestum Temple with a dead woman in my arms.  I read my letters\nlike a machine.  I have forgotten what they were about.\"\n\nHe stopped, and there was a long silence.\n\nSuddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline\nfrom Chalk Farm to Euston.  I started at this passing of time.  I\nturned on him with a brutal question, with the tone of \"Now or\nnever.\"\n\n\"And did you dream again?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe seemed to force himself to finish.  His voice was very low.\n\n\"Once more, and as it were only for a few instants.  I seemed\nto have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into\na sitting position, and the body lay there on the stones beside me.\nA gaunt body.  Not her, you know.  So soon--it was not her . . . .\n\n\"I may have heard voices.  I do not know.  Only I knew clearly\nthat men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last\noutrage.\n\n\"I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came\ninto sight--first one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform\nof dirty white, trimmed with blue, and then several, climbing to\nthe crest of the old wall of the vanished city, and crouching\nthere.  They were little bright figures in the sunlight, and there\nthey hung, weapon in hand, peering cautiously before them.\n\n\"And further away I saw others and then more at another point\nin the wall.  It was a long lax line of men in open order.\n\n\"Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a\ncommand, and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high\nweeds towards the temple.  He scrambled down with them and led\nthem.  He came facing towards me, and when he saw me he stopped.\n\n\"At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but\nwhen I had seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to\nforbid them.  I shouted to the officer.\n\n\"'You must not come here,' I cried, '_I_ am here.  I am\nhere with my dead.'\n\n\"He stared, and then shouted a question back to me in some\nunknown tongue.\n\n\"I repeated what I had said.\n\n\"He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still.\nPresently he spoke to his men and came forward.  He carried a drawn\nsword.\n\n\"I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance.\nI told him again very patiently and clearly: 'You must not come\nhere.  These are old temples and I am here with my dead.'\n\n\"Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly.  It\nwas a narrow face, with dull gray eyes, and a black moustache.  He\nhad a scar on his upper lip, and he was dirty and unshaven.  He\nkept shouting unintelligible things, questions, perhaps, at me.\n\n\"I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did\nnot occur to me.  As I tried to explain to him, he interrupted me\nin imperious tones, bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.\n\n\"He made to go past me, and I caught hold of him.\n\n\"I saw his face change at my grip.\n\n\"'You fool,' I cried.  'Don't you know?  She is dead!'\n\n\"He started back.  He looked at me with cruel eyes.  I saw a\nsort of exultant resolve leap into them--delight.  Then, suddenly,\nwith a scowl, he swept his sword back--_so_--and thrust.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly.\n\nI became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train.  The\nbrakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked.\nThis present world insisted upon itself, became clamourous.  I saw\nthrough the steamy window huge electric fights glaring down from\ntall masts upon a fog, saw rows of stationary empty carriages\npassing by, and then a signal-box hoisting its constellation of\ngreen and red into the murky London twilight, marched after them.\nI looked again at his drawn features.\n\n\"He ran me through the heart.  It was with a sort of\nastonishment--no fear, no pain--but just amazement, that I felt it\npierce me, felt the sword drive home into my body.  It didn't hurt,\nyou know.  It didn't hurt at all.\"\n\nThe yellow platform lights came into the field of view,\npassing first rapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a\njerk.  Dim shapes of men passed to and fro without.\n\n\"Euston!\" cried a voice.\n\n\"Do you mean--?\"\n\n\"There was no pain, no sting or smart.  Amazement and then\ndarkness sweeping over everything.  The hot, brutal face before me,\nthe face of the man who had killed me, seemed to recede.  It swept\nout of existence--\"\n\n\"Euston!\" clamoured the voices outside; \"Euston!\"\n\nThe carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound, and a\nporter stood regarding us.  The sounds of doors slamming, and the\nhoof-clatter of cab-horses, and behind these things the featureless\nremote roar of the London cobble-stones, came to my ears.  A\ntruckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform.\n\n\"A darkness, a flood of darkness that opened and spread and\nblotted out all things.\"\n\n\"Any luggage, sir?\" said the porter.\n\n\"And that was the end?\" I asked.\n\nHe seemed to hesitate.  Then, almost inaudibly, he answered, \"_no_.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"I couldn't get to her. She was there on the other side of the\ntemple-- And then--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I insisted.  \"Yes?\"\n\n\"Nightmares,\" he cried; \"nightmares indeed!  My God!  Great\nbirds that fought and tore.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONE\n\nThe night was hot and overcast, the sky red, rimmed with the\nlingering sunset of mid-summer.  They sat at the open window,\ntrying to fancy the air was fresher there.  The trees and shrubs of\nthe garden stood stiff and dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp\nburnt, bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening.\nFarther were the three lights of the railway signal against the\nlowering sky.  The man and woman spoke to one another in low tones.\n\n\"He does not suspect?\" said the man, a little nervously.\n\n\"Not he,\" she said peevishly, as though that too irritated\nher.  \"He thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel.\nHe has no imagination, no poetry.\"\n\n\"None of these men of iron have,\" he said sententiously.\n\"They have no hearts.\"\n\n\"_He_ has not,\" she said.  She turned her discontented\nface towards the window.  The distant sound of a roaring and\nrushing drew nearer and grew in volume; the house quivered; one\nheard the metallic rattle of the tender.  As the train passed,\nthere was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult\nof smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight black\noblongs--eight trucks--passed across the dim grey of the\nembankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat\nof the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train,\nsmoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp.\n\n\"This country was all fresh and beautiful once,\" he said; \"and\nnow--it is Gehenna.  Down that way--nothing but pot-banks and\nchimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heaven . . . . .\nBut what does it matter?  An end comes, an end to all this cruelty\n. . . . . _To-morrow_.\"  He spoke the last word in a whisper.\n\n\"_To-morrow_,\" she said, speaking in a whisper too, and\nstill staring out of the window.\n\n\"Dear!\" he said, putting his hand on hers.\n\nShe turned with a start, and their eyes searched one\nanother's.  Hers softened to his gaze.  \"My dear one!\" she said,\nand then: \"It seems so strange--that you should have come into my\nlife like this--to open--\"  She paused.\n\n\"To open?\" he said.\n\n\"All this wonderful world--\" she hesitated, and spoke still\nmore softly--\"this world of _love_ to me.\"\n\nThen suddenly the door clicked and closed.  They turned their\nheads, and he started violently back.  In the shadow of the room\nstood a great shadowy figure--silent.  They saw the face dimly in\nthe half-light, with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse\nbrows.  Every muscle in Raut's body suddenly became tense.  When\ncould the door have opened?  What had he heard?  Had he heard all?\nWhat had he seen?  A tumult of questions.\n\nThe new-comer's voice came at last, after a pause that seemed\ninterminable.  \"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,\" said the man at the\nwindow, gripping the window-ledge with his hand.  His voice was\nunsteady.\n\nThe clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow.\nHe made no answer to Raut's remark.  For a moment he stood above\nthem.\n\nThe woman's heart was cold within her.  \"I told Mr. Raut it\nwas just possible you might come back,\" she said, in a voice that\nnever quivered.\n\nHorrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her\nlittle work-table.  His big hands were clenched; one saw now the\nfire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows.  He was trying to\nget his breath.  His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the\nfriend he had trusted, and then back to the woman.\n\nBy this time and for the moment all three half understood one\nanother.  Yet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that\nchoked them.\n\nIt was the husband's voice that broke the silence at last.\n\n\"You wanted to see me?\" he said to Raut.\n\nRaut started as he spoke.  \"I came to see you,\" he said,\nresolved to lie to the last.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Horrocks.\n\n\"You promised,\" said Raut, \"to show me some fine effects of\nmoonlight and smoke.\"\n\n\"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and\nsmoke,\" repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.\n\n\"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down\nto the works,\" proceeded Raut, \"and come with you.\"\n\nThere was another pause.  Did the man mean to take the thing\ncoolly?  Did he after all know?  How long had he been in the room?\nYet even at the moment when they heard the door, their attitudes.\n. . . Horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid\nin the half-light.  Then he glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover\nhimself suddenly.  \"Of course,\" he said, \"I promised to show you\nthe works under their proper dramatic conditions.  It's odd how I\ncould have forgotten.\"\n\n\"If I am troubling you--\" began Raut.\n\nHorrocks started again.  A new light had suddenly come into\nthe sultry gloom of his eyes.  \"Not in the least,\" he said.\n\n\"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of\nflame and shadow you think so splendid?\" said the woman, turning\nnow to her husband for the first time, her confidence creeping back\nagain, her voice just one half-note too high.  \"That dreadful\ntheory of yours that machinery is beautiful, and everything else in\nthe world ugly.  I thought he would not spare you, Mr. Raut.  It's\nhis great theory, his one discovery in art.\"\n\n\"I am slow to make discoveries,\" said Horrocks grimly, damping\nher suddenly.  \"But what I discover . . . . .\"  He stopped.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"Nothing;\" and suddenly he rose to his feet.\n\n\"I promised to show you the works,\" he said to Raut, and put\nhis big, clumsy hand on his friend's shoulder.  \"And you are ready\nto go?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Raut, and stood up also.\n\nThere was another pause.  Each of them peered through the\nindistinctness of the dusk at the other two.  Horrocks' hand still\nrested on Raut's shoulder.  Raut half fancied still that the\nincident was trivial after all.  But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband\nbetter, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in her\nmind took a vague shape of physical evil.  \"Very well\", said\nHorrocks, and, dropping his hand, turned towards the door.\n\n\"My hat?\"  Raut looked round in the half-light.\n\n\"That's my work-basket,\" said Mrs. Horrocks, with a gust of\nhysterical laughter.  Their hands came together on the back of the\nchair.  \"Here it is!\" he said.  She had an impulse to warn him in\nan undertone, but she could not frame a word.  \"Don't go!\" and\n\"Beware of him!\" struggled in her mind, and the swift moment\npassed.\n\n\"Got it?\" said Horrocks, standing with the door half open.\n\nRaut stepped towards him.  \"Better say good-bye to Mrs.\nHorrocks,\" said the ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone\nthan before.\n\nRaut started and turned.  \"Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks,\" he\nsaid, and their hands touched.\n\nHorrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness\nunusual in him towards men.  Raut went out, and then, after a\nwordless look at her, her husband followed.  She stood motionless\nwhile Raut's light footfall and her husband's heavy tread, like\nbass and treble, passed down the passage together.  The front door\nslammed heavily.  She went to the window, moving slowly, and stood\nwatching--leaning forward.  The two men appeared for a moment at\nthe gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were\nhidden by the black masses of the shrubbery.  The lamp-light fell\nfor a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches,\ntelling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved\nvainly to know.  Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in\nthe big arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at the red\nlights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky.  An hour after\nshe was still there, her attitude scarcely changed.\n\nThe oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon\nRaut.  They went side by side down the road in silence, and in\nsilence turned into the cinder-made by-way that presently opened\nout the prospect of the valley.\n\nA blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley\nwith mystery.  Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark\nmasses, outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street\nlamps, and here and there a gaslit window, or the yellow glare of\nsome late-working factory or crowded public-house.  Out of the\nmasses, clear and slender against the evening sky, rose a multitude\nof tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few smokeless during a\nseason of \"play.\"  Here and there a pallid patch and ghostly\nstunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank, or a\nwheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some\ncolliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place.  Nearer\nat hand was the broad stretch of railway, and half invisible trains\nshunted--a steady puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing\nconcussion and a rhythmic series of impacts, and a passage of\nintermittent puffs of white steam across the further view.  And\nto the left, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill\nbeyond, dominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and\ncrowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of\nthe Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big\nironworks of which Horrocks was the manager.  They stood heavy and\nthreatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething\nmolten iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills,\nand the steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron\nsparks hither and thither.  Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel\nwas shot into one of the giants, and the red flames gleamed out,\nand a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards\ntowards the sky.\n\n\"Certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your\nfurnaces,\" said Raut, breaking a silence that had become\napprehensive.\n\nHorrocks grunted.  He stood with his hands in his pockets,\nfrowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks\nbeyond, frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem.\n\nRaut glanced at him and away again.  \"At present your\nmoonlight effect is hardly ripe,\" he continued, looking upward.\n\"The moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight.\"\n\nHorrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has\nsuddenly awakened.  \"Vestiges of daylight? . . . . Of course, of\ncourse.\"  He too looked up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer\nsky.  \"Come along,\" he said suddenly, and, gripping Raut's arm in\nhis hand, made a move towards the path that dropped from them to\nthe railway.\n\nRaut hung back.  Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in\na moment that their eyes came near to say.  Horrocks' hand\ntightened and then relaxed.  He let go, and before Raut was aware\nof it, they were arm in arm, and walking, one unwillingly enough,\ndown the path.\n\n\"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards\nBurslem,\" said Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding\nfast, and tightening the grip of his elbow the while.  \"Little\ngreen lights and red and white lights, all against the haze.  You\nhave an eye for effect, Raut.  It's a fine effect.  And look at\nthose furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come down the\nhill.  That to the right is my pet--seventy feet of him.  I packed\nhim myself, and he's boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts\nfor five long years.  I've a particular fancy for _him_.  That\nline of red there--a lovely bit of warm orange you'd call it,\nRaut--that's the puddlers' furnaces, and there, in the hot light,\nthree black figures--did you see the white splash of the\nsteam-hammer then?--that's the rolling mills.  Come along!\nClang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor!  Sheet tin,\nRaut,--amazing stuff.  Glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff\ncomes from the mill.  And, squelch!--there goes the hammer again.\nCome along!\"\n\nHe had to stop talking to catch at his breath.  His arm\ntwisted into Raut's with benumbing tightness.  He had come striding\ndown the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed.\nRaut had not spoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks'\npull with all his strength.\n\n\"I say,\" he said now, laughing nervously, but with an\nundernote of snarl in his voice, \"why on earth are you nipping my\narm off, Horrocks, and dragging me along like this?\"\n\nAt length Horrocks released him.  His manner changed again.\n\"Nipping your arm off?\" he said.  \"Sorry.  But it's you taught me\nthe trick of walking in that friendly way.\"\n\n\"You haven't learnt the refinements of it yet then,\" said\nRaut, laughing artificially again.  \"By Jove!  I'm black and blue.\"\nHorrocks offered no apology.  They stood now near the bottom of the\nhill, close to the fence that bordered the railway.  The ironworks\nhad grown larger and spread out with their approach.  They looked\nup to the blast furnaces now instead of down; the further view of\nEtruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent.\nBefore them, by the stile rose a notice-board, bearing still dimly\nvisible, the words, \"BEWARE OF THE TRAINS,\" half hidden by splashes\nof coaly mud.\n\n\"Fine effects,\" said Horrocks, waving his arm.  \"Here comes a\ntrain.  The puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of\nlight in front of it, the melodious rattle.  Fine effects!  But\nthese furnaces of mine used to be finer, before we shoved cones in\ntheir throats, and saved the gas.\"\n\n\"How?\" said Raut.  \"Cones?\"\n\n\"Cones, my man, cones.  I'll show you one nearer.  The flames\nused to flare out of the open throats, great--what is it?--pillars\nof cloud by day, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night.\nNow we run it off in pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the\ntop is shut by a cone.  You'll be interested in that cone.\"\n\n\"But every now and then,\" said Raut, \"you get a burst of fire\nand smoke up there.\"\n\n\"The cone's not fixed, it's hung by a chain from a lever, and\nbalanced by an equipoise.  You shall see it nearer.  Else, of\ncourse, there'd be no way of getting fuel into the thing.  Every\nnow and then the cone dips, and out comes the flare.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Raut.  He looked over his shoulder.  \"The moon\ngets brighter,\" he said.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder\nagain, and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing.  And\nthen came one of those swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that\nthey leave one doubtful and reeling.  Halfway across, Horrocks'\nhand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice, and swung him backward\nand through a half-turn, so that he looked up the line.  And there\na chain of lamp-lit carriage-windows telescoped swiftly as it came\ntowards them, and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew\nlarger and larger, rushing down upon them.  As he grasped what this\nmeant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all\nhis strength against the arm that held him back between the rails.\nThe struggle did not last a moment.  Just as certain as it was that\nHorrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been\nviolently lugged out of danger.\n\n\"Out of the way,\" said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train\ncame rattling by, and they stood panting by the gate into the\nironworks.\n\n\"I did not see it coming,\" said Raut, still, even in spite of\nhis own apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary\nintercourse.\n\nHorrocks answered with a grunt.  \"The cone,\" he said, and\nthen, as one who recovers himself, \"I thought you did not hear.\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" said Raut.\n\n\"I wouldn't have had you run over then for the world,\" said\nHorrocks.\n\n\"For a moment I lost my nerve,\" said Raut.\n\nHorrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards\nthe ironworks again.  \"See how fine these great mounds of mine,\nthese clinker-heaps, look in the night!  That truck yonder, up\nabove there!  Up it goes, and out-tilts the slag.  See the\npalpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope.  As we get nearer,\nthe heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces.  See the quiver up\nabove the big one.  Not that way!  This way, between the heaps.\nThat goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show you the\ncanal first.\"  He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went\nalong side by side.  Raut answered Horrocks vaguely.  What, he\nasked himself, had really happened on the line?  Was he deluding\nhimself with his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held him\nback in the way of the train?  Had he just been within an ace of\nbeing murdered?\n\nSuppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything?\nFor a minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life,\nbut the mood passed as he reasoned with himself.  After all,\nHorrocks might have heard nothing.  At any rate, he had pulled him\nout of the way in time.  His odd manner might be due to the mere\nvague jealousy he had shown once before.  He was talking now of the\nash-heaps and the canal.  \"Eigh?\" said Horrocks.\n\n\"What?\" said Raut.  \"Rather!  The haze in the moonlight. Fine!\"\n\n\"Our canal,\" said Horrocks, stopping suddenly.  \"Our canal by\nmoonlight and firelight is an immense effect.  You've never seen\nit?  Fancy that!  You've spent too many of your evenings\nphilandering up in Newcastle there.  I tell you, for real florid\neffects--But you shall see.  Boiling water . . .\"\n\nAs they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds\nof coal and ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them\nsuddenly, loud, near, and distinct.  Three shadowy workmen went by\nand touched their caps to Horrocks.  Their faces were vague in the\ndarkness.  Raut felt a futile impulse to address them, and before\nhe could frame his words, they passed into the shadows.  Horrocks\npointed to the canal close before them now: a weird-looking place\nit seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the furnaces.  The hot\nwater that cooled the tuyeres came into it, some fifty yards up--a\ntumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up from\nthe water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about\nthem, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black\nand red eddies, a white uprising that made the head swim.  The\nshining black tower of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead out\nof the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their ears.  Raut kept\naway from the edge of the water, and watched Horrocks.\n\n\"Here it is red,\" said Horrocks, \"blood-red vapour as red and\nhot as sin; but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and\nit drives across the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.\"\n\nRaut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily\nto his watch on Horrocks.  \"Come along to the rolling-mills,\" said\nHorrocks.  The threatening hold was not so evident that time, and\nRaut felt a little reassured.  But all the same, what on earth did\nHorrocks mean about \"white as death\" and \"red as sin?\"\nCoincidence, perhaps?\n\nThey went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while,\nand then through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din\nthe deliberate steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent\niron, and black, half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like\nhot sealing-wax, between the wheels.  \"Come on,\" said Horrocks in\nRaut's ear, and they went and peeped through the little glass hole\nbehind the tuyeres, and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of\nthe blast-furnace.  It left one eye blinded for a while.  Then,\nwith green and blue patches dancing across the dark, they went to\nthe lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised\nto the top of the big cylinder.\n\nAnd out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace, Raut's\ndoubts came upon him again.  Was it wise to be here?  If Horrocks\ndid know--everything!  Do what he would, he could not resist a\nviolent trembling.  Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy\nfeet.  It was a dangerous place.  They pushed by a truck of fuel to\nget to the railing that crowned the place.  The reek of the\nfurnace, a sulphurous vapor streaked with pungent bitterness,\nseemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver.  The moon was\nriding out now from among a drift of clouds, halfway up the sky\nabove the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle.  The steaming\ncanal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge, and\nvanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards Burslem.\n\n\"That's the cone I've been telling you of,\" shouted Horrocks;\n\"and, below that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air\nof the blast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.\"\n\nRaut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the\ncone.  The heat was intense.  The boiling of the iron and the\ntumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks'\nvoice.  But the thing had to be gone through now.  Perhaps, after\nall . . .\n\n\"In the middle,\" bawled Horrocks, \"temperature near a thousand\ndegrees.  If _you_ were dropped into it . . . . flash into\nflame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle.  Put your hand out and\nfeel the heat of his breath.  Why, even up here I've seen the\nrain-water boiling off the trucks.  And that cone there.  It's a\ndamned sight too hot for roasting cakes.  The top side of it's\nthree hundred degrees.\"\n\n\"Three hundred degrees!\" said Raut.\n\n\"Three hundred centigrade, mind!\" said Horrocks.  \"It will\nboil the blood out of you in no time.\"\n\n\"Eigh?\" said Raut, and turned.\n\n\"Boil the blood out of you in . . . No, you don't!\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" screamed Raut.  \"Let go my arm!\"\n\nWith one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both.\nFor a moment the two men stood swaying.  Then suddenly, with a\nviolent jerk, Horrocks had twisted him from his hold.  He clutched\nat Horrocks and missed, his foot went back into empty air; in\nmid-air he twisted himself, and then cheek and shoulder and knee\nstruck the hot cone together.\n\nHe clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing\nsank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it.  A circle of glowing\nred appeared about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the\nchaos within, flickered up towards him.  An intense pain assailed\nhim at the knees, and he could smell the singeing of his hands.  He\nraised himself to his feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and\nthen something struck his head.  Black and shining with the\nmoonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.\n\nHorrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel\non the rail.  The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the\nmoonlight, and shouting, \"Fizzle, you fool!  Fizzle, you hunter of\nwomen!  You hot-blooded hound!  Boil! boil! boil!\"\n\nSuddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and\nflung it deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.\n\n\"Horrocks!\" cried Raut.  \"Horrocks!\"\n\nHe clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the\nburning of the cone.  Each missile Horrocks flung hit him.  His\nclothes charred and glowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped,\nand a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him\nin a swift breath of flame.\n\nHis human likeness departed from him.  When the momentary red\nhad passed, Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head\nstreaked with blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain,\nand writhing in agony--a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous\ncreature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek.\n\nAbruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster's anger passed.  A\ndeadly sickness came upon him.  The heavy odour of burning flesh\ncame drifting up to his nostrils.  His sanity returned to him.\n\n\"God have mercy upon me!\" he cried.  \"O God! what have I\ndone?\"\n\nHe knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and\nfelt, was already a dead man--that the blood of the poor wretch\nmust be boiling in his veins.  An intense realisation of that agony\ncame to his mind, and overcame every other feeling.  For a moment\nhe stood irresolute, and then, turning to the truck, he hastily\ntilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a\nman.  The mass fell with a thud, and went radiating over the cone.\nWith the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling confusion of smoke,\ndust, and flame came rushing up towards him.  As it passed, he saw\nthe cone clear again.\n\nThen he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the\nrail with both hands.  His lips moved, but no words came to them.\n\nDown below was the sound of voices and running steps.  The\nclangour of rolling in the shed ceased abruptly.\n\n\n\n\nA MOONLIGHT FABLE\n\nThere was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit\nof clothes.  It was green and gold and woven so that I cannot\ndescribe how delicate and fine it was, and there was a tie of\norange fluffiness that tied up under his chin.  And the buttons\nin their newness shone like stars.  He was proud and pleased by his\nsuit beyond measure, and stood before the long looking-glass when\nfirst he put it on, so astonished and delighted with it that he\ncould hardly turn himself away.\n\nHe wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of\npeople.  He thought over all the places he had ever visited and all\nthe scenes he had ever heard described, and tried to imagine what\nthe feel of it would be if he were to go now to those scenes and\nplaces wearing his shining suit, and he wanted to go out forthwith\ninto the long grass and the hot sunshine of the meadow wearing it.\nJust to wear it!  But his mother told him, \"No.\"  She told him he\nmust take great care of his suit, for never would he have another\nnearly so fine; he must save it and save it and only wear it on\nrare and great occasions.  It was his wedding suit, she said.  And\nshe took his buttons and twisted them up with tissue paper for fear\ntheir bright newness should be tarnished, and she tacked little\nguards over the cuffs and elbows and wherever the suit was most\nlikely to come to harm.  He hated and resisted these things, but\nwhat could he do?  And at last her warnings and persuasions had\neffect and he consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it\ninto its proper creases and put it away.  It was almost as though\nhe gave it up again.  But he was always thinking of wearing it\nand of the supreme occasion when some day it might be worn without\nthe guards, without the tissue paper on the buttons, utterly and\ndelightfully, never caring, beautiful beyond measure.\n\nOne night when he was dreaming of it, after his habit, he\ndreamed he took the tissue paper from one of the buttons and found\nits brightness a little faded, and that distressed him mightily in\nhis dream.  He polished the poor faded button and polished it, and\nif anything it grew duller.  He woke up and lay awake thinking of\nthe brightness a little dulled and wondering how he would feel if\nperhaps when the great occasion (whatever it might be) should\narrive, one button should chance to be ever so little short of its\nfirst glittering freshness, and for days and days that thought\nremained with him, distressingly.  And when next his mother let him\nwear his suit, he was tempted and nearly gave way to the temptation\njust to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper and see if indeed\nthe buttons were keeping as bright as ever.\n\nHe went trimly along on his way to church full of this wild\ndesire.  For you must know his mother did, with repeated and\ncareful warnings, let him wear his suit at times, on Sundays, for\nexample, to and fro from church, when there was no threatening of\nrain, no dust nor anything to injure it, with its buttons covered\nand its protections tacked upon it and a sunshade in his hand to\nshadow it if there seemed too strong a sunlight for its colours.\nAnd always, after such occasions, he brushed it over and folded it\nexquisitely as she had taught him, and put it away again.\n\nNow all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of\nhis suit he obeyed, always he obeyed them, until one strange night\nhe woke up and saw the moonlight shining outside his window.  It\nseemed to him the moonlight was not common moonlight, nor the night\na common night, and for a while he lay quite drowsily with this odd\npersuasion in his mind.  Thought joined on to thought like things\nthat whisper warmly in the shadows.  Then he sat up in his little\nbed suddenly, very alert, with his heart beating very fast and a\nquiver in his body from top to toe.  He had made up his mind.  He\nknew now that he was going to wear his suit as it should be worn.\nHe had no doubt in the matter.  He was afraid, terribly afraid, but\nglad, glad.\n\nHe got out of his bed and stood a moment by the window looking\nat the moonshine-flooded garden and trembling at the thing he meant\nto do.  The air was full of a minute clamor of crickets and\nmurmurings, of the infinitesimal shouting of little living things.\nHe went very gently across the creaking boards, for fear that he\nmight wake the sleeping house, to the big dark clothes-press\nwherein his beautiful suit lay folded, and he took it out garment\nby garment and softly and very eagerly tore off its tissue-paper\ncovering and its tacked protections, until there it was, perfect\nand delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had given it\nto him--a long time it seemed ago.  Not a button had tarnished, not\na thread had faded on this dear suit of his; he was glad enough for\nweeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on.  And then back he\nwent, soft and quick, to the window and looked out upon the garden\nand stood there for a minute, shining in the moonlight, with his\nbuttons twinkling like stars, before he got out on the sill and,\nmaking as little of a rustling as he could, clambered down to the\ngarden path below.  He stood before his mother's house, and it was\nwhite and nearly as plain as by day, with every window-blind but\nhis own shut like an eye that sleeps.  The trees cast still shadows\nlike intricate black lace upon the wall.\n\nThe garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden\nby day; moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in\nphantom cobwebs from spray to spray.  Every flower was gleaming\nwhite or crimson black, and the air was aquiver with the thridding\nof small crickets and nightingales singing unseen in the depths of\nthe trees.\n\nThere was no darkness in the world, but only warm, mysterious\nshadows; and all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with\niridescent jewels of dew.  The night was warmer than any night had\never been, the heavens by some miracle at once vaster and nearer,\nand spite of the great ivory-tinted moon that ruled the world, the\nsky was full of stars.\n\nThe little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite\ngladness.  He stood for a time like one awe-stricken, and then,\nwith a queer small cry and holding out his arms, he ran out as if\nhe would embrace at once the whole warm round immensity of the\nworld.  He did not follow the neat set paths that cut the garden\nsquarely, but thrust across the beds and through the wet, tall,\nscented herbs, through the night stock and the nicotine and the\nclusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets\nof southern-wood and lavender, and knee-deep across a wide space of\nmignonette.  He came to the great hedge and he thrust his way\nthrough it, and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply\nand tore threads from his wonderful suit, and though burs and\ngoosegrass and havers caught and clung to him, he did not care.  He\ndid not care, for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which\nhe had longed.  \"I am glad I put on my suit,\" he said; \"I am glad\nI wore my suit.\"\n\nBeyond the hedge he came to the duck-pond, or at least to what\nwas the duck-pond by day.  But by night it was a great bowl of\nsilver moonshine all noisy with singing frogs, of wonderful silver\nmoonshine twisted and clotted with strange patternings, and the\nlittle man ran down into its waters between the thin black rushes,\nknee-deep and waist-deep and to his shoulders, smiting the water to\nblack and shining wavelets with either hand, swaying and shivering\nwavelets, amid which the stars were netted in the tangled\nreflections of the brooding trees upon the bank.  He waded until he\nswam, and so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other side,\ntrailing, as it seemed to him, not duckweed, but very silver in\nlong, clinging, dripping masses.  And up he went through the\ntransfigured tangles of the willow-herb and the uncut seeding grass\nof the farther bank.  And so he came glad and breathless into the\nhighroad.  \"I am glad,\" he said, \"beyond measure, that I had\nclothes that fitted this occasion.\"\n\nThe highroad ran straight as an arrow flies, straight into the\ndeep blue pit of sky beneath the moon, a white and shining road\nbetween the singing nightingales, and along it he went, running now\nand leaping, and now walking and rejoicing, in the clothes his\nmother had made for him with tireless, loving hands.  The road was\ndeep in dust, but that for him was only soft whiteness, and as he\nwent a great dim moth came fluttering round his wet and shimmering\nand hastening figure.  At first he did not heed the moth, and then\nhe waved his hands at it and made a sort of dance with it as it\ncircled round his head.  \"Soft moth!\" he cried, \"dear moth!  And\nwonderful night, wonderful night of the world!  Do you think my\nclothes are beautiful, dear moth?  As beautiful as your scales and\nall this silver vesture of the earth and sky?\"\n\nAnd the moth circled closer and closer until at last its\nvelvet wings just brushed his lips . . . . .\n\nAnd next morning they found him dead with his neck broken in\nthe bottom of the stone pit, with his beautiful clothes a little\nbloody and foul and stained with the duckweed from the pond.  But\nhis face was a face of such happiness that, had you seen it, you\nwould have understood indeed how that he had died happy, never\nknowing the cool and streaming silver for the duckweed in the pond.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DIAMOND MAKER\n\nSome business had detained me in Chancery Lane nine in the\nevening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was\ndisinclined either for entertainment or further work.  So much of\nthe sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left\nvisible spoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way\ndown to the Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by\nwatching the variegated lights upon the river.  Beyond comparison\nthe night is the best time for this place; a merciful darkness\nhides the dirt of the waters, and the lights of this transitional\nage, red glaring orange, gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in\nshadowy outlines of every possible shade between grey and deep\npurple.  Through the arches of Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of\nlight mark the sweep of the Embankment, and above its parapet rise\nthe towers of Westminster, warm grey against the starlight.  The\nblack river goes by with only a rare ripple breaking its silence,\nand disturbing the reflections of the lights that swim upon its\nsurface.\n\n\"A warm night,\" said a voice at my side.\n\nI turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning\nover the parapet beside me.  It was a refined face, not unhandsome,\nthough pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and\npinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a\nuniform.  I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and\nbreakfast if I answered him.\n\nI looked at him curiously.  Would he have anything to tell me\nworth the money, or was he the common incapable--incapable even of\ntelling his own story?  There was a quality of intelligence in his\nforehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip\nthat decided me.\n\n\"Very warm,\" said I; \"but not too warm for us here.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, still looking across the water, \"it is pleasant\nenough here . . . . just now.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" he continued after a pause, \"to find anything so\nrestful as this in London.  After one has been fretting about\nbusiness all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and\nparrying dangers, I do not know what one would do if it were not\nfor such pacific corners.\"  He spoke with long pauses between the\nsentences.  \"You must know a little of the irksome labour of the\nworld, or you would not be here.  But I doubt if you can be so\nbrain-weary and footsore as I am . . . . Bah!  Sometimes I doubt if\nthe game is worth the candle.  I feel inclined to throw the whole\nthing over--name, wealth and position--and take to some modest\ntrade.  But I know if I abandoned my ambition--hardly as she uses\nme--I should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my\ndays.\"\n\nHe became silent.  I looked at him in astonishment.  If ever\nI saw a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me.  He\nwas ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as\nthough he had been left in a dust-bin for a week.  And he was\ntalking to _me_ of the irksome worries of a large business.\nI almost laughed outright.  Either he was mad or playing a sorry\njest on his own poverty.\n\n\"If high aims and high positions,\" said I, \"have their\ndrawbacks of hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations.\nInfluence, the power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and\npoorer than ourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in\ndisplay . . . . . \"\n\nMy banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste.  I\nspoke on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech.  I\nwas sorry even while I was speaking.\n\nHe turned a haggard but very composed face upon me.  Said he:\n\"I forgot myself.  Of course you would not understand.\"\n\nHe measured me for a moment.  \"No doubt it is very absurd.\nYou will not believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly\nsafe to tell you.  And it will be a comfort to tell someone.  I\nreally have a big business in hand, a very big business.  But there\nare troubles just now.  The fact is . . . . I make diamonds.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said I, \"you are out of work just at present?\"\n\n\"I am sick of being disbelieved,\" he said impatiently, and\nsuddenly unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little\ncanvas bag that was hanging by a cord round his neck.  From this he\nproduced a brown pebble.  \"I wonder if you know enough to know what\nthat is?\"  He handed it to me.\n\nNow, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a\nLondon science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and\nmineralogy.  The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the\ndarker sort, though far too large, being almost as big as the top\nof my thumb.  I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular\noctahedron, with the curved faces peculiar to the most precious of\nminerals.  I took out my penknife and tried to scratch it--vainly.\nLeaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my\nwatch-glass, and scored a white line across that with the greatest\nease.\n\nI looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity.  \"It\ncertainly is rather like a diamond.  But, if so, it is a Behemoth\nof diamonds.  Where did you get it?\"\n\n\"I tell you I made it,\" he said.  \"Give it back to me.\"\n\nHe replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket.  \"I will sell\nit you for one hundred pounds,\" he suddenly whispered eagerly.\nWith that my suspicions returned.  The thing might, after all, be\nmerely a lump of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with\nan accidental resemblance in shape to the diamond.  Or if it was a\ndiamond, how came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred\npounds?\n\nWe looked into one another's eyes.  He seemed eager, but\nhonestly eager.  At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was\ntrying to sell.  Yet I am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave\na visible gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by\ngaslight from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only.  Still,\na diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of\npounds.  Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without\nbeing mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind\nthe stories of contraband and light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape.\nI put the question of purchase on one side.\n\n\"How did you get it?\" said I.\n\n\"I made it.\"\n\nI had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial\ndiamonds were very small.  I shook my head.\n\n\"You seem to know something of this kind of thing.  I will\ntell you a little about myself.  Perhaps then you may think better\nof the purchase.\"  He turned round with his back to the river, and\nput his hands in his pockets.  He sighed.  \"I know you will not\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"Diamonds,\" he began--and as he spoke his voice lost its faint\nflavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an\neducated man--are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination\nin a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon\ncrystallises out, not as black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as\nsmall diamonds.  So much has been known to chemists for years, but\nno one yet had hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up\nthe carbon, or exactly the right pressure for the best results.\nConsequently the diamonds made by chemists are small and dark,\nand worthless as jewels.  Now I, you know, have given up my life to\nthis problem--given my life to it.\n\n\"I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I\nwas seventeen, and now I am thirty-two.  It seemed to me that it\nmight take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or\ntwenty years, but, even if it did, the game was still worth the\ncandle.  Suppose one to have at last just hit the right trick\nbefore the secret got out and diamonds became as common as coal,\none might realize millions.  Millions!\"\n\nHe paused and looked for my sympathy.  His eyes shone\nhungrily.  \"To think,\" said he, \"that I am on the verge of it all,\nand here!\n\n\"I had,\" he proceeded, \"about a thousand pounds when I was\ntwenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching,\nwould keep my researches going.  A year or two was spent in study,\nat Berlin chiefly, and then I continued on my own account.  The\ntrouble was the secrecy.  You see, if once I had let out what I was\ndoing, other men might have been spurred on by my belief in the\npracticability of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a\ngenius as to have been sure of coming in first, in the case of a\nrace for the discovery.  And you see it was important that if I\nreally meant to make a pile, people should not know it was an\nartificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the ton.\nSo I had to work all alone.  At first I had a little laboratory,\nbut as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my\nexperiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where\nI slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all my\napparatus.  The money simply flowed away.  I grudged myself\neverything except scientific appliances.  I tried to keep things\ngoing by a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and\nI have no university degree, nor very much education except in\nchemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour for\nprecious little money.  But I got nearer and nearer the thing.\nThree years ago I settled the problem of the composition of the\nflux, and got near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a\ncertain carbon composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up\nwith water, sealing tightly, and heating.\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"Rather risky,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes.  It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my\napparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless.\nFollowing out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten\nmixture from which the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some\nresearches of Daubree's at the Paris _Laboratorie des Poudres et\nSalpetres_.  He exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel\ncylinder, too strong to burst, and I found he could crush rocks\ninto a muck not unlike the South African bed in which diamonds are\nfound.  It was a tremendous strain on my resources, but I got a\nsteel cylinder made for my purpose after his pattern.  I put in all\nmy stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my furnace, put the\nwhole concern in, and--went out for a walk.\"\n\nI could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner.  \"Did\nyou not think it would blow up the house?  Were there other people\nin the place?\"\n\n\"It was in the interest of science,\" he said, ultimately.  \"There\nwas a costermonger family on the floor below, a begging-letter\nwriter in the room behind mine, and two flower-women were\nupstairs.  Perhaps it was a bit thoughtless.  But possibly\nsome of them were out.\n\n\"When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among\nthe white-hot coals.  The explosive hadn't burst the case.  And\nthen I had a problem to face.  You know time is an important\nelement in crystallisation.  If you hurry the process the crystals\nare small--it is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any\nsize.  I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years, letting\nthe temperature go down slowly during the time.  And I was now\nquite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room, as\nwell as my hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world.\n\n\"I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was\nmaking the diamonds.  I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened\ncab-doors.  For many weeks I addressed envelopes.  I had a place as\nassistant to a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one\nside of the road while he called down the other.\n\n\"Once for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged.\nWhat a week that was!  One day the fire was going out and I had\neaten nothing all day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave\nme sixpence--to show off.  Thank heaven for vanity!  How the\nfish-shops smelt!  But I went and spent it all on coals, and had\nthe furnace bright red again, and then--Well, hunger makes a fool\nof a man.\n\n\"At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out.  I took my\ncylinder and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it\npunished my hands, and I scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass\nwith a chisel, and hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate.\nAnd I found three big diamonds and five small ones.  As I sat on\nthe floor hammering, my door opened, and my neighbour, the\nbegging-letter writer came in.  He was drunk--as he usually is.\n\"'Nerchist,' said he.  'You're drunk,' said I. ''Structive\nscoundrel,' said he.  'Go to your father,' said I, meaning the\nFather of Lies.  'Never you mind,' said he, and gave me a cunning\nwink, and hiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with his other\neye against the door-post, began to babble of how he had been\nprying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that morning,\nand how they had taken down everything he had to say--''siffiwas\na ge'm,' said he.  Then I suddenly realised I was in a hole.\nEither I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get\nthe whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist.  So I\nwent up to my neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him\nabout a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out.\nThe evening newspapers called my den the Kentish Town Bomb Factory.\nAnd now I cannot part with the things for love or money.\n\n\"If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and\ngo and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I\ncannot wait.  And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he\nsimply stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I\nwanted it back.  I am going about now with several hundred thousand\npounds-worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or\nshelter.  You are the first person I have taken into my confidence.\nBut I like your face and I am hard-driven.\"\n\nHe looked into my eyes.\n\n\"It would be madness,\" said I, \"for me to buy a diamond under\nthe circumstances.  Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds\nabout in my pocket. Yet I more than half believe your story.  I\nwill, if you like, do this: come to my office to-morrow . . . .\"\n\n\"You think I am a thief!\" said he keenly.  \"You will tell the\npolice.  I am not coming into a trap.\"\n\n\"Somehow I am assured you are no thief.  Here is my card.\nTake that, anyhow.  You need not come to any appointment.  Come\nwhen you will.\"\n\nHe took the card, and an earnest of my good-will.\n\n\"Think better of it and come,\" said I.\n\nHe shook his head doubtfully.  \"I will pay back your\nhalf-crown with interest some day--such interest as will amaze\nyou,\" said he.  \"Anyhow, you will keep the secret? . . . . Don't\nfollow me.\"\n\nHe crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the\nlittle steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let\nhim go.  And that was the last I ever saw of him.\n\nAfterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send\nbank-notes--not cheques--to certain addresses.  I weighed the\nmatter over and took what I conceived to be the wisest course.\nOnce he called upon me when I was out.  My urchin described him as\na very thin, dirty, and ragged man, with a dreadful cough.  He left\nno message.  That was the finish of him so far as my story goes.\nI wonder sometimes what has become of him.  Was he an ingenious\nmonomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really\nmade diamonds as he asserted?  The latter is just sufficiently\ncredible to make me think at times that I have missed the most\nbrilliant opportunity of my life.  He may of course be dead, and\nhis diamonds carelessly thrown aside--one, I repeat, was almost as\nbig as my thumb.  Or he may be still wandering about trying to sell\nthe things.  It is just possible he may yet emerge upon society,\nand, passing athwart my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to\nthe wealthy and the well-advertised, reproach me silently for my\nwant of enterprise.  I sometimes think I might at least have risked\nfive pounds.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS\n\nThe chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at\nCamberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of\nYorkshire, and his name was James Holroyd.  He was a practical\nelectrician, but fond of whisky, a heavy red-haired brute with\nirregular teeth.  He doubted the existence of the deity, but\naccepted Carnot's cycle, and he had read Shakespeare and found him\nweak in chemistry.  His helper came out of the mysterious East, and\nhis name was Azuma-zi.  But Holroyd called him Pooh-bah.  Holroyd\nliked a nigger because he would stand kicking--a habit with\nHolroyd--and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the\nways of it.  Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought\ninto abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd\nnever fully realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of\nthem.\n\nTo define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology.  He was, perhaps,\nmore negroid than anything else, though his hair was curly rather\nthan frizzy, and his nose had a bridge.  Moreover, his skin was\nbrown rather than black, and the whites of his eyes were yellow.\nHis broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave his face something of the\nviperine V. His head, too, was broad behind, and low and narrow at\nthe forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse\nway to a European's.  He was short of stature and still shorter of\nEnglish.  In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known\nmarketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought\ninto heraldic grotesqueness.  Holroyd tried to elucidate his\nreligious beliefs, and--especially after whisky--lectured to him\nagainst superstition and missionaries.  Azuma-zi, however, shirked\nthe discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for it.\n\nAzuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment,\nout of the stokehole of the _Lord Clive_, from the Straits\nSettlements, and beyond, into London.  He had heard even in his\nyouth of the greatness and riches of London, where all the women\nare white and fair, and even the beggars in the streets are white,\nand he arrived, with newly earned gold coins in his pocket, to\nworship at the shrine of civilisation.  The day of his landing was\na dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried drizzle filtered\ndown to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into the delights\nof Shadwell, and was presently cast up, shattered in health,\ncivilised in costume, penniless and, except in matters of the\ndirest necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for James\nHolroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell.\nAnd to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love.\n\nThere were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell.\nThe two that had been there since the beginning were small\nmachines; the larger one was new.  The smaller machines made a\nreasonable noise; their straps hummed over the drums, every now and\nthen the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the air churned steadily,\nwhoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles.  One was loose in its\nfoundations and kept the shed vibrating.  But the big dynamo\ndrowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of\nits iron core, which somehow set part of the ironwork humming.  The\nplace made the visitor's head reel with the throb, throb, throb of\nthe engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the spinning\nball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over all\nthe deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo.  This last\nnoise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi\naccounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride.\n\nIf it were possible we would have the noises of that shed\nalways about the reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to\nsuch an accompaniment.  It was a steady stream of din, from which\nthe ear picked out first one thread and then another; there was the\nintermittent snorting, panting, and seething of the steam engines,\nthe suck and thud of their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the\nspokes of the great driving-wheels came round, a note the leather\nstraps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult\nfrom the dynamos; and over all, sometimes inaudible, as the ear\ntired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was this\ntrombone note of the big machine.  The floor never felt steady and\nquiet beneath one's feet, but quivered and jarred.  It was a\nconfusing, unsteady place, and enough to send anyone's thoughts\njerking into odd zigzags.  And for three months, while the big\nstrike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a\nblackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the\nstir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty\nbetween the shed and the gates.\n\nHolroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big\nmachine soon after Azuma-zi came.  He had to shout to be heard in\nthe din.  \"Look at that,\" said Holroyd; \"where's your 'eathen idol\nto match 'im?\"  And Azuma-zi looked.  For a moment Holroyd was\ninaudible, and then Azuma-zi heard: \"Kill a hundred men.  Twelve\nper cent. on the ordinary shares,\" said Holroyd, \"and that's\nsomething like a Gord!\"\n\nHolroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its\nsize and power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of\nthought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within\nthe curly black cranium.  He would explain in the most graphic\nmanner the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by it,\nand once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample of its quality.\nAfter that, in the breathing-times of his labour--it was heavy\nlabour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd's--Azuma-zi\nwould sit and watch the big machine.  Now and then the brushes\nwould sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear,\nbut all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing.  The band\nran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was\nthe complacent thud of the piston.  So it lived all day in this big\nairy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up\nand slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew--mere\ncaptive devils of the British Solomon--had been, but a machine\nenthroned.  Those two smaller dynamos, Azuma-zi by force of\ncontrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord\nof the Dynamos.  They were fretful and irregular, but the big\ndynamo was steady.  How great it was!  How serene and easy in its\nworking!  Greater and calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at\nRangoon, and yet not motionless, but living!  The great black coils\nspun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the brushes, and the\ndeep note of its coil steadied the whole.  It affected Azuma-zi\nqueerly.\n\nAzuma-zi was not fond of labour.  He would sit about and watch\nthe Lord of the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the\nyard porter to get whisky, although his proper place was not in the\ndynamo shed but behind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd\ncaught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout copper\nwire.  He would go and stand close to the colossus and look up at\nthe great leather band running overhead.  There was a black patch\non the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow among all\nthe clatter to watch this return again and again.  Odd thoughts\nspun with the whirl of it.  Scientific people tell us that savages\ngive souls to rocks and trees--and a machine is a thousand times\nmore alive than a rock or a tree.  And Azuma-zi was practically a\nsavage still; the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his\nslop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and hands.\nHis father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred\nblood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut.\n\nHe took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and\nhandling the great dynamo that was fascinating him.  He polished\nand cleaned it until the metal parts were blinding in the sun.  He\nfelt a mysterious sense of service in doing this.  He would go up\nto it and touch its spinning coils gently.  The gods he had\nworshipped were all far away.  The people in London hid their gods.\n\nAt last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in\nthoughts and at last in acts.  When he came into the roaring shed\none morning he salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then when\nHolroyd was away, he went and whispered to the thundering machine\nthat he was its servant, and prayed it to have pity on him and save\nhim from Holroyd.  As he did so a rare gleam of light came in\nthrough the open archway of the throbbing machine-shed, and the\nLord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was radiant with\npale gold.  Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable to\nhis Lord.  After that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and\nhe had indeed been very much alone in London.  And even when his\nwork time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed.\n\nThen, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went\npresently to the Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, \"Thou seest, O\nmy Lord!\" and the angry whir of the machinery seemed to answer him.\nThereafter it appeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the\nshed a different note came into the sounds of the dynamo.  \"My Lord\nbides his time,\" said Azuma-zi to himself.  \"The iniquity of the\nfool is not yet ripe.\"  And he waited and watched for the day of\nreckoning.  One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and\nHolroyd, making an unwary examination--it was in the afternoon--got\na rather severe shock.  Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him\njump off and curse at the peccant coil.\n\n\"He is warned,\" said Azuma-zi to himself.  \"Surely my Lord is\nvery patient.\"\n\nHolroyd had at first initiated his \"nigger\" into such\nelementary conceptions of the dynamo's working as would enable him\nto take temporary charge of the shed in his absence.  But when he\nnoticed the manner in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster he\nbecame suspicious.  He dimly perceived his assistant was \"up to\nsomething,\" and connecting him with the anointing of the coils with\noil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued an edict,\nshouted above the confusion of the machinery, \"Don't 'ee go nigh\nthat big dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a'll take thy skin off!\"\nBesides, if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was\nplain sense and decency to keep him away from it.\n\nAzuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing\nbefore the Lord of the Dynamos.  At which Holroyd twisted his arm\nand kicked him as he turned to go away.  As Azuma-zi presently\nstood behind the engine and glared at the back of the hated\nHolroyd, the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm, and sounded\nlike four words in his native tongue.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly what madness is.  I fancy Azuma-zi\nwas mad.  The incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have\nchurned up his little store of knowledge and his big store of\nsuperstitious fancy, at last, into something akin to frenzy.  At\nany rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo\nFetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him with a strange\ntumult of exultant emotion.\n\nThat night the two men and their black shadows were alone in\nthe shed together.  The shed was lit with one big arc light that\nwinked and flickered purple.  The shadows lay black behind the\ndynamos, the ball governors of the engines whirled from light to\ndarkness, and their pistons beat loud and steady.  The world\noutside seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly dim\nand remote.  It seemed absolutely silent, too, since the riot of\nthe machinery drowned every external sound.  Far away was the black\nfence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind, and above was\nthe deep blue sky and the pale little stars.  Azuma-zi suddenly\nwalked across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands\nwere running, and went into the shadow by the big dynamo.  Holroyd\nheard a click, and the spin of the armature changed.\n\n\"What are you dewin' with that switch?\" he bawled in surprise.\n\"Han't I told you--\"\n\nThen he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi's eyes as the\nAsiatic came out of the shadow towards him.\n\nIn another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front\nof the great dynamo.\n\n\"You coffee-headed fool!\" gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at\nhis throat.  \"Keep off those contact rings.\"  In another moment he\nwas tripped and reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos.  He\ninstinctively loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself\nfrom the machine.\n\nThe messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find\nout what had happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the\nporter's lodge by the gate.  Azuma-zi tried to explain something,\nbut the messenger could make nothing of the black's incoherent\nEnglish, and hurried on to the shed.  The machines were all noisily\nat work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged.  There was, however,\na queer smell of singed hair.  Then he saw an odd-looking crumpled\nmass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, and, approaching,\nrecognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.\n\nThe man stared and hesitated a moment.  Then he saw the face,\nand shut his eyes convulsively.  He turned on his heel before he\nopened them, so that he should not see Holroyd again, and went out\nof the shed to get advice and help.\n\nWhen Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo\nhe had been a little scared about the consequences of his act.  Yet\nhe felt strangely elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord\nDynamo was upon him.  His plan was already settled when he met the\nman coming from the station, and the scientific manager who\nspeedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of\nsuicide.  This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a\nfew questions.  Did he see Holroyd kill himself?  Azuma-zi\nexplained that he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until\nhe heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo.  It was not a\ndifficult examination, being untinctured by suspicion.\n\nThe distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician\nremoved from the machine, were hastily covered by the porter with\na coffee-stained tablecloth.  Somebody, by a happy inspiration,\nfetched a medical man.  The expert was chiefly anxious to get the\nmachine at work again, for seven or eight trains had stopped midway\nin the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway.  Azuma-zi, answering\nor misunderstanding the questions of the people who had by\nauthority or impudence come into the shed, was presently sent back\nto the stoke-hole by the scientific manager.  Of course a crowd\ncollected outside the gates of the yard--a crowd, for no known\nreason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden\ndeath in London; two or three reporters percolated somehow into the\nengine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific\nexpert cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.\n\nPresently the body was carried away, and public interest\ndeparted with it. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace,\nseeing over and over again in the coals a figure that wriggled\nviolently and became still.  An hour after the murder, to anyone\ncoming into the shed it would have looked exactly as if nothing had\never happened there.  Peeping presently from his engine-room the\nblack saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl beside his little\nbrothers, and the driving wheels were beating round, and the steam\nin the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been earlier in\nthe evening.  After all, from the mechanical point of view, it had\nbeen a most insignificant incident--the mere temporary deflection\nof a current.  But now the slender form and slender shadow of the\nscientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd\ntravelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor\nunder the straps between the engines and the dynamos.\n\n\"Have I not served my Lord?\" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his\nshadow, and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear.\nAs he looked at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination\nof it that had been a little in abeyance since Holroyd's death,\nresumed its sway.\n\nNever had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and\npitilessly.  The big humming machine had slain its victim without\nwavering for a second from its steady beating.  It was indeed a\nmighty god.\n\nThe unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him,\nscribbling on a piece of paper.  His shadow lay at the foot of the\nmonster.\n\n\"Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry?  His servant was ready.\"\n\nAzuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped.  The\nscientific manager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the\nshed to the endmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the\nbrushes.\n\nAzuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into\nshadow by the switch.  There he waited.  Presently the manager's\nfootsteps could be heard returning.  He stopped in his old\nposition, unconscious of the stoker crouching ten feet away from\nhim.  Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled, and in another moment\nAzuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.\n\nFirst, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and\nswung towards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and\nforcing his antagonist's head down with his hands, he loosened the\ngrip on his waist and swung round away from the machine.  Then the\nblack grasped him again, putting a curly head against his chest,\nand they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so.  Then the\nscientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth\nand bite furiously.  The black yelled hideously.\n\nThey rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had\napparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some\near--the scientific manager wondered which at the time--tried to\nthrottle him.  The scientific manager was making some ineffectual\nattempts to claw something with his hands and to kick, when the\nwelcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor.  The next\nmoment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo.\nThere was a splutter amid the roar.\n\nThe officer of the company who had entered, stood staring as\nAzuma-zi caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible\nconvulsion, and then hung motionless from the machine, his face\nviolently distorted.\n\n\"I'm jolly glad you came in when you did,\" said the scientific\nmanager, still sitting on the floor.\n\nHe looked at the still quivering figure.\n\n\"It's not a nice death to die, apparently--but it is quick.\"\n\nThe official was still staring at the body.  He was a man of\nslow apprehension.\n\nThere was a pause.\n\nThe scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly.\nHe ran his fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his\nhead to and fro several times.\n\n\"Poor Holroyd!  I see now.\"  Then almost mechanically he went\ntowards the switch in the shadow and turned the current into the\nrailway circuit again.  As he did so the singed body loosened its\ngrip upon the machine and fell forward on its face.  The core of\nthe dynamo roared out loud and clear, and the armature beat the\nair.\n\nSo ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps\nthe most short-lived of all religions.  Yet withal it could at\nleast boast a Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND\n\nThree hundred miles and more from Chimborazo, one hundred from the\nsnows of Cotopaxi, in the wildest wastes of Ecuador's Andes, there\nlies that mysterious mountain valley, cut off from all the world of\nmen, the Country of the Blind.  Long years ago that valley lay so\nfar open to the world that men might come at last through frightful\ngorges and over an icy pass into its equable meadows, and thither\nindeed men came, a family or so of Peruvian half-breeds fleeing\nfrom the lust and tyranny of an evil Spanish ruler.  Then came the\nstupendous outbreak of Mindobamba, when it was night in Quito for\nseventeen days, and the water was boiling at Yaguachi and all the\nfish floating dying even as far as Guayaquil; everywhere along the\nPacific slopes there were land-slips and swift thawings and sudden\nfloods, and one whole side of the old Arauca crest slipped and came\ndown in thunder, and cut off the Country of the Blind for ever from\nthe exploring feet of men.  But one of these early settlers had\nchanced to be on the hither side of the gorges when the world had\nso terribly shaken itself, and he perforce had to forget his wife\nand his child and all the friends and possessions he had left up\nthere, and start life over again in the lower world.  He started it\nagain but ill, blindness overtook him, and he died of punishment in\nthe mines; but the story he told begot a legend that lingers along\nthe length of the Cordilleras of the Andes to this day.\n\nHe told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness,\ninto which he had first been carried lashed to a llama, beside a\nvast bale of gear, when he was a child.  The valley, he said, had\nin it all that the heart of man could desire--sweet water, pasture,\nan even climate, slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub\nthat bore an excellent fruit, and on one side great hanging forests\nof pine that held the avalanches high.  Far overhead, on three\nsides, vast cliffs of grey-green rock were capped by cliffs of ice;\nbut the glacier stream came not to them, but flowed away by the\nfarther slopes, and only now and then huge ice masses fell on the\nvalley side.  In this valley it neither rained nor snowed, but the\nabundant springs gave a rich green pasture, that irrigation would\nspread over all the valley space.  The settlers did well indeed\nthere.  Their beasts did well and multiplied, and but one thing\nmarred their happiness.  Yet it was enough to mar it greatly.  A\nstrange disease had come upon them and had made all the children\nborn to them there--and, indeed, several older children\nalso--blind.  It was to seek some charm or antidote against this\nplague of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and\ndifficulty returned down the gorge.  In those days, in such cases,\nmen did not think of germs and infections, but of sins, and it\nseemed to him that the reason of this affliction must he in the\nnegligence of these priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so\nsoon as they entered the valley.  He wanted a shrine--a handsome,\ncheap, effectual shrine--to be erected in the valley; he wanted\nrelics and such-like potent things of faith, blessed objects and\nmysterious medals and prayers.  In his wallet he had a bar of\nnative silver for which he would not account; he insisted there was\nnone in the valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert\nliar.  They had all clubbed their money and ornaments together,\nhaving little need for such treasure up there, he said, to buy them\nholy help against their ill.  I figure this dim-eyed young\nmountaineer, sunburnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat brim clutched\nfeverishly, a man all unused to the ways of the lower world,\ntelling this story to some keen-eyed, attentive priest before the\ngreat convulsion; I can picture him presently seeking to return\nwith pious and infallible remedies against that trouble, and the\ninfinite dismay with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness\nwhere the gorge had once come out.  But the rest of his story of\nmischances is lost to me, save that I know of his evil death after\nseveral years.  Poor stray from that remoteness!  The stream that\nhad once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of a rocky cave,\nand the legend his poor, ill-told story set going developed into\nthe legend of a race of blind men somewhere \"over there\" one may\nstill hear to-day.\n\nAnd amidst the little population of that now isolated and\nforgotten valley the disease ran its course.  The old became\ngroping, the young saw but dimly, and the children that were born\nto them never saw at all.  But life was very easy in that\nsnow-rimmed basin, lost to all the world, with neither thorns nor\nbriers, with no evil insects nor any beasts save the gentle breed\nof llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of\nthe shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had come.  The\nseeing had become purblind so gradually that they scarcely noticed\ntheir loss.  They guided the sightless youngsters hither and\nthither until they knew the whole valley marvellously, and when at\nlast sight died out among them the race lived on.  They had even\ntime to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire, which they\nmade carefully in stoves of stone.  They were a simple strain of\npeople at the first, unlettered, only slightly touched with the\nSpanish civilisation, but with something of a tradition of the arts\nof old Peru and of its lost philosophy.  Generation followed\ngeneration.  They forgot many things; they devised many things.\nTheir tradition of the greater world they came from became mythical\nin colour and uncertain.  In all things save sight they were strong\nand able, and presently chance sent one who had an original mind\nand who could talk and persuade among them, and then afterwards\nanother.  These two passed, leaving their effects, and the little\ncommunity grew in numbers and in understanding, and met and settled\nsocial and economic problems that arose.  Generation followed\ngeneration.  Generation followed generation.  There came a time\nwhen a child was born who was fifteen generations from that\nancestor who went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek\nGod's aid, and who never returned.  Thereabout it chanced that a\nman came into this community from the outer world.  And this is the\nstory of that man.\n\nHe was a mountaineer from the country near Quito, a man who\nhad been down to the sea and had seen the world, a reader of books\nin an original way, an acute and enterprising man, and he was taken\non by a party of Englishmen who had come out to Ecuador to climb\nmountains, to replace one of their three Swiss guides who had\nfallen ill.  He climbed here and he climbed there, and then came\nthe attempt on Parascotopetl, the Matterhorn of the Andes, in which\nhe was lost to the outer world.  The story of that accident has\nbeen written a dozen times.  Pointer's narrative is the best.  He\ntells how the little party worked their difficult and almost\nvertical way up to the very foot of the last and greatest\nprecipice, and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow upon\na little shelf of rock, and, with a touch of real dramatic power,\nhow presently they found Nunez had gone from them.  They shouted,\nand there was no reply; shouted and whistled, and for the rest of\nthat night they slept no more.\n\nAs the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall.  It\nseems impossible he could have uttered a sound.  He had slipped\neastward towards the unknown side of the mountain; far below he had\nstruck a steep slope of snow, and ploughed his way down it in the\nmidst of a snow avalanche.  His track went straight to the edge of\na frightful precipice, and beyond that everything was hidden.  Far,\nfar below, and hazy with distance, they could see trees rising out\nof a narrow, shut-in valley--the lost Country of the Blind.  But\nthey did not know it was the lost Country of the Blind, nor\ndistinguish it in any way from any other narrow streak of upland\nvalley.  Unnerved by this disaster, they abandoned their attempt in\nthe afternoon, and Pointer was called away to the war before he\ncould make another attack.  To this day Parascotopetl lifts an\nunconquered crest, and Pointer's shelter crumbles unvisited amidst\nthe snows.\n\nAnd the man who fell survived.\n\nAt the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet, and came down\nin the midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow-slope even steeper than\nthe one above.  Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible,\nbut without a bone broken in his body; and then at last came to\ngentler slopes, and at last rolled out and lay still, buried amidst\na softening heap of the white masses that had accompanied and saved\nhim.  He came to himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed;\nthen realized his position with a mountaineer's intelligence and\nworked himself loose and, after a rest or so, out until he saw the\nstars.  He rested flat upon his chest for a space, wondering where\nhe was and what had happened to him.  He explored his limbs, and\ndiscovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat\nturned over his head.  His knife had gone from his pocket and his\nhat was lost, though he had tied it under his chin.  He recalled\nthat he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the\nshelter wall.  His ice-axe had disappeared.\n\nHe decided he must have fallen, and looked up to see,\nexaggerated by the ghastly light of the rising moon, the tremendous\nflight he had taken.  For a while he lay, gazing blankly at the\nvast, pale cliff towering above, rising moment by moment out of a\nsubsiding tide of darkness.  Its phantasmal, mysterious beauty held\nhim for a space, and then he was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing\nlaughter . . . .\n\nAfter a great interval of time he became aware that he was\nnear the lower edge of the snow.  Below, down what was now a\nmoon-lit and practicable slope, he saw the dark and broken\nappearance of rock-strewn turf He struggled to his feet, aching in\nevery joint and limb, got down painfully from the heaped loose snow\nabout him, went downward until he was on the turf, and there\ndropped rather than lay beside a boulder, drank deep from the flask\nin his inner pocket, and instantly fell asleep . . . .\n\nHe was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far\nbelow.\n\nHe sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of\na vast precipice that sloped only a little in the gully down which\nhe and his snow had come.  Over against him another wall of rock\nreared itself against the sky.  The gorge between these precipices\nran east and west and was full of the morning sunlight, which lit\nto the westward the mass of fallen mountain that closed the\ndescending gorge.  Below him it seemed there was a precipice\nequally steep, but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort of\nchimney-cleft dripping with snow-water, down which a desperate man\nmight venture.  He found it easier than it seemed, and came at last\nto another desolate alp, and then after a rock climb of no\nparticular difficulty, to a steep slope of trees.  He took his\nbearings and turned his face up the gorge, for he saw it opened out\nabove upon green meadows, among which he now glimpsed quite\ndistinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion.  At times\nhis progress was like clambering along the face of a wall, and\nafter a time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge, the\nvoices of the singing birds died away, and the air grew cold and\ndark about him.  But the distant valley with its houses was all the\nbrighter for that.  He came presently to talus, and among the rocks\nhe noted--for he was an observant man--an unfamiliar fern that\nseemed to clutch out of the crevices with intense green hands.  He\npicked a frond or so and gnawed its stalk, and found it helpful.\n\nAbout midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge\ninto the plain and the sunlight.  He was stiff and weary; he sat\ndown in the shadow of a rock, filled up his flask with water from\na spring and drank it down, and remained for a time, resting before\nhe went on to the houses.\n\nThey were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the whole\naspect of that valley became, as he regarded it, queerer and more\nunfamiliar.  The greater part of its surface was lush green meadow,\nstarred with many beautiful flowers, irrigated with extraordinary\ncare, and bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece.\nHigh up and ringing the valley about was a wall, and what appeared\nto be a circumferential water channel, from which the little\ntrickles of water that fed the meadow plants came, and on the\nhigher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty\nherbage.  Sheds, apparently shelters or feeding-places for the\nllamas, stood against the boundary wall here and there.  The\nirrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the centre\nof the valley, and this was enclosed on either side by a wall\nbreast high.  This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded\nplace, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a\nnumber of paths paved with black and white stones, and each with a\ncurious little kerb at the side, ran hither and thither in an\norderly manner.  The houses of the central village were quite\nunlike the casual and higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the\nmountain villages he knew; they stood in a continuous row on\neither side of a central street of astonishing cleanness, here\nand there their parti-coloured facade was pierced by a door,\nand not a solitary window broke their even frontage.  They were\nparti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity, smeared with a sort\nof plaster that was sometimes grey, sometimes drab, sometimes\nslate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild\nplastering first brought the word \"blind\" into the thoughts of the\nexplorer.  \"The good man who did that,\" he thought, \"must have been\nas blind as a bat.\"\n\nHe descended a steep place, and so came to the wall and\nchannel that ran about the valley, near where the latter spouted\nout its surplus contents into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and\nwavering thread of cascade.  He could now see a number of men and\nwomen resting on piled heaps of grass, as if taking a siesta, in\nthe remoter part of the meadow, and nearer the village a number of\nrecumbent children, and then nearer at hand three men carrying\npails on yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling\nwall towards the houses.  These latter were clad in garments of\nllama cloth and boots and belts of leather, and they wore caps of\ncloth with back and ear flaps.  They followed one another in single\nfile, walking slowly and yawning as they walked, like men who have\nbeen up all night.  There was something so reassuringly prosperous\nand respectable in their bearing that after a moment's hesitation\nNunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock, and\ngave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley.\n\nThe three men stopped, and moved their heads as though they\nwere looking about them.  They turned their faces this way and\nthat, and Nunez gesticulated with freedom.  But they did not appear\nto see him for all his gestures, and after a time, directing\nthemselves towards the mountains far away to the right, they\nshouted as if in answer.  Nunez bawled again, and then once more,\nand as he gestured ineffectually the word \"blind\" came up to the\ntop of his thoughts.  \"The fools must be blind,\" he said.\n\nWhen at last, after much shouting and wrath, Nunez crossed the\nstream by a little bridge, came through a gate in the wall, and\napproached them, he was sure that they were blind.  He was sure\nthat this was the Country of the Blind of which the legends told.\nConviction had sprung upon him, and a sense of great and rather\nenviable adventure.  The three stood side by side, not looking at\nhim, but with their ears directed towards him, judging him by his\nunfamiliar steps.  They stood close together like men a little\nafraid, and he could see their eyelids closed and sunken, as though\nthe very balls beneath had shrunk away.  There was an expression\nnear awe on their faces.\n\n\"A man,\" one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish.  \"A man it\nis--a man or a spirit--coming down from the rocks.\"\n\nBut Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who\nenters upon life.  All the old stories of the lost valley and the\nCountry of the Blind had come back to his mind, and through his\nthoughts ran this old proverb, as if it were a refrain:--\n\n\"In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.\"\n\n\"In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.\"\n\nAnd very civilly he gave them greeting.  He talked to them and\nused his eyes.\n\n\"Where does he come from, brother Pedro?\" asked one.\n\n\"Down out of the rocks.\"\n\n\"Over the mountains I come,\" said Nunez, \"out of the country\nbeyond there--where men can see.  From near Bogota--where there are\na hundred thousands of people, and where the city passes out of\nsight.\"\n\n\"Sight?\" muttered Pedro.  \"Sight?\"\n\n\"He comes,\" said the second blind man, \"out of the rocks.\"\n\nThe cloth of their coats, Nunez saw was curious fashioned,\neach with a different sort of stitching.\n\nThey startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him, each\nwith a hand outstretched.  He stepped back from the advance of\nthese spread fingers.\n\n\"Come hither,\" said the third blind man, following his motion\nand clutching him neatly.\n\nAnd they held Nunez and felt him over, saying no word further\nuntil they had done so.\n\n\"Carefully,\" he cried, with a finger in his eye, and found\nthey thought that organ, with its fluttering lids, a queer thing in\nhim.  They went over it again.\n\n\"A strange creature, Correa,\" said the one called Pedro.\n\"Feel the coarseness of his hair.  Like a llama's hair.\"\n\n\"Rough he is as the rocks that begot him,\" said Correa,\ninvestigating Nunez's unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist\nhand.  \"Perhaps he will grow finer.\"\n\nNunez struggled a little under their examination, but they\ngripped him firm.\n\n\"Carefully,\" he said again.\n\n\"He speaks,\" said the third man.  \"Certainly he is a man.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" said Pedro, at the roughness of his coat.\n\n\"And you have come into the world?\" asked Pedro.\n\n\"_Out_ of the world.  Over mountains and glaciers; right\nover above there, half-way to the sun.  Out of the great, big world\nthat goes down, twelve days' journey to the sea.\"\n\nThey scarcely seemed to heed him.  \"Our fathers have told us\nmen may be made by the forces of Nature,\" said Correa.  \"It is the\nwarmth of things, and moisture, and rottenness--rottenness.\"\n\n\"Let us lead him to the elders,\" said Pedro.\n\n\"Shout first,\" said Correa, \"lest the children be afraid.\nThis is a marvellous occasion.\"\n\nSo they shouted, and Pedro went first and took Nunez by the\nhand to lead him to the houses.\n\nHe drew his hand away.  \"I can see,\" he said.\n\n\"See?\" said Correa.\n\n\"Yes; see,\" said Nunez, turning towards him, and stumbled\nagainst Pedro's pail.\n\n\"His senses are still imperfect,\" said the third blind man.\n\"He stumbles, and talks unmeaning words.  Lead him by the hand.\"\n\n\"As you will,\" said Nunez, and was led along laughing.\n\nIt seemed they knew nothing of sight.\n\nWell, all in good time he would teach them.\n\nHe heard people shouting, and saw a number of figures\ngathering together in the middle roadway of the village.\n\nHe found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had\nanticipated, that first encounter with the population of the\nCountry of the Blind.  The place seemed larger as he drew near to\nit, and the smeared plasterings queerer, and a crowd of children\nand men and women (the women and girls he was pleased to note had,\nsome of them, quite sweet faces, for all that their eyes were shut\nand sunken) came about him, holding on to him, touching him with\nsoft, sensitive hands, smelling at him, and listening at every\nword he spoke.  Some of the maidens and children, however, kept\naloof as if afraid, and indeed his voice seemed coarse and rude\nbeside their softer notes.  They mobbed him.  His three guides kept\nclose to him with an effect of proprietorship, and said again and\nagain, \"A wild man out of the rocks.\"\n\n\"Bogota,\" he said.  \"Bogota.  Over the mountain crests.\"\n\n\"A wild man--using wild words,\" said Pedro.  \"Did you hear\nthat--\n\n\"_Bogota?_  His mind has hardly formed yet.  He has only\nthe beginnings of speech.\"\n\nA little boy nipped his hand.  \"Bogota!\" he said mockingly.\n\n\"Aye!  A city to your village.  I come from the great world--where\nmen have eyes and see.\"\n\n\"His name's Bogota,\" they said.\n\n\"He stumbled,\" said Correa--\"stumbled twice as we came\nhither.\"\n\n\"Bring him in to the elders.\"\n\nAnd they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as\nblack as pitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire.  The\ncrowd closed in behind him and shut out all but the faintest\nglimmer of day, and before he could arrest himself he had fallen\nheadlong over the feet of a seated man.  His arm, outflung, struck\nthe face of someone else as he went down; he felt the soft impact\nof features and heard a cry of anger, and for a moment he struggled\nagainst a number of hands that clutched him.  It was a one-sided\nfight.  An inkling of the situation came to him and he lay quiet.\n\n\"I fell down,\" he said; \"I couldn't see in this pitchy\ndarkness.\"\n\nThere was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to\nunderstand his words.  Then the voice of Correa said: \"He is but\nnewly formed.  He stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean\nnothing with his speech.\"\n\nOthers also said things about him that he heard or understood\nimperfectly.\n\n\"May I sit up?\" he asked, in a pause.  \"I will not struggle\nagainst you again.\"\n\nThey consulted and let him rise.\n\nThe voice of an older man began to question him, and Nunez\nfound himself trying to explain the great world out of which he had\nfallen, and the sky and mountains and such-like marvels, to these\nelders who sat in darkness in the Country of the Blind.  And they\nwould believe and understand nothing whatever that he told them, a\nthing quite outside his expectation.  They would not even\nunderstand many of his words.  For fourteen generations these\npeople had been blind and cut off from all the seeing world; the\nnames for all the things of sight had faded and changed; the story\nof the outer world was faded and changed to a child's story; and\nthey had ceased to concern themselves with anything beyond the\nrocky slopes above their circling wall.  Blind men of genius had\narisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition\nthey had brought with them from their seeing days, and had\ndismissed all these things as idle fancies and replaced them with\nnew and saner explanations.  Much of their imagination had\nshrivelled with their eyes, and they had made for themselves new\nimaginations with their ever more sensitive ears and finger-tips.\nSlowly Nunez realised this: that his expectation of wonder and\nreverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out; and\nafter his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set aside\nas the confused version of a new-made being describing the marvels\nof his incoherent sensations, he subsided, a little dashed, into\nlistening to their instruction.  And the eldest of the blind men\nexplained to him life and philosophy and religion, how that the\nworld (meaning their valley) had been first an empty hollow in the\nrocks, and then had come first inanimate things without the gift of\ntouch, and llamas and a few other creatures that had little sense,\nand then men, and at last angels, whom one could hear singing and\nmaking fluttering sounds, but whom no one could touch at all, which\npuzzled Nunez greatly until he thought of the birds.\n\nHe went on to tell Nunez how this time had been divided into\nthe warm and the cold, which are the blind equivalents of day and\nnight, and how it was good to sleep in the warm and work during the\ncold, so that now, but for his advent, the whole town of the blind\nwould have been asleep.  He said Nunez must have been specially\ncreated to learn and serve the wisdom they had acquired, and that\nfor all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have\ncourage and do his best to learn, and at that all the people in the\ndoor-way murmured encouragingly.  He said the night--for the blind\ncall their day night--was now far gone, and it behooved everyone to\ngo back to sleep.  He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and\nNunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food.  They\nbrought him food, llama's milk in a bowl and rough salted bread,\nand led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing, and\nafterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening\nroused them to begin their day again.  But Nunez slumbered not at\nall.\n\nInstead, he sat up in the place where they had left him,\nresting his limbs and turning the unanticipated circumstances of\nhis arrival over and over in his mind.\n\nEvery now and then he laughed, sometimes with amusement and\nsometimes with indignation.\n\n\"Unformed mind!\" he said.  \"Got no senses yet!  They little\nknow they've been insulting their Heaven-sent King and master . .\n. . .\n\n\"I see I must bring them to reason.\n\n\"Let me think.\n\n\"Let me think.\"\n\nHe was still thinking when the sun set.\n\nNunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it seemed to\nhim that the glow upon the snow-fields and glaciers that rose about\nthe valley on every side was the most beautiful thing he had ever\nseen.  His eyes went from that inaccessible glory to the village\nand irrigated fields, fast sinking into the twilight, and suddenly\na wave of emotion took him, and he thanked God from the bottom of\nhis heart that the power of sight had been given him.\n\nHe heard a voice calling to him from out of the village.\n\n\"Yaho there, Bogota!  Come hither!\"\n\nAt that he stood up, smiling.  He would show these people once\nand for all what sight would do for a man.  They would seek him,\nbut not find him.\n\n\"You move not, Bogota,\" said the voice.\n\nHe laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from\nthe path.\n\n\"Trample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not allowed.\"\n\nNunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself.  He\nstopped, amazed.\n\nThe owner of the voice came running up the piebald path\ntowards him.\n\nHe stepped back into the pathway.  \"Here I am,\" he said.\n\n\"Why did you not come when I called you?\" said the blind man.\n\"Must you be led like a child?  Cannot you hear the path as you\nwalk?\"\n\nNunez laughed.  \"I can see it,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no such word as _see_,\" said the blind man,\nafter a pause.  \"Cease this folly and follow the sound of my feet.\"\n\nNunez followed, a little annoyed.\n\n\"My time will come,\" he said.\n\n\"You'll learn,\" the blind man answered.  \"There is much to\nlearn in the world.\"\n\n\"Has no one told you, 'In the Country of the Blind the\nOne-Eyed Man is King?'\"\n\n\"What is blind?\" asked the blind man, carelessly, over his\nshoulder.\n\nFour days passed and the fifth found the King of the Blind\nstill incognito, as a clumsy and useless stranger among his\nsubjects.\n\nIt was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim himself than\nhe had supposed, and in the meantime, while he meditated his\n_coup d'etat_, he did what he was told and learnt the manners\nand customs of the Country of the Blind.  He found working and\ngoing about at night a particularly irksome thing, and he decided\nthat that should be the first thing he would change.\n\nThey led a simple, laborious life, these people, with all the\nelements of virtue and happiness as these things can be understood\nby men.  They toiled, but not oppressively; they had food and\nclothing sufficient for their needs; they had days and seasons of\nrest; they made much of music and singing, and there was love among\nthem and little children.  It was marvellous with what confidence\nand precision they went about their ordered world.  Everything, you\nsee, had been made to fit their needs; each of the radiating paths\nof the valley area had a constant angle to the others, and was\ndistinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing; all obstacles\nand irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared\naway; all their methods and procedure arose naturally from their\nspecial needs.  Their senses had become marvellously acute; they\ncould hear and judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces\naway--could hear the very beating of his heart.  Intonation had\nlong replaced expression with them, and touches gesture, and their\nwork with hoe and spade and fork was as free and confident as\ngarden work can be.  Their sense of smell was extraordinarily fine;\nthey could distinguish individual differences as readily as a dog\ncan, and they went about the tending of llamas, who lived among\nthe rocks above and came to the wall for food and shelter, with\nease and confidence.  It was only when at last Nunez sought to\nassert himself that he found how easy and confident their movements\ncould be.\n\nHe rebelled only after he had tried persuasion.\n\nHe tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight.\n\"Look you here, you people,\" he said.  \"There are things you do not\nunderstand in me.\"\n\nOnce or twice one or two of them attended to him; they sat\nwith faces downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him, and\nhe did his best to tell them what it was to see.  Among his hearers\nwas a girl, with eyelids less red and sunken than the others, so\nthat one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes, whom especially he\nhoped to persuade.  He spoke of the beauties of sight, of watching\nthe mountains, of the sky and the sunrise, and they heard him with\namused incredulity that presently became condemnatory.  They told\nhim there were indeed no mountains at all, but that the end of the\nrocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world;\nthence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe, from which the dew\nand the avalanches fell; and when he maintained stoutly the world\nhad neither end nor roof such as they supposed, they said his\nthoughts were wicked.  So far as he could describe sky and clouds\nand stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void, a terrible\nblankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in which they\nbelieved--it was an article of faith with them that the cavern roof\nwas exquisitely smooth to the touch.  He saw that in some manner he\nshocked them, and gave up that aspect of the matter altogether, and\ntried to show them the practical value of sight.  One morning he\nsaw Pedro in the path called Seventeen and coming towards the\ncentral houses, but still too far off for hearing or scent, and he\ntold them as much.  \"In a little while,\" he prophesied, \"Pedro will\nbe here.\"  An old man remarked that Pedro had no business on path\nSeventeen, and then, as if in confirmation, that individual as he\ndrew near turned and went transversely into path Ten, and so back\nwith nimble paces towards the outer wall.  They mocked Nunez when\nPedro did not arrive, and afterwards, when he asked Pedro questions\nto clear his character, Pedro denied and outfaced him, and was\nafterwards hostile to him.\n\nThen he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping\nmeadows towards the wall with one complaisant individual, and to\nhim he promised to describe all that happened among the houses.  He\nnoted certain goings and comings, but the things that really seemed\nto signify to these people happened inside of or behind the\nwindowless houses--the only things they took note of to test him\nby--and of those he could see or tell nothing; and it was after the\nfailure of this attempt, and the ridicule they could not repress,\nthat he resorted to force.  He thought of seizing a spade and\nsuddenly smiting one or two of them to earth, and so in fair combat\nshowing the advantage of eyes.  He went so far with that resolution\nas to seize his spade, and then he discovered a new thing about\nhimself, and that was that it was impossible for him to hit a blind\nman in cold blood.\n\nHe hesitated, and found them all aware that he had snatched up\nthe spade.  They stood all alert, with their heads on one side, and\nbent ears towards him for what he would do next.\n\n\"Put that spade down,\" said one, and he felt a sort of\nhelpless horror.  He came near obedience.\n\nThen he had thrust one backwards against a house wall, and\nfled past him and out of the village.\n\nHe went athwart one of their meadows, leaving a track of\ntrampled grass behind his feet, and presently sat down by the side\nof one of their ways.  He felt something of the buoyancy that comes\nto all men in the beginning of a fight, but more perplexity.  He\nbegan to realise that you cannot even fight happily with creatures\nwho stand upon a different mental basis to yourself.  Far away he\nsaw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come out of the\nstreet of houses and advance in a spreading line along the several\npaths towards him.  They advanced slowly, speaking frequently to\none another, and ever and again the whole cordon would halt and\nsniff the air and listen.\n\nThe first time they did this Nunez laughed.  But afterwards he\ndid not laugh.\n\nOne struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and\nfeeling his way along it.\n\nFor five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon,\nand then his vague disposition to do something forthwith\nbecame frantic.  He stood up, went a pace or so towards the\ncircumferential wall, turned, and went back a little way.  There\nthey all stood in a crescent, still and listening.\n\nHe also stood still, gripping his spade very tightly in both\nhands.  Should he charge them?\n\nThe pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of \"In the Country\nof the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.\"\n\nShould he charge them?\n\nHe looked back at the high and unclimbable wall\nbehind--unclimbable because of its smooth plastering, but withal\npierced with many little doors and at the approaching line of\nseekers.  Behind these others were now coming out of the street of\nhouses.\n\nShould he charge them?\n\n\"Bogota!\" called one.  \"Bogota! where are you?\"\n\nHe gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the\nmeadows towards the place of habitations, and directly he moved\nthey converged upon him.  \"I'll hit them if they touch me,\" he\nswore; \"by Heaven, I will.  I'll hit.\"  He called aloud, \"Look\nhere, I'm going to do what I like in this valley!  Do you hear?\nI'm going to do what I like and go where I like.\"\n\nThey were moving in upon him quickly, groping, yet moving\nrapidly.  It was like playing blind man's buff with everyone\nblindfolded except one.  \"Get hold of him!\" cried one.  He found\nhimself in the arc of a loose curve of pursuers.  He felt suddenly\nhe must be active and resolute.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" he cried, in a voice that was meant to\nbe great and resolute, and which broke.  \"You are blind and I can\nsee.  Leave me alone!\"\n\n\"Bogota!  Put down that spade and come off the grass!\"\n\nThe last order, grotesque in its urban familiarity, produced\na gust of anger.  \"I'll hurt you,\" he said, sobbing with emotion.\n\"By Heaven, I'll hurt you!  Leave me alone!\"\n\nHe began to run--not knowing clearly where to run.  He ran\nfrom the nearest blind man, because it was a horror to hit him.  He\nstopped, and then made a dash to escape from their closing ranks.\nHe made for where a gap was wide, and the men on either side, with\na quick perception of the approach of his paces, rushed in on one\nanother.  He sprang forward, and then saw he must be caught, and\n_swish!_ the spade had struck.  He felt the soft thud of hand\nand arm, and the man was down with a yell of pain, and he was\nthrough.\n\nThrough!  And then he was close to the street of houses again,\nand blind men, whirling spades and stakes, were running with a\nreasoned swiftness hither and thither.\n\nHe heard steps behind him just in time, and found a tall man\nrushing forward and swiping at the sound of him.  He lost his\nnerve, hurled his spade a yard wide of this antagonist, and whirled\nabout and fled, fairly yelling as he dodged another.\n\nHe was panic-stricken.  He ran furiously to and fro, dodging\nwhen there was no need to dodge, and, in his anxiety to see on\nevery side of him at once, stumbling.  For a moment he was down and\nthey heard his fall.  Far away in the circumferential wall a little\ndoorway looked like Heaven, and he set off in a wild rush for it.\nHe did not even look round at his pursuers until it was gained, and\nhe had stumbled across the bridge, clambered a little way among the\nrocks, to the surprise and dismay of a young llama, who went\nleaping out of sight, and lay down sobbing for breath.\n\nAnd so his _coup d'etat_ came to an end.\n\nHe stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two\nnights and days without food or shelter, and meditated upon the\nUnexpected.  During these meditations he repeated very frequently\nand always with a profounder note of derision the exploded proverb:\n\"In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.\"  He thought\nchiefly of ways of fighting and conquering these people, and it\ngrew clear that for him no practicable way was possible.  He had no\nweapons, and now it would be hard to get one.\n\nThe canker of civilisation had got to him even in Bogota, and\nhe could not find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind\nman.  Of course, if he did that, he might then dictate terms on the\nthreat of assassinating them all.  But--Sooner or later he must\nsleep! . . . .\n\nHe tried also to find food among the pine trees, to be comfortable\nunder pine boughs while the frost fell at night, and--with\nless confidence--to catch a llama by artifice in order to try\nto kill it--perhaps by hammering it with a stone--and so finally,\nperhaps, to eat some of it.  But the llamas had a doubt of him and\nregarded him with distrustful brown eyes and spat when he drew\nnear.  Fear came on him the second day and fits of shivering.\nFinally he crawled down to the wall of the Country of the Blind and\ntried to make his terms.  He crawled along by the stream, shouting,\nuntil two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him.\n\n\"I was mad,\" he said.  \"But I was only newly made.\"\n\nThey said that was better.\n\nHe told them he was wiser now, and repented of all he had\ndone.\n\n\nThen he wept without intention, for he was very weak and ill\nnow, and they took that as a favourable sign.\n\nThey asked him if he still thought he could \"_see_.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.  \"That was folly.  The word means nothing.\nLess than nothing!\"\n\nThey asked him what was overhead.\n\n\"About ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above\nthe world--of rock--and very, very smooth.  So smooth--so\nbeautifully smooth . .\" He burst again into hysterical tears.\n\"Before you ask me any more, give me some food or I shall die!\"\n\nHe expected dire punishments, but these blind people were\ncapable of toleration.  They regarded his rebellion as but one more\nproof of his general idiocy and inferiority, and after they had\nwhipped him they appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work\nthey had for anyone to do, and he, seeing no other way of living,\ndid submissively what he was told.\n\nHe was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly.  That\nrefined his submission.  But they insisted on his lying in the\ndark, and that was a great misery.  And blind philosophers came and\ntalked to him of the wicked levity of his mind, and reproved him so\nimpressively for his doubts about the lid of rock that covered\ntheir cosmic _casserole_ that he almost doubted whether indeed\nhe was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it overhead.\n\nSo Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the Blind, and\nthese people ceased to be a generalised people and became\nindividualities to him, and familiar to him, while the world beyond\nthe mountains became more and more remote and unreal.  There was\nYacob, his master, a kindly man when not annoyed; there was Pedro,\nYacob's nephew; and there was Medina-sarote, who was the youngest\ndaughter of Yacob.  She was little esteemed in the world of the\nblind, because she had a clear-cut face and lacked that satisfying,\nglossy smoothness that is the blind man's ideal of feminine beauty,\nbut Nunez thought her beautiful at first, and presently the most\nbeautiful thing in the whole creation.  Her closed eyelids were\nnot sunken and red after the common way of the valley, but lay as\nthough they might open again at any moment; and she had long\neyelashes, which were considered a grave disfigurement.  And her\nvoice was weak and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley\nswains.  So that she had no lover.\n\nThere came a time when Nunez thought that, could he win her,\nhe would be resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his\ndays.\n\nHe watched her; he sought opportunities of doing her little\nservices and presently he found that she observed him.  Once at a\nrest-day gathering they sat side by side in the dim starlight, and\nthe music was sweet.  His hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp\nit.  Then very tenderly she returned his pressure.  And one day, as\nthey were at their meal in the darkness, he felt her hand very\nsoftly seeking him, and as it chanced the fire leapt then, and he\nsaw the tenderness of her face.\n\nHe sought to speak to her.\n\nHe went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer\nmoonlight spinning.  The light made her a thing of silver and\nmystery.  He sat down at her feet and told her he loved her, and\ntold her how beautiful she seemed to him.  He had a lover's voice,\nhe spoke with a tender reverence that came near to awe, and she had\nnever before been touched by adoration.  She made him no definite\nanswer, but it was clear his words pleased her.\n\nAfter that he talked to her whenever he could take an\nopportunity.  The valley became the world for him, and the world\nbeyond the mountains where men lived by day seemed no more than a\nfairy tale he would some day pour into her ears.  Very tentatively\nand timidly he spoke to her of sight.\n\nSight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she\nlistened to his description of the stars and the mountains and her\nown sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence.\nShe did not believe, she could only half understand, but she was\nmysteriously delighted, and it seemed to him that she completely\nunderstood.\n\nHis love lost its awe and took courage.  Presently he was for\ndemanding her of Yacob and the elders in marriage, but she became\nfearful and delayed.  And it was one of her elder sisters who first\ntold Yacob that Medina-sarote and Nunez were in love.\n\nThere was from the first very great opposition to the marriage\nof Nunez and Medina-sarote; not so much because they valued her as\nbecause they held him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing\nbelow the permissible level of a man.  Her sisters opposed it\nbitterly as bringing discredit on them all; and old Yacob, though\nhe had formed a sort of liking for his clumsy, obedient serf, shook\nhis head and said the thing could not be.  The young men were all\nangry at the idea of corrupting the race, and one went so far as to\nrevile and strike Nunez.  He struck back.  Then for the first time\nhe found an advantage in seeing, even by twilight, and after that\nfight was over no one was disposed to raise a hand against him.\nBut they still found his marriage impossible.\n\nOld Yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter, and\nwas grieved to have her weep upon his shoulder.\n\n\"You see, my dear, he's an idiot.  He has delusions; he can't\ndo anything right.\"\n\n\"I know,\" wept Medina-sarote.  \"But he's better than he was.\nHe's getting better.  And he's strong, dear father, and\nkind--stronger and kinder than any other man in the world.  And he\nloves me--and, father, I love him.\"\n\nOld Yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable,\nand, besides--what made it more distressing--he liked Nunez for\nmany things.  So he went and sat in the windowless council-chamber\nwith the other elders and watched the trend of the talk, and said,\nat the proper time, \"He's better than he was.  Very likely, some\nday, we shall find him as sane as ourselves.\"\n\nThen afterwards one of the elders, who thought deeply, had\nan idea.  He was a great doctor among these people, their\nmedicine-man, and he had a very philosophical and inventive mind,\nand the idea of curing Nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him.\nOne day when Yacob was present he returned to the topic of Nunez.\n\"I have examined Nunez,\" he said, \"and the case is clearer to me.\nI think very probably he might be cured.\"\n\n\"This is what I have always hoped,\" said old Yacob.\n\n\"His brain is affected,\" said the blind doctor.\n\nThe elders murmured assent.\n\n\"Now, _what_ affects it?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said old Yacob.\n\n\"_This_,\" said the doctor, answering his own question.  \"Those\nqueer things that are called the eyes, and which exist to make\nan agreeable depression in the face, are diseased, in the case\nof Nunez, in such a way as to affect his brain.  They are greatly\ndistended, he has eyelashes, and his eyelids move, and consequently\nhis brain is in a state of constant irritation and distraction.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said old Yacob.  \"Yes?\"\n\n\"And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in\norder to cure him complete, all that we need to do is a simple and\neasy surgical operation--namely, to remove these irritant bodies.\"\n\n\"And then he will be sane?\"\n\n\"Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable\ncitizen.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven for science!\" said old Yacob, and went forth at\nonce to tell Nunez of his happy hopes.\n\nBut Nunez's manner of receiving the good news struck him as\nbeing cold and disappointing.\n\n\"One might think,\" he said, \"from the tone you take that you\ndid not care for my daughter.\"\n\nIt was Medina-sarote who persuaded Nunez to face the blind\nsurgeons.\n\n\"_You_ do not want me,\" he said, \"to lose my gift of sight?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"My world is sight.\"\n\nHer head drooped lower.\n\n\"There are the beautiful things, the beautiful little\nthings--the flowers, the lichens amidst the rocks, the light and\nsoftness on a piece of fur, the far sky with its drifting dawn of\nclouds, the sunsets and the stars.  And there is _you_.  For\nyou alone it is good to have sight, to see your sweet, serene face,\nyour kindly lips, your dear, beautiful hands folded together. . . . .\nIt is these eyes of mine you won, these eyes that hold me to\nyou, that these idiots seek.  Instead, I must touch you, hear you,\nand never see you again.  I must come under that roof of rock and\nstone and darkness, that horrible roof under which your\nimaginations stoop . . . _No_; _you_ would not have me do that?\"\n\nA disagreeable doubt had arisen in him.  He stopped and left\nthe thing a question.\n\n\"I wish,\" she said, \"sometimes--\" She paused.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said, a little apprehensively.\n\n\"I wish sometimes--you would not talk like that.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"I know it's pretty--it's your imagination.  I love it, but _now_--\"\n\nHe felt cold.  \"_Now?_\" he said, faintly.\n\nShe sat quite still.\n\n\"You mean--you think--I should be better, better perhaps--\"\n\nHe was realising things very swiftly.  He felt anger perhaps,\nanger at the dull course of fate, but also sympathy for her lack of\nunderstanding--a sympathy near akin to pity.\n\n\"_Dear_,\" he said, and he could see by her whiteness how\ntensely her spirit pressed against the things she could not say.\nHe put his arms about her, he kissed her ear, and they sat for a\ntime in silence.\n\n\"If I were to consent to this?\" he said at last, in a voice\nthat was very gentle.\n\nShe flung her arms about him, weeping wildly.  \"Oh, if you\nwould,\" she sobbed, \"if only you would!\"\n\nFor a week before the operation that was to raise him from his\nservitude and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen Nunez\nknew nothing of sleep, and all through the warm, sunlit hours,\nwhile the others slumbered happily, he sat brooding or wandered\naimlessly, trying to bring his mind to bear on his dilemma.  He had\ngiven his answer, he had given his consent, and still he was not\nsure.  And at last work-time was over, the sun rose in splendour\nover the golden crests, and his last day of vision began for him.\nHe had a few minutes with Medina-sarote before she went apart to\nsleep.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" he said, \"I shall see no more.\"\n\n\"Dear heart!\" she answered, and pressed his hands with all her\nstrength.\n\n\"They will hurt you but little,\" she said; \"and you are going\nthrough this pain, you are going through it, dear lover, for\n_me_ . . . . Dear, if a woman's heart and life can do it, I\nwill repay you.  My dearest one, my dearest with the tender voice,\nI will repay.\"\n\nHe was drenched in pity for himself and her.\n\nHe held her in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers and\nlooked on her sweet face for the last time.  \"Good-bye!\" he\nwhispered to that dear sight, \"good-bye!\"\n\nAnd then in silence he turned away from her.\n\nShe could hear his slow retreating footsteps, and something in\nthe rhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping.\n\nHe walked away.\n\nHe had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows\nwere beautiful with white narcissus, and there remain until the\nhour of his sacrifice should come, but as he walked he lifted up\nhis eyes and saw the morning, the morning like an angel in golden\narmour, marching down the steeps . . . .\n\nIt seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind\nworld in the valley, and his love and all, were no more than a pit\nof sin.\n\nHe did not turn aside as he had meant to do, but went on and\npassed through the wall of the circumference and out upon the\nrocks, and his eyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow.\n\nHe saw their infinite beauty, and his imagination soared over\nthem to the things beyond he was now to resign for ever!\n\nHe thought of that great free world that he was parted from,\nthe world that was his own, and he had a vision of those further\nslopes, distance beyond distance, with Bogota, a place of\nmultitudinous stirring beauty, a glory by day, a luminous mystery\nby night, a place of palaces and fountains and statues and white\nhouses, lying beautifully in the middle distance.  He thought how\nfor a day or so one might come down through passes drawing ever\nnearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways.  He thought of the\nriver journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the still vaster\nworld beyond, through towns and villages, forest and desert places,\nthe rushing river day by day, until its banks receded, and the big\nsteamers came splashing by and one had reached the sea--the\nlimitless sea, with its thousand islands, its thousands of islands,\nand its ships seen dimly far away in their incessant journeyings\nround and about that greater world.  And there, unpent by\nmountains, one saw the sky--the sky, not such a disc as one saw it\nhere, but an arch of immeasurable blue, a deep of deeps in which\nthe circling stars were floating . . . .\n\nHis eyes began to scrutinise the great curtain of the\nmountains with a keener inquiry.\n\nFor example; if one went so, up that gully and to that chimney\nthere, then one might come out high among those stunted pines that\nran round in a sort of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it\npassed above the gorge.  And then?  That talus might be managed.\nThence perhaps a climb might be found to take him up to the\nprecipice that came below the snow; and if that chimney failed,\nthen another farther to the east might serve his purpose better.\nAnd then?  Then one would be out upon the amber-lit snow there, and\nhalf-way up to the crest of those beautiful desolations.  And\nsuppose one had good fortune!\n\nHe glanced back at the village, then turned right round and\nregarded it with folded arms.\n\nHe thought of Medina-sarote, and she had become small and\nremote.\n\nHe turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day\nhad come to him.\n\nThen very circumspectly he began his climb.\n\nWhen sunset came he was not longer climbing, but he was far and high.\nHis clothes were torn, his limbs were bloodstained, he was bruised\nin many places, but he lay as if he were at his ease, and there\nwas a smile on his face.\n\nFrom where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit\nand nearly a mile below.  Already it was dim with haze and shadow,\nthough the mountain summits around him were things of light and\nfire.  The mountain summits around him were things of light and\nfire, and the little things in the rocks near at hand were drenched\nwith light and beauty, a vein of green mineral piercing the\ngrey, a flash of small crystal here and there, a minute,\nminutely-beautiful orange lichen close beside his face.  There\nwere deep, mysterious shadows in the gorge, blue deepening into\npurple, and purple into a luminous darkness, and overhead was the\nillimitable vastness of the sky.  But he heeded these things no\nlonger, but lay quite still there, smiling as if he were content\nnow merely to have escaped from the valley of the Blind, in which\nhe had thought to be King.  And the glow of the sunset passed, and\nthe night came, and still he lay there, under the cold, clear stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Door in the Wall And Other Stories\nby H.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
