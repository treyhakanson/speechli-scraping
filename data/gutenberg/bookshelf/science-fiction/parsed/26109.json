Men\nand women, delegates and spectators, aged party wheelhorses and\nyoungsters who would vote for the first time that November, all lost\ntheir identities to merge with that swirling tide. Over their heads,\nlike agitated bits of flotsam, pennants fluttered and placards rose and\ndipped. Beneath their feet, discarded metal buttons that bore the names\nof two or three \"favorite sons\" and those that had touted the only\nserious contender against the party's new candidate were trodden flat.\nNone of them had ever really had a chance.\n\nThe buttons that were now pinned on every lapel said: \"Blast 'em With\nCannon!\" or \"Cannon Can Do!\" The placards and the box-shaped signs, with\na trifle more dignity, said: WIN WITH CANNON and CANNON FOR PRESIDENT\nand simply JAMES H. CANNON.\n\nOccasionally, in the roar of noise, there were shouts of \"Cannon!\nCannon! Rah! Rah! Rah! Cannon! Cannon! Sis-boom-bah!\" and snatches of\nold popular tunes hurriedly set with new words:\n\n    _On with Cannon, on with Cannon!\n      White House, here we come!\n    He's a winner, no beginner;\n      He can get things done!\n      (Rah! Rah! Rah!)_\n\nAnd, over in one corner, a group of college girls were enthusiastically\nchanting:\n\n    _He is handsome! He is sexy!\n    We want J. H. C. for Prexy!_\n\nIt was a demonstration that lasted nearly three times as long as the\neighty-five-minute demonstration that had occurred when Representative\nMatson had first proposed his name for the party's nomination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpatially, Senator James Harrington Cannon was four blocks away from\nConvention Hall, in a suite at the Statler-Hilton, but electronically,\nhe was no farther away than the television camera that watched the\ncheering multitude from above the floor of the hall.\n\nThe hotel room was tastefully and expensively decorated, but neither the\nsenator nor any of the other men in the room were looking at anything\nelse except the big thirty-six-inch screen that glowed and danced with\ncolor. The network announcer's words were almost inaudible, since the\nvolume had been turned way down, but his voice sounded almost as excited\nas those from the convention floor.\n\nSenator Cannon's broad, handsome face showed a smile that indicated\npleasure, happiness, and a touch of triumph. His dark, slightly wavy\nhair, with the broad swathes of silver at the temples, was a little\ndisarrayed, and there was a splash of cigarette ash on one trouser leg,\nbut otherwise, even sitting there in his shirt sleeves, he looked\nwell-dressed. His wide shoulders tapered down to a narrow waist and lean\nhips, and he looked a good ten years younger than his actual fifty-two.\n\nHe lit another cigarette, but a careful scrutiny of his face would have\nrevealed that, though his eyes were on the screen, his thoughts were not\nin Convention Hall.\n\nRepresentative Matson, looking like an amazed bulldog, managed to chew\nand puff on his cigar simultaneously and still speak understandable\nEnglish. \"Never saw anything like it. Never. First ballot and you had\nit, Jim. I know Texas was going to put up Perez as a favorite son on the\nfirst ballot, but they couldn't do anything except jump on the bandwagon\nby the time the vote reached them. Unanimous on the first ballot.\"\n\nGovernor Spanding, a lantern-jawed, lean man sitting on the other side\nof Senator Cannon, gave a short chuckle and said, \"Came close not t'\nbeing unanimous. The delegate from Alabama looked as though he was going\nto stick to his 'One vote for Byron Beauregarde Cadwallader' until\nCadwallader himself went over to make him change his vote before the\nfirst ballot was complete.\"\n\nThe door opened, and a man came in from the other room. He bounced in on\nthe balls of his feet, clapped his hands together, and dry-washed them\nbriskly. \"We're in!\" he said, with businesslike glee. \"Image, gentlemen!\nThat's what does it: Image!\" He was a tall, rather bony-faced man in his\nearly forties, and his manner was that of the self-satisfied businessman\nwho is quite certain that he knows all of the answers and all of the\nquestions. \"Create an image that the public goes for, and you're in!\"\n\nSenator Cannon turned his head around and grinned. \"Thanks, Horvin, but\nlet's remember that we still have an election to win.\"\n\n\"We'll win it,\" Horvin said confidently. \"A properly projected image\nattracts the public--\"\n\n\"Oh, crud,\" said Representative Matson in a growly voice. \"The\nopposition has just as good a staff of PR men as we do. If we beat 'em,\nit'll be because we've got a better man, not because we've got better\npublic relations.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Horvin, unabashed. \"We can project a better image\nbecause we've got better material to work with. We--\"\n\n\"Jim managed to get elected to the Senate without any of your help, and\nhe went in with an avalanche. If there's any 'image projecting' done\naround here, Jim is the one who does it.\"\n\nHorvin nodded his head as though he were in complete agreement with\nMatson. \"Exactly. His natural ability plus the scientific application of\nmass psychology make an unbeatable team.\"\n\nMatson started to say something, but Senator Cannon cut in first. \"He's\nright, Ed. We've got to use every weapon we have to win this election.\nAnother four years of the present policies, and the Sino-Russian Bloc\nwill be able to start unilateral disarmament. They won't have to start a\nwar to bury us.\"\n\nHorvin looked nervous. \"Uh ... Senator--\"\n\nCannon made a motion in the air. \"I know, I know. Our policy during the\ncampaign will be to run down the opposition, not the United States. We\nare still in a strong position, but _if this goes on_--Don't worry,\nHorvin; the whole thing will be handled properly.\"\n\nBefore any of them could say anything, Senator Cannon turned to\nRepresentative Matson and said: \"Ed, will you get Matthew Fisher on the\nphone? And the Governor of Pennsylvania and ... let's see ... Senator\nHidekai and Joe Vitelli.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know Fisher was here,\" Matson said. \"What do you want him\nfor?\"\n\n\"I just want to talk to him, Ed. Get him up here, with the others, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Sure, Jim; sure.\" He got up and walked over to the phone.\n\nHorvin, the PR man, said: \"Well, Senator, now that you're the party's\ncandidate for the Presidency of the United States, who are you going to\npick for your running mate? Vollinger was the only one who came even\nclose to giving you a run for your money, and it would be good public\nrelations if you chose him. He's got the kind of personality that would\nmake a good image.\"\n\n\"Horvin,\" the senator said kindly, \"I'll pick the men; you build the\nimage from the raw material I give you. You're the only man I know who\ncan convince the public that a sow's ear is really a silk purse, and you\nmay have to do just that.\n\n\"You can start right now. Go down and get hold of the news boys and\ntell them that the announcement of my running mate will be made as soon\nas this demonstration is over.\n\n\"Tell them you can't give them any information other than that, but give\nthem the impression that you already know. Since you _don't_ know, don't\ntry to guess; that way you won't let any cats out of the wrong bags. But\nyou _do_ know that he's a fine man, and you're pleased as all hell that\nI made such a good choice. Got that?\"\n\nHorvin grinned. \"Got it. You pick the man; I'll build the image.\" He\nwent out the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the door had closed, Governor Spanding said: \"So it's going to be\nFisher, is it?\"\n\n\"You know too much, Harry,\" said Senator Cannon, grinning. \"Remind me to\nappoint you ambassador to Patagonia after Inauguration Day.\"\n\n\"If I lose the election at home, I may take you up on it. But why\nMatthew Fisher?\"\n\n\"He's a good man, Harry.\"\n\n\"Hell yes, he is,\" the governor said. \"Tops. I've seen his record as\nState Attorney General and as Lieutenant Governor. And when Governor\nDinsmore died three years ago, Fisher did a fine job filling out his\nlast year. But--\"\n\n\"But he couldn't get re-elected two years ago,\" Senator Cannon said. \"He\ncouldn't keep the governor's office, in spite of the great job he'd\ndone.\"\n\n\"That's right. He's just not a politician, Jim. He doesn't have the ...\nthe personality, the flash, whatever it is that it takes to get a man\nelected by the people. I've got it; you sure as hell have it; Fisher\ndoesn't.\"\n\n\"That's why I've got Horvin working for us,\" said Senator Cannon.\n\"Whether I need him or not may be a point of argument. Whether Matthew\nFisher needs him or not is a rhetorical question.\"\n\nGovernor Spanding lit a cigarette in silence while he stared at the\nquasi-riot that was still coming to the screen from Convention Hall.\nThen he said: \"You've been thinking of Matt Fisher all along, then.\"\n\n\"Not Patagonia,\" said the senator. \"Tibet.\"\n\n\"I'll shut up if you want me to, Jim.\"\n\n\"No. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"All right. Jim, I trust your judgment. I've got no designs on the Vice\nPresidency myself, and you know it. I like to feel that, if I had, you'd\ngive me a crack at it. No, don't answer that, Jim; just let me talk.\n\n\"What I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of good men in the party\nwho'd make fine VP's; men who've given their all to get you the\nnomination, and who'll work even harder to see that you're elected. Why\npass them up in favor of a virtual unknown like Matt Fisher?\"\n\nSenator Cannon didn't say anything. He knew that Spanding didn't want an\nanswer yet.\n\n\"The trouble with Fisher,\" Spanding went on, \"is that he ... well, he's\ntoo autocratic. He pulls decisions out of midair. He--\" Spanding paused,\napparently searching for a way to express himself. Senator Cannon said\nnothing; he waited expectantly.\n\n\"Take a look at the Bossard Decision,\" Spanding said. \"Fisher was\nAttorney General for his state at the time.\n\n\"Bossard was the Mayor of Waynesville--twelve thousand and something\npopulation, I forget now. Fisher didn't even know Bossard. But when the\nbig graft scandal came up there in Waynesville, Fisher wouldn't\nprosecute. He didn't actually refuse, but he hemmed and hawed around for\nfive months before he really started the State's machinery to moving. By\nthat time, Bossard had managed to get enough influence behind him so\nthat he could beat the rap.\n\n\"When the case came to trial in the State Supreme Court, Matt Fisher\ntold the Court that it was apparent that Mayor Bossard was the victim of\nthe local district attorney and the chief of police of Waynesville. In\nspite of the evidence against him, Bossard was acquitted.\" Spanding took\na breath to say something more, but Senator James Cannon interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"Not 'acquitted', Harry. 'Exonerated'. Bossard never even should have\ncome to trial,\" the senator said. \"He was a popular, buddy-buddy sort of\nguy who managed to get himself involved as an unwitting figurehead.\nBossard simply wasn't--and isn't--very bright. But he was a friendly,\noutgoing, warm sort of man who was able to get elected through the\nauspices of the local city machine. Remember Jimmy Walker?\"\n\nSpanding nodded. \"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Same thing,\" Cannon cut in. \"Bossard was innocent, as far as any\ncriminal intent was concerned, but he was too easy on his so-called\nfriends. He--\"\n\n\"Oh, _crud_, Jim!\" the governor interrupted vehemently. \"That's the same\nwhitewash that Matthew Fisher gave him! The evidence would have\nconvicted Bossard if Fisher hadn't given him time to cover up!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSenator James Cannon suddenly became angry. He jammed his own cigarette\nbutt into the ash tray, turned toward Spanding, and snapped: \"Harry,\njust for the sake of argument, let's suppose that Bossard wasn't\nactually guilty. Let's suppose that the Constitution of the United\nStates is really true--that a man isn't guilty until he's proven guilty.\n\n\"Just _suppose_\"--his voice and expression became suddenly acid--\"that\nBossard was _not_ guilty. Try that, huh? Pretend, somewhere in your own\nlittle mind, that a mere accusation--no matter what the\nevidence--doesn't prove anything! Let's just make a little game between\nthe two of us that the ideal of Equality Under the Law means what it\nsays. Want to play?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, but--\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" Cannon went on angrily. \"O.K. Then let's suppose that Bossard\nreally _was_ stupid. He could have been framed easily, couldn't he? He\ncould have been set up as a patsy, couldn't he? _Couldn't he?_\"\n\n\"Well, sure, but--\"\n\n\"Sure! Then go on and suppose that the prosecuting attorney had sense\nenough to see that Bossard _had_ been framed. Suppose further that the\nprosecutor was enough of a human being to know that Bossard either had\nto be convicted or completely exonerated. What would he do?\"\n\nGovernor Spanding carefully put his cigarette into the nearest ash tray.\n\"If that were the case, I'd _completely_ exonerate him. I wouldn't leave\nit hanging. Matt Fisher didn't do anything but make sure that Bossard\ncouldn't be legally convicted; he didn't prove that Bossard was\ninnocent.\"\n\n\"And what was the result, as far as Bossard was concerned?\" the senator\nasked.\n\nSpanding looked around at the senator, staring Cannon straight in the\nface. \"The result was that Bossard was left hanging, Jim. If I go along\nwith you and assume that Bossard was innocent, then Fisher fouled up\njust as badly as he would have if he'd fluffed the prosecution of a\nguilty man. Either a man is guilty, or he's innocent. If, according to\nyour theory, the prosecutor knows he's innocent, then he should\nexonerate the innocent man! If not, he should do his best to convict!\"\n\n\"He should?\" snapped Cannon. \"He _should_? Harry, you're letting your\nidealism run away with you! If Bossard were guilty, he should have been\nconvicted--sure! But if he were innocent, should he be exonerated?\nShould he be allowed to run again for office? Should the people be\nallowed to think that he was lily-white? Should they be allowed to\nre-elect a nitwit who'd do the same thing again because he was too\nstupid to see that he was being used?\n\n\"No!\" He didn't let the governor time to speak; he went on: \"Matthew\nFisher set it up perfectly. He exonerated Bossard enough to allow the\nex-mayor to continue in private life without any question. _But_--there\nremained just enough question to keep him out of public office for the\nrest of his life. Was that wrong, Harry? Was it?\"\n\nSpanding looked blankly at the senator for a moment, then his expression\nslowly changed to one of grudging admiration. \"Well ... if you put it\nthat way ... yeah. I mean, no; it wasn't wrong. It was the only way to\nplay it.\" He dropped his cigarette into a nearby ash tray. \"O.K., Jim;\nyou win. I'll back Fisher all the way.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Harry,\" Cannon said. \"Now, if we--\"\n\nCongressman Matson came back into the room, saying, \"I got 'em, Jim.\nFive or ten minutes, they'll be here. Which one of 'em is it going to\nbe?\"\n\n\"Matt Fisher, if we can come to an agreement,\" Cannon said, watching\nMatson's face closely.\n\nMatson chewed at his cigar for a moment, then nodded. \"He'll do. Not\nmuch political personality, but, hell, he's only running for Veep. We\ncan get him through.\" He took the cigar out of his mouth. \"How do you\nwant to run it?\"\n\n\"I'll talk to Fisher in my bedroom. You and Harry hold the others in\nhere with the usual chitchat. Tell 'em I'm thinking over the choice of\nmy running mate, but don't tell 'em I've made up my mind yet. If Matt\nFisher doesn't want it, we can tell the others that Matt and I were\nsimply talking over the possibilities. I don't want anyone to think he's\nsecond choice. Got it?\"\n\nMatson nodded. \"Whatever you say, Jim.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat year, late August was a real blisterer along the eastern coast of\nthe United States. The great megalopolis that sprawled from Boston to\nBaltimore in utter scorn of state boundaries sweltered in the kind of\natmosphere that is usually only found in the pressing rooms of large\ntailor shops. Consolidated Edison, New York's Own Power Company, was\nchurning out multimegawatts that served to air condition nearly every\nenclosed place on the island of Manhattan--which served only to make the\nopen streets even hotter. The power plants in the Bronx, west Brooklyn,\nand east Queens were busily converting hydrogen into helium and energy,\nand the energy was being used to convert humid air at ninety-six\nFahrenheit into dry air at seventy-one Fahrenheit. The subways were\ncrowded with people who had no intention of going anywhere in\nparticular; they just wanted to retreat from the hot streets to the\nair-conditioned bowels of the city.\n\nBut the heat that can be measured by thermometers was not the kind that\nwas causing two groups of men in two hotels, only a few blocks apart on\nthe East Side of New York's Midtown, to break out in sweat, both\nfigurative and literal.\n\nOne group was ensconced in the Presidential Suite of the New\nWaldorf--the President and Vice President of the United States, both\nrunning for re-election, and other high members of the incumbent party.\n\nThe other group, consisting of Candidates Cannon and Fisher, and the\nhigh members of _their_ party, were occupying the only slightly less\npretentious Bridal Suite of a hotel within easy walking distance of the\nWaldorf.\n\nSenator James Cannon read through the news release that Horvin had\nhanded him, then looked up at the PR man. \"This is right off the wire.\nHow long before it's made public?\"\n\nHorvin glanced at his watch. \"Less than half an hour. There's an NBC\nnews program at five-thirty. Maybe before, if one of the radio stations\nthink it's important enough for a bulletin break.\"\n\n\"That means that it will have been common knowledge for four hours by\nthe time we go on the air for the debate,\" said Cannon.\n\nHorvin nodded, still looking at his watch. \"And even if some people miss\nthe TV broadcast, they'll be able to read all about it. The deadline for\nthe _Daily Register_ is at six; the papers will hit the streets at\nseven-fifteen, or thereabouts.\"\n\nCannon stood up from his chair. \"Get your men out on the streets. Get\n'em into bars, where they can pick up reactions to this. I want as good\na statistical sampling as you can get in so short a time. It'll have to\nbe casual; I don't want your men asking questions as though they were\nregular pollsters; just find out what the general trend is.\"\n\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY SCHOENHERR]\n\n\"Right.\" Horvin got out fast.\n\nThe other men in the room were looking expectantly at the senator. He\npaused for a moment, glancing around at them, and then looked down at\nthe paper and said: \"This is a bulletin from Tass News Agency, Moscow.\"\nThen he began reading.\n\n\"Russian Luna Base One announced that at 1600 Greenwich Standard Time\n(12:00 N EDST) a presumed spacecraft of unknown design was damaged by\nRussian rockets and fell to the surface of Luna somewhere in the Mare\nSerenitas, some three hundred fifty miles from the Soviet base. The\ncraft was hovering approximately four hundred miles above the surface\nwhen spotted by Soviet radar installations. Telescopic inspection showed\nthat the craft was not--repeat: not--powered by rockets. Since it failed\nto respond to the standard United Nations recognition signals, rockets\nwere fired to bring it down. In attempting to avoid the rockets, the\ncraft, according to observers, maneuvered in an entirely unorthodox\nmanner, which cannot be attributed to a rocket drive. A nearby burst,\nhowever, visibly damaged the hull of the craft, and it dropped toward\nMare Serenitas. Armed Soviet moon-cats are, at this moment, moving\ntoward the downed craft.\n\n\"Base Commander Colonel A. V. Gryaznov is quoted as saying: 'There can\nbe no doubt that we shall learn much from this craft, since it is\napparently of extraterrestrial origin. We will certainly be able to\noverpower any resistance it may offer, since it has already proved\nvulnerable to our weapons. The missiles which were fired toward our base\nwere easily destroyed by our own antimissile missiles, and the craft was\nunable to either destroy or avoid our own missiles.'\n\n\"Further progress will be released by the Soviet Government as it\noccurs.\"\n\nSenator Cannon dropped the sheet of paper to his side. \"That's it. Matt,\ncome in the bedroom; I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMatthew Fisher, candidate for Vice President of the United States,\nheaved his two-hundred-fifty-pound bulk out of the chair he had been\nsitting in and followed the senator into the other room. Behind them,\nthe others suddenly broke out into a blather of conversation. Fisher's\nclosing of the door cut the sound off abruptly.\n\nSenator Cannon threw the newssheet on the nearest bed and swung around\nto face Matthew Fisher. He looked at the tall, thick, muscular man\ntrying to detect the emotions behind the ugly-handsome face that had\nbeen battered up by football and boxing in college, trying to fathom the\nthoughts beneath the broad forehead and the receding hairline.\n\n\"You got any idea what this _really_ means, Matt?\" he asked after a\nsecond.\n\nFisher's blue-gray eyes widened almost imperceptibly, and his gaze\nsharpened. \"Not until just this moment,\" he said.\n\nCannon looked suddenly puzzled. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fisher said thoughtfully, \"you wouldn't ask me unless it meant\nsomething more than appears on the surface.\" He grinned rather\napologetically. \"I'm sorry, Jim; it takes a second or two to reconstruct\nexactly what _did_ go through my mind.\" His grin faded into a thoughtful\nfrown. \"Anyway, you asked me, and since you're head of the Committee on\nSPACE Travel and Exploration--\" He spread his hands in a gesture that\nmanaged to convey both futility and apology. \"The mystery spacecraft is\nours,\" he said decisively.\n\nJames Cannon wiped a palm over his forehead and sat down heavily on one\nof the beds. \"Right. Sit down. Fine. Now; listen: We--the United\nStates--have a space drive that compares to the rocket in the same way\nthat the jet engine compares to the horse. We've been keeping it under\nwraps that are comparable to those the Manhattan Project was kept under\n'way back during World War II. Maybe more so. But--\" He stopped,\nwatching Fisher's face. Then: \"Can you see it from there?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Fisher said. \"The Soviet Government knows that we have\nsomething ... in fact, they've known it for a long time. They don't know\nwhat, though.\" He found a heavy briar in his pocket, pulled it out, and\nbegan absently stuffing it with tobacco from a pouch he'd pulled out\nwith the pipe. \"Our ship didn't shoot at their base. Couldn't, wouldn't\nhave. Um. They shot it down to try to look it over. Purposely made a\nnear-miss with an atomic warhead.\" He struck a match and puffed the pipe\nalight.\n\n\"Hm-m-m. The Soviet Government,\" he went on, \"must have known that we\nhad something 'way back when they signed the Greenston Agreement.\"\nFisher blew out a cloud of smoke. \"They wanted to change the wording of\nthat, as I remember.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Cannon said. \"We wanted it to read that 'any advances in\n_rocket engineering_ shall be shared equally among the Members of the\nUnited Nations', but the Soviet delegation wanted to change that to 'any\nadvances in _space travel_'. We only beat them out by a verbal quibble;\nwe insisted that the word 'space', as used, could apply equally to the\nspace between continents or cities or, for that matter, between any two\npoints. By the time we got through arguing, the UN had given up on the\nSoviet amendment, and the agreement was passed as was.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Fisher, \"I remember. So now we have a space drive that\ndoesn't depend on rockets, and the USSR wants it.\" He stared at the bowl\nof his briar for a moment, then looked up at Cannon. \"The point is that\nthey've brought down one of our ships, and we have to get it out of\nthere before the Russians get to it. Even if we manage to keep them from\nfinding out anything about the drive, they can raise a lot of fuss in\nthe UN if they can prove that it's our ship.\"\n\n\"Right. They'll ring in the Greenston Agreement even if the ship\ntechnically isn't a rocket,\" Cannon said. \"Typical Soviet tactics. They\ntry to time these things to hit at the most embarrassing moments. Four\nyears ago, our worthy opponent got into office because our\nadministration was embarrassed by the Madagascar Crisis. They simply try\nto show the rest of the world that, no matter which party is in, the\nUnited states is run by a bunch of inept fools.\" He slapped his hand\ndown on the newssheet that lay near him. \"This may win us the election,\"\nhe said angrily, \"but it will do us more harm in the long run than if\nour worthy opponent stayed in the White House.\"\n\n\"Of what avail to win an election and lose the whole Solar System,\"\nFisher paraphrased. \"It looks as though the President has a hot potato.\"\n\n\"'Hot' is the word. Pure californium-254.\" Cannon lit a cigarette and\nlooked moodily at the glowing end. \"But this puts us in a hole, too. Do\nwe, or don't we, mention it on the TV debate this evening? If we don't,\nthe public will wonder why; if we do, we'll put the country on the\nspot.\"\n\nMatt Fisher thought for a few seconds. Then he said, \"The ship must have\nalready been having trouble. Otherwise it wouldn't have been hovering in\nplain sight of the Soviet radar. How many men does one of those ships\nhold?\"\n\n\"Two,\" the senator told him.\n\n\"We do have more than one of those ships, don't we?\" Fisher asked\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Four on Moon Base; six more building,\" said Senator Cannon.\n\n\"The downed ship must have been in touch with--\" He stopped abruptly,\npaused for a second, then said: \"I have an idea, Senator, but you'll\nhave to do the talking. We'll have to convince the President that what\nwe're suggesting is for the good of the country and not just a political\ntrick. And we don't have much time. Those moon-cats shouldn't take more\nthan twelve or fifteen hours to reach the ship.\"\n\n\"What's your idea?\"\n\n\"Well, it's pretty rough right now; we can't fill in the details until\nwe get more information, but--\" He knocked the dottle from his pipe and\nbegan outlining his scheme to the senator.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMajor Valentin Udovichenko peered through the \"windshield\" of his\nmoon-cat and slowed the vehicle down as he saw the glint of metal on the\nEarthlit plain ahead. \"Captain!\" he snapped. \"What does that look like\nto you?\" He pointed with a gloved hand.\n\nThe other officer looked. \"I should say,\" he said after a moment, \"that\nwe have found what we have been looking for, major.\"\n\n\"So would I. It's a little closer to our base than the radarmen\ncalculated, but it certainly could have swerved after it dropped below\nthe horizon. And we know there hasn't been another ship in this\nvicinity.\"\n\nThe captain was focusing a pair of powerful field glasses on the object.\n\"That's it!\" he said bridling his excitement. \"Egg-shaped, and no sign\nof rocket exhausts. Big dent in one side.\"\n\nMajor Udovichenko had his own binoculars out. \"It's as plain as day in\nthis Earthlight. No sign of life, either. We shouldn't have any\ntrouble.\" He lowered the binoculars and picked up a microphone to give\nthe other nine moon-cats their instructions.\n\nEight of the vehicles stayed well back, ready to launch rockets directly\nat the fallen spacecraft if there were any sign of hostility, while two\nmore crept carefully up on her.\n\nThey were less than a hundred and fifty yards away when the object they\nwere heading for caught fire. The major braked his vehicle to a sudden\nhalt and stared at the bright blaze that was growing and spreading over\nthe metallic shape ahead. Bursts of flame sprayed out in every\ndirection, the hot gases meeting no resistance from the near-vacuum into\nwhich they spread.\n\nMajor Udovichenko shouted orders into his microphone and gunned his own\nmotor into life again. The caterpillar treads crunched against the lunar\nsurface as both moon-cats wheeled about and fled. Four hundred yards\nfrom the blaze, they stopped again and watched.\n\nBy this time, the blaze had eaten away more than half of the hulk, and\nit was surrounded by a haze of smoke and hot gas that was spreading\nrapidly away from it. The flare of light far outshone the light\nreflected from the sun by the Earth overhead.\n\n\"Get those cameras going!\" the major snapped. He knew that the eight\nmoon-cats that formed the distant perimeter had been recording steadily,\nbut he wanted close-ups, if possible.\n\nNone of the cameras got much of anything. The blaze didn't last long,\nfierce as it was. When it finally died, and the smoke particles settled\nslowly to the lunar surface, there was only a blackened spot where the\nbulk of a spaceship had been.\n\n\"Well ... I ... will ... be--,\" said Major Valentin Udovichenko.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe TV debate was over. The senator and the President had gone at each\nother hot and heavy, hammer and tongs, with the senator clearly emerging\nas the victor. But no mention whatever had been made of the Soviet\nannouncement from Luna.\n\nAt four thirty-five the next morning, the telephone rang in the\nsenator's suite. Cannon had been waiting for it, and he was quick to\nanswer.\n\nThe face that appeared on the screen was that of the President of the\nUnited States. \"Your scheme worked, senator,\" he said without preamble.\nThere was an aloofness, a coolness in his voice. Which was only natural,\nconsidering the heat of the debate the previous evening.\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it, Mr. President,\" the senator said, with only a hair\nless coolness. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Your surmise that the Soviet officials did not realize the potential of\nthe new craft was apparently correct,\" the President said. \"General\nThayer had already sent another ship in to rescue the crew of the\ndisabled vessel, staying low, below the horizon of the Russian radar.\nThe disabled ship had had some trouble with its drive mechanism; it\nwould never have deliberately exposed itself to Russian detection.\nGeneral Thayer had already asked my permission to destroy the disabled\nvessel rather than let the Soviets get their hands on it, and, but for\nyour suggestion, I would have given him a go-ahead.\n\n\"But making a replica of the ship in plastic was less than a two-hour\njob. The materials were at hand; a special foam plastic is used as\ninsulation from the chill of the lunar substrata. The foam plastic was\nimpregnated with ammonium nitrate and foamed up with pure oxygen; since\nit is catalyst-setting, that could be done at low temperatures. The\noutside of the form was covered with metallized plastic, also\nimpregnated with ammonium nitrate. I understand that the thing burned\nlike unconfined gunpowder after it was planted in the path of the Soviet\nmoon-cats and set off. The Soviet vehicles are on their way back to\ntheir base now.\"\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he went on: \"Senator, in spite of our\npolitical differences, I want to say that I appreciate a man who can put\nhis country's welfare ahead of his political ambitions.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. President. That is a compliment I appreciate and accept.\nBut I want you to know that the notion of decoying them away with an\ninflammable plastic replica was not my idea; it was Matt Fisher's.\"\n\n\"Oh? My compliments to Mr. Fisher.\" He smiled then. It was obviously\nforced, but, just as obviously, there was sincerity behind it. \"I hope\nthe best team wins. But if it does not, I am secure in the knowledge\nthat the second best team is quite competent.\"\n\nFirmly repressing a desire to say, _I am sorry that I don't feel any\nsuch security myself_, Cannon merely said: \"Thank you again, Mr.\nPresident.\"\n\nWhen the connection was cut, Cannon grinned at Matthew Fisher. \"That's\nit. We've saved a ship. It can be repaired where it is without a fleet\nof Soviet moon-cats prowling around and interfering. And we've scotched\nany attempts at propagandizing that the Soviets may have had in mind.\"\nHe chuckled. \"I'd like to have seen their faces when that thing started\nto burn in a vacuum. And I'd like to see the reports that are being\nflashed back and forth between Moscow and Soviet Moon Base One.\"\n\n\"I wasn't so much worried about the loss of the disabled ship as the\n_way_ we'd lose it,\" Matthew Fisher said.\n\n\"The Soviets getting it?\" Cannon asked. \"We didn't have to worry about\nthat. You heard him say that Thayer was going to destroy it.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I meant,\" said Fisher. \"_How_ were we going to\ndestroy it? TNT or dynamite or Radex-3 would have still left enough\nbehind for a good Soviet team to make some kind of sense out of it--some\nkind of hint would be there, unless an awful lot of it were used. A\nfission or a thermonuclear bomb would have vaporized it, but that would\nhave been a violation of the East-West Agreement. We'd be flatly in the\nwrong.\"\n\nSenator Cannon walked over to the sideboard and poured Scotch into two\nglasses. \"The way it stands now, the ship will at least be able to limp\nout of there before anyone in Moscow can figure out what happened and\ntransmit orders back to Luna.\" He walked back with the glasses and\nhanded one to Fisher. \"Let's have a drink and go to bed. We have to be\nin Philadelphia tomorrow, and I'm dead tired.\"\n\n\"That's a pair of us,\" said Fisher, taking the glass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother month of campaigning, involving both televised and personal\nappearances, went by without unusual incidents. The prophets, seers,\nand pollsters were having themselves a grand time. Some of them--the\npredicting-by-past-performances men--were pointing out that only four\nPresidents had failed to succeed themselves when they ran for a second\nterm: Martin Van Buren, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, and Herbert\nHoover. They argued that this presaged little chance of success for\nSenator James Cannon. The pollsters said that their samplings had shown\na strong leaning toward the President at first, but that eight weeks of\ncampaigning had started a switch toward Cannon, and that the movement\nseemed to be accelerating. The antipollsters, as usual, simply smiled\nsmugly and said: \"Remember Dewey in '48?\"\n\nPlays on Cannon's name had caught the popular fancy. The slogan \"Blast\n'em With Cannon\" now appeared on every button worn by those who\nsupported him--who called themselves \"Cannoneers.\" Their opponents\nsneeringly referred to them as \"Cannon fodder,\" and made jokes about\n\"that big bore Cannon.\"\n\nThe latter joke was pure epithet, with no meaning behind it; when\nSenator James Cannon spoke, either in person or over the TV networks,\neven his opponents listened with grudging interest.\n\nThe less conservative newspapers couldn't resist the gag, either, and\nprinted headlines on the order of CANNON FIRES BLAST AT FOREIGN POLICY,\nCANNON HOT OVER CIA ORDER, BUDGET BUREAU SHAKEN BY CANNON REPORT, and\nTREASURY IS LATEST CANNON TARGET.\n\nThe various newspaper columnists, expanding on the theme, made even more\natrocious puns. When the senator praised his running mate, a columnist\nsaid that Fisher had been \"Cannonized,\" and proceeded to call him\n\"Saint\" Matthew. The senator's ability to remember the names and faces\nof his constituents caused one pundit to remark that \"it's a wise Cannon\nthat knows its own fodder.\"\n\nThey whooped with joy when the senator's plane was delayed by bad\nweather; causing him to arrive several hours late to a bonfire rally in\nTexas. Only a strong headline writer could resist: CANNON MISSES FIRE!\n\nAs a result, the senator's name hit the headlines more frequently than\nhis rival's did. And the laughter was _with_ Cannon, not _at_ him.\n\nNothing more was heard about the \"mysterious craft\" that the Soviet\nclaimed to have shot down, except a terse report that said it had\n\"probably been destroyed.\" It was impossible to know whether or not they\nhad deduced what had happened, or whether they realized that the new\ncraft was as maneuverable over the surface of the moon as a helicopter\nwas over the surface of Earth.\n\nInstead, the Sino-Soviet bloc had again shifted the world's attention to\nAfrica. Like the Balkan States of nearly a century before, the small,\nindependent nations that covered the still-dark continent were a\ncontinuing source of trouble. In spite of decades of \"civilization,\"\nthe thoughts and actions of the majority of Africans were still cast in\nthe matrix of tribal taboos. The changes of government, the internal\nstrife, and the petty brush wars between nations made Central and South\nAmerica appear rigidly stable by comparison. It had been suggested that\nthe revolutions in Africa occurred so often that only a tachometer could\nkeep up with them.\n\nIf nothing else, the situation had succeeded in forcing the organization\nof a permanent UN police force; since back in 1960, there had not been a\ntime when the UN Police were not needed somewhere in Africa.\n\nIn mid-October, a border dispute between North Uganda and South Uganda\nbroke out, and within a week it looked as though the Commonwealth of\nVictorian Kenya, the Republic of Upper Tanganyika, and the Free and\nIndependent Popular Monarchy of Ruanda-Urundi were all going to try to\njump in and grab a piece of territory if possible.\n\nThe Soviet Representative to the United Nations charged that \"this is a\npurely internal situation in Uganda, caused by imperialist _agents\nprovocateur_ financed by the Western Bloc.\" He insisted that UN\nintervention was unnecessary unless the \"warmongering\" neighbors of\nUganda got into the scrap.\n\nIn a televised press interview, Vice Presidential Candidate Matthew\nFisher was asked what he thought of the situation in East Africa.\n\n\"Both North and South Uganda,\" he said, \"are communist controlled, but,\nlike Yugoslavia, they have declared themselves independent of the\nmasters at Moscow. If this conflict was stirred up by special\nagents--and I have no doubt that it was--those agents were Soviet, not\nWestern agents. As far as the UN can be concerned, the Soviet Minister\nis correct, since the UN has recognized only the government of North\nUganda as the government of all Uganda, and it is, therefore, a purely\ninternal affair.\n\n\"The revolution--that is, _partial_ revolution--which caused the\ndivision of Uganda a few years ago, was likewise due to Soviet\nintervention. They hoped to replace the independent communist government\nwith one which would be, in effect, a puppet of the Kremlin. They\nfailed. Now they are trying again.\n\n\"Legally, UN troops can only be sent there at the request of the\nNorthern Uganda government. The Secretary General can send police troops\nthere of his own accord only if another nation tries to invade Uganda.\n\n\"But--and here is the important point--if the Uganda government asks the\naid of a friendly government to send troops, and if that friendly\ngovernment complies with that request, _that cannot be considered an\ninvasion_!\"\n\nQuestion from a reporter: \"Do you believe that such intervention from\nanother country will be requested by Uganda?\"\n\n\"I do. And I am equally certain that the Soviet representative to the\nUN, and his Superiors in Moscow, will try to make a case of invasion and\naggression out of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin twenty-four hours after that interview, the government of North\nUganda requested aid from Victorian Kenya, and a huge contingent of\nKenyan troops marched across the border to help the North Uganda army.\nAnd the Soviet representative insisted that the UN send in troops to\nstop the \"imperialist aggression\" of Victorian Kenya. The rigidly\npro-Western VK government protested that the Sino-Soviet accusations\nwere invalid, and then asked, on its own accord, that a UN contingent be\nsent in to arbitrate and act as observers and umpires.\n\n\"Win one, lose one,\" Matthew Fisher said privately to Senator Cannon.\n\"Uganda will come out of this with a pro-Western government, but it\nmight not be too stable. The whole African situation is unstable.\nMathematically, it has to be.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" Senator Cannon asked.\n\n\"Do you know the Richardson-Gordon Equations?\" Fisher asked.\n\n\"No. I'm not much of a mathematician,\" Cannon admitted. \"What do they\nhave to do with this?\"\n\n\"They were originally proposed by Lewis Richardson, the English\nmathematician, and later refined by G. R. Gordon. Basically, they deal\nwith the causes of war, and they show that a conglomeration of small\nstates is less stable than a few large ones. In an arms race, there is\na kind of positive feedback that eventually destroys the system, and the\nmore active small units there are, the sooner the system reaches the\ndestruction point.\"\n\n[Illustration: _Sometimes \"resignation\" means the highest determination\n... when you can't simply resign._]\n\nSenator Cannon chuckled. \"Any practical politician could have told them\nthat, but I'm glad to hear that a mathematical tool to work on the\nproblem has been devised. Maybe one of these days we won't have to be\nrule-of-thumb empiricists.\"\n\n\"Let's hope so,\" said Matt Fisher.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the end of October, nearly two weeks from Election Day, the decision\nhad been made. There were still a few Americans who hadn't made up their\nminds yet, but not enough to change the election results, even if they\nhad voted as a bloc for one side or the other. The change from the\nshouting and arguing of mid-summer was apparent to anyone who knew what\nhe was looking for. In the bars and restaurants, in the subways and\nbuses, aboard planes and ships and trains, most Americans apparently\nseemed to have forgotten that there was a national election coming up,\nmuch to the surprise of Europeans and Asians who were not familiar with\nthe dynamics of American political thought. If a foreigner brought the\nsubject up, the average American would give his views in a calm manner,\nas though the thing were already settled, but there was far more\ndiscussion of the relative merits of the horses running at Pimlico or\nthe rise in Lunar Developments Preferred than there was of the election.\nThere were still a few people wearing campaign buttons, but most people\ndidn't bother pinning them on after the suit came back from the\ncleaners.\n\nA more detailed analysis would have shown that this calmness was of two\ntypes. The first, by far in the majority, was the calmness of the\ncomplacent knowledge of victory. The second was the resignation to loss\nmanifested by those who knew they were backing the wrong man, but who,\nbecause of party loyalty or intellectual conviction or just plain\nstubbornness, would back him.\n\nWhen Senator Cannon's brother, Dr. Frank Hewlitt Cannon, took a short\nleave of absence from Mayo Clinic to fly to the senator's campaign\nheadquarters, there was a flurry of speculation about the possibility of\nhis being appointed Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, but the\nflurry didn't amount to much. If President Cannon wanted to appoint his\nbrother, that was all right with the voters.\n\nAfter a tirade by the Soviet Premier, charging that the UN Police troops\nin Victorian Kenya were \"tools of Yankee aggressionists,\" Americans\nsmiled grimly and said, in effect: \"Just wait 'til Cannon gets\nin--_he'll_ show 'em.\"\n\nElection Day came with the inevitability of death and taxes. The polling\nbooths opened first on the East Coast, and people began filing in to\ntake their turns at the machines. By the time the polls opened in Nome,\nAlaska, six hours later, the trend was obvious. All but two of the New\nEngland states were strongly for Cannon. New York, Pennsylvania, New\nJersey, West Virginia, and Ohio dropped into his pocket like ripe\napples. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida\ndid the same. Alabama wavered at first, but tagged weakly along.\nTennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan trooped in like trained\nseals.\n\nIn Mississippi, things looked bad. Arkansas and Louisiana were\nuncertain. But the pro-Cannon vote in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa,\nWisconsin, and Minnesota left no doubt about the outcome in those\nstates. North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma,\nTexas--all Cannon by vast majorities.\n\nAnd so the returns came in, following the sun across the continent. By\nthe time California had reported three-fourths of its votes, it was all\nover but the jubilation. Nothing but an honest-to-God, genuine,\nJoshua-stopping-the-sun type of miracle could have saved the opposition.\nAnd such was not forthcoming.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Cannon's campaign headquarters, a television screen was blaring to\nunhearing ears, merely adding to the din that was going on in the\nmeeting hall. The party workhorses and the volunteers who had drummed\nfor Cannon since the convention were repeating the scene that had taken\nplace after Cannon's nomination in the summer, with an even greater note\nof triumph.\n\nIn Cannon's suite, six floors above, there was less noise, but only\nbecause there were fewer people.\n\n\"Hey!\" Cannon yelled good-naturedly. \"Lay off! Any more slaps on my\nback, and I'm going to be the first President since Franklin Roosevelt\nto go to my Inauguration in a wheelchair! Lay off, will you?\"\n\n\"A drink, a drink, we got to have a drink,\" chanted Representative Edwin\nMatson, his bulldog face spread wide in a happy grin while he did things\nwith bottles, ice, and glasses. \"A drink, a drink--\"\n\nGovernor Harold Spanding's lantern-jawed face looked as idiotically\nhappy as Matson's, but he was quieter about it. Verbally, that is. It\nwas he who had been pounding Cannon on the back, and now he was pounding\nMatthew Fisher almost as hard.\n\nMatt Fisher finally managed to grab his hand, and he started pumping it.\n\"What about you, Harry? I'm only a poor, simple Vice President. You got\nre-elected governor!\"\n\nDr. Frank Cannon, looking like an older, balder edition of his brother,\nwas smiling, too, but there was a troubled look in his eyes even as he\ncongratulated the senator. Congressman Matson, passing out the drinks,\nhanded the first one to the senator.\n\n\"Have a drink, Mr. President! You're going to have to make a speech\npretty soon; you'll need a bracer!\" He handed the second one to the\nphysician. \"Here you go, Doc! Congratulations! It isn't everyone who's\ngot a President in the family!\" Then his perceptive brain noticed\nsomething in the doctor's expression. \"Hey,\" he said, more softly,\n\"what's the trouble? You look as though you expected sickness in the\nfamily.\"\n\nThe doctor grinned quickly. \"Not unless it's my own. I'm used to\nworrying about a patient's health, not a Presidential election. I'm\nafraid my stomach's a little queasy. Wait just a second; I've got some\npills in my little black bag. Got pills in there for all ailments. Find\nout if anyone else needs resuscitation, will you?\" Drink in hand, he\nwent toward the closet, where his little black bag was stashed.\n\n\"Excitement,\" said Senator Cannon. \"Frank isn't used to politics.\"\n\nMatson chuckled. \"Do him good to see how the other half lives.\" He\nwalked off, bearing drinks for the others. Governor Spanding grabbed one\nand came over to the senator. \"Jim! Ready to tear up your capitulation\nspeech now?\"\n\nCannon glanced at his watch. \"Almost. The polls closed in Nome just ten\nminutes ago. We'll wait for the President's acknowledgment of defeat\nbefore we go downstairs.\" He glanced at his brother, who was washing\nsomething down with water.\n\nBehind him, he heard Matson's voice saying: \"I'm sure glad Horvin isn't\nhere! I can hear him now: 'Image! Image! That's what won the election!\nImage!'\" Matson guffawed. \"Jim Cannon was winning elections by\nlandslides before he ever heard of Horvin! Jim Cannon projects his own\nimage.\"\n\n\"Sure he does,\" Matt Fisher said, \"but what about me?\"\n\n\"You? Hah! You're tops, Matt. Once a man gets to know you, he can see\nthat, if he's got any brains.\"\n\nFisher chuckled gently. \"Ed, you've got what it takes to be a\npolitician, all right.\"\n\n\"So do you, Mr. Vice President! So do you! Hey!\" He turned quickly. \"We\ngot to have a toast! Doc, you're his brother. I think the honor should\nbe yours.\"\n\nDr. Frank Cannon, looking much more chipper since swallowing the pills,\nbeamed and nodded at his brother. \"It will be a pleasure. Gentlemen,\ncome to attention, if you will.\" They did, grinning at first, then\nforcing solemnity into their expressions.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said. Dr. Cannon gravely, \"I give you my brother, Senator\nJames Harrington Cannon, the next President of the United States!\"\n\n\"To the President!\" said Governor Spanding.\n\n\"To the President!\" chorused the others.\n\nGlasses clinked and men drank solemnly.\n\nThen, before anyone else could say anything, Dr. Cannon said: \"I\nfurther propose, gentlemen, that we drink to the man who will spend\nthe next four years in the White House--God willing--in the hope that\nhis ability to handle that high office will be equal to the task before\nhim, and that he will prove worthy of the trust placed in him by those\nwho had faith in that ability.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" said Congressman Matson softly.\n\nAnd they all drank again.\n\nSenator Cannon said: \"I thank you, gentlemen. I--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut, at that moment, the ubiquitous clatter of noise from the television\nabruptly changed tenor. They all turned to look.\n\n\"... And gentlemen,\" the announcer's voice was saying, \"The President of\nthe United States!\"\n\nThe Presidential Seal which had been pictured on the screen faded\nsuddenly, to be replaced by the face of the President. He looked firmly\nresigned, but neither haggard, tired, defeated, nor unhappy. To the five\nmen who stood watching him in that room, it was obvious that the speech\nto come was on tape.\n\nThe President smiled wanly. \"Fellow Americans,\" he began, \"as your\nPresident, I wish both to congratulate you and thank you. As free\ncitizens of a free country, exercising your franchise of the ballot to\ndetermine the men and women who are to represent and lead you during\ntheir coming terms of office, you have made your decision. You have\nconsidered well the qualifications of those men and women, and you\nhave considered well the problems that will face our country as a whole\nand each individual as a free citizen desiring to remain free, and you\nhave made your choice accordingly, as is your right and duty. For that,\nI congratulate you.\"\n\nHe paused for a dramatic moment.\n\n\"The decision, I think, was not an easy one. The citizens of our great\ndemocracy are not sheep, to be led first this way and then that; they\nare not dead leaves to be carried by every vagrant breeze that blows;\nthey are not children, nor are they fools.\"\n\nHe looked searchingly from the screen, as though to see into the minds\nof every person watching.\n\n\"Do not mistake my meaning,\" he said levelly. \"I do not mean that there\nare no fools among us. There are.\" Again he paused for effect. \"Every\nman, every woman, who, through laziness or neglect or complacency,\nfailed to make his desire known at the polls in this election--is a\nfool. Every citizen who thinks that his vote doesn't count for much, and\ntherefore fails to register that vote--is a fool. Every person who\naccepts the _privileges_ of American citizenship and considers them as\n_rights_, and who neglects the _duties_ of citizenship because they are\ntiresome--is a fool.\"\n\nHe waited for half a second.\n\n\"Fortunately for us all, the fools are in a minority in our country.\nThis election shows that. Most of you have done your duty and followed\nyour conscience as you see fit. And I congratulate you for that.\"\n\nThe smile became less broad--by just the right amount.\n\n\"Four years ago, exercising that same privilege and duty, you, the\ncitizens of the United States, honored me and those who were working\nwith me by electing us to the highest offices in this nation. You\nelected us, I believe, because we made certain promises to you--solemn\npromises that were made in our platform four years ago.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath and folded his hands below his chin.\n\n\"I am certain that you all know we have endeavored to keep those\npromises. I am certain that you know that we have kept faith with the\npeople of this nation.\"\n\nHe looked down for a moment, then looked up again.\n\n\"This year, in our platform, we made more promises. We outlined a\nprogram that we felt would be of the greatest benefit to this nation.\"\nHe unclasped his hands and spread them with an open gesture.\n\n\"Senator James Cannon and his party have also made promises--promises\nwhich, I am sure, they, too, feel are best for our nation.\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"You, the citizens of the United States, have, in the past few months,\ncarefully weighed these promises against one another--weighing not only\nthe promises themselves, but the integrity and the ability of the men\nwho made them.\n\n\"And you have made your choice.\n\n\"I cannot, and do not, quarrel with that choice. It is the essence of\ndemocratic government that disagreements in the upper echelons of that\ngovernment shall be resolved by the action and the will of the governed.\nYou, the people of the United States, have done just that.\n\n\"And--for that, I thank you.\"\n\nA final hesitation.\n\n\"Next January, Senator James Harrington Cannon will be inaugurated as\nPresident of the United States. Let us show him, and the men who are to\nwork with him, that we, as citizens of this great nation, resolving our\ndifferences, will strive unceasingly under his administration to further\nthe high resolves and great ideals of our country.\n\n\"I believe--I _know_--that you are all with me in this resolution, and,\nfor that, too,--\n\n\"--I thank you.\"\n\nThe face of the President of the United States faded from the screen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a few seconds, Matson sighed. \"Not bad at all, really,\" he said,\nstepping over to shut off the set. \"He's been taking lessons from you,\nJim. But he just hasn't quite got it.\"\n\nSenator Cannon took another swallow of his drink and said nothing.\n\n\"Sincerity,\" said Governor Spanding. \"That's what's lacking. He hasn't\ngot it, and the voters can feel it.\"\n\n\"He managed to be elected President of the United States on it,\" Senator\nCannon said dryly.\n\nSpanding didn't turn to look at Cannon; he kept looking at the dead TV\nscreen. \"These things always show up by comparison, Jim. In comparison\nwith some of us--most of us, in fact--he looks pretty good. I've known\nhim since he was a fresh junior senator, and I was just attorney for the\nHouse Committee for Legislative Oversight.\" He turned around. \"You know\nwhat, Jim? When I first heard him talk, I actually thought about\nchanging parties. Yeah. Really.\" He turned around again.\n\n\"But,\" he went on, \"he's all hot air and no ability. Just like Matt,\nhere, is all ability and no hot air. No offense meant, Matt, believe\nme,\" he added, glancing at Fisher.\n\n\"I know,\" Fisher said quietly.\n\nSpanding turned around once more and looked Cannon squarely in the eyes.\n\"You've got both, Jim. The blarney to put yourself over, and the ability\nto back it up. And you know I'm not trying to flatter you when I say\nthat.\"\n\nWhen Cannon nodded wordlessly, Spanding gave himself a short,\nembarrassed laugh. \"Ah, Hell. I talk too much.\" And he took a hefty slug\nof his drink.\n\nMatthew Fisher took the overcharge out of the sudden outburst of emotion\nby saying: \"It's more than just ability and sincerity, Harry. There's\ndetermination and honesty, too.\"\n\nMatson said, \"Amen to that.\"\n\nDr. Frank Cannon was just standing there, looking at his brother. There\nwas a definite look of respect on his face.\n\nSenator Cannon said: \"You're all great guys--thanks. But I've got to\nget downstairs and make a speech. Ed, get the recording tape out of that\nset; I want to make some notes on what he said. And hurry it up, we\nhaven't got too long.\"\n\n\"No canned speech for you, eh, Jim?\" Spanding said.\n\n\"Amen to that, too,\" said Representative Matson as he opened the panel\nin the side of the TV set.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom a hundred thousand loudspeakers all over the United States, from\nthe rockbound coast of Maine to the equally rockbound coast of Alaska,\nfrom the sun-washed coast of Florida to the ditto coast of Hawaii, the\nimmortal voice of Bing Crosby, preserved forever in an electronic\npattern made from a decades-old recording, told of a desire for a White\nChristmas. It was a voice and a tune and a lyric that aroused nostalgia\neven in the hearts of Floridians and Californians and Hawaiians who had\nnever seen snow in their lives.\n\nThe other carols rang out, too--\"Silent Night,\" \"Hark! The Herald Angels\nSing,\" \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\" \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" and\nall the others. All over the nation, in millions upon millions of\nChristian homes, the faithful prepared to celebrate the birth, the\ncoming, of their Saviour, Who had come to bring peace on Earth to men.\n\nAnd in millions of other American homes, the Children of Abraham\ncelebrated the Festival of Lights--_Chanukah_, the Dedication--the\ngiving of thanks for the Blessing of God upon the priestly family of\nthe Maccabees, who, twenty-odd centuries before, had taken up arms\nagainst the tyranny of a dynasty which had banned the worship of\nAlmighty God, and who, by winning, had made themselves a symbol forever\nof the moral struggle against the forces that oppress the free mind of\nMan.\n\nThe newspapers and television newscasts were full of the age-old \"human\ninterest stories\" which, in spite of their predictability--the abandoned\nbaby, the dying child, the wretchedly ill oldster--still brought a tear\nto the eye during the Holiday Season.\n\nAs President-elect Cannon slowly made his cabinet appointments, the\nannouncements appeared, but there was hardly any discussion of them,\nmuch less any hue and cry.\n\nOne editorial writer did make a comment: \"It is encouraging to see that\nPresident-elect Cannon consults with Vice-President-elect Matthew Fisher\nregularly and frequently as the appointments are made. For a good many\nyears, ever since the Eisenhower Administration, back in the Fifties, it\nhas been the policy of most of our Chief Executives to make sure that\nthe Vice President is groomed to take over smoothly if anything should\nhappen to the President. Senator Cannon, however, is, as far as we know,\nthe first President-elect who has begun this grooming before the\nInauguration. This, in our opinion, shows both wisdom and political\nastuteness.\"\n\nBy the second week of the New Year, the new Cabinet had been picked.\nContrary to the rumors before the election, the senator's brother had\nnot been selected for any post whatever, but the men who _were_ picked\nfor Cabinet posts were certainly of high caliber. The United States\nSenate had confirmed them all before Inauguration Day.\n\nThat day was clear and cold in Washington. After the seemingly endless\nceremonies and ceremonials, after the Inaugural Ball, and the Inaugural\nSupper, and the Inaugural Et Cetera, President James Cannon went to bed,\ncomplaining of a \"slight headache\".\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Frankly,\" he told Vice President Matthew Fisher, \"it is a real\nhead-splitter.\" He took four aspirin and went to bed.\n\nHe said he felt \"a little better\" the next day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fifth of February.\n\nTen forty-eight in the evening.\n\nThe White House, Washington, D.C.\n\nDr. Frank Hewlitt Cannon stood in a darkened bedroom in Blair House,\nacross the street from the Executive Mansion, nervously looking out the\nwindow, at the big white house across the way. He was not nervous for\nhimself, although he had plenty of reason to be. He was clad in pajamas,\nas his brother had ordered, and had even taken the extra precaution of\nrumpling up his hair.\n\nHe looked at his watch, and then looked back at the White House.\n\n_How long?_ he thought. _How long?_\n\nHe looked at his wrist again. The sweep hand only moved when he looked\nat it, apparently. He dropped his hands and clasped them behind his\nback. How long before he would know?\n\n_My kid brother_, he thought. _I could always outthink him and outfight\nhim. But he's got something I haven't got. He's stuck to his guns and\nfought hard all these years. I couldn't do what he's doing tonight, and\nI know it. You're a better man than I am, kid._\n\nAcross Pennsylvania Avenue, Senator James Cannon was doing some heavy\nconsideration, too. He sat on the edge of his bed and looked at the\nsmall tubular device in his hand.\n\n_Will Frank be safe? That's the only weak point in the plan._\n\nFrank was safe. He _had_ to be. Frank hadn't been over from Blair House\nin three days. They hadn't even _seen_ each other in three days. The\nSecret Service men--\n\nHe threw a glance toward the door that led from his bedroom to the hall.\n\nThe Secret Service agents would know that Frank couldn't possibly have\nhad anything to do with it. The only possible connection would be the\nhypogun itself. He looked at the little gadget. _Hell_, he thought; _now\nor never_.\n\nHe got up and strode purposefully into the bathroom. He smiled crookedly\nat his own reflection in the mirror. It was damnably difficult for a\nPresident to outwit his own bodyguard.\n\n_Get on with it!_\n\nHe swallowed the capsule Frank had given him. Then, placing the muzzle\nagainst the precise spots Frank had shown him, James Cannon pulled the\ntrigger. Once ... twice ... thrice ...\n\nAgainst each nerve center in his left side. Fine.\n\nNow that it was done, all fear--all trepidation--left Senator James\nCannon. Now there was no way to go but ahead.\n\nFirst, the hypogun that had blown the drug into his body. Two minutes to\nget rid of that, for that was the only thing that could tie Frank in to\nthe plan.\n\nThey had already agreed that there was no way to get rid of it. It\ncouldn't be destroyed or thrown away. There was only one way that it\ncould be taken from the White House ...\n\nCannon left his fingerprints on it, dropped it into the wastebasket, and\ncovered it with tissue paper. Then he left the bathroom and walked\ntoward the hall door. Beyond it, he knew, were the guarding Secret\nService men.\n\nAnd already his left side was beginning to feel odd.\n\nHe walked to the door and opened it. He had a scowl on his face.\n\n\"Hello, Jenkins--Grossman,\" he said, as the two men turned. \"I've got a\nhell of a headache again. Aspirin doesn't seem to help, and I can't get\nany sleep.\" He looked rather dazed, as though he wasn't sure of his\nsurroundings. He smiled lopsidedly. \"Call Frank, over at Blair House,\nwill you? Hurry?\" Then he swallowed, looked dazed, and fell to the floor\nin a heap.\n\nThe two Secret Service men didn't move, but they shouted loudly. Their\norders were to guard the body of the President--_literally_! Until it\nwas declared legally dead, that body was their responsibility.\n\nThe other Secret Service men in the White House came on the run. Within\none minute after Cannon had fallen, a call had gone to Blair House,\nasking for the President's brother.\n\nInside of another two minutes, Dr. Frank Cannon was coming through the\nfront door of the Executive Mansion. In spite of the chill outside, he\nwas wearing only a topcoat over his pajamas.\n\n\"What happened?\" he snapped, with the authority that only a physician\ncan muster. \"Where is he?\"\n\nHe heard the story on the way to the President's room. Jenkins and\nGrossman were still standing over the fallen Chief Executive. \"We\nhaven't moved him, except to make him more comfortable,\" said Grossman.\n\"He's still O.K.... I mean, he's breathing, and his heart's still going.\nBut we didn't want to move him--\"\n\n\"Fine!\" snapped the doctor. \"Best thing.\" He knelt over his brother and\npicked up his wrist. \"Have you called anyone else?\" he asked sharply\nwhile he felt the pulse.\n\n\"The Naval Hospital,\" said another agent. \"They're coming fast!\"\n\n\"Fine!\" repeated Dr. Frank. By this time, most of the White House staff\nwas awake. Frank Cannon let go the wrist and stood up quickly. \"Can't\ntell for sure, but it looks like a slight stroke. Excuse me.\"\n\nHe went into the Executive bedroom, and on into the bathroom. He closed\nthe door. Quickly, he fished the hypogun out of the wastebasket and\ndropped it into the little black bag which he had carried with him. He\ncame out with a glass of water. Everything was taken care of.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n      _PRESIDENT SUFFERS STROKE!\n    JHC Taken To US Naval Hospital\n    In Washington After Stroke In\n             White House_\n\nAll over the world, headlines and newscasts in a hundred tongues\ncarried the story. And from all over the world came messages of\nsympathy and concern for the stricken Chief Executive. From England,\nsimultaneous messages arrived from the Sovereign and the Prime Minister;\nfrom France, notes from both the President and the Premier of the\nSeventh Republic; from Ethiopia, condolences from His Imperial Majesty\nand from the Chief Executive. The United German Federation, the\nConstitutional Kingdom of Spain, the Republic of Italy, the United\nAustro-Yugoslavian Commonwealth, and the Polish Free State all sent rush\nradiograms. So did Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,\nParaguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. From Africa, Australia, Southern\nAsia, Oceania, and Central America came expressive words of sorrow.\nSpecial blessings were sent by His Holiness from Vatican City, by the\nPatriarch of Istanbul, and by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The\nPresidente of the Estados Unidos Mexicanos personally took a plane to\nWashington, as did the Governor General of Canada, carrying a personal\nmessage from the Prime Minister. Even the Soviet Union sent a radiogram,\nand the story of the tragedy was printed in _Pravda_, accompanied by an\neditorial that almost approached straight reporting.\n\nPresident James Harrington Cannon knew none of this. He was unconscious\nand unable to receive visitors.\n\nAs far as actual news from the White House was concerned, news\ncommentator Barton Wayne gave the best summary over a major American TV\nnetwork on the morning of the sixth of February:\n\n\"Last night, at approximately eleven p.m., James Harrington Cannon,\nPresident of the United States, collapsed at the feet of the Secret\nService men who were guarding him. Within a few minutes, Dr. Frank\nHewlitt Cannon, the President's brother, called by the Secret Service in\nobedience to the President's last conscious words, had arrived from\nBlair House, where he had been staying.\n\n\"Dr. Frank Cannon diagnosed the President's illness as a--quote--slight\nstroke--unquote. Later, after the President had been taken to the Naval\nHospital for further diagnosis, Dr. Cannon released a statement.\nQuote--further tests have enabled the medical staff of this hospital to\nmake a more detailed analysis. Apparently, the President has suffered a\nslight cerebral hemorrhage which has, temporarily at least, partially\nparalyzed the muscles of his left side. The President, however, has\nregained consciousness, and his life is in no danger--Unquote.\n\n\"After only sixteen days in the White House, the President has fallen\nill. We can only wish him Godspeed and an early recovery.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Frank Cannon stood firmly by his brother's bedside, shaking his head\nfirmly. \"No, commander; I cannot permit that. I am in charge of this\ncase, and I shall remain in charge of it until my patient tells me\notherwise.\"\n\nThe graying Navy medical officer pursed his lips. \"In cases of this\nsort, doctor,\" he said primly, \"the Navy is in charge. The patient is,\nafter all, the President of the United States.\"\n\nDr. Frank went right on shaking his head. \"Cuts no ice, commander. I was\nspecifically summoned by the patient. I agreed to take the case. I will\nbe most happy to accept your co-operation; I welcome your advice and\naid; but I will _not_ allow my patient to be taken from my charge.\"\n\n\"It is hardly considered proper for the physician in charge of a serious\ncase to be a relative of the patient.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But it is neither unethical nor illegal.\" He gave the\ncommander a dry smile. \"I know my brother, commander. Quite well. I also\nknow that you have the authority and the means to expel me from this\nhospital.\" The smile became positively icy. \"And, in view of the former,\nI should not advise you to exercise the latter.\"\n\nThe commander wet his lips. \"I have no intention of doing so, doctor,\"\nhe said rather huffily. \"But, inasmuch as the X rays show no--\"\n\nThere came a mumble from the man on the bed, and, in that instant, both\nmen forgot their differences and became physicians again, as they\nfocused their attention on the patient.\n\nPresident Cannon was blinking his eyes groggily. Or, rather, _eye_. The\nleft one refused to do more than show a faint flicker of the lid.\n\n\"Hullo, Jamie,\" Dr. Frank said gently. \"How d'you feel?\" It took nerves\nof steel to show that tender composure. The drug should wear off\nquickly, but if Jim Cannon's mind was still fuzzy, and he said the wrong\nthing--\n\nFor a moment, the President said nothing as he tried to focus his right\neye.\n\n\"Don't try to move, Mr. President,\" said the Navy doctor softly.\n\nPresident Cannon smiled lopsidedly, the left side of his face refusing\nto make the effort. \"Arright,\" he said, in a low, blurred voice. \"Wha'\nhappen', Frang?\"\n\n\"Apparently,\" said Dr. Frank carefully, \"you've had a little bit of a\nstroke, kid. Nothing to worry about. How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Funny. Li'l dizzy. Don't hurt, though.\"\n\n\"Good. Fine. You'll be O.K. shortly.\"\n\nThe President's voice became stronger. \"I'm glad you're here, Frank.\nTell me--is it ... bad?\"\n\n\"'Tain't good, kid,\" Dr. Frank said with a bedside grin. \"You can't\nexpect a stroke to put you in the best of health, now, can you?\"\n\nThe lopsided smile came back. \"Guess not.\" The smile went away, to be\nreplaced by a puzzled frown. \"My whole left side feels dead. What's the\nmatter?\"\n\nInstead of answering, Dr. Frank Cannon turned to the Navy medic. \"I'll\nlet the commander explain that. What's your diagnosis, doctor?\"\n\nThe commander ran his tongue nervously over his lips before speaking.\n\"There's apparently a small blood clot in the brain, Mr. President,\ninterfering with the functioning of the efferent nerves.\"\n\n\"Permanent?\"\n\n\"We don't know yet, sir. We hope not.\"\n\nPresident Cannon sighed. \"Well. Thank you, commander. And now, if you\ndon't mind, I'd like to speak to my brother--alone.\"\n\nThe commander glanced at Dr. Frank, then back at the President.\n\"Certainly, sir.\" He turned to leave.\n\n\"Just a moment, commander,\" Dr. Frank said. \"There'll be news reporters\nout there. Tell them--\" He frowned a little. \"Tell them that the\nPresident is conscious and quite rational, but that there is still some\nweakness. I don't think anything more than that will be necessary.\"\n\n\"I agree. Certainly, doctor.\" At the door, the commander paused and\nsaid: \"I'll keep everyone out until you call.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Dr. Frank as the door closed behind the Navy man.\n\nAs soon as it closed, President Cannon struggled to get up.\n\n\"Don't try it, kid,\" the doctor said, \"those muscles are paralyzed, even\nif you aren't sick. Here, let me help you.\"\n\n\"How did it come off?\" Cannon asked as his brother propped him up.\n\n\"Perfectly. No one doubts that it's a stroke. Now what?\"\n\n\"Give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"All right, but watch it. Use your right hand, and smoke with the right\nside of your mouth. Here.\" The doctor lit a cigarette and handed it to\nhis brother. \"Now, what's the next step?\"\n\n\"The next step is to tell Matthew Fisher,\" said the President.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Frank Cannon scowled. \"Why? Why not just go through with the thing\nand let him be fooled along with the rest? It seems to me he'd be ...\nwell, more secure in his own position if he didn't know.\"\n\n\"No.\" The President hunched himself up on his pillows. \"Can't you raise\nthe head of this bed?\"\n\nDr. Frank touched a button on the bedside panel, and the upper portion\nof the bed rose smoothly at an angle. \"Better?\"\n\n\"Fine. Much better.\"\n\n\"You were saying--\"\n\n\"Yeah. About Matt Fisher. He has to know. He'll guess eventually, in the\nnext four years, anyway--unless I hide away somewhere. And I have no\nintention of doing that.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not trying to show Matt what a great guy I am, Frank. You know\nbetter than that, and so will he. But Matt will have to have all the\nfacts at hand, if he's to do his job right, and it seems to me that this\nis a pretty important fact. What do you say, Frank?\"\n\nThe doctor nodded slowly. \"I think you know more about the situation\nthan I do. And I trust your judgment, kid. And Matt's, too, I guess.\"\n\n\"No.\" President Cannon's voice was firm as he looked at his brother\nwith one bright eye. \"Don't trust Matt's judgment, because he doesn't\nhave any.\"\n\nDr. Frank looked astonished. \"Then _what_--?\" He stopped.\n\n\"Matthew Fisher,\" said President Cannon authoritatively, \"doesn't need\njudgment any more than _you_ need instinct. No more so, and no less. I\nsaid he doesn't have any judgment, but that's not exactly true. He has\nit, but he only uses it for routine work, just as you or I use instinct.\nWe can override our instinctive reactions when we have to. Matt can\noverride his judgment when he has to.\n\n\"I don't pretend to know how Fisher's mind works. If I did, I wouldn't\nbe doing this. But I _do_ know that Matt Fisher--by some mental process\nI can't even fathom--almost invariably knows the _right_ thing to do,\nand he knows it without using judgment.\"\n\n\"And you're still convinced that this is the only way out?\" Dr. Frank\nasked. \"Couldn't you stay in office and let him run things under cover?\"\n\n\"We discussed all this months ago, Frank,\" Cannon said wearily. \"My\nreasons remain the same. Matt couldn't possibly operate efficiently if\nhe had to go through me every time. And I am human, too; I'd have a\ntendency to impose my own judgment on his decisions.\n\n\"No, Frank; this is the only way it can work. This country needs Matthew\nFisher as President, but he could never have been elected. Now I've done\nmy job; now it's time for me to get out of the way and turn the\nPresidency over to a man who can handle the office far better than any\nother man I know.\"\n\n\"You make him sound like some sort of superman,\" said Dr. Frank with a\nwry grin.\n\n\"Hell,\" said President Cannon, \"you don't think I'd turn this job over\nto anything less, do you?\" He chuckled. \"Call him in, will you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n        PRESIDENT CANNON RESIGNS!\n       Ill Health Given As Reason;\n          Doctors Say Recovery\n        Unlikely In Near Future.\n    VP Fisher To Take Oath Tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact and Science\n    Fiction_ February 1962.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
