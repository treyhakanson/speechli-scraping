DICK\n\n\n    _Nothing moved or stirred. Everything was silent, dead. Only the gun\n    showed signs of life ... and the trespassers had wrecked that for\n    all time. The return journey to pick up the treasure would be a\n    cinch ... they smiled._\n\n\nThe Captain peered into the eyepiece of the telescope. He adjusted the\nfocus quickly.\n\n\"It was an atomic fission we saw, all right,\" he said presently. He\nsighed and pushed the eyepiece away. \"Any of you who wants to look may\ndo so. But it's not a pretty sight.\"\n\n\"Let me look,\" Tance the archeologist said. He bent down to look,\nsquinting. \"Good Lord!\" He leaped violently back, knocking against\nDorle, the Chief Navigator.\n\n\"Why did we come all this way, then?\" Dorle asked, looking around at the\nother men. \"There's no point even in landing. Let's go back at once.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's right,\" the biologist murmured. \"But I'd like to look for\nmyself, if I may.\" He pushed past Tance and peered into the sight.\n\nHe saw a vast expanse, an endless surface of gray, stretching to the\nedge of the planet. At first he thought it was water but after a moment\nhe realized that it was slag, pitted, fused slag, broken only by hills\nof rock jutting up at intervals. Nothing moved or stirred. Everything\nwas silent, dead.\n\n\"I see,\" Fomar said, backing away from the eyepiece. \"Well, I won't find\nany legumes there.\" He tried to smile, but his lips stayed unmoved. He\nstepped away and stood by himself, staring past the others.\n\n\"I wonder what the atmospheric sample will show,\" Tance said.\n\n\"I think I can guess,\" the Captain answered. \"Most of the atmosphere is\npoisoned. But didn't we expect all this? I don't see why we're so\nsurprised. A fission visible as far away as our system must be a\nterrible thing.\"\n\nHe strode off down the corridor, dignified and expressionless. They\nwatched him disappear into the control room.\n\nAs the Captain closed the door the young woman turned. \"What did the\ntelescope show? Good or bad?\"\n\n\"Bad. No life could possibly exist. Atmosphere poisoned, water\nvaporized, all the land fused.\"\n\n\"Could they have gone underground?\"\n\nThe Captain slid back the port window so that the surface of the planet\nunder them was visible. The two of them stared down, silent and\ndisturbed. Mile after mile of unbroken ruin stretched out, blackened\nslag, pitted and scarred, and occasional heaps of rock.\n\nSuddenly Nasha jumped. \"Look! Over there, at the edge. Do you see it?\"\n\nThey stared. Something rose up, not rock, not an accidental formation.\nIt was round, a circle of dots, white pellets on the dead skin of the\nplanet. A city? Buildings of some kind?\n\n\"Please turn the ship,\" Nasha said excitedly. She pushed her dark hair\nfrom her face. \"Turn the ship and let's see what it is!\"\n\nThe ship turned, changing its course. As they came over the white dots\nthe Captain lowered the ship, dropping it down as much as he dared.\n\"Piers,\" he said. \"Piers of some sort of stone. Perhaps poured\nartificial stone. The remains of a city.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" Nasha murmured. \"How awful.\" She watched the ruins disappear\nbehind them. In a half-circle the white squares jutted from the slag,\nchipped and cracked, like broken teeth.\n\n\"There's nothing alive,\" the Captain said at last. \"I think we'll go\nright back; I know most of the crew want to. Get the Government\nReceiving Station on the sender and tell them what we found, and that\nwe--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe staggered.\n\nThe first atomic shell had struck the ship, spinning it around. The\nCaptain fell to the floor, crashing into the control table. Papers and\ninstruments rained down on him. As he started to his feet the second\nshell struck. The ceiling cracked open, struts and girders twisted and\nbent. The ship shuddered, falling suddenly down, then righting itself as\nautomatic controls took over.\n\nThe Captain lay on the floor by the smashed control board. In the corner\nNasha struggled to free herself from the debris.\n\nOutside the men were already sealing the gaping leaks in the side of the\nship, through which the precious air was rushing, dissipating into the\nvoid beyond. \"Help me!\" Dorle was shouting. \"Fire over here, wiring\nignited.\" Two men came running. Tance watched helplessly, his eyeglasses\nbroken and bent.\n\n\"So there is life here, after all,\" he said, half to himself. \"But how\ncould--\"\n\n\"Give us a hand,\" Fomar said, hurrying past. \"Give us a hand, we've got\nto land the ship!\"\n\nIt was night. A few stars glinted above them, winking through the\ndrifting silt that blew across the surface of the planet.\n\nDorle peered out, frowning. \"What a place to be stuck in.\" He resumed\nhis work, hammering the bent metal hull of the ship back into place. He\nwas wearing a pressure suit; there were still many small leaks, and\nradioactive particles from the atmosphere had already found their way\ninto the ship.\n\nNasha and Fomar were sitting at the table in the control room, pale and\nsolemn, studying the inventory lists.\n\n\"Low on carbohydrates,\" Fomar said. \"We can break down the stored fats\nif we want to, but--\"\n\n\"I wonder if we could find anything outside.\" Nasha went to the window.\n\"How uninviting it looks.\" She paced back and forth, very slender and\nsmall, her face dark with fatigue. \"What do you suppose an exploring\nparty would find?\"\n\nFomar shrugged. \"Not much. Maybe a few weeds growing in cracks here and\nthere. Nothing we could use. Anything that would adapt to this\nenvironment would be toxic, lethal.\"\n\nNasha paused, rubbing her cheek. There was a deep scratch there, still\nred and swollen. \"Then how do you explain--_it_? According to your\ntheory the inhabitants must have died in their skins, fried like yams.\nBut who fired on us? Somebody detected us, made a decision, aimed a\ngun.\"\n\n\"And gauged distance,\" the Captain said feebly from the cot in the\ncorner. He turned toward them. \"That's the part that worries me. The\nfirst shell put us out of commission, the second almost destroyed us.\nThey were well aimed, perfectly aimed. We're not such an easy target.\"\n\n\"True.\" Fomar nodded. \"Well, perhaps we'll know the answer before we\nleave here. What a strange situation! All our reasoning tells us that no\nlife could exist; the whole planet burned dry, the atmosphere itself\ngone, completely poisoned.\"\n\n\"The gun that fired the projectiles survived,\" Nasha said. \"Why not\npeople?\"\n\n\"It's not the same. Metal doesn't need air to breathe. Metal doesn't get\nleukemia from radioactive particles. Metal doesn't need food and water.\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"A paradox,\" Nasha said. \"Anyhow, in the morning I think we should send\nout a search party. And meanwhile we should keep on trying to get the\nship in condition for the trip back.\"\n\n\"It'll be days before we can take off,\" Fomar said. \"We should keep\nevery man working here. We can't afford to send out a party.\"\n\nNasha smiled a little. \"We'll send you in the first party. Maybe you can\ndiscover--what was it you were so interested in?\"\n\n\"Legumes. Edible legumes.\"\n\n\"Maybe you can find some of them. Only--\"\n\n\"Only what?\"\n\n\"Only watch out. They fired on us once without even knowing who we were\nor what we came for. Do you suppose that they fought with each other?\nPerhaps they couldn't imagine anyone being friendly, under any\ncircumstances. What a strange evolutionary trait, inter-species warfare.\nFighting within the race!\"\n\n\"We'll know in the morning,\" Fomar said. \"Let's get some sleep.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun came up chill and austere. The three people, two men and a\nwoman, stepped through the port, dropping down on the hard ground below.\n\n\"What a day,\" Dorle said grumpily. \"I said how glad I'd be to walk on\nfirm ground again, but--\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Nasha said. \"Up beside me. I want to say something to you.\nWill you excuse us, Tance?\"\n\nTance nodded gloomily. Dorle caught up with Nasha. They walked together,\ntheir metal shoes crunching the ground underfoot. Nasha glanced at him.\n\n\"Listen. The Captain is dying. No one knows except the two of us. By the\nend of the day-period of this planet he'll be dead. The shock did\nsomething to his heart. He was almost sixty, you know.\"\n\nDorle nodded. \"That's bad. I have a great deal of respect for him. You\nwill be captain in his place, of course. Since you're vice-captain\nnow--\"\n\n\"No. I prefer to see someone else lead, perhaps you or Fomar. I've been\nthinking over the situation and it seems to me that I should declare\nmyself mated to one of you, whichever of you wants to be captain. Then I\ncould devolve the responsibility.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to be captain. Let Fomar do it.\"\n\nNasha studied him, tall and blond, striding along beside her in his\npressure suit. \"I'm rather partial to you,\" she said. \"We might try it\nfor a time, at least. But do as you like. Look, we're coming to\nsomething.\"\n\nThey stopped walking, letting Tance catch up. In front of them was some\nsort of a ruined building. Dorle stared around thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do you see? This whole place is a natural bowl, a huge valley. See how\nthe rock formations rise up on all sides, protecting the floor. Maybe\nsome of the great blast was deflected here.\"\n\nThey wandered around the ruins, picking up rocks and fragments. \"I think\nthis was a farm,\" Tance said, examining a piece of wood. \"This was part\nof a tower windmill.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Nasha took the stick and turned it over. \"Interesting. But\nlet's go; we don't have much time.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Dorle said suddenly. \"Off there, a long way off. Isn't that\nsomething?\" He pointed.\n\nNasha sucked in her breath. \"The white stones.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nNasha looked up at Dorle. \"The white stones, the great broken teeth. We\nsaw them, the Captain and I, from the control room.\" She touched Dorle's\narm gently. \"That's where they fired from. I didn't think we had landed\nso close.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Tance said, coming up to them. \"I'm almost blind without\nmy glasses. What do you see?\"\n\n\"The city. Where they fired from.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" All three of them stood together. \"Well, let's go,\" Tance said.\n\"There's no telling what we'll find there.\" Dorle frowned at him.\n\n\"Wait. We don't know what we would be getting into. They must have\npatrols. They probably have seen us already, for that matter.\"\n\n\"They probably have seen the ship itself,\" Tance said. \"They probably\nknow right now where they can find it, where they can blow it up. So\nwhat difference does it make whether we go closer or not?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Nasha said. \"If they really want to get us we haven't a\nchance. We have no armaments at all; you know that.\"\n\n\"I have a hand weapon.\" Dorle nodded. \"Well, let's go on, then. I\nsuppose you're right, Tance.\"\n\n\"But let's stay together,\" Tance said nervously. \"Nasha, you're going\ntoo fast.\"\n\nNasha looked back. She laughed. \"If we expect to get there by nightfall\nwe must go fast.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey reached the outskirts of the city at about the middle of the\nafternoon. The sun, cold and yellow, hung above them in the colorless\nsky. Dorle stopped at the top of a ridge overlooking the city.\n\n\"Well, there it is. What's left of it.\"\n\nThere was not much left. The huge concrete piers which they had noticed\nwere not piers at all, but the ruined foundations of buildings. They had\nbeen baked by the searing heat, baked and charred almost to the ground.\nNothing else remained, only this irregular circle of white squares,\nperhaps four miles in diameter.\n\nDorle spat in disgust. \"More wasted time. A dead skeleton of a city,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"But it was from here that the firing came,\" Tance murmured. \"Don't\nforget that.\"\n\n\"And by someone with a good eye and a great deal of experience,\" Nasha\nadded. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThey walked into the city between the ruined buildings. No one spoke.\nThey walked in silence, listening to the echo of their footsteps.\n\n\"It's macabre,\" Dorle muttered. \"I've seen ruined cities before but they\ndied of old age, old age and fatigue. This was killed, seared to death.\nThis city didn't die--it was murdered.\"\n\n\"I wonder what the city was called,\" Nasha said. She turned aside, going\nup the remains of a stairway from one of the foundations. \"Do you think\nwe might find a signpost? Some kind of plaque?\"\n\nShe peered into the ruins.\n\n\"There's nothing there,\" Dorle said impatiently. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Nasha bent down, touching a concrete stone. \"There's something\ninscribed on this.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Tance hurried up. He squatted in the dust, running his\ngloved fingers over the surface of the stone. \"Letters, all right.\" He\ntook a writing stick from the pocket of his pressure suit and copied the\ninscription on a bit of paper. Dorle glanced over his shoulder. The\ninscription was:\n\n    FRANKLIN APARTMENTS\n\n\"That's this city,\" Nasha said softly. \"That was its name.\"\n\nTance put the paper in his pocket and they went on. After a time Dorle\nsaid, \"Nasha, you know, I think we're being watched. But don't look\naround.\"\n\nThe woman stiffened. \"Oh? Why do you say that? Did you see something?\"\n\n\"No. I can feel it, though. Don't you?\"\n\nNasha smiled a little. \"I feel nothing, but perhaps I'm more used to\nbeing stared at.\" She turned her head slightly. \"Oh!\"\n\nDorle reached for his hand weapon. \"What is it? What do you see?\" Tance\nhad stopped dead in his tracks, his mouth half open.\n\n\"The gun,\" Nasha said. \"It's the gun.\"\n\n\"Look at the size of it. The size of the thing.\" Dorle unfastened his\nhand weapon slowly. \"That's it, all right.\"\n\nThe gun was huge. Stark and immense it pointed up at the sky, a mass of\nsteel and glass, set in a huge slab of concrete. Even as they watched\nthe gun moved on its swivel base, whirring underneath. A slim vane\nturned with the wind, a network of rods atop a high pole.\n\n\"It's alive,\" Nasha whispered. \"It's listening to us, watching us.\"\n\nThe gun moved again, this time clockwise. It was mounted so that it\ncould make a full circle. The barrel lowered a trifle, then resumed its\noriginal position.\n\n\"But who fires it?\" Tance said.\n\nDorle laughed. \"No one. No one fires it.\"\n\nThey stared at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It fires itself.\"\n\nThey couldn't believe him. Nasha came close to him, frowning, looking up\nat him. \"I don't understand. What do you mean, it fires itself?\"\n\n\"Watch, I'll show you. Don't move.\" Dorle picked up a rock from the\nground. He hesitated a moment and then tossed the rock high in the air.\nThe rock passed in front of the gun. Instantly the great barrel moved,\nthe vanes contracted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rock fell to the ground. The gun paused, then resumed its calm\nswivel, its slow circling.\n\n\"You see,\" Dorle said, \"it noticed the rock, as soon as I threw it up in\nthe air. It's alert to anything that flies or moves above the ground\nlevel. Probably it detected us as soon as we entered the gravitational\nfield of the planet. It probably had a bead on us from the start. We\ndon't have a chance. It knows all about the ship. It's just waiting for\nus to take off again.\"\n\n\"I understand about the rock,\" Nasha said, nodding. \"The gun noticed it,\nbut not us, since we're on the ground, not above. It's only designed to\ncombat objects in the sky. The ship is safe until it takes off again,\nthen the end will come.\"\n\n\"But what's this gun for?\" Tance put in. \"There's no one alive here.\nEveryone is dead.\"\n\n\"It's a machine,\" Dorle said. \"A machine that was made to do a job. And\nit's doing the job. How it survived the blast I don't know. On it goes,\nwaiting for the enemy. Probably they came by air in some sort of\nprojectiles.\"\n\n\"The enemy,\" Nasha said. \"Their own race. It is hard to believe that\nthey really bombed themselves, fired at themselves.\"\n\n\"Well, it's over with. Except right here, where we're standing. This one\ngun, still alert, ready to kill. It'll go on until it wears out.\"\n\n\"And by that time we'll be dead,\" Nasha said bitterly.\n\n\"There must have been hundreds of guns like this,\" Dorle murmured. \"They\nmust have been used to the sight, guns, weapons, uniforms. Probably they\naccepted it as a natural thing, part of their lives, like eating and\nsleeping. An institution, like the church and the state. Men trained to\nfight, to lead armies, a regular profession. Honored, respected.\"\n\nTance was walking slowly toward the gun, peering nearsightedly up at it.\n\"Quite complex, isn't it? All those vanes and tubes. I suppose this is\nsome sort of a telescopic sight.\" His gloved hand touched the end of a\nlong tube.\n\nInstantly the gun shifted, the barrel retracting. It swung--\n\n\"Don't move!\" Dorle cried. The barrel swung past them as they stood,\nrigid and still. For one terrible moment it hesitated over their heads,\nclicking and whirring, settling into position. Then the sounds died out\nand the gun became silent.\n\nTance smiled foolishly inside his helmet. \"I must have put my finger\nover the lens. I'll be more careful.\" He made his way up onto the\ncircular slab, stepping gingerly behind the body of the gun. He\ndisappeared from view.\n\n\"Where did he go?\" Nasha said irritably. \"He'll get us all killed.\"\n\n\"Tance, come back!\" Dorle shouted. \"What's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"In a minute.\" There was a long silence. At last the archeologist\nappeared. \"I think I've found something. Come up and I'll show you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Dorle, you said the gun was here to keep the enemy off. I think I know\nwhy they wanted to keep the enemy off.\"\n\nThey were puzzled.\n\n\"I think I've found what the gun is supposed to guard. Come and give me\na hand.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Dorle said abruptly. \"Let's go.\" He seized Nasha's hand.\n\"Come on. Let's see what he's found. I thought something like this might\nhappen when I saw that the gun was--\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Nasha pulled her hand away. \"What are you talking about?\nYou act as if you knew what he's found.\"\n\n\"I do.\" Dorle smiled down at her. \"Do you remember the legend that all\nraces have, the myth of the buried treasure, and the dragon, the serpent\nthat watches it, guards it, keeping everyone away?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Well?\"\n\nDorle pointed up at the gun.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"is the dragon. Come on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetween the three of them they managed to pull up the steel cover and\nlay it to one side. Dorle was wet with perspiration when they finished.\n\n\"It isn't worth it,\" he grunted. He stared into the dark yawning hole.\n\"Or is it?\"\n\nNasha clicked on her hand lamp, shining the beam down the stairs. The\nsteps were thick with dust and rubble. At the bottom was a steel door.\n\n\"Come on,\" Tance said excitedly. He started down the stairs. They\nwatched him reach the door and pull hopefully on it without success.\n\"Give a hand!\"\n\n\"All right.\" They came gingerly after him. Dorle examined the door. It\nwas bolted shut, locked. There was an inscription on the door but he\ncould not read it.\n\n\"Now what?\" Nasha said.\n\nDorle took out his hand weapon. \"Stand back. I can't think of any other\nway.\" He pressed the switch. The bottom of the door glowed red.\nPresently it began to crumble. Dorle clicked the weapon off. \"I think we\ncan get through. Let's try.\"\n\nThe door came apart easily. In a few minutes they had carried it away in\npieces and stacked the pieces on the first step. Then they went on,\nflashing the light ahead of them.\n\nThey were in a vault. Dust lay everywhere, on everything, inches thick.\nWood crates lined the walls, huge boxes and crates, packages and\ncontainers. Tance looked around curiously, his eyes bright.\n\n\"What exactly are all these?\" he murmured. \"Something valuable, I would\nthink.\" He picked up a round drum and opened it. A spool fell to the\nfloor, unwinding a black ribbon. He examined it, holding it up to the\nlight.\n\n\"Look at this!\"\n\nThey came around him. \"Pictures,\" Nasha said. \"Tiny pictures.\"\n\n\"Records of some kind.\" Tance closed the spool up in the drum again.\n\"Look, hundreds of drums.\" He flashed the light around. \"And those\ncrates. Let's open one.\"\n\nDorle was already prying at the wood. The wood had turned brittle and\ndry. He managed to pull a section away.\n\nIt was a picture. A boy in a blue garment, smiling pleasantly, staring\nahead, young and handsome. He seemed almost alive, ready to move toward\nthem in the light of the hand lamp. It was one of them, one of the\nruined race, the race that had perished.\n\nFor a long time they stared at the picture. At last Dorle replaced the\nboard.\n\n\"All these other crates,\" Nasha said. \"More pictures. And these drums.\nWhat are in the boxes?\"\n\n\"This is their treasure,\" Tance said, almost to himself. \"Here are their\npictures, their records. Probably all their literature is here, their\nstories, their myths, their ideas about the universe.\"\n\n\"And their history,\" Nasha said. \"We'll be able to trace their\ndevelopment and find out what it was that made them become what they\nwere.\"\n\nDorle was wandering around the vault. \"Odd,\" he murmured. \"Even at the\nend, even after they had begun to fight they still knew, someplace down\ninside them, that their real treasure was this, their books and\npictures, their myths. Even after their big cities and buildings and\nindustries were destroyed they probably hoped to come back and find\nthis. After everything else was gone.\"\n\n\"When we get back home we can agitate for a mission to come here,\" Tance\nsaid. \"All this can be loaded up and taken back. We'll be leaving\nabout--\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dorle said dryly. \"We'll be leaving about three day-periods from\nnow. We'll fix the ship, then take off. Soon we'll be home, that is, if\nnothing happens. Like being shot down by that--\"\n\n\"Oh, stop it!\" Nasha said impatiently. \"Leave him alone. He's right: all\nthis must be taken back home, sooner or later. We'll have to solve the\nproblem of the gun. We have no choice.\"\n\nDorle nodded. \"What's your solution, then? As soon as we leave the\nground we'll be shot down.\" His face twisted bitterly. \"They've guarded\ntheir treasure too well. Instead of being preserved it will lie here\nuntil it rots. It serves them right.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Don't you see? This was the only way they knew, building a gun and\nsetting it up to shoot anything that came along. They were so certain\nthat everything was hostile, the enemy, coming to take their possessions\naway from them. Well, they can keep them.\"\n\nNasha was deep in thought, her mind far away. Suddenly she gasped.\n\"Dorle,\" she said. \"What's the matter with us? We have no problem. The\ngun is no menace at all.\"\n\nThe two men stared at her.\n\n\"No menace?\" Dorle said. \"It's already shot us down once. And as soon as\nwe take off again--\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" Nasha began to laugh. \"The poor foolish gun, it's\ncompletely harmless. Even I could deal with it alone.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\nHer eyes were flashing. \"With a crowbar. With a hammer or a stick of\nwood. Let's go back to the ship and load up. Of course we're at its\nmercy in the air: that's the way it was made. It can fire into the sky,\nshoot down anything that flies. But that's all! Against something on the\nground it has no defenses. Isn't that right?\"\n\nDorle nodded slowly. \"The soft underbelly of the dragon. In the legend,\nthe dragon's armor doesn't cover its stomach.\" He began to laugh.\n\"That's right. That's perfectly right.\"\n\n\"Let's go, then,\" Nasha said. \"Let's get back to the ship. We have work\nto do here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was early the next morning when they reached the ship. During the\nnight the Captain had died, and the crew had ignited his body, according\nto custom. They had stood solemnly around it until the last ember died.\nAs they were going back to their work the woman and the two men\nappeared, dirty and tired, still excited.\n\nAnd presently, from the ship, a line of people came, each carrying\nsomething in his hands. The line marched across the gray slag, the\neternal expanse of fused metal. When they reached the weapon they all\nfell on the gun at once, with crowbars, hammers, anything that was heavy\nand hard.\n\nThe telescopic sights shattered into bits. The wiring was pulled out,\ntorn to shreds. The delicate gears were smashed, dented.\n\nFinally the warheads themselves were carried off and the firing pins\nremoved.\n\nThe gun was smashed, the great weapon destroyed. The people went down\ninto the vault and examined the treasure. With its metal-armored\nguardian dead there was no danger any longer. They studied the pictures,\nthe films, the crates of books, the jeweled crowns, the cups, the\nstatues.\n\nAt last, as the sun was dipping into the gray mists that drifted across\nthe planet they came back up the stairs again. For a moment they stood\naround the wrecked gun looking at the unmoving outline of it.\n\nThen they started back to the ship. There was still much work to be\ndone. The ship had been badly hurt, much had been damaged and lost. The\nimportant thing was to repair it as quickly as possible, to get it into\nthe air.\n\nWith all of them working together it took just five more days to make it\nspaceworthy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNasha stood in the control room, watching the planet fall away behind\nthem. She folded her arms, sitting down on the edge of the table.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" Dorle said.\n\n\"I? Nothing.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I was thinking that there must have been a time when this planet was\nquite different, when there was life on it.\"\n\n\"I suppose there was. It's unfortunate that no ships from our system\ncame this far, but then we had no reason to suspect intelligent life\nuntil we saw the fission glow in the sky.\"\n\n\"And then it was too late.\"\n\n\"Not quite too late. After all, their possessions, their music, books,\ntheir pictures, all of that will survive. We'll take them home and study\nthem, and they'll change us. We won't be the same afterwards. Their\nsculpturing, especially. Did you see the one of the great winged\ncreature, without a head or arms? Broken off, I suppose. But those\nwings-- It looked very old. It will change us a great deal.\"\n\n\"When we come back we won't find the gun waiting for us,\" Nasha said.\n\"Next time it won't be there to shoot us down. We can land and take the\ntreasure, as you call it.\" She smiled up at Dorle. \"You'll lead us back\nthere, as a good captain should.\"\n\n\"Captain?\" Dorle grinned. \"Then you've decided.\"\n\nNasha shrugged. \"Fomar argues with me too much. I think, all in all, I\nreally prefer you.\"\n\n\"Then let's go,\" Dorle said. \"Let's go back home.\"\n\nThe ship roared up, flying over the ruins of the city. It turned in a\nhuge arc and then shot off beyond the horizon, heading into outer space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDown below, in the center of the ruined city, a single half-broken\ndetector vane moved slightly, catching the roar of the ship. The base of\nthe great gun throbbed painfully, straining to turn. After a moment a\nred warning light flashed on down inside its destroyed works.\n\nAnd a long way off, a hundred miles from the city, another warning light\nflashed on, far underground. Automatic relays flew into action. Gears\nturned, belts whined. On the ground above a section of metal slag\nslipped back. A ramp appeared.\n\nA moment later a small cart rushed to the surface.\n\nThe cart turned toward the city. A second cart appeared behind it. It\nwas loaded with wiring cables. Behind it a third cart came, loaded with\ntelescopic tube sights. And behind came more carts, some with relays,\nsome with firing controls, some with tools and parts, screws and bolts,\npins and nuts. The final one contained atomic warheads.\n\nThe carts lined up behind the first one, the lead cart. The lead cart\nstarted off, across the frozen ground, bumping calmly along, followed by\nthe others. Moving toward the city.\n\nTo the damaged gun.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ September 1952.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
