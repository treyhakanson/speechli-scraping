Y.\n\n\n\n\n             Earth was too perfect for these extraordinary\n             exiles--to belong to it, they had to flee it!\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLight flickered. It was uncomfortably bright.\n\nDoctor Cameron gazed intently at the top of the desk. It wasn't easy\nto be diplomatic. \"The request was turned over to the Medicouncil,\" he\nsaid. \"I assure you it was studied thoroughly before it was reported\nback to the Solar Committee.\"\n\nDocchi edged forward, his face alight with anticipation.\n\nThe doctor kept his eyes averted. The man was damnably\ndisconcerting--had no right to be alive. In the depths of the sea there\nwere certain creatures like him and on a warm summer evening there was\nstill another parallel, but never any human with such an infirmity.\n\"I'm afraid you know what the answer is. A flat no for the present.\"\n\nDocchi sagged and his arms hung limp. \"That's the answer?\"\n\n\"It's not as hopeless as you think. Decisions can be changed. It won't\nbe the first time.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Docchi. \"We'll wait and wait until it's finally changed.\nWe've got centuries, haven't we?\" His face was blazing. It had slipped\nout of control though he wasn't aware of it. Beneath the skin certain\ncells had been modified, there were substances in his body that the\nordinary individual didn't have. And when there was an extreme flow of\nnervous energy the response was--light. His metabolism was akin to that\nof a firefly.\n\nCameron meddled with buttons. It was impossible to keep the lighting at\na decent level. Docchi was a nuisance.\n\n\"Why?\" questioned Docchi. \"We're capable, you know that. How could they\nrefuse?\"\n\nThat was something he didn't want asked because there was no answer\nboth of them would accept. Sometimes a blunt reply was the best\nevasion. \"Do you think they'd take you? Or Nona, Jordan, or Anti?\"\n\nDocchi winced, his arms quivering uselessly. \"Maybe not. But we told\nyou we're willing to let experts decide. There's nearly a thousand of\nus. They should be able to get one qualified crew.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I'm not going to say.\" Cameron abandoned the light as beyond\nhis control. \"Most of you are biocompensators. I concede it's a factor\nin your favor. But you must realize there are many things against you.\"\nHe squinted at the desk top. Below the solid surface there was a drawer\nand in the drawer there was--that was what he was trying to see or\ndetermine. The more he looked the less clear anything seemed to be. He\ntried to make his voice crisp and professional. \"You're wasting time\ndiscussing this with me. I've merely passed the decision on. I'm not\nresponsible for it and I can't do anything for you.\"\n\nDocchi stood up, his face colorless and bright. But the inner\nillumination was no indication of hope.\n\nDoctor Cameron looked at him directly for the first time. It wasn't\nas bad as he expected. \"I suggest you calm down. Be patient and wait.\nYou'll be surprised how often you get what you want.\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised how we get what we want,\" said Docchi. He turned\naway, lurching toward the door which opened automatically and closed\nbehind him.\n\nAgain Cameron concentrated on the desk, trying to look through it.\nHe wrote down the sequence he expected to find, lingering over it to\nmake sure he didn't force the pictures that came into his mind. He\nopened the drawer and compared the Rhine cards with what he'd written,\nfrowning in disappointment. No matter how he tried he never got better\nthan average results. Perhaps there was something to telepathy but he'd\nnever found it. Anyway it was clear he wasn't one of the gifted few.\n\nHe shut the drawer. It was a private game, a method to keep from\nbecoming involved in Docchi's problems, to avoid emotional entanglement\nwith people he had nothing in common with. He didn't enjoy depriving\nweak and helpless men and women of what little hope they had. It was\ntheir lack of strength that made them so difficult to handle.\n\nHe reached for the telecom. \"Get Medicouncilor Thorton,\" he told the\noperator. \"Direct if you can; indirect if you have to. I'll hold on.\"\n\nApproximate mean diameter thirty miles, the asteroid was listed on the\ncharts as Handicap Haven with a mark that indicated except in emergency\nno one not authorized was to land there. Those who were confined to it\nwere willing to admit they were handicapped but they didn't call it\nhaven. They used other terms, none suggesting sanctuary.\n\nIt was a hospital, of course, but even more it was a convalescent\nhome--the permanent kind. Healthy and vigorous humanity had reserved\nthe remote planetoid, a whirling bleak rock of no other value, and\nbuilt large installations there for less fortunate people. It was a\nnoble gesture but like many gestures the reality fell short of the\nintentions. And not many people outside the Haven itself realized\nwherein it was a failure.\n\nThe robot operator broke into his thoughts. \"Medicouncilor Thorton has\nbeen located.\"\n\nAn older man looked out of the screen, competent, forceful. \"I'm on\nmy way to the satellites of Jupiter. I'll be in direct range for\nthe next half hour.\" At such distances transmission and reception\nwere practically instantaneous. Cameron was assured of uninterrupted\nconversation. \"It's a good thing you called. Have you got the Solar\nCommittee reply?\"\n\n\"This morning. I saw no reason to hold it up. I just finished giving\nDocchi the news.\"\n\n\"Dispatch. I like that. Get the disagreeable job done with.\" The\nmedicouncilor searched through the desk in front of him without\nsuccess. \"Never mind. I'll find the information later. Now. How did\nDocchi react?\"\n\n\"He didn't like it. He was mad clear through.\"\n\n\"That speaks well for his bounce.\"\n\n\"They all have spirit. Nothing to use it on,\" said Dr. Cameron. \"I\nconfess I didn't look at him often though he was quite presentable,\neven handsome in a startling sort of way.\"\n\nThorton nodded brusquely. \"Presentable. Does that mean he had arms?\"\n\n\"Today he did. Is it important?\"\n\n\"I think so. He expected a favorable reply and wanted to look his\nbest, as nearly normal as possible. In view of that I'm surprised he\ndidn't threaten you.\"\n\nCameron tried to recall the incident. \"I think he did, mildly. He said\nsomething to the effect that I'd be surprised how _they_ got what they\nwanted.\"\n\n\"So you anticipate trouble. That's why you called?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I want your opinion.\"\n\n\"You're on the scene, doctor. You get the important nuances,\" said\nthe medicouncilor hastily. \"However it's my considered judgment they\nwon't start anything immediately. It takes time to get over the shock\nof refusal. They can't do anything. Individually they're helpless\nand collectively there aren't parts for a dozen sound bodies on the\nasteroid.\"\n\n\"I'll have to agree,\" said Dr. Cameron. \"But there's something that\nbothers me. I've looked over the records. No accidental has ever liked\nbeing here, and that covers quite a few years.\"\n\n\"Nobody appreciates the hospital until he's sick, doctor.\"\n\n\"I know. That's partly what's wrong. They're no longer ill and yet they\nhave to stay here. What worries me is that there's never been such open\ndiscontent as now.\"\n\n\"I hope I don't have to point out that someone's stirring them up. Find\nout who and keep a close watch. As a doctor you can find pretexts, a\ndifferent diet, a series of tests. You can keep the person coming to\nyou every day.\"\n\n\"I've found out. There's a self-elected group of four, Docchi, Nona,\nAnti and Jordan. I believe they're supposed to be the local recreation\ncommittee.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor smiled. \"An apt camouflage. It keeps them amused.\"\n\n\"I thought so too but now I'm convinced they're no longer harmless. I'd\nlike permission to break up the group. Humanely of course.\"\n\n\"I always welcome new ideas.\"\n\nIn spite of what he'd said the medicouncilor probably did have an open\nmind. \"Start with those it's possible to do the most with. Docchi,\nfor instance. With prosthetic arms, he appears normal except for that\nuncanny fluorescence. Granted that the last is repulsive to the average\nperson. We can't correct the condition medically but we can make it\ninto an asset.\"\n\n\"An asset? Very neat, if it can be done.\" The medicouncilor's\nexpression said it couldn't be.\n\n\"Gland opera,\" said Cameron, hurrying on. \"The most popular program\nin the solar system, telepaths, teleports, pyrotics and so forth the\nheroes. Fake of course, makeup and trick camera shots.\n\n\"But Docchi can be made into a real star. The death-ray man, say. When\nhis face shines men fall dead or paralyzed. He'd have a tremendous\nfollowing of kids.\"\n\n\"Children,\" mused the medicouncilor. \"Are you serious about exposing\nthem to his influence? Do you really want them to see him?\"\n\n\"He'd have a chance to return to society in a way that would be\nacceptable to him,\" said Cameron defensively. He shouldn't have\nspecifically mentioned kids.\n\n\"To him, perhaps,\" reflected the medicouncilor. \"It's an ingenious\nidea, doctor, one which does credit to your humanitarianism. But I'm\nafraid of the public's reception. Have you gone into Docchi's medical\nhistory?\"\n\n\"I glanced at it before I called him in.\" The man was unusual,\neven in a place that specialized in the abnormal. Docchi had been\nan electrochemical engineer with a degree in cold lighting. On his\nway to a brilliant career, he had been the victim of a particularly\nmessy accident. The details hadn't been described but Cameron could\nsupplement them with his imagination. He'd been badly mangled and\ntossed into a tank of the basic cold lighting fluid.\n\nThere was life left in the body; it flickered but never went entirely\nout. His arms were gone and his ribs were crushed into his spinal\ncolumn. Regeneration wasn't easy; a partial rib cage could be built up,\nbut no more than that. He had no shoulder muscles and only a minimum\nin his back and now, much later, that was why he tired easily and why\nthe prosthetic arms with which he'd been fitted were merely ornamental,\nthere was nothing which could move them.\n\nAnd then there was the cold lighting fluid. To begin with it was\nsemi-organic which, perhaps, was the reason he had remained alive so\nlong when he should have died. It had preserved him, had in part\nreplaced his blood, permeating every tissue. By the time Docchi had\nbeen found his body had adapted to the cold lighting substance. And the\nadaptation couldn't be reversed and it was self-perpetuating. Life was\nhardier than most men realized but occasionally it was also perverse.\n\n\"Then you know what he's like,\" said the medicouncilor, shaking his\nhead. \"Our profession can't sponsor such a freakish display of his\nmisfortune. No doubt he'd be successful on the program you mention. But\nthere's more to life than financial achievement or the rather peculiar\nadmiration that would be certain to follow him. As an actor he'd have a\nniche. But can you imagine, doctor, the dead silence that would occur\nwhen he walks into a social gathering of normal people?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Cameron, though he didn't--not eye to eye. He didn't\nagree with Thorton but there wasn't much he could do to alter the\nother's conviction at the moment. There was a long fight ahead of him.\n\"I'll forget about Docchi. But there's another way to break up the\ngroup.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor interrupted. \"Nona?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm not sure she really belongs here.\"\n\n\"Every young doctor thinks the same,\" said the medicouncilor kindly.\n\"Usually they wait until their term is nearly up before they suggest\nthat she'd respond better if she were returned to normal society. I\nthink I know what response they have in mind.\" Thorton smiled in a\nfatherly fashion. \"No offense, doctor, but it happens so often I'm\nthinking of inserting a note in our briefing program. Something to the\neffect that the new medical director should avoid the beautiful and\nself-possessed moron.\"\n\n\"Is she stupid?\" asked Cameron stubbornly. \"It's my impression that\nshe's not.\"\n\n\"Clever with her hands,\" agreed the medicouncilor. \"People in her\nmental classification, which is very low, sometimes are. But don't\nconfuse manual dexterity with intelligence. For one thing she doesn't\nhave the brain structure for the real article.\n\n\"She's definitely not normal. She can't talk or hear, and never will.\nHer larynx is missing and though we could replace it, it wouldn't\nhelp if we did. We'd have to change her entire brain structure to\naccommodate it and we're not that good at the present.\"\n\n\"I was thinking about the nerve dissimilarities,\" began Cameron.\n\n\"A superior mutation, is that what you were going to say? You can\nforget that. It's much more of an anomaly, in the nature of cleft\npalates, which were once common--poor pre-natal nutrition or traumas.\nThese we can correct rather easily but Nona is surgically beyond us.\nThere always is something beyond us, you know.\" The medicouncilor\nglanced at the chronometer beside him.\n\nCameron saw the time too but continued. It ought to be settled. It\nwould do no good to bring up Helen Keller; the medicouncilor would\nuse that evidence against him. The Keller techniques had been studied\nand reinterpreted for Nona's benefit. That much was in her medical\nrecord. They had been tried on Nona, and they hadn't worked. It made no\ndifference that he, Cameron, thought there were certain flaws in the\nway the old techniques had been applied. Thorton would not allow that\nthe previous practitioners could have been wrong. \"I've been wondering\nif we haven't tried to force her to conform. She can be intelligent\nwithout understanding what we say or knowing how to read and write.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded the medicouncilor. \"The most important tool humans\nhave is language. Through this we pass along all knowledge.\" Thorton\npaused, reflecting. \"Unless you're referring to this Gland Opera stuff\nyou mentioned. I believe you are, though personally I prefer to call it\nRhine Opera.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking of that,\" admitted Cameron. \"Maybe if there was\nsomeone else like her she wouldn't need to talk the way we do. Anyway\nI'd like to make some tests, with your permission. I'll need some new\nequipment.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor found the sheet he'd been looking for from time\nto time. He creased it absently. \"Go ahead with those tests if it\nwill make you feel better. I'll personally approve the requisition.\nIt doesn't mean you'll get everything you want. Others have to sign\ntoo. However you ought to know you're not the first to think she's\ntelepathic or something related to that phenomena.\"\n\n\"I've seen that in the record too. But I think I can be the first one\nto prove it.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're enthusiastic. But don't lose sight of the main\nobjective. Even if she _is_ telepathic, and so far as we're concerned\nshe's not, would she be better suited to life outside?\"\n\nHe had one answer--but the medicouncilor believed in another. \"Perhaps\nyou're right. She'll have to stay here no matter what happens.\"\n\n\"She will. It would solve your problems if you could break up the\ngroup, but don't count on it. You'll have to learn to manage them as\nthey are.\"\n\n\"I'll see that they don't cause any trouble,\" said Cameron.\n\n\"I'm sure you will.\" The medicouncilor's manner didn't ooze confidence.\n\"If you need help we can send in reinforcements.\"\n\n\"I don't anticipate that much difficulty,\" said Cameron hastily. \"I'll\nkeep them running around in circles.\"\n\n\"Confusion is the best policy,\" agreed the medicouncilor. He unfolded\nthe sheet and looked down at it. \"Oh yes, before it's too late I'd\nbetter tell you I'm sending details of new treatments for a number of\ndeficients----\"\n\nThe picture collapsed into meaningless swirls of color. For an instant\nthe voice was distinguishable again before it too was drowned by noise.\n\"Did you understand what I said, doctor? If it isn't clear contact me.\nDeviation can be fatal.\"\n\n\"I can't keep the ship in focus,\" said the robot. \"If you wish to\ncontinue the conversation it will have to be relayed through the\nnearest main station. At present that's Mars.\"\n\nIt was inconvenient to wait several minutes for each reply. Besides the\nmedicouncilor couldn't or wouldn't help him. He wanted the status quo\nmaintained; nothing else would satisfy him. It was the function of the\nmedical director to see that it was. \"We're through,\" said Cameron.\n\nHe sat there after the telecom clicked off. What were the deficients\nthe medicouncilor had talked about? A subdivision of the accidentals\nof course, but it wasn't a medical term he was familiar with. Probably\na semi-slang description. The medicouncilor had been associated with\naccidentals so long that he assumed every doctor would know at once\nwhat he meant.\n\nDeficients. Mentally Cameron turned the word over. If it was\nused accurately it could indicate only one thing. He'd see when\nthe medicouncilor's report came in. He could always ask for more\ninformation if it wasn't clear.\n\nThe doctor got heavily to his feet--and he actually was heavier. It\nwasn't a psychological reaction. He made a mental note of it. He'd have\nto investigate the gravity surge.\n\nIn a way accidentals were pathetic, patchwork humans, half or quarter\nmen and women, fractional organisms which masqueraded as people. The\nillusion died hard for them, harder than that which remained of their\nbodies, and those bodies were unbelievably tough. Medicine and surgery\nwere partly to blame. Techniques were too good or not good enough,\ndepending on the viewpoint--doctor or patient.\n\nToo good in that the most horribly injured person, if he were found\nalive, could be kept alive. Not good enough because a certain per cent\nof the injured couldn't be returned to society completely sound and\nwhole. The miracles of healing were incomplete.\n\nThere weren't many humans who were broken beyond repair, but though\nthe details varied in every respect, the results were monotonously\nthe same. For the most part disease had been eliminated. Everyone was\nhealthy--except those who'd been hurt in accidents and who couldn't be\nresurgeried and regenerated into the beautiful mold characteristic of\nthe entire population. And those few were sent to the asteroid.\n\nThey didn't like it. They didn't like being _confined_ to Handicap\nHaven. They were sensitive and they didn't want to go back. They knew\nhow conspicuous they'd be, hobbling and crawling among the multitudes\nof beautiful men and women who inhabited the planets. The accidentals\ndidn't want to return.\n\nWhat they did want was ridiculous. They had talked about, hoped, and\nfinally embodied it in a petition. They had requested rockets to make\nthe first long hard journey to Alpha and Proxima Centauri. Man was\nrestricted to the solar system and had no way of getting to even the\nnearest stars. They thought they could break through the barrier. Some\naccidentals would go and some would remain behind, lonelier except for\ntheir share in the dangerous enterprise.\n\nIt was a particularly uncontrollable form of self-deception. They were\nthe broken people, without a face they could call their own, who wore\ntheir hearts not on their sleeves but in a blood-pumping chamber, those\nwithout limbs or organs--or too many. The categories were endless. No\naccidental was like any other.\n\nThe self-deception was vicious precisely because the accidentals _were_\nqualified. Of all the billions of solar citizens _they alone could make\nthe long journey there and return_. But there were other factors that\nruled them out. It was never safe to discuss the first reason with them\nbecause the second would have to be explained. Cameron himself wasn't\nsadistic and no one else was interested enough to inform them.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nDocchi sat beside the pool. It would be pleasant if he could forget\nwhere he was. It was pastoral though not quite a scene from Earth. The\nhorizon was too near and the sky was shallow and only seemed to be\nbright. Darkness lurked outside.\n\nA small tree stretched shade overhead. Waves lapped and made gurgling\nsounds against the banks. But there was no plant life of any kind, and\nno fish swam in the liquid. It looked like water but wasn't--the pool\nheld acid. And floating in it, all but submerged, was a shape. The\nrecords in the hospital said it was a woman.\n\n\"Anti, they turned us down,\" said Docchi bitterly.\n\n\"What did you expect?\" rumbled the creature in the pool. Wavelets of\nacid danced across the surface, stirred by her voice.\n\n\"I didn't expect that.\"\n\n\"You don't know the Medicouncil very well.\"\n\n\"I guess I don't.\" He stared sullenly at the fluid. It was faintly\nblue. \"I have the feeling they didn't consider it, that they held the\nrequest for a time and then answered no without looking at it.\"\n\n\"Now you're beginning to learn. Wait till you've been here as long as I\nhave.\"\n\nMorosely he kicked an anemic tuft of grass. Plants didn't do well here\neither. They too were exiled, far from the sun, removed from the soil\nthey originated in. The conditions they grew in were artificial. \"Why\ndid they turn us down?\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Answer it yourself. Remember what the Medicouncil is like. Different\nthings are important to them. The main thing is that we don't have to\nfollow their example. There's no need to be irrational even though they\nare.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew what to do,\" said Docchi. \"It meant so much to us.\"\n\n\"We can wait, outlast the attitude,\" said Anti, moving slowly. It was\nthe only way she could move. Most of her bulk was beneath the surface.\n\n\"Cameron suggested waiting.\" Reflectively Docchi added: \"It's true we\nare biocompensators.\"\n\n\"They always bring in biocompensation,\" muttered Anti restlessly. \"I'm\ngetting tired of that excuse. Time passes just as slow.\"\n\n\"But what else is there? Shall we draw up another request?\"\n\n\"Memorandum number ten? Let's not be naive. Things get lost when we\nsend them to the Medicouncil. Their filing system is in terrible shape.\"\n\n\"Lost or distorted,\" grunted Docchi angrily. The grass he'd kicked\nalready had begun to wilt. It wasn't hardy in this environment. Few\nthings were.\n\n\"Maybe we ought to give the Medicouncil a rest. I'm sure they don't\nwant to hear from us again.\"\n\nDocchi moved closer to the pool. \"Then you think we should go ahead\nwith the plan we discussed before we sent in the petition? Good. I'll\ncall the others together and tell them what happened. They'll agree\nthat we have to do it.\"\n\n\"Then why call them? More talk, that's all. Besides I don't see why we\nshould warn Cameron what we're up to.\"\n\nDocchi glanced at her worriedly. \"Do you think someone would report it?\nI'm certain everyone feels as I do.\"\n\n\"Not everyone. There's bound to be dissent,\" said Anti placidly. \"But I\nwasn't thinking of people.\"\n\n\"Oh that,\" said Docchi. \"We can block that source any time we need to.\"\nIt was a relief to know that he could trust the accidentals. Unanimity\nwas important and some of the reasons weren't obvious.\n\n\"Maybe you can and maybe you can't,\" said Anti. \"But why make it\ndifficult, why waste time?\"\n\nDocchi got up awkwardly but he wasn't clumsy once he was on his feet.\n\"I'll get Jordan. I know I'll need arms.\"\n\n\"Depends on what you mean,\" said Anti.\n\n\"Both,\" said Docchi, smiling. \"We're a dangerous weapon.\"\n\nShe called out as he walked away. \"I'll see you when you leave for far\nCentauri.\"\n\n\"Sooner than that, Anti. Much sooner.\"\n\nStars were beginning to wink. Twilight brought out the shadows and\ntracery of the structure that supported the transparent dome overhead.\nSoon controlled slow rotation would bring near darkness to this side of\nthe asteroid. The sun was small at this distance but even so it was a\ntie to the familiar scenes of Earth. Before long it would be lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCameron leaned back and looked speculatively at the gravity engineer,\nVogel. The engineer could give him considerable assistance. There was\nno reason why he shouldn't but anyone who voluntarily had remained\non the asteroid as long as Vogel was a doubtful quantity. He didn't\ndistrust him, the man was strange.\n\n\"I've been busy trying to keep the place running smoothly. I hope you\ndon't mind that I haven't been able to discuss your job at length,\"\nsaid the doctor, watching him closely.\n\n\"Naw, I don't mind,\" said Vogel. \"Medical directors come and go. I stay\non. It's easier than getting another job.\"\n\n\"I know. By now you should know the place pretty well. I sometimes\nthink you could do my work with half the trouble.\"\n\n\"Ain't in the least curious about medicine and never bothered to\nlearn,\" grunted Vogel. \"I keep my stuff running and that's all. I\ndon't interfere with nobody and they don't come around and get friendly\nwith me.\"\n\nCameron believed it. The statement fit the personality. He needn't be\nconcerned about fraternization. \"There are a few things that puzzle\nme,\" he began. \"That's why I called you in. Usually we maintain about\nhalf Earth-normal gravity. Is that correct?\"\n\nThe engineer nodded and grunted assent.\n\n\"I'm not sure why half gravity is used. Perhaps it's easier on the\nweakened bodies of the accidentals. Or there may be economic factors.\nEither way it's not important as long as half gravity is what we get.\"\n\n\"You want to know why we use that figure?\"\n\n\"If you can tell me without getting too technical, yes. I feel I should\nlearn everything I can about the place.\"\n\nThe engineer warmed up, seeming to enjoy himself. \"Ain't no reason\nexcept the gravity units themselves,\" Vogel said. \"Theoretically we can\nget anything we want. Practically we take whatever comes out, anything\nfrom a quarter to full Earth gravity.\"\n\n\"You have no control over it?\" This contradicted what he'd heard. His\ninformation was that gravity generators were the product of an awesome\nbit of scientific development. It seemed inconceivable that they should\nbe so haphazardly directed.\n\n\"Sure we got control,\" answered the engineer, grinning. \"We can\nturn them off or on. If gravity varies, that's too bad. We take the\nfluctuation or we don't get anything.\"\n\nCameron frowned; the man knew what he was doing or he wouldn't be\nhere. His position was of only slightly less importance than that of\nthe medical director--and where it mattered the Medicouncil wouldn't\ntolerate incompetence. And yet----\n\nThe engineer rumbled on. \"You were talking how the generators were\ndesigned especially for the asteroid. Some fancy medical reason why\nit's easier on the accidentals to have a lesser gravity plus a certain\namount of change. Me, I dunno. I guess the designers couldn't help what\nwas built and the reason was dug up later.\"\n\nCameron concealed his irritation. He wanted information, not a heart\nto heart confession. Back on Earth he _had_ been told it was for\nthe benefit of the accidentals. He'd reserved judgment then and saw\nno reason not to do so now. \"All practical sciences try to justify\nwhat they can't escape but would like to. Medicine, I'm sure, is no\nexception.\"\n\nHe paused thoughtfully. \"I understand there are three separate\ngenerators on the asteroid. One runs for forty-five minutes while two\nare idle. When the first one stops another one cuts in. The operations\nare supposed to be synchronized. I don't have to tell you that they're\nnot. Not long ago you felt your weight increase suddenly. I know I did.\nWhat is wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing wrong,\" said the engineer soothingly. \"You get fluctuations\nwhile one generator is running. You get a gravity surge when one\ngenerator is supposed to drop out but doesn't. The companion machine\nadds to it, that's all.\"\n\n\"They're supposed to be that way? Overlapping so that for a time we\nhave Earth or Earth and a half gravity?\"\n\n\"Better than having none,\" said Vogel with heavy pride. \"Used to happen\nquite often, before I came. You can ask any of the old timers. I fixed\nthat though.\"\n\nHe didn't like the direction his questions were taking him. \"What did\nyou do?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the engineer uncomfortably. \"Nothing I can think of. I\nguess the machines just got used to having me around.\"\n\nThere were people who tended to anthropomorphize anything they came\nin contact with and Vogel was one of them. It made no difference to\nhim that he was talking about insensate machines. He would continue to\nendow them with personality. \"This is the best you can say, that we'll\nget a wild variation of gravity, sometimes none?\"\n\n\"It's not _supposed_ to work that way but nobody's ever done better\nwith a setup like this,\" said Vogel defensively. \"If you want you can\ncheck the company that makes these units.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to challenge your knowledge and I'm not anxious to make\nmyself look silly. I do want to make sure I don't overlook anything.\nYou see, I think there's a possibility of sabotage.\"\n\nThe engineer's grin was wider than the remark required.\n\nCameron swiveled the chair around and leaned on the desk. \"All right,\"\nhe said tiredly, \"tell me why the idea of sabotage is so funny.\"\n\n\"It would have to be someone living here,\" said the big engineer. \"He\nwouldn't like it if it jumped up to nine G, which it could. I think\nhe'd let it alone. But there are better reasons. Do you know how each\ngravity unit is put together?\"\n\n\"Not in detail.\"\n\nThe gravity generating unit was not a unit. It was built in three\nparts. First there was a power source, which could be anything as long\nas it supplied ample energy. The basic supply on the asteroid was a\nnuclear pile, buried deep in the core. Handicap Haven would have to be\ntaken apart, stone by stone, before it could be reached.\n\nPart two were the gravity coils, which actually originated and directed\nthe gravity. They were simple and very nearly indestructible. They\ncould be destroyed but they couldn't be altered and still produce the\nfield.\n\nThe third part was the control unit, the real heart of the gravity\ngenerating system. It calculated the relationship between the power\nflowing through the coils and the created field in any one microsecond.\nIt used the computed relationship to alter the power flowing in\nthe next microsecond to get the same gravity. If the power didn't\nchange the field died instantly. The control unit was thus actually a\ncomputer, one of the best made, accurate and fast beyond belief.\n\nThe engineer rubbed his chin. \"Now I guess you can see why it doesn't\nalways behave as we want it to.\"\n\nHe looked questioningly at Cameron, expecting a reply. \"I'm afraid I\ncan't,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"If it was one of your patients you'd understand,\" said Vogel.\n\"Fatigue. The gravity control unit is an intricate computer and it gets\ntired. It has to rest an hour and a half to do forty-five minutes work.\nIt can't keep running all the time any more than any delicate machine\ncan. It has to be shut down to clear the circuits.\n\n\"Naturally they don't want anyone tinkering with it. It's sealed and\nnon-repairable. Crack the case open and it disintegrates. But first\nyou've got to open it. Now I know that it can be done, but not without\na lot of high-powered equipment that I could detect if it was anywhere\non the asteroid.\"\n\nIn spite of the engineer's attitude it didn't seem completely\nfoolproof. But Cameron had to admit that it was probable none of the\naccidentals could tamper with it. \"I'll forget about gravity,\" he said.\n\"Next, what about hand weapons? What's available?\"\n\n\"Nothing. No knives even. Maybe a stray bar or so of metal.\" Vogel\nscratched his head. \"There is something that's dangerous though. I\ndunno whether you could classify it as a weapon.\"\n\nCameron was instantly alert. \"If it's dangerous someone can find a way\nto use it. What is it?\"\n\n\"The asteroid itself. Nobody can physically touch any part of the\ngravity system. But I've often wondered if an impulse couldn't be\nsqueezed into the computer. If anybody can do that he can change\ndirection of the field.\" Vogel's voice was grave. \"Somebody could pick\nup Handicap Haven and throw it anywhere he wanted. At Earth, say.\nThirty miles in diameter is a big hunk of rock.\"\n\nThis was the kind of information Cameron had been looking for, though\nthe big engineer seemed to regard the occasion as merely a long overdue\nsocial call. \"What's the possibility?\"\n\nVogel grinned. \"Thought I'd scare you. Used to wake up sweating myself.\nGot so bad I had to find out about it.\"\n\n\"Can or can't it be done?\" demanded the doctor.\n\n\"Naw. It's too big to take a chance with. They got monitors set up all\nover, moons of Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus. This or any other gravity\ncomputer gets dizzy, the monitor overrides it. If that fails they send\na jammer impulse and freeze it up tight. It can't get away until the\nmonitor lets loose.\"\n\nCameron's mind was already busy elsewhere. Vogel was loquacious\nand would talk all night if encouraged. It wasn't that he lacked\ninformation but he had no sense of what was important. \"You don't know\nhow you've helped me,\" the doctor said, standing up. \"We'll have to get\ntogether again.\"\n\nHe watched the engineer depart for the gravity generating chamber\nbelow the surface of the asteroid. The day had started badly and\nwasn't getting better. Docchi to Thorton to Vogel. All the shades of\nshortsightedness, the convalescent's, authority's, and finally the\ntechnician who refused to see beyond his dials. A fine progression, but\nsomewhere the curve ought to turn upward.\n\nThe post on Handicap Haven wasn't pleasant but there were\nadvantages--advancement was proportional to the disagreeableness of the\nplace. After shepherding accidentals for a year any other assignment\nwould be a snap. Ten months to go before the year was over and if\nCameron could survive with nothing to mar his administration he was\nin line for something better, definitely better. This was where the\nMedicouncil sent promising young doctors.\n\nCameron flipped on the telecom. \"Connect me with the rocket dome. Get\nthe pilot.\"\n\nWhen the robot answered it wasn't encouraging. \"There's no answer. I'm\nsorry. I'll notify you when he comes in.\"\n\n\"Trace him,\" he snapped. \"If he's not near the rocket he's somewhere in\nthe main dome. I don't care how you do it, get him.\"\n\nA few seconds of silence followed. The answer was puzzling. \"There's no\nrecord that the pilot has left the rocket dome.\"\n\nHis heart skipped and his breathing was constricted. He spoke\ncarefully. \"Scan the whole area. Look every place, even if you think he\ncan't be there. I've got to have the pilot.\"\n\n\"Scanning isn't possible. The system is out of operation in that area.\nI'm trying to check why.\"\n\nThat was bad. He could feel muscles tighten that he didn't know he had.\n\"All right. Send out repair robots.\" They'd get the job done--they\nalways did. But they were intolerably slow and just now he needed speed.\n\n\"Mobile repair units were dispatched as soon as scanning failed to\nwork. Is this an emergency? If so I can alert the staff.\"\n\nHe thought about it. He needed help, plenty of it. But was there any\none he could depend on? Vogel? He'd probably be ready for action. But\nto call on him would leave the gravity generating plant unprotected.\nAnd if he told the engineer what he suspected, Vogel would insist on\nmixing in with it. He was too vital where he was.\n\nWho else? The sour middle-aged nurse who'd signed up because she\nwanted quick credits toward retirement? She slept through most of her\nshift and considering her efficiency perhaps it was just as well she\ndid. Or the sweet young trainee--her diploma said she'd completed her\ntraining, but you couldn't lie to a doctor--who had bravely volunteered\nbecause someone ought to help poor unfortunate men? Not a word about\nwomen of course. She always walked in when Cameron was examining a\npatient, male, but she had the deplorable habit of swooning when she\nsaw blood. Fainting was too vulgar for her and, as Cameron had once\ntold her, so was the profession of her choice.\n\nThese were the people the emergency signal would alert. He would do\nbetter to rely on robots. They weren't much help but at least they\nwouldn't get hysterically in his way. Oh yes, there was the pilot too,\nbut he couldn't be located.\n\nThe damned place was undermanned and always had been. Nobody wanted to\nbe stationed here except those who were mildly psychotic or inefficient\nand lazy. There was one exception. Ambitious young doctors had been\nknown to ask for the position. Mentally Cameron berated himself.\nAmbition wasn't far from psychosis, or at times it could produce\nresults as bad. If anything serious happened here he'd begin and end\nhis career bandaging scratches at a children's playground.\n\n\"This is not an emergency,\" he said. \"However leave word in gravity\nwith Vogel. Tell him to put on his electronic guards. I don't want him\nto let anyone get near the place.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Send out six geepees. I'll pick them up near the entrance to the\nrocket dome.\"\n\n\"Repair robots are already in the area. Will they do as well?\"\n\n\"They won't. I want general purpose robots for another reason. Send the\nlatest huskiest models we have.\" They were not bright but they were\nstrong and could move fast. He clicked off the picture. What did he\nhave to be afraid of? For the most part they were a beaten ragged bunch\nof humans. He would feel sorry for them if he wasn't apprehensive about\nhis future.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nDocchi waited near the rocket dome. He wasn't hiding but he did make\nhimself inconspicuous among the carefully nurtured shrubbery. Plants\nfailed to give the illusion of an Earth landscape--in part because some\nof them were Venusian or Martian imports--but at least the greenery\nadded to the oxygen supply of the asteroid.\n\n\"That's a good job,\" commented Docchi. \"I thought Nona could do it.\"\n\nJordan could feel him relax as he watched the event. \"A mechanical\nmarvel,\" he agreed. \"But we can gab about that later. I think you ought\nto get going.\"\n\nDocchi glanced around and then went boldly into the passageway that\nconnected the main dome with the much smaller rocket dome that was\nadjacent to it. Normally it was never completely dark in the inhabited\npart of the asteroid, modulated twilight was considered more conducive\nto the slumber of the grievously infirm. It was the benevolent\nMedicouncil's theory that a little light would keep away bad dreams.\nBut this wasn't twilight as they neared the rocket dome. It was a full\nscale rehearsal for the darkness of interstellar space.\n\nDocchi stopped at the emergency airlock which loomed formidably solid\nin front of them. \"Let's hope,\" he said. \"We can forget about it if\nNona didn't manage to cut _this_ out of the circuit.\"\n\n\"She seemed to understand, didn't she? What more do you want?\" Jordan\ntwisted around Docchi and reached out. The great slab moved easily\nin the grooves. It was open. \"The trouble with you is that you lack\nconfidence, in yourself and in genius.\"\n\nDocchi didn't answer. He was listening intently, trying to interpret\nthe faint sounds ahead of him.\n\n\"Okay, I hear it,\" whispered Jordan. \"Let's get way inside before he\ncomes near us.\"\n\nDocchi went cautiously into the darkness of the rocket dome, feeling\nhis way. He'd never recover in time if he stumbled and fell. He tried\nto force the luminescence into his face. Occasionally he could control\nhis altered metabolism, and now was the time he needed it.\n\nHe was nervous and that hindered his accuracy. He couldn't be sure\nthe light was right, enough so that he'd be noticed, not so much that\nthe details of his appearance would be plain. He wished he could ask\nJordan, but Jordan was in no position to tell him.\n\nThe footsteps came nearer and so did profanity, rich in volume but\nrather meager in imaginative symbolism. Docchi flashed his face\nonce, as bright as he could manage, and then lowered the intensity\nimmediately.\n\nThe footsteps stopped. \"Docchi?\"\n\n\"No. Just a lonely little light bulb out for an evening stroll.\"\n\nThe rocket pilot's laughter wasn't altogether friendly. \"Sure it's you.\nI'd recognize you at the bottom of the sea. What I mean was what are\nyou doing here?\"\n\n\"I saw the lights go out in the rocket dome. The airlock at the\nentrance was open so I came. I thought I might be able to help.\"\n\n\"The lights are off all right. Everything. Even the standby system.\nFirst time in my life even the hand beams wouldn't go on.\" The pilot\nmoved closer. The deadly little toaster was in his hand. \"Thanks, but\nyou can't help. You'd better get out. It's against regulations for\npatients to be in here. You might steal a rocket or something.\"\n\nDocchi ignored the weapon. \"What was the cause, a high velocity meteor\nstrike?\"\n\nThe pilot grunted. \"I'd have heard if it was.\"\n\n\"And you didn't hear a thing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" The pilot peered intently at Docchi, a barely visible\nsilhouette. \"Well, I see you're getting smart these days. You should do\nit all the time. Wear your arms. You look better that way even if you\ncan't use them. You look hundred per cent better, almost....\" His voice\nfaded.\n\n\"Almost human?\" asked Docchi kindly. \"Nothing like, say a pair of legs\nand a very good if slightly used spinal column with a lightning bug\nface stuck on top? You didn't have this in mind?\"\n\n\"I didn't say it. I'm used to you. I can't help it if you're overly\nsensitive. I don't suppose it's your fault.\" His voice got higher.\n\"Anyway I told you to get going. You don't belong in here.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go,\" said Docchi. \"I'm not afraid of the dark. Are\nyou? I'm looking for some corner to brighten. Can I let a little light\nin your life?\"\n\n\"I'm supposed to report psycho talk, Docchi, and damned if I won't.\nPersonally I always suspected you. Get out of here before I take your\nfake hand and drag you out.\"\n\n\"Now you've hurt my feelings,\" said Docchi reproachfully, stepping\nnimbly away.\n\n\"Don't say you didn't try to make me mad,\" growled the pilot, lunging\nafter him. What he took hold of wasn't an imitation hand, delicately\nmolded and colored to duplicate skin. The hand he touched was real and\nthe muscles in it were more than a match for his own. It was surprise,\nat first, that caused him to scream.\n\nDocchi bent double and the dark figure on his back came over his head\nlike a knife from a sheath. The pilot was lifted off his feet and\nslammed to the floor.\n\n\"Jordan,\" gurgled the pilot.\n\n\"It's me,\" said Jordan. He wrapped one arm around the pilot's throat\nand clamped tight. With the other he felt for the toaster the pilot\nstill held but hadn't time to use. Effortlessly he tore it away and\nhammered the man unconscious with the butt. He stopped just short of\nsmashing the skull. Docchi stood ineffectually by, kicking where he\ncould, but the action was fast and he had no arms.\n\nBut Jordan didn't need help. \"Let there be light,\" he said when he was\nfinished, and there was--a feeble flickering illumination from Docchi.\n\nJordan balanced himself with his hands. He had a strong head and\nmassive powerful arms and shoulders. His body stopped below his chest,\nthere was no more. A round metal capsule contained his digestive\norgans. Accidentals were indeed the odds and ends of creation, and of\nJordan one end was missing. But the part that remained made up for the\nloss.\n\n\"Dead?\" Docchi glanced down at the pilot.\n\nJordan rocked forward and listened for the heartbeat. \"Nah,\" he said.\n\"I was going to clout him again but I remembered we can't afford to\nkill anybody.\"\n\n\"See that you don't forget,\" said Docchi. He stifled an exclamation as\nsomething coiled around his leg. Jumping forward he broke loose from\nthe thing that caught him.\n\n\"Repair robot,\" chuckled Jordan, looking around. \"The place is lousy\nwith them.\"\n\nDocchi blinked on and off in confusion and the robot rolled clumsily\ntoward him.\n\n\"Friendly creature,\" commented Jordan. \"I think it wants to tinker with\nyour lighting system.\"\n\nDocchi shook off the squat contrivance which, after it touched his\nflesh, whirred puzzledly to itself. The job was beyond its capacity but\nit didn't leave. \"What'll we do with him?\" asked Docchi, staring at the\npilot.\n\n\"He needs attention,\" said Jordan. \"_Not_ the kind I gave him.\" He\nbalanced the toaster in his hand and burned a small hole in the little\nwheeled monster. Extensibles emerged from the side of the machine and\ncarefully explored the damaged area. The extensibles slid back into\nthe machine and presently came out again with a small torch. It began\nwelding the hole.\n\nMeanwhile Jordan pulled the unconscious man toward him. He leaned\nagainst the machine for leverage and raised the inert pilot over his\nhead and laid him gently on the top flat surface. The reaction from\nthe robot was immediate. Another extensible reached out to investigate\nthe body. Jordan welded the joints solid. Three times he repeated the\nprocess until the pilot was securely fastened to the robot.\n\n\"It doesn't know when it's licked,\" said Jordan. \"It'll stay there\nrepairing itself until it's completely sound. However I can do\nsomething about that.\" He adjusted the toaster beam to an imperceptible\nthickness and deftly sliced through the control case, removing a\ncircular section. He thrust his hand inside and ripped out circuits.\n\"No further self-repair,\" he said cheerfully. \"Docchi, I'll need your\nhelp. I think it's a good idea to route the robot around the main dome\na few times before it delivers the pilot to the hospital. No point\ngiving ourselves away before we're ready.\"\n\nDocchi bent over to help him and with some trouble the proper sequence\nwas implanted. The robot stood motionless as the newest commands\nshuttled erratically through damaged but not inoperative circuits.\nFinally it screeched softly and began to roll drunkenly away.\n\n\"Get on my back,\" said Docchi doggedly. \"You know we've got to hurry.\"\n\n\"You're tired,\" said Jordan. \"Half gravity or not, you can't carry me\nfarther.\" He worked swiftly and the harness that had supported him on\nDocchi's back fell to the floor. \"Stay down and listen,\" growled Jordan\nas Docchi attempted to get up.\n\nDocchi listened. \"Geepees.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jordan. \"I wonder who they're after. You'll have to move\nfast to get to the rocket.\"\n\n\"What can I do when I get there? By myself nothing. You'll have to help\nme.\"\n\n\"Get on your back and neither of us get there?\" said Jordan. \"You can\nfigure out something later. Start moving.\"\n\n\"I'm not leaving you,\" said Docchi.\n\nA huge paw clamped on the back of his head. \"Now you listen,\" said\nJordan fiercely. \"Together we were a better man than the pilot--your\nlegs and my arms. Now we got to separate but we can still prove we're\nbetter than Cameron and all his geepees.\"\n\n\"We're not trying to _prove_ anything,\" said Docchi. \"It's a question\nof urgent principle. Right now there are men who can go to the stars\nand it's up to us to let the rest of mankind know it.\"\n\nA brilliant light sliced through the darkness and swept around the\nrocket dome, revealing beams and columns of the structure. \"Maybe\nyou're not trying to prove anything personal,\" said Jordan. \"I am. The\nrest of us are. Otherwise why shouldn't we let them go on spoon feeding\nus, rocking us to sleep every night?\" Impatiently he hitched himself\nalong the ground until he came to a column.\n\n\"You can't hide behind that,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Not behind it. On top I can. With no legs that's where I belong.\" He\ngrasped the steel member in his great hands and in the light gravity\nascended rapidly.\n\n\"Careful,\" called Docchi.\n\n\"What have I got to be careful about?\" Jordan's voice floated down from\nthe lacy structure. And it was no longer directly overhead. Jordan was\nmoving away along the beams that stretched from column to column. For\nthose who knew of it there was an unsuspected roadway above. Jordan had\nit to himself and the geepees would never find him.\n\nIt was foolish to become elated over such a trivial thing. Jordan\nwasn't there yet and what he'd do when he arrived was problematical.\nBut it did prove--yes, there was already proof of some sort for him.\nDocchi set out, walking faster and faster until he was running. He\nwouldn't have thought it possible but he was able to increase the\ndistance between himself and the pursuing robots.\n\nEven so he didn't have much time to look around when he reached the\nrocket. The first glimpse of the ship was disheartening. Passenger and\nfreight locks were still closed. Nona either hadn't understood their\ninstructions completely or she hadn't been able to carry them out.\nProbably the first. She'd disrupted the circuits, light and scanning,\nwith no tools except her hands. Her skill with machines she couldn't\nhave known about previously was sometimes uncanny. But it was too much\nto expect that she'd have the rocket ready for them to walk into.\n\nIt was up to Docchi to get in by himself. If he was ever going to\nit would have to be by his own efforts. Momentarily he wished for\nthe toaster they'd taken from the pilot, and then dropped the wish\nbefore it was fully formed. With the toaster he might have managed to\nsoften the inside catch at the entrance. And the thought itself was an\nindication of how his mind rebelled at reality--he had no arms and he\ncouldn't have used the toaster. It was right and proper that Jordan had\nkept the weapon. It was of value to him.\n\nDocchi searched frantically, trying to comprehend the complex\ninstallation around him in a glance. There had to be some provision\nmade for opening the ship when no one was inside, a device which would\nsend an impulse to actuate the catches. He'd be lucky if he could\noperate it, but luck had been with him so far.\n\nBut if there was an external control he failed to find it. And the\napproaching lights warned that his chances were diminishing. That there\nwas any time left was Cameron's mistake--he'd ordered the geepees to\nlook too thoroughly as they came along. They were capable of faster\npursuit. This mistake was on Cameron and he might make more.\n\nFrom the sounds that drifted to him Docchi surmised that Jordan was\nstill at large, perhaps nearby. Did the doctor know this? Probably\nnot--he'd tend to underestimate the accidentals.\n\nDocchi descended into the shallow landing pit. It was remarkably ill\nsuited for concealment. The walls were smooth, glazed with a faintly\ngreen substance, and there were no doors or niches anywhere. Yet he had\nto be somewhere near the ship and this was as close as he could get.\nIt wouldn't do to wander away--Cameron would post a robot guard around\nthe ship and he wouldn't be able to get back through. He had to hide at\nonce.\n\nHe leaned against the stern tube cluster, the metal pressing hard into\nthe thin flesh that covered his back. Seconds passed before he realized\nthat the tubes were the answer. He turned around to look at them. A\nsmall boy could climb inside and crawl out of sight. So could a grown\nman who had no shoulders or arms to get wedged in the narrow cylinder.\n\nIt was difficult to get into them. He tried a lower tube, bending down\nand thrusting his head in. He wriggled and shoved with his feet until\nhe was almost entirely in. His feet were still out and so he bent his\nknees to get better purchase and forced himself further in. He didn't\nstop until he was certain he couldn't be seen by anyone who didn't\nspecifically peer into the tube.\n\nHe waited there, listening. A geepee came down noisily into the landing\npit. The absence of any other sound indicated to Docchi that it\nprobably was radio controlled. The robot clambered around, searching.\nThe noise abated soon but it became apparent that the geepee wasn't\ngoing to leave. It had been stationed to watch the pit.\n\nDocchi couldn't get out. He was caught in the pit. He fought back the\nclaustrophobia that swirled through his mind. It was nothing to be\nafraid of; he could assure his rescue, or capture, by shouting. The\nrobot would drag him out instantly.\n\nBut that was not the only way. The tube extended forward as well as\nback. The inner end of the tube was closed with a combustion chamber\nwhich was singed and would swing away. The ship hadn't been used for\nmonths and there was a distinct possibility that the tubes _were_ open\nat the other end. He might get through.\n\nHe stopped to catch his breath. The metal conducted sound well, almost\nmagnifying it. In the interval, over his own breathing, he heard the\ncharacteristic sputter, like frying, that the toaster beam made when it\nstruck metal. A great clatter followed.\n\n\"Get him,\" shouted Cameron. \"He's up there.\"\n\nJordan had arrived and succeeded in disabling a geepee. And Cameron\nwould find out that he wasn't easily captured. The diversion came when\nDocchi needed it.\n\n\"Don't use heat,\" ordered Cameron. \"Get lights on him. Drive him up\nhigher. Corner him and go up and get him.\"\n\nDocchi had been wrong; the geepees were voice controlled, not by radio.\nIt would make it easier once he got inside. If he ever did get in the\nship. But he had to hurry. Jordan couldn't elude the robots forever.\n\nDocchi shoved on less cautiously. The robot in the pit had joined the\nothers and he needn't fear detection. It became harder to advance,\nthough. He had expected it but he didn't know it would be this hard to\npush through the narrowing tube.\n\nHis legs slipped and it didn't matter, somehow he inched along. Blood\npounded furiously but his head slid out of the end of the tube--and he\nwas looking at the inside of the ship.\n\nHe gazed longingly at the combustion cap a few feet away. If he had\nhands he could grasp it and pull himself out. But if he had, he'd never\nhave gotten this far. He closed his eyes to rest for a moment and then\ncontinued wriggling, his back arching with the effort. He was nearly\nthrough now, only his legs were in the tube. He kicked once, hard, and\nfell to the floor.\n\nHe lay there until his head cleared and his breath came back. He\nrolled over, bent his knees, and stood up, staggering forward through\nthe corridor to the control compartment. The rocket was his but he\ndidn't want it for himself, and by himself he couldn't use it.\n\nHe studied the instrument panel carefully. It had been a long time\nsince he'd operated a ship. A long time and two arms ago. When he\nthought he understood he bent down and thrust his chin against a dial.\nLaboriously he rotated his head, turning the dial to the setting he\nwanted. Then he sat down and kicked on a switch. The ship rocked--and\nrose a few inches.\n\nHe was betting that Cameron wouldn't notice it. The doctor ought to\nbe too busy trying to capture Jordan. But if Cameron did see what was\nhappening, he had thirty seconds in which to stop Docchi. It wasn't\nenough. Things looked good for their plan.\n\n\"Rocket landing,\" said Docchi when the allotted thirty seconds had\npassed. \"Emergency instructions. Repeat, emergency instructions. Stand\nby.\" Technically the ship was in flight, though by very little, and the\nfrequency he was using was assurance that the message would be heard,\nand heeded.\n\n\"All energized geepees lend assistance. This order supersedes any\nprevious command. Additional equipment is necessary to prepare for a\npossible crash landing.\" After listing what equipment was needed Docchi\nsat down and chuckled.\n\nHe waited for another few minutes and then flicked on the external\nlights with his knee. He got up and went to the passenger entrance,\nbrushing against the switch on the way. The passenger ramp swung down\nand he stood boldly at the entrance, looking out. The whole rocket dome\nwas floodlighted by the ship, beams and columns standing out in sharp\ndetail. It was an impressive structure now, even beautiful, though he\nremembered hating it once, coming in.\n\n\"All right, Jordan, it's safe to come down,\" he called.\n\nJordan dangled overhead. He swung along until he reached a column and\nslid down. Awkwardly he propelled himself across the floor and up the\nramp. Balancing himself with his hands he looked up at Docchi.\n\n\"Well, monster,\" he grinned. \"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"Monster yourself,\" said Docchi. \"I crawled through the rocket tube.\"\n\n\"I saw you start in,\" said Jordan. \"I wasn't sure you'd make it.\nEven when the ship rose I wasn't certain until you came out.\" Jordan\nscratched his cheek. \"What I meant was: how did you get rid of Cameron?\"\n\n\"Doctors usually aren't mechanically inclined,\" said Docchi. \"Cameron\nwas no exception. He forgot an emergency rocket landing cancels any\nverbal orders. So I took the ship up a few inches. Geepees aren't very\nbright and it wouldn't matter if they were. As long as the ship was in\nthe air and I said I was coming in for a landing they had to obey.\"\n\nJordan nodded delightedly. \"Poor doc,\" he said. \"It wasn't that he was\ndumb. There was nothing he could do when you outsmarted him.\"\n\n\"He should have anticipated it,\" said Docchi. \"He could have splashed\nheat against a gravity generator. This would have created an emergency\ncondition in the main dome, artificial of course, but it would have\noutweighed the one I set up. He'd have had priority, not me, and he\ncould have directed the robots from gravity center.\"\n\n\"_I_ wouldn't have thought of it,\" said Jordan. \"Anyway, how did you\nget the robots to rush off, carrying Cameron with them?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to do anything. As long as the pilot of the incoming\nship declares he may crash, the geepees must remove all humans from the\ndanger zone, willing or not. They'd have taken you too if they could\nhave reached you but they had to abandon that idea when I ordered crash\nequipment.\"\n\n\"Glad they did,\" said Jordan. \"Wouldn't want to hear what Cameron's\nsaying. Besides it's safer inside the ship.\" He swung himself in,\ntouching the hull fondly, peering down the corridor with grave wonder.\n\"It's ours now,\" he said. \"But what about the others? How do we get\nthem?\"\n\n\"Anti's taken care of. Geepees aren't built to question anything and in\ntheir mind she's listed as emergency landing material. They'll bring\nher. And Nona is supposed to be waiting with Anti.\" Docchi's face\nshowed misgiving. \"I think we made it clear she was supposed to stay\nthere.\"\n\n\"What if she didn't understand?\"\n\n\"I'm sure she did,\" said Docchi. \"It wasn't complicated. Meanwhile\nyou'd better get ready to lift ship.\"\n\nJordan disappeared, heading toward the control compartment. Docchi\nstationed himself at the passenger lock. He had said the instructions\nweren't hard to understand, and they weren't--for anyone else. But to\nNona the world was upside down; the simplest things often she didn't\ncomprehend--and the reverse was true. He hoped she hadn't got mixed up.\n\nHe had little time to dwell on it. The geepees were coming back. He\nheard them first and saw them seconds later. They came into sight\nhalf carrying, half pushing a huge rectangular tank. With ingenuity\nthat was unexpected in robots they had mounted it on four of their\nsmaller brethren, the squat repair robots. This served to support the\ntremendous weight.\n\nThe tank was filled with blue liquid. Twisted pipes dangled from the\nends--it had been torn from the pit in the ground, lifted up from the\nfoundation. Broken plants still clung to a narrow ledge on top and\nmoist soil adhered to the sides. Wracked out of shape and askew, the\ntank was intact and did not leak. Five geepees pushed it rapidly toward\nthe ship, mechanically oblivious to the disheveled man who shouted and\nstruck at them, incoherent with frustrated rage.\n\n\"Jordan, open the freight lock.\"\n\nIn response the ship rose a few more inches and hung quivering. To the\nrear a section of the ship hinged outward and downward to form a ramp.\nThe ship was ready and the cargo had arrived.\n\nDocchi remained at the passenger entrance. Cameron was an idiot. He\nshould have stayed in the main dome once the geepees had released him.\nHis presence was unwelcome, more than he may have realized. Still,\nthey'd gotten rid of him once and it ought to work again.\n\nIt was Nona who worried Docchi. She hadn't accompanied the robots and\nshe wasn't to be seen. It didn't look as if Cameron had found her there\nand managed to confine her to the hospital. It had happened too fast;\nthe doctor was lucky to have kept up with the geepees. Docchi started\nuncertainly down the ramp and came back. She wasn't around, he could\nsee that, and it was too late to go back to the main dome.\n\nThe tank neared the ship, the forward section sliding onto the ramp.\nThe motion slowed as the geepees' effort slackened. Then the robots\nstopped altogether, straightening up in bewilderment.\n\nThe tank rolled backward. The geepees got out of the way, shaking and\nbuzzing, looking questioningly around. Simultaneously, it seemed, they\nsaw Docchi. Their intentions were obvious but he forestalled them,\nleaping back in the ship. \"Close the passenger entrance,\" he shouted.\n\nJordan appeared at the far end of the corridor. \"Sure. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Vogel, the engineer. He must have seen the geepees on scanning when\nthey entered the main dome. He's trying to do what Cameron should have\nthought of but didn't have sense.\"\n\nJordan went away and the passenger ramp rose with ponderous slowness,\nclamping shut with metallic finality. As soon as he saw there was no\ndanger there Docchi hurried to the control compartment.\n\n\"Now we can't see what to do,\" complained Jordan.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Docchi. \"Try to get something on the telecom.\"\n\nFrom the angle it was difficult to see anything. The receptor tubes\nwere close to the hull, and the ship curved backward, filling most of\nthe screen. By rotating the view they managed to pick up a corner of\nthe tank. Apparently it was resting where Docchi had last seen it. He\ncouldn't be sure but he thought it hadn't been moved.\n\n\"I don't know whether we can bring it in,\" said Jordan nervously.\n\"Maybe we should leave it. We'll make out by ourselves.\"\n\n\"Leave without the tank? Not a chance. Vogel hasn't got complete\ncontrol of the robots yet.\" It seemed to be true. They were huddled\naway from the ship, looking alternately at the rocket and the tank,\nnearly motionless, paralyzed.\n\n\"Yeah, but he'll have them soon. Look at them.\"\n\n\"I am, which is why I think he's having trouble. Give me full power on\nthe emergency radio.\"\n\n\"What good will it do? He's got priority.\"\n\n\"He's got it, but can he push it through to them? It's my idea that he\ncan't, that he's at the wrong angle to put much power in his signal.\nThere's a lot of steel between him and the robots and that's weakening\nhis beam.\"\n\n\"Maybe you've got something,\" said Jordan. \"I'll burn the emergency\nstuff out. If it doesn't work we won't need it again anyway.\" He\nflipped the dials until the lights above them were blazing fiercely.\n\n\"Energized geepees are requested to lend assistance. This is an\nemergency. Place the tank in the ship. At once. At once.\"\n\nGeepees were not designed to sift contradictory commands at nearly\nthe same level of urgency. Their reasoning ability was feeble but the\nmechanism that enabled them to think at all was complicated. In one\nrespect they resembled humans: borderline decisions were difficult. A\nship in distress--an asteroid in danger. Both called for the robot to\ndestroy itself if necessary. It seemed as if that was all that would be\naccomplished.\n\n\"More power,\" whispered Docchi.\n\n\"There ain't more,\" answered Jordan, but somehow he coaxed an extra\ntrickle out of the reserves.\n\nMarionettes. But they were always that, puppets on invisible wires.\nAnd now this string led toward one action. Another, intrinsically\nmore important but suddenly less powerful, pulled for something else.\nCircuits burned in electronic brains. Microrays fluttered under the\nstress. They didn't know. They just didn't know.\n\nBut there had to be a choice.\n\nStiffly the geepees moved in and grasped the tank. The quality of their\ndecision was strained. They were pushing themselves more than the tank\nbut inch by inch the huge twisted structure rolled up the ramp.\n\n\"When it's completely on, raise the ramp.\" Docchi wasn't aware that he\ncould hardly be heard.\n\nThe cargo ramp began to lift up. The tank gained speed as it rolled\nforward into the ship. \"Geepees, the job is finished. Save yourselves,\"\nshouted Docchi. He saw a swirl of metallic bodies as they leaped from\nthe ramp.\n\nJordan breathed deeply. \"That did it. I don't think they can hurt us\nnow.\"\n\n\"It's not over. Get ship-to-station communication, if there's any radio\nleft.\"\n\n\"I'll be surprised if there is,\" muttered Jordan, but his skepticism\nwas without basis. The radio was still functioning. He made the\nadjustments.\n\nDocchi was matter of fact. \"Vogel, we're going out. Don't try to stop\nus. Give us clearance and save the dome some damage.\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n\"He's bluffing,\" said Jordan. \"He knows the airlocks in the main dome\nwill close automatically if we break through.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Docchi. \"Everyone in the main dome is safe--_if_ everyone\nis in there. Vogel, do you know where Cameron is? Are you certain a\nnurse or an accidental hasn't wandered in here to see what's wrong?\nWe'll give you time to think about it.\"\n\nAgain they waited and waited. Each second was tangible, the precious\nduration that lives and events were measured with--and the measure was\nexceedingly slow. Meanwhile Jordan flipped on the telecom and searched\nthe rocket dome. They saw nothing; there was not even a geepee in\nsight. Docchi watched the screen impassively; what he thought didn't\nshow on his face.\n\nAnd still there was no reply from the engineer in the gravity station.\n\n\"All right. We've given you a chance,\" said Docchi. His voice was\nbrittle. \"You know what we're going to do. If anybody gets hurt you can\ntake the credit.\" He turned away from the screen. \"Jordan, let's go.\nHit the shell with the bow.\"\n\nJordan grasped the levers. The ship hardly quivered as it tilted\nupward and leaped away. It roared in the air and then fell silent as\nit passed into space. And the silence was worse than any sound--it was\nfilled with the imagined hiss of air escaping from a great hole in the\ntransparent covering of the dome.\n\nJordan sat at the controls. \"Did he?\"\n\n\"He had to. He wouldn't risk killing some innocent person.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jordan. \"If you'd said he wouldn't want his pretty\nmachinery banged up it would be easier to believe.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear anything. We would have if we'd hit.\"\n\n\"It was fast. Could we tell? Maybe Vogel played it safe and had the\ninner shell out of the way even if he didn't give us the automatic\nsignal. In that event it's all right because it would close as soon\nas we got out of the way even if we did rip through the outer shell.\nAll the air wouldn't escape.\" Jordan sat there for a moment, silently\nreviewing his own arguments.\n\nHe twisted the lever and the ship leaped forward. \"Cameron I don't\nmind. He had time to get away and he knew what we were going to do. I\nkeep thinking Nona _might_ have been there.\"\n\n\"He opened it,\" said Docchi harshly. \"We didn't hit the dome. I didn't\nhear anything. Nona wasn't there.\" His face was gray, there was no\nlight at all in it. \"Come on,\" he said, walking away.\n\nJordan rocked back and forth. The hemisphere that held what remained of\nhis body was suited for it. He set the auto-controls and reduced the\ngravity to quarter normal. He bent his arms and shoved himself into the\nair, deftly catching a guide rail, swinging along it.\n\nIt was pure chance that he glanced toward the back of the ship instead\nof forward as he entered the corridor after Docchi. There was a light\nblinking at a cabin door.\n\nIt was occupied.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nJordan caught up before Docchi reached the cargo hold. In lesser\ngravity he was more active and could move freely. Now his handicap\nwas almost unnoticeable, seemed to have disappeared. The same was not\ntrue of Docchi. It required less effort to walk but there was also a\nprofound unsettling effect that made him cautious and uncertain.\n\nDocchi heard him coming and waited, bracing himself against the wall\nin case the gravity should momentarily change. Jordan still carried\nthe weapon he'd taken from the pilot. It was clipped to the sacklike\ngarment, dangling from his midsection which, for him, was just below\nhis shoulders. Down the passageway he came, swinging from the guide\nrails with easy grace though the gravity on the ship was as erratic as\non the asteroid.\n\nJordan halted, hanging on with one hand. \"We have a passenger. Someone\nwe didn't know about.\"\n\nDocchi stiffened. \"Who?\" he asked. But the answer was already on\nJordan's face. \"Nona,\" he said in relief. He slumped forward. \"How did\nshe get on?\"\n\n\"A good question,\" said Jordan. \"But there isn't any answer and never\nwill be. It's my guess that after she jammed the lights and scanners\nin the rocket dome she went to the ship and it looked inviting. So she\nwent in. She wouldn't let a little thing like a lock that couldn't be\nopened stop her.\"\n\n\"It's a good guess,\" agreed Docchi. \"She's exceedingly curious.\"\n\n\"We may as well make the picture complete. Once in the ship she felt\ntired. She found a comfortable cabin and fell asleep. She can't hear\nanything so our little skirmish with the geepees didn't bother her.\"\n\n\"I can't argue with you. It'll do until a better explanation comes\nalong.\"\n\n\"But I wish she'd waited a few minutes to take her nap. She'd have\nsaved us a lot of trouble. She didn't know you'd be able to crawl\nthrough the tubes--and neither did you until you'd actually done it.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" said Docchi. \"She did more than we did. We depend\ntoo much on her. Next thing we'll expect her to escort us personally to\nthe stars.\"\n\n\"I wasn't criticizing her,\" protested Jordan.\n\n\"Maybe not. You've got to remember her mind works differently. It never\noccurred to her that we'd have difficulty with something that was so\nsimple to her. At the same time she's completely unable to grasp our\nconcepts.\" He straightened up. \"We'd better get going if we don't want\nAnti to start yelling.\"\n\nThe cargo hold was sizable. It had to be to hold the tank, which was\nnow quite battered and twisted. But the tank was sturdily built and\nlooked as if it would hold together for ages to come. There was some\ndoubt as to whether the ship would. The wall opposite the ramp was\nbadly bent where the tank had plowed into it and the storage racks\nwere demolished. Odds and ends of equipment lay in scattered heaps on\nthe floor.\n\n\"Anti,\" called Docchi.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\n\"Never felt a thing,\" came the cheerful reply. It was not surprising;\nher surplus flesh was adequate protection against deceleration.\n\nJordan began to scale the side of the tank, reaching the top and\npeering over. \"She seems to be all right,\" he called down. \"Part of the\nacid's gone. Otherwise there's no damage.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" replied Anti. \"What did I say?\"\n\nIt was perhaps more serious than she realized. She might personally\ndislike it, but acid was necessary to her life. And some of it had\nbeen splashed from the tank. Where it had spilled metal was corroding\nrapidly. By itself this was no cause for alarm. The ship was built for\na multitude of strange environments and the scavenging system would\nhandle acid as readily as water, neutralizing it and disposing of it\nwhere it would do no harm. But the supply had to be conserved. There\nwas no more.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Anti rumbled with impatience. \"Get me out\nof here. I've stewed in this disgusting soup long enough.\"\n\n\"We were thinking how we could get you out. We'll figure out a way.\"\n\n\"You let me do the thinking. You just get busy. After you left I\ndecided there must be some way to live outside the tank and of course\nwhen I bent my mind to it there was a way. After all, who knows more\nabout my condition than me?\"\n\n\"You're the expert. Tell us what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh I will. All I need from you is no gravity and I'll take care of the\nrest. I've got muscles, more than you think. I can walk as long as my\nbones don't break from the weight.\"\n\nLight gravity was bad, none at all was worse for Docchi. Having no arms\nhe'd be helpless. The prospect of floating free without being able to\ngrasp anything was terrifying. He forced down his fear. Anti had to\nhave it and so he could get used to null gravity.\n\n\"We'll get around to it,\" he promised. \"Before we do we'll have to\ndrain and store the acid.\"\n\n\"I don't care what you do with it,\" said Anti. \"All I know is that I\ndon't want to be in it.\"\n\nJordan was already working. He swung off the tank and was busy\nexpelling water from an auxiliary compartment into space. As soon as\nthe compartment was empty he led a hose from it to the tank. A pump\nvibrated and the acid level in the tank began to fall.\n\nDocchi felt the ship lurch familiarly. The ship was older than he\nthought, the gravity generator more out of date. \"Hurry,\" he called to\nJordan.\n\nIn time they'd cut it off. But if gravity went out before they were\nready they were in for rough moments. Free floating globes of highly\ncorrosive acid, scattered throughout the ship by air currents, could be\nas destructive as high velocity meteor clusters.\n\nJordan tinkered with the pump and then jammed the lever as far as it\nwould go, holding it there. \"I think we'll make it,\" he said above the\nscreech of the pump. The machinery gasped, but it won. The throbbing\nbroke into a vacant clatter that betokened the tank was empty. Jordan\nhad the hose rolled away before the gravity generator let the feeling\nof weight trickle off into nothingness.\n\nAs soon as she was weightless Anti rose out of the tank.\n\nIn all the time Docchi had known her he had seen no more than a\nface framed in blue acid. Where it was necessary periodic surgery\nhad trimmed the flesh away. For the rest, she lived submerged in a\ncorrosive fluid that destroyed the wild tissue as fast as it grew.\nAnyway, nearly as fast.\n\n\"Well, junkman, look at a real freak,\" snapped Anti.\n\nHe had anticipated--and he was wrong in what he thought. It was true\nhumans weren't meant to grow so large, but Jupiter wasn't repulsive\nmerely because it was the bulging giant of planets. It was unbelievable\nand overwhelming when seen close up but it was not obscene. It took\ngetting used to but he could stand the sight of Anti.\n\n\"How long can you live out of the acid?\" he stammered.\n\n\"Can't live out of it,\" said Anti loftily. \"So I take it with me. If\nyou weren't as unobservant as most men you'd see how I do it.\"\n\n\"It's a robe of some kind,\" said Docchi carefully after studying it.\n\n\"Exactly. A surgical robe, the only thing I have to my name. Maybe\nit's the only garment in the solar system that will fit me. Anyway,\nif you've really examined it you'll notice it's made of a spongelike\nsubstance. It holds enough acid to last at least thirty-six hours.\"\n\nShe grasped a rail and propelled herself toward the passageway. For\nmost people it was spacious enough but not for Anti. However she could\nsqueeze through. And satellites, one glowing and the other swinging in\nan eccentric orbit, followed after the Jupiter of humans.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNona was standing in front of the instrument panel when they came back.\nIt was more or less like all panels built since designers first got the\nhang of what could really be done with seemingly simple components.\nThere was a bewildering array of lights, levers, dials, and indicators\nin front of her but Nona was interested in none of these. There was a\nsingle small switch and dial, separate from the rest, that held her\ncomplete attention. She seemed disturbed by what she saw or failed to\nsee. Disturbed or excited, it was difficult to guess which.\n\nAnti stopped. \"Look at her. If I didn't know she's as bad as the rest\nof us, in fact the only one who was born that way, it would be easy to\nhate her. She's disgustingly normal.\"\n\nThere was truth in what Anti said--and yet there wasn't. Surgical\ntechniques that could take bodies apart and put them together with a\nskill once reserved for machines had made beauty commonplace. There\nwere no more sagging muscles, discolored skin, or wrinkles. Even the\naged were attractive and youthful seeming until the day they died,\nand the day after too. There were no more ill-formed limbs, misshapen\nbodies, unsightly hair. Everyone was handsome or beautiful. No\nexceptions.\n\nThe accidentals didn't belong, of course. In another day most of them\nwould have been employed by a circus--if they had first escaped the\nformaldehyde of the specimen bottle.\n\nAnd Nona didn't belong--doubly. She couldn't be called normal, and she\nwasn't a repair job as the other accidentals were. Looked at closely\nshe was an original as far from the average in one direction as Anti\nwas in the other.\n\n\"What's she staring at?\" asked Anti as the others slipped past her into\nthe compartment. \"Is there something wrong with the little dial?\"\n\n\"That dial has a curious history,\" said Docchi. \"It's not useless, it\njust isn't used. Actually it's an indicator for the gravity drive which\nat one time was considered fairly promising. It hasn't been removed\nbecause it might come in handy during an extreme emergency.\"\n\n\"But all that extra weight----\"\n\n\"There's no weight, Anti. The gravity drive is run from the same\ngenerator that supplies passenger gravity. It's very interesting that\nNona should spot it at once. I'm certain she's never been in a control\nroom before and yet she went straight to it. She may even have some\ninkling of what it's for.\"\n\nAnti dismissed the intellectual feat. \"Well, why are you waiting here?\nYou know she can't hear us. Go stand in front of her.\"\n\n\"How do I get there?\" Docchi had risen a few inches now that Jordan\nhad released his grip. He was free floating and helpless, sort of a\nplankton of space.\n\n\"A good engineer would have sense to put on magnetics. Nona did.\" Anti\ngrasped his jacket. How she was able to move was uncertain. The tissues\nthat surrounded the woman were too vast to permit the perception of\nindividual motions. Nevertheless she proceeded to the center of the\ncompartment and with her came Docchi.\n\nNona turned before they reached her. \"My poor boy,\" sighed Anti. \"If\nyou're trying to conceal your emotions, that's a very bad job. Anyway,\nstop glowing like a rainbow and say something.\"\n\nIt was one time Anti missed. He almost _did_ feel that way and maybe\nif she weren't so competent in his own specialty he might have. It was\nirritating to study and work for so many years as he had--and then to\nbe completely outclassed by someone who did neither, to whom certain\nkinds of knowledge came so easily it seemed to be inborn. She was\nattractive but for him something was missing. \"Hello,\" he said lamely.\n\nNona smiled at him though it was Anti she went to.\n\n\"No, not too close, child. Don't touch the surgery robe unless you want\nyour pretty face to peel off when you're not looking.\"\n\nNona stopped; she was close but she may as well have been miles away.\nShe said nothing.\n\nAnti shook her head hopelessly. \"I wish she'd learn to read lips or at\nleast recognize words. What can you say to her?\"\n\n\"She knows facial expressions and actions, I think,\" said Docchi.\n\"She's pretty good at emotions too. She falls down when it comes to\nwords. I don't think she knows there is such a thing.\"\n\n\"Then how does she think?\" asked Anti, and answered her own question.\n\"Maybe she doesn't.\"\n\n\"Let's not be as dogmatic as psychologists have been. We know she does.\nWhat concepts she uses is uncertain. Not verbal, nor mathematical\nanyway--she's been tested for that.\" He frowned puzzledly. \"I don't\nknow what concepts she uses in thinking. I wish I did.\"\n\n\"Save some of the worry for our present situation,\" said Anti. \"The\nobject of your concern doesn't seem to need it. At least she isn't\ninterested.\"\n\nNona had wandered back to the instrument panel and was staring at the\ngravity drive indicator again. There was really nothing there to hold\nher attention but her curiosity was insatiable and childlike.\n\nAnd in many ways she seemed immature. And that led to an elusive\nthought: what child was she? Not whose child--what child. Her actual\nparents were known, obscure technicians and mechanics, descendants\nthemselves of a long line of mechanics and technicians. Not one notable\nor distinguished person among them, her family was decently unknown to\nfame or misfortune in every branch--until she'd come along. And what\nwas her place, according to heredity? Docchi didn't know but he didn't\nshare the official medical view.\n\nWith an effort Docchi stopped thinking about Nona. \"We appealed to the\nmedicouncilor,\" he said. \"We asked for a ship to go to the nearest\nstar, a rocket, naturally. Even allowing for a better design than we\nnow have the journey will take a long time--forty or fifty years going\nand the same time back. That's entirely too long for a normal crew, but\nit wouldn't matter to us. You know what the Medicouncil did with that\nrequest. That's why we're here.\"\n\n\"Why rockets?\" interrupted Jordan. \"Why not some form of that gravity\ndrive you were talking about? Seems to me for travel over a long\ndistance it would be much better.\"\n\n\"As an idea it's very good,\" said Docchi. \"Theoretically there's no\nupper limit to the gravity drive except the velocity of light and even\nthat's questionable. If it would work the time element could be cut in\nfractions. But the last twenty years have proved that gravity drives\ndon't work at all outside the solar system. They work very well close\nto the sun, start acting up at the orbit of Venus and are no good at\nall from Earth on out.\"\n\n\"Why don't they?\" asked Jordan. \"You said they used the same generator\nas passenger gravity. Those work away from the sun.\"\n\n\"Sure they do,\" said Docchi impatiently. \"Like ours is working now?\nActually ship internal gravity is more erratic than we had on the\nasteroid, and that's hardly reliable. For some reason the drive is\nalways worse than passenger gravity. Don't ask me why. If I knew I\nwouldn't be on Handicap Haven. Arms or no arms, biocompensator or not,\nI'd be the most important scientist on Earth.\"\n\n\"With multitudes of women competing for your affections,\" said Anti.\n\n\"I think he'd settle for one,\" suggested Jordan.\n\n\"Poor unimaginative man,\" said Anti. \"When I was young I was not so\nnarrow in my outlook.\"\n\n\"We've heard about your youth,\" said Jordan. \"I don't believe very much\nof it.\"\n\n\"Talk about your youth and love affairs privately if you want but spare\nus the details. Especially now, since there are more important things\nto attend to.\" Docchi glowered at them. \"Anyway the gravity drive is\nout,\" he resumed. \"At one time they had hopes for it but no longer. The\npresent function of the generator is to provide gravity _inside_ the\nship, for passenger comfort. Nothing else.\n\n\"So it is a rocket ship, slow and clumsy but reliable. It'll get us\nthere. The Medicouncil refused us and so we'll have to go higher.\"\n\n\"I'm all for it,\" said Anti. \"How do we get higher?\"\n\n\"We've discussed it before,\" answered Docchi. \"The Medicouncil is\nresponsible to the Solar Government, and in turn Solar has been known\nto yield to devious little pressures.\"\n\n\"Or not so devious great big pressures. Fine. I'm in favor,\" said Anti.\n\"I just wanted to be sure.\"\n\n\"Mars is close,\" continued Docchi. \"But Earth is more influential.\nTherefore I recommend it.\" His voice trailed off and he stopped and\nlistened, listened.\n\nAnti listened too but the sound was too faint for her hearing. \"What's\nthe matter?\" she said. \"I think you're imagining things.\"\n\nJordan leaned forward in his seat and examined the instrument panel\ncarefully before answering. \"That's the trouble, Anti. You're not\nsupposed to _hear_ it, but you should be able to feel vibrations as\nlong as the rocket's on.\"\n\n\"I don't feel it either.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Jordan, looking at Docchi. \"I can't understand. There's\nplenty of fuel.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe momentum of the ship carried it along after the rockets stopped\nfiring. They were still moving but not very fast and not in the\ndirection they ultimately had to go. Gingerly Docchi tried out the\nmagnetic shoes. He was clumsy but no longer helpless in the gravityless\nship. He stared futilely at the instruments as if he could wring out\nmore secrets than the panel had electronic access to.\n\n\"It's mechanical trouble of some sort,\" he said uneasily. \"I don't know\nwhere to begin.\"\n\nBefore he could get to it Anti was in the passageway that led from the\ncontrol compartment. \"Course I'm completely ignorant,\" she said. \"Seems\nto me we ought to start with the rocket tubes and trace the trouble\nfrom there.\"\n\n\"I was going to,\" said Docchi. \"You stay here, Anti. I'll see what's\nwrong.\"\n\nShe reached nearly from the floor to the ceiling. She missed by scant\ninches the sides of the corridor. Locomotion was easy for her, turning\naround wasn't. So she didn't turn. \"Look, honey,\" her voice floated\nback. \"You brought me along for the ride. That's fine. I'm grateful but\nI'm not satisfied with just that. Seems to me I've got to earn my fare.\nYou stay and run the ship. You and Jordan know how. I don't. I'll find\nout what's wrong.\"\n\n\"But you won't know what to do.\"\n\n\"I don't have to. You don't have to be a mechanic to see something's\nbroken. I'll find it, and when I do you can come and fix it.\"\n\nHe knew when it was useless to argue with her. \"We'll both go,\" he\nsaid. \"Jordan will stay at the controls.\"\n\nIt was a dingy poorly lighted passageway in an older ship. Handicap\nHaven didn't rate the best equipment that was being produced, and even\nwhen it was new the ship had been no prize. On one side of the corridor\nwas the hull of the ship; on the other a few small cabins. None were\noccupied. Anti stopped. The long hall ended in a cross corridor that\nled to the other side of the ship where a return passage led back to\nthe control compartment.\n\n\"We'll check the stern tubes,\" he said, still unable to see around her.\n\"Open the door and we'll look in.\"\n\n\"Can't,\" said Anti. \"Tried to but the handle won't turn. There's a red\nlight too. Does it mean anything?\"\n\nHe'd expected something like this but nevertheless his heart sank now\nthat he was actually confronted with it. \"It does. Don't try again.\nWith your strength you might be unlucky enough to open the door.\"\n\n\"There's a man for you,\" said Anti. \"First you tell me to open it and\nthen you don't want me to.\"\n\n\"There's no air in the rear compartment, Anti. The combustion chamber's\nbeen retracted--that's why the rockets stopped firing. The air rushed\nout into space as soon as it happened. That's what the red light means.\"\n\n\"We'd all die if I opened it now?\"\n\n\"We would.\"\n\n\"Then let's get busy and fix it.\"\n\n\"We will. But we've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. You see,\nit wasn't accidental. Someone, or something, was responsible.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Very sure. Did you see anyone while we were loading your tank in the\nship?\"\n\n\"Nothing. How could I? I heard Cameron shouting, other noise. But I\ncouldn't see a thing that wasn't directly overhead, and there wasn't\nanything.\"\n\n\"I thought so. A geepee _could_ have got in without anyone seeing him.\nI didn't count them but I was certain all of them had dropped outside.\nI was mistaken; one of them didn't.\"\n\n\"Why does it have to be a geepee?\"\n\n\"It just does, Anti. The combustion chamber was retracted while we were\nall in the control compartment. We didn't do it and therefore it had to\nbe someone back here.\n\n\"No man is strong enough to retract the cap, but if he somehow exerted\nsuperhuman effort, as soon as the chamber cleared the tubes rocket\naction would cease and the air in the compartment would exhaust into\nspace.\"\n\n\"So we have a dead geepee in the rocket compartment.\"\n\n\"A geepee doesn't die or even become inactive. Lack of air doesn't\nhinder it in the least. Not only that, a geepee might be able to\nescape from the compartment. It's strong and fast enough to open the\ndoor against the pressure and get out and close it again in less than\na second. We wouldn't notice it because the ship would automatically\nreplenish the small amount of air that would escape.\"\n\nAnti settled down grimly. \"Then there's a geepee on the loose, intent\non wrecking us?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n\"Then what are we standing around for? All we have to do is go back to\nthe controls and pick up the robot on the radio. We'll make it go in\nthere and repair the damage it's done.\"\n\nShe partly turned around and saw Docchi's face. \"Don't tell me,\" she\nsaid, \"I should have thought of it. The radio doesn't work inside the\nship.\"\n\nDocchi nodded reluctantly. \"It doesn't. Robots are never used aboard\nand so the emergency band is broadcast by the bow antenna. The hull of\nthe ship is a pretty good insulation.\"\n\n\"Ain't that nice?\" said Anti happily. \"We've got a robot hunt ahead of\nus.\"\n\n\"And our bare hands to hunt it with.\"\n\n\"Oh come. It's not as hopeless as that. Look, the robot was back here\nwhen the rockets stopped. It couldn't get by the control compartment\nwithout our seeing it.\"\n\n\"That's right. There are two corridors leading through the compartment,\none on each side of the ship.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean. We came down one and there wasn't any geepee. So\nit's got to be in the other. If it goes in a cabin a light will shine\noutside. It can't hide from us.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt we'll find it. But what'll we do then?\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" said Anti. \"Can you get past me when I'm standing\nlike this?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought. Neither can a geepee. All I need is a toaster,\nor something that looks like it. I'll drive the robot forward and\nJordan can burn it down.\" Determinedly she began to move toward the far\ncorridor. \"Hurry back to Jordan and tell him. There ought to be another\nweapon on the ship. Should be one for the pilot to use. Bring it back\nto me.\"\n\nDocchi bit his lip and stared at the back of the huge woman. He knew\nAnti, and when it was useless to argue with her. \"All right,\" he\nanswered. \"Stay here though. Don't try anything until I get a toaster\nfor you.\"\n\nThe magnetics on his feet were no substitute for gravity. Docchi\ncouldn't move fast, no human could. He had time to think as he went\nalong but nothing better suggested itself. A toaster for Jordan and\nanother for Anti--if there was another.\n\nAnd Anti would block the passageway. A geepee might go through her but\nit could never squeeze past. The robot would try to get away. If it\ncame toward Anti she might disable it. But she would be firing directly\ninto the control compartment. And if she missed even partially--well,\nthe instruments were delicate.\n\nBut Jordan might get the chance to bring down the robot. Then Anti\nwould be in the line of fire. No matter how he looked at it, Docchi\nwas sure the plan was unworkable. They'd have to devise something else.\n\n\"Jordan,\" called Docchi as soon as he got there; but Jordan wasn't\nin sight. Nona was, still gazing serenely at the gravity indicator.\nNothing seemed capable of breaking through the shell that surrounded\nher.\n\nLight was streaming from the opposite corridor. Docchi hurried over.\nJordan was just inside the entrance, the toaster clutched grimly in his\nhand. He was hitching his truncated body slowly toward the stern.\n\nComing to meet him was Anti--unarmed enormous Anti. She hadn't meant\nto wait for the weapon--she was pretty certain there wasn't any--she\nhad merely wanted to get him out of the way. And she wasn't walking;\nsomehow it seemed more like swimming, a bulbous huge sea animal moving\nthrough the air. She waved what resembled fins against the wall, with\nthem propelling herself forward. \"Melt it down,\" she cried.\n\nIt was difficult to make out the vaguely human form of the geepee.\nThe powerful shining body blended in with the structure of the\nship--unintentional camouflage, though the robot wasn't aware of it. It\ncrouched at the threshold of a cabin, hesitating between approaching\ndangers.\n\nJordan raised the weapon and lowered it with the same motion. \"Get out\nof the way.\" He gestured futilely to Anti.\n\nThere was no place she could go. She was too big to enter a cabin, too\nmassive to let the robot squeeze by even if she wanted. \"Never mind.\nGet him,\" she called.\n\nThe geepee wasn't a genius even by robot standards. But it did know\nthat heat is deadly and that a human body is a fragile thing. And so it\nran toward Anti. Unlike humans it didn't need special magnetics; such\na function was built into it and the absence or presence of gravity\ndisturbed it not at all. It moved very fast.\n\nDocchi had to watch though he didn't want to. The robot exploded into\naction, launching its body at Anti. But it was the robot that was\nthrown back. It had calculated swiftly but incorrectly--relative mass\nfavored the enormous woman.\n\nThe electronic brain obeyed the original instructions, whatever they\nwere. It got up and rushed Anti again. Metal arms shot out with\ndazzling speed and crashed against the flesh of the huge woman. Docchi\ncould hear the rattle of blows. No ordinary person could take that\npunishment and live.\n\nBut Anti wasn't ordinary. Even for an accidental she was strange,\nliving far inside a deep armor of flesh. It was possible she never felt\nthe crushing force of those blows. And she didn't turn away, try to\nescape. Instead she reached out and grasped the robot, drawing it to\nher. And the geepee lost another advantage, leverage. The bright arms\ndidn't flash so fast nor with such lethal power.\n\n\"Gravity,\" cried Anti. \"Give me all you've got.\"\n\nHer strategy was obvious; she was leaning against the struggling\nmachine. And here at least Docchi could help her. He turned and took\ntwo steps before the surge hit him. Gravity came in waves, each one\ngreater than that before. The first impulse staggered him, and at the\nsecond his knees buckled and he sank to the floor. After that his\neardrums hurt and he thought he could feel the ship quiver. He knew\ndazedly that an artificial gravity field of this magnitude had never\nbeen attained--but the knowledge didn't help him move. He was powerless\nin the force that held him.\n\nAnd it vanished as quickly as it had come. Painfully his lungs\nexpanded, each muscle aching individually. He rolled over and got up,\nlurching past Jordan.\n\nAnti wasn't the inert broken flesh he expected. Already she was moving\nand was standing up by the time he got to her. \"Oof,\" she grunted,\ngazing with satisfaction at the twisted shape at her feet. It was past\nrepair, the body dented and arms and legs bent, the head smashed, the\nelectronic brain in it completely useless.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Docchi in awe.\n\nShe waggled the extremities and waited as if for the signal to travel\nthrough the nerves. \"Nope,\" she said finally. \"Can't feel anything\nbroken. Would have been if I'd tried to stand.\" She moved back to get a\nbetter view of the robot. \"That's throwing my weight around,\" she said\nwith satisfaction. \"At the right time in the right way. The secret's\ntiming. And I must say you took the cue well.\" Her laughter rolled\nthrough the ship.\n\n\"I didn't have anything to do with the gravity,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Who? Jordan--no, he's just getting up.\"\n\n\"Nona,\" said Docchi. \"She was the only one who wasn't doing anything\nelse. She saw what had to be done and got to it before I did. But I\ncan't figure out how she got so much gravity.\"\n\n\"Ask her,\" said Anti.\n\nDocchi grimaced, limping into the control room, followed by Anti\nand Jordan. Nona was at the gravity panel, her face pleasant and\nunconcerned.\n\nThe unprecedented power of the gravity field could be accounted for,\nof course. The ship was old and had seen much use. Connections were\nloose or broken and had somehow crossed, circuiting more power into\nthe gravity generator than it was designed for. Miraculously it had\nheld up for a brief time--and that was all there was to it. And yet the\nexplanation failed to be completely satisfactory. \"I wonder if you had\nanything to do with it,\" he said to her. Nona smiled questioningly.\n\n\"Had to, didn't she?\" said Jordan. \"She was the only one who could have\nturned it on.\"\n\n\"Started it, yes. Increased the power of the field, I don't know,\" said\nDocchi. He outlined what he thought had taken place.\n\n\"That sounds logical,\" agreed Jordan. \"But it doesn't matter how it was\ndone. Gravity engineers would find it interesting. If we had time I'd\nlike to see how the circuits are crossed. We might discover something\nnew.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's interesting,\" said Anti irritably. \"Interesting to\neverybody but me. And I'm pragmatic. All I want to know is: when do we\nstart the rockets? We've got a long way to go.\"\n\n\"There's something that comes before that, Anti,\" said Jordan. \"A\nretracted combustion cap in flight generally means at least one burned\nout tube.\" He made his way to the instruments, checking them glumly.\n\"This time it's three.\"\n\n\"You forgot something yourself, Jordan,\" said Docchi. \"I was thinking\nof the robot.\"\n\n\"I thought we'd settled _that_,\" said Anti impatiently.\n\n\"We have. But let's follow it through. Where did the robot get\ninstructions? Not from Vogel via the radio. The ship's hull cuts off\nthat band. And the last we knew it was in our control.\"\n\n\"Voice,\" said Jordan. \"We freed it. Someone else could take it over.\"\n\n\"Who?\" said Anti. \"None of us.\"\n\n\"No. But think back to when we were loading the tank. We saw it through\nthe telecom and the angle of vision was bad. You couldn't see anything\nthat wasn't directly overhead. Not only the robot but Cameron also\nmanaged to get inside.\"\n\nJordan hefted the weapon. \"So we've got another hunt on our hands. Only\nthis time it's in our favor. Nothing I like better than aiming at a\nnice normal doctor.\"\n\nDocchi glanced at the weapon. \"Take it along. But don't use it. A\nhomicide would ruin us. We could forget what we're going for. Anyway,\nyou won't actually need it. The ship's temporarily disabled and he'll\nconsider that damage enough. He'll be ready to surrender.\"\n\nHe was.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThe doctor was at ease, confident. \"You've got the ship and you've\ncaught me. How long do you think you can keep either of us?\"\n\nDocchi regarded him levelly. \"I don't expect active cooperation but I'd\nlike to think you'll give us your word not to hinder us hereafter.\"\n\nCameron glared at the toaster. \"I won't promise anything.\"\n\n\"We can chain him to Anti,\" suggested Jordan. \"That will keep him out\nof trouble.\"\n\n\"Don't wince, Cameron,\" said Docchi. \"She was a woman once. An\nattractive one too.\"\n\n\"We can put him in a spacesuit and lock his hands behind his back,\"\nsaid Jordan. \"Like the old-fashioned straitjacket.\"\n\nCameron laughed loudly. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nJordan juggled the toaster. \"I can use this to weld with. Let's put him\nin a cabin and close the door, permanently. I'll cut a slot to shove\nfood in--a very narrow slot.\"\n\n\"Excellent. That's the solution. Cameron, do you want to reconsider\nyour decision?\"\n\nCameron shrugged blithely. \"They'll pick you up in a day or less\nanyway. I'm not compromising myself if I agree.\"\n\n\"It's good enough for me,\" declared Anti. \"A doctor's word is as good\nas his oath--Hippocratic or hypocritic.\"\n\n\"Don't be cynical, Anti. Doctors have an economic sense as well as the\nnext person,\" said Docchi. He turned to Cameron. \"You see, after Anti\ngrew too massive for her skeletal structure, doctors reasoned she'd be\nmost comfortable in the absence of gravity. That was in the early days,\nbefore successful ship gravity units were developed. They put her on an\ninterplanetary ship and kept transferring her before each landing.\n\n\"But the treatment was troublesome--and expensive. So they devised a\nnew method--the asteroid and the tank of acid. Not being aquatic by\nnature, Anti resented the change. She still does.\"\n\n\"Don't blame me for that,\" said Cameron. \"I wasn't responsible.\"\n\n\"It was before your time,\" agreed Docchi. He frowned speculatively at\nthe doctor. \"I noticed it at the time but I had other things to think\nabout. Tell me, why did you laugh when Jordan mentioned spacesuits?\"\n\nCameron grinned broadly. \"That was my project while you were busy with\nthe robot.\"\n\n\"To do what? Jordan----\"\n\nBut Jordan was already on his way. He was gone for some time, minutes\nthat passed slowly.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Docchi on Jordan's return. The question was hardly\nnecessary; his face told the story.\n\n\"Cut to ribbons.\"\n\n\"All of them? Even the emergency pack?\"\n\n\"That too. He knew where everything was. Nothing can be repaired.\"\n\n\"So who cares?\" rumbled Anti. \"We don't need spacesuits unless\nsomething happens and we have to go outside the ship.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Anti. How do we replace the defective tubes? From the\noutside, of course. By destroying the spacesuits Cameron made sure we\ncan't.\"\n\nAnti glowered at the doctor. \"And I suppose you merely had our welfare\nat heart. Isn't that so, Cameron?\"\n\n\"You can think anything you want. I did and I do,\" said Cameron\nimperturbably. \"Now be reasonable. We're still in the asteroid zone. In\nitself that's not dangerous. Without power to avoid stray rocks it can\nbe very unpleasant. My advice is to contact the Medicouncil at once.\nThey'll send a ship to take us in.\"\n\n\"Thanks, no. I don't like Handicap Haven as well as you,\" Anti said\nbrusquely. She turned to Docchi. \"Maybe I'm stupid for asking but\nwhat's so deadly about being in space without a spacesuit?\"\n\n\"Cold. Lack of pressure. Lack of oxygen.\"\n\n\"Is that all? Nothing else?\"\n\nHis voice was too loud; it seemed thunderous to him. \"Isn't that\nenough?\"\n\n\"Maybe not for me. I just wanted to be sure.\" She beckoned to Nona and\ntogether they went forward, where the spacesuits were kept. \"Don't do\nanything drastic until I get back,\" she said as she left.\n\nCameron scowled puzzledly and started to follow until Jordan waved the\ntoaster in front of him. \"All right, I see it,\" he growled, stopping\nand rubbing his chin. \"There's nothing she can do. You know it as well\nas I do.\"\n\n\"Do I? Well, for once I'm inclined to agree with you,\" said Docchi.\n\"But you never can tell with Anti. Sometimes she comes up with\nsurprising things. She's not scientifically trained but she has a good\nmind, as good as her body once was.\"\n\n\"And how good was that?\" asked Cameron ironically.\n\n\"Look it up in your records,\" said Jordan shortly. \"We don't talk about\nit ourselves.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe women didn't come back soon, and when they did Cameron wasn't sure\nthat the weird creature that floated into the control compartment with\nNona _was_ Anti. He looked again and saw shudderingly what she had done\nto herself. \"You _do_ need psychotherapy,\" he said bitingly. \"When we\nget back it's the first thing I'll recommend. Can't you understand how\nfool-hardy you're being?\"\n\n\"Be quiet,\" growled Jordan. \"Anti, explain what you've rigged up. I'm\nnot sure we can let you do it.\"\n\n\"Any kind of pressure will do as far as the outside of the body is\nconcerned,\" answered Anti, flipping back the helmet. \"Mechanical\npressure is as satisfactory as air. I had Nona cut the spacesuit in\nstrips and wind them around me, very hard. That will keep me from\nsquishing out. Then I found a helmet that would cover my head when the\ndamaged part was cut away. It won't hold much air pressure even taped\ntight to my skin. It doesn't have to as long as it's pure oxygen.\"\n\n\"So far it makes sense,\" admitted Docchi. \"But what can you do about\ntemperature?\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm going to worry about cold?\" asked Anti. \"Me? Way down\nbelow all this flesh? Mountains and mountains of it?\"\n\n\"I've heard enough,\" said Cameron, standing in front of Anti. \"Now\nlisten to me. Stop this nonsense and take off that childish rig. I\ncan't permit you to ruin my career by deliberate suicide.\"\n\n\"You and your stinking career,\" said Jordan disgustedly. \"You don't\nknow what success is and what it means to give it up. Stay out of this.\nWe don't have to ask your permission to do anything.\" Cameron retreated\nfrom the toaster and Jordan turned to Anti. \"Do you understand what the\nrisk, is, Anti? You know that it may not work at all?\"\n\n\"I've thought about it,\" said Anti. \"On the other hand I've thought\nabout the asteroid. I don't want to go back.\"\n\n\"We should have viewers outside,\" said Docchi. \"One directly in back,\none on each side. At least we'll know what's happening.\"\n\nAt the control panel Jordan began flipping levers. \"They're out and\nworking,\" he said at last. \"Anti, go to the freight ramp. Close your\nhelmet and wait. I'll let the air out slowly. If everything doesn't\nwork perfectly let me know on the helmet radio and I'll yank you in\nimmediately. Once you're outside I'll give you further instructions.\nYou'll find the tools and equipment that opens to space.\"\n\nAnti waddled away. Huge, but she wasn't any bigger than her\ndetermination.\n\nOnce she was gone Jordan looked down at his legless body. \"I hate to\ndo this but we've got to be realistic about it.\"\n\n\"It's the only way we've got a chance,\" answered Docchi. \"Anti's the\nonly one who can do the job. And I think she'll survive.\"\n\nJordan adjusted a dial. \"Cameron had better hope she will,\" he\nmuttered. \"He'll join her if she doesn't.\"\n\nDocchi glanced hastily at the screen. Anti was hanging free in space,\nwrapped and strapped in strips torn from the supposedly useless\nspacesuits. And she was also enclosed in more flesh than any human\nhad borne. The helmet was taped jauntily to her head and the oxygen\ncylinder was fastened to her back. And she lived.\n\n\"How is she?\" he asked anxiously, unaware that the microphone was open.\n\n\"Fine,\" came the reply, faint and reedy. \"The air's thin but it's pure.\"\n\n\"Cold?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Don't feel it yet. Anyway it can't be worse than the acid.\nWhat do I do?\"\n\nJordan gave her directions while the others watched. It required\nconsiderable effort to find the tools and examine the tubes for\ndefectives, to loosen the tubes in the sockets and pull them out,\nsending them spinning into space. It was still more difficult to\nreplace them, though there was no gravity and Anti was held firmly to\nthe hull by magnetics.\n\nAnti had never been a technician of any kind. Cameron was sure of\nit. She was ignorant of the commonest terms, the simplest tool. She\nshouldn't have been able to do it. And yet she managed nicely, though\nshe didn't know how. The explanation must be that she did know, that\nsomewhere in her remote past, of which he was totally uninformed, she\nhad had training which prepared her for this. Such contradiction was\nridiculous. But there was rhythm to her motions, this giant shapeless\ncreature whose bones would break with weight if she tried to stand at\nhalf gravity.\n\nThe whale plowing through the deeps and waves has the attraction of\nbeauty. It can't be otherwise for any animal in an environment which it\nis suited to live in. And the human race had produced, haphazardly, one\nunlikely person to whom interplanetary space was not alien. Anti was\nat last in her element.\n\n\"Now,\" said Jordan, keeping tension out of his voice though it was\ntrembling in his hand. \"Go back to the outside tool compartment. You'll\nfind a lever near it. Pull. This will set the combustion cap in place.\"\n\n\"Done,\" said Anti when it was.\n\n\"That's all. Come in now.\"\n\nShe went slowly over the hull to the cargo ramp and while she did\nJordan reeled in the viewers. The lock was no sooner closed to the\noutside and the air hissing into the intermediate space than he was\nthere, waiting for the inner lock to open.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked gruffly.\n\nShe flipped back the helmet. There was frost on her eyebrows and her\nface was bright and red. \"Why shouldn't I be? My hands aren't cold.\"\nShe stripped off the heated gloves and waggled her fingers.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" protested Cameron with more vehemence than he\nintended. \"You should be frozen through.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Anti with gurgling laughter. \"It's merely a matter of\ninsulation and I have plenty of that. More than I want.\"\n\nShaking his head Cameron turned to Docchi. \"When I was a boy I saw\na film of a dancer. She did a ballet. I think it was called: Free\nSpace-Free Life. Something like that. I can't say why but it came to my\nmind when Anti was out there. I hadn't thought of it in years.\"\n\nHe rubbed his hand over his forehead. \"It fascinated me when I first\nsaw it. I went to it again and again. When I grew older I found out a\ntragic thing had happened to the dancer. She was on a tour of Venus\nwhen the ship she was in was forced down. Searching parties were sent\nout but they didn't find anyone except her. And she had been struggling\nover a fungus plain for a week. You know what that meant. The great\nballerina was a living spore culture medium.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Jordan. \"Shut up.\"\n\nCameron was engrossed in the remembrance and didn't seem to hear.\n\"Naturally she died. I can't recall her name but I can't forget the\nballet. And that's funny because it reminded me of Anti out there----\"\n\n\"I told you to shut up!\" Jordan exploded a fist in the doctor's face.\nIf there had been more behind the blow than shoulders and a fragment\nof a body Cameron's jaw would have been broken. As it was he floated\nthrough the air and crashed against the wall.\n\nAngrily he got to his feet. \"I gave my word I wouldn't cause trouble.\nI thought the agreement worked both ways.\" He glanced significantly at\nthe weapon Jordan carried. \"Better keep that around all the time.\"\n\n\"I told you,\" said Jordan. \"I told you more than once.\" After that he\nignored the doctor, thrusting the weapon securely into his garment.\nHe turned to Anti. \"Very good,\" he said, his anger gone and his voice\ncourtly. \"An excellent performance. One of your best, Antoinette.\"\n\n\"You should have seen me when I was good,\" said Anti. The frost had\nmelted from her eyebrows and was trickling down her cheek. She left\nwith Jordan.\n\nCameron remained behind. It was too bad about his ambition. He knew\nnow he was never going to be the spectacular success he'd once\nenvisioned--not after this escape from Handicap Haven. He'd done all\nhe could to prevent it but it wouldn't count with the Medicouncil that\nhe had good intentions. Still, he'd be able to practice somewhere;\ndoctors were always necessary. There were worse fates--suppose he had\nto abandon medicine altogether?\n\nThink of the ballerina he'd been talking about--she hadn't died as the\nhistory tapes indicated. That much was window dressing; people were\nsupposed to believe it because it was preferable to the truth. It would\nhave been better for that woman if she hadn't lived on. By now he had\nrecalled her name: Antoinette.\n\nAnd now it was Anti. He could have found it out by checking the\nrecords--if Handicap Haven kept that particular information on file.\nHe was suddenly willing to bet that it wasn't there. He felt his\njaw, which ached throbbingly. He deserved it. He hadn't really been\nconvinced that they were people too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We'll stick to the regular lanes,\" decided Docchi. \"I think we'll get\ncloser. They've no reason to suspect we're heading toward Earth. Mars\nis more logical, or one of the moons of Jupiter, or another asteroid.\nI'm sure they don't know what we're trying to do.\"\n\nJordan shifted uneasily. \"I'm against it. They'll pick us up before we\nhave a chance to do anything.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to distinguish us from an ordinary Earth to Mars\nrocket. We have a ship's registry on board. Use it. Take a ship that's\nin our general class and thereafter we'll be that ship. If Traffic\nblips us, and I don't think they will unless we try to land, we'll have\na recording ready. Something like this: 'ME 21 zip crackle 9 reporting.\nOur communication is acting up. We can't hear you, Traffic.'\n\n\"That's quite believable in view of the age and condition of our ship.\nDon't overdo the static effects but repeat it with suitable variations\nand I don't think they'll bother us.\"\n\nShaking his head dubiously Jordan swung away toward the tiny\nfabricating shop.\n\n\"You seem worried,\" said Anti as she came in.\n\nDocchi didn't turn around. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, won't it work?\"\n\n\"Sure. There are too many ships. They can't pick us out among so many.\nAnyway they're not looking for us around Earth. They don't really know\nwhy we took the rocket and escaped.\"\n\n\"Then why so much concern? Once we're near Earth we won't need much\ntime.\"\n\nHis face was taut and tired. \"I thought so too, in the beginning.\nThings have changed. The entire Solar Police force has been alerted for\nus.\"\n\n\"So the Solar Police really want us? But I still don't understand why\nthat changes a thing.\"\n\n\"Look, Anti. We planned to bypass the Medicouncil and take our case\ndirectly to the Solar Government. But if they want us as badly as the\nradio indicates they're not going to be sympathetic. Not at all.\n\n\"And if they're not, if the Solar Government doesn't support us all\nthe way, we'll never get another chance. Hereafter there'll be guards\neverywhere on the asteroid. They'll watch us even when we sleep.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Anti. She seemed trimmer and more vigorous. \"We considered\nit _might_ turn out this way, didn't we? Let's take the last step\nfirst.\"\n\nDocchi raised his head. \"Go to the ultimate authority? The Solar\nGovernment won't like it.\"\n\n\"They won't, but there's nothing they can do about it.\"\n\n\"Don't be sure. They can shoot us down. When we stole the ship we\nautomatically became criminals.\"\n\n\"I know, but they'll be careful, especially after we make contact. How\nwould it look if we were blown to bits in front of their eyes, in a\nbillion homes?\"\n\nDocchi chuckled grimly. \"Very shrewd. All right, they'll be careful.\nBut is it worth it to us?\"\n\n\"It is to me.\"\n\n\"Then it is to me,\" said Docchi. \"I suggest we start getting ready.\"\n\nAnti scrutinized him carefully. \"Maybe we ought to fix you up.\"\n\n\"With fake arms and a cosmetikit? No. They'll have to take us as we\nare, unpretty, even repulsive.\"\n\n\"That's a better idea. I hadn't thought of the sympathy angle.\"\n\n\"Not sympathy--reality. It means too much to us. I don't want them to\napprove of us as handsome unfortunates and then have them change their\nminds when they discover what we're really like.\"\n\nSitting in silence, Docchi watched her go. She at least would benefit.\nDr. Cameron apparently hadn't noticed that the exposure to extreme cold\nhad done more to inhibit her unceasing growth than the acid bath. She\nprobably would never get back to her former size but some day, if the\ncold treatment were properly investigated, she might be able to stand\nat normal gravity. For her there was hope. The rest of them had to keep\non pretending that there was.\n\nHe examined the telecom. They were getting closer. No longer a point\nof light, Earth was a perceptible disc. He could see the outline of\noceans, the shapes of land and the shadows of mountains, the flat\nripple where prairies and plains were; he could imagine people. This\nwas home--once.\n\nJordan came in. \"The radio tape is rigged up. I haven't had to use it\nyet. But we have a friend trailing along behind us, an official friend.\"\n\n\"Has he blipped at us?\"\n\n\"When I left he hadn't. He keeps hanging on.\"\n\n\"Is he overtaking us?\"\n\n\"He'd like to.\"\n\n\"Don't let him.\"\n\n\"With this bag of bolts?\"\n\n\"Shake it apart if you have to,\" said Docchi impatiently. \"How soon can\nyou slide into a broadcast orbit?\"\n\nJordan furrowed his forehead. \"I didn't think we'd planned on that this\ntime. It was supposed to be our last resort.\"\n\n\"Anti and I have talked it over. We agree that this is our last chance.\nNow's the time to speak up if you've got any objections.\"\n\n\"I've been listening to the police calls,\" said Jordan thoughtfully.\n\"No, I guess I haven't got any objection. Not with a heavy cruiser\nbehind us. None at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came together in the control compartment. \"I don't want a focus\nexclusively on me,\" Docchi was saving. \"Nor on Nona either, though I\nknow she's most acceptable. To a world of perfect and beautiful people\nwe may look strange but they must see us as we are. We have to avoid\nthe family portrait effect.\"\n\n\"Samples,\" suggested Anti.\n\n\"In a sense we are, yes. A lot depends on whether they accept those\nsamples.\"\n\nFor the first time Cameron began to realize what they were attempting.\n\"Wait,\" he said urgently. \"You're making a mistake. You've got to\nlisten to me.\"\n\n\"We've got to do this and we've got to do that,\" said Jordan. \"I'm\ngetting tired of it. Can't you understand we're giving orders now?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Docchi. \"Jordan, see that Cameron stays out of the\ntransmitting angle and doesn't interrupt. We've come too far to let him\ninfluence us.\"\n\n\"Sure. If he makes a sound I'll melt the teeth out of his mouth.\"\nJordan held the toaster against his side, away from the telecom but\naimed at Cameron.\n\nThe doctor wanted to break in but the weapon, though small, was very\nreal. And Jordan was ready to use it. That was the only justification\nfor his silence, that and the fact they'd learn anyway.\n\n\"Ready?\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Flip the switch and we will be. I've hooked everything on. They can't\nhelp themselves. They've got to listen.\"\n\nThe rocket slipped out of the approach lanes. It spun down, stem tubes\npulsing brightly, falling toward Earth in a tight trajectory. Down,\ndown; the familiar planet was very large.\n\n\"Citizens of the solar system, everyone on Earth,\" began Docchi. \"This\nis an unscheduled broadcast. We're using the emergency bands because\nfor us it is an emergency. I said we, and you want to know who _we_\nare. Look at us. Accidentals--that's all we can be.\n\n\"We're not pretty. We know it. But there are other things more\nimportant. Accomplishment, contribution to progress. And though it may\nseem unlikely to you there are contributions we can make--if we're\npermitted to do so.\n\n\"But shut away on a little asteroid we're denied our rights. All we\ncan do is exist in frustration and boredom, kept alive whether we want\nto be or not. And yet we can help you as you've helped us--if we're\nallowed to. You can't go to the stars yet, but we can. And ultimately,\nthrough what we learn, you'll be able to.\n\n\"You've listened to experts who say it can't be done, that rockets are\ntoo slow and that the crew would die of old age before they got back.\nThey're almost right, but accidentals are the exception. Ordinary\npeople would die but we won't. The Medicouncil has all the facts--they\nknow what we are--and still they refuse us.\"\n\nAt the side of the control compartment Cameron moved to protest. Jordan\nglanced at him, imperceptibly waggling the weapon. Cameron stopped, the\nwords unspoken.\n\n\"Biocompensation,\" continued Docchi evenly as if nothing had occurred.\n\"Let me explain what it means in case information on it has been\nsuppressed. The principle of biocompensation has long been a matter\nof conjecture. This is the first age in which medical techniques\nare advanced enough to explore it. Every cell and organism tends to\nsurvive as an individual and a species. Injure it and it strives for\nsurvival according to the extent of damage. If it can it will heal the\nwound and live on in its present state. Otherwise it propagates almost\nimmediately. You can verify this by forgetting to water the lawn and\nwatch how soon it goes to seed.\n\n\"Humans aren't plants, you say. And yet the principle applies.\nAccidentals are people who have been maimed and mutilated almost past\nbelief. And our bodies have had the assistance of medical science,\n_real_ medical science. Everyone knows how, after certain illnesses,\nimmunity to that disease can be acquired. And more than blood fractions\nare involved in the process. For us blood was supplied as long as\nwe needed it, machines did our breathing, kidneys replaced, hearts\nfurnished, glandular products in exact minute quantities, nervous and\nmuscular systems regenerated--and our bodies responded. They had to\nrespond or none of us would be here today. And such was the extremity\nof the struggle--so close did we come to it that we gained practical\nimmunity to--death.\"\n\nSweat ran down Docchi's face. He longed for hands to wipe it away.\n\n\"Most accidentals are nearly immortal. Not quite of course; we may die\nfour or five hundred years from now. Meanwhile there is no reason why\nwe can't be explorers for you. Rockets are slow. You'd die before you\ngot to Alpha Centauri and back. We won't. Time means nothing to us.\n\n\"Perhaps better faster rockets will be devised after we leave. You may\nget there before we do. We don't mind. We will have tried to repay you\nthe best way we know how and that will satisfy us.\"\n\nWith an effort Docchi smiled. The instant he did so he felt it was a\nmistake, one he couldn't call back. Even to himself it seemed more like\na snarl.\n\n\"You know where we're kept--that's more polite than saying imprisoned.\nWe don't call it Handicap Haven. Our name for it is: _Junkpile_. And\nwe're junkmen. Do you know how we feel?\n\n\"I don't know how you can persuade the Medicouncil to let us man an\nexpedition to the stars. We've appealed and appealed and they've always\nturned us down. Now that we've let you know it's up to you. Our future\nas humans is at stake. Settle it with your conscience. When you go to\nsleep think of us out there on the junkpile.\"\n\nHe nudged the switch and sat down. His face was gray and his eyes were\nrimmed and burning.\n\n\"I don't want to bother you,\" said Jordan. \"What'll we do about these?\"\n\nDocchi glanced at the telecom. The ships were uncomfortably close and\nconsiderably more numerous than the last time he had looked. \"Take\nevasive action,\" he said wearily. \"Swing close to Earth and use the\nplanet's gravity to give us a good fast sendoff. We can't let them take\nus until people have a chance to make their feelings known.\"\n\n\"Now that you've finished I want to discuss it with you,\" said Cameron.\nThere was an odd tone to his voice.\n\n\"Later,\" said Docchi. \"Save it. I'm going to sleep. Jordan, wake me if\nanything happens. And remember you don't have to listen to this fellow\nif you don't want to.\"\n\nJordan nodded contemptuously. \"I know what he's like. He's got nothing\nto say to me.\"\n\nNona, leaning against the panel, paid no attention to any of them. She\nseemed to be listening to something nobody else could hear, she, to\nwhom sound had no meaning. Docchi's body sagged as he went out. Her\nperpetual air of wondering search for something she could never have\nwas not new but it was no more bearable because of that.\n\nAnd while Docchi slept the race went on against a slowly changing\nbackdrop of stars and planets. Only the darkness remained the same; it\nwas immutable. The little flecks of light that edged nearer hour after\nhour didn't seem cheerful to Jordan. His lips were fixed in a thin hard\nline. His expression didn't alter. Presently, long after Earth was far\nbehind, he heard Docchi come in again.\n\n\"I've been thinking about it,\" said Cameron. \"Nice speech.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Docchi glanced at the screen. The view didn't inspire comment.\n\nCameron was standing at the threshold. \"I may as well tell you,\" he\nsaid reluctantly. \"I tried to stop the broadcast as soon as I found out\nwhat was going on. You wouldn't listen.\"\n\nHe came on into the control compartment. Nona was huddled in a seat,\nher face blankly incurious. Anti was absent, replenishing the acid for\nher robe. \"Do you know why the Medicouncil refused to let you go?\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\"\n\n\"Damn it, I am,\" said Cameron, sweating. \"The Centauri group contains\nseveral planets, just how many we're not sure. From what we know of\ncosmology there's a good chance intelligent life exists there, probably\nnot far behind us in technical development. Whoever goes there will\nbe our representatives to an alien race. What _they_ look like isn't\nimportant; it's their concern. But our ambassadors have to meet certain\nminimum standards. It's an important occasion, our future relations\nrest on. Damn it--don't you see _our_ ambassadors must at least\n_appear_ to be human beings?\"\n\n\"You're not telling us anything new. We know how you feel.\" Jordan was\nrigid with disgust.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" said Cameron. \"You're so wrong. I'm not speaking for\nmyself. I'm a doctor. The medicouncilors are doctors. We graft on or\nregenerate legs and arms and eyes. The tools of our trade are blood and\nbones and intestines. We know very well what people look like from the\ninside. We're well aware of the thin borderline that separates normal\nmen and women from accidentals.\n\n\"Can't you still understand what I'm saying? They're perfect,\neverybody's perfect. Too much so. They can't tolerate small blemishes.\nMore money is spent for research on acne than to support the whole\nasteroid. They rush to us with wrinkles and dandruff. Health, or the\nappearance of it, has become a fetish. You may think the people you\nappealed to are sympathetic but what they feel is something else.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" said Docchi in a low voice.\n\n\"Just this: if it were up to the Medicouncil you'd be on your way to\nthe Centauris. It isn't. The decision wasn't made by us. Actually it\ncame directly from the Solar Government. And the Solar Government never\nacts contrary to public opinion.\"\n\nDocchi turned away, his face wrinkled in distaste. \"I didn't think you\nhad the nerve to stand there and say that.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to. But you've got to know the truth.\" Cameron twisted\nhis head uncomfortably. \"You're not far from Earth. You can still pick\nup the reaction to your broadcast. Try it and see.\"\n\nJordan looked at Docchi who nodded imperceptibly. \"We may as well,\"\nsaid Docchi. \"It's settled now, one way or the other. Nothing we can do\nwill change it.\"\n\nJordan searched band after band, eagerly at first. His enthusiasm died\nand still the reaction never varied. Private citizen or public figure,\nman or woman, the indignation was concealed but nevertheless firm and\nunmistakable. There was no doubt accidentals were unfortunate but they\nwere well taken care of. There was no need to trade on deformity; the\nera of the freak show had passed and it never would return.\n\n\"Turn it off,\" said Docchi at last.\n\nNumbly Jordan complied.\n\n\"Now what?\" he said.\n\n\"Why fight it?\" said the doctor. \"Go back to the asteroid. It'll be\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"Not by us,\" said Docchi dully. \"But there doesn't seem to be any\nchoice. It would have been better if we had tried to work through the\nMedicouncil. We misjudged our allies.\"\n\n\"We knew you had,\" said Cameron. \"We thought we'd let you go on\nthinking as you did. It gave you something to hope for, allowed you to\nfeel you weren't alone. The trouble was that your discontent carried\nyou further than we thought it could.\"\n\n\"We did get somewhere,\" Docchi said. His lethargy seemed to lift\nsomewhat as he contemplated what they'd achieved. \"And there's no\nreason we have to stop. Jordan, contact the ships behind us. Tell\nthem we've got Cameron on board. A hostage. Play him up as their man.\nBasically he's not bad. He's not against us as much as the rest are.\"\n\nAnti came into the compartment. Cheerfulness faded from her face.\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Jordan'll tell you. I want to think.\"\n\nDocchi closed his eyes and his mind to the whispered consultation of\nAnti and Jordan, to the feeble ultimatum to the ships behind them. The\nrocket lurched slightly though the vibration from the exhaust did not\nchange. There was no cause for alarm, the flight of a ship was never\ncompletely steady. Minor disturbances no longer affected Docchi.\n\nWhen he had it straightened out in his mind he looked around. \"If we\nwere properly fueled and provisioned I would be in favor of heading for\nAlpha or Proxima. Maybe even Sirius. Distance doesn't matter since we\ndon't care whether we come back.\" It was plain he wasn't expending much\nhope. \"But we can't make it with the small fuel reserve we have. If we\ncan lose the ships behind us we may be able to hide until we can steal\nfuel and food.\"\n\n\"What'll we do with doc?\" said Jordan. He too was infected with defeat.\n\n\"We'll have to raid an unguarded outpost, a small mining asteroid is\nour best bet. We'll leave him there.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jordan listlessly. \"A good idea, _if_ we can run away from\nour personal escort. Offhand I don't think we can. They hesitated when\nI told them we had Cameron but they didn't drop back. Look.\"\n\nHe looked himself and, unbelievingly, looked again. He blinked rapidly\nbut the screen could report only what there was.\n\n\"They're gone,\" he said, his voice breaking with excitement.\n\nAlmost instantly Docchi was at his side. \"No, they're still following\nbut they're very far behind.\" Even as he looked the pursuing ships\nshrank visibly, steadily losing ground.\n\n\"What's the relative speed?\" said Jordan. He looked at the dials,\ntapped them, pounded on them, but the speed wouldn't change. If it\nhadn't been confirmed by the screen he'd have said that the needles\nwere stuck or the instruments were completely unreliable.\n\n\"What did you do with the rockets?\" demanded Docchi.\n\n\"That's a foolish question. What could I do? We were already at top\nspeed for this piece of junk.\"\n\nAnd there was no way to explain the astonishing thing that had\nhappened. They were all in the control compartment, Cameron, Anti,\nJordan and himself. Nona was there too, sitting huddled up, head\nresting in her arms. There was no explanation at all, unless--Docchi\nscanned all the instruments again. That was when he first noticed it.\n\nPower was pouring into the gravity drive. The useless, or at least long\nunused dial was indicating unheard of consumption. \"The gravity drive\nis working,\" Docchi said.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Anti. \"I don't feel the weight.\"\n\n\"You don't and won't,\" said Docchi. \"The gravity drive was installed to\npropel the ship. When it was proved unsatisfactory for that purpose it\nwas converted, which was cheaper than removing it.\n\n\"The difference between the drive and ordinary gravity is slight but\nimportant. An _undirected_ general field produces weight effects inside\nthe ship. That's for passenger comfort. A _directed_ field, outside it,\nwill drive it. You can have one or the other but not both.\"\n\n\"But I didn't turn on the drive,\" said Jordan in bewilderment. \"It\nwouldn't work for more than a few seconds if I did. That's been proven.\"\n\n\"I'd agree with you except for one thing. It is working, has been\nworking and shows no sign of stopping.\" Docchi stared speculatively at\nNona. She was curled up but she wasn't resting. Her body was too tense.\n\"Get her attention,\" he said.\n\nJordan gently touched her shoulder. She opened her eyes but she wasn't\nlooking at them. On the panel the needle of a once useless dial rose\nand fell.\n\n\"What's the matter with the poor dear?\" asked Anti. \"She's shaking.\"\n\n\"Let her alone,\" said Docchi. \"Let her alone if you don't want to\nreturn to the asteroid.\" No one moved. No one said anything. Minutes\npassed and the ancient ship creaked and quivered and ran away from the\nfastest rockets in the system.\n\n\"I think I can explain it,\" said Docchi at last, frowning because\nhe couldn't quite. There were things that still eluded him. \"Part\nof the gravity generating plant--in a sense the key component--is\nan electronic computer, capable of making all the calculations and\njuggling the proportion of power required to produce directed or\nundirected gravity continuously. In other words a brain, a complex\nmechanical intelligence. But it was an ignorant intelligence and it\ncouldn't see why it should perform ad infinitum a complicated and\nmeaningless routine. It couldn't see why and because it couldn't very\nsimply it refused to do so.\n\n\"It was something like Nona. She's deaf, can't speak, can't communicate\nin any way. Like it she has a very high potential intelligence and\nalso, in the very same way, she's had difficulty grasping the facts of\nher environment. Differently though, she does have some contact with\npeople and she has learned something. How much she knows is uncertain\nbut it's far beyond what psychologists credit her with. They just can't\nmeasure her type of knowledge.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jordan dubiously. \"I'll agree about Nona. But what is she\ndoing?\"\n\n\"If there were two humans you'd call it telepathy,\" said Docchi. It\nupset his concepts too. A machine was a machine--a tool to be used. How\ncould there ever be rapport? \"One intelligence is electronic, the other\norganic. You'll have to dream up your own term because the only thing\nI can think of is extra sensory perception. It's ridiculous but that's\nwhat it is.\"\n\nJordan smiled and flexed his arms. Under the shapeless garment muscles\nrippled. \"To me it makes sense,\" he said. \"The power was always there\nbut they didn't know what to do with it.\" The smile broadened. \"It\ncouldn't have fallen into better hands. We can use the power, or rather\nNona can.\"\n\n\"Power?\" said Anti, rising majestically. \"If you mean by that what it\nsounds like, I don't care for it. All I want is just enough to take us\nto Centauri.\"\n\n\"You'll get there,\" said Docchi. \"A lot of things seem clearer now. In\nthe past why did the drive work so poorly the further out it got? I\ndon't think anyone investigated this aspect but if they had I'm sure\nthey'd have found that the efficiency was inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the distance from the sun.\n\n\"It's what you'd expect from a deaf, blind, mass sensitive brain, the\ngravity computer. It wouldn't be aware of the stars. To it the sun\nwould seem the center of the universe and it would no more leave the\nsystem than our remote ancestors would think of stepping off the edge\nof a flat world.\n\n\"And now that it knows differently the drive ought to work anywhere.\nWith Nona to direct it, even Sirius isn't far.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking about, doc?\" said Jordan carelessly. \"If I were\nyou I'd be figuring a way to get off the ship. Remember we're going\nfaster than man ever went before.\" He chuckled. \"Unless, of course, you\n_like_ our company and don't want to leave.\"\n\n\"We've got to do some figuring ourselves,\" said Docchi. \"There's\nno use heading where there are no stars. We'd better determine our\ndestination.\"\n\n\"A good idea,\" said Jordan, hoisting himself up to the charts. He\nbusied himself with interminable calculations. Gradually his flying\nfingers slowed and his head bent lower over the work. Finally he\nstopped, his arms hanging slack.\n\n\"Got it?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Jordan. \"There.\" Dully he punched the telecom selector and\na view took shape on the screen. In the center glimmered a tiny world,\na fragment of a long exploded planet. The end of their journey was\neasily recognizable.\n\nIt was Handicap Haven.\n\n\"But why are we going there?\" asked Anti. She looked at Docchi in\namazement.\n\n\"We're not going voluntarily,\" he said, his voice flat and spent.\n\"That's where the Medicouncil wants us. We forgot about the monitor\nsystem. When Nona activated the gravity drive it was indicated at some\ncentral station. All the Medicouncil had to do was take the control\naway from Nona.\"\n\n\"We thought we were running away from the ships,\" said Anti. \"We were,\nbut only to beat them back to the junkpile.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Docchi. \"Nona doesn't know it yet.\"\n\n\"Well, it's over. We did our best. There's no use crying about it.\" Yet\nshe was. Anti passed by the girl, patting her gently. \"It's all right,\ndarling. You tried to help us.\"\n\nJordan followed her from the compartment. Cameron remained, coming over\nto Docchi. \"Everything isn't lost,\" he said awkwardly. \"The rest of you\nare back where you started but at least Nona isn't.\"\n\n\"Do you think she'll benefit?\" asked Docchi. \"Someone will, but it\nwon't be Nona.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. Suddenly she's become important.\"\n\n\"So is a special experimental machine. Very valuable but totally\nwithout rights or feelings. I don't imagine she'll like her new status.\"\n\nSilence met silence. It was the doctor who turned away. \"You're sick\nwith disappointment,\" he said thickly. \"Irrational, you always are when\nyou glow. I thought we could talk over what was best for her but I can\nsee it's no use. I'll come back when you're calmer.\"\n\nDocchi glared sightlessly after him. Cameron was the only normal who\nwas aware that it was Nona who controlled the gravity drive. All the\noutside world realized was that it was in operation--that at last it\nwas working as originally intended. If they should dispose of Cameron--\n\nHe shook his head. It wouldn't solve anything. He could fool them for a\nwhile, pretend that he was responsible. But in the end they'd find out.\nNona wasn't capable of deception--and they'd be very insistent with a\ndiscovery of this magnitude.\n\nShe looked up and smiled. She had a right to be happy. Until now she\nhad been alone as few people ever are. But the first contact had been\nmade and however unsatisfactory--what could the limited electronic mind\nsay?--in other circumstances it might have presaged better days. She\ndidn't know she was no less a captive than the computer.\n\nAbruptly he turned away. At the telecom he stopped and methodically\nkicked it apart, smashing delicate tubes into powder. Before he left he\nalso demolished the emergency radio. The ship was firmly in the grip of\nthe monitor and it would take them back. There was nothing they had to\ndo. All that remained for him was to protect Nona as long as he could.\nThe Medicouncil would start prying into her mind soon enough. He hoped\nthey'd find what they were after without too much effort. For her sake\nhe hoped they would.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPerfectly synchronized to their speed the outer shell of the dome\nopened, closing behind them before they reached the inner shell. It\ntoo gaped wide to swallow them, snapping shut like a quickly sprung\ntrap. Jordan set the controls in neutral and dropped his hands,\nmuttering to himself. They glided to a stop over the landing pit,\nthereafter settling slowly. Homecoming.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said Cameron jauntily. \"You're not prisoners.\"\n\nNona alone seemed not to mind. Docchi hadn't said anything for hours\nand the light was gone from his face. Anti wasn't with them; she was\nback floating in the acid tank. The reentry into the gravity field of\nthe asteroid made it necessary.\n\nThe ship scraped gently; they were down. Jordan mechanically touched a\nlever, flicked a switch. Passenger and freight locks swung open. \"Let's\ngo,\" said Cameron. \"I imagine there's a reception committee for us.\"\n\nEven he was surprised at what was waiting. The little rocket dome held\nmore ships than normally came in a year. The precise confusion of\nmilitary discipline was everywhere. Armed guards lined either side of\nthe landing ramp and more platoons were in the distance. It was almost\namusing to see how dangerous the Medicouncil considered them.\n\nNear the end of the ramp a large telecom had been set up. If size\nindicated anything someone thought this was an important occasion.\nFrom the screen, larger than life, Medicouncilor Thorton looked out\napprovingly.\n\n\"A good job, Dr. Cameron,\" said the medicouncilor as the procession\nfrom the ship halted. \"We were quite surprised at the escape of our\naccidentals and your disappearance which coincided with it. From what\nwe were able to piece together, you followed them deliberately. A\nsplendid example of quick thinking, doctor. You deserve recognition.\"\n\n\"I thought it was my fault for letting them get so far. I had to try to\nstop them.\"\n\n\"No doubt it was. But you atoned, you atoned. I'm sorry I can't\nbe there in person to congratulate you but I'll arrive soon.\" The\nmedicouncilor paused discreetly. \"At first the publicity was bad, very\nbad. We thought it unwise to try to conceal it. Of course the broadcast\nmade it impossible to hide anything. Fortunately the discovery of the\ngravity drive came along at just the right time. When we announced it\nopinion began swinging in our direction. I don't mind telling you the\nnet effect is now in our favor.\"\n\n\"I hoped it would be,\" said Cameron. \"I don't want them to be hurt.\nThey're all vulnerable, Nona especially, because of what she is. I've\nthought quite a bit about how she should be approached----\"\n\n\"I'm sure you have.\" The medicouncilor smiled faintly. \"Don't let\nyour emotions run away with you. In due time we'll discuss her. For\nthe present see that she and the other accidentals are returned to\ntheir usual places. Bring Docchi to your office at once. He's to be\nquestioned privately.\"\n\nIt was a strange request and mentally Cameron retreated. \"Wait. Are you\nsure you want Docchi? He's the engineer but----\"\n\n\"No objections, doctor,\" said Thorton sternly. \"Important people are\nwaiting. Don't spoil their good opinion of you.\" The telecom snapped\ninto darkness.\n\n\"I think you heard what he said, Dr. Cameron.\" The officer at his side\nwas very polite, perhaps because it emphasized the three big planets on\nhis tunic.\n\n\"I heard,\" said Cameron irritably. \"I don't want to argue with\nauthority but since I'm in charge of this place I demand that you\nfurnish a guard for this girl.\n\n\"So you're in charge?\" drawled the officer. \"You know I've got a funny\nfeeling I'm commander here. My orders said I was to replace you until\nfurther notice. I haven't got that notice.\" He looked around at his men\nand crooked a finger. \"Lieutenant, see that the little fella--Jordan,\nI think his name is--gets a lift back to the main dome. And you can\nwalk the pretty lady to her room, or whatever it is she lives in.\nDon't get too personal though unless she encourages it.\" He smiled\ncondescendingly at Cameron. \"Anything else I can do to oblige a fellow\ncommander?\"\n\nCameron glanced at the guards. They were everywhere he looked,\nsmartly uniformed, alert. There was no indication of amusement in the\nexpressions of those near enough to have heard the conversation. They\nwere well disciplined. \"Nothing else, General,\" he said stonily. \"Keep\nher in sight. You're responsible.\"\n\n\"So I am,\" remarked the officer pleasantly, winking at the lieutenant.\n\"Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMedicouncilor Thorton was waiting impatiently on the screen in\nCameron's office. The attitude suited him well, as if he'd tried many\nand found slightly concealed discourtesy best for the personality\nof the busy executive. \"We'll arrive in about two hours,\" he said\nimmediately. \"By this I mean a number of top governmental officials,\nscientists, and some of our leading industrialists. Their time is\nvaluable so let's get on with this gravity business.\"\n\nHe caught sight of the commander. \"General Judd, this is a technical\nmatter. I don't think you'll be interested.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. I'll stand guard outside.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor was silent until the door closed. \"Sit down, Docchi,\"\nhe said with unexpected solicitude, pausing to note the effect. \"I can\nsympathize with you. Everything within your reach--and then to return\nhere. Well, I can understand how you feel. But since you did come back\nI think we can arrange to do things for you.\"\n\nDocchi stared at the screen. A spot of light pulsed in his cheek\nand then flared rapidly over his face. \"You probably will,\" he said\ncasually. \"But what about theft charges? We stole a ship.\"\n\n\"A formality,\" declared the medicouncilor with earnest simplicity.\n\"With a thing like the discovery, or rediscovery, of the gravity drive,\nno one's going to worry about an obsolete ship. How else could you test\nyour theories except by trying them out in actual flight?\"\n\nThe medicouncilor was dulcet, coaxing. \"I don't want to mislead you.\nMedically we can't do any more for you than we have. However you'll\nfind yourself the center of a more adequate social life. Friends, work,\nwhatever you want. In return for this naturally we'll expect your\ncooperation.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Cameron, walking to the screen and standing squarely in\nfront of it. \"I don't think you realize Docchi's part----\"\n\n\"Don't interrupt,\" glowered Thorton. \"I want to reach an agreement at\nonce. It will look very good for us if we can show these famous people\nhow well we work with our patients. Now, Docchi, how much of the drive\ncan you have on paper by the time we land?\"\n\n\"He can't have anything,\" Cameron started shouting. \"I tried to tell\nyou--he doesn't know----\"\n\n\"Look out,\" cried Thorton too late.\n\nCameron's knees buckled and he clutched his legs in pain. Again Docchi\nkicked out and the doctor fell down. Docchi aimed another savage blow\nwith his foot that grazed the back of Cameron's head. Blood trickled\nfrom his mouth and he stopped trying to get up.\n\n\"Docchi,\" screeched Thorton, but there was no answer.\n\nDocchi crashed through the door. The commander was lounging against the\nwall, looking around vacantly. Head down Docchi plunged into him. The\ntoaster fell from his belt to the floor. With scarcely a pause Docchi\nstamped on it and continued running.\n\nThe commander got up, retrieving the weapon. He aimed it at the\nretreating figure and would have triggered it except that it didn't\nfeel right in his hand. He lowered it and quickly examined the damaged\nmechanism. Sweating, he slipped it gingerly into a tunic pocket.\n\nMuffled shouts were coming from Cameron's office, growing in vehemence.\nThe general broke in.\n\nThe medicouncilor glared at him from the screen. \"I see that you let\nhim get away.\"\n\nThe disheveled officer straightened his uniform. \"I'm sorry, sir.\nI didn't think he had that much life in him. I'll alert the guards\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Never mind now. Revive that man.\"\n\nThe general wasn't accustomed to resuscitation; saving lives was out of\nhis line. Nevertheless in a few minutes Cameron was conscious, though\nsomewhat dazed.\n\n\"Now, doctor, who does know something about the gravity drive if it\nisn't Docchi?\"\n\nCameron shook his head groggily. \"It was an easy mistake,\" he said.\n\"Cut off from communication with us the drive began to work. How, why,\nwho did it? Mostly who. Not me, I'm a doctor, not a physicist. Nor\nJordan; he's at best a mechanic. Therefore it had to be Docchi because\nhe's an engineer.\" He stopped to wipe the blood from his cheek.\n\n\"For God's sake tell me,\" said Thorton. \"It couldn't be----\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cameron with quiet satisfaction. \"It wasn't Anti either.\nThe last person you'd think of. The little deaf and dumb girl the\npsychologists wouldn't bother with.\"\n\n\"Nona?\" said Thorton incredulously.\n\n\"I told you,\" said Cameron and proceeded to tell him more, filling in\nthe details.\n\n\"I see. We overlooked that possibility,\" said the medicouncilor\ngravely. \"Not the mechanical genius of an engineer. Instead the strange\ntelepathic sense of a girl. That puts the problem in a different light.\"\n\n\"It's not so difficult though.\" Cameron rubbed the lump on the back of\nhis head. The hair was bristling, clotted with blood. \"She can't tell\nus how she does it. We'll have to find out by experiment, but it won't\ninvolve any danger. The monitor can always control the drive.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor laughed shakily, teetering backward. \"The monitor\nis worth exactly nothing. We tried it. For a microsecond it seemed to\ntake over as it always has on other units--but this gravity generator\nslipped away. We thought Docchi found a way to disengage the control\ncircuit.\"\n\n\"But it wasn't Docchi who told the computer how to do it.\"\n\n\"We figured it out when we thought it was Docchi,\" growled the\nmedicouncilor wearily. \"He was sensible, that's all. It was the only\nreasonable thing a man could do, come back and take advantage of his\ndiscovery.\" He shook his head in perplexed disgust. \"Why the girl\nreturned is beyond me.\"\n\n\"Do you think----\" said Cameron and then wished he'd left it unsaid.\n\n\"Yes, by God, I do think.\" The medicouncilor's fist crashed down.\n\"Docchi knows why. He found out in this room and we told him. As soon\nas he knew he escaped.\"\n\nPanic slipped into Thorton's face and then was gone, covered over\nalmost at once by long habits of sudden decisions. \"She could have\ntaken the ship anywhere she wanted and we couldn't stop her. Since\nshe's here voluntarily it's obvious what she wants--the asteroid.\"\n\nThe medicouncilor tried to shove himself out of the screen. \"Don't\nyou ever think, General? There's no real difference between gravity\ngenerators except size and power. What she did on the ship she can do\nas easily here.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said the startled officer. \"I'll get her. I'll find the\ngirl and Docchi too.\"\n\n\"Never mind him,\" choked the medicouncilor. \"I don't care how you do\nit. Take Nona at once, without delay.\"\n\nThe time had passed for that command. The great dome overhead trembled\nand creaked in countless joints. But the structure held though\nunexpected stresses were imposed on it. And the tiny world shivered,\ngroaning and grumbling at the orbit it had lain too long in. Already\nthat was changing--the asteroid began to move.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nVague shapes were stirring. They walked if they could, crawled if\nthey couldn't--fantastic and near-fantastic creatures were coming\nto the assembly. Large or tiny, on their own legs or borrowed ones\nthey arrived, with or without arms, faces. The news had spread fast,\nby voice or written message, sign language, lip reading, all the\nconceivable ways that humans communicate, not the least of which was\nthe vague intuition that something was going on that the person should\nknow about. The people on Handicap Haven sensed the emergency.\n\n\"Remember it will be hours or perhaps days before we're safe,\" said\nDocchi. His voice was hoarse but he hadn't noticed it yet. \"It's up to\nus to see that Nona has all the time she needs.\"\n\n\"Where is she hiding?\" asked someone in the crowd.\n\n\"I don't know. I wouldn't tell you if I did. They might pry it out of\nyou. Right now our sole job is to keep them from finding her.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded someone else near the front. \"Do you expect us to fight\nthe guards?\"\n\n\"Not directly,\" said Docchi. \"We have no weapons for that, no armament.\nMany of us have no arms in another sense. All we can do is to obstruct\ntheir search. Unless someone can think of something better, this is\nwhat I plan:\n\n\"I want all the men, older women and the younger ones who aren't\nsuitable for reasons I'll explain later. The guards won't be here for\nhalf an hour--it will take that long to get them together and give them\norders. When they do come the first group will attempt to interfere in\nevery possible way with their search.\n\n\"How you do it I'll leave to your imagination. Appeal to their sympathy\nas long as they have any. Put yourself in dangerous situations. They\nhave ethics and at first they'll be inclined to help you. When they do,\ntry to steal their weapons. Avoid physical violence as much as you can.\nWe don't want to force them into retaliation--they'll be so much better\nat it. Make the most of this phase of their behavior. It won't last\nlong.\"\n\nDocchi paused to look over the crowd. \"Each of you will have to decide\nfor himself when to drop passive resistance and start the real battle.\nAgain, you may be able to think of more things than I can tell you\nbut here are some suggestions. Try to disrupt the light, scanning and\nventilation systems. They'll be forced to keep them in repair. Perhaps\nthey'll even attempt to guard all the strategic points. So much the\nbetter for us--there'll be fewer guards to contend with.\"\n\n\"What about me?\" called a woman from far in back. \"What can I do?\"\n\n\"You're in for a rough time,\" Docchi promised. \"Is Jeriann here?\"\n\nJeriann elbowed her way through the crowd to his side. Docchi glanced\nat her. He'd seen her many times but never so close. It was hard to\nbelieve that she should be here with the rest of them. \"Jeriann,\"\nsaid Docchi to the accidentals, \"is a normal pretty woman--outwardly.\nHowever she has no trace of a digestive system. The maximum time she\ncan go without food and fluid absorption is ten hours. That's why she's\nwith us and not on Earth.\"\n\nDocchi scanned the group. \"I'm looking for a miracle. Is there a\ncosmetechnician who thinks she can perform one? Bring your kit.\"\n\nA legless woman propelled herself forward. Docchi conferred at\nlength with her. At first she was startled, reluctant to try but\nafter persuasion she consented. Under her deft fingers Jeriann was\ntransformed. When she turned around and faced the crowd she was no\nlonger herself--she was Nona.\n\n\"She can get away with the disguise longer and therefore she'll be the\nfirst Nona they find,\" explained Docchi. \"I think--hope--that they'll\ncall off the search for a few hours after they take her. Eventually\nthey'll find out she isn't Nona when they can't get her to stop the\ndrive. Fingerprints or x-rays would reveal it at once but they'll be so\nsure they have her that it won't occur to them. Nona is impossible to\nquestion as you know and Jeriann will give as good an imitation as she\ncan.\n\n\"As soon as they discover that the girl they have is Jeriann they won't\nbother to be polite. Guards will like the idea of finding attractive\ngirls they can manhandle in the line of duty especially if they think\nit will help them find Nona. It won't, but I think they'll get too\nenthusiastic and that in itself will hold up the search.\"\n\nNo one moved. The women in the crowd were still, looking at each other\nin silent apprehension. Jordan started them. He twisted his head,\ngrimacing. \"Let's get busy,\" he said somberly.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Docchi. \"I have one Nona. I need more volunteers, at least\nfifty. It doesn't matter whether the person is physically sound or not,\nwe'll raid the lab for plastic tissue. If you're about her size and can\nwalk and have at least one arm come forward.\"\n\nAnd slowly, singly and by twos and threes, they came to the platform.\nThere were few indeed who wouldn't require liberal use of camouflage.\nIt was primarily on these women their hopes rested.\n\nThe other group followed Jordan out, looking at Docchi for some sign.\nWhen he gave them none they hurried on determinedly. He could depend on\nthem. The sum total of their ingenuity would produce some results.\n\nMass production of an individual. Not perfect in every instance--good\nenough to pass in most. Docchi watched critically, suggesting\noccasional touches that improved the resemblance. \"She can't speak\nor hear,\" he reminded the volunteers. \"Remember it at all times no\nmatter what they do. Don't scream for help, we won't be able to. Hide\nin difficult places. After Jeriann is taken and the search called off\nand then resumed, let yourselves be found, one at a time. We can't\ncommunicate with you and so you'll just have to guess when it's your\nturn. You should be able to tell by the flurry of activity. That will\nmean they've discovered the last person they captured wasn't Nona.\nEvery guard that has to take you in for examination is one less to\nsearch for the girl they really want. They'll have to find Nona soon or\nget off the asteroid.\"\n\nThe cosmetechnicians were busy and they couldn't stop. But there was\none who looked up. \"Get off?\" she asked. \"Why?\"\n\nHe thought he'd told everyone. She must have arrived late. It was\nsatisfying to repeat it. \"Handicap Haven is leaving the solar system,\"\nhe said.\n\nHer fingers flew, molding the beautiful curve of a jaw where there had\nbeen none. Next, plastic lips were applied that were more lifelike than\nany this woman had ever created.\n\nSoon Nona was hiding in half a hundred places.\n\nAnd one more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe orbit of Neptune was behind them, far behind, and still the\nasteroid accelerated. Two giant gravity generators strained at the\ncrust and core of the asteroid. The third clamped an abnormally heavy\ngravity field around the fragment of an isolated world. Prolonged\nphysical exertion was awkward and doubly exhausting. It tied right in;\nthe guards were not and couldn't be very active. Hours turned into\na day and the day passed too--and the generators never faltered. It\nseemed they never would.\n\n\"Have you figured it out precisely? It's your responsibility, you\nknow,\" said Docchi ironically. \"You share our velocity away from the\nsun. You'll have to overcome it before you start going back. If you\nwait too long you might not be able to reach Earth.\"\n\nSuperficially the general seemed to ignore him but the muscles in his\njaw twitched. \"If we could only turn off that damned drive.\"\n\n\"That's what we're trying to do,\" said Vogel placatingly.\n\n\"I know. But if we could do it without finding her.\"\n\nThe resident engineer shrugged sickly. \"Go ahead. Try it. I don't want\nto be around when you do. I know, it sounds easy, just a couple of\ngravity generators. But remember there's also a good sized nuclear pile\ninvolved.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" muttered the general morosely. \"Damned atomics not\nworth inventing. Nothing you can do with them, always too touchy.\" He\nglowered at the darkness overhead. \"On the other hand we can take off\nand blow this rock apart from a safe distance.\"\n\n\"And lose all hope of finding her?\" taunted Docchi.\n\n\"We're losing her anyway,\" commented Vogel sourly.\n\n\"You're getting way from the perspective. It's not as bad as that,\"\ncounselled Docchi. \"Now that you know where the difficulty is you can\nalways build other computers and this time furnish them with auxiliary\nsenses. Or maybe give them the facts of elementary astronomy.\"\n\n\"Now why didn't I think of that?\" said Vogel disgustedly. \"You don't\nneed me here, do you, General? If not I'd like to go back to my ship.\"\nThe general grunted consent and the engineer left, lurching under the\nmassive gravity.\n\n\"There's even another solution though it may not appeal to you,\" said\nDocchi cautiously. \"I can't believe Nona is altogether unique. There\nmust be others like her, so-called 'born mechanics' whose understanding\nof machinery is a form of intelligence we haven't suspected.\nLook hard and you may find them, perhaps in the most unlikely or\nunlovely bodies.\" It didn't show but inwardly he was smiling. He was\nharassing them effectively from this end. Hope was sometimes the most\ndemoralizing agent.\n\nGeneral Judd growled wearily. \"If I thought you knew where she is----\"\n\nDocchi stiffened, glowing involuntarily.\n\n\"Forget the dramatics, General,\" said Cameron with distaste.\n\"Resistance we'd have had in any event. He's responsible merely for\nmaking it more effective.\"\n\nHe frowned heavily, continuing. \"At the moment what he's trying to do\nis obvious. He needn't bother tearing down our morale though--it's\nalready collapsed. I can't think of a thing we can do that will help\nus.\" He wished the medicouncilor had been able to land; he needed\nfurther instructions. His own role wasn't clear and he kept thinking,\nthinking.... He should stop thinking. Of course the ship that carried\nthe medicouncilor couldn't actually touch on the asteroid--there were\ntoo many important people aboard and they couldn't risk being taken\nout of the system. Still, the medicouncilor _might_ have spared a few\nminutes to discuss things with him. He knew what he ought to do.\n\nThe sun was high in the center of the dome. Sun? It was much more like\na very bright star. It cast no shadows; it was the lights in the dome\nthat did. They flickered and with monotonous regularity went out again.\nEach time the general swore constantly and emotionlessly until service\nwas restored.\n\nA guard approached, walking warily behind his captive. He saluted\nnegligently. \"I think I've found her, sir.\"\n\nCameron looked at the girl. \"I don't think you have. And it seems to me\nyou were unnecessarily rough.\"\n\nThe guard smirked with bland insolence. \"Orders, sir.\"\n\n\"Whose orders?\"\n\n\"Yours, sir. You said she couldn't talk or make any kind of a sound. It\nwas the easiest way to make sure. She didn't say a thing.\"\n\nCameron turned to the general but saw he'd get no support there. Judd\nwas scowling, completely indifferent to the guard's behavior.\n\nThe doctor snapped open the sharp scalpel and thrust it savagely deep\nin the girl's thigh. She looked at him with a tear-stained face but\ndidn't complain or move a muscle.\n\n\"Plastic tissue as any fool can plainly see,\" said Cameron dourly. His\nrage was growing.\n\nThe guard stared, twisting his lips. \"Let her go,\" snapped the doctor.\n\nThe girl darted away. The guard saluted stiffly and left, rubbing his\nhands against his uniform. He'll go and scrub his hands, because he\ntouched her, Cameron thought wearily.\n\n\"I have a request to make,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" said the general cholerically. \"We're apt to give you\nwhat you want. If you don't see it, just ask. We'll send out and get\nit.\"\n\n\"You might at that.\" Docchi was smiling openly. \"You're going to leave\nwithout Nona, and very soon. When you go, don't take all the ships. You\nwon't need them but we will, when we get to another system.\"\n\nThe general started to reply but his anger was greater than his\nepithets. There was nothing left to use, and so he remained silent.\n\n\"Don't say anything you'll regret,\" cautioned Docchi. \"When you get\nback, what will you report? Can you tell your superiors that you left\nin good order, while there was still time to continue the search?\nOr will they like it better if they know you stayed until the last\nminute--so late that you had to transfer your men and abandon some\nships? Think it over. I have your interests at heart.\"\n\nThe general swallowed with difficulty, his face reddening at first and\nthen becoming quite white. Wordlessly he stamped away. Cameron looked\nafter the retreating officer and in a few minutes followed. But he\nwalked slower and the distance between doctor and officer grew greater.\nDocchi was beginning to relax at the nearness of victory and didn't\nnotice where either of them went.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last rocket disappeared, leaving a trail behind that overwhelming\ndarkness soon extinguished. The sun was now one bright star among many,\nwhich one was sometimes difficult to say. And the asteroid itself\nseemed subtly to have been transformed, more spacious than it had been\nand not so dingy--and it was not hard to find a reason--it had become a\nminiature world, a tiny system complete in itself.\n\n\"I think we can survive,\" said Docchi. \"We've got power and we can\nreplenish the oxygen. We'll have to grow or synthesize our food but\nactually the place was set up originally to do just that. It will take\nwork to make everything serviceable again--but we've always wanted\nsomething more than meaningless routine.\"\n\nThey were sitting beside the tank, which had been returned to the usual\nplace. A tree rustled in the artificial breeze and the grass around\nthem had been torn and trampled by the guards. It seemed more peaceful\nbecause of the violence which had lately swept over them. Now it had\nebbed and it would never come back.\n\nJordan teetered beside the tree. \"We'll find some way to get Anti out\nof the tank,\" he said. \"When Nona comes back maybe we can rig up a null\ngravity place--something to make Anti more comfortable. And of course\nwe've got to continue the cold treatment.\"\n\n\"I can wait,\" said Anti, \"I've already waited a long time.\"\n\nDocchi glanced around; his eyes were following his mind, which was\nwandering and searching.\n\n\"Now there's no need to worry,\" said Anti. \"The guards were rough with\nsome of the women but plastic tissue doesn't feel pain and so they\nescaped with fewer injuries than you'd believe. As for Nona, well, she\ncan look out not only for herself but the rest of us as well.\"\n\nIt was almost true; she seemed fragile, ethereal even, but she wasn't.\nAnd her awareness began where that of normal humans left off. And\nwhere her perceptions ended no one knew, least of all herself. Right\nthere was a source of trouble. \"I think we should start looking,\" said\nDocchi. \"At the last moment, upset at leaving and not knowing or caring\nwho she was, one of the guards might have----\" The enormity of the\nthought was too great to complete.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Anti. The ground vibrated, felt rather than heard. \"As\nlong as the gravity is functioning can there be any doubt?\"\n\nIn his mind there could be. Nona had started it but once the gravity\ncomputer was informed of the nature of the universe there was no reason\nto suppose that it wouldn't keep running indefinitely. It existed to\nperform such tasks. It didn't actually have volition--but that applied\nto stopping as well.\n\n\"I think I can convince you,\" said Jordan. \"First you'll have to turn\naround.\"\n\nDocchi scrambled to his feet and there she was coming toward them,\nfresh and rested. There was a smudge on her cheek but she might have\ngot that from some machine she'd stopped to investigate on the way\nhere. Her curiosity was not limited and there was nothing mechanically\nso insignificant that it escaped her attention.\n\n\"Where were you?\" asked Docchi, expecting no reply. She smiled and for\na moment he thought she knew what he asked. He was relieved that she\nwas safe--and that was all. Something was missing in the reactions he\nexpected from himself but he couldn't say where. At one time he had\nthought--and now he no longer did. Perhaps it was an expression of the\nnew freedom they had all achieved.\n\nJordan looked at him quizzically, half penetrating the screen he'd\nthrown over his lack of emotions. \"It's not as bad as you think. She\nunderstands some things. Machines.\"\n\nAnd a machine he was not. He wasn't even a complete human. Perhaps that\nwas where the difference was.\n\n\"She's a born mechanic, such as never existed. It's about time one\nappeared in the human race. We've worked with machines long enough to\nevolve someone who understands them without having to study and learn.\nI'm that way myself, a little. Nothing like her.\"\n\nThey all knew that. Even on Earth they were probably busy revising\ntheir intelligence ratings. \"That doesn't change our problem--her\nproblem.\"\n\nJordan hesitated. \"The idea's pretty vague but we've made one advance:\nwe know she can think.\"\n\n\"We always did,\" said Anti.\n\n\"Sure, we did. But doctors and psychologists weren't convinced and they\nwere the ones who were studying her. Now it's up to us.\"\n\nThere was a difference. No matter what they'd thought, previously\nthey'd been patients, and it was axiomatic that the patient's ideas\nwere largely ignored. Now they had stepped into a dual role, patient\nand doctor, subject and experimenter, the eye at the microscope and the\nobject on the slide.\n\nThey all had second-hand medical training--with long association some\nof it had rubbed off on them. There wasn't one of them who didn't\nknow his own body far better than the average man. That knowledge,\nsubjective though it was, could be pooled. Fortunately they had a well\nequipped hospital to work with.\n\n\"We'll have to get busy on Nona,\" continued Jordan. \"Where are we\ngoing? She knows but we don't. There's got to be some way to find out.\"\n\nIt hadn't mattered before--it was enough that they were leaving. But\nonce they had achieved that, new problems were thrusting up every\ndirection they looked. \"What do you suggest?\" asked Docchi.\n\n\"An oscillograph,\" said Jordan triumphantly.\n\nDocchi shook his head. \"No good. She's been around them often enough to\nshow an interest if she really feels any.\"\n\n\"Maybe she could learn to write, actually, on the screen.\"\n\n\"She hasn't changed and I doubt if her interests have. From what we\nknow she doesn't use words; she thinks directly in terms of mechanical\nfunction. The gravity computer was the first thing she found complex\nenough to arouse her interest.\"\n\n\"But she's always been near the computer.\"\n\n\"That's not so. She came here years ago and though there was a computer\nin the ship that brought her she wasn't mature enough to use it. Since\nthen she's been kept away from the main computers the same as the rest\nof us have been.\"\n\nJordan leaned on his hands and rocked thoughtfully. \"She learned all\nthat during the few hours we were on the ship?\"\n\n\"It was days,\" said Docchi. \"Yes, she did. It was the only opportunity\nshe had.\" It was a strange language she'd learned, the code a complex\ncomputer used inside itself, the stop, go; current and no current;\nthe electron stream; the mechanical memory rocked back and forth\nmagnetically--and all the while the whisper of a steel tape as it\ncoiled and uncoiled. It was possible that only a computer would ever\nbe able to understand the girl. And yet she was a creature of flesh,\nbones, glands, nerves, and blood flowing through her veins in response\nto the intangible demands of life.\n\nAnti stirred restlessly. Waves of acid spilled over the sides and where\nthe fluid touched, grass curled and blackened. \"I said I'd wait but I\ndidn't say I liked waiting. Why don't you two get busy?\"\n\n\"I was thinking where to begin,\" said Jordan. He hoisted himself onto\na repair robot he'd taken for himself. It was an uncomfortable vehicle\nfor anyone else but it seemed just right for him.\n\nDocchi got up; there was no question where to start. Anything they\nconsidered needed something done. In the struggle for freedom, in their\nresistance to the guards, they'd overlooked it. They'd have to reorient\ntheir outlook. Perhaps that was the biggest thing that confronted them.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" Anti called out as they left. The picture Docchi looked\nback to was unforgettable--the tank and Anti in it, Nona sitting in\nblank pensiveness under the tree. One was capable of near miracles with\nseemingly little effort, but at times she seemed inert. The other was\nraw vitality with an urge to live--but there was hardly any time she\ncould stand upright.\n\nDocchi hurried along, trying to keep up with Jordan. He lengthened his\npace but still the gap grew. After a while he slowed down, attempting\nto assess the damage the guards had done as he passed by evidence of\ntheir destructiveness.\n\nVisibly they seemed to have torn everything apart but actually not much\nhad been destroyed. Mostly the repairs would consist in reassembling\nmachines and structures that had been dismantled. This wasn't the\nresult of consideration. Until the last moment the general had been\ncertain he'd find Nona and hence retain possession of the asteroid.\nIf he had, the unnecessary violence would have been hard to explain.\nLucky--because the guards _could_ have wrecked the place.\n\nThey'd still have difficulty; even able-bodied men would, and they were\nfar from that. They were not equipped for an expedition of this nature\nand somehow they'd have to build what they lacked. Light and heat, the\nfunction of power, was automatic, and the oxygen supply was nearly so.\nIt was with the lesser things they'd have trouble. Some food had always\nbeen brought in, and now that supply was gone. It would have to be\nreplaced. They could do without other luxuries now that they had the\nbiggest one--freedom to do what they wanted.\n\nDocchi himself was a good engineer and Nona couldn't be too highly\nevaluated. Between them they could convert unnecessary equipment into\nsomething they needed. Two geepees and a repair robot taken apart and\nproperly reassembled might equal some inconceivable machine that would\ngo a long way toward solving problems of food, air, meteor detection or\nwhat have you. It was a thought.\n\nJordan clung perilously to the robot as it rumbled along. \"Where is\neveryone?\" he called back.\n\n\"Asleep, I guess,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Sleeping, when there's so much to be done?\"\n\nHabit had taken over. The mechanisms of the asteroid were still\noperating as they were set to function. The lighting in the dome\nindicated it was time and so they slept. But there were no hours, days,\nweeks, and moments any more, nothing but necessity to guide them.\n\n\"We'll change this,\" said Docchi. \"Most of us have been treated as\ninvalids so long we believe it. We'll divide up in groups and from now\non somebody will always be awake, working or watching, or both.\"\n\nIt was obvious what the watch would be for. Empty space--but how empty?\nThe region near Sol had been explored but what lay beyond? Between the\nsun and Alpha Centauri there might be many interstellar masses large\nenough to smash the asteroid. They'd have to take precautions.\n\nJordan sent the machine along faster as if to compensate for others'\ninactivity. Presently he stopped abruptly, waiting for Docchi to catch\nup. He glanced down in front of his machine. \"Here's one of them who\nwas very sleepy,\" he said. \"Unless----\"\n\nDocchi looked at her. It was one of the Nonas who hadn't yet removed\nthe disguise. The cosmetechnicians had done their work well and it was\ndifficult to say who she was. There was a startling resemblance to the\ngirl they'd just left with Anti. She was curled up in an uncomfortable\nposition and it was obvious she wasn't there by choice.\n\nJordan swung off the machine and felt her pulse. \"There is one,\" he\nmuttered, carefully looking her over. \"Can't see anything,\" he said at\nlast. \"At first I thought the guards had done it but there's no broken\nbones nor, as far as I can tell, internal injuries. She ought to have a\nmedical examination.\"\n\nStartled, Docchi glittered. Medical care was one of the luxuries they'd\nhave to do without. They needn't fear epidemics; they were isolated\nand their bodies were phenomenally resistant to disease and anyway the\nantibiotics they had would quell any known infections. But here was\nsomething they hadn't accounted for. \"There are a few people around who\nused to be nurses,\" said Docchi. \"We'd better get them.\"\n\n\"Where?\" grunted Jordan. \"She needs attention now.\"\n\nJordan was right; the girl couldn't wait. Part of the difficulty was\nthat there were so many accidentals with peculiarities. What was safe\nfor one accidental might be deadly to another. They had to know who the\ngirl was before they could decide whether to do anything. The disguise\nhad helped them get away but it was hurting them now. \"Can you pry off\nthe makeup?\" he asked.\n\n\"Without the goop they carry in the cosmetic kit? Hardly. I'd tear her\nown face off.\"\n\nIt could mean her death to move her before something was done--but what\nwas that something? She would know; everyone did. They were all experts\non their own ailments and could give down to the last item on their\nprescription, diet or exercise, a concise analysis of what they had to\ndo to maintain their health.\n\nJordan shook her gently, harder when that failed. Presently she\nstirred, her eyes fluttered and she whispered something.\n\n\"Ask her who she is,\" said Docchi, but that was impossible. It had\ntaken strength to respond at all and after she'd used it the girl had\nlapsed back in the coma.\n\n\"She didn't say,\" said Jordan helplessly. \"She whispered one\nword--food. That was all.\"\n\nFood. Docchi knelt beside her to check his conclusions. Now that he\nwas close he could see that her skin was extraordinarily smooth and\nlustrous. Her face, arms, legs, even her hands, and if they removed\nher clothing the rest of her body would be the same. Her skin and the\nmention of food told him what he needed to know. It was Jeriann, the\nfirst volunteer Nona--and the first real casualty.\n\nHe could reconstruct with some accuracy what had happened. After\nCameron discovered who she was she'd been kept in custody and given\nmedical care. As the search wore on and more guards were sent out to\nsearch she had managed to escape, hiding from the guards. But she\nhad remained hidden too long and had collapsed trying to get to the\nhospital.\n\nHunger shock, simply that, but with her hunger was a traumatic\nexperience. Having no digestive system at all she was always close to\nstarvation. \"Pick her up. It won't hurt her,\" said Docchi. \"Let's rush\nher to the dispensary.\"\n\nJordan hoisted the limp girl to the top of the repair robot, wrapping\nextensibles around her, adjusting them so they held her. He got on\nbeside her, reaching into the controls and squeezing extra speed out of\nthe makeshift ambulance.\n\nDocchi was not far behind, arriving at the hospital not long after\nJordan and his passenger did. The dispensary was on the first floor and\nso Jordan wheeled the robot directly to the door. He dismounted and\nlifted Jeriann off.\n\nInside the dispensary there was little that had actually been broken.\nThis was remarkable considering how thoroughly the guards had ransacked\nthe hospital. But someone with a grim sense of humor had seen to it\nthat the medical preparations were hopelessly intermixed, scattered\nover the floor in complete confusion. For the present emergency it\ncouldn't have been worse if everything _had_ been broken.\n\nDocchi stared down at the litter, his face twitching as he glanced back\nat Jeriann.\n\n\"It's in here somewhere,\" said Jordan. \"How do we find it in a hurry?\"\n\n\"See if there are names or symbols on them.\"\n\nJordan was close to the floor anyway; he leaned down and began pawing\nhastily but with extreme care through the confusion of medicals. Every\nbit of it was precious even though they didn't know what it was.\nSomeone could use it, had to have it, and eventually they'd be able to\nplace whom it was intended for. \"No names,\" said Jordan as he continued\nto look.\n\nDocchi was afraid of that, but it was a thought for the future.\nHereafter there _would_ be names on everything so that even if it got\ndisplaced they'd be able to identify it. The medical administration\nmust have been exceedingly lax. \"What about symbols?\" he said quickly.\n\n\"There seem to be some. Don't know what they mean.\" Jordan brightened.\n\"We can look in the files.\"\n\nDocchi bent his body. He'd observed that when he entered. \"Won't do\nany good. The files are scattered too.\" And that was an act of wanton\nhatred. It hadn't helped the guards find Nona.\n\nJordan stopped scrabbling through the piles of miscellaneous bottles,\ncapsules, and vials. \"Then we've got to go for help,\" he said slowly.\n\"There's got to be somebody who knows what she takes looks like.\"\n\nHe couldn't condemn her so easily and that's what it would mean if she\nwasn't attended to in the next few minutes. There was a line beyond\nwhich the body couldn't pass without extreme damage, perhaps death.\nAnd she'd been close to it when they found her. Docchi began to review\ndesperately what he knew of Jeriann. It wasn't much. There were too\nmany accidentals for him to know all of them.\n\nFirst, she never ate or drank. Her needs in this respect were supplied\nmedically. That was why her skin was so soft and evenly beautiful. It\nwas not a reflection of inner health. If anything it was due to the\nmethod of intake. _And that told him what he had to know._\n\nAnother accidental might have guessed it instantly, but there were\nvarious kinds of accidentals, groups within groups, and their\npeculiarities varied so widely that few knew what all of them were. In\none sense Jeriann was a deficient.\n\n\"I think we can find it. Look for the largest capsule,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, but it won't work,\" said Jordan, sweeping\nhis arm around to indicate how impossible the request was. \"She gets\nall her food and water that way so it has to be the largest. But which\none? Some of the preparations are supposed to last for weeks. They\nmight be bigger than hers.\"\n\n\"It's simpler than you suppose. I don't know what her schedule is but\nit must be at least five times daily, and massive at that. It would be\nexceedingly painful, not to say inconvenient, if she got all her food\nand fluid needs by injection.\"\n\n\"Absorption capsules,\" exclaimed Jordan. \"Why didn't I think of that?\nThat makes it easy.\"\n\n\"Don't be so sure. There are other deficients,\" cautioned Docchi.\n\nJordan had cleared a space around him and was already separating the\npreparations. At first glimpse the absorption capsules were like any\nother container--and then they weren't. The shape was not quite regular\nand the outside was soft to the touch, almost like human flesh. That's\nwhat it was, almost. And in time, when properly applied, that's what it\ndid become.\n\nFurther, there was a thin film on one side. When this was peeled off\nand the exposed surface was pressed against the body, only surgery\ncould remove it.\n\nJordan gazed in indecision at the absorption capsules he'd assembled in\nthe cleared space near Jordan. \"Which one is hers?\" he said doubtfully.\n\"They're all alike.\"\n\nActually they weren't. There were subtle differences in size and shape\nthat would enable anyone who was familiar with it to distinguish his\npreparation from any other. Another deficient might say which was\nJeriann's since generally they'd be more observant of these matters.\nBut it did no good to wish that the girl's friends were here. \"We'll\nhave to keep looking,\" said Jordan, hitching himself over to the heap\nof medicals he'd just gone through.\n\nIt hadn't worked out as well as he'd expected. Reflection should have\nshown it wouldn't. The capsules were expensive and difficult to make\nand so they wouldn't be used except where the sheer volume and the\nrepetitive nature of the injection required it. There was probably no\ncase on the asteroid as extreme as Jeriann's, but once a day instead of\nfive was still repetition. \"There's nothing in that pile,\" said Docchi\nharshly. \"You've gone through it and I watched.\"\n\nJordan paused; he knew it too. \"What'll we do?\"\n\n\"Simplify it. Toss out the smaller ones until only fifteen are left.\"\nThere was no real reason for selecting that figure, none but this: in\nher dazed condition she'd have time for one glance. If it wasn't there,\nit just wasn't.\n\nJordan complied, exceedingly dextrous when he had to be, though more\nthan dexterity was involved. Visual comparison had to suffice and it\nwas never harder to make. \"That look about right?\" asked Jordan when he\nfinished.\n\n\"It should be one of them,\" said Docchi. He was guessing. They both\nknew they were. The capsules were set near Jeriann, about the size of\na man's fist. One of them, the one for Jeriann, was remarkably small\nconsidering it had to supply the total needs of a human body. For a\nfraction of a day only, a fourth or a sixth, but even so it was little.\nShe must be always hungry. It would never do to mention food to her.\n\nJordan raised her up gently, tilting her limp body so she could see\nwhat she had to choose from. He glanced at Docchi for confirmation and\nthen began to slap her. Still the consciousness was buried deep. He hit\nher harder until breath ran shudderingly into her lungs. \"Which one?\"\nhe asked quickly, as soon as her eyes flickered open, running over the\narray of capsules.\n\nHe grabbed the one she seemed to indicate, holding it closer. \"Is this\nit?\" Her eyes dropped shut and she couldn't answer. Jordan laid her\ndown. He wiped his hands on the sacklike garment. \"She recognized this\none,\" he said, not looking at Docchi.\n\nSo she had, but was it recognition of something that was _hers_? \"I\ncould see that. We'll give it to her.\"\n\n\"Should I sterilize it or something?\"\n\nJordan wanted to delay because he wasn't sure. And they couldn't delay,\neven if it was the wrong thing. It might be like giving sugar to a\nperson in a diabetic coma, the certain way of finishing him off faster.\nAnd yet with Jeriann it had to be done. Actually very little time had\nelapsed since they found her, five or ten minutes. What they didn't\nknow was how long she'd lain there.\n\nDocchi shook his head. \"The absorption capsule was meant to be\nadministered under any condition. Outside of puncturing it and\nsquirting in a virus culture there's no way to harm it. It's\nself-sterilizing.\"\n\n\"I forgot,\" said Jordan. \"Where'll I give it to her?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. Oh, I guess maybe her thigh. It may sink in faster since\nshe's gone so long without.\"\n\nJordan brushed her skirt up and carefully peeled off the film on one\nside, making certain the exposed surface didn't come in contact with\nhis hand. The capsule contracted as the film came off, rhythmically\nwrithing. The shape changed too; it was like nothing so much as a giant\namoeba. Quickly Jordan thrust the raw surface of the squirming thing on\nJeriann's thigh. It was not alive but it was capable of motion and it\nmoved a quarter of an inch before it adhered.\n\nIt stuck there. It was one with the girl, it _was_ her; and the correct\ninjection or not it couldn't be removed. The fluid in that pseudobody\nwas being injected into Jeriann through the countless pores it\ncovered--through her skin without a puncture. It was no wonder her skin\nwas radiantly beautiful--five times a day an area of ten to fifteen\nsquare inches. In a short time her body would be covered, and she never\ncould use the same place on successive days. She achieved clarity and\nflawlessness of complexion, but at a price. At a price.\n\nJordan wiped his forehead. \"Shouldn't we be seeing some results?\" he\nsaid anxiously.\n\n\"It has a long way to go,\" Docchi assured him. \"Into her bloodstream\nand to her muscles and glands, to her brain. In a minute now if we\ndon't see some results we'll know we've failed.\"\n\nThey waited.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nDocchi slumped in the chair, looking the place over with some\nsatisfaction. The medical inventory was proceeding quite well; one by\none each preparation was being identified and the local source checked.\nIt wasn't nearly as bad as he had assumed at first; they were nearly\nself-sufficient.\n\nOne of the checkers came in. Docchi recognized her vaguely; he'd seen\nher around but that was all. He didn't know who she was nor what she\ndid. Unless he was mistaken her arms and legs were her own, a trifle\nheavy but shapely enough. If there was anything about her that was\ncamouflaged with plastic tissue it was her face--the sullen glamour was\nan exaggeration of nature and moreover her expression didn't change\nat all as she came nearer. There must be something with her face that\ncouldn't be corrected surgically and so she'd overcompensated.\n\n\"We've got it all done,\" she said in a flat throaty voice. Glamour\nthere too, in about the same degree.\n\n\"What?\" he said. \"Oh yes, the check of the biologicals. All\nidentified?\" He recalled her name, Maureen something or other.\n\n\"Everything that people claimed. There was some that no one knew what\nit was. Useless I suppose, or worse. It ought to be destroyed.\"\n\nThat was a logical assumption any time save now. Medicine was precious\nand had to be hoarded even if they didn't know what it was. \"Save it,\nMaureen. Sooner or later someone will be in for it.\"\n\n\"They've all been in. You don't know how they rushed here when they\nlearned the dispensary had been ransacked by the guards.\" She smiled\nwith faint disdain.\n\nHe was beginning to doubt whether her expression came out of the\ncosmetic kit; it was applied with extraordinary skill if it had,\nflexible enough to allow her to smile without seeming strained. But\nif it actually was her face it was monotonous. How long could she\nkeep up the glamour? \"Don't be condescending, Maureen. Of course they\nwere concerned. There are people who need those preparations to live\ncomfortably, some in order to live at all.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"I've personally contacted all the regular\ndeficients.\"\n\nShe seemed to know more about it than he did. There was a fraternity of\nthe ailing and degrees of confraternity. Within the accidentals there\nwere special groups, allied by the common nature of their infirmity.\nIt was possible she belonged to some such group or knew someone who\ndid. The latter probably; there seemed to be nothing seriously wrong\nwith her. \"What do you suppose happened? Why is there some left?\" said\nDocchi. \"If everyone's been here all of it ought to be accounted for.\"\n\n\"They're always experimenting,\" said Maureen.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Doctors,\" she said. \"They try the latest ideas out on us and if we\nsurvive they use it on normal people.\"\n\nThere was some truth in it--not much, but the bitterness was there\nthough Earth and all it stood for was far behind. \"Don't blame them.\nThey've got to make improvements,\" he said in mild reproof.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Maureen. \"Anyway, what I was saying is that\nthere is some stuff we can't place. In each case it substitutes for one\nor more substances that have been in use up to now. We don't know who\nit's for.\"\n\nIt was more serious than he thought, if only in a negative sense. He\nstraightened up. \"How many are missing biologicals?\"\n\n\"I didn't keep track accurately. Thirty or forty.\"\n\nA small number compared to the total. _But thirty or forty invalids?_\nAnd some would be affected seriously, depending on the nature of the\npreparation that couldn't be traced to the person who should have it.\nThe man whose unaided body couldn't utilize calcium would certainly be\nin for trouble but not as soon as he who couldn't make use of, say,\niron. \"We'll find out,\" he said with a confidence he didn't altogether\nfeel. \"There are records around and we'll look into them.\" There were\nrecords but it was uncertain how complete they were after the guards\nhad scattered them. \"Do you know where they're kept?\"\n\nShe shook her head, the sullen glamorous smile transfixing her face. \"I\nwish I did,\" she said.\n\nHe was struck by the intensity. \"Why?\" he asked. He wanted to know too\nbut it wasn't an emotional thing.\n\n\"Don't you know? I'm one of them.\"\n\nOne of what, he was about to ask before he realized she meant she was\na deficient whose salvaged body lacked certain physiological elements.\nMore, she was one whose preparation couldn't be identified. \"Don't\nworry. It'll take us a little while to trace everything but we'll have\nit straightened out in a matter of days.\"\n\n\"You'd better,\" she said, and it was not exactly a threat. There were\novertones he couldn't account for.\n\nBefore he could stop her she began loosening her dress and for the\nfirst time he saw that she wasn't breathing, that she never did. Her\ndress fluttered as the air went in and out, sleeping or waking, without\nvolition, responding mechanically to the needs of her bloodstream.\nThe breathing mechanism was hidden in her body, replacing her lungs.\nMoreover it was probably connected to her speech centers in such a\nway to release a certain amount to her throat when the nervous system\ndemanded. Perhaps it accounted for the peculiar vibrant quality of her\nvoice.\n\nShe pointed to the tube that was showing. \"It's not just lungs I lack,\"\nshe said. \"Everyone, man or woman, manufactures both male and female\nhormones, in different proportions of course. Except me. I don't\nproduce a single male hormone.\" She stared at him intently.\n\n\"Do you know what that means?\" Her voice was rising, terror mingled\nwith something else. \"Without injections in a few months I'll be\ncompletely female. One hundred per cent woman and nothing else.\"\n\nHe thought he saw her grow more feminine before his eyes; reluctantly\nhe turned away. Theoretically the completely female person should be\nrepulsive, yet she wasn't. If anything, pathetic features dominated.\n\nPure feminity could destroy her, but how long would it take? He could\ndiscount her own estimate as arbitrary. She had decided on it in an\nattempt at self dramatization.\n\n\"You're fortunate,\" he said, and he couldn't keep his eyes from\nstraying back to her. \"There are plenty of people around, both men\nand women, who can be donors. There must be some way to extract the\nhormones you need from the bloodstream. Our medical techniques may be\ncrude but we'll manage. Keep that in mind.\"\n\n\"I will--will you?\" she asked, her lips parted, and it wasn't to\nbreathe because she couldn't.\n\nHe had the uncomfortable feeling that he knew exactly what she meant\nand it didn't have anything to do with what he'd said. Had she even\nbeen listening? Probably she hadn't. A pure male or female creature\ndidn't exist but if one should come into being it would scarcely be\nhuman. To a human life mattered or death did but to the pure abstract\ncreature there was only one thing of importance.\n\nHe looked up to see her coming toward him. \"I'm afraid,\" she said,\nclasping him to her, carefully keeping the tube free and open. And she\nwas afraid--it was not dramatization. The studied glamour slipped from\nher face. \"I don't want to be like this,\" she whispered. \"But if it\nhappens--help me, please.\" Her nearness was overpowering, and deadly.\n\nAt length she drew away. Terror left her eyes--and it had been there,\nreal though with other factors. Even in fear, and he was conscious of\nthat and her deeper design, she had planned ahead against the time she\nmight not be wholely human. It was something like to death to change\ndrastically from a thinking reasoning person to someone who could react\nonly to one stimulus.\n\n\"We'll see that nothing happens to you,\" he said with weak assurance.\n\"There may be a delay but it won't be long. We'll work it out.\"\n\nShe was regarding him fixedly and he could see she was reverting.\nWhat he said wasn't penetrating. He cleared his throat. \"You're as\nfamiliar with the place as any of us. Look around and see if you can\nfind duplicate records. There may be a clue in them as to what the new\npreparations are for.\" Clarity returned to her face as he spoke. It\nwould leave again and come back at decreasing intervals unless or until\nthe hormone deficiency was corrected. How far she could descend and\nremain mentally unscathed he didn't know, nor did he want to find out.\n\"Don't leave until I come back. Do you understand?\"\n\nShe smiled invitingly to show that perhaps she did understand what he\nsaid. He knew now that the sullen glamour was real, and terrifying. She\ncouldn't help any of her responses. Docchi hurried out; so little time\nhad elapsed she must be nearly normal.\n\nHe thought of locking the door but there was no way to do that. The\nessence of a hospital was free access at all times, and so it was\nbuilt. Besides, it wasn't a good idea to try to keep her in. Constraint\nmight produce violent reaction.\n\nDocchi slanted the louvers so that the place looked vacant and let it\ngo at that. The best he could hope for was that Maureen wouldn't think\nof leaving.\n\nHe walked away. There were villages. Planned or otherwise, over the\nyears dwellings and dormitories had gradually grown around three main\ncenters. Externally there was not much to distinguish one village from\nthe other except the distance from the hospital. The buildings nearest\nwere little more than very large machines which fed, bathed, and tried\nto anticipate the intellectual stimulation of the almost helpless\ntenants. The houses in the farthest village, except for certain\npeculiarities, were much like any comfortable dwelling on Earth.\n\nAt the third village he found the house, glancing at the tiny light\non the door. It was glowing; the occupant was at home. The numbered\npositions flashed on, indicating further that the person was awake\nand in bed. This information was necessary on the asteroid where many\npeople suffered from some disability which might strike suddenly,\nleaving them helpless and unattended. Docchi leaned against the button\nand the light blinked him in.\n\nJeriann was sitting up in the middle of the bed; she seemed healthy and\nalert. \"How do you feel?\" he asked as he caught a chair with his foot\nand slid it near her.\n\nShe made a wry face and smiled. \"Fine.\"\n\n\"No polite answers, please. Do you feel like work?\"\n\n\"Now that you're here, no.\" She laughed outright at his discomfiture.\n\"Maybe now you'll believe me when I say I'm all right. Do you?\"\n\nShe didn't wait for his answer but smoothed the covers around her.\n\"You're the one who found me, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Jordan really. I was there.\"\n\nShe didn't attempt to thank him; help was expected. No one knew when\nhis turn would come. \"I guess you're wondering what I was doing there\nwithout my capsules.\"\n\nHe wasn't but he'd listen if she felt she had to talk. \"It seemed\nstrange you'd forget something like that. But everyone was confused\nthen.\"\n\n\"Not me. I knew exactly what I was doing. I was running from some big\nlunk who kept chasing me all over the dome. He knew I wasn't Nona\nbecause I yelled for him to leave me alone. He didn't pay any attention\nand I guess I lost the absorbics just before he caught me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to talk about it if it's painful,\" he said impassively.\n\n\"What do you think?\" she said scornfully. \"You think I'd let _him_\nbother me? I told him to go away or I'd slip my face off. He got sick\nright there and let go.\"\n\nHe smiled at her vigor. \"It's a good thing he didn't take you at your\nword and let you remove the disguise.\"\n\n\"Thank you, kind sir. Now I know I'm pretty too.\" Her manner overcame\nthe apparent sharpness. \"Anyway there I was. I'd used up more energy\nthan usual and I had nothing to take. I didn't make it to the hospital.\"\n\n\"I didn't know the details but I imagined something like that. You're\nlucky we found you and even more so that we were able to discover your\nparticular absorbics in the dispensary mess.\"\n\n\"Right both times--but you didn't find my absorption capsules. They\nweren't there. Never are. I have to go directly to the lab to get them.\nOf course I couldn't expect you to know that.\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here, alive?\" he asked, frowning. \"The wrong\nthing should have killed you.\"\n\n\"I'm not a true deficient, you know. It's not that my body fails\nto produce glandular substances. What I lack is food and water and\nanything that's composed mostly of that will do, providing it's in a\nform I can assimilate. When you slapped me and held me up I saw someone\nelse's capsule but I knew it would do. That person has trouble with a\nnumber of blood sugars and several fluids--not what I require for a\ncomplete diet--but it brought me out of the hunger shock.\"\n\nIt was not ordinary hunger which had caused her to stumble and be\nunable to get up; this was acute, a trauma which affected her whole\norganism. And because it was such a constant threat, unconsciously\nor not, she had prepared for it. Deficients knew each other better\nthan any other group. They were aware which prescription could in an\nemergency be substituted for their own. It was unlikely to be used--but\nthat knowledge had paid off for Jeriann.\n\nThe house ticked on as he sat watching her. That was another\npeculiarity of the place, aside from the lack of kitchen or any room\nwherein she could eat. She didn't need it and so it hadn't been built.\nShe didn't feel hunger except negatively; it would be easy to die if\nshe should decide to do so. And so, to reinforce her will to live, a\ncomprehensive schedule had been imposed from above. But the most rigid\npersonal schedule meant nothing without time. Time took the place of\nhunger, of the need for food, of all the savour in it.\n\nThere were clocks on the wall, inconspicuous dials or larger ones,\nintegrated in pictures and summed up in designs. There was a huge\ncircular chronograph on the ceiling; hourglasses and sundials were\ncontrived in the motif on the floor--and they all seemed actually\nto function. And when she slept or whether she didn't, there were\narrangements for that too. The house vibrated, ever so softly, but the\nattuned senses could hear it, feel it, in sickness and in health.\n\n\"Damn,\" muttered Jeriann as the vibration momentarily grew louder. She\ntried to say something to Docchi but her thoughts were confused and she\ncouldn't concentrate. \"Don't mind me,\" she said, smiling ruefully. \"I\nwas conditioned to this sort of thing. They seem to think I've got to\nbe ready on the dot.\"\n\nShe could see that it wasn't very clear. \"There's a clock in my head\ntoo. Everybody has one naturally but mine has been trained. Any natural\nbeat will regulate the self alarm, even the pounding of my heart, even\nif I don't think about it--but the house is more effective. _They_ said\nI had to have it if I expected to live.\"\n\nIt was obvious who _they_ were, the psychotechnicians who had attended\nher after her original accident. They were right but Docchi could see\nthat it might become annoying.\n\nThe ticking grew in volume and the house shook and though Jeriann tried\nto ignore it, it would not let her be. \"Time,\" tolled the house, though\nthe word was unspoken, \"time time time.\" To Docchi it was subdued and\nsoft but it had a different effect on Jeriann.\n\n\"All right,\" she shouted to the tormenter, scrambling out of bed. She\ndashed into the next room, scooping up hurriedly an absorbic capsule\nthat lay unnoticed on a shelf near the door. She was gone for some\ntime, so long that Docchi was beginning to worry before she came out.\n\nIn the interim, she had changed into street clothing and the tension\nthat had marked her departure was gone. \"I feel better,\" she said\ncheerfully. \"Breakfast, such as it was, and a shower.\"\n\nShe sat opposite him. \"I can see you're trying to figure out how I took\na shower when you couldn't hear water running. Special shower. Don't\nask about it.\"\n\nDocchi had no intention, though he was wondering. He had his own\ngadgets to help him get dressed and no one was curious about them.\n\n\"You came here for something,\" said Jeriann. \"Thanks for being polite\nand talking to the patient but now you can tell me what it is.\"\n\nHe was considering whether he should ask someone else. It was complex,\ntoo difficult to explain to Nona. Anti, who would have been best, was\nconfined to the tank. And Jordan wouldn't do at all. That left only\nJeriann, who was capable enough, _if_ she was fully recovered. \"Do you\nknow Maureen?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do. Can I guess what she's done now?\" said Jeriann dryly.\n\n\"Your guess is probably right, except that she hasn't done it yet. I\nwant to make certain she doesn't.\" He thought over Jeriann's reply.\n\"This isn't the first time this has happened to her?\"\n\n\"Of course it isn't. She's always looking for excuses. Long ago, before\nyou came, I think, she managed to throw the stuff away and pretend\nshe'd taken it. She concealed what she'd done for three weeks, until\nthe doctor discovered it.\"\n\nHe hadn't heard this, even as a whispered legend. He'd been too busy\ntrying to achieve new status for the accidentals to bother with gossip.\nHe didn't know the people here as well as Jeriann did; he'd have to\ndraw on her for detailed information. \"This time it's not an excuse.\nThe deficiency prescription isn't there for her to take.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Jeriann sharply. \"I remember thinking in that split\nsecond in the dispensary: If I were only Maureen now, the worst that\ncould happen to me is that I'd attract attention.\"\n\nHe glanced at her. She hadn't thought that at all, though it was a\nreflection of another sort of bitterness. The girl didn't know how\nlucky she was in comparison to others who were seriously handicapped.\n\"Could you go and take a look?\" he asked. \"Maureen said it isn't there.\nI understand that they do experiment occasionally. The new consignment\nmight have got shoved aside in the excitement we had a while back--or\nit might be there under a different formula that Maureen can't\nidentify.\" If what Jeriann said was correct, Maureen liked the idea of\nbecoming an all female woman. To her it might seem an anodyne, surcease\nfrom disappointment and things that hadn't gone right.\n\n\"Sure, I'll go,\" said Jeriann. Her cheerfulness had diminished while he\nspoke. Until now she hadn't actually realized there was no longer Earth\nto signal to in event of an emergency. \"It's true they experiment.\nAnd maybe they _didn't_ send the last shipment during our mixup.\" She\ntossed her head, recovering her buoyancy rapidly. \"Oh well, I'll go and\ntake a look. I know the hospital pretty well.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Docchi got up.\n\n\"Wait for me,\" said Jeriann, going to a drawer and taking things out.\nShe slipped a watch on her arm; there was another in the rather wide\nbelt she wore. She selected a series of absorption capsules and dropped\nthem into pouches on the belt that appeared to be merely ornamental\nuntil he saw what went into it. \"Lunch, a drink, and an extra one for\nemergency,\" she explained laconically.\n\n\"I should think you'd require more fluid.\"\n\nShe looked at him disturbingly. \"I would, if I had normal metabolism.\nBut remember I don't need fluid for the digestive process. And then to\nfurther reduce the intake they've included an antiperspirant in what I\ndo get.\"\n\nHe followed her to the door, where she turned around and looked back\nat the place she lived in. It was a small, curious house, completely\narranged for the kind of person she was.\n\n\"Are you going to the hospital with me?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, there's some work I've got to do near here.\"\n\n\"Well, then, thanks for saving my life.\" She slipped her arms around\nhim and kissed him, quickly but satisfactorily. Her lips were cool and\ndry. Very smooth but dry; her touch was like silk. That was because of\nher skin.\n\nShe smiled and opened the door. \"See you,\" she said as they parted. She\nnever once looked back though he did. He was glad, because she might\nhave waved and it would have been impossible to return it.\n\nTwice, now, within an hour, he thought as he went along. Maureen of\ncourse he could dismiss since she would respond to anything that was\nremotely male. It was not at all the same reaction from Jeriann, and\nit pleased him that it wasn't.\n\nTheir environment had changed. Life on the asteroid had undergone a\nnot so subtle transformation now that there were no longer any normals\naround to be compared with, to make the disastrous self-comparison to.\nThey could begin to behave healthily and sensibly. It was nice that\nJeriann had kissed him and liked it. It was the first installment of\nfreedom.\n\nThe second installment was going to be harder--to keep that freedom at\na level that meant something. He frowned heavily as he thought of what\nhad to be done.\n\nHe was late. Except for Anti, who was absent and always would be,\neveryone he knew was there. In addition there were many others who\nhardly ever attended. It was a good sign that they were coming out and\nmingling; before they had seldom left their houses. Docchi spotted\nJeriann but there wasn't a vacant seat near her. He sat down toward the\nrear.\n\nJordan rapped for silence. \"Are there any questions?\"\n\nAt the front a man stood up. Docchi remembered him from months ago, a\nJack or Jed Webber. Jed it was, a quiet fellow with pale blue eyes and\nalmost colorless blond hair. Docchi had never heard him say anything\nbut he was speaking now, emerging from his self-imposed shell. \"Yes,\"\nsaid Webber. \"I want to know where we're going.\"\n\nJordan rapped again. \"Out of order. Not on the subject. Anyway the\nquestion's not important.\"\n\n\"I think it is,\" said the man, shuffling his body awkwardly. He was\nnot exact in his movements because he'd been sliced very nearly down\nthe middle. Except for his head he was half man and half machine.\nUnlike others who'd been injured past regeneration, he could use his\ncomposite body with some degree of skill because there was one arm\nand one leg to which the motion of his mechanical limbs could be\ncoordinated. His skill wasn't as great as it could have been because he\nhadn't practiced. The spectre of the ideal human body had hindered him\ngreatly--in the past. \"You don't know where we're going,\" insisted the\nman in a high voice. \"We're just moving but you don't know where.\"\n\nDocchi got up. \"I can answer that question. It should be answered.\nWe're going to Centauri, either Alpha or Proxima, whichever is most\nsuitable. Is there some place else you wanted to go?\"\n\nThe reply was drowned for a few seconds by an appreciative rumble but\nWebber was stubborn and waited until the noise died down. He swayed on\nhis feet and pointed at Nona. \"I suppose you asked her,\" he said. Nona\nsmiled dreamily as attention turned to her.\n\n\"No. It would be a joke if we did and we're not interested in playing\ntricks on ourselves. You've forgotten one thing, that we do have a\ntelescope.\"\n\n\"A small one, built as a hobby,\" Webber said. His voice was uncertain,\nas wobbly as his body was.\n\n\"True, but it's better than Gallileo had.\" He hoped Webber wouldn't\npoint out that Gallileo hadn't tried to plot a voyage across space with\nhis instrument.\n\nActually there was something strange about the few observations he'd\nmade. He had reconstructed their path to the best of his ability--not a\nbad guess since no records had been kept. At the time they had left Sol\nthey hadn't been heading directly toward the Centauris. Nona must have\nused their tangential motion to take them out of the system as fast as\nshe could and later had looped back toward their present destination.\nThe sketchy charts Docchi had, indicated the Centauris by plus or minus\na few degrees, all the accuracy he could expect from the telescope. It\nwas in the stars themselves that he had detected changes he couldn't\naccount for.\n\nAt the far side a woman stood. Jordan nodded to her. \"I wasn't asked\nfor my opinion about all this,\" she said defiantly. \"I don't like it. I\nwant to go back.\"\n\nJordan cocked his head humorously. \"You should have told the guards\nthis while they were here. They'd have been glad to take you with them.\"\n\n\"I certainly wouldn't leave with them,\" she said in surprise. \"Look how\nthey acted while they were here.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're out of luck. We can't turn back because of you.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me we're marooned here,\" said the woman vehemently. \"The\nguards left a couple of scout ships, didn't they? Why can't we take\nthose back to Earth?\"\n\n\"For the same reason _they_ didn't,\" said Jordan patiently. \"The range\nof the scouts is limited, it wouldn't reach then and it won't do it\nnow.\"\n\n\"Pshaw,\" said the woman. \"You're just arguing. Docchi said the gravity\ngenerator in each ship could be changed to a drive without much\nwork--something about adding a little star encyclopedia unit. I think\nthat's what he said.\"\n\nDocchi started. Had he said that? He must have for the woman to have\nremembered it. He shouldn't have made such a statement, first because\nit wasn't so. He had made the possibility of return to Earth seem too\neasy.\n\nThere was another reason he regretted his rash explanation and it was\nthe opposite of the first: inadvertently he might have blurted out the\nsecret of the drive. It was possible to talk too much.\n\n\"I'm not the only one,\" the woman was insisting. She'd found a point\nand wouldn't let go. \"There are plenty of others who feel as I do and\nthey'll say so if they're not afraid. Who wants to go on for years and\nyears, never reaching any place?\"\n\n\"Look at the stars.\" A voice ahead of Docchi answered her. It was\nWebber again, the meek little man who never spoke.\n\n\"I don't _want_ to look at the stars,\" she said violently. \"I never\nwant to see anything but the sun. _Our_ sun. It was good enough for\nmankind and I certainly don't care to change it.\"\n\n\"That's because you don't know,\" said Webber confidently. \"You're\nafraid and you don't need to be. When I said look at the stars I meant\nthat those ahead of us are brighter than the ones behind. Do you know\nwhat that means?\"\n\nDocchi nodded exultantly to himself; they'd found their astronomer.\nHe himself had noticed the first part of what Webber remarked on; he\nhadn't thought to turn the telescope in the opposite direction because\nhe wasn't interested in where they'd been. The apparent brightness of\nthe Centauri system was much greater than it should have been--that's\nwhat he hadn't been able to account for. He could now. It was\nsurprising how much power the gravity drive could deliver.\n\n\"We're approaching the speed of light,\" went on Webber. \"It won't take\ndecades to reach a star. We'll be there in a few years.\"\n\nThe woman turned and glared at him but could find nothing to say.\nShe wasn't convinced but she sat down to cover her confusion. Around\nher people began to whisper to each other, their voices rising with\nexcitement. They'd lived long enough at the rim of the system to know\nwhat stellar distances meant and how much speed could affect their\nvoyage.\n\nJordan rapped them into silence. \"I've tried to get you to talk on the\nsubject but you've resolutely refrained. Therefore you'll have to vote\non it without discussion.\"\n\nThe vote took place, whatever it was. Docchi was unable to discover\nwhat and so he didn't participate. When the count was over Jordan\ngavelled sharply. \"Motion carried. That's all. Meeting adjourned.\"\n\nBefore Docchi could protest, people were leaving, carrying him part of\nthe way with them. He reached the wall and stood there until traffic\nsubsided, afterwards making his way to Jordan who was talking happily\nto Jeriann.\n\n\"We did it,\" said Jordan, grinning as he came up.\n\n\"Did what? All I heard were people complaining. We had to depend on\nsomeone from the floor to smack them down. Seems to me there were a lot\nof important things to discuss.\"\n\n\"Seem to me we covered everything, which you would have known if you\nhad got here on time,\" said Jordan, still grinning. \"This is Jeriann's\nidea. It was what we were voting on.\"\n\nTwisting his head Docchi read the sheet Jordan laid in front of him.\nIt was a resolution of some sort, that he gathered from the usual\nwhereases. He scanned it once and was halfway through again before he\ncaught the import.\n\n\"The wages aren't high,\" remarked Jordan. \"Survival _if_ we do our job\nwell, grousing if we don't. Otherwise we can keep on doing just what\nwe have been.\" He picked up the sheet and read from it. \"Whereas we\nare bound together by a common condition and destination--ain't that\nnice?--and have a common plan----\" Jordan looked up. \"Since you're the\none they're talking about when they refer to the head of the planning\ncommittee, just what the hell _is_ our plan?\"\n\nThere were innumerable small goals that had to be reached before they\ncould consider themselves self-sufficient, and to some extent Docchi\nwas capable of summarizing them. But when it came to a final statement\nof aims he could only feel his way. Docchi didn't know either.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nJeriann came into the office. \"I've got it down to twenty,\" she said\nbriskly.\n\n\"What?\" said Docchi absently. Management details were unfamiliar to\nhim and he was trying to pick them up as he went along. The scattered\nrecords were in order but some were still unaccounted for. \"Oh. The\ndeficiency biologicals. Good. How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I asked them.\"\n\n\"And they knew? It's surprising. I'd expect them to be familiar with\ntheir standard treatment. But not something that's entirely new.\"\n\nJeriann smiled faintly. \"I'm not that good. I did find out what\nthey used to get and then scrounged around in storage until I found\nsupplies. If the old stuff kept them healthy once it should do so now.\"\n\nHe hadn't thought of that, but then he wasn't accustomed to considering\nthe same things a doctor would. Any trained person would know that\nsulfa hadn't been discarded with the discovery of penicillin, nor\npenicillin with the advent of the neo-biotics. Docchi studied her\ncovertly; Jeriann was a competent woman, and an attractive one.\n\n\"Of the remaining twenty we don't have biologicals for, I've determined\nwe can make what eleven need.\"\n\nOnly nine who were left out. It was a remarkable advance over a few\ndays ago when there were forty-two. Nine for whom so far they could\ndo nothing. It was queer how he worried about them more as the number\ndiminished. Somehow it had greater significance now that he could\nremember each face distinctly. \"And Maureen?\" he inquired.\n\nInstinctively Jeriann touched the decorative belt that was so much more\nthan what it seemed. \"I'm afraid I misjudged her. I couldn't locate a\nthing for her.\"\n\n\"You're sure she didn't destroy her prescription?\"\n\n\"I don't see what difference it makes as long as we don't have it,\"\nsaid Jeriann. \"But yes, I'm sure. Once something is brought in it's\nsimply not possible for a person as ignorant of the system as she is to\ntrack down and destroy every entry relating to it.\"\n\n\"All right. I believe you.\" He glanced down at the list she'd given\nhim. The actual figures weren't as optimistic as her report had been.\n\"Wait. I notice you say here that out of twenty that we don't have\nsupplies for that we can synthesize biologicals for eleven.\"\n\nShe sat down. \"That's what I said. How else can we get them? We've got\nthe equipment. The asteroid never did depend on Earth for very many of\nour biologicals.\"\n\nHe knew vaguely how the medical equipment functioned, rather like the\ncommonplace food synthesizers. \"We don't have anyone with experience.\"\n\nJeriann shrugged. \"I'm not a technician but I used to help out when\nthere was nothing else to do. I expected to run it.\"\n\nThe light flashed on his desk but Docchi ignored it. \"Have you thought\nwhat an infinitesimal error means?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course.\" He was struck by her calmness. \"One atom hooked in the\nwrong place and instead of a substance the body must have it becomes a\ndeadly poison. I've talked it over with the deficients. They agreed to\nit. This way they know they have a chance.\"\n\n\"We'll do something,\" he acknowledged. \"Pick out the worst and work for\ntheir deficiency. Check with me before you give them anything.\"\n\n\"I've selected them,\" she said. \"There are four extreme cases. They\nwon't collapse today or tomorrow. Perhaps not in a week. But we can't\nlet them get close.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" The light kept flashing annoyingly in his eyes. Another\ncomplaint. Nodding at Jeriann Docchi nudged the switch and glanced at\nthe screen. \"Anything wrong?\" he asked.\n\nIt was Webber. \"Nothing much. Jordan and I just bumped into an old\nacquaintance. I suppose we'd better bring him in.\"\n\n\"Cameron,\" exclaimed Docchi as Webber moved aside, revealing the man\nbehind him.\n\nThe doctor's clothing was rumpled and he hadn't shaved but he was calm\nand assured. \"You seem to be running things now,\" he said. \"I'd like a\nchance to talk with you.\"\n\nDocchi didn't answer directly. \"Where did you find him, Webber?\"\n\n\"He was living out in the open near a stream which, I imagine, was\nhis water supply. We were checking some of the stuff the guards\ndidn't wreck when we spotted him. We saw bushes move and went over to\ninvestigate, figuring it might be a geepee at loose ends. There was our\nman.\"\n\n\"Did he give you any trouble?\"\n\nWebber shrugged. \"He wasn't exactly glad to see us. But he must have\nknown there was no place to hide because he didn't actually try to get\naway.\"\n\n\"That's your interpretation,\" said Cameron, his face beside Webber.\n\"The truth is I wanted to make sure you had no way of sending me back\nwith the general's forces. I was taking plenty of time.\"\n\nFrom beyond the screen Jordan snorted.\n\nCameron continued. \"There was no use going back to Earth. My career\nwasn't exactly ruined--but you can appreciate the difficulties I'd\nhave. Anyway a doctor is trained to take the most urgent cases, and I\nthought they were here. I'm sorry only that I had to be discovered. It\nspoiled the entry I was going to make.\"\n\nJeriann's face showed what she thought. Relief, and was there something\nelse? The thought was distasteful if only because it indicated there\nwas now a normal human present. The deadly comparison was back with\nthem.\n\nBut it was more than that--how much more was up to him to find out.\nDocchi kept his emotions far away. It would hardly do to let Cameron\nknow what he thought. \"Well, there's work to do, if that's what you\nwant. Come up as soon as you can get here.\"\n\nCameron cocked his head. \"If they'll let me.\"\n\n\"They'll let you.\" Docchi switched off the screen and turned to see\nJeriann getting up.\n\n\"Don't leave. I want you to check on him.\"\n\n\"Why should we check?\" she asked in surprise.\n\nAnother one who accepted the doctor at face value. There would be\nplenty of others like her. Perhaps Cameron _had_ remained for the\nreasons he'd given. If so it ought to be easy to prove. \"Did I say\nwe'd have to watch him? I didn't mean quite that. Cameron's here and\nwe intend to use him. At the same time we must admit that he has many\nconventional ideas. We'll have to give him our slant on what we need.\"\n\nShe sat down. \"I don't want to waste your time or his.\"\n\n\"You're not.\" Docchi pretended to be busy while they waited. He had to\nlearn whether his suspicions were unfounded. Cameron may have stayed\nin the best medical tradition. But there was another tradition less\nhonorable and it was an equal possibility.\n\nIt was better not to say anything to Jeriann. She respected the doctor\nbut she wouldn't be blinded by that attitude. She'd report any untoward\nthing she saw. And she was attractive. Sooner than anyone else save\nNona, who couldn't communicate, she'd learn what the doctor's true\nmotives were.\n\nDocchi found himself studying her. She didn't have to be that anxious.\nHe wished she weren't so eager for the doctor to arrive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCameron shook his head. \"Don't let your enthusiasm run away with you.\nI can help the deficients but if new treatments are developed it will\nprobably be the result of ideas you people have.\"\n\n\"What about the list? Can we synthesize for them?\"\n\n\"I haven't studied it and I'm not familiar with the medical history of\neveryone here. I do know three of the eleven that Jeriann's selected\nand in each one she's exactly right. It's merely a matter of testing\nthe preparations. I'll check but I'm sure she can do it as well as I\ncan.\"\n\nIt was nice to know that they were doing all right by themselves, that\nthey'd have gotten along without the doctor. It helped that he was here\nbut they'd have survived anyway. \"Can you do anything for Maureen?\"\nasked Docchi.\n\n\"I don't remember her. I'll have to look it up.\"\n\n\"The records aren't in the best condition.\"\n\n\"Guards?\" Docchi noted that Cameron scowled. Either he was a good\nactor or he was sincere. \"I tried to get the general to restrain them\nbut he wouldn't listen.\"\n\n\"No harm done, I suppose,\" said Docchi. He wanted to forget as much of\nthat episode as he could. \"However I can tell you what's wrong with\nMaureen. No male hormones.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" Cameron pondered. \"I've never had anything to do with\nher. Most of her treatment came direct from Earth. I don't know. I\nreally can't say.\"\n\n\"Most glands are paired. Can't you transplant one, or part of one, from\nsome of us? We'll get donors.\"\n\n\"Off hand I'd say that if it were possible it would have been done\nlong ago. For reasons that aren't understood transplants aren't always\neffective. Sometimes the body acts to dissolve foreign tissue or, if\nthere's irritation, grow a tumor around it.\"\n\n\"That's why she's still a deficient?\"\n\n\"It's my guess. They tried transplants but had to cut them out.\"\nCameron turned to Jeriann. \"Do we have equipment for synthetic\nhormones?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I never prepared any.\"\n\nThe doctor leaned over the desk, flipping through the files until\nhe came to the section he wanted. \"Some test animals. Probably not\nenough,\" he said after studying it briefly. \"I'll do something to keep\nher quiet until I can figure out a substitute.\"\n\n\"No experiments on us, Cameron.\"\n\nHe smiled wryly. \"The history of medicine is a long series of\nexperiments. If it weren't for that we'd still be in the stone age,\nmedically speaking.\"\n\nDocchi shrugged. \"Suit yourself. Do what you can with Maureen.\"\n\n\"What about Anti?\"\n\n\"We haven't had time to think about her.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do. If I stumble on anything that seems beneficial\nI'll let you know.\" Cameron turned to leave and Jeriann went with him.\n\nDocchi watched him go. The doctor was an asset they hadn't counted on.\nHis presence would help silence the objections of those who agreed with\nthe woman at the meeting but hadn't said anything yet. This was the\ntemporary advantage.\n\nBut there was still the doubt. Cameron might have stayed at the\ngeneral's request. A few serious illnesses or a death here and there\nmight influence them to turn back. Somehow Docchi couldn't credit the\ndoctor with such intentions.\n\nThen what? Well, the doctor might have remained with them on a long,\nlong chance. A gamble, but he was the kind who took risks.\n\nIt was not suspicion alone that made Docchi suddenly tired and morose.\nHe wished he could call Jeriann back on some pretext. She'd gone and\nshe hadn't looked his way when she left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnti bobbed gently in the acid. \"What's the contraption?\"\n\n\"An idea of mine,\" said Jordan, lowering the coils carefully so the\nacid didn't splash.\n\nAnti looked at it judicially. \"Maybe next time you'll think of\nsomething better.\"\n\n\"Don't be nasty,\" said Jordan as the coils reached the surface of the\nliquid and began to submerge. \"Cameron thinks it will work.\"\n\n\"My faith is shaken.\"\n\n\"It isn't a question of faith and anyway he's as good a doctor as we've\never had.\" Jordan kept lowering until the mechanism reached the bottom.\nA single cable over the side of the tank was the only thing visible.\nJordan wiped his hands on the grass. \"I was thinking about radiation\nwhen this thing occurred to me.\"\n\n\"Would you believe it? Once I was young and radiant myself.\"\n\n\"It's not the same thing.\"\n\n\"Don't think I wouldn't trade.\"\n\n\"You won't have to,\" said Jordan. \"This is my idea, not the doctor's.\nHe merely confirmed it.\"\n\n\"In that case it's bound to work.\"\n\nJordan pulled a tuft of grass loose and tossed it into the tank. It\ndisappeared in a soundless blaze. To conform with what was expected of\nher, Anti blinked. \"Don't be so afraid we're going to fail that you\ncan't listen to what I have to say. Do you want to be cured and not\nknow why? I've run my legs off to make this gadget.\"\n\n\"A figure of speech,\" commented Anti.\n\n\"A figure of speech,\" agreed Jordan. \"To begin with we discovered that\nwhen you were exposed to space the cold caused the fungus flesh to die\nback faster than it grew. Right?\"\n\n\"The fungus came from Venus,\" said Anti. \"It's only natural it wouldn't\ngrow well in the cold.\"\n\n\"The origin doesn't have anything to do with it. Normally it doesn't\ngrow in flesh and it had to make concessions to live in the human body,\nthe biggest one being adaptation to body temperature. At the same time\nthe body cells tried to outgrow it but the faster they grew the more\nthere was for the fungus to live in. A sort of an inimical symbiosis.\"\n\n\"If you can imagine inimical symbiosis,\" said Anti. \"I can't.\"\n\n\"You haven't tried very hard. Anyway, there seems to be a ratio between\nthe amount of fungus in one connected mass and the vigor. The more\nthere is the faster it grows, and conversely.\"\n\n\"Such a pleasant reference,\" said Anti. \"Mass. Still it's an accurate\ndescription of me, though I can think of a better one. Lump.\" She swam,\nsplashing ponderously toward the edge of the tank. \"Are you trying to\nsay that if I can ever get below a certain point my body will be able\nto keep the fungus in check?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with the treatment we discovered? Give me an oxygen\nhelmet and tie me to a cable and let me float outside the dome.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't float as long as the gravity's on. Besides, we can do\nit better. In space you lose heat solely by radiation. Radiation\ndepends on surface and the larger a body is the more surface it had in\nproportion.\"\n\n\"Convection is what you meant,\" said Anti. \"Acid alone helps, but a\n_cold_ acid would combine treatments.\"\n\n\"A very cold acid. Supercold.\"\n\nAnti nodded and nodded and then stopped. \"A fine piece of reasoning\nexcept for one thing. When the temperature is decreased chemical\nactivity slows down.\"\n\n\"That's the triumph of my gadget,\" said Jordan. \"It's not only a\nrefrigerant coil but electronically it steps up ionizations as the\ntemperature is lowered. We sacrifice neither effect.\"\n\nSoundlessly Anti sank below the surface and remained there for some\ntime. When she came up acid trickled over her face. \"I had to think.\nIt's been so long since I dared hope,\" she said. \"When can I walk?\"\n\n\"I didn't say you would,\" said Jordan hastily. \"There may be a lower\nlimit beyond which it's dangerous to continue the cold acid treatment.\"\n\n\"Then what's the use?\" said Anti. \"I'm not interested in merely\nreducing. I'll still be bigger than a house. I want to get around.\"\n\n\"This is the first step,\" explained Jordan patiently. \"After this is\nsuccessful we'll think of something else.\"\n\n\"What language,\" said Anti. \"The first step when obviously I'm nowhere\nnear taking one. Can't you turn off the gravity?\"\n\nIf they did it would hinder others, and the odds were nearly a thousand\nto one. Of course they might compromise, a short gravityless period at\nintervals. It would be unsatisfactory to everyone but it might give\nAnti the encouragement she needed.\n\nBesides, he was unsure they _could_ turn off the gravity without\nalso turning off the drive. Their momentum would carry them along at\nthe same speed they had been going--but was it wise to tamper with\na mechanism that till now was functioning so smoothly and was so\nimportant?\n\nJordan shook his head. \"I said we'd think of something else and we\nwill. Continue with this treatment and watch your weight go down.\"\n\n\"Don't think I'm not aware of your cheerful intentions,\" said Anti.\n\"How can you possibly weigh me as long as I have to stay in the tank?\"\n\n\"The same way Archimedes did--fluid displacement. I've rigged up a\nscale so you can keep track of what's happening.\" He didn't tell her\nwhat the scale was calibrated in. Absolute figures were disheartening.\nIt was only the progress which counted.\n\nAnti looked at the dial near the edge of the tank. \"I thought it was\njust another gadget.\" When Jordan didn't answer she looked for him.\n\"Hey, don't leave me to freeze in this cold goop.\"\n\n\"You're not cold and you know it. You can't feel a thing.\"\n\n\"Don't be so frank,\" she grumbled. \"Hardly anyone comes to talk to me.\nI like company.\"\n\n\"Sure, but I've got to get busy on that other idea.\" He didn't have one\nbut he looked very wise and it had the desired effect.\n\n\"Guess I can't stop you,\" grumbled Anti. \"Tell someone to come and\nvisit with me.\"\n\nAgain she looked long at the dial. It was a pleasant surprise to find\nshe was not so far from average that she could be weighed. Jordan was a\ngadgeteer but sometimes his contraptions worked and once in a while his\nventures in psychology were extraordinarily shrewd.\n\nFor instance, the dial.\n\nShe imagined she could feel her toes tingling from the cold--if she\nstill had toes. Soon they would emerge from the fungus flesh in which\nthey were buried. She felt she was shedding.\n\nWhat did they have that made anything seem possible? Jordan, the\nsometimes wonderful gadgeteer. Docchi, a competent engineer but no more\nthan that. Unsure of himself personally he had a passion for correcting\ninequalities. And then there was Cameron, a good doctor who was trying\nto realign his principles. He wouldn't have made it except that he had\na powerful attraction ahead of him. Lord knows what he saw in Nona or\nshe in him.\n\nAnd lastly there was Nona herself, to whom big miracles came easier\nthan small ones. There was a fragile grandeur about her but she knew\nnothing at all of the human body, especially her own.\n\nAnd this is what they relied on. It was strikingly little to balance\nagainst the forces of Earth, which had failed them. And yet it was\nenough; the accidentals would not fail.\n\nIt didn't matter what the resources were as long as they weren't aimed\nin the right direction. She didn't have figures on the conquest of\ncancer but the one-time scourge of mankind could have vanished far\nsooner if the cost of one insignificant political gesture had been\nspent instead to wipe out the disease.\n\nPerhaps this was one answer. They were struggling not to make beautiful\nmen and women still more beautiful but to restore those who were less\nthan perfect to some sort of usefulness, especially in their own\nevaluation.\n\nThe lights in the dome dimmed appreciably. It was the lengthening\nshadows which made the needle on the dial that Anti was watching quiver\nand seem to turn downward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJordan rode the repair robot away from the tank. It was more than\nhad ever been done for Anti but it wasn't enough. A fifty per cent\nreduction and she still wouldn't be able to walk. He'd have to check\nwith anyone who had ideas of what to do. He didn't have much hope\nthere; nobody but himself had given much thought to Anti recently.\n\nThe machine he was on wasn't functioning properly. Nothing definite,\nit just wasn't. He was sensitive enough to notice this through his\npreoccupation with other problems. It was sluggish to his touch. It\nwas not unexpected; there was a lot of equipment that was supposed to\nbe foolproof and wasn't, any number of machines built to last forever\nwhich didn't.\n\nOnce it would have been easy to blame technicians for failure to\nkeep the robots in proper condition. Now he couldn't because he was\nthat technician, the only one. Nona kept the big stuff working and\nDocchi helped out with anything else when he could find them. But\nminor machines were important too and this was his province. Robot\nrepair units affected gross corrections on themselves but weren't\ncapable of detecting defects in the basic repair circuit. This was his\nresponsibility.\n\nHe stopped the squat machine and opened it. There was nothing wrong\nthat he could see. Some other time he'd work it over thoroughly. He\nclimbed back on and touched the controls he added for his own use.\n\nFor a while nothing happened and then an extensible started flailing.\nIt was not what he'd signalled for. He shoved the lever in the opposite\ndirection and though it didn't stop the gyrations of the extensible it\ndid start the treads. The machine rumbled away at greater than ordinary\nspeed. Jordan would have fallen off if an extensible hadn't steadied\nhim.\n\nMomentarily he wondered; the last response was not within the machine's\ncapacity. It was built to repair other machines and, within limits,\nitself. It had no knowledge of the frailties of the human body. He\nwondered at this and then forgot it completely.\n\nThe robot lurched heavily, narrowly missing one of the columns that\nsupported the dome. A collision at this speed--well, no, the column\nwouldn't have been greatly damaged.\n\nHastily Jordan reached to shut it off. There was a shower of sparks and\nthe handle grew hot and sputtered. The grip flashed, fusing, visibly\nbecoming inoperative.\n\nThe robot no longer faltered. Jordan wasn't in immediate danger. He\ncould always swing off, slide off, or fall. But he ought to stop it\nbefore it wrecked itself or, worse, the dome.\n\nThe dome enclosed a good part of the asteroid but it came to an end\nsomewhere, curving downward and joining the ground at a flexible\nseal. Naturally it was protected against collision and naturally the\nprotection wasn't complete. It was conceivable that an uncontrolled\nrobot could break through. Jordan clutched an extensible as the machine\njolted and rocked. The nearest place it could damage the dome was miles\naway. He'd disable it long before it got there.\n\nHe steadied himself and reached for the panel, prying it open. He\nthrust his hand in and the lid slammed shut on his fingers. He yelled\nand pulled loose, leaving part of his skin inside. The lid was firmly\nclosed.\n\nHe glowered at the machine. It was an accident that a wildly moving\nextensible clamped the lid down as he reached inside. He didn't like\nthose kinds of accidents; the element of purpose was very strong.\n\nHe hesitated whether he should disable the machine. It was valuable\nequipment and they wouldn't get more like it. It would have to last for\nthe duration. \"Easy does it,\" he muttered but it wasn't easy. His hand\nslid back to the toaster--and it wasn't there. The sensible thing was\nto suppose that it had been jolted loose. The machine couldn't think in\ncomplex terms.\n\nOr could it? He glanced down; there were indications the robot had been\nsliced into and he thought he knew who had done it. It was probably\nthe one he and Docchi had disabled long ago on their escape from the\nasteroid. It had been repaired since and the technician who had done so\nhad altered the circuits.\n\nThe essential thing was to stop it before it caused real damage. He\nsuspected that, with a number of extensibles curled firmly around him,\nthere was no danger he'd fall off. Maybe he couldn't get off if he\nwanted to.\n\nHe wished he'd encounter someone. He hated to admit it but he needed\nhelp. In the distance he saw people and shouted. They knew him; he was\nthe person who rode the robot. They waved gaily and said something\nunintelligible as he sped by. It was irritating that they didn't see\nanything amiss.\n\nThe edge of the dome loomed up. They'd been going longer than he'd\nthought. He squirmed uneasily; he should have gotten off long ago and\nused something else to intercept the errant machine. A geepee, if he'd\nhad sense enough to get one, could run it down and smash it. His only\nexcuse was that he hadn't wanted to destroy valuable machinery.\n\nWith tremendous effort he tore himself loose and using the power of his\noverdeveloped arms he threw himself off. He covered his head and rolled\nalong the ground in a tight ball. He was free.\n\nBut not for long. The treads whining in reverse, the robot whirled,\nscooping him up as it passed by. This time it didn't pause as it headed\ntoward the edge of the dome. It was all his fault. The dome would\nseal itself after the robot plunged through, but not without loss of\nair--and one good mechanic.\n\nThe machine churned on but surprisingly didn't plow heedlessly into the\ncurved transparent wall. The extensibles felt the surface, the speed\nwas checked and the direction changed. The robot moved parallel with\nthe edge of the dome. It had a better sense of self-preservation than\nwas common with robots of this type.\n\nIt felt the wall as it rolled along. There was nothing noteworthy about\nthe surface, smooth, hard, and slightly curved. Another extensible\nemerged from the squat body; the tip flashed a light toward the outside.\n\nIt was strange out there. Jordan hadn't often seen it; not many people\ncame to look out. When the asteroid was in the solar system jagged\nrocks had gleamed in the sharp light of the sun. But now the landscape\nwas always dark except when some curious person wanted to remind\nhimself what the rest of his world was like. It was a torn and crumpled\nsight the robot's light displayed, as if some giant had risen and\ntossed aside the rocks he slept in. But not completely rumpled; here\nand there were smooth areas that some vast engine might have planed\nflat--or the same giant had straightened out with a swipe of his hand\nbefore departing.\n\nThe robot flicked off the light and turned away. Jordan breathed with\nrelief when he saw where it was going, toward the central repair depot\nto which all robots returned periodically. It would slide into a stall\nand stop. He would get off. And he would see to it that the robot was\nthoroughly checked over before it was called out again.\n\nThe entrance slot was extremely wide and equally low; it wasn't built\nfor passengers on the robots. Momentarily the thought flashed across\nhis mind that he should let himself be scraped off. But it seemed a\nprecipitous way to dismount and anyway the machine would soon stop and\nhe could get off more conventionally. Instinct won and Jordan flattened\nhimself as they swept under the gate. He could feel the masonry\ntwitching at his clothing.\n\nThe slot opened into a circular space in which other robots were\nstationed in stalls. In the center were bins of spare parts. Jordan\ncalled out, not too hopefully. Robots were assigned from here on a\nbroadcast band; he didn't think there were facilities for responding to\nthe human voice.\n\nHis machine headed toward a stall at the rear. This far from the\nentrance the light was dim. Jordan wondered why there was any light\nat all; robots didn't need it. Upon reflection he decided it was a\nconcession to human limitations.\n\nBut the machine didn't slow down as he expected. It rumbled between\nwalls, turned at a sharp angle--and the parking slot was not what it\nhad seemed. They were in a passageway, narrow and even more dimly\nlighted. That it was lighted at all indicated it wasn't a chance\nfissure. It had been built long ago and forgotten.\n\nThis was serious. Where was the machine going and when would it stop?\nHe hoped it _would_ stop. An outcropping in the passageway loomed ahead\nof him; he flung himself flat. A sharp projection grazed his ear. The\ntunnel wound on through solid rock. He was lost by the time it ended.\n\nThere were no true directions on the asteroid. Toward the sun or\naway from it; toward the hospital or the rocket dome. These were the\nprinciple orientations and the main one had been left behind--the sun.\nHe didn't know where he was except that it was somewhere under the main\ndome. He was sure of this because he was still alive. There was air.\n\nThe passageway terminated in a large cavern. Once he saw it he relaxed.\nIt was a laboratory and a workshop and he knew whose. There was only\none person who would disassemble nine general purpose robots and\narrange their headpieces in a neat row on a stone slab. Their eyes\nrevolved slowly as the machine rumbled farther in. He stared back; the\nintensity with which they gazed at him was uncomfortable. How long Nona\nhad had this workshop he didn't know. Perhaps it was here she'd hidden\nfrom the guards.\n\nNine pair of eyes followed their progress as the machine rolled across\nthe floor. Jordan glared back. He could see that they were not merely\nin a row, that they were hooked together by a complex circuitry that\nwove an indefinable pattern between them. The purpose was obscure.\n\nA repair robot was an idiot outside the one thing it was built to\ndo. A general purpose robot, the geepee, was a higher type. It was a\nmoron. Were nine morons brighter than one? With men, not necessarily;\nstupidity was often merely compounded. But with mechanical brains,\nusing modules of computation, the combination might constitute an\naccurate data evaluating system.\n\nJordan squirmed to get a better glimpse of the heads on the slab--and\nfell off the machine that held him captive. He was free.\n\nHis first impulse was to scurry away. When he remembered how far he had\nto go and by what labyrinth route he decided to wait. Something better\nmight come up. He raised himself and rubbed fine gravel off his cheek.\nDust irritated his nose; he sneezed. Eighteen eyes glowered at him.\n\nThe repair robot ignored him. Having brought him so far and clung\npossessively, now it refused to notice him. On the bench there was\nsomething new to interest it. The unshakable directive around which it\nwas built had taken over: there was a machine which should be fixed.\n\nWhat? A mechanism of some sort. Not the nine heads. The repair robot\nraised a visual stalk and scanned. Jordan craned but couldn't see to\nthe top of the stone bench. Extending other stalks the robot began\nworking up high on the unknown something.\n\nHis own curiosity was aroused. Jordan swung to the bench and, gripping\nthe edge, hoisted himself up. Parts of disassembled geepees and other\nelectronic devices were scattered over the slab. He inched carefully\nalong until he could see what his robot, microsenses clicking\nfuriously, was busy with.\n\nIt was disappointing. He had expected to find a complicated machine\nand instead it was nothing at all--a strand of woven wire with a\nrectangular metal piece at one end. A belt with a buckle on it. This\nwas what fascinated the repair robot.\n\nJordan went closer. The robot hummed and shook, extensibles racing\nthrough the scattered parts which it sorted and laid aside for other\nstalks to add to the end of the slender strand. It worked on, from time\nto time stopping to buzz inquisitively. When nothing happened after\nthese outbursts it resumed activity. The pattern was clear: the belt\nwas not functioning properly and the robot was busy repairing it.\n\nGradually it slowed and the pauses became longer. It clattered loudly\nand sputtered, extensibles waving uncontrollably until they seemed to\nfreeze. The directive completely frustrated, the robot whined once and\nthen was silent. It was motionless.\n\nJordan reached for the object, ready to swing away if there was any\nobjection. There wasn't. He examined it closely; it was _not_ a belt.\nAnd the rectangular metal piece was not a buckle though it could serve\nas one. Actually it was a mechanism of some kind, though what it was\nsupposed to do he couldn't tell.\n\nIt was one of Nona's experiments. Of that there was little doubt. The\nstrands were not wires but microparts fastened together and woven into\nan intricate pattern. Jordan snorted; the robot hadn't improved on what\nNona had wrought.\n\nHe inspected it thoroughly. He could see where the robot had begun to\nadd parts. Methodically he unhooked the surplus components. If Nona had\nthought they should be on there she would have attached them. They\ndidn't belong.\n\nWhen he was down to the original mechanism he looked at it perplexedly.\nIt was designed to be worn as a belt. He fastened it around his waist\nand touched the stud.\n\nBy now he had some idea of what it was intended for. It was not\nsurprising that it worked perfectly.\n\nHe expected that it would. Nona seldom failed. What Jordan didn't\nnotice and would never discover--no one would--was that there were\nthree minute parts that the robot had added, almost too small for the\nhuman eye to see. And those three parts were indispensable. Without\nthem the belt would not function at all. For the lack of them Nona had\ndiscarded the idea as unworkable.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nJed Webber came in noisily. His left foot was heavy and his left arm\nswung more than it should. Otherwise there wasn't much that remained of\nthe timid awkward man of weeks ago.\n\nDocchi looked up. \"Did my calculations check?\"\n\nWebber grinned. \"I thought they would but I wanted to be sure. It's one\nof the Centauris.\"\n\n\"Is that as close as you can come?\"\n\n\"With that telescope it is. It's pretty wobbly. Who made it, anyway?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\nWebber grinned again. \"In that case it's pretty damned good.\" With\ndifficulty Webber kept himself from looking down but Docchi could see\nthat his real foot was wriggling.\n\n\"Thanks. Did you get an estimate of the speed?\"\n\nWebber grunted. \"Not a spectroscope on the place and without one how\ncan I measure the light shift?\" He rubbed his arm slowly. \"Unless you\nmade one of those too and have it stored away.\"\n\n\"I don't. I made the telescope when I first came here. I didn't see\nthat it proved anything even to myself so I stopped.\" Docchi thought\nbriefly. \"There's an analyzer in the medical lab. You can borrow it\nbut don't change it in any way. We can't risk ruining the only means we\nhave of checking our synthetics.\"\n\n\"We don't have to know how fast we're going. We'll get there just as\nsoon. I'll look into that analyzer after my work period. There's a\nchance it will do what I want it to.\"\n\n\"What you're doing is work. You don't have to put in more hours than\nanyone else.\"\n\nWebber smiled unhappily. \"Oh--I'm as lazy as the next person. We're\nshort handed in hard labor. I thought I'd fill in for a while.\"\n\nThe reference was what he'd expect from Webber, not at all subtle. \"You\nmean that there's criticism over the shortage of geepees?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to say anything--but yes, there is.\"\n\n\"I've heard the same complaint. You're not revealing something I don't\nknow.\" Docchi leaned back. \"To you it seems like ingratitude and I\nsuppose it is. More than anyone else Nona is responsible for what we've\nachieved. I don't object to anything she wants--twice as many geepees\nif she needs them and we have them. We'll get it back in ways we didn't\nexpect.\"\n\n\"I agree. But not everyone feels the same way.\"\n\n\"It doesn't hurt. In times of hardship everyone complains, and they may\nas well direct it at her. Actually it's a measure of how important they\nfeel she is--and the accusations are so ill-founded they can't believe\nthem themselves.\"\n\nWebber got up. For the first time since he entered the mechanical and\nmuscular halves of his body failed to coordinate. \"You're right. I\nthought if I had something to tell them they'd be less uncertain.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they would, for a while. I'm not keeping secrets. The truth is\nI don't know what she's using the geepees for.\"\n\nIf the explanation failed to be completely convincing it was because\nWebber didn't want to believe. There were others like him. He didn't\nblame anyone for wanting an accounting for every piece of equipment\non the asteroid. And yet the attitude was an advantage. Discontent,\nreal or fancied, wouldn't become a problem as long as it was openly\ndisplayed. There would be time to worry if Webber didn't mention his\ndissatisfaction. Docchi watched him leave and then bent over his work.\n\nA few hours and a score of unimportant details later Cameron hurried\nin. \"Need a couple of lab workers,\" he said on entering.\n\n\"I thought Jeriann was doing all right.\"\n\n\"She is--indispensable. We can't have that. Suppose she should get\nsick? I want her to teach someone else the synthesizers. She's got too\nmuch on her hands.\"\n\nDocchi hooked his knee on a corner of the desk and tilted the chair\nback. \"Sounds reasonable. Do you have anyone in mind?\"\n\n\"Jeriann says two women have worked with her in the past. She won't\nhave to start from scratch. She'll give you their names.\" Cameron\nrifled the files and jotted down the information. He folded the sheet,\nstuffing it in his pocket. \"Here's something for you. We've reduced the\nunsolved deficients to three. All the rest we can synthesize for.\"\n\nFrom forty-two to nine and now it was three. It was all the progress\nthey could hope for, and much of it was due to Cameron. He had\nmisjudged the doctor's reasons for staying and he was thankful he could\nadmit it to himself. The man was sincere--and he was also very fond of\nNona.\n\nCoupled with an increased food supply the major hazards were vanishing.\nPower, of course, never had been a problem and never would be. There\nwas only one small doubt that remained and though there was no basis\nfor it he couldn't get it out of his mind. He wished there was some way\nto reassure himself.\n\n\"We weren't able to replace everything the deficients need,\" Cameron\nwas saying. \"However they'll get along on what we manufacture.\"\n\n\"Then they're still deficients?\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Cameron. \"The body's more versatile than you think. Long\nago it was learned that certain vitamins can be created in the body\nfrom simpler substances.\n\n\"In several cases we're depending on an analogous process. We supply\nsimple compounds and depend on the body to put it together. Afterwards,\nwhen we checked, the body did create the new substance.\"\n\n\"Good. When will you take the remaining three off the emergency list?\"\n\n\"Two are minor. It doesn't matter when we get to them as long as it's\nwithin the next few years.\"\n\nHe didn't have to be told who the third was. Maureen. He'd all but\nforgotten her. It was the doctor's responsibility, but he didn't feel\nthat way.\n\n\"She's not causing trouble,\" emphasized Cameron. \"Daily she is growing\nmore feminine and we'd have positive proof of it except that we've\ntaken steps.\"\n\n\"Confinement?\"\n\n\"No, except the solitude of her mind. Hypnotics. We tell her she's\ngetting the regular injections and it's these which cause her to want\nto be left alone.\"\n\nIt was more stringent than he cared for but he didn't have a better\nsuggestion. \"How long can she continue on hypnotics?\"\n\n\"Depends. The reaction varies with the person. She can tolerate quite a\nbit more.\"\n\nDocchi's face darkened. \"You said you can't transfer tissue from any of\nus. Is that also true of hormones concentrated from blood donations?\"\n\n\"Let's put it this way: blood won't help Maureen at all. We can't\nextract the complete hormone spectrum from blood--the basic factors she\nmust have to utilize the rest just don't exist there. If I thought it\nwould help I'd have asked for donations long ago.\"\n\nDocchi tried to shut out the pictures that were coming fast. Maureen\nalone in a room in which she had darkened the windows so she wouldn't\nlook outside. The door would swing open at the touch of her hand,\nbut she would never touch it. The lock was intangible and hence\nunbreakable. It would break when her mind broke.\n\n\"That's all you've planned,\" said Docchi, \"wait and see what happens?\"\n\n\"Hardly. I'm having Jeriann work solely on synthesizing those hormone\nfractions we can't extract from blood. If she gets even a few we'll\ncall for blood and between the two sources we'll have Maureen out of\ntrouble.\"\n\nDocchi refrained from asking what chance of success Jeriann had.\nIt might be better not to know. Before he could question the doctor\nfurther Jordan wandered in, buoyant and cheerful. Tacitly they let the\nsubject of Maureen drop.\n\n\"Where have you been the last few days?\" said Cameron. \"I've been\nwanting you to fix some of my equipment.\"\n\n\"I've been busy tearing down a robot.\"\n\n\"That's important but the hospital comes first,\" said Docchi.\n\n\"Not before this one,\" said Jordan. \"It was erratic and I had to get\nout those faulty circuits before it decided to look into a nuclear\npile. If I'd let it go there might be no robot, power plant or\nasteroid. Not to mention a hospital.\"\n\n\"You're exaggerating.\"\n\n\"No I'm not. You should have seen it. It had more curiosity than--well,\nAnti.\"\n\n\"Or you?\" suggested Docchi, smiling faintly at the man's good nature.\n\"Get to the doctor's equipment when you can.\"\n\n\"I'm not in a real hurry,\" said Cameron. \"By the way, I saw Anti\nyesterday. She's coming along nicely with your treatment, looking\nalmost human.\"\n\n\"She always did seem human to me,\" said Jordan.\n\n\"Sorry. No offense.\"\n\n\"Sure, I know. It was a compliment.\" The tension left Jordan again; he\nwas relaxed and easy. \"Anyway, you should see her today. Better yet. I\ndon't have to rig the scale in her favor. I can let her read the honest\nfigures.\"\n\n\"Good. But don't overdo the encouragement. It will make it harder when\nshe finds she won't be walking for years.\"\n\n\"She'll be up long before you think,\" said Jordan mildly but the\ndoctor chuckled at the wrong time and the mildness vanished. Jordan\nhad come to tell them but now he couldn't. Cameron thought he was good\nand so he was but he forgot he wasn't dealing with ordinary people.\nHis rules just didn't apply to Anti, nor to Nona, Jordan, or even the\nspectacularly useless robot. The doctor didn't understand and because\nof that he'd have to wait, Docchi too.\n\n\"I discovered where Nona does most of her work these days,\" Jordan\nmuttered. He described where it was, omitting the details of how he got\nthere. He was also careful not to mention anything he saw.\n\nCameron looked out the window as Jordan talked. \"Glad you told me,\" he\nsaid. \"I've been meaning to see what I could do for her. It might help\nif I watched her working.\"\n\n\"Very ordinary,\" said Jordan. \"She putters around--but things fall\ntogether when she touches them.\"\n\n\"I imagine. I've seen great surgeons operate.\" Cameron gathered up his\nnotes and left.\n\nJordan lingered for a while trying to make up his mind whether to tell\nDocchi what he had refrained from discussing while the doctor was\npresent. He wanted to, but the longer he kept it to himself the harder\nit was to share. Eventually Docchi tired of chatting and bent over his\nwork and Jordan wandered out, his secret still safe, too safe.\n\nDocchi stopped foggily when he was alone again. Cameron would soon be\ntrying to help Nona. Somebody had to and he, Docchi, couldn't. It was\nenough to settle all the prosaic details that must be attended to if\nthe place were to function properly.\n\nIt was a relief to know that he no longer be concerned about her.\nNevertheless a certain grayness descended that didn't lift until\nJeriann came in to check on a patient's file.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nIn the beginning there was silence and it never changed. No sound came\nto break the stillness. Darkness changed to light with regularity or\nnot, but in the particular universe in which she lived there was never\nany noise nor any conversation, and music was unknown. She didn't miss\nit.\n\nThere were also machines in the universe in which she dwelt and these\ntoo observed a dichotomy. Some machines were warm and soft and this\ndistinguished them from those which were hard and cool. The warm ones\nstarted themselves when they were very small. Later they grew up but\nthey didn't know how they did it. Neither did she. Once she was little\nand she didn't remember doing anything to change it, but it did change.\n\nThe hard machines she knew more about. They didn't always have picture\nreceptors on top. Some were blind and some saw more than she did,\nthough not quite in the same way. She could never tell by looking at\nthem which was apt to do which.\n\n(There was a stupid little running machine that she had discovered\nonce that was perpetually scurrying about looking for things to do. It\nwould never have survived on Earth because there was an unexpected flaw\nin it. She herself had sensed the fault and started to fix it only to\nrealize that here was an unexpected stroke of luck. Curiosity circuits\nthere were by the million but they were all mechanical and what they\nproduced could be strictly predicted. But this was unique. A deviation\nin the manufacturing process, a slight change in the density of the\nmaterial, whatever it was something extraordinarily fine had been put\ntogether and it would take a hundred years of chance to duplicate it.)\n\n(Midway she had changed her mind and instead had altered the machine to\nencourage the basic sensitivity. She hadn't seen it recently. She hoped\nsomeone who didn't understand hadn't undone her work.)\n\nThe known order crumbled under the touch into something that was\nstrange. But where sight itself would not suffice, it was possible\nto touch reality, to soak it into the skin, like understanding which\ncometh slowly to the growing mind. But what was understanding? Parts of\nit were always left out and she could venture toward it only a little\nway.\n\nShe twisted the head on the bench. The silence was unchanging. (What\nwas silence?) Other heads on the bench didn't move; they weren't\nsupposed to. Once they had been attached to clumsy machines and could\nmove about with a stiff degree of freedom. They couldn't now, though\nthey could twist the light perceptors in whichever direction suited\nthem.\n\nBut they didn't know where to look.\n\nShe herself couldn't see the thing that was approaching. It was because\nher eyes were imperfect. Lenses were pliable and nerve endings were\nhuge things, too gross to catch the instant infinitesimal signals. Or\nperhaps it was permeability--force bounced on distant impenetrability\nand bounded back to and through her senses.\n\nShe'd have to align the heads to help them help her, string them\ntogether for what reinforcement they offered each other. And still they\nwouldn't see because what they depended on for seeing was too slow. By\nitself the hookup wouldn't correct their sight.\n\nBut nearby was a fast mind though a lazy one. It liked routine once\nthe meaning of it was made clear. And it worked with instantaneity.\nBlind itself it could fingertip touch the incredible impulses and\ninterpret what it felt for those who had eyes. It would join with her,\nreluctantly but surely if she made it interesting, a game at which it\ncould always win. And winning wouldn't be difficult for it, not against\nthese nine circuit bound minds, even if it was true that they did\naugment one another. Singly there were stupid and even added they were\nnot much better. Their virtue was that they were electronic.\n\n(Alone) Were there intangible machines? Sometimes she thought there\nmight be. People twisted their mouth and (not because they were\nsmiling) to indicate that they too understood. She could touch the air\ncoming out but the impulses had no meaning. It was not like vibrations\nmachines set up, harmonics that told of the unseen structure. There was\nnothing mechanical that could be concealed from harmonics--there were\nno hard and fast secrets. But what came out of mouths was senseless.\nIt told nothing, or if it did have meaning her hands and her skin were\nunable to relay the interpretation further. (People were soft machines\nand they did not ring true. It was difficult to understand.)\n\nHer hands were usually quite capable. (Now) she wove wires so fine\nthat only occasional light was caught and brilliantly reflected. Each\nstrand led somewhere. She removed panels from the robots' heads and\ngrouped them closer. They were beginning to shake off their incomplete\nindividuality. They were no longer separate mechanisms, each of which\ncould only grope for a small fragment of reality. They were merging,\nbecoming larger and stronger. There was more to be done to them but she\ncouldn't do it.\n\nAs light as her touch was it was too inaccurate for what must follow.\nThere were objects smaller than her eye could see, movements finer\nthan her muscles could control. She summoned a repair machine whose\nmicrosenses were adequate to begin with. She would like to have the\none she repaired some time ago (actually it was quite smart) but it\nhad disappeared and she didn't know where to find it. However this one\nwould do.\n\nIt was set merely to repair what was already built, but what she wanted\nwas not yet made. She changed the instructions; they were not to her\nliking anyway.\n\nShe delved into the machine and set the problem. The statement of it\nwas complex and she wasn't sure how much data the robot aide would\nneed. When she finished it stood there thrumming. It didn't move.\n\nShe waited but nothing happened. The robot, whose senses were far finer\nthan her own, remained frozen and baffled. Impatiently she restated the\nproblem, rephrased it so that it could reach every part of the circuit\nalmost instantly. Where it was complex she simplified, reducing it at\nlast to an order the robot could act on. It began to work, slowly at\nfirst.\n\nIt copied exactly a circuit she had made previously. After she approved\nit started another, like the first but much smaller, attaching it in\nseries. Satisfied it was obeying instructions, she left it. It would\ncontinue to make those circuits, each one progressively smaller, the\nfinal one delicate enough to contact the gravity computer.\n\nMeanwhile there was her own work. It wouldn't suffice that the geepees\nbe linked with the gravity computer. They would then see what she had\ndiscovered long ago--but it was people who had to be shown. Their eyes\nwere even less sensitive than hers.\n\nFortunately this was the easiest part. She went to the screen and began\nto alter it. It could be made to scan what the gravity computer passed\non to the geepee heads. A row of dominos, each of which would topple if\nthe first were struck, and the screen was the last of the series.\n\n\"Hello,\" said a voice. \"So this is where you always are. What a dreary\nplace to work.\"\n\nShe didn't hear the voice. She felt the footsteps and the air brushing\nagainst her skin. She turned around, letting her hands continue, deft\nand sure. She didn't need to see what she was doing. The smile was\ninvoluntary.\n\nHe leaned against the wall, watching her. It was embarrassing the way\nshe gazed back. He wished she could say something but then he'd always\nwished it. He'd had a thesis once, hadn't he? that for mechanics\ndeafness wasn't a handicap considering how noisy machines were. A deaf\nperson could withstand a concentration of sound the average man would\nfind intolerable. And there was no need for such a person to talk since\nthere was no one who could hear.\n\nThe connections in her hands grew swiftly. She felt that she could work\nbetter while he was near. Why was this?\n\n\"What do you respond to?\" he said gruffly. \"Diagrams, blue-prints?\nIf so I'll have to learn to draw the damnedest things.\" He laughed\nuncertainly. \"Come on, help me a little bit. I've got some ideas that\nmight help you break out of your shell if you'd try to respond.\"\n\nHe fixed things too, warm soft mechanisms. She didn't know but she\nthought it was a higher skill than hers. He was not as adept as she\nwas, though he could learn to be. There was so much more he could do if\nhe would realize. His mouth was a handicap. He moved it often when he\nshould be thinking.\n\n\"Listen, robot face, I left a career for you. Do you think they\nwouldn't take me back? The Medicouncil wouldn't like it but I'd have\nbeen a popular hero. Sometimes they want their heroes to fail. Besides\nfrom their viewpoint it was the best possible solution. Now they don't\nhave to think of people like you out on that god-forsaken asteroid.\nYou're off their conscience and they don't have to have bad dreams\nabout you.\"\n\nShe smiled again and it was infuriating. What he said or did had no\neffect. \"At least show that you recognize me. Stop what you're doing.\nIt can't be important.\"\n\nHe drew her to him roughly and the work fell from her hands. The\nconnections had been done minutes before and she'd continued to hold\nthem because she didn't want to move away from him. She was willing to\nlet him look at her closely if he wanted. It was surprising how much he\nwanted to.\n\nLater he held her away from him. \"I take it back,\" he said softly.\n\"You're not a robot face. There's no point of resemblance to a machine.\nAnd look, you've even discovered that you've got more than one\nexpression.\"\n\nThe robot aide that had been laboring on whirred inaudibly and clacked\nits extensibles. It rolled away from the work bench, brushing lightly\nagainst the doctor as it did so.\n\nCameron glanced down blankly, not actually seeing it. \"What do I do\nnow?\" he said with unexpected gloominess. \"You're a child. You're\nas old as Jeriann, maybe as old as I am, but in this you're hardly\nmore than a child.\" What was consent and how would he know when he\nhad it? Well, no, that was not the problem--he knew, but would she?\nWhat _could_ he explain to her? He put his arms around her and gazed\nthoughtfully over her head at the odds and ends of machinery she\nhad been stringing together. The screen flickered and sprang into\nillumination.\n\nHe glared at it for interrupting his thoughts. It seemed to him he had\njust discovered something very significant and if he'd had a few more\nminutes he'd have been able to say it in a way he'd never forget. But\nthere was a shape on the screen and he couldn't ignore it. The image\nwavered in and out of focus, growing clearer as the machine learned to\nhold it steady.\n\nIt was a ship.\n\nA ship. He dropped his hands. \"Don't give up on me. I'm not going to\nrun out on you.\" Was it his imagination that the ship was growing\nlarger? His throat was dry and tight. The last thing he wanted to see\nwas a ship.\n\n\"I don't know what we can do about this, Nona, but come on. We'll see.\"\n\nShe leaned against the wall, showing no inclination to follow. She\nseemed to be disturbed but he would guess it was not about the same\nthing he was. \"Come on,\" he said. \"We've got to tell the others.\"\n\nAnd still she didn't move. \"I can't stay here,\" he muttered and kissed\nher. He started walking away fast so he'd be able to leave.\n\nShe could tell that he was upset by the unexpected appearance of the\nship on the scanner. Perhaps he thought they were alone in space, that\nemptiness was lonely. He ought to have known better. She had seen it\nlong ago, and guessed what it meant. It would have to be overcome.\n\nWhat she couldn't understand was what happened to her when he touched\nher. Others had tried to come close and either she minded or was\nindifferent and they went away. But this was surely outside of her\nexperience. She thought it meant something to touch a machine and to\nknow therefrom what it was. But to come in contact with him and to\nlearn all at once what he was--yes and herself too.... The warm soft\nmechanism that she was behaved strangely--never the same way twice.\n\nAnd now she was becoming confused--because she would always feel this\nwhen he was near--and she didn't mind.\n\nShe closed her eyes and could see him more clearly. (What was choice?)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDocchi walked on, carefully skirting one of the columns that supported\nthe dome. Once it had seemed huge and unshakable and now it was\nremarkably slender. The dome itself was hardly adequate to keep the\ndarkness overhead from descending. This was the dull side of their\nrotation; they were looking back at the way they'd come. The stars were\ngray and faint. \"Where did you see it?\" he asked after a long silence.\n\n\"In the place Jordan described. It's deep underground but I believe\nit's near one of the piles. I felt the wall and it was warm.\"\n\n\"Somewhere below the gravity computer,\" said Docchi. \"Why there, I\ndon't know, but Nona may have had a reason. What I want to know is: how\ndo you account for the ship?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Cameron. \"Oh, I leave that to you and Jordan. I can't\nexplain it.\"\n\nDocchi guessed why the doctor was less concerned than he tried to be.\nLet him live with his exaltation for a while. It might not last. \"Part\nof it's easy, how the ship came to be there.\"\n\n\"It isn't to me,\" said Cameron. \"We haven't been gone long, not much\nmore than a month.\"\n\n\"Six weeks to be exact. Six weeks on our calendar.\"\n\n\"I see, relative time. I heard we were approaching the speed of light\nbut I didn't think we were close enough to make any difference.\" He\nglanced at his watch as if it held secrets he couldn't fathom. \"How\nlong have we actually been gone, Earth time?\"\n\n\"I don't know. We haven't any figures on our acceleration rate nor our\npresent speed.\"\n\n\"What are you planning to do? We can't just sit here and let them\novertake us.\"\n\n\"I don't know. We're not helpless.\" Docchi's plans were vague. There\nwas much that had to be determined before he could decide on anything.\n\"You're certain it's one of ours? It's not an alien ship?\"\n\nThe idea hadn't occurred to Cameron. He turned the image around in his\nmind before he answered. \"I'm not familiar with ship classifications,\nbut it's ours unless these aliens use the English language. There was a\nname on it. I could read part. It ended in -_tory_.\"\n\n\"The Victory class,\" said Docchi. \"The biggest thing built. At one time\nit was intended for interstellar service, before the gravity drive\nfizzled.\"\n\n\"That's how they were able to do it,\" said Cameron. \"I've been\nwondering how they were able to send a ship after us so soon, even\nallowing for the fact that we've been gone longer than it seems to us,\nmaybe two or three months instead of six weeks.\"\n\nHe had nothing definite to go on but in Docchi's opinion the time was\ncloser to half a year. \"Right. Since the ships were already there\nrusting in the spaceport all they had to do was clean them up and add\nan information unit to the drive. They may have started work on it\nwhile we were in the solar system, when they were still looking for\nNona.\"\n\nThe special irony was that our own discoveries were being used\nagainst them. Nona's first, the resurrected drive, and then his\nown not negligible contribution. Docchi himself had told them. His\nthoughtless remark that the drive would function without Nona had been\nrelayed back to Earth. Vogel the engineer had probably picked it up\nand sent the information on. Someone would have chanced on the idea\nanyway, but he had given them weeks. And a week was of incalculable\nimportance--planets could be won or lost.\n\nCameron was silent as they walked on. \"There's a ship but we don't know\nwhere. Let's not worry until we find where it's going.\"\n\nDocchi didn't answer. That the scanner Nona had built was capable of\ndetecting a ship between the stars indicated a tremendous range--old\nstyle. But distances had shrunk lately. There was a ship behind them\nand it wasn't far. Neither was it on a pleasure jaunt.\n\nAt the hospital steps they conferred briefly and then separated,\nCameron leaving to find Jeriann. Docchi went into his office and tried\nunsuccessfully to locate Jordan.\n\nUltimately he gave it up. Jordan had his own ideas of what was\nimportant and lately had been mysteriously concerned with some\nundertaking he refused to disclose. He had even tried to conceal that\nthere was something he was working on. Docchi switched his efforts and\nfinally contacted Webber. At a time like this they needed what support\nthey could get. Webber was not a substitute for Jordan but he'd do. The\nperson he'd most have liked to have along was Anti but she couldn't\nleave the prison, her tank. They missed her. They always would as long\nas she was confined.\n\nDocchi sat down while he waited for Webber. He needed the rest. He had\nbeen hoping that the pursuit would not begin as soon as it had. They\nwould find some way to throw off the ship behind them--but it was not\nthe biggest threat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you suppose she hid here when the guards were looking for her?\"\nsaid Webber.\n\n\"Doesn't seem likely,\" said Docchi, trying to keep up. The other's\ncomposite body gave him strength he wasn't aware of. Docchi couldn't\nmatch the effortless stride, the endurance. \"Guards searched here too.\"\n\nThey had, but how thoroughly? The asteroid had once been a planet, a\nworld with an atmosphere, oceans, lakes, streams. Water had seeped into\nthe ground, creating imperceptible weaknesses in the crust. And long\nago when the catastrophe came it had struck suddenly. The planet had\nbeen split with such violence that whole chunks had been hurled apart,\neach one intact except that the shock had enlarged on the work begun by\nwater. Faults became underground caverns, tortuous caverns in the rock\nthat intersected the man-made tunnel.\n\nNo matter what their orders were, the guards wouldn't have been\nanxious to explore too far. Under the stress of unusual gravity\nfissures could close again on the unwary--it was possible they'd made\nonly a token search here.\n\n\"If we come here often there ought to be an easier way than this,\" said\nWebber as they went along.\n\nDocchi had been thinking of it. He would be able to tell when he saw it\nwhether it would be possible to move the scanner. If so a good place\nmight be in gravity center. As nearly as he could tell it was almost\ndirectly overhead.\n\nVoices sprang out of the tunnel as they neared the destination. \"Don't\nknow what's keeping them,\" grumbled Jordan. \"Maybe we ought not to\nwait.\"\n\n\"He was looking for you,\" said Jeriann, her voice carrying in the\nstillness of the underground. \"He said it was urgent for you to be\nhere.\"\n\n\"A few minutes won't hurt,\" said Cameron. \"Lucky we found you when we\ndid or you'd have missed it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, lucky?\" growled Jordan. \"I was on my way here when\nyou yelled.\"\n\n\"Have you seen it in operation?\" said Jeriann. \"Cameron said you found\nthe place.\"\n\n\"If I had I'd have told you. The scanner wasn't finished last time I\nwas here. I figured Nona would let us know when she was ready.\"\n\nThe tunnel turned sharply and though they could hear Jordan's voice the\nwords were indistinct. It was a quirk of acoustics because, as they\ntravelled on, utter silence descended. They could hear nothing at all\nuntil the tunnel curved again and they entered the cavern.\n\nHe glanced around once before they were noticed. The nine geepee\nheads Cameron had described were almost indiscernible under the mass\nof circuitry that covered them. Nona had improved the scanner. He\ncould identify some of the components but the arrangement was totally\nunfamiliar.\n\nHe thought he could trace the basic outline. It was a gravity device\nof some kind, what kind he wasn't sure. If he had thought about it\npreviously he would have realized it practically had to be that.\n\n\"They're here,\" said Jeriann at his side, and he hadn't seen how she'd\ngot there. Seconds before she'd been arguing with Jordan and now she\nwas next to him.\n\nJordan looked up and Nona clipped a few connections in place. She\nstayed close to the doctor. \"We all know what we came for so there's no\nneed for preliminaries,\" said Docchi. \"Cameron, can you tell Nona to\nstart the scanner?\"\n\n\"My communication is rather primitive,\" said Cameron with a slight\nsmile. \"However----\" He had no time to say more. Nona didn't move but\nthe scanner responded.\n\nA shape glowed, a vague nebula, far away. It came closer and the nebula\ndissolved--it was a ship. There was darkness all around and yet the\nship wasn't dark. The lights that streamed out of the ports couldn't\naccount for this, there was nothing to reflect it on the hull. Radar\nwas one explanation, a gravity radar. The impulses left the asteroid,\ntraversed the space to the far away object and bounced back--in no-time.\n\n\"It's a military ship,\" said Jordan. \"The biggest.\"\n\nThe ship rocked a little or perhaps the scanner resolved the image\nbetter. The name began to swing into sight. \"Tory,\" repeated Webber\nwhen he was able to read it. \"Victory. And victory always ends with\n_tory_.\"\n\n\"Star Victory,\" said Jeriann as the ship rotated and the full name grew\nvisible. \"They're premature. They haven't won yet.\"\n\n\"But how far away?\" growled Jordan. \"We ought to know the power of the\nscreen.\"\n\nThe scanner wasn't calibrated and so they didn't know the distance.\nLater Nona might add that refinement but if she didn't there was\npractically no way of telling her what they wanted. Now there was\nmerely a three quarter view, the nose of the ship and enough to make\nout that the rockets weren't flaring. Gravity drive of course. But they\nknew that.\n\n\"We've seen it,\" said Webber flatly. \"Now what?\"\n\n\"We're not going to let them take us,\" said Jeriann. \"Docchi will think\nof something.\"\n\nHer confidence wasn't warranted. Actually he'd done little to bring\nthem this far. Intellectual force perhaps. He had turned discontent\ninto something positive--and joint action had so far overcome the\nobstacles. But it was Nona who had given them the power to make the\naction worthwhile. And she was limited too--there would come an end\nto the seemingly endless flow of invention. There were circumstances\nagainst which no ingenuity could prevail.\n\nAt the present they needed more to go on. They knew there was a ship\nbehind them. The relationship had to be defined. Space was vast and\nthey might be able to elude the pursuer. They had to find out where the\nship was.\n\nThey looked at Nona. She was standing close to Cameron, very close. She\nseemed to know what was expected of her, a mass rapport. She touched\nthe doctor wonderingly as he smiled down at her and then she went to\nthe scanner, working on it, changing the connections with negligent\nskill.\n\nThe ship wavered as she worked. It disappeared for seconds and when\nit came back it was rapidly approaching the viewing surface of the\nscanner. Closer--they touched the hull--and then they were inside,\ngazing out of a screen.\n\nJordan frowned. \"They've duplicated the drive--have they duplicated her\nscanner?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Docchi. \"They have telescreens of short range.\nBut there's no reason why two completely different systems can't be\nspliced together.\"\n\nThey were looking at an empty room and no one came in. Impatiently\nNona touched the connections and the scene dissolved, shifted and\nblurred and when it cleared they were elsewhere, another screen, a\ndifferent room. A broadshouldered man hunched over a desk, muttering\nand scratching his scalp. He signed his name several times; one of the\nsheets he crumpled and discarded, first tearing out his signature. The\nrest of the documents he dispatched in a slot.\n\nWhen he turned around they saw it was General Judd.\n\nHe reached hastily for the switch but withdrew his hand before it got\nthere. \"Well, the orphans have come back, hand in hand.\" He smirked\nwith calm deliberation. \"Or should I say arm in arm, Cameron?\"\n\nDocchi noticed it if no one else did. The general hadn't called Cameron\na doctor. As far as the Medicouncil was concerned Cameron probably no\nlonger was. It was the final proof, if Docchi had needed it; of which\nside Cameron was on.\n\n\"We have a whole new alignment,\" continued the general. \"Cameron with\nNona, and our rebellious engineer with Jeriann.\"\n\nDocchi's face began to glitter but he caught the light as it surged\nthrough his veins, willing it to stop before it showed in his skin.\n\"We haven't come back, General. We didn't think it would hurt to talk,\nthough, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"I never mind a little chat, Docchi. Always willing to hear what the\nother fellow has to say--as long as he comes to the point.\"\n\nThe general thought his position was strong enough that he could be as\ninsulting as he wanted. He was very nearly right. \"First we'd like to\nknow what you want.\"\n\n\"Our terms haven't changed a bit. Turn around and go back.\" Judd smiled\nbroadly, an official wolfish expression. \"We don't insist you return to\nthe same orbit. In fact it might be better if you moved the asteroid\ncloser to Earth.\"\n\nWhere the Medicouncil could keep a perpetual watch. And where they\nwould swing through the heavens forever in sight of Earth but never a\npart of it. \"Naturally we don't accept,\" said Docchi. \"However we don't\nreject negotiations completely. There are some of us who might go back\nfor one reason or another--homesickness mostly. If you're willing we\ncan make arrangements to transfer them to your ship.\"\n\n\"Ah, trouble,\" said the general gravely, trying to conceal his delight.\n\"And I think I know where the trouble is. We came fully prepared for\nevery emergency that we--or you--might meet. The Medicouncil is very\nthorough.\"\n\nThe picture of Maureen crouched in a darkened room, whimpering through\nclenched teeth that she didn't want ever to see anyone. The tautness as\none set of muscles extended her hand toward the door and another set\ntore it away. And there were other images, vague now, but in time they\ncould become threatening.\n\nThe Medicouncil _had_ foreseen this; there were biologicals on the ship\nto cure Maureen. Docchi's face twitched and he hoped the general didn't\nnotice. \"I haven't checked to see how many are willing to go with you.\nI will, if it's satisfactory.\"\n\n\"Don't bother,\" said the general. \"In case you weren't listening, I\ndidn't say that we're a cozy little group of altruists, just anxious\nas hell to take over your responsibilities. The biologicals are here.\nYou'll get them when we land a crew to make sure you do go back. My\norders are very plain. We want all of you--or none.\"\n\n\"You know what we'll say,\" said Docchi. \"None of us, of course.\" The\nletdown was less than he expected. He'd half known the conditions; it\nwas consistent with all the attitudes toward accidentals--once human\nbut now not quite. It was a typical way to ease their conscience--load\nthe ship with every medical supply--and then refuse those in need\nunless they all came back. \"We're getting along quite nicely without\nyour help,\" he continued, and if it was less true than he liked, it was\nmore so than the general realized. \"One thing, Judd, don't try to land\n_without_ our consent.\"\n\n\"So you still think we're stupid,\" said the general affably, at ease\nin the situation. _He didn't expect us to surrender_, thought Docchi.\n_Then why had he asked?_ \"We won't attempt to land until you cooperate.\nYou will. Sooner or later you will.\"\n\n\"I hardly think so. We decided that a long time ago.\"\n\nThe general shrugged. \"Suit yourself. Remember we're not vindictive,\nwe're not trying to punish you. We do insist that you're sick and\nhelpless. You'll have to come back and be placed under competent\nmedical care.\" He glanced amusedly at Cameron.\n\n\"You don't act as if we're helpless,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Dangerously sick,\" said the general. \"Have you ever heard of hysteria,\nin which the patient must be protected against himself--and he may hurt\nothers?\" He was fingering a chart on the desk, had been all the while\nhe was talking. He examined it briefly and then looked up. \"What goes\non here? How can you talk across this distance?\"\n\n\"It took you a long time to realize it, General. We're _not_ right next\nto you.\" Again it was Docchi's bad habit to talk too much but there was\na reason for it and this time he wasn't telling the general anything he\nwouldn't figure out for himself.\n\nThe general's jaw hardened and he pawed futilely at the switch. \"How do\nwe do it?\" said Docchi. \"It's our secret.\" But the general didn't reply\nand he wouldn't reveal the information Docchi wanted. Nona finally\nbroke the connection at her end.\n\nWebber breathed noisily as the image faded. He stamped the mechanical\nfoot, echoes rolling through the cavern. \"Will somebody tell me why the\ngeneral's so polite? Why won't he land unless we ask him to?\"\n\n\"It's not consideration,\" said Docchi. \"The asteroid's much larger than\nhis ship, and nearly as fast. Did you ever try to land on a stationary\nport?\"\n\nWebber looked abashed. \"I keep forgetting we're moving.\"\n\n\"Sure. Aside from the fact we could smash his ship and it wouldn't\ninconvenience us unless it hit the dome, not a very large part of the\ntotal surface, what else can he do? Come close and try to send out men\nin space suits? We veer off and leave them stranded until he picks them\nup. If he wants to we'll play tag half way across the galaxy with him.\"\n\n\"So he can't land,\" said Webber, gaining assurance. \"Why didn't I think\nof the reasons?\"\n\n\"Because one man can't figure out everything,\" said Jeriann. \"If there\nwas just Nona we'd still be back in the solar system. Or Docchi by\nhimself, or Jordan, or Anti. Together we get the answers.\"\n\nSo far--but it might not always hold true. Docchi was worried by\nthe general's lack of concern. He hadn't expected to contact the\naccidentals but when they'd got in touch with him he wasn't startled.\nHe knew what to do because he had been told. He wasn't a fast thinker\nwho could improvise, his specialty was carrying out a plan.\n\nBut if Judd was not at first disconcerted he'd made up for it when he\nbecame aware they weren't using conventional communication. Docchi\nwould have given a lot to see the chart the general had. He'd tried to\nprovoke the officer but the ruse hadn't been effective. The general\nknew the distance between the ship and the asteroid, but he hadn't\nrevealed it.\n\nWebber walked noisily to the scanner, peering into the circuits. \"The\ngeneral's communication experts will be working overtime for a while,\"\nhe remarked.\n\n\"For the rest of the voyage. They'll know the scanner's a gravity\ndevice but that won't help them.\" It was another count against them.\nCommunication at practically unlimited range was not a prize easily\ngiven up.\n\nBut what they really wanted was Nona. Indirectly she'd given them back\nthe gravity drive, and now this. And they would think, rightly, that\nthere was more where these inventions came from.\n\nHe wished Anti were here to advise them. Docchi looked around to ask\nJordan about her but he was already gone. Cameron was standing quietly\nin a corner with Nona, talking to her in a low voice while she smiled\nand smiled. Webber was still looking into the scanner.\n\nOnly Jeriann was waiting for him. Now that the general had mentioned\nit, Docchi wondered if she really was waiting for him--and for how long.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nAnti looked up at the dome. It was all she could see with comfort.\nStars changed less than she would have believed. The patterns were\nsubstantially the same as on Earth. Brightness varied with rotation,\nthat was the main difference. Now those overhead were brilliant and\nthat meant she was facing the direction they were travelling. She\nwondered which was Alpha and which Proxima Centauri. She never had been\nable to recognize them.\n\nShe extended one arm, splashing acid. Lately there were times she had\nto keep moving if she didn't want to freeze. It wasn't pleasant but she\ncould endure it for the sake of walking some day. There were degrees of\nhelplessness and no one else, even here, was completely immobilized,\nconfined completely to a specialized environment. She had forgotten\nmuch of the past and couldn't see far into the future. Perhaps it\nwasn't worth looking into.\n\n\"Quiet, you'll scare the fish.\"\n\nShe paddled around until she could see Jordan. \"If you find fish who\ncan live in this, throw them in. I'll welcome any kind of company.\"\n\n\"Maybe Cameron can mutate fish to stand the cold,\" suggested Jordan.\n\"Or if that fails he can always transfer the fungus to them.\"\n\n\"I don't wish it on anything, even a fish.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't hurt. Besides, it might make them immortal.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I like fish, but not as playmates. They're better on a plate.\"\n\n\"Barbaric,\" said Jordan. \"I prefer scientific food, synthetics. Wholly\nremoved from the taint of the living creature. Something that didn't\ndie in quick agony so that you could smack your lips. Germ free,\ncompounded of balanced elements.\"\n\n\"Came from nature myself,\" said Anti. \"Uncivilized though it is, I\nprefer nutrition from the same source.\"\n\n\"You're confusing yourself,\" commented Jordan. \"Synthetics contain\neverything necessary for life. When was the last time Jeriann ate?\"\n\n\"Longer than she cares to remember. Besides you're quibbling. She gets\nconcentrates, which is not the same as synthetics.\"\n\n\"A minor point,\" conceded Jordan, coming closer. \"However I didn't\nintend to talk about food.\"\n\n\"I don't care what it is as long as you talk. I need conversation too.\"\n\n\"There's Nona,\" began Jordan.\n\n\"Exceptions, exceptions. What do I care except that I get tired of\nstaring up at nothing? Sometimes I wish they'd planted the tank at the\nentrance to the hospital. People'd have to stop and talk.\"\n\n\"For a while I was thinking of that.\"\n\n\"No you don't,\" said Anti. \"There are useful things that have to be\ndone.\"\n\n\"I abandoned the idea when I considered what your viewpoint would be.\nBut we did move the tank once.\"\n\n\"Never again. Anyway geepees are scarce and who else could do it?\"\n\n\"I could,\" said Jordan. He added quickly: \"It's a joke.\" He swung along\nthe tank until he was as close as he could get without toppling in.\n\"Instead of something you'd forget once I left, I brought a gift.\"\n\n\"What is it? I can't see from this angle.\"\n\n\"It's a belt.\"\n\n\"You doll. It's beautiful.\"\n\n\"No it's not--merely wonderful.\"\n\n\"I know. Save it for me, till later. It will go swoosh if acid touches\nit.\"\n\n\"It positively will not react. I took care of that. There are some\nmetals that are just about inert. It wasn't easy to cover it but I did.\"\n\n\"You made it for me. You shouldn't have.\"\n\nJordan puzzled himself with it. He hadn't much to do with it. At\nthe most he'd made a protective covering for it. Nona was solely\nresponsible for the way it functioned. And there was no doubt whom she\nintended it for; that was why he hadn't hesitated taking it. And yet,\nwhy hadn't she turned it over to Anti? It was working perfectly the\nfirst time he saw it.\n\nThe logical answer was that it wasn't in operating condition, that she\ncouldn't make it work and had laid it aside for further inspiration.\nBut this led to nonsensical conclusions involving the repair robot.\nHe refused to accept the conclusions. \"Let's say I didn't make it\nentirely. I added to what was existing.\" He swung the belt out to her.\n\n\"Are you sure it will fit? I'm quite big.\"\n\n\"Originally it wouldn't. I had to make it longer.\"\n\nAnti examined the belt at length. \"Hammered link effect. Primitive but\nstriking.\"\n\nJordan blushed. \"I thought it was a pretty smooth job. I had to do it\nby hand.\"\n\n\"It is,\" exclaimed Anti. \"You have a strong unconscious sense of\ndesign.\" With trepidation she lowered it in the acid and when nothing\nhappened she fastened it. \"There,\" she said in triumph. \"The first\npiece of jewelry in years. I feel like a new woman.\"\n\n\"You are, Anti. Believe me, you are.\"\n\nShe laughed giddily. \"It's silly, but I do believe it. It's amazing\nwhat jewelry will do for a woman.\"\n\n\"It's not exactly jewelry.\" Jordan tried to think of how to explain\nit. Anti was unscientific, or better--prescientific. \"Think of it as a\ncomplicated machine that's remotely connected to your mind.\"\n\n\"My mind? Am I supposed to be telepathic now? Is that what it is? Can I\ntalk with anyone, no matter at what distance they are?\"\n\n\"No, you're not telepathic except well maybe in a certain way.\"\n\nJordan was silent, trying to sort the explanation. It never occurred\nto her that machines operated at different levels, many of them\nsimultaneously, electrical or electromagnetic, others more subtle.\nJordan gave up. \"Think of what you'd most like to do.\"\n\n\"It's no use, Jordan. I won't torment myself. I know how long it's\ngoing to take.\"\n\nHe should have kept it and demonstrated. That would have convinced\nher. He would never forget the first time he had worn it--and nearly\nfrightened himself off the ceiling. He cast about for other ways but\nnothing else was necessary. Anti was thinking of what she'd forbidden\nherself to contemplate.\n\n\"There,\" said Jordan, his voice rough with pride. \"I knew you'd get the\nhang of it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so?\" said Anti. \"The gravity computer. My mind and\n_that_ mind.\"\n\nFor a prescientific person she'd grasped the essentials quickly.\n\"Jordan, maybe you should keep it,\" she called. \"You can use it as well\nas I can.\"\n\n\"I don't need it,\" he said. \"Nobody's heard me complaining. And you\ncan't, or couldn't move.\" He gazed at her in alarm. \"Come on down,\" he\nshouted. \"You can't catch the stars by yourself.\"\n\n\"You think I can't?\" said Anti. \"I'll come closer to it than anyone who\never lived.\"\n\nNevertheless she obeyed his instructions, sinking slowly until her feet\ntouched the ground. The grass crackled and smouldered, though it was\ngreen, bursting into flame where she walked as the acid dripped down.\nAnd it was walking, though her legs carried only a fraction of her real\nweight. The rest of the weight was destroyed for her convenience by\nthe gravity computer as it responded continually and repeatedly to her\nunspoken commands.\n\n\"The doctor will be surprised,\" muttered Jordan.\n\n\"Not as much as I am,\" said Anti. \"I can fly if I want, but do you\nknow, I'd rather walk.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDocchi teetered on the chair. Not much; if he fell he had no way of\nstopping himself, and there was the devil's own time getting up. \"I'm\nspeechless,\" he said.\n\n\"So was Cameron,\" said Anti.\n\n\"I imagine. He didn't expect his prognosis to be disproved so soon.\"\nDocchi righted the chair. \"This is the thing Jordan's been working on.\"\n\n\"He said he didn't have much to do with it. He would.\" Anti moved\nwarily. The acid soaked robe had stopped dripping but there was enough\nleft to react with subdued violence if she came into contact with the\nwrong substance. \"The best is I'm already stronger--using my muscles\nmore. I don't have an exact way of knowing since there aren't gadgets\nand dials in my mind but it seems to me I can support a lot more of my\nweight. Maybe I can walk unaided at quarter gravity.\"\n\nDocchi let the calls, of which there were several, go unattended.\nIt was the first big personal victory for any accidental and it was\nheartening amidst the general uncertainties. \"Fine, fine. But how long\ncan you continue? Won't you revert?\"\n\n\"Cameron says I won't. He made several tests which indicate the\nvirulence of the fungus. He says the body conquers.\"\n\nAnd for her it had. The biological mechanism had reached the point of\nstrength wherein it could contain the attenuated invasion with little\noutside help. After some indefinite period the menace would be reduced,\nfinally vanquished, utterly and forever. The body conquered.\n\n\"Cameron says it will be enough to sleep in the tank. I don't mind,\nthough I won't get much sleep. I feel the cold now, though not as much\nas anyone else would.\n\n\"For the rest I'll increase the weight on my legs as much as I can.\nIt's almost automatic; no buttons to push except mentally. If I get\ntired I think myself lighter.\"\n\nThe mechanism couldn't be improved on. It was a portable null gravity\nfield that fit neatly around her and touched nothing else. And if\nAnti had reported Jordan's views correctly, it was impossible to\nbuild another like it because they didn't have the parts. It was an\nexcellent device but not of great importance except to Anti. Jordan\ncould use one too and so could a number of others though they wouldn't\nget it. It replaced legs and was more efficient in all respects save\nappearance.\n\nThere was nothing, however, that was a substitute for hands.\n\n\"Now that you're up and moving, what do you want to do?\" he said. \"You\nmust be anxious to get busy.\"\n\n\"It's a funny thing but I'm not,\" she said. \"It sounds queer but I want\nto look around. I haven't seen anything except what I could glimpse\nfrom the tank.\"\n\nDocchi rocked back; he'd always thought of her as knowing more about\nthe asteroid than anyone else. In a personal sense she did, having been\nthere longer than anyone he could name. It was said she may even have\nbeen responsible for the building of the asteroid, so they'd have some\nplace to put her. It might be true. \"Go ahead. Jordan will show you\naround. You don't have to be in a hurry to take a job.\"\n\nAnti rose a few inches to show that she could. \"First I want to visit\nthe laboratory Nona has. I want to see the ship that's after us. I know\nthey haven't given up just because they can't land.\"\n\nHe felt so too though he hadn't figured out what they could do. \"Let me\nknow if anything occurs to you.\"\n\nWhen she left, walking by preference, the responsibilities came back,\nMaureen and other deficients with various degrees of disability, the\nship with undetermined resources behind them, stars and planets ahead\nof them, unknown or vaguely guessed at, mysterious. They'd reach their\ngoal but all of the accidentals might not survive.\n\nAnti alone was better off but there were others who were not. It was\ndepressing at times, so much freedom and so little to show for it.\nDocchi went back to work but the image of the ship kept rising up out\nof the countless important and unimportant decisions he had to make.\nWhat did they plan to do?\n\nLate the following day Anti returned. She marched in determinedly and\nsat down. It was no longer remarkable that a few chairs would fit her.\nShe'd never be mistaken for someone else, but her bulk had diminished\nconsiderably and her weight was whatever she wanted. That the chair\ndidn't collapse in a soggy mass or burst into flame was an indication\nthat Jordan had found a way to neutralize the acid that clung to her\nwithout reducing the medical effectiveness. \"Nice place we have,\" she\nremarked. \"Didn't realize it was so pretty.\"\n\n\"There are others who disagree.\"\n\n\"They don't really see it. The only thing I don't like is the ship.\"\n\n\"Neither do I. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Well----\" Anti hesitated. \"What did it look like to you?\"\n\nHe described it as he remembered, answering the questions with which\nshe kept interrupting. After he finished she was silent, nodding to\nherself as if he wasn't there. \"You know what I think,\" she said. \"You\nsaw it three quarters, from the front. When I looked it was flatter.\nThey're gaining.\"\n\nDocchi glanced out the window. \"Anti, they can't land here unless we\nlet them--and we won't. What else can they do?\"\n\n\"It's a military ship. They've got the force to stop us.\"\n\n\"Not without shattering the dome, or blowing the place apart. And they\nwon't. You don't cure a sick person by killing him, and for their own\npeace of mind they've convinced themselves that we're sick.\"\n\n\"So we're safe there,\" commented Anti dubiously. \"They figured at first\nthey'd sneak up and land before we knew it. The scanner squashed that.\nBut they had other plans from the very beginning, what they'd do if we\ndiscovered them in time.\" She nodded and nodded. \"Well, if it was me\nand I couldn't stop somebody, I'd try to get where they're going before\nthey did. It ties right in, doesn't it? They don't want us to contact\naliens. All they have to do is get there first.\"\n\nOf course. It was very plain, but anxiety had prevented his seeing it.\nFearfulness was often next door to stupidity. Whoever got there first\ncontrolled the situation even more than Anti realized. He began to\nsuspect the depth of preparation that was against them, the intense\nfury and careful planning they had to overcome. Mankind was capable of\nmore hatred for its own kind than it ever expended against outsiders.\nMethodically Docchi began kicking open switches.\n\n\"You're right, Anti,\" he said. \"But I think there are ways to see that\nthey don't get there first.\" He was lying blithely, perhaps as much\nbecause he didn't want to face what he foresaw. \"If those don't work,\nand there's a chance they won't, we have an unexpected ally.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Not who, what. Distance.\" It was a most preposterous untruth. \"If we\ndon't get there in time we'll let them have both of the Centauris.\nWe'll go on to the next star.\"\n\n\"You can always think of some way out,\" said Anti as tiny lights began\nto flash on the panel. The flickering confusion there matched his\nemotions.\n\n\"Jordan?\" he said urgently when the latter appeared on the screen. And\nafter that there was Webber and anyone else who knew something about\nelectronics or could be taught with a minimum of instruction. They were\nwilling to drive themselves to exhaustion but there was no substitute\nfor technical superiority.\n\n\"Now don't worry,\" said Anti after he'd finished summoning everyone who\ncould help. \"I have a feeling they can't stop us no matter what they\ndo.\"\n\n\"That so?\" he said. \"Which toe tells you that, or is it an ache in your\nbones? Think it will rain tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Don't laugh,\" said Anti, rising and leaving with him as he hurried\nout. \"I have confidence in what we're able to do together.\"\n\nIt was a good thing someone did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Maureen's getting worse,\" said Jeriann. \"I need more power.\" There was\na tiny bead of sweat on her temple, the first Docchi had seen since\nordinarily she didn't perspire.\n\n\"How much worse? I'd like to see her.\"\n\nJeriann made a final adjustment on the machine but didn't straighten up\nimmediately as if it disturbed her to contemplate what went on in her\nown mind. She snapped the synthesizer on and turned around, brushing\nthe hair away from her eyes. \"Do you think your diagnosis is better\nthan Cameron's?\"\n\n\"I wasn't doubting his ability.\"\n\n\"You'll have to take our word for it. I can see her because I'm a woman\nand she hardly reacts to me. Cameron can visit her because she's been\nconditioned to accept him. Even so he has to take precautions. The\nhypnotics control only the surface of her mind.\"\n\n\"What precautions?\"\n\n\"Sprays that plasticize his skin. By now her senses are far keener than\nours. The doctor has a cosmetic technician recreate his face, something\nimpersonal with which she had no association.\"\n\n\"I'll take your word for it. I don't want to see her under those\nconditions. But you didn't answer my question: how much worse?\"\n\nThe smock was clearly a laboratory garment to protect the wearer from\nchemical irritation and the chemicals from human contamination. It\nwas only incidental there was a certain light in which it was almost\ntransparent. Jeriann became aware she was standing in such a light and\nswished the smock angrily around her and moved out of the illumination.\n\"I can tell you this: neither Cameron nor I will be responsible for\nkeeping her alive longer than three weeks, _unless I get that power_.\"\n\n\"Is this what Cameron said?\"\n\n\"It's my own idea. I know more about this machine than he does. But you\ncan ask him. He'll back me up.\"\n\nDocchi didn't doubt her but there was more to think of than the fate of\none individual. \"You're just guessing, aren't you? There's a chance, if\nyou experiment wildly enough, you'll find the right compounds.\"\n\n\"Please,\" said Jeriann. \"It will only be for a few weeks. Less than\nthat if it works the way I think it will.\"\n\n\"What about the other deficients? They need biologicals too.\"\n\n\"They can wait and Maureen can't.\"\n\nReluctantly he gave consent. \"Then you can have all the power you need,\nfor the next few days anyway. After that we'll see.\"\n\n\"You're a dear.\" Jeriann walked through the lab, inspecting it\ncritically from every angle. \"Of course I'll need help. Part of the\ntrouble is that we can't get enough power to the machine, we're not\nusing it to the full capacity. With larger power connections we'll be\nable to turn out stuff we haven't touched on before.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"That wasn't in the bargain. You can have all the\npower the existing lines will take. But we can't spare men to install\nnew lines. The technicians we have are busy elsewhere.\"\n\n\"It's such a little thing,\" she coaxed. \"The machine's not a sledge\nhammer that smashes molecules apart and then crushes them into a new\nchemical alignment. It's a keen instrument, an ultramicrosize knife\nthat slits delicately here and there and then slides the separated\natoms together to form a different molecule.\"\n\n\"I'm not arguing about power,\" he said adamantly. \"I said you can have\nit and you can. Trained men you can't. I'll see if I can spare them\nafter what they're working on is finished.\"\n\nShe stopped as if she'd stumbled into a taut wire she hadn't noticed.\nShe looked at him thoughtfully and strolled back to the synthesizer,\nunder the light that shone down and provocatively through the smock.\nShe wore other clothing but that too seemed almost to vanish. \"For me,\nwon't you? Just a few men for a few days. It means a lot to Maureen.\"\n\n\"I can't let you have technicians now,\" he said obstinately.\n\nShe glanced at him curiously, sauntering closer as if to get a better\nlook. \"I forgot. Cameron has Nona, hasn't he? They're going to get\nmarried as soon as he can figure out a simple ceremony. And now you\nhate women, don't you? That's why you won't give Maureen the same\nchance you'd give a man.\"\n\nHe rocked back under the cold hatred. He had no idea she was capable of\nsuch venom. \"You're reading into my emotions something that was never\nthere. I'm glad Nona found someone she can respond to. But why are you\nso concerned with Maureen? You never liked her.\"\n\n\"What rationalization,\" she said bitterly. \"It makes no difference what\nI thought about her. She's going to die if I don't help her, and I\nwill. I'd expect the same from anyone else.\"\n\n\"Jeriann,\" he said but she was gone, tearing the smock off and\nthrusting it on a hook, leaving him alone beside a machine that\nalternately hummed and purred in oily accents. He stared at it with\ncomplete lack of interest as the cycle changed. The synthesizer\ngrunted with satisfied pride and three drops of a colorless fluid were\ndischarged into a retort.\n\nIf there was no other way they could save Maureen by contacting the\nexpedition behind them. They had the supplies Jeriann was trying vainly\nto duplicate. But that was surrender and the only alternative was to go\nahead as planned.\n\nDocchi left the laboratory, taking the long way around to avoid the\ndoctor's office. Cameron wouldn't put the same pressure on him that\nJeriann had--no one could. Why did she have to think he was responsible?\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nThe dimensions of the place were fear, panic and loneliness. It was\nno-time or all-time, the endless instant of survival--or less. It was\nlight or it wasn't, the illumination of the closed mind, the intellect\nturned in on itself, perception curled backward while it reached for\nthe outside world. It was a universe which neither existed nor would\never quite vanish.\n\nAnd there wasn't a sound. To the distorted senses, wavering and\nuncertain, sounds could be masculine. \"Yes?\" said Maureen poutingly.\n\"Where are you now?\" But she couldn't hear what she said. So she\nstopped speaking.\n\nIt was forbidden.\n\nThe bloodstream left her heart and had no path but to return deviously.\nIt travelled darkly with many branches, pounding, flushed with oxygen\nfrom the lung machines. The mind was turned inward. The body was turned\ninward. Life had no place to go. It was out of balance.\n\nHer feet touched the floor and she got out of bed. The flesh was heavy.\nThe tube in her chest whistled with exertion. There was oxygen, too\nmuch of it, but there was no substitute for the regulative substances\nher body didn't have. She was falling apart, pulled apart by the wild\ndissimilar tendencies of all her cells.\n\nShe kept on walking until she lunged against a wall. Her nose splayed\nto one side but her veins weren't ready to bleed. There was nothing to\ntell them to let out the red drops. She fell down and got up, walking\non, banging against the wall.\n\nShe could never find anyone she knew. After a while she realized the\nperson she missed most was herself.\n\nWhy was it light without being light and dark with no darkness? Her\neyes had forgotten they were supposed to see. She sat down in the\nmiddle of the floor and began plucking at the hospital gown, pulling it\napart thread by thread. Her mind said she didn't feel what she touched\nbut she didn't believe everything. She practiced playing tricks on her\nthoughts. There were so many tricks to play and such few thoughts.\n\nShe sat there, pretending to listen to something that nobody said. She\nwaved her fingers languidly and closed her eyes with deep regret, lips\ncurved for the kiss that wasn't given.\n\nCameron came in and hurried out after one glimpse, calling for Jeriann.\nThe deterioration was proceeding more rapidly than he expected. There\nwere not three weeks left. It might be less than three days.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWebber nodded and went on working, aware that Anti was watching the\ncoordination of his dissimilar arms and legs. It didn't disturb the\nrhythm of his movements. Anti moved to the other side to get a better\nview of what he was doing and as she did so remembered what she'd come\nfor.\n\n\"So that's why I couldn't get a book. What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing. We're tearing it down to move it.\"\n\n\"Why move it? This is where the books are.\"\n\nHe bent over the mechanism, disconnecting it. \"I don't know. You'll\nhave to ask Docchi.\"\n\nHe knew but was too engrossed to stop. Jordan could tell her but he\nwasn't here. She wandered through the library but found no one who\ncould or would give her information. What made it worse was, with the\nlibrarian torn apart, there wasn't a book available.\n\nShe was curiously perturbed. She knew where she could find Docchi, at\ngravity center where he had taken over the quarters formerly occupied\nby Vogel. More and more the asteroid was beginning to resemble a ship\nand if there was a definite control area it was located in gravity\ncenter.\n\nThe first thing she saw when she entered the low structure--most of the\ngravity installation was underground--was the scanner. It had changed;\nthe last trace of the makeshift origin had disappeared. It was metal\nencased and dials and switches replaced connections formerly made by\nhand. These alterations were Nona's but bringing it here was Docchi's\nidea. Anti frowned contemplatively; it wasn't far in straight distances\nfrom where Nona had originally constructed it, but the labor involved\nin carrying it through miles of tunnels and then overland to where it\nwas now standing--that was considerable effort. It didn't square with\nwhat Jeriann had told her.\n\nShe found Docchi a few stories below the entrance level, somewhere near\nthe actual gravity computers. He looked up and then wriggled his head\nout of the harness. \"Have you come to help, Anti?\"\n\n\"Nope. I've got a complaint.\"\n\nHis smile wasn't appreciative. \"The headquarters for that are in the\nother division.\"\n\nShe ignored the reference to Jeriann. \"I'd help if I could but I'm\nignorant. And you're keeping me from learning.\"\n\n\"The library?\"\n\n\"Of course. I can't get a single book.\"\n\nHe looked at the design he'd been working on and then reluctantly\nstepped out of the machine which enabled him to put his ideas on paper.\n\n\"Don't stop drawing because of me,\" said Anti.\n\n\"It was nearly done. Jordan can carry on from there.\" He sat down while\nAnti remained standing, balancing an imaginary basket of fruit on her\nhead. The years in the tank had ruined her posture.\n\n\"I'm sorry we had to take the librarian but you can still get books.\nI've figured out a formula.\"\n\n\"First I have to be a mathematician and then I've got to crawl back in\nthe stacks? There must be places no one can get to, especially tapes\nand music.\"\n\n\"That's the way it is. We'll have to go over the whole setup, relocate\nthe stacks and train human librarians.\"\n\n\"Seems like a waste when what we had was working perfectly.\"\n\n\"We had to do it if we want to get to Centauri before they do.\" He\njerked his head to indicate out there.\n\n\"But what good is it? The librarian is just a----\" She closed her mouth.\n\n\"Just a memory system? That's what we need to duplicate the drive they\nhave. Of course the librarian remembers the wrong thing but we're\nchanging that.\"\n\n\"Can't we do it in some other way?\"\n\n\"Not in time with the facilities we have. Maybe Nona could but the rest\nof us are just humans.\"\n\n\"Well, what's wrong with her?\"\n\n\"Nothing. If you can get her interested in building a control unit I'll\nstep aside.\"\n\n\"Why build it? She _is_ the control.\"\n\n\"Now she is, but there are a number of reasons why a mechanical control\nis better. For one thing we don't know how much of her attention it\nrequires. The drive may not function at all when she isn't consciously\nthinking about it.\"\n\n\"But the gravity never stops.\"\n\n\"True, but does it apply to acceleration? We can't measure that.\"\n\n\"You're working on a lot of suppositions--it may do this--it may not do\nthat.\"\n\n\"We don't have to guess at one thing, Anti. The expedition is gaining\non us. And _they_ are using a mechanical control.\"\n\nAnti looked over at the drawing Docchi had made. A bunch of squiggles.\n\"You know more about it than I do. If it's your opinion that this is\nwhat we should have, then we ought to. To me it seems that another kind\nof control won't make much difference.\"\n\n\"Review what we have. A nuclear pile that supplies all the power, a set\nof gravity coils, and three computers. One computer figures the gravity\nfor the asteroid. Another calculates the propulsive force. The third,\nwe think, actuates the scanner. Nona may rotate the duties among the\ncomputers and the unit we're building will do the same.\n\n\"But this is what we can do that Nona doesn't: we'll cut everything\nto a minimum except the drive. Gravity, light, heat, all the personal\nconveniences will be cut to the least we can stand.\"\n\nAnti rose a few inches and thought herself back to the floor. \"This is\nwhat you'll do if it works the way you imagine.\"\n\n\"It will, Anti.\" Docchi's face was set. \"Nona's too considerate. As\nlong as she has it she won't impose the sacrifices we're glad to make\nourselves. We're taking it out of her hands.\"\n\nIf they needed somebody to make hard decisions, Docchi was the man. It\nwas a crusade with him and he was willing to drive everyone the same as\nhimself. Anti looked at his face and decided against the question she'd\ncome to ask. \"Sounds grim, but you're right. We're willing if there's a\nchance we'll get there first. What can I do to help?\"\n\n\"Reorganize the library. Get assistants to reach in the places too\nsmall for you. Collect the medical texts first. Cameron may need them.\"\n\n\"A thankless job,\" muttered Anti. \"I started out to _read_ a book.\"\n\nDocchi smiled. \"I thought you had enough of sedentary life.\"\n\n\"I have, but not enough of books. Picture and music tapes were easy to\nget in the tank but they didn't make acid proof books. Limited demand,\nI suppose.\"\n\n\"Here's the formula I've worked out. Books are selected according to\nsubject and author, filed according to size and date received.\" He went\nover the procedure until she had it straight.\n\n\"I guess I can do it,\" she said dubiously. \"But why not start at one\nend and go through to the other side of the stacks?\"\n\n\"You've got to segregate the medical references first.\"\n\nBelated compensation because he had refused Jeriann? Perhaps, but he\nwas not that simple. If anything it was just recognition of what came\nfirst in importance. \"A tedious job,\" she grumbled as she started to\nleave.\n\n\"It is. But, except for what we are as persons and what we create in\nthe future, it's the total of our human heritage. It's the last we'll\nget.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I believe----\" said Anti. \"Oh, never mind what a huge old\nwoman thinks.\" She went out the door and when she came back seconds\nlater Docchi was again drawing.\n\n\"Yes, Anti?\"\n\n\"You can start cutting down on me. I won't mind.\"\n\n\"When it's necessary I'll take you up on it. I don't think it will\nbe. It doesn't take much power to run the computers and they're always\nfunctioning anyway. And when we drop to quarter gravity, which is the\nminimum we'll go, you won't actually need your gadget. You see, you're\nnot holding us back.\"\n\n\"Just the same if it will help I'll stay in the tank.\"\n\nHis face glittered and his eyes strayed back to the work. \"If it's\nnecessary I'll ask you,\" he repeated.\n\nAnti left again, secure in the knowledge that he would do as he said.\nIn his own way Docchi was as ruthless as Judd. But the purpose was\ndifferent and therefore the comparison not accurate. Strength was not\neasy to define.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe librarian resembled an angular metallic squid spread out to dry\non the floor. Docchi picked his way through the wiry tentacles,\nscrutinizing the work of the crew. He squatted near Webber, watching\nhim splice and adjust the components, briefly giving advice and then\nmoving on to the next man. The librarian was dormant but to Docchi's\npracticed eye it was nearly ready to be recalled to the semi-life of a\nmemory machine.\n\nJordan came swinging in. Docchi heard him and turned. He knew who\nit was by the sound but seemed disappointed to find his judgment\nconfirmed. \"The star chart drum is finished,\" said Jordan, pausing at\nthe tangle of wires. \"Most of the observed data on the neighboring\nstars is included. Of course all the locations are figured from Earth.\"\n\n\"It's all right. The computers won't mind making the conversions.\" With\nhis foot Docchi nudged a tool toward him that Webber was reaching for.\n\"What about the crossover relays?\"\n\n\"Done too, waiting to be tied in. Guaranteed to switch from one\ncomputer to the other before even they realize what's happening.\"\n\n\"Good. The next thing is the impulse recognition hunter. Last night\nI thought of a way to make the selection tighter. Here, I'll show\nyou.\" Docchi went to a diagram strewn desk and waited while Jordan\npawed through the sheets for him. \"There it is,\" he said when Jordan\nuncovered it.\n\nJordan studied it in silence. \"Can't make it,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Why not? It's not difficult.\"\n\n\"Yeah. But we can't manage the delivery from Earth. Don't have all the\nparts here.\" Jordan scratched his chest. \"Tell you what. Think I can\nrob nonessential stuff and put together something like this.\" He took a\npencil and began to sketch rapidly.\n\n\"It'll do,\" said Docchi, finally approving it after a number of changes.\n\nJordan scratched in the alterations. \"Why so tight?\" he complained,\nfolding the sheet and tucking it away. \"The computers don't have to be\ncontrolled so tight. They never have disobeyed.\"\n\n\"I know, and I'm not going to give them a chance. Every watt we allot\nmust be used on the drive and for no other purpose.\"\n\nPrivately Jordan doubted it was necessary. When he thought of the great\nnuclear pile that warmed the heart of the asteroid and drove them on\nhe didn't see how a mere ship, no matter how efficient, could surpass\nthem. True, the ship was travelling faster now but that was because\nthey weren't exerting their full energies. And when they did--Jordan\nshrugged and creased the paper again, swinging away.\n\nAt the door he swerved to miss Jeriann. \"Hi,\" he said, hurrying a\nlittle faster. It was none of his concern what went on but he didn't\nhave to be around when it blew up.\n\nJeriann returned the greeting and stood at the entrance. \"May I come\nin?\"\n\n\"Certainly. There's no sign it's restricted to electronic technicians.\"\n\nWebber winked at her and bent his head over his work. Docchi was\nexpressionless. \"I want to talk to you,\" she said.\n\n\"About Maureen? I've heard. Go ahead.\"\n\nShe'd hoped he'd suggest a more private place but it was evident he\ndidn't want to be alone with her. She didn't altogether blame him.\n\"What I asked for the other day wasn't very realistic. It was mostly my\nfault. I had at least a month to think of getting a larger power supply\nto the machine but I thought I could get along without it. It was my\nown shortsightedness and I had no reason to expect you to drop what\nyou're doing.\"\n\n\"You don't have to apologize. We're all trying to do our best--and\nvarious needs do conflict. Actually I might have found some way to\nrun the extra power line if I hadn't been sure it was an act of pure\ndesperation, that you had no idea of what you were going to do with it\nwhen you got it.\"\n\nWhat made it worse was that he was right. The impulse had been\nirrational, the feeling that there must be something that would help.\nHe should have said he was at fault too, that he should have built the\ncommand unit months ago. It made no difference he hadn't known there\nwas a ship behind them. He should have said it.\n\n\"It's over,\" she said. \"We've done what we could. I thought you'd like\nto see her while there's time.\"\n\n\"I can't leave for another ten hours. None of us can. We've got to get\nit wrapped up if it's going to be of any use at all,\" said Docchi,\nlooking at what remained to be done. \"Wait. You said I can see her.\nSounds to me like she's better.\" He scanned her face hopefully.\n\nShe shook her head. \"It doesn't mean that. We've stopped using\nhypnotics because they're no longer effective. Heavy sedatives,\nextremely heavy, are the only things that keep her from jumping up and\nrunning out to die.\"\n\nHis face was sallow. This was one of the times his slender shoulderless\nbody seemed frailer than it was. \"I'll come as soon as I can get away.\nWe're near the finish line on this.\" He turned and walked past Webber\nto the far end of the room, bending over a technician's work to examine\nit.\n\nShe was trying to tell him and all he had to do was half listen. Nobody\nblamed either of them. Maureen wouldn't, if she were capable of any\nkind of judgment. From his position among the tangled tentacles of the\nmechanical squid, seemingly strangled by the motionless machinery,\nWebber winked soberly at her. Jeriann bit her lip and hurried out.\nHer eyes burned but that was all. Her body was protected against\nunnecessary fluid loss.\n\nIt wasn't possible to drive the technicians. They weren't very skilled\nand the work was delicate. From the beginning they had known the\nimportance of what they were doing and they were already at their top\nspeed and above that no increase in productivity could be achieved.\nWhen he said ten hours Docchi optimistically thought eighteen.\n\nAnd yet they were done in nine. Not because it would help\nMaureen--they knew it wouldn't. But because--well, why? Nobody asked\nfor explanations. They made no mistakes; nothing had to be torn down\nand built again. And the less skilled men, those who puttered from\none instruction to the next, stalling between orders, now seemed to\nanticipate what they would be told and to complete the work before it\nwas given to them. They learned fast and what they didn't know how to\ndo was done right anyway.\n\nThe wires ceased to resemble tentacles and were neatly arranged in the\ncabinet of the command unit, formerly the librarian, which was then\nmoved against the wall. Calling in Jordan and discussing it with him,\nDocchi left the remainder of the work in his capable hands.\n\nHe was tired all over, inside and out. He didn't want to see anyone\ndie, not someone he had been partly responsible for sentencing,\nwhatever the circumstances. He walked along in the semi-twilight,\nwishing there was a cool breeze. He hadn't ordered one and so it\nwas missing. Before long there wouldn't be any power to spare for\ncirculation of the air.\n\nAnti met him at the hospital steps, going up with him. \"I've been\nwaiting. I didn't want to go in alone.\"\n\nHe talked to her briefly and they went on in silence. The asteroid was\nbeing diminished, perhaps already had been. They all had first hand\nknowledge of what death was--at one time or another they'd brushed very\nnear to it--but they were not accustomed to losing the encounter. One\nof their own kind, who should live for hundreds of years, would not.\n\nJeriann heard them and came outside of the hushed room. \"I don't know\nwhat to say,\" she whispered. \"Oh yes I do. I wish I had your face,\nDocchi. You would see it shining.\"\n\nWhatever she thought, her face _was_ shining, though not in the same\nway. He looked into her eyes but they were not easy to read. \"You did\nit,\" he whispered.\n\n\"I don't know why I'm talking so low,\" she said, raising her voice. \"It\ndoesn't hurt now. No, I didn't have anything to do with it. Come in and\nsee her.\"\n\nMaureen was sleeping. Her breathing was light but regular as the\nlung machines responded normally. Her skin was waxen but it was not\nunhealthy. The wrinkles of strain had fallen away and her face was\nrelaxed in the beauty of survival.\n\n\"Go ahead and talk,\" said Cameron from the corner as he bent over an\nanalyzer. \"I shot her full of dope. I guess I didn't have to--she'll\nsleep now no matter what you do.\"\n\n\"Thanks, doctor,\" said Docchi. \"We're lucky to have you.\"\n\n\"Not half as lucky as I am to be here. Damnedest thing I ever saw. My\ncolleagues wouldn't believe it.\" Carefully he closed the analyzer and\nrolled it away. \"I forget I no longer have colleagues.\"\n\n\"The more remarkable. Your efforts alone.\"\n\n\"I guess you don't understand. I had nothing to do with it,\" said\nCameron. \"I was an interested and awed spectator but nothing more. The\nperson who saved Maureen was Maureen herself.\"\n\n\"Now how could she?\" said Anti. \"She lacked male hormones and the\nbodily processes were out of control, upset, running away with\nthemselves.\" She raised a few inches from the floor to get a better\nglimpse of the patient. The best refutation of Anti's argument was\nMaureen herself.\n\n\"It couldn't happen to anyone but an accidental,\" began Jeriann, but\nCameron cut her off.\n\nHis voice was cool and dry, that of a lecturer. It was the only chance\nhe'd get to share his discovery. \"You know why you're biocompensators:\nthe severe injury, and later pulling through with the help of medical\nscience, developing the extraordinary resistance I spoke of. You had\nto have it or you didn't live. And the resistance remained after the\ninjury was gone.\n\n\"In Maureen's case every function began to be disturbed after the\nsupply of hormones was cut off. It got worse as we were unable to\nmanufacture what she needed. She developed a raging fever and was in\na constant state of hallucination. In an earlier era she would have\nbeen a mass of cancerous tissue. Fortunately we are now able to control\ncancer quite simply.\n\n\"At any rate she was rapidly reaching the state where there was no\ncoordination at all. Death should have been the result--but the body\nstepped in.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how?\" said Anti.\n\n\"I don't know but I'm going to find out,\" said Cameron. \"Last time I\ntested all the normal hormones were present. Somehow, out of tissues\nthat weren't adapted to it, her body built up new organs and glands\nthat supply her with the substances she needs to live.\"\n\nCell by cell the body had refused to die. Organs and nerves and tissues\nhad fought the enveloping chaos. The body as a whole and in parts tried\nto survive but it was not adapted to conditions. So it adapted.\n\nNerves forged new paths in places they had never gone before because\nthere was nothing at the end which they could attach to. But by the\ntime they arrived at their destination certain specialized cells had\nchanged their specialty. All cells in the adult body derived from an\noriginal one and they remembered though it was long ago. In the endless\ncellular generations since conception, in the continual microscopic\ndeath and rebirth that constitutes the life process, the cells had\nchanged much--but in extremity the change was not irreversible.\n\nHere a nerve began to fatten its stringy length; it was the beginning\nof what was later to become a long missing gland. Elsewhere a muscle\nseemed to encyst, adhering to another stray cell, changing both of\nthem, working toward the definite goal.\n\nFrom the brink the body turned and began the slow march toward health.\nWhat was missing it learned to replace and what could not be replaced\nit found substitutes for. Cell by cell, with organs and tissues and\nnerves, the body had fought its own great battle--and won.\n\n\"Spontaneous reconstruction,\" commented the doctor, touching the\nforehead of the patient he had not been able to help, merely observe.\n\"It begins where our artificial regenerative processes leave off. I\nthink--oh never mind. There's a lot of development to be done and I\ndon't want to promise anybody something I can't deliver.\" He eyed\nDocchi's armless body speculatively.\n\nWebber came in, noisily clanking his mechanical arm and leg. \"Heard the\ngood news,\" he said cheerfully. \"Finished my work so I came over.\" He\nglanced admiringly at Maureen. \"Say, I didn't remember she looked like\nthat.\"\n\nShe was a pleasant sight and not merely because she'd fought off death.\nHer lips were full and color was returning to her face and the shape\nunder the sheets was provocatively curved.\n\n\"Tomorrow or the next day she can leave the hospital for a few hours,\"\nsaid Cameron. \"The new functions are growing stronger by the minute.\nNow she needs to get out after the long confinement.\"\n\n\"I'll volunteer to take her for a walk,\" said Webber.\n\n\"You will not,\" said Jeriann. \"For the next few weeks she sees only\nwomen. Physiologically she's sound again but mentally she's still the\ncomplete female. You'll visit her when she's normal but not before.\"\n\n\"Guess I'll have to wait,\" said Webber, but he looked pleased.\n\nShe lingered outside while Webber left, seeking an opportunity to talk\nto Docchi. \"I wanted to see you,\" she said as soon as they were alone.\n\n\"Any time. You know where I'll be.\"\n\n\"I know, and always working too.\"\n\n\"It's got to be done,\" he said doggedly.\n\n\"Sure. I know. I'll come over when I can.\" But she wouldn't, not until\nhe gave her some encouragement. He had not forgiven the scene in the\nlab. Cameron called then and she went inside to her patient.\n\nDocchi went back to gravity center, thoughts crowding through his\nmind. Little victories, though the life or death of a woman was not\ninsignificant, were achieved without much effort. But that which meant\nsomething to everyone on the asteroid was more difficult. Where, in\nrelation to their own position, was the ship that was striving to reach\nthe Centauri group before they did?\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\"I'm cold,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Put on more clothes,\" said Docchi grimly.\n\n\"That's not a nice thing to say to a girl with a figure as pretty as\nhers,\" said Anti.\n\n\"She can go to hydroponics,\" suggested Jordan. \"It's warmer there and\nwe've had to allow lights.\"\n\n\"But it's a lot smaller than it was and too many have crowded in. I\ndon't want to be crushed,\" said Jeriann. She wouldn't have left even if\nit hadn't been true.\n\n\"Have to cut down,\" said Anti. \"Meanwhile, what do we eat? Synthetics.\"\nShe snorted.\n\n\"Synthetics are pure,\" said Jordan. His enthusiasm was less than it had\nbeen. A steady diet had begun to alter his opinion.\n\n\"Pure what?\" said Anti, but received no reply. She looked over the\ncircle huddled around the scanner. Nona was curled near Cameron,\nsleeping peacefully. Docchi leaned forward with uncomfortable\nintensity. Jeriann was beside him but he didn't seem to notice her.\n\"How long does this go on?\" said Anti. \"I'm getting tired of freezing\nin the dark.\" Actually she didn't mind it; cold that would kill others\nstill bothered her hardly at all.\n\n\"Until we know,\" said Docchi. \"All the way to Centauri if it takes that\nlong.\"\n\n\"How can we know?\"\n\n\"We'll find out as soon as we measure relative speeds,\" answered\nDocchi. \"The scanner is similar to radar but it uses gravity, which\nmakes things rather difficult. We can't send out an impulse and see how\nlong it takes to get back because it travels instantaneously as far as\nwe're concerned.\"\n\n\"Then there isn't any way? They seem to know how fast we're going.\"\n\n\"Better astronomical equipment,\" said Docchi. \"We're a bigger object\nand they were able to measure our light shift, until we stopped\nilluminating the whole dome.\"\n\n\"And now they can't tell because they can seldom see us?\"\n\n\"The contrary, if they're on their toes. They should guess that we're\nputting most of the power into the drive.\"\n\n\"Then how can we find out?\" said Anti.\n\n\"Triangulation,\" said Docchi. \"When we first saw them it was from the\nfront. In past weeks they've crept up until they're nearly broadside.\nNow I hope they'll drop back. It may take weeks to tell, especially if\nour speeds are almost evenly matched.\"\n\n\"And if we don't gain?\"\n\n\"With our power?\" interrupted Jordan, ceasing to tune the scanner.\n\"But, all right, we don't gain. We'll get there first because we're\nstill a little ahead of them.\n\n\"If there are no aliens there's no question of interstellar law.\nThey'll have to hunt us down over an entire planet and maybe blast us\noff. I don't think sentiment will let them actually harm us. If there\nare aliens, what are they going to do? We've told our story first.\"\n\nThe asteroid seemed to leap ahead as all but the most necessary\nfunctions were curtailed and additional power was channeled into\nthe drive. There was no sense of motion, merely of tension as the\nunmistakable vibration increased. In the darkness through the darkness\nthey hurtled. Sleeping or waking Docchi remained near the scanner, as\nif his presence would somehow cause the ship to recede. It didn't.\n\nAcross the silence the race went on intently. Weeks passed and Anti\nwalked with increased assurance as her weight diminished and her\nstrength grew greater. Maureen recovered and was released from the\nhospital. She disappeared frequently, mostly with Webber, and no one\nquestioned where they went.\n\nJeriann came when she could get away from her hospital work. She came\nat night because it was usually night now though occasionally lights\nwere turned on for short periods and warmth was allowed to filter\nthrough the dome. They couldn't risk killing the plants on which they\ndepended for part of their oxygen supply.\n\n\"Good thing you're here,\" said Docchi once when she entered. \"I want\nyou to make some adjustments.\" She followed him to the next room where\nthe former librarian was now the command unit presiding over their\ndestiny.\n\n\"There,\" he said gloomily as she changed a number of settings slightly.\n\"That's as good as I can do.\"\n\n\"How good is it?\"\n\n\"Faster than we've gone before. I don't know the exact speed.\"\n\n\"Faster than with Nona?\"\n\n\"I think so. Of course I don't know what she could have gotten out of\nit if she'd tried--but she always seemed to hold something back.\"\n\nShe would rather not have asked but the answer was on his face. \"But\nit's not good enough?\"\n\nHe sat down near the command unit. \"They found out what we were doing\nand increased their own speed. It's slightly greater than ours.\"\n\n\"Well, why do we do it?\" she said. \"It takes more and more power to add\nanother mile per second as we approach the speed of light. But that\nholds true for them too.\"\n\nHe tried to frown away the problem she posed. \"Sure, but it doesn't\nmatter to them as long as they can match anything we do.\"\n\n\"But they'd just as soon not. They're inconvenienced the same as we\nare when they have to divert too much power. They're better organized\nand it's not so bad, but still they have to do without their ordinary\ncomforts. I don't see any point in tormenting ourselves. Let's turn on\nthe lights and warm up the place. They'll do the same when they see it.\"\n\n\"Maybe they will,\" he said grudgingly. He was not going to accept her\nadvice.\n\nShe tried again. \"Will the scanner reach Earth?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Not quite. The range is limited. I can't give you\nfigures but I estimate we're well over halfway to the Centauris.\" He\ngot up and paced in front of the command unit. \"I know what you're\nthinking--the appeal to the people of Earth. We tried it once. You know\nwhere it got us.\"\n\nHe had turned and didn't notice her. \"I wasn't thinking of that at\nall. I was wondering how close we are. We might get in touch with the\naliens.\"\n\nHe whirled around. \"Say that again. Did you really say that?\"\n\n\"Of course there may not _be_ any aliens,\" murmured Jeriann.\n\n\"Doesn't matter, or I don't think it does. I'll have to figure it out,\nbut I'm sure it will figure.\" His face flashed once. \"Get Jordan, will\nyou? I'll be at the scanner.\"\n\nGravity center was virtually a shaft that extended underground toward\nthe center of the asteroid. At the bottom, shielded and reshielded,\nsealed off and impregnable, was the nuclear pile. Nearly half way down\na horizontal shaft branched off, leading to the gravity coils which\nwere anchored to solid rock.\n\nMuch higher, near the surface, were the gravity computers. Physical\naccess to them was equally difficult. There were connections so that\nelectrical impulses could reach them, otherwise the command unit could\nnot have directed them, have taken over the control. But in every other\nrespect they were isolated and remote.\n\nIt narrowed Jeriann's search that there were places she didn't have to\nlook. Nevertheless she passed him twice, going up and down, before she\nsaw him curled up inconspicuously beside a machine whose function she\ndidn't know.\n\n\"Now what does he want?\" grumbled Jordan, rubbing his eyes. \"He won't\nrest and he won't let anyone else get a few minutes sleep.\"\n\n\"He's hardest on you,\" she said. \"You're his hands. He wants you to\noperate the scanner.\"\n\n\"Well, his hands are getting mighty tired,\" growled Jordan. But his\nsleepiness disappeared and he followed swiftly after her.\n\nDocchi was standing at the scanner, his face furrowed as if thought\nalone would move dials. He inclined his head toward the image. \"Take\nthe ship off,\" he said impatiently. \"I've hypnotized myself with it. We\ndon't need to keep staring at it.\"\n\nThe ship vanished. \"Now what?\"\n\n\"They'll beat us to the stars. Let them. We don't have to be first. A\nplanet of our own will do.\" Doubt and hope struggled for Docchi's face\nand Jeriann couldn't say which won. \"Explore the Centauri system,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Both of them?\"\n\n\"The nearest one first. After that we'll see.\"\n\nA bright star slid to the center of the scanner. It flickered and\nthen grew brighter, blazing out as they visually approached it. They\nwere within a few million miles as the solar prominences lashed out\nblindingly. Jeriann could feel the heat. For the first time in weeks\nshe was warm. \"Cut the focus,\" called Docchi. \"You'll burn out the\nscanner.\"\n\nThe sun softened and dimmed but remained where it was as the strength\nof the field was reduced. Jordan awaited instructions.\n\n\"Now that I'm sure we can reach it, we'll get the asteroid back to\nnormal. Later we'll resume exploration,\" said Docchi. He started toward\nthe command unit to make alterations and then saw that, though Jordan\nwas following him, Jeriann wasn't. \"Can't you stay?\" he asked.\n\nShe indicated the empty belt. \"I used my last absorption capsule.\"\n\nShe had no right to be happy merely because he was less brusque than\nusual. On her way home a facsimile of sunshine began blazing down from\nthe dome. The grass was crisp and sere but it would revive.\n\nThe race didn't end because the ship and asteroid were no longer\nconstantly accelerating. Whatever the general thought of it and however\nhe modified his own plans, as far as the accidentals were concerned the\nemphasis had merely shifted. Exploration. It didn't matter who got to\nthe system first--it was who found the inhabited or inhabitable planets.\n\nThe ship had slightly more speed even when, by mutual consent, both cut\nthe strength of the drive. Slowly it pulled level and then began to\ncreep ahead. But the scanner nullified the advantage. The astronomical\nequipment of the ship, superior though it was, was not adequate to\nobserve the planets in detail from this distance. Before the ship could\nlocate planets and catalogue the characteristics it would ultimately\nhave to slow down and waste days or weeks searching the specks of light\nto decide which were worth closer investigation.\n\nWith the mass sensitive scanner there was no such problem. Six planets\nfor Alpha and seven for Proxima with, for a while, the possibility that\none or two more might be on the far side of the respective suns. Within\nweeks, relative to the asteroid, much longer for stationary objects,\nthat possibility was eliminated. Six and seven planets there were and\nno more.\n\nIn one respect the scanner wasn't perfect. Nona was shown where it\nfailed to perform satisfactorily and, after looking it over with mild\ncuriosity, took it completely apart, altering a number of circuits.\nWhen she reassembled it again it had exactly the same limitations.\n\nJordan switched it on and brought the planet in focus. He changed the\ndial setting and the image blurred, scattering a coruscating rainbow of\nbrilliant light. Once again he patiently adjusted the dials and the\nplanet returned to normal. \"That's as close as we can get,\" he said.\n\"I'd estimate about fifty thousand miles out.\"\n\n\"Try the fourth planet, the Saturn type,\" suggested Docchi.\n\nMinus rings but with several satellites a large planet replaced the\nsmaller one they had been looking at. After vainly trying to get closer\nJordan gave his opinion. \"A hundred and fifty thousand miles from the\nsurface. This thing's mass sensitive, that's all--proportional to the\nmass. It won't resolve an image close to the surface of a planet.\nNotice that we couldn't get nearer than a few million miles of the\nsun--but we could slide right into a little thing like a ship.\"\n\nReluctantly Docchi nodded. \"We'll have to be satisfied with it as it\nis. Nevertheless I think it can be made to approach the surface of any\nmass, even the sun.\"\n\n\"Nona couldn't do it,\" said Jordan.\n\nDocchi smiled. \"I think she's more interested in her husband at the\nmoment. Besides, what did she have to work with? Odds and ends of\nparts that really aren't suited for what they have to do. It would be\ndifferent if she had an unlimited supply of gravity generating parts,\nor could get what she needs made to order.\"\n\n\"What you want is a whole new science,\" said Jordan.\n\n\"Why not? We've got the beginning of it,\" said Docchi.\n\nMeanwhile the search went on. Each planet was scrutinized as closely\nas the scanner would allow. The images were photographed, enlarged\nand studied, pored over by everyone who could show some experience in\ntopographical work. Two inhabitable planets were discovered, one in\neach star system.\n\nIt was somewhat disappointing that there was no trace of an alien\ncivilization on either world or on any of the planets.\n\nJeriann looked up from the photograph. \"I can't see anything. Clouds.\nNothing but clouds.\"\n\nJordan shrugged. \"Methane probably. It was the best I could get. What\ndo you want to see?\"\n\n\"I think we should get a good look at the surface before we rule out\naliens.\"\n\n\"Still after the aliens.\" Docchi smiled tolerantly. \"You'll have to\nwait till the next system, or the next.\"\n\n\"I think she wants to find them because it's one of the reasons normals\ndidn't want us to go.\"\n\n\"A little,\" confessed Jeriann. \"They refused us because of what aliens\nmight think when they saw us.\"\n\n\"Ever reflect it's exactly what they might think?\"\n\nJeriann was startled and before she could reply Jordan produced another\nargument. \"We're better off without them. Where would we be if those\ntwo planets were settled, spilling over with strange creatures that\ncould outthink us without untwining their tails?\"\n\nJeriann flushed. \"You're teasing me because I don't know much about\nastronomy. You're not very good inside a medical lab.\" She stared hard\nat the photograph. \"I still think you're wrong to conclude there aren't\nany aliens just because they don't show up on planets we can live on.\"\n\nJordan rested his huge hand on the disc of the planet she was studying.\n\"Ever hear of Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus?\"\n\n\"I'm not that ignorant.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean you were,\" said Jordan. \"But man's actually landed on\ntwo of those planets and though we haven't got to Jupiter we have sent\ndown a little remote controlled ship. There's _nothing_ on all three\nof the big planets, not even microscopic life. The latest theory is\nthat there's some kind of life over most of the universe but that\nintelligence will have to show up under conditions similar to those\nthat evolved us. Of course we're willing to be convinced, but----\"\n\nHe crumpled the photograph. \"Nevertheless I'll try to get a better\npicture of the Alpha Centauri version of Saturn.\"\n\n\"Stop quarreling,\" said Anti. \"I think it's nice that there are two\nplanets, neither of which has anyone to lay prior claim to it. Which\none shall we take?\"\n\n\"I'll take the Proxima planet,\" said Jordan as he went back to the\nscanner.\n\n\"Do we have to choose now?\" asked Jeriann.\n\n\"We should,\" said Docchi. \"The advantage we have is very small; we have\nto exploit it. Ideally we ought not to decelerate until the last minute\nand at the end of that period we should find ourselves in a perfect\nthousand mile orbit around the planet.\" He glanced at the model of the\nsystem they'd constructed. \"Myself, I'm for the second Alpha planet.\"\n\nAnti snorted. \"That thing? It's nothing but a hotter edition of Mars.\"\n\n\"Mars isn't bad, Anti. People live on it. Besides, it isn't Mars. It's\nhotter, warmer than Earth in fact. Dry, but there are two small oceans\nand several mountain chains and on the shady side of the hills there\nseem to be trees. We can live comfortably there.\"\n\n\"I thought of something else,\" said Jeriann. \"They'll head straight for\nthe planet that will support the biggest population. Let them have the\nprize--we don't need it.\"\n\n\"I had that in mind,\" said Docchi. \"It will give us more time to get\nsafely established. Once we're on, there's nothing much they can do.\"\n\nThe deceleration began soon and went off smoothly. In less than a\nsubjective year since they left Earth they entered the Alpha system.\nBut they were not the first humans to arrive. The official expedition\nin the Star Victory preceded them by several days. The difference was\nthat the accidentals knew exactly where they were going and actually\narrived at the planet while the other ship was still cautiously\ninvestigating the outer orbits.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Anti as they gathered by the scanner,\ndiscussing it. \"In principle we're responsible for what they've done.\nThey can have the glory. What we came for was a place to live in peace.\"\n\n\"And we'll get it,\" said Docchi. In the last few weeks his uneasiness,\nnever very deep, had come to the surface. The knowledge of how narrow a\nmargin they had was frightening.\n\nOutside the planet filled the dome. It was actually quite small but it\nwas close and covered most of the sky. Now that they were near they\ncould see that only superficially did it resemble Mars. There were\nmountains and several large streams and it wasn't as barren as at first\nthey had thought.\n\n\"I wish I could land, or we could go closer,\" said Anti.\n\nThere was no answer for that. Anti's personal null gravity field would\nfunction only so long as it was in contact with the gravity computer,\nwhich in effect it was an extension of. She wasn't yet strong enough to\nstand on the surface of their new home. As for the other, the asteroid\nwas quite large and it wasn't advisable to risk a nearer approach.\n\nWebber came in, grinning hugely and rattling his arm and leg more than\nnecessary. \"The first load's on. When do we peel off?\"\n\n\"Whenever you're ready. The rocket dome is on automatic. Take off and\nit'll open for you.\"\n\n\"It's safe to leave?\"\n\n\"If you're the rocket pilot you say you are. It's an ordinary landing.\nThe scouts the general left us are in fair condition.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me. I meant, will the expedition interfere?\"\n\n\"Last time we checked the ship was nosing around the outer planets.\"\n\n\"Good stupid old Judd. It's nice that we can depend on him to proceed\nwith the utmost of military caution--and arrive at his goal too late.\"\n\nIt was not quite fair to the general, who was shrewd enough when it\ncame to things he had been trained to deal with. From the military\nstandpoint he had to check every possibility before going on to the\nnext. He was the official representative of the entire solar system\nand he did not dare act as hastily as the accidentals could. His\nresponsibilities held him back. But there were other times in which\nunimaginative obedience to higher authority would carry the day.\n\n\"Be careful,\" warned Docchi. \"Don't let anyone go out until the air and\nsoil and water have been tested and retested and approved.\"\n\n\"The doctor thinks we can handle any virus, bacteria, parasite, or\nanything else you can name that shows up. It's not the first strange\nworld man has landed on.\"\n\n\"This is not the solar system,\" said Docchi. \"You may have to restrain\nCameron if he's overly anxious to show Nona what the new world is like.\"\n\n\"For that reason you----\" Webber stopped, glancing away from Docchi's\nface. \"It's too bad you can't go. You ought to have some first to your\nname.\"\n\n\"Don't concern yourself. I'll get there one of these days. Somebody's\ngot to be up here at this end.\"\n\n\"And I'll make certain nothing goes wrong down there.\" Webber shifted\nuncomfortably but the mood didn't last. \"I'll be back in a week for the\nnext load. Once we get settled things will speed up.\"\n\n\"We'll be waiting,\" called Jordan as Webber left.\n\nThere was tension before the rocket lifted and sluiced through the\ndome locks. It didn't abate as the swatch of light flared across the\ndarkness and faded against the bright illumination of the planetary\ndisc. It was only when they were able to observe the successful landing\non the selected site and the radio response came in. \"All clear. A bit\nshaken up on the way down but no damage except to my ego. I think I got\nall the rusty rocketry out of my system. We're waiting while tests come\nin. We'll let you know before we go out.\"\n\n\"Now I can breathe,\" said Anti. \"A place of our own. Just let the\ngeneral come and try to take us off.\"\n\n\"Why not? He has weapons, which we don't. There's nothing to stop him\nfrom landing down there and capturing them. I won't feel safe until we\nhave a real settlement going and can defend it. And then I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"Now, Jeriann,\" admonished Anti.\n\n\"They'll obey their own laws,\" said Docchi. \"Planets outside the solar\nsystem that aren't claimed by others belong to those who first settle\nthem. They passed that long ago as an incentive to interstellar travel.\nThe moment we landed we became independent. To molest us now would be a\nclear violation of everything they believe in.\"\n\n\"I hope you're right,\" said Jeriann. \"I hope you are.\"\n\nAnti was gazing out the window at the arch of the dome, through which\nshe could see the edge of the planet, ruddy, with a small sparkling\ngreen and gold ocean turned toward them. She got to her feet. \"I'm\ngoing outside and see the world before it slips away. I was wrong. It's\nnot like Mars. Much prettier.\"\n\nDocchi was busy for a moment as Anti and Jordan left and when the work\nwas finished and he turned around he saw that Jeriann had remained with\nhim. Without realizing what she was doing she was fingering the empty\nspaces on her belt. It wasn't conspicuous but like him she wore her\ninfirmity on the outside where everyone could see.\n\n\"I'm sorry you couldn't go first,\" she said, touching the one remaining\ncapsule.\n\n\"First or later isn't important. But why not be sorry you weren't\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Well, there are things to be done and oh, I don't know.\"\n\nShe was disturbed for some reason he could not guess. The sight of\ntheir world seemed to upset her as much as it did him, but with\ndifferent effects. \"It's the same with me. But now the worst is over.\"\nDocchi sat motionless. \"Jeriann.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Once I said I'd come to see you when I could.\"\n\n\"You promised, but you never came.\"\n\n\"The promise was to myself. I can come to see you now. Am I still\ninvited?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask a question like that?\" said Jeriann. \"You know, don't\nyou? You know what I'll say.\"\n\nFirst they registered and then they left the Hall of Records, walking\nslowly, watching the planet roll over the dome, disappearing by\ndegrees. It was out of sight, the last patch vanishing as they reached\nher dwelling. And inside, where time was waiting everywhere, the\nremainder of it on the floor, peering down from the ceiling and ticking\nwith soft persistence in the walls, they quite forgot time for a while.\n\nThey slept dreamlessly. It was nearly morning before he became restless\nand awakened. It was not the rhythmical noises that were intended to\nkeep her informed of the schedule that bothered him.\n\nHe lay there and tried to determine where the sound came from. He could\nfeel her body next to his, warm and wonderful. He couldn't get back to\nsleep and he couldn't ignore what was happening.\n\nHe moved and touched her. She was quivering. \"Are you laughing or\ncrying?\" he whispered.\n\n\"I can't cry so I've got to be laughing,\" she answered. \"It's funny. I\nwas lying here thinking about it. I suppose I can cook. I don't know.\nIt's been a long time.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" He chuckled. \"Don't give it another thought. I\nunderstand how you feel about it.\"\n\n\"Do you? I don't think so.\" She squirmed closer and put her arms\naround him \"That's what's so funny. There's no food here and nothing to\ncook it on. Not only that, there never will be. You've got yourself a\nprize woman.\"\n\n\"I think so too. I'm satisfied,\" he said. \"Can't you feel my arms\naround you?\"\n\nShe would never be able to convince him that she could.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nNow that Cameron was gone there was much more to be done in the\nhospital. Jeriann rushed to get through but small errors plagued her,\nnullifying a good part of her work. Finally she forced herself to be\nmore careful, checking the biologicals with extreme caution.\n\n\"I hear,\" said Maureen, sauntering in, \"the nuptials were informal,\ncatch as catch can.\"\n\n\"No ceremony,\" said Jeriann. \"We stopped in and registered and went on\nto my place.\"\n\n\"What's the difference as long as you're sure of him,\" said Maureen.\n\n\"I'm not. I'm sure of me.\"\n\nMaureen looked at her critically. \"In your case it's good enough,\" she\nsaid with a trace of envy as she leaned against the machine.\n\n\"Don't,\" said Jeriann sharply. \"This thing is an art, not a science.\nThe heat of your hand will alter the product.\"\n\n\"Well, all right,\" said Maureen crossly. \"If I had something worthwhile\nto do I wouldn't be so nervous.\"\n\n\"I think it can be arranged,\" said Jeriann, smiling. \"How would you\nlike to be a colonist?\"\n\n\"On the next ship? Maybe.\"\n\n\"It would be exciting. Also you'd be near Webber.\" Jeriann made a\ndelicate adjustment.\n\n\"I haven't made up my mind about him,\" said Maureen airily. \"He's\nvirile though.\"\n\n\"He clanks a lot, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"At least he doesn't pretend he's carrying the world on his shoulders\nwithout any----\" Maureen stopped. \"I guess I shouldn't say that in\nfront of you.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't,\" agreed Jeriann. \"Nowhere I'll be apt to hear it. Now\nwhy don't you see Jordan about getting on the next ship?\"\n\nAfter that the work went smoothly and she soon found she'd completed\nthe day's quota and part of the next. She continued longer until she\nhad tomorrow free. They had the whole day off to do what they liked, if\nshe could persuade him to rest. She was humming when she went out and\nit was clear evening and there was a beautiful silver fleck in the sky.\n\nOnly it was not beautiful because it was a ship--and it was not their\nship.\n\nAnd neither was it the Star Victory. She'd watched it so often on the\nscanner that every line of it was etched in her mind.\n\nShe hurried to gravity center, every step an effort. Why couldn't they\nhave been discovered later? She would have preferred an alien ship,\nanything to this. Where had it come from?\n\nJordan was waiting at the entrance. \"I knew you'd be here. You saw the\nscout?\"\n\nIt was simple if she had thought about it. The Star Victory was large\nand carried auxiliary landing craft. \"When did it come?\"\n\n\"Less than an hour ago. Go on in. I'll wait for Anti.\"\n\nDocchi was leaning against the command unit. The telescreen on the\nopposite wall was glowing but there was nothing on it except harsh\nwhite glare. \"I tried to get you at the hospital as soon as they\nstopped talking. You'd just left.\"\n\n\"They didn't call until they got close?\"\n\nA smile had died on his face and the corpse of it was still there.\n\"They nailed us dead. We should have had someone checking on the\nscanner. It works turned away from the planet. I guess it wouldn't have\ndone any good though--there was just too much space to cover. First\nthing we knew they were on the telescreen. Jordan went outside, and\nthere they were.\"\n\nShe was thinking of the people on the planet. The asteroid couldn't\nabandon them. She hoped the scout didn't know how vulnerable they\nwere. \"What did they say?\"\n\n\"The general sent an urgent message. He asked us not to land on this or\nany other planet.\"\n\n\"He _asked_ us?\" The general was accustomed to commanding.\n\nHis face was illuminated with the weak radiance of his veins. \"I didn't\ntell them we _had_ landed and I don't think they observed it.\" He\nstopped to recall what she said and the effort was painful. \"Oh yes,\nthe general asked us. Below the cloud banks he discovered an alien\ncivilization on the Saturn type planet and is negotiating with them.\nNaturally they'd regard it as a hostile act on the part of mankind if\nwe occupied a planet in their system without first asking.\"\n\nJeriann touched the absorption capsules without feeling them. \"Aliens!\"\n\n\"You were right, though you had no right to be. Not that it would\nhave made any difference what we thought. As long as the general was\ncruising around the planet we wouldn't have dared investigate.\"\n\nIt didn't pay to generalize on what they learned from one planet, in\none system. When man had journeyed throughout the galaxy there would\nstill be surprises waiting for him when he came to the other side. \"Let\nthe expedition worry about hostile acts,\" said Jeriann. \"If the aliens\nbreak off negotiations, so much the better for us.\"\n\n\"You forget we didn't come solely for ourselves. We hoped to make\nourselves useful to mankind. What kind of disservice is that, to\nembroil humanity in a war with the first aliens we meet?\" His face was\nflaring and white and the smile gone.\n\n\"Don't,\" whispered Jeriann. \"I'm afraid of lightning--yours most of\nall. I expect to hear thunder and be struck dead.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"We have a right to think of ourselves but not\nexclusively of ourselves.\"\n\n\"I mean, do they care? If they live on that planet they can't\nwant this. They couldn't survive under such different conditions.\nAstronomical observations must be difficult with so many clouds and\nwithout space travel are we sure the aliens even know about this world?\"\n\nHe blinked wearily. \"We took a chance. We had to. They have space\ntravel. The general wouldn't be so anxious not to offend them if they\nwere inferior to our own civilization.\"\n\n\"But we didn't see their ships.\"\n\n\"Again we weren't looking in the right place. There's nothing in this\nsystem they travel to. But there is a comparable planet in Proxima, and\nin recent months they've been on opposite sides of the respective suns.\nThey wait for more favorable positions.\"\n\nIt was not luck that had favored the general. Theory said there should\nbe intelligent life in the Centauri system and it further indicated\nthat it would be found on an Earth type planet. It was half correct,\nand the wrong half had fallen against the accidentals. Stubbornly\ninsisting on following the plan laid down by his superiors, the general\nhad won. \"What are we going to do?\" said Jeriann. \"There are hostages\ndown there.\"\n\n\"We'll get them back,\" said Docchi. \"Nobody can stop us.\"\n\n\"Can we? Their ships are faster than ours.\"\n\n\"They can't use their speed close to a planet. And the expedition\nwon't be aggressive in someone else's backyard. We can't land without\nbreaking up the asteroid but we'll go near enough so they won't be able\nto intercept our ship.\"\n\nIt was a daring maneuver. The bulk of the asteroid could be used to\ncut off any attempt to overtake their returning ship. \"There's Roche's\nlimit,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Doesn't apply. We're not a simple planetoidal mass. We'll clamp the\nheaviest gravity we're capable of and, barring something unforeseen, we\ncan hold the crust together at a distance of ten to twenty miles of the\nsurface.\"\n\nShe understood; they'd take the risk if necessary but it ought to be\navoided, because it was a risk. Nobody knew what solid tides would be\nset in the crust of the asteroid as the result of an external gravity\nfield.\n\n\"And then what?\" she said. \"We get them back and then what?\" Her hands\nwere heavy. The silver mote overhead, shining in the light of Alpha,\nwas implacable.\n\n\"What else is there?\" said Docchi with an attempt at cheerfulness.\n\"We'll get them back, every person, and then we'll go on. To the next\nstar and the next, and if we have to, the one after that. Somewhere\nwe'll find a place.\"\n\nJeriann touched him wonderingly. \"I love you for saying that. I love\nyou anyway, but particularly for saying that.\"\n\nHe seemed to shrink, flaming where she touched him, fiery fingertips on\nhis face. \"You know?\" he said dully.\n\n\"Yes. For quite a while now. Anti suspects too. I think we all do. This\nwas our last chance, wasn't it?\"\n\nHe couldn't look at her. \"We shouldn't have stopped. The next star\nsurely would have been the place.\"\n\n\"Place,\" said Jeriann. \"It wasn't your fault. Why do you suppose we\nwere so eager to agree with you? We knew the longer we went on the more\nwe were at a disadvantage.\"\n\nIt was so drearily obvious that nearly everyone had some inkling of\nthe truth. The Star Victory was not the only ship of its class; some\nwere rusting in the spaceyards and some were in use as interplanetary\nfreighters. And if the Star Victory could be converted easily, why not\nthe others?\n\nA new drive to replace the obsolete one? Order it and with a little\nswitching around in the manufacturing plants, diverting it from other\nuses, it was delivered tomorrow and completely installed the day after\nthat. The command unit the accidentals had labored so long to alter?\nEvery dinky little office had as good and in many cases all that was\nrequired was changing the information spools. And thousands of crews\nwere available, already trained, used to working together. It wouldn't\nbe hard to recruit them and add a few officers at the top and a staff\nof linguists and scientists.\n\nNona had given them the one thing they needed and now mankind was\nexploding into space. There was no end in sight. The whole neighboring\nsphere of space that enveloped the solar system was due for immediate\nexploration.\n\nAnd the accidentals hadn't been forgotten. They were not the objective,\nwealth was: planets to be claimed and occupied or mined, civilizations\nto be contacted with whom products and techniques and entire new\nsciences could be exchanged.\n\nIf they were lucky enough to get away from the Centauri system at the\nnext star they'd find other ships waiting, doing business with the\nnatives, if there were any; if not, establishing firm little colonies\non everything that was capable of supporting human life. They were\nsurrounded, overwhelmed by numbers. It was no wonder the general\nhadn't been perturbed at the failure of his plan to land unnoticed on\nthe asteroid. He knew what had been slow in occurring to them. For them\nthere was no next star.\n\nDocchi gazed in sick defeat at Jeriann. There was no need to talk.\nThere was nothing to say.\n\nThe asteroid was rolling toward twilight as Anti came in. \"What are we\ndoing about those insolent pirates? They have no jurisdiction here. We\nought to aim the asteroid at them. We can smash them.\" She saw their\nfaces and the words stopped. \"I was hoping--but I guess we can't hide\nit among ourselves,\" she said.\n\n\"It's no use,\" said Docchi heavily. \"We'll have to go down and take\nthem off the planet.\"\n\n\"How will they know? We can't get a beam down with a whole planet in\nthe way,\" said Anti. \"Let's wait till morning so we can tell them to be\nready.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Docchi indecisively.\n\n\"None of us know anything,\" said Anti fiercely. \"Go home and get some\nsleep. We'll think of something by morning.\"\n\nAfter they were gone Anti went outside. Looking up she could see the\nscout, still visible, glistening in the light of Alpha. It was much\nbrighter than the stars that had been watching them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCameron tried to be detached and objective. \"Do they know we're here?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. They'd have been upset if they had any idea.\"\n\n\"Seems likely,\" agreed the doctor. \"We left as they were approaching.\nBut we took off from the face nearest the planet and they came in from\nthe opposite side. The asteroid acted as a screen.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" agreed Docchi with indifference. \"How soon can you be\nready?\"\n\n\"Do we have to come up immediately?\"\n\nDocchi shrugged. \"I can shove the scout out of the way. I don't know\nwhat will happen if and when the Star Victory gets here.\"\n\n\"It's too big to maneuver close to the surface of the planet.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But it carries other scouts it can launch.\"\n\nCameron grimaced. \"Two or three fast little ships would be difficult to\nbrush away. But do we have to let them get close?\"\n\n\"How can we stop them? Better come up while you can.\"\n\nCameron was fighting it, not recognizing the odds. \"The scanner will\nwork, won't it?\" questioned the doctor.\n\n\"Turned away from the planet, yes.\"\n\n\"That's what I meant. Keep it trained on the alien world. If the Star\nVictory comes out of the clouds and heads this way you'll know it in\nplenty of time to scoop us up.\"\n\nIt could be done but why jeopardize themselves further? He wanted to\nrefuse but Jeriann was pressing close to him, whispering. \"Do you have\nany reason for wanting to stay?\" he asked reluctantly.\n\n\"You see right through me, don't you?\" said Cameron. \"No, there's no\nreal reason except this, Nona's interested in this world and wants to\nstay.\"\n\nIt was as valid as anything else he could have said. That they had come\nso far, if only to fail at the final step, was due almost entirely\nto her efforts. She deserved some reward, though it was only the\nsatisfaction of mild curiosity. \"Wait,\" he said suspiciously. \"Are you\nsure you know _what_ she wants? We're sometimes able to tell her what\nwe want, but never the other way around.\"\n\n\"But I know----\" The doctor stopped and looked at him wildly, his face\nflooded with sudden exaltation which gradually faded. \"I do know,\" he\nsaid at last. \"For a moment I thought it was telepathy. But I guess\nnot. I'm not a computer.\" He glanced out of the viewport at a world\nthey couldn't see.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing it to my attention, Docchi,\" he said when he\nfaced them again. \"It's just interest. For the first time she has\nsomeone she wants to understand--me--and a world outside she longs to\nvisit. The combination is strong enough to stimulate her mind--and\nshe's bright enough to learn anything she decides she has to.\"\n\nCameron rubbed his hand across his face and he was tired too. \"Let us\nstay here as long as you can without endangering yourselves. I want\nto work with her under these surroundings. I think now, looking back\nat the way she's behaved these last few days, I can make a start at\nteaching her to read.\"\n\n\"It must be a lovely place if she likes it so well,\" said Jeriann.\n\"Maybe you can turn the screen of your ship so we can see what it's\nlike outside.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Docchi hoarsely. \"Don't waste time taking apart the ship.\nGet busy with her, teach her what you can. Take her outside if it's\nsafe, but don't go far. We may call suddenly.\" He lowered his voice as\nhe went on talking and at the end was no louder than usual.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Cameron. \"Don't worry about us. Something may come\nout of it.\"\n\n\"It's worse for them,\" said Jeriann when the screen darkened. \"They've\nseen it and then they'll have to come back. It won't be anything we'll\nhave to shove deep in our memories.\"\n\nHe didn't know. He didn't know at all. \"I need your help,\" he said,\ngoing into the scanner room. Under his direction Jeriann made\nadjustments and brought the alien world in view. Cloud swathed and\nmysterious, a strange civilization hidden under the impenetrable\natmosphere, it rolled on through space.\n\n\"We'll take turns,\" he said. \"The minute anything bright comes up we'll\nget busy.\"\n\n\"I hate them,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The aliens. If it weren't for them we'd have a clear claim on the\nplanet.\"\n\n\"But they didn't do anything,\" he said. \"They're merely protecting\ntheir own interests. We'd do the same.\" Nevertheless he hated the\naliens too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeriann was shaking him. She had to shout before he started and woke\nup. \"They've left,\" she said. \"We've got to hurry.\"\n\nHe was tired and didn't want to move. It was very unimportant. \"Are you\nsure it was the Star Victory you saw? It may have been a satellite.\"\n\n\"It was the ship--at least it was using rockets.\"\n\nHe got out of bed and let her help him dress. Usually he refused her\naid. \"Rockets? But the Star Victory doesn't have any.\" Of course it\ndid; it was part of the obsolete equipment that hadn't been removed\nbecause there wasn't time. Besides, it was an excellent reverse source\nof propulsion.\n\n\"I don't care. That's what I saw,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Where are Jordan and Anti?\"\n\n\"I've called them. They'll be there.\"\n\nHe finished dressing and they hurried to the scanner. There was no\nmistake; it was the ship, but there was no bright tail behind. They\nwere using the gravity drive. He watched it grimly.\n\n\"But they were,\" said Jeriann. \"There's nothing wrong with my eyesight.\nThey were using rockets.\"\n\nHe withheld comment. Rockets weren't nearly as efficient as the gravity\ndrive, particularly near a large planet. Yet Jeriann said she saw it.\nHe hoped she hadn't.\n\nAnti and Jordan came in almost simultaneously and joined the vigil.\nMinutes passed in silence and then the brief orange flower blossomed\nagain.\n\n\"See,\" said Jeriann.\n\n\"Now why are they doing that?\" growled Jordan. \"They were doing fine\nwithout it.\"\n\n\"Maybe they need more speed,\" suggested Anti.\n\nJordan grunted. \"Wouldn't add ten per cent.\"\n\n\"But if they needed ten per cent, if they were in trouble----\"\n\n\"They are in trouble,\" said Jeriann. \"It's a signal.\"\n\nThis was a version he could accept--if there weren't better\nexplanations. Swiftly Docchi made mental approximations. \"At the rate\nthey're going they'll be here in half a day. They can't reach us with\ntheir telescreen until they're nearly here. Shall we go inside and see\nwhat's wrong with them?\"\n\nThey looked at each other, and looked, until Anti answered. \"What's a\nfew minutes?\" she said. \"We've plenty of time to pick up our people. We\ncan be gone before they get close.\"\n\nCould they? That was what he didn't know. Taking an asteroid near the\nsurface of a planet had never been tried and there were no rules.\nHe'd have to feel it out as he went along, ready to turn away at the\nfirst indication of overload. Docchi looked at Jeriann, who nodded\nimperceptibly.\n\n\"I think we're in agreement,\" said Jordan, touching the dials.\n\nGeneral Judd was waiting for them. \"There you are,\" he said\nenigmatically. \"I hoped you'd understand.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we don't. You'll have to explain.\"\n\n\"Still the old flamethrower, I see,\" said the general brusquely.\n\"Mainly I wanted to make sure you didn't run when you saw us coming.\nMy psychologists assured me you'd be a sucker for anything that looked\nlike distress. I've got new respect for them.\" He chuckled.\n\n\"Now that we've been suckered, as you so kindly put it, please tell us\nwhat you want.\"\n\n\"I'm coming to----\" The general's face reddened and his eyes bulged\nand he started coughing. The air wheezed stranglingly in and out of\nhis lungs until finally he was able to control the spasm. He grabbed\na tissue and wiped his face with it. \"Designs are no good,\" he said.\n\"Ship, spacesuits, everything. Meant to hold pressure from the inside\nand down there it's in the other direction--and it's really pressure.\nGets into everything. Not very much but it fries your lungs. Remember\nthat.\"\n\n\"We will. Get to the point, General.\"\n\nThe general looked at Docchi thoughtfully and seemed satisfied with\nwhat he saw. \"Don't be impatient. What I have to say is complicated and\nyou'll have to get the background. Are you interested?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Anti.\n\n\"Good,\" said the general, not waiting for the others to signify. \"Well,\nwe landed. We went in on the gravity drive and possibly it was a\nmistake but I don't see what else we could have done--rockets wouldn't\nhave held us. Anyway they had their instruments out and we think they\ncould tell what we were using.\"\n\n\"What were they like, the aliens?\" asked Jeriann.\n\nThe general seemed to regard that as unimportant information. He\nglanced appreciatively at Jeriann but ignored her question. \"Funny\nthing. They didn't ask us about our drive and, of course, we didn't\ntell them. As nearly as we can tell they have something like it--about\nin the stage of development ours was a few years ago. Theirs will take\nthem to Proxima because it's relatively close but it's no good beyond\nthat.\" The general thought about what he'd just said. \"Well, their\ndrive wouldn't work at real interstellar distances--which is why they\nhaven't visited us--but unfortunately we must have given them a clue.\nThey know ours works and in no time they'll have it figured out.\"\n\n\"Sort of suspicious, aren't you?\" said Anti.\n\n\"Lord, yes,\" said the general. \"Do you know what land surface their\nplanet has, what a population it will support? Two planets against\nthree, but theirs are so much bigger. It balances off a little that\nwe have a better drive and our reproduction rate can be higher than\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"I take it you didn't tell them about Jupiter and Saturn?\" said Jordan.\n\n\"No point bringing _that_ up,\" said the general, apprehensive at\nthe mere thought. \"Oh they have things we want. Two very attractive\nplanets, and they're wizards at high pressure chemistry and\norganics--you'd expect them to be--but the exchange was hardly worth\nit.\" The general sat motionless, recalling the scenes on that strange\nplanet. \"They _could_ be very dangerous. It was imperative that we\nestablish some sort of friendly contact. Naturally we told them about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Docchi dryly. \"You were four light years from home\nand you weren't dealing with uncivilized natives.\"\n\n\"Nothing derogatory, you understand,\" said the general hastily.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" said Docchi. \"General, some time ago I asked what you\nwanted. Much as we appreciate your friendly conversation--and the\nfriendliness is quite unexpected--unless you can tell us what you're\nafter in the next few minutes we'll have to conclude that your sole\nobjective is to hold us here while you get closer.\"\n\n\"Don't do anything rash,\" said the general, as concerned as Docchi had\never seen him. \"You see it was a stalemate. We were a little afraid\nof them and they didn't trust us and both sides were noncommittal. We\ndidn't show each other a thing. But there had to be a solution.\"\n\n\"General, I warned you.\"\n\n\"Can't you see?\" half-shouted the general, rising up. \"I thought you\nwere smart. We're going home and we may as well unload our surplus\nsupplies. You'll need them. It will be about nine years before anyone\ngets back.\" He shoved the chair aside and concentrated steadily on\nJeriann, the one normal human among them.\n\n\"This is what we decided,\" he said. \"You get the planet for the next\nfifteen or twenty years, longer if they approve. Meanwhile all trade\nbetween us passes through you.\" He jammed his hands in his pockets.\n\"There. Do you accept?\"\n\n\"Do we accept?\" said Anti. \"He asks us.\"\n\n\"I see you do,\" said the general with gloomy satisfaction. \"It was\ntheir suggestion. They want to study you at length to see what makes\nhumans behave. Naturally you'll be keeping _your_ eyes open.\" He\nswallowed and conquered the incipient cough. \"Now if you'll turn off\nthis beastly little gadget and let me have some privacy I'll talk to\nyou when we get there.\"\n\nJordan reached for the scanner but was not quite soon enough. The\ngeneral thought he was alone when he wasn't. \"Those damned butterflies.\nTrillions of them.\" His face twisted.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThey went walking in the night. Stars were out but they didn't notice.\nThey had found a star to belong to and weren't looking for others.\n\"Which one?\" said Jeriann, turning her head.\n\n\"I can't point. Anyway I don't know,\" said Docchi. \"I can get it for\nyou on the scanner.\"\n\nJeriann laughed. \"Never mind. I don't need to see their planet. They'll\ncome soon enough.\"\n\n\"Almost too soon. I keep wondering what they're actually like.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Jeriann. \"I don't even know how big they are. Sure, I\nsaw them on the screen for a short time, but it's not like meeting\nthem. Large butterflies is what I first thought, but the resemblance\nfades as you continue looking. And, what is their size? There was\nnothing familiar to judge them against.\"\n\n\"Wingspread is a better measure,\" said Docchi. \"The general said eight\nfeet but I think he was overly impressed by the flat expanse of their\nbodies.\" In a while he added thoughtfully: \"But it was not their height\nI was thinking of.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Jeriann. She frowned. \"Why did they choose us? They\ncould have had the general's expedition. Instead they asked for us.\nWhy?\"\n\nThey went on in silence, past the acid tank. They looked in. It was\nempty. Now they had better use for the chemicals. \"How is this for a\nreason?\" said Jeriann as they strolled away.\n\n\"Still on the aliens?\"\n\n\"Why not? We've got to learn how they think.\"\n\nDocchi smiled and through the darkness she could see the faint\nluminosity of his lips and where his eyes crinkled. \"We do, but in the\nabsence of anything positive all I can apply is self-interest. And I\ndon't see how they benefit by having us.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Jeriann. \"It's because we're normal.\" She hurried on\nbefore Docchi could protest. \"Don't try to talk me down until I\nexplain. When they contacted us yesterday and said they'd be here in\nabout three weeks, on an official visit, did you notice which one was\nprettiest?\"\n\n\"I figured that much out myself,\" said Docchi. \"At least in the\nbeginning we look very much alike to them, as they do to us. Appearance\ndoesn't count.\"\n\n\"True, but that was not my point. I haven't reached it. When you looked\nat the--uh--butterfly that spoke to you in that high squeaky voice you\nwere wondering how he learned our language so well in such a short\ntime. You were thinking: are they all as smart? Can I trust him?\"\n\n\"We've got to trust them,\" said Docchi grimly. \"We're a long way from\nsupport. And they did ask us to stay.\"\n\n\"But trust all of them, every individual butterfly, under any\ncircumstance? Or just some?\"\n\n\"We're dealing with a government,\" said Docchi. \"We aren't concerned\nwith individuals. There must be deviations in what they're like. Some\nwon't be trustworthy.\" He paused. \"But of course a government is a\nreflection of what its citizens are.\" He paused again, came to a dead\nstop. \"And so, for the aliens, we are average humans.\"\n\n\"That's what I meant,\" said Jeriann. \"A _cross section_ of what\nthey'd find on Earth. But of course they can't go to Earth and see for\nthemselves--not yet. And so they had to make the best choice of what\nwas at hand.\"\n\nThey started walking again and Docchi leaned against her. \"I think\nyou're right. The general's expedition, all specialists and experts,\nincluding the military, who are specialists of another kind, was not a\nrepresentative group. The butterflies could study them forever but they\nwouldn't get a true picture.\n\n\"But they had to know exactly what humans are like, what their\npotentialities are, and how they live together. And so they took us.\"\n\n\"It seems strange,\" said Jeriann, sliding her arm around him. \"Until\nnow I've never thought of us as normal. But even if the aliens\nhad refused both of us and asked for another group of colonists\nthey wouldn't have done as well. Colonists for a special planet\nare specially selected--hardiest, strongest, most aggressive or\ndiscontented--there would always be something to throw them off.\n\n\"But accidents cut across everything, age, intelligence, sex,\noccupation. Name it and it's here. We're the only representative group\nthat ever left Earth or ever will.\"\n\n\"It's odd,\" agreed Docchi. \"But it doesn't match what happens when\nwe meet our first aliens. It's nothing like anyone imagined. Here we\nstand, face to face across the stars. There is no competition for\ninhabitable planets since our definitions are mutually exclusive. But\nwe are afraid; neither side wants war. And so we go ahead cautiously,\nlooking for signs in the other that will reassure us.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jeriann. \"We're being tested. Will we measure up?\"\n\n\"We won't fail. In spite of what we may seem to some of our own people,\nwe're average men and women--and man hasn't stopped climbing upward\nsince that day somebody built the first fire.\"\n\nJeriann squeezed him and they slowed. In their wandering they had come\nto gravity center. They looked at each other and decided to go in.\nJeriann opened the door and there was a light down the hall. They went\nto it and looked in.\n\nJordan was in front of the scanner, scowling at it in fierce\nconcentration. \"I hope those idiots got it down straight,\" he muttered\nback at them.\n\n\"Don't be so concerned. You took it apart for them, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but it doesn't mean I made them understand.\" He wiped his\nforehead. \"However, even if they don't know what it's all about,\nsomebody ought to be able to build another. It'll work if they use a\nlittle sense.\"\n\nDocchi smiled. \"Don't discount what gravity experts know. After they\nget through thinking over the ideas in those circuits they'll doll up\nthe scanner and before you know it they'll have a machine that can\nreach us from Earth.\"\n\n\"That'll be the day,\" said Jordan. \"Let's hope they don't. It's bad\nenough they know we're here--but if they have to look at us too....\" He\nshook his head.\n\n\"You're wrong,\" said Anti, coming in and sitting down. \"Won't be that\nway at all.\" She bent and began rubbing her legs. \"My poor feet. I've\nbeen walking around for the longest time--full weight too.\"\n\n\"Why won't it?\" said Jordan. \"Remember what happened the last time we\ngot in touch with them.\"\n\n\"Not the same people,\" said Anti. \"There were always some, like the\ndoctor, who didn't think we had to be beautiful to talk to us or be\nnear. We'll get more of that kind. They don't _have_ to call unless\nthey want to.\"\n\n\"And last time we weren't anybody, less than a thousand and not an\nimportant person in the lot. Now we're representatives to the Centauri\nsystem.\"\n\n\"Profit,\" said Jordan. \"You think they won't be able to afford to show\ntheir feelings. I wish I could agree. But even with the gravity drive\nthey can't carry much between here and Earth. In the next fifty years\nthe trade that goes out of here won't make one person rich.\"\n\n\"I disagree. Ideas don't weigh much and there'll be lots of those\nflying back and forth. And was there ever anything more valuable?\"\nAnti smiled. \"But there's more. _We_ won't be the same. Only yesterday\nCameron said he saw Nona looking worriedly at a book. It won't be long\nbefore she gets the idea and wham--new books.\"\n\n\"She was never the one who had trouble. Anyway, she'll never speak.\"\n\n\"She doesn't have to as long as she can write--and get some idea of\nwhat we're saying.\"\n\n\"Then she's all right and that will make the doctor happy.\" Jordan was\ndubious. \"But what of us--Docchi, Jeriann, me--the rest?\"\n\nAnti leaned back and slid off her sandals, wriggling her toes in\nvoluptuously and looking at them with wondering pleasure. \"Me? I don't\nplan to dance again, but in a year or so I'll get around. The doctor\nexpects Docchi to have arms in the next three or four years if the\nprinciple he discovered with Maureen works out.\n\n\"And even you, Jordan, may be kicking again, though it will take\nlonger. Say four or five years for you.\"\n\n\"I'll kick,\" scoffed Jordan, but his disbelief wasn't as strong as it\nhad been.\n\n\"Sure you will,\" said Anti. \"It may not be as quick as we expect.\nOf course if we learn anything from interchange of science with the\naliens the time may be shortened. Cameron says they're bound to help us\nadvance, just as we'll aid them. He's cautious though, and doesn't want\nto figure that in until it actually occurs.\"\n\n\"I'll believe it then,\" said Docchi. \"But you didn't mention Jeriann.\nOr do you consider her already normal?\"\n\nAnti frowned at her toes and slipped her feet into the sandals. \"No,\nI don't. She seems to be in nearly perfect health. But don't believe\neverything you see.\"\n\n\"Darling,\" said Jeriann. \"When did I have my last capsule? I don't have\nany with me.\"\n\n\"An hour or so ago.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? My time sense keeps warning me.\"\n\n\"If you think we should let's go and get one.\"\n\n\"She knows,\" said Anti. \"I heard the doctor telling her that her case\nlooked easy but wasn't. She'll be the last.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" called Docchi who scarcely heard what Anti was saying. He\nhurried out into the hall after Jeriann. He was gone a few minutes,\nand when he came back there was a handprint flaming and furious on his\nface.\n\nHe looked at Anti dully. \"I didn't say anything. I told her to wait and\nI'd go with her.\"\n\n\"She can't help it,\" said Anti. \"I thought it was time you knew.\"\n\n\"What is there to know?\" he said bitterly. \"She's upset because she\ncan't eat. Compared to some of us it's merely an inconvenience. I\nresent her childishness.\"\n\n\"It was always there for you to see but you never looked close enough,\"\nsighed Anti. \"How many times has she had to control herself.\"\n\n\"But I never said anything----\"\n\n\"I know what you said,\" answered Anti. \"When she had _her_ accident\nit was a very hot day. She was a young girl and was busy playing and\ndidn't realize how badly she wanted it until she started for the\nfountain. She was struck down before she reached it. Now--what was it\nyou told her?\"\n\n\"A drink,\" he said, staring at Anti in dismay. \"I told her----\"\n\n\"Twenty years of thirst. But you knew there was nothing that is even\nmoist in her house. The shower spouts fine dry particles. And she had\nno pictures that show lakes or rivers. Go find her.\"\n\nWater. It was life because it came before life. There were creatures\nthat could exist quite comfortably without light. There were some that\ndied in the half strength of the sun, to whom the visible spectrum\nand beyond was inimical. There were others that didn't need oxygen,\nanerobic microorganisms which perished in the free atmosphere because\nof the presence of a substance commonly considered necessary for living\nthings.\n\nBut there was nothing that could exist without water. Life on Earth\noriginated there and to it must always return. It was the cradle of\nthe first cell, and the mother too. There were minute cells that lived\nmotionless and free floating in water long before any living thing\nlearned to swim through its droplet universe. Before there were fins\nor hands and feet, eyes to respond to light, and an orifice to eat and\nshape fine noises with--there was water. And any living creature that\nhad a mouth from time to time might refresh its lips with the common\nand precious fluid.\n\nExcept Jeriann.\n\nThe psychotechnicians knew they could condition her and so it had\nbeen done. She could not drink, would not. She would resist if it\nwere forced upon her, struggle until her bones broke. But even the\npsychotechnicians who had created the mental block hadn't completely\ntrusted it. And so a place had been built for her in which she would\nnot be reminded of water, the one thing she never got enough of.\n\nBecause the habit of life was strong and water meant survival. This was\nnot something she imagined. It was buried in the memory of the cells,\ndeeper than any mind, going back to the beginning. Twenty years of\nnever enough.\n\nDocchi stumbled out. It was neither light nor dawn when he found her.\nThe side of the asteroid was turned away from the sun but though the\nplanet was rising brightly and filled much of the sky there were still\ndeep shadows within the dome. \"I've been waiting for you,\" she said\nquietly as he came near. Her face reflected the planet shine.\n\n\"Jeriann,\" he said.\n\n\"Look at it,\" she said.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"But you're looking at me.\" She turned his head toward the planet.\n\"There. If you look closely you can see sunlight sparkling on the\nocean. Isn't it beautiful?\"\n\n\"Someday you'll lie on the beach and let the waves wash over you.\"\n\n\"Someday,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nADDRESS: CENTAURI\n\nby F. L. Wallace\n\n\nImagine, if you can, that Christopher Columbus never existed--that in\nhis place was a fantastic crew of circus freaks. They would be our\nheroes of history as discoverers of the New World. We all would honor\nthe Fat Woman, erect statues to the Human Firefly, perhaps name a\ncontinent after the Half Man-Half Machine. Ridiculous? Preposterous?\nWell, maybe not....\n\nMankind is faced with such a possibility in this unusual science\nfiction novel. In a future age of interplanetary travel new worlds and\nalien races are awaiting discovery and a decision must be made. Who\nwill be the first interstellar explorers--and make the first alien\ncontact?\n\nOn a tiny asteroid between Mars and Jupiter a handful of people seek\nthe honor. They are \"the Accidentals.\" They are pathetic, crippled and\ndeformed humans, half or quarter men and women, fractional organisms\nmasquerading as people. To many they are just \"circus freaks\", but to\nthemselves they are still members of the human race. Their plan is\nsound. The galaxy has long since been conquered and now the distant\nstars await the probing of Earthmen. Yet the stars are very very far\naway and the exploratory trips will be very very long. Ordinary men\nwould find the voyages nearly unbearable. The Accidentals, though, are\nnot ordinary men. The medical skills which have kept them alive have\ngiven them incredible endurance. They are unbelievably tough, nearly\nimmortal. They are the ones who could be the star-flung explorers.\n\nFrom that begins one of the strangest flights to the Stars that mankind\nmay ever see.\n\n\"Science-Fiction at its Best\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Address: Centauri, by F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
