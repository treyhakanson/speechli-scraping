A piker! Jerry\n             Norcriss lived hundreds--all over the Galaxy!\n\n\n\n\n                             ZOOLOGY 2097\n\n    Trial-and-error familiarization with new life-forms is dangerously\n    impractical on a far planet, where the representation of Earth men\n    may be a solitary five-man crew. The loss of even a single man\n    constitutes, in effect, obliteration of one-fifth of that planet's\n    Earth-population. This is the \"why\" of the Space Zoologist.\n\n    The science of Contact came into being as a result of a\n    government-subsidized \"crash\" program in the early seventies,\n    following on the heels of the disastrous second Mars landing.\n\n    The first flight to Mars had been simple in intent. The job of the\n    men on board had been merely to land in one piece and radio the\n    joyous news back to Earth, to take some samplings of soil and air,\n    some photographs and then return to Earth. All this was\n    accomplished without incident.\n\n    It was the second Mars landing that occasioned the discovery of the\n    quilties. These furry beasts, somewhere between marmosets and\n    koalas in appearance save for overall bright orange and green\n    tangles of fur, were found to be friendly, and unanimously adopted\n    by the crew members as mascots and pets. The animals, disarmingly\n    akin to ambulant rag-toys cut from patchwork counterpanes, did\n    indeed deserve the nickname of \"quilties\". They were cuddly,\n    friendly, with sad eyes and mournful squeaky voices that endeared\n    them to all the men on that flight.\n\n    Fortunately, their discovery was radioed back to Earth along with\n    the usual information in that first day's report. There were no\n    subsequent messages.\n\n    Mars Flight Three found the remains of the crew where the quilties\n    had left them.\n\n    On investigation by the ship's doctor, it was found that the\n    biology of the quilty was similar to that of a hornet, and they\n    considered man--as they would anything warm and fleshy--in the\n    relative position of a caterpillar. During the cuddling with the\n    small beasts, minute hairlike spines at the base of the quilties'\n    tails had managed to prick the flesh of the crewmen. By the\n    following morning, the men had been eaten to death from within by\n    the grubs of gestating baby quilties.\n\n    All of this, of course, is common knowledge today. But it is\n    mentioned here solely to demonstrate to you the monumental hazards\n    which an astronaut had to encounter in the days before the\n    discovery of Contact, and the development of the Space Zoologist,\n    without whose training, courage and efforts extra-Terran\n    colonization would be next to impossible.\n\n    \"CONTACT--Its Application and\n    Indigenous Hazards\"\n    by Lt. Commander Lloyd Rayburn,\n    U. S. Naval Space Corps\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLieutenant Jerry Norcriss stood at the edge of the wide green clearing,\nsniffing contentedly of the not-unpleasant air of Arcturus Beta. Three\nhundred yards behind him, crewmen and officers alike labored to unload\nthe equipment necessary for setting up camp for this, their first night\non the planet.\n\nNo one had asked him to lend his strong back to the proceedings. Space\nZoologists were never required to do anything which might sap, even\nslightly, any of their physical energies. Moreover, they were under\noath _not_ to take any orders to the contrary.\n\nNow and then, a hot-shot pilot would feel resentment at the\nzoologist's standoffish position, and take out his feelings with a\nremark like, \"Would you pass the sugar, if you don't think it would\nsprain your wrist, sir?\" Such incidents, if reported back to Earth,\ninevitably resulted in the breaking of the pilot, and his immediate\nremoval from command. It was seldom the zoologist himself who made the\nreport. Any crew member who overheard such statements would make the\nreport as soon as possible, no matter what feelings of loyalty they\nmight otherwise have for the pilot or person who had spoken.\n\nFrom the moment of landing, the lives of every man aboard a ship were\nin the hands of the Space Zoologist.\n\nFrom Captain Daniel Peters, the pilot, down to Ollie Gibbs, the mess\nboy, there was nothing but respect for Jerry Norcriss, and no envy\nwhatsoever for the job he would soon be doing. That is not to say they\nwere on friendly terms with him, either.\n\nIt was the next thing to impossible to call a Space Zoologist \"friend.\"\nEven amongst themselves, the zoologists were distracted, bemused,\nwithdrawn from their surroundings. After their first Contact, they\nnever were able to join in amiable camaraderie with other men. Such\nsocial contact was not forbidden them. It was merely no longer a part\nof their inclination. In their eyes a cool, silvery light shimmered, an\ninner light that marked them for the ultimate adventurers they were. No\nperson would ever suffice them. They lived only for the job they did.\nWithout it, few lived longer than a terrestrial year. Even with it,\nthere was often sudden death.\n\nJerry was barely thirty, but his thick shock of hair was almost totally\nwhite and his mouth a firm line which never curled in a smile nor\ntwisted in a frown. At the edge of the clearing, his bronzed flesh\nglowing ruddily in the failing sunset light of Arcturus, he stood and\nwaited. Off in the distance behind him, Daniel Peters started across\nthe clearing from the sunset-red gleaming of the sleek metal spaceship.\n\nHe drew abreast of the solitary figure, and said respectfully, \"All in\nreadiness, sir.\"\n\nThe words reached Jerry as from across a void. He turned slowly to face\nthe other man, focusing his will with the effort it always took just to\nuse his voice.\n\n\"Thank you, Captain,\" he said.\n\nThat was all he said, but as he followed Peters across the clearing\ntoward the scorched circle where the great ship had descended on\nits column of fire, the pilot could not suppress a shudder. Jerry's\nvoice was oddly disconcerting to the nervous system of the listener.\nIt seemed like the \"ghost-voice\" of a medium at a seance. The mind\nthat was Jerry Norcriss was only utilizing a body for the purpose of\nspeaking. It did not actually belong there.\n\nAnd that was true enough. Jerry and the others of his kind no longer\nlived in their bodies. They merely existed there, waiting painfully for\nthe next occasion of Contact.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeside the ship's ladder, hooked to an external power-outlet beneath a\nmetal flap on one towering tailfin, was the couch and the helmet Jerry\nNorcriss would use.\n\nJerry lay back with the ease of long habit and adjusted the\nhelmet-strap beneath his chin, as Peters read to him mechanically.\nThe data came from the translated resum\u00e9 of the roborocket that had\ngathered data on Arcturus Beta for the six months prior to the landing\nof the spaceship.\n\n\"... three uncatalogued species,\" his voice droned on. \"An underground\nlife-pulse in the swamp-lands near the equator; the creature could\nnot be spotted from the air.... A basically feline creature, also\nnear the equator, but in a desert region, metabolism unknown.... And\npulses of intelligent life, and of some unfamiliar lower animal life,\non the northern seas.... All other life-forms on the planet conform to\npreviously discovered patterns, and can be dealt with in the prescribed\nmanners.\"\n\nA small section of Jerry Norcriss's mind found itself mildly amused,\nas always, by this bit of formality. The outlining of the planetary\nreconnaissance to a Space Zoologist was mere protocol, a holdover from\nthe ancient custom of briefing a man who was about to undergo a mission\nof importance. Vainly did the zoologists try to convince authority\nthat this briefing was futile. A man in Contact was no longer a man.\nHe _was_ the creature whose mind he inhabited, save for a miniscule\nremnant of personal identity. His job was to Learn the creature from\nthe inside out. As his mind, off in the alien body, Learned, the\ninformation was relayed via the Contact helmet to an electronic brain\non the ship, to be later translated into code-cards for the roborockets.\n\nMan's expansion throughout the universe was progressing faster than his\nmind could memorize or categorize.\n\nThe roborockets obviated his need to learn. For every known kind of\nalien-species problem, there was a solution. The scannerbeams of the\nrocket would sense each life-form over which they passed, in the\nrocket's six-month orbit about the planet. If all species conformed to\nalready known types, then a signal would fly by ultrawave across the\nvoid to Earth, declaring the planet fit for immediate colonization. But\nif new species were encountered, the beam to Earth carried a hurried\ncall to the Naval Space Corps, with a request for the next available\nzoologist.\n\nZoologists spent their Earthside time at Corps Headquarters, in the\nComprehension Chamber. There, with the millions of index-cards at\nfingertip control, they lay back upon their couches and learned,\nthrough dream-like vicarious playbacks, about the species Contacted\nby their confreres. Any Space Zoologist with even five years' service\nhad more accumulated knowledge in his brain than any dozen ordinary\nzoologists. And more intimate knowledge, too. A man who has _been_ an\nanimal has infinitely more knowledge of that animal than a man who has\nmerely dissected one.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Jerry lay there, letting his ears record the voice of the pilot but\nclosing his conscious mind to the import of the words. It never did\nany good to know that the creature you were about to be was unknown.\nAnd no comment on what sort of animal it _might_ be could be half so\ninformative as actually _being_ what it was.\n\nJerry repressed an urge to fidget. This was almost the worst part of\nContact: The wait, while the senseless briefing took place. Soon enough\nhe would know more of the species under observation than could be held\non ten reams of briefing-sheets. Soon enough he would be sent, for an\nirreducible forty minutes, into the mind of each of the creatures to be\nlearned.\n\nThe irreducible time-extent of Contact was its primary hazard.\nWhen the Contact helmet had been developed, it had been found\nthat approximately forty minutes--forty-point-oh-three minutes,\nto be exact--had to be spent in the creature's mind. No amount of\nredesigning, fiddling or tinkering could change that time. The\nZoologist could spend neither more nor less than that amount in a\ncreature's mind.\n\nSince all creatures have natural enemies, Contact called for more than\nsimply curling up and relaxing inside the alien mind. The zoologist's\nhost-alien might have a metabolism which called for it to drink a pint\nof water every fifteen minutes or shrivel. In which case the zoologist\nwould shrivel with it, his punishment for not sufficiently Learning his\nhost.\n\nThis, then, was the reason those irreducible forty minutes were a\nhazard. Should the creature being Contacted die, the zoologist died\nwith it. There was no avoiding death if it came to the inhabited\ncreature. A good zoologist Learned fast, or perished. Which is why\nthere is no such thing as a bad Space Zoologist. You're either a good\none or a dead one.\n\nPeters' voice came to a halt and he closed the plastic folder over the\nbriefing-sheet.\n\n\"That's about the size of it, sir,\" he said. \"We've focused the\nContact-beams toward the indicated areas and made a final check of all\nthe wiring, tubes and power-sources.\"\n\nJerry sighed contentedly and shut his eyes.\n\n\"Whenever you're ready, then, Captain,\" he whispered, and relaxed his\nbody in preparation for his first Contact. His mind and imagination\ntoyed a moment with brief fancies about his forthcoming existences in\nswamp, desert and sea, then he pushed the thoughts away and let his\nmind go empty.\n\nFaintly, he heard Peters calling an order to the technician within the\nspaceship--\n\nThen silent lightning flashed across his consciousness.\n\n\nII\n\nHe opened his eyes. Six eyes. In two rows of three eyes each.\n\nHe did not, however, see six images. The widespread belief in the\nmultitudinous images seen by the faceted eyes of a housefly had been\ndebunked the first time a helmeted biochemist had intruded upon\nthat insect's puny brain. As with human eyes, the images were fused\ninto a whole when they reached the mind. Save for the disconcerting\nsensation of possessing a horizontal and vertical peripheral vision of\napproximately three hundred degrees sight was comfortably normal.\n\nJerry looked over his surroundings and noted one slightly annoying\nside-effect of his hexafocal outlook. As a human will see--as when\nlooking at the tip of a pencil pointed at the face--two images at\nthe far end of any object looked upon, so Jerry, while able to zero\nin anywhere he chose, could see six ghost-images corresponding in\ntheir angle of perspective to the positions of his six eyes. Had he\na pencil-tip to stare at, it would have appeared, beyond the tip, to\nbe vaguely like a badminton bird seen head on, with images of the\npencil-body comprising the \"feathers.\"\n\nA few moments of glancing about soon took care of the primary\nirritation of this unfamiliar sensation, and Jerry began to study his\nsurroundings carefully.\n\nHe was inside a circular cavity of some sort, facing toward brightness\nat the opening ahead of him. The walls of the cavity were dark,\nsandy-smooth and slightly moist, so he reasoned he was in some sort of\nburrow in the soil. Beyond the opening, there was light and warmth and\na hint of greenery which his host's eyes could not bring into sharp\nfocus.\n\n\"I wish I knew my size,\" he thought. \"Am I some small insect awaiting\na victim, or a rabbit-souled mammal hiding from a predator, or a\nlion-sized carnivore sleeping off a heavy meal?\"\n\nAttempts to turn his head for a look at his host's body availed him\nnothing. Jerry relaxed for a moment, and tried to sense his body by\n_feel_. He had, he knew in a moment, no neck. Head and torso were a\none-piece unit, or at least inflexibly joined.\n\nCarefully, Jerry moved his right \"hand\" out before his face for a\nlook. He saw a thin, flesh-covered bony limb, with a double \"elbow,\"\nterminating in a semicircular pad which seemed suited for nothing but\nsupport. No claw, talon or digit on the pad; just a tesselated rubbery\nbottom, the tesselations apparently acting as treads do on a tire.\n\n\"Whatever I am,\" Jerry sighed, \"I'm non-skid.\" He considered a moment,\nthen added, \"I can't be an insect, then. Insects can't rely on weight\nto keep them rightside up, and need gripping mechanisms. Okay,\ninsect-size is out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry extended the pad before him and cautiously leaned his weight on\nit, then removed it back beneath his torso and studied the earth where\nit had rested. There was a concavity there, corresponding to the pad.\nIt was not especially deep.\n\n\"Well, that lets out elephant-size,\" he reasoned, \"and most oversize\nforms. I must be somewhere between a mouse and a middle-sized wolf.\nBut _what_ am I?\"\n\nJerry tried breathing. Nothing happened; there was no sense of dilation\nanywhere in his body. \"Odd,\" he thought. \"Unless I get oxygen--or\nwhatever gases this creature breathes--through my food.... Or maybe I\nhave air-tubes like an insect's.... No, I'd have to shift my body now\nand then for air circulation, and I feel no discomfort remaining still.\nBesides, I have flesh, and that tube arrangement only functions well in\na body with an endoskeleton. Must be dependent on food intake, then.\nStores its oxygen or whatever.\"\n\nHe extended the tesselated pad, and rubbed it cautiously against\nthe soil. There was a dim sensation of touch in the pad. But it was\nsubordinate to a soma-centric sense of location. His pad \"knew\" where\nit was in relation to his body, but had no great tactile capacity for\nhis surroundings. \"Well,\" Jerry thought, \"that lets out _feeling_ my\nbody to determine shape or function.\"\n\nAs it sometimes did when he was enhosted, his mind went back to old\nPeters, his instructor, who had taught \"Project C\" to the eager young\nzoologists. Project Contact had been mostly devoted to giving the\nstudent an open mind on metabolism and adaptability to environment. A\nLearner had to be able to reason out--and quickly--the metabolism of\nhis host. It was little use knowing a Terran life-ecology; man lives\non combustibles and oxygen, the oxygen combining with combustibles to\nprovide heat, and plants live on carbon dioxide and water and sunlight,\nrenewing the atmospheric oxygen. So old Peters had always stressed the\nstudent's learning their Basic Combinations.\n\nBasic Combinations prepared the student--or so the school board\nhoped--for a wide variety of chemical relationships between a host and\nits environment. The students had to know what to do to survive should\nthe host, for instance, live in a chlorine atmosphere, and need large\namounts of antimony in its diet for proper combustion and survival.\nThere were a good many chemical elements in the universe; the student\nhad to know how to deal with any combination of them in a host's\nmetabolism.\n\nFor the most part, the instincts of the host would carry a Learner\nthrough the Contact period. A species tended to keep its physical needs\nnot only in its mind, but in its body as well. Mr. Peters had a saying\nhe'd been fond of emphasizing to the students: \"When in doubt, black\nout.\" The saying became a cliche to the student body, but they had the\nsense not to disregard it. A cliche is, after all, only a truth which\nhas become trite because it is vitally necessary to use it often.\n\n\"When in doubt, black out,\" meant simply that if a situation arose\nwhich seemed impossible to handle rationally, the enhosted Learner's\nlast resort was reliance upon the instinctive behavior of the host. The\nonly thing to be done was to pull the mind into a tiny knot bobbing in\nthe host's own brain, and let the host itself, once more in control,\ntake the Learner instinctively to environmental victory. Or defeat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were dangers, of course. A Learner enhosted in a chicken, for\ninstance, would be a fool to trust the chicken's instincts regarding,\nsay, a snake. A chicken confronted by a snake tends to become\nhypnotized by its deadly adversary, and to stand stupidly in place\nuntil it is killed. In cases of that sort, the Learner would be safer\ntaking control and going clucking off to the nearest high ground.\n\nOn the other hand, a Learner inhabiting something with the hairtrigger\ninstincts of a bat would be much better off letting the animal's\ninstincts take over in moments of grave risk, such as flying through\nthe blades of a revolving fan. A bat could get through without\na second thought about those whirling metal scythes, but a man's\nmind could not think fast enough to avoid a grim death by all-over\namputation.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Jerry thought hopefully, \"I've got an _easy_ one.\" It was\npossible, of course. His host might be in the midst of an afternoon\nsiesta, and Jerry could relax and \"sit out\" his forty minutes of\nContact. But such cases were few. At any moment a predator might come\ndown into that orifice in the soil, and Jerry would have to fight\nfor his host's life to preserve his own. Relaxed Learning was seldom\nfeasible.\n\n\"I'd better see what sort of fighting equipment I have,\" he decided,\nwishing vainly that he could just turn his head and look his body over.\nThis proceeding by _feel_ was a slow, tortuous, and sometimes deceptive\nprocess. Hollow fangs that seemed capable of injecting venom into an\nenemy might--as in the case of the Venusian Sea Vampires--turn out to\nbe an organ for drinking water, the sacs above the fangs being for\ndigesting liquids and not for storing poisons.\n\nJerry stimulated what should be his tongue into action, checking for\nthe presence of fangs. Within the mouth of the creature, which felt\nlarge in relation to its head, he sensed a rasping movement, a kind\nof dull dry rustling, but could feel nothing with the tongue itself.\n\"Best have a look at it,\" he decided suddenly, and, opening his jaws,\nextended the tongue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry was distinctly shocked by the thing that skewed and writhed\nforward from beneath his eyes. His sensation was not unlike that of\na man who opens his mouth and finds a snake in it. And Jerry further\nrealized that he was now seeing with another sextet of eyes, at the end\nof the tongue.\n\nHe was not one alien--he was two!\n\nHis primary six eyes took in the pink-and-gray horror extending ahead\nof him. The tongue was almost like another animal, serpentine in\nconstruction, and had two horny--what?--arms?--pincer-jaws?--at either\nside of the \"head\". They were tubular, like a cow's horns, and lay at\neither side of a wide slit-mouth in the tongue itself.\n\nOn impulse, Jerry swiveled the tip of the tongue back upon itself, and\ngazed through the six eyes around the tongue-slit-and-jaws/arms at\nthe main body of his host. Then, suddenly feeling ill, he snapped the\ntongue back into his mouth and shut his jaws.\n\nIt had been a horrible sight. Where he'd expected to see the abdominal\nregion of his host, just behind the thoracic section, there lay a wet,\nred concavity, in the midst of gaping jaws. Jerry himself was enhosted\nin a \"tongue\" of some still larger creature within that soft earthen\nburrow! And some remaining fragment of his host's awareness told him\nthat the creature of whom he was the tongue was itself the tongue of\nyet another creature. He was a segment of some gigantic segmented\nworm-creature whose origin lay who-knows-how-far beneath the earth.\n\nCarefully, stilling a mental feeling akin to _mal de mer_, he\nre-protruded his tongue and looked more carefully at it. Sure enough,\njust behind the \"head\" of the thing were two stubby growths, not yet\nmature. In time, Jerry realized, those growths would develop into a\npair of double-elbowed front \"arms\" with semi-tactile tesselated pads\nat the base, and the curving jaws/arms would drop off or be resorbed,\nwhile that \"tongue\" extended a \"tongue\" of its own.\n\n\"And then what happens to _my_ segment?\" he wondered. \"Do I simply lie\nhere forever with jaws agape?\"\n\nAs he pondered this, there came a movement in the greenery just beyond\nthe burrow orifice. A squiggly thing with an ill-assorted tangle of\nunder-appendages came prancing with almost laughable ill-balance into\nview. Jerry, intent on observing this creature--very like a landbound\njellyfish walking clumsily upon its dangling arms--relaxed his vigil as\nregards control of the host.\n\nBefore he realized it, his jaws were flung wide, and that\nself-determined tongue was leaping for its prey. The horny jaws/arms\nclamped into the viscous body of the passing creature, and the\nslit-mouth extended upper and lower lips like pseudopods to cover the\nwrithing, squealing victim. Then a huge lump appeared in the tongue,\njust behind its \"head.\" Jerry waited with a distinct lack of relish for\nthe still squirming \"meal\" to make its alimentary way back into his own\nesophagous.\n\nHowever, it did not. Just short of his lips, it halted. And after a few\nmoments, it ceased to struggle.\n\nAnnoyed, but uncertain just why he was, Jerry attempted to re-mouth his\ntongue. It did not come back. His jaws lay open wide, and his tongue\nremained where it had shot forward to grasp the tentacled creature.\n\nSomething clicked in Jerry's mind, and he once more tried \"seeing\" out\nof the tongue's six eyes. He found that he still could, but dimly.\n\nIt took him about three seconds to figure out his peril.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe segment behind his own would never re-swallow _his_ segment, which\nhad been its tongue. It couldn't. It was dead. For the time-period in\nwhich his own segment had existed as the third segment's tongue, it had\nsome control over it. It could extend the tongue, and could see through\nthe eyes in the tongue. But then Jerry's segment had fed, had grown,\nand the parent-segment had died, as had its parent-segments before it.\nThe thing, whatever it was, grew fast, too.\n\nThat was the frightening part.\n\nEven while he thought this, he saw that the lump was gone from his\ntongue. But his tongue was twice the size it had been!\n\nRepeated efforts on his part to withdraw it back within his jaws met\nwith failure. Again he tried looking through its eyes, and found his\ntongue-vision even dimmer. Then with a tremor of shock, he realized\nthat his own vision was dimmer, too.\n\nHis host was dying. It was no longer needed to house the tongue.\n\nUp ahead of him, the tongue-part was digging busily with those pincers,\nerecting for itself an extension of the burrow. Like a mole in reverse,\nit did not make a mound by tunneling through the soil, but by lying\natop the soil and erecting itself a circular tunnel in which to await\nvictims.\n\nJerry's mind brought to him a vision of what this section of this\nunknown morass must look like, with miles and miles of curving tunnels,\neach housing a hideous worm-creature, of whom all segments were dead\nexcept the front one, which would in turn be dead as soon as its tongue\nhad fed a bit and grown to mature size.\n\nShivering within his mind, Jerry wondered how much of the forty-minute\nperiod had gone by.\n\nHe had no way of estimating. His personal time-sense was overpowered\nby that of his host. A man within a gnat, with the lifespan of a\nday, would feel subjectively that he had lived a lifetime within it,\nalthough only those same forty minutes would pass by until his return\nto his own body, helmeted upon the couch.\n\nEach new segment might take a day to grow, or it might take a few\nminutes. Jerry could not tell. He could only wait until he was sent to\nhis next Contact. There was no method of self-release from Contact.\nThat was why survival was imperative.\n\nA flicker of movement caught his dimming vision, and he realized that\nhis tongue had snared yet another of the jellyfish-things. The second\nlump was quickly absorbed as he watched, and he found he could no\nlonger make contact at all with the six eyes of the tongue-tip. His own\nsix were blurring, with a rapidity he was able to observe, and he knew\nthat the life of the host could not last very long.\n\nVaguely, he was aware that the stubby growths of his tongue had now\nsprouted into appendages such as his own. The tongue could no longer be\ncalled that, because it was nearly a full-grown segment. Within it, he\nimagined, it was growing a new tongue of its own, the faster to hasten\nits own eventual demise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I've got to stop it,\" he thought. \"But how can I? It won't withdraw,\nno matter how hard I try. And if it would, it's grown too large to fit\ninside my jaws any more, even if I tried cramming it in with these\nstupid pads of mine....\"\n\nHe stopped the pointless line of reasoning and lifted his pair of\ndouble-elbowed \"arms\" before his failing sextet of eyes.\n\n\"They look strong enough, but are they?\"\n\nHe could feel his control slipping. His life would hang upon the\nsuccess or failure of his experiment, but there was no time to try and\nreason out a better attempt at survival.\n\nSwiftly, ignoring the wriggling protests of the segment before his own,\nhe encircled it tightly with those two-jointed \"arms\" and held it tight\nand painfully taut. It was still soft, still relatively raw from its\nrapid growth, and was not equipped to fend off attack from the rear.\nJerry, straining terribly, ignoring the searing pain that licked his\nconsciousness, cruelly and methodically tore out what had been his\ntongue.\n\nThe dripping end of the thing flopped once, then lay still. And Jerry's\nvision, after swimming in gray haze for a moment, coalesced once more\ninto sharp focus and he knew his host was alive again.\n\n\"Whew!\" he gasped, grateful to shut the great jaws once more. \"It'll be\ntough, but I know how to survive, now. My segment's low enough on the\nevolutionary scale to regenerate lost parts; it will grow itself a new\ntongue. If I don't get lifted to a new Contact in the meantime, I'll\nsimply tear _that_ one out, too, and hang on until I get _out_ of this\ndamned thing!\"\n\nThen the segment ahead of him moved, and Jerry knew cold fear.\n\nAt the mouth of the burrow, one of the squiggly jellyfish-things had\ninserted a tentacle into the burrow and was busily ingesting the\ntorn-out segment into a gaping hole in its underside amongst the\nshiny, wiggling arms. Even as he watched, it had completed its meal,\nand with a shiver of gustatory pleasure, readjusted its relative\ndimensions until it was three times its former size.\n\n\"This,\" said Jerry, bitterly, \"is one hell of an ecology. Each creature\nis the other's chief natural enemy!\"\n\nThen his fright grew as he saw that the jellyfish--he could no longer\nthink of it as anything else--was methodically ripping down the walls\nof the burrow, and coming for _him_.\n\nFrantically, Jerry tried getting at the thing with his tongue, but the\nraw stump within his jaws was still in the process of generating a new\nhead-and-eyes part. A mere stub shot forward to wag futilely at the\napproaching enemy.\n\nJerry shot his tesselated pads forward, trying to push and pummel the\nthing away, but the few blows that landed rebounded from that shiny\nbody like pith-balls bouncing from an electrostatic plate.\n\nThen the jellyfish grappled with, and held onto, one of Jerry's arms,\nand began calmly to tuck it into its digestive cavity. If the pad had\nbeen only lightly tactile before, it became supersensitive now, as\nthe creature's digestive juices began to erode it into its component\nchemicals.\n\nJerry felt as if he'd rammed his hand into an open wood fire. He\ntried to scream; nothing emerged between his jaws except that futile\ntongue-stump. The jellyfish, climbing in a leisurely fashion down the\nlimb it was ingesting, flicked out a tentacle and began doing something\nhorrible to Jerry's upper right eye. It sent waves of pain into his\nmind, and almost blotted out all thought, except for a maniac notion\nthat urged Jerry to laugh at the creature's ambition. For its highly\nmaneuverable tentacle-tip was diligently attempting to _unscrew_ the\neye.\n\nJerry's right arm was gone. Tentacles flipped and floundered all about\nhis head-section. The digestive cavity of the jellyfish was widening,\ntrying to take in Jerry's head at a single swallow. He saw, with the\nfive usable eyes remaining, a crystally concavity, the sides glinting\nwith digestive fluid tinted beautiful emerald by the foliage out beyond\nits semi-transparent body. Then the thing closed over his head, and the\nlast of the eyes began to sear and sting.\n\nJerry's mind cried out in anguish ... and lightning flashed across his\nconsciousness. White, silent lightning.\n\nPain ceased.\n\nThe time of Contact had passed.\n\n\nIII\n\nCaptain Daniel Peters paced agitatedly back and forth before the\ncouch holding that still figure in its bulky helmet. The last glow of\nthe sunset had vanished behind the trees around the clearing minutes\nbefore. Peters took three puffs from a just-ignited cigarette, then\ncrushed the white cylinder under his heel.\n\n\"Sir?\" said a man at the airlock of the ship.\n\nPeters looked up swiftly, and identified the speaker as the technician\nfor the Contact mechanism.\n\n\"How's it going?\" he asked, trying to keep his voice matter-of-fact.\n\n\"First report's just come in,\" said the man, with a brief smile.\n\"Information's being coded onto a new card for the roborocket index. I\nguess Norcriss came through the Contact all right. His life-pulse still\nshows on the panel. It was flickering badly for a few minutes, though.\nThink I should terminate?\"\n\nPeters hesitated, then shook his head. \"No, I guess not. They tell me\nthere are no after-effects to even a hazardous Contact. Norcriss'll be\nwanting to get on with it ... poor devil,\" he added, with a wry smile\nthat touched only his lips, didn't reach his eyes. \"Proceed, seaman.\"\n\nThe other man nodded, and vanished within the ship....\n\n\nIV\n\nVast flat fields of sun-bronzed stone stretched in all direction to\nthe horizon, pockmarked with rimless craters, seething with red liquid\nwhich flickered with dusty blue fingers of fire here and there on its\nsurface. Every so often a pale plume of steamy white rose toward the\ncoppery overturned bowl that was the sky.\n\nCautiously Jerry sniffed the air. Sulphur. That was the red liquid\nburning in those many pits: Yellow sulphur melted into gluey scarlet\npools amid the nearly invisible shimmer of its consuming fires.\n\n\"Sulphur doesn't steam,\" Jerry thought idly, still sniffing at the\nfumes. \"So the white plumes mean there is water, or some volatile\nliquid, mingled with the deposits in these pits.\"\n\nAfter a moment, he realized that he was no longer taking random sniffs\nof the fumes, but was actually indulging himself in a regular orgy of\nbreathing. The smell of the sulphur was as strong and piercing as he'd\never known it, but absent was the almost simultaneous effect of raw\nthroat, streaming eyes, and hacking cough.\n\n\"The desert air must be nearly _all_ sulphur gases,\" he realized.\nThat would explain the hue of the sky, and the not-unpleasant silvery\nhaziness of the atmosphere.\n\n\"And I, if I don't keel over in a few more moments, must be a\nsulphur-breathing creature.\"\n\nSunlight, from nearly directly overhead, was warm and comfortable upon\nhis head, back and hindquarters. An unusually flexible feeling in the\ncaudal region of his spine told him that he had a tail, even before\nhe swung his huge head about for a glance at it. The body, as bronzed\nas the rock on which it stood, was something like a lion's, although\nthe taloned feet, from heel to the first leg-joint, were horny and\nrough in appearance. They were not unlike those of a barnyard fowl, if\nconsiderably thicker and decidedly more lethal.\n\nThat, save for a hard-to-see fringe of darker fur that ran up his neck\ntoward where he felt his ears to be, was all of his body that he could\nview.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he mused, \"what my head looks like?\"\n\nA brief turning of the problem in his mind gave him the solution to\nit. It wasn't the best possible way of getting an idea of his latest\ncranial conformations, but--unless there was a looking-glass lying\nabout--it was the only way at hand.\n\nJerry tilted his head until his eyes fell upon his shadow on the brown\nrock beneath him. By tilting it from one side to the other, and joining\nthe various silhouettes in his mind by a simple application of basic\n_gestalt_, he knew what his head looked like.\n\nVery like a lion's, except that it seemed to have no external ear.\nA single slender silhouette that fell from the forehead region,\nstiletto-pointed, must be a sort of horn, unless it deciduated\nperiodically, like a deer's antlers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFurther speculation on his appearance was interrupted by the appearance\nof another creature, trotting like a terrier between the fuming\nsulphur-pits, coming his way.\n\nIt could be a twin to what he now knew he looked like, but it seemed\njust a bit smaller, somehow. And it was carrying something carefully in\nits teeth.\n\n\"Should I run, fight or just ignore it?\" Jerry wondered. \"It doesn't\nseem menacing. But neither does a pekinese till you try to pet it.\"\n\nHe allowed his mind to retreat a fractional bit from control of his\nhost, and watched its reactions to the newcomer. Jerry felt a surge\nof emotion, a sort of fond, proud, doting feeling, and knew that\nthis approaching creature was his cub. \"That's a help,\" he thought,\nrelieved, and resumed control of the animal.\n\nThe cub halted a short distance away, and gently set its burden upon\nthe rock, placing a fore-footful of talons upon the thing before\nletting go with its jaws. Under the talons, the thing moved. Jerry\nsaw that it was a sort of squirrel, except that it had well-developed\nforepaws, the pads of which hinted that it undoubtedly ran\nquadripedally instead of climbing trees. Then the memory of the sort of\nterrain he was in re-crossed his mind, and Jerry felt foolish.\n\nNaturally it didn't climb trees in a region that was devoid of any\nvegetation whatsoever.\n\nJerry noticed that the cub seemed to be waiting for something. He\nwished he could speak. He had the goofy feeling that he was supposed to\nsay, like a man confronted by a bottle of Chateau Neuf in the hopeful\nhands of a wine steward, \"That'll do nicely, thank you.\"\n\nA nod was almost universally a sign of acquiescence, so he tried that\ninstead. The cub seemed pleased, and immediately, by lowering that\nforehead-horn between a pair of the talons enfolding the struggling\nland-squirrel, snuffed out its life with a thrust through its neck.\nThen it removed the talons from its prey, and took a backward step.\n\nApparently, as the sire, Jerry was to get first bite.\n\n\"Now don't go all picayune,\" he cautioned his digestive tract. \"Come\non, Jerry boy. You eat oysters while they're alive. You should be able\nto eat a squirrel when it's dead. Besides, if you like the smell of\nthis lion-creature's atmosphere, you'll probably like the taste of its\nfood. Eat hearty.\"\n\nWith that, Jerry lowered his head and let his sharp teeth snap off\na haunch of the squirrel-thing. He went to chew it, then realized\nthat--unlike his prior Contact's over-equipage--he had no tongue. This\nwas strictly a bolt-your-food host. So he tossed his head back, and\nmanaged, with a spasmodic effort of his thick muscular throat, to get\nthe morsel into his stomach.\n\nThe cub stepped forward then, bit off a chunk for itself and got it\ndown with less apparent effort.\n\n\"Well, he's had more practice at tongueless eating,\" Jerry consoled\nhimself. Then, noting that the cub was standing patiently awaiting\nsomething, he swayed his head from side to side, trying to convey, \"No\nthanks, it's all yours, kid.\"\n\nBut the cub, its head tipped perplexedly to one side, was still\nwatching him, waiting for something, a sort of puzzled anxiety in its\ngaze. Jerry reasoned that if he simply backed off, the cub would take\nthat as a gesture of refusal to eat any more, so he took a few steps\naway from the squirrel-thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the cub, an almost human look of bafflement on its face, gurgled\na whine from its throat. It began to bounce about on its legs like a\nhousebroken dog that very urgently wants out.\n\nJerry thought hard. The frantic desire of the cub for him to do\nsomething was more than mere pettishness on its part. There was real\npanic in its eyes, now. Jerry felt the first thrill of danger. What was\nhe doing wrong? Or what wasn't he doing _right_?\n\nMere after-you-Pop protocol could not explain the glint of fright in\nhis cub's eyes. Or could it?\n\nJerry tried to remain calm and think reasonably. The sire-and-cub\nrelationship was throwing him. Most animals--in the narrow group that\nremained linked by relationship and affection even after the cubs\nmatured--ran along opposite lines. The parent went out and got food for\nthe kids, and not vice-versa. On this planet, apparently, having a cub\nwas the nearest thing to Social Security.\n\n\"Remember, you idiot,\" Jerry snapped at himself, \"this is a species.\nIt is no beast rational mind you are dealing with, but an animal mind.\nThat means that the cub's apparent protocol is instinctive, and not a\nmatter of etiquette. And an instinct has a reason behind it, doesn't\nit? Only man can skip over protocol. You have to do something before\nthe cub feels that it can do it--and whatever it is you're not doing,\nit's driving the cub to distraction. You'd better go for a second\nhelping of squirrel, and fast, or you're going to have your kid in a\nmental institution!\"\n\nNot exactly relishing completing the meal, Jerry stepped back to the\nfurry little corpse on the rock, and only as he came near enough to\nbite into it was he suddenly aware of another odor mingling with that\nof the sulphur fumes. Unbelieving, he stared at the spreading pool\nof putrescence that ringed the remains of his cub's prey. He stared,\nsilent and amazed, as flesh and bone crumbled and dissolved there on\nthe ground, until there was nothing there but the noisome liquid and a\nfew tiny teeth.\n\n\"Incredible!\" thought Jerry. \"To decompose so damned fast! But it\ncertainly explains why Junior brought me that thing still alive and\nkicking. It didn't last more than a few minutes after it died--_Ugh!_\"\n\nThe sickly retch boiled out from his stomach with a painful expansion,\nand he scented the same foul odor on his breath as arose from the\nliquid that now lay drying in the burning sunlight.\n\n\"The damn thing's going rotten _inside_ me!\" he said to himself,\nfeeling the first wave of illness shake him from horn to tail-tip.\n\nHis flesh, beneath its bronze-colored fur, felt suddenly cold and\ngreasy. Jerry knew that feeling well, from one summer when he'd\neaten a sandwich with mayonnaise that had lain too long outside the\nrefrigerator. It was the onset of ptomaine. He and the cub could be\ndead, in a very ugly manner, within less time than he had to await his\nnext Contact. Or was it less time? It was subjective, wasn't it? Maybe\nthis period would be over more quickly than the last one. Or maybe more\nslowly....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry turned to look at the cub. Its eyes were glazing. It was\nbreathing in gasps through its open mouth, staggering as it tried to\nremain on its feet.\n\n\"We're poisoned,\" Jerry groaned. \"And it's not on purpose. That cub\ndidn't trot here with that squirrel just to knock off its old man!\nThere's something else has to be done, something I've overlooked. And\nmy stupidity is killing us.\"\n\nWeakly, almost automatically, Jerry's conscious mind did the only thing\npossible under the circumstances. Cliche of old Peters or not, \"When in\ndoubt, black out\" was the only solution. Jerry swiftly relinquished his\ngrip on the controls, and let the lion-thing take over its own destiny.\n\nThe first thing it did was rush toward the scarlet surface of the\nboiling sulphur pit near the cub. The muscles relaxed and showed no\nsign of relaxing in that flame-bound gallop, and Jerry grabbed at its\nmind and got back in control just as its forefeet stood on the brink of\nthat blue-flaming red pool.\n\n\"Oh, damn!\" he groaned, agonized by both his fear of fire and the\ngrowing discomfort within his stomach. \"Of all the creatures in the\nuniverse, I have to hit one with the lemming-instinct. This damn\nthing's bent on boiling itself alive if I let go. And if I stay in\ncontrol, I die of ptomaine!\"\n\nJerry Norcriss wasted nearly thirty seconds feeling sorry for himself.\nAnd then he remembered something about lemmings. And also something\nabout cubs.\n\nLemmings, those strange little rodents that take it periodically\nin their heads to all go rushing into the ocean and drown, are not\nsuicide-bent. Their ancestry is older than the continent on which they\nlive. At one time the spot wherein they plunge into the ocean was\nlinked with the next continent over. The migration--for that's what it\nis with lemmings--had at one time been perfectly safe. So safe that the\nmigration of the lemmings became instinctive. And, after the continents\nseparated, or the band of land joining them sank beneath the sea, the\nlemmings blithely continued their trek, and perished. Lemmings might\ndie, but the ages-old instinct of the specie wouldn't.\n\nNo animal, Jerry realized, is deliberately self-destructive. No animal\nbut man--who is more than animal, and can decide upon his own destiny\ndespite what his instincts buck for.\n\nAnd cubs, Jerry recalled with chagrin, are not always born knowing\nsurvival-tactics. Some cubs have to be taught how to survive. And this\none is still in the process of learning, and only senses that--since it\nis becoming deathly ill--something is horribly wrong. It wants its sire\nto show it survival, and its sire is in the hands of a nincompoop like\nme....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFortunately for Jerry and the cub, his thoughts on cubs and lemmings\nlasted only a fractional second, so all-inclusive is the mind's\napprehension of a situation.\n\nAnd then Jerry, feeling greatly relieved, let go of the controls\nonce more and let the lion-thing bend and drink from the blazing\nsulphur-pool at its feet.\n\nOf what the host was constructed, Jerry had no idea. Its cell-structure\nmight be high in silicates, or possibly be akin to asbestos. Whatever\nit was, the blazing red sulphur went down its gullet like sweet warm\nwine, and the decaying squirrel-thing was transformed into chemicals\nthat were comfortably digestible.\n\nJerry was glad to see that the cub, standing on shaky legs, was\ndrinking, too. It seemed likely to survive its brush with death.\n\nNot a bad life, he thought. Catch a meal, take a swig of wine and then\njust loaf around in the sun. Nice planet ... if you like sulphur,\nand have a bright-eyed young kid who won't make a move without your\napproval and example--\n\nJerry's ruminations were cut short by a sound of leathery wings, high\nin the coppery sky. Abruptly alert, he lifted his shaggy head and saw\nan ominous formation of Vs in the sky. They grew in size, and became\nthe forms of gigantic airborne things, a cross between the ancient\nTerran pterodactyl and a sort of saber-toothed ape.\n\nSomething told him these approaching things were not friendly.\n\nHe turned his head to the cub, but this, apparently, was a lesson\nalready learned, because all he saw of his scion was a disappearing\nblur of buttocks and tail as the cub scurried in a clumsy gallop across\nthe plains of sunburnt rock. In another instant, Jerry was scurrying\nright after him, for reasons above and beyond Togetherness.\n\nThe paws wouldn't manage right, so he finally dropped back a bit and\nlet the lion-thing's brain take over the job of escape, his own mind\nmerely going along for the ride.\n\n\"But where can we _hide_?\" he wondered, fascinated despite his\nfear. \"Can we pull the hollow reed routine under the surface of a\nsulphur-pit? Or are there caves someplace in the vicinity? Or do we\njust run until either our legs or those simianipters' wings give out?\"\n\nThen his mind got entangled with the purely empirical cogitation about\nthe validity of coining a word like _simianipters_ (which seemed to\nmean \"ape-winged\" when the coinage he desired was \"winged-apes\") and\nhis mind was bouncing so busily between this knotty problem and the\nchances of escape from those creatures and the puzzle of just what\nconstituted safety from the flying things that he barely noticed the\nwhite flash of silent lightning that heralded cessation of Contact.\n\n\nV\n\n\"Contact completed,\" said the technician to Peters, in the purple\ntwilight slowly deepening to black starry night. \"Slight dimming of\nNorcriss's life-pulse this time, not so bad as last time.\"\n\nPeters nodded as he ripped open a fresh packet of cigarettes. \"Machine\nfunctioning properly?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the technician nodded. \"Norcriss could go on at least three\nmore Contacts with the power we have left. Shall I activate him again,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" murmured Peters, his eyes fastened on the pallid face of\nthe young man on the couch....\n\n\nVI\n\nNoise. Footsteps on metal. Metal meant refined ores, and that in turn\nmeant intelligence. Yet he _couldn't_ inhabit an intelligent mind!\n\nJerry opened his eyes and took in the scene before him. His vista was\noddly diverted into vertical panels, and then, as his mind settled into\nfull control, he knew that the panels were spaces between bars.\n\nThe thought crossed his mind that bars must be vertical everywhere\nin the universe. Horizontal ones would hold a prisoner as well, but\nthe origin of bars lay in primitive stockades, stakes plunged into\nthe ground about a prisoner. Primordial tribal habits were not easily\nbroken, even after attainment of civilization.\n\nThrough the bars he saw--well--men. They were at least bipedal, and\nwalked upright, and had two upper limbs with facile digits at the ends,\nall in keeping with the nearly universal rule of bilateral identity.\n\nBeyond that, the resemblance to man ceased.\n\nThe creatures he saw were clothed in satiny uniforms, yet something\nabout the material told him it would hold up under heavy stress.\nWherever their actual bodies showed--head and hands, mostly, though\na man of apparently lesser rank was bared to the waist, working on\na machine set against one wall--they were covered with short (or\ncropped) white down. Jerry could detect on the heads no sign of\nears or nose, but in the midst of the furry expanse of face, tiny\ngreen-glinting beads of jet were eyes, and a thin, wide blue-gray slit\nfurther down was the mouth.\n\nThe hands, he noted with interest, were furred even within the\npalms. Or so he thought until one of the creatures, idly flexing a\nhand, showed Jerry that the fingers bent on double joints in either\ndirection. There were no nails as such, but each digit on those\ndeceptively soft-looking hands terminated in a tapering cone of some\nhard black material, as shiny as the eyes in those coconut-frosted\nfaces.\n\nJerry once more had cause to regret the impossibility of Contact\nwithin a mind of an intelligent creature. Intelligence equated with\nimpenetrability, so far as Contact went. You could learn of an\nintelligent race only so much as their words and gestures and behavior\ncared to let you know.\n\nJerry knew he was in a sea-region, but whether over it, on it, or under\nit--No. The room, so far as he could see, was windowless. It could mean\nthat the vehicle was carrying its own atmosphere, in order to keep the\nriders alive, whether the outside surface of the ship were within\ninimical gases or liquids, or the deadly nothingness between planets.\n\nThen again, he might simply be within a fortress, or below sea-level in\na ship. Jerry gave it up, and concentrated on himself, and his barred\ncontainer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cage was as high as one-fourth the height of any of the men before\nit, so Jerry reckoned his own size as about one-sixth. If they were all\nsix-footers, then he must be about rabbit-sized. He glanced down his\nbody and saw hard gray scales over a curving belly, with a pair of hind\nfeet that seemed to be all phalanges and no metatarsals. From \"heel\" to\nfoot-tip, Jerry had three long, hard-looking black spikes. \"Something\nlike a swan's foot with the webbing removed,\" he mused.\n\nA look at his forepaws before his face showed him three similar\nphalanges, though only two-thirds the length of the hind ones, and\nhaving in addition a sort of stubby rudimentary thumb. His forearms\nwere scaly, too, and possessed a wicked spur of the same black material\njutting downward from the elbow.\n\nHappily, three sides of his cage were polished metal walls, so he was\nable to get an inkling of his facial characteristics in the warped\nuncertain mirror of the surfaces. He saw startled-looking eyes, round\nas quarters, with red irises that dilated greatly with each tilt of\nhis head toward the shadowy rear of the cage, and narrowed the orifice\nabout the pupil to a pinprick when he turned near the front. He seemed\nto be noseless, also. When he tried to sniff, nothing happened. The\nattempt made his head feel stuffed up, but he knew that the feeling was\nonly inside his mind, and not an actual sensation.\n\nJerry looked at his mouth. It was just a wide slit in his round,\nearless head--no, not earless; there were auricular holes under a\nflange of gray scale--just a wide slit with a glint of sharp-pointed\nbright orange teeth.\n\n\"Well,\" he thought, \"I'm at least a carnivore, possibly an omnivore,\nwith teeth like that. The light in this room is apparently not\nintolerable to those fur-faces out there. So--if the slight shooting\npains in my head plus the shutting of the irises when I face into the\nroom are any criteria--I must be a nocturnal beast of some kind. Eyes\nlike this would be blinded by sunlight.\"\n\nHe decided he was, in the ecology of the fur-faces, something along\nthe lines of a raccoon, even if his flesh were scaly as a pangolin's.\n\"Maybe I'm a pet,\" he hoped. \"But there's something about the\natmosphere of this room--\"\n\nSomething rustled and clacked against the wall of his cage.\n\nJerry withdrew his control a fraction to let the host's mind tell him\nwhat it might be. The mind of his host was atingle with antagonism.\nYet, as Jerry heard a similar movement somewhere off to the far side,\nthe mind of his host grew suddenly tender and excited.\n\nJerry re-assumed control, having the information he needed. His\ncage was one of at least three, possibly many more, housing animals\nlike the one enhosting him. The nearby cage contained an animal of\nhis own sex, the other contained an animal of the opposite sex,\npossibly a mate. Whether male or female, Jerry had no idea. He had\nin any Contact--barring a procreative arrangement beyond the simple\nbisexual--a fifty-fifty chance of being male. The worm had been\nself-generating, the unicornate lion-thing had been male. What Jerry's\npresent sex was, he had no idea. Even on Earth, scaly creatures\ntended to baffle all but the experts as to sex. Jerry inspected the\nmind of his host for a few moments, but could find out only that it\nyearned for that other one in the other cage. The intensity of the\nyearning gave no clue if the urge were man-for-woman, woman-for-man,\nmother-for-child, child-for-parent or--it was barely possible--friend\nfor friend.\n\nJerry decided to ignore the yearning by taking full control of the host\nonce more. He took stock of his circumstances. Here he was, a nocturnal\ncarnivore, caged with many of his own kind in a vehicle moving through\nspace or water.\n\nHe was not just there for the ride, that was certain.\n\nBeing delivered somewhere? No, the room beyond the bars looked little\nlike a storage hold. Of course, these fur-faces might have alien ideas\nabout the way a storage hold should look. Still, they seemed to be\nbosses of some kind. There was no mistaking the dressy look of their\nuniforms. A high-ranking officer might go into a storage hold, but it\nwould be for an inspection only, and these creatures were busily doing\nsomething in the center of the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were three of them, discounting the bare-to-the-waist man working\non that odd-looking machine. They stood by some waist-high object--two\nwith their backs to Jerry, one in profile--very intently absorbed in\nsomething on that surface.\n\nJerry twisted his head about, but could make out no relevant details on\nthat surface. \"They could be studying a map laid out on a table,\" he\npondered, curiously. \"Or maybe they are shooting dice at a crap table,\nor--\"\n\nFurther conjecture was suddenly, and horribly, obviated.\n\nThe man at the wall straightened up from his labors and announced\nsomething, unintelligible to Jerry (the voice was an unbroken hum that\nrose and fell in pitch, unarticulated into consonants or vowels), which\nundoubtedly meant, \"She's all fixed.\" The fur-face in profile turned\nwith quick attention and stepped to the machine. He pulled from its\nslot a thing like the cable-supported arm of a small crane terminating\nin a cone-shaped flexible surface, and arranged it over the thing on\nthe table which his movement to the machine had exposed to Jerry's gaze.\n\nThe thing on the table was the face of another of the white-furred men,\nand Jerry suddenly knew that this was an operating room. These men were\ndoctors, involved in surgery.\n\nThe machine, so hastily repaired, was some sort of anesthetizing\ngadget. They'd had to wait for it before proceeding. All this\ninformation Jerry worked out with only a small part of his mind; the\nmajority of his concentration was focused upon the other thing he'd\nseen upon the table, strapped wide-eyed into position beside the\npatient.\n\nIt had scales, sharp orange teeth, and might have been a rabbit-sized\ncross between a raccoon and a pangolin, and the wide eyes were tightly\nirised into discs of coppery red, with no visible pupils, under the\nlight that overhung the operating table.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" Jerry thought, with dismay. \"Surgery?\nIn the same room with cages full of animals? What about sanitation?\nWhat about infection? The doctors are maskless. The room is only\npassably clean--certainly not scoured with green soap, alcohol or live\nsteam. And that repairman is standing beside the table scratching his\nstomach!\"\n\nBewildered, yet drawn to watch with morbid fascination, Jerry ignored\nthe pain that staring into the room brought to his eyes, and gave full\nattention to the proceedings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were--from a raccoon/pangolin's viewpoint--pretty ghastly. The\nmen, muttering to each other as medics the universe over must while\nengaged in surgery, started snipping and plucking and sawing and\nclamping with lackadaisical facility upon the two bodies strapped to\nthe table. One medic concentrated upon the man, the other upon the\nanimal, while the anesthetist merely held the cone lightly upon the\npatient's face, and glanced now and then at dials upon the machine\nproper, as if for reassurance, or possibly to show that they were\nefficient and well-trained.\n\nThey did not trouble to anesthetize the animal.\n\nAs they shifted about in their work, Jerry got a better look at the\npatient. All along his chest and belly, the white fur was gone. From\nthe edges of the empty region, Jerry could see that the fur had been\nscorched away. The surviving fur in the periphery was stunted and\nslightly carbonized. The \"flesh\" beneath that exposed region was\nsmooth, excepting a few blistered spots near the center. It resembled\nthin, flexible green plastic, of the sort that seems to be translucent,\nbut is actually transparent, the darkness of the color tending to make\nit seem opaque unless light could be placed directly behind it. Into\nthis surface went the scalpels and clamps and pins of the medics, until\nthey had a triangular flap lying back to expose the organs within.\n\nJerry, well-versed in all the metabolisms available to the scientists\nof Earth, was completely baffled by this one. None of the internal\norgans was fastened to anything.\n\nThe abdominal hollow of the creature was filled with a clear\nlemon-colored liquid. The organs just floated within the liquid. They\nwere, Jerry noticed with amazement, not even juxtaposed with any sort\nof permanence. Even as the medic reached for them, they bobbed and\nmoved about each other in the yellow fluid, as impermanent of locale as\napples in a rainbarrel.\n\nThen Jerry had it.\n\n\"They're colloidal!\" he gasped within his mind. \"A tough, flexible\nouter shell! The whole thing hollow from cranium to fingertip to\ntoe, containing a liquid that acts as reagent, catalyst, suspensor\nand electrolyte for the mineral crystals, cell globules and chemical\ncoagulates. These fur-faced creatures are nothing more than\nambulant, intelligent hunks of protein! The whole setup's there. The\nlemon-colored fluid is the dispersion medium, and those 'organs'\nthey're lifting out are the disperse-phase. But ... what do they need\nthe raccoon/pangolin for?\"\n\nHis fellow-creature, hissing in agony, was already a glittering, almost\nformless thing under the grisly tools of the medic standing over it.\n\nIt was, Jerry realized, being laid belly-open with no more regard\nthan is given a lobster's tail-muscle by the gourmet with his tiny\nthree-pronged fork.\n\nJerry could only watch and wonder and wait to see the use to which the\nanimal would be put. He had not long to wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce laid open, the animal's internal fluid, a pale gray solution,\nwas sucked out into a bulb-headed tube, much as a housewife gets\nthe turkey-drippings from under the bird for basting. The fluid was\ndribbled into a row of transparent jars with calibrated sides, some\ngetting more, some getting less. Then a drop of liquid--a brown liquid\nfor this one, a red for that one, and so on--was added to each. While\nJerry gazed at the scene, fighting the headache that began to grow\nwith the brightness of the lights over the operating table, the medic\ncaptured each jar and gave it a sharp, practiced shake.\n\nAnd then the whole picture was clear to Jerry.\n\n\"Crystal-clear,\" he said, with bitter humor.\n\nFor that was the answer. The fur-faces were colloidal, the\nraccoon/pangolins were crystalloid. Whatever fluid lay within the\nbellies of the animals, it was a super-saturate, needing but the right\nchemical additive before coming out of its liquid state to form the\nright crystals.\n\nIn each jar, almost instantly after shaking, bright crystals had begun\nto form within the liquid. Within but a few moments, the jars were\nbeing uncapped and the medics, with neat little tongs, were lifting\nthe crystals from the solutions and placing them within the abdominal\ncavity of their anesthetized patient. The flap was fastened down into\nplace with a gadget that seemed to work on the principle of a soldering\niron. As it slid along the angled edges of the incision the sides met\nand fused, leaving only a tiny ridge to attest to the fact of the\noperation.\n\nOne of the medics nodded to the bare-to-the-waist creature still\nstanding by. The man shoved over a wheeled cart, slipped the patient\nonto it and wheeled him out of the room through an archway barely\nwithin Jerry's field of vision.\n\nJerry's main concern, however, was for the fate of the crystalloid\ncreature, lying so still upon the table. One of the medics undid the\nstraps across the body, lifted it by a hind leg and shoved it through\na hinged metal flap against the wall, then stabbed a button....\n\nA red flare went off beyond the still oscillating metal flap, and Jerry\nhad all the information he needed. A nice little incinerator, for\nhollowed-out corpses.\n\n\"I wonder,\" Jerry thought dismally, \"how long my forty minutes will\ntake in _this_ Contact!\" His headache was growing worse, and it wasn't\njust from the lights.\n\nAt that moment, a sudden lurch sent him crashing against the wall of\nthe cage. A clamor of alarm bells began throughout the vessel.\n\nOne of the medics yelled something, and threw a switch against the wall\nopposite that housing the anesthetizing machine. A panel slid away,\nrevealing a large mosaic of close-packed little spheroids. As the medic\ntwisted a dial at the base of this arrangement, some of the spheroids\nbegan to flicker whitely, while others remained dark.\n\nThen Jerry recognized it for what it was. A form of television screen,\ncomposed of individual lights instead of phosphorescing dots activated\nby magnetically guided electrons from a cathode. The effect was the\nsame.\n\nA picture, sharply etched by the alternation and varying intensities of\nthe bulbs, appeared on the mosaic-screen. Across the dream-like surging\nof the black-gray-and-white heavy seas in the foreground, Jerry made\nout an armada of strange-looking vessels coming across the ocean toward\nwherever the pickup camera lay. Unlike Earth-vessels, they tapered\n_inward_ as the sides of the vessels rose from the waters, then were\nabruptly truncated near what would have been a peak by a railinged area\nthat was the deck.\n\n\"Unless I'm much mistaken,\" thought Jerry, grimly, \"I am on a ship\nwhich--be it alone or one of many in a convoy--is about to be attacked\nby those vessels out there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA second later he knew he was right.\n\nFrom the approaching fleet there had come no sign of armament, no flash\nor flame or belch of smoke or blaze of ray, but the room he was in\njolted violently, then canted crazily for a sick moment before righting\nitself. The alarm bells grew louder in their metallic clangor.\n\nFootsteps pounded down the corridor. The bare-to-the-waist man\nor another like him--Jerry could not distinguish between the\ncreatures--came into the room shouting something. The surgeons shouted\nback and then the man raced out again.\n\nAnother jolt made the room tremble, but this time it felt different,\nas though the room were built to take that sort of stress. Jerry\nrecognized that his ship was in the process of firing back, with\nwhatever strange weapons these fur-faces employed. Even as he reasoned\nthis out, one of the enemy vessels on the screen shuddered, split into\nalmost-matching halves and plunged beneath the waves amid much flame\nand confusion.\n\nThe medics were not watching. One of them had moved out of Jerry's view\nand now stepped back into it, carrying the wriggling form of one of\nthe animals from the cages. As Jerry watched, the animal, its orange\nteeth snapping vainly at those hard black fingertips on the medic's\nwhite-furred hands, was lashed to the table in the gray-smeared spot\nwhere its predecessor had perished. Then the bare-chested man was\ncoming back into the room, wheeling a man on a cart. This one was\nmissing fur from an arm and part of the chest area. Jerry was able to\nconfirm his earlier theory that the hollowness of the creatures was\nextended throughout the flexible green body-sheaths.\n\n\"Sonics,\" thought Jerry, all at once. \"They're using sonic rays\non each other. A good dose of heavy infravibration could _ruin_ a\ncollodial creature! The loss of the fur through subsonic friction is\nonly a side-effect. The main damage is the breakdown of those colloid\norgans when the beam focuses on a man.\"\n\nThat would explain the way the other ship had simply sundered.\nArtificially induced metal-fatigue, by the application of controlled\nvibration.\n\n\"Damn,\" thought Jerry, \"this is _dangerous_!\"\n\nOther alien vessels were visible now on that granulated \"screen,\"\nheading away from the camera. At least Jerry's ship was not alone in\nthe face of that armada. His ship was one of at least a dozen--with\nmore, possibly, outside the pickup range of the camera--involved on his\nside of the battle. Some of them shattered silently apart and boiled\ninto the churning waters with a violence so great that Jerry could\n\"feel\" the sound with his eyes.\n\nApparently the medics, while anxious about the course of the fray, did\nnot want their surgical endeavors bothered with the actual noise of\nthe battle. Or perhaps the technology which had evolved this type of\nTV screen had never stumbled upon the familiar-to-Earth methods of\ntransmitting sound by electromagnetic radiation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"How long can forty minutes _last_?\" Jerry wondered in growing concern.\nBy his own time-sense, warped by the lifespan of his host, he felt he'd\nbeen present in that room well over an hour. And still he was captive\nto the environment of the scaly crystalloid raccoon/pangolin creature,\nand doubly imperiled of survival. Even if \"his\" side took the lead in\nthe struggle, many fur-faces would need this treatment--which destroyed\none of his species with each operation.\n\nJerry did not know whether or not the animals were chosen in any\nspecial order. But his mind told him that even were his host the last\nso chosen, his odds for survival were dwindling fast.\n\nAssuming the wall against which his cage was stacked with the others\nwere the same size as the wall opposite his cage--and symmetrical\nconstruction of rooms seemed a strong likelihood--then, judging by his\ncage-size, the maximum number of cages that could be so stacked was six\nhigh and four across, or twenty-four cages. Figuring one animal per\ncage, that left some twenty-one animals ahead of him.\n\nPossibly--barely possibly--this tier of cages might _not_ be against a\nwall. It might be the forefront of hundreds of rows of similar stacked\ncages. But no medic hurrying to save a life would walk to Row #2 when\nRow #1 was still undepleted.\n\n\"So if I just sit here,\" he thought, gloomily, \"I'm bound to end up\nalongside a fur-face on that table. My life gone so that his may\nsurvive. 'It is a far, far better thing I do' and so on, but I don't\nknow as I'm ready to lay down my life for a fur-face without even being\ngiven the _choice_, damn it! Let's figure a way _out_ of this mess!\"\n\nThe ship went _whooomp_, suddenly. The room gave a crazy tilt again\nbefore--rather sluggishly, Jerry noted with alarm--righting itself. At\nthe same moment the TV screen blanked out.\n\n\"Well, there goes the camera,\" he thought, his insides feeling oddly\ncold and upset. \"That may mean that if I don't die on the operating\ntable, I may well be forced to succumb to a watery grave. Damn! _When_\nwill those forty minutes be _up_?\"\n\nHe was jerked from his thoughts by the appearance of a huge\nwhite-furred hand fumbling with the catch on his cage.\n\nHard, pointed black fingertips reached in through the opened door for\nhim. Jerry snapped and clacked his teeth upon them in vain, as he was\ncarried toward the strap-sided concavity beside a new fur-scorched\npatient on the operating table.\n\n\"Use your head!\" he screamed at himself. \"These fur-faces aren't\nexpecting an _intelligent_ attack from a lab-animal! The other\ncrystalloid creatures have the paltry instinctive self-preservation\nmechanism to bite at the objects gripping them, those impervious black\nfingertips. But you know better, right?\"\n\nAnd with that thought, Jerry tilted his head just a bit further\nforward, and let his orange fangs crackle through the thin chitinous\ngreen \"flesh\" beneath the stiff white fur on the alien's wrist....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYellow dispersion-medium spurted with a satisfactory gush from the\nscalloped gap in the alien's forearm.\n\nJerry landed nimbly on his hind feet on the metal floor as the\nshrieking medic dashed to a confrere for whatever first aid is given\nwhen a colloidal creature's liquid contents are spilling out.\n\nWhile a minor part of his mind wondered idly if they'd employ a\ntourniquet or just a cork, the rest of his mind concentrated on\ndirecting those fore-paw-and-foot phalanges to carry him swiftly up\nthe face of the stacked cages. There were twenty-four of them, all\nright, against the wall. He perched precariously on the top, in the\ncage-roof-to-ceiling space that was too small for another layer of the\nsame.\n\nAs the fur-face medic fiddled around with the wrist of the man Jerry\nhad bitten (it was the raccoon/pangolin medic, of course), the\nanesthetist dragged a small stool over to the base of the stacked cages\nand began climbing up after him.\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" thought Jerry, cowering weakly against the wall. \"If I had\na piece of chalk or a charcoal stick I could write something. Or draw\na picture, maybe, on the ceiling. Then they'd know I was intelligent,\nand--They'd probably use me anyhow. The middle of a battle is no time\nfor writing learned scientific papers about new zoological 'finds.'\"\n\nThose black fingertips were coming for him, too carefully for a repeat\nwrist-crunching performance. If he were taken this time the bearer\nwould handle with care.\n\nJerry skittered and scrabbled for the corner near the\nwall, hoping to engage the anesthetist in a game of\nyou-climb-up-at-_this_-point-and-I-run-back-to-_that_-point. But the\nfur-face had too long a reach to make it practical. As Jerry cowered\nhelplessly, those black fingertips gripped him about the throat with\nstrangling force. It apparently made no difference if he died on the\ntop of the cages or under the scalpel. He could only fend feebly with\nhis paws at the creature as he was lifted down to the table and set\ninto the concavity, dizzy and sick.\n\n\"White lightning?\" he begged. \"Come on, white lightning! Please, test,\nbe over. How long can forty minutes _last_?\"\n\nThen the room gave a horrible shudder and all the lights went out.\n\nJerry, not yet strapped in place, heard the cries of the medics, and\nthen the terrifying sound of rushing seas in the invisible corridor\nas the room canted swiftly onto its side. This time it did not right\nitself. A thick, falling-elevator feeling bunched up inside Jerry. He\nknew that the warship was plunging beneath the heaving surge outside.\n\nHe scrambled about on the floor--no, it was the wall now--almost\nbrained by the crashing bulk of the operating table. He kept jumping\nfutilely upward, hoping somehow to escape to the corridor and get\noutside the ship before all that water got inside this room.\n\nThen icy tons of fluid crashed down upon him, flattening him against\nthe wall beneath his feet. The cries of the medics were suddenly\ngurgles, then a brief, faintly heard sound of bubbling.\n\nJerry, trying to swim against the swirling pressures of the flood that\nnow lifted him from against the wall and spun him end over end, could\nhold his breath no longer.\n\nIn despair, he felt his jaws widen and take in the chill liquid in\nwhich he was whirled.\n\nIt went in without gagging him, and did not come out. Not through his\nmouth, at any rate. It came out through long slots just in front of\nthose auricular vents in his head.\n\nGills! Jerry was an amphibian.\n\nWebbing, hitherto folded away, appeared on his feet. \"I'll be damned,\"\nhe sighed, with weary relief.\n\nThen he paddled determinedly about in the utter blackness until he\nfound a cage lying on its side, the door sprung open. Jerry got inside,\nclosed the door until it caught as well as its broken catch would allow\nand settled himself for a nice wait.\n\n\"At least I won't have to worry about getting gobbled by a natural\nunderwater enemy,\" he figured.\n\nHe had to wait another subjective hour before the silent flash of\nwhite lightning lifted him out of his third, and last, Contact on\nArcturus Beta.\n\n\nVII\n\n\"All right, sir?\" asked Peters, removing the bulky helmet with care.\n\nJerry sat up and nodded, blinking his eyes as he adjusted to his body\nonce more. He was hard-pressed not to start testing his own joints and\nlungs and limbs for knowledge, and had to forcibly remind himself that\nthis frail shell was his \"normal\" body.\n\nNow to await the technician's analysis of the data.\n\nJerry, waving off Peters' hand, outstretched in automatic offer of\nassistance, sat up wearily on the edge of the couch. After a deep\nbreath he got to his feet. Within the ship, the data-analyzer clattered\nbusily.\n\n\"Some hot coffee, sir?\" asked Peters, helpfully.\n\nJerry was annoyed at the effort it cost him just to talk. \"That will go\nnicely, Captain,\" he managed.\n\nThe technician leaned out the airlock door, his homely face split in a\ngrin. \"No problem with the aliens, sir,\" he said to Peters. \"Amiability\nindeterminate, but their basic weapon is infrasonics. They're built\nlike hard bubbles, sure suckers for bayonets or bullets. I don't\nthink, with sonic-shields, we'll have much trouble with them.\"\n\nPeters, in the process of pouring Jerry's coffee, shrugged. \"Well,\nwe're not here to _make_ trouble, either. The roborocket reported that\nthe aliens live either at sea or at least always in coastal regions.\nThey shouldn't object to our starting a settlement this far inland.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Jerry, suddenly, as he took the coffee and sipped at the\nhot brown liquid, \"I suppose those worm-creatures and the horned lions\nare to be eliminated?\"\n\nThe technician dropped his eyes. \"We can't have new colonists getting\npulled into those burrows, or impaled on those horns, sir.\" He handed\nthe report, translated by the machine into readable English, to Peters.\nThe pilot scanned the sheets, and nodded.\n\n\"Seems easy enough,\" he said agreeably. \"Those jellyfish-things, and\nthe flying apes are similar to species encountered before. They'll\nrespond to simple gunfire. Removal of the worm-things will be\nautomatic, once their source of sustenance is destroyed.\"\n\nJerry continued to sip his coffee and made no comment.\n\n\"As for the lion-things,\" Peters continued, \"I doubt we'll have to\nattack them directly, since their digestive mechanism calls for sulphur\nfrom those pits. When we cap off the pits, or dry them up, to clear the\nair for the incoming colonial wave, that should starve them out within\na week.\"\n\n\"Less than that,\" Jerry remarked emotionlessly. \"Being hungry they'll\neat, regardless. Then, unable to go on to the next step in the\nprocess--the ingestion of the sulphur--they'll die of food-poisoning.\nSimple, neat and efficient.\"\n\nPeters smiled and gripped Jerry's hand with his own.\n\n\"We have you to thank for the information, sir,\" he said, in obvious\nadmiration. \"At least we know we won't have to fight the intelligent\naliens. We'll have the central regions; they'll have the coasts and\nseas.\"\n\n\"And--\" Jerry pointedly withdrew his strong fingers from the pilot's\nhand--\"what happens when Mankind decides to spread out? When the colony\ngrows awhile, it's bound to want some of the coastal regions. Then\nwhat?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeters looked uncomfortable, then said, \"I don't think that's likely to\nhappen, sir. Not for some time, at any rate.\"\n\n\"But it _will_ happen,\" said Jerry, somberly. \"It always happens.\nEarthmen meet new races, arbitrate a hit, sign pacts and move in. Then,\nwhen they're settled pretty well, they ask the other race to move out.\nIt's almost a truism, Captain, that Earth can't comprehend anyone but\nan Earthman having any rights to survival.\"\n\nThe tight-lipped technician exchanged a look with Peters, then ducked\nback inside the ship. Adverse commentary about a Space Zoologist was\ndangerous. But no one had yet been broken in rank or discharged for a\nfacial expression.\n\n\"Well, sir, you're entitled to your opinion, of course,\" said Peters,\nwishing he had the moral courage to duck inside after the technician\nand avoid conversing with Norcriss. The job was done; why not forget it?\n\nJerry, sensing the other man's discomfort, dropped the topic, and\ncontented himself with sitting there in the increasing darkness,\nsipping his coffee. After a minute or two, Peters gratefully mumbled\nhis excuses and went into the ship.\n\nJerry sighed, finished his coffee, then began to walk toward the edge\nof the clearing, to watch the stars glow more brightly than they could\nin the interference of the ship's lights illuminating the camp.\n\nWhen he reached the rim of the wooded area, he stopped, then lay on\nhis back in the cool grass and watched the night sky, his thoughts\nrueful ones and his inner amusement ironic.\n\nPeople always were puzzled about how a Space Zoologist could stand\nbeing a creature other than a human being. And Space Zoologists always\nwere puzzled about how a human being could stand being part of that\nconquering race called man.\n\nThe twinkling stars distracted Jerry. Lying there watching them, he\nwondered to which of their planets he would be sent next, and to what\ndangers he might--in his new bodies--be subjected.\n\nNeither he nor any of his fellow zoologists had any real apprehensions\nabout death in an alien body. Fear of death, yes. That was normal\nenough, and inescapable in any creature. But he had no fear of\nperishing as a crawling thing, or multilegged thing, or soaring winged\nthing.\n\nTo Jerry Norcriss--indeed, to any Space Zoologist--to die like a man\nwas a dubious honor at best.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Arcturus Times Three, by Jack Sharkey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ARCTURUS TIMES THREE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51822-8.txt or 51822-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/2/51822/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
