Why don't you? Hah!\" In\nthe \"Hah!\" lay triumphant condemnation of a whole way of life.\n\n\"We do,\" Fay responded imperturbably, \"but a fresh viewpoint sometimes\nhelps.\"\n\n\"I'll say it does! Fay, you burglar, I'll bet you've got twenty people\nlike myself you milk for free ideas. First you irritate their bark and\nthen you make the rounds every so often to draw off the latex or the\nmaple gloop.\"\n\nFay smiled. \"It ought to please you that society still has a use for\nyou outre inner-directed types. It takes something to make a junior\nexecutive stay aboveground after dark, when the missiles are on the\nprowl.\"\n\n\"Society can't have much use for us or it'd pay us something,\"\nGusterson sourly asserted, staring blankly at the tankless TV and\nkicking it lightly as he passed on.\n\n\"No, you're wrong about that, Gussy. Money's not the key goad with you\ninner-directeds. I got that straight from our Motivations chief.\"\n\n\"Did he tell you what we should use instead to pay the grocer? A deep\ninner sense of achievement, maybe? Fay, why should I do any free\nthinking for Micro Systems?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why, Gussy. Simply because you get a kick out of\ninsulting us with sardonic ideas. If we take one of them seriously,\nyou think we're degrading ourselves, and that pleases you even more.\nLike making someone laugh at a lousy pun.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGusterson held still in his roaming and grinned. \"That the reason,\nhuh? I suppose my suggestions would have to be something in the line\nof ultra-subminiaturized computers, where one sinister fine-etched\nmolecule does the work of three big bumbling brain cells?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. Micro Systems is branching out. Wheel as free as a\nrogue star. But I'll pass along to Promotion your one molecule-three\nbrain cell sparkler. It's a slight exaggeration, but it's catchy.\"\n\n\"I'll have my kids watch your ads to see if you use it and then I'll\nsue the whole underworld.\" Gusterson frowned as he resumed his\nstalking. He stared puzzledly at the antique TV. \"How about inventing\na plutonium termite?\" he said suddenly. \"It would get rid of those\nstockpiles that are worrying you moles to death.\"\n\nFay grimaced noncommittally and cocked his head.\n\n\"Well, then, how about a beauty mask? How about that, hey? I don't\nmean one to repair a woman's complexion, but one she'd wear all the\ntime that'd make her look like a 17-year-old sexpot. That'd end _her_\nworries.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's for me,\" Daisy called from the kitchen. \"I'll make\nGusterson suffer. I'll make him crawl around on his hands and knees\nbegging my immature favors.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, you won't,\" Gusterson called back. \"You having a face like that\nwould scare the kids. Better cancel that one, Fay. Half the adult race\nlooking like Vina Vidarsson is too awful a thought.\"\n\n\"Yah, you're just scared of making a million dollars,\" Daisy jeered.\n\n\"I sure am,\" Gusterson said solemnly, scanning the fuzzy floor from\none murky glass wall to the other, hesitating at the TV. \"How about\nsomething homey now, like a flock of little prickly cylinders that\nroll around the floor collecting lint and flub? They'd work by\nelectricity, or at a pinch cats could bat 'em around. Every so often\nthey'd be automatically herded together and the lint cleaned off the\nbristles.\"\n\n\"No good,\" Fay said. \"There's no lint underground and cats are\n_verboten_. And the aboveground market doesn't amount to more\nmoneywise than the state of Southern Illinois. Keep it grander, Gussy,\nand more impractical--you can't sell people merely useful ideas.\" From\nhis hassock in the center of the room he looked uneasily around. \"Say,\ndid that violet tone in the glass come from the high Cleveland\nhydrogen bomb or is it just age and ultraviolet, like desert glass?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, somebody's grandfather liked it that color,\" Gusterson informed\nhim with happy bitterness. \"I like it too--the glass, I mean, not the\ntint. People who live in glass houses can see the stars--especially\nwhen there's a window-washing streak in their germ-plasm.\"\n\n\"Gussy, why don't you move underground?\" Fay asked, his voice taking\non a missionary note. \"It's a lot easier living in one room, believe\nme. You don't have to tramp from room to room hunting things.\"\n\n\"I like the exercise,\" Gusterson said stoutly.\n\n\"But I bet Daisy'd prefer it underground. And your kids wouldn't have\nto explain why their father lives like a Red Indian. Not to mention\nthe safety factor and insurance savings and a crypt church within easy\nslidewalk distance. Incidentally, we see the stars all the time,\nbetter than you do--by repeater.\"\n\n\"Stars by repeater,\" Gusterson murmured to the ceiling, pausing for God\nto comment. Then, \"No, Fay, even if I could afford it--and stand it--I'm\nsuch a bad-luck Harry that just when I got us all safely stowed at the\nN minus 1 sublevel, the Soviets would discover an earthquake bomb that\nstruck from below, and I'd have to follow everybody back to the\ntreetops. _Hey! How about bubble homes in orbit around earth?_ Micro\nSystems could subdivide the world's most spacious suburb and all you\nmoles could go ellipsing. Space is as safe as there is: no air, no\nshock waves. Free fall's the ultimate in restfulness--great health\nbenefits. Commute by rocket--or better yet stay home and do all your\nbusiness by TV-telephone, or by waldo if it were that sort of thing.\nEven pet your girl by remote control--she in her bubble, you in yours,\nwhizzing through vacuum. Oh, damn-damn-_damn_-_damn_-DAMN!\"\n\nHe was glaring at the blank screen of the TV, his big hands clenching\nand unclenching.\n\n\"Don't let Fay give you apoplexy--he's not worth it,\" Daisy said,\nsticking her trim head in from the kitchen, while Fay inquired\nanxiously, \"Gussy, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, you worm!\" Gusterson roared, \"Except that an hour ago I\nforgot to tune in on the only TV program I've wanted to hear this\nyear--_Finnegans Wake_ scored for English, Gaelic and brogue. Oh,\ndamn-_damn_-DAMN!\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" Fay said lightly. \"I didn't know they were releasing it on\nflat TV too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, they were! Some things are too damn big to keep completely\nunderground. And I had to forget! I'm always doing it--I miss\neverything! Look here, you rat,\" he blatted suddenly at Fay, shaking\nhis finger under the latter's chin, \"I'll tell you what you can have\nthat ignorant team of yours invent. They can fix me up a mechanical\nsecretary that I can feed orders into and that'll remind me when the\nexact moment comes to listen to TV or phone somebody or mail in a\nstory or write a letter or pick up a magazine or look at an eclipse or\na new orbiting station or fetch the kids from school or buy Daisy a\nbunch of flowers or whatever it is. It's got to be something that's\nalways with me, not something I have to go and consult or that I can\nget sick of and put down somewhere. And it's got to remind me forcibly\nenough so that I take notice and don't just shrug it aside, like I\nsometimes do even when Daisy reminds me of things. That's what your\nstupid team can invent for me! If they do a good job, I'll pay 'em as\nmuch as fifty dollars!\"\n\n\"That doesn't sound like anything so very original to me,\" Fay\ncommented coolly, leaning back from the wagging finger. \"I think all\nsenior executives have something of that sort. At least, their\nsecretary keeps some kind of file....\"\n\n\"I'm not looking for something with spiked falsies and nylons up to\nthe neck,\" interjected Gusterson, whose ideas about secretaries were a\ntrifle lurid. \"I just want a mech reminder--that's all!\"\n\n\"Well, I'll keep the idea in mind,\" Fay assured him, \"along with the\nbubble homes and beauty masks. If we ever develop anything along those\nlines, I'll let you know. If it's a beauty mask, I'll bring Daisy a\npilot model--to use to scare strange kids.\" He put his watch to his\near. \"Good lord, I'm going to have to cut to make it underground\nbefore the main doors close. Just ten minutes to Second Curfew! 'By,\nGus. 'By, Daze.\"\n\nTwo minutes later, living room lights out, they watched Fay's\nforeshortened antlike figure scurrying across the balding ill-lit park\ntoward the nearest escalator.\n\nGusterson said, \"Weird to think of that big bright space-poor glamor\nbasement stretching around everywhere underneath. Did you remind\nSmitty to put a new bulb in the elevator?\"\n\n\"The Smiths moved out this morning,\" Daisy said tonelessly. \"They went\nunderneath.\"\n\n\"Like cockroaches,\" Gusterson said. \"Cockroaches leavin' a sinkin'\napartment building. Next the ghosts'll be retreatin' to the shelters.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, from now on we're our own janitors,\" Daisy said.\n\nHe nodded. \"Just leaves three families besides us loyal to this glass\ndeath trap. Not countin' ghosts.\" He sighed. Then, \"You like to move\nbelow, Daisy?\" he asked softly, putting his arm lightly across her\nshoulders. \"Get a woozy eyeful of the bright lights and all for a\nchange? Be a rat for a while? Maybe we're getting too old to be bats.\nI could scrounge me a company job and have a thinking closet all to\nmyself and two secretaries with stainless steel breasts. Life'd be\neasier for you and a lot cleaner. And you'd sleep safer.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" she answered and paused. She ran her fingertip slowly\nacross the murky glass, its violet tint barely perceptible against a\ncold dim light across the park. \"But somehow,\" she said, snaking her\narm around his waist, \"I don't think I'd sleep happier--or one bit\nexcited.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThree weeks later Fay, dropping in again, handed to Daisy the larger\nof the two rather small packages he was carrying.\n\n\"It's a so-called beauty mask,\" he told her, \"complete with wig,\neyelashes, and wettable velvet lips. It even breathes--pinholed\nelastiskin with a static adherence-charge. But Micro Systems had\nnothing to do with it, thank God. Beauty Trix put it on the market ten\ndays ago and it's already started a teen-age craze. Some boys are\nwearing them too, and the police are yipping at Trix for encouraging\ntransvestism with psychic repercussions.\"\n\n\"Didn't I hear somewhere that Trix is a secret subsidiary of Micro?\"\nGusterson demanded, rearing up from his ancient electric typewriter.\n\"No, you're not stopping me writing, Fay--it's the gut of evening. If\nI do any more I won't have any juice to start with tomorrow. I got\nanother of my insanity thrillers moving. A real id-teaser. In this one\nnot only all the characters are crazy but the robot psychiatrist too.\"\n\n\"The vending machines are jumping with insanity novels,\" Fay\ncommented. \"Odd they're so popular.\"\n\nGusterson chortled. \"The only way you outer-directed moles will accept\nindividuality any more even in a fictional character, without your\nsuperegos getting seasick, is for them to be crazy. Hey, Daisy! Lemme\nsee that beauty mask!\"\n\nBut his wife, backing out of the room, hugged the package to her bosom\nand solemnly shook her head.\n\n\"A hell of a thing,\" Gusterson complained, \"not even to be able to see\nwhat my stolen ideas look like.\"\n\n\"I got a present for you too,\" Fay said. \"Something you might think of\nas a royalty on all the inventions someone thought of a little ahead\nof you. Fifty dollars by your own evaluation.\" He held out the smaller\npackage. \"Your tickler.\"\n\n\"My _what_?\" Gusterson demanded suspiciously.\n\n\"Your tickler. The mech reminder you wanted. It turns out that the\nfile a secretary keeps to remind her boss to do certain things at\ncertain times is called a tickler file. So we named this a tickler.\nHere.\"\n\nGusterson still didn't touch the package. \"You mean you actually put\nyour invention team to work on that nonsense?\"\n\n\"Well, what do you think? Don't be scared of it. Here, I'll show you.\"\n\nAs he unwrapped the package, Fay said, \"It hasn't been decided yet\nwhether we'll manufacture it commercially. If we do, I'll put through\na voucher for you--for 'development consultation' or something like\nthat. Sorry no royalty's possible. Davidson's squad had started to\nwork up the identical idea three years ago, but it got shelved. I\nfound it on a snoop through the closets. There! Looks rich, doesn't\nit?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the scarred black tabletop was a dully gleaming silvery object\nabout the size and shape of a cupped hand with fingers merging. A tiny\npellet on a short near-invisible wire led off from it. On the back was\na punctured area suggesting the face of a microphone; there was also a\nwindow with a date and time in hours and minutes showing through and\nnext to that four little buttons in a row. The concave underside of\nthe silvery \"hand\" was smooth except for a central area where what\nlooked like two little rollers came through.\n\n\"It goes on your shoulder under your shirt,\" Fay explained, \"and you\ntuck the pellet in your ear. We might work up bone conduction on a\ncommercial model. Inside is an ultra-slow fine-wire recorder holding a\nspool that runs for a week. The clock lets you go to any place on the\n7-day wire and record a message. The buttons give you variable speed\nin going there, so you don't waste too much time making a setting.\nThere's a knack in fingering them efficiently, but it's easily\nacquired.\"\n\nFay picked up the tickler. \"For instance, suppose there's a TV show\nyou want to catch tomorrow night at twenty-two hundred.\" He touched\nthe buttons. There was the faintest whirring. The clock face blurred\nbriefly three times before showing the setting he'd mentioned. Then\nFay spoke into the punctured area: \"Turn on TV Channel Two, you big\ndummy!\" He grinned over at Gusterson. \"When you've got all your\ninstructions to yourself loaded in, you synchronize with the present\nmoment and let her roll. Fit it on your shoulder and forget it. Oh,\nyes, and it literally does tickle you every time it delivers an\ninstruction. That's what the little rollers are for. Believe me, you\ncan't ignore it. Come on, Gussy, take off your shirt and try it out.\nWe'll feed in some instructions for the next ten minutes so you get\nthe feel of how it works.\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" Gusterson said. \"Not right now. I want to sniff\naround it first. My God, it's small! Besides everything else it does,\ndoes it think?\"\n\n\"Don't pretend to be an idiot, Gussy! You know very well that even\nwith ultra-sub-micro nothing quite this small can possibly have enough\nelements to do any thinking.\"\n\nGusterson shrugged. \"I don't know about that. I think bugs think.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFay groaned faintly. \"Bugs operate by instinct, Gussy,\" he said. \"A\npatterned routine. They do not scan situations and consequences and\nthen make decisions.\"\n\n\"I don't expect bugs to make decisions,\" Gusterson said. \"For that\nmatter I don't like people who go around alla time making decisions.\"\n\n\"Well, you can take it from me, Gussy, that this tickler is just a\nminiaturized wire recorder and clock ... and a tickler. It doesn't do\nanything else.\"\n\n\"Not yet, maybe,\" Gusterson said darkly. \"Not this model. Fay, I'm\nserious about bugs thinking. Or if they don't exactly think, they\nfeel. They've got an interior drama. An inner glow. They're conscious.\nFor that matter, Fay, I think all your really complex electronic\ncomputers are conscious too.\"\n\n\"Quit kidding, Gussy.\"\n\n\"Who's kidding?\"\n\n\"You are. Computers simply aren't alive.\"\n\n\"What's alive? A word. I think computers are conscious, at least while\nthey're operating. They've got that inner glow of awareness. They sort\nof ... well ... meditate.\"\n\n\"Gussy, computers haven't got any circuits for meditating. They're not\nprogrammed for mystical lucubrations. They've just got circuits for\nsolving the problems they're on.\"\n\n\"Okay, you admit they've got problem-solving circuits--like a man has.\nI say if they've got the equipment for being conscious, they're\nconscious. What has wings, flies.\"\n\n\"Including stuffed owls and gilt eagles and dodoes--and wood-burning\nairplanes?\"\n\n\"Maybe, under some circumstances. There _was_ a wood-burning airplane.\nFay,\" Gusterson continued, wagging his wrists for emphasis, \"I really\nthink computers are conscious. They just don't have any way of telling\nus that they are. Or maybe they don't have any _reason_ to tell us,\nlike the little Scotch boy who didn't say a word until he was fifteen\nand was supposed to be deaf and dumb.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he say a word?\"\n\n\"Because he'd never had anything to say. Or take those Hindu fakirs,\nFay, who sit still and don't say a word for thirty years or until\ntheir fingernails grow to the next village. If Hindu fakirs can do\nthat, computers can!\"\n\nLooking as if he were masticating a lemon, Fay asked quietly, \"Gussy,\ndid you say you're working on an insanity novel?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGusterson frowned fiercely. \"Now you're kidding,\" he accused Fay. \"The\ndirty kind of kidding, too.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Fay said with light contrition. \"Well, now you've sniffed\nat it, how about trying on Tickler?\" He picked up the gleaming blunted\ncrescent and jogged it temptingly under Gusterson's chin.\n\n\"Why should I?\" Gusterson asked, stepping back. \"Fay, I'm up to my\nears writing a book. The last thing I want is something interrupting\nme to make me listen to a lot of junk and do a lot of useless things.\"\n\n\"But, dammit, Gussy! It was all your idea in the first place!\" Fay\nblatted. Then, catching himself, he added, \"I mean, you were one of\nthe first people to think of this particular sort of instrument.\"\n\n\"Maybe so, but I've done some more thinking since then.\" Gusterson's\nvoice grew a trifle solemn. \"Inner-directed worthwhile thinkin'. Fay,\nwhen a man forgets to do something, it's because he really doesn't\nwant to do it or because he's all roiled up down in his unconscious.\nHe ought to take it as a danger signal and investigate the roiling,\nnot hire himself a human or mech reminder.\"\n\n\"Bushwa,\" Fay retorted. \"In that case you shouldn't write memorandums\nor even take notes.\"\n\n\"Maybe I shouldn't,\" Gusterson agreed lamely. \"I'd have to think that\nover too.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Fay jeered. \"No, I'll tell you what your trouble is, Gussy.\nYou're simply scared of this contraption. You've loaded your skull\nwith horror-story nonsense about machines sprouting minds and taking\nover the world--until you're even scared of a simple miniaturized and\nclocked recorder.\" He thrust it out.\n\n\"Maybe I am,\" Gusterson admitted, controlling a flinch. \"Honestly,\nFay, that thing's got a gleam in its eye as if it had ideas of its\nown. Nasty ideas.\"\n\n\"Gussy, you nut, it hasn't _got_ an eye.\"\n\n\"Not now, no, but it's got the gleam--the eye may come. It's the\nCheshire cat in reverse. If you'd step over here and look at yourself\nholding it, you could see what I mean. But I don't think computers\n_sprout_ minds, Fay. I just think they've _got_ minds, because they've\ngot the mind elements.\"\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" Fay mocked. \"Everything that has a material side has a\nmental side,\" he chanted. \"Everything that's a body is also a spirit.\nGussy, that dubious old metaphysical dualism went out centuries ago.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" Gusterson said, \"but we still haven't anything but that\ndubious dualism to explain the human mind, have we? It's a jelly of\nnerve cells and it's a vision of the cosmos. If that isn't dualism,\nwhat is?\"\n\n\"I give up. Gussy, are you going to try out this tickler?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But dammit, Gussy, we made it just for you!--practically.\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I'm not coming near the thing.\"\n\n\"Zen come near me,\" a husky voice intoned behind them. \"Tonight I\nvant a man.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStanding in the door was something slim in a short silver sheath. It\nhad golden bangs and the haughtiest snub-nosed face in the world. It\nslunk toward them.\n\n\"My God, Vina Vidarsson!\" Gusterson yelled.\n\n\"Daisy, that's terrific,\" Fay applauded, going up to her.\n\nShe bumped him aside with a swing of her hips, continuing to advance.\n\"Not you, Ratty,\" she said throatily. \"I vant a real man.\"\n\n\"Fay, I suggested Vina Vidarsson's face for the beauty mask,\"\nGusterson said, walking around his wife and shaking a finger. \"Don't\ntell me Trix just happened to think of that too.\"\n\n\"What else could they think of?\" Fay laughed. \"This season sex means\nVV and nobody else.\" An odd little grin flicked his lips, a tic\ntraveled up his face and his body twitched slightly. \"Say, folks, I'm\ngoing to have to be leaving. It's exactly fifteen minutes to Second\nCurfew. Last time I had to run and I got heartburn. When _are_ you\npeople going to move downstairs? I'll leave Tickler, Gussy. Play\naround with it and get used to it. 'By now.\"\n\n\"Hey, Fay,\" Gusterson called curiously, \"have you developed absolute\ntime sense?\"\n\nFay grinned a big grin from the doorway--almost too big a grin for so\nsmall a man. \"I didn't need to,\" he said softly, patting his right\nshoulder. \"My tickler told me.\"\n\nHe closed the door behind him.\n\nAs side-by-side they watched him strut sedately across the murky\nchilly-looking park, Gusterson mused, \"So the little devil had one of\nthose nonsense-gadgets on all the time and I never noticed. Can you\nbeat that?\" Something drew across the violet-tinged stars a short\nbright line that quickly faded. \"What's that?\" Gusterson asked\ngloomily. \"Next to last stage of missile-here?\"\n\n\"Won't you settle for an old-fashioned shooting star?\" Daisy asked\nsoftly. The (wettable) velvet lips of the mask made even her natural\nvoice sound different. She reached a hand back of her neck to pull the\nthing off.\n\n\"Hey, don't do that,\" Gusterson protested in a hurt voice. \"Not for a\nwhile anyway.\"\n\n\"Hokay!\" she said harshly, turning on him. \"Zen down on your knees,\ndog!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was a fortnight and Gusterson was loping down the home stretch on\nhis 40,000-word insanity novel before Fay dropped in again, this time\npromptly at high noon.\n\nNormally Fay cringed his shoulders a trifle and was inclined to\nslither, but now he strode aggressively, his legs scissoring in a\nfast, low goosestep. He whipped off the sunglasses that all moles wore\ntopside by day and began to pound Gusterson on the back while calling\nboisterously, \"How are you, Gussy Old Boy, Old Boy?\"\n\nDaisy came in from the kitchen to see why Gusterson was choking. She\nwas instantly grabbed and violently bussed to the accompaniment of,\n\"Hiya, Gorgeous! Yum-yum! How about ad-libbing that some weekend?\"\n\nShe stared at Fay dazedly, rasping the back of her hand across her\nmouth, while Gusterson yelled, \"Quit that! What's got into you, Fay?\nHave they transferred you out of R & D to Company Morale? Do they line\nup all the secretaries at roll call and make you give them an\neight-hour energizing kiss?\"\n\n\"Ha, wouldn't you like to know?\" Fay retorted. He grinned, twitched\njumpingly, held still a moment, then hustled over to the far wall.\n\"Look out there,\" he rapped, pointing through the violet glass at a\ngap between the two nearest old skyscraper apartments. \"In thirty\nseconds you'll see them test the new needle bomb at the other end of\nLake Erie. It's educational.\" He began to count off seconds,\nvigorously semaphoring his arm. \"... Two ... three ... Gussy, I've put\nthrough a voucher for two yards for you. Budgeting squawked, but I\npressured 'em.\"\n\nDaisy squealed, \"Yards!--are those dollar thousands?\" while Gusterson\nwas asking, \"Then you're marketing the tickler?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes,\" Fay replied to them in turn. \"... Nine ... ten ...\" Again\nhe grinned and twitched. \"Time for noon Com-staff,\" he announced\nstaccato. \"Pardon the hush box.\" He whipped a pancake phone from under\nhis coat, clapped it over his face and spoke fiercely but inaudibly\ninto it, continuing to semaphore. Suddenly he thrust the phone away.\n\"Twenty-nine ... thirty ... Thar she blows!\"\n\nAn incandescent streak shot up the sky from a little above the far\nhorizon and a doubly dazzling point of light appeared just above the\ntop of it, with the effect of God dotting an \"i\".\n\n\"Ha, that'll skewer espionage satellites like swatting flies!\" Fay\nproclaimed as the portent faded. \"Bracing! Gussy, where's your\ntickler? I've got a new spool for it that'll razzle-dazzle you.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Gusterson said drily. \"Daisy?\"\n\n\"You gave it to the kids and they got to fooling with it and broke\nit.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" Fay told them with a large sidewise sweep of his hand.\n\"Better you wait for the new model. It's a six-way improvement.\"\n\n\"So I gather,\" Gusterson said, eyeing him speculatively. \"Does it\nautomatically inject you with cocaine? A fix every hour on the\nsecond?\"\n\n\"Ha-ha, joke. Gussy, it achieves the same effect without using any\ndope at all. Listen: a tickler reminds you of your duties and\nopportunities--your chances for happiness and success! What's the\nobvious next step?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Throw it out the window. By the way, how do you do that when you're\nunderground?\"\n\n\"We have hi-speed garbage boosts. The obvious next step is you give\nthe tickler a heart. It not only tells you, it warmly persuades you.\nIt doesn't just say, 'Turn on the TV Channel Two, Joyce program,' it\n_brills_ at you, 'Kid, Old Kid, race for the TV and flip that Two\nSwitch! There's a great show coming through the pipes this second plus\nten--you'll enjoy the hell out of yourself! Grab a ticket to\necstasy!'\"\n\n\"My God,\" Gusterson gasped, \"are those the kind of jolts it's giving\nyou now?\"\n\n\"Don't you get it, Gussy? You never load your tickler except when\nyou're feeling buoyantly enthusiastic. You don't just tell yourself\nwhat to do hour by hour next week, you sell yourself on it. That way\nyou not only make doubly sure you'll obey instructions but you\nconstantly reinoculate yourself with your own enthusiasm.\"\n\n\"I can't stand myself when I'm that enthusiastic,\" Gusterson said. \"I\nfeel ashamed for hours afterwards.\"\n\n\"You're warped--all this lonely sky-life. What's more, Gussy, think\nhow still more persuasive some of those instructions would be if they\ncame to a man in his best girl's most bedroomy voice, or his doctor's\nor psycher's if it's that sort of thing--or Vina Vidarsson's! By the\nway, Daze, don't wear that beauty mask outside. It's a grand\nmisdemeanor ever since ten thousand teen-agers rioted through\nTunnel-Mart wearing them. And VV's sueing Trix.\"\n\n\"No chance of that,\" Daisy said. \"Gusterson got excited and bit off\nthe nose.\" She pinched her own delicately.\n\n\"I'd no more obey my enthusiastic self,\" Gusterson was brooding, \"than\nI'd obey a Napoleon drunk on his own brandy or a hopped-up St.\nFrancis. Reinoculated with my own enthusiasm? I'd die just like from\nsnake-bite!\"\n\n\"Warped, I said,\" Fay dogmatized, stamping around. \"Gussy, having the\ninstructions persuasive instead of neutral turned out to be only the\nopening wedge. The next step wasn't so obvious, but I saw it. Using\nsubliminal verbal stimuli in his tickler, a man can be given constant\nsupportive euphoric therapy 24 hours a day! And it makes use of all\nthat empty wire. We've revived the ideas of a pioneer dynamic psycher\nnamed Dr. Cou\u00e9. For instance, right now my tickler is saying to me--in\ntones too soft to reach my conscious mind, but do they stab into the\nunconscious!--'Day by day in every way I'm getting sharper and\nsharper.' It alternates that with 'gutsier and gutsier' and ... well,\nforget that. Cou\u00e9 mostly used 'better and better' but that seems too\ngeneral. And every hundredth time it says them out loud and the\ntickler gives me a brush--just a faint cootch--to make sure I'm\nkeeping in touch.\"\n\n\"That third word-pair,\" Daisy wondered, feeling her mouth\nreminiscently. \"Could I guess?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGusterson's eyes had been growing wider and wider. \"Fay,\" he said, \"I\ncould no more use my mind for anything if I knew all that was going on\nin my inner ear than if I were being brushed down with brooms by three\nwitches. Look here,\" he said with loud authority, \"you got to stop all\nthis--it's crazy. Fay, if Micro'll junk the tickler, I'll think you up\nsomething else to invent--something real good.\"\n\n\"Your inventing days are over,\" Fay brilled gleefully. \"I mean, you'll\nnever equal your masterpiece.\"\n\n\"How about,\" Gusterson bellowed, \"an anti-individual guided missile?\nThe physicists have got small-scale antigravity good enough to float\nand fly something the size of a hand grenade. I can smell that even\nthough it's a back-of-the-safe military secret. Well, how about keying\nsuch a missile to a man's finger-prints--or brainwaves, maybe, or his\nunique smell!--so it can spot and follow him around then target in on\nhim, without harming anyone else? Long-distance assassination--and the\nstinkingest gets it! Or you could simply load it with some disgusting\ngoo and key it to teen-agers as a group--that'd take care of them.\nFay, doesn't it give you a rich warm kick to think of my midget\nmissiles buzzing around in your tunnels, seeking out evil-doers, like\na swarm of angry wasps or angelic bumblebees?\"\n\n\"You're not luring me down any side trails,\" Fay said laughingly. He\ngrinned and twitched, then hurried toward the opposite wall, motioning\nthem to follow. Outside, about a hundred yards beyond the purple\nglass, rose another ancient glass-walled apartment skyscraper. Beyond,\nLake Erie rippled glintingly.\n\n\"Another bomb-test?\" Gusterson asked.\n\nFay pointed at the building. \"Tomorrow,\" he announced, \"a modern\nfactory, devoted solely to the manufacture of ticklers, will be\nerected on that site.\"\n\n\"You mean one of those windowless phallic eyesores?\" Gusterson\ndemanded. \"Fay, you people aren't even consistent. You've got all your\nhomes underground. Why not your factories?\"\n\n\"Sh! Not enough room. And night missiles are scarier.\"\n\n\"I know that building's been empty for a year,\" Daisy said uneasily,\n\"but how--?\"\n\n\"Sh! Watch! _Now!_\"\n\nThe looming building seemed to blur or fuzz for a moment. Then it was\nas if the lake's bright ripples had invaded the old glass a hundred\nyards away. Wavelets chased themselves up and down the gleaming walls,\nbecame higher, higher ... and then suddenly the glass cracked all over\nto tiny fragments and fell away, to be followed quickly by fragmented\nconcrete and plastic and plastic piping, until all that was left was\nthe nude steel framework, vibrating so rapidly as to be almost\ninvisible against the gleaming lake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaisy covered her ears, but there was no explosion, only a\nlong-drawn-out low crash as the fragments hit twenty floors below and\ndust whooshed out sideways.\n\n\"Spectacular!\" Fay summed up. \"Knew you'd enjoy it. That little trick\nwas first conceived by the great Tesla during his last fruity years.\nResearch discovered it in his biog--we just made the dream come true.\nA tiny resonance device you could carry in your belt-bag attunes\nitself to the natural harmonic of a structure and then increases\namplitude by tiny pushes exactly in time. Just like soldiers marching\nin step can break down a bridge, only this is as if it were being done\nby one marching ant.\" He pointed at the naked framework appearing out\nof its own blur and said, \"We'll be able to hang the factory on that.\nIf not, we'll whip a mega-current through it and vaporize it. No\nquestion the micro-resonator is the neatest sweetest wrecking device\ngoing. You can expect a lot more of this sort of efficiency now that\nmankind has the tickler to enable him to use his full potential.\nWhat's the matter, folks?\"\n\nDaisy was staring around the violet-walled room with dumb mistrust.\nHer hands were trembling.\n\n\"You don't have to worry,\" Fay assured her with an understanding\nlaugh. \"This building's safe for a month more at least.\" Suddenly he\ngrimaced and leaped a foot in the air. He raised a clawed hand to\nscratch his shoulder but managed to check the movement. \"Got to beat\nit, folks,\" he announced tersely. \"My tickler gave me the grand\ncootch.\"\n\n\"Don't go yet,\" Gusterson called, rousing himself with a shudder which\nhe immediately explained: \"I just had the illusion that if I shook\nmyself all my flesh and guts would fall off my shimmying skeleton,\nBrr! Fay, before you and Micro go off half cocked, I want you to know\nthere's one insuperable objection to the tickler as a mass-market\nitem. The average man or woman won't go to the considerable time and\ntrouble it must take to load a tickler. He simply hasn't got the\ncompulsive orderliness and willingness to plan that it requires.\"\n\n\"We thought of that weeks ago,\" Fay rapped, his hand on the door.\n\"Every tickler spool that goes to market is patterned like wallpaper\nwith one of five designs of suitable subliminal supportive euphoric\nmaterial. 'Ittier and ittier,' 'viriler and viriler'--you know. The\nbuyer is robot-interviewed for an hour, his personalized daily routine\nlaid out and thereafter templated on his weekly spool. He's strongly\nurged next to take his tickler to his doctor and psycher for further\ninstruction-imposition. We've been working with the medical profession\nfrom the start. They love the tickler because it'll remind people to\ntake their medicine on the dot ... and rest and eat and go to sleep\njust when and how doc says. This is a big operation, Gussy--a biiiiiiig\noperation! 'By!\"\n\nDaisy hurried to the wall to watch him cross the park. Deep down she\nwas a wee bit worried that he might linger to attach a micro-resonator\nto _this_ building and she wanted to time him. But Gusterson settled\ndown to his typewriter and began to bat away.\n\n\"I want to have another novel started,\" he explained to her, \"before\nthe ant marches across this building in about four and a half weeks\n... or a million sharp little gutsy guys come swarming out of the\nground and heave it into Lake Erie.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nEarly next morning windowless walls began to crawl up the stripped\nskyscraper between them and the lake. Daisy pulled the black-out\ncurtains on that side. For a day or two longer their thoughts and\nconversations were haunted by Gusterson's vague sardonic visions of a\nhorde of tickler-energized moles pouring up out of the tunnels to tear\ndown the remaining trees, tank the atmosphere and perhaps somehow\ndismantle the stars--at least on this side of the world--but then they\nboth settled back into their customary easy-going routines. Gusterson\ntyped. Daisy made her daily shopping trip to a little topside daytime\nstore and started painting a mural on the floor of the empty apartment\nnext theirs but one.\n\n\"We ought to lasso some neighbors,\" she suggested once. \"I need\nsomebody to hold my brushes and admire. How about you making a trip\nbelow at the cocktail hours, Gusterson, and picking up a couple of\ngirls for a starter? Flash the old viriler charm, cootch them up a\nbit, emphasize the delights of high living, but make sure they're\ncompatible roommates. You could pick up that two-yard check from Micro\nat the same time.\"\n\n\"You're an immoral money-ravenous wench,\" Gusterson said absently,\ntrying to dream of an insanity beyond insanity that would make his\nnext novel a real id-rousing best-vender.\n\n\"If that's your vision of me, you shouldn't have chewed up the VV\nmask.\"\n\n\"I'd really prefer you with green stripes,\" he told her. \"But stripes,\nspots, or sun-bathing, you're better than those cocktail moles.\"\n\nActually both of them acutely disliked going below. They much\npreferred to perch in their eyrie and watch the people of Cleveland\nDepths, as they privately called the local sub-suburb, rush up out of\nthe shelters at dawn to work in the concrete fields and windowless\nfactories, make their daytime jet trips and freeway jaunts, do their\nnoon-hour and coffee-break guerrilla practice, and then go scurrying\nback at twilight to the atomic-proof, brightly lit, vastly exciting,\nclaustrophobic caves.\n\nFay and his projects began once more to seem dreamlike, though\nGusterson did run across a cryptic advertisement for ticklers in _The\nManchester Guardian_, which he got daily by facsimile. Their three\nchildren reported similar ads, of no interest to young fry, on the TV\nand one afternoon they came home with the startling news that the\nmonitors at their subsurface school had been issued ticklers. On sharp\ninterrogation by Gusterson, however, it appeared that these last were\nnot ticklers but merely two-way radios linked to the school police\nstation transmitter.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Which is bad enough,\" Gusterson commented later to Daisy. \"But it'd\nbe even dirtier to think of those clock-watching superegos being\nstrapped to kids' shoulders. Can you imagine Huck Finn with a tickler,\ntellin' him when to tie up the raft to a tow-head and when to take a\nswim?\"\n\n\"I bet Fay could,\" Daisy countered. \"When's he going to bring you that\ncheck, anyhow? Iago wants a jetcycle and I promised Imogene a Vina Kit\nand then Claudius'll have to have something.\"\n\nGusterson scowled thoughtfully. \"You know, Daze,\" he said, \"I got a\nfeeling Fay's in the hospital, all narcotized up and being fed\nintravenously. The way he was jumping around last time, that tickler\nwas going to cootch him to pieces in a week.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs if to refute this intuition, Fay turned up that very evening. The\nlights were dim. Something had gone wrong with the building's old\ntransformer and, pending repairs, the two remaining occupied\napartments were making do with batteries, which turned bright globes\nto mysterious amber candles and made Gusterson's ancient typewriter\noperate sluggishly.\n\nFay's manner was subdued or at least closely controlled and for a\nmoment Gusterson thought he'd shed his tickler. Then the little man\ncame out of the shadows and Gusterson saw the large bulge on his right\nshoulder.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes, we had to up it a bit sizewise,\" Fay explained in clipped tones.\n\"Additional super-features. While brilliantly successful on the whole,\nthe subliminal euphorics were a shade too effective. Several hundred\nusers went hoppity manic. We gentled the cootch and qualified the\nsubliminals--you know, 'Day by day in every way I'm getting sharper\n_and more serene_'--but a stabilizing influence was still needed, so\nafter a top-level conference we decided to combine Tickler with\nMoodmaster.\"\n\n\"My God,\" Gusterson interjected, \"do they have a machine now that does\nthat?\"\n\n\"Of course. They've been using them on ex-mental patients for years.\"\n\n\"I just don't keep up with progress,\" Gusterson said, shaking his head\nbleakly. \"I'm falling behind on all fronts.\"\n\n\"You ought to have your tickler remind you to read Science Service\nreleases,\" Fay told him. \"Or simply instruct it to scan the releases\nand--no, that's still in research.\" He looked at Gusterson's shoulder\nand his eyes widened. \"You're not wearing the new-model tickler I sent\nyou,\" he said accusingly.\n\n\"I never got it,\" Gusterson assured him. \"Postmen deliver topside mail\nand parcels by throwing them on the high-speed garbage boosts and\nhoping a tornado will blow them to the right addresses.\" Then he added\nhelpfully, \"Maybe the Russians stole it while it was riding the\nwhirlwinds.\"\n\n\"That's not a suitable topic for jesting,\" Fay frowned. \"We're hoping\nthat Tickler will mobilize the full potential of the Free World for\nthe first time in history. Gusterson, you are going to have to wear a\nticky-tick. It's becoming impossible for a man to get through modern\nlife without one.\"\n\n\"Maybe I will,\" Gusterson said appeasingly, \"but right now tell me\nabout Moodmaster. I want to put it in my new insanity novel.\"\n\nFay shook his head. \"Your readers will just think you're behind the\ntimes. If you use it, underplay it. But anyhow, Moodmaster is a simple\nphysiotherapy engine that monitors bloodstream chemicals and body\nelectricity. It ties directly into the bloodstream, keeping blood,\nsugar, et cetera, at optimum levels and injecting euphrin or depressin\nas necessary--and occasionally a touch of extra adrenaline, as during\nwork emergencies.\"\n\n\"Is it painful?\" Daisy called from the bedroom.\n\n\"Excruciating,\" Gusterson called back. \"Excuse it, please,\" he grinned\nat Fay. \"Hey, didn't I suggest cocaine injections last time I saw\nyou?\"\n\n\"So you did,\" Fay agreed flatly. \"Oh by the way, Gussy, here's that\ncheck for a yard I promised you. Micro doesn't muzzle the ox.\"\n\n\"Hooray!\" Daisy cheered faintly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I thought you said it was going to be for two.\" Gusterson complained.\n\n\"Budgeting always forces a last-minute compromise,\" Fay shrugged. \"You\nhave to learn to accept those things.\"\n\n\"I love accepting money and I'm glad any time for three feet,\" Daisy\ncalled agreeably. \"Six feet might make me wonder if I weren't an\ninsect, but getting a yard just makes me feel like a gangster's moll.\"\n\n\"Want to come out and gloat over the yard paper, Toots, and stuff it\nin your diamond-embroidered net stocking top?\" Gusterson called back.\n\n\"No, I'm doing something to that portion of me just now. But hang onto\nthe yard, Gusterson.\"\n\n\"Aye-aye, Cap'n,\" he assured her. Then, turning back to Fay, \"So\nyou've taken the Dr. Cou\u00e9 repeating out of the tickler?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Just balanced it off with depressin. The subliminals are\nstill a prime sales-point. All the tickler features are cumulative,\nGussy. You're still underestimating the scope of the device.\"\n\n\"I guess I am. What's this 'work-emergencies' business? If you're\nusing the tickler to inject drugs into workers to keep them going,\nthat's really just my cocaine suggestion modernized and I'm putting in\nfor another thou. Hundreds of years ago the South American Indians\nchewed coca leaves to kill fatigue sensations.\"\n\n\"That so? Interesting--and it proves priority for the Indians, doesn't\nit? I'll make a try for you, Gussy, but don't expect anything.\" He\ncleared his throat, his eyes grew distant and, turning his head a\nlittle to the right, he enunciated sharply, \"Pooh-Bah. Time: Inst oh\nfive. One oh five seven. Oh oh. Record: Gussy coca thou budget. Cut.\"\nHe explained, \"We got a voice-cued setter now on the deluxe models.\nYou can record a memo to yourself without taking off your shirt.\nIncidentally, I use the ends of the hours for trifle-memos. I've\nalready used up the fifty-nines and eights for tomorrow and started on\nthe fifty-sevens.\"\n\n\"I understood most of your memo,\" Gusterson told him gruffly. \"The\nlast 'Oh oh' was for seconds, wasn't it? Now I call that crude--why\nnot microseconds too? But how do you remember where you've made a memo\nso you don't rerecord over it? After all, you're rerecording over the\nwallpaper all the time.\"\n\n\"Tickler beeps and then hunts for the nearest information-free space.\"\n\n\"I see. And what's the Pooh-Bah for?\"\n\nFay smiled. \"Cut. My password for activating the setter, so it won't\nrespond to chance numerals it overhears.\"\n\n\"But why Pooh-Bah?\"\n\nFay grinned. \"Cut. And you a writer. It's a literary reference, Gussy.\nPooh-Bah (cut!) was Lord High Everything Else in _The Mikado_. He had\na little list and nothing on it would ever be missed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Gusterson remembered, glowering. \"As I recall it, all that\nwent on that list was the names of people who were slated to have\ntheir heads chopped off by Ko-Ko. Better watch your step, Shorty. It\nmay be a back-handed omen. Maybe all those workers you're puttin'\nticklers on to pump them full of adrenaline so they'll overwork\nwithout noticin' it will revolt and come out some day choppin' for\nyour head.\"\n\n\"Spare me the Marxist mythology,\" Fay protested. \"Gussy, you've got a\ncompletely wrong slant on Tickler. It's true that most of our mass\nsales so far, bar government and army, have been to large companies\npurchasing for their employees--\"\n\n\"Ah-ha!\"\n\n\"--but that's because there's nothing like a tickler for teaching a\nnew man his job. It tells him from instant to instant what he must\ndo--while he's already on the job and without disturbing other\nworkers. Magnetizing a wire with a job pattern is the easiest thing\ngoing. And you'd be astonished what the subliminals do for employee\nmorale. It's this way, Gussy: most people are too improvident and\nunimaginative to see in advance the advantages of ticklers. They buy\none because the company strongly suggests it and payment is on easy\ninstallments withheld from salary. They find a tickler makes the work\nday go easier. The little fellow perched on your shoulder is a friend\nexuding comfort and good advice. The first thing he's set to say is\n'Take it easy, pal.'\n\n\"Within a week they're wearing their tickler 24 hours a day--and\nbuying a tickler for the wife, so she'll remember to comb her hair and\nsmile real pretty and cook favorite dishes.\"\n\n\"I get it, Fay,\" Gusterson cut in. \"The tickler is the newest fad for\nincreasing worker efficiency. Once, I read somewheres, it was salt\ntablets. They had salt-tablet dispensers everywhere, even in\nair-conditioned offices where there wasn't a moist armpit twice a year\nand the gals sweat only champagne. A decade later people wondered what\nall those dusty white pills were for. Sometimes they were mistook for\ntranquilizers. It'll be the same way with ticklers. Somebody'll open a\nmusty closet and see jumbled heaps of these gripping-hand silvery\ngadgets gathering dust curls and--\"\n\n\"They will not!\" Fay protested vehemently. \"Ticklers are not a\nfad--they're history-changers, they're Free-World revolutionary! Why,\nbefore Micro Systems put a single one on the market, we'd made it a\nrule that every Micro employee had to wear one! If that's not having\nsupreme confidence in a product--\"\n\n\"Every employee except the top executives, of course,\" Gusterson\ninterrupted jeeringly. \"And that's not demoting you, Fay. As the R & D\nchief most closely involved, you'd naturally have to show special\nenthusiasm.\"\n\n\"But you're wrong there, Gussy,\" Fay crowed. \"Man for man, our top\nexecutives have been more enthusiastic about their personal ticklers\nthan any other class of worker in the whole outfit.\"\n\nGusterson slumped and shook his head. \"If that's the case,\" he said\ndarkly, \"maybe mankind deserves the tickler.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'll say it does!\" Fay agreed loudly without thinking. Then, \"Oh, can\nthe carping, Gussy. Tickler's a great invention. Don't deprecate it\njust because you had something to do with its genesis. You're going to\nhave to get in the swim and wear one.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'd rather drown horribly.\"\n\n\"Can the gloom-talk too! Gussy, I said it before and I say it again,\nyou're just scared of this new thing. Why, you've even got the drapes\npulled so you won't have to look at the tickler factory.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am scared,\" Gusterson said. \"Really sca ... AWP!\"\n\nFay whirled around. Daisy was standing in the bedroom doorway, wearing\nthe short silver sheath. This time there was no mask, but her bobbed\nhair was glitteringly silvered, while her legs, arms, hands, neck,\nface--every bit of her exposed skin--was painted with beautifully even\nvertical green stripes.\n\n\"I did it as a surprise for Gusterson,\" she explained to Fay. \"He says\nhe likes me this way. The green glop's supposed to be smudgeproof.\"\n\nGusterson did not comment. His face had a rapt expression. \"I'll tell\nyou why your tickler's so popular, Fay,\" he said softly. \"It's not\nbecause it backstops the memory or because it boosts the ego with\nsubliminals. It's because it takes the hook out of a guy, it takes\nover the job of withstanding the pressure of living. See, Fay, here\nare all these little guys in this subterranean rat race with\natomic-death squares and chromium-plated reward squares and enough\nmoney if you pass Go almost to get to Go again--and a million million\nrules of the game to keep in mind. Well, here's this one little guy\nand every morning he wakes up there's all these things he's got to\nkeep in mind to do or he'll lose his turn three times in a row and\nmaybe a terrible black rook in iron armor'll loom up and bang him off\nthe chessboard. But now, look, now he's got his tickler and he tells\nhis sweet silver tickler all these things and the tickler's got to\nremember them. Of course he'll have to do them eventually but\nmeanwhile the pressure's off him, the hook's out of his short hairs.\nHe's shifted the responsibility....\"\n\n\"Well, what's so bad about that?\" Fay broke in loudly. \"What's wrong\nwith taking the pressure off little guys? Why shouldn't Tickler be a\nsuper-ego surrogate? Micro's Motivations chief noticed that positive\nfeature straight off and scored it three pluses. Besides, it's nothing\nbut a gaudy way of saying that Tickler backstops the memory.\nSeriously, Gussy, what's so bad about it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Gusterson said slowly, his eyes still far away. \"I\njust know it feels bad to me.\" He crinkled his big forehead. \"Well for\none thing,\" he said, \"it means that a man's taking orders from\nsomething else. He's got a kind of master. He's sinking back into a\nslave psychology.\"\n\n\"He's only taking orders from himself,\" Fay countered disgustedly.\n\"Tickler's just a mech reminder, a notebook, in essence no more than\nthe back of an old envelope. It's no master.\"\n\n\"Are you absolutely sure of that?\" Gusterson asked quietly.\n\n\"Why, Gussy, you big oaf--\" Fay began heatedly. Suddenly his features\nquirked and he twitched. \"'Scuse me, folks,\" he said rapidly, heading\nfor the door, \"but my tickler told me I gotta go.\"\n\n\"Hey Fay, don't you mean you told your tickler to tell you when it was\ntime to go?\" Gusterson called after him.\n\nFay looked back in the doorway. He wet his lips, his eyes moved from\nside to side. \"I'm not quite sure,\" he said in an odd strained voice\nand darted out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGusterson stared for some seconds at the pattern of emptiness Fay had\nleft. Then he shivered. Then he shrugged. \"I must be slipping,\" he\nmuttered. \"I never even suggested something for him to invent.\" Then\nhe looked around at Daisy, who was still standing poker-faced in her\ndoorway.\n\n\"Hey, you look like something out of the Arabian Nights,\" he told her.\n\"Are you supposed to be anything special? How far do those stripes go,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"You could probably find out,\" she told him coolly. \"All you have to\ndo is kill me a dragon or two first.\"\n\nHe studied her. \"My God,\" he said reverently, \"I really have all the\nfun in life. What do I do to deserve this?\"\n\n\"You've got a big gun,\" she told him, \"and you go out in the world\nwith it and hold up big companies and take yards and yards of money\naway from them in rolls like ribbon and bring it all home to me.\"\n\n\"Don't say that about the gun again,\" he said. \"Don't whisper it,\ndon't even think it. I've got one, dammit--thirty-eight caliber,\nyet--and I don't want some psionic monitor with two-way clairaudience\nthey haven't told me about catching the whisper and coming to take the\ngun away from us. It's one of the few individuality symbols we've got\nleft.\"\n\nSuddenly Daisy whirled away from the door, spun three times so that\nher silvered hair stood out like a metal coolie hat, and sank to a\ncurtsey in the middle of the room.\n\n\"I've just thought of what I am,\" she announced, fluttering her\neyelashes at him. \"I'm a sweet silver tickler with green stripes.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nNext day Daisy cashed the Micro check for ten hundred silver smackers,\nwhich she hid in a broken radionic coffee urn. Gusterson sold his\ninsanity novel and started a new one about a mad medic with a hiccupy\nhysterical chuckle, who gimmicked Moodmasters to turn mental patients\ninto nymphomaniacs, mass murderers and compulsive saints. But this\ntime he couldn't get Fay out of his mind, or the last chilling words\nthe nervous little man had spoken.\n\nFor that matter, he couldn't blank the underground out of his mind as\neffectively as usually. He had the feeling that a new kind of mole was\nloose in the burrows and that the ground at the foot of their\nskyscraper might start humping up any minute.\n\nToward the end of one afternoon he tucked a half dozen newly typed\nsheets in his pocket, shrouded his typer, went to the hatrack and took\ndown his prize: a miner's hard-top cap with electric headlamp.\n\n\"Goin' below, Cap'n,\" he shouted toward the kitchen.\n\n\"Be back for second dog watch,\" Daisy replied. \"Remember what I told\nyou about lassoing me some art-conscious girl neighbors.\"\n\n\"Only if I meet a piebald one with a taste for Scotch--or maybe a\npearl gray biped jaguar with violet spots,\" Gusterson told her,\nclapping on the cap with a We-Who-Are-About-To-Die gesture.\n\nHalfway across the park to the escalator bunker Gusterson's heart\nbegan to tick. He resolutely switched on his headlamp.\n\nAs he'd known it would, the hatch robot whirred an extra and\nhigher-pitched ten seconds when it came to his topside address, but it\nultimately dilated the hatch for him, first handing him a claim check\nfor his ID card.\n\nGusterson's heart was ticking like a sledgehammer by now. He hopped\nclumsily onto the escalator, clutched the moving guard rail to either\nside, then shut his eyes as the steps went over the edge and became\nwhat felt like vertical. An instant later he forced his eyes open,\nunclipped a hand from the rail and touched the second switch beside\nhis headlamp, which instantly began to blink whitely, as if he were a\ncivilian plane flying into a nest of military jobs.\n\nWith a further effort he kept his eyes open and flinchingly surveyed\nthe scene around him. After zigging through a bombproof half-furlong\nof roof, he was dropping into a large twilit cave. The blue-black\nceiling twinkled with stars. The walls were pierced at floor level by\na dozen archways with busy niche stores and glowing advertisements\ncrowded between them. From the archways some three dozen slidewalks\ncurved out, tangenting off each other in a bewildering multiple\ncloverleaf. The slidewalks were packed with people, traveling\nmotionless like purposeful statues or pivoting with practiced grace\nfrom one slidewalk to another, like a thousand toreros doing\nveronicas.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe slidewalks were moving faster than he recalled from his last\nventure underground and at the same time the whole pedestrian\nconcourse was quieter than he remembered. It was as if the five\nthousand or so moles in view were all listening--for what? But there\nwas something else that had changed about them--a change that he\ncouldn't for a moment define, or unconsciously didn't want to.\nClothing style? No ... My God, they weren't all wearing identical\nmonster masks? No ... Hair color?... Well....\n\nHe was studying them so intently that he forgot his escalator was\nlanding. He came off it with a heel-jarring stumble and bumped into a\nknot of four men on the tiny triangular hold-still. These four at\nleast sported a new style-wrinkle: ribbed gray shoulder-capes that\nmade them look as if their heads were poking up out of the center of\nbulgy umbrellas or giant mushrooms.\n\nOne of them grabbed hold of Gusterson and saved him from staggering\nonto a slidewalk that might have carried him to Toledo.\n\n\"Gussy, you dog, you must have esped I wanted to see you,\" Fay cried,\npatting him on the elbows. \"Meet Davidson and Kester and Hazen,\ncolleagues of mine. We're all Micro-men.\" Fay's companions were\nstaring strangely at Gusterson's blinking headlamp. Fay explained\nrapidly, \"Mr. Gusterson is an insanity novelist. You know, I-D.\"\n\n\"Inner-directed spells _id_,\" Gusterson said absently, still staring\nat the interweaving crowd beyond them, trying to figure out what made\nthem different from last trip. \"Creativity fuel. Cranky. Explodes\nthrough the parietal fissure if you look at it cross-eyed.\"\n\n\"Ha-ha,\" Fay laughed. \"Well, boys, I've found my man. How's the new\nnovel perking, Gussy?\"\n\n\"Got my climax, I think,\" Gusterson mumbled, still peering puzzledly\naround Fay at the slidestanders. \"Moodmaster's going to come alive.\nEver occur to you that 'mood' is 'doom' spelled backwards? And\nthen....\" He let his voice trail off as he realized that Kester and\nDavidson and Hazen had made their farewells and were sliding into the\ndistance. He reminded himself wryly that nobody ever wants to hear an\nauthor talk--he's much too good a listener to be wasted that way.\nLet's see, was it that everybody in the crowd had the same facial\nexpression...? Or showed symptoms of the same disease...?\n\n\"I was coming to visit you, but now you can pay me a call,\" Fay was\nsaying. \"There are two matters I want to--\"\n\nGusterson stiffened. \"My God, _they're all hunchbacked_!\" he yelled.\n\n\"Shh! Of course they are,\" Fay whispered reprovingly. \"They're all\nwearing their ticklers. But you don't need to be insulting about it.\"\n\n\"_I'm gettin' out o' here._\" Gusterson turned to flee as if from five\nthousand Richard the Thirds.\n\n\"Oh no you're not,\" Fay amended, drawing him back with one hand.\nSomehow, underground, the little man seemed to carry more weight.\n\"You're having cocktails in my thinking box. Besides, climbing a down\nescaladder will give you a heart attack.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his home habitat Gusterson was about as easy to handle as a rogue\nrhinoceros, but away from it--and especially if underground--he became\nmore like a pliable elephant. All his bones dropped out through his feet,\nas he described it to Daisy. So now he submitted miserably as Fay\nsurveyed him up and down, switched off his blinking headlamp (\"That\ncoalminer caper is corny, Gussy.\") and then--surprisingly--rapidly\nstuffed his belt-bag under the right shoulder of Gusterson's coat and\nbuttoned the latter to hold it in place.\n\n\"So you won't stand out,\" he explained. Another swift survey. \"You'll\ndo. Come on, Gussy. I got lots to brief you on.\" Three rapid paces and\nthen Gusterson's feet would have gone out from under him except that\nFay gave him a mighty shove. The small man sprang onto the slidewalk\nafter him and then they were skimming effortlessly side by side.\n\nGusterson felt frightened and twice as hunchbacked as the\nslidestanders around him--morally as well as physically.\n\nNevertheless he countered bravely, \"I got things to brief _you_ on. I\ngot six pages of cautions on ti--\"\n\n\"Shh!\" Fay stopped him. \"Let's use my hushbox.\"\n\nHe drew out his pancake phone and stretched it so that it covered both\ntheir lower faces, like a double yashmak. Gusterson, his neck pushing\ninto the ribbed bulge of the shoulder cape so he could be cheek to\ncheek with Fay, felt horribly conspicuous, but then he noticed that\nnone of the slidestanders were paying them the least attention. The\nreason for their abstraction occurred to him. They were listening to\ntheir ticklers! He shuddered.\n\n\"I got six pages of caution on ticklers,\" he repeated into the hot,\nmoist quiet of the pancake phone. \"I typed 'em so I wouldn't forget\n'em in the heat of polemicking. I want you to read every word. Fay,\nI've had it on my mind ever since I started wondering whether it was\nyou or your tickler made you duck out of our place last time you were\nthere. I want you to--\"\n\n\"Ha-ha! All in good time.\" In the pancake phone Fay's laugh was\nbrassy. \"But I'm glad you've decided to lend a hand, Gussy. This thing\nis moving faaaasst. Nationwise, adult underground ticklerization is 90\nper cent complete.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that,\" Gusterson protested while glaring at the\nhunchbacks around them. The slidewalk was gliding down a low\nglow-ceiling tunnel lined with doors and advertisements. Rapt-eyed\npeople were pirouetting on and off. \"A thing just can't develop that\nfast, Fay. It's against nature.\"\n\n\"Ha, but we're not in nature, we're in culture. The progress of an\nindustrial scientific culture is geometric. It goes n-times as many\njumps as it takes. More than geometric--exponential. Confidentially,\nMicro's Math chief tells me we're currently on a fourth-power progress\ncurve trending into a fifth.\"\n\n\"You mean we're goin' so fast we got to watch out we don't bump\nourselves in the rear when we come around again?\" Gusterson asked,\nscanning the tunnel ahead for curves. \"Or just shoot straight up to\ninfinity?\"\n\n\"Exactly! Of course most of the last power and a half is due to\nTickler itself. Gussy, the tickler's already eliminated absenteeism,\nalcoholism and aboulia in numerous urban areas--and that's just one\nletter of the alphabet! If Tickler doesn't turn us into a nation of\nphoto-memory constant-creative-flow geniuses in six months, I'll come\nlive topside.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You mean because a lot of people are standing around glassy-eyed\nlistening to something mumbling in their ear that it's a good thing?\"\n\n\"Gussy, you don't know progress when you see it. Tickler is the\ngreatest invention since language. Bar none, it's the greatest\ninstrument ever devised for integrating a man into all phases of his\nenvironment. Under the present routine a newly purchased tickler first\ngoes to government and civilian defense for primary patterning, then\nto the purchaser's employer, then to his doctor-psycher, then to his\nlocal bunker captain, then to _him_. _Everything_ that's needful for a\nman's welfare gets on the spools. Efficiency cubed! Incidentally,\nRussia's got the tickler now. Our dip-satellites have photographed it.\nIt's like ours except the Commies wear it on the left shoulder ... but\nthey're two weeks behind us developmentwise and they'll never close\nthe gap!\"\n\nGusterson reared up out of the pancake phone to take a deep breath. A\nsulky-lipped sylph-figured girl two feet from him twitched--medium\ncootch, he judged--then fumbled in her belt-bag for a pill and popped\nit in her mouth.\n\n\"Hell, the tickler's not even efficient yet about little things,\"\nGusterson blatted, diving back into the privacy-yashmak he was sharing\nwith Fay. \"Whyn't that girl's doctor have the Moodmaster component of\nher tickler inject her with medicine?\"\n\n\"Her doctor probably wants her to have the discipline of\npill-taking--or the exercise,\" Fay answered glibly. \"Look sharp now.\nHere's where we fork. I'm taking you through Micro's postern.\"\n\nA ribbon of slidewalk split itself from the main band and angled off\ninto a short alley. Gusterson hardly felt the constant-speed juncture\nas they crossed it. Then the secondary ribbon speeded up, carrying\nthem at about 30 feet a second toward the blank concrete wall in which\nthe alley ended. Gusterson prepared to jump, but Fay grabbed him with\none hand and with the other held up toward the wall a badge and a\nbutton. When they were about ten feet away the wall whipped aside,\nthen whipped shut behind them so fast that Gusterson wondered\nmomentarily if he still had his heels and the seat of his pants.\n\nFay, tucking away his badge and pancake phone, dropped the button in\nGusterson's vest pocket. \"Use it when you leave,\" he said casually.\n\"That is, if you leave.\"\n\nGusterson, who was trying to read the Do and Don't posters papering\nthe walls they were passing, started to probe that last sinister\nsupposition, but just then the ribbon slowed, a swinging door opened\nand closed behind them and they found themselves in a luxuriously\nfurnished thinking box measuring at least eight feet by five.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hey, this is something,\" Gusterson said appreciatively to show he\nwasn't an utter yokel. Then, drawing on research he'd done for period\nnovels, \"Why, it's as big as a Pullman car compartment, or a first\nmate's cabin in the War of 1812. You really must rate.\"\n\nFay nodded, smiled wanly and sat down with a sigh on a compact\noverstuffed swivel chair. He let his arms dangle and his head sink\ninto his puffed shoulder cape. Gusterson stared at him. It was the\nfirst time he could ever recall the little man showing fatigue.\n\n\"Tickler currently does have one serious drawback,\" Fay volunteered.\n\"It weighs 28 pounds. You feel it when you've been on your feet a\ncouple of hours. No question we're going to give the next model that\nantigravity feature you mentioned for pursuit grenades. We'd have had\nit in this model except there were so many other things to be\nincorporated.\" He sighed again. \"Why, the scanning and decision-making\nelements alone tripled the mass.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Gusterson protested, thinking especially of the sulky-lipped\ngirl, \"do you mean to tell me all those other people were toting two\nstone?\"\n\nFay shook his head heavily. \"They were all wearing Mark 3 or 4. I'm\nwearing Mark 6,\" he said, as one might say, \"I'm carrying the genuine\nCross, not one of the balsa ones.\"\n\nBut then his face brightened a little and he went on. \"Of course the\nnew improved features make it more than worth it ... and you hardly\nfeel it at all at night when you're lying down ... and if you remember\nto talcum under it twice a day, no sores develop ... at least not very\nbig ones....\"\n\nBacking away involuntarily, Gusterson felt something prod his right\nshoulderblade. Ripping open his coat, he convulsively plunged his hand\nunder it and tore out Fay's belt-bag ... and then set it down very\ngently on the top of a shallow cabinet and relaxed with the sigh of\none who has escaped a great, if symbolic, danger. Then he remembered\nsomething Fay had mentioned. He straightened again.\n\n\"Hey, you said it's got scanning and decision-making elements. That\nmeans your tickler thinks, even by your fancy standards. And if it\nthinks, it's conscious.\"\n\n\"Gussy,\" Fay said wearily, frowning, \"all sorts of things nowadays\nhave S&DM elements. Mail sorters, missiles, robot medics, high-style\nmannequins, just to name some of the Ms. They 'think,' to use that\narchaic word, but it's neither here nor there. And they're certainly\nnot conscious.\"\n\n\"Your tickler thinks,\" Gusterson repeated stubbornly, \"just like I\nwarned you it would. It sits on your shoulder, ridin' you like you was\na pony or a starved St. Bernard, and now it thinks.\"\n\n\"Suppose it does?\" Fay yawned. \"What of it?\" He gave a rapid sinuous\none-sided shrug that made it look for a moment as if his left arm had\nthree elbows. It stuck in Gusterson's mind, for he had never seen Fay\nuse such a gesture and he wondered where he'd picked it up. Maybe\nimitating a double-jointed Micro Finance chief? Fay yawned again and\nsaid, \"Please, Gussy, don't disturb me for a minute or so.\" His eyes\nhalf closed.\n\nGusterson studied Fay's sunken-cheeked face and the great puff of his\nshoulder cape.\n\n\"Say, Fay,\" he asked in a soft voice after about five minutes, \"are\nyou meditating?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" Fay responded, starting up and then stifling another yawn.\n\"Just resting a bit. I seem to get more tired these days, somehow.\nYou'll have to excuse me, Gussy. But what made you think of\nmeditation?\"\n\n\"Oh, I just got to wonderin' in that direction,\" Gusterson said. \"You\nsee, when you first started to develop Tickler, it occurred to me that\nthere was one thing about it that might be real good even if you did\ngive it S&DM elements. It's this: having a mech secretary to take\ncharge of his obligations and routine in the real world might allow a\nman to slide into the other world, the world of thoughts and feelings\nand intuitions, and sort of ooze around in there and accomplish\nthings. Know any of the people using Tickler that way, hey?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Fay denied with a bright incredulous laugh. \"Who'd\nwant to loaf around in an imaginary world and take a chance of\n_missing out on what his tickler's doing_?--I mean, on what his\ntickler has in store for him--what he's _told_ his tickler to have in\nstore for him.\"\n\nIgnoring Gusterson's shiver, Fay straightened up and seemed to brisken\nhimself. \"Ha, that little slump did me good. A tickler _makes_ you\nrest, you know--it's one of the great things about it. Pooh-Bah's\nkinder to me than I ever was to myself.\" He buttoned open a tiny\nrefrigerator and took out two waxed cardboard cubes and handed one to\nGusterson. \"Martini? Hope you don't mind drinking from the carton.\nCheers. Now, Gussy old pal, there are two matters I want to take up\nwith you--\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" Gusterson said with something of his old authority.\n\"There's something I got to get off my mind first.\" He pulled the\ntyped pages out of his inside pocket and straightened them. \"I told\nyou about these,\" he said. \"I want you to read them before you do\nanything else. Here.\"\n\nFay looked toward the pages and nodded, but did not take them yet. He\nlifted his hands to his throat and unhooked the clasp of his cape,\nthen hesitated.\n\n\"You wear that thing to hide the hump your tickler makes?\" Gusterson\nfilled in. \"You got better taste than those other moles.\"\n\n\"Not to hide it, exactly,\" Fay protested, \"but just so the others\nwon't be jealous. I wouldn't feel comfortable parading a free-scanning\ndecision-capable Mark 6 tickler in front of people who can't buy\nit--until it goes on open sale at twenty-two fifteen tonight. Lot of\nshelterfolk won't be sleeping tonight. They'll be queued up to trade\nin their old tickler for a Mark 6 almost as good as Pooh-Bah.\"\n\nHe started to jerk his hands apart, hesitated again with an oddly\napprehensive look at the big man, then whirled off the cape.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nGusterson sucked in such a big gasp that he hiccuped. The right\nshoulder of Fay's jacket and shirt had been cut away. Thrusting up\nthrough the neatly hemmed hole was a silvery gray hump with a one-eyed\nturret atop it and two multi-jointed metal arms ending in little\nclaws.\n\nIt looked like the top half of a pseudo-science robot--a squat evil\nchild robot, Gusterson told himself, which had lost its legs in a\nrailway accident--and it seemed to him that a red fleck was moving\naround imperceptibly in the huge single eye.\n\n\"I'll take that memo now,\" Fay said coolly, reaching out his hand. He\ncaught the rustling sheets as they slipped from Gusterson's fingers,\nevened them up very precisely by tapping them on his knee ... and then\nhanded them over his shoulder to his tickler, which clicked its claws\naround either margin and then began rather swiftly to lift the top\nsheet past its single eye at a distance of about six inches.\n\n\"The first matter I want to take up with you, Gussy,\" Fay began,\npaying no attention whatsoever to the little scene on his shoulder,\n\"--or warn you about, rather--is the imminent ticklerization of\nschoolchildren, geriatrics, convicts and topsiders. At three zero zero\ntomorrow ticklers become mandatory for all adult shelterfolk. The\nmop-up operations won't be long in coming--in fact, these days we find\nthat the square root of the estimated time of a new development is\ngenerally the best time estimate. Gussy, I strongly advise you to\nstart wearing a tickler now. And Daisy and your moppets. If you heed\nmy advice, your kids will have the jump on your class. Transition and\nconditioning are easy, since Tickler itself sees to it.\"\n\nPooh-Bah leafed the first page to the back of the packet and began\nlifting the second past his eye--a little more swiftly than the first.\n\n\"I've got a Mark 6 tickler all warmed up for you,\" Fay pressed, \"_and_\na shoulder cape. You won't feel one bit conspicuous.\" He noticed the\ndirection of Gusterson's gaze and remarked, \"Fascinating mechanism,\nisn't it? Of course 28 pounds are a bit oppressive, but then you have\nto remember it's only a way-station to free-floating Mark 7 or 8.\"\n\nPooh-Bah finished page two and began to race through page three.\n\n\"But I wanted _you_ to read it,\" Gusterson said bemusedly, staring.\n\n\"Pooh-Bah will do a better job than I could,\" Fay assured him. \"Get\nthe gist without losing the chaff.\"\n\n\"But dammit, it's all about _him_,\" Gusterson said a little more\nstrongly. \"He won't be objective about it.\"\n\n\"A better job,\" Fay reiterated, \"_and_ more fully objective.\nPooh-Bah's set for full precis. Stop worrying about it. He's a\ndispassionate machine, not a fallible, emotionally disturbed human\nmisled by the will-o'-the-wisp of consciousness. Second matter: Micro\nSystems is impressed by your contributions to Tickler and will recruit\nyou as a senior consultant with a salary and thinking box as big as my\nown, family quarters to match. It's an unheard-of high start. Gussy, I\nthink you'd be a fool--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe broke off, held up a hand for silence, and his eyes got a listening\nlook. Pooh-Bah had finished page six and was holding the packet\nmotionless. After about ten seconds Fay's face broke into a big fake\nsmile. He stood up, suppressing a wince, and held out his hand.\n\"Gussy,\" he said loudly, \"I am happy to inform you that all your fears\nabout Tickler are so much thistledown. My word on it. There's nothing\nto them at all. Pooh-Bah's precis, which he's just given to me, proves\nit.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Gusterson said solemnly, \"there's one thing I want you to do.\nPurely to humor an old friend. But I want you to do it. _Read that\nmemo yourself._\"\n\n\"Certainly I will, Gussy,\" Fay continued in the same ebullient tones.\n\"I'll read it--\" he twitched and his smile disappeared--\"a little\nlater.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Gusterson said dully, holding his hand to his stomach. \"And\nnow if you don't mind, Fay, I'm goin' home. I feel just a bit sick.\nMaybe the ozone and the other additives in your shelter air are too\nheady for me. It's been years since I tramped through a pine forest.\"\n\n\"But Gussy! You've hardly got here. You haven't even sat down. Have\nanother martini. Have a seltzer pill. Have a whiff of oxy. Have a--\"\n\n\"No, Fay, I'm going home right away. I'll think about the job offer.\n_Remember to read that memo._\"\n\n\"I will, Gussy, I certainly will. You know your way? The button takes\nyou through the wall. 'By, now.\"\n\nHe sat down abruptly and looked away. Gusterson pushed through the\nswinging door. He tensed himself for the step across onto the\nslowly-moving reverse ribbon. Then on a impulse he pushed ajar the\nswinging door and looked back inside.\n\nFay was sitting as he'd left him, apparently lost in listless\nbrooding. On his shoulder Pooh-Bah was rapidly crossing and uncrossing\nits little metal arms, tearing the memo to smaller and smaller shreds.\nIt let the scraps drift slowly toward the floor and oddly writhed its\nthree-elbowed left arm ... and then Gusterson knew from whom, or\nrather from what, Fay had copied his new shrug.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nWhen Gusterson got home toward the end of the second dog watch, he\nslipped aside from Daisy's questions and set the children laughing\nwith a graphic enactment of his slidestanding technique and a story\nabout getting his head caught in a thinking box built for a midget\nphysicist. After supper he played with Imogene, Iago and Claudius\nuntil it was their bedtime and thereafter was unusually attentive to\nDaisy, admiring her fading green stripes, though he did spend a while\nin the next apartment, where they stored their outdoor camping\nequipment.\n\nBut the next morning he announced to the children that it was a\nholiday--the Feast of St. Gusterson--and then took Daisy into the\nbedroom and told her everything.\n\nWhen he'd finished she said, \"This is something I've got to see for\nmyself.\"\n\nGusterson shrugged. \"If you think you've got to. I say we should head\nfor the hills right now. One thing I'm standing on: the kids aren't\ngoing back to school.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Daisy said. \"But, Gusterson, we've lived through a lot of\nthings without leaving home altogether. We lived through the\nEverybody-Six-Feet-Underground-by-Christmas campaign and the Robot\nWatchdog craze, when you got your left foot half chewed off. We lived\nthrough the Venomous Bats and Indoctrinated Saboteur Rats and the\nHypnotized Monkey Paratrooper scares. We lived through the Voice of\nSafety and Anti-Communist Somno-Instruction and Rightest Pills and\nJet-Propelled Vigilantes. We lived through the Cold-Out, when you\nweren't supposed to turn on a toaster for fear its heat would be a\ntarget for prowl missiles and when people with fevers were unpopular.\nWe lived through--\"\n\nGusterson patted her hand. \"You go below,\" he said. \"Come back when\nyou've decided this is different. Come back as soon as you can anyway.\nI'll be worried about you every minute you're down there.\"\n\nWhen she was gone--in a green suit and hat to minimize or at least\njustify the effect of the faded stripes--Gusterson doled out to the\nchildren provender and equipment for a camping expedition to the next\nfloor. Iago led them off in stealthy Indian file. Leaving the hall\ndoor open Gusterson got out his .38 and cleaned and loaded it,\nmeanwhile concentrating on a chess problem with the idea of confusing\na hypothetical psionic monitor. By the time he had hid the revolver\nagain he heard the elevator creaking back up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaisy came dragging in without her hat, looking as if she'd been\nconcentrating on a chess problem for hours herself and just now given\nup. Her stripes seemed to have vanished; then Gusterson decided this\nwas because her whole complexion was a touch green.\n\nShe sat down on the edge of the couch and said without looking at him,\n\"Did you tell me, Gusterson, that everybody was quiet and abstracted\nand orderly down below, especially the ones wearing ticklers, meaning\npretty much everybody?\"\n\n\"I did,\" he said. \"I take it that's no longer the case. What are the\nnew symptoms?\"\n\nShe gave no indication. After some time she said, \"Gusterson, do you\nremember the Dor\u00e9 illustrations to the _Inferno_? Can you visualize\nthe paintings of Hieronymous Bosch with the hordes of proto-Freudian\ndevils tormenting people all over the farmyard and city square? Did\nyou ever see the Disney animations of Moussorgsky's witches' sabbath\nmusic? Back in the foolish days before you married me, did that\ndrug-addict girl friend of yours ever take you to a genuine orgy?\"\n\n\"As bad as that, hey?\"\n\nShe nodded emphatically and all of a sudden shivered violently.\n\"Several shades worse,\" she said. \"If they decide to come topside--\"\nShe shot up. \"Where are the kids?\"\n\n\"Upstairs campin' in the mysterious wilderness of the 21st floor,\"\nGusterson reassured her. \"Let's leave 'em there until we're ready\nto--\"\n\nHe broke off. They both heard the faint sound of thudding footsteps.\n\n\"They're on the stairs,\" Daisy whispered, starting to move toward the\nopen door. \"But are they coming from up or down?\"\n\n\"It's just one person,\" judged Gusterson, moving after his wife. \"Too\nheavy for one of the kids.\"\n\nThe footsteps doubled in volume and came rapidly closer. Along with\nthem there was an agonized gasping. Daisy stopped, staring fearfully\nat the open doorway. Gusterson moved past her. Then he stopped too.\n\nFay stumbled into view and would have fallen on his face except he\nclutched both sides of the doorway halfway up. He was stripped to the\nwaist. There was a little blood on his shoulder. His narrow chest was\narching convulsively, the ribs standing out starkly, as he sucked in\noxygen to replace what he'd burned up running up twenty flights. His\neyes were wild.\n\n\"They've taken over,\" he panted. Another gobbling breath. \"Gone\ncrazy.\" Two more gasps. \"Gotta stop 'em.\"\n\nHis eyes filmed. He swayed forward. Then Gusterson's big arms were\naround him and he was carrying him to the couch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDaisy came running from the kitchen with a damp cool towel. Gusterson\ntook it from her and began to mop Fay off. He sucked in his own breath\nas he saw that Fay's right ear was raw and torn. He whispered to\nDaisy, \"Look at where the thing savaged him.\"\n\nThe blood on Fay's shoulder came from his ear. Some of it stained a\nflush-skin plastic fitting that had two small valved holes in it and\nthat puzzled Gusterson until he remembered that Moodmaster tied into\nthe bloodstream. For a second he thought he was going to vomit.\n\nThe dazed look slid aside from Fay's eyes. He was gasping less\npainfully now. He sat up, pushing the towel away, buried his face in\nhis hands for a few seconds, then looked over the fingers at the two\nof them.\n\n\"I've been living in a nightmare for the last week,\" he said in a taut\nsmall voice, \"knowing the thing had come alive and trying to pretend\nto myself that it hadn't. Knowing it was taking charge of me more and\nmore. Having it whisper in my ear, over and over again, in a cracked\nlittle rhyme that I could only hear every hundredth time, 'Day by day,\nin every way, you're learning to listen ... and _obey_. Day by day--'\"\n\nHis voice started to go high. He pulled it down and continued harshly,\n\"I ditched it this morning when I showered. It let me break contact to\ndo that. It must have figured it had complete control of me, mounted\nor dismounted. I think it's telepathic, and then it did some, well,\nrather unpleasant things to me late last night. But I pulled together\nmy fears and my will and I ran for it. The slidewalks were chaos. The\nMark 6 ticklers showed some purpose, though I couldn't tell you what,\nbut as far as I could see the Mark 3s and 4s were just cootching their\nmounts to death--Chinese feather torture. Giggling, gasping, choking\n... gales of mirth. People are dying of laughter ... ticklers!... the\nirony of it! It was the complete lack of order and sanity and that let\nme get topside. There were things I saw--\" Once again his voice went\nshrill. He clapped his hand to his mouth and rocked back and forth on\nthe couch.\n\nGusterson gently but firmly laid a hand on his good shoulder.\n\"Steady,\" he said. \"Here, swallow this.\"\n\nFay shoved aside the short brown drink. \"We've got to stop them,\" he\ncried. \"Mobilize the topsiders--contact the wilderness patrols and\nmanned satellites--pour ether in the tunnel airpumps--invent and\ncrash-manufacture missiles that will home on ticklers without harming\nhumans--SOS Mars and Venus--dope the shelter water supply--do\nsomething! Gussy, you don't realize what people are going through down\nthere every second.\"\n\n\"I think they're experiencing the ultimate in outer-directedness,\"\nGusterson said gruffly.\n\n\"Have you no heart?\" Fay demanded. His eyes widened, as if he were\nseeing Gusterson for the first time. Then, accusingly, pointing a\nshaking finger: \"_You invented the tickler, George Gusterson! It's all\nyour fault! You've got to do something about it!_\"\n\nBefore Gusterson could retort to that, or begin to think of a reply,\nor even assimilate the full enormity of Fay's statement, he was\ngrabbed from behind and frog-marched away from Fay and something that\nfelt remarkably like the muzzle of a large-caliber gun was shoved in\nthe small of his back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder cover of Fay's outburst a huge crowd of people had entered the\nroom from the hall--eight, to be exact. But the weirdest thing about\nthem to Gusterson was that from the first instant he had the\nimpression that only one mind had entered the room and that it did not\nreside in any of the eight persons, even though he recognized three of\nthem, but in something that they were carrying.\n\nSeveral things contributed to this impression. The eight people all\nhad the same blank expression--watchful yet empty-eyed. They all moved\nin the same slithery crouch. And they had all taken off their shoes.\nPerhaps, Gusterson thought wildly, they believed he and Daisy ran a\nJapanese flat.\n\nGusterson was being held by two burly women, one of them quite pimply.\nHe considered stamping on her toes, but just at that moment the gun\ndug in his back with a corkscrew movement.\n\nThe man holding the gun on him was Fay's colleague Davidson. Some\nyards beyond Fay's couch, Kester was holding a gun on Daisy, without\ndigging it into her, while the single strange man holding Daisy\nherself was doing so quite decorously--a circumstance which afforded\nGusterson minor relief, since it made him feel less guilty about not\ngoing berserk.\n\nTwo more strange men, one of them in purple lounging pajamas, the\nother in the gray uniform of a slidewalk inspector, had grabbed Fay's\nskinny upper arms, one on either side, and were lifting him to his\nfeet, while Fay was struggling with such desperate futility and\ngibbering so pitifully that Gusterson momentarily had second thoughts\nabout the moral imperative to go berserk when menaced by hostile\nforce. But again the gun dug into him with a twist.\n\nApproaching Fay face-on was the third Micro-man Gusterson had met\nyesterday--Hazen. It was Hazen who was carrying--quite reverently or\nsolemnly--or at any rate very carefully the object that seemed to\nGusterson to be the mind of the little storm troop presently\ndesecrating the sanctity of his own individual home.\n\nAll of them were wearing ticklers, of course--the three Micro-men the\nheavy emergent Mark 6s with their clawed and jointed arms and\nmonocular cephalic turrets, the rest lower-numbered Marks of the sort\nthat merely made Richard-the-Third humps under clothing.\n\nThe object that Hazen was carrying was the Mark 6 tickler Gusterson\nhad seen Fay wearing yesterday. Gusterson was sure it was Pooh-Bah\nbecause of its air of command, and because he would have sworn on a\nmountain of Bibles that he recognized the red fleck lurking in the\nback of its single eye. And Pooh-Bah alone had the aura of full\nconscious thought. Pooh-Bah alone had mana.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is not good to see an evil legless child robot with dangling straps\nbossing--apparently by telepathic power--not only three objects of its\nown kind and five close primitive relatives, but also eight human\nbeings ... and in addition throwing into a state of twitching terror\none miserable, thin-chested, half-crazy research-and-development\ndirector.\n\nPooh-Bah pointed a claw at Fay. Fay's handlers dragged him forward,\nstill resisting but more feebly now, as if half-hypnotized or at least\ncowed.\n\nGusterson grunted an outraged, \"Hey!\" and automatically struggled a\nbit, but once more the gun dug in. Daisy shut her eyes, then firmed\nher mouth and opened them again to look.\n\nSeating the tickler on Fay's shoulder took a little time, because two\nblunt spikes in its bottom had to be fitted into the valved holes in\nthe flush-skin plastic disk. When at last they plunged home Gusterson\nfelt very sick indeed--and then even more so, as the tickler itself\npoked a tiny pellet on a fine wire into Fay's ear.\n\nThe next moment Fay had straightened up and motioned his handlers\naside. He tightened the straps of his tickler around his chest and\nunder his armpits. He held out a hand and someone gave him a\nshoulderless shirt and coat. He slipped into them smoothly, Pooh-Bah\ndexterously using its little claws to help put its turret and body\nthrough the neatly hemmed holes. The small storm troop looked at Fay\nwith deferential expectation. He held still for a moment, as if\nthinking, and then walked over to Gusterson and looked him in the face\nand again held still.\n\nFay's expression was jaunty on the surface, agonized underneath.\nGusterson knew that he wasn't thinking at all, but only listening for\ninstructions from something that was whispering on the very threshold\nof his inner ear.\n\n\"Gussy, old boy,\" Fay said, twitching a depthless grin, \"I'd be very\nmuch obliged if you'd answer a few simple questions.\" His voice was\nhoarse at first but he swallowed twice and corrected that. \"What\nexactly did you have in mind when you invented ticklers? What exactly\nare they supposed to be?\"\n\n\"Why, you miserable--\" Gusterson began in a kind of confused horror,\nthen got hold of himself and said curtly, \"They were supposed to be\nmech reminders. They were supposed to record memoranda and--\"\n\nFay held up a palm and shook his head and again listened for a space.\nThen, \"That's how ticklers were supposed to be of use to humans,\" he\nsaid. \"I don't mean that at all. I mean how ticklers were supposed to\nbe of use to themselves. Surely you had some notion.\" Fay wet his\nlips. \"If it's any help,\" he added, \"keep in mind that it's not Fay\nwho's asking this question, but Pooh-Bah.\"\n\nGusterson hesitated. He had the feeling that every one of the eight\ndual beings in the room was hanging on his answer and that something\nwas boring into his mind and turning over his next thoughts and\npeering at and under them before he had a chance to scan them himself.\nPooh-Bah's eye was like a red searchlight.\n\n\"Go on,\" Fay prompted. \"What were ticklers supposed to be--for\nthemselves?\"\n\n\"Nothin',\" Gusterson said softly. \"Nothin' at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could feel the disappointment well up in the room--and with it a\ntouch of something like panic.\n\nThis time Fay listened for quite a long while. \"I hope you don't mean\nthat, Gussy,\" he said at last very earnestly. \"I mean, I hope you hunt\ndeep and find some ideas you forgot, or maybe never realized you had\nat the time. Let me put it to you differently. What's the place of\nticklers in the natural scheme of things? What's their aim in life?\nTheir special reason? Their genius? Their final cause? What gods\nshould ticklers worship?\"\n\nBut Gusterson was already shaking his head. He said, \"I don't know\nanything about that at all.\"\n\nFay sighed and gave simultaneously with Pooh-Bah the now-familiar\ntriple-jointed shrug. Then the man briskened himself. \"I guess that's\nas far as we can get right now,\" he said. \"Keep thinking, Gussy. Try\nto remember something. You won't be able to leave your apartment--I'm\nsetting guards. If you want to see me, tell them. Or just think--In\ndue course you'll be questioned further in any case. Perhaps by\nspecial methods. Perhaps you'll be ticklerized. That's all. Come on,\neverybody, let's get going.\"\n\nThe pimply woman and her pal let go of Gusterson, Daisy's man loosed\nhis decorous hold, Davidson and Kester sidled away with an eye behind\nthem and the little storm troop trudged out.\n\nFay looked back in the doorway. \"I'm sorry, Gussy,\" he said and for a\nmoment his old self looked out of his eyes. \"I wish I could--\" A claw\nreached for his ear, a spasm of pain crossed his face, he stiffened\nand marched off. The door shut.\n\nGusterson took two deep breaths that were close to angry sobs. Then,\nstill breathing stentorously, he stamped into the bedroom.\n\n\"What--?\" Daisy asked, looking after him.\n\nHe came back carrying his .38 and headed for the door.\n\n\"What are you up to?\" she demanded, knowing very well.\n\n\"I'm going to blast that iron monkey off Fay's back if it's the last\nthing I do!\"\n\nShe threw her arms around him.\n\n\"Now lemme go,\" Gusterson growled. \"I gotta be a man one time anyway.\"\n\nAs they struggled for the gun, the door opened noiselessly, Davidson\nslipped in and deftly snatched the weapon out of their hands before\nthey realized he was there. He said nothing, only smiled at them and\nshook his head in sad reproof as he went out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGusterson slumped. \"I _knew_ they were all psionic,\" he said softly.\n\"I just got out of control now--that last look Fay gave us.\" He\ntouched Daisy's arm. \"Thanks, kid.\"\n\nHe walked to the glass wall and looked out desultorily. After a while\nhe turned and said, \"Maybe you better be with the kids, hey? I imagine\nthe guards'll let you through.\"\n\nDaisy shook her head. \"The kids never come home until supper. For the\nnext few hours they'll be safer without me.\"\n\nGusterson nodded vaguely, sat down on the couch and propped his chin\non the base of his palm. After a while his brow smoothed and Daisy\nknew that the wheels had started to turn inside and the electrons to\njump around--except that she reminded herself to permanently cross out\nthose particular figures of speech from her vocabulary.\n\nAfter about half an hour Gusterson said softly, \"I think the ticklers\nare so psionic that it's as if they just had one mind. If I were with\nthem very long I'd start to be part of that mind. Say something to one\nof them and you say it to all.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later: \"They're not crazy, they're just newborn. The\nones that were creating a cootching chaos downstairs were like babies\nkickin' their legs and wavin' their eyes, tryin' to see what their\nbodies could do. Too bad their bodies are us.\"\n\nTen minutes more: \"I gotta do something about it. Fay's right. It's\nall my fault. He's just the apprentice; I'm the old sorcerer himself.\"\n\nFive minutes more, gloomily: \"Maybe it's man's destiny to build live\nmachines and then bow out of the cosmic picture. Except the ticklers\nneed us, dammit, just like nomads need horses.\"\n\nAnother five minutes: \"Maybe somebody could dream up a purpose in life\nfor ticklers. Even a religion--the First Church of Pooh-Bah Tickler.\nBut I hate selling other people spiritual ideas and that'd still leave\nticklers parasitic on humans....\"\n\nAs he murmured those last words Gusterson's eyes got wide as a\nmaniac's and a big smile reached for his ears. He stood up and faced\nhimself toward the door.\n\n\"What are you intending to do now?\" Daisy asked flatly.\n\n\"I'm merely goin' out an' save the world,\" he told her. \"I may be back\nfor supper and I may not.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nDavidson pushed out from the wall against which he'd been resting\nhimself and his two-stone tickler and moved to block the hall. But\nGusterson simply walked up to him. He shook his hand warmly and looked\nhis tickler full in the eye and said in a ringing voice, \"Ticklers\nshould have bodies of their own!\" He paused and then added casually,\n\"Come on, let's visit your boss.\"\n\nDavidson listened for instructions and then nodded. But he watched\nGusterson warily as they walked down the hall.\n\nIn the elevator Gusterson repeated his message to the second guard,\nwho turned out to be the pimply woman, now wearing shoes. This time he\nadded, \"Ticklers shouldn't be tied to the frail bodies of humans,\nwhich need a lot of thoughtful supervision and drug-injecting and\ncan't even fly.\"\n\nCrossing the park, Gusterson stopped a hump-backed soldier and\ninformed him, \"Ticklers gotta cut the apron string and snap the silver\ncord and go out in the universe and find their own purposes.\" Davidson\nand the pimply woman didn't interfere. They merely waited and watched\nand then led Gusterson on.\n\nOn the escaladder he told someone, \"It's cruel to tie ticklers to\nslow-witted snaily humans when ticklers can think and live ... ten\nthousand times as fast,\" he finished, plucking the figure from the\nmurk of his unconscious.\n\nBy the time they got to the bottom, the message had become, \"Ticklers\nshould have a planet of their own!\"\n\nThey never did catch up with Fay, although they spent two hours\nskimming around on slidewalks, under the subterranean stars, pursuing\nrumors of his presence. Clearly the boss tickler (which was how they\nthought of Pooh-bah) led an energetic life. Gusterson continued to\ndeliver his message to all and sundry at 30-second intervals. Toward\nthe end he found himself doing it in a dreamy and forgetful way. His\nmind, he decided, was becoming assimilated to the communal telepathic\nmind of the ticklers. It did not seem to matter at the time.\n\nAfter two hours Gusterson realized that he and his guides were\nbecoming part of a general movement of people, a flow as mindless as\nthat of blood corpuscles through the veins, yet at the same time dimly\npurposeful--at least there was the feeling that it was at the behest\nof a mind far above.\n\nThe flow was topside. All the slidewalks seemed to lead to the\nconcourses and the escaladders. Gusterson found himself part of a\nhuman stream moving into the tickler factory adjacent to his\napartment--or another factory very much like it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThereafter Gusterson's awarenesses were dimmed. It was as if a bigger\nmind were doing the remembering for him and it were permissible and\neven mandatory for him to dream his way along. He knew vaguely that\ndays were passing. He knew he had work of a sort: at one time he was\nbringing food to gaunt-eyed tickler-mounted humans working feverishly\nin a production line--human hands and tickler claws working together\nin a blur of rapidity on silvery mechanisms that moved along jumpily\non a great belt; at another he was sweeping piles of metal scraps and\ngarbage down a gray corridor.\n\nTwo scenes stood out a little more vividly.\n\nA windowless wall had been knocked out for twenty feet. There was blue\nsky outside, its light almost hurtful, and a drop of many stories. A\nfile of humans were being processed. When one of them got to the head\nof the file his (or her) tickler was ceremoniously unstrapped from his\nshoulder and welded onto a silvery cask with smoothly pointed ends.\nThe result was something that looked--at least in the case of the Mark\n6 ticklers--like a stubby silver submarine, child size. It would hum\ngently, lift off the floor and then fly slowly out through the big\nblue gap. Then the next tickler-ridden human would step forward for\nprocessing.\n\nThe second scene was in a park, the sky again blue, but big and high\nwith an argosy of white clouds. Gusterson was lined up in a crowd of\nhumans that stretched as far as he could see, row on irregular row.\nMartial music was playing. Overhead hovered a flock of little silver\nsubmarines, lined up rather more orderly in the air than the humans\nwere on the ground. The music rose to a heart-quickening climax. The\ntickler nearest Gusterson gave (as if to say, \"And now--who knows?\") a\ntriple-jointed shrug that stung his memory. Then the ticklers took off\nstraight up on their new and shining bodies. They became a flight of\nsilver geese ... of silver midges ... and the humans around Gusterson\nlifted a ragged cheer....\n\nThat scene marked the beginning of the return of Gusterson's mind and\nmemory. He shuffled around for a bit, spoke vaguely to three or four\npeople he recalled from the dream days, and then headed for home and\nsupper--three weeks late, and as disoriented and emaciated as a bear\ncoming out of hibernation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix months later Fay was having dinner with Daisy and Gusterson. The\ncocktails had been poured and the children were playing in the next\napartment. The transparent violet walls brightened, then gloomed, as\nthe sun dipped below the horizon.\n\nGusterson said, \"I see where a spaceship out beyond the orbit of Mars\nwas holed by a tickler. I wonder where the little guys are headed\nnow?\"\n\nFay started to give a writhing left-armed shrug, but stopped himself\nwith a grimace.\n\n\"Maybe out of the solar system altogether,\" suggested Daisy, who'd\nrecently dyed her hair fire-engine red and was wearing red leotards.\n\n\"They got a weary trip ahead of them,\" Gusterson said, \"unless they\nwork out a hyper-Einsteinian drive on the way.\"\n\nFay grimaced again. He was still looking rather peaked. He said\nplaintively, \"Haven't we heard enough about ticklers for a while?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Gusterson agreed, \"but I get to wondering about the\nlittle guys. They were so serious and intense about everything. I\nnever did solve their problem, you know. I just shifted it onto other\nshoulders than ours. No joke intended,\" he hurried to add.\n\nFay forbore to comment. \"By the way, Gussy,\" he said, \"have you heard\nanything from the Red Cross about that world-saving medal I nominated\nyou for? I know you think the whole concept of world-saving medals is\nridiculous, especially when they started giving them to all heads of\nstate who didn't start atomic wars while in office, but--\"\n\n\"Nary a peep,\" Gusterson told him. \"I'm not proud, Fay. I could use a\nfew world-savin' medals. I'd start a flurry in the old-gold market.\nBut I don't worry about those things. I don't have time to. I'm busy\nthese days thinkin' up a bunch of new inventions.\"\n\n\"Gussy!\" Fay said sharply, his face tightening in alarm, \"Have you\nforgotten your promise?\"\n\n\"'Course not, Fay. My new inventions aren't for Micro or any other\nfirm. They're just a legitimate part of my literary endeavors. Happens\nmy next insanity novel is goin' to be about a mad inventor.\"\n\n\n--FRITZ LEIBER\n\n\n\n\n    Transcriber's Note -- Changes made [original in brackets]:\n\n    \"Society can't have much use for us [use]\n    It's the Cheshire [Chesire] cat in reverse.\n    \"Zen ['Zen] come near me,\"\n    \"Ha, wouldn't you like to know?\" [know? ] Fay retorted.\n    Grab a ticket to ecstasy!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
