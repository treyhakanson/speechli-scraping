He was an\ninstitutionalized psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make\nan atom bomb out of modeling clay!_\n\nIllustrated by Freas\n\n\nMiss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the\nshoulder. \"You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you\nhave finished.\"\n\nThe oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile\nand went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.\n\n\nMiss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the\nother patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and\ncrafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,\nlounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'\nprospects for the pennant.\n\nThrough the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were\nseen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental\ninstitution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main\nbuildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere\ncomplex of buildings that housed the main wards.\n\nThe therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word\nof advice here, and a suggestion there.\n\nShe stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of\nclay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he\ncarefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.\n\n\"And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?\" Miss Abercrombie asked.\n\nThe flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the\npatient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to\ndraw away from the woman.\n\n\"We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,\" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,\nbut firmly. \"You've been coming along famously and you must remember to\nanswer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very\ncomplicated.\" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.\n\nThaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.\n\nWithout looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.\n\n\"Atom bomb.\"\n\nA puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. \"Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I\nthought you said an 'atom bomb.'\"\n\n\"Did,\" Funston murmured.\n\nSafely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so\nslightly. \"Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative\nthought. I'm very pleased.\"\n\nShe patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.\n\nA few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood\nup and stretched.\n\n\"All right, fellows,\" he called out, \"time to go back. Put up your\nthings.\"\n\nThere was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs\nbeing moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one\nmore dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless\nsmears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.\n\nAt the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit\nof clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he\nclapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and\nthen stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk\nback across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a\nquick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the\nwarm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.\n\nMiss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart\nbook of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she\nmade short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each\npatient.\n\nAt the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball\nand stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through\nthe lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted\nlengthily in her chart book.\n\nWhen she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked\nthe chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.\n\nThe late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile\nto the main administration building where her car was parked.\n\nAs she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the\nbarred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills\ntowards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant\ncame and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'\nmess hall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the\nward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light\nburning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm\nhills.\n\nAt 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat\nup in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and\noccasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.\nFunston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that\nsheltered the deserted crafts building.\n\nHe gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\n\nThe brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark\nshadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.\n\nAn instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck\nthe hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a\nthousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild\nscreams of the frightened and demented patients.\n\nIt was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling\nlights began flashing on throughout the big institution.\n\nBeyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a\nsmall mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been\nthe arts and crafts building.\n\nThaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed\nwith a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried\nthrough the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the\nexplosion.\n\nNone had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a\nwelter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.\n\nThe roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the\nsurrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units\nfrom a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the\nstill-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.\n\nWithin fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy\nradiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and\nequipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of\nAtomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI\nagents and an Army full colonel disembarked.\n\nAt 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast\ncrater.\n\nIn Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.\n\n\"It's impossible and unbelievable,\" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the\nfifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of\nexperts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.\n\"How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?\"\n\n\"It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,\" one of the haggard AEC\nmen offered timidly. \"Not over three kilotons.\"\n\n\"I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,\" Thurgood screamed. \"How\ndid it get here?\"\n\nA military intelligence agent spoke up. \"If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be\nstanding around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an\natomic explosion.\"\n\nThurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.\n\n\"Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything\nthat was in that building?\" Thurgood swept his hand in the general\ndirection of the blast crater.\n\n\"Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,\" the hospital administrator said\nwith exasperation, \"this was our manual therapy room. We gave our\npatients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,\nthrough the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems\nthat led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints\nand clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then\nMadame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.\"\n\n\"All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,\"\nThurgood sighed. \"I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this\nmorning blew it to hell and gone.\n\n\"And I've got to find out how it happened.\"\n\nThurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little\ndoctor.\n\n\"Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?\"\n\n\"We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here\nnow,\" the doctor snapped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved\naround the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining\nevery tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one\ntime.\n\nA jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the\ntent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.\n\nShe walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned\nexpression.\n\n\"He did make an atom bomb,\" she cried.\n\nColonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped\nforward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.\n\nAt 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff\nroom of the hospital administration building.\n\nColonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the\nedge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist\non the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with\nevery beat.\n\n\"It's ridiculous,\" Thurgood roared. \"We'll all be the laughingstocks of\nthe world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You\nare all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.\"\n\nAt his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the\nbroadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,\nstrategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered\nweariness.\n\n\"Miss Abercrombie,\" one of the physicists spoke up gently, \"you say that\nafter the patients had departed the building, you looked again at\nFunston's work?\"\n\nThe therapist nodded unhappily.\n\n\"And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,\" the physicist\ncontinued, \"there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.\"\n\n\"I'm positive that's all there was in it,\" Miss Abercrombie cried.\n\nThere was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC\nman present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They\nconferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.\n\n\"That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston\nanother chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.\"\n\nThurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" he screamed. \"You want to get us all thrown into this\nfilbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they\never got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,\nanyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with\nthe IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?\n\n\"They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!\"\n\nAt 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's\ngreatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an\nofficer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small\nside door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes\nlater, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and\ndrove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of\nthe runway with propellers turning.\n\nTwo military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to\nsecrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard\nthe plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss\nAbercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into\nthe night skies.\n\nThe plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in\nthe Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack\nmiles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and\nmilitary men huddled around a small wooden table.\n\nThere was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of\nmodeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off\nThaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary\nMiss Abercrombie.\n\n\"Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same\nkind of clay he used before?\"\n\n\"I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the\nhospital,\" she replied, \"and it's the same amount.\"\n\nThurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with\nThaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.\n\nShe smiled at Funston.\n\n\"Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,\" she said. \"These nice men have\nbrought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the\none you made for me yesterday.\"\n\nA flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the\nshack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he\nwalked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp\nclay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top\natomic scientists watched in fascination.\n\nHis busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay\nparts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in\nfront of him.\n\nMiss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the\ntable just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she\nglanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston\nfinished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense\nsilence.\n\n\"Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow.\" She\nlooked at the men and nodded her head.\n\nThe two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of\nclay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him\nfrom the shack.\n\nThere was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The\nexperts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere\nand cameras clicking.\n\nFor two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay\nand photographed it from every angle.\n\nThen they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down\nrange where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of\nstony-faced military policemen.\n\n\"I told you this whole thing was asinine,\" Thurgood snarled as the\nscientific teams trooped into the bunker.\n\nThaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open\ndoor, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden\ncry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.\n\nA brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit\nthe dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door\nslammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSix hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait\njacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.\nThrough the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the\nPotomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.\n\nIn the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were\ncloseted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his\nbaker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted\nacross a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in\na neatly-tied bundle.\n\nIn the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling\nglance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.\n\n\"I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,\" the general\nsaid coldly, \"but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane\nasylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit\nthere and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic\ndevices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.\"\n\nThe general paused.\n\n\"Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships\nout of sponge rubber?\" the general added bitingly.\n\nIn the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama\nof the Washington landscape. He stared hard.\n\nIn the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the\nWashington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,\nthe great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space\non a tail of flame.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Filbert Is a Nut, by Rick Raphael\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A FILBERT IS A NUT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23588.txt or 23588.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/8/23588/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
