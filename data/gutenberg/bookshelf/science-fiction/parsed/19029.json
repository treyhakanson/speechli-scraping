Indeed it was time to leave--\n\nVarta, last of the virgin Maidens of Asti, shivered. The scaled and\nwattled creature who crouched beside her thigh turned his reptilian head\nso that golden eyes met the aquamarine ones set slantingly at a faintly\nprovocative angle in her smooth ivory face.\n\n\"We go--?\"\n\nShe nodded in answer to that unvoiced question Lur had sent into her\nbrain, and turned toward the dark cavern which was the mouth of Asti's\nlast dwelling place. Once, more than a thousand years before when the\nwalls of Memphir were young, Asti had lived among men below. But in the\nrichness and softness which was trading Memphir, empire of empires, Asti\nfound no place. So He and those who served Him had withdrawn to this\nmountain outcrop. And she, Varta, was the last, the very last to bow\nknee at Asti's shrine and raise her voice in the dawn hymn--for Lur, as\nwere all his race, was mute.\n\nEven the loot of Memphir would not sate the shaggy headed warriors who\nhad stormed her gates this day. The stairway to Asti's Temple was plain\nenough to see and there would be those to essay the steep climb hoping\nto find a treasure which did not exist. For Asti was an austere God,\ndelighting in plain walls and bare altars. His last priest had lain in\nthe grave niches these three years, there would be none to hold that\ngate against intruders.\n\nVarta passed between tall, uncarved pillars, Lur padding beside her, his\nspine mane erect, the talons on his forefeet clicking on the stone in\nsteady rhythm. So they came into the innermost shrine of Asti and there\nVarta made graceful obeisance to the great cowled and robed figure which\nsat enthroned, its hidden eyes focused upon its own outstretched hand.\n\nAnd above the flattened palm of that wide hand hung suspended in space\nthe round orange-red sun ball which was twin to the sun that lighted\nErb. Around the miniature sun swung in their orbits the four worlds of\nthe system, each obeying the laws of space, even as did the planets they\nrepresented.\n\n\"Memphir has fallen,\" Varta's voice sounded rusty in her own ears. She\nhad spoken so seldom during the last lonely months. \"Evil has risen to\noverwhelm our world, even as it was prophesied in Your Revelations, O,\nRuler of Worlds and Maker of Destiny. Therefore, obeying the order given\nof old, I would depart from this, Thy house. Suffer me now to fulfill\nthe Law--\"\n\nThree times she prostrated her slim body on the stones at the foot of\nAsti's judgment chair. Then she arose and, with the confidence of a\nchild in its father, she laid her hand palm upward upon the outstretched\nhand of Asti. Beneath her flesh the stone was not cold and hard, but\nseemed to have an inner heat, even as might a human hand. For a long\nmoment she stood so and then she raised her hand slowly, carefully, as\nif within its slight hollow she cupped something precious.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd, as she drew her hand away from the grasp of Asti, the tiny sun and\nits planets followed, spinning now above her palm as they had above the\nstatue's. But out of the cowled figure some virtue had departed with the\ngoing of the miniature solar system; it was now but a carving of stone.\nAnd Varta did not look at it again as she passed behind its bulk to seek\na certain place in the temple wall, known to her from much reading of\nthe old records.\n\nHaving found the stone she sought, she moved her hand in a certain\npattern before it so that the faint radiance streaming from the tiny\nsun, gleamed on the grayness of the wall. There was a grating, as from\nmetal long unused, and a block fell back, opening a narrow door to them.\n\nBefore she stepped within, the priestess lifted her hand above her head\nand when she withdrew it, the sun and planets remained to form a diadem\njust above the intricate braiding of her dull red hair. As she moved\ninto the secret way, the five orbs swung with her, and in the darkness\nthere the sun glowed richly, sending out a light to guide their feet.\n\nThey were at the top of a stairway and the hollow clang of the stone as\nit moved back into place behind them echoed through a gulf which seemed\nendless. But that too was as the chronicles had said and Varta knew no\nfear.\n\nHow long they journeyed down into the maw of the mountain and, beyond\nthat, into the womb of Erb itself, Varta never knew. But, when feet were\nweary and she knew the bite of real hunger, they came into a passageway\nwhich ended in a room hollowed of solid rock. And there, preserved in\nthe chest in which men born in the youth of Memphir had laid them, Varta\nfound that which would keep her safe on the path she must take. She put\naside the fine silks, the jeweled cincture, which had been the badge of\nAsti's service and drew on over her naked body a suit of scaled skin,\ngemmed and glistening in the rays of the small sun. There was a hood to\ncover the entire head, taloned gloves for the hands, webbed, clawed\ncoverings for the feet--as if the skin of a giant, man-like lizard had\nbeen tanned and fashioned into this suit. And Varta suspected that that\nmight be so--the world of Erb had not always been held by the human-kind\nalone.\n\nThere were supplies here too, lying untouched in ageless containers\nwithin a lizard-skin pouch. Varta touched her tongue without fear to a\npowdered restorative, sharing it with Lur, whose own mailed skin would\nprotect him through the dangers to come.\n\nShe folded the regalia she had stripped off and laid it in the chest,\nsmoothing it regretfully before she dropped the lid upon its shimmering\ncolor. Never again would Asti's servant wear the soft stuff of His\nLivery. But she was resolute enough when she picked up the food pouch\nand strode forward, passing out of the robing chamber into a narrow way\nwhich was a natural fault in the rock unsmoothed by the tools of man.\n\nBut when this rocky road ended upon the lip of a gorge, Varta hesitated,\nplucking at the throat latch of her hood-like helmet. Through the\nunclouded crystal of its eye-holes she could see the sprouts of yellow\nvapor which puffed from crannies in the rock wall down which she must\nclimb. If the records of the Temple spoke true, these curls of gas were\ndeath to all lunged creatures of the upper world. She could only trust\nthat the cunning of the scaled hood would not fail her.\n\nThe long talons fitted to the finger tips of the gloves, the claws of\nthe webbed foot coverings clamped fast to every hand and foot hold, but\nthe way down was long and she caught a message of weariness from Lur\nbefore they reached the piled rocks at the foot of the cliff. The puffs\nof steamy gas had become a fog through which they groped their way\nslowly, following a trace of path along the base of the cliff.\n\nTime did not exist in the underworld of Erb. Varta did not know whether\nit was still today, or whether she had passed into tomorrow when they\ncame to a cross roads. She felt Lur press against her, forcing her back\nagainst a rock.\n\n\"There is a thing coming--\" his message was clear.\n\nAnd in a moment she too saw a dark hulk nosing through the vapor. It\nmoved slowly, seeming to balance at each step as if travel was a painful\nact. But it bore steadily to the meeting of the two paths.\n\n\"It is no enemy--\" But she did not need that reassurance from Lur.\nUnearthly as the thing looked it had no menace.\n\nWith a last twist of ungainly body the creature squatted on a rock and\nclawed the clumsy covering it wore about its bone-thin shoulders and\ndomed-skull head. The visage it revealed was long and gray, with dark\npits for eyes and a gaping, fang-studded, lipless mouth.\n\n\"Who are you who dare to tread the forgotten ways and rouse from slumber\nthe Guardian of the Chasms?\"\n\nThe question was a shrill whine in her brain, her hands half arose to\ncover her ears--\n\n\"I am Varta, Maiden of Asti. Memphir has fallen to the barbarians of the\nOuter Lands and now I go, as Asti once ordered--.\"\n\nThe Guardian considered her answer gravely. In one skeleton claw it\nfumbled a rod and with this it now traced certain symbols in the dust\nbefore Varta's webbed feet. When it had done, the girl stooped and\naltered two of the lines with a swift stroke from one of her talons. The\ncreature of the Chasm nodded its misshapen head.\n\n\"Asti does not rule here. But long, and long, and long ago there was a\npact made with us in His Name. Pass free from us, woman of the Light.\nThere are two paths before you--.\"\n\nThe Guardian paused for so long that Varta dared to prompt it.\n\n\"Where do they lead, Guardian of the Dark?\"\n\n\"This will take you down into my country,\" it jerked the rod to the\nright. \"And that way is death for creatures from the surface world. The\nother--in our old legends it is said to bring a traveler out into the\nupper world. Of the truth of that I have no proof.\"\n\n\"But that one I must take,\" she made slight obeisance to the huddle of\nbones and dank cloak on the rock and it inclined its head in grave\ncourtesy.\n\nWith Lur pushing a little ahead, she took the road which ran straight\ninto the flume-veiled darkness. Nor did she turn to look again at the\nThing from the Chasm world.\n\nThey began to climb again, across slimed rock where there were evil\ntrails of other things which lived in this haunted darkness. But the sun\nof Asti lighted their way and perhaps some virtue in the rays from it\nkept away the makers of such trails.\n\nWhen they pulled themselves up onto a wide ledge the talons on Varta's\ngloves were worn to splintered stubs and there was a bright girdle of\npain about her aching body. Lur lay panting beside her, his red-forked\ntongue protruding from his foam ringed mouth.\n\n\"We walk again the ways of men,\" Lur was the first to note the tool\nmarks on the stone where they lay. \"By the Will of Asti, we may win out\nof this maze after all.\"\n\nSince there were no signs of the deadly steam Varta dared to push off\nher hood and share with her companion the sustaining power she carried\nin her pouch. There was a freshness to the air they breathed, damp and\ncold though it was, which hinted of the upper world.\n\nThe ledge sloped upwards, at a steep angle at first, and then more\ngently. Lur slipped past her and thrust head and shoulders through a\nbreak in the rock. Grasping his neck spines she allowed him to pull her\nthrough that narrow slit into the soft blackness of a surface night.\nThey tumbled down together, Varta's head pillowed on Lur's smooth side,\nand so slept as the sun and worlds of Asti whirled protectingly above\nthem.\n\nA whir of wings in the air above her head awakened Varta. One of the\nsmall, jewel bright flying lizard creatures of the deep jungle poised\nand dipped to investigate more closely the worlds of Asti. But at\nVarta's upflung arm it uttered a rasping cry and planed down into the\nmass of vegetation below. By the glint of sunlight on the stone around\nthem the day was already well advanced. Varta tugged at Lur's mane until\nhe roused.\n\nThere was a regularity to the rocks piled about their sleeping place\nwhich hinted that they had lain among the ruins left by man. But of this\nside of the mountains both were ignorant, for Memphir's rule had not run\nhere.\n\n\"Many dead things in times past,\" Lur's scarlet nostril pits were\nextended to their widest. \"But that was long ago. This land is no longer\nheld by men.\"\n\nVarta laughed cheerfully. \"If here there are no men, then there will\nrise no barbarian hordes to dispute our rule. Asti has led us to safety.\nLet us see more of the land He gives us.\"\n\nThere was a road leading down from the ruins, a road still to be\nfollowed in spite of the lash of landslip and the crack of time. And it\nbrought them into a cup of green fertility where the lavishness of\nAsti's sowing was unchecked by man. Varta seized eagerly upon globes of\nblood red fruit which she recognized as delicacies which had been\ncultivated in the Temple gardens, while Lur went hunting into the\nfringes of the jungle, there dining on prey so easily caught as to be\njudged devoid of fear.\n\nThe jungle choked highway curved and they were suddenly fronted by a\ndesert of sere desolation, a desert floored by glassy slag which sent\nback the sun beams in a furnace glare. Varta shaded her eyes and tried\nto see the end of this, but, if there was a distant rim of green beyond,\nthe heat distortions in the air concealed it.\n\nLur put out a front paw to test the slag but withdrew it instantly.\n\n\"It cooks the flesh, we can not walk here,\" was his verdict.\n\nVarta pointed with her chin to the left where, some distance away, the\nmountain wall paralleled their course.\n\n\"Then let us keep to the jungle over there and see if it does not bring\naround to the far side. But what made this--?\" She leaned out over the\nglassy stuff, not daring to touch the slick surface.\n\n\"War.\" Lur's tongue shot out to impale a questing beetle. \"These\nforgotten people fought with fearsome weapons.\"\n\n\"But what weapon could do this? Memphir knew not such--.\"\n\n\"Memphir was old. But mayhap there were those who raised cities on Erb\nbefore the first hut of Memphir squatted on tidal mud. Men forget\nknowledge in time. Even in Memphir the lords of the last days forgot the\nwisdom of their earlier sages--they fell before the barbarians easily\nenough.\"\n\n\"If ever men had wisdom to produce this--it was not of Asti's giving,\"\nshe edged away from the glare. \"Let us go.\"\n\nBut now they had to fight their way through jungle and it was\nhard--until they reached a ridge of rock running out from the mountain\nas a tongue thrust into the blasted valley. And along this they picked\ntheir slow way.\n\n\"There is water near--,\" Lur's thought answered the girl's desire. She\nlicked dry lips longingly. \"This way--,\" her companion's sudden turn was\nto the left and Varta was quick to follow him down a slide of rock.\n\nLur's instinct was right, as it ever was. There was water before them, a\nsmall lake of it. But even as he dipped his fanged muzzle toward that\ninviting surface, Lur's spined head jerked erect again. Varta snatched\nback the hand she had put out, staring at Lur's strange actions. His\nnostrils expanded to their widest, his long neck outstretched, he was\nswinging his head back and forth across the limpid shallows.\n\n\"What is it--?\"\n\n\"This is no water such as we know,\" the scaled one answered flatly. \"It\nhas life within it.\"\n\nVarta laughed. \"Fish, water snakes, your own distant kin, Lur. It is the\nscent of them which you catch--\"\n\n\"No. It is the water itself which lives--and yet does not live--\" His\nthought trailed away from her as he struggled with some problem. No\nhuman brain could follow his unless he willed it so.\n\nVarta squatted back on her heels and began to look at the water and then\nat the banks with more care. For the first time she noted the odd\npatches of brilliant color which floated just below the surface of the\nliquid. Blue, green, yellow, crimson, they drifted slowly with the tiny\nwaves which lapped the shore. But they were not alive, she was almost\nsure of that, they appeared more a part of the water itself.\n\nWatching the voyage of one patch of green she caught sight of the\nbranch. It was a drooping shoot of the turbi, the same tree vine which\nproduced the fruit she had relished less than an hour before. Above the\nwater dangled a cluster of the fruit, dead ripe with the sweet pulp\nstretching its skin. But below the surface of the water--\n\nVarta's breath hissed between her teeth and Lur's head snapped around as\nhe caught her thought.\n\nThe branch below the water bore a perfect circle of green flowers close\nto its tip, the flowers which the turbi had borne naturally seven months\nbefore and which should long ago have turned into just such sweetness as\nhung above.\n\nWith Lur at her heels the girl edged around to pull cautiously at the\nbranch. It yielded at once to her touch, swinging its tip out of the\nlake. She sniffed--there was a languid perfume in the air, the perfume\nof the blooming turbi. She examined the flowers closely, to all\nappearances they were perfect and natural.\n\n\"It preserves,\" Lur settled back on his haunches and waved one front paw\nat the quiet water. \"What goes into it remains as it was just at the\nmoment of entrance.\"\n\n\"But if this is seven months old--\"\n\n\"It may be seven years old,\" corrected Lur. \"How can you tell when that\nbranch first dipped into the lake? Yet the flowers do not fade even when\nwithdrawn from the water. This is indeed a mystery!\"\n\n\"Of which I would know more!\" Varta dropped the turbi and started on\naround the edge of the lake.\n\nTwice more they found similar evidence of preservation in flower or\nleaf, wherever it was covered by the opaline water.\n\nThe lake itself was a long and narrow slash with one end cutting into\nthe desert of glass while the other wet the foot of the mountain. And it\nwas there, on the slope of the mountain that they found the greatest\nwonder of all, Lur scenting it before they sighted the remains among the\nstones.\n\n\"Man made,\" he cautioned, \"but very, very old.\"\n\nAnd truly the wreckage they came upon must have been old, perhaps even\nolder than Memphir. For the part which rested above the water was almost\ngone, rusty red stains on the rocks outlining where it had lain. But\nunder water was a smooth silver hull, shining and untouched by the\nyears. Varta laid her hand upon a ruddy scrap between two rocks and it\nbecame a drift of powdery dust. And yet--there a few feet below was\nstrong metal!\n\nLur padded along the scrap of shore surveying the thing.\n\n\"It was a machine in which men traveled,\" his thoughts arose to her.\n\"But they were not as the men of Memphir. Perhaps not even as the sons\nof Erb--\"\n\n\"Not as the sons of Erb!\" her astonishment broke into open speech.\n\nLur's neck twisted as he looked up at her. \"Did the men of Erb, even in\nthe old chronicles fight with weapons such as would make a desert of\nglass? There are other worlds than Erb, mayhap this strange thing was a\nsky ship from such a world. All things are possible by the Will of\nAsti.\"\n\nVarta nodded. \"All things are possible by the Will of Asti,\" she\nrepeated. \"But, Lur,\" her eyes were round with wonder, \"perhaps it is\nAsti's Will which brought us here to find this marvel! Perhaps He has\nsome use for us and it!\"\n\n\"At least we may discover what lies within it,\" Lur had his own share of\ncuriosity.\n\n\"How? The two of us can not draw that out of the water!\"\n\n\"No, but we can enter into it!\"\n\nVarta fingered the folds of the hood on her shoulders. She knew what Lur\nmeant, the suit which had protected her in the underworld was impervious\nto everything outside its surface--or to every substance its makers\nknew--just as Lur's own hide made his flesh impenetrable. But the\nfashioners of her suit had probably never known of the living lake and\nwhat if she had no defense against the strange properties of the water?\n\nShe leaned back against a rock. Overhead the worlds and sun of Asti\nstill traveled their appointed paths. The worlds of Asti! If it was His\nWill which had brought them here, then Asti's power would wrap her round\nwith safety. By His Will she had come out of Memphir over ways no human\nof Erb had ever trod before. Could she doubt that His Protection was\nwith her now?\n\nIt took only a moment to make secure the webbed shoes, to pull on and\nfasten the hood, to tighten the buckles of her gloves. Then she crept\nforward, shuddering as the water rose about her ankles. But Lur pushed\non before her, his head disappearing fearlessly under the surface as he\ncrawled through the jagged opening in the ship below.\n\nSmashed engines which had no meaning in her eyes occupied most of the\nbroken section of the wreck. None of the metal showed any deterioration\nbeyond that which had occurred at the time of the crash. Under her\nexploring hands it was firm and whole.\n\nLur was pulling at a small door half hidden by a mass of twisted wires\nand plates and, just as Varta crawled around this obstacle to join him,\nthe barrier gave way allowing them to squeeze through into what had once\nbeen the living quarters of the ship.\n\nVarta recognized seats, a table, and other bits of strictly utilitarian\nfurniture. But of those who had once been at home there, there remained\nno trace. Lur, having given one glance to the furnishings, was prowling\nabout the far end of the cabin uncertainly, and now he voiced his\nuneasiness.\n\n\"There is something beyond, something which once had life--\"\n\nVarta crowded up to him. To her eyes the wall seemed without line of an\nopening, and yet Lur was running his broad front paws over it carefully,\nnow and then throwing his weight against the smooth surface.\n\n\"There is no door--\" she pointed out doubtfully.\n\n\"No door--ah--here--\" Lur unsheathed formidable fighting claws to their\nfull length for perhaps the first time in his temple-sheltered life, and\nendeavored to work them into a small crevice. The muscles of his\nforelegs and quarters stood out in sharp relief under his scales, his\nfangs were bare as his lips snapped back with effort.\n\nSomething gave, a thin black line appeared to mark the edges of a door.\nThen time, or Lur's strength, broke the ancient locking mechanism. The\ndoor gave so suddenly that they were both sent hurtling backward and\nLur's breath burst from him in a huge bubble.\n\nThe sealed compartment was hardly more than a cupboard but it was full.\nSpread-eagled against the wall was a four-limbed creature whose form was\nso smothered in a bulky suit that Varta could only guess that it was\nakin in shape to her own. Hoops of metal locked it firmly to the wall,\nbut the head had fallen forward so that the face plate in the helmet was\nhidden.\n\nSlowly the girl breasted the water which filled the cabin and reached\nher hands toward the bowed helmet of the prisoner. Gingerly, her blunted\ntalons scraping across metal, she pulled it up to her eye-level.\n\nThe eyes of that which stood within the suit were closed, as if in\nsleep, but there was a warm, healthy tint to the bronze skin, so\ndifferent in shade to her own pallid coloring. For the rest, the\nprisoner had the two eyes, the centered nose, the properly shaped mouth\nwhich were common to the men of Erb. Hair grew on his head, black and\nthick and there was a faint shadow of beard on his jaw line.\n\n\"This is a man--\" her thought reached Lur.\n\n\"Why not? Did you expect a serpent? It is a pity he is dead--\"\n\nVarta felt a rich warm tide rising in her throat to answer that teasing\nhalf question. There were times when Lur's thought reading was annoying,\nHe had risen to his hind legs so that he too could look into the shell\nwhich held their find.\n\n\"Yes, a pity,\" he repeated. \"But--\"\n\nA vision of the turbi flowers swept through her mind. Had Lur suggested\nit, or had that wild thought been hers alone? Only this ship was so\nold--so very old!\n\nLur's red tongue flicked. \"It can do no harm to try--\" he suggested\nslyly and set his claws into the hoop holding the captive's right wrist,\ntesting its strength.\n\n\"But the metal on the shore, it crumpled into powder at my touch--\" she\nprotested. \"What if we carry him out only to have--to have--\" Her mind\nshuddered away from the picture which followed.\n\n\"Did the turbi blossom fade when pulled out?\" countered Lur. \"There is a\nsecret to these fastenings--\" He pulled and pried impatiently.\n\nVarta tried to help but even their united strength was useless against\nthe force which held the loops in place. Breathless the girl slumped\nback against the wall of the cabin while Lur settled down on his\nhaunches. One of the odd patches of color drifted by, its vivid scarlet\nlike a jewel spiraling lazily upward. Varta's eyes followed its drift\nand so were guided to what she had forgotten, the worlds of Asti.\n\n\"Asti!\"\n\nLur was looking up too.\n\n\"The power of Asti!\"\n\nVarta's hand went up, rested for a long moment under the sun and then\ndrew it down, carefully, slowly, as she had in Memphir's temple. Then\nshe stepped towards the captive. Within her hood a beaded line of\nmoisture outlined her lips, a pulse thundered on her temple. This was a\nfearsome thing to try.\n\nShe held the sun on a line with one of the wrist bonds, She must avoid\nthe flesh it imprisoned, for Asti's power could kill.\n\nFrom the sun there shot an orange-red beam to strike full upon the\nmetal. A thin line of red crept across the smooth hoop, crept and\nwidened. Varta raised her hand, sending the sun spinning up and Lur's\nclaws pulled on the metal. It broke like rotten wood in his grasp.\n\nThe girl gave a little gasp of half-terrified delight. Then the old\nlegends were true! As Asti's priestess she controlled powers too great\nto guess. Swiftly she loosed the other hoops and restored the sun and\nworlds to their place over her head as the captive slumped across the\nthreshold of his cell.\n\nTugging and straining they brought him out of the broken ship into the\nsunlight of Erb. Varta threw back her hood and breathed deeply of the\nair which was not manufactured by the wizardry of the lizard skin and\nLur sat panting, his nostril flaps open. It was he who spied the spring\non the mountain side above, a spring of water uncontaminated by the\nstrange life of the lake. They both dragged themselves there to drink\ndeeply.\n\nVarta returned to the lake shore reluctantly. Within her heart she\nbelieved that the man they had brought from the ship was truly dead. Lur\nmight hold out the promise of the flowers, but this was a man and he had\nlain in the water for countless ages--\n\nSo she went with lagging steps, to find Lur busy. He had solved the\nmystery of the space suit and had stripped it from the unknown. Now his\nclawed paw rested lightly on the bared chest and he turned to Varta\neagerly.\n\n\"There is life--\"\n\nHardly daring to believe that, she dropped down beside Lur and touched\ntheir prize. Lur was right, the flesh was warm and she had caught the\nfaint rhythm of shallow breath. Half remembering old tales, she put her\nhands on the arch of the lower ribs and began to aid that rhythm. The\nbreaths were deeper--\n\nThen the man half turned, his arm moved. Varta and Lur drew back. For\nthe first time the girl probed gently the sleeping mind before her--even\nas she had read the minds of those few of Memphir who had ascended to\nthe temple precincts in the last days.\n\nMuch of what she read now was confused or so alien to Erb that it had no\nmeaning for her. But she saw a great city plunged into flaming death in\nan instant and felt the horror and remorse of the man at her feet\nbecause of his own part in that act, the horror and remorse which had\nled him to open rebellion and so to his imprisonment. There was a last\ndark and frightening memory of a door closing on light and hope--\n\nThe space man moaned softly and hunched his shoulders as if he struggled\nvainly to tear loose from bonds.\n\n\"He thinks that he is still prisoner,\" observed Lur. \"For him life\nbegins at the very point it ended--even as it did for the turbi flowers.\nSee--now he awakens.\"\n\nThe eyelids rose slowly, as if the man hated to see what he must look\nupon. Then, as he sighted Varta and Lur, his eyes went wide. He pulled\nhimself up and looked dazedly around, striking out wildly with his\nfists. Catching sight of the clumsy suit Lur had taken from him he\npulled at it, looking at the two before him as if he feared some attack.\n\nVarta turned to Lur for help. She might read minds and use the wordless\nspeech of Lur. But his people knew the art of such communication long\nbefore the first priest of Asti had stumbled upon their secret. Let Lur\nnow quiet this outlander.\n\nDelicately Lur sought a way into the other's mind, twisting down paths\nof thought strange to him. Even Varta could not follow the subtile waves\nsent forth in the quick examination and reconnoitering, nor could she\nunderstand all of the conversation which resulted. For the man from the\nancient ship answered in speech aloud, sharp harsh sounds of no meaning.\nIt was only after repeated instruction from Lur that he began to frame\nhis messages in his mind, clumsily and disconnectedly.\n\nPictures of another world, another solar system, began to grow more\nclear as the space man became more at home in the new way of\ncommunication. He was one of a race who had come to Erb from beyond the\nstars and discovered it a world without human life: So they had\nestablished colonies and built great cities--far different from\nMemphir--and had lived in peace for centuries of their own time.\n\nThen on the faraway planet of their birth there had begun a great war, a\nwar which brought flaming death to all that world. The survivors of a\nlast battle in outer space had fled to the colonies on Erb. But among\nthis handful were men driven mad by the death of their world, and these\nhad blasted the cities of Erb, saying that their kind must be wiped out.\n\nThe man they had rescued had turned against one such maddened leader and\nhad been imprisoned just before an attack upon the largest of the\ncolony's cities. After that he remembered nothing.\n\nVarta stopped trying to follow the conversation--Lur was only explaining\nnow how they had found the space man and brought him out of the wrecked\nship. No human on Erb, this one had said, and yet were there not her own\npeople, the ones who had built Memphir? And what of the barbarians, who,\nruthless and cruel as they seemed by the standards of Memphir, were\nindeed men? Whence had they come then, the men of Memphir and the\nancestors of the barbarian hordes? Her hands touched the scaled skin of\nthe suit she still wore and then rubbed across her own smooth flesh.\nCould one have come from the other, was she of the blood and heritage of\nLur?\n\n\"Not so!\" Lur's mind, as quick as his flickering tongue, had caught that\npanic-born thought. \"You are of the blood of this space wanderer. Men\nfrom the riven colonies must have escaped to safety. Look at this man,\nis he not like the men of Memphir--as they were in the olden days of the\ncity's greatness?\"\n\nThe stranger was tall, taller than the men of Memphir and there was a\ncertain hardness about him which those city dwellers in ease had never\ndisplayed. But Lur must be right, this was a man of her race. She smiled\nin sudden relief and he answered that smile. Lur's soft laughter rang in\nboth their heads.\n\n\"Asti in His Infinite Wisdom can see through Centuries. Memphir has\nfallen because of its softness and the evildoing of its people and the\nbarbarians will now have their way with the lands of the north. But to\nme it appears that Asti is not yet done with the pattern He was weaving\nthere. To each of you He granted a second life. Do not disdain the Gifts\nof Asti, Daughter of Erb!\"\n\nAgain Varta felt the warm tide of blood rise in her cheeks. But she no\nlonger smiled. Instead she regarded the outlander speculatively.\n\nNot even a Maiden of the Temple could withstand the commands of the All\nHighest. Gifts from the Hand of Asti dared not be thrown away.\n\nAbove the puzzlement of the stranger she heard the chuckling of Lur.\n\n\nThe End.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED\n\n\nThe following typographical errors in the text were corrected as\ndetailed here.\n\nIn the text: \"Then she arose and, with the confidence of a child in\nits father, she laid her hand palm upward upon the outstretched hand\nof Asti....\" the word \"outstreched\" was corrected to \"outstretched.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Varta touched her tongue without fear to a powdered\nrestorative,\" the word \"restoritive\" was corrected to \"restorative.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Varta threw back her hood and breathed deeply of the\nair which was not manufactured by the wizardry of the lizard skin ...\"\nthe word \"manufacured\" was corrected to \"manufactured\"; and the word\n\"wizardy\" was corrected to \"wizardry.\"\n\nIn the text: \"A thin line of red crept across the smooth hoop, crept and\nwidened....\" the word \"widdened\" was corrected to \"widened.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Then time, or Lur's strength, broke the ancient locking\nmechanism....\" the word \"machanism\" was corrected to \"mechanism.\"\n\nIn the text: \"... so different in shade to her own pallid coloring....\"\nthe word \"palid\" was corrected to \"pallid.\"\n\nIn the text: \"One of the small, jewel bright flying lizard creatures of\nthe deep jungle poised and dipped to investigate more closely the worlds\nof Asti....\" the word \"closly\" was corrected to \"closely.\"\n\nIn the text: \"... his long neck outstretched, he was swinging his\nhead back and forth across the limpid shallows....\"\nthe word \"outstreched\" was corrected to \"outstretched.\"\n\nIn the text: \"What goes into it remains as it was just at the moment of\nentrance....\" the word \"at\" was corrected to \"as.\"\n\nIn the text: \"the flowers which the turbi had born naturally seven months\nbefore,\" the word \"born\" was corrected to \"borne.\"\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gifts of Asti, by Andre Alice Norton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GIFTS OF ASTI ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19029.txt or 19029.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/0/2/19029/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geetu Melwani and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
