Extensive research did not uncover any evidence\nthat the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n     _A fearsome thing is a thing you're afraid of--and it has nothing\n     whatever to do with whether others are afraid, nor with whether it\n     is in fact dangerous. It's your view of the matter that counts!_\n\n\nThere was a dizzy, sickening whirl of mental blackness--not true\nblackness, but a mind-enveloping darkness that was filled with the\nmulti-colored little sparks of thoughts and memories that scattered\nthrough the darkness like tiny glowing mice, fleeing from something\nunknown, fleeing outwards and away toward a somewhere that was equally\nunknown; scurrying, moving, changing--each half recognizable as it\npassed, but leaving only a vague impression behind.\n\nMemories were shattered into their component data bits in that maelstrom\nof not-quite-darkness, and scattered throughout infinity and eternity.\nThen the pseudo-dark stopped its violent motion and became still, no\nlonger scattering the fleeing memories, but merely blanketing them. And\nslowly--ever so slowly--the powerful cohesive forces that existed\nbetween the data-bits began pulling them back together again as the\nnot-blackness faded. The associative powers of the mind began putting\nthe frightened little things together as they drifted back in from vast\ndistances, trying to fit them together again in an ordered whole. Like a\nvast jigsaw puzzle in five dimensions, little clots and patches formed\nas the bits were snuggled into place here and there.\n\nThe process was far from complete when Broom regained consciousness.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nBroom sat up abruptly and looked around him. The room was totally\nunfamiliar. For a moment, that seemed perfectly understandable. Why\nshouldn't the room look odd, after he had gone through--\n\nWhat?\n\nHe rubbed his head and looked around more carefully. It was not just\nthat the room itself was unfamiliar as a whole; the effect was greater\nthan that. It was not the first time in his life he had regained\nconsciousness in unfamiliar surroundings, but always before he had been\naware that only the pattern was different, not the details.\n\nHe sat there on the floor and took stock of himself and his\nsurroundings.\n\nHe was a big man--six feet tall when he stood up, and proportionately\nheavy, a big-boned frame covered with hard, well-trained muscles. His\nhair and beard were a dark blond, and rather shaggy because of the time\nhe'd spent in prison.\n\nPrison!\n\nYes, he'd been in prison. The rough clothing he was wearing was\ncertainly nothing like the type of dress he was used to.\n\nHe tried to force his memory to give him the information he was looking\nfor, but it wouldn't come. A face flickered in his mind for a moment,\nand a name. Contarini. He seemed to remember a startled look on the\nItalian's face, but he could neither remember the reason for it nor when\nit had been. But it would come back; he was sure of that.\n\nMeanwhile, where the devil was he?\n\nFrom where he was sitting, he could see that the room was fairly large,\nbut not extraordinarily so. A door in one wall led into another room of\nabout the same size. But they were like no other rooms he had ever seen\nbefore. He looked down at the floor. It was soft, almost as soft as a\nbed, covered with a thick, even, resilient layer of fine material of\nsome kind. It was some sort of carpeting that covered the floor from\nwall to wall, but no carpet had ever felt like this.\n\nHe lifted himself gingerly to his feet. He wasn't hurt, at least. He\nfelt fine, except for the gaps in his memory.\n\nThe room was well lit. The illumination came from the ceiling, which\nseemed to be made of some glowing, semitranslucent metal that cast a\nshadowless glow over everything. There was a large, bulky table near the\nwall away from the door; it looked almost normal, except that the\nobjects on it were like nothing that had ever existed. Their purposes\nwere unknown, and their shapes meaningless.\n\nHe jerked his head away, not wanting to look at the things on the table.\n\nThe walls, at least, looked familiar. They seemed to be paneled in some\nfine wood. He walked over and touched it.\n\nAnd knew immediately that, no matter what it looked like, it wasn't\nwood. The illusion was there to the eye, but no wood ever had such a\nhard, smooth, glasslike surface as this. He jerked his fingertips away.\n\nHe recognized, then, the emotion that had made him turn away from the\nobjects on the table and pull his hand away from the unnatural wall. It\nwas fear.\n\nFear? Nonsense! He put his hand out suddenly and slapped the wall with\nhis palm and held it there. There was nothing to be afraid of!\n\nHe laughed at himself softly. He'd faced death a hundred times during\nthe war without showing fear; this was no time to start. What would his\nmen think of him if they saw him getting shaky over the mere touch of a\nwoodlike wall?\n\nThe memories were coming back. This time, he didn't try to probe for\nthem; he just let them flow.\n\nHe turned around again and looked deliberately at the big, bulky table.\nThere was a faint humming noise coming from it which had escaped his\nnotice before. He walked over to it and looked at the queerly-shaped\nthings that lay on its shining surface. He had already decided that the\ntable was no more wood than the wall, and a touch of a finger to the\nsurface verified the decision.\n\nThe only thing that looked at all familiar on the table was a sheaf of\nwritten material. He picked it up and glanced over the pages, noticing\nthe neat characters, so unlike any that he knew. He couldn't read a word\nof it. He grinned and put the sheets back down on the smooth table top.\n\nThe humming appeared to be coming from a metal box on the other side of\nthe table. He circled around and took a look at the thing. It had levers\nand knobs and other projections, but their functions were not\nimmediately discernible. There were several rows of studs with various\nunrecognizable symbols on them.\n\nThis would certainly be something to tell in London--when and if he ever\ngot back.\n\nHe reached out a tentative finger and touched one of the symbol-marked\nstuds.\n\nThere was a loud _click!_ in the stillness of the room, and he leaped\nback from the device. He watched it warily for a moment, but nothing\nmore seemed to be forthcoming. Still, he decided it might be best to let\nthings alone. There was no point in messing with things that undoubtedly\ncontrolled forces beyond his ability to cope with, or understand. After\nall, such a long time--\n\nHe stopped, Time? _Time?_\n\nWhat had Contarini said about time? Something about its being like a\nriver that flowed rapidly--that much he remembered. Oh, yes--and that it\nwas almost impossible to try to swim backwards against the current or\n... something else. What?\n\nHe shook his head. The more he tried to remember what his fellow\nprisoner had told him, the more elusive it became.\n\nHe had traveled in time, that much was certain, but how far, and in\nwhich direction? Toward the future, obviously; Contarini had made it\nplain that going into the past was impossible. Then could he, Broom, get\nback to his own time, or was he destined to stay in this--place?\nWherever and whenever it was.\n\nEvidently movement through the time-river had a tendency to disorganize\na man's memories. Well, wasn't that obvious anyway? Even normal movement\nthrough time, at the rate of a day per day, made some memories fade. And\nsome were lost entirely, while others remained clear and bright. What\nwould a sudden jump of centuries do?\n\nHis memory was improving, though. If he just let it alone, most of it\nwould come back, and he could orient himself. Meanwhile, he might as\nwell explore his surroundings a little more. He resolved to keep his\nhands off anything that wasn't readily identifiable.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a single oddly-shaped chair by the bulky table, and behind the\nchair was a heavy curtain which apparently covered a window. He could\nsee a gleam of light coming through the division in the curtains.\n\nBroom decided he might as well get a good look at whatever was outside\nthe building he was in. He stepped over, parted the curtains, and--\n\n--And gasped!\n\nIt was night time outside, and the sky was clear. He recognized the\nfamiliar constellations up there. But they were dimmed by the light from\nthe city that stretched below him.\n\nAnd what a city! At first, it was difficult for his eyes to convey their\nimpressions intelligently to his brain. What they were recording was so\nunfamiliar that his brain could not decode the messages they sent.\n\nThere were broad, well-lit streets that stretched on and on, as far as\nhe could see, and beyond them, flittering fairy bridges rose into the\nair and arched into the distance. And the buildings towered over\neverything. He forced himself to look down, and it made him dizzy. The\nbuilding he was in was so high that it would have projected through the\nclouds if there had been any clouds.\n\nBroom backed away from the window and let the curtain close. He'd had\nall of that he could take for right now. The inside of the building, his\nimmediate surroundings, looked almost homey after seeing that monstrous,\nendless city outside.\n\nHe skirted the table with its still-humming machine and walked toward\nthe door that led to the other room. A picture hanging on a nearby wall\ncaught his eye, and he stopped. It was a portrait of a man in\nunfamiliar, outlandish clothing, but Broom had seen odder clothing in\nhis travels. But the thing that had stopped him was the amazing reality\nof the picture. It was almost as if there were a mirror there,\nreflecting the face of a man who stood invisibly before it.\n\nIt wasn't, of course; it was only a painting. But the lifelike, somber\neyes of the man were focused directly on him. Broom decided he didn't\nlike the effect at all, and hurried into the next room.\n\nThere were several rows of the bulky tables in here, each with its own\nchair. Broom's footsteps sounded loud in the room, the echoes rebounding\nfrom the walls. He stopped and looked down. This floor wasn't covered\nwith the soft carpeting; it had a square, mosaic pattern, as though it\nmight be composed of tile of some kind. And yet, though it was harder\nthan the carpet it had a kind of queer resiliency of its own.\n\nThe room itself was larger than the one he had just quitted, and not as\nwell lit. For the first time, he thought of the possibility that there\nmight be someone else here besides himself. He looked around, wishing\nthat he had a weapon of some kind. Even a knife would have made him feel\nbetter.\n\nBut there had been no chance of that, of course. Prisoners of war are\nhardly allowed to carry weapons with them, so none had been available.\n\nHe wondered what sort of men lived in this fantastic city. So far, he\nhad seen no one. The streets below had been filled with moving vehicles\nof some kind, but it had been difficult to tell whether there had been\nanyone walking down there from this height.\n\nContarini had said that it would be ... how had he said it? \"Like\nsleeping for hundreds of years and waking up in a strange world.\"\n\nWell, it was that, all right.\n\nDid anyone know he was here? He had the uneasy feeling that hidden,\nunseen eyes were watching his every move, and yet he could detect\nnothing. There was no sound except the faint humming from the device in\nthe room behind him, and a deeper, almost inaudible, rushing, rumbling\nsound that seemed to come from far below.\n\nHis wish for a weapon came back, stronger than before. The very fact\nthat he had seen no one set his nerves on edge even more than the sight\nof a known enemy would have done.\n\nHe was suddenly no longer interested in his surroundings. He felt\ntrapped in this strange, silent room. He could see a light shining\nthrough a door at the far end of the room--perhaps it was a way out. He\nwalked toward it, trying to keep his footsteps as silent as possible as\nhe moved.\n\nThe door had a pane of translucent glass in it, and there were more of\nthe unreadable characters on it. He wished fervently that he could\ndecipher them; they might tell him where he was.\n\nCarefully, he grasped the handle of the door, twisted it, and pulled.\nAnd, careful as he had been, the door swung inward with surprising\nrapidity. It was a great deal thinner and lighter than he had supposed.\n\nHe looked down at it, wondering if there were any way the door could be\nlocked. There was a tiny vertical slit set in a small metal panel in the\ndoor, but it was much too tiny to be a keyhole. Still--\n\nIt didn't matter. If necessary, he could smash the glass to get through\nthe door. He stepped out into what was obviously a hallway beyond the\ndoor.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nThe hallway stretched away to either side, lined with doors similar to\nthe one he had just come through. How did a man get out of this place,\nanyway? The door behind him was pressing against his hand with a patient\ninsistence, as though it wanted to close itself. He almost let it close,\nbut, at the last second, he changed his mind.\n\n_Better the devil we know than the devil we don't_, he thought to\nhimself.\n\nHe went back into the office and looked around for something to prop the\ndoor open. He found a small, beautifully formed porcelain dish on one of\nthe desks, picked it up, and went back to the door. The dish held the\ndoor open an inch or so. That was good enough. If someone locked the\ndoor, he could still smash in the glass if he wanted to, but the absence\nof the dish when he returned would tell him that he was not alone in\nthis mysterious place.\n\nHe started down the hallway to his right, checking the doors as he went.\nThey were all locked. He knew that he could break into any of them, but\nhe had a feeling that he would find no exit through any of them. They\nall looked as though they concealed more of the big rooms.\n\nNone of them had any lights behind them. Only the one door that he had\ncome through showed the telltale glow from the other side. Why?\n\nHe had the terrible feeling that he had been drawn across time to this\nplace for a purpose, and yet he could think of no rational reason for\nbelieving so.\n\nHe stopped as another memory came back. He remembered being in the\nstone-walled dungeon, with its smelly straw beds, lit only by the faint\nshaft of sunlight that came from the barred window high overhead.\n\nContarini, the short, wiry little Italian who was in the next cell,\nlooked at him through the narrow opening. \"I still think it can be done,\nmy friend. It is the mind and the mind alone that sees the flow of time.\nThe body experiences, but does not see. Only the soul is capable of\nknowing eternity.\"\n\nBroom outranked the little Italian, but prison can make brothers of all\nmen. \"You think it's possible then, to get out of a place like this,\nsimply by thinking about it?\"\n\nContarini nodded. \"Why not? Did not the saints do so? And what was that?\nContemplation of the Eternal, my comrade; contemplation of the Eternal.\"\n\nBroom held back a grin. \"Then why, my Venetian friend, have you not left\nthis place long since?\"\n\n\"I try,\" Contarini had said simply, \"but I cannot do it. You wish to\nknow why? It is because I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\" Broom raised an eyebrow. He had seen Contarini on the\nbattlefield, dealing death in hand-to-hand combat, and the Italian\nhadn't impressed him as a coward.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Venetian. \"Afraid. Oh, I am not afraid of men. I fight.\nSome day, I may die--_will_ die. This does not frighten me, death. I am\nnot afraid of what men may do to me.\" He stopped and frowned. \"But, of\nthis, I have a great fear. Only a saint can handle such things, and I am\nno saint.\"\n\n\"I hope, my dear Contarini,\" Broom said dryly, \"that you are not under\nthe impression that _I_ am a saint.\"\n\n\"No, perhaps not,\" Contarini said. \"Perhaps not. But you are braver than\nI. I am not afraid of any man living. But you are afraid of neither the\nliving nor the dead, nor of man nor devil--which is a great deal more\nthan I can say for myself. Besides, there is the blood of kings in your\nveins. And has not a king protection that even a man of noble blood such\nas myself does not have? I think so.\n\n\"Oh, I have no doubt that you could do it, if you but would. And then,\nperhaps, when you are free, you would free me--for teaching you all I\nknow to accomplish this. My fear holds me chained here, but you have no\nchains of fear.\"\n\nBroom had thought that over for a moment, then grinned. \"All right, my\nfriend; I'll try it. What's your first lesson?\"\n\nThe memory faded from Broom's mind. Had he really moved through some\nsegment of Eternity to reach this ... this place? Had he--\n\nHe felt a chill run through him. What was he doing here? How could he\nhave taken it all so calmly. Afraid of man or devil, no--but this was\nneither. He had to get back. The utter alienness of this bright,\nshining, lifeless wonderland was too much for him.\n\nInstinctively, he turned and ran back toward the room he had left. If he\ngot back to the place where he had appeared in this world,\nperhaps--somehow--some force would return him to where he belonged.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nThe door was as he had left it, the porcelain dish still in place. He\nscooped up the dish in one big hand and ran on into the room, letting\nthe door shut itself behind him. He ran on, through the large room with\nits many tables, into the brightly lighted room beyond.\n\nHe stopped. What could he do now? He tried to remember the things that\nthe Italian had told him to do, and he could not for the life of him\nremember them. His memory still had gaps in it--gaps he did not know\nwere there because he had not yet probed for them. He closed his eyes in\nconcentration, trying to bring back a memory that would not come.\n\nHe did not hear the intruder until the man's voice echoed in the room.\n\nBroom's eyes opened, and instantly every muscle and nerve in his\nhard-trained body tensed for action. There was a man standing in the\ndoorway of the office.\n\nHe was not a particularly impressive man, in spite of the queer cut of\nhis clothes. He was not as tall as Broom, and he looked soft and\noverfed. His paunch protruded roundly from the open front of the short\ncoat, and there was a fleshiness about his face that betrayed too much\ngood living.\n\nAnd he looked even more frightened than Broom had been a few minutes\nbefore.\n\nHe was saying something in a language that Broom did not understand, and\nthe tenseness in his voice betrayed his fear. Broom relaxed. He had\nnothing to fear from this little man.\n\n\"I won't hurt you,\" Broom said. \"I had no intention of intruding on your\nproperty, but all I ask is help.\"\n\nThe little man was blinking and backing away, as though he were going to\nturn and bolt at any moment.\n\nBroom laughed. \"You have nothing to fear from me, little man. Permit me\nto introduce myself. I am Richard Broom, known as--\" He stopped, and his\neyes widened. Total memory flooded over him as he realized fully who he\nwas and where he belonged.\n\nAnd the fear hit him again in a raging flood, sweeping over his mind and\nblotting it out. Again, the darkness came.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, the blackness faded quickly. There was a face, a worried\nface, looking at him through an aperture in the stone wall. The\nsurroundings were so familiar, that the bits of memory which had been\nscattered again during the passage through centuries of time came back\nmore quickly and settled back into their accustomed pattern more easily.\n\nThe face was that of the Italian, Contarini. He was looking both worried\nand disappointed.\n\n\"You were not gone long, my lord king,\" he said. \"But you _were_ gone.\nOf that there can be no doubt. Why did you return?\"\n\nRichard Broom sat up on his palette of straw. The scene in the strange\nbuilding already seemed dreamlike, but the fear was still there. \"I\ncouldn't remember,\" he said softly. \"I couldn't remember who I was nor\nwhy I had gone to that ... that place. And when I remembered, I came\nback.\"\n\nContarini nodded sadly. \"It is as I have heard. The memory ties one too\nstrongly to the past--to one's own time. One must return as soon as the\nmind had adjusted. I am sorry, my friend; I had hoped we could escape.\nBut now it appears that we must wait until our ransoms are paid. And I\nmuch fear that mine will never be paid.\"\n\n\"Nor mine,\" said the big man dully. \"My faithful Blondin found me, but\nhe may not have returned to London. And even if he has, my brother John\nmay be reluctant to raise the money.\"\n\n\"What? Would England hesitate to ransom the brave king who has fought so\ngallantly in the Holy Crusades? Never! You will be free, my friend.\"\n\nBut Richard Plantagenet just stared at the little dish that he still\nheld in his hand, the fear still in his heart. Men would still call him\n\"Lion-hearted,\" but he knew that he would never again deserve the title.\n\n       *        *       *       *       *\n\nAnd, nearly eight centuries away in time and thousands of miles away in\nspace, a Mr. Edward Jasperson was speaking hurriedly into the telephone\nthat stood by the electric typewriter on his desk.\n\n\"That's right, Officer; Suite 8601, Empire State Building. I was working\nlate, and I left the lights on in my office when I went out to get a cup\nof coffee. When I came back, he was here--a big, bearded man, wearing a\nthing that looked like a monk's robe made out of gunny sack. What? No, I\nlocked the door when I left. What? Well, the only thing that's missing\nas far as I can tell is a ceramic ash tray from one of the desks; he was\nholding that in his hand when I saw him. What? Oh. Where did he go?\" Mr.\nJasperson paused in his rush of words. \"Well, I must have gotten a\nlittle dizzy--I was pretty shocked, you know. To be honest, I didn't see\nwhere he went. I must have fainted.\n\n\"But I think you can pick him up if you hurry. With that getup on, he\ncan't get very far away. All right. Thank you, Officer.\"\n\nHe cradled the phone, pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, and dabbed\nat his damp forehead. He was a very frightened little man, but he knew\nhe'd get over it by morning.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Viewpoint, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VIEWPOINT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23563.txt or 23563.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/5/6/23563/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Bruce Albrecht, Mary Meehan and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
