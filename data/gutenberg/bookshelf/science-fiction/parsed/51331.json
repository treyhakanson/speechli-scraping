DeWITT MILLER\n\n                        Illustrated by FRANCIS\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                  Galaxy Science Fiction April 1956.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n              There were no vacuums in Space Regulations,\n            so Swenson--well, you might say he knew how to\n               plot courses through sub-ether legality!\n\n\nIt was on October 15, 2177, that Swenson staggered into the offices of\nAcme Interplanetary Express and demanded a job as dispatcher.\n\nThey threw him out. They forgot to lock the door. The next time they\nthrew him out, they remembered to lock the door but forgot the window.\n\nThe dingy office was on the ground floor and Swenson was a tall man.\nWhen he came in the window, the distraught Acme Board of Directors\nrealized that they had something unusual in the way of determined\ndrunks to deal with.\n\nAcme was one of the small hermaphroditic companies--hauling mainly\nfreight, but shipping a few passengers--which were an outgrowth of the\nmost recent war to create peace.\n\nDuring that violent conflict, America had established bases throughout\nthe Solar System. These required an endless stream of items necessary\nfor human existence.\n\nWhile the hostilities lasted, the small outfits were vital and for that\nreason prospered. They hauled oxygen, food, spare parts, whisky, atomic\nslugs, professional women, uniforms, paper for quadruplicate reports,\ncigarettes, and all the other impedimenta of war-time life.\n\nWith the outbreak of peace, such companies faced a precarious,\ndevil-take-the-hindmost type of existence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe day that Swenson arrived had been grim even for Acme. Dovorkin, the\nregular dispatcher, had been fired that morning. He had succeeded in\nleaving the schedule in a nightmarish muddle.\n\nAnd on Dovorkin's vacant desk lay the last straw--a Special Message.\n\n    _Acme Interplanetary Express_\n    _147 Z Street_\n    _New York_\n\n    _Your atomic-converted ship Number 7 is hereby grounded at Luna\n    City, Moon, until demurrage bill paid. Your previous violations\n    of Space Regulations make our action mandatory._\n\n    _Planetary Commerce Commission_\n\nThe Acme Board of Directors was inured to accepting the inevitable.\nThey had heard rumors along Blaster's Alley of Swenson's reputation,\nwhich ranged from brilliance, through competence, to insanity. So they\nshrugged and hired him.\n\nHis first act was to order a case of beer. His second was to look at\nwhat Dovorkin had left of a Dispatch Sheet.\n\n\"Number 5 is still blasting through the astraloids. It should be\nfree-falling. Why the hell isn't it?\"\n\nOld Mister Cerobie, Chairman of the Board, said quietly: \"Before you\nbegin your work, we would like a bit of information. What is your full\nname?\"\n\n\"Patrick M. Swenson.\"\n\n\"What does the M stand for?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"My mother never told me. I don't think she knows. In the name of God,\nwhy don't you send Number 3....\"\n\n\"What's your nationality?\"\n\n\"I'm supposed to be a Swede.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'supposed'?\"\n\n\"Will you open one of those beers?\"\n\n\"I asked you....\"\n\nSwenson made a notation on the Dispatch Sheet and spun around in the\nswivel chair. \"I was born on a _Swallow Class_ ship in space between\nthe Moon and Earth. My mother said my father was a Swede. She was\nIrish. I was delivered and circumcised by a rabbi who happened to\nbe on board. The ship was of Venutian registry, but was owned by a\nCzechoslovakian company. Now you figure it out.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to come here?\"\n\n\"I met Dovorkin in a bar. He told me that you were in trouble. You are.\nIs one of the Moulton Trust's ships at Luna City?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then that's why you're grounded. They've got an in with the Planetary\nCommerce Commission. What's the demurrage?\"\n\n\"Seventy-six thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Can you raise it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwenson glanced at the sheet. \"How come Number 2 is in New York?\"\n\n\"We're waiting for additional cargo. We have half a load of snuff for\nMars. And we've been promised half a load of canned goods for Luna\nCity. It's reduced rate freight that another company can't handle.\"\n\n\"Dovorkin told me about the snuff. That's a starter, anyway.\" Swenson\nturned back to the Dispatch Sheet and muttered to himself: \"Always a\ngood thing to have snuff for Mars.\"\n\nMister Cerobie became strangely interested.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nSwenson paid no attention. \"What are you taking a split load for?\"\n\n\"We had no choice.\"\n\n\"You know damn well that the broken-down old stovepipes you buy from\nwar surplus are too slow to handle split loads. Who promised you the\ncanned goods?\"\n\n\"Lesquallan, Ltd.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" said Swenson. \"An outfit that expects lions to lie down\nwith lambs!\"\n\nThe red _ship-calling_ light flashed on.\n\n\"Number 4 to dispatcher. This is Captain Elsing. Dovorkin....\"\n\n\"Dispatcher to Number 4. Dovorkin, hell. This is Swenson. What blasts?\"\n\n\"B jet just went out. Atomic slug clogged.\"\n\n\"How radioactive is the spout?\" asked Swenson.\n\n\"Heavy.\"\n\n\"Have somebody who's already had a family put on armor and clean up the\nmess,\" Swenson said, \"and alter course for Luna City. I'll send you the\nexact course in a few minutes. When you get to Luna, land beside the\nMoulton Trust's ship. Now stand by to record code.\"\n\nSwenson reached back to Mister Cerobie. \"Acme private code book.\"\n\nSilently, the Chairman of the Board handed it to him. When Swenson had\nfinished coding, he handed the original message to Mister Cerobie. The\nmessage read:\n\n     \"Captain Elsing, have crew start fight with Moulton's crew. Not\n     much incentive will be necessary. See that no real damage is done.\n     Urgent. Will take all responsibility. Explain later. Cerobie.\"\n\n\"Swenson,\" Mister Cerobie said quietly, \"you _are_ insane. Tear that\nup.\"\n\nWith slow dignity, Swenson put on his coat. He stood there, smiling,\nand looking at Mister Cerobie. The memory of Dovorkin stalked\nunpleasantly through the Chairman's mind. Everything was hopeless,\nanyway. Better go out with a bang than a whimper.\n\n\"All right, send it,\" he said. \"There is plenty of time to\ncountermand--after I talk to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Swenson had finished sending the coded message, he turned back to\nMister Cerobie. \"What's this I hear from Dovorkin about a Senator being\naboard Number 7 at Luna?\"\n\nA member of the Board began: \"After all....\"\n\nMister Cerobie cut him off: \"Your information is correct, Swenson. A\nSenator has shipped with us. However, I would prefer to discuss the\nmatter in my private office.\"\n\nSwenson crossed the room to the astrographer in the calculating booth\nand said: \"Plot the free-falling curve for Number 5 to Mars.\" Then he\nfollowed Mister Cerobie into the Chairman's office.\n\nHalf an hour later, they came out and Swenson went back to his desk.\nFirst he glanced at the free-falling plot. Then he snorted, called the\nastrographer and fired him. Next he said to Mister Cerobie: \"Is that\nhalf load of snuff....\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. You know Martians as well as I do. With their type of\nnose, they must get quite a sensation. I understand they go a bit\nberserk. That's why their government outlaws snuff as an Earth vice.\nHowever, our cargo release states that it is being sent for 'medicinal\npurposes.' It's no consequence to us what they use the snuff for. We're\njust hauling it. And I don't have to tell you how fantastic a rate\nwe're getting.\"\n\n\"To hell with the canned goods part of the load,\" Swenson said. \"Can\nyou get a full haul of snuff?\"\n\n\"Possibly. But it would cost.\"\n\n\"Even this outfit can afford to grease palms.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\n\"What's the Senator on the Moon for?\"\n\n\"He's supposed to make a speech on Conquest Day.\" Mister Cerobie lit a\ncigar. \"That's day after tomorrow,\" he added.\n\n\"Exactly where is this eloquence to be expounded?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Senator is speaking at the dedication of the new underground\nrecreation dome. It's just outside Luna City. They've bored a tunnel\nfrom the main dome cluster. This dedication is considered very\nimportant. Everybody in Luna will be there. It's been declared an\nofficial holiday, with all crews released. Even the maintenance and\npublic service personnel have been cut to skeleton staffs.\"\n\n\"With that fiesta scheduled on our beloved satellite,\" said Swenson,\n\"we won't have to worry about getting the Senator off for some time.\nHis name's Higby, isn't it?\" Mister Cerobie nodded. \"Then he'll whoop\nit up long enough for you to get that demurrage mess straightened out.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. The Senator is due for another\nspeech on Mars. The timing is close--he only has a minimum of leeway.\nAs you mentioned, Number 7 is grounded for demurrage. And we can't ship\nthe Senator out on Number 4 because of the bad jet.\"\n\nSwenson was silent for a long time. The beer gurgled pleasantly as he\ndrank it. Then a bright smile--which could have been due either to\ninspiration or beer--spread across his face.\n\n\"If that idiot Dovorkin can be trusted,\" he said, \"the Senator is\nspeaking in the early afternoon, our time. Do you happen to know just\nwhen he starts yapping? And the scheduled length of the spiel?\"\n\n\"I'll check it.\" Mister Cerobie turned to one of his assistants.\nSwenson took down the _Luna Data Handbook_ and thumbed through it.\n\nA moment later, the assistant handed a slip of paper to the Board\nChairman.\n\n\"The Senator,\" Mister Cerobie said, \"will speak from 1300 hours to 1500\nhours.\"\n\nSwenson smiled and stuck a marker in the _Luna Data Handbook_.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"about this snuff. Can you have it loaded by tomorrow\nnight?\"\n\n\"I don't see how.\"\n\n\"Remember our agreement in the office. If we don't do something, we're\nthrough, so all we can do is lose. Leave me be and don't ask questions.\nI want to blast Number 2 into low Earth-orbital tomorrow night.\"\n\nMister Cerobie looked off into that nowhere which was the daily destiny\nof Acme. \"All right,\" he said, \"I was born a damn fool. I'll do my best\nto have a full load of snuff aboard--somehow--tomorrow night.\"\n\nSwenson went back to his Dispatch Sheet. During the next five hours,\nhe looked up only long enough to order another case of beer and a new\nastrographer.\n\nFinally, he called Heilberg, the assistant dispatcher who was on the\nnight shift, gave him a lecture concerning dispatching in general and\nthe present situation in particular, promoted a date with one of the\nstenographers, and departed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Swenson came back the next morning, he was sober, ornery and\ndisinclined to do any work. He cornered O'Toole, the labor relations\nman, and began talking women. O'Toole was intrigued but evasive.\n\n\"Your trouble,\" Swenson said, \"is not with women. It's with evolution.\nI don't blame evolution for creating women. I blame it for abandoning\nthe egg. Just when it had invented a reasonable method of reproduction\nwhich didn't make the female silly-looking and tie her down needlessly\nfor nine months....\"\n\n\"I don't think they're silly-looking.\"\n\n\"Maybe you don't, O'Toole, but I do. And you must admit that nine\nmonths is a hell of a long time to fool around with something that\ncould be hatched in an incubator under automatic controls. Look at the\ntime saving. If evolution hadn't abandoned the egg idea, half the human\nrace wouldn't waste time being damned incubators.\"\n\nO'Toole backed away. He had never heard the legend of Swenson's egg\nspeech.\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" Swenson went on, \"that evolution is efficient. Are you\nmarried, O'Toole?\"\n\n\"Yes, I--\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you rather your wife laid an egg than--\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" O'Toole interrupted, \"but I do know that I'd like to\nfind out what the dispatch situation is at the moment.\"\n\nSwenson grabbed a piece of paper and drew a diagram.\n\nWhile O'Toole was studying the diagram, someone laid a Special Message\non Swenson's desk. Swenson glanced at it:\n\n    _Acme Interplanetary Express_\n    _147 Z Street_\n    _New York_\n\n    _Your ship Number 4 is hereby grounded at Luna City, pending an\n    investigation of a riot involving your men, and for non-payment of\n    bill for atomic slug purification. Your Number 4 is also charged\n    with unpaid demurrage bill._\n\n    _Planetary Commerce Commission_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwenson muttered: \"Good!\" and threw the Special Message in the\nwastebasket. Mister Cerobie, who had just entered the office, fished\nthe form out and read it.\n\n\"It never rains, but it pours,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't stand long on one foot,\" Swenson answered without looking\nup. \"Put all your troubles in one basket and then lose the basket.\n_Morituri te salutamus._ Have you heard my theory about the advantage\nof reproduction via the egg? And get me a beer.\"\n\n\"I will get you a beer, but if you say a word about that egg theory, I\nwill fire you. I heard you talking to O'Toole.\"\n\n\"Okay. We'll forget the egg for the nonce. Did you pilfer that snuff?\"\n\n\"It's being loaded. And it cost Acme--\"\n\n\"Did you expect it would fall like manna from heaven?\" Swenson flipped\nthe switch of the intercom to Acme's launching area. \"Give me Number 2.\nCaptain Wilkins.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Mister Cerobie asked.\n\n\"Don't you remember what I told you yesterday? Where's that beer?\"\n\nMister Cerobie smiled, a weary, dogged smile, the smile of a man who\nhad bet on drawing to a belly straight.\n\n\"Captain Wilkins,\" came over the intercom, \"calling Swenson,\ndispatcher, for orders.\"\n\n\"Blast as soon as loaded for low altitude Earth-orbital.\" Swenson was\nsilent a moment, then: \"Hell, don't you know the plot? All right, I'll\ngive it to you. Full jets, two minutes, azimuth....\"\n\nMister Cerobie interrupted quietly: \"Swenson, don't you think you'd\nbetter check with the astrographer?\"\n\nTurning off the intercom, Swenson spun in his chair. \"Any decent\ndispatcher knows that one by heart. So maybe I'm wrong. Then Number\n2 will pile up on either the Moon or the Earth. If that happens, you\ncan collect the insurance and get out of this mess.\" He flipped on the\nintercom switch. \"Sorry, Captain Wilkins, brass interference. As I was\nsaying, azimuth....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMister Cerobie made no effort to continue the conversation. He was\nreading an astrogram, which had just been handed to him.\n\n    ACME INTERPLANETARY EXPRESS\n    147 Z STREET\n    NEW YORK\n    EARTH\n\n    HEAR PERSISTENT RUMOR YOUR SHIP ON WHICH I AM A PASSENGER HELD HERE\n    FOR NON-PAYMENT OF DEMURRAGE. MUST MAKE WORLD CRISIS SPEECH ON MARS\n    AS SCHEDULED. ASTROGRAM TRUTH OF SITUATION AT ONCE. INVESTIGATION\n    OF SUCH MATTERS NOW PENDING BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEE. DO NOT ASTROGRAM\n    COLLECT.\n\n    SEN. HIRAM C. HIGBY\n\nSwenson snapped off the intercom, glanced at his Dispatch Sheet, leaned\nback in his chair and closed his eyes. He was silent for the next half\nhour and drank three beers, looking either thoughtful or asleep. Mister\nCerobie smoked a cigar until it burned his mustache.\n\nWhen the third beer was finished, Swenson reached for an astrogram\nblank and wrote:\n\n    HON. SENATOR HIRAM C. HIGBY ESQ.\n    ACME INTERPLANETARY EXPRESS\n    LUNA CITY\n\n    RUMOR RE UNPAID DEMURRAGE UTTERLY UN-FOUNDED. INFORMATION HERE THAT\n    RUMOR STARTED BY YOUR OPPOSITION. HAVE VITAL NEW DATA FOR YOUR LUNA\n    CITY SPEECH. WILL SEND SPEECH INSERT AT ONCE.\n\n    JAMES CEROBIE\n\nMister Cerobie, who had been reading over Swenson's shoulder, said:\n\"You know that demurrage rumor is true.\"\n\n\"If things don't work out and we have any trouble, you can say you\nhadn't heard about the demurrage. By the way, can you write an insert\nto a political speech?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I've lied before.\"\n\n\"Make sure it will take ten minutes to deliver--even talking\nfast--which Senators don't usually do.\"\n\n\"What,\" inquired Mister Cerobie, \"shall I write about?\"\n\n\"You know that scandal Senator Higby's opposition just got involved in.\nThat business about slave labor exploitation on Venus. The story broke\nthis morning. Get in touch with my friend Max Zempky on _Telenews_ and\nhave him give you some inside details. It doesn't matter if they're\nimportant or not. The Senator will grab anything that might pep up his\nspeech. Besides, he's probably been having a large time in Luna City\nand hasn't heard about this morning's story.\"\n\nMister Cerobie executed a sweeping bow. \"Yes, sir. And if this thing\ndoesn't work, I told you yesterday in my office what would happen.\"\n\nSwenson shrugged. \"Kismet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Mister Cerobie opened the door to his private office, Swenson called\nafter him: \"Where's this outfit's attorney?\"\n\n\"In the Board Room.\"\n\n\"Find him and send him in here.\"\n\nMister Cerobie nodded.\n\n\"And,\" Swenson added, \"be damned sure that speech insert will run at\nleast ten minutes. More, if possible.\"\n\nMister Cerobie slammed the door.\n\nFive minutes later, slim, soft-spoken Van Euing, Acme's attorney,\ncoughed behind the dispatcher's chair. Swenson swiveled from coding the\nastrogram and dropped his cigarette. \"What the hell--oh, you. Lawyers\nare like policemen--they sneak up on people.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was the firm's attorney?\"\n\n\"I watched you try that unfair-trade-practice suit against Lesquallan\nLtd. two years ago. It was snowing outside. I was broke and the\ncourtroom was warm. You should have won the case. Some of their\nevidence looked phony to me. Anyway, you did a good job.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Did you ever stop to think about the advantage of the egg--\"\n\n\"Mister Cerobie said you wished to speak to me.\"\n\n\"That's right. I want you to draw up a something-or-other--you know\nwhat I mean--grounding Moulton Trust's ship on the Moon until this\nfight hassle is settled.\"\n\n\"You mean you wish me to prepare a restraining order?\"\n\n\"Restrain, yeah! And restrain them as long as you can. I wish you could\nrestrain them forever. This solar system would be a better place.\"\n\n\"On what grounds am I to base my order?\"\n\n\"Claim they started the fight and our crew's so bashed up that we\nhaven't enough able men to blast off.\"\n\n\"But I'm afraid we can't prove that.\"\n\n\"And what's it going to cost us to try? You're on retainer. The total\nbill for said restraining order will be only the price of some legal\npaper and the services of a notary. The steno's hired by the month,\nlike you.\"\n\nVan Euing looked puzzled. \"What good will it do?\"\n\n\"You know how long it takes courts to do anything. Before your order is\ntossed out, Moulton will have been grounded for a week.\"\n\nVan Euing lit his pipe. \"In legal parlance, it is something irregular,\nwhich, being translated, means it's a slick trick.\"\n\n\"All it's going to cost _you_ is being half an hour late to lunch.\"\n\nVan Euing puffed a moment on his pipe and said: \"Because of your\naudacity, Swenson, and furthermore, because you'll be fired tomorrow,\nI'll prepare the restraining order.\"\n\nSwenson put out his hand and his blunt fingers closed around Van\nEuing's delicate ones.\n\nWhen Van Euing had gone, Swenson returned to coding the astrogram. He\nchecked the form twice and sent it.\n\nThen he turned over his desk to an apprentice dispatcher, left orders\nto be called if anything broke down, and went out to lunch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was 2:30 P.M. when news of the restraining order arrived in\nthe quiet, streamlined offices of the Moulton Trust. Two minutes later,\nthe offices were still streamlined, but not quiet.\n\nThe three major stockholders of the great organization, N. Rovance, F.\nK. Esrov, and Cecil Neinfort-Whritings, formed a tiny huddle at one end\nof the long conference table. Esrov was waving a copy of the order.\n\n\"Gentlemen, we can consider this nothing but an outrage!\"\n\n\"Blackmail, really!\" It was Neinfort-Whritings's lisping voice.\n\n\"Whatever it is, this sort of nonsense must be stopped at the\nbeginning. It might set a precedent.\"\n\n\"May I suggest,\" Rovance broke in, \"that, as the matter of precedent is\nsure to arise, we take no action without first consulting Lesquallan\nLtd.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea,\" Esrov nodded. He switched on the intercom to his\nfirst secretary. \"Connect me with Lesquallan Ltd. I want to speak with\nNovell Lesquallan. Inform him that it is urgent.\"\n\n\"He just entered our office.\" The voice that came from the intercom\ncarried the slightest trace of surprise. \"He said he desired to discuss\nsomething about canned goods and snuff. I shall send him in at once.\"\n\nRovance turned to Neinfort-Whritings. \"I fear that old Cerobie is\nbecoming senile. Apparently he has lost his mind.\"\n\n\"But really, did he ever have one?\"\n\nNobody laughed. Esrov slammed the restraining order on the conference\ntable and stood up. \"Gentlemen, what shall we do concerning--\"\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, that is just what I want to know.\"\n\nThree heads pivoted. Novell Lesquallan, sole owner of Lesquallan Ltd.,\nstood in the doorway. He was a broad, ruddy-faced man with a voice\ntrained to basso interruptions.\n\n\"I understand, Mr. Lesquallan,\" Esrov said, \"that you have a matter to\ndiscuss with us.\"\n\n\"Yes! Sit down, F.K. We have some talking to do--about that bankrupt,\ndishonest Acme Interplanetary Express.\"\n\n\"Quite a coincidence,\" Neinfort-Whritings murmured.\n\n\"You got trouble with that outfit, too? That settles it. They've\ncluttered up the orderly progress of free enterprise long enough. Out\nthey go.\"\n\nNovell Lesquallan swiftly read the document and bellowed an\nunintelligible remark.\n\n\"Something, quite,\" Neinfort-Whritings agreed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLesquallan got his voice under control. \"What action do you intend to\ntake?\"\n\n\"We hadn't decided,\" Rovance answered. \"We received the order only a\nfew minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Before we form our plans,\" Esrov said, \"we would like some\ninformation about your problems with Acme. We understand it involves\ncanned goods and snuff.\"\n\n\"Yes, those damned.... At the last minute, they turned down a small\nload of canned goods for Luna that we'd been decent enough to give\nthem at reduced rates. They can't get away with that kind of thing\nlong. But that's just the beginning. They got hold of the contract and\npermit to haul a consignment of medicinal snuff to Mars. We had already\narranged for that cargo. You know that snuff situation. Through certain\ncontacts, we have been able--perfectly legally--to have permits issued.\nThat customs man must have taken a double--\"\n\n\"We understand,\" Rovance broke in. \"We have had occasion to make\nsimilar arrangements. The rates--and other inducements--are extremely\nsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" Lesquallan demanded, \"what are we going to do about\nthis unprecedented situation?\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" Neinfort-Whritings said, \"that we have our legal staffs\nmeet in joint session. We should impress on them that the quashing of\nthis restraining order is urgent. Perhaps we should consider debts owed\nus by the judiciary we helped elect.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea,\" Lesquallan declared. \"I will take care of that\npart of it myself, personally.\"\n\n\"As to the snuff matter,\" Esrov said, \"I think we should emphasize to\nour mutual contact that he should be more discriminating in issuing\npermits.\"\n\n\"That's all right for now,\" Lesquallan snapped. \"But he's done with,\ntoo. I'll see to it that he's replaced.\"\n\n\"As to the canned goods situation,\" Rovance said, \"it seems to me that\nwe should have a subsidiary company to handle our excess cargoes--at\nreduced rates, of course. It shouldn't cost too much to pick up one of\nthe less financially secure companies--such as Acme.\"\n\nEsrov nodded. \"An excellent idea.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Lesquallan said and sat down. \"But first we must dispose\nof today's damned annoyances. I suggest that we outline a plan for\nimmediate action.\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" Esrov reminded him, \"we must deal with the restraining\norder.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Swenson came back from lunch, he was not as sober and thus in a\nbetter mood. Mister Cerobie's insert to the Senator's speech was on his\ndesk. Swenson read the first few lines:\n\n    As a further indication of the methods, devices, malfeasances, and\n    corrupt practices employed, used, and sustained by those with whom\n    you have called upon me to negotiate in the highest tribunal in\n    Washington, let me cite the following information which I have just\n    received. Although this information is top-drawer, restricted and\n    highly secret, I was able to obtain it through certain channels\n    which, as a man of honor, I must leave undisclosed.\n\n    The right of all creatures to be free is a fundamental, an\n    inviolable, right and yet on Venus....\n\nSwenson said to himself: \"Mister Cerobie is in the wrong business,\" and\nstarted coding the insert. He had almost finished when the ship-calling\nlight flashed red.\n\n\"Number 5 to Dispatcher. Captain Verbold speaking.\"\n\n\"Dispatcher to Number 5. This is Swenson. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you can't help me. May I speak to Mister Cerobie?\"\n\n\"He's out to lunch.\"\n\n\"This matter is serious. I am faced with what amounts to mutiny.\"\n\n\"Sorry, but I got troubles, too. Maybe I can find Mister Cerobie, maybe\nI can't. Why don't you tell me your grief?\"\n\nCaptain Verbold hesitated. \"It's something I've been expecting. The\ncrew has stated that they will leave the ship at Mars.\" Captain\nVerbold's next sentence was pronounced word by word in code. \"I even\nhave private information that there is a plot to take over the ship and\nblast directly to Earth, where the crew feel their case can be more\njustly presented.\"\n\n\"What are they squawking about?\"\n\n\"Everything. Wages have not been paid for six months. Poor radiation\nshielding. Food not up to standard. You know the story.\"\n\n\"It's not the first time I've heard it.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"First, read them section 942 in your copy of _Space Regulations_,\"\nsaid Swenson. \"If they divert ship from Mars without your permission,\nit's mutiny. That means the neutron death chamber or, if they are very\nlucky, life sentences to the Luna Penal Colony. Get them all together\nand read it to them. You're free-falling now, so even the jetters won't\nhave to be on duty.\"\n\n\"But if I could talk to Mister Cerobie--\"\n\n\"I've already told you I don't know where the hell he is. He couldn't\ndo you any good, anyway. Didn't you ever read _Space Regulations_?\nSection 19: 'The captain of a ship in flight is _solely responsible_\nfor the maintenance of discipline and his orders cannot be changed or\noverruled'.\"\n\n\"Swenson, you said a moment ago that this was your first suggestion. I\npresume, therefore, that you have others.\"\n\n\"I have two others.\" Swenson paused long enough for a brief study of\nhis Master Ship Location Chart, which he had just brought up to date.\nThe chart showed the position of all ships at the moment in space.\n\"There's a patrol cruiser loaded with gendarmes three million miles\nbehind you on a course paralleling yours. It's one of the new Arrow\nClass and if they blast full, they can catch you in ten hours. Mention\nto the crew that you could notify the police boys and have them pick\nyou up and escort you to Mars.\"\n\n\"What is the patrol ship's number and call letters?\"\n\n\"Arrow--British--Earth--number 96. Call letters MMXAH.\"\n\n\"Thanks. If things get too bad, I might take advantage of our\nvaliant guarders of the spaceways. All right, you said you had three\nsuggestions. What's the third?\"\n\n\"Some goons on a Moulton Trust ship, parked beside our number 2 on the\nMoon, started a fight and beat up our boys. We're about to sue Moulton\nfor plenty. Tell your crew about it and suggest that if they behave,\nwe'll cut them in on the proceeds from the suit, in addition to paying\ntheir wages as soon as a snuff cargo that I had to send into orbital\ngets to Mars.\"\n\n\"On whose authority am I to make such a statement?\"\n\n\"Swenson's. You don't need any other, do you? I know most of the boys\non your mobile junkyard. They trust me, so they'll trust you. You have\nmy word that Cerobie will go for the idea.\"\n\n\"You talk to Cerobie and let me know what happens. Meanwhile, I'll\nthink over your suggestions.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship-calling light blinked off and Swenson went back to coding the\nspeech insert.\n\nAs he was finishing, O'Toole came in.\n\nSwenson looked up. \"O'Toole, sure and it's one hell of a job you're\ndoing. You've got me in a fight with myself. My Swedish half wants to\nignore you and my Irish half wants to punch you in the nose. You're\nsupposed to handle labor relations. And I just received a message from\nCaptain Verbold of Number 5 that his crew is about to mutiny.\"\n\n\"Mother of God, what can I do?\" cried O'Toole. \"This outfit's so broke,\nit doesn't have enough money to pay the filing fee for bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"In the face of adversity, you should spit.\"\n\n\"Who are you quoting?\"\n\n\"Me.\"\n\n\"Look, Swenson, I'm supposed to supervise labor relations, sure. Labor\nis something you hire. That's done by paying wages--on time.\"\n\n\"At least you should have brains enough to understand the advantage of\nthe egg.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked O'Toole blankly.\n\n\"I've already explained it to you. Apparently it didn't get past your\nhair. I shall therefore make a second attempt. Do you understand the\nprinciple of the egg?\"\n\n\"I don't--\"\n\n\"Of course not. You never stopped to analyze it. You just assumed that\nbecause human beings are born the way they are, it is the best method.\nHow much pain and trouble does a hen have laying an egg? Does she--\"\n\n\"Getting back to number 5,\" O'Toole said firmly, \"what did Captain\nVerbold--\"\n\n\"Consider the advantage of the egg from another angle, O'Toole. Let's\nsay your wife lays an egg and, at the moment, you don't have money\nenough to support another child. All you would have to do is put the\negg in cold storage until your ship comes in. Then you can take the egg\nout and incubate it. Instead of being--\"\n\nThe click of the latch as O'Toole closed the door caused Swenson to\nspin in his chair. Tossing his pencil on the Dispatch Sheet, he put on\nhis coat and went home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the dispatcher for Acme Interplanetary Express arrived at the\noffice the following morning, a Special Message lay in sublime\nisolation on his desk. Swenson opened a beer and read the message.\n\n    _Board of Directors_\n    _Acme Interplanetary Express_\n    _Gentlemen_:\n\n    _Your restraining order concerning our ship at Luna City can only\n    be considered as representing a warped and intolerable concept of\n    justice. We will take every legal action available to us._\n\n    _Moreover, your action in refusing, without notice, a load which\n    we were so kind as to offer you and your immoral dealings in\n    contraband snuff force us to sever all commercial relations with\n    your organization._\n\n    _We are taking appropriate action with the Planetary Commerce\n    Commission._\n\n    _Yours sincerely_,\n    _Moulton Trust_\n    _Lesquallan Ltd._\n\nSwenson was smiling cherubically and bringing his Master Chart up to\ndate when O'Toole came in.\n\n\"Swenson, did you have eggs for breakfast? And how goes with the\ndispatch?\"\n\nCarefully noting the last change of ship position on the Master Chart,\nSwenson turned to O'Toole.\n\n\"Things are like so,\" he said, and drew a diagram.\n\nWhile O'Toole was studying the diagram, Swenson placed a call to\nMoulton Trust. \"Give me Esrov. Yes, Esrov himself. This is Swenson,\nAcme Interplanetary. If Esrov doesn't want to talk to me, jets to him,\nbut I think I have some information he can use.\"\n\n\"Will you please hold on, Mr. Swenson? I will convey your message.\"\n\nSwenson looked at O'Toole for a moment in silence. \"No, I don't like\neggs for eating. My theory concerns another aspect--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said O'Toole resignedly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEsrov's urbane voice came from the desk speaker. \"Mr. Swenson, you have\nsome information for us?\"\n\n\"Yes, Esrov. I've just seen your message to our Board and I want you to\nknow that I can certainly understand your position. I could not prevent\nthe restraining order. However, I have a suggestion as to what you can\ndo about it.\"\n\n\"We are doing everything we can.\"\n\n\"Didn't you support Senator Higby for re-election last year? Well, he\nhas shipped with us on an inspection tour of planetary outposts. Right\nnow, he's on the Moon and will speak at 1:30 this afternoon at the\nofficial opening of the new Recreation Center. It occurred to me that\nit might be worthwhile for you to send him a message suggesting that he\nincorporate in his speech something about the laxity of the Planetary\nCommerce Commission that allowed you to get into this mess.\"\n\n\"An excellent idea, Mr. Swenson. We shall give it immediate\nconsideration. And, by the way, if for any reason your employment with\nAcme should terminate, we should be able to find a suitable position\nfor you with our company.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Esrov.\" Swenson switched off the set.\n\n\"You dirty, stinking,\" O'Toole blared, \"doublecrossing--\"\n\n\"Calm down, O'Toole. Don't get off the rocket until she's on the\nground. I've got reasons.\"\n\n\"Reasons? You haven't even got _reason_! And you're a crook!\"\n\n\"Now don't let my Irish half get on top. I want that Senator to talk as\nlong as possible. Let's go back to the egg.\"\n\n\"You've laid it.\"\n\n\"For the last time, let me explain. If evolution had followed my\ntheory, I, being a man, would not lay eggs. Women would and therefore\nthey would escape--\"\n\n\"Swenson,\" Mister Cerobie called from the door of the Board Room, \"you\nare hired--tentatively--as a dispatcher, not an egg-evolution theorist.\nNow come in here. The Board wants to talk to you.\"\n\nSwenson jerked the diagram out of O'Toole's hand and followed Cerobie.\n\nTen minutes later, he came out of the Board Room, saying: \"Gentlemen,\nthe Senator speaks at 1:30 this afternoon. At 6:00 either fire me,\ncrucify me and make me drink boiled beer alone, or give me a raise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clock on the wall over the dispatcher's desk showed 2:59 when\nSwenson called Acme's Luna City Terminal. \"Dispatcher to Numbers 7\nand 4, have crew stand by to blast off in exactly 15 minutes. I don't\ngive a damn about regulations or the P.C.C. This is an order from your\ncompany. It must be obeyed. Number 7 will follow course as originally\nplanned--destination Mars. Number 4 will blast for Earth, curve to be\ngiven in space.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, the dispatcher's office at Acme Interplanetary\nExpress was quieter than an abandoned and forgotten tomb. The Board\nof Directors stood silently in a semi-circle behind Swenson. Every\nemployee, even the stenographers, were jammed into the frowsy room.\n\nAs the hand of the clock sliced off the last second of the 15 minutes,\nSwenson looked over his shoulder--and laughed, a great, resounding\nlaugh. Then he flicked the switch and picked up the microphone.\n\n\"Swenson dispatcher to 7 and 4. Blast! Over. Swenson dispatcher to 4\nand 7. Blast!\"\n\nSuddenly the silent room was filled with the roar of the jets as they\nthundered in the imaginations of the men and women crowded around the\ndispatcher's desk. The tension broke as almost a sob of gladness. What\nif it proved a hopeless dream, a mere stalling of inevitable ruin? They\nwere no longer grounded. They were in space.\n\nTo those in the room, it seemed only an instant until the ship-calling\nlight flashed on. \"Number 7 to dispatcher. In space. All clear.\"\n\n\"Dispatcher to Number 7, steady as she goes.\"\n\nThe red light was off for a moment. Then: \"Number 4 to dispatcher. In\nspace. All clear.\"\n\n\"Dispatcher to Number 4. Temporary curve A 17. Will send exact curve\nplot in half an hour.\" Swenson turned to the astrographer. \"Give me a\nplot for Chicago. I don't want to land her in this state. Just a matter\nof prudence. She's registered in this state.\"\n\nThe astrographer shouldered his way through the crowd. When he reached\nthe calculators, his swift fingers began pushing buttons. Swenson\nleaned back.\n\n\"Mischief, thou art a'space,\" he said. \"Now take whatever course thou\nwilt.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt 3:30, Swenson reached again for the microphone. \"Dispatcher to\nNumber 2. You are circling Earth at low orbital. Decelerate and drop\nto stratosphere. Maintain position over New York. Curve and blasting\ndata....\"\n\nAt 4:00, he called Max Zempky at _Telenews_. \"Anything frying at Luna?\"\n\n\"My God, yes! Senator Higby yapped sixteen minutes overtime and the\nshadow knife-edge caught everybody with their air tanks down. The\ncontrol crews were listening to the speech and there wasn't anybody\nleft to switch over the heating-cooling system. You've been to the\nMoon, so you know what happens. When day changes to night and you\nhaven't got any atmosphere, the temperature drops from boiling to\npractically absolute zero. Sure, the automatic controls worked, but\nthere wasn't any crew to adjust and service the heaters and coolers.\nIt's a mess. Say, haven't you got a ship or two up there?\"\n\n\"I got 'em out in time.\"\n\n\"Well, Moulton didn't. Their ship's been considerably damaged.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Max. Let me know if anything else breaks.\"\n\nWhile Swenson had been talking, two Special Messages and an astrogram\nhad been laid on his desk. He first read one of the Special Messages.\n\n    _Acme Interplanetary Express_\n    _147 Z Street_\n    _New York_\n    _Gentlemen_:\n\n    _We are holding you responsible for the damage to our ship Number\n    57, now on the Moon. The captain of your ship should have known the\n    potential danger and warned Senator Higby of the time factor._\n\n    _We will contact the PCC at once._\n\n    _F. K. Esrov_\n    _Moulton Trust_\n\nSwenson scribbled an answer and handed it to an assistant.\n\n    _Moulton Trust_\n\n    _Nuts, Esrov. You've got to think up something better than that. We\n    have no control over public officials, except during flight.\n    Bellyache all you want to the PCC._\n\n    _Sedately_,\n    _Swenson_\n\nThe astrogram was from Senator Hiram C. Higby:\n\n    MY BEING STRANDED ON MOON UNMITIGATED AND UNPARALLELED OUTRAGE.\n    MUST SPEAK AS SCHEDULED ON MARS. FIND ME TRANSPORTATION. WILL DEAL\n    LATER WITH YOUR COMPANY CONCERNING INFAMOUS TREATMENT.\n\n    SEN. HIRAM C. HIGBY\n\nSwenson replied:\n\n    UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE UNAVOIDABLE. YOUR SPEECH MAGNIFICENT. WILL\n    MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SECURE IMMEDIATE TRANSPORTATION TO MARS.\n\n    SWENSON\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe second Special Message was from the PCC and asked with crisp and\nblunt formality why two Acme ships, which had been officially grounded\nby the Commission, had blasted off the Moon.\n\nIn answer, Swenson was mild and apologetic. What else could he have\ndone? Surely the Commission must understand that his first duty was to\nsave his ships from damage. He had been informed by his captains that\nthe shadow knife-edge was almost due, and there was no possibility\nof the control crews servicing the temperature-change compensators in\ntime. It was an emergency. The matter of the grounding could be settled\nlater.\n\nWhen his answer was finished, he coded it, along with the Special\nMessage from Moulton Trust, the astrogram from Senator Higby, and his\nreplies. Finally, he coded the Special Message from PCC.\n\nThen he called Number 5.\n\n\"Number 5 to dispatcher. This is Verbold. What goes on now?\"\n\n\"You tell me. Dwelleth thy household in peace?\"\n\n\"For the moment.\"\n\n\"Have you followed my instructions?\"\n\n\"In general, yes.\"\n\n\"Did your crew hear Senator Higby's speech?\"\n\n\"Most of them. What else is there to do in this rat-trap?\"\n\n\"I could think of a lot of things. But as long as the crew heard the\nHonorable's spiel, that's all that matters. Do you know about the\nlittle affair half an hour ago at Luna City?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Check your news recorder. Have the item broadcast to the crew. Then\ndecode the sequence of messages I'm about to send and read them--at\nyour discretion--to the men. Stand by to record code.\"\n\nWhen he had finished, Swenson leaned back and opened a beer. \"All we\ncan do now is wait. But I'd give my grandmother's immortal soul, if the\nold shrew had one, to be in the sacred sanctum of Moulton Trust.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLesquallan sat on the edge of the long table in Moulton's Board Room.\nHe spoke slowly and for once his voice was low:\n\n\"Esrov, did you or did you not suggest to our Senator Higby that he\nlengthen his speech on the Moon to include certain new information? And\ndid that information involve my company along with yours?\"\n\n\"Mr. Lesquallan, the matter concerns only a minor aspect of policy,\"\nsaid Esrov placatingly.\n\n\"Minor aspect of policy, hell! It concerns business. Look what happened\nat Luna. And you let us get publicly involved in it. Such matters must\nnever be handled openly.\"\n\nEsrov did not answer.\n\n\"Did you send such a message, Rovance?\" Rovance shook his head.\nLesquallan turned to Neinfort-Whritings. \"Did you?\"\n\n\"No, Lesquallan.\" Neinfort-Whritings gently pulled a Special Message\nform from beneath Esrov's folded hands as they lay on the gleaming\nconference table.\n\nLesquallan swung back to Esrov. \"Did _you_ send it?\"\n\nEsrov looked down at his folded hands. At last he said quietly: \"Yes, I\nsent a message to the Senator--in our mutual interests.\"\n\n\"Was it your own idea? Or did someone else suggest it?\"\n\n\"The basic thought came from a most unexpected source. It was, we\nmight say, one of those happy breaks of industry. The dispatcher at\nAcme had the sense to cooperate with us. He gave me certain otherwise\nunavailable information, and--\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"I don't--oh, yes, it was Swenson.\"\n\n\"You ... you fool ... _idiot_!\"\n\nNeinfort-Whritings handed Lesquallan the Special Message he had taken\nfrom Esrov. It was the one from Swenson, which began: \"Nuts, Esrov.\"\n\nLesquallan read the message. Then he said slowly: \"I've dealt with that\nclown Swenson before--over minor matters. I never thought he had that\nmuch brains.\" He looked at Esrov. \"Or insight. Swenson's a smart man.\nTherefore, he must be eliminated.\"\n\n\"I still maintain,\" Rovance said, \"that the basis of the matter is the\nstrangling of free enterprise.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Lesquallan. \"What right has Acme to interfere with free\nenterprise? They haven't a dollar to our million.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" Neinfort-Whritings murmured.\n\n\"Follow Swenson's suggestion. We're going to the PCC--and we're going\nto our top contacts. They owe us plenty.\"\n\n\"Shall we dictate a memo?\" Esrov put in.\n\n\"Call the PCC,\" Lesquallan ordered. \"We're not dictating anything. And\nwe're not sending any messages to anybody. Let the PCC send them!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo employee of Acme Interplanetary Express had left the smoke-dense\noffice when the ship-calling light went on: \"Number 5 to Swenson.\nVerbold speaking.\"\n\n\"Dispatcher to Number 5. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Uproar under control. I followed your instructions. A crew that's\nlaughing won't mutiny. The crew sends thanks and their most pious\nwishes for the distress of Moulton. The men expect shares of the\nproceeds, if any, in the lawsuit. But they insist on being paid on\nMars.\"\n\n\"They will be, Captain Verbold. Now I've got to keep this beam clear.\nGood luck.\" Swenson turned to Mister Cerobie. \"I presume you can at\nleast find enough cash for the back pay?\"\n\nMister Cerobie did not answer. He was staring at a Special Message\nwhich had just been handed to him. He dropped it on Swenson's desk.\n\n    _Acme Interplanetary Express_\n    _147 Z Street_\n    _New York_\n\n    _Because of your violation of Space Regulations and unprecedented\n    effrontery, your ships Numbers 7 and 4 are hereby ordered to return\n    to the Moon. There they will be impounded. A police patrol escort\n    has been dispatched to insure your compliance with our order._\n\n    _Planetary Commerce Commission_\n\nSwenson read the message and looked up.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Mister Cerobie.\n\nThe murmur of voices died. The dispatcher's office of Acme\nInterplanetary Express was a silent, isolated world. Swenson wrote an\nastrogram and handed it to the Chairman of the Board.\n\n\"Shall I code it?\"\n\nMister Cerobie read the astrogram. He read it a second time and his\nperplexity vanished.\n\n\"But will it work?\" he asked.\n\nSwenson shrugged. \"It ought to. Remember what happened when Solar\nSystem Freight lost that chemical load? We're stratosphering over New\nYork. Anyway, he wouldn't dare take the chance. Shall I code it, Mister\nCerobie?\"\n\n\"Absolutely!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men and women of Acme crowded and squirmed for a look at the\nastrogram on Swenson's desk. O'Toole realized first and yelled. Slowly,\nas understanding came, other voices took it up, until the office was a\nchaos of sound. Bottles appeared from nowhere. O'Toole raised one of\nthem: \"Sure and St. Patrick would have loved it!\"\n\nCalmly, Swenson coded:\n\n    SENATOR HIRAM C. HIGBY\n    ACME INTERPLANETARY EXPRESS\n    LUNA CITY\n\n    ONLY TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE OUR SHIP NOW IN EARTH STRATOSPHERE\n    ABOVE NEW YORK WITH CARGO SNUFF.

ONLY ALTERNATIVE COMPLETE\n    CLEARANCE BY PCC OUR SHIPS NUMBERS 7 AND 4. WILL THEN DISPATCH ONE\n    OF THEM TO PICK YOU UP. ORDER TO JETTISON WILL BE GIVEN IN HALF AN\n    HOUR UNLESS WE RECEIVE WORD FROM YOU. HAVE YOU ANY INFLUENCE WITH\n    THE PCC? SEND REACTION AT ONCE. URGENCY OBVIOUS.\n\n    SWENSON\n\nThe dispatcher for Acme said to himself: \"I doubt very seriously if\nany sane Senator up for re-election would want the official records to\nshow that, because he talked too long on the Moon, a cargo of snuff was\ndumped over New York. Sneezing voters cannot see candidate's name on\nballot.\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, the replying astrogram was in Swenson's hand.\n\n    ACME INTERPLANETARY EXPRESS\n    147 Z STREET\n    NEW YORK\n    EARTH\n\n    ORDER CLEARING YOUR SHIPS 7 AND 4 APPROVED BY PCC.

HIGBY\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And that, Mister Cerobie,\" said Swenson, \"is how you slide out of a\njam. You'll get enough cash for that snuff haul to Mars to pay the crew\nof Number 5 when she lands there. And you'll have enough left over to\npay the demurrage and repair charges at Luna. Now open me a beer.\"\n\nMister Cerobie opened the beer wearily.\n\n\"You're fired, Swenson,\" he said. \"I'll be damned if I'll write another\nspeech or be your bartender.\"\n\nSwenson drank and smiled.\n\nThe ship-calling light flashed red. \"Number 3 to dispatcher. This\nis Captain Marwovan. Compartment holed by meteorite. Cannot land on\nGanymede until we make repairs. Send me the orbital curve so we can\ncircle until the hole is patched. And tell Mister Cerobie that the crew\nis complaining about back pay.\"\n\nTransferring the beer to his other hand, Swenson grabbed the\nmicrophone. \"Dispatcher to Number 3....\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Swenson, Dispatcher, by R.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
