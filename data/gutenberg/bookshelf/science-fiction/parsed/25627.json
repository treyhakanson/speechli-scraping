But they had to run head-on against a mad\n         genius who had a motto:_\n\n                        _Death to all Terrans!_\n\n\n\"Let's keep moving,\" I told Val. \"The surest way to die out here on Mars\nis to give up.\" I reached over and turned up the pressure on her oxymask\nto make things a little easier for her. Through the glassite of the\nmask, I could see her face contorted in an agony of fatigue.\n\nAnd she probably thought the failure of the sandcat was all my fault,\ntoo. Val's usually about the best wife a guy could ask for, but when she\nwants to be she can be a real flying bother.\n\nIt was beyond her to see that some grease monkey back at the Dome was at\nfault--whoever it was who had failed to fasten down the engine hood.\nNothing but what had stopped us _could_ stop a sandcat: sand in the\ndelicate mechanism of the atomic engine.\n\nBut no; she blamed it all on me somehow: So we were out walking on the\nspongy sand of the Martian desert. We'd been walking a good eight hours.\n\n\"Can't we turn back now, Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe there isn't any\nuranium in this sector at all. I think we're crazy to keep on searching\nout here!\"\n\nI started to tell her that the UranCo chief had assured me we'd hit\nsomething out this way, but changed my mind. When Val's tired and\noverwrought there's no sense in arguing with her.\n\nI stared ahead at the bleak, desolate wastes of the Martian landscape.\nBehind us somewhere was the comfort of the Dome, ahead nothing but the\nmazes and gullies of this dead world.\n\n[Illustration: He was a cripple in a wheelchair--helpless as a\nrattlesnake.]\n\n\"Try to keep going, Val.\" My gloved hand reached out and clumsily\nenfolded hers. \"Come on, kid. Remember--we're doing this for Earth.\nWe're heroes.\"\n\nShe glared at me. \"Heroes, hell!\" she muttered. \"That's the way it\nlooked back home, but, out there it doesn't seem so glorious. And\nUranCo's pay is stinking.\"\n\n\"We didn't come out here for the pay, Val.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, but just the same--\"\n\nIt must have been hell for her. We had wandered fruitlessly over the red\nsands all day, both of us listening for the clicks of the counter. And\nthe geigers had been obstinately hushed all day, except for their\nconstant undercurrent of meaningless noises.\n\nEven though the Martian gravity was only a fraction of Earth's, I was\nstarting to tire, and I knew it must have been really rough on Val with\nher lovely but unrugged legs.\n\n\"Heroes,\" she said bitterly. \"We're not heroes--we're suckers! Why did I\never let you volunteer for the Geig Corps and drag me along?\"\n\nWhich wasn't anywhere close to the truth. Now I knew she was at the\nbreaking point, because Val didn't lie unless she was so exhausted she\ndidn't know what she was doing. She had been just as much inflamed by\nthe idea of coming to Mars to help in the search for uranium as I was.\nWe knew the pay was poor, but we had felt it a sort of obligation,\nsomething we could do as individuals to keep the industries of\nradioactives-starved Earth going. And we'd always had a roving foot,\nboth of us.\n\nNo, we had decided together to come to Mars--the way we decided together\non everything. Now she was turning against me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI tried to jolly her. \"Buck up, kid,\" I said. I didn't dare turn up her\noxy pressure any higher, but it was obvious she couldn't keep going. She\nwas almost sleep-walking now.\n\nWe pressed on over the barren terrain. The geiger kept up a fairly\nsteady click-pattern, but never broke into that sudden explosive tumult\nthat meant we had found pay-dirt. I started to feel tired myself,\nterribly tired. I longed to lie down on the soft, spongy Martian sand\nand bury myself.\n\nI looked at Val. She was dragging along with her eyes half-shut. I felt\nalmost guilty for having dragged her out to Mars, until I recalled that\nI hadn't. In fact, she had come up with the idea before I did. I wished\nthere was some way of turning the weary, bedraggled girl at my side back\ninto the Val who had so enthusiastically suggested we join the Geigs.\n\nTwelve steps later, I decided this was about as far as we could go.\n\nI stopped, slipped out of the geiger harness, and lowered myself\nponderously to the ground. \"What'samatter, Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.\n\"Something wrong?\"\n\n\"No, baby,\" I said, putting out a hand and taking hers. \"I think we\nought to rest a little before we go any further. It's been a long, hard\nday.\"\n\nIt didn't take much to persuade her. She slid down beside me, curled up,\nand in a moment she was fast asleep, sprawled out on the sands.\n\n_Poor kid_, I thought. Maybe we shouldn't have come to Mars after all.\nBut, I reminded myself, _someone_ had to do the job.\n\nA second thought appeared, but I squelched it:\n\nWhy the hell me?\n\nI looked down at Valerie's sleeping form, and thought of our warm,\ncomfortable little home on Earth. It wasn't much, but people in love\ndon't need very fancy surroundings.\n\nI watched her, sleeping peacefully, a wayward lock of her soft blonde\nhair trailing down over one eyebrow, and it seemed hard to believe that\nwe'd exchanged Earth and all it held for us for the raw, untamed\nstruggle that was Mars. But I knew I'd do it again, if I had the chance.\nIt's because we wanted to keep what we had. Heroes? Hell, no. We just\nliked our comforts, and wanted to keep them. Which took a little work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Time to get moving._ But then Val stirred and rolled over in her sleep,\nand I didn't have the heart to wake her. I sat there, holding her,\nstaring out over the desert, watching the wind whip the sand up into\nweird shapes.\n\nThe Geig Corps preferred married couples, working in teams. That's what\nhad finally decided it for us--we were a good team. We had no ties on\nEarth that couldn't be broken without much difficulty. So we\nvolunteered.\n\n_And here we are._ Heroes. The wind blasted a mass of sand into my face,\nand I felt it tinkle against the oxymask.\n\nI glanced at the suit-chronometer. Getting late. I decided once again to\nwake Val. But she was tired. And I was tired too, tired from our\nwearying journey across the empty desert.\n\nI started to shake Val. But I never finished. It would be _so_ nice just\nto lean back and nuzzle up to her, down in the sand. So nice. I yawned,\nand stretched back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI awoke with a sudden startled shiver, and realized angrily I had let\nmyself doze off. \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely, and started to rise to\nmy feet.\n\nI couldn't.\n\nI looked down. I was neatly bound in thin, tough, plastic tangle-cord,\nswathed from chin to boot-bottoms, my arms imprisoned, my feet caught.\nAnd tangle-cord is about as easy to get out of as a spider's web is for\na trapped fly.\n\nIt wasn't Martians that had done it. There weren't any Martians, hadn't\nbeen for a million years. It was some Earthman who had bound us.\n\nI rolled my eyes toward Val, and saw that she was similarly trussed in\nthe sticky stuff. The tangle-cord was still fresh, giving off a faint,\nrepugnant odor like that of drying fish. It had been spun on us only a\nshort time ago, I realized.\n\n\"Ron--\"\n\n\"Don't try to move, baby. This stuff can break your neck if you twist it\nwrong.\" She continued for a moment to struggle futilely, and I had to\nsnap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\n\n\"A very wise statement,\" said a brittle, harsh voice from above me. I\nlooked up and saw a helmeted figure above us. He wasn't wearing the\ncustomary skin-tight pliable oxysuits we had. He wore an outmoded, bulky\nspacesuit and a fishbowl helmet, all but the face area opaque. The\noxygen cannisters weren't attached to his back as expected, though. They\nwere strapped to the back of the wheelchair in which he sat.\n\nThrough the fishbowl I could see hard little eyes, a yellowed,\nparchment-like face, a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize him, and this\nstruck me odd. I thought I knew everyone on sparsely-settled Mars.\nSomehow I'd missed him.\n\nWhat shocked me most was that he had no legs. The spacesuit ended neatly\nat the thighs.\n\nHe was holding in his left hand the tanglegun with which he had\nentrapped us, and a very efficient-looking blaster was in his right.\n\n\"I didn't want to disturb your sleep,\" he said coldly. \"So I've been\nwaiting here for you to wake up.\"\n\nI could just see it. He might have been sitting there for hours,\ncomplacently waiting to see how we'd wake up. That was when I realized\nhe must be totally insane. I could feel my stomach-muscles tighten, my\nthroat constrict painfully.\n\nThen anger ripped through me, washing away the terror. \"What's going\non?\" I demanded, staring at the half of a man who confronted us from the\nwheelchair. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"You'll find out soon enough,\" he said. \"Suppose now you come with me.\"\nHe reached for the tanglegun, flipped the little switch on its side to\nMELT, and shot a stream of watery fluid over our legs, keeping the\nblaster trained on us all the while. Our legs were free.\n\n\"You may get up now,\" he said. \"Slowly, without trying to make trouble.\"\nVal and I helped each other to our feet as best we could, considering\nour arms were still tightly bound against the sides of our oxysuits.\n\n\"Walk,\" the stranger said, waving the tanglegun to indicate the\ndirection. \"I'll be right behind you.\" He holstered the tanglegun.\n\nI glimpsed the bulk of an outboard atomic rigging behind him, strapped\nto the back of the wheelchair. He fingered a knob on the arm of the\nchair and the two exhaust ducts behind the wheel-housings flamed for a\nmoment, and the chair began to roll.\n\nObediently, we started walking. You don't argue with a blaster, even if\nthe man pointing it is in a wheelchair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's going on, Ron?\" Val asked in a low voice as we walked. Behind us\nthe wheelchair hissed steadily.\n\n\"I don't quite know, Val. I've never seen this guy before, and I thought\nI knew everyone at the Dome.\"\n\n\"Quiet up there!\" our captor called, and we stopped talking. We trudged\nalong together, with him following behind; I could hear the\n_crunch-crunch_ of the wheelchair as its wheels chewed into the sand. I\nwondered where we were going, and why. I wondered why we had ever left\nEarth.\n\nThe answer to that came to me quick enough: we had to. Earth needed\nradioactives, and the only way to get them was to get out and look. The\ngreat atomic wars of the late 20th Century had used up much of the\nsupply, but the amount used to blow up half the great cities of the\nworld hardly compared with the amount we needed to put them back\ntogether again.\n\nIn three centuries the shattered world had been completely rebuilt. The\nwreckage of New York and Shanghai and London and all the other ruined\ncities had been hidden by a shining new world of gleaming towers and\nflying roadways. We had profited by our grandparents' mistakes. They had\nused their atomics to make bombs. We used ours for fuel.\n\nIt was an atomic world. Everything: power drills, printing presses,\ntypewriters, can openers, ocean liners, powered by the inexhaustible\nenergy of the dividing atom.\n\nBut though the energy is inexhaustible, the supply of nuclei isn't.\nAfter three centuries of heavy consumption, the supply failed. The\nmighty machine that was Earth's industry had started to slow down.\n\nAnd that started the chain of events that led Val and me to end up as a\nmadman's prisoners, on Mars. With every source of uranium mined dry on\nEarth, we had tried other possibilities. All sorts of schemes came\nforth. Project Sea-Dredge was trying to get uranium from the oceans. In\nforty or fifty years, they'd get some results, we hoped. But there\nwasn't forty or fifty years' worth of raw stuff to tide us over until\nthen. In a decade or so, our power would be just about gone. I could\npicture the sort of dog-eat-dog world we'd revert back to. Millions of\nstarving, freezing humans tooth-and-clawing in it in the useless shell\nof a great atomic civilization.\n\nSo, Mars. There's not much uranium on Mars, and it's not easy to find or\nany cinch to mine. But what little is there, helps. It's a stopgap\neffort, just to keep things moving until Project Sea-Dredge starts\nfunctioning.\n\nEnter the Geig Corps: volunteers out on the face of Mars, combing for\nits uranium deposits.\n\nAnd here we are, I thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter we walked on a while, a Dome became visible up ahead. It slid up\nover the crest of a hill, set back between two hummocks on the desert.\nJust out of the way enough to escape observation.\n\nFor a puzzled moment I thought it was our Dome, the settlement where\nall of UranCo's Geig Corps were located, but another look told me that\nthis was actually quite near us and fairly small. A one-man Dome, of all\nthings!\n\n\"Welcome to my home,\" he said. \"The name is Gregory Ledman.\" He herded\nus off to one side of the airlock, uttered a few words keyed to his\nvoice, and motioned us inside when the door slid up. When we were inside\nhe reached up, clumsily holding the blaster, and unscrewed the ancient\nspacesuit fishbowl.\n\nHis face was a bitter, dried-up mask. He was a man who hated.\n\nThe place was spartanly furnished. No chairs, no tape-player, no\ndecoration of any sort. Hard bulkhead walls, rivet-studded, glared back\nat us. He had an automatic chef, a bed, and a writing-desk, and no other\nfurniture.\n\nSuddenly he drew the tanglegun and sprayed our legs again. We toppled\nheavily to the floor. I looked up angrily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I imagine you want to know the whole story,\" he said. \"The others did,\ntoo.\"\n\nValerie looked at me anxiously. Her pretty face was a dead white behind\nher oxymask. \"What others?\"\n\n\"I never bothered to find out their names,\" Ledman said casually. \"They\nwere other Geigs I caught unawares, like you, out on the desert. That's\nthe only sport I have left--Geig-hunting. Look out there.\"\n\nHe gestured through the translucent skin of the Dome, and I felt sick.\nThere was a little heap of bones lying there, looking oddly bright\nagainst the redness of the sands. They were the dried, parched skeletons\nof Earthmen. Bits of cloth and plastic, once oxymasks and suits, still\nclung to them.\n\nSuddenly I remembered. There had been a pattern there all the time. We\ndidn't much talk about it; we chalked it off as occupational hazards.\nThere had been a pattern of disappearances on the desert. I could think\nof six, eight names now. None of them had been particularly close\nfriends. You don't get time to make close friends out here. But we'd\nvowed it wouldn't happen to us.\n\nIt had.\n\n\"You've been hunting Geigs?\" I asked. \"_Why?_ What've they ever done to\nyou?\"\n\nHe smiled, as calmly as if I'd just praised his house-keeping. \"Because\nI hate you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend to wipe every last one of you\nout, one by one.\"\n\nI stared at him. I'd never seen a man like this before; I thought all\nhis kind had died at the time of the atomic wars.\n\nI heard Val sob, \"He's a madman!\"\n\n\"No,\" Ledman said evenly. \"I'm quite sane, believe me. But I'm\ndetermined to drive the Geigs--and UranCo--off Mars. Eventually I'll\nscare you all away.\"\n\n\"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Ledman. \"And I have no fears of an armed attack. This\nplace is well fortified. I've devoted years to building it. And I'm back\nagainst those hills. They couldn't pry me out.\" He let his pale hand run\nup into his gnarled hair. \"I've devoted years to this. Ever since--ever\nsince I landed here on Mars.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" Val finally asked, after a long\nsilence.\n\nHe didn't smile this time. \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not your husband. I\nwant him as an envoy, to go back and tell the others to clear off.\" He\nrocked back and forth in his wheelchair, toying with the gleaming,\ndeadly blaster in his hand.\n\nWe stared in horror. It was a nightmare--sitting there, placidly rocking\nback and forth, a nightmare.\n\nI found myself fervently wishing I was back out there on the infinitely\nsafer desert.\n\n\"Do I shock you?\" he asked. \"I shouldn't--not when you see my motives.\"\n\n\"We don't see them,\" I snapped.\n\n\"Well, let me show you. You're on Mars hunting uranium, right? To mine\nand ship the radioactives back to Earth to keep the atomic engines\ngoing. Right?\"\n\nI nodded over at our geiger counters.\n\n\"We volunteered to come to Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\n\n\"Ah--two young heroes,\" Ledman said acidly. \"How sad. I could almost\nfeel sorry for you. Almost.\"\n\n\"Just what is it you're after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\n\n\"Atomics cost me my legs,\" he said. \"You remember the Sadlerville\nBlast?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course.\" And I did, too. I'd never forget it. No one would. How\ncould I forget that great accident--killing hundreds, injuring thousands\nmore, sterilizing forty miles of Mississippi land--when the Sadlerville\npile went up?\n\n\"I was there on business at the time,\" Ledman said. \"I represented\nLedman Atomics. I was there to sign a new contract for my company. You\nknow who I am, now?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I was fairly well shielded when it happened. I never got the contract,\nbut I got a good dose of radiation instead. Not enough to kill me,\" he\nsaid. \"Just enough to necessitate the removal of--\" he indicated the\nempty space at his thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\" He gestured at the\nwheelchair blanket.\n\nI still didn't understand. \"But why kill us Geigs? _We_ had nothing to\ndo with it.\"\n\n\"You're just in this by accident,\" he said. \"You see, after the\nexplosion and the amputation, my fellow-members on the board of Ledman\nAtomics decided that a semi-basket case like myself was a poor risk as\nHead of the Board, and they took my company away. All quite legal, I\nassure you. They left me almost a pauper!\" Then he snapped the punchline\nat me.\n\n\"They renamed Ledman Atomics. Who did you say you worked for?\"\n\nI began, \"Uran--\"\n\n\"Don't bother. A more inventive title than Ledman Atomics, but not\nquite as much heart, wouldn't you say?\" He grinned. \"I saved for years;\nthen I came to Mars, lost myself, built this Dome, and swore to get\neven. There's not a great deal of uranium on this planet, but enough to\nkeep me in a style to which, unfortunately, I'm no longer accustomed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe consulted his wrist watch. \"Time for my injection.\" He pulled out the\ntanglegun and sprayed us again, just to make doubly certain. \"That's\nanother little souvenir of Sadlerville. I'm short on red blood\ncorpuscles.\"\n\nHe rolled over to a wall table and fumbled in a container among a pile\nof hypodermics. \"There are other injections, too. Adrenalin, insulin.\nOthers. The Blast turned me into a walking pin-cushion. But I'll pay it\nall back,\" he said. He plunged the needle into his arm.\n\nMy eyes widened. It was too nightmarish to be real. I wasn't seriously\nworried about his threat to wipe out the entire Geig Corps, since it was\nunlikely that one man in a wheelchair could pick us all off. No, it\nwasn't the threat that disturbed me, so much as the whole concept, so\nstrange to me, that the human mind could be as warped and twisted as\nLedman's.\n\nI saw the horror on Val's face, and I knew she felt the same way I did.\n\n\"Do you really think you can succeed?\" I taunted him. \"Really think you\ncan kill every Earthman on Mars? Of all the insane, cockeyed--\"\n\nVal's quick, worried head-shake cut me off. But Ledman had felt my\nwords, all right.\n\n\"Yes! I'll get even with every one of you for taking away my legs! If we\nhadn't meddled with the atom in the first place, I'd be as tall and\npowerful as you, today--instead of a useless cripple in a wheelchair.\"\n\n\"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,\" Val said quietly. \"You've conceived an\nimpossible scheme of revenge and now you're taking it out on innocent\npeople who've done nothing, nothing at all to you. That's not sane!\"\n\nHis eyes blazed. \"Who are you to talk of sanity?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUneasily I caught Val's glance from a corner of my eye. Sweat was\nrolling down her smooth forehead faster than the auto-wiper could swab\nit away.\n\n\"Why don't you do something? What are you waiting for, Ron?\"\n\n\"Easy, baby,\" I said. I knew what our ace in the hole was. But I had to\nget Ledman within reach of me first.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said. \"I'm going to turn you loose outside, right after--\"\n\n\"_Get sick!_\" I hissed to Val, low. She began immediately to cough\nviolently, emitting harsh, choking sobs. \"Can't breathe!\" She began to\nyell, writhing in her bonds.\n\nThat did it. Ledman hadn't much humanity left in him, but there was a\nlittle. He lowered the blaster a bit and wheeled one-hand over to see\nwhat was wrong with Val. She continued to retch and moan most horribly.\nIt almost convinced me. I saw Val's pale, frightened face turn to me.\n\nHe approached and peered down at her. He opened his mouth to say\nsomething, and at that moment I snapped my leg up hard, tearing the\ntangle-cord with a snicking rasp, and kicked his wheelchair over.\n\nThe blaster went off, burning a hole through the Dome roof. The\nautomatic sealers glued-in instantly. Ledman went sprawling helplessly\nout into the middle of the floor, the wheelchair upended next to him,\nits wheels slowly revolving in the air. The blaster flew from his hands\nat the impact of landing and spun out near me. In one quick motion I\nrolled over and covered it with my body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLedman clawed his way to me with tremendous effort and tried wildly to\npry the blaster out from under me, but without success. I twisted a bit,\nreached out with my free leg, and booted him across the floor. He\nfetched up against the wall of the Dome and lay there.\n\nVal rolled over to me.\n\n\"Now if I could get free of this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get him\ncovered before he comes to. But how?\"\n\n\"Teamwork,\" Val said. She swivelled around on the floor until her head\nwas near my boot. \"Push my oxymask off with your foot, if you can.\"\n\nI searched for the clamp and tried to flip it. No luck, with my heavy,\nclumsy boot. I tried again, and this time it snapped open. I got the tip\nof my boot in and pried upward. The oxymask came off, slowly, scraping a\njagged red scratch up the side of Val's neck as it came.\n\n\"There,\" she breathed. \"That's that.\"\n\nI looked uneasily at Ledman. He was groaning and beginning to stir.\n\nVal rolled on the floor and her face lay near my right arm. I saw what\nshe had in mind. She began to nibble the vile-tasting tangle-cord,\nrunning her teeth up and down it until it started to give. She continued\nunfailingly.\n\nFinally one strand snapped. Then another. At last I had enough use of my\nhand to reach out and grasp the blaster. Then I pulled myself across the\nfloor to Ledman, removed the tanglegun, and melted the remaining\ntangle-cord off.\n\nMy muscles were stiff and bunched, and rising made me wince. I turned\nand freed Val. Then I turned and faced Ledman.\n\n\"I suppose you'll kill me now,\" he said.\n\n\"No. That's the difference between sane people and insane,\" I told him.\n\"I'm not going to kill you at all. I'm going to see to it that you're\nsent back to Earth.\"\n\n\"_No!_\" he shouted. \"No! Anything but back there. I don't want to face\nthem again--not after what they did to me--\"\n\n\"Not so loud,\" I broke in. \"They'll help you on Earth. They'll take all\nthe hatred and sickness out of you, and turn you into a useful member of\nsociety again.\"\n\n\"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat out. \"I hate all of them.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said sarcastically. \"You're just all full of hate. You hated\nus so much that you couldn't bear to hang around on Earth for as much as\na year after the Sadlerville Blast. You had to take right off for Mars\nwithout a moment's delay, didn't you? You hated Earth so much you _had_\nto leave.\"\n\n\"Why are you telling all this to me?\"\n\n\"Because if you'd stayed long enough, you'd have used some of your\npension money to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic legs, and then you\nwouldn't need this wheelchair.\"\n\nLedman scowled, and then his face went belligerent again. \"They told me\nI was paralyzed below the waist. That I'd never walk again, even with\nprosthetic legs, because I had no muscles to fit them to.\"\n\n\"You left Earth too quickly,\" Val said.\n\n\"It was the only way,\" he protested. \"I had to get off--\"\n\n\"She's right,\" I told him. \"The atom can take away, but it can give as\nwell. Soon after you left they developed _atomic-powered_\nprosthetics--amazing things, virtually robot legs. All the survivors of\nthe Sadlerville Blast were given the necessary replacement limbs free of\ncharge. All except you. You were so sick you had to get away from the\nworld you despised and come here.\"\n\n\"You're lying,\" he said. \"It's not true!\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\n\nI saw him wilt visibly, and for a moment I almost felt sorry for him, a\npathetic legless figure propped up against the wall of the Dome at\nblaster-point. But then I remembered he'd killed twelve Geigs--or\nmore--and would have added Val to the number had he had the chance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're a very sick man, Ledman,\" I said. \"All this time you could have\nbeen happy, useful on Earth, instead of being holed up here nursing your\nhatred. You might have been useful, on Earth. But you decided to channel\neverything out as revenge.\"\n\n\"I still don't believe it--those legs. I might have walked again.\nNo--no, it's all a lie. They told me I'd never walk,\" he said, weakly\nbut stubbornly still.\n\nI could see his whole structure of hate starting to topple, and I\ndecided to give it the final push.\n\n\"Haven't you wondered how I managed to break the tangle-cord when I\nkicked you over?\"\n\n\"Yes--human legs aren't strong enough to break tangle-cord that way.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" I said. I gave Val the blaster and slipped out of my\noxysuit. \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to my smooth, gleaming metal legs.\nThe almost soundless purr of their motors was the only noise in the\nroom. \"I was in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\" I said. \"But I didn't go\ncrazy with hate when I lost _my_ legs.\"\n\nLedman was sobbing.\n\n\"Okay, Ledman,\" I said. Val got him into his suit, and brought him the\nfishbowl helmet. \"Get your helmet on and let's go. Between the psychs\nand the prosthetics men, you'll be a new man inside of a year.\"\n\n\"But I'm a murderer!\"\n\n\"That's right. And you'll be sentenced to psych adjustment. When they're\nfinished, Gregory Ledman the killer will be as dead as if they'd\nelectrocuted you, but there'll be a new--and sane--Gregory Ledman.\" I\nturned to Val.\n\n\"Got the geigers, honey?\"\n\nFor the first time since Ledman had caught us, I remembered how tired\nVal had been out on the desert. I realized now that I had been driving\nher mercilessly--me, with my chromium legs and atomic-powered muscles.\nNo wonder she was ready to fold! And I'd been too dense to see how\nunfair I had been.\n\nShe lifted the geiger harnesses, and I put Ledman back in his\nwheelchair.\n\nVal slipped her oxymask back on and fastened it shut.\n\n\"Let's get back to the Dome in a hurry,\" I said. \"We'll turn Ledman over\nto the authorities. Then we can catch the next ship for Earth.\"\n\n\"Go back? _Go back?_ If you think I'm backing down now and quitting you\ncan find yourself another wife! After we dump this guy I'm sacking in\nfor twenty hours, and then we're going back out there to finish that\nsearch-pattern. Earth needs uranium, honey, and I know you'd never be\nhappy quitting in the middle like that.\" She smiled. \"I can't wait to\nget out there and start listening for those tell-tale clicks.\"\n\nI gave a joyful whoop and swung her around. When I put her down, she\nsqueezed my hand, hard.\n\n\"Let's get moving, fellow hero,\" she said.\n\nI pressed the stud for the airlock, smiling.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ September 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
