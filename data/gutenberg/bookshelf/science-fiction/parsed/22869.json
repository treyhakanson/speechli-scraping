For almost half a minute, eyes wide with fear, he lay in the\nsilence of the gloomy room, straining to hear some sound, some\nindication of their presence.\n\nBut the only sound was the barely audible hum of his wrist watch and the\ndismal splatter of raindrops on the cobbled street outside. There was no\nsound to feed his fear, yet he knew then, without a flicker of doubt,\nthat they were going to kill him.\n\nHe shook his head, trying to clear the sleep from his brain as he turned\nthe idea over and over in his mind. He wondered why he hadn't realized\nit before, long before, back when they had first started this horrible,\nnerve-wracking cat-and-mouse game. The idea just hadn't occurred to him.\nBut he knew the game-playing was over. They wanted to kill him now. And\nhe knew that ultimately they _would_ kill him. There was no way for him\nto escape.\n\nHe sat up on the edge of the bed, painfully, perspiration standing out\non his bare back, and he waited, listening. How could he have slept,\nexposing himself so helplessly? Every ounce of his energy, all the skill\nand wit and shrewdness at his command were necessary in this cruel hunt;\nyet he had taken the incredibly terrible chance of sleeping, of losing\nconsciousness, leaving himself wide open and helpless against the attack\nwhich he knew was inevitable.\n\nHow much had he lost? How close had they come while he slept?\n\nFearfully, he walked to the window, peered out, and felt his muscles\nrelax a little. The gray, foggy streets were still light. He still had a\nlittle time before the terrible night began.\n\nHe stumbled across the small, old-fashioned room, sensing that action of\nsome sort was desperately needed. The bathroom was tiny; he stared in\nthe battered, stained reflector unit, shocked at the red-eyed\nstubble-faced apparition that stared back at him.\n\nThis is Harry Scott, he thought, thirty-two years old, and in the prime\nof life, but not the same Harry Scott who started out on a ridiculous\nquest so many months ago. This Harry Scott was being hunted like an\nanimal, driven by fear, helpless, and sure to die, unless he could find\nan escape, somehow. But there were too many of them for him to escape,\nand they were too clever, and they _knew_ he knew too much.\n\nHe stepped into the shower-shave unit, trying to relax, to collect his\nracing thoughts. Above all, he tried to stay the fear that burned\nthrough his mind, driving him to panic and desperation. The memory of\nthe last hellish night was too stark to allow relaxation--the growing\nfear, the silent, desperate hunt through the night; the realization that\ntheir numbers were increasing; his frantic search for a hiding place in\nthe New City; and finally his panic-stricken, pell-mell flight down into\nthe alleys and cobbled streets and crumbling frame buildings of the Old\nCity.... Even more horrible, the friends who had turned on him, who\nturned out to be _like_ them.\n\nBack in the bedroom, he lay down again, his body still tense. There were\nsounds in the building, footsteps moving around on the floor overhead, a\ndoor banging somewhere. With every sound, every breath of noise, his\nmuscles tightened still further, freezing him in fear. His own breath\nwas shallow and rapid in his ears as he lay, listening, waiting.\n\nIf only something would happen! He wanted to scream, to bang his head\nagainst the wall, to run about the room smashing his fist into doors,\nbreaking every piece of furniture. It was the _waiting_, the eternal\nwaiting, and running, waiting some more, feeling the net drawing tighter\nand tighter as he waited, feeling the measured, unhurried tread behind\nhim, always following, coming closer and closer, as though he were a\nmouse on a string, twisting and jerking helplessly.\n\nIf only they would move, do something he could counter.\n\nBut he wasn't even sure any more that he could detect them. And they\nwere so careful never to move into the open.\n\nHe jumped up feverishly, moved to the window, and peered between the\nslats of the dusty, old-fashioned blind at the street below.\n\nAn empty street at first, wet, gloomy. He saw no one. Then he caught the\nflicker of light in an entry several doors down and across the street,\nas a dark figure sparked a cigarette to life. Harry felt the chill run\ndown his back again. Still there, then, still waiting, a hidden figure,\nalways present, always waiting....\n\nHarry's eyes scanned the rest of the street rapidly. Two three-wheelers\nrumbled by, their rubber hissing on the wet pavement. One of them\ncarried the blue-and-white of the Old City police, but the car didn't\nslow up or hesitate as it passed the dark figure in the doorway. They\nwould never help me anyway, Harry thought bitterly. He had tried that\nbefore, and met with ridicule and threats. There would be no help from\nthe police in the Old City.\n\nAnother figure came around a corner. There was something vaguely\nfamiliar about the tall body and broad shoulders as the man walked\nacross the wet street, something Harry faintly recognized from somewhere\nduring the spinning madness of the past few weeks.\n\nThe man's eyes turned up toward the window for the briefest instant,\nthen returned steadfastly to the street. Oh, they were sly! You could\nnever spot them looking at you, never for _sure_, but they were always\nthere, always nearby. And there was no one he could trust any longer, no\none to whom he could turn.\n\nNot even George Webber.\n\nSwiftly his mind reconsidered that possibility as he watched the figure\nmove down the street. True, Dr. Webber had started him out on this\nsearch in the first place. But even Webber would never believe what he\nhad found. Webber was a scientist, a researcher.\n\nWhat could he do--go to Webber and tell him that there were men alive in\nthe world who were _not_ men, who were somehow men and something more?\n\nCould he walk into Dr. Webber's office in the Hoffman Medical Center,\nwalk through the gleaming bright corridors, past the shining metallic\ndoors, and tell Dr. Webber that he had found people alive in the world\nwho could actually see in four dimensions, live in four dimensions,\n_think_ in four dimensions?\n\nCould he explain to Dr. Webber that he knew this simply because in some\nway he had sensed them, and traced them, and discovered them; that he\nhad not one iota of proof, except that he was being followed by them,\nhunted by them, even now, in a room in the Old City, waiting for them to\nstrike him down?\n\nHe shook his head, almost sobbing. That was what was so horrible. He\ncouldn't tell Webber, because Webber would be certain that he had gone\nmad, just like the rest. He couldn't tell anyone, he couldn't do\nanything. He could just wait, and run, and wait--\n\nIt was almost dark now and the creaking of the old board house\nintensified the fear that tore at Harry Scott's mind. Tonight was the\nnight; he was sure of it. Maybe he had been foolish in coming here to\nthe slum area, where the buildings were relatively unguarded, where\nanybody could come and go as he pleased. But the New City had hardly\nbeen safer, even in the swankiest private chamber in the highest\nbuilding. They had had agents there, too, hunting him, driving home the\nbitter lesson of fear they had to teach him. Now he was afraid enough;\nnow they were ready to kill him.\n\nDown below he heard a door bang, and he froze, his back against the\nwall. There were footsteps, quiet voices, barely audible. His whole body\nshook and his eyes slid around to the window. The figure in the doorway\nstill waited--but the other figure was not visible. He heard the steps\non the stair, ascending slowly, steadily, a tread that paced itself with\nthe powerful throbbing of his own pulse.\n\nThen the telephone screamed out--\n\nHarry gasped. The footsteps were on the floor below, moving steadily\nupward. The telephone rang again and again; the shrill jangling filled\nthe room insistently. He waited until he couldn't wait any longer. His\nhand fumbled in a pocket and leveled a tiny, dull-gray metal object at\nthe door. With the other hand, he took the receiver from the hook.\n\n\"Harry! Is that you?\"\n\nHis throat was like sandpaper and the words came out in a rasp. \"What is\nit?\"\n\n\"Harry, this is George--George Webber.\"\n\nHis eyes were glued to the door. \"All right. What do you want?\"\n\n\"You've got to come talk to us, Harry. We've been waiting for weeks now.\nYou promised us. We've _got_ to talk to you.\"\n\nHarry still watched the door, but his breath came easier. The footsteps\nmoved with ridiculous slowness up the stairs, down the hall toward the\nroom.\n\n\"What do you want me to do? They've come to kill me.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. \"Harry, are you sure?\"\n\n\"Dead sure.\"\n\n\"Can you make a break for it?\"\n\nHarry blinked. \"I could try. But it won't do any good.\"\n\n\"Well, at least try, Harry. Get here to the Hoffman Center. We'll help\nyou all we can.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\" Harry's words were hardly audible as he set the receiver\ndown with a trembling hand.\n\nThe room was silent. The footsteps had stopped. A wave of panic passed\nup Harry's spine; he crossed the room, threw open the door, stared up\nand down the hall, unbelieving.\n\nThe hall was empty. He started down toward the stairs at a dead run, and\nthen, too late, saw the faint golden glow of a Parkinson Field across\nthe dingy corridor. He gasped in fear, and screamed out once as he\nstruck it.\n\nAnd then, for seconds stretching into hours, he heard his scream echoing\nand re-echoing down long, bitter miles of hollow corridor.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nGeorge Webber leaned back in the soft chair, turning a quizzical glance\ntoward the younger man across the room. He lit a long black cigar.\n\n\"Well?\" His heavy voice boomed out in the small room. \"Now that we've\ngot him here, what do you think?\"\n\nThe younger man glanced uncomfortably through the glass wall panel into\nthe small dark room beyond. In the dimness, he could barely make out the\nstill form on the bed, grotesque with the electrode-vernier apparatus\nalready in place at its temples. Dr. Manelli looked away sharply, and\nleafed through the thick sheaf of chart papers in his hand.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said dully. \"I just don't know what to think.\"\n\nThe other man's laugh seemed to rise from the depths of his huge chest.\nHis heavy face creased into a thousand wrinkles. Dr. Webber was a large\nman, his broad shoulders carrying a suggestion of immense power that\nmatched the intensity of his dark, wide-set eyes. He watched Dr.\nManelli's discomfort grow, saw the younger doctor's ears grow red, and\nthe almost cruel lines in his face were masked as he laughed still\nlouder.\n\n\"Trouble with you, Frank, you just don't have the courage of your\nconvictions.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't see anything so funny about it!\" Manelli's eyes were\nangry. \"The man has a suspicious syndrome--so you've followed him, and\nspied on him for weeks on end, which isn't exactly highest ethical\npractice in collecting a history. I still can't see how you're\njustified.\"\n\nDr. Webber snorted, tossing his cigar down on the desk with disgust.\n\"The man is insane. That's my justification. He's out of touch with\nreality. He's wandered into a wild, impossible, fantastic dream world.\nAnd we've got to get him out of it, because what he knows, what he's\ntrying to hide from us, is so incredibly dangerous that we don't dare\nlet him go.\"\n\nThe big man stared at Manelli, his dark eyes flashing. \"Can't you see\nthat? Or would you rather sit back and let Harry Scott go the way that\nPaulus and Wineberg and the others went?\"\n\n\"But to use the Parkinson Field on him--\" Dr. Manelli shook his head\nhopelessly. \"He'd offered to come over, George. We didn't need to use\nit.\"\n\n\"Sure, he offered to come--fine, fine. But supposing he changed his mind\non the way? For all we know, he had us figured into his paranoia, too,\nand never would have come near the Hoffman Center.\"\n\nDr. Webber shook his head. \"We're not playing a game any more, Frank.\nGet that straight. I thought it was a game a couple of years ago, when\nwe first started. But it ceased to be a game when men like Paulus and\nWineberg walked in sane, healthy men, and came out blubbering idiots.\nThat's no game any more. We're onto something big. And, if Harry Scott\ncan lead us to the core of it, then I can't care too much what happens\nto Harry Scott.\"\n\nDr. Manelli stood up sharply, walked to the window, and looked down over\nthe bright, clean buildings of the Hoffman Medical Center. Out across\nthe terraced park that surrounded the glassed towers and shining metal\nof the Center rose the New City, tier upon tier of smooth, functional\narchitecture, a city of dreams built up painfully out of the rubble of\nthe older, ruined city.\n\n\"You could kill him,\" the young man said finally. \"The psycho-integrator\nisn't any standard interrogative technique; it's dangerous and\ntreacherous. You never know for sure just what you're doing when you dig\ndown into a man's brain tissue with those little electrode probes.\"\n\n\"But we can learn the truth about Harry Scott,\" Dr. Webber broke in.\n\"Six months ago, Harry Scott was working with us, a quiet, affable,\npleasant young fellow, extremely intelligent, intensely co-operative. He\nwas just the man we needed to work with us, an engineer who could take\nour data and case histories, study them, and subject them to a\ncompletely nonmedical analysis. Oh, we had to have it done--the\nproblem's been with us for a hundred years now, growing ever since the\n1950s and 60s--insanity in the population, growing, spreading without\nrhyme or reason, insinuating itself into every nook and cranny of our\ncivilized life.\"\n\nThe big man blinked at Manelli. \"Harry Scott was the new approach. We\nwere too close to the problem. We needed a nonmedical outsider to take a\nlook, to tell us what we were missing. So Harry Scott walked into the\nproblem, and then abruptly lost contact with us. We finally track him\ndown and find him gone, out of touch with reality, on the same wretched\nroad that all the others went. With Harry, it's paranoia. He's being\npersecuted; he has the whole world against him, but most important--the\nfactor we don't dare overlook--_he's no longer working on the problem_.\"\n\nManelli shifted uneasily. \"I suppose that's right.\"\n\n\"Of course it's right!\" Dr. Webber's eyes flashed. \"Harry found\nsomething in those statistics. Something about the data, or the case\nhistories; or something Harry Scott himself dug up opened a door for him\nto go through, a door that none of us ever dreamed existed. We don't\nknow what he found on the other side of that door. Oh, we know what he\n_thinks_ he found, all this garbage about people that look normal but\nwalk through walls when nobody's looking, who think around corners\ninstead of in straight-line logic. But what he _really_ found there, we\ndon't have any way of telling. We just know that whatever he _really_\nfound is something new, something unsuspected; something so dangerous it\ncan drive an intelligent man into the wildest delusions of paranoid\npersecution.\"\n\nA new light appeared in Dr. Manelli's eyes as he faced the other doctor.\n\"Wait a minute,\" he said softly. \"The integrator is an _experimental_\ninstrument, too.\"\n\nDr. Webber smiled slyly. \"Now you're beginning to think,\" he said.\n\n\"But you'll see only what Scott himself believes. And _he_ thinks his\nstory is true.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to break his story.\"\n\n\"_Break_ it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. For some reason, this delusion of persecution is far safer\nfor Harry Scott than facing what he really found out. What we've got to\ndo is to make this delusion _less_ safe than the truth.\"\n\nThe room was silent for a long moment. Manelli looked up, his fingers\ntrembling. \"Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"It's very simple. Up to now, Harry Scott has had _delusions_ of\npersecution. But now we're _really_ going to persecute Harry Scott, as\nhe's never been persecuted before.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAt first he thought he was at the bottom of a deep well and he lay quite\nstill, his eyes clamped shut, wondering where he was and how he could\npossibly have gotten there. He could feel the dampness and chill of the\nstone floor under him, and nearby he heard the damp, insistent drip of\nwater splashing against stone. He felt his muscles tighten as the\ndripping sound forced itself against his senses. Then he opened his\neyes.\n\nHis first impulse was to scream out wildly in unreasoning, suffocating\nfear. He fought it down, struggling to sit up in the blackness, his\nwhole mind turned in bitter, hopeless hatred at the ones who had hunted\nhim for so long, and now had trapped him.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy did they torture him? Why not kill him outright, have done with it?\nHe shuddered, and struggled to his feet, staring about him in horror.\n\nIt was not a well, but a small room, circular, with little rivulets of\nstale water running down the granite walls. The ceiling closed low over\nhis head, and the only source of light came from the single doorway\nopening into a long, low stone passageway.\n\nWave after wave of panic rose in Harry's throat. Each time he fought\ndown the urge to scream, to lie down on the ground and cover his face\nwith his hands and scream in helpless fear. How could they have known\nthe horror that lay in his own mind, the horror of darkness, of damp\nslimy walls and scurrying rodents, of the clinging, stale humidity of\ndungeon passageways? He himself had seldom recalled it, except in his\nmost hideous dreams, yet he had known such fear as a boy, so many years\nago, and now it was all around him. They had known somehow and _used it\nagainst him_.\n\nWhy?\n\nHe sank down on the floor, his head in his hands, trying to think\nstraight, to find some clue in the turmoil bubbling through his mind\nthat would tell him what had happened.\n\nHe had started down the hallway from his room, to find Dr. Webber and\ntell him about the other people--\n\nHe stopped short, looked up wide-eyed. _Had_ he been going to Dr.\nWebber? Had he actually decided to go? Perhaps--yes, perhaps he had,\nthough Webber would only laugh at such a ridiculous story. But the\nnot-men who had hunted him would not laugh; to them, it would not be\nfunny. They knew that it was true. And they knew he knew it was true.\n\n_But why not kill him?_ Why this torture? Why this horrible persecution\nthat dug into the depths of his own nightmares to haunt him?\n\nHis breath came fast and a chilly sweat broke out on his forehead.\n_Where_ was he? Was this some long forgotten vault in the depths of the\nOld City? Or was this another place, another world, perhaps, that the\nnot-men, with their impossible powers, had created to torture him?\n\nHis eyes sought the end of the hall, saw the turn at the end, saw the\nlight which seemed to come from the end; and then in an instant he was\nrunning down the damp passageway, his pulse pounding at his temples,\nuntil he could hardly gasp enough breath as he ran. Finally he reached\nthe turn in the corridor where the light was brighter, and he swung\naround to stare at the source of the light, a huge, burning, smoky torch\nwhich hung from the wall.\n\nEven as he looked at it, the torch went out, shutting him into inky\nblackness. The only sound at first was the desperation of his own\nbreath; then he heard little scurrying sounds around his feet, and\nscreamed involuntarily as something sleek and four-footed jumped at his\nchest with snapping jaws.\n\nShuddering, he fought the thing off, his fingers closing on wiry fur as\nhe caught and squeezed. The thing went limp, and suddenly melted in his\nhands. He heard it splash as it struck the damp ground at his feet.\n\n_What were they doing to his mind?_\n\nHe screamed out in horror, and followed the echoes of his own scream as\nhe ran down the stone corridor, blindly, slipping on the wet stone\nfloor, falling on his knees into inches of brackish water, scraping back\nto his feet with an uncontrollable convulsion of fear and loathing, only\nto run more--\n\nThe corridor suddenly broke into two and he stopped short. He didn't\nknow how far, or how long, he had run, but it suddenly occurred to him\nthat he was still alive, still safe. Only his mind was under attack,\nonly his mind was afraid, teetering on the edge of control. And this\nmaze of dungeon tunnels--where could such a thing exist, so perfectly\noutfitted to horrify him, so neatly fitting into his own pattern of\nchildhood fears and terrors; from where could such a _very individual_\nattack on his sanity have sprung? From nowhere except....\n\n_Except from his own mind!_\n\nFor an instant, he saw a flicker of light, thought he grasped the edge\nof a concept previously obscure to him. He stared around him, at the\nmist swirling down the damp, dark corridor, and thought of the rat that\nhad melted in his hand. Suddenly, his mind was afire, searching through\nhis experience with the strange not-men he had learned to detect, trying\nto remember everything he had learned and deduced about them before they\nbegan their brutal persecution.\n\nThey were men, and they looked like men, but they were different. They\nhad other properties of mind, other capabilities that men did not have.\n\nThey were not-men. They could exist, and co-exist, two people in one\nframe, one person known, realized by all who saw, the other one\nconcealed except from those who learned how to look. They could use\ntheir minds; they could rationalize correctly; they could use their\ncurious four-dimensional knowledge to bring them to answers no\nthree-dimensional man could reach.\n\n_But they couldn't project into men's minds!_\n\nCarefully, Harry peered down the misty tunnels. They were clever, these\ncreatures, and powerful. Since they had discovered that he knew them,\nthey had done their work of fear and terror on his mind skillfully. But\nthey were limited, too; they couldn't make things happen that were not\ntrue--fantasies, illusions....\n\nYes, this dungeon was an illusion. It _had_ to be.\n\nHe cursed and started down the right-hand corridor, his heart sinking.\nThere was no such place and he knew it. He was walking in a dream, a\nfantasy that had no substance, that could do no more than frighten him,\ndrive him insane; yet he must already have lost his mind to be accepting\nsuch an illusion.\n\nWhy had he delayed? Why hadn't he gone to the Hoffman Center, laid the\nwhole story before Dr. Webber and Dr. Manelli at the very first, told\nthem what he had found? True, they might have thought him insane, but\nthey wouldn't have put him to torture. They might even have believed him\nenough to investigate what he told them, and then the cat would have\nbeen out of the bag. The tale would have been incredible, but at least\nhis mind would have been safe.\n\nHe turned down another corridor and walked suddenly into waist-deep\nwater, so cold it numbed his legs. He stopped again to force back the\ntendrils of unreasoning horror that brushed his mind. Nothing could\nreally harm him. He would merely wait until his mind finally reached a\nbalance again. There might be no end; it might be a ghastly trap, but he\nwould wait.\n\nStrangely, the mist was becoming greenish in color as it swirled toward\nhim in the damp vaulted passageway. His eyes began watering a little and\nthe lining of his nose started to burn. He stopped short, newly alarmed,\nand stared at the walls, rubbing the tears away to clear his vision. The\ngreenish-yellow haze grew thicker, catching his eyes and burning like a\nthousand furies, ripping into his throat until he was choking and\ncoughing, as though great knives sliced through his lungs.\n\nHe tried to scream, and started running, blindly. Each gasping breath\nwas an agony as the blistering gas dug deeper and deeper into his lungs.\nReason departed from him; he was screaming incoherently as he stumbled\nup a stony ramp, crashed into a wall, spun around and smashed blindly\ninto another. Then something caught at his shirt.\n\nHe felt the heavy planks and pounded iron scrollwork of a huge door, and\nthrew himself upon it, wrenching at the old latch until the door swung\nopen with a screech of rusty hinges. He fell forward on his face, and\nthe door swung shut behind him.\n\nHe lay face down, panting and sobbing in the stillness.\n\nCoarse hands grasped his collar, jerking him rudely to his feet, and he\nopened his eyes. Across the dim, vaulted room he could see the shadowy\nform of a man, a big man, with a broad chest and powerful shoulders, a\nman whose rich voice Harry almost recognized, but whose face was deep in\nshadow. As Harry wiped the tears from his tortured eyes, he heard the\nman's voice rumble out at him:\n\n\"Perhaps you've had enough now to change your mind about telling us the\ntruth.\"\n\nHarry stared, not quite comprehending. \"The--the truth?\"\n\nThe man's voice was harsh, cutting across the room impatiently. \"The\ntruth, I said. The problem, you fool, what you saw, what you learned;\nyou know perfectly well what I'm referring to. But we'll swallow no more\nof this silly four-dimensional superman tale, so don't bother to start\nit.\"\n\n\"I--I don't understand you. It's--it's true--\" Again he tried to peer\nacross the room. \"Why are you hunting me like this? What are you trying\nto do to me?\"\n\n\"We want the truth. We want to know what you saw.\"\n\n\"But--but _you're_ what I saw. You know what I found out. I mean--\" He\nstopped, his face going white. His hand went to his mouth, and he\nstared still harder. \"Who are you?\" he whispered.\n\n\"The truth!\" the man roared. \"You'd better be quick, or you'll be back\nin the corridor.\"\n\n\"_Webber!_\"\n\n\"Your last chance, Harry.\"\n\nWithout warning, Harry was across the room, flying across the desk,\ncrashing into the big man's chest. With a scream of fury he fought,\ndriving his fists into the powerful chest, wrenching at the thick,\nflailing arms of the startled man.\n\n\"_It's you!_\" he screamed. \"It's you that's been torturing me. It's you\nthat's been hunting me down all this time, not the other people, you and\nyour crowd of ghouls have been at my throat!\"\n\nHe threw the big man off balance, dropped heavily on him as he fell back\nto the ground, glared down into the other's angry brown eyes.\n\nAnd then, as though he had never been there at all, the big man\nvanished, and Harry sat back on the floor, his whole body shaking with\nfrustrated sobs as his mind twisted in anguish.\n\nHe had been wrong, completely wrong, ever since he had discovered the\nnot-men. Because he had thought _they_ had been the ones who hunted and\ntortured him for so long. And now he knew how far he had been wrong. For\nthe face of the shadowy man, the man behind the nightmare he was living,\nwas the face of Dr. George Webber.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're a fool,\" said Dr. Manelli sharply, as he turned away from the\nsleeping figure on the bed to face the older man. \"Of all the ridiculous\nthings, to let him connect you with this!\" The young doctor turned\nabruptly and sank down in a chair, glowering at Dr. Webber. \"You haven't\ngotten to first base yet, but you've just given Scott enough evidence\nto free himself from integrator control altogether, if he gives it any\nthought. But I suppose you realize that.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Dr. Webber retorted. \"He had enough information to do that\nwhen we first started. I'm no more worried now than I was then. I'm sure\nhe doesn't know enough about the psycho-integrator to be able\nvoluntarily to control the patient-operator relationship to any degree.\nOh, no, he's safe enough. But you've missed the whole point of that\nlittle interview.\" Dr. Webber grinned at Manelli.\n\n\"I'm afraid I have. It looked to me like useless bravado.\"\n\n\"The persecution, man, the _persecution_! He's shifted his sights!\nBefore that interview, the _not-men_ were torturing him, remember?\nBecause they were afraid he would report his findings to me, of course.\nBut now it's _I_ that's against him.\" The grin widened. \"You see where\nthat leads?\"\n\n\"You're talking almost as though you believed this story about a\ndifferent sort of people among us.\"\n\nDr. Webber shrugged. \"Perhaps I do.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now, George.\"\n\nDr. Webber's eyebrows went up and the grin disappeared from his face.\n\n\"Harry Scott believes it, Frank. We mustn't forget that, or miss its\nsignificance. Before Harry started this investigation of his, he\nwouldn't have paid any attention to such nonsense. But he believes it\nnow.\"\n\n\"But Harry Scott is insane. You said it yourself.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Dr. Webber. \"Insane. Just like the others who started to\nget somewhere along those lines of investigation. Try to analyze the\ngrowing incidence of insanity in the population and you yourself go\ninsane. You've got to be crazy to be a psychiatrist. It's an old joke,\nbut it isn't very funny any more. And it's too much for coincidence.\n\n\"And then consider the nature of the insanity--a full-blown\nparanoia--oh, it's amazing. A cunning organization of men who are\n_not_-men, a regular fairy story, all straight from Harry Scott's agile\nyoung mind. But now it's _we_ who are persecuting him, _and he still\nbelieves his fairy tale_.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\nDr. Webber's eyes flashed angrily. \"It's too neat, Frank. It's clever,\nand it's powerful, whatever we've run up against. But I think we've got\nan ace in the hole. We have Harry Scott.\"\n\n\"And you really think he'll lead us somewhere?\"\n\nDr. Webber laughed. \"That door I spoke of that Harry peeked through, I\nthink he'll go back to it again. I think he's started to open that door\nalready. And this time I'm going to follow him through.\"\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIt seemed incredible, yet Harry Scott knew he had not been mistaken. It\nhad been Dr. Webber's face he had seen, a face no one could forget, an\nunmistakable face. And that meant that it had been Dr. Webber who had\nbeen persecuting him.\n\nBut why? He had been going to report to Webber when he had run into that\ngolden field in the rooming-house hallway. And suddenly things had\nchanged.\n\nHarry felt a chill reaching to his fingers and toes. Yes, something had\nchanged, all right. The attack on him had suddenly become butcherous,\ncruel, sneaking into his mind somehow to use his most dreaded nightmares\nagainst him. There was no telling what new horrors might be waiting for\nhim. But he knew that he would lose his mind unless he could find an\nescape.\n\nHe was on his feet, his heart pounding. He had to get out of here,\nwherever he was. He had to get back to town, back to the city, back to\nwhere people were. If he could find a place to hide, a place where he\ncould rest, he could try to think his way out of this ridiculous maze,\nor at least try to understand it.\n\nHe wrenched at the door to the passageway, started through, and smashed\nface-up against a solid brick wall.\n\nHe cried out and jumped back from the wall. Blood trickled from his\nnose. The door was _walled up_, the mortar dry and hard.\n\nFrantically, he glanced around the room. There were no other doors, only\nthe row of tiny windows around the ceiling of the room, pale, ghostly\nsquares of light.\n\nHe pulled the chair over to the windows, peered out through the\ncobwebbed openings to the corridor beyond.\n\nIt was not the same hallway as before, but an old, dirty building\ncorridor, incredibly aged, with bricks sagging away from the walls. At\nthe end he could see stairs, and even the faintest hint of sunlight\ncoming from above.\n\nWildly, he tore at the masonry of the window, chipping away at the soggy\nmortar with his fingers until he could squeeze through the opening. He\nfell to the floor of the corridor outside.\n\nIt was much colder and the silence was no longer so intense. He seemed\nto feel, rather than hear, the surging power, the rumble of many\nmachines, the little, almost palpable vibrations from far above him.\n\nHe started in a dead run down the musty corridor to the stairs and began\nto climb them, almost stumbling over himself in his eagerness.\n\nAfter several flights, the brick walls gave way to cleaner plastic, and\nsuddenly a brightly lighted corridor stretched before him.\n\nPanting from the climb, Harry ran down the corridor to the end, wrenched\nopen a door, and looked out anxiously.\n\nHe was almost stunned by the bright light. At first he couldn't orient\nhimself as he stared down at the metal ramp, the moving strips of\nglowing metal carrying the throngs of people, sliding along the\nthoroughfare before him, unaware of him watching, unaware of any change\nfrom the usual. The towering buildings before him rose to unbelievable\nheights, bathed in ever-changing rainbow colors, and he felt his pulse\nthumping in his temples as he gaped.\n\nHe was in the New City, of that there was no doubt. This was the part of\nthe great metropolis which had been built again since the devastating\nwar that had nearly wiped the city from the Earth a decade before. These\nwere the moving streets, the beautiful residential apartments, following\nthe modern neo-functional patterns and participational design which had\ncompletely altered the pattern of city living. The Old City still\nremained, of course--the slums, the tenements, the skid-rows of the\nmetropolis--but this was the teeming heart of the city, a new home for\nmen to live in.\n\nAnd this was the stronghold where the not-men could be found, too. The\nthought cut through Harry's mind, sending a tremor up his spine. He had\nfound them here; he had uncovered his first clues here, and discovered\nthem; and even now his mind was filled with the horrible, paralyzing\nfear he had felt that first night when he had made the discovery. Yet he\nknew now that he dared not go back where he had come from.\n\nAt least he could understand why the not-men might have feared and\npersecuted him, but he could not understand the horrible assault that\nDr. Webber had unleashed. And somehow he found Dr. Webber's attack\ninfinitely more frightening.\n\nHe seemed to be safe here, though, at least for the moment.\n\nQuickly he moved down onto the nearest moving sidewalk heading toward\nthe living section of the New City. He knew where he could go there,\nwhere he could lock himself in, a place where he could think, possibly\nfind a way to fight off Dr. Webber's attack of nightmares.\n\nHe settled back on a bench on the moving sidewalk, watching the city\nslide past him for several minutes before he noticed the curious\nshadow-form which seemed to whisk out of his field of vision every time\nhe looked.\n\nThey were following him again! He looked around wildly as the sidewalk\nmoved swiftly through the cool evening air. Far above, he could see the\nshimmering, iridescent screen that still stood to protect the New City\nfrom the devastating virus attacks which might again strike down from\nthe skies without warning. Far ahead he could see the magnificent\n\"bridge\" formed by the sidewalk crossing over to the apartment area,\nwhere the thousands who worked in the New City were returning to their\nhomes.\n\nSomeone was still following him.\n\nPresently he heard the sound, so close to his ear he jumped, yet so\nsmall he could hardly identify it as a human voice. \"What was it you\nfound, Harry? What did you discover? Better tell, better tell.\"\n\nHe saw the rift in the moving sidewalk coming, far ahead, a great,\ngaping rent in the metal fabric of the swiftly moving escalator, as if a\nhuge blade were slicing it down the middle. Harry's hand went to his\nmouth, choking back a scream as the hole moved with incredible rapidity\ndown the center of the strip, swallowing up whole rows of the seats,\nmoving straight toward his own.\n\nHe glanced in fright over the side just as the sidewalk moved out onto\nthe \"bridge,\" and he gasped as he saw the towering canyons of buildings\nfall far below, saw the seats tumble end over end, heard the sounds of\nscreaming blend into the roar of air by his ears.\n\nThen the rift screamed by him with a demoniac whine and he sank back\nonto his bench, gasping as the two cloven halves of the strip clanged\nback together again.\n\nHe stared at the people around him on the strip and they stared back at\nhim, mildly, unperturbed, and returned to their evening papers as the\nstrip passed through the first local station on the other side of the\n\"bridge.\"\n\nHarry Scott sprang to his feet, moving swiftly across the slower strips\nfor the exit channels. He noted the station stop vaguely, but his only\nthought now was speed, desperate speed, fear-driven speed to put into\naction the plan that had suddenly burst in his mind.\n\nHe knew that he had reached his limit. He had come to a point beyond\nwhich he couldn't fight alone.\n\nSomehow, Webber had burrowed into his brain, laid his mind open to\nattacks of nightmare and madness that he could never hope to fight.\nFacing this alone, he would lose his mind. His only hope was to go for\nhelp to the ones he feared only slightly less, the ones who had minds\ncapable of fighting back for him.\n\nHe crossed under the moveable sidewalks and boarded the one going back\ninto the heart of the city. Somewhere there, he hoped, he would find the\nhelp he needed. Somewhere back in that city were men he had discovered\nwho were men and something more.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrank Manelli carefully took the blood pressure of the sleeping figure\non the bed; then turned to the other man. \"He'll be dead soon,\" he\nsnapped. \"Another few minutes now is all it'll take. Just a few more.\"\n\n\"Absurd. There's nothing in these stimuli that can kill him.\" George\nWebber sat tense, his eyes fixed on the pale fluctuating screen near the\nhead of the bed.\n\n\"His own mind can kill him! He's on the run now; you've broken him loose\nfrom his nice safe paranoia. His mind is retreating, running back to\nsome other delusions. It's escaping to the safety his fantasy people can\nafford him, these not-men he thinks about.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" agreed Dr. Webber, his eyes eager. \"Oh, he's on the run\nnow.\"\n\n\"But what will he do when he finds there aren't any 'not-men' to save\nhim? What will he do then?\"\n\nWebber looked up, frowning and grim. \"Then we'll know what he found\nbehind the dark door that he opened, that's what.\"\n\n\"No, you're wrong! He'll die. He'll find nothing and the shock will\nkill him. My God, Webber, you can't tamper with a man's mind like this\nand hope to save his life! You're obsessed; you've always been obsessed\nby this impossible search for something in our society, some\nundiscovered factor to account for the mental illness, the divergent\nminds, but you can't kill a man to trace it down!\"\n\n\"It's too neat,\" said Webber. \"He comes back to tell us the truth, and\nwe call him insane. We say he's paranoid, throw him in restraint, place\nhim in an asylum; and we never _know_ what he found. The truth is too\nincredible; when we hear it, it must be insanity we're hearing.\"\n\nThe big doctor laughed, jabbing his thumb at the screen. \"This isn't\ninsanity we're seeing. Oh, no, this is the answer we're following. I\nwon't stop now. I've waited too long for this show.\"\n\n\"Well, I say stop it while he's still alive.\"\n\nDr. Webber's eyes were deadly. \"Get out, Frank,\" he said softly. \"I'm\nnot stopping now.\"\n\nHis eyes returned to the screen, to the bobbing figure that the\npsycho-integrator traced on the fluorescent background. Twenty years of\nsearch had led him here, and now he knew the end was at hand.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nIt was a wild, nightmarish journey. At every step, Harry's senses\nbetrayed him: his wrist watch turned into a brilliant blue-green snake\nthat snapped at his wrist; the air was full of snarling creatures that\nthreatened him at every step. But he fought them off, knowing that they\nwould harm him far less than panic would. He had no idea where to hunt,\nnor whom to try to reach, but he knew they were there in the New City,\nand somehow he knew they would help him, if only he could find them.\n\nHe got off the moving strip as soon as the lights of the center of the\ncity were clear below, and stepped into the self-operated lift that\nsped down to ground level. From the elevator, he moved on to one of the\nlong, honeycombed concourses, filled with passing shoppers who stared at\nthe colorful, enticing three-dimensional displays.\n\nAt one of the intersections ahead, he spotted a visiphone station, and\ndropped onto the little seat before the screen. There had been a number,\nif only he could recall it. But as he started to dial, the silvery\nscreen shattered into a thousand sparkling glass chips, showering the\nfloor with crystal and sparks.\n\nHarry cursed, grabbed the hand instrument, and jangled frantically for\nthe operator. Before she could answer, the instrument grew warm in his\nhand, then hot and soft, like wax. Slowly, it melted and ran down his\narm.\n\nHe bolted out into the stream of people, trying desperately to draw some\ncomfort from the crowd around him.\n\nHe felt utterly alone; he _had_ to contact the not-men who were in the\ncity, warn them, before they spotted him, of the attack he carried with\nhim. If he were leading his pursuer, he could expect no mercy from the\nones whose help he sought. He knew the lengths to which they would go to\nremain undetected in the society around them. Yet he had to find them.\n\nIn the distance, he saw a figure waiting, back against one of the show\nwindows. Harry stopped short, ducked into a doorway, and peered out\nfearfully. Their eyes locked for an instant; then the figure moved on.\nHarry felt a jolt of horror surge through him. Dr. Webber hunting him in\nperson!\n\nHe ducked out of the doorway, turned and ran madly in the opposite\ndirection, searching for an up escalator he could catch. Behind him he\nheard shots, heard the angry whine of bullets past his ear.\n\nHe breathed in great, gasping sobs as he found an almost empty\nescalator, and bounded up it four steps at a time. Below, he could see\nWebber coming too, his broad shoulders forcing their way relentlessly\nthrough the mill of people.\n\nPanting, Harry reached the top, checked his location against a wall map,\nand started down the long ramp which led toward the building he had\ntried to call.\n\nAnother shot broke out behind him. The wall alongside powdered away,\nleaving a gaping hole. On impulse, he leaped into the hole, running\nthrough to the rear of the building as the weakened wall swayed and\ncrumbled into a heap of rubble just as Webber reached the place Harry\nhad entered.\n\nHarry breathed a sigh of relief and raced up the stairs of the building\nto reach a ramp on another level. He turned his eyes toward the tall\nbuilding at the end of the concourse. There he could hide and relax and\ntry, somehow, to make a contact.\n\nSomeone fell into step beside him and took his arm gently but firmly.\nHarry jerked away, turning terrified eyes to the one who had joined him.\n\n\"Quiet,\" said the man, steering him over toward the edge of the\nconcourse. \"Not a sound. You'll be all right.\"\n\nHarry felt a tremor pass through his mind, the barest touching of mental\nfingertips, a recognition that sent a surge of eager blood through his\nheart.\n\nHe stopped short, facing the man. \"I'm being followed,\" he gasped. \"You\ncan't take me anywhere you don't want Webber to follow, or you'll be in\nterrible danger.\"\n\nThe stranger shrugged and smiled briefly. \"You're not here. You're in a\npsycho-integrator. It can hurt you, if you let it. But it can't hurt\nme.\" He stepped up his pace slightly, and in a moment they turned\nabruptly into a darkened cul-de-sac.\n\nSuddenly, they were moving _through_ the wall of the building into the\nbrilliantly lit lobby of the tall building. Harry gasped, but the\nstranger led him without a sound toward the elevator, stepped aboard\nwith him, and sped upward, the silence broken only by the\nwhish-whish-whish of the passing floors. Finally they stepped out into a\nquiet corridor and down through a small office door.\n\nA man sat behind the desk in the office, his face quiet, his eyes very\nwide and dark. He hardly glanced at Harry, but turned his eyes to the\nother man.\n\n\"Set?\" he asked.\n\n\"Couldn't miss now.\"\n\nThe man nodded and looked at last at Harry. \"You're upset,\" he murmured.\n\"What's bothering you?\"\n\n\"Webber,\" said Harry hoarsely. \"He's following me here. He'll spot you.\nI tried to warn you before I came, but I couldn't.\"\n\nThe man at the desk smiled. \"Webber again, eh? Our old friend Webber.\nThat's all right. Webber's at the end of his tether. There's nothing he\ncan do to stop us. He's trying to attack with force, and he fails to\nrealize that time and thought are on our side. The time when force would\nhave succeeded against us is long past. But now there are many of us,\nalmost as many as not.\"\n\nHarry stared shrewdly at the man behind the desk. \"Then why are you so\nafraid of Webber?\" he asked.\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\n\"You know you are. Long ago you threatened me, if I reported to him. You\nwatched me, played with me. Why are you afraid of him?\"\n\nThe man sighed. \"Webber is premature. We are stalling for time, that's\nall. We wait. We have grown from so very few, back in the 1940s and 50s,\nbut the time for quiet usurpation of power has not quite arrived. But\nmen like Webber force our hand, discover us, try to expose us.\"\n\nHarry Scott's face was white, his hands shaking. \"And what do you do to\nthem?\"\n\n\"We--deal with them.\"\n\n\"And those like me?\"\n\nThe man smiled lopsidedly. \"Those like Paulus and Wineberg and the\nrest--they're happy, really, like little children. But one like you is\nso much more useful.\" He pointed almost apologetically to the small\nscreen on his desk.\n\nHarry looked at it, realization dawning. He watched the huge,\nbroad-shouldered figure moving down the hallway toward the door.\n\n\"Webber was dangerous to you?\"\n\n\"Unbelievably dangerous. So dangerous we would use any means to trap\nhim.\"\n\nSuddenly the door burst open and there stood Webber, a triumphant\nWebber, face flushed, eyes wide, as he stared at the man behind the\ndesk.\n\nThe man smiled back and said, \"Come on in, George. We've been waiting\nfor you.\"\n\nWebber stepped through the door. \"Manelli, you fool!\"\n\nThere was a blinding flash as he crossed the threshold. A faint crackle\nof sound reached Harry's ears; then the world blacked out....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt might have been minutes, or hours, or days. The man who had been\nbehind the desk was leaning over Harry, smiling down at him, gently\nbandaging the trephine wounds at his temples.\n\n\"Gently,\" he said, as Harry tried to sit up. \"Don't try to move. You've\nbeen through a rough time.\"\n\nHarry peered up at him. \"You're--not Dr. Webber.\"\n\n\"No. I'm Dr. Manelli. Dr. Webber's been called away--an accident. He'll\nbe some time recovering. I'll be taking care of you.\"\n\nVaguely, Harry was aware that something was peculiar, something not\nquite as it should be. The answer slowly dawned on him.\n\n\"The statistical analysis!\" he exclaimed. \"I was supposed to get some\ndata from Dr. Webber about an analysis, something about rising insanity\nrates.\"\n\nDr. Manelli looked blank. \"Insanity rates? You must be mistaken. You\nwere brought here for an immunity examination, nothing more. But you\ncan check with Dr. Webber, when he gets back.\"\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nGeorge Webber sat in the little room, trembling, listening, his eyes\nwide in the thick, misty darkness. He knew it would be a matter of time\nnow. He couldn't run much farther. He hadn't seen them, true. Oh, they\nhad been very clever, but they thought they were dealing with a fool,\nand they weren't. He _knew_ they'd been following him; he'd known it for\na long time now.\n\nIt was just as he had been telling the man downstairs the night before:\nthey were everywhere--your neighbor upstairs, the butcher on the corner,\nyour own son or daughter, maybe even the man you were talking\nto--_everywhere_!\n\nAnd of course he had to warn as many people as he possibly could before\n_they_ caught him, throttled him off, as they had threatened to if he\ntalked to anyone.\n\nIf only the people would _listen_ to him when he told them how cleverly\nit was all planned, how it would only be a matter of months, maybe only\nweeks or days before the change would happen, and the world would be\nquietly, silently taken over by the _other_ people, the different people\nwho could walk through walls and think in impossibly complex channels.\nAnd no one would know the difference, because business would go on as\nusual.\n\nHe shivered, sinking down lower on the bed. If only people would listen\nto him--\n\nIt wouldn't be long now. He had heard the stealthy footsteps on the\nlanding below his room some time ago. This was the night they had chosen\nto make good their threats, to choke off his dangerous voice once and\nfor all. There were footsteps on the stairs now, growing louder.\n\nWildly he glanced around the room as the steps moved down the hall\ntoward his door. He rushed to the window, threw up the sash and\nscreamed hoarsely to the silent street below: \"Look out! They're here,\nall around us! They're planning to take over! Look out! Look out!\"\n\nThe door burst open and there were two men moving toward him,\ngrim-faced, dressed in white; tall, strong men with sad faces and strong\narms.\n\nOne was saying, \"Better come quietly, mister. No need to wake up the\nwhole town.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Dark Door, by Alan Edward Nourse\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DARK DOOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22869.txt or 22869.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/8/6/22869/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
