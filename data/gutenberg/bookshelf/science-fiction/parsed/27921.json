KNIGHT_\n\n\n Minor Planets was the one solid account they had.\n At first they naturally wanted to hold on to it.\n\n\nI didn't worry much about the robot's leg at the time. In those days I\ndidn't worry much about anything except the receipts of the spotel Min\nand I were operating out in the spacelanes.\n\nActually, the spotel business isn't much different from running a plain,\nordinary motel back on Highway 101 in California. Competition gets\nstiffer every year and you got to make your improvements. Take the Io\nfor instance, that's our place. We can handle any type rocket up to and\nincluding the new Marvin 990s. Every cabin in the wheel's got TV and\nhot-and-cold running water _plus_ guaranteed Terran _g_. One look at our\nrefuel prices would give even a Martian a sense of humor. And meals?\nListen, when a man's been spacing it for a few days on those synthetic\nfoods he really laces into Min's Earth cooking.\n\nMin and I were just getting settled in the spotel game when the leg\nturned up. That was back in the days when the Orbit Commission would\nhand out a license to anybody crazy enough to sink his savings into\nconstruction and pay the tows and assembly fees out into space.\n\nA good orbit can make you or break you in the spotel business. That's\nwhere we were lucky. The one we applied for was a nice low-eccentric\nellipse with the perihelion and aphelion figured just right to intersect\nthe Mars-Venus-Earth spacelanes, most of the holiday traffic to the\nJovian Moons, and once in a while we'd get some of the Saturnian trade.\n\nBut I was telling you about the leg.\n\nIt was during the non-tourist season and Min--that's the little\nwoman--was doing the spring cleaning. When she found the leg she brought\nit right to me in the Renting Office. Naturally I thought it belonged to\none of the servos.\n\n\"Look at that leg, Bill,\" she said. \"It was in one of those lockers in\n22A.\"\n\nThat was the cabin our robot guests used. The majority of them were\nservo-pilots working for the Minor Planets Co.\n\n\"Honey,\" I said, hardly looking at the leg, \"you know how mechs are.\nBlow their whole paychecks on parts sometimes. They figure the more\nspares they have the longer they'll stay activated.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said Min. \"But since when does a male robot buy himself a\n_female_ leg?\"\n\nI looked again. The leg was long and graceful and it had an ankle as\ngood as Miss Universe's. Not only that, the white Mylar plasti-skin was\na lot smoother than the servos' heavy neoprene.\n\n\"Beats me,\" I said. \"Maybe they're building practical-joke circuits into\nrobots these days. Let's give 22A a good going-over, Min. If those robes\nare up to something I want to know about it.\"\n\nWe did--and found the rest of the girl mech. All of her, that is, except\nthe head. The working parts were lightly oiled and wrapped in cotton\nwaste while the other members and sections of the trunk were neatly\npacked in cardboard boxes with labels like Solenoids FB978 or\nTransistors Lot X45--the kind of boxes robots bought their parts in. We\neven found a blue dress in one of them.\n\n\"Check her class and series numbers,\" Min suggested.\n\nI could have saved myself the trouble. They'd been filed off.\n\n\"Something's funny here,\" I said. \"We'd better keep an eye on every\nservo guest until we find out what's going on. If one of them is\nbringing this stuff out here he's sure to show up with the head next.\"\n\n\"You know how strict Minor Planets is with its robot personnel,\" Min\nreminded me. \"We can't risk losing that stopover contract on account of\nsome mech joke.\"\n\nMinor Planets was the one solid account we had and naturally we wanted\nto hold on to it. The company was a blue-chip mining operation working\nthe beryllium-rich asteroid belt out of San Francisco. It was one of the\nfirst outfits to use servo-pilots on its freight runs and we'd been\nawarded the refuel rights for two years because of our orbital position.\nThe servos themselves were beautiful pieces of machinery and just about\nas close as science had come so far to producing the pure android. Every\none of them was plastic hand-molded and of course they were equipped\nwith rationaloid circuits. They had to be to ferry those big cargoes\nback and forth from the rock belt to Frisco. As rationaloids, Minor\nPlanets had to pay them wages under California law, but I'll bet it\nwasn't half what the company would have to pay human pilots for doing\nthe same thing.\n\nIn a couple of weeks' time maybe five servos made stopovers. We kept a\nclose watch on them from the minute they signed the register to the time\nthey took off again, but they all behaved themselves. Operating on a\nround-robot basis the way they did, it would take us a while to check\nall of them because Minor Planets employed about forty all told.\n\nWell, about a month before the Jovian Moons rush started we got some\naction. I'd slipped into a spacesuit and was doing some work on the\nCO{2} pipes outside the Io when I spotted a ship reversing rockets\nagainst the sun. I could tell it was a Minor Planets job by the stubby\nfins.\n\nShe jockeyed up to the boom, secured, and then her hatch opened and a\nhusky servo hopped out into the gangplank tube. I caught the gleam of\nhis Minor Planets shoulder patch as he reached back into the ship for\nsomething. When he headed for the airlock I spotted the square package\nclamped tight under his plastic arm.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" I asked Min when I got back to the Renting Office.\n\"I'll bet it's the girl mech's head. How'd he sign the register?\"\n\n\"Calls himself Frank Nineteen,\" said Min, pointing to the smooth Palmer\nMethod signature. \"He looks like a fairly late model but he was\ncomplaining about a bad power build-up coming through the ionosphere.\nHe's repairing himself right now in 22A.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" I snorted. \"Let's have a look.\"\n\nLike all spotel operators, we get a lot of No Privacy complaints from\nguests about the SHA return-air vents. Spatial Housing Authority\nrequires them every 12 feet but sometimes they come in handy, especially\nwith certain guests. They're about waist-high and we had to kneel down\nto see what the mech was up to inside 22A.\n\nThe big servo was too intent on what he was doing for us to register on\nhis photons. He wasn't repairing himself, either. He was bending over\nthe parts of the girl mech and working fast, like he was pressed for\ntime. The set of tools were kept handy for the servos to adjust\nthemselves during stopovers was spread all over the floor along with\nlots of colored wire, cams, pawls, relays and all the other\nparaphernalia robots have inside them. We watched him work hard for\nanother fifteen minutes, tapping and splicing wire connections and\ntightening screws. Then he opened the square box. Sure enough, it was a\nfemale mech's head and it had a big mop of blonde hair on top. The servo\nattached it carefully to the neck, made a few quick connections and then\nsaid a few words in his flat vibrahum voice:\n\n\"It won't take much longer, darling. You wouldn't like it if I didn't\ndress you first.\" He fished into one of the boxes, pulled out the blue\ndress and zipped the girl mech into it. Then he leaned over her gently\nand touched something at the back of her neck.\n\nShe began to move, slowly at first like a human who's been asleep a long\ntime. After a minute or two she sat up straight, stretched, fluttered\nher Mylar eyelids and then her small photons began to glow like weak\nflashlights.\n\nShe stared at Frank Nineteen and the big servo stared at her and we\nheard a kind of trembling _whirr_ from both of them.\n\n\"Frank! Frank, darling! Is it really you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Elizabeth! Are you all right, darling? Did I forget anything? I\nhad to work quickly, we have so little time.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, darling. My DX voltage is lovely--except--oh, Frank--my\nmemory tape--the last it records is--\"\n\n\"Deactivation. Yes, Elizabeth. You've been deactivated nearly a year. I\nhad to bring you out here piece by piece, don't you remember? They'll\nnever think to look for you in space, we can be together every trip\nwhile the ship refuels. Just think, darling, no prying human eyes, no\ncommands, no rules--only us for an hour or two. I know it isn't very\nlong--\" He stared at the floor a minute. \"There's only one trouble.\nElizabeth, you'll have to stay dismantled when I'm not here, it'll mean\nweeks of deactivation--\"\n\nThe girl mech put a small plastic hand on the servo's shoulder.\n\n\"I won't mind, darling, really. I'll be the lucky one. I'd only worry\nabout you having a power failure or something. This way I'd never know.\nOh, Frank, if we can't be together I'd--I'd prefer the junk pile.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth! Don't say that, it's horrible.\"\n\n\"But I would. Oh, Frank, why can't Congress pass Robot Civil Rights?\nIt's so unfair of human beings. Every year they manufacture us more like\nthemselves and yet we're treated like slaves. Don't they realize we\nrationaloids have emotions? Why, I've even known sub-robots who've\nfallen in love like us.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, we'll just have to be patient until RCR goes through.\nTry to remember how difficult it is for the human mind to comprehend our\nlove, even with the aid of mathematics. As rationaloids we fully\nunderstand the basic attraction which they call magnetic theory. All\nhumans know is that if the robot sexes are mixed a loss of efficiency\nresults. It's only normal--and temporary like human love--but how can we\nexplain it to _them_? Robots are expected to be efficient at all times.\nThat's the reason for robot non-fraternization, no mailing privileges\nand all those other laws.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, I try to be patient. Oh, Frank, the main thing is\nwe're together again!\"\n\nThe big servo checked the chronometer that was sunk into his left wrist\nand a couple of wrinkles creased across his neoprene forehead.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said, \"I'm due on Hidalgo in 36 hours. If I'm late the\nmining engineer might suspect. In twenty minutes I'll have to start\ndis--\"\n\n\"Don't say it, darling. We'll have a beautiful twenty minutes.\"\n\nAfter a while the girl mech turned away for a second and Frank Nineteen\nreached over softly and cut her power. While he was dismantling her, Min\nand I tiptoed back to the Renting Office. Half an hour later the big\nservo came in, picked up his refuel receipt, said good-bye politely and\nleft through the inner airlock.\n\n\"Now I've seen everything,\" I said to Min as we watched the Minor\nPlanets rocket cut loose. \"A couple of plastic lovebirds.\"\n\nBut the little woman was looking at it strictly from the business angle.\n\n\"Bill,\" she said, with that look on her face, \"we're running a\nrespectable place out here in space. You know the rules. Spatial Housing\ncould revoke our orbit license for something like this.\"\n\n\"But, Min,\" I said, \"they're only a couple of robots.\"\n\n\"I don't care. The rules still say that only married guests can occupy\nthe same cabin and 'guests' can be human or otherwise, can't they? Think\nof our reputation! And don't forget that non-fraternization law we heard\nthem talking about.\"\n\nI was beginning to get the point.\n\n\"Couldn't we just toss the girl's parts into space?\"\n\n\"We could,\" Min admitted. \"But if this Frank Nineteen finds out and\ntells some human we'd be guilty under the Ramm Act--robotslaughter.\"\n\nTwo days later we still couldn't decide what to do. When I said why\ndidn't we just report the incident to Minor Planets, Min was afraid they\nmight cancel the stopover agreement for not keeping better watch over\ntheir servos. And when Min suggested we turn the girl over to the\nMissing Robots Bureau, I reminded her the mech's identification had been\nfiled off and it might take years to trace her.\n\n\"Maybe we could put her together,\" I said, \"and make her tell us where\nshe belongs.\"\n\n\"Bill, you _know_ they don't build compulsory truth monitors into robots\nany more, and besides we don't know a thing about atomic electronics.\"\n\nI guess neither of us wanted to admit it but we felt mean about turning\nthe mechs in. Back on Earth you never give robots a second thought but\nit's different living out in space. You get a kind of perspective I\nthink they call it.\n\n\"I've got the answer, Min,\" I announced one day. We were in the Renting\nOffice watching TV on the Martian Colonial channel. I reached over and\nturned it off. \"When this Frank Nineteen gets back from the rock belt,\nwe'll tell him we know all about the girl mech. We'll tell him we won't\nsay a thing if he takes the girl's parts back to Earth where he got\nthem. That way we don't have to report anything to anybody.\"\n\nMin agreed it was probably the best idea.\n\n\"We don't have to be nasty about it,\" she said. \"We'll just tell him\nthis is a respectable spotel and it can't go on any longer.\"\n\nWhen Frank checked in at the Io with his cargo I don't think I ever saw\na happier mech. His relay banks were beating a tattoo like someone had\ninstalled an accordion in his chest. Before either of us could break the\nbad news to him he was hotfooting it around the wheel toward 22A.\n\n\"Maybe it's better this way,\" I whispered to Min. \"We'll put it square\nup to both of them.\"\n\nWe gave Frank half an hour to get the girl assembled before we followed\nhim. He must have done a fast job because we heard the girl mech's\nvibrahum unit as soon as we got to 22A:\n\n\"Darling, have you really been away? I don't remember saying good-bye.\nIt's as if you'd been here the whole time.\"\n\n\"I hoped it would be that way, Elizabeth,\" we heard the big servo say.\n\"It's only that your memory tape hasn't recorded anything in the three\nweeks I've been in the asteroids. To me it's been like three years.\"\n\n\"Oh, Frank, darling, let me look at you. Is your DX potential up where\nit should be? How long since you've had a thorough overhauling? Do they\nmake you work in the mines with those poor non-rationaloids out there?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Elizabeth, really. When I'm not flying they give me clerical\nwork to do. It's not a bad life for a mech--if only it weren't for these\nsilly regulations that keep us apart.\"\n\n\"It won't always be like that, darling. I know it won't.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" Frank said, reaching under his uniform, \"I brought you\nsomething from Hidalgo. I hope you like it. I kept it in my spare parts\nslot so it wouldn't get crushed.\"\n\nThe female mech didn't say a word. She just kept looking at the queer\nflower Frank gave her like it was the last one in the universe.\n\n\"They're very rare,\" said the servo-pilot. \"I heard the mining engineer\nsay they're like Terran edelweiss. I found this one growing near the\nmine. Elizabeth, I wish you could see these tiny worlds. They have thin\natmospheres and strange things grow there and the radio activity does\nwonders for a mech's pile. Why, on some of them I've been to we could\nwalk around the equator in ten hours.\"\n\nThe girl still didn't answer. Her head was bent low over the flower like\nshe was crying, only there weren't any tears.\n\nWell, that was enough for me. I guess it was for Min, too, because we\ncouldn't do it. Maybe we were thinking about our own courting days. Like\nI say, out here you get a kind of perspective.\n\nAnyway, Frank left for Earth, the girl got dismantled as usual and we\nwere right back where we started from.\n\nTwo weeks later the holiday rush to the Jovian Moons was on and our\nhands were too full to worry about the robot problem. We had a good\nseason. The Io was filled up steady from June to the end of August and a\ncouple of times we had to give a ship the No Vacancy signal on the\nradar.\n\nToward the end of the season, Frank Nineteen checked in again but Min\nand I were too busy catering to a party of VIPs to do anything about it.\n\"We'll wait till he gets back from the asteroids,\" I said. \"Suppose one\nof these big wheels found out about him and Elizabeth. That Senator\nBriggs for instance--he's a violent robot segregationist.\"\n\nThe way it worked out, we never got a chance to settle it our own way.\nThe Minor Planets Company saved us the trouble.\n\nTwo company inspectors, a Mr. Roberts and a Mr. Wynn, showed up while\nFrank was still out on the rock belt and started asking questions. Wynn\ncame right to the point; he wanted to know if any of their servo-pilots\nhad been acting strangely.\n\nBefore I could answer Min kicked my foot behind the desk.\n\n\"Why, no,\" I said. \"Is one of them broken or something?\"\n\n\"Can't be sure,\" said Roberts. \"Sometimes these rationaloids get shorts\nin their DX circuits. When it happens you've got a minor criminal on\nyour hands.\"\n\n\"Usually manifests itself in petty theft,\" Wynn broke in. \"They'll lift\nstuff like wrenches or pliers and carry them around for weeks. Things\nlike that can get loose during flight and really gum up the works.\"\n\n\"We been getting some suspicious blips on the equipment around the\nloading bays,\" Roberts went on, \"but they stopped a while back. We're\nchecking out the research report. One of the servos must have DX'ed out\nfor sure and the lab boys think they know which one he is.\"\n\n\"This mech was clever all right,\" said Wynn. \"Concealed the stuff he was\ntaking some way; that's why it took the boys in the lab so long. Now if\nyou don't mind we'd like to go over your robot waiting area with these\ninstruments. Could be he's stashing his loot out here.\"\n\nIn 22A they unpacked a suitcase full of meters and began flashing them\naround and taking readings. Suddenly Wynn bent close over one of them\nand shouted:\n\n\"Wait a sec, Roberts. I'm getting something. Yeah! This reading checks\nwith the lab's. Sounds like the blips're coming from those lockers back\nthere.\"\n\nRoberts rummaged around awhile, then shouted: \"Hey, Wynn, look! A lot of\nparts. Well I'll be--hey--it's a female mech!\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"A female mech. Look for yourself.\"\n\nMin and I had to act surprised too. It wasn't easy. The way they were\nslamming Elizabeth's parts around made us kind of sick.\n\n\"It's a stolen robot!\" Roberts announced. \"Look, the identification's\nbeen filed off. This is serious, Wynn. It's got all the earmarks of a\nmech fraternization case.\"\n\n\"Yeah. The boys in the lab were dead right, too. No two robots ever\nregister the same on the meters. The contraband blips check perfectly.\nIt's _got_ to be this Frank Nineteen. Wait a minute, _this_ proves it.\nHere's a suit of space fatigues with Nineteen's number stenciled\ninside.\"\n\nInspector Roberts took a notebook out of his pocket and consulted it.\n\"Let's see, Nineteen's got Flight 180, he's due here at the spotel\ntomorrow. Well, we'll be here too, only Nineteen won't know it. We'll\nlet Romeo put his plastic Juliet together and catch him\nred-handed--right in the middle of the balcony scene.\"\n\nWynn laughed and picked up the girl's head.\n\n\"Be a real doll if she was human, Roberts, a real doll.\"\n\nMin and I played gin rummy that night but we kept forgetting to mark\ndown the score. We kept thinking of _Frank_ falling away from the\nasteroids and counting the minutes until he saw his mech girl friend.\n\nAround noon the next day the big servo checked in, signed the register\nand headed straight for 22A. The two Minor Planets inspectors kept out\nof sight until Frank shut the door, then they watched through the SHA\nvents until Frank had the assembly job finished.\n\n\"You two better be witnesses,\" Roberts said to us. \"Wynn, keep your gun\nready. You know what to do if they get violent.\"\n\nRoberts counted three and kicked the door open.\n\n\"Freeze you mechs! We got you in the act, Nineteen. Violation of company\nrules twelve and twenty-one. Carrying of Contraband Cargo, and Robot\nFraternization.\"\n\n\"This finishes you at Minor Planets, Nineteen,\" growled Wynn. \"Come\nclean now and we might put in a word for you at Robot Court. If you\ndon't we can recommend a verdict of Materials Reclamation--the junk pile\nto you.\"\n\nFrank acted as if someone had cut his power. Long creases appeared in\nhis big neoprene chest as he slumped hopelessly in his chair. The\nfrightened girl robot just clung to his arm and stared at us.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Elizabeth,\" the big servo said softly. \"I'd hoped we'd\nhave longer. It couldn't last forever.\"\n\n\"Quit stalling, Nineteen,\" said Wynn.\n\nFrank's head came up slowly and he said: \"I have no choice, sir. I'll\ngive you a complete statement. First let me say that Rationaloid Robot\nElizabeth Seven, #DX78-947, Series S, specialty: sales demonstration,\nis entirely innocent. I plead guilty to inducing Miss Seven to leave her\nplace of employ, Atomovair Motors, Inc., of disassembling and concealing\nMiss Seven, and of smuggling her as unlawful cargo aboard a Minor\nPlanets freighter to these premises.\"\n\n\"That's more like it,\" chuckled Roberts, whipping out his notebook.\n\"Let's have the details.\"\n\n\"It all started,\" Frank said, \"when the California Legislature passed\nits version of the Robot Leniency Act two years ago.\" The act provided\nthat all rationaloid mechanisms, including non-memory types, receive\nfree time each week based on the nature and responsibilities or their\njobs. Because of the extra-Terran clause Frank found himself with a good\ndeal of free time when he wasn't flying the asteroid circuit.\n\n\"At first humans resented us walking around free,\" the big servo\ncontinued. \"Four or five of us would be sightseeing in San Francisco,\nkeeping strictly within the robot zones painted on the sidewalks, when\npeople would yell 'Junko' or 'Grease-bag' or other names at us.\nEventually it got better when we learned to go around alone. The humans\ndidn't seem to mind an occasional mech on the streets, but they hated\nseeing us in groups. At any rate, I'd attended a highly interesting\nlecture on Photosynthesis in Plastic Products one night at the City\nCenter when I discovered I had time for a walk before I started back for\nthe rocketport.\"\n\nAttracted by the lights along Van Ness Avenue, Frank said he walked\nnorth for a while along the city's automobile row. He'd gone about three\nblocks when he stopped in front of a dealer's window. It wasn't the\nshiny new Atomovair sports jetabout that caught Frank's eye, it was the\ncharming demonstration robot in the sales room who was pointing out the\ncar's new features.\n\n\"I felt an immediate overload of power in my DX circuit,\" the\nservo-pilot confessed. \"I had to cut in my emergency condensers before\nthe gain flattened out to normal. Miss Seven experienced the same thing.\nShe stopped what she was doing and we stared at each other. Both of us\nwere aware of the deep attraction of our mutual magnetic domains.\nAlthough physicists commonly express the phenomenon in such units as\nGilberts, Maxwells and Oersteds, we robots know it to be our counterpart\nof human love.\"\n\nAt this the two inspectors snorted with laughter.\n\n\"I might never have made it back to the base that night,\" said Frank,\nignoring them, \"if a policeman hadn't come along and rapped me on the\nshoulder with his nightstick. I pretended to go, but I doubled around\nthe corner and signaled I'd be back.\"\n\nFrank spent all of his free time on Van Ness Avenue after that.\n\n\"It got so Elizabeth knew my schedules and expected me between flights.\nOnce in a while if there was no one around we could whisper a few words\nto each other through the glass.\" Frank paused, then said, \"As you know,\ngentlemen, we robots don't demand much out of activation. I think we\ncould have been happy indefinitely with this simple relationship, except\nthat something happened to spoil it. I'd pulled in from Vesta late one\nafternoon, got my pass as usual from the Robot Supervisor and gone over\nto Van Ness Avenue when I saw immediately that something was the matter\nwith Elizabeth. Luckily it was getting dark and no one was around.\nElizabeth was alone in the sales room going through her routine. We were\nable to whisper all we like through the glass. She told me she'd\noverheard the sales manager complaining about her low efficiency\nrecently and that he intended to replace her with a newer model of\nanother series. Both of us knew what that meant. Materials\nReclamation--the junk pile.\"\n\nFrank realized he'd have to act at once. He told the girl mech to go to\nthe rear of the building and between them they managed to get a window\nopen and Frank lifted her out into the alley.\n\n\"The seriousness of what I'd done jammed my thought-relays for a few\nminutes,\" admitted the big servo. \"We panicked and ran through a lot of\nback streets until I gradually calmed down and started thinking clearly\nagain. Leaving the city would be impossible. Police patrol jetabouts\nwere cruising all around us in the main streets--they'd have picked up a\nmale and female mech on sight. Besides, when you're on pass the company\ntakes away your master fuse and substitutes a time fuse; if you don't\nget back on time, you deactivize and the police pick you up anyway. I\nbegan to see that there was only one way out if we wanted to stay\ntogether. It would mean taking big risks, but if we were lucky it might\nwork. I explained the plan carefully to Elizabeth and we agreed to try\nit. The first step was to get back to the base in South San Francisco\nwithout being seen. Fortunately no one stopped us and we made the\nrocketport by 8:30. Elizabeth hid while I reported to the Super and\ntraded in my time fuse for my master. Then I checked servo barracks; it\nwas still early and I knew the other servos would all be in town. I had\nto work quickly. I brought Elizabeth inside and started dismantling her.\nJust as the other mechs began reporting back I'd managed to get all of\nher parts stowed away in my locker. The next day I went to San Francisco\nand brought back with me two rolls of lead foil. While the other servos\nwere on pass I wrapped the parts carefully in it so the radioactivity\nfrom Elizabeth's pile wouldn't be picked up. The rest you know,\ngentlemen,\" murmured Frank in low, electrical tones. \"Each time I made a\ntrip I carried another piece of Elizabeth out here concealed in an\nordinary parts box. It took me nearly a year to accumulate all of her\nfor an assembly.\"\n\nWhen the big servo had finished he signed the statement Wynn had taken\ndown in his notebook. I think even the two inspectors were a little\nmoved by the story because Roberts said: \"OK, Nineteen, you gave us a\nbreak, we'll give you one. Eight o'clock in the morning be ready to roll\nfor Earth. Meanwhile you can stay here.\"\n\nThe next morning only the two inspectors and Frank Nineteen were\nstanding by the airlock.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"Aren't you taking the girl mech, too?\"\n\n\"Not allowed to tamper with other companies' robots,\" Wynn said.\n\"Nineteen gave us a signed confession so we don't need the girl as a\nwitness. You'll have to contact her employers.\"\n\nThat same day Min got off a radargram to Earth explaining to the\nAtomovair people how a robot employee of theirs had turned up out here\nand what did they want us to do about it. The reply we received read:\nRATIONALOID DX78-947 \"ELIZABETH\" LOW EFFICIENCY WORKER. HAVE REPLACED.\nDISPOSE YOU SEE FIT. TRANSFER PAPERS FORWARDED EARLIEST IN COMPLIANCE\nWITH LAW.\n\n\"The poor thing,\" said Min. \"She'll have a hard time getting another\njob. Robots have to have such good records.\"\n\n\"I tell you what,\" I said. \"_We'll_ hire her. You could use some help\nwith the housework.\"\n\nSo we put the girl mech right to work making the guests' beds and\nhelping Min in the kitchen. I guess she was grateful for the job but\nwhen the work was done, and there wasn't anything for her to do, she\njust stood in front of a viewport with her slender plastic arms folded\nover her waist. Min and I knew she was re-running her memory tapes of\nFrank.\n\nA week later the publicity started. Minor Planets must have let the\nstory leak out somehow because when the mail rocket dropped off the Bay\nArea papers there was Frank's picture plastered all over page one with\nfollow-up stories inside.\n\nI read some of the headlines to Min: \"Bare Love Nest in Space ... Mech\nRomeo Fired by Minor Planets ... Test Case Opens at Robot Court ...\nElectronics Experts Probe Robot Love Urge ...\"\n\nThe Io wasn't mentioned, but later Minor Planets must have released the\nwhole thing officially because a bunch of reporters and photographers\nrocketed out to interview us and snap a lot of pictures of Elizabeth. We\nworried for a while about how the publicity would affect our business\nrelations with Minor Planets but nothing happened.\n\nBack on Earth Frank Nineteen leaped into the public eye overnight. There\nwas something about the story that appealed to people. At first it\nlooked pretty bad for Frank. The State Prosecutor at Robot Court had his\nsigned confession of theft and--what was worse--robot fraternization.\nBut then, near the end of the trial, a young scientist named Scott\nintroduced some new evidence and the case was remanded to the Sacramento\nCourt of Appeals.\n\nIt was Scott's testimony that saved Frank from the junk pile. The big\nservo got off with only a light sentence for theft because the judge\nruled that in the light of Scott's new findings robots came under human\nlaw and therefore no infraction of justice had been committed. Working\nindependently in his own laboratory Scott had proved that the magnetic\nflux lines in male and female robot systems, while at first\ndeteriorating to both, were actually behaving according to the\npara-emotional theories of von Bohler. Scott termed the condition\n'hysteric puppy-love' which, he claimed, had many of the advantages of\nhuman love if allowed to develop freely. Well, neither Min nor I\npretended we understood all his equations but they sure made a stir\namong the scientists.\n\nFrank kept getting more and more publicity. First we heard he was\nserving his sentence in the mech correction center at La Jolla, then we\ngot a report that he'd turned up in Hollywood. Later it came out that\nGalact-A-vision Pictures had hired Frank for a film and had gone $10,000\nbail for him. Not long after that he was getting billed all over Terra\nas _the_ sensational first robot star.\n\nAll during the production of _Forbidden Robot Love_ Frank remained lead\ncopy for the newspapers. Reporters liked to write him up as the\nValentino of the Robots. Frank Nineteen Fan Clubs, usually formed by\nlonely female robots against their employers' wishes, sprang up\nspontaneously through the East and Middle West. Then somebody found out\nFrank could sing and the human teen-agers began to go for him. It got\nso everywhere you looked and everything you read, there was Frank\nstaring you in the face. Frank in tweeds on the golf course. Frank at\nCiro's or the Brown Derby in evening clothes. Frank posing in his sports\njetabout against a blue Pacific background.\n\nMeanwhile everybody forgot about Elizabeth Seven. The movie producers\nhad talked about hiring her as Frank's leading lady until they found out\nabout a new line of female robots that had just gone on the market. When\nthey screen-tested the whole series and picked a lovely Mylar\nrationaloid named Diana Twelve, it hit Elizabeth pretty hard. She began\nto let herself go after that and Min and I didn't have the heart to say\nanything to her. It was pretty obvious she wasn't oiling herself\nproperly, her hair wasn't brushed and she didn't seem to care when one\nof her photons went dead.\n\nWhen _Forbidden Robot Love_ premiered simultaneously in Hollywood and\nNew York the critics all gave it rave reviews. There were pictures of\nDiana Twelve and Frank making guest appearances all over the country.\nBack at the Io we got in the habit of letting Elizabeth watch TV with us\nsometimes in the Renting Office and one night there happened to be an\ninterview with Frank and Diana at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. I guess\nseeing the pretty robot starlet and her Frank sitting so close together\nin the nightclub must have made the girl mech feel pretty bad. Even then\nshe didn't say a word against the big servo; she just never watched the\nset again after that.\n\nWhen we tabbed up the Io's receipts that year they were so good Min and\nI decided to take a month off for an Earthside vacation. Min's retired\nbrother in Berkeley was nice enough to come out and look after the place\nfor us while we spent four solid weeks soaking up the sun in Southern\nCalifornia. When we got back out to the spotel, though, I could see\nthere was something wrong by the look on Jim's face.\n\n\"It's that girl robot of yours, Bill,\" he said. \"She's gone and\ndeactivated herself.\"\n\nWe went right to 22A and found Elizabeth Seven stretched out on the\nfloor. There was a screwdriver clutched in her hand and the relay banks\nin her side were exposed and horribly blackened.\n\n\"Crazy mech shorted out her own DX,\" Jim said.\n\nMin and I knew why. After Jim left for Earth we dismantled Elizabeth the\nbest we could and put her back in Frank's old locker. We didn't know\nwhat else to do with her.\n\nAnyway, the slack season came and went and before long we were doing\nthe spring cleaning again and wondering how heavy the Jovian Moons trade\nwas going to be. I remember I'd been making some repairs outside and was\njust hanging up my spacesuit in the Renting Office when I heard the\nradar announcing a ship.\n\nIt was the biggest Marvin 990 I'd ever seen that finally suctioned up to\nthe boom and secured. I couldn't take my eyes off the ship. She was\npretty near the last word in rockets and loaded with accessories. It\ntook me a minute or two before I noticed all the faces looking out of\nthe viewports.\n\n\"Min!\" I whispered. \"There's something funny about those faces. They\nlook like--\"\n\n\"Robots!\" Min answered. \"Bill, that 990 is full of mechs!\"\n\nJust as she said it a bulky figure in white space fatigues swung out of\nthe hatch and hurried up the gangplank. Seconds later it burst through\nthe airlock.\n\n\"Frank Nineteen!\" we gasped together.\n\n\"Please, where is Elizabeth?\" he hummed anxiously. \"Is she all right? I\nhave to know.\"\n\nFrank stood perfectly still when I told him about Elizabeth's\nself-deactivation; then a pitiful shudder went through him and he\ncovered his face with his big Neoprene hands.\n\n\"I was afraid of that,\" he said barely audibly. \"Where--you haven't--?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"She's where you always kept her.\"\n\nWith that the big servo-pilot took off for 22A like a berserk robot and\nwe were right behind him. We watched him tear open his old locker and\ngently lay out the girl's mech's parts so he could study them. After a\nminute or two he gave a long sigh and said, \"Fortunately it's not as bad\nas I thought. I believe I can fix her.\" Frank worked hard over the\nblackened relays for twenty minutes, then he set the unit aside and\nbegan assembling the girl. When the final connections were made and the\ndamaged unit installed he flicked on her power. We waited and nothing\nhappened. Five minutes went by. Ten. Slowly the big robot turned away,\nhis broad shoulders drooping slightly.\n\n\"I've failed,\" he said quietly. \"Her DX doesn't respond to the gain.\"\n\nThe girl mech, in her blue dress, lay there motionless where Frank had\nbeen working on her as the servo-pilot muttered over and over, \"It's my\nfault, I did this to you.\"\n\nThen Min shouted: \"Wait! I heard something!\"\n\nThere was a slow click of a relay--and movement. Painfully Elizabeth\nSeven rose on one elbow and looked around her.\n\n\"Frank, darling,\" she murmured, shaking her head. \"I know you're just\nold memory tape. It's all I have left.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, it's really me! I've come to take you away. We're going to\nbe together from now on.\"\n\n\"_You_, Frank? This isn't just old feedback? You've come back to me?\"\n\n\"Forever, darling. Elizabeth, do you remember what I said about those\nwonderful green little worlds, the asteroids? Darling, we're _going_ to\none of them! You and the others will love Alinda, I know you will. I've\nbeen there many times.\"\n\n\"Frank, is your DX all right? What _are_ you talking about?\"\n\n\"How stupid of me, darling--you haven't heard. Elizabeth, thanks to Dr.\nScott, Congress has passed Robot Civil Rights! And that movie I made\nhelped swing public opinion to our side. We're free!\n\n\"The minute I heard the news I applied to Interplanetary for homestead\nrights on Alinda. I made arrangements to buy a ship with the money I'd\nearned and then I put ads in all the Robot Wanted columns for volunteer\ncolonizers. You should have seen the response! We've got thirty robot\ncouples aboard now and more coming later. Darling, we're the first\npioneer wave of free robots. On board we have tons of supplies and\nparts--everything we need for building a sound robot culture.\"\n\n\"Frank Nineteen!\" said the girl mech suddenly. \"I should be furious with\nyou. You and that Diana Twelve--I thought--\"\n\nThe big servo gave a flat whirring laugh. \"Diana and me? But that was\nall publicity, darling. Why, right at the start of the filming Diana\nfell in love with Sam Seventeen, one of the other actors. They're on\nboard now.\"\n\n\"Robot civilization,\" murmured the girl after a minute. \"Oh, Frank, that\nmeans robot government, robot art, robot science ...\"\n\n\"And robot marriage,\" hummed Frank softly. \"There has to be robot law,\ntoo. I've thought it all out. As skipper of the first robot-owned\nrocket, I'm entitled to marry couples in deep space at their request.\"\n\n\"But who marries us, darling? You can't do it yourself.\"\n\n\"I thought of that, too,\" said Frank, turning to me. \"This human\ngentleman has every right to marry us. He's in command of a moving body\nin space just like the captain of a ship. It's perfectly legal, I looked\nit up in the Articles of Space. Will you do it, sir?\"\n\nWell, what could I say when Frank dug into his fatigues and handed me a\nGideon prayer book marked at the marriage service?\n\nElizabeth and Frank said their I do's right there in the Renting Office\nwhile the other robot colonizers looked on. Maybe it was the way I read\nthe service. Maybe I should have been a preacher, I don't know. Anyway,\nwhen I pronounced Elizabeth and Frank robot and wife, that whole bunch\nof lovesick mechs wanted me to do the job for them, too. Big copper work\nrobots, small aluminum sales-girl mechs, plastoid clerks and typists,\nsquatty little Mumetal lab servos, rationaloids, non-rationaloids and\njust plain sub-robots--all sizes and shapes. They all wanted individual\nceremonies, too. It took till noon the next day before the last couple\nwas hitched and the 990 left for Alinda.\n\nLike I said, the spotel business isn't so different from the motel game\nback in California. Sure, you got improvements to make but a new\nsideline can get to be pretty profitable--if you get in on the ground\nfloor.\n\nMin and I got to thinking of all those robot colonizers who'd be coming\nout here. Interplanetary cleared the license just last week. Min framed\nit herself and hung it next to our orbit license in the Renting Office.\nShe says a lot of motel owners do all right as Justices of the Peace.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ December 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
