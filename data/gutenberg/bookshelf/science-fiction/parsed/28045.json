But what of the other\n    planets?_\n\n\nWALLS OF ACID\n\n_BY HENRY HASSE_\n\n\nBraanol stirred, throbbed sluggishly once, then lay quiescent as his\nmental self surged up from the deeps of non-entity. And gradually he\ncame to know that someone had entered the room. His _room_, far beneath\nthe city.\n\nNow he could feel the vibra-currents through the liquids of the huge\ntanks where he had lain somnolent for untold aeons. It was pleasant,\ncaressing. For a moment he floated there, enjoying to the utmost this\nstrange sensation as the renewed thought-life-force set his every\nconvolution to pulsing.\n\n\"To be once more aware! O gloriously aware!\" the thought came fierce and\nvibrant. \"Once more they have wakened me--but how long has it been?\"\nThen curiously: \"And what can they want this time?\"\n\nThe huge brain was alert now, with a supernal sense of keening.\nTentatively he sent out a thought-potential that encompassed the room.\n\n\"They are afraid!\" he sensed. \"Two have entered here, and they are\nafraid of me. I shall remedy that!\"\n\nBraanol lowered his thought-potential to one-eighth of one magnitude,\nand felt his mind contact theirs. \"Approach, my children,\" he said\nkindly. \"You have nothing to fear from me! I take it you are the\nimperial messengers sent by her Supreme Magnificence, the Empress\nAlaazar?\"\n\nHe felt the fright slip from their minds. But they were startled.\n\n\"The Empress Uldulla reigns now, fourth in the Royal line,\" came the\nthought. \"Empress Alaazar died long ago!\"\n\n\"I am truly grieved!\" Braanol flashed to them. \"Alaazar--may she rest in\npeace--did not neglect me! How well I remember her interest in the\nstories I could tell, stories of the Diskra of old when we sent men out\nto glorious adventures on the other planets! Aye! Five millenniums ago\nit was that we achieved space travel. In those days--\"\n\nBraanol ceased in his reminiscences, aware that these two were trying to\nget their thoughts through to him.\n\n\"That is why we have come! The Empress Uldulla, too, wishes a story. The\nstory of the first space-flight from Diskra, and the events that brought\nit about. And of how you--\"\n\n\"Aye! Of how _I_ came to be as you see me now! I shall be delighted, my\nchildren, to tell it again. But first, prepare the trans-telector so\nthat it may be recorded faithfully.\"\n\nBraanol directed them to a machine on the far side of the room, and\ninstructed them as to its operation. Soon the hundreds of tiny coils\nwere humming, and a maze of tubes fed out of the machine, on which would\nbe recorded Braanol's every thought. For a moment he paused, gently\nswaying, pulsing, a huge independent brain suspended in the pale green\nliquid. Then he began his story.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYour Supreme Beneficence! When the imperial messengers came to me,\nbringing the communication with which you deigned to address my\ndecrepit solitude, it was like a glorious ray of light come to illumine\nthe deepening darkness of my declining years!\n\nIt is with trepidation that I set about to fulfill your Exalted Command.\nFive millenniums, aye, even more, have passed, since those who were part\nof that segment of history into which you inquire, have become but\ndrifting dust. Only within the feeble memory of your humblest servant is\nthere any record of it.\n\nFive millenniums! Aye! That was truly the golden period of our beloved\nDiskra--not that our period under _Your_ Serene Effulgence is not golden\nindeed! But in that day all Diskra was under the glorious rule of\nPalladin. His city on the scarlet shores of our central sea was the\nwonder of us _all_. Aye! We had a sea then, where there is now but\ndesert.\n\nThe intelligent planets were three: our own Diskra, of course, fourth\nfrom the sun. And nearest the sun, Mirla, that fiery globe, where life\napes the quality of our own salamander, existing by necessity near the\nflames. And second from the sun Venia, the cloud-capped world, where\nlife exalts the virtues of the fish. Of the third planet, Terra, we then\nknew little.\n\nOur cities faced the sun in those days, towering in polychromatic\nsplendor. Height was no obstacle then, for we had wings--wings! Think of\nit, O Beneficence! No need had we of clumsy, metal vessels. But all that\nhas changed. Now no whirr of wings disturbs the air, and our\nformi-tectural splendors rise _within_. The history of this change is\nwhat Your Supreme Exaltation would know. This, then, is the record.\n\nWith the rule of Palladin was born the age of science, not so much due\nto the intellects of that day, as through the driving urge of ultimate\nnecessity. For Palladin had a brother, Thid. He was unfortunately a\nmutant. Whereas our features were delicate and quite regular, Thid's\nwere gross and stamped with power. His royal head was too large and\ncumbersome, and instead of our slender waists, he was almost\nasymmetrical in shape. In short--no member of our fairer, royal sex\ncould look upon him with aught but horror. And it was because of this\nthat he was dietetically conditioned for the realm of science.\n\nIt was a mistake. As the years passed, the loneliness of his virtual\nexile tended to derange Thid's prodigious mind! Aye, prodigious--and\ndangerous in his manic-depressive state. Then one day Palladin called an\nemergency meeting of the Inner Council. I, Braanol, was a member of that\nCouncil.\n\n\"It has come to my attention,\" Palladin said, \"that Thid has been\ncarrying on certain dangerous experiments! Experiments of a sort that\ncould well be inimical to us--to our very existence!\"\n\nWe well knew to what Palladin referred. But Thid was his brother, one of\nthe Imperial ones. No one dared speak.\n\n\"Why was I not made aware of it sooner?\" Palladin demanded sternly.\n\"You, Braanol! You knew of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, your majesty.\" I was frightened. \"I beg to explain--I have tried\nto dissuade him--\"\n\nPalladin's visage became less stern, as though he understood our\nreluctance in this matter. \"True,\" he said. \"Thid is my brother. He must\nbe mad! And I tell you now: if he has gone as far in this experiment as\nI suspect, I shall not hesitate to apply the only remedy dictated by\nefficiency--death! Have him brought to me at once.\"\n\nBut Thid was nowhere to be found. He had learned of Palladin's anger,\nand had fled into the Diskran desert where the abhorred _Termans_ dwelt\nin myriads despite all our effort to eradicate them. These Termans were\nsoft-bodied, subterranean creatures with an obstinate life-force, and we\nhad long realized that they might one day be a menace to us.\n\nSo into the desert our Thid fled, spurred by the knowledge that his life\nwas forfeit. For a time, he was naturally thought dead. Who could\nsurvive unprotected the extremes of heat and cold? And if by a miracle\nhe triumphed over the elements, how survive the appalling enmity of the\nTermans, whose rudimentary brains conceived no mercy?\n\nNevertheless, startling bits of rumor began to drift in to our city;\nrumors that Thid had been seen, _leading hordes of gigantic Termans\nacross the desert wastes_!\n\nWe laughed, of course, for caravaneers are ever the prey of sun mirages,\nand legends are dear to their souls. A legend was begun concerning Thid.\nArriving caravans vied with each other in fantastic reports. Some had\nseen him with immense hordes of the repulsive Termans. Still others had\ndiscovered subterranean labyrinths being built by the Termans under his\ncommand, and had barely escaped with their lives. And still we laughed,\nblessed by the constant climate on the shores of our sea, and the\nbeneficent rule of our Exalted Palladin.\n\nAnd then we ceased to laugh. Palladin called together his Council of\nScientists.\n\n\"Can it be?\" Palladin asked. \"Two whole caravans have vanished on the\nway to Estka beyond the mountains.\" And he told us more, reports that\nhad arrived from other cities. Survivors had arrived, with the light of\nmadness in their eyes, babbling some nameless fear. Others had died from\nghastly wounds--great burns that refused to heal, but spread a kind of\ndisease through the tissues. I, Braanol, examined some of these wounds\nand reported to Palladin.\n\n\"Only a perverted, scientific intellect such as Thid's could have\nevolved weapons to inflict such wounds!\"\n\n\"If he has organized the Termans,\" suggested another Council Member,\n\"despite their pigmy size, they will become a menace that cannot be\nignored.\"\n\n\"We have delayed too long!\" thundered Palladin. \"Find Thid! I command\nit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn army, the greatest ever assembled on Diskra, was sent forth to hunt\nout Thid and exterminate the Termans whom he had managed to organize by\nheaven only knew what magic. The planet must be cleansed of that leprous\nform of life, else there would be no peace.\n\nBut we did not know what depths of horror we were to plumb. Even now, O\nIllustrious Empress, reason reels and totters at the remembrance. _I_\nled one fine division of the Imperial Guards, armored warriors of the\nfirst magnitude. With them I felt able to conquer planets, not to speak\nof the trivial-sized Termans.\n\nFor many days we trekked, penetrating ever deeper the Red Desert's\nheart. But of the abhorred Termans we caught no sight. There was only\nthe molten downpour of sun by day, and the desiccating numbness of cold\nat night. But on the sixth day, as we encamped near an underground pool\nlocated by our experts--we encountered the Termans.\n\nThe blue wings of dusk were beating down when suddenly, from every\nrampart of sand-dune, every crumbling hillock, out of the very bowels of\nthe planet itself, they came like an avalanche. They carried slender\nmetal tubes that spewed polychromatic death at us! Wherever the deadly\ndischarge touched, would appear horrible burns that ate away the\ntissues. But that isn't what paralyzed us. We had known these vermin to\nbe short of twelve inches tall, but now they reared monstrously _four\nfeet into the air_! Their black, hairy limbs lashed in an ecstasy of\nmurder-lust, their beady eyes gleamed with fiendish purpose. And they\nhad _intelligent leaders_!\n\nThe sight of these monsters grown to such awful size struck terror into\nthe hearts of our legion. Nevertheless, we, who are seven feet tall,\ntowered above them as we fought with the strength and ferocity of\ndesperation. Every weapon at our command was brought into play, and they\nwere blasted and seared by the myriads. Still they came on, blindly,\nunswervingly, as if driven by a single prodigious force.\n\nHow these life-forms had grown to such bestial proportions was not known\nuntil later. We captured a few and delicately probed them--while still\nalive, of course--dissecting their anatomy until we found that some\ngenius had managed to control their growth through glandular\ndevelopment. That genius could only have been our Thid!\n\nSoon the desert was covered by a sea of their dead--and ours! The stench\nwas unbearable, for the Termans exude an odor of their own, particularly\nin death, which is sheer nausea ... but lest I offend your refined\nsensibilities, O Serene Empress, perhaps it were best that I draw a veil\nof darkness over that shambles of horror. At last it seemed as if only\nutter annihilation of both sides would be the outcome. Already the\nbattle had lasted for three obeisances of our Diskra to its parent sun.\n\nAnd then wisely, our glorious Palladin flashed to us the command to\nretreat.\n\n\"Already Estka and Kraaj have fallen, with all the populace wiped out,\"\nsaid the message. \"The Termans are converging upon our capital city!\nReturn here with all haste!\"\n\nSo it was that we retreated--those who remained of us--to the capitol,\nand prepared to make a formidable stand. The other armies of our empire\nhad done likewise. Who would have thought that this despised,\ndestructive form of life could ever become such a menace! We remembered\none of Thid's treatises on the noxious pests, in which he had maintained\nthat they had rudimentary intelligence and an interesting, if\nsub-primitive, form of social life. How we had laughed at the thought of\nimputing a social order to these subterranean aphids!\n\nBut we weren't laughing now! A race of malignant monsters had sprung up\nin the twenty years that Thid had vanished into the desert.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf Thid, nothing more was seen. But we knew he must still exist\nsomewhere among the Termans. Under that baleful inventive genius their\nweapons seemed to multiply, and we were forced to tax our scientists to\nthe utmost in order to have weapons, of offense--and yes, O\nBeneficence--defense!\n\nFor now, though we had managed to stem their attack on our capital, they\nwere steadily encroaching on our territory. Underground lakes and\nstreams were dammed by these fiends. Vast areas of vegetation were\ndenuded. Precious mines of rare metals were converted by them, under\nThid's direction, into sources for their ceaseless attacks. Aye! We died\na thousand deaths multiplied a thousand times.\n\nOur ethero-magnum, by which our telepathic vibrations were amplified for\nplanetary broadcast, became a monotonous recorder of tragedy as city\nafter city fell to the hordes. For untold years this savage struggle\nwent on. How well we realized that this was a war for sole dominance of\nthe planet!\n\nUntil at last, only our proud capital by the shores of the scarlet sea,\nand its immense valley was left to us.\n\n\"We must evolve the principles of inter-spacial travel,\" Palladin told\nus sadly. \"The day may come when we shall need it.\"\n\nHitherto, our rare flights to Venia and Mirla had been primitive affairs\nin which the dangerous rocket principle was employed, with the terrific\neffects of acceleration crushing the crews and making landing an even\ngreater hazard than the flight itself. But now, through inconceivable\nefforts of thought--aye, through sheer desperation!--our scientists\nevolved a system of atomic integration in which free orbital electrons\nwere utilized to create atomic quantities beyond our known table,\ndrawing upon the energy that could be harnessed in the process. It is\ndifficult to describe otherwise than through pure mathematics--though if\nyour Serene Effulgence wishes, I will be happy to describe it to you at\na later date; it will take some little effort to recall the exact\nformulae.\n\n\"We must send an expedition to Terra,\" Palladin told us. \"From what we\nhave been able to gather astronomically, that planet seems habitable.\nMirla, we know, is out of the question; it is a holocaust of fire. And\nto dwell on the semi-aquatic world of Venia, a new environmental\nadaptation would be necessary.\"\n\nFantastic, wasn't it, O Exalted Empress, that we the rightful Lords of\nDiskra should be compelled to abandon our beloved homes by a horde of\nvermin? Indeed it was a tragic day when the first scientific expedition\nwas assembled. And I, Braanol, was honored beyond my humble desserts by\nhis Supreme Magnificence, Palladin. I was assigned as _Recorder_ on the\nexpedition.\n\nStrapped and cushioned until not an inch of my body was visible, I was\nlaunched into space together with my fellow scientists, within the\nspheroid confines of our atomic projectile. The agony of enduring--even\nfor seconds--the required acceleration, will forever remain in my mind\nas the ultimate in torture. But at last the agony was gone, as we\ntraveled at unimaginable speed toward the planet which we hoped would be\nour future home.\n\nNo, not hoped--because meanwhile on Diskra the experiments with acid gas\nwere going on, in a sort of last-ditch defense which we hoped might stem\nthe endless hordes!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was on the eleventh day that we really saw Terra in its full\nprismatic glory. For days it had loomed larger in our three-dimensional\nelectro-cone, where we studied its continents and oceans to select the\nlikeliest spot for a landing. Terra was intensely blue now, rivalling in\ncolor the priceless _zafirines_ of our own Diskra. I hope in the\nhumblest depths of my mind, O Empress Uldulla, that you shall never know\nthe unplumbed abyss of loneliness we all felt.\n\nAt last we were forced to use the forward atomic beam to brake our\nmeteoric entrance into the heavy atmosphere. We had, of course, turned\non the neutralizing frigi-rectifiers that formed a network on the outer\nshell of our sphere. At last we were through. Dipping lower as we\ncircled, we discerned majestic oceans; ice-clad peaks crowning the stark\nglory of the landscape, and then more inviting lands criss-crossed by\nrivers and studded with shining lakes.\n\nIt was to us, O Great Beneficence, a paradise indeed! Entranced, we all\nbut forgot our landing which would require the utmost skill. Brunoj,\nour greatest navigator, was at the controls, padded and cushioned beyond\nthe possibility of injury. The rest of us retired to the special\ncrash-room.\n\nI remember we carried in our laboratory, in a special container of\n_glassaran_, two embalmed specimens of the monstrous Termans. These we\nwere to show as a warning to whatever race existed here. One glance at\nthe revolting monsters would have been enough for an intelligent race.\n\nBut now that would not be necessary. Terra seemed uninhabited. We had\nseen no cities as we circumnavigated the globe. Had intelligent\nlife-forms failed as yet to materialize on this verdant world? We\nassumed that fact, in our joyous eagerness to feel the good earth\nbeneath us.\n\n\"Prepare to land!\" came the warning from Brunoj.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo this day I cannot say what happened. No one knew. For the brief\ninstant in which I remained conscious, I felt as if Terra had burst\nasunder under the terrific impact.\n\nNor do I know when I finally struggled upward from oblivion; it may have\nbeen hours later, or days. Many among us were dead. _I_ was a hopelessly\ncrushed horror who still lived somehow, miraculously. For many days we\nremained within our sphere--disposing of the dead, tending to the\ninjured, conserving our strength. _I_ might have been destroyed, but\nwith that frantic will to live which rises within us, I flashed a\nmessage to my companions:\n\n\"I still live! Place me in the delocalizer! I will still be of use!\"\n\nThis was done. The delocalizer, reacting on the thalamic region of my\nbrain, intercepted pain currents and allowed me to exist without\n_physical_ feeling. Only my mind, lucid and intensely alive as never\nbefore, continued to record the adventure in this world. It was not\nuntil later that my brain was completely dissevered from my crushed\nbody....\n\nMy companions had tested the atmosphere and found no gasses that might\nhave been inimical to our organisms. Thus they prepared for the greatest\nadventure of all--the emergence. The locks were opened. A draft of\nfragrant, if heavy atmosphere swept through our globe. It was pleasantly\ninvigorating and bright outside--so I was told by their telepathic\nmessages, for I alone remained within.\n\nTelepathically they kept me informed, as they wandered up the narrow\nvalley. The soil was firm and amazingly fertile. Vegetation grew thickly\neverywhere. They reached the far end of the valley at last, and rocky\nramparts towered over them.\n\nThen it was--how can I begin to describe it to you, Exalted Empress?\nFrom _their minds_, coming back to me, was a sudden flood of excited,\nhysterical thought! It seemed filled with intense loathing and fear!\nImagine me there, if you can--helpless--and in a frenzy of despair\nwondering what they could have encountered!\n\nDesperately I extended my potential. I managed to intuit a fierce battle\nin which they were engaging. And some of my companions were dying!\nHordes of fierce denizens from the rocks above were descending upon\nthem. They had taken weapons along, true--but I could sense now by their\nfrantic thought that these war-like creatures of Terra numbered in the\nhundreds, with hordes of them swarming from beyond!\n\nFor a long while the battle raged, then I sensed that my companions were\nretreating. Oh, I was glad! Glad! At least I would not be left alone.\nBut of the two score who had ventured out, only _six_ returned. As they\noperated the lock of the ship, and tumbled in, I could see--or rather\n_perceive_--a long part of the terrain behind them.\n\nThen it was that my mind sickened. _For the creatures of this bright new\nworld were--Termans!_ Slightly different from those we had battled on\nDiskra, true. These were even more monstrous, over six feet tall, with\nlong shaggy manes and a reddish fuzz covering their four limbs ... and O\nBeneficence, I swear it--_sickening blue eyes_! They walked upright and\ncarried crude weapons, shafts of wood fitted with sharp-edged _stone_!\n\nNot until much later did my returning companions tell me what they had\nseen through their telescopic lenses. Just beyond this valley were vast\nplains where the Termans seemed to number in the thousands, huge nomadic\ntribes of them. There were other creatures as well, some massive beyond\nall belief, others fierce and blood-lusting with huge saber-like teeth.\n\n\"We could colonize Terra indeed,\" was the consensus of our thoughts, \"but\nat what a price! To be forever battling these creatures--particularly the\nTermans, that abominable _genus Homo_....\"\n\nCan you imagine, O Empress Uldulla, how the irony of it bit us? It was\nalmost more than we could bear to think that on Diskra our own _genus\nFormicae_ was in life-or-death struggle with these creatures and we had\nfound them swarming here as well! All--all of this lush, verdant world\nwas defiled!\n\nThere was nothing we remaining seven could do now. Sadly we set about\nrepairing the ship, so that we could bear the awful tidings back to\nDiskra. And as we sped again toward our beloved planet, a sombre pall\nfell upon us. The interchange of thoughts were brief and tinged with a\nprofound despair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis resolved into amazement, however, as we came ever closer to Diskra.\nFor now, through our telecto-scope we could see that our planet had been\nsubtly altered! A few symmetrical lines had appeared on the face of\nDiskra, as if a cosmic hand had drawn straight lines across with\nmathematical precision!\n\nNot until we had safely landed, did we learn the truth. O joyous news!\nThe hordes of Termans had been repulsed and were even then being slowly\ndriven back! Our scientists had created in the laboratories a type of\n_formic acid_ somewhat similar to the vesicatory secretion occurring\nwithin our own bodies--but infinitely more deadly! It had been used as a\nweapon against the Termans. And more! Huge walls of gaseous formic acid,\nheld unwavering by electronic force fields, were being erected. It was\nthese walls that caused the astronomical illusion we had seen from\nspace.\n\nThe rest, O Illustrious Empress, I believe you know well. How the\nTermans never again were able to penetrate our walls. How we waged war\non the detestable creatures for a number of years until finally no trace\nof them remained on Diskra.\n\nAye! Five millenniums have passed since the events I have related. Five\nmillenniums since my crushed body was done away with and I was preserved\nin my rectangle of _glassaran_, with the constantly renovated\nthought-life-fluid kept exquisitely warm. In this state I have\naccompanied many another expedition to the planets, in my capacity of\nofficial Recorder. I am but Yours to command, Exalted Empress, should\nyou wish to hear of them.\n\nBut I have a warning! Slowly I have developed a new sense that needs not\neyes, nor ears, nor sense of touch--no antennae even, such as I once\npossessed--but unites and transcends all these! And I beg of you in my\nmost abject humility, _do not venture to remove even one formic-acid\nwall_, either from above or from its depth into the ground. Rather build\nmore! Perceptively I shudder in the awful remembrance of their occasion,\nand the day may come when they will be needed once more.\n\nThus I warn humbly, and remain Your Supreme Fertility's most\ninsignificant servant,\n\n                                                              Braanol.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantasy Book_ Vol. 1 Number 1 (1947).\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
