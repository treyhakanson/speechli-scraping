He liked the way it slapped\nback against his shoulder when he fired. Somehow it did not seem a part\nof the dank, steaming Venusian jungle. Probably, he realized with a\nsmile, it was the only old-fashioned recoil rifle on the entire planet.\nAs if anyone else would want to use one of those old bone-cracking\nrelics today! But they all failed to realize it made sport much more\ninteresting.\n\n\"I haven't seen anything for a while,\" his wife said. She had a young,\npretty face and a strong young body. If you have money these days, you\ncould really keep a thirty-five-year-old woman looking trim.\n\nNot on Venus, of course. Venus was an outpost, a frontier, a hot, wet,\nevil-smelling place that beckoned only the big-game hunter. He said,\n\"That's true. Yesterday we could bag them one after the other, as fast\nas I could fire this contraption. Today, if there's anything bigger than\na mouse, it's hiding in a hole somewhere. You know what I think, Lindy?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I think there's a reason for it. A lot of the early Venusian hunters\nsaid there were days like this. An area filled with big lizards and cats\nand everything else the day before suddenly seems to clear out, for no\nreason. It doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"Why not? Why couldn't they all just decide to make tracks for someplace\nelse on the same day?\"\n\nHe slapped at an insect that was buzzing around his right ear, then\nmopped his sweating brow with a handkerchief. His name was Judd Whitney,\nand people said he had a lot of money. Now he laughed, patting his\nwife's trim shoulder under the white tunic. \"No, Lindy. It just doesn't\nwork that way. Not on Earth and not on Venus, either. You think there's\na pied-piper or something which calls all the animals away?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I don't know much about those things.\"\n\n\"No. I don't think they went anyplace. They're just quiet. They didn't\ncome out of their holes or hovels or down from the trees. But why?\"\n\n\"Well, let's forget it. Let's go back to camp. We can try again\ntomor--look! Look, there's something!\"\n\nJudd followed her pointing finger with his eyes. Half-hidden by the\ncreepers and vines clinging to an old tree-stump, something was watching\nthem. It wasn't very big and it seemed in no hurry to get away.\n\n\"What is it?\" Lindy wanted to know.\n\n\"Don't know. Never saw anything like it before. Venus is still an\nunknown frontier; the books only name a couple dozen of the biggest\nanimals. But hell, Lindy, that's not _game_. I don't think it weighs\nfive pounds.\"\n\n\"It's cute, and it has a lovely skin.\"\n\nJudd couldn't argue with that. Squatting on its haunches, the creature\nwas about twenty inches tall. It had a pointed snout and two thin, long\nears. Its eyes were very big and very round and quite black. They looked\nsomething like the eyes of an Earthian tarsier, but the tarsier were\nbloody little beasts. The skin was short and stiff and was a kind of\nsilvery white. Under the sheen, however, it seemed to glow. A diamond is\ncolorless, Judd thought, but when you see it under light a whole rainbow\nof colors sparkle deep within it. This creature's skin was like that,\nJudd decided.\n\n\"If we could get enough of them,\" Lindy was saying, \"I'd have the most\nunusual coat! Do you think we could find enough, Judd?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. Never saw anything like it before, never heard of anything\nlike it. You'd need fifty of 'em, anyway. Let's forget about it--too\nsmall to shoot, anyway.\"\n\n\"No, Judd. I want it.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to stalk a five-pound--hey, wait a minute! I taught\nyou how to use this rifle, so why don't you bag it?\"\n\nLindy grinned. \"That's a fine idea. I was a little scared of some of\nthose big lizards and cats and everything, but now I'm going to take you\nup on it. Here, give me your gun.\"\n\nJudd removed the leather thong from his shoulder and handed the weapon\nto her. She looked at it a little uncertainly, then took the clip of\nshells which Judd offered and slammed it into the chamber. The little\ncreature sat unmoving.\n\n\"Isn't it peculiar that it doesn't run away, Judd?\"\n\n\"Sure is. Nothing formidable about that animal, so unless it has a\nhidden poison somewhere, just about anything in this swamp could do it\nin. To survive it would have to be fast as hell and it would have to\nkeep running all the time. Beats me, Lindy.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to get myself one pelt toward that coat, anyway. Watch,\nJudd: is this the way?\" She lifted the rifle to her shoulder and\nsquinted down the sights toward the shining creature.\n\n\"Yeah, that's the way. Only relax. Relax. Shoulder's so tense you're\nliable to dislocate it with the kick. There--that's better.\"\n\nNow Lindy's finger was wrapped around the trigger and she remembered\nJudd had told her to squeeze it, not to pull it. If you pulled the\ntrigger you jerked the rifle and spoiled your aim. You had to squeeze it\nslowly....\n\nThe animal seemed politely interested.\n\nSuddenly, a delicious languor stole over Lindy. It possessed her all at\nonce and she had no idea where it came from. Her legs had been stiff and\ntired from the all-morning trek through the swamp, but now they felt\nfine. Her whole body was suffused in a warm, satisfied glow of\nwell-being. And laziness. It was an utterly new sensation and she could\neven feel it tingling at the roots of her hair. She sighed and lowered\nthe rifle.\n\n\"I don't want to shoot it,\" she said.\n\n\"You just told me you did.\"\n\n\"I know, but I changed my mind. What's the matter, can't I change my\nmind?\"\n\n\"Of course you can change your mind. But I thought you wanted a coat of\nthose things.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose I do. But I don't want to shoot it, that's all.\"\n\nJudd snorted. \"I think you have a streak of softness someplace in that\npretty head of yours!\"\n\n\"Maybe. I don't know. But I'd still like the pelt. Funny, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay! But don't ask to use the gun again.\" Judd snatched it from\nher hands. \"If you don't want to shoot it, then I will. Maybe we can\nmake you a pair of gloves or something from the pelt.\"\n\nAnd Judd pointed his ancient rifle at the little animal preparing to\nsnap off a quick shot. It would be a cinch at this distance. Even Lindy\nwouldn't have missed, if she hadn't changed her mind.\n\nJudd yawned. He'd failed to realize he was so tired. Not an aching kind\nof tiredness, but the kind that makes you feel good all over. He yawned\nagain and lowered the rifle. \"Changed my mind,\" he said. \"I don't want\nto shoot it, either. What say we head back for camp?\"\n\nLindy gripped his hand impulsively. \"All right, Judd--but I had a\nbrainstorm! I want it for a pet!\"\n\n\"A pet?\"\n\n\"Yes. I think it would be the cutest thing. Everyone would look and\nwonder and I'll adore it!\"\n\n\"We don't know anything about it. Maybe Earth would be too cold, or too\ndry, or maybe we don't have anything it can eat. There are liable to be\na hundred different strains of bacteria that can kill it.\"\n\n\"I said I want it for a pet. See? Look at it! We can call it Black\nEyes.\"\n\n\"Black Eyes--\" Judd groaned.\n\n\"Yes, Black Eyes. If you don't do this one thing for me, Judd--\"\n\n\"Okay--okay. But I'm not going to do anything. You want it, you take\nit.\"\n\nLindy frowned, looked at him crossly, then sloshed across the swamp\ntoward Black Eyes. The creature waited on its stump until she came quite\nclose, and then, with a playful little bound, it hopped onto her\nshoulder, still squatting on its haunches. Lindy squealed excitedly and\nbegan to stroke its silvery fur.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA month later, they returned to Earth. Judd and Lindy and Black Eyes.\nThe hunting trip had been a success--Judd's trophies were on their way\nhome on a slow freighter, and he'd have some fine heads and skins for\nhis study-room. Even Black Eyes had been no trouble at all. It ate\nscraps from their table, forever sitting on its haunches and staring at\nthem with its big black eyes. Judd thought it would make one helluva\nlousy pet, but he didn't tell Lindy. Trouble was, it never did anything.\nIt merely sat still, or occasionally it would bounce down to the floor\nand mince along on its hind-legs for a scrap of food. It never uttered a\nsound. It did not frolic and it did not gambol. Most of the time it\ncould have been carved from stone. But Lindy was happy and Judd said\nnothing.\n\nThey had a little trouble with the customs officials. This because\nnothing unknown could be brought to Earth without a thorough\nexamination.\n\nAt the customs office, a bespectacled official stared at Black Eyes,\nscratching his head. \"Never seen one like that before.\"\n\n\"Neither have I,\" Judd admitted.\n\n\"Well, I'll look in the book.\" The man did, but there are no thorough\ntomes on Venusian fauna. \"Not here.\"\n\n\"I could have told you.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll have to quarantine it and study it. That means you and your\nwife go into quarantine, too. It could have something that's catching.\"\n\n\"Absurd!\" Lindy cried.\n\n\"Sorry, lady. I only work here.\"\n\n\"You and your bright ideas,\" Judd told his wife acidly. \"We may be\nquarantined a month until they satisfy themselves about Black Eyes.\"\n\nThe customs official shrugged his bony shoulders, and Judd removed a\ntwenty-credit note from his pocket and handed it to the man. \"Will this\nchange your mind?\"\n\n\"I should say not! You can't bribe me, Mr. Whitney! You can't--\" The man\nyawned, stretched languidly, smiled. \"No, sir, you can keep your money,\nMr. Whitney. Guess we don't have to examine your pet after all. Mighty\ncute little feller. Well, have fun with it. Come on, move along now.\"\nAnd, as they were departing with Black Eyes, still not believing their\nears: \"Darn this weather! Makes a man so lazy....\"\n\nIt was after the affair at the customs office, that Black Eyes uttered\nits first sound. City life hasn't changed much in the last fifty years.\nJet-cars still streak around the circumferential highways, their\nwhistles blaring. Factories still belch smoke and steam, although the\nnew atomic power plants have lessened that to a certain extent. Crowds\nstill throng the streets, noisy, hurrying, ill-mannered. It's one of\nthose things that can't be helped. A city has to live, and it has to\nmake noise.\n\nBut it seemed to frighten Lindy's new pet. It stared through the jet-car\nwindow on the way from the spaceport to the Whitneys' suburban home, its\nblack eyes welling with tears.\n\n\"Look!\" Judd exclaimed. \"Black Eyes can cry!\"\n\n\"A crying pet, Judd. I knew there would be something unusual about Black\nEyes, I just knew it!\"\n\nThe tears in the big black eyes overflowed and tumbled out, rolling down\nBlack Eyes' silvery cheeks. And then Black Eyes whimpered. It was only a\nbrief whimper, but both Judd and Lindy heard it, and even the driver\nturned around for a moment and stared at the animal.\n\nThe driver stopped the jet. He yawned and rested his head comfortably on\nthe cushioned seat. He went quietly to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA man named Merrywinkle owned the Merrywinkle Shipping Service. That, in\nitself, was not unusual. But at precisely the moment that Black Eyes\nunleashed its mild whimper, Mr. Merrywinkle--uptown and five miles\naway--called an emergency conference of the board of directors and\ndeclared:\n\n\"Gentlemen, we have all been working too hard, and I, for one, am going\nto take a vacation. I don't know when I'll be back, but it won't be\nbefore six months.\"\n\n\"But C.M.,\" someone protested. \"There's the Parker deal and the Gilette\ncontract and a dozen other things. You're needed!\"\n\nMr. Merrywinkle shook his bald head. \"What's more, you're all taking\nvacations, with pay. Six months, each of you. We're closing down\nMerrywinkle Shipping for half a year. Give the competition a break, eh?\"\n\n\"But C.M.! We're about ready to squeeze out Chambers Parcel Co.! They'll\nget back on their feet in six months.\"\n\n\"Never mind. Notify all departments of the shut-down, effective\nimmediately. Vacations for all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Who shut off the assembly belt?\" the foreman asked mildly. He was not a\nmild man and he usually stormed and ranted at the slightest provocation.\nThis was at Clewson Jetcraft, and you couldn't produce a single\njet-plane without the assembly belt, naturally.\n\nA plump little man said, \"I did.\"\n\n\"But why?\" the foreman asked him, smiling blandly.\n\n\"I don't know. I just did.\"\n\nThe foreman was still smiling. \"I don't blame you.\"\n\nTwo days later, Clewson Jetcraft had to lay off all its help. They put\nads in all the papers seeking new personnel but no one showed up.\nClewson was forced to shut down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe crack Boston to New York pneumo-tube commuter's special pulled to a\nbone-jarring stop immediately outside the New York station. Some angry\ncommuters pried open the conductor's cab, and found the man snoozing\nquite contentedly. They awakened him, but he refused to drive the train\nany further. All the commuters had to leave the pneumo-train and edge\ntheir way along three miles of catwalk to the station. No one was very\nhappy about it, but the feeling of well-being which came over them all\nnipped any possible protest in the bud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlack Eyes whimpered again when Judd and Lindy reached home but after\nthat it was quiet. It just sat on its haunches near the window and\nstared out at the city.\n\nThe quiet city.\n\nNothing moved in the streets. Nothing stirred. People remained at home\nwatching local video or the new space-video from Mars. At first it was a\ngood joke, and the newspapers could have had a field day with it, had\nthe newspapers remained in circulation. After four days, however, they\nsuspended publication. On the fifth day, there was a shortage of food in\nthe city, great stores of it spoiling in the warehouses. Heat and light\nfailed after a week, and the fire department ignored all alarms a day\nlater.\n\nBut everything did not stop. School teachers still taught their classes;\nclerks still sold whatever goods were left on local shelves. Librarians\nwere still at their desks.\n\nConservatives said it was a liberal plot to undermine capital and demand\nhigher wages; liberals said big business could afford the temporary\nlayoff and wanted to squeeze out the small businessman and labor unions.\n\nScientists pondered and city officials made speeches over video.\n\n\"Something,\" one of them observed, \"has hit our city. Work that requires\nanything above a modicum of sound has become impossible; in regards to\nsuch work people have become lazy. No one can offer any valid\nsuggestions concerning the malady. It merely exists. However, if a stop\nis not put to it--and soon--our fair city will disintegrate. Something\nis making us lazy, and that laziness can spell doom, being a compulsive\nlack of desire to create any noise or disturbance. If anyone believes he\nhas the solution, he should contact the Department of Science at once.\nIf you can't use the video-phone, come in person. But come! Every hour\nwhich passes adds to the city's woes.\"\n\nNothing but scatter-brained ideas for a week, none of them worth\nconsideration. Then the bespectacled customs official who had bypassed\nquarantine for Black Eyes, got in touch with the authorities. He had\nalways been a conscientious man--except for that one lapse. Maybe the\nqueer little beast had nothing to do with this crisis. But then again,\nthe customs official had never before--or since--had that strange\nfeeling of lassitude. Could there be some connection?\n\nA staff of experts on extra-terrestrial fauna was dispatched to the\nWhitney residence, although, indeed, the chairman of the Department of\nScience secretly considered the whole idea ridiculous.\n\nThe staff of experts introduced themselves. Then, ignoring the protests\nof Lindy, went to work on Black Eyes. At first Judd thought the animal\nwould object, but apparently it did not. While conditions all about them\nin the city worsened, the experts spent three days studying Black Eyes.\n\nThey found nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBlack Eyes merely stared back at them, and but for an accident, they\nwould have departed without a lead. On the third day, a huge mongrel dog\nwhich belonged to the Whitneys' next-door neighbors somehow slipped its\nleash. It was a fierce and ugly animal, and it was known to attack\nanything smaller than itself. It jumped the fence and landed in Judd\nWhitney's yard. A few loping bounds took it through an open window,\nground level. Inside, it spied Black Eyes and made for the creature at\nonce, howling furiously.\n\nBlack Eyes didn't budge.\n\nAnd the mongrel changed its mind! The slavering tongue withdrew inside\nthe chops, the howling stopped. The mongrel lay down on the floor and\nwhined. Presently it lost all interest, got to its feet, and left as it\nhad come.\n\nOther animals were brought to the Whitney home. Cats. Dogs. A lion from\nthe city zoo, starved for two days and brought in a special mobile cage\nby its keeper. Black Eyes was thrust into the cage and the lion gave\nforth with a hideous yowling. Soon it stopped, rolled over, and slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scientists correlated their reports, returned with them to the\nWhitney house. The leader, whose name was Jamison, said: \"As closely as\nwe can tell, Black Eyes is the culprit.\"\n\n\"What?\" Lindy demanded.\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Whitney. Your pet, Black Eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't believe it!\"\n\nBut Judd said, \"Go ahead, Dr. Jamison. I'm listening.\"\n\n\"Well, how does an animal--any animal--protect itself?\"\n\n\"Why, in any number of ways. If it has claws or a strong jaw and long\nteeth, it can fight. If it is fleet of foot, it can run. If it is big\nand has a tough hide, most other animals can't hurt it anyway. Umm-mm,\ndoesn't that about cover it?\"\n\n\"You left out protective coloration, defensive odors, and things like\nthat. Actually, those are most important from our point of view, for\nBlack Eyes' ability is a further ramification of that sort of thing.\nYour pet is not fast. It isn't strong. It can't change color and it has\nno offensive odor to chase off predatory enemies. It has no armor. In\nshort, can you think of a more helpless creature to put down in those\nVenusian swamps?\"\n\nAfter Judd had shaken his head, Dr. Jamison continued: \"Very well, Black\nEyes should not be able to survive on Venus--and yet, obviously the\ncreature did. We can assume there are more of the breed, too. Anyway,\nBlack Eyes survives. And I'll tell you why.\n\n\"Black Eyes has a very uncommon ability to sense danger when it\napproaches. And sensing danger, Black Eyes can thwart it. Your creature\nsends out certain emanations--I won't pretend to know what they\nare--which stamp aggression out of any predatory creatures. Neither of\nyou could fire upon it--right?\"\n\n\"Umm-mm, that's true,\" Judd said.\n\nLindy nodded.\n\n\"Well, that's one half of it. There's so much about life we don't\nunderstand. Black Eyes uses energy of an unknown intensity, and the\nresult maintains Black Eyes' life. Now, although that is the case, your\nanimal did not live a comfortable life in the Venusian swamp. Because no\nanimal would attack it, it could not be harmed. Still, from what you\ntell me about that swamp ...\n\n\"Anyhow, Black Eyes was glad to come away with you, and everything went\nwell until you landed in New York. The noises, the clattering, the\ncontinual bustle of a great city--all this frightened the creature. It\nwas being attacked--or, at least that's what it must have figured.\nResult: it struck back the only way it knew how. Have you ever heard\nabout sub-sonic sound-waves, Mr. Whitney, waves of sound so low that our\nears cannot pick them up--waves of sound which can nevertheless stir our\nemotions? Such things exist, and, as a working hypothesis, I would say\nBlack Eyes' strange powers rest along those lines. The whole city is\nidle because Black Eyes is afraid!\"\n\nIn his exploration of Mars, of Venus, of the Jovian moons, Judd Whitney\nhad seen enough of extra-terrestrial life to know that virtually\nanything was possible, and Black Eyes would be no exception to that\nrule.\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\" Judd demanded.\n\n\"Do? Why, we'll have to kill your creature, naturally. You can set a\nvalue on it and we will meet it, but Black Eyes must die.\"\n\n\"No!\" Lindy cried. \"You can't be sure, you're only guessing, and it\nisn't fair!\"\n\n\"My dear woman, don't you realize this is a serious situation? The\ncity's people will starve in time. No one can even bring food in because\nthe trucks make too much noise! As an alternative, we could evacuate,\nbut is your pet more valuable than the life of a great city?\"\n\n\"N-no....\"\n\n\"Then, please! Listen to reason!\"\n\n\"Kill it,\" Judd said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nDr. Jamison withdrew from his pocket a small blasting pistol used by the\nDepartment of Domestic Animals for elimination of injured creatures. He\nadvanced on Black Eyes, who sat on its haunches in the center of the\nroom, surveying the scientist.\n\nDr. Jamison put his blaster away. \"I can't,\" he said. \"I don't want to.\"\n\nJudd smiled. \"I know it. No one--no _thing_--can kill Black Eyes. You\nsaid so yourself. It was a waste of time to try it. In that case--\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Dr. Jamison finished for him, \"we're helpless. There\nisn't a man--or an animal--on Earth that will destroy this thing. Wait\na minute--does it sleep, Mr. Whitney?\"\n\n\"I don't think so. At least, I never saw it sleep. And your team of\nscientists, did they report anything?\"\n\n\"No. As far as they could see, the creature never slept. We can't catch\nit unawares.\"\n\n\"Could you anesthetize it?\"\n\n\"How? It can sense danger, and long before you could do that, it would\nstop you. It's only made one mistake, Mr. Whitney: it believes the\nnoises of the city represent a danger. And that's only a negative\nmistake. Noise won't hurt Black Eyes, of course. It simply makes the\nanimal unnecessarily cautious. But we cannot anesthetize it any more\nthan we can kill it.\"\n\n\"I could take it back to Venus.\"\n\n\"Could you? Could you? I hadn't thought of that.\"\n\nJudd shook his head. \"I can't.\"\n\n\"What do you mean you can't?\"\n\n\"It won't let me. Somehow it can sense our thoughts when we think\nsomething it doesn't want. I can't take it to Venus! No man could,\nbecause it doesn't want to go.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Whitney--do you mean to say you believe it can _think_?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Didn't say that. It can sense our thoughts, and that's something\nelse again.\"\n\nDr. Jamison threw his hands up over his head in a dramatic gesture.\n\"It's hopeless,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThings grew worse. New York crawled along to a standstill. People began\nto move from the city. In trickles, at first, but the trickles became\ntorrents, as New York's ten million people began to depart for saner\nplaces. It might take months--it might even take years, but the exodus\nhad begun. Nothing could stop it. Because of a harmless little beast\nwith the eyes of a tarsier, the life of a great city was coming to an\nend.\n\nWord spread. Scientists all over the world studied reports on Black\nEyes. No one had any ideas. Everyone was stumped. Black Eyes had no\nparticular desire to go outside. Black Eyes merely remained in the\nWhitney house, contemplating nothing in particular, and stopping\neverything.\n\nDr. Jamison, however, was a persistent man. Judd got a letter from him\none day, and the following afternoon he kept his appointment with the\nscientist.\n\n\"It's good to get out,\" Judd said, after a three hour walk to the\nDepartment of Science Building. \"I can go crazy just staring at that\nthing.\"\n\n\"I have it, Whitney.\"\n\n\"You have what? Not the way to destroy Black Eyes? I don't believe it!\"\n\n\"It's true. Consider. Everyone in the world does not yet know of your\npet, correct?\"\n\n\"I suppose there are a few people who don't--\"\n\n\"There are many. Among them, are the crew of a jet-bomber which has been\non maneuvers in Egypt. We have arranged everything.\"\n\n\"Yes? How?\"\n\n\"At noon tomorrow, the bomber will appear over your home with one of\nthe ancient, high-explosive missiles. Your neighbors will be removed\nfrom the vicinity, and, precisely at twelve-o-three in the afternoon,\nthe bomb will be dropped. Your home will be destroyed. Black Eyes will\nbe destroyed with it.\"\n\nJudd looked uncomfortable. \"I dunno,\" he said. \"Sounds too easy.\"\n\n\"Too easy? I doubt if the animal will ever sense what is going on--not\nwhen the crew of the bomber doesn't know, either. They'll consider it a\nmighty peculiar order, to destroy one harmless, rather large and rather\nelaborate suburban home. But they'll do it. See you tomorrow, Whitney,\nafter this mess is behind us.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Judd said. \"Yeah.\" But somehow, the scientist had failed to\ninstill any of his confidence in Judd.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith Lindy, he left home at eleven the following morning, after making a\nthorough list of all their properties which the City had promised to\nduplicate. Judd did not look at Black Eyes as he left, and the animal\nremained where it was, seated on its haunches under the dining room\ntable, nibbling crumbs. Judd could almost feel the big round eyes boring\na pair of twin holes in his back, and he dared not turn around to face\nthem....\n\nThey were a mile away at eleven forty-five, making their way through the\nnearly deserted streets. Judd stopped walking. He looked at Lindy. Lindy\nlooked at him.\n\n\"They're going to destroy it,\" he said.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Do you want them to?\"\n\n\"I--I--\"\n\nJudd knew that something had to be done with Black Eyes. He didn't like\nthe little beast, and, anyway, that had nothing to do with it. Black\nEyes was a menace. And yet, something whispered in Judd's ear, _Don't\nlet them, don't let them ..._ It wasn't Judd and it wasn't Judd's\nsubconscious. It was Black Eyes, and he knew it. But he couldn't do a\nthing about it--\n\n\"I'm going to stay right here and let them bomb the place,\" he said\naloud. But as he spoke, he was running back the way he had come.\n\nFifteen minutes.\n\nHe sprinted part of the time, then rested, then sprinted again. He was\nsomewhat on the beefy side and he could not run fast, but he made it.\nJust.\n\nHe heard the jet streaking through the sky overhead, looked up once and\nsaw it circling. Two blocks from his house he was met by a policeman.\nThe entire area had been roped off, and the officer shook his head when\nJudd tried to get through.\n\n\"But I live there!\"\n\n\"Can't help it, Mister. Orders is orders.\"\n\nJudd hit him. Judd didn't want to, but nevertheless, he grunted with\nsatisfaction when he felt the blow to be a good one, catching the stocky\nofficer on the point of his chin and tumbling him over backwards. Then\nJudd was ducking under the rope and running.\n\nHe reached his house, plummeted in through the front door. He found\nBlack Eyes under the kitchen table, squatting on its haunches. He\nscooped the animal up, ran outside. Then he was running again, and\nbefore he reached the barrier, something rocked him. A loud series of\nexplosions ripped through his brain, and instinctively--Black Eyes'\ninstincts, not his--he folded his arms over the animal, protecting it.\nSomething shuddered and began to fall behind him, and debris scattered\nin all directions. Something struck Judd's head and he felt the ground\nslapping up crazily at his face--\n\nHe was as good as new a few days later.\n\nAnd so was Black Eyes.\n\n\"I have it,\" Judd said to his nurse.\n\n\"You have what, sir?\"\n\n\"It's so simple, so ridiculously simple, maybe that's why no one ever\nthought of it. Get me Dr. Jamison!\"\n\nJamison came a few moments later, breathless. \"Well?\"\n\n\"I have the solution.\"\n\n\"You ... do?\" Not much hope in the answer. Dr. Jamison was a tired,\ndefeated man.\n\n\"Sure. Black Eyes doesn't like the city. Fine. Take him out. I can't\ntake him to Venus. He doesn't like Venus and he won't go. No one can\ntake him anyplace he doesn't want to go, just as no one can hurt him in\nany way. But he doesn't like the city. It's too noisy. All right: have\nsomeone take him far from the city, far far away--where there's no noise\nat all. Someplace out in the sticks where it won't matter much if Black\nEyes puts a stop to any disturbing noises.\"\n\n\"Who will take him? You, Mr. Whitney?\"\n\nJudd shook his head. \"That's your job, not mine. I've given you the\nanswer. Now use it.\"\n\nLindy had arrived, and Lindy said: \"Judd, you're right. That _is_ the\nanswer. And you're wonderful--\"\n\nNo one volunteered to spend his life in exile with Black Eyes, but then\nDr. Jamison pointed out that while no one knew the creature's life-span,\nit certainly couldn't be expected to match man's. Just a few years and\nthe beast would die, and ... Dr. Jamison's arguments were so logical\nthat he convinced himself. He took Black Eyes with him into the Canadian\nNorthwoods, and there they live.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJudd was right--almost.\n\nThis was the obvious answer which escaped everyone.\n\nBut scientists continued their examinations of Black Eyes, and they\ndiscovered something. Black Eyes' fears had not been for herself alone.\nShe is going to have babies. The estimate is for thirty-five little\ntarsier-eyed creatures. No doctor in the world will be able to do\nanything but deliver the litter.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _If Worlds of Science Fiction_ March\n    1952.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
