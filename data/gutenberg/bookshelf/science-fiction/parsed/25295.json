He made his last appearance in the wheat pit as a\n   heavy buyer Tuesday forenoon. That afternoon he left his office at\n   Room 87 Board of Trade, and has not been seen since, nor can his\n   whereabouts be learned. He is six feet two inches high, of athletic\n   build, with black hair and moustache, a regular nose, and an\n   unpronounced Jewish appearance. His age is hardly more than\n   twenty-seven, but he has often made himself felt as a market force on\n   the Board of Trade, where he was well thought of.\"\n\nBut it was the _Evening Post_ of the same date which prided itself on\nunearthing the real sensation. A scare-head across the top of a first\npage column read:\n\n   \"A PLUNGER'S LAST PLUNGE!\"\n\n   \"The daring young broker who held the whole wheat market in his hands\n   a few months ago, amassing an independent fortune in three days, but\n   losing most of it gamely on subsequent changes in the market, has\n   made his last plunge. This time he has gone into the cold, kind bosom\n   of Lake Michigan. Isidor Werner evened up his trades in the wheat\n   market last Tuesday forenoon, and then applied for his balance-sheet\n   at a higher clearing house! No trace of him or clue to his\n   whereabouts was found, until the _Evening Post_, on the principle of\n   setting one mystery to solve another, sent its representative to\n   examine a strange steel rocket, discovered half-buried in the sands\n   of Lake Michigan, near Berrien Springs, two days ago. Our reporter\n   investigated this bullet-shaped contrivance and found an opening into\n   it, and within he discovered a scrap of paper on which were written\n   the words: 'Farewell to Earth for ever!' Werner's friends, when\n   interviewed by the _Evening Post_, all positively identified the\n   handwriting of this scrap as his chirography. It is supposed that he\n   took an excursion steamer to St. Joseph, Michigan, last Tuesday or\n   Wednesday afternoon, and walking down the shore toward Berrien\n   Springs, finally threw himself into the Lake. Neither Israel Werner,\n   with whom the dead man lived on Indiana Avenue, nor Patrick Flynn,\n   the chief clerk at his office, can give any reason for the suicide,\n   or explain the exact connection of the infernal machine (if such it\n   be) with the sad circumstance. But they both positively identify the\n   handwriting on the scrap of paper. We have wired our representative\n   to bring the mysterious machine to Chicago; and those who think they\n   may be able to throw any light upon the case, are invited to call at\n   the office of the _Evening Post_ and examine it.\"\n\nThe _Inter Ocean_ developed a theory that the suicide was only a\npretended one for the purpose of fraudulently collecting life insurance\npolicies. It was cited that Isidor Werner had insured his life for more\nthan $100,000, and this in spite of the fact that he had no family,\nparents, brothers or sisters to provide for; but had taken the policies\nin favour of his uncle, Israel Werner, and in case of his prior death,\nin favour of a cousin, Ruth Werner. This theory gained but little\ncurrency among those who knew the man best, and although the insurance\ncompanies prepared to resist payment of the policies to the bitter end,\nyet, as time went on, no one attempted to prove his death, nor to claim\nthe handsome sum which would result from it. Moreover, Israel Werner and\nhis daughter Ruth, the beneficiaries under the policies, persisted in\nbelieving that their relative was yet alive, though they could give no\ngood reasons for so believing, nor explain his disappearance.\n\nIn its issue of June 15th the _Tribune_ scouted the idea of suicide\naltogether. It had a better and more plausible theory of the case.\nIsidor Werner had a large sum of money in the Corn Exchange Bank,\ndrawing interest by the year. In case of either a premeditated or a\npretended suicide he would most certainly have withdrawn, and made some\ndisposition of, this money. In fact, he had, on the day of his\ndisappearance, drawn out five thousand dollars of it in gold. For this\ncoin the _Tribune_ believed he had been murdered, and that they had a\nclue to the murderer. The vanished man had several times been seen in\nthe company of a suspicious German, of intelligent but erratic\nappearance. This queer character lived in a hotbed of socialism on the\nWest Side, and the young broker was supposed to be in his power. In\nfact, it was known for certain that the erratic German had secured a\nlarge sum of money from him, and that Werner had visited his rooms in\nthe slums of the West Side more than once. Moreover, the two had made a\nsecret railway journey together two days before the disappearance, and\non the very day that Werner was last seen, the German had fled his\nlodgings without giving any explanation of his departure to his few\nacquaintances. When the _Tribune_ reporter called at these lodgings, the\nlandlord still had in his possession a gold eagle, with which the German\nhad paid his rent, and in the grate of the deserted room were the\ncharred remains of burnt papers. One of these was a rather firm, crisp\ncinder, and had been a blue-print of a drawing. As nearly as could be\njudged, from its shrivelled state, it appeared to be the plan of some\ninfernal machine. The name of the fugitive was Anderwelt, and he called\nhimself a doctor. Further investigations were being carried on by the\n_Tribune_, which promised to prove beyond a doubt that he was the\nmurderer of Isidor Werner.\n\nBut the _Evening Post_ still held the palm for sensations, and I copy\nverbatim from its columns of June 15th:\n\n   \"It is rare that a newspaper, dealing strictly in facts, has to\n   record anything so closely bordering on the supernatural and\n   mysterious as that which we must now relate. The following facts,\n   however, are vouched for by the entire editorial department of the\n   _Evening Post_, and many of them by several hundred witnesses. We\n   begin by apologising to the hundreds who have called at this office\n   and have been unable to see the Werner infernal machine. We gave it\n   that name in a thoughtless jest, but its subsequent actions have more\n   than justified the title. Our reporter brought it from Berrien\n   Springs, as directed, and deposited it in the court of the _Evening\n   Post_ building. As is quite generally known, this court is a central\n   well in the building, affording ventilation and light to the interior\n   offices, from every one of which can be seen what goes on in it. The\n   well is spanned by a glass roof above the eighth storey. In this\n   court, at eleven o'clock this morning, the entire editorial and a\n   large part of the business staff of this paper, repaired, to examine\n   the mysterious rocket-like thing. A little lid was opened, showing\n   the recess where the tell-tale scrap of paper, written by Werner, had\n   been found. Inside there seemed to be a pair of peculiar battery\n   cells, whose exact nature was hidden by the outer shell. Outside\n   there were several thumb-screws, which were turned both ways without\n   any apparent effect. While making this examination the machine had\n   been set up on its lower end, and when it was again laid down it\n   _refused to lie on its side_, but persisted in _standing erect of its\n   own accord_. This was the more wonderful because the lower end was\n   not flat, so that it would afford a good base, but was pointed. More\n   than a hundred people saw it stand up on this sharp tip, saw it lift\n   up light weights which were placed upon it to hold it on its side,\n   and saw it quickly right itself when it was placed vertically but\n   wrong end down.\n\n   \"Thinking this queer property had been contributed to it in some way\n   by loosening the thumb-screws, they were next all set down as tightly\n   as possible, to see if this tendency to erectness would be lost.\n   Then, to the astonishment of every one in the court, and of several\n   hundred people who were by this time watching from the interior\n   windows, this infernal machine, without any explosion, burning of\n   gases, or any apparent force acting upon it, slowly _rose from the\n   ground_, and then, travelling more swiftly, _shot through the roof of\n   glass_ and vanished from sight! Nor has the most diligent search\n   enabled us to recover it. Does it possess the secret of Isidor\n   Werner's death?\"\n\nBut the Chicago _Herald_ had been working thoroughly and saying little\nuntil its issue of June 16th, when it claimed the credit of solving the\nwhole mystery. Its long article lies before me as I write: There had\nbeen no suicide; there had been no murder; there had been no infernal\nmachine. Doctor Anderwelt was a learned man, and the warm personal\nfriend of Isidor Werner. Both men had shared the same fate; they might\nyet be alive, but they were certainly _at the bottom of Lake Michigan\ntogether_! They were imprisoned there in a sunken submarine boat, which\nwas the invention of Doctor Anderwelt, and was built with funds\nfurnished by the young broker. The foundryman who had constructed the\nbig torpedo-shaped contrivance had been interviewed. He knew both men,\nand they were on the most friendly terms. In a moment of confidence\nDoctor Anderwelt had told him the machine was for submarine exploration;\nhad explained the four-winged rudder, which would make it dive into the\nwater, rise to the surface, or direct it to right or to left. Moreover,\nthere were closed living compartments, around which were chambers\ncontaining a supply of air. He himself had pumped them full of\ncompressed air, and it was so arranged that foul air could be let out\nwhen used and new air admitted. When all had been finished the\nfoundryman had shipped the new invention, _via_ the Michigan Southern\nRailway, to the shore of the Lake near Whiting, Indiana. Next the\n_Herald_ had sought and found the conductor whose train had hauled it to\nWhiting. He remembered switching off the flat-car there, and he was\nsurprised on his return trip next morning to see the heavy thing already\nunloaded and gone.\n\nUndoubtedly, the two men had made an experiment with the diving boat\nunder the surface of the water; and its failure to operate as hoped had\nresulted in its sinking to the bottom, with the two men imprisoned in\nit. On no other hypothesis could its disappearance, and that of the two\nmen, be so plausibly accounted for. But as they had stores of air, and\nprobably of food, there was a possibility that they were still alive\ninside the thing in the bottom of the Lake! Only three days had elapsed\nsince it had been launched, and the _Herald_ was willing to head a\nsubscription to drag the Lake and send divers to search for and rescue\nthe two unfortunate men!\n\nAll this serves to illustrate the untiring energy of newspaper\ninvestigation, as well as the remarkable fertility of journalistic\nimagination; for none of these clever theories hit at the real truth, or\nexplained the correct bearing of the astonishing facts which the\nnewspapers had so industriously unearthed.\n\nAnd if the mystery of the disappearance of Isidor Werner was uncommonly\ndeep and wonderful, the explanation and final solution of it is not less\nmarvellous. After a delay of more than six years, it has just now come\ninto my hands whole and perfect. It is in no less satisfactory form than\na complete manuscript written by the very hand of Isidor Werner! I came\nstrangely into possession of it, and it relates a story of interest and\nwonder, compared with which the mystery of his disappearance pales into\ninsignificance. But the reader may judge for himself, for here follows\nthe story exactly as he wrote it. Upon his manuscript I have bestowed\nhardly more than a proof-reader's technical revision.\n\n                                                   ELLSWORTH DOUGLASS.\n\n    BOSTON, U.S.A.,\n _December 13th, 1898._\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\nSecrets of Space\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nDr. Hermann Anderwelt\n\n\nI had been busy all day trying to swarm the bees and secure my honey.\nThe previous day had been February 29th, a date which doesn't often\nhappen, and which I had especial reason to remember, for it had been the\nmost successful of my business career. I had made a long guess at the\nshaky condition of the great house of Slater, Bawker & Co., who had been\nheavy buyers of wheat. I had talked the market down, sold it down,\nhammered it down; and, true enough, what nobody else seemed to expect\nreally happened. The big firm failed, the price of wheat went to smash\nin a panic of my mixing, and, as a result, I saw a profit of more than\ntwo hundred thousand dollars in the deal. But, in order to secure this\nsnug sum, I still had to buy back the wheat I had sold at higher prices,\nand this I didn't find so easy. The crowd in the wheat pit had seen my\nhand, and were letting me play it alone against them all.\n\nAfter the session I hurried to my office to get my overcoat and hat,\nhaving an engagement to lunch at the Club.\n\n\"If you please, Mr. Werner, there is a queer old gentleman in your\nprivate office who wishes to see you,\" said Flynn, my chief clerk.\n\n\"Ask him to call again to-morrow; I am in a great hurry to-day,\" I said,\nslipping on one sleeve of my overcoat as I started out.\n\n\"But he has been waiting in there since eleven o'clock, and said he very\nmuch wished to see you when you had plenty of time. He would not allow\nme to send on the floor for you during the session.\"\n\n\"Since eleven o'clock! Did he have his lunch and a novel sent up? Well,\nI can hardly run away from a man who has waited three and a half hours\nto see me;\" and I entered my private office with my overcoat on.\n\nSeated in my deep, leathern arm-chair was an elderly man, with rather\nlong and bushy iron-grey hair, and an uneven grey beard. His head\ninclined forward, he breathed heavily, and was apparently fast asleep.\n\n\"You will pardon my awaking you, but I never do business asleep!\" I\nventured rather loudly.\n\nSlowly the steel-blue eyes opened, and, without any start or\ndiscomposure, the old man answered,--\n\n\"And I--my most successful enterprises are developed in my dreams.\"\n\nHis features and his accent agreed in pronouncing him German. He arose\ncalmly, buttoned the lowest button of his worn frock-coat, and, instead\nof extending his hand to me, he poked it inside his coat, letting it\nhang heavily on the single button. It was a lazy but characteristic\nattitude. It tended to make his coat pouch and his shoulders droop. I\nremembered having seen it somewhere before.\n\n\"Mr. Werner, I have a matter of the deepest and vastest importance to\nunfold to you,\" he began, rather mysteriously, \"for which I desire five\nhours of your unemployed time----\"\n\n\"Five hours!\" I interrupted. \"You do not know me! That much is hard to\nfind without running into the middle of the night, or into the middle of\nthe day--which is worse for a busy man. I have just five minutes to\nspare this afternoon, which will be quite time enough to tell me who you\nare and why you have sought me.\"\n\n\"You do not know me because you do not expect to see me on this\nhemisphere,\" he continued. \"Nor did I expect to find you a potent force\nin the commercial world, only three years after a literary and\nlinguistic preparation for a scholarly career. Why, the _m\u00e4dchens_ of\nHeidelberg have hardly had time to forget your tall, athletic figure, or\nceased wondering if you were really a Hebrew----\"\n\n\"You seem to be altogether familiar with my history,\" I put in with a\nlittle heat. \"Kindly enlighten me equally well as to your own.\"\n\n\"I gave you the pleasure of an additional year of residence at the\nUniversity of Heidelberg not long ago,\" he answered.\n\n\"I do not know how that can be, for to my uncle I owe my entire\neducation there.\"\n\n\"Perhaps an unappreciated trifle of it you owe to your instructors and\nlecturers. Do you forget that I refused to pass your examinations in\nphysics, and kept you there a year longer?\"\n\n\"You are not Doctor Anderwelt, then?\"\n\n\"Hermann Anderwelt, Ph.D., at your service, sir,\" he replied somewhat\nproudly.\n\n\"But when and why did you leave your chair at Heidelberg?\"\n\n\"It is to answer this that I ask the five hours,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"Oh, come now, doctor, you used to tell me more in a two-hour lecture\nthan I could remember in a week,\" I answered, taking off my overcoat,\nand touching an electric button at my desk. My office boy entered.\n\n\"Teddy, have I had lunch to-day?\" This was my favourite question on a\nbusy day, and Teddy always answered it seriously.\n\n\"No, sir, you have an engagement to lunch at the Standard Club,\" he\nreplied.\n\n\"Telephone to Gus at the Club that I can't come up to-day. Also send\nover to the Grand Pacific for a good lunch for two. Have some beer in\nit--real M\u00fcnchner, and in _steins_,\" I directed, and then I reclined on\na long leather lounge, and motioned to the doctor to have a chair. He\ndeclined, however, and walked slowly back and forth before me as he\ntalked, keeping his right hand inside his coat, and with the left he\noccasionally ploughed up his heavy hair, as if to ventilate his brain.\n\n\"A year ago I gave up theoretical physics for applied physics; I\nresigned my chair at Heidelberg, and came to this progressive city. I\nbrought with me a working model of the greatest invention of this\ninventive age. Yet it was then neither perfect in design nor complete in\ndetail. But now I have hit on the plan that makes it practicable and\ncertain of success. I need only a little money to build it, and the\nworld will open its eyes!\"\n\n\"But you must pardon me if instead of opening mine I shut them,\" I\ninterrupted, seeing the point quickly, and losing no time in dodging. \"I\nhave no money to invest in patent rights; but still, you must stay to\nlunch with me.\"\n\nJust here the doctor seemed to find it necessary to diverge from the\norderly course of his lecture as he had prepared it, and interject a few\nimpromptu observations.\n\n\"Events are difficult to forecast, but the capabilities of a youth are\nharder to divine. One educates his son in all the fine arts, and he\nturns out a founder of pig iron. One's nephew is apprenticed to a\nwatchmaker, and in a few years, behold, he is a great barrister. Your\nuncle educated you thoroughly in the old Hebrew and Chaldee of the\nrabbis, and, lo! you are now the _ursa major_ of the wheat market.\n\n\"Just now you are in the centre of the kaleidoscope of success. Slater,\nBawker & Co. were there a month ago, but now they are only bits of\nbroken glass in the bottom of the heap! And you? you are really a\ntwisted bit of coloured glass like the rest, but you chance to be thrown\nto the middle. The mirrors of public opinion multiply your importance\nhalf a dozen times, and behold you are reflected into the whole picture.\nBut the kaleidoscope turns, and the pieces of glass are shifted. Other\nbroken chips now at the bottom of the heap will soon be filling the\ncentre!\n\n\"Permit me to change my figure of speech. You are sweeping back the\nwaves of the sea while the tide is falling, and the wide-mouthed public\nlooks on, and whispers about that your broom makes all the waves obey,\nand drives them back at will. Just when you begin to believe it yourself\nthe tide may turn, and neither brooms nor all the powers on earth can\nthen sweep it back.\n\n\"Isidor Werner, you believe yourself rich; but your wealth is like\nmolasses in a sieve. If you do not dip in your finger and taste the\nsweet occasionally, you will have nothing to show for your pains in the\nend. I shall ask you for but a taste of the sweet now, so that I may\npreserve a little of it against that day which may come, when the sieve\nwill be bright and clean and empty again!\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in!\" I shouted. \"Nothing but this lunch can save me from your\neloquence. You have already ruined me in three similes!\"\n\nThe waiter arranged a bountiful and tempting luncheon on a writing\ntable. I commenced on it at once, but the doctor, though repeatedly\nurged, persistently refused. He took a long draught at a _stein_ of\nMunich beer, and continued:--\n\n\"My invention proposes to navigate the air and the ether beyond, as well\nas the interplanetary spaces,\" he said impressively.\n\n\"Flying machine, eh?\" I sneered, between bites of planked whitefish.\n\n\"Indeed no!\" he growled, as if he detested this name. \"My invention is\nnot a machine but a projectile. It is not self-propelling, because if it\ndepended upon its own propelling apparatus, it could not in thousands of\nyears navigate the interplanetary spaces. It is a _gravity projectile_,\nand will travel at a rate of speed almost incalculable. It does not fly,\nbut its manner of travelling is more nearly like falling.\"\n\nI gave the doctor a quick searching look to see if I could discover any\nsigns of incipient insanity. I met a firm, steady gaze; an earnest,\nconvincing look. Somehow, I felt there was something real and true and\nwonderful about to come from the great scholar before me, and that I\nmust hear it and hear it all; that I must lend a serious and thoughtful\nattention. My eyes were rivetted upon the doctor's for fully a minute in\nsilence.\n\n\"Go on,\" I said at last; \"I am all attention.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Gravity Projectile\n\n\nHermann Anderwelt had probably suffered many disappointments and waited\nlong for a hearing. Now he seemed to feel that his opportunity had come,\nfor he continued with growing enthusiasm:--\n\n\"Hitherto all attempts at space travelling have been too timid or\npuerile. We have experimented at aerial navigation, as if the brief span\nof air were a step in the mighty distance which separates us from our\nsister planets. As well might steamboats have been invented to cross\nnarrow streams, and never have ventured on the mighty ocean! We have\ntried to imitate the bird, the kite, and the balloon, and our\nexperiments have failed, and always must, so long as we do not look\nfarther and think deeper. Every Icarus who attempts to overcome the\nforce of gravity, which conquers planets, and propel himself through the\nair by any sort of apparatus, will always finish the trip with a wiser\nbut badly bruised head.\"\n\n\"Still, it has been freely predicted,\" I ventured, \"that this century\nwill not close without the invention of a successful air-travelling\nmachine.\"\n\n\"And I alone have hit upon the right plan, because I have not attempted\nto _struggle against_ gravity, but have made use of it only for\npropelling my projectile!\" exclaimed the doctor triumphantly.\n\n\"But wait!\" I interposed. \"Gravity acts only in one direction, and that\nis exactly opposite to the one you propose to travel.\"\n\n\"That brings me to the very important discovery I made in physics two\nyears ago, upon which the whole success of the projectile rests. You\nwill remember that, according to the text-books, very little is known\nabout gravity except the laws of its action. What it is, and how it can\nbe controlled or modified, have never been known. Electricity was as\nmuch a mystery fifty years ago, but we know all its attributes. We can\nmake it, store it, control it, and use it for almost every necessity of\nlife. The era of electricity is in full bloom, but the era of\ngravitational force is just budding.\"\n\n\"Can it be that we have as much to learn from gravity as electricity has\ntaught us in the last half-century?\" I exclaimed, as my eyes began to\nopen.\n\n\"I believe it will teach us far more wonderful things, because it will\ntake us to unknown worlds, while electricity has been confined to Earth.\nIts realm is the wide universe. It will show us what life there is on\nthe planets. It will make us at home with the stars.\n\n\"What!\" he continued in a sort of ecstasy. \"Do you think all great\ndiscoveries are over, all wonderful inventions made? As well might a\ntrembling child, elated with the success of its first feeble steps\nalone, suppose it had exhausted all the possibilities of life. We are\nbut spelling over the big letters on the title page of the primary book\nof knowledge. There be other pages and grander chapters further on.\nThere be greater volumes, and sweeter, more expressive tongues which man\nmay learn some day.\n\n\"Has a reasoning Divinity created the heavens and peopled the myriad\nstars with thinking, capable beings, who must be perpetually isolated?\nOr may they not know each other some time? But shall we attempt to sail\nthe vast heavens with a paper kite, or try to fly God's distances with\nthe wings of fluttering birds? Nay; we must use God's engine for such a\ntask. Has He tied the planets to the sun, and knitted the suns and their\nsystems into one great universe obedient to a single law, with no\npossibility that we may use that law for intercommunication? With what\nwings do the planets fly around the sun, and the suns move through the\nheavens? With the wings of gravity! The same force for minute satellite\nor mighty sun. It is God's omnipotence applied to matter. Let us fly\nwith that!\"\n\n\"But will you permit me to suggest that we are soaring before the\nprojectile is built?\" I put in.\n\n\"Quite right. Let us come back to Earth, and return to facts. My studies\nin physics led me to believe that all natural forces--gravity,\ncentrifugal force, and even capillary attraction--are, like electricity\nand magnetism, both positive and negative in their action. If they do\nnot normally alternate between a positive and negative current, as\nelectricity does, they can be made to do so. Gravity and capillary\nattraction, as we know them, always act positively; that is, they always\n_attract_. On the other hand, centrifugal force always acts negatively;\nthat is, it always _repels_. But each of these forces, I believe, can\ntemporarily be made to act opposite to its usual manner. I know this to\nbe the case with gravity, for I have caused its positive and negative\ncurrents to alternate; that is, I have made it repel and then attract,\nand so on, at will, by changing the polarity of the body which it acts\nupon.\"\n\n\"Now that I remember it,\" I added, \"our original ideas of magnetism were\nthat it simply attracted. We knew the lodestone drew the steel, but only\non better acquaintance did we learn of its alternating currents,\nattractive and repellant.\"\n\n\"I have positively demonstrated with my working model that I can reverse\nthe force of gravity acting upon the model, and make it sail away into\nspace. I will show you this whenever you like. It is so arranged that\nthe polarizing action ceases in three minutes, after which the positive\ncurrent controls, and the model falls to the Earth again.\"\n\n\"But have you ever attempted a trip yet?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Oh, no. The model was not built to carry me, but it has demonstrated\nall the important facts, and I now need ten thousand dollars to build\none large enough to carry several persons, and to equip it with\neverything necessary to make a trip to one of the planets. With a man\ninside to control the currents, it will be far more easily managed than\nthe experimental model has been.\"\n\n\"Suppose you had the projectile built, and everything was ready for a\nstart,\" I said, \"what would be the method of working it?\"\n\n\"I should enter the forward compartment,\" began the doctor.\n\n\"But would you make the trial trip yourself?\"\n\n\"I certainly would not trust the secret of operating the currents to any\none else,\" he remarked, with emphasis. \"And will you accompany me in the\nrear compartment?\"\n\n\"No, indeed; unless you will promise to return in time for the following\nday's market,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then I shall engage some adventurous fellow as assistant. First, we\nmust set the rudder, which is both horizontal and vertical, so that the\nprojectile can be steered up, down, or to either side. Having fixed it\nso as to be directed a little upward, I begin with the currents.\nSuppose the projectile weighs a ton, I gradually neutralize the positive\ncurrent, which we are acquainted with as gravity. When it is exactly\nneutralized, the projectile weighs nothing, and the pressure of the air\nis enough to make it rise more rapidly than a balloon. When I have\ncreated a negative current, the projectile acquires a buoyancy equal to\nits previous weight. That is, it will now _fall up_ as rapidly as it\nwould previously have fallen down. It will not do to put on the full\nnegative current at once, for we should acquire a velocity that would\nsimply burn us up by friction with the atmosphere. However, the air is\nsoon passed; if in the ether beyond there is very little friction, or\nnone at all, we shall go at full speed, which will be the constantly\nincreasing velocity of a falling body.\n\n\"Somewhere between the Earth and the nearest planet,\" he continued,\n\"there is a place where the attraction of one is just equal to the\nattraction of the other; and if a body is stopped in that fatal spot it\nwill be anchored there for ever, by the equally matched forces tugging\nin opposite directions. There is such a dead line between all the\nplanets, and our principal danger lies in falling into one of these, for\nwe should remain there a twinkling star throughout eternity! We must\ntrust to our momentum to carry us past this point, and into space where\nthe gravitational attraction of the other planet is paramount. Then we\nmust promptly change our current from negative to positive, so that the\nother planet will attract us to her. Otherwise, she would repel us back\nto the dead line.\n\n\"With a positive current we are now literally falling into the new\nplanet. We need not land unless we wish, for as soon as we enter a\nresisting atmosphere we can steer a course lacking barely a quarter of\nbeing directly away from the planet, just as you can sail a boat three\nquarters against the wind.\"\n\n\"But suppose you experiment at making a landing on this new planet?\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Very well. Of course, as soon as we enter an atmosphere, it behoves us\nto travel slowly to avoid overheating. We can still safely travel\nseveral hundred miles an hour, however. We continue falling until rather\nnear the planet; then, turning the rudder gently down, we can sail\naround and around the planet until we choose our landing place. Gently\nreversing currents, a mild negative one soon overcomes our momentum.\nTempering our currents experimentally to the pressure of the air, we\ncan, if we desire, float like a feather and be wafted with every breeze.\nJust a suspicion of a positive current brings us gently to the surface,\nand, when we have cooled, we unscrew the rear port-hole and crawl out to\nexplore a new world.\"\n\nI had mentally made the trip, and was not only intensely interested, but\ninfinitely pleased. I was lost for some time with my imagination on the\nnew sphere, but presently my mind returned to the practical side of the\nquestion, and I inquired,--\n\n\"Are you quite sure that ten thousand dollars will be sufficient to\nbuild and fully equip the projectile?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite certain,\" he answered with decision. \"It will be ample for\nthat and for the expenses of forming a corporation to own my patents and\nexploit the invention. It is easy to see the projectile will be cheap of\nconstruction. No machinery is necessary; no strong building to withstand\nenormous shocks or anything of that kind. The principal expenditures\nwill be for stores of food and for scientific and astronomical\ninstruments. Of course, I wish to show you my working model and my plans\nfor the practical projectile, and to explain to you many further\ndetails.\"\n\nIt was growing dark. I arose, turned on the electric light, and rang my\nbell. The office boy entered.\n\n\"Teddy, tell all the boys they may go, except Flynn. Ask him to wait,\nplease.\"\n\nI was quite used to making ten thousand dollar bargains in a few seconds\nof time and without the scratch of a pen. I had risked more money than\nthat on the fact that Slater looked worried and Bawker was very cross\nwhen at his office, and it had won immensely. But here, what a prospect,\nwhat a far-reaching, all-encircling prospect it was! No time was to be\nlost; besides, there was pleasure to me in driving a good bargain and\ndriving it quickly.\n\n\"And if I give you the ten thousand dollars, what do I get in return?\" I\nasked, mentally placing my part at fifty-five per cent. of the shares at\nthe lowest, so that I might control the company.\n\n\"You may organize the corporation yourself. The projectile must bear my\nname, and I must have the credit for all discoveries and inventions.\nThen you may give me such a part of the shares of the company as you\nthink right,\" he replied.\n\nOn hearing this, I mentally advanced my portion to seventy-five per\ncent. Then I said,--\n\n\"When the projectile is built and proves successful, who is to manage\nthe affairs of the company? Who is to finance it and raise further funds\nfor exploiting its business?\"\n\n\"I have no capacity for business,\" he declared. \"I have no ambition to\nbe a Pullman or an Edison. I would rather see myself a Franklin or a\nFulton. You shall manage all the business affairs.\"\n\n\"Then I will undertake the whole matter, and give you my cheque for ten\nthousand dollars to-night, provided you allow me--ninety-five per cent.\nof the company's shares!\" I said, simulating a burst of generosity.\n\nDoctor Anderwelt ploughed his hair and harrowed his beard. He knew this\nwas giving too much, but to have the projectile built, to sail away, to\nmake all those grand new discoveries, to write books, and have future\ngenerations pronounce his name reverently along with Kepler and Newton!\nI did not believe he would have the courage to say no. While he\nmeditated, my bell summoned Flynn.\n\n\"Please draw a cheque for ten thousand dollars to the order of Hermann\nAnderwelt,\" I said, watching the doctor as I spoke. There was indecision\nin his face.\n\n\"Suppose I allow you, say, ninety per cent.?\" he said at last.\n\nI was signing the cheque Flynn had brought me. \"Done!\" I cried, handing\nit over. He scanned it carefully, and after a long time said,--\n\n\"Mars is nearest to the Earth on the third day of next August.\nFortunately Chicago is a good place to do things in a hurry. The\nprojectile must be ready to start early in June, but its construction\nand its first trip must be kept a profound secret.\"\n\nThe doctor must have been hungry since noon. He began munching a chicken\nsandwich. The cold planked whitefish tasted quite as good as smoked\nherrings, perhaps, and strawberry short-cake in March was a luxury which\nhe evidently appreciated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nStructure of the Projectile\n\n\nA few weeks later I received a letter from Dr. Anderwelt asking me to\ncall at his rooms on the West Side that afternoon, as soon as the market\nhad closed. He desired to exhibit and explain the drawings of the new\nprojectile and talk over the preparations for the trip. I had been so\nengrossed with every sort of worry that I had thought but little of the\ndoctor and his grand schemes of late. But now I was anxious to know what\nprogress he was making. Sometimes I felt that I had been foolish to put\nany money into the thing; but the doctor's idea of reversing gravity was\nso simple and so elemental, that I marvelled it had never occurred to\nscientists before.\n\nAfter the market I hunted up the street and number the doctor had given\nme, and found a little, dingy boarding-house, lost among machine shops\nand implement factories, near the west side of the river. In a\nthird-floor back room, with one small window looking out on dark, sooty\nbuildings and belching chimneys, Dr. Anderwelt was thinking out all the\nincidental problems, and preparing for all the emergencies that might\narise on a trip of some forty million miles, through unknown space, to a\nstrange planet whose composition was unguessed.\n\nThe walls of the room were soiled and bare, except for blue-prints of\ndrawings from which the projectile was being built in neighbouring\nfoundries. There were but two plain, hard chairs in the room. The doctor\nsat on one with a pillow doubled up under him for a cushion. He was\nbending over a draughting board, which was propped up on the bed during\nthe day and went under it at night.\n\nThree flights of steep stairs had taken my breath, and I dropped into\nthe other hard chair and exclaimed,--\n\n\"I say, Doctor, why didn't you take an office in the twelfth heaven of a\nmodern office building over in town, where they have elevators? I have\nreally forgotten how to climb stairs. Didn't I furnish you money enough\nto do this thing right?\"\n\n\"Don't you think this is a good place?\" he inquired in some surprise.\n\"The rent is cheap, and it is convenient to the work. But speaking of\nelevators, we are going to revolutionize all that. No more hoisting or\nhydraulic lifts after we apply our ideas to the lifting of these\nelevator cages!\"\n\n\"I am afraid this idea of negative gravity is apt to revolutionize\neverything, and generally upset the entire universe,\" I replied. \"I\nhave been wondering what would happen if you were to apply a negative\ncurrent to this Earth of ours and send it whirling out of its orbit, an\nostracised Pariah, repelled by all the celestial bodies!\"\n\n\"Not the slightest danger of any such calamity,\" he answered. \"The\nreversal of polarity can only be accomplished with comparatively small\nand insignificant masses. It would be impossible to impart a negative\ncondition even to the smallest satellite. Our projectile will weigh but\na few thousand pounds, compared to the millions of tons of the smallest\ncelestial bodies. The Creator has looked out for the stability of the\nuniverse, never fear for that! And He has also given us a few hints of\nnegative currents and repellant gravities in the form of meteorites and\nfalling stars, which cannot be so well explained by any other theory.\nBut what I want to talk to you about is the vital importance of\nproviding against every possible emergency before starting on this trip\nthrough space. A trifling oversight in the preparations may mean death\nin the end, and things we put no value on here we might be willing to\ngive a fortune for on Mars!\"\n\n\"Well, let's hear how this thing is built,\" I said, rising and facing\nthe larger blue-print. \"So that's the shape of it, is it? Looks like a\ncigar!\"\n\n\"Yes, the design resembles that of a torpedo considerably,\" replied the\ndoctor, and referring to the sectional blue-print he began explaining\nthe construction.\n\n\"This outer covering is a crust of graphite or black lead, inside which\nis a two-inch layer of asbestos. Both of these resist enormous heats,\nand they will prevent our burning by friction with atmospheres, and\nprotect us against extremes of cold. Also, when we are ready, they will\nenable us to visit planets about whose cooled condition we are not\ncertain. We might touch safely for a short time on a molten planet with\nthis covering.\n\n\"Next comes the general outer framework of steel, just within which, and\ncompletely surrounding the living compartments, are the chambers for the\nstorage of condensed air for use on the trip. These chambers are lined\ninside with another layer of asbestos. Now, air being a comparatively\npoor conductor of heat, and asbestos one of the best non-conductors we\nknow of, this insures a stable temperature of the living compartments,\nregardless of the condition without, whether of extreme heat or extreme\ncold. Afterward comes the inner framework of steel, and lastly a\nwainscotting of hard wood to give the compartments a finish.\"\n\n\"How large are these living rooms?\" I inquired.\n\n\"The rear one is four feet high and eight feet long. The forward one,\ndesigned for my own use, is longer, and must contain a good-size\ntelescope and all my scientific instruments. The apparatus with which I\nproduce the currents is built into the left wall, and it acts on the\nsteel work of the projectile only. The rear compartment has a sideboard\nfor preparing meals, which will have to be wholly of bread, biscuits,\nand various tinned vegetables and meats. We shall not attempt any\ncooking.\"\n\n\"But are there no windows for looking out?\" I queried.\n\n\"Certainly, there are two of them, made of thick mica. One is directly\nin the front end, through which my telescope will look. The other is in\nthe port-hole in the rear end. Each window is provided with an outer\nshutter of asbestos, which can be closed in case of great heat or cold.\nYou will notice the two compartments can be separated by an air-tight\nplunger, fitting into the aperture between them. It will be necessary\nfor both of us to occupy the same compartment while the air is being\nchanged in the other. The foul air will be forced outside by a powerful\npump until a partial vacuum is created. Then a certain measure of\ncondensed air is emptied in, and expands until the barometer in that\ncompartment indicates a proper pressure.\"\n\n\"The air will be made to order while you wait, then?\" I put in.\n\n\"That is exactly what will be done in a more literal manner than you may\nsuppose!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"This air problem is a most interesting\none, for we must educate ourselves on the trip to use the sort of\natmosphere we expect to find when we land. For instance, going to Mars\nwe must use an atmosphere more and more rarefied each day, until\ngradually we become used to the thin air we expect to find there. Of\ncourse, there is an especially designed barometer and thermometer,\ncapable of being read in the rear compartment, but exposed outside near\nthe rudder. The barometer will give us the pressure of the earthly\natmosphere as it becomes more and more rare with our ascent. It will\nshow us what pressure there is of the ether, which may vary\nconsiderably, depending on our nearness to heavenly bodies. It will also\nimmediately indicate to us when we are entering any new atmosphere. When\nwe have arrived at Mars, we shall observe the exact pressure of the\nMartian air, and then manufacture one of the same pressure inside, and\ntry breathing it before we venture out. The thermometer will give us the\ntemperature of the ether, will indicate the loss of heat as we leave the\nsun, and will show us the Martian temperature before we venture into\nit.\"\n\n\"But you have said the condensed air will be used to resist the outer\nheat. This will certainly make it so hot it will be unfit to breathe,\" I\ninterposed.\n\n\"Ah, but you forget that the quick expansion of a gaslike air produces\ncold. We shall regulate our temperature in that way. If it is becoming\ntoo warm inside, the new measure of condensed air will be quickly\nintroduced into the partial vacuum, and its sudden expansion will\nproduce great cold, and freeze ice for us if we wish it. On the other\nhand, if the compartments are already cold, we shall allow the condensed\nair to enter very gradually, and its slow expansion will produce but\nlittle cold. The question of heating the projectile is the most\ndifficult one I have found. We cannot have any fires, for there is no\nway for the smoke to escape, and we cannot carry oxygen enough to keep\nthem burning. I have decided that we must depend on the heat arising\nfrom outer friction and from absorption of the Sun's rays by our black\nsurface. When we are in ether where friction is very little, the\nvelocity will be all the greater, and I believe we shall always be warm\nenough. You must remember, we shall not have the slightest suspicion of\na draught, and we must necessarily take along the warmest clothing for\nuse on Mars. Even then we probably cannot safely visit any but his\nequatorial districts.\"\n\n\"This is the rudder, I suppose; but haven't you put it in wrong end\nfirst?\" I asked. \"It is just the opposite of a fish's tail. You have the\nwidened end near the projectile and the narrow end extending.\"\n\n\"Yes, and with good reason. You will note that the rudder slides into\nthe rear end of the projectile so that none of it extends out. This is a\nvariable steering apparatus, adapted to every sort of atmosphere.\nNaturally, a rudder that would steer in the water, might not steer the\nsame craft in the air. There is probably a vaster difference between air\nand ether than between water and air. It is necessary, therefore, to\nhave a small rudder with but little extending surface in thick\natmosphere; but when it becomes thinner the rudder must be pushed out,\nso that a greater surface will offer resistance. When we start, the\nsmallest portion of this rudder moved but the sixteenth of an inch, up,\ndown, or to either side, will quickly change our course correspondingly.\nWhen we have reached the ether, the full surface of the rudder pushed\nout and exposed broadside may not have much effect in changing our\ncourse. This is one of the things that we cannot possibly know till we\ntry. However, if ether is anything at all but a name, if it is the\nthinnest, lightest conceivable gas, and we are rushing through it at a\nspeed of a thousand miles a minute, our rudder certainly should have\nsome effect.\"\n\n\"But suppose you cannot steer at all in the ether, what then?\" I\ninterposed, hunting all the trouble possible.\n\n\"Even that will not be so very dreadful, provided we have taken a true\ncourse for Mars while coming through the Earth's atmosphere. There is no\nother planet or star nearer to us than Mars when in opposition.\nTherefore there will be nothing to attract us out of our correct course;\nand if we can manage to come anywhere near the true course, the\ngravitational attraction of Mars will draw us to him in a straight line.\nThe Moon might give us some trouble, and we shall be obliged, either to\navoid her entirely by starting so as to cross her orbit when she is on\nthe opposite side of the Earth, or else go directly to the Moon, land\nthere, and make a new start. But if the ether which surrounds the Moon\n(for she has no atmosphere so far as we know) has no resisting power\nwhatever, we might have rather a difficult time there. The only thing we\ncould do would be to land on the side toward the Earth, then disembark\nand carry the projectile on our shoulders around the Moon to the\nopposite side, making a new start from there!\"\n\n\"What on earth do you mean?\" I exclaimed, interrupting. \"Land on a\nsatellite which has no atmosphere, and carry this projectile, weighing\nover a ton, half-way around the globe?\"\n\n\"But the point is, it isn't on the Earth, but on the Moon! Think it over\na little, and see how easily we could do it now. In the first place, we\nshall always carry divers' suits and helmets, to use in going ashore on\nplanets having no atmosphere. Air will be furnished through tubes from\ninside the compartments. In the second place, the projectile in its\nnatural state will hardly weigh two hundred pounds on the Moon, since\nthe mass of that satellite is so much less than the Earth's, and weight\ntherefore proportionately less. But you must remember I can make the\nprojectile weigh nothing at all, so one of us could run ahead and tow\nit, as a child would play with its toy balloon.\"\n\n\"I perceive you have already made this trip several times, and are quite\nfamiliar with everything. But in case the Moon's surface is not suitable\nfor foot passengers, what then? I understand it to be rough, jagged,\nmountainous, and even crossed by immense, yawning, unbridged fissures.\"\n\n\"That is most likely true, and for that reason we must carry a jointed\npunt-pole, and take turns standing on the back, landing and punting\nalong through space just above the surface. Do you remember how far you\ncan send a slightly shrunk toy balloon with one light blow? And how it\nfinally stops with the resistance of the air? Without any resisting\natmosphere, how far and how easily could it be sent along?\"\n\n\"I can quite imagine you, astride the rudder of this thing, with a\npunt-pole as long as a ship's mast and as light as a broom-straw,\nbumping and skipping along in the utter darkness on the other side of\nthe Moon; scaling mountains, bridging yawning chasms, and skimming over\nsombre sea-beds!\" I laughed, for it aroused my active sense of the\nridiculous.\n\n\"And the Moon may be well worth the exploration,\" exclaimed the always\nserious doctor. \"Who knows what treasure of gold and silver, or other\nmetals, rare and precious here, may not be found there? Why was the Moon\never created without an atmosphere, and therefore probably without the\npossibility of ever being inhabited? Is it put there only to illume our\nnights? Remember, we do the same service for her fourteen times as well;\nand if she has inhabitants they may think the Earth exists only for that\npurpose. Is it not more reasonable to suppose that some vast treasures\nare there, which the Earth will some day be in pressing need of? That it\nis a great warehouse of earthly necessities, which will be discovered\njust as they are being exhausted here? And who knows but _we_ may be the\ndiscoverers ourselves? If the satellite is uninhabited, it will belong\nto the first explorers. Its treasures may be ours! We shall at least\nhave a monopoly on the only known method of getting there and bringing\nthem away.\"\n\n\"Ah! now you tempt me to go with you,\" I said, in a mild excitement.\n\"Now I see myself, erect on the rudder, a new Count of Monte Cristo,\nwaving the long punt-pole majestically, and exclaiming, '_The Moon is\nmine!_'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWhat is on Mars?\n\n\n\"I only wish you _would_ come along with me,\" replied the doctor. \"I\nhave no idea what intelligent, educated person I can persuade to\naccompany me, unless he is given an interest in the discoveries. You are\nthe person most interested in the enterprise, and you should go. If it\nis money-making that detains you here, you may rest assured that we\nshall find fortunes for both of us somewhere.\"\n\n\"I am a slave to the excitement of my business,\" I answered. \"I could\nnot possibly spend two or three months in a lonely cell, flying through\nspace, without a ticker or a quotation of the market. Besides, there are\npeople on the earth I should not care to leave, unless I was certain of\ngetting back soon.\"\n\n\"You may be sure of excitement enough, and of a continuously novel kind.\nBesides, of what interest are the people of this earth, who are all\nalike, and whom we have known all our lives, compared with the rapture\nof finding a new and different race, of investigating another\ncivilization, and exploring an entire new world?\"\n\n\"I shall have to warn my friends about you and have myself watched, lest\nyou persuade me and run away with me when the time comes. If your\nadventures are half as exciting and varied as your theories, I should\nhate to miss them. But tell me why you have chosen Mars for a first\nvisit.\"\n\n\"Because of all the planets he is the one which most resembles the Earth\nin all the essential conditions of life. He is the Earth's little\nbrother, situated next farther out in the path from the Sun. He has the\nsame seasons, day and night of the same length, and zones of about the\nsame extent. He possesses air, water, and sufficient heat to make\nhabitation by us quite possible. Moreover, his gravity problem will not\nput earthly visitors at a disadvantage, as it would on the very large\nplanets, but rather at a distinct advantage over the Martians.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to find on Mars?\" I queried.\n\n\"That is a very comprehensive question, and any answer is the merest\nguess-work, guided by a few known facts,\" replied the doctor. \"The\nprincipal controlling fact is the reduced gravitational attraction of\nMars, which will make things weigh about one-third as much as on the\nEarth. The air will be far less dense than here. In the mineral kingdom\nthe dense metals will be very rare. I doubt if platinum will be found at\nall; gold and silver very little; iron, lead, and copper will be\ncomparatively scarce, while aluminium may be the common and useful\nmetal. Gases should abound, and doubtless many entirely new to us will\nbe there. It is not unlikely that many of these will serve as foods for\nthe animals and intelligent beings. It is also quite possible that the\nheavier gases may run in channels, like rivers, and be alive with winged\nfish and chameleons.\"\n\n\"How about vegetation?\" I suggested.\n\n\"The vegetable kingdom will certainly not be rank and luxurious, because\nthere is not enough sunlight or heat for that; nor will it be gnarled\nand tough, but more likely spongy and cactus-like. The weak gravity will\noppose but a mild resistance to the activity and climbing propensities\nof vegetable sap, however, which is likely to result in very tall,\nslender trees. The forces that lie hidden in an acorn should be able to\nbuild a most grandly towering oak on Mars. Among the animals the species\nof upright, two-legged things is apt to abound. There is no reason for\nfour legs when the body weighs but little. On the Earth an extremely\nstrong development of the lower limbs is necessary for upright things,\nas is shown in the cases of kangaroos and men. In order that a cow might\ngo comfortably on two legs, she would have to be furnished with the\nhind-legs of an elephant; but not so on Mars. Creeping things would be\nvery few, and it is possible that fish may fly in the water with a short\npair of wings. What four-legged animals there are will very likely be\nlarge and monstrous; for an enormous animal could exist comfortably and\nmove about easily without clumsiness. For instance, an earthly elephant\ntransferred to Mars would weigh only one-third as much, and so there\nmight well be elephants three times as large as ours, perfectly able to\nhandle themselves with ease.\"\n\n\"By the same reasoning then, I suppose the intelligent beings, or what\nwe call men, will be great giants twenty-five feet high?\" I put in.\n\n\"Some have thought so, but I do not at all agree with them,\" replied the\ndoctor. \"I stick to the theory of small men for small planets, and large\nmen for large planets. There is no possible reason for a large man on\nMars, where muscular development is uncalled for and useless, and where\nthe inhabitable space is small. If there are men on Jupiter, they must\nof necessity be enormously strong to hold themselves up and resist\ngravitation. If they walk upright (which I think unlikely), their legs\nmust be very large and as solid as iron. The Martian legs are likely to\nbe small and puny, and I believe the upper limbs will be much more\nstrongly developed. In fact, on Mars the Creator had His one great\nopportunity of making a _flying man_, and I do not think He has\noverlooked it. With a rather small, tightly-knit frame, and the upper\nlimbs developed into wings as long as the body, flying against the weak\nMartian gravitation would be perfectly easy, and a vast advantage over\nwalking.\"\n\n\"Ah! then perhaps they will fly out to meet you!\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"If they do, they will be stricken with fear to see that we fly without\nwings and so much more rapidly,\" he answered, and continued: \"If a\nflying race has been created there, we shall probably find the\natmosphere deeper and relatively (though not actually) denser than the\nEarth's. This would serve to add buoyancy and still further diminish\nweight, thus making flying quite natural and simple. I certainly do not\nbelieve that the Martians are subjected to the tedium of walking. If\nthey do not fly, they will at least make long, swift, graceful hops or\njumps of some ten or fifteen feet each. This would require a more hinged\ndevelopment of the lower limbs, like a bird's. It is also possible that\nthe lower limbs may have the prehensile function, and do all the\nhandling and working.\"\n\n\"But how about intelligence and intellectual development? That is the\nmain thing, after all,\" said I.\n\n\"To answer that takes one into the realm of pure speculation. There are\nbut few facts to guide one's guesses. But the trip yonder is worth\nmaking, if only to learn that. I do not incline to the opinion that\ntheir civilization is vastly older and more developed than ours.\nGranting the nebular theory of the origin of the universe (which is,\nafter all, only a guess), it is not even then certain that Mars was\nthrown off the central sun before the Earth. It is much smaller, and may\nhave been thrown off later and travelled farther for this reason.\nAnother good reason for believing in a less advanced civilization is the\nlength of the Martian year and consequent sluggishness of the seasons.\nHe requires 687 of our days to complete his sun revolution, making his\nyears nearly twice as long as ours. I believe his whole development is\nat a correspondingly slow rate of speed.\"\n\n\"Which do you think is the most advanced and enlightened planet, then?\"\nI ventured.\n\n\"That one which finds a way to visit the others first,\" he answered,\nwith a touch of pride.\n\n\"But there may be a tinge of personal conceit in that idea,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Possibly a mere tinge, but the essence of it is apparent truth,\" he\ndeclared. \"That planet which has learned the most, made the greatest\ndiscoveries and the most useful inventions, is the best and fittest\nteacher of the others, and will be the sharpest and keenest to gather\nnew information and formulate new science. It is eminently fit that\nrepresentatives of such a planet should visit the others, and eminently\nunfit that any primitive civilization engaged in base wars and striving\nfor mere conquest should be allowed that privilege. An all-wise Creator\nwould not permit a huge, strong, ignorant race entirely to overrun and\nextinguish one weaker but more intelligent. He might permit a strong,\nintelligent, masterful race to rule and direct a weaker and dependent\none, as a schoolmaster rules and guides a child.\"\n\n\"Then you think we are the wise and masterful race?\"\n\n\"As no other race has yet discovered us; as they have all left the Space\nProblem unsolved, and as it has been uncovered to us, that is my\nirresistible conclusion.\"\n\n\"Still, you will not go with ideas of conquest, but to teach and to\nlearn?\"\n\n\"We shall take with us swords, shields, and fire-arms, for defence.\nUnless I mistake the nature of their metals, our steel will resist any\nweapon they can manufacture. But what explosives or what noxious gases\nthey may have, all strange to us, it is impossible to conjecture.\nTherefore, we shall go with peace in our hands.\"\n\n\"What progress do you think they have made in inventions?\" I suggested,\nas the doctor hesitated.\n\n\"If they are winged men, I should say they have never felt that urgent\nneed of railroads, steam boats, telegraphs and telephones, which was the\nmother of their invention here. Flying or air-travelling machines will\nno more have occurred to them than a walking machine to us. They will\nhave thoroughly explored every part of their planet, and it is possible\nthat their cities will have been built on high plateaus, or even on\nmountain peaks. But they will not have builded greatly, for they will\nhave been able to use the great architecture of nature in a way\nimpossible to us.\"\n\n\"Have you heard the theory advanced by some humorous scientist not long\nago, that the organs of locomotion and prehension would some day, or on\nsome planet, be supplanted by machinery, and that digestive apparatus\nwould give way for artificially prepared blood?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes, that fanciful idea is novel, but irrational. It makes man only\na fraction of a being. On every planet, no matter what the advancement\nof civilization, we shall find _complete beings_, not dependent on\nadventitious machinery for locomotion or labour, or on artificial or\nanimal blood for nutriment. Think how helpless such a creature would be\nat the loss or rusting of his machinery, and at the exhaustion of just\nthe right sort of nutritive fluid. Our digestive apparatus will convert\na thousand different foods into blood. Suppose we could live only on\nbuffalo meat? We should all have been dead long ago. We might as well\nimagine men as mere fungus brains, swimming in rivers of blood; or as\nbeings beyond the necessity of personal thought, and living on brain\nsandwiches, cut from the thinking heads of others. Eating is not only a\nnecessity, but a pleasure----\"\n\n\"That is just what I was thinking,\" I interposed, looking at my watch,\nfor it was growing late.\n\n\"Well, now I have told you how I would have peopled Mars had the order\nbeen sent to me here to do it,\" said the doctor, \"will you go along with\nme, and see how nearly I am right?\"\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" I replied; \"my business ties forbid. However, I want\nto see you make the start and the moment you return!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFinal Preparations\n\n\nOn the tenth day of June, Dr. Anderwelt had written me as follows:\n\n    \"Please catch the 7.25 train on the Lake Shore for Whiting this\n    evening. I will take the same train, and we will walk from Whiting\n    to a deserted railway siding two miles further on, where the\n    projectile has been shipped. We will unload it from the flat car and\n    take it into a grove of scrub oaks on the shore of Lake Michigan,\n    near by. This will be enough to demonstrate to you our control of\n    gravity. The experimental model is there also, and we will send it\n    off on a trip if you like. Everything will be ready for the start to\n    Mars to-morrow night.\"\n\nI dined early and caught the train specified at Twenty-Second Street.\nThe doctor was looking for me from the rear platform of a car. It was a\nlocal train, and crept slowly out through the smoky blackness of South\nChicago, illuminated here and there by the flaming chimneys of her great\niron furnaces, to the little city of pungent smells, of petroleum tanks\nand oil refineries, in Northern Indiana. The doctor was explaining the\ndifficulties he had experienced in getting a companion for the trip.\n\n\"Men whom I could hire for mere wages are not intelligent enough to\nunderstand the workings of the projectile, or to comprehend the risks\nthey may run. Besides, their companionship and assistance during the\ntrip through space and on a new planet is worth nothing. On the other\nhand, I could not afford to go about explaining the workings of so\nimportant an invention miscellaneously to people capable of\nunderstanding it in an experimental search for a companion. I might not\nfind one among twenty, and I would be tossing my secrets to the winds,\nand inviting all the daily papers to send their representatives to\nreport the start. My reputation as a scientist, on the other side, is\ntoo dear to me to risk a public failure. If the projectile acts, as I am\nconfident it must, on our return we shall take out letters patent and\nform our company to exploit the business features. But primarily, this\nis a test of the projectile and a journey of exploration and research.\nBusiness afterward.\"\n\nNaturally on this point we had disagreed. My motto had always been\n\"Business first!\" and I had desired to have the patents secured\nimmediately. But the doctor would not consent to the filing of the\nrequired specifications and claims, lest his secrets should be learned\nbefore success was demonstrated. As a compromise, the doctor had agreed\nto leave the necessary descriptions and data in a sealed envelope with\nme, which I was to be at liberty to open and place on record at any time\nduring the doctor's absence that I might deem it necessary in order to\nprotect our rights.\n\n\"Whom have you finally secured to go with you, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"I will tell you that after we have finished to-night's work,\" said the\ndoctor, and then abruptly changed the subject.\n\nThe walk from Whiting was inspiriting. It was a beautiful night. There\nwas not a cloud in the sky and no Moon, which made the stars all the\nbrighter. Everything was still, save the constant lapping of the great\nlake on the sandy shore, but a short way off.\n\n\"Yonder is the mustard seed planted in the heavens, which shall grow\ninto a whole new world for us!\" exclaimed the doctor, pointing out a\nparticularly bright star. \"That is Mars rushing on to opposition. In six\nweeks he will be nearest to the Earth; so for that time he will be\nflying to meet us. To-morrow is our last day on Earth; to-morrow night\nthe ether! And in six weeks, diminutive but mighty man will have known\ntwo worlds!\"\n\n\"There you go, soaring again!\" I cried. \"Let us keep on practical\nsubjects. What have the foundry people who built this thing, and the\nrailroad people who brought it down here, thought about its probable\nuse? Have they not guessed something?\"\n\n\"You may trust the popular mind not to guess flying unless it sees\nwings! They have imagined this is a new sort of torpedo, sent down here\nfor a private trial in the lake. In fact, the conductor of the freight\ntrain, who switched the car off here, asked me in a confidential way if\nhe should get teams and men and help me to launch her? I have fostered\nthis idea, and really had the projectile sent here to carry out that\nimpression.\"\n\nA more fitting place for an unobserved start could not have been\nselected, however. All this part of the country is a sandy waste, with a\nsparse growth of scrub oaks and but little vegetation. There are no\nfarms, and the nearest houses are at Whiting. No one could see our work,\nexcept, possibly, the passengers from occasional trains, which rushed by\nwithout stopping, and were infrequent at this time of day.\n\nAs we were arriving, I stood off at some distance to observe the black\nobject on the open car. It was five feet through, and twenty feet long,\nnot counting the rudder, which was now entirely drawn into the rear end.\n\n\"Looks exactly like a cigar,\" I said. \"Sharp and pointed in front,\nslightly swelled in the middle, and cut squarely off behind. Only it is\ntoo thick for its length, of course.\"\n\nBut the doctor already had the rear port-hole open. This was two feet in\ndiameter, and permitted a rather awkward entrance to the rear\ncompartment. The interior was crowded with boxes, as yet unpacked,\ncontaining scientific instruments, tinned foods, biscuits, meat\nextracts, condensed milk and coffee, bottled fruits, vegetables, and the\nlike. Over these the doctor worked his way to the forward compartment,\nwhile I followed him, anxious to explore the interior.\n\n\"I will unpack all these goods and put them in their places to-morrow\nforenoon,\" explained the doctor. \"Here, in my compartment on the left, I\nhave my gravity apparatus, battery cells and the like, and a small table\nfor writing and other work. On the right is the bunk on which I sleep,\nand under it is the big telescope, neatly fitted and swinging up easily\ninto place before the mica window.\"\n\n\"Has the compressed air been put in yet?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Oh, yes, that had to be done in the city, where they have powerful air\ncompressors. I would have preferred this purer air out here, but it was\nimpossible. The air we put in only increased the weight of the\nprojectile eighteen pounds, but it will be sufficient for two of us for\nsix months. We were obliged to make the most careful and thorough tests\nfor leaks in the air-chambers; for if there were any of these, our life\nwould leak out with the air.\"\n\n\"And such airless satellites as the Moon will make the most desperate\nefforts to steal your atmosphere, too!\" I added.\n\n\"Yes, but we will give them only our foul air as a small stock-in-trade\nwith which they may begin business. But I see my batteries are\ncommencing to work nicely. I think I can lift her now. You go outside\nand make a hitch with that rope you saw just forward of the middle of\nthe projectile. Then, when I have neutralized her weight, you tow her\nover beyond that clump of trees you saw near the shore. That will be out\nof the view of trains.\"\n\n\"Must I concentrate my mind or keep my thoughts fixed on anything?\" I\nasked quizzically.\n\n\"Rubbish! Concentrate it on this. If the projectile starts up, don't try\nto hold her with your little rope. Let go quickly, or you may get\nuncomfortable holding on!\"\n\nI went outside, untied the coil of rope and threw one end over. Meantime\nthe doctor had opened the forward window, so that he might give\ndirections, and I said to him,--\n\n\"I can't get the rope under her; she is lying flat on the car.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment and I will lift her for you,\" he replied. The railroad\nties rose a little out of the sand, and there was a slight creaking of\nthe woodwork of the car as the weight came off. Presently the forward\nend of the projectile rose slowly an inch, two inches!\n\n\"That's enough!\" I cried, thrusting the rope under, and she settled back\ngently. Having made my knot, I went out to the other end of the rope,\nabout thirty feet distant. Forgetting the doctor's injunction about not\nhanging on, I wrapped the rope around my body, worked my feet firmly\ninto the sand, and finally cried out, \"All ready!\"\n\nThere was a faint creaking of the car again, and soon the doctor said,\n\"Pull away!\" I threw all my force into the effort and gave a tremendous\nheave, and tumbled over backwards. Had I not done so, the projectile\nmust have hit me as it glided rapidly from the car, sinking very slowly\nto the sand about fifty feet away. I scrambled to my feet, went in front\nagain, and easily dragged it along on the sand to an open place just\nbeyond the trees. There the doctor allowed it to settle. It sank into\nthe loose sand about eight inches, remaining steady in this position.\n\n\"She works beautifully!\" I cried. \"How I would like to see her turned\nloose for a real flight!\"\n\n\"That will come to-morrow night,\" said the doctor, crawling out of the\nport-hole. \"But if you will help me remove these boxes from the\nexperimental model, you shall see it lost in the sky.\" We uncovered and\ndragged out a small steel thing, about the same shape as the projectile,\nbut less than a foot thick and four feet long. It had a lid opening into\nits batteries from the top. The doctor entered his compartment to\nsecure some chemicals.\n\n\"If you have no further use for this model,\" I suggested, \"why not\ncreate a very strong current and let it sail off into indefinite space?\"\n\n\"Very well; I don't wish to leave it behind me for some one to discover,\nand I can't take it along. We will send it off for a long trip, and if\nit falls back it will be into the lake.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, then! Let's put a good-bye message in it;\" and so saying\nI took an old envelope from my pocket and wrote on the back of it with a\npencil in a bold hand: \"Farewell to Earth for ever!\" Laughing, I put\nthis inside and closed the lid.\n\nThen the doctor turned down a thumb-screw upon a little wire which\nconnected the poles, and stepped back quickly. Presently the forward end\nbegan to rise slowly, until it stood upright, but there it hesitated.\nThe doctor stepped forward and gave the thumb-screw a hard turn down,\nand the model lifted immediately, rising at first gradually, but soon\nshooting off with the whizz of a rocket over the lake. We watched it as\nlong as we could distinguish its dark outline.\n\n\"It will go a long way,\" said the doctor. \"I have never seen it make so\ngood a start. It will lose itself in the lake far from here.\"\n\nWe fastened up the front window and the port-hole, and started back to\nWhiting, where the doctor was to remain all night, so as to begin work\nearly in the morning. Presently, as we walked along, the doctor said,--\n\n\"Well, Isidor, now you have seen a practical demonstration of the\nelementary working of the projectile. You also have some idea of all\nthere is to be discovered up yonder in the red planet. You are the most\ninterested in making and profiting by those discoveries. I want you to\nconsent to go along.\"\n\n\"Haven't you secured a companion, then?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes, I have a friend, a countryman of mine here, who will go wherever I\nsay. He appreciates neither the risks nor the opportunities of the trip,\nstill he will take my word for everything. Yet if I ask him to go I take\nthe responsibility of his life as well as my own. He is not a suitable\nman, however, and I have really relied on you to come,\" he insisted.\n\n\"My dear doctor, I have every faith in you and in the projectile, and I\nprophesy a most successful trip. I should like nothing better than the\nadventure; but you must not count on me; I could not leave my business.\nThere's a fever in my blood that thirsts for it!\"\n\n\"Your business, indeed! You will never really amount to much till you\nhave left it. It's half a throw of dice and the other half a struggle of\ncut-throats!\"\n\n\"That is what people say who know nothing at all about it,\" I retorted.\n\"It occupies a large and important place in the world's commerce.\nBesides, I could not well leave Ruth and my uncle.\"\n\n\"Isn't it time you did something to make her proud of you, and to be\nworthy the education which he gave you? You have a chance now to be\ngreat. Isn't that worth ten chances to be rich? What would you have\nthought of Galileo if he hadn't had time to use the telescope after\ninventing it, but had devoted his time and talent to the maccaroni\nmarket? You are one man in ten million; you have an opportunity Columbus\nwould have been proud of! Will you neglect it for mere gold-grubbing?\nLeave that to the rest of your race and to this money-mad Chicago. You\ncome along with me. Let's make this work-a-day world of ours take time\nto stop and shake hands with her heavenly neighbours!\"\n\n\"You tempt me to do it, Doctor! Can you wait two or three days for me?\"\n\n\"I can, but Mars won't,\" he answered laconically. \"Besides, you must not\ntell any one that you are going.\"\n\n\"If there are any two things I love, it's a secret and a hurry! I will\nbe here to-morrow night,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nFarewell to Earth\n\n\nThe next day I quietly bought in my wheat, and told Flynn I was thinking\nof taking a little vacation. I said I was worn out fighting the contrary\nmarket, and told him to run the office as if it were his own until I\nreturned. At home I said nothing about the vacation, for I didn't care\nto have my stories agree very perfectly. I simply packed a few\nnecessities for the trip in a dress-suit case. My uncle was used to\nseeing me carry my evening clothes to the Club in this manner, and I\ncasually told him I should remain the night this time.\n\nI could not leave without kissing cousin Ruth good-bye, but this excited\nno suspicion, as it was a thing I did on every pretext. Then I slipped\nout and took back streets till I was several blocks away from the house.\nTaking a closed carriage here, I was driven to the same station and took\nthe same train for Whiting as on the previous evening. I found the\ndoctor awaiting me with a lantern. As we walked down the tracks in the\ntwilight I said to him,--\n\n\"I never made so quick a preparation, nor attempted so long a trip. I\nhave left my friends a lot of guessing! Now, how soon shall we be off?\"\n\n\"Within an hour,\" he answered. \"Mars will not be directly overhead until\nmidnight, but there is a little side trip I wish to make first, to test\nthe projectile before we get too far above the Earth's surface.\"\n\nThe sky was densely cloudy, there was no Moon, and it was already\ngrowing very dark. As we began to have difficulty in finding the way,\nthe doctor lighted his lantern. Peering up into the darkness, I said to\nhim,--\n\n\"There is not a star visible. How are you to find your way in the\nheavens a night like this?\"\n\n\"That is all perfectly easy. We shall soon rise far above those clouds,\nand then the stars will come out. Besides, I shall show you perfect\ndaylight again before midnight.\"\n\n\"I don't see just how, but I will take your word for it, Doctor. I\ndaresay you have thought it all out, and the whole trip will contain no\nsurprises for you.\"\n\n\"I have tried to think it all out and prepare for everything. But I am\ncertain I have forgotten something. I have a feeling amounting to a\ndreadful presentiment that I have overlooked something important. I wish\nyou would see if you can think of anything I have omitted.\"\n\n\"The only really important thing I have remembered is half a dozen boxes\nof the best cigars,\" I replied.\n\n\"Leave them right here in Whiting,\" he said with emphasis. \"We are\ncarrying only a limited supply of pure air, and we cannot afford to\ncontaminate it with tobacco smoke. No, sir, you can't smoke on this\ntrip.\"\n\n\"Then I won't go! Imagine not smoking for two whole months! Do you think\nI have sworn off?\"\n\n\"No, not yet. But you must. It pollutes the air, which we must keep\nclean and fresh as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Now, Doctor, you must let me have a good smoke once a day, just before\npumping the air out of my compartment.\"\n\n\"No, not even that. It is impossible to pump all the air out, and what\nis left mixes back with what is in my compartment. Once contaminated\nwith tobacco smoke, we could never get it perfectly pure again.\"\n\n\"Well, may I smoke on Mars, then? I will take them along for that. But,\nI warn you, I eat like a farm horse when I can't smoke.\"\n\n\"I have provided plenty to eat, but I know I have forgotten something.\nMention something now, mention everything you can think of, so that I\nmay see if it is provided for.\"\n\n\"Have you any money?\" I asked. \"I have changed some into gold, and have\na fairly heavy bag here.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I have some gold and silver money, besides a lot of beads,\ntrinkets, and gaudy tinsel things, such as earthly savages have been\nwilling to barter valuable merchandise for.\"\n\n\"So you are going on a trading expedition, are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not exactly. I leave all that to your superior abilities. But we may\nfind these things valuable to give as presents. Many of them are of tin,\nand if they do not happen to have that useful metal on Mars, they will\nbe of rare value there.\"\n\nWe had now reached the little grove where the projectile was hidden. I\nproceeded to open the rear port-hole, saying,--\n\n\"Let me look inside, and when I see what you have, some other necessary\nthing may suggest itself.\"\n\n\"Let me go in first, for I am afraid you will allow the menagerie to\nescape,\" he said, as he peered in by the light of the lantern. A\ndiminutive fox terrier barked from the inside, and wagged his tail\nfaster than a watch ticks, so glad he was to see us. The bright light\nalso awakened a small white rabbit that had been asleep in the doctor's\ncompartment.\n\n\"You are taking these along for companions, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, for that and for experiments. We may reach places where it will\nbe necessary to determine whether living, breathing things can exist\nbefore we try it ourselves. Then we shall put one of these out and\nobserve the effects.\"\n\n\"You may experiment on the rabbit all you please, but this little puppy\nand I are going to be fast friends, and we shall die together; shan't\nwe, Two-spot?\"\n\n\"Why do you call him Two-spot? There is only one spot on him, and his\nname is _Himmelshundchen_.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! The idea of such a long, heavy name for such a little puppy! I\nshall call him Two-spot because he is the smallest thing in the pack.\nHeavenly-puppy, indeed!\"\n\nThe doctor had entered and lighted a small gas jet, supplied on the\nPintsch system from compressed gas stored in one of the chambers. The\nrear compartment, which was to be mine, looked half an arsenal and half\na pantry. On the right side a cupboard was filled with newly-cooked\nmeats. I remember how plentiful the store looked at the time, but, alas!\nhow soon it vanished and we were reduced to tinned and bottled foods!\nThere was a cold joint of beef, a quarter of roast mutton, three boiled\nhams and four roast chickens.\n\nOn the left, folding up into the concavity of the wall, like the upper\nberth of a Pullman sleeping car, was my bunk. On the walls not thus\noccupied the arms were hung. There were two repeating rifles, each\ncarrying seventeen cartridges; two large calibre hammerless revolvers;\ntwo long and heavy swords, designed for cleaving rather than for\nstabbing; two chain shirts, to be worn under the clothing to protect\nagainst arrows; and finally two large shields, made of overlapping steel\nplates and almost four feet high. The doctor explained to me that the\nidea was to rest the lower edge of these on the ground and crouch behind\nthem. They were rather heavy and cumbersome to be carried far, and were\ngrooved in three sections, so that they slipped together into an arc\none-third of their circumference.\n\nI examined everything closely and asked a hundred questions, but the\ndoctor seemed to have provided for every necessity or contingency.\n\n\"Let us waste no more time,\" said I. \"If we have forgotten anything, we\nmust get along without it. All aboard! What is our first stop?\"\n\n\"The planet Mars, only thirty-six million miles away, if we are\nsuccessful in meeting him just as he comes into opposition on the third\nday of August. This is the most favourable opposition in which to meet\nhim for the past quarter of a century. Back in the year 1877 he was only\nabout thirty-five million miles away, and it was then that we learned\nmost that we know of his physical features. But we shall not have a more\nfavourable time than this for the next seventeen years.\"\n\n\"Still it seems like nonsense to talk about travelling such an\nincomprehensible distance, doesn't it?\" I ventured.\n\n\"Not at all!\" he replied positively. \"If the Earth travels a million\nmiles per day in her orbit, without any motion being apparent to her\ninhabitants, why should we not travel just as fast and just as\nunconsciously? We are driven by the same force. The same engine of the\nCreator's which drives all the universe, drives us. When we have left\nthe atmosphere we shall rush through the void of space without knowing\nwhether we are travelling at a thousand miles per minute or standing\nperfectly still. Our senses will have nothing to lay hold on to form a\njudgment of our rate of speed. But if we make an average of only five\nhundred miles per minute we shall accomplish the distance in about fifty\ndays, and arrive soon after opposition.\"\n\n\"But have you given up stopping on the Moon?\" I asked. \"I had great\nhopes of making those rich discoveries there.\"\n\n\"We must leave all that until our return trip. I have chosen this\nstarting time in the dark of the Moon in order to have the satellite on\nthe other side of the Earth and out of the way. She would only impede\nour progress, as we wish to acquire a tremendous velocity just as soon\nas we leave the atmosphere. We must accelerate our speed as long as\ngravity will do it for us. When we can no longer gain speed, we shall\nat least continue to maintain our rapid pace.\n\n\"But if we stopped on the Moon, we should only have her weak gravity to\nrepel us towards Mars, and we could make but little speed. On our\nreturn, the stop on the Moon will be a natural and easy one. We shall be\nnear home and can afford to loiter.\"\n\nWhile the doctor was saying this, he had been busy making tests of his\napparatus. He now called me to see his buoyancy gauge, which was a\nhalf-spherical mass of steel weighing just ten pounds. It was pierced\nwith a hole at right angles to its plane surface and strung upon a\nvertical copper wire. Small leaden weights, weighing from an ounce to\nfour pounds each, were provided to be placed upon the plane surface of\nthe steel. The doctor explained its action to me thus:--\n\n\"The polarizing action of the gravity apparatus affects only steel and\niron, and has no effect upon lead. Therefore, when the current is\nconducted through the copper wire into the soft steel ball, it will\nimmediately rise up the wire, by the repulsion of negative gravity. Now,\nif the leaden weights are piled upon the steel ball one by one, until it\nis just balanced half way up the wire, our buoyancy is thus measured or\nweighed. For instance, with the first two batteries turned in we have a\nbuoyancy a little exceeding one pound. That means, we should rise with\none-tenth the velocity that we should fall. Turning in two more\nbatteries, you see the buoyancy is three pounds, or our flying speed\nwill be three-tenths of our falling speed. With all the batteries acting\nupon the gauge, you see it will carry up more than ten pounds of lead,\nbecause the pressure of the air is against weight and in favour of\nbuoyancy. So long as we are in atmospheres, then, it is possible to fall\nup more rapidly than to fall down; but, on account of friction and the\nresultant heat, it is not safe to do so.\"\n\n\"So we have been doing the hard thing, by falling all our lives, when\nflying would really have been easier!\" I put in.\n\n\"We have been overlooking a very simple thing for a long time, just as\nour forefathers overlooked the usefulness of steam, being perfectly well\nacquainted with its expansive qualities. But let us be off. Close your\nport-hole, and screw it in tightly and permanently for the trip. Then\nlet down your bunk and prepare for a night of awkward, cramped\npositions. We shall be more uncomfortable to-night than any other of the\ntrip. You see, when we start, this thing will stand up on its rear end,\nand that end will continue to be the bottom until we begin to fall into\nMars. Then the forward end will be the bottom. But after the first night\nour weight will have so diminished that we can sleep almost as well\nstanding on our heads as any other way. Within fifteen hours you will\nhave lost all idea which end of you should be right side up, and we\nwill be quite as likely to float in the middle of the projectile as to\nrest upon anything.\"\n\nMy bed was hinged in the middle, and one end lifted up until it looked\nlike a letter L, with the shorter part extending across the projectile\nand the longer part reaching up the side. I could sit in it in a half\nreclining posture. The doctor then pulled out a fan-like, extending\nlattice-work of steel slats, to form a sort of false floor over the\nport-hole. This was full of diamond-shaped openings between the slats,\nso that the view out of the rear window was not obstructed. Then he did\nthe same to form a false floor for his compartment. Finally he said to\nme,--\n\n\"Now, if you are all ready, I will stand her on end;\" and by applying\nthe currents to the forward end only he caused her to rise slowly until\nshe stood upright. The cupboard in my compartment and the desk in his\nend were each hung upon a central bolt, and they righted themselves as\nthe projectile stood up, so that nothing in them was disarranged. I was\nsitting on the lower hinge of my bed, clutching tightly and watching\neverything, when the doctor called to me to turn the little wheel which\noperated a screw and served to push out the rudder.\n\n\"But the whole weight of the projectile is now on the rudder,\" I\nobjected.\n\n\"You will have to make over all your ideas of weight,\" he said, with\nsome impatience. \"Run the rudder out. The gauge shows an ounce of\nbuoyancy, which is nearly enough to counteract all the dead weight we\nhave. You can lift the rest with the rudder-screw.\"\n\nAnd, true enough, it was perfectly easy to whirl the little wheel around\nwhich made the rudder creep out. There was a steering wheel in the\ndoctor's compartment and one in my own. He set it exactly amidships, and\ntold me to prepare for the ascent. I turned out the gas in my\ncompartment and crouched nervously over the port-hole window to watch\nthe panorama of Earth fade away.\n\n\"Here go two batteries!\" he cried. I held on frantically, expecting that\nwe would leap into the heavens in one grand bound, as I had seen the\nmodel do. But we began to rise very slowly, a foot and a half the first\nsecond, three feet the next, and so on, as the doctor told me\nafterwards. It was all so slow and quiet that I was suddenly possessed\nwith a fear that after all the projectile was a failure. Had a balloon\nstarted so slowly, it would never have risen far. This fear held me for\nonly a minute, for when I looked down again, the landscape below was\nbeginning to look like a dim map or a picture, instead of the reality.\nThe doctor was steering to the northward, directly over the lake. I\ncould see its great purple, restful surface below me, but more plainly\ncould I discern the outline where its silvery edge bathed the white\nsands of the shore. Following this outline I could see a web of\nrailroads, like ropes bent around the lower end of the lake. The night\nwas too dark to see it long. The hundreds of huge oil tanks of Whiting\nhad now disappeared, and I could see only the flaming tops of the iron\nfurnaces of South Chicago. Suddenly they went out in an instant, as if a\nthick fog had smothered them, and there was a long minute of pale mist;\nand then suddenly a bright blue sky, the twinkling stars and a veil of\ngrey shutting off all view of the Earth.\n\n\"We have passed through the clouds,\" said the doctor cheerily. \"What\ndoes the barometer register?\"\n\nI looked, and was astonished to see the mercury down to fifteen. I asked\nhim if he thought the barometer might be broken.\n\n\"No, that is quite right,\" he replied. \"That is half the surface\npressure, which shows that we are two and a half miles high. I have four\nbatteries in, and we are going at a constantly increasing speed now.\"\n\nI could easily believe it, for the wind howled around my compartment and\nwhistled over the rudder aperture in a most dismal way. Whenever the\nrudder was changed, there was a new sound to the moaning. Still, as I\nlooked back at the clouds, I saw that no wind was moving them. It was\nnot wind, but only the air whistling as we rushed through it.\n\n\"Watch the barometer, and let me know the exact time when it registers\nseven and a half inches,\" said the doctor. \"We shall be five miles high\nthen, and we started at nine o'clock to a second.\"\n\nI noted the rapidly sinking mercury and opened my watch. When it was\njust at seven and a half, I looked at the watch, and it said half a\nminute after nine. Knowing that could not be correct, I held it to my\near and discovered it was stopped. I attempted to wind it, but found it\nalmost wound up.\n\n\"Something wrong with my watch, Doctor. You will have to look.\"\n\n\"Half a minute after nine, that can't be right!\" he exclaimed. Then as\nthe truth flashed upon him he added,--\n\n\"There is the first thing I have overlooked! Our watch springs are\nsteel, and the magnetic currents affect them. It is strange I did not\nthink of that, for I knew a mariner's compass would be of no use to us\nin steering on account of the currents. For that reason I have risen\nabove the clouds so as to steer by the stars. I am making for the North\nStar yonder, now.\"\n\n\"We will have to get back to the same primitive methods of measuring\ntime,\" I put in. \"Neither weight clocks nor spring clocks would have\nbeen of any account. And an hour glass would tell a different tale just\nas gravity varied. We will have to rely on the Moon and stars, and it\nmay be rather awkward.\" But I did not then appreciate how awkward it\nwould be when even the markings of day and night would be taken away\nfrom us.\n\n\"We can count our pulse or go by our stomachs,\" said the doctor, who was\nreally disappointed at having forgotten anything. But he was destined to\nget used to that. Presently he inquired,--\n\n\"What is the barometer now? Perhaps we are high enough for the present.\"\n\n\"There is scarcely two inches of mercury in the tube!\" I cried out.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment as if calculating, and then said,--\n\n\"That makes us ten miles high. Work the rudder gradually very much\nfarther out for this thinner atmosphere, and we will try falling awhile,\nwith a long slant to northward.\"\n\nAnd so saying, the doctor detached all the polarizing batteries, and I\ncould hear the monotonous howling of the wind die down; and the\nwhistling ceased altogether as the feeble resistance of the rarefied air\nslowly but surely overcame our momentum. As we began to fall, the doctor\nturned the rudder hard down, in order to give us a long sailing slant.\nThis modified the position of the projectile so that it lay almost flat\nagain, with a dip of the forward end downward.\n\n\"Lie down and have a nap while she is in this comfortable position,\" he\nsaid to me. \"When you waken, I shall have a surprise for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Terrors of Light\n\n\nI was weary from the trials of the day on Earth, and fell asleep easily.\nIt was the red sunlight streaming in at the port-hole that awakened me.\nI thought I had slept but a very short time, but the night was evidently\nover. As soon as the doctor heard me moving, he cried out to me,--\n\n\"Here is the daylight I promised you. Did you ever see it at midnight\nbefore?\"\n\n\"How do you know it is midnight? It looks more like a red sunset to me,\"\nI said, for the sun was just in the horizon.\n\n\"The sun has just set, and is now rising. It did not go out of sight,\nbut gradually turned about and began to mount again. That is how I know\nit is midnight.\"\n\n\"Sunset presses so closely upon sunrise that night is crowded out\naltogether. Then this must be the land of the midnight sun that I have\nread about?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are very near the Earth again, and this is far inside the\narctic polar circle, where the sun never goes down during summer, but\nsets for a long night in the winter. I have kept far to the westward to\navoid the magnetic pole, which might play havoc with my apparatus.\"\n\n\"Then your little side-trip is----\"\n\n\"To the North Pole, of course!\" he cried triumphantly.\n\nHow simple this vexed problem had become, after all! It had worsted the\nmost daring travellers of all countries for centuries. Thousands upon\nthousands spent in sending expeditions to find the Pole had only called\nfor other thousands to fit out relief expeditions. Ship after ship had\nbeen crashed, life after life had been clutched in its icy hand! But now\nit had become an after-thought, a side-trip, a little excursion to be\nmade while waiting for midnight! And it is often that such a simple\nsolution of the most baffling difficulties is found at last.\n\nThe doctor had been observing his quadrant, and was now busy making\ncalculations. He called me up to his compartment.\n\n\"Longitude, 144 degrees and 45 minutes west; Latitude, 89 degrees 59\nminutes and 30 seconds north. That is the way it figures out. We were\nhalf a mile from the Pole when I took my observation. We must have just\ncrossed over it since then.\"\n\n\"Go down a little nearer, so we may see what it looks like!\" I said\nexcitedly.\n\n\"I dare not go too close to all that ice, or we may freeze the mercury\nin our thermometer and barometer. We must keep well in the sunlight, but\nI will lower a little.\"\n\nWhat mountains of crusted snow! What crags and peaks of solid ice! It\nwas impossible to tell whether it was land or sea underneath. Judging by\nthe general level it must have been a sea, but no water was visible in\nany direction. The great floes of ice were piled high upon each other. A\nmillion sharp, glittering edges formed ramparts in every direction to\nkeep off the invader by land. How impotent and powerless man would be to\nscale these jagged walls or climb these towering mountains! How\nabsolutely impossible to reach by land, how simple and easy to reach\nthrough the air! The North Pole and Aerial Navigation had been cousin\nproblems that baffled man for so long, and their solution had come\ntogether.\n\n\"Empty a biscuit tin to contain this record, and we will toss it out\nupon this world of ice, so that if any adventurer ever gets this far\nnorth he may find that we have already been here,\" said the doctor,\nbringing down a freshly-written page for me to sign. It read as\nfollows:--\n\n    \"Aboard Anderwelt's Gravity Projectile, 12.25 a.m., June 12th, 1892.\n    The undersigned, having left the vicinity of Chicago at nine o'clock\n    on the evening of June 11th, took bearings here, showing that they\n    passed over the North Pole soon after midnight. Then they took up\n    their course to the planet Mars.\n\n                                          \"(Signed) HERMANN ANDERWELT.\n                                                    ISIDOR WERNER.\"\n\nThis was duly enclosed in the biscuit tin, which I bent and crimped a\nlittle around the top so that the cover would stay on tightly. Then I\nlearned how such things were conveyed outside the projectile. A\ncylindrical, hollow plunger fitting tightly into the rear wall was\npulled as far into the projectile as it would come. A closely fitting\nlid on the top of the cylinder was lifted, and the tin deposited within.\nThe lid was then fitted down again, and the plunger was pushed out and\nturned over until the weight of the lid caused it to fall open and the\ncontents to drop out. The tin sailed down, struck a tall crag, bounded\noff, and fell upon a comparatively level plateau. The cylinder was then\nturned farther over, causing the lid to close, and the plunger was\npulled in again. I remember how crisply cold was that one cubic foot of\nair that came back with the cylinder. My teeth had been chattering ever\nsince I wakened, and I had been too excited to put on a heavier coat.\n\n\"What is the thermometer?\" asked the doctor. It was a Fahrenheit\ninstrument we were carrying.\n\n\"Thirty-eight degrees below zero, and still falling!\" I told him.\n\n\"Then we must be off at once, and at a good speed, to warm up. Now say a\nlong good-bye to Earth, for it may be nothing more than a pale star to\nus hereafter.\"\n\nThe doctor steered to westward as he rose steadily to a height of about\nten miles. Then he fell with a long slant to the south-west. He was\nworking back into the darkness of night again. We had lost the sun long\nbefore we started to rise again.\n\n\"We are now well above the Pacific Ocean, about fifteen hundred miles\nnorth-west of San Francisco,\" said the doctor, consulting his large\nglobe.\n\n\"It seems to me you cross continents with remarkable ease and swiftness.\nFrom Chicago to San Francisco alone is almost three thousand miles,\" I\nventured.\n\n\"But we have been gone four hours, and if we had simply stood still\nabove the Earth for four hours it would have travelled under us about\nfour thousand miles, so that San Francisco would already have passed the\nplace where we started.\"\n\n\"Then one only needs to get off somewhere and remain still in order to\nmake a trip around the World!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You are quite right, and travelling upon the Earth's surface is the\nmost awkward method, because it is impossible to take advantage of the\nEarth's own rapid motion. Around the World in eighty days was once\nconsidered a remarkable feat, but if we were to travel steadily\nwestward we should make the circuit in very much less than twenty-four\nhours. The motion of the Earth upon its axis is such an immense\nadvantage that if we were only going from Chicago to London, the trip\ncould be more easily and quickly made by going to the westward some\ntwenty-one thousand miles, rather than going directly eastward less than\nfour thousand miles. For going eastward we should have to travel a\nthousand miles an hour in order to keep up with the Earth. It is\nquestionable whether we could make that speed tacking up and slanting\ndown.\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to follow the course of Empire, always westward!\" I\nlaughed.\n\nWhile we were talking thus, the whizzing and whistling of the wind,\nwhich had been at first very loud and hissing, had gradually died down.\nI looked at the barometer, and reported that there was scarcely\nthree-eighths of an inch of mercury in the tube.\n\n\"We are practically above the atmosphere, then,\" said the doctor,\nturning in all the batteries. He tried the rudder in the ether, and\nfound it turned her when fully extended and turned rather hard over.\n\n\"I tried to sleep this morning at Whiting to prepare for to-night's\nwork,\" said the doctor presently; \"but I find I am getting\nuncontrollably drowsy. Come up, and I will show you the course we most\nkeep, and then I will lie down to get a little rest.\"\n\nI mounted to his compartment and gazed through the telescope at Mars,\nlooking like a little, red baby-moon, floating in one side of the blue\ncircle.\n\n\"Keep him always in view, but in the edge of the field like that,\" said\nthe doctor. \"We must always steer a little to the right of him--that is,\na little behind him.\"\n\n\"But he travels around the sun in the same direction the Earth does,\" I\nobjected. \"I should think we ought to aim a little ahead of him, or to\nthe left, to allow for his motion forward in his orbit.\"\n\n\"That looks reasonable at first sight, doesn't it?\" said the doctor.\n\"But a little learning is a dangerous thing. I will explain to you why\nwe must steer a little behind him after I have had my nap. I am too\nsleepy now;\" and he finished with a yawn.\n\nHe soon fell asleep, and I was left alone to think over the events of\nthe day and the still more strange happenings of the night. It hurt my\neyes to look long through the telescope, so I closed them and gave free\nrein to my thoughts.\n\nHow soon will it be morning? How shall I know when it _is_ morning? That\nterm \"morning\" applies only to the surface of revolving planets. I had\njust seen the morning come at midnight, and then the darkness of night\nfall again directly after morning. After all, what are night and\nmorning? The one is a passing into the shadow of the Earth, and the\nother is simply the emerging into the light. They depend on a rotation,\nand we shall know no more of them until we land on a revolving planet\nagain. But which shall we have on the trip, night or daylight? Naturally\nwe would very soon emerge from the little shadow cast by the Earth. It\nhad taken us but an hour or two to travel out of it into the daylight\nand then back into the darkness again. Even if we did not leave it, the\nEarth would move on and leave us.\n\nAnd what then? Nothing but uninterrupted, untempered, unhindered\ndaylight! Eternal, dazzling, direct sunlight, unrelieved by any night,\nunstrained through any clouds! This deep blue of the starry night would\nbe succeeded by the hot, white light of a scorching, gleaming Sun. And\nthen (the thought chilled my bones as it fell upon me!), then how would\nwe see Mars? How would we see any star, or perchance the Moon? Even the\nEarth might be drowned in that sea of everlasting, all-engulfing\nbrilliancy! Nothing in all the Universe would be visible but the beaming\nSun, and he too blindingly bright to look upon.\n\nAs the truth of all this took hold of me, it filled me with a growing\nterror. At any moment we might emerge from this grateful shadow of the\nEarth, and then we would be lost, drowned, engulfed in a blinding,\nsight-suffocating light! In desperate terror I looked around toward the\ndoctor, as if for assistance. He was sleeping peacefully. He had never\nthought of it! _This_ was the great thing he had overlooked! Even at\nstarting he had a dreadful presentiment of it.\n\nHe was a great man, and his discovery a wonderful one; but here was the\ntrouble with it. He had solved the question of navigating space, but the\nsunlight! the dazzling, burning, terrible sunlight! how was he to\nnavigate that? It was simply impossible! We would have to turn back\nbefore we emerged into it. We would have to retrace our path while we\nwere still in the grateful shadow. Ah, the blessedness of night after\nall!\n\nThen slowly and cautiously, so that I might not waken him, I crept down\nto the rear window to see how far away the Earth was. We were at so\ngreat a distance that I could see the whole outline of it, as a great\ndull globe filling all the view behind us. And as I looked again I\nstarted and uttered a cry! A thin sickle of bright, white light\nglimmered over the whole eastern edge of it, like the first glimpse of\nthe new Moon, but a hundred times larger! It was the sunlight! It must\nbe creeping around the eastern edge, and would soon engulf us.\n\nThe doctor had been aroused by my cry. Not seeing me in his compartment,\nhe had gone at once to the telescope.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he said. \"You have lost the course a little.\" And\nas I peered out of my port-hole I saw that narrow sickle of light grow\nthinner and thinner, and finally go out. Had I imagined it all? No, I\nhad seen it.\n\n\"Ah, Doctor, I am so glad you have wakened. I am frightened, terrified,\nby the light!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe Valley of the Shadow\n\n\n\"Light! Where have you seen any light?\"\n\n\"I saw the Earth begin to shine like a New Moon on the eastern edge,\nbut----\"\n\n\"Ah, that _was_ a danger signal. I am glad you awakened me. But you are\nactually pale and trembling! There is no danger if you keep the course.\nYou see, that rim of light has faded and disappeared since I corrected\nthe course.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you cannot keep in this little Earthly shadow much longer; and\nwhat can we possibly do when we emerge into the fathomless, trackless\neffulgence of eternal sunshine? Let us turn back before we plunge into\nit,\" I pleaded.\n\n\"So that is what terrified you! Well, you have hit upon one of the\ngreatest difficulties of the trip; but it is far from insurmountable. We\nwill not turn back yet, especially as we have started in the most\nopportune time. You have mentioned this 'little shadow.' It is eight\nthousand miles wide at the surface of the Earth, and gradually, very\ngradually, tapers down to nothing far out in space. Have you ever\ncalculated how far it reaches?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"But we moved out of it and back into it at the\nsurface very easily, and besides, as the Earth moves forward in its\norbit, the shadow will leave us.\"\n\n\"This little shadow is eight hundred and fifty-six thousand miles long,\nand we will never leave it as long as it lasts!\" exclaimed the doctor.\n\"Just at this time it points like a long arrow out in the direction of\nMars. It is moving gradually as the Earth moves and hourly correcting\nits aim. At opposition time it will point directly and unerringly at\nMars. Therefore it is a way prepared, surveyed, and marked for us\nthrough the all-enveloping sunlight, which otherwise would be dreadful\nenough.\"\n\n\"But how can we be sure of keeping in it? It is rapidly narrowing as it\nreaches farther out.\"\n\n\"I see I should have explained that to you before I went to sleep, and\nsaved you this fright. The shadow now points behind Mars, as it is many\ndays yet before it overtakes that planet in opposition. That is why I\ntold you to steer always a little behind the planet. But you went a\nlittle out of the course, and immediately something warned us. That rim\nof light on the east of the Earth was notice to us that we were not in\nthe centre of the shadow, but bearing too far to the left. We must keep\nabsolutely in the dark of the Earth, with no light visible on either\nside of it. If a thin rim should appear on one side, we must turn toward\nthe other until it is all dark again.\"\n\n\"Grant that this shadow is so enormously long, yet it is only scarcely\none-fortieth of the distance to Mars,\" I objected. \"After we emerge from\nit, what then?\"\n\n\"With the aid of my telescope we shall probably be able to see the Earth\nas an orb, half or quarter as large as the Moon usually appears to us,\nand to observe its phases until we are several million miles from it. We\nmust continue to keep the rim of light, which will then surround it,\nequal on all sides.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I am afraid,\" I interrupted, \"that as soon as we pass out of\nthis shadow the sunlight will be so bright that we cannot see any\nplanets, not even the Earth. You know we cannot see the Moon only a\nquarter of a million miles away when the sun shines.\"\n\n\"In that case we must move the telescope to your window, put on a\ndarkened lens, and steer so as to keep the Earth as a spot in the middle\nof the Sun. It must appear to us as Venus does to the Earth when she is\nmaking a transit across the face of the sun. But by our continual\nshifting we prevent the Earth from making a transit, and hold it as a\nsteady spot in the centre of the Sun. This we can do for many, many\nmillion miles, continuing until we have reached the vicinity of Mars.\n\n\"And you must also remember,\" continued the doctor, \"that the brighter\nthe light the darker will be the shadow. Now, this projectile is a\nperfectly black, non-reflecting object five feet wide. It will cast a\nshadow in front of it five hundred feet long. When we are comparatively\nnear Mars my telescope, situated in the miniature night cast by the\nprojectile, will find the planet, and we can then steer directly for\nhim. If we should chance within eighty thousand miles of him, he would\nattract us to him in a straight line. But we shall not rely upon chance.\nMoreover, when we are as near to him as that, the light and heat of the\nSun's rays will have decreased sixty or seventy per cent. When Mars is\nfarthest from the Sun, he receives only one-third as much light as the\nEarth does. But he is now almost at his nearest point to the Sun, and\nreceives half as much light.\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly have a pretty clear idea of how to steer the course\nall the way, Doctor. And I was hasty enough to think you had overlooked\nthis entire phase of the subject!\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"Indeed, I have thought of it very much. And we should not enjoy all\nthese advantages if we had not started just before opposition. At any\nother time the Earth's shadow would not point toward Mars, nor would the\ntransit of the Earth over the Sun be of any use to us.\"\n\n\"All this reassures me greatly,\" I replied; \"but I shall keep a close\nwatch from my rear window for danger lights on the Earth.\"\n\n\"It must be time for breakfast,\" put in the doctor. \"Will you see how\ntempting a meal you can prepare?\"\n\nThere was one reservoir built inside the compartments, from which we\ndrew cool water, and another built next to the outer steel framework,\nfrom which we could draw boiling water. As this tank was connected with\nthe discharge pipe of the air-pump, and thus with the exterior, I was\ndisgusted to find that, although the water boiled furiously, and was\nrapidly wasting away in steam, it did not become hot enough to make good\nbeef tea. The heat escaped with the steam at a comparatively low\ntemperature, so that I was compelled to boil water over my gas jet for\nthe meat extract, which we drank instead of coffee. I also prepared some\nsandwiches of roast beef and cold ham, and with great relish we began\nour diet of ready cooked foods, which was to continue for so long.\n\nAfter this meal I felt quite sleepy, for I had enjoyed but three hours'\nrest. The doctor saw my yawns and told me to turn out the gas and have a\nlong doze, and I was glad enough to do so.\n\nI must have slept soundly for an hour or two, and then I remember dozing\nand rolling lazily in my bed, as I usually did at home on Sunday\nmornings. During my previous nap the bunk had seemed hard and cramped,\nand I had privately grumbled at the doctor for overlooking personal\ncomforts; but now I felt that luxurious sensation of sleeping on soft\nmattresses and yielding springs, though of course I had neither. I do\nnot know how soon I should have thoroughly awakened had I not lifted my\nhand to rub my eye, and unwittingly dealt myself a stinging blow in the\nface. This roused me.\n\nBut what was the matter with that arm? It was as it had once been in a\nnightmare, when it felt detached from its place, and moved lightly and\nwithout effort, like a bough in the wind. I pinched it with my other\nhand, and it was quite sensible to the pain. In fact, the other arm was\nnow acting in the same queer way. I arose in bed quickly to see what was\nthe matter, and the upper part of my body bent violently over and struck\nagainst my knees. Then my effort to take an upright position threw me on\nmy back again. Evidently my muscles were not working as they were when I\nwent to bed. They must be over-excited and over-active. I immediately\nthought of my heart as the principal and controlling muscle, and in my\neagerness to feel its beating my hand dealt me a slap in the chest.\nThese blows, though rapid, did not seem to hurt as much as they ought,\nafter the first stinging sensation. I found my heart was beating\nregularly enough.\n\n\"Doctor!\" I cried out presently, more to test my voice than for\nanything else. It sounded perfectly natural, and my vocal chords were\nnot over-stimulated or abnormal.\n\nHe came half way down from his compartment soon after hearing me, and\nrested his elbow against one side of the aperture between the\ncompartments, leaning against the other side easily. He had a scale made\nof heavy coiled spring in his hand.\n\n\"I wish to calculate our distance from the Earth,\" he said. \"Do you mind\nweighing yourself on these scales?\" and he held the spiral down toward\nme.\n\n\"You can't support my weight!\" I exclaimed, and springing up from the\nbed I bumped my head against the partition between the compartments,\neight feet above my floor. I grasped the lower ring of the scale he held\ndown and lifted up my feet. It seemed as if something were still\nsupporting me from below, for scarcely one-tenth my weight had fallen\nupon my hands.\n\n\"You weigh twenty and a half pounds,\" he said, and then inquired, \"What\ndid you weigh on Earth?\"\n\n\"One hundred and eighty-five pounds,\" I answered, just beginning to\nunderstand that our greatly increased distance from the Earth had much\nreduced her attraction for us.\n\n\"That is disappointing,\" he answered, \"for we are only eight thousand\nmiles from home; but our velocity is still constantly increasing.\"\n\n\"I would like to buy things here and sell them at the surface,\" I\nexclaimed.\n\n\"You wouldn't make anything by it if you used the ordinary balance\nscales,\" replied the doctor.\n\nTry as hard as I would, I could not accustom my muscles to these new\nconditions. They were too gross and clumsy for the fine and delicate\nefforts which were now necessary. I was constantly hitting and slapping\nmyself, though these blows scarcely hurt, and never resulted in bruises.\nI attempted a thorough re-training of my muscles, which was to all\nintents an utter failure, for weight continued diminishing much more\nrapidly than my stubborn muscles could appreciate. After another eight\nthousand miles, which were quickly made, we had but one twenty-fifth our\nusual weight, which reduced me to seven pounds. And for most of the trip\nwe weighed practically nothing, suffering many inconveniences on that\naccount.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTricks of Refraction\n\n\nThe doctor figured out that we should be quite insensible to any weight\nwhen we were seventy-five thousand miles from the Earth. At fifty\nthousand miles I would still weigh a pound, and when we had finished the\nfirst million miles, the entire projectile, with its two occupants and\nall its dead weight, would weigh considerably less than an ounce. That\nwas a mere start on the enormous trip ahead of us; but when that\ndistance was reached, we could no longer count upon terrestrial gravity\nfor accelerating our speed. We must travel with our accumulated\nmomentum, unless by that time the Sun should have taken the place of the\nEarth, and with his vaster forces continue to repel us Marsward.\n\nAs we sat talking the doctor grew weary, and soon unconsciously dropped\nasleep. I left him to enjoy his rest, and, tossing a scrap of ham bone\nto Two-spot, I went up to take my place at the telescope.\n\nMars seemed to be exactly in the right part of the field. I surveyed the\nstarry stretches ahead with a feeling a little akin to fear. I was\nqueerly affected by the vast expanse of loneliness outside, and by the\ndeathly quiet prevailing both without and within. There was not the\nslightest whizzing or whistling now. We might be hanging perfectly\nmotionless in space for all I knew. The batteries made no sound either.\nI could hear only the low, regular breathing of the doctor as he slept,\nand the slight crunching of Two-spot on his bone. Presently I thought of\nlooking for the danger lights, but I looked through the telescope\ninstead, and saw the little red planet in his proper place.\n\nWhat a vast distance we were from any planet! If anything were to happen\nto us, no one on Earth or in the heavens would ever know of it. I had\nnever been homesick, but a very little would have made me Earthsick just\nthen. I did not like the upper end of the projectile because I could not\nlook back at the home planet. I wondered if it was all dark back that\nway, or if those warning lights had begun to appear. That idea seemed to\nhaunt me. I touched the steering wheel just a little while I kept my\neyes on Mars. He moved slightly in the field at once. Then I turned the\nwheel back until he took his former place. It was reassuring to know how\neasily the projectile minded her great rudder, which was now fully\nextended like an enormous wing. This made me feel that we were masters\nof the situation, that all this vast space was as nothing to us, that\nany planet in the heavens must mind us, and that though Earth was\ndriving us away, she must draw us back if we willed it. More than that,\nshe would warn us of all dangers. Perhaps she was sending that warning\nnow. I had promised to look out for it. I felt that I must go down. I\ncrept softly past the doctor and stooped over the port-hole. My eyes had\nscarcely found the Earth in the darkness when I drew back quickly and\nclapped my hand over my mouth to prevent a cry escaping me. Then I\nlooked again more closely. There was no small illuminated portion of the\nsurface this time, but a great smear of light just outside the edge of\nthe Earth. It was of a dull red colour, with rainbow tints around the\nedges, and was much the shape of a great umbrella held just above one\nquarter of her surface to westward.\n\nI gave the steering wheel in my compartment a sharp turn in the\ndirection which should cause the light to disappear. Then I crouched and\nlooked again, but instead of being reduced in size the light broadened\nand swelled. It was as if one edge of the umbrella were left against the\nEarth's surface, and then the umbrella was being turned gradually around\nuntil it faced me and formed an enormous disc, apparently a third as big\nas the Earth. Then, as it slowly moved outward, its edge seemed to\ncleave to the Earth's, as two drops of water do when about to separate.\nFinally, it detached itself entirely, and stood as a great muddy red orb\na little to the west of and above the Earth. It filled me with dismay to\nsee all this happen after I had turned the rudder in the direction which\nshould have corrected our course. In desperation I gave the wheel an\nadditional hard turn and looked again. At last the great red patch was\nshrinking; slowly it diminished, and finally disappeared. But just as I\nwas breathing a sigh of relief, I noticed the white sickle of light on\nthe east side that I had seen before; only it was increasing most\nthreateningly now. Yes, it was assuming the same umbrella shape and\ndetaching itself a little from the eastern edge of the Earth. There was\nstill a narrow rim of bright white light on the Earth, and this dimmer\numbrella shape was faintly separated from its edge. Its outlines were\nmarked by flashes of rainbow colours, as had been the case on the other\nside. I sprang to the wheel and gave it several frantic turns back the\nother way. Then I ran up to the telescope for a hurried view, and Mars\nwas nowhere to be seen! I hastened back to the wheel and gave it a\nvicious additional turn. I was determined to prevent this umbrella from\nopening at me! And true enough it ceased enlarging, and gradually shrank\nand settled back upon the surface of the Earth. Then slowly it faded and\ndisappeared, as it had done before when the doctor had corrected the\ncourse. I eased back the wheel and went to look for Mars again, but he\nwas not in the field. As I returned I brushed unconsciously against the\ndoctor in my excitement. He roused himself, sat up, and watched me\npeering out of the port-hole. I was gazing at a new appearance.\n\n\"There it is again!\" I cried, for below the Earth and to westward a pale\nwhite disc came into view all at once, not gradually, as if emerging\nfrom behind the Earth, but springing out complete and detached.\n\n\"Doctor!\" I said, catching him by the arm and pulling him down to the\nport-hole, \"what is that?\"\n\n\"That? That is the Moon, my boy. Has it excited you so much?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have been trying to dodge it. But you had better look to the\nwheel,\" I cried.\n\nHe ran up to the telescope, and I heard him exclaim, \"_Donnerwetter!_\"\nhalf under his breath. But with a few careful turns of the wheel he\nfound the planet again, and moved him to the right part of the field.\nMeanwhile the Full Moon shone on us with its pale glimmer. But a thin\nrim of it next to the Earth gleamed brightly with rich silver light.\n\n\"I thought you said we had started in the dark of the Moon. I thought it\nwas behind the Earth,\" I interposed.\n\n\"That is the New Moon just emerging. It will probably not be seen on the\nEarth until to-morrow night, but as we are at a greater distance we see\nit first,\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"But that is not a New Moon, it is a Full Moon, which should not be seen\nfor fourteen days yet,\" I objected.\n\n\"Pardon me, it _is_ a New Moon,\" he insisted. \"That inner rim of\nbrightness is all the sunlight she reflects. The paler glimmer is\nEarth-light, which she reflects. When she is really a Full Moon, she\nwill be perfectly dark to us.\"\n\nThen I explained to him the first umbrella appearance, and its gradual\nswelling and final disappearance.\n\n\"Rainbow colours around the edge and a gradual changing of the shape,\nyou say? That means refraction. The Earth's atmosphere has been playing\ntricks on you. The umbrella of dull red light was a refracted view of\nthe Moon before she really came into sight. Rays of light from the\nhidden Moon were bent around to you. Then, as she gradually moved from\nbehind the Earth, her appearance was magnified by the convex lens formed\nby the atmosphere, bent over that planet. Presently it diminished and\nwent out altogether, you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that was because I steered away from her,\" I replied.\n\n\"No; you could hardly lose her so easily,\" he answered. \"Did you ever\ntry holding an object behind a water-bottle or a gold-fish jar? There is\na place near the edge of the jar where a thing cannot be seen, though\nthe glass and water are perfectly transparent. The rays of light from\nthe object are bent around, through the glass and water, away from the\neyes of the observer. It was like that with the Moon when she\ndisappeared. She was really drawing out from the Earth all the time.\nFinally, when her light passed beyond the atmosphere altogether, she\nbecame suddenly visible in a different place and shining with another\ncolour. What we see now is the real Moon in her true place. The other\nappearances were all tricks of refraction.\"\n\n\"But when I had turned away,\" I explained, \"there came a thin rim of\nbright light on the other side of the Earth, and a gradually appearing\numbrella shape there too.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you steered far enough out of your course to see part of the\nilluminated surface of the Earth. That was the real danger light. And if\nit began to assume the umbrella shape, detached from the Earth, that was\ndue to atmospheric refraction of sunlight. This great shadow we are\ntravelling in has an illuminated core, which we shall encounter when we\nhave proceeded a little further. I tell you of it now, so it may not\ngive you another shock. Have you ever noticed the small bright spot\nwhich illuminates the centre of the shadow cast by a glass of water?\nThat is partly the same as the core of light which exists in the heart\nof this shadow. Rays from the sun, passing on all sides of the Earth,\nare refracted through the atmosphere and bent inward. You must have\nsteered over into some of these rays just now, and then turned back from\nthem. Somewhat farther on all these refracted rays will meet at a common\ncentre, which they will illuminate, and we shall have an oasis of\nrainbow-tinged sunlight in this great desert of shadow. The sun will\nthen appear to us to be an enormous circle of dull light entirely\nsurrounding the Earth.\"\n\n\"I don't fancy running into that at all,\" said I. \"Can't we avoid it by\nsteering out?\"\n\n\"Avoid it!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"We must investigate it, and\nphotograph the peculiar appearance of the sun. Light seems to have more\nterrors for you than anything else just now. You must get over your\nrush-and-do tendency; you must stifle your emotions and impulses, and\nlearn to think of things in a more calm and scientific manner.\"\n\n\"But that is not so easy for me, Doctor. Whenever I am left alone, a\nfeeling of dread possesses me. I am used to having many people, bustling\nnoises, and confused movement all about me. The silence of Space stifles\nme, and the loneliness of the ether oppresses and overcomes me\nstrangely.\"\n\n\"I prescribe a change of air for you,\" answered the doctor. \"You will do\nbetter in a rarer atmosphere. Let us send what we have been breathing\nback to Whiting, and make a new one to suit ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Twilight of Space\n\n\n\"Shall I come up into your compartment for the operation?\" I asked.\n\n\"No; for this first time we will pump out my compartment, as I wish to\nobserve from the rear port-hole the action of the air which we set\nfree.\"\n\nThe bulkhead, with its bevelled edge, was therefore fitted into the\nopening between the compartments, and I took the first turn at the lever\nhandle of the air-pump, while the doctor observed from the window. I had\ngiven the handle less than a dozen vigorous strokes when the doctor\nsuddenly exclaimed,--\n\n\"Stop! Wait a moment;\" and he began pulling at the bulkhead, which was\nalready rather tightly wedged in by the air pressure. \"I have left the\nrabbit inside,\" he said, when he found breath to speak. And poor little\nbunny's heart was beginning to beat fast when he was rescued.\n\nThen we began again. The doctor watched the escaping air for some time,\nevidently forgetting that I was at all interested in it.\n\n\"All quite as I expected,\" he said at last. \"Only I had forgotten about\nthe snow.\"\n\n\"Nothing will ever be very new or interesting to you,\" I put in; \"but\npray remember I am here, and rapidly getting empty of breath and full of\ncuriosity.\"\n\nThen he relieved me at the pump handle, and this is what I saw from the\nport-hole: The air escaping from the discharge pipe of the air-pump was\nvisible, and looked like dull, grey steam. Immediately on being set free\nit swelled and expanded greatly, and sank away from us slowly. But at\nthe instant of its expansion the cold thus produced froze the moisture\nof the air into a fine fleecy snow, which lasted but a second as it sank\naway from us and melted in the heat, which the thermometer showed to be\nclose upon ninety-five degrees. This miniature snowstorm was seen for an\ninstant only after each down motion of the pump handle.\n\n\"Where is this air going?\" I inquired. \"The little clouds of it seem to\ndrop away from us like lead; but that must be because of our speed.\"\n\n\"It is falling back to the Earth, to join the outer layer of rare\natmosphere there. If we had a positive current instead of a negative\none, the air would not leave us, but we should gradually be surrounded\nby an atmosphere of our own, which we should retain until some planet,\nwhose gravitational attraction is vastly stronger than ours, stole it\nfrom us. When we begin to fall into Mars, we shall acquire such an\nenveloping atmosphere; and we can draw upon it and re-compress it if our\ninner supply should become exhausted.\"\n\n\"If this air is falling home to earth,\" said I, \"we could send messages\nback in that manner.\"\n\n\"We can drop them back at any time, regardless of the air,\" he answered,\nand then added suddenly, \"but it will make a beautiful experiment to\ndrop out a bottle now.\"\n\nHe ceased pumping, and opening a bottle of asparagus tips, he placed\nthem in a bowl, and prepared to drop out the bottle. I took my pencil\nand wrote this message to go inside,--\"Behold, I have decreed a judgment\nupon the Earth; for it shall rain pickle bottles and biscuit tins for\nthe period of forty days, because of the wickedness of the world, unless\nshe repent!\" And I pictured to myself the perplexity of the poor devil\nwho should see this message come straight down from heaven!\n\nIn order to make his experiment more successful, the doctor put in half\na dozen bullets from one of the rifles, to make the weight more\nperceptible. Then he put the bottle into the discharging cylinder, and\npreparing to push it out he stooped over the port-hole. At a signal from\nhim I gave the pump handle several quick, successive motions, and at the\nsame instant he let drop the bottle. At once he cried out,--\n\n\"Beautiful! and just as I thought.\"\n\n\"But I didn't see it!\" I protested. \"What was it?\"\n\n\"The instant the bottle was released the discharged air was immediately\nattracted toward it, and gradually surrounded it entirely. It was like a\nlittle planet with an atmosphere of its own, as they fell back to the\nEarth together.\"\n\n\"But I couldn't see it; I had to pump,\" I complained. \"We must do it\nagain.\"\n\n\"We shall soon have our bottled things all emptied out on plates to dry\nup and spoil,\" he objected. So I emptied a biscuit tin this time, and\ndelaying for no message, I put it in the discharging cylinder. Then I\nbent over the port-hole and gave the signal for the pumping. As I thrust\nout the tin I was astonished to see the lid pop off the first thing. The\nquick expansion of the air inside it did that. This air, as well as the\nair from the discharge pipe, seemed to flee from it instead of\nsurrounding it, as the doctor had said. I continued watching so long\nthat he finally said,--\n\n\"Hasn't it fallen out of sight yet?\"\n\n\"No; it is not falling away swiftly as the air does. It is following the\nprojectile! It is not gathering any air about it as you said it would.\nIt does not quite keep up with us; but considering our speed, it is\ndoing remarkably well!\"\n\nThe doctor was not inclined to believe me until he had looked for\nhimself. He watched and pondered for a minute or two. Then his surprise\nceased, and he spoke in that assured way which always irritated me.\n\n\"Quite natural, after all,\" he said. \"That biscuit can is made of thin\nsheet-iron with a surface coating of tin. The iron has become magnetized\nby induction, and the Earth repels the can just as it repels us. It will\nfollow us to the dead-line, and probably on to Mars, unless the\nsheet-iron loses its polarization. If we had cast out a thing of solid\niron, it would rush ahead of us, instead of falling a little behind, as\nthis does, for it would have no dead weight to carry. But we could not\nput such a thing out of the rear end, for no force would make it fall\nthat way. If we put it out of the forward port-hole, it would beat us in\nthe race toward Mars.\"\n\nI remarked to the doctor that the air-pump seemed to be incorrectly\nbuilt, for its action was strangely difficult in the reverse manner that\nit should have been. The down strokes went by themselves with a quick\nsnap, but the up strokes were as if against pressure, and the moment the\nhandle was released it flew down again. He had not tested the pump at\nthe surface, as it was of a well-known make, but it certainly seemed to\nwork backwards. Moreover, the more nearly we had a compartment emptied\nof air, the more difficult the pumping should become, but here again the\nreverse seemed to be the case, for the longer we worked the easier the\nup strokes became.\n\nThe temperature of the projectile was still fairly comfortable, and the\ndoctor allowed the condensed air to issue very slowly into the partial\nvacuum in his compartment until it produced a barometric pressure of\ntwenty-seven. Then we pulled back the bulkhead, and when the new\natmosphere had mixed with the old in my compartment, a pressure of\ntwenty-eight resulted.\n\n\"That is about the way the barometer stands during tempests at sea,\"\nremarked the doctor. I could not notice much difference from the air we\nhad previously had. Possibly it was fresher and slightly more\nexhilarating.\n\nThe effort at the pump had made us both hungry again, and I prepared\nfrom meat extracts a warm and rather thick gravy to put over the\nasparagus tips. I attempted to pour it, but it was so light that its\nsticky consistency prevented it from running. We had a hundred such\nexamples daily of the changes which lack of weight caused in the\nsimplest operations. With sandwiches made of biscuits and condensed\nmeat, we eked out a luncheon. This must have been about noon, for when\nit was over I remember noticing that we no longer needed the gas in the\ncompartment, for there was a gradually increasing mellow light outside.\n\n\"Are we already emerging from the shadow?\" I inquired eagerly.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" replied the doctor. \"But we are now entering its\nilluminated core. I must prepare to photograph the strange appearance of\nthe Sun that we shall see presently.\"\n\nI hastened to the port-hole, and did not leave until it was all over.\nWhat I then saw was one of the most beautiful things of the whole trip.\nThe light outside was not bright, but soft and dreamy, like the first\ntwilight after a rich day of summer. The great corona all around the\nouter edge of the Earth was the most magnificent appearance I have ever\nseen. It was not at all dazzling, but had the melting shades, first of a\nsunrise and then of a gorgeous sunset. We had missed the gradual\nappearance of the phenomenon, but we had a good view of its highest\nsplendour. The colours were continually but slowly changing, and finally\nthe darker hues gradually suffused and dyed the pinks and crimsons.\n\nThe Earth was now about three times the diameter of a rising Full Moon,\nand the corona was about a quarter her width, and looked as if twenty\nshell-pink suns were set one against the other and overlapping all about\nthe edge of the dark orb.\n\n\"How do you know that is not really the extending edge of the Sun?\" I\nasked the doctor. \"Perhaps we are already far enough away to see it all\nabout the Earth like that.\"\n\n\"If that were really the Sun, the light from his extending edge would\nilluminate the surface of the Earth towards us. The planet's outline\nwould be irregular and partly glowing, but you see it is quite dull and\ndark, and the outline is most plainly visible.\"\n\nIn rapt attention I watched the delicate shell-pink change to a deeper\nhue of orange, and then our twilight waned a little and turned a sombre\ngrey. Presently the corona glowed a rich maroon, gradually dying to a\nluminous purple, which slowly deepened and darkened, and finally melted\ninto the general blackness. And lo! we were in the shadow again, and the\ndreamily beautiful panorama was over.\n\n\"It must have lasted nearly an hour,\" said the doctor. \"I am sorry we\ndid not notice the beginning, but it must have commenced with the same\ndull shades we saw at the end, and gradually changed to brighter\ncolours. I secured three negatives when the glow was most intense.\"\n\n\"Then we have had a waxing and a waning twilight coming together in the\nmiddle of our night. And the corona was like a sunrise, followed\nimmediately by a sunset,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"And why shouldn't it appear so?\" said the matter-of-fact doctor.\n\"Twilight is the commonest phenomenon of refraction with which we are\nacquainted, and sunrise and sunset are merely a mixture of refraction\nand reflection. There is nothing new about it.\"\n\n\"Now, Doctor, we must remain friends, but you shall not continually\ntarnish my poetry with your accursed science! I thank my Creator that\nHe made me ignorant enough to admire the beauties of nature. You are\ncontinually peeping behind the scenes, and pointing out the grease\npaints, the lime-lights and the sham effects. Let me enjoy the beauty of\nthe tableau, no matter how it is produced. I would give all of your pat\nknowledge for that feeling of profound awe which rises in the untutored\nbreast at beholding the magnificent grandeur of unfamiliar nature.\"\n\n\"When your ecstasy has quite passed, I shall appreciate a little cold\nmutton and biscuits, and then we must pump out again,\" he replied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTelling the Time by Geography\n\n\nAfter supper I went up into his compartment, and having arranged the\nbulkhead, began the tedious operation at the pump handle. It was a\nmatter of pure muscular strength, as the effort had to be made to lift\nthe handle, which snapped back sharply when released. I was working\nvigorously when I was suddenly struck dumb at seeing the handle break\noff just at the point of leverage, so that it was quite impossible to\noperate it. The doctor heard the handle fall, and looked around in great\nvexation.\n\n\"That means asphyxiation within twenty-four hours!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Which is plenty of time to think it over,\" I answered.\n\nAfter all, why was this pumping necessary? If a way could be devised to\nopen a valve, all the air would rush out of my compartment as easily as\nbeer runs out of a bung-hole. In fact, it did rush out a little at a\ntime, which is what made the handle go down of itself. But any such new\nvalve would have to be automatically closed, as it would be manifestly\nimpossible to enter and shut it. I kept on thinking, and finally began\nexamining the partition between the compartments. There seemed to be\nseveral long screws that went quite through it.\n\n\"Doctor, did you ever hear of those wise people who, after every\nfreshet, shipped the surplus water down the river in boats? Well, it\nstrikes me this air-pumping is just about as useless labour. Help me\npull in the bulkhead and I will show you something.\"\n\nI went at once to the cylinder we used for discharging things from the\nprojectile. With a pair of pliers I chipped off a small piece of the\nedge of the closing lid in two places, one near each end. This made two\nlittle irregular holes into the cylinder about eight inches apart. Then\nI pushed it half way out, so that one hole was outside and the other\ninside. Of course the air rushed through the inner hole into the\ncylinder, and thence through the outer hole to the exterior.\n\n\"Shut that thing!\" cried the doctor, when he saw what I had done. \"Do\nyou wish to suffocate us? That will let the air out perfectly, but how\nare you going to close it to admit the condensed air?\"\n\n\"People unskilled in these matters are so hasty!\" I said rather\nsarcastically. \"Wait until I have finished and you will see.\"\n\nI found he had a screw-driver, and I loosened one of the long screws\nand enlarged the half of its hole toward my compartment. Then I whittled\na block of soft wood, so that it would slide smoothly into this half of\nthe hole. Driving the screw home again, I just allowed its tip to enter\nthe end of the block. Then I fastened a piece of stout twine to the\ncylinder and the other end to the block of wood, which was almost\nopposite it. Pushing the cylinder half way out, I made the twine taut,\nand hastening into the doctor's compartment, I thrust in the bulkhead.\nThe air was rapidly escaping. Waiting long enough for all of it to have\nleaked out, I then unscrewed the long screw, which gradually drew in the\nblock of wood and the twine, and thus pulled the cylinder into the\nprojectile so that there was no connection with the exterior. Then the\ndoctor let in the condensed air to a barometric pressure of twenty-six,\nand the whole operation was over in a few minutes. My compartment must\nhave been almost a complete vacuum. When it was over, I cried rather\ntriumphantly to the doctor,--\n\n\"There, you see, one doesn't need a steam pump to make the water run\nover Niagara! At this distance from the surface, nature abhors a gas and\nprefers a vacuum!\" He was inclined to be rather sulky at first, but he\nreally did not like pumping any better than I did.\n\nI should say it was about five hours later that we noticed it was\ngrowing gradually lighter outside. Mars lost his ruddiness and grew\npale in a grey field. Our view of the Earth was also becoming more and\nmore misty.\n\n\"We are emerging from the black core of the shadow into the\nsemi-illuminated penumbra,\" said the doctor. Then he altered his course\nexperimentally, and found a slightly darker path, but it soon began\nchanging again to grey.\n\n\"There is no use trying to keep in the umbra any longer. It is growing\ntoo narrow. The penumbra will last quite a long time yet, but it will\ngradually get fainter and fainter. We shall not plunge at once into the\ndreadful light you fear so much. Keep your eyes glued to the Earth. I\ncan scarcely see Mars any longer. The whole field is getting blank and\nwhite.\"\n\nThe rear vista was also growing a pale white, and I could distinguish\nthe form of the Earth as a darker object slightly larger than a full\nmoon when risen. But it was all growing dimmer and dimmer as the\npenumbra faded toward the perfect light.\n\n\"Mars is completely gone now,\" said the doctor. \"The field of the\ntelescope is one pale curtain of light. I have steered to the left to go\nahead of him now, as there is no longer any reason for going behind\nhim.\"\n\nI heard him working at the telescope as if loosening it from its\nfastenings, but I dared not take my eyes from the Earth to see what he\nwas doing. Presently he called out to me,--\n\n\"Make room down there. I must bring the instrument down and observe the\nEarth now. Be careful you don't lose sight of her.\" But the instant he\nremoved the telescope from its bearings and uncovered his forward\nwindow, I lost all view of the Earth. The new light now entering by his\nwindow, from behind me, made it impossible to see so far.\n\n\"Too late!\" I cried; \"I have lost her! We are alone in limitless space,\nwithout even the company of the planets!\"\n\nBut while the doctor was carefully lowering the telescope, my eyes were\nstill searching, and presently I perceived a thin crescent of faintly\nbrighter light, growing gradually wider. It was like a new moon dimly\nseen in a clear part of the sky when the afternoon sun is cloud-hidden.\nThe doctor stopped to look where I pointed it out to him, and then\nchanged the wheel a little.\n\n\"That is a thin slice of the illuminated part of the Earth,\" he said.\n\"We can no longer see the dark side which has been visible to us while\nin the shadow. Fortunately our new course a little ahead of Mars will\ngive us a constant view of this thin crescent.\"\n\nWe now stood the instrument on end over the port-hole window, which\nbrought the small end near the aperture between the compartments. When\nthe doctor had secured a focus, he called me to look. The crescent was\ngreatly magnified, but the outline of the sphere on the other side could\nnot be seen, nor could anything be distinguished in the centre. Both\nthe outer and inner edges of the crescent were ragged and irregular in\nplaces, and there were faint darker spots on its surface. I called the\ndoctor's attention to the fact that the ragged appearance was always in\nthe form of extending teeth on the outer side of the crescent, and in\nthe form of notches eaten into its inner edge. He studied all these\nappearances carefully and finally said,--\n\n\"This crescent is that part of Earth which is just coming into morning.\nIt is gradually shifting from east to west with the Earth's rotation of\ncourse. What we see now, however, is _land_ almost from pole to pole.\nThere is a small sea just above the middle, which might be the\nMediterranean. Moreover, it must be mountainous land to cause the ragged\nedges and the shadows inside.\"\n\nThen he turned away to get his globe, and I took the place at the\ninstrument. He was slowly turning the globe and examining it\nthoughtfully as he said to himself,--\n\n\"The only continuous land from pole to pole with one interrupting sea\nmust be over the two Americas or over Europe and Africa. The American\nmountain ranges run from north to south, while through Europe and Africa\nthey are scarce, and almost uniformly run from east to west. Besides,\nthe sand of Sahara would be sure to show as a large, bright, regular\nspot. A section from longitude 70 to 80 west would include the Green\nMountains and the Alleghanies of North America and the Andes of South\nAmerica, and in that case the darker spot in the centre would be the\nCaribbean Sea.\"\n\n\"Look here!\" I cried. \"Toward the lower end the inner outline is growing\ndarker but more regular, and faint streaks or shadows reach through the\nbrighter light toward the dark greenish regular surface which looks like\nwater.\"\n\nHe observed closely and said,--\n\n\"Those shadows must be cast to westward by the enormous peaks of the\nAndes, and the dark greenish surface they reach toward must be the\nPacific Ocean.\"\n\nThen he consulted his globe while I looked. \"The first two to come into\nview,\" he said, \"would be the two great peaks in Bolivia, over\ntwenty-one thousand feet high.\"\n\n\"There _are_ two of them together,\" I said, \"and now others are rapidly\ncoming into view. There are five more scattered unequally, and then,\nlower down, three near together.\"\n\n\"Then there is not the slightest doubt that we see the Lower Andes,\" he\nsaid. \"These last you mention are scattered just as you say along the\nborder between Chili and Argentina, and the group of three are near\nValparaiso, the peak of Aconcagua being the tallest. But watch now for\nthe group in Ecuador, about midway between the top and bottom of the\ncrescent. There are four very large peaks and numerous smaller ones.\"\n\n\"The middle all looks bright yet, like land, with no shadows or greenish\nspots. But a queer thing is happening lower down, where the shadows have\nceased lengthening and are now fading. There are several fine points of\nlight just beyond the outer edge of the crescent. They are mere bright\nspecks, but gradually they join with the surface, making a rough toothed\nedge.\"\n\n\"Ah, that phenomenon has been observed upon the Moon,\" said he. \"That is\nthe sun shining on the snow-capped peaks first, and then, when the\ndiminutive outline of the mountain comes into view, it looks like a\ntooth.\"\n\n\"The same is happening all down the coast,\" I reported. \"Now I see it on\nthe lower group of three.\"\n\n\"Give me the instrument,\" demanded the doctor. \"That can be nothing but\nthe west coast of South America, and if that be the case, the whole\nthing will be repeated for the tall group in Ecuador, dominated by\nChimborazo.\"\n\nAs I surrendered the telescope to him, the whole lower part of the\ncrescent was dark, but with regular edges. Only in the middle, which\nshould have been about the Equator, and in the upper part, was there the\nbright lustre of land reflection. He watched for fully half an hour\nbefore observing anything remarkable. At last he exclaimed,--\n\n\"Now they are beginning! Five streaks near together and just at the\nEquator. They are almost equidistant from each other, and the next to\nthe lowest one is the longest. Now the top one begins to fade! Yes, and\na point of light has appeared detached from the outer edge, and now\nanother and another! They are growing inward toward the surface. Now\nthey are all connected like five saw teeth; the bottom one is the\nshortest, and that next very high one is old Chimborazo.\"\n\n\"Then it is morning at Quito and also at Pittsburg!\" I said, tracing up\nthe 80th meridian.\n\n\"Yes, and we have been one complete day and about five hours more\ntravelling the nine hundred thousand miles that lie between this and\nEarth,\" replied he.\n\n\"That makes us one full meal behind time,\" I said; \"but we have\ndiscovered a way to make the Andes call us for breakfast. When the\nPacific Ocean has passed from view, Japan and Australia shall strike\nnoon for us, and we will have supper and call it night when the Indian\nOcean is gone and darkest Africa has come into view!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nSpace Fever\n\n\nWe counted seven successive returns of the peaks of the Andes, and being\nby that time certainly six million miles from the Earth, we could\ndistinguish them no longer. Then followed what I remember as a very long\nand unspeakably monotonous period, without any adequate method of\nmarking the time. Our days became a full week long, for the only way we\ncould guess at the time was by the quarterings of the Moon. We could\nstill see her about the size of a marble in the telescope, and as her\ncrescent began to wane, and finally her light entirely disappeared, we\nknew she was then just between us and the Earth, and shining upon that\nplanet as a Full Moon. This was due to occur fifteen days after our\ndeparture. Then we watched her grow from a thin crescent to a bright\nquarter, and we knew another week had elapsed.\n\n\"We shall soon be able to determine one date with absolute certainty,\" I\nsaid to the doctor, when we must have been some twenty days out. \"I have\nbeen reading up your almanack, and I find there is a total eclipse of\nthe Sun by the Moon on June 29th.\"\n\n\"You might as well try to eclipse him with a straw-hat, as far as we are\nconcerned,\" he replied. \"The Moon will necessarily be on the further\nside of the Earth when that occurs, and the eclipse will barely reach\nthe Earth. It will fall short of us by a matter of some thirty million\nmiles!\"\n\nIt was soon after this that we gave up observing the Earth as a planet,\nput on our darkened lens, and proceeded to hold her as a spot in the Sun\na little to the left of his centre. The Moon remained a tiny spot of\nlight outside for a few days; but finally she entered the Sun also, and\nwas seen as a faint spot travelling toward the Earth-spot.\n\nAlthough the dazzling quality of the light, into which we had emerged\nafter the second day, was finally beginning to wane and pale a little,\nMars was still invisible. In fact, no stars or planets were visible;\nonly the gleaming Sun with the Earth-spot upon it. Our thermometer was\npoorly placed in the glare of the Sun at the rear; but it showed the\nheat was decreasing, and from a temperature of thirty-five degrees,\nobserved at the end of the second day, it had now fallen to twelve, and\nwas diminishing regularly about two degrees daily as nearly as we could\nreckon.\n\nOur appetites were steadily failing, and for two very good reasons: the\nunsuitable foods and the impossibility of getting any exercise. There\nwas no such thing as getting any healthy actions of the body. Nothing\nhad any weight, and such a thing as physical labour was impossible on\nthe face of it. I attempted to go through regular courses of gymnastics\nat frequent intervals; but as my body and its members weighed nothing,\nmy muscles found nothing whatever to expend their force upon. I thought\nmyself worse than Prometheus bound upon his rock, for he could at least\nstruggle with the birds of prey and pull upon his chains! I might as\nwell have been utterly paralyzed, and I actually began to fear that I\nshould lose all my strength, and that my muscles would forget their\ncunning.\n\nAnd our foods could not have been more unsuitable. The light vegetable\ndiet which this lack of exercise called for was impossible. We had never\nhad any fresh vegetables or fruits, and our tinned and canned supplies\nof these had been rapidly exhausted. We had plenty of solid, meaty foods\nand beef essences; but our systems did not require these, and at last\nabsolutely refused to have them. I lived for days at a time upon beer\nand biscuits, and looked longingly at my cigars. I believed I could have\nexisted comfortably and luxuriously upon smoke alone. My dreams were\nfilled with visions of ripe, luscious fruits and fresh, crisp\nvegetables. When I awoke, I loathed the only foods we had.\n\nI believe I should finally have given up eating, had I not hit upon a\nmethod of exercise at last. It was a sort of rowing or pulling machine,\nwhich I rigged up by running a bar through one end of the doctor's\nspring scales, and fastening the other end to the foot of my bed. I\npulled vigorously against this spring for hours at a time, and was\ndelighted to find that my strength had not left me, and that I could\neasily lift as much as these scales had been made to weigh. I remember\nthe returned appetite with which I enjoyed potted meat and a tinned\npudding, after the first hour of as vigorous exercise as our rarefied\nair would permit.\n\nThe Moon-spot had disappeared and gone to her eclipse behind the Earth,\nwhen an incident occurred to vary the monotony of our existence a\nlittle, and to suggest to me a diversion that had been hitherto\nforbidden. Our supply of water in the outer tank had long ago boiled\naway, and I had lighted the gas to heat water for the doctor's coffee. I\nhad taken the cup up to him and remained chatting with him, when\npresently I smelled something burning from the compartment below. I\ndescended quickly, and saw that my light bedclothes, which now weighed\nless than a feather, and often floated from their place, had been drawn\ninto the flame by the draft of the burning gas. They were floating about\nthe compartment now, all aflame and threatening to set fire to\neverything. We had not a drop of water to spare; but for once I thought\nof the right thing to do without hesitation. I pushed out the\nventilating cylinder, hurried back to the doctor's compartment and\nthrust in the bulkhead. Within two minutes all the air had escaped from\nmy room, and the fire had died for lack of oxygen. I waited a few\nminutes longer for the smoke to escape, and then we admitted condensed\nair, but only to the remarkably low pressure of eighteen. Within five\nminutes the compartment was ready again, and there was not a trace of\nsmoke or smell of fire to be perceived.\n\n\"I congratulate you on your quick perception and prompt action,\" said\nthe doctor when it was over.\n\n\"Quick rubbish!\" I exclaimed. \"I have been a dundering fool for four\nweeks by the Moon! I might just as well have been smoking ever since I\ncontrived this self-ventilating arrangement. The compartment becomes a\nperfectly clean vacuum at each operation, yet I had to wait for this bed\nclothing to catch fire before I could think of so simple a thing!\"\n\nIt was at the meal time just preceding the next changing of air that I\nopened the last tin of canned peas, as a sort of treat for the doctor to\noffset my expected revel in fragrant tobacco. I prepared half the\nquantity for him, but left my portion in the tin until I should be\nhungrier. With the prospects of a good smoke before me, I had no\nappetite for food. I put in the bulkhead to prevent the smoke from\nentering his compartment and lighted my Havana. Then I took Two-spot on\nmy lap and stretched myself for a reverie. On Earth, smoking time had\nbeen my period for reflection. And far back on that distant planet, what\nwere they doing now? In that one busy corner that had known me, they had\nprobably wondered at my disappearance for a day or two; but after the\nmonth that had passed I was certainly forgotten. There were few back\nthere whom I cared for, and not many had much reason to remember me. My\ninterests, my desires, my hopes were all ahead of me on a new planet.\nAnd what was waiting for me on Mars? Discovery, riches perhaps, and a\nmeasure of fame when I returned. Then I thought of the numberless\nproblems that the next few weeks must solve for us. Would there be\nintelligent inhabitants on Mars? Would they be in the forms of men or\nbeasts? Would they be civilized or savage? Would they speak a language,\nand how could we learn to communicate with them? Would they have foods\nsuitable to us; indeed, would the very air they breathed be fit to\nsustain our lives? Should we find them peaceable, or, if warlike, should\nwe be able to cope with them?\n\nThese thoughts were interrupted by the doctor, who called feebly to me\nto come up. \"Don't eat any of the peas,\" he said weakly. \"There was a\nqueer taste about them, and they have made me deathly sick.\"\n\nHe was very wretched, and grew rapidly worse. I immediately saw that it\nwas a severe case of poisoning, and I did everything I could to relieve\nhim, but he groaned in agony for several hours. Finally he fell asleep,\nbut his rest was disturbed by fits of delirium, in which he raved wildly\nin German mixed with English. As he slept I had time to think the matter\nover carefully. After all, it was a thing which required only simple\nremedies, and I had administered them. It was only a question of a\nlittle nursing and a careful diet, and he would be well again.\n\nBut his fever increased and his delirium became more frequent, and I\nbegan to appreciate that the derangement incident to the poisoning had\nprepared the way for a more serious illness. During his ravings I caught\na glimpse of the struggling and ambitious side of his nature, which he\nalways so carefully repressed.\n\nOnce I heard him mumble this to himself in German: \"Kepler perceived a\nlittle, he saw dimly; Newton comprehended the easy half; but Anderwelt,\nAnderwelt of Heidelberg, grasped the hidden meaning!\"\n\nIn spite of all my attentions (I did not then understand the nature of\nSpace Fever, of course), he was growing steadily worse, and I was\nbecoming desperate. I could not afford to have him ill long. The\ncurrents would probably continue to work fairly well until it became\nnecessary to reverse them, and that time was not far off. Unless they\nwere reversed exactly at the right moment, we might fall into the\nneutral spot and be held there for ever. Even if I managed to stop the\nnegative current, and succeeded in falling towards Mars, I could not\nregulate the positive current so as to temper our fall and make a safe\nlanding. It was equally dangerous to remain fixed in space, or to fall\nheadlong upon a planet and be smashed, or be buried miles deep if the\nprojectile did not collapse.\n\nI had no way of telling how much time passed, but it seemed to me a very\nlong period, and he grew steadily worse as we approached the neutral\npoint. I tried to rouse him from his delirium. I addressed him\njocularly, then commandingly, then beseechingly. And he answered me\nalways with reflections from that other side of his nature which one\nrarely saw when he was well.\n\n\"Hast thou seen red ants crawling upon a cherry? Such are the mere\ncircumnavigators of a globe! What! Hath not the world forgotten a\nColumbus? How long, then, will it remember---- Hast thou no cooler\nwater? This is tepid and bitter!\"\n\nEver since the last quarter of the Moon, which must have been ten days\nago, there had not been the slightest perceptible evidence of movement.\nThe standards by which we judge motion on the Earth had failed ever\nsince we left the atmosphere. There was no rushing or whizzing; we\npassed nothing; all the ordinary evidences of speed were absent. When\nyou lie in the state-room of a smoothly moving steamer, no forward\nmotion is perceptible. If you see another ship pass near by, you get a\nsudden surprising idea of the speed. If you watch the receding water,\nyou appear to be going forward slowly; and if you watch the spray at the\nbow or the wake astern, you appreciate the movement more fully. But if\nthe waves or the tide happen to be running with the ship, she has\napparently almost stopped, when really her speed has been somewhat\naccelerated. If you watch the distant stars, you can scarcely perceive\nany motion at all; and if the clouds should be moving in the same\ndirection as the ship, her motion appears reversed.\n\nWe had none of these things by which to judge, and we appeared to be\nhanging perfectly still in space, though the doctor had assured me we\nwere travelling at least five hundred miles a minute. This was rational,\nas it agreed with the diminishing size of the Earth; but it required an\neffort of faith on my part to believe that we had been moving at all.\n\nBut suppose we should gradually lose our speed and stop in a neutral\npoint, how should I know it? The Earth now was, and had been for ten\ndays, a mere spot on the Sun. While Mars had been visible, he had never\nincreased in size in the telescope, and he was now invisible. The only\nway I could tell would be to wait until after many days had elapsed, and\nif Mars did not finally come into view, I should know something was\nwrong. But it would be too late then; there would be no winds or tides,\nno weight or buoyancy, nothing to move us out of that dreadful calm\nwhere even gravity does not exist. That must be avoided at every cost!\nBut might we not be very near it now? Weight had been practically\nnothing for a month, within an hour it might be positively nothing,\nand----\n\nThe doctor's mutterings interrupted these thoughts. \"The power with\nwhich to travel was so simple and so vast! It all lay hidden in that\nelementary law of magnetism, like poles repel and unlike poles attract.\nBut the road to travel and the problems by the way, those were the hard\nthings!\"\n\nHe was putting them all in the past tense, as if he had already solved\nthem! But what was that law of magnetism he mentioned? Perhaps he would\nreveal his secrets to me in his ravings! I must mark every word he said;\nfor it was clear I must solve the problem, he would not be well in time.\nI must brush the cobwebs from my meagre science and struggle with his\ninvention.\n\n\"Unlike poles attract,\" he had said. Then Earth and matter must normally\nhave unlike poles, and to make Earth repel matter it would only be\nnecessary to change the polarization of the matter. Yes, he had told me\nit was all accomplished by polarizing the steel and iron of the\nprojectile! When they were made the same pole as the Earth, then she\nrepelled them. But if the whole thing were so simple, why had it never\nbeen discovered before? Ah, that is the strong shield behind which\nincredulity always takes refuge!\n\nI ventured near the gravity apparatus and examined it carefully. There\nwas a small thing which looked like the switchboard of a telegraph\noffice. The perforations in it were all in a row, and the ten holes were\nnow filled with little brass pegs, which were suspended from above on\nsmall spiral springs. These were evidently the points of communication\nof the negative current to the framework of the projectile. It certainly\nwould do no harm to pull out one of these pegs, as that would only\nslightly diminish the current. At least I would risk it. My fingers had\nscarcely closed upon the brass, when I was given such a violent shock as\nto be thrown powerfully across the compartment; and had my body weighed\nanything, my bones would certainly have been broken by the concussion.\nMy arm and shoulder did not recover from the stinging and deadening\nsensation for some time. I noted the little peg I had pulled out hanging\nby its spiral spring just above the hole it had filled. It would be\nworth my life to remove the other nine in the same way.\n\nBesides, how would I know when the time came to remove them? My eyes\nfell upon the two large leaden balls suspended from short copper\nchains. I had seen these before, but now I thought I understood them.\nThey would swing whichever way gravity attracted. They hung down toward\nmy compartment now, and if we ever passed the dead line, they would hang\nforward toward Mars. But in the neutral point what would they do? When\nthe gravity of planets neutralized each other, the steel of the\nprojectile would repel these balls towards its centre, which would tend\nto put them both in the same spot and thus bring them together.\nMoreover, they would slightly attract each other. Yes, it was quite\ncertain that these had been devised as a Gravity Indicator, and they\nwould tell me when we were approaching a dead line, when we were in it,\nand when it was safely passed. But all that would do me but little good\nunless I could manage the currents.\n\nI sat thinking this over a long time, when it suddenly occurred to me\nthat the doctor would recognise, even in his delirium, the importance of\naction when these two balls came together. As soon as they had\napproached each other, I must lift him up and show them to him. The\nbrain that had made them would know their meaning, and know how to act\neven in illness! Perhaps I was like a drowning man clutching at a straw;\nbut from the moment I thought of this I believed firmly that the\nsolution of the whole problem would come in this manner. My hopes were\nready to hang on the slightest peg. It consoled me to remember some\ninstances where men temporarily insane had been brought to consciousness\nby impending danger, or by the sight of what last weighed upon their\nmind.\n\nWhen I glanced at the balls next, I saw that their chains lacked an inch\nof being parallel. They were already moving slowly inward toward each\nother. I noted that the chains, which ran through the balls and were\nconnected with a small copper plate on the bottom of each, were just\nlong enough to allow the bottom edges to touch, if they were drawn as\nfar toward each other as possible.\n\nThe doctor's fever was at its very worst, but that did not dampen my\nhopes. The balls were gradually drawing nearer together. I wished them\nto be quite close before I made the supreme trial which was to liberate\nus or leave us prisoners in space for ever! Presently I loosened the\nknotted sheets which held him to his bed, and lifted the feverish man,\nas I might have carried a doll, and brought him in full view of the\napproaching balls.\n\n\"Doctor, listen now and look,\" I said firmly and commandingly.\n\n\"Always stubborn and unbelieving!\" he raved. \"I must take it to a new\ncountry, to America, where they invent things themselves, and are\nwilling to listen, and anxious to try!\"\n\n\"Doctor, don't you know me? It is I, Werner, who helped you. This is a\ncrisis for us! Do you see those approaching balls? You know what they\nmean! You must save us.\"\n\n\"Thou'rt too busy, like all the rest! Why, then, remember that to-morrow\nwill despise those who are so busy with to-day! Opportunity has knocked\nand listened for thee and thou hast bade her begone!\"\n\n\"Listen, Doctor. I am he who heard you and gave you the pink cheque. I\nam he who refused three times to go with you and then came at last. I am\nhe who was afraid of the light, who dodged the Moon, and chaffed you\nabout the pump. Do you not remember it all? Come, you are no longer ill.\nThere is work to do. Have you forgotten the leaden balls? See! they are\ntouching each other now, and we are in the dead-line, the neutral spot,\nthe one danger of the trip which you acknowledged.\"\n\nBut it was useless. He remembered nothing, his eyes were dim and vacant,\nand the great brain that had planned all this was overthrown by fever.\nThe experiment had failed and we were lost!\n\nI tied him gently back on his bed and turned in desperation to the\napparatus, deciding to risk my life to pull out those nine pegs with my\nhands, one after another.\n\nMy God! they were already out! Every one of them was hanging by its\nspiral spring, just above the hole it had filled. The switchboard had\nopened a little and released them. It was all automatic! The contact of\nthe copper surface of the balls had completed a short circuit which cut\nthe negative current. He had thought of it all, even to this emergency,\nand the machine could take care of itself!\n\nAnd in the wave of thankfulness and rejoicing which swept over me, I\nsank on my knees and kissed the forehead of the feverish old man again\nand again!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Mystery of a Minus Weight\n\n\nIt was the doctor himself who gave the name Space Fever (now so\ngenerally adopted) to the peculiar malady from which he suffered in that\nlong period when weight was very slight or nothing at all. A little\nreflection on the physiological bearings of the conditions we were\npassing through, will serve to explain the illness.\n\nFor the period of a month, owing to the impossibility of effort, there\nwas scarcely any wasting of our bodily tissues, and very little need for\noxydization of the blood. The limbs, which the heart really works\nhardest to serve, did scarcely any labour and needed very little blood.\nBut the heart had its stubborn habits the same as the other muscles. It\nis a high-pressure engine, and there is no way of slowing it down\nmaterially. It kept up its vigorous pumping and driving just as if the\ngreat muscles of the limbs had wasted and needed building up, and just\nas if it had the task of forcing the blood through those parts of the\nbody usually compressed by its weight or strained by the effort of\ncarrying it. The result was much the same as if your heart now should\nsuddenly begin to beat much too fast, the blood was heated into a state\nof fever, which naturally increased as we lost weight, culminated at the\ndead-line and began decreasing as soon as we commenced having a weight\ntoward Mars. It was only my fortunate invention of a method of exercise,\nand my religious adherence to it, which saved me from a similar attack.\n\nBut many things happened before the doctor recovered consciousness. The\nMoon had re-appeared on the other side of the Earth-spot, the light\nabout us had grown less dazzling than sunlight on Earth, and the\ntemperature had fallen to four degrees. It was perhaps two days after\npassing the dead-line that, as I was gazing carefully out of the forward\nwindow, I saw far to the right of us a large circular patch of faintly\nredder light in the general curtain of white. Its size quite startled\nme, for it was rather larger than a full moon, and I had expected Mars\nto re-appear as a very bright star before we could distinguish any disc\nwith the naked eye. This misapprehension probably arose from the fact\nthat I had thought the dead-line about half way between the two planets,\nwhich upon reflection I saw to be impossible, as it must be much nearer\nthe smaller planet.\n\nThe outline of the planet was not clearly visible yet, but I could not\nhave missed seeing that red glow long before, had it been more directly\nin front of us. Evidently we were steering much ahead of the planet,\nwhich indicated that we were arriving before opposition. I immediately\nchanged our course so as to go more nearly toward it, but yet to keep a\nlittle ahead. Then I hastily brought the telescope back to the forward\ncompartment, which was now the bottom of the projectile. The lenses\neasily pierced the curtain of light that seemed to be hung in front of\nthe new planet, and I could distinguish the outline of the greatly\nmagnified orb very clearly.\n\nJudging from appearances, it could not be farther from us than twice the\ndistance of the Moon from the Earth. I resorted to the scales at once,\nand found that weight was beginning slowly to return, for I weighed a\nlittle less than an ounce. From a rule the doctor had explained to me, I\ncalculated that this indicated a distance from the planet of about four\nhundred thousand miles, if it really was Mars. But I had some doubts\nabout its really being that planet; for a clear white, irregular-shaped\nspot upon it, which I had noticed as soon as the telescope was focussed,\ndid not appear to move at all, as it should have done had it been upon a\nrotating planet. Upon closer observation, I detected a dull, greenish\nspot, just coming upon the lower edge. But when I looked again a bright\nwhite and perfectly circular spot had appeared in the same place and\ncovered it up. But this new white spot travelled much more rapidly, and\nsoon uncovered the greenish spot, which seemed to move in the same path,\nbut much more slowly. This was something I could not understand. The\nwhite circle was too bright and regular to be a cloud, yet if they were\nboth on the surface how could one travel faster over the same path?\n\nVery soon the white circle passed entirely across the greater orb, and\nthen I was surprised to see it detach itself from the planet and remain\nfor a few moments as a separate small orb in the sky! Could this be\nanother freak of refraction? But before I could determine, the little\norb disappeared behind the greater disc and was gone. The greenish spot,\nwhich I judged to be truly on the surface and caused by an ocean or\ngreat sea, was about three times as long in crossing the disc. I next\nturned my attention to the immovable and irregular white spot, and\ndiscovered that its edges seemed to be revolving slowly around its\ncentre. Then it occurred to me that this spot must be located at one of\nthe poles and be caused by polar ice and snows. The doctor had expected\nsuch on Mars, and I no longer doubted that this was our objective\nplanet.\n\nIt was like a great holiday for me when the doctor regained\nconsciousness. Almost as soon as his fever abated he was well enough to\nperform his customary duties. His illness had not made him appreciably\nweak, because as yet scarcely any effort was required to move about. He\nwas quite as anxious to hear all my experiences as I was eager to\nrelate them. I gave him a full account of my struggle passing the\ndead-line, of my discovery of Mars, and the various spots I had noted.\n\n\"From the time it took the greenish spot to cross, I should judge a\nMartian day to be about fifty hours long,\" I said.\n\n\"Then you _must_ have been very lonely,\" he replied. \"For a Martian day\nis just forty-one minutes longer than an Earthly day, unless a great\nnumber of our scientists have continually made the same mistake in\nobserving him.\"\n\n\"When we arrive, we shall be able to determine the point exactly if our\nwatches commence running again,\" I answered. \"But I think I know one\nreason why I have misjudged the time. Ever since you have been ill I\nhave slept very little. I have hardly felt the need of rest since I lost\nmy weight. I have been growing more and more wakeful, and I rarely sleep\nmore than an hour at a time. That seems quite sufficient to refresh me.\"\n\n\"As we regain our weight we shall feel the need of sleep again,\" he\nsaid. \"But on Mars we may need but one-third as much as we had on Earth,\nunless we exert ourselves proportionately more.\"\n\nThen I told him about the circular spot which had seemed to slip off the\nupper edge of Mars, and asked his explanation of it.\n\n\"That must have been Phobos, one of the moons of Mars,\" he said.\n\n\"One of his moons!\" I exclaimed; \"I didn't know he had _any_.\"\n\n\"You are an American, and say that!\" he answered in surprise. \"It is one\nof the astronomical glories of your people that they discovered the two\nmoons of Mars, during the favourable opposition of 1877.\"\n\n\"This is the first case I remember where we have left it to a foreigner\nto tell us how great we have been!\" I laughed.\n\n\"These two moons of Mars also furnish a most interesting example of how\nfiction may forestall and pre-figure actual scientific discovery. Dr.\nSwift made Gulliver, in his wonderful travels, discover two moons of\nMars, revolving at a speed which he must have thought ridiculously fast.\nMany years afterward the American telescopes really found two moons, but\nactually revolving more rapidly than Dr. Swift had dared to boast! If\nyour white circle was really Phobos, you have seen the freak among\nsatellites. She is the smallest, swiftest moon ever discovered, and\ntravels so much more swiftly than the revolution of her primary that she\nappears to go opposite to everything else in the Martian sky, rising\nwhere the Sun sets and crossing the heavens from west to east!\"\n\n\"What I saw did travel in the same direction as the rotation of the\nplanet, and much more rapidly,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Then it was Phobos without a doubt, and she is due to appear again in\nthe west in three hours and fifty minutes after she sets in the east. We\nmust watch closely, for I wish to land upon her and make a flying trip\nall around Mars with her. Do you realize what a glorious view we shall\nhave of the great planet, sailing around him on this satellite in a\nperiod of a little over seven and a half hours, and at a distance of\nonly about four thousand miles? There will be no night, for if one side\nof the little moon is heavier than the other, the heavier side will\nalways be turned toward Mars. Therefore, when the Sun does not shine on\nPhobos, Mars will do so, and keep her continually illuminated, except\nfor the brief period of the regular eclipse during each revolution. And\none-fourth of the entire heavens, as seen from Phobos, will be filled\nwith the glowing orb of Mars! The great planet will exhibit to us at a\nnear range all the configurations of his surface, his oceans and his\nclouds. We will survey and photograph him to our hearts' content.\"\n\nThe doctor was justly enthusiastic on this subject, and I felt that such\na landing would, in some measure, compensate for my disappointment in\nnot being able to visit the Moon.\n\nAs I watched carefully, the satellite finally came into view, but very\nmuch more distant from Mars than before. Also, it moved very slowly now,\nand seemed to grow larger as it approached the disc. I pointed it out to\nthe doctor, and remarked that it was acting quite differently. Just as\nit entered upon the orb of Mars, another moon, somewhat smaller, mounted\nhurriedly from the under side of the planet and began hastily ploughing\nher way over the ruddy disc.\n\n\"That last one is the one I saw before, that is my Phobos!\" I cried\nexcitedly.\n\n\"Then the other slow one is Deimos, the outer moon. She appears the\nlarger to us now, because her greater distance from Mars makes her\nnearer to us, but she appears to the Martians as the smaller. We must\nobserve closely, and we may discover some new and lesser satellites\nwhich Earthly telescopes have never found.\"\n\n\"Time enough for that when we land on Mars,\" I answered. \"If we get in\npast these two without being hit, I shall be satisfied. You dare not\nventure in front of that Phobos, and I don't see how you can ever\novertake her if you approach from behind.\"\n\n\"That reminds me to slacken speed, for we must be getting very near,\" he\nsaid. \"Please weigh yourself every few minutes and note your increasing\nweight. You should weigh seventy-two pounds on Mars, and eight pounds at\nthe distance of Phobos.\"\n\nHe immediately reversed currents, and when I reported that I weighed\nalmost a pound, it frightened him, and he turned in the full power of\nthe negative currents to overcome our momentum. And it proved that the\nrepelling power of Mars at the distance of 15,000 miles, which this\nindicated, was not at all strong against the great velocity we had been\ndaily acquiring. I hung upon the scales every few minutes, and reported\na steadily increasing weight up to three pounds.\n\n\"That shows a distance of eight thousand miles,\" he figured. \"Almost\nexactly in the orbit of Deimos, but she has safely passed, and will not\nreturn for thirty hours. We must turn the rudder hard over to the right,\nand sail around the planet in a circle until Phobos overtakes us; then,\nif we approach her travelling in the same direction at almost the same\nrate of speed, her gravitational attraction will pick us up and draw us\nsafely ashore.\"\n\nMars was already an enormous orb ahead of us, and many of his features,\nsuch as oceans, ice-caps, and continents, could easily be distinguished;\nbut we paid little attention to them, being occupied with making a safe\nlanding on Phobos, and expecting to make a systematic study of him from\nthere.\n\n\"We must not attempt a landing on the outer side of the satellite,\" the\ndoctor reflected, \"for we should have no way of getting around to the\ninner side to make our observations. We must go within her orbit, and\nthen as she comes past allow her attraction to draw us gently toward\nher.\"\n\nWe had quickly overtaken and passed Deimos, far within her orbit. I was\nkeeping a close watch for Phobos out of the rear window as we circled\nabout Mars at a distance which we calculated, from my weight on the\nscales, must be within the path of the satellite. We were circling in\nthe same direction that the great planet was rotating, and yet we passed\nby things on his surface, which proved that we were travelling faster\nthan his rotation. The doctor noticed, with his telescope, a brilliant\nsnow-capped peak of a great mountain towering up from a small island.\nThe contrast of the snow peak, with the darkish green waters all around\nit, was the most pronounced thing visible on the great planet, and he\ndecided this must be the white spot detached from the polar ice which\nour astronomers have frequently observed at about twenty-five degrees\nsouth latitude, and to which they have given the name Hall's Island.\n\n\"I am afraid we have not appreciated the speed at which we have been\ntravelling,\" remarked the doctor. \"Phobos is very slow in overtaking\nus;\" and he was just beginning to slacken speed still more, when he\nsuddenly cried out,--\n\n\"Here she is ahead of us now! We have overtaken her, instead of waiting\nfor her to catch us!\"\n\nAnd, true enough, we were gradually approaching a small brownish mass,\nfeebly illuminated on its outer half by the sun, and more faintly still\non its inner half by reflected light from Mars.\n\nAnd how shall I describe that queer little toy-world which we were\ngradually overtaking? Imagine, if you can, a little island, less than a\nthird the size of the Isle of Wight, tossed a few thousand miles into\nspace, and circling there rapidly to avoid falling back upon the greater\nsphere. Imagine that flying island devoid of soil, of trees or\nvegetation, of water or air, of everything but barren, uncrumbled,\nhomogeneous rock, and you have some idea of the unadorned desolation of\nPhobos, into which we were slowly sailing, or falling. There was not\neven the slightest trace of sand or scraps of rock, such as time must\nhave abraded from even the hardest surfaces, but the reason for this\nsoon became apparent.\n\nThe doctor feared steering directly against her as we approached, lest\nwe should land with a crash. We had already reached her and were\ntravelling along her inner side. Although we were very near her, she\nseemed to have very little attraction for us. Then he turned very much\ncloser, but as soon as the influence of the rudder was released, we\nseemed to leave her instead of falling upon her as we expected. We were\nstill travelling faster than she was, and had we steered directly\nagainst her, we would have crashed and bumped against her protuberances.\nStill there seemed to be no other way to make a landing. In order to\nestimate the amount of such a shock, the doctor calculated, from the\nbest information he had of her size and a guess at her density, that she\nwould attract the projectile and its entire load with a force of only\ntwo pounds. That was not enough to cause any very great shock, and he\ndecided to take chances at once, before we had entirely passed her. He\nturned the rudder hard over toward the satellite, and we came against\nher with scarcely any crash, but with a bumping and grating that\ncontinued until the rudder was eased back. Then, to our great surprise,\nwe did not remain on the surface, but rose from it and sailed inward\ntowards Mars.\n\n\"Something wrong here!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"She has no attraction for\nus.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you explain this?\" I asked. \"You say the whole projectile\nweighs only two pounds toward Phobos, when, just a short time ago, I\nweighed nearly eight pounds myself on the scales.\"\n\n\"True enough!\" he cried; \"the gravity of Mars must be dominant.\" He\nbegan figuring rapidly, and then exclaimed: \"We weigh one hundred and\nthirty pounds toward Mars, and only two pounds toward the satellite.\nSmall wonder that we could not make a landing, with Mars pulling us away\nsixty-five times harder than Phobos attracted us! But this is very\nstrange! I remember no mention of this in any of the astronomical\nwritings, and it is as easily calculable on Earth as it is here.\nMoreover, this must cause everything that is loose upon Phobos to fall\nupon Mars. The great planet is tugging at everything the satellite has\nwith a force sixty-five times stronger than her own!\"\n\n\"Now, I am afraid those figures won't do, Doctor,\" I put in. \"For, if\nwhat you say is true, what prevents the whole satellite from tumbling\ninto Mars at once?\"\n\n\"She would do so were it not for centrifugal force. The speed with which\nshe whirls around the planet must just balance the force with which he\nattracts her, and thus she is kept in her orbit. But stones and loose\nthings on this side of her centre are attracted more strongly by Mars\nthan they are repelled by the whirling, so they must all have fallen to\nthe planet. That is why the surface was perfectly barren. If Phobos\nalways keeps the same side turned toward Mars, there may be rocks and\nsoil on the outer side, and we could land there with a positive current;\nbut we could not see the great planet, as I had hoped.\"\n\n\"I have had quite enough of this moon-chasing,\" I said; \"let us be off\nfor the large game at once!\" and the doctor agreeing, we turned directly\ntoward Mars.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nOther World Life\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nWhy Mars gives a Red Light\n\n\nOur telescope was now pointed exactly at Mars, and we were observing\nevery feature as we approached him. Compared with the illuminated\ncrescent of the Earth, which we had studied when we were observing the\nAndes, our present view was infinitely vaster and more comprehensive. We\nwere approaching the illuminated side of a planet, whereas we had then\nbeen rapidly receding from the dark side of one partly lighted at its\nedge. In our new vista there were remarkably few clouds. There were a\nfew pale mists here and there over the seas, but no such heavy, black\nmasses as had frequently obscured the Earth.\n\nOn Mars there were fewer large bodies of water, and a very much greater\nproportion of land. In fact, about the Equator, whither we were\nsteering, there seemed to be a broad, uninterrupted zone of land, with\noccasional bays or inlets cutting into it, but never crossing it. An\nopen sea of considerable proportions surrounded the great ice-cap at\neach pole, and it was apparently thus possible to travel entirely\naround the globe, either by sea or by land, as one might choose.\n\n\"Behold again the infinite wisdom of the Creator!\" cried the doctor.\n\"Although Mars is a much smaller planet than our own, it is fitted for\nalmost as large a population. The land is nearly all grouped about the\nEquator, where it is warm enough to live comfortably. On the contrary,\non Earth there is no important civilization under the Equator, and most\nof the land is favourably located in the north temperate zone. On Earth\nthe intervention of great oceans between the continents kept the\npopulation restricted to Asia and Egypt for centuries, and to the Old\nWorld for a still longer time. But here, this band of continuous land\nhas made it easy and natural to explore the whole globe, and its\ninhabitants have had ample time and opportunity to distribute\nthemselves.\"\n\nBut by far the most wonderful thing that we had been observing for a\nlong time, and which became more remarkable as we approached, was that\nthe entire planet, seas and continents alike, gave off a reddish light.\nThis tinge of red had been visible ever since we had left the Earth.\nMuch further back we had observed that it seemed to extend a little\nbeyond the outline of Mars, and we now saw that even the white light\nfrom the snow-caps had a faint tinge of red.\n\n\"For centuries the ruddy light of this planet has been remarked,\" said\nthe doctor. \"His very name was given him because of his gory, warlike\nappearance. Scientists have attempted to explain it by supposing that\nhis vegetation is uniformly red, instead of green like ours. Still\nothers, objecting that his vegetation could not possibly be rank or\nplentiful, or continue the same colour through all seasons, have\nsupposed that his soil or prim\u00e6val rock is of a deep red colour. But\nneither of these suppositions explain why his seas should give off a\nreddish light mixed with their green, or why the pure white of polar\nsnows should be tinged with crimson.\"\n\nWe must have been still two hundred miles above the surface when the\nbarometer began to rise feebly, indicating that we were already entering\nthe Martian atmosphere; and, as we proceeded, the reddish glow spread\nall around us, and was even dimly visible behind as well as in front. We\nwere still travelling too rapidly to plunge into the denser atmosphere\nor attempt a landing. Besides, we wished to explore the planet, and find\nlife and civilization before choosing a landing place. And as we drew\nnearer, in a constantly narrowing circle, that red haze was all about us\neverywhere.\n\n\"There can be but one explanation of it,\" said the doctor at last. \"This\nred is a colour in the Martian atmosphere. It seems very strange and\nalmost impossible to us; but we must prepare ourselves for extremely\nunusual and even apparently impossible things.\"\n\nBut this seemed to disturb the doctor greatly, as also did the fact that\nwe could no longer breathe with comfort the rare air which we had not\nfound objectionable far back in space. Our returning weight made\nphysical effort again necessary, and we were able to exert ourselves but\nlittle without panting and gasping. The rarest air we had used had shown\na pressure of fourteen, and we were now compelled to increase this to\neighteen in order to be comfortable.\n\n\"This Martian air is sure to give us trouble,\" the doctor said to me\nafter considerable reflection. \"In the first place, its red colour makes\nme fear it is not composed of the same gases that our air is. If it\nshould turn out to be a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, like ours, there\nis the possibility that this red matter which gives it colour will be\npoisonous to us. And even if it is not harmful, I do not think the air\nwill have a pressure above ten or eleven, and we seem to need eighteen\nor twenty for comfort. I shall be very sorry if we have to return at\nonce; but our supply of air is limited, you know.\"\n\n\"You keep a close watch through your telescope for those flying men you\npromised to show me,\" I answered. \"If they can live in this air, I think\nwe can manage it somehow. I will not go back while there is a breath\nleft in me.\"\n\nBut as we drew nearer and nearer to the surface we did not discover the\nslightest sign of habitation. As far as we could see there was a great\ndesert, barren of all vegetation, and apparently unwatered since\ncreation. Our telescope did not detect the existence even of animals or\ncreeping things.\n\n\"The wisdom of the Creator is probably quite as profound, but certainly\nnot as apparent just here as it was somewhat farther back,\" I ventured.\n\n\"We must search over the whole surface of the globe until we find smoke\nrising,\" said the doctor. \"That is the sure sign of intelligent life on\nEarth. There has hardly been a tribe of the lowest savages there which\ndid not know how to light a fire, and this knowledge would be far more\nessential on a cold planet like this. Wherever we find smoke we shall\nfind those intellectual creatures, corresponding to men on our planet.\"\n\nPresently, far ahead of us, we discerned a small black cloud rapidly\ncrossing our path. As we approached we examined it through the\ntelescope, and soon saw that it was nothing less than an enormous flock\nof swiftly-flying small grey birds. This was our first acquaintance with\nwhat we afterwards found to be the predominating form of animal life on\nthe planet. But the swift-winged cloud bore away from us, as if fleeing\nfrom the desert, and was soon lost to view.\n\nIt was not long after this that we perceived a broad stripe of\nbrilliant green extending down into the dull expanse of the desert. In\nthe middle of this verdant zone there was a weaving silver ribbon, which\ncould be nothing else than a great river, along whose banks we could\ndiscern hundreds of hovering or wading birds, hopping lugubriously, or\nspreading their broad wings in a low flight.\n\nAs we now lowered rapidly to examine the soil more closely, we saw that\nwe were approaching some great geometrical masses of hewn rock, whose\nregularity of design indicated that they were buildings of some sort. We\nat once decided to land and investigate these, even if we had to take up\nour search for intelligent life later.\n\nWe remarked that none of these enormous structures were square, or with\nright-angled corners, such as we were used to. They all seemed to be a\ncombination or multiplication of a single design, which was nothing more\nthan a massive triangular wall, with its right angle on the ground and\nits acute angle at the top. Sometimes two were built together, with\ntheir perpendicular surfaces joining; again, four were joined in the\nsame manner, and one very large one was composed of twelve of these,\nradiating from a common centre, which, if they had quite joined each\nother, would have formed a gigantic cone.\n\nI took another look at the tall, slender birds down the river, and\nremarked to the doctor,--\n\n\"These great structures are no birds' nests! You can't make me believe\nwinged men would build with stone. These look more like giants'\nplaythings than anything else.\"\n\n\"They appear to me like the gnomons of enormous sundials,\" remarked the\ndoctor; \"and, indeed, their uses must certainly be astronomical. With\nthese one can not only tell the time, but the ascension and meridian of\nthe sun and stars, and therefore the months and seasons.\"\n\nWe lowered and circled about above the largest one, which had twelve of\nthe triangular walls built in circular form, with their common\nperpendicular line in the centre and their acute angles at the\ncircumference. On closer observation, the twelve slanting sides, which\nradiated from the common peak, had a tubular appearance, and we were\nsoon able to look down through almost a hundred great cylindrical\nchambers, which ran from a common opening at the top, slanting at every\ndifferent angle down to the surface.\n\n\"These are nothing more than great, immovable masonry telescopes, for\nwatching the stars in their courses!\" cried the doctor. \"Look, there is\none perpendicular cylinder for observing just when a star or planet\ncomes directly overhead, and these scores of other cylinders, at\ndifferent angles, successively afford a view of a given constellation as\nit rises and then declines.\"\n\n\"Then they have built a separate masonry telescope, pointing in almost\nevery conceivable direction, instead of having one movable telescope to\ntake any direction,\" said I.\n\nThe wonderful size and massive construction of these was very striking,\nrivalling the pyramids of Egypt in their ponderous and enduring\ncharacter. They were located on a raised plateau, whence the view in all\ndirections was quite unobstructed. We came gently to land in the midst\nof them. To the rear, whence we had come, I could see the desolate waste\nof the desert. From the forward window we observed that the peaceful\nriver kept a straight course from the cataract where it plunged over the\nplateau, through the green valley, between level banks, as far as we\ncould see; and just at the foot of our plateau restfully nestled a city,\nwhose massive and towering structures reached almost to our level. With\nthe aid of the telescope we saw beings moving slowly about. Their form\nwas upright and unwinged, but more than this we could not see. The\ndeliberation and stately dignity of their movements comported perfectly\nwith the majestic city wherein they dwelt.\n\n\"At last we have arrived at the boundaries of Martian civilization,\"\nexclaimed the doctor. \"We will rest here and test the atmosphere; and if\nit permits us, we will then venture forth to measure our skill and\nknowledge against this race of builders. I hazard a guess that we will\nexcel them in many things, for they are apparently only at the\nperfection of their Stone Age, while we finished that long ago, and have\nsince passed through the Ages of Iron and of Steam, and are now at the\ndawn of the Era of Magnetism and Gravitation. Our minds are more fertile\nand elastic, for with this little movable telescope we probably obtain\nbetter results than they have done with their years of toiling\ncalculation and patient building.\"\n\n\"You will be sadly disappointed if they so far excel us that they eat us\nup at two mouthfuls,\" said I. \"As they move about yonder, they impress\nme as being full of power.\"\n\n\"They are as sluggish as elephants,\" he replied. \"We are certainly more\nrapid in thought and action, and it is highly probable that we shall\nexcel them in physical strength, as we have been built for three times\nas heavy muscular tasks as they.\"\n\n\"Still, if we cannot make them understand that we come peaceably as\nfriends, they may attempt to kill us as the quickest solution of the\nquestion. And they are a whole race against two of us,\" said I, just\nbeginning to realize all the difficulties that were yet ahead of us.\n\n\"Unless they are a very intelligent and magnanimous race, they will\nprobably attempt to take us prisoners,\" he answered. \"It is the mark of\nan enlightened nation to welcome strangers whose powers are unknown. A\nprimitive race fears everything it does not understand, and force is\nits only argument against a superior intelligence.\"\n\nThereupon I immediately began a thorough overhauling of all the arms and\nammunition, while the doctor prepared to test the air. There was a tone\nof confident exultation in his voice when he spoke again.\n\n\"This redness of the air will not trouble us a whit. Look! you can see\nno tinge of red between here and that huge wall yonder, nor anywhere\nalong the ground as far as you can see. It is so slight a colouring that\nit is only noticeable in vast reaches of atmosphere, like the blue\ncolour in our own air. See here, where a small cloud obscures the sky\nthere is no ruddy tinge. There is no more colouring-matter in this than\nthere is indigo in our own air. The amount of it is so infinitely small\nthat it will never trouble us. Now, if it only contains oxygen enough,\nwe are sure of life in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, if they will leave us alive to breathe it,\" I added, counting out\nseventeen cartridges for each rifle.\n\n\"The air outside shows a pressure of only eleven, while we have eighteen\ninside,\" he said. \"I will bring in the discharging cylinder full of the\nouter air, and by keeping it upside down the lighter air will remain in\nit. Then, if a candle flame will burn steadily in it, the oxygen we need\nis there.\"\n\nSuiting the action to the word, he carefully drew in the inverted\ncylinder, and cautiously brought a lighted candle into it. To our great\ndelight the flame burned for a moment with a brighter, stronger light\nthan it did in the air of the compartment.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the doctor, as happily as if he had just earned the\nright to live. \"It seems to have more oxygen than our own air, which\nwill make up for the lesser density.\"\n\nThen he put the lighted candle in the cylinder, and quickly discharged\nit outside upon the ground where we could see it. The flame had almost\ntwice the brilliancy that it had had inside.\n\n\"Our scientists who have sneered at the possibility of life on Mars,\nbecause of its rare atmosphere, have overlooked the simplicity of the\nproblem. They delight in propounding posers for Omnipotence. If a\nCreator dilutes oxygen with three parts of nitrogen on one planet where\nconditions make a dense atmosphere, why should He not dilute oxygen with\nan equal part of nitrogen on a planet where the air is rare? Air is not\na chemical compound, but a simple mixture. When a stronger, more\nlife-giving atmosphere is needed, let there be less of the diluting gas.\nThe nitrogen is of no known use, except to weaken the oxygen.\"\n\n\"Let me out into it, if you say it is all right,\" I cried. \"I am tired\nof this bird-cage.\"\n\n\"Put on the diver's suit and helmet, and I will weaken the pressure of\nthe air gradually, to prevent bleeding at the nose and ears which a\nsudden change might cause. When you are used to the low pressure, you\ncan throw off the helmet and try the Martian double-oxygenated air.\"\n\nI hurriedly donned the queer, baggy suit and the enormous helmet with\nthe bulging glass eyes, and then connected the two long rubber tubes\nwhich sprang from the top with the air pipes which led to the doctor's\ncompartment. He put in the bulkhead, and I went to the port-hole to\nunseal it. As I glanced out the little window, I thought I saw a light\nvery near the mica. Was it our candle flame that something had lifted?\nThe thick glass of the helmet blinded me a little, and I approached the\nwindow and peered out, coming face to face with a Martian, whose nose\nwas pressed against the mica! What a rounded, smooth, and expressionless\nface! But what large, deep, luminous eyes!\n\nI sprang back from the window in surprise, but not more quickly than he\ndid. Just then the projectile rolled over slightly with a crunching\nnoise, and I hear the thud of a heavy muffled blow on the doctor's end.\nSuddenly he pulled away the bulkhead and whispered to me excitedly:--\n\n\"They are all about us outside--dozens of them! They are examining the\nprojectile and trying to break it open. If they strike the windows, it\nwill be too easy.\"\n\nThe projectile tottered a little again. There was a heaving noise, and\none end rose a little from the ground.\n\n\"They are trying to carry us off, Doctor,\" I cried. \"You must turn in\nthe currents and fly away from them.\"\n\nThe projectile was just then lifted awkwardly, and wavered a little and\npitched, as if it were being carried by a throng struggling clumsily all\nabout it. The doctor sprang to his apparatus and turned in four\nbatteries at once. We shot up swiftly in a long curve, and from my\nwindow I could see the circle of amazed Martians, standing dumbly with\ntheir hands still held up in front of them, as they had been when the\nprojectile left them, while they gazed open-mouthed into the sky at us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe Terror Birds\n\n\n\"They must have thought the projectile was another chunk fallen from\nPhobos!\" I exclaimed; \"and now they can't make out why it should fly\nback to the satellite again.\"\n\n\"The more we mystify them, the more they will fear us,\" said the doctor.\n\"I am going to make a swift downward swoop now, as if we would crash\nthrough the midst of them. Then perhaps they will let us alone till we\nare ready for them.\"\n\nHe had scarcely finished speaking when we shot down in a long curve,\nlike the swing of a pendulum, apparently making directly for the group\nof Martians. They were not seized by any quick panic; they were too\nphlegmatic for that. But just as the projectile threatened to smash into\nthem, they seemed to realize the danger, and to grasp the idea that it\nwas being operated and directed by some power and mind inside. Then they\nturned, scrambling clumsily over each other, and fled with the awkward\nprecipitation of a rhinoceros in a hurry. Our pendulum motion swung us\nup a little before we would have struck them, but they had scattered and\nwere scurrying to hiding-places behind the walls of the masonry\ntelescopes. We continued our flight to the edge of the plateau, whence\nwe could get a better view of the city and hold a more commanding\nposition.\n\n\"None of these who have seen our aerial evolutions are likely to trouble\nus again,\" remarked the doctor. \"But they will quickly spread the news\nto the city, and we must be where we can watch everything that goes on\nthere, and hurriedly prepare for the worst they can do to us. We will\nseek the principal approach to the plateau and defend it.\"\n\nHis ideas had suddenly become altogether warlike. I liked the excitement\nof it so far, and hastened to agree with him. We came to land in a\nsheltered part of the main road leading to the plateau, and prepared to\nemerge and set up our telescope where it would sweep the city.\n\n\"Shall we try this air on the dog before you go out?\" inquired the\ndoctor in all seriousness.\n\n\"Try it on the rabbit if you wish, but not on Two-spot.\"\n\nHe put Bunny into the discharging cylinder and pushed him out. The meek\nlittle animal seemed quite delighted at being released. He hopped about\nplayfully, skipping much higher and farther at each hop than I had ever\nseen him do before.\n\nThis reassured me, and I put on the helmet again, and opened the\nport-hole. As the rarer Martian air swept in, my suit swelled and puffed\nto its fullest capacity, by the expansion of the denser air within it. I\nwas so blown up that I could scarcely squeeze myself out of the\nport-hole. It was like a red misty day outside, though there were no\nclouds. The sky was a perfectly cloudless dull red, and the coppery sun\nwas shining almost overhead. His orb looked less than two-thirds the\nsize it did from the Earth, and one could look at its duller light\nfixedly without hurting the eyes. Phobos was also faintly visible,\nsteering his backward course across the ruddy sky. The thermometer\nshowed a temperature just above freezing, but I was perfectly warm\nwithin the diver's suit and its envelope of air. The red haze and utter\nlack of breeze added a deceptive appearance of sultry heat.\n\nI was gazing back toward the Gnomons, when suddenly a group of the\nMartians we had first seen came around a turn of the road and over a\nknoll into full view of us. They were plainly surprised beyond all\nmeasure by my strange appearance. My puffed and corpulent figure, my\nbulging face of glass, my two long rubber tentacles extending back into\nmy shell, must have made them think I was a very curious animal! Also\nthey were probably surprised at seeing any living thing come out of the\nmass, which they must have thought had fallen from their moon, for she\nwas always shying things at them. And I now had my first chance to\nstudy their appearance closely.\n\n\"Doctor,\" I said softly, to see if he could hear me through the\nconnecting tubes. As I had hoped, they proved to be very good\nspeaking-trumpets, and I heard his answer noisily.\n\n\"Speak lower; I hear you easily,\" I said. \"There is a party of them\ncoming down this road to descend to the city. They have stopped upon\nseeing me. They are nothing but men like ourselves. I see no wings,\nhorns, tails, or other appendages that we have not. They are just fat,\npuffy, sluggish men, very white and pale in colour, and covered with a\npeculiar clothing that looks like feathers. I seem to be a far greater\nfreak to them than they are to me.\"\n\nHad he been a million miles away, I should have known that it was the\ndoctor answering, from his unsurprised and matter-of-fact tone. I\nimagined I could see the exact expression of his face as he said,--\n\n\"After all, then, man is the most perfect animal the Creator could make.\nFrom a mechanical standpoint he needs nothing that he has not, and has\nnothing that he does not need. However you change him, you would make\nhim imperfect. Physiologically he may be much the same on all the\nplanets, but there is room for the widest variations on the intellectual\nand spiritual side.\"\n\n\"Do not forget that my patriarchal ancestors record that God made man\nin His own image, upon which there could be no improvement,\" I put in.\n\n\"Yes, but modern scientists would have us believe that your patriarchs\nwould have written a different fable if they had understood the theory\nof evolution. It appears that man is really a little lower than the\nangels, by being material and ponderable and visible, but the general\nimage may be the same. Perhaps upon the various planets it may be that\nthe same lines of differences prevail, as between the heathen tribes and\nthe civilized people on earth. There at least we are sure that\nphysiologically no marked difference exists between the lowest savage\nand the wisest sage.\"\n\n\"Except, perhaps, that the savage may have the best digestion,\" I added.\n\"Those look as if they had but few troubles and plenty to eat. I see no\nwrinkles or hard lines. Their forms and features are gracefully rounded.\nTheir eyes are larger and stronger, with a liquid depth suited to this\nsoft and weaker light. None of them wear beards, and very little hair is\nvisible. I must say they do not look at all warlike. If we could only\nmake them understand that we are friendly, I think they would gladly bid\nus to a feast of freshly-cooked meats and good wines, and ask us,\nchuckling, for the latest after-dinner stories that are current on\nEarth.\"\n\n\"Make friendly signs to them, and see how they behave,\" he suggested.\n\nI slowly waved my hand to them to approach, and extended my arm as if to\nshake hands. While talking with the doctor I had stood perfectly still,\nand they had been warily watching me all the time. When I moved and\nstretched out my arm, they took fright and fled precipitately.\n\n\"I have scared them away, as if they were a lot of roe deer!\" I\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Then let us hasten preparations while they are gone,\" he replied. \"If\nyou can stand the pressure I have given you, it will be safe to throw\noff the helmet and suit.\"\n\nUpon lifting the cover from my head, I caught a draught of fresh cold\nair that was unspeakably invigorating. I drank it in deep breaths, and\nfelt like skipping about for joy. Kicking off the suit that trammelled\nme, I put it and the helmet back inside and closed the port-hole. Then\nthe doctor pulled away the bulkhead and breathed the mixed atmosphere,\nhalf-Martian from my compartment and half-Earthly from his. He suffered\nno inconvenience from the sudden half-way step toward a lower density,\nand presently he emerged into the exhilarating air with me.\n\n\"This atmosphere has a stimulation in it like thin wine, and it gives me\nan appetite. I feel strong and virile enough to tip Mars topsy-turvy,\" I\nsaid. \"At least, let me get some cigars to smoke while we are arming our\nstronghold.\"\n\nWhen I went in for the guns, I put a handful of Havanas in my vest\npocket, and emerging, I laid the rifles handy and proceeded to light a\nweed. I was watching the bright flame of the match, and puffing with\ngusto at the fragrant smoke, when from another direction a second squad\nof Martians came into view very near us. They immediately halted and\ngazed at us in open-mouthed wonder, which soon changed to a look of\nhorror. Remembering the pipe of peace among the American Indians, I drew\nout a cigar, and hastily striking a match upon my trousers, I held the\nweed and flame toward them. Not a man of them stayed to see any more.\nTheir flight was more precipitate than the other party's had been.\n\n\"It was your smoke they were afraid of,\" said the doctor. \"Whenever you\npuffed, I saw them looking at each other blankly and dropping back a\nlittle. They have taken you for a fire-eater and a smoke-breather, and\nwhen you drew the flame from your lungs it was too much for them. But\nall this serves our purpose of frightening them. They will spread\nstrange stories in the city below!\"\n\nI helped him carry out the telescope, and we placed it in a commanding\nposition. Then we propped up the broad shields, so that each of us could\ncrouch behind one, and I laid a broadsword and rifle handy to each. Then\nwe put on the linked-wire shirts under our coats, buckled the revolvers\nabout us, and, as it was rather cold, we each put on a thick pair of\ngloves and a heavy topcoat.\n\nThe doctor, who was carefully watching things down in the city through\nthe telescope, cried out to me presently,--\n\n\"There is wild commotion and great excitement down yonder by the great\npalace. The news has reached them! They are preparing to come in force\nto take us!\"\n\n\"I wish I knew what their sign of peace is, we might save a conflict,\"\nsaid I. \"Perhaps our fire-arms won't harm them.\"\n\n\"More likely they will blow them all to pieces,\" answered the doctor.\n\"But we must not fire unless it becomes absolutely necessary to defend\nourselves, for if we kill any of them, they will then have cause to deal\nwith us as dreadfully as they can. We cannot hope to overcome them all.\nIt will be enough to demonstrate our supremacy, so that they will allow\nus to live among them. Therefore, let us simply defend ourselves and do\nnothing offensive, thus showing that we are peaceably disposed.\"\n\n\"You cry peace, but look at the great army they are sending against us!\"\nI exclaimed. \"There are four companies of foot soldiers marching through\nthe streets, and each man is armed with a very long cross-bow and wears\na brightly-coloured bird-wing on his forehead. The streets are filling\nwith people to see them pass. Now three more companies wheel out of the\npalace, but they have no cross-bows. They are whirling something around\ntheir heads.\"\n\nThe doctor anxiously awaited his turn at the telescope, and as he looked\nhe clutched his pistol though they were still several miles away.\n\n\"Those are slings they are whirling about their heads,\" he said. \"And\nthe commander of each company rides an ambling donkey, and wears a heavy\nplaited beard and long braided hair, without head covering.\"\n\n\"But look further back, coming out of the palace now!\" I cried. \"What\nare those strange, stately animals far behind the soldiers? I can see\nthem with the naked eye.\"\n\n\"_Donnerwetter!_ what towering birds!\" he muttered under his breath.\n\"Like ostriches in form, but as tall and graceful as a giraffe! There is\na man riding astride the neck of each of them, yet he could scarcely\nreach half-way to their heads!\"\n\n\"Are those monstrous things birds?\" I demanded. \"Let me look. What long\nand bony legs they have! They would stride over us without touching our\nheads; but how they could kick!\"\n\n\"And how they could run!\" put in the doctor. \"See, they stride easily\nover seven or eight feet with a single step. They must be messenger\nbirds, for there are only four of them, and their riders are not\narmed.\"\n\n\"They may have hundreds more of them in reserve, and they could fight\nfar more viciously than the men. See what a wicked beak and what a long\nmuscular neck they have. They could crush a skull in a twinkling with\none swift swoop of that head! I will fight the men, but I will take no\nchances with those birds!\"\n\nAlthough these strange, small-winged creatures had started long after\nthe soldiers, they had quickly passed them, and were now beginning to\nmount toward our plateau. They were making swift detours at intervals,\nas if to reconnoitre. We were hidden behind our rocks and shields, and\nthe riders could not see us, and they had evidently not yet seen the\nbrass barrel of our telescope. It would be folly for them to attempt to\ncome up the road we were guarding, for we could easily heave boulders\nover and crush them. I had already put my shoulder to an immense rock\nnear the brink, to see if it was as heavy as it looked. I found it\nporous and crumbly, and no heavier than so much chalk. Up the roadway\nthe great birds climbed with wonderful ease. Their riders were evidently\nlooking for us without any idea where we were.\n\n\"I won't see those elephantine bipeds come any nearer to me!\" I\nexclaimed, and rushing to the boulder, which was certainly four feet in\ndiameter, I toppled it over the brink, and expected to see it carry\neverything down before it. It rolled slowly down the steep bank, with\nhardly a third the force and speed of the same mass on Earth. This\ndiscouraged me, but I watched for it to reach the foremost bird. He was\nsurprised by it, but made one step sideways, and, lifting his great\nright leg, the stone rolled under him without any damage. He gave a\nqueer, guttural croak, accompanied by a most violent motion of the head\nand neck. The other birds, thus warned, dodged quickly sidewise, and\navoided the slowly rolling boulder; but all three of the riders were\nthrown by the swift lateral movement of the birds. The astonished men\npicked themselves up slowly from the bushes and approached their birds.\nBut they could scarcely reach with their hands the lower part of the\nneck where they had sat.\n\n\"Unless they are good jumpers, they cannot mount again without a\nladder!\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Jumping is easier than standing still here,\" I interrupted. \"I can jump\nten feet high with no trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes; but these Martian boobies haven't your muscles. _Aber Blitzen!_\ndid you see that fellow mount his bird again?\"\n\nI had seen it, and I do not remember anything more wonderful than this\noperation, which was repeated for each rider. The man went in front of\nhis bird, turned his back, and stooped forward. The bird then curved his\nlong neck to the ground, and put his head and neck between the legs of\nthe rider, who clutched tightly with his arms and legs. With a swift,\ngraceful swing, the bird lifted its head on high, carrying the rider as\nif he were nothing. When the great neck was again erect, the man slid\ncarefully down it to his place, much as one might slip down a telegraph\npole. Then two of the birds turned back to the city as swiftly as they\ncould go, and the other two took separate side trails and soon\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Armies of Mars\n\n\nAs the two returning birds passed the marching soldiers, their riders\nevidently delivered some message to the captains, for the soldiers\nsuddenly broke forward in a run, using their long cross-bows with great\ndexterity as jumping staves. Placing the outer end upon the ground ahead\nof them as they ran, they leaped and hung upon the cross-piece with\ntheir hands. The springy resistance of this tough wood imparted to them\na forward motion with its rebound, and they scaled great distances at\neach jump. The whole company did it in concert, and they made almost as\ngreat speed as if they had been riding bicycles. The slingers were\nconsequently left far in the rear.\n\nLess than half way up the incline the archers stopped, arranged their\nbow-thongs, and selected feathered arrows from a pouch slung over their\nshoulders.\n\n\"They can never hit us from that distance!\" I exclaimed; \"a rifle would\nnot carry so far.\"\n\n\"You forget the weak gravity which will bend their course down very\nlittle, and the thin air which will barely resist their flight; this is\na model planet for archery,\" he answered. \"Quick! drop behind your\nshield! They have fired the first volley!\"\n\nA torrent of the shafts fell all about us, and many pelted against our\nshields. Those which struck the soft earth of the bank sank into it and\nstuck there, but those which struck our steel were shivered and broken.\n\n\"Sit still and let them shoot away their arrows,\" I whispered. \"This\nwill soon be over.\"\n\nThe next volley came with a little more force, as if they had marched\nfurther up the hill. One or two arrows fell very near me, and I reached\nfor them to examine their construction. They were made of the hollow,\nfilmy stock of a rather tough reed, and were pointed with a chipped\nstone tip, which was brittle, but not harder than porous chalk.\n\n\"That stuff wouldn't pierce my two coats, to say nothing of the linked\nsteel shirt,\" I sneered. \"I will show them what fools they are!\" and I\nwalked boldly out to the brink and faced them. They let fly a quick\nvolley with a concerted shout. As I saw the arrows start, I turned my\nback and bent down my head quickly. Perhaps a dozen of the slim reeds\npelted me, and then I stooped over and gathered up as many as I could\nfind, and broke them all in my hands before their eyes.\n\nThis sent a hum of excited jabbering through their ranks, and they fired\nno more. I stood watching them, and presently I grasped my two hands\ntogether and shook hands with myself, to try to convey to them the idea\nthat we were friendly; but it must have carried no meaning to them. By\nthis time the slingers had come up, and I retired behind my shield to\nawait their action. The archers seemed very glad of their arrival, and\nyielded the foremost place to them. I noted their operations carefully,\nand saw them place something, which did not look like a round stone, in\nthe pocket of their slings, and then they whirled it long and\ncautiously. Suddenly they discharged it with a swift movement of their\nbodies backward, which landed them on one knee.\n\n\"Wide of the mark!\" I cried, as the missiles sailed off far to the right\nof us. But just before landing they bent a sharp, surprising curve, and\nlacked but little of hitting us behind the shields! The things they had\nthrown were the thin, concave shells of a large nut, and the trick of\ndischarging them gave them their peculiar flight.\n\n\"I don't like this throwing around the corner!\" exclaimed the doctor.\n\"With a little truer aim they will be able to hit us behind anything.\"\n\n\"Hurry, bring your shield over behind mine, and face it the other way,\"\nsaid I; \"then we will crouch between the two in safety.\"\n\nHe did this just in time, for some of the next volley actually curved\naround and hit his shield, but none struck mine in front. However, the\nshells which fell near us were of light weight, and would not have\nbruised us much with heavy clothing on. Presently their pelting ceased,\nand we concluded that they were planning something new. We decided to\nlet them know that we were not hurt, so we emerged; and I tried throwing\nthe shells back with my hand, but I could not control their erratic\ncourse. When they saw this they jeered at me, and I itched to treat them\nto just one pistol shot, only to show them what child's play their\nfighting was! Presently we saw what they were waiting for. Far down the\nroad the two great birds were returning harnessed together, and dragging\nbehind them an enormous catapult. Tied across their backs were two stout\ndarts, seemingly twelve feet long and three inches square. Each of them\nhad a wicked-looking barbed tip.\n\nThere was a pleased and confident jabber among the slingers and archers\nbelow as the birds arrived. The catapult was turned about toward us, and\nlashed tightly to stakes driven in front and behind. Then the birds were\nhitched to the cord of the immense bow, and they pulled it far back,\nuntil the men made it fast in a notch. The cross-piece had now become\nalmost a half-circle, quite ten feet in diameter. The captain of a\ncompany of archers acted as gunner, and carefully adjusted the catapult,\naiming it evidently at our shield. Upon seeing this we placed the two\nshields together, and leaned them both inward toward us, so as to make\ntheir angle with the upward course of the dart more obtuse, and thus\ncause a glancing blow instead of a solid impact. Crouching under the\nsteel shelters, we awaited the dart.\n\nWhiz-z-z it whistled up through the thin air! Bimm-m! it struck the top\nof our outer shield, and glanced off as we had hoped. The outer steel\nrattled and banged against the inner, and both shields pressed hard over\nagainst us, but not the slightest damage was done.\n\nWe went out to watch them load the second dart. They evidently saw the\nimpotence of the glancing blow, and were noisily discussing it. A\ncaptain of the slingers was arguing hotly with the gunner, who was\nfinally persuaded to take his aim a little lower. Then a hum of approval\nwent through the throng.\n\n\"They do think a little, but they are not secretive!\" I sneered,\nflopping our inner shield over flat on the ground. \"Come, sit on this,\nDoctor, and we will lean the outer shield over us, and snuggle in\nbetween them as cosy as two oysters! Let them fondly imagine they can\nshoot us through this pasty soil, and keep their own counsel better\nafter this!\"\n\nIt was not a bad guess on my part; for the second dart struck the edge\nof the cliff, bored through the loose soil, and thumped our lower shield\nwith a dull thud that lifted us from the ground. But the point and\nedges of the dart were blunted, and crumbled with the blow, and I could\nfind no dent in the shield.\n\n\"See, the birds are returning to the city in haste for more darts!\" said\nthe doctor. But I was interested in examining the first dart, which had\nfallen a few hundred feet behind us. Its shaft was of roughly-hewn,\nspongy wood, and it weighed far less than half the mass of soft pine\nwould on Earth. Its tip was not metal, but chipped stone--crumbly, like\nthe arrow-heads. Either they did not know the metals, or they were too\nrare to be used in their arts. And it was to be supposed that they would\nuse the hardest stone they had for arrow-heads and dart-tips.\n\nI carried the shaft easily upon my shoulder forward to the edge of the\ncliff. This surprised even the doctor a little, for four Martians had\nbeen necessary to put it in place upon the catapult. It must have\nastonished them still more, for they were staring at me so blankly that\nI was tempted to toss the dart down their gaping throats!\n\n\"Give them just one dose of their own medicine!\" suggested the doctor.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better teach them to keep their dangerous weapons at\nhome,\" I said; and, balancing the dart easily above my head, I aimed it\ncarefully at a dense group around the catapult. I threw my whole force\ninto the thrust, and sent the shaft whizzing down at them. Then I\nstaggered back, quite exhausted by the effort and gasping for breath.\n\n\"Good God! You have impaled two of them upon the dart!\" cried the\ndoctor, \"and it is causing a panic in the whole army!\"\n\nAnd when I sprang up to look, I saw two writhing Martians, much shrunken\nin size and dying upon the dart. The terror-stricken archers and\nslingers were scattering and scurrying in every direction, regardless of\nthe shouted orders of their captains. The foremost of the impaled men\nwore a beard, and was no other than the gunner of the catapult.\n\n\"I am sorry for the poor devils!\" I exclaimed. \"I had no idea they were\nso soft and tender. They have shrunk like a pricked balloon!\"\n\n\"They thought they could prick us like that, and let the life ooze out,\"\nsaid the doctor. \"There is no danger that they will shoot any more at\nus. The whole army is afraid that you will throw down the other dart.\"\n\nNevertheless, other companies of archers and slingers were seen leaving\nthe palace, and the birds were already returning with two more darts.\nAnd the soldiers below were gaining courage and responding to the\nrallying cries of the captains, who were halloing and pointing toward\nthe edge of the cliff, down in the direction of the cataract. I looked\nquickly that way, and instantly shouted,--\n\n\"To the rifles, quick, doctor! The other two birds have ascended the\ncliff, and are racing toward us along its edge. Take careful aim at the\nhead of that front one. Afterward, let drive two random bullets into his\nbody!\"\n\nUrged on by their riders, who with their hands swayed the long necks of\nthe birds in unison with their rhythmical stride, these two-legged\ngiraffes, with the wild look and sharp beak of an eagle, swept\nmenacingly toward us.\n\n\"Ready now!\" I cried, as the foremost came within fifty feet of us.\n\"Fire!\"\n\nTwo sharp reports almost simultaneous, with a less thunderous explosion\nthan on Earth, but singing in a higher key and flaming vastly more,\nstartled and terrified the Martians. Then crack! crack! bang! bang! four\nother shots in swift succession, followed by the terrific croaking of\nthe wounded Terror-bird, which fell ponderously forward, kicking\nviolently and beating the ground wildly with its head.\n\nSeizing my broadsword in a flash, I dealt it such a blow upon the neck\nas quite to sever the head from the body. There was a gush of red blood;\nand those who have seen the antics of a decapitated chicken, may\ncorrespondingly multiply the corpse and imagine the confusion that now\nensued.\n\n\"Stand ready for the second bird!\" I shouted to the doctor; but on\nlooking, I saw that the other animal refused to be urged forward, after\nseeing the fate of his companion. His rider was half-hearted in his\nefforts, and was watching the forward rider, who had been severely\nthrown with the bird's fall, and badly bruised by the kicking and\nthreshing. He seemed to realize that he was in our power, and was\nthoroughly desperate. With a wailing cry he rushed at me with open arms,\nas if to embrace death, for I still held the sword. Dropping the weapon,\nI grappled with him, catching him about the wrists, which shrank under\nmy grasp. He seemed to have scarcely the strength of a child; and\neverywhere I touched him, his flesh yielded like the flabby muscles of a\nfat baby. I bent him over backwards, then swung him around and caught\nhim by the shoulders, and whirled him around my head. Finally, I tossed\nhim over the edge of the cliff, where he landed among some bushes, and\nscrambled down as fast as he could, glad to have saved his life. The\nother rider had turned his bird back toward the cataract with all\npossible despatch.\n\n\"The whole army below us is now thoroughly demoralized!\" said the\njubilant doctor. \"Many of them fled dismayed on hearing the firing, and\nothers screamed and ran away when they saw you decapitate the bird. But\nyour wrestling with the rider, and flinging him about like an infant,\nwas an object lesson none of them could stay to see repeated. I saw one\ntrembling fool slink back to cut the thong of the catapult, so that we\ncould not use it on them. They have wholly abandoned the attack!\"\n\n\"If this is the worst they can do, I will undertake to make myself king,\nand you prime minister here, within twenty-four hours!\" I ejaculated,\ndecidedly pleased with the idea. \"And I will maintain supremacy with a\nstanding army of a thousand Terror-birds!\"\n\n\"The consciousness of superior strength always brings that desire for\nconquest,\" answered the doctor. \"We must not allow it to master us, but\nwe must push our advantage. Look! the panic of the first ones reaching\nthe city is spreading to the new companies marching out. They are\ntrampled over by the fleeing host, they turn and mingle with the\nfrightened mob in one struggling, terror-stricken mass! Come, let us be\ninto the projectile and after them. With a few booming shots above their\nheads, we will make them think their Thunder-gods have come!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Strange Bravery of Miss Blank\n\n\nTelescope, rifles, and shields were tumbled into the projectile\npell-mell, and without stopping to close the port-hole, we steered\ntowards the city as we mounted rapidly. When the soldiers, weary of\nrunning, saw us start, they were stricken with a new fear, and made all\npossible haste for shelter. When they perceived that we were rising into\nthe red haze, they took a little courage, but still hastened.\n\n\"Perhaps they think we are mounting to the sky for more thunder and\nlightning,\" I suggested. \"Little do they know the destruction we could\ndo them with the handful of ammunition we have, if we really meant war\nas much as they at first desired it and now fear it!\"\n\nBy this time we were almost above the thickest crowd of the fleeing\narmy, while the most energetic runners and the Terror-bird that had\nturned back had reached the heart of the city; and we could see the\nalarm spreading like wild-fire to all its inhabitants. I was busy\nloading the rifles with the cartridges which the doctor had robbed of\ntheir bullets for the pickle-bottle experiment soon after our start.\n\n\"We will execute a little _coup_, to show them the difficulties of\nretreat when the enemy is armed with gravity projectiles,\" said the\ndoctor. \"Do you see that great gate of the city they are all making for?\nWe will drop down there, just in front of them, and prevent their\nentrance. It will be better to keep the whole army outside the walls, if\npossible, for its absence and disorganization will make the rulers all\nthe more tractable when we are ready to drop down into their city and\nmake peace with them on our own terms.\"\n\n\"I must say you are a good general, Doctor!\" I exclaimed. \"You plan the\ncampaign, and I will do the fighting.\"\n\nThe blank dismay of the soldiers when they saw us descending again, and\ntheir abject desperation when they perceived that we should land in\nfront of them and cut off their entrance to the city, was pitiful to\nsee.\n\n\"Doctor, do you remember the grand display and the proud strength with\nwhich these soldiers marched forth? Look at the difference now!\"\n\n\"Oh, war! war!\" he exclaimed. \"The glory of its beginning! The terror of\nits prosecution! The misery of its end! Would that it could always be\ncarried on by terrorizing the mind instead of by slaying the body!\"\n\nAs we were about to come to land in front of the straggling multitude of\nsoldiers, I fired a dozen blank cartridges as rapidly as I could work\nthe rifle. This was at very near range, and although the explosions\nsounded weak to me, the excessive flaming of the powder added a new\nterror. The disorganized army stopped in dread; the stragglers pushing\nup from behind, and the frightened turning of those in front, crushed\nthe multitude together and increased the confusion. Throngs of people,\nwhose curiosity was still stronger than their fear, were coming out from\nthe city. As they saw us float down and land, and then heard the firing,\nthey turned and rushed within the gates again, ready to believe far\nworse stories than they had yet heard.\n\n\"We must scatter this rabble army and put it wholly to rout,\" insisted\nthe doctor. \"I will swing amongst them and over their heads, while you\nburn powder for them. If they won't scatter, use your revolver and wound\none or two of them.\"\n\n\"No, I will not harm another man,\" I answered. \"They are too weak and\ndefenceless a foe, and are no match for us. Hereafter I will fight only\nwith the birds.\"\n\nWe rose and sailed slantingly toward them, but they had already started\nto disperse. Those who had jumping-staves disentangled themselves from\nthe crowd and scattered into the bushy wastes. I continued firing until\nmy blank cartridges were gone, and then we landed just outside the\nentrance and emerged from the projectile to examine the gates and see if\nwe could close and fasten them.\n\nWithin the wall those who had gained entrance during our last movements\nwere rapidly retreating toward the centre of the city, warning all whom\nthey passed. One single stately figure showed no fear, and paid no heed\nto the exclamations of the runners. The ampler dress and flowing flaxen\nhair indicated that it was a woman, and to our surprise, though she was\nwell clothed, she seemed to be demanding alms of every one as she\napproached us. No one gave her anything, and occasionally a runner\nseized her arm and tried to persuade her to return. But she caught none\nof their excitement, and composedly pursued her course.\n\n\"Egad! This beautiful girl is braver than the whole Martian army!\" I\nexclaimed in amazement, as she calmly approached where I was standing by\nthe gate and extended her fair, plump hand. If she was asking alms, I\nhad nothing to give her; but here, at least, was one pacific, composed,\nand reasonable person. Perhaps it was the queen, or a diplomatic envoy\nof the ruler!\n\n\"Now is the time to demonstrate our friendliness,\" I exclaimed, and\nreaching forth my hand I grasped hers in a warm clasp of welcome.\n\nShe looked up at me blankly. Her beautiful face carried no expression of\nsatisfaction or surprise. Her transparent complexion was neither paled\nby fear nor flushed by pleasure. Her great dreamy eyes, of a deep liquid\nblue, wandered unfixedly in their languid gaze. Still holding her soft\nhand, which was far warmer than my own, I opened her fingers with my\nother hand and pointed at her pink extended palm as if to inquire what\nshe wished. I watched her closely, but she made no sign, said nothing,\nlooked nothing.\n\n\"Since I do not know you, I can think of no more fitting name to call\nyou by than Miss Blank,\" I said, more to express my thought in\narticulate sounds than anything else, for I had no idea she would\nunderstand me. From her expression I could not judge whether she had\neven heard me, to say nothing of comprehending. She was looking beyond\nme, through the gate, as if searching others from whom she might ask\nalms. Seeing none, she wheeled slowly about to return. Unwillingly I\nreleased her hand, and stood unspeakably puzzled by the whole matter.\nShe was commanding in appearance, being taller than I by a few inches,\nnot slim, but well proportioned. She had the stately serenity of a\ndreaming queen, but the blank, unresponsive soul of one who dwelt within\nherself; and though she saw, she did not realize the existence or\nmeaning of anything outside.\n\n\"Doctor, will all your learning solve this riddle for me!\" I exclaimed.\n\"Can all the Martian women be like this? She is beautiful of body and\nstrangely warm and winning to the touch, but as cold of heart as the\ndrifting snow that suffocates a poor lost lamb. She has had a strange\ninfluence over me; a puzzling, baffling attraction. A suggestion of\nsomething delicate and subtlely charming, which, when one seeks to seize\nand to define, retires icily behind the drawn curtain of her soul.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't play the lost lamb to her snowdrift!\" he sneered, in a\nway that I resented. \"One would think she had hypnotized you on the\nspot! And she must be in a trance herself, for she had not sense enough\nto fear us.\"\n\n\"Those who have the most sense fear us the least!\" I retorted.\n\n\"But fear is our sharp weapon now,\" he answered; \"and some of the\nstragglers, looking back, saw you stand there holding her hand in a\nmanner far from warlike. They will report this to the rulers unless we\nforestall them. Come, fasten the gates tightly upon the inside to keep\nthe soldiers out, and I will sail over the wall to pick you up.\"\n\n\"Doctor, we make our peace at once, and fight no more with the brothers\nof this girl,\" I said with decision.\n\nThe massive gates were of hewn stone, turning in sockets at their outer\ncorners above and below. They swung as easily as if hung upon hinges,\nand when closed a slab of stone came down to bar them. I made them\nfast, and then called out to the doctor,--\n\n\"Don't come for me. I have found a jumping-staff, and I think I can leap\nto the top of the wall.\"\n\nIt was a sheer fifteen feet of solid masonry, but my chief delight since\nlanding on Martian soil was the inordinate springiness of my leg muscles\nagainst the feeble gravity. I ran and sprang lustily with the aid of the\ncross-bow, and I remember the doctor's surprised look when he saw me\nclear the entire wall without touching the top and land safely with a\nvery mild jolt on his side.\n\nA short oblique ascent of the projectile brought us over the city, and\nrevealed to us the condition of desperate panic into which the wild\nreports of the soldiers and the bird-rider had thrown the frantic\npopulace. The soldiers still within the walls could not restrain the\npeople, or did not try. If there was any government, it lacked a head or\ncould not command attention. The stubborn instinct of self-preservation\nwas king. Distracted throngs surged out at one gate, to separate and\nwaver and hesitate, and finally to fight for a speedy entrance at\nanother. On one side soldiers were apparently ordering people down from\nthe wall, while on another the excited populace was hauling sentinel\nsoldiers from the same elevation, lest our attention should be\nattracted. Within, strong men were weeping and wailing; without, nervous\nmen were haranguing the vacillating multitude; but more were stolidly\npushing with the rabble or being hustled by it.\n\nOnly one sign of order and forethought was apparent. Evidently for\nbetter safety and for an easier defence, the women and children had been\ntaken to a central park or pleasure ground, and left there with a small\nguard of soldiers. The men to whom they belonged had apparently all gone\nelsewhere.\n\n\"Doctor, we must put an end to this fear and frenzy at the earliest\npossible moment. If we are not destroying those people, we are exciting\nthem to destroy each other, which is equally blameworthy. We must go\ndown at once, but we had best avoid the frantic men. The women seem far\nmore reposeful. Let us drop quietly into that open field in the park,\nand I will make friendly signs to the women, pat the children on the\nhead, and give them all to understand that we mean no harm.\"\n\nHe evidently saw that we had quite overdone the scare, and was as much\nimpressed by the terrible picture below as I was. We turned down without\ndelay, and landed quietly behind a clump of trees. I took a tin of sweet\nbiscuits under my arm, and the doctor following me, with a generous\nhandful of his trinkets and tinsel toys, we left the projectile, and\nrounding the grove of dwarfed trees we approached the romping children\nfirst. I patted their flaxen curls, lightly pinched their cheeks, and\nhanded each of them a sweet biscuit. Then, while the doctor distributed\nstrange toys amongst them, I put on my most courtly ways and addressed\nmyself to the women. Their first impulses of fear had been somewhat\nallayed by our attentions to the children, and I bowed profusely and\nmade bold to kiss the hands of a few of the youngest of them. Each of\nthese looked to see if I had left anything visible or harmful on her\nhand, from which I judged the custom was wholly strange to them. The\nothers looked on askance and whispered excitedly among themselves.\n\nOne of the soldiers who had seen us approach, but offered no resistance,\nhad now started to run, as fast as his jumping-staff would carry him,\ntoward the palace. I knew at once that this meant some new development,\nand I hoped it meant a report of our friendly actions and a truce all\naround. But the doctor reminded me that we must be prepared for\nsurprises and treachery. Therefore we re-entered the projectile, and out\nof the sight of all the Martians I re-loaded the rifles, and then we\nwaited a long time.\n\nOur patience was finally rewarded, for we saw the soldier returning,\nslowly leading a woman. In her left arm, which the soldier held, she\ncarried something white which wriggled occasionally. All this we\nconsidered so favourable a development that we went out again, bowing to\nthe women about us, petting the children, and looking as peaceable and\namiable as the politest of Earth's people. But it may have passed for\nimbecility, or worse, on Mars.\n\nWhen I looked toward the soldier again, my heart began a queer thumping,\nfor he was leading no other than the woman who had met us at the gate,\nand she was carrying our white rabbit, which we had released early that\nmorning a long way from this spot.\n\n\"By all that is wonderful!\" I exclaimed to the doctor, \"if we have not\nfallen upon a country which is ruled by yon dumb queen, and she brings\nto us as a peace offering the only thing that we have lost!\"\n\n\"Since when have potentates learned to beg, and forgotten to command and\nto exact?\" he answered with half a sneer. \"See, she still extends her\nhand to every one she passes.\"\n\nAnd as the soldier, trained to revere a beard, led the woman directly up\nto the doctor, she stretched forth her pretty palm again; but if he had\npresumed to take it I could have struck him! To my cordial grasp I added\na kiss this time, and then I raised my eyes slowly to her face, fearing\nto see that blank look again. There _was_ no look in her eyes; they did\nnot look, they only wandered!\n\nThe soldier, who still held her other arm, waved his cross-bow toward\nthe palace meaningly, and a hush fell upon the murmuring crowd. I\nignored him and spoke to her,--\n\n\"If thou art the queen, command me but by a look or sign, and I obey.\nAnd if thou art not the queen, then they should make thee one. Dost thou\nwish us to follow thee to yon palace?\" said I; but the only mind that\nunderstood scoffed at my rapturous declamation.\n\nThe woman merely drew her hand from my warm clasp and stretched it out\nto the people, who crowded about and paid her no attention. Then the\nsoldier, as if suddenly remembering, took the rabbit from her arm and\nhanded it to me. She looked about at this, as if missing the snuggling\nanimal, and I stared hard at the meddling soldier to reprove him for\ninterfering with his queen, and gently restored the rabbit to her arm.\n\n\"The soldier wishes us to go to the palace,\" put in the doctor. \"But we\nmust not go unarmed. He may be leading us into an ambush. Let us take\nall of our arms and follow him.\"\n\nAccordingly, we buckled on the swords, and took the rifles on our\nshoulders. As we dragged out the heavy shields, the soldier pointed to a\ngroup of donkeys laden with bags of something like grain. I waved\nassent, and the muleteer unburdened one of them and loaded the shields\nupon him.\n\n\"Why not take the telescope?\" I suggested; \"it is big and bright, and\nperhaps they may fear it too. Or we may wish to show its wondrous use.\"\nAs I drew it out the crowd started back, but the soldier and the\nmuleteer gingerly loaded it upon another donkey. Then the soldier took\nthe woman's arm again, and pushed her extended palm around toward me, as\nif I would be unwilling to go unless I had it. My right hand held my\nrifle, but I was secretly glad that my left was free to clasp the\nwoman's hand. The doctor walked behind to watch the muleteer, and thus\nwe marched to the palace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nZaphnath, Ruler of the Kemi\n\n\nTwo hieroglyph-bearing columns of red sandstone, strong and broad enough\nto have supported a Tower of Babel, formed the portals of the outer gate\nof the palace. A pair of Terror-birds, whose plumage was a pearly grey,\nstood sleepily on guard. Our soldier, who could scarcely have reached to\nthe backs of the birds, lifted up his cross-bow and tapped upon their\nlong necks. Acting perfectly in concert, the animals each engaged with\nits beak a wooden ring suspended high in front of them, and then,\nbending down their necks, the hempen ropes, to which the rings were\nfastened, hauled up a ponderous portcullis, made of slabs of stone, and\nthus afforded us an entrance.\n\nAs this stone gate rumbled slowly down again, we saw that we were shut\ninto a vast courtyard, surrounded by a colonnade, whence cavernous\npassages led circuitously to the various compartments of the palace.\nWithin the courtyard were drawn up in expectant readiness four companies\nof archers and three of slingers, in all, perhaps, seven hundred men,\nwho gaped and stared at us.\n\nThe doctor touched my elbow, and whispered: \"We should have landed in\nhere with the projectile, which would have given us a means of ready\nescape.\"\n\n\"Remember the saying of General Grant,\" I answered. \"'When you are\nfrightened, don't forget that the enemy may be far more so.' These\nsoldiers have heard enough to make them believe us capable of anything.\nThey would tear down the very walls, if we were to open fire on them.\nBesides, I could leap that courtyard wall and drag you with me.\"\n\nUnsheathing our swords, as an object lesson to the soldiers, we followed\nour guide to the blind end of a long passage, which apparently gave\nentrance only to a small stone chamber. Following the soldier and\nmuleteer, who were now carrying our shields and telescope, we crowded\ninto this and waited. Presently the entire chamber, operated in some\nunseen manner, turned slowly half way round, so that its door now gave\nentrance directly to a vast but gloomy and tomb-like audience chamber,\nwhere we were evidently expected.\n\nUpon a massive throne of richly-chiselled stone a youth of scarcely more\nthan five-and-twenty years (if judged by earthly standards) sat\ngorgeously arrayed in vestments of richly coloured feathers, woven\nskilfully into the meshes of coarse cloth. Longer plumes of changeable\ncolours radiated from a wide collar which he wore, covering his breast\nand back, and extending over his shoulders. The peach-blow of his fair\ncheeks was partly hidden by a heavy false beard, plaited into stubby\nbraids, which hung to an even line a little below the chin. His own\nsoft, flaxen hair peeped meekly out from under a wig of tightly curled\ngrey strands, cropped all round to a level with the beard. His feet and\narms were bare, except for thin ribbons of downy, purple feathers, which\ncircled the wrists and ankles. No crown was on his head, but among the\nstringy wig-curls the sinuous body of an asp bent in and out, and the\ncurved neck and threatening head surmounted his clear brow.\n\nTo his right, round an oval table of highly polished stone, sat twelve\nwrinkled men, not one of whom but had seen three times his years. They\nwore their own white beards, unplaited, and their feather clothing was\nless elaborate and of simple grey, like the plumage of the Terror-bird.\n\nOur soldier placed his right hand upon his cheek, and inclined his head\nslightly forward and to the right, as a salutation to the ruler, and,\nleaving the woman standing by me, he and the muleteer retired. She\nseemed neither surprised at, nor accustomed to, these surroundings. She\nmade no salutation or obeisance to the ruler or to the old men, and they\nmade none to her. Withdrawing her hand from mine, she stretched it\ntoward them, as she had toward the commonest man outside. They paid her\nno attention, but the oldest of the men signalled to an attendant, who\nled her back and placed her hand in mine again. That soldiers and\ncounsellors alike should consider this necessary or fitting seemed\nstrange to me. The doctor jokingly suggested that they wished to keep me\npermanently hypnotized, lest I should become dangerous again.\n\nHaving laid off our rifles, swords, and outer coats, I lifted my cap and\nmade a low bow to the youth and to the old men, but the doctor tried the\nsalute of the right hand upon the cheek, as he had seen the soldier do.\nIn answer the youth simply looked toward the twelve, waving his hand\ntowards us in a way which seemed to say to them, \"Gentlemen, behold the\nenigma!\" Then, beginning with the eldest, the twelve jabbered at us in\nturn, apparently in different tongues, some sibilant, some guttural, and\nothers with the musical cadence of frequent vowel sounds. Needless to\nsay, each was equally incomprehensible to us, and we did not think it\nworth while to try German or English upon them. When they had finished,\nthey looked much vexed, and slowly wagged their beards. Then the youth\nspoke something to them with a confident gesture toward himself. He\narose, and began addressing us. I suddenly stopped short in the middle\nof a sentence I was whispering to the doctor. It seemed as if the youth\nhad ceased making mere sounds, and had begun to speak a coherent\nlanguage, a tongue which has lived ages while others have languished\ninto forgetfulness; a language whose words I understood, but yet the\nwords carried little clear meaning to me.\n\n\"Listen, Doctor! The boy is speaking Hebrew! Ancient and archaic in\nform, but yet Hebrew which I understand!\" And this is what he had said:\n\n\"Oh ye, who speak among yourselves, but understand only those who speak\nnot at all, I, Zaphnath, revealer of God's hidden things, will address\nye in my native tongue, which none but me in all the land of Kem hath\nany knowledge of.\"\n\n\"There be two of us in Kem, O Zaphnath, who understand that tongue.\nSpeak on!\" I cried.\n\nBut the boy stripped off his wig and beard, and, leaving the throne,\nhastened toward me and laid his soft right cheek against my own with\ngentle pressure.\n\n\"Comest thou, then, from the land of my father, a stranger wandering\ninto Kem, even as I came?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nay, gentle youth, we came a vastly farther way, from another world, so\ndistant that thou seest it from here only as a twinkling star in the\nnight. But if, indeed, thou camest a wandering stranger into Kem, art\nthou then the king?\" He had resumed his wig and beard, and his proud\nseat upon the throne, and after he had translated my words for the\ntwelve old men, he answered me,--\n\n\"I am Zaphnath, ruler over all the land of Kem, without whom the\nPharaoh doeth not, nor sayeth anything. These are his twelve wise men,\nwho do not believe what thou hast said, for there is no other world\nlarge enough for the abode of two men, except the Day-Giver, whence they\nthink ye have come. The Pharaoh may believe them, but I will believe\nwhat ye tell me. He hath given me full power to treat with you, and hath\ntaken refuge with all his women in his tomb, and will not come forth\nuntil ye be appeased. Tell me in truth, then, are ye men, or gods? Ye\nlook not half so warlike as all the soldiers have described you.\"\n\nI translated this to the doctor, but replied without waiting to consult\nwith him,--\n\n\"We know but one God, who hath made all the stars, and all who dwell\nupon them. We are men to whom it hath been given to travel the infinite\ndistances which reach from one of His stars to another, and we are come\nto this one, not to make war but to find peace. We would have sought\nthee peacefully as friends, had not thine armies made war upon us on the\nplateau yonder. But our means of warfare proved far more terrible and\ndreadful here than on our proper star. Thus have we unwittingly slain\ntwo of thy soldiers and frightened all the army. We have with us the\nmeans to kill them all, but we seek a peaceable life here for a brief\ntime, that we may learn your ways and test your wisdom, when we shall be\ngone again.\"\n\n\"The Pharaoh could have better spared a thousand men than the bird\nwhich thy lightning hath killed. For are not his slaves as the plenteous\ngrain of a rich harvest, while his birds are but as the fingers of his\nhands. If ye came but to learn, 'tis well ye know these wise men,\nthough, since I came to Kem, their profession hath fallen somewhat into\ndisrepute. I doubt not but they could learn far more from thee than thou\nfrom them, but they will not do it. Whatever they do not know is not\ntrue in Kem, but what they know continues true long after common men\nknow better. Now, wilt thou explain to me the mysteries the soldiers\nhave reported to us? But first tell us which of all the stars it is thou\ncomest from.\"\n\n\"Know then, O Zaphnath, that we call our star the Earth, and in her\nwanderings she hath now approached so near to the great Orb of Day that\nher rays are paled by his brighter light; she sets with him, and shines\nno more by night. But yet a few days now, and she shall triumph even\nover him, and, entering on his glowing disc, she shall be seen at\nmid-day, obscuring his light and travelling as a spot across his glory.\"\n\nThe old men wagged their beards as the boy translated, but he sprang to\nhis feet with no little excitement, and exclaimed,--\n\n\"Meanest thou that blue star with its attendant speck of white, which\nbut a little while ago shone with great brightness as a Twilight Star?\"\n\n\"That is the Earth, O Zaphnath, the world from whence we came,\" I\nexclaimed; and the youth again threw off his wig and beard, and rushing\ntoward me, pressed first his right cheek and then his left cheek against\nmine, and then against the doctor's.\n\n\"Then ye are most welcome to the land of Kem, and we shall be friends\nfor ever. For ye should know that my mother was barren all the years of\nher life until this same Blue Star came to shine wondrously, even in the\npresence of the Day-Giver, before his setting. It was then, under the\nbeneficent influence of this star, that she gave birth to me. And when\nthe star paled and wandered again I tarried not in the land of my\nfather, but came strangely hither, to be ruler in a great land which my\npeople had never known.\"\n\nWhen he had resumed his seat again, I said, \"All that I have told thee\nshalt thou see come to pass, and through this Larger Eye, which we have\nmade to pierce the deep of space, thou shalt see more clearly that the\nBlue Star is indeed a great orb, where many men may dwell, and after she\nhath passed the Day-Giver, she will appear as a bright morning star\nagain to announce his coming.\"\n\n\"Why now, if this be true, then every one of these old men must die. For\nPharaoh's laws provide that whatsoever wise man faileth to predict such\nan appearance, or predicteth one which doth not occur, must lose his\nlife. These grey-beards, always jealous of me, have said that the Blue\nStar, which beareth my destiny, hath disappeared, never to be seen\nagain. Now, when they are slain, Pharaoh shall appoint you to sit in\ntheir places. Ye shall reign jointly with Zaphnath if it pleaseth you,\nand ye may choose what seemeth good to you of everything that is in the\nland of Kem and in all the countries which pay tribute unto Pharaoh. And\nhe will give you as wives all the women ye saw in Long Breath Park, and\nan equal part of all the slaves and women taken in war will he give you\nalso. For hath he not bidden me treat generously with you, even to his\ntributary countries and half his women?\"\n\n\"We come from a star, O Zaphnath, where men desire many things and are\nnever satisfied. But of all the things thou offerest us, we wish not\none. We make no peace unless these old men be left alive. We do not know\nthis country or its people, wherefore we are most unfit to rule them. We\nwish no slaves, but will pay a hire to one or two good men, who may do\nour daily tasks. And as for women, we never choose but one, and then\nonly when we know her well and find her equally willing.\"\n\n\"Then are ye come from a most strange star indeed! But I must tell thee\nthat the laws of the Kemi forbid even to the Pharaoh, who hath the first\nclaim upon all women, to take to wife a woman such as her whose hand\nthou clingest to so warmly. What findest thou in her whose dumb tongue\ncould never tell thy praises, and if 'twere loosened, her mind would\nstill be dumb and silent?\"\n\n\"Who is this woman, then, whom thou sentest out to meet us? She alone\nhath had no fear, and hath greeted us in a friendly and a welcome\nmanner. Had it not been for her, we might still have been loosening our\nthunder among your soldiers, or flashing this lightning in thy face!\" I\nsaid, half drawing my long sword as I spoke.\n\n\"She is Thenocris, a poor, unfortunate maiden, dumb of tongue and mind,\"\nhe answered. \"In my country we would call her mute and senseless, but\nhere among the Kemi they revere such ill-starred creatures, thinking\nthat because they act strangely, and look not upon the world as others\ndo, their souls must be turned within to the contemplation of hidden and\nspiritual things. They think such creatures know the secrets of the\ngods, and that the gods have made them mute, or speaking only silly\nthings, lest those secrets be revealed. The people, therefore, give them\nalms, and suppose that they are effectual in intercessions with the\ngods. This girl went out at noon, as was her custom, to stand by the\ngate and ask alms. A soldier saw thee seize her hand and hold it\nstrangely long, and he reported this to us. Whereupon these wise men\nwith one accord decided that ye must have come for women, and we set\nabout preparing a peace-offering of two thousand maidens for you in the\nPark. Afterwards there came another soldier later to say that ye had\nlanded in the Park, pleased with our offering of the women. Then rose\nyon grey-beard and argued most wisely thus: That ye, being such strange\ncreatures, had understood best what we understand the least; that thou\nhadst learned the hidden thought of this dumb woman by long holding of\nher hand; that, as ye had been friendly to her, she might be able to\nlead you unto us; and lastly, that it would be no breach of our laws if\nthou tookest this woman to thine own land and madest her thy wife; that\nif we could thus save our city, and the lives of the people, it would be\nwisdom to give her to thee, together with all the women in the Park.\nThen another grey-beard, wishing to share the credit for a wise idea,\narose and insisted that it would be ill in us to keep the strange white\nanimal, which one of the men found upon the plateau. We knew that ye\nmust have brought this, for in all our land we have no four-footed thing\nsmaller than the useful burden-carrying asses ye have seen. Wherefore,\nthe wisdom of the grey-beards being now complete, we sent the dumb girl\nand the white animal out with the soldier, and they have brought you\nhither.\"\n\n\"So you have been falling in love with a queen of your own making, who\nis no more than a dumb idiot!\" chuckled the doctor.\n\n\"Silence!\" I shouted hotly, for I was unspeakably sorry for the poor\ngirl. \"There are softer, kinder words than those by which to call a\npoor blank soul that's born awry. The Kemi are quite right, for this\ngirl, having no sense, has yet been wiser to-day than both of us and all\nthese wise men.\" Then turning, I addressed the ruler in Hebrew:\n\n\"Thou shouldst know that in our land the seizing of the right hand is a\nsalutation of friendship and welcome, much the same as the pressure of\nthe cheek is here. We had vainly tried to signal to your soldiers that\nwe were friendly, and when this woman stretched out her pretty hand I\nwas pleased to seize it warmly. Call thou a soldier now and send her\nsafely home. Let the white rabbit belong henceforth to her. She hath\nunwittingly been God's messenger in bringing us together. Mayhap she\nhath saved the lives of many of the people. Wherefore let them remember\nher, and henceforth treat her kindly. And as for those other women in\nthe Park, bid them all return to their homes, and let it generally be\nknown that there will be peace, and no further war. The terms of truce\nwe will arrange with thee and with the Pharaoh somewhat later. We wish\nno gifts or offerings of peace. No more do we desire than that the\nPharaoh shall entertain us for a season until we learn your ways, and\nthen permit us to live quietly in this, your city, obedient to your\nlaws, and pursuing such careers as our abilities may fit us for.\"\n\n\"All this that ye desire, and more, most gladly shall be done, and a\ngrand festival shall be appointed for this night to celebrate the peace.\nThe Pharaoh will entertain you and his royal friends with feasting and\nwith dancing, and the terms of the compact between us shall then be\nratified.\"\n\nAt this point a grey-beard interrupted the young ruler, and a spirited\nconversation took place between them, after which the youth asked,--\n\n\"Tell me now, are there not many more such men as ye upon the Blue Star,\nwho may come to wage a further war with us?\"\n\n\"Have no fear for that,\" I answered. \"The vessel in which we came is the\nsole means of bridging that vast space, and no more can come, unless\nindeed we bring them. But all of them shall keep the covenant we make\nwith thee.\"\n\nThen Zaphnath held a long consultation with the wise men, which ended by\nthe summoning of three soldiers--one to take the woman home, another to\ncarry the news of peace to the Park and to the people, and the third, as\nI supposed, to convey a message to the Pharaoh; but before the last was\ndespatched, Zaphnath said to me,--\n\n\"Our messengers reported a third curious person with you, having a much\nlarger body and long moving horns. What have ye done with him? Is he\nleft in charge of your travelling house?\"\n\nThen I explained this circumstance to them, as well as the incident of\nmy smoking, which I promised to repeat at the banquet in the evening.\nAfter hearing this they dispatched the third messenger.\n\n\"We have heard, not only that ye breathed smoke and carried flames in\nyour limbs, but that your flesh was of iron, invulnerable to arrows;\nthat ye were stronger than birds, and carried the thunder and lightnings\nof the gods with which to kill; and that ye were able to walk through\nthe air as well as on the ground.\"\n\n\"'Tis true we are stronger than any birds upon our proper star, and that\nwe kill with a thunder and a lightning. Our flesh is tougher and more\nsolid than thine, yet 'tis not of iron. But tell me, what knowest thou\nof iron?\"\n\n\"'Tis a rare, precious metal which we coin for money, but I see thou\ncarriest much of it. Thy thunderers are made of it.\"\n\n\"And hast thou no metal, bright and yellow, such as this?\" I asked,\nexhibiting my gold watch.\n\n\"In truth, the Pharaoh alone is able to possess such riches, and in all\nthe land of Kem there is no such huge lump of it as that!\" he exclaimed\nin wonder, while the sleepy wise men opened their big eyes.\n\n\"We have within our belts many coins of this, which we may barter with\nthe Pharaoh for things more plenteous here.\"\n\n\"Are ye travelling traders then, or what were your occupations on the\nBlue Star? Were ye warriors, rulers, wise men, or owners of the soil?\"\n\n\"My good friend here hath been a wise man, as thou must know from his\ngrey beard,\" I answered, smiling at the doctor. \"He hath been a teacher\nof knowledge to the people, and it was his superior wisdom which\ncontrived the house in which we travelled hither.\"\n\n\"But hath it not been a folly to teach wisdom to the people? When they\nhave learned, the wise man turneth fool! Wisdom groweth ripe by being\nbottled, but whoso poureth it out for every thirsty drinker wasteth good\nwine upon gross beasts!\"\n\n\"In its youth our star held to these opinions, but now it teacheth\nwisdom to every child, and in this manner we have made progress into\nmany things not even dreamed of here. As for my own profession, I have\nbeen a dealer in wheat, the bread-grain of our star. Hast thou here such\na small grain growing at the bearded end of a tall straw?\"\n\n\"In truth, the land of Kem raiseth so large a store of such a grain as\nto feed all the surrounding countries! Our greatest traffic is in this\nwheat. Hast thou not seen the green fields of it lining the banks of the\nNasr-Nil, until the sight tires following it? This season there cometh\nsuch a crop as Kem hath never seen before, and for six years we have\nbeen blest with its plenty----\"\n\nHere he was interrupted by the hurried return of the third messenger,\nwho addressed him in excited tones. As the Kemi use no gestures, and\nbut little facial expression in their conversation, I could not guess\nthe import of his message. Therefore when it was translated by the youth\nit was all the more surprising.\n\n\"The soldier saith that a certain curious man of Kem, anxious to explore\nthy travelling house, ventured within it, when presently it rose and\nsailed away with him far out of the city, and was lost from sight in the\nred distance!\"\n\nThis was an unforeseen, stupefying development. I left the doctor to\nguard our things, and rushing out I leaped the courtyard wall and ran\nwith all haste to the Park. The projectile was gone! No sign or trace of\nit was anywhere to be seen. Willingly or not, we were henceforth chained\nto Mars!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe Iron Men from the Blue Star\n\n\nReturning from Long Breath, I could not but notice the entire subsidence\nof the terror, which had previously been so marked, and the general\nsigns of rejoicing which were now taking its place. It was easy to see\nthat I was an object of absorbing interest and busy comment. No one\npointed the finger at me, for that rude gesture was as unknown as it was\nunnecessary. The mere turning of a great pair of eyes quickly in my\ndirection was an indication, significant enough, that I was being\ndenoted.\n\nI now understood the more composed behaviour of the women. They were\naccustomed to the idea of being taken in war, and never suffered\nslaughter or hardship thereby, but merely a change of masters. As they\nnow left the Park they eyed me curiously, as if wondering from what sort\nof new master they had escaped. I imagined I could detect some signs of\ndisappointment among them, at being cheated out of a trip to a new star\nor being dismissed from the service of a god. Occasionally one of them\nwould incline her head gently to the right to meet her rising hand, in a\ndignified salutation. I approached one of the fairest of these and\nextended my hand. She seemed rather surprised, but calmly placed an iron\ncoin in my palm! Evidently I must make haste to learn the Kemish\nsalutation, or I would pass for a common beggar! My hand certainly did\nlook hard and brown, compared with her perfectly white and transparent\nskin, through which the blood suffused the beautiful pink flush of life.\nBut even if a hotter sun had scorched and tanned my hand, it did not\nlook as dark and tough as the coin, although the soldiers had spread the\nreport that our flesh was of iron.\n\nThe chief business activity in the city seemed to be the transporting\nfrom the surrounding country of an endless number of fibrous bags filled\nwith the bread-grain. I saw some of these bags open in the shops, and\nthe grain was shaped like wheat, but as large and less solid than a\ncoffee berry. Trains of asses bearing these bags were seen in every\nstreet and entering by every gate. Each train of fifteen or twenty asses\nwas driven by a sandalled Martian, wearing the spread bird-wing which\nseemed to denote the Pharaoh's service. The animals had the lazy,\nsluggish, plodding habits which I expected, and in these respects their\ndriver differed very little from them. He gave an occasional long hiss,\nfollowed by a jerky grunt, which sounded like \"sh-h-h-h, kuhnk!\" and\nwas evidently intended to hurry the animals, but it served them quite as\nwell as a lullaby. These drivers, who doubtless had just been hearing\nstories of me, were a little surprised at coming upon me so soon, but\nlooked me over deliberately, as if calculating how much iron money I\nwould make, if there were no waste in the coinage!\n\nBut I hastened back to the doctor at the Palace, being obliged to leap\nthe courtyard wall again, for I was not acquainted with the signal to\ncommand the Terror-birds. He expected no other report of the projectile\nthan the one I brought.\n\n\"The only hope is that the meddling Martian may have turned in but one\nbattery,\" he said. \"In time this will exhaust itself, and the projectile\nwill tumble back upon Mars. If it should strike in the water, it may not\nbe shattered, but of course it might be submerged. The chances that we\nwill ever see it again are extremely remote. If it should be discovered\nanywhere on the planet, it would probably be coined up into money, and\nthe fortune of the Pharaoh would hardly buy us iron enough to make\nanother. Well, the unexpected always happens. It was a fatal mistake\never to have left it.\"\n\n\"If it is gone for good,\" I answered, \"let us hope that this planet may\nsuit us better than the Earth, anyhow. We are certain of an easy\nexistence here at least. One shield will coin into money enough to\nsupply our wants a long time. If we had not been so dreadfully secretive\non Earth, perhaps some one, infringing our ideas, might have built\nanother projectile and sent a relief expedition!\"\n\nPreparations for the banquet were rapidly being made about the Palace by\nmen servants. We saw no female servants, and we learned afterward that\nthey did no menial work, except the serving of the meals, which was\nrather an artistic duty.\n\nWe were conducted to two large ante-chambers, adjoining the banquet\nroom, where we deposited our armament and proceeded to make ourselves at\nhome as well as we could. The rooms were gloomy and poorly lighted, but\na great number of servants were busy waiting upon us, and one presently\nbrought in four portable gas-burners, placing them in a circle about my\nhead as I reclined on a large pillow of soft down, laid on the floor.\nThese burners thus furnished both heat and light, and nearly all the\nrooms were thus lighted and heated throughout the day. They had windows\nand a very thick, coarse, translucent but not transparent glass in them.\nBut as the sunlight was never strong, rooms were rarely ever light\nenough for comfort without the flames of gas.\n\nThis was my first acquaintance with Martian gases, which I soon found to\nbe very numerous and various in use. On the other hand, very few liquids\nexisted. The atmospheric pressure was so low that what might have\nexisted normally as liquids on Earth, took the form of heavy gases here.\nIn every case they were heavier than the air, so that they remained in\nvessels just as a liquid would have done. The four lamps were made of\nreeds and shaped like the letter U. The right-hand side of the U was a\nlarge vertical reed, connecting neatly at the bottom with a very much\nsmaller reed forming the other prong and terminating at the top in a tip\nof baked earth, turned downward, so that it would discharge the gas away\nfrom the lamp. A light stone weight was fitted to slide neatly down the\nlarge vertical tube in which the gas was stored, and thus force the gas\nup to the burner in the smaller tube. If a brighter light was desired, a\nheavier weight was put on, and to extinguish the light it was only\nnecessary to lift the weight, which cut off the supply from the burner.\n\nWhile lying on the downy floor-cushion, I was strangely annoyed by the\nfaint and distant howling of a dog. It seemed to come from the banquet\nroom adjoining mine, or from the doctor's room on the other side. I\ncalled in the doctor, who said he heard nothing and had seen no dogs on\nMars. He tried to make me believe it was a fancy of mine. But presently\nwhen a servant entered, he seemed to hear it instantly, for he turned\nquickly about and left, but it was fully half an hour later before the\nplaintive howling ceased.\n\n\"These Kemish people have better ears than we have,\" I remarked to the\ndoctor.\n\n\"Yes, both their ears and eyes are much better suited to the conditions\nof fainter light, and higher, thinner sounds. There may be music at the\nbanquet to-night which we cannot hear at all in some of its notes.\"\n\n\"If there are no foods whose delicate flavours we fail to taste, I shall\nbe able to get along quite well. I am extremely hungry, and quite ready\nfor a change of fare.\" We had only eaten a hasty lunch when we had\nre-entered the projectile at Long Breath to await the return of the\nsoldier.\n\nZaphnath himself came to conduct us to the banquet room, and we were\nmuch surprised at its dark and gloomy character. The entire vast\nenclosure had but twenty-one flickering fire-brands, suspended overhead\nand in front of us, to furnish light. There were no tables or chairs, no\nflowers or decorations, no sign of anything to eat. Other guests were\nmoving about through the semi-darkness to their places, seemingly\nwithout inconvenience. I was whispering to the doctor that I would need\neyes of much greater candle power to enjoy the function, when we arrived\nat our places. A double row of comfortable cushions ran along the edge\nof our floor, where it seemed to sink to a lower terrace, whence we\ncould hear the indistinct hum of women's voices. Zaphnath took his seat\non a raised cushion in the middle of the row, and motioned me to the\ncushion on his right and the doctor to his left. Eighteen other guests\nnow reclined upon their cushions to left and right, so that we were all\narranged in a direct line, facing the lower terrace whence came the\nfeminine buzz. Directly opposite each of us was an empty cushion, but no\ntable.\n\nI was wondering at it all when the fire-brand farthest from me suddenly\nexploded a great flaming ball of fire, and we all sprang to our feet.\nFrom the terrace below came a grand burst of reed music, a swelling\nchorus of women's voices, and then each fire-brand in quick succession\nexploded a burst of flame, which floated down toward the dancing women,\nbut expired above their heads. I soon saw that these white fire-balls,\nwhich continued in quick succession throughout the banquet, and afforded\nus a glorious if a somewhat appalling light, were caused by the\nsuccessive discharges of small volumes of heavy gas from twenty-one\nreed-tanks in the comb of the roof, one above each of the fire-brands.\nWhen the discharged gas had floated down to the fire-brand beneath it,\nthere was a quick, bright explosion, and the flame sank menacingly\ntoward the women below.\n\nThe burst of music, the chorus of huzzahs, and the flashing forth of\nlight, proved to be a welcome to the Pharaoh, who was standing proudly\non his great throne opposite us, across the terrace and somewhat higher,\nwhence he could look down upon the dancers and singers. He wore a crown\nof thin iron, surmounted by a golden asp. His elaborately curled wig did\nnot conceal his ears, from which large golden pendants hung almost to\nhis shoulders. His own beard was waxed and curled, and trimmed to the\nshape of a beaver's tail. His dress is best described by calling it a\nfeather velvet, edged with flaring wing and tail plumes of iridescent\ncolours. In this feather cloth there was none of the rough, gaudy show\nof the savage, but a discriminating, tasteful blending of colours and\nharmony of design, imitated from the beauty of the bird itself.\n\nGrouped about him on the approaches to his throne were one-and-twenty of\nhis favourite women, beautifully dressed in feather textures, with the\ncurved neck and head of a bird surmounting their brows. But their\ncostume was scant and simple compared with that of the dancing girls\nbelow us. They wore a wonderful head-dress, composed of the entire body\nof a small peacock. The head and neck were arched over the forehead, the\nback fitted tightly, like a hat over their head, the drooping wings\ncovered their ears, while the fully spread tail arched above their head\nin its wonderful opalescence. Much of the snowy whiteness of their backs\nand breasts was bare, and a downy feather ribbon circled the necks,\nwrists, and ankles. A two-headed iron serpent with golden eyes clasped\nthe upper arm and gartered the knee, but no jewels of any kind were to\nbe seen. All the dancers carried long decorated reeds, which they\nflourished wondrously, and with which occasionally they executed the\nmost surprising leaps. While there was a stateliness about their\nmovements, there were also the most startling acrobatic surprises, made\npossible by the feeble gravity.\n\nThe singing women, or what might be called the chorus, were in twelve\nsets, each group clad in a different colour or design of feather-silk.\nTheir head-dress, while composed of the entire body of a bird of\nplumage, lacked the flamboyant tail of the peacock. The music was weird\nand whimsical, as there were neither stringed nor brass instruments. It\nwas made wholly by women playing upon a vast variety of drums and reeds.\nThere were all sizes of whistling reeds or flutes; several of these of\ndifferent lengths were grouped into one instrument like the pipes of\nPan; a series of long hollow reeds, when rapidly struck, gave forth a\nmarvellous cadence; while groups of small drums, of different size and\ntensity, gave curious tones. The whole effect was weirdly eloquent,\nrather than racy or exciting.\n\nWhen the burst of welcome was ended, Zaphnath stretched forth his hand\nand exclaimed, first to us in Hebrew, and then in Kemish,--\n\n\"O Pharaoh, whose power and wisdom from all the Pharaohs have descended,\nbehold, I bring unto thee these two iron men from the Blue Star, who,\nthough excelling in the arts of war, are yet pleased to come out of the\nruddy heavens to practise peace amongst us!\"\n\nAnd thus did Zaphnath translate the Pharaoh's response to us:--\n\n\"Unto Ptah, the Centre of Things, to whom the myriad stars of the\nheavens are but ministering slaves, I, Pharaoh of Kem, do give you\nwelcome. Whatever pleaseth you in the largeness of this rich land, or in\nthe matchless beauty of our women, shall be unto you as if ye had owned\nit always.\"\n\nWhereupon the other guests turned toward us with the right hand upon the\ncheek, and we awkwardly attempted the same salutation. Then a group of\nthe singing women, twenty-one in number, tripping to the weird music,\ncame up the steps which led to our floor, carrying covered dishes. At\nthe top they turned and saluted the Pharaoh, and then took their places,\none upon each of the cushions opposite us. Before uncovering the dishes\nthey took me a little by surprise, by bending forward and pressing their\nwarm, pink cheek against the right cheek of the guest they were about to\nserve. My maiden unconsciously shivered a little, for my cheek must have\nfelt cold, even though my surprised blushes did their best to warm it.\nHer dish, when opened, contained nothing but flowers, waxy white, but\nemitting a delicately sweet perfume. She held them toward my face, and\npresently breathed gently across them, as if to waft their perfume to\nme. Then scattering them about my cushion, she pressed her left cheek\nto mine, arose and tripped down the steps again. There was a modest\nself-possession about her which enchanted me, and I hoped she would soon\nreturn bringing something more substantial.\n\nBut another group of maidens, differently clothed, had already begun to\nmount towards us with earthen goblets and reed-pitchers, which looked as\nif they might contain wine. Dropping on her knees on the cushion before\nme, this maiden saluted me as the other had done. Then sitting\ngracefully before me, she tipped her reed pitcher toward the goblet, and\npoured out apparently nothing! But, watching the others, I saw them\ncarry the goblet to their lips and draw a deep breath from it, while\ntipping it as one might a glass of wine. I did the same, and inhaled a\ndeep draught of stimulating, wine-flavoured gas, which, when I exhaled\nit through the nostrils, proved to be deliciously perfumed.\n\n\"I have heard of some poets who could dine upon the fragrance of flowers\nand sup the sweetness of a woman's kiss, but I am hungry for grosser\nthings,\" I whispered to the doctor.\n\n\"There are ten other groups of these serving maidens to come up to us,\"\nhe replied. \"They will certainly bring us something more tangible before\nit is over. Meantime, while we are in Kem, let us imitate the Kemish;\"\nand I must say he was succeeding remarkably well.\n\nThe next maiden who tripped up toward me was wonderfully beautiful and\nmost becomingly dressed. I was a little disappointed that, upon taking\nher place on the cushion in front of me, she omitted the salutation the\nothers had given. However, she carried a small flask in her right hand,\nwhich she placed near my mouth. Then opening the top of it slightly, it\njetted forth a deliciously perfumed fine spray, which moistened my lips.\nWaiting just a moment for me to enjoy the perfume, she then pressed her\npretty cheeks in turn against my lips, until they were soft and dry.\nThis was the nearest approach to a kiss which I saw among these people,\nand I learned it was given always just before eating solid food. The\nplate she carried to me contained small morsels of fish, served upon\nneat little wheaten cakes. There was no knife, fork, chopstick, or\nanything of that kind, but each little cake was lifted with its morsel\nof fish, and they were together just a delicate mouthful. This maiden\nquite took my fancy, and I watched her evolutions and listened for her\nvoice in the chorus during the rest of the banquet, for she had no more\nserving to do.\n\nAfter this course Zaphnath arose, and waving to the music and singing to\ncease, he thus addressed the Pharaoh:--\n\n\"It doth appear, O Pharaoh, that these visitors of ours come from a\nstrange, small world, where, though much is done, but little is enjoyed.\nAt thy bidding I have offered unto them all the luxuries of Kem, such\nas our people strive all their lives for, and dying still desire; but\nthey wish no gifts or presents. Like slaves they only wish to work, but\nat some noble, fitting occupation. This younger man, whose wondrous\nlearning hath taught him to speak even the tongues of other worlds, hath\nbeen a great handler of grain upon his proper star, and for him the\nfitting occupation is not far to seek. Thou knowest how the gathering of\nthy bounteous harvests hath distracted my own attention from weightier\nmatters; wherefore, O Pharaoh, I do entreat thee to put into his charge\nthe labour of gathering, storing, and distributing all thy harvests; and\nas a fitting compensation, let him have one measure of grain for every\ntwenty that he shall gather for thee.\"\n\nNothing could have suited my wishes and abilities better, and my pay on\nEarth had been only one measure in five hundred. The Pharaoh's reply was\nthus translated to us,--\n\n\"The gods put into thy mouth, O Zaphnath, only the ripeness of their\nwisdom, and Pharaoh granteth thy requests ere they are uttered. But what\ndesireth the wise man?\"\n\nTo this I made answer for the doctor,--\n\n\"When thou knowest his wondrous wisdom touching many things, O Pharaoh,\nthou mayest think fit to give him a place among thy wise men, where they\nmay learn from him and he from them. Will it please thee to send a\nslave for the Larger Eye and have it placed by yonder window, and he\nwill presently show unto thee many of the wonders of the starry heavens\nthat are hidden beyond the reach of man's unaided vision.\"\n\nWhile two slaves were despatched in charge of a soldier to bring the\ntelescope, we were served with a highly-sparkling, gas-charged wine,\nwhich further whetted my appetite. Then came another maiden with a small\nroast bird, neatly and delicately carved, and each tempting piece was\nlaid upon a small lozenge of bread. I never ate anything with more\nrelish.\n\nThere was an excited buzz among the women, and the Pharaoh himself was\nvisibly affected at the sight of the telescope, whose burnished brass\nwas evidently mistaken for gold. The doctor mounted it upon the backs of\nslaves near a high window, whence there was a good view of the heavens,\nand signalled to me to explain its use.\n\n\"O Zaphnath, wilt thou make known unto the Pharaoh, and these, his\nguests, that the wondrous value of this instrument lieth not in its\nbright and glistening appearance, but in the farther reach and truer\nvision of the heavenly bodies which it affordeth us. With this we\nascertain all and far more than yon monstrous Gnomons tell thee; we\nlearn the periods of the day, the seasons of the year, and vastly more\nthan our common tongue hath words to tell thee of. Tell me, what\ncallest thou yon risen orb, which hasteneth a rapid backward journey\nthrough the heavens?\" I asked, indicating the full disc of Phobos.\n\n\"That is the Perverse Daughter, sole disobedient Child of Night, whose\nstubborn, contrary ways are justly punished by her mother. For she must\ndraw a veil across her brilliant face for a brief period during every\nhasty trip she makes.\"\n\n\"Behold her, then, just entering upon her punishment!\" I exclaimed, for\nthe regular eclipse was just beginning. \"Look! and tell us all thou\nseest.\"\n\n\"I see a glorious orb, far larger than the Day-Giver and very near to\nPtah! But it is the Perverse Daughter, grown larger and come nearer, for\nshe alone knoweth how to draw the veil of night across her face like\nthat. Now she hath fully hidden! It is most wonderful, O Pharaoh!\"\n\n\"Be not deceived by mere appearance, O Zaphnath,\" replied the Pharaoh.\n\"All that thou seest may be contained within the thing thou gazest into.\n'Tis true, the Perverse Daughter hath drawn her veil, but be thou sure\nthou seest what is beyond and not merely what is within.\"\n\nAs soon as this was translated to us, the doctor focussed the telescope\nupon the Gnomons, which were just visible over the edge of the plateau,\nand I said,--\n\n\"Look now again, and behold all the familiar features of the landscape,\nthe plateau yonder and the ponderous Gnomons, which could never be\ncontained within this little enclosure.\"\n\n\"'Tis all most true, O Pharaoh, and with this little instrument thy\nreign may be more glorious, and come to greater wisdom, than any of that\nlong line of Pharaohs, whose toiling slaves have built the towering\nGnomons. Let this grey-beard be made chief of all thy wise men; let the\nothers teach him our language and make him acquainted with all our\nmonuments and records; also command them to record most faithfully all\nthe wonders which he is able to reveal. Mayhap he may be able to write\nthy name among the stars of night, to shine for ever, instead of upon\nthe crumbling stone which telleth of thy ancestors!\"\n\n\"O men of Kem,\" replied the Pharaoh, addressing the other guests, \"hear\nye the wisdom of Zaphnath, which cometh with the swift wings of birds,\nwhile thy halting counsel stumbleth slowly upon the lazy legs of asses!\nWhat Zaphnath asketh hath already been decreed touching these two men\nfrom the Blue Star, provided only that they live peaceably among us\nobedient to our laws.\"\n\nWe assured him of our obedience and our best efforts to discharge our\nnew duties, whereupon the feast continued. Courses of small birds' eggs\nand of fruits and confections were each served by a separate group of\nmaidens. When the feast was finally completed, I turned to Zaphnath with\nmy cigars and said,--\n\n\"In our travelling house I brought with me many such things as these and\nothers of a smaller, milder form, which might delight the women; but now\nthat the house is gone, I have but three, one of which wilt thou send to\nthe Pharaoh, one keep for thyself, and the other I will smoke to show\nyou the manner of it. There is naught to fear about them; your taste for\nheavy vapours will have prepared you to enjoy the warmth and fragrance\nof this peculiar weed.\"\n\nA servant came to carry the one to the Pharaoh, and I struck a match\nupon the stone floor and held the cigar designed for Zaphnath in the\nflame. Then I touched the flame to my own, and puffing gently, I asked\nZaphnath to do the same. When I saw that his custom of inhaling gases\nled him to breathe in the smoke, I puffed very slowly and gently, until\nhe should become accustomed to it. When Pharaoh saw that it did no harm\nto Zaphnath, he lighted his own and inhaled the smoke in long draughts\nwith evident gusto.\n\n\"How sayest thou, O Zaphnath,\" he said at last. \"Is not this warm vapour\nmost stimulating? It is a treat worth all the rest of the banquet.\nContinual feasting hath made the luxuries of Kem to pall upon me, but\nthis hath novelty and comfort in it. If, indeed, there were many of\nthese in thy travelling house, my slaves shall search all the width and\nbreadth of Ptah, until it be found.\"\n\nThe music now burst forth again in new volume, and the singing girls\nwent through a new evolution, which broke up their groups and formed\ntwelve new ones, containing one girl from each of the previous sets.\nThen the entire number began ascending the steps together, and I noted\nthat those approaching me were the twelve maidens who had served me\nduring the banquet. They came and circled around me, and presently\nstopped with their hands upon their cheeks in salute. The other groups\ndid the same to the guests they had served, and each guest selected a\nmaiden by saluting her upon the cheek, whereupon she left her circle and\ntook her position upon the cushion opposite him. Zaphnath, seeing that\nwe did not understand this ceremony, explained it to me.\n\n\"It is an ancient custom with the Pharaoh to present each of his guests\nwith a living reminder of the occasion and his hospitality. Wherefore he\ndesireth thee to choose which of the twelve serving maidens hath pleased\nthee best, and he will give her to thee, to be always thy maidservant.\"\n\nI translated this to the doctor, and watched him curiously, with an\ninquiring twinkle in my eye.\n\n\"Let us accept them, and bestow their liberty upon them,\" he said.\n\nI immediately chose the third maiden, who had pressed her pink cheeks to\nmy lips, and when she came to sit opposite to me upon the cushion, I\nspoke to her through Zaphnath,--\n\n\"Thy ways have pleased me, but upon my star we do not think it proper\nto own any slaves. When we know well-favoured and graceful women, such\nas thou art, we prefer to be their slaves, rather than they ours. If I\ncould take thee with me to the Earth, the laws there would set thee free\nto do whatever pleased thee best. Wishest thou that I make thee free\nhere?\"\n\nShe was evidently surprised when Zaphnath put this question to her. She\nreplied in a sincere and pleading tone, but her words astonished me,--\n\n\"Whatever the dark Man of Ice wisheth, I will do. I know not why he hath\nasked what I desire. He speaketh of freedom, but I beseech him not to\nsend me back to that! I was born an unhappy and masterless maiden, and\nmany years I struggled and laboured for a miserable existence. I drove\nasses, gleaned in the fields, and did the menial work of men. But I felt\nI was fit for better, nobler things. At last, I heard that the armies of\nthe Pharaoh were coming to my land, and I took heed of my appearance,\nput on my neatest feather clothing, and went to throw myself before the\nsoldiers. They were pleased with me, and brought me to this city, where\nfortune favoured me, and Pharaoh, looking over all the women whom the\nsoldiers brought from the wars, chose me, with many others, to join his\nhousehold. And here in the Palace for a few years I have been happy and\nwell cared for. I pray thee do not turn me out again; do not degrade me\nto the labour and misery of freedom. Even the beasts have masters! They\nare housed, and fed, and cared for; why should I then be cast out and\nleft to drudge or beg?\"\n\n\"Doth she mean this?\" I exclaimed. \"What then is the chief aim of women\nin Kem? What is the highest state to which they may aspire?\"\n\n\"'Tis a strange, simple question!\" he answered. \"There is no greater\nblessing for a woman than to belong to the household of the Pharaoh.\nHere they are delighted with constant music and dancing; their beauty is\ncultivated and heightened by rich and tasteful clothing; and their\ncharms and graces may win for them a selection as one of the\none-and-twenty favourites of the Pharaoh. What they fear most is being\nchosen and carried away by guests whose palaces and ways of life are\nless luxurious than the Pharaoh's.\"\n\n\"Why then, as we have no palaces and wish no slaves, it were best to\nreturn these maidens to the Pharaoh if they will be happier and better\ncared for here than anywhere else in all the land of Kem,\" I said to\nZaphnath.\n\n\"This age is not ripe for the grand idea of freedom which dominates our\nown,\" remarked the doctor, as we returned the grateful maidens to the\nconstant delights of an ornate and sensuous slavery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nParallel Planetary Life\n\n\nI was sleeping soundly on my deliciously soft heap of downy pillows,\nwhen in the early morning I was awakened by a pounding on the door of\nthe ante-chamber. As one always wakens from a sound sleep with his most\nfamiliar language upon his tongue, I cried out in English, \"Who's\nthere?\" The doctor answered, wishing to be let in. I fumbled about in\nthe darkness sleepily, and opened the door, and he lighted two of my\ngas-lamps with the one he carried. He looked rather tired and worn.\n\n\"I am possessed by a tyrant idea, which will not let me sleep,\" he said.\n\"I must get rid of it before morning. Come, get your senses about you,\nand listen to me,\" he commanded, as I yawned and rubbed my fists into my\neyes, blinded by the sudden strong light.\n\n\"If you think I can sleep with it any better than you can, out with it,\"\nI answered.\n\n\"How does it happen that a young Hebrew is ruler over all these people?\"\nhe demanded.\n\n\"Do you lie awake thinking up conundrums?\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"On Earth, what notable Jews have been rulers over a great people not of\ntheir own race?\" he continued.\n\n\"Disraeli in England, Joseph in Egypt, and--well, that is all I can\nthink of just now.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that is enough. Egypt was the greatest grain-raising country in\nJoseph's time, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" I answered. \"And Joseph's rule began with seven years\nof most wonderful crops.\"\n\n\"Zaphnath told us this morning that the seventh great crop, and the most\nplenteous of all, is now growing,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"What has that to do with Joseph? We are not on Earth, but on Mars. Have\nyou been dreaming? Zaphnath is---- But, by the way, Joseph's Egyptian\nname was Zaphnath-paaneah, meaning a revealer of secrets! When I heard\nthat name this morning, I thought it was strangely familiar. Pharaoh\ncalled him that when he appointed him ruler, because he had interpreted\nhis dream,\" I said, just realizing the very peculiar coincidence.\n\n\"You are as good as a Bible!\" cried the doctor. \"Perhaps you can also\nremember by which of Jacob's wives Joseph was born?\"\n\n\"Of course I can. He was the first son of Rachel, the wife whom Jacob\nreally loved, and worked fourteen years to secure.\"\n\n\"But how could he have ten older brothers, if he was Rachel's first\nson?\" he demanded, a little perplexed.\n\n\"They were all the sons of her sister Leah and her handmaidens. Rachel\nwas barren all her life until Joseph was born,\" I explained.\n\n\"And Zaphnath said this morning that his mother was barren all the years\nof her life that the Blue Star wandered. He also called himself revealer\nof God's hidden things.\"\n\n\"Yes; and it struck me as peculiar at the time that he said of '_God's_'\nnot of '_the gods'_,'\" I reflected. \"Evidently he thinks there is but\none God. The whole matter is altogether peculiar.\"\n\n\"Here are the facts,\" replied the doctor. \"Listen to them attentively.\nWe have dropped down into a civilization here upon Mars which coincides\nin every important particular with that of the Ancient Egyptians on\nEarth. They are great builders, erecters of monuments, raisers of grain,\npolygamists, and they now have a young Hebrew ruler, corresponding in\nevery important respect with Joseph. We chance to have arrived during\nthe seventh year of plenty of Joseph's rule. Grain abounds; the soil\nbrings it forth 'by handfuls.' It is, 'as the sand of the sea, very\nmuch,' and the Pharaoh, probably at the suggestion of his young ruler,\nis storing it up----\"\n\n\"By all the Patriarchs!\" I interrupted. \"They are running a wheat\ncorner, and I didn't know it! Go on, go on!\"\n\n\"These are all very singular coincidences with a history which was\nenacted many thousands of years ago on Earth. Now, how can you explain\ntheir strange recurrence here?\" he queried.\n\n\"How should I know? I haven't been lying awake! How do you explain\nthem?\" I asked, full of interest.\n\n\"I have tossed on my pillows in there for three hours evolving a theory\nfor it. If it is correct, our opportunities here in Kem are simply\nenormous. Now listen, and don't interrupt me. The Creator has given all\nthe habitable planets the same great problem of life to work out. Every\none of His worlds in its time passes through the same general history.\nThis runs parallel on all of them, but at a different speed on each. The\nswift ones, nearest to the sun, have hurried through it, and may be\nclose upon the end. But this is a slow planet, whose year is almost\ntwice as long as the Earth's, and more than three times that of Venus.\nThe seasons pass sluggishly here, and history ripens slowly. This world\nhas only reached that early chapter in the story equivalent to Ancient\nEgypt on Earth. We have forged far ahead of that, and on Venus they have\nworked out far more of the story than we know anything about. If Mercury\nis habitable yet, his people may have reached almost the end, but it is\nmost probable that life has not started there; when it does begin, it\nwill be worked out four times as rapidly as it has on Earth.\"\n\n\"Then a seven years' famine will begin here next year, and I am in\ncharge of the world's entire wheat supply!\" I gasped, almost overwhelmed\nby the speculative possibilities which this unfolded.\n\n\"It is not likely that there will be more than a general similarity of\nthe history. But Zaphnath has told us that this is the seventh year of\nplenty. If the famine begins soon, it will be fair to suppose it will\nfor about seven crops. In its later developments the entire history may\nchange when the crucial period comes, and have a very different outcome.\nBut we are now almost at the beginnings of civilized history. Joseph,\nthe first Jew in Egypt, is a ruler here, and your entire race must\nfollow him hither, and pass through a miserable captivity. Even if you\nremained here all your life, you would not last that long; but upon the\nlater doings of your people and their treatment of the Martian Messiah,\nwhen He comes, depend the future conditions of this planet. Will it be\ndifferent then from the Earthly story? It is an extremely interesting\ntheory to follow to the end, but that would take thousands of years, and\nwe are concerned with the present.\"\n\n\"Doctor, if this theory be true, then we are nothing short of prophets\nhere!\" I exclaimed, still struggling with the wonderful bearings of the\nidea on our personal welfare.\n\n\"In a general way we are prophets, but Zaphnath has forestalled us on\nimmediate matters. Let us keep our own counsel as to any foreknowledge.\nIf we disclose it, we may suddenly lose our opportunities, and, besides,\nwe shall be powerless to change history here in any important respect.\"\n\n\"I might prevent Zaphnath from bringing all Israel down into Egypt, and\nthus save them from that captivity,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Then you would forestall a Moses, and prevent the miraculous\ndeliverance of your people, and all the paternal care which God bestowed\nupon them during that time. You will never be able to do this. Zaphnath\nis in the way. He is headstrong and wilful. He is an active thinker and\na hard worker among a race of idlers, who live only to enjoy the fulness\nof a rich land. He knows the greater activity and industry of his own\npeople, and he will wish to make them masters of this goodly land. I\nwill warrant that his head is full of plans at this very moment for\nbringing his old father and all his race down here to give them\nimportant places. See how readily he gave the keystone of the whole\nsituation to you. It will pay you better to keep on good terms with him.\nInstead of trying to change the situation, let us make the best of it as\nwe find it.\"\n\n\"Well, I must say the present situation is attractive enough to me,\" I\nsaid, and then inquired, \"How many gold coins have you, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I have only a hundred half eagles and a little silver coin,\" he\nreplied; \"and I wish to be very sure of the correctness of my theory\nbefore I undertake any speculations with that.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! What is money for, but to double, and then to double the\nresult again!\" I exclaimed. \"You work out this great theory, and then\nfail to grasp its commercial importance to us. You and I will embark in\nthe grain business, with our entire stock of gold, the first thing in\nthe morning. We have iron enough to live on.\"\n\n\"I didn't come here to go into business,\" he answered. \"I have a grand\nscientific career to pursue, and last night's appointment puts me in\njust the position to carry it out.\"\n\n\"Go ahead with it then, but invest your gold coins in my enterprise. I\nwill manage it all,\" I said, reaching for my belt under my pillow. \"I\nhave here three hundred eagles and one hundred double eagles,--five\nthousand dollars in all. I scarcely need your five hundred dollars, but\nI don't wish to see you left out, and buying bread of me at a dollar a\nloaf in a short time. Gold must have an enormous value here, considering\nthe small amount of it used as ornaments in the Pharaoh's household, and\nthe general currency of iron money. Three of these double eagles would\nmake a pair of ear pendants equal to his. I wonder how he would like to\nhave pure gold bracelets on all his women instead of those rough iron\nthings? And wheat must be cheaper than dirt after seven enormous crops.\nI will buy all the grain he has to sell before to-morrow night! Even if\nyour theory is all wrong, we can't lose much.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, but we may as well be sure,\" he replied\ncautiously. \"You can find out much by a few discreet questions to\nZaphnath in the morning.\"\n\n\"The trouble about the whole matter is, that I will be obliged to do\nbusiness through him altogether until we learn this language. Come, you\nmust contribute your share. I have furnished the Hebrew, you must learn\nthe Kemish at once through those wise men. But I can't wait for that. I\nwill make Zaphnath teach me the necessary shop words and stock phrases\nfor carrying on the grain business to-morrow. I can't perform my new\nduties unless he does that.\"\n\nHowever, the doctor did not respond wholly to my new enthusiasm. He was\nsleepy, and retired yawning to his own room to get the rest which had\nevaded him. But I lay and tossed on the pillows, revolving a hundred\nplans, and feeling anything but sleepy. Presently I thought of a scheme,\nwhich would demonstrate whether there was anything in the doctor's\ntheory. I knew it would just suit him, and I sprang up and knocked\ngently on his door, saying,--\n\n\"I have it, Doctor. Here is the very idea!\" There was no answer, so I\nknocked louder and listened. I heard him breathing heavily in deep\nslumber. After all, the morrow would do for ideas; just then he needed\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA Plagiarist of Dreams\n\n\nBeing unable to sleep, I arose early to get the refreshment of a morning\nwalk. I passed quietly through the next room, where the doctor was still\nsleeping soundly, out into the courtyard. I was scarcely outside when I\nheard a familiar, excited barking, and Two-spot ran across the open\nspace toward me as fast as his four short legs and his very active tail\nwould carry him. His frantic jumping up toward me was extremely comical,\nfor he sprang with more than twice the swiftness I was accustomed to\nseeing, almost to a level with my face, but he fell very slowly to the\nground with only one third the speed that he would have fallen on Earth.\nHe could jump, with almost the agility of a flea, and yet he fell back\ndeliberately like a gas ball. He was evidently enjoying his muscles as\nmuch as I had mine. When he made a particularly high jump, I caught him\nin my hands and patted him fondly.\n\n\"So you didn't fly away with the projectile? Or, did you go with it, and\nis it safely back again, somewhere? How I wish you could speak my\nlanguage and tell me all you know! These different tongues are a great\nbother, aren't they, Two-spot?\"\n\nHe answered me volubly, but apart from the fact that he quite agreed\nwith me, I could not understand his message. Had I been able to, it\nmight have made a very great difference to me.\n\nThere was a beautiful, filmy snow on the ground, which had fallen during\nthe night. It was scarcely more than a heavy hoar frost, and as the sun\nsprang up without any warning twilight, the snow melted and left the\nsurface damp and fresh. As I afterwards learned, this thin snow fell\nalmost every night of the year, except for the warmest month of summer\nwhen the grain ripened. There were hardly ever any violent storms or\nquick showers. The thin air made heavy clouds or severe atmospheric\nmovements impossible. But the coolness of night, after a day of feeble\nbut direct and tropical sunshine, precipitated the moisture in the form\nof those delightful feathers of darkness. I also learned that the months\nwere distinguished by the time of night when this snow fell; for it was\nprecipitated directly after sunset in the winter, but gradually later\ninto the night as summer advanced, and finally just before daybreak. The\nmonth in which none fell at all was midsummer, of course. It had\nscarcely finished falling this morning when I came out into it.\n\nI sprang to the top of the wall, and was watching the quick rising of\nthe Sun, and enjoying the sensation of looking fixedly at his orb\nwithout being dazzled, when I noticed that there was a dark notch in the\nlower left-hand part of his disc! Soon after I distinguished, somewhat\nfarther in, a faint and smaller dark spot. This must be the beginning of\nthe double transit of the Earth and the Moon! I experienced a sensation\nof joy in finding the home planet again. I confess it had given me a\ncurious shock not to be able to see it in the heavens. It was more\ncomfortable to have it back in the sky again, and at last I knew just\nwhere we were in the calendar. On Earth it was the third day of August,\n1892. The summer there was at its height, and all my friends were as\nbusy and as deeply immersed in their own affairs as if their little spot\nhad no idea of coquetting with the Sun. Possibly a dozen pairs of\nstudious eyes out of the teeming hundreds of millions on Earth were\nturned Marsward. This led me to wonder what all-absorbing topics of\nsport, politics, or war may fill the minds of the possible million\npeople on Venus, when the Earth is so much excited over one of the\ninfrequent and picturesque transits of that planet across the Sun.\n\nBut the doctor and Zaphnath must know of this! I hastened into the\nante-chamber and called out,--\n\n\"Come, get up! I have already discovered two very significant things\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" he asked wearily between yawns.\n\n\"Two-spot and the Earth!\" I exclaimed. \"The former crossed my path in\nthe courtyard, and the latter is just now crossing the Sun. Where is the\ntelescope? quick!\"\n\nThe doctor was not long in propping it up by the east window, and I went\nto look for a servant. By repeating the word \"Zaphnath\" several times, I\nmade him understand that we wished the attendance of the young ruler,\nand he started for him.\n\nBy this time the notch was almost a complete circle of dark shadow\nwithin the lower edge of the Sun. The smaller spot, one-fourth the\ndiameter, was forging ahead like a herald to clear the way. Zaphnath\nsoon arrived, for he lived in another part of the Palace. He quietly\npressed his cheek to mine, but in my excitement I had seized his hand,\nand with a pressure which must have hurt his shrinking flesh, I\nexclaimed,--\n\n\"This is the day of thy greatness, O Zaphnath, for, behold, the Blue\nStar is already upon the face of the Day-Giver!\" I led him hastily to\nthe telescope, and explained to him that the smaller forward spot was\ncaused by a moon like Phobos, and that the Earth was really a round\nball, like the Sun. He looked intently for a long time, and then turning\nabout to me he said,--\n\n\"It is well ye left just when ye did, for the fire of the Day-Giver hath\nby this time burned every living thing upon your star! See how she\nhastens through his hot flames.\"\n\nI attempted to explain that the Earth was more than twice as far from\nthe Sun as she was from us; but he believed the evidence of his eyes,\nand I had to give it up in despair.\n\n\"I pray thee, bring this Larger Eye to the Council Chamber. I must\nsummon all the wise men at once to behold this wonder. How long will it\ncontinue?\"\n\nThe doctor told me it might last almost two hours; but I found it\nimpossible to convey any idea of this period of time to Zaphnath, until\nI told him that it would continue half the time of the crossing of\nPhobos, who had just risen dimly in the west.\n\nWe made a quick breakfast on fruit like grapes and a wheaten gruel, and\nhastened to the chamber where we had been received the day before.\nZaphnath was already there, and so were eleven of the grey-beards. We\ndid not wait for the twelfth, but Zaphnath led the doctor to the place\nat the centre of their oval table, which thus filled all the seats. Then\nthe young ruler ascended his throne and thus addressed them:--\n\n\"While ye have tossed and tumbled in an idle slumber, two things of\ngrave importance have happened touching you. The Pharaoh, acting upon my\nurgent advices, hath appointed this grey-beard from the Blue Star to be\nyour chief; and now the Blue Star herself hath re-appeared upon the\nvery face of the Day-Giver, even as these, her people, told us yesterday\nthat she must do.\"\n\nJust at this point the belated wise man came straggling in, a slow\nsurprise growing upon him when he saw that his seat was taken. Zaphnath\nthen turned, addressing him,--\n\n\"Thou hast not heard, O lazy idler in the lap of morning, what I have\njust spoken to thy brothers? Then go thou to yonder Larger Eye and speak\ntruthfully to these grey-beards all that thou seest.\"\n\nI adjusted the instrument, and placed him in the proper position to see.\nHe looked long and carefully, then left the instrument and looked with\nthe unaided eye. Coming back he gazed again, and finally spoke very\nslowly, as if resigning his life with the words:--\n\n\"I am old, and my sight deceiveth me, O my brothers, for when I gaze\ninto this mysterious instrument the Day-Giver suddenly groweth very\nlarge, and hath two blots of shadow upon the upper half of his\nbrightness. But when I look with my proper eyes, he keeps his size, and\nthere are still spots upon him, but they are upon his lower side.\"\n\nI explained to Zaphnath that the telescope made things look wrong side\nup, just as it made them look larger, and I focussed it upon the Gnomons\nto convince the wise man of this. Then the youth spoke to him again:--\n\n\"The Pharaoh hath appointed this grey-beard from the Blue Star to be\nchief of all the wise men, and as there can be but twelve, thou art no\nlonger one. Unto thee, however, is given the duty of teaching our\nlanguage to the chief. See that thou doest it well, for the lives of all\nof you, having now been forfeited by the law, are in his hands. But so\nlong as his wisdom spares you, ye shall live.\"\n\nAs there was now a lull, I saw an opportunity for my plan which I had\nnot yet found time to explain to the doctor. I translated to him as I\nproceeded, however,--\n\n\"Tell me, O Zaphnath, is it the custom here to relate dreams to the wise\nmen for interpretation? I had last night a most peculiar one, and I will\ngive this golden coin to whomsoever is able to explain its meaning.\" All\nthe great eyes opened wide and round at beholding the eagle I held up to\nview. So large a piece of gold must have been uncommon. The youth\nreplied,--\n\n\"It is, in truth, an obsolete formality to submit dreams to the wise\nmen, for they have interpreted none since I came into Kem. But let us\nhear it; if they cannot make it known, mayhap I can do so.\"\n\n\"I dreamed that I stood by the great river which runneth just without\nthy city walls, and I saw coming up out of the water, as if they had\nbeen fishes, seven familiar beasts, such as I have not seen since I came\nto Kem. Knowest thou here such large, useful animals, each having a long\ntail and four legs, and whose peaceful habit is to eat the grass of the\nfields, which, having digested, the female yieldeth back in a white\nfluid very fit to drink?\"\n\n\"It is kine thou meanest,\" answered Zaphnath. \"In truth there are but\nfew within the city, but they are well known, for in the land of my\nfather my people do naught but to breed and raise them and send them\nhither for ploughing in the fields. At the season of planting thou shalt\nsee many of them.\"\n\n\"I saw seven kine, most sleek and plump of flesh, feeding in a green\nmeadow by the river; but suddenly there came up out of the water in the\nsame manner two lean and shrunken kine, whose withered bones rattled\nagainst their dry skins, they were so poor and hungry. And they stayed\nnot to eat the grass of the meadow, but fell upon and devoured their\nfatter sisters----\"\n\n\"Saidst thou two?\" interrupted Zaphnath.\n\n\"Two of the lean and shrunken, but they ate the fat-fleshed, which were\nseven,\" I answered, watching Zaphnath and the wise men closely, for he\nwas translating to them phrase by phrase as I spoke. He faltered when I\ndescribed the eating up of the fat cattle; there were wondering and\ninquiring looks among the wise men and a constant chattering in Kemish.\nI waited patiently for some time, then waving my coin I demanded,--\n\n\"Can none of the grey-beards declare the meaning to me?\"\n\nThere were more consultations among themselves and with Zaphnath, and\npresently he said,--\n\n\"Before the wise men can declare thy dream, they demand to know whether\nthe lean kine only slaughtered the sleek ones, or if they ate them\nwholly up? And were they filled and satisfied when they had eaten their\nfatter sisters?\"\n\n\"In truth, I forgot to say that they devoured the fat kine wholly and\ncompletely, yet it could not be known that they had eaten anything, they\nwere still so lean and ill-favoured.\"\n\nThis caused even a greater chattering than before, and the youth finally\nasked,--\n\n\"Didst thou dream aught more, or is this all?\"\n\n\"Truly I had another dream, but it was different. I thought that all the\nwheat in the field grew upon one stalk in seven great kernels; then a\nshrivelled and withered stalk began to spring up; when suddenly a\nrapping on my door awakened me, and I dreamed no more.\"\n\nThe effect which this produced was most curious. Blank surprise, hidden\ncunning, anxious debating and uneasy hesitation, succeeded each other\namong the wise men. I watched it with great interest, and perceived the\ndoctor's satisfaction, but I again demanded the interpretation.\n\n\"Know, then, O dreamer,\" answered Zaphnath, \"that we understand not only\nthe import of all that thou hast dreamed, but even what thou wouldst\nhave dreamed hadst thou not been wakened! But, in spite of thy handsome\noffer, it doth not appear fit or proper to us that the interpretation of\nit should be made known to thee. Tell me, however, hast thou had\nconversation with any other person in Kem, save with me and with the\nwise men?\"\n\n\"Thou knowest well, O Zaphnath, that I speak not the Kemish tongue, and\ncan understand or communicate only through thy interpretation. I have\nspoken with no one on all of Ptah except through thee, and if thou wilt\nnot declare my dream I care not, for while ye have been debating among\nyourselves I have learned its meaning!\"\n\n\"Thou understandest it already!\" he exclaimed. \"Pray tell us, then, how\nthou hast learned it.\"\n\n\"The chief wise man hath declared it to me in my own tongue!\" I\nexclaimed, with a meaning look toward the doctor, who had been speaking\nto me to urge caution. \"He saith that the seven sleek kine are the\nKemish people, and the two lean and ill-favoured are we two from the\nEarth--for are not thy people larger and plumper than we!--and the seven\ndenoteth their much greater number. But the dream meaneth that we two,\npoor and hungry, might eat up all your people and become their masters.\"\n\nThere was still more delighted jabbering and excited comment. Then\nZaphnath arose, and turning graciously to the doctor said to him,--\n\n\"Thy marvellous interpretation, O chief grey-beard, is most correct and\nwise, and it hath wholly eaten ours up! We quite agree with thy superior\nwisdom, for thou only hast read the dream aright!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nGetting into the Corner\n\n\nThe doctor's new official position carried with it the use of a\nspacious, rambling dwelling, situated just inside the gate where we had\nmet Miss Blank. It was thus conveniently located for the doctor's duties\nat the observatories on the plateau. Another house would have been\nassigned to me, but I preferred to live with the doctor, and I desired\nto keep my eye on those enormous stone structures which our telescope\nhad quickly relegated to scientific uselessness.\n\nWe had established ourselves comfortably in this house, surrounded\nourselves with a modest retinue of servants, and were rapidly becoming\nacquainted with Kemish life and manners. The doctor learned the language\nlaboriously from the deposed wise man, who had no means of communicating\nwith him except in the tongue he was teaching. Thus it happened that the\ndoctor could teach me in a few hours in the evening what it had taken\nhim all day to learn. Naturally I picked up the most common phrases used\nin receiving and handling the grain, by hearing them frequently; but I\nsoon learned that I must pronounce them with exactly the same intonation\nand emphasis, or they were not understood. Knowing but one language\nthemselves, they had no facility in recognising mispronounced words, or\nin guessing at the meaning of incomplete phrases on which I stumbled.\n\nThe most difficult thing I encountered was their method of telling the\ntime. During the day it was reckoned rationally enough by the passage of\nthe Sun, which was never obscured by clouds and could always be seen.\nEvery house had a small hole in the roof, at a fixed distance from the\nfloor, and the daily track and varying shape of the spot of sunshine\nthus admitted gave names to the periods of the day. There seemed to be a\nsettled superstition that no house was fortunate unless this spot of\nsunshine entered by the door in the morning. For this reason the\nprincipal door in nearly every house was built in the west, so that the\nrising Sun would cast its spot first on the porch outside and then\ngradually creep in through the door, across the floor, and up the\nopposite wall late in the afternoon. Of course there were daylight\nperiods in the early morning and late afternoon when the Sun was too low\nto cast a spot, and these were known by terms which are best translated\n\"before the clock\" and \"after the clock.\"\n\nNo one dared to make a social call while the Sun was still outside the\ndoor, but friends were best welcome when the Sun was just entering it.\nMoreover, whoever slept until the Sun had entered the door was looked\nupon as an irredeemable sluggard. The track of the spot from the\ndoor-sill to the wall opposite was measured by linear distance from the\ncentre or noon-position of the spot. As in different houses the\napertures through which the clock-light was admitted were always the\nsame distance from the floor, such expressions as \"two feet before\nnoon,\" or \"a foot and a quarter after noon\" (which I translate from the\nKemish) always had a definite and exact meaning. The nearer the spot\ndrew to noon the more exactly circular it became and the more slowly it\nmoved. Therefore, very fine measurements were needed in the middle of\nthe day, and an inch near noon represented nearly as much time as a foot\nin the morning or evening.\n\nBut the daylight methods were simplicity itself compared with the night\nmethods, which were calculated on an entirely different system, based on\nthe combined movements of the two moons, neither of which agreed or\ncoincided with the movement of the Sun in any close degree. I urged upon\nthe doctor, as one of his earliest duties, the necessity of reforming\ntheir calendar and establishing a uniform method of denoting the time,\nto extend throughout the day and night. But on this point he failed to\nagree with me.\n\n\"What are our seconds, minutes, hours, and weeks after all?\" he queried.\n\"They are only arbitrary and meaningless divisions of time, which we\nhave found necessary because we have a very meagre heavenly clockwork;\nbut here they have a very elaborate one. Our day is a rational period\nbased on the Sun's revolution. Here they have seen fit to give up the\nSun-day to simplify matters and stick to a Moon-day. Their two contrary\nmoons furnish a rational, if rather intricate, method of telling the\ntime at night. They are best understood by imagining them to represent\nthe two hands of a clock. The smaller moon is what may be called a 'week\nhand,' completing its revolution in five and a half Sun-days; which they\nhave for convenience divided into six Moon-days of twenty-two hours\neach. The larger moon makes two complete revolutions in a day, just as\nthe hour hand of a clock does; and it really makes but little difference\nthat it travels around the dial in an opposite direction to that of the\n'week hand,' or that they both gain two hours a day on the Sun. These\nare mere details, that one gets used to in the end.\"\n\n\"Doctor, you argue like the old farmer I used to know, who stuck to the\nclock handed down by his grandfather, and maintained that no\nnew-fangled arrangement kept as good time. It was true that the\nstriking apparatus had long ago failed to agree with the hands; and the\nhands themselves, owing to the accumulated inaccuracies of years, no\nlonger denoted the real time; nevertheless, whenever it struck seven he\ncould always be sure that the hands were pointing to a quarter-past\ntwelve, and it was then just twenty-two minutes to three. This was\nsomething he could depend upon with a certainty which quite compensated\nfor the annoyance of incessant calculations and mental corrections.\"\n\n\"Pray leave joking aside and consider the wonderful nightly clockwork\nhere, which makes automatic time-keepers unnecessary. This accommodating\ninner moon, within the brief space of five hours, goes through the\nphases of a thin crescent, first quarter, and just as it approaches\nfulness it submits to a total eclipse, followed by a waning quarter,\nthen the reverse crescent of an old moon, and finally it sets where the\nSun must soon rise. It is a wonderful heavenly clock, which is never\nobscured by clouds, and turns its face toward every one alike.\"\n\n\"Yes, but one must remember that this hurrying moon gains two hours a\nday on the Sun, and therefore goes through her performance that much\nearlier each night. Besides, she is capable of rising twice in the same\nnight occasionally.\"\n\n\"Those are mere details that one learns to allow for. Moreover,\nconsider the convenience of being able to tell the day of the week by\nthe smaller moon. If it is just risen, we know we are on the eve of the\nfirst day of the week; if it is high or eclipsed, it must be the second\nday; and if it is sinking in the west, it is the third day----\"\n\n\"But for the last half of the week it is not seen at all, and one is\nfree to guess which day it is,\" I interrupted. \"Then no two days of the\nweek begin at the same hour. The first day begins with sunrise, the\nsecond two hours before sunrise, the third four hours before, and the\nfourth at midnight, and so on--two hours earlier each day till the week\nends, when they throw in a whole night for good measure and begin the\nnext week at sunrise again!\"\n\n\"Yes, that arrangement is made necessary because their Moon-day will not\nagree with their Sun-day in any other manner. But it is rather\nremarkable that the two moons agree with each other so well, the larger\none making twelve revolutions while the smaller makes one, so that at\nthe end of every week they both rise together, but on opposite sides of\nthe horizon, which is the signal for that night to be disregarded in the\ncount. The next week begins on the following morning, the first rising\nof the larger moon being disregarded, and her second rising being the\none reckoned from.\"\n\nWe were discussing this during our noon-day meal, and, when we had\nfinished, I walked with the doctor out to the plateau, where I was\nsupervising some important work on the Gnomons; for I had not been ten\ndays in Kem until I attempted to buy, with my gold coins, a large amount\nof wheat from the Pharaoh. Through the interference and objection of\nZaphnath, however, I failed utterly in getting any. But the gold had its\neffect just the same, and later the Pharaoh showed an evident\nwillingness to part with anything in his possession in order to get a\nliberal number of the smaller coins. But I put a very high value upon\nthe gold, comparing closely with the worth of diamonds upon Earth, and\nrefused to part with any, until one day the wisdom of buying the Gnomons\noccurred to me. I considered the project carefully, and finally made him\nan offer of a hundred half-eagles for them. Many of the small ones had\nbeen built to watch the course of the birth-stars of his various\nancestors, and these were now in a sense monuments to his dynasty. He\nreserved these and a small one, built to observe his own star of\nnativity, and finally sold me all the large important ones, upon the\ndoctor's representation that they were no longer needed for astronomical\npurposes. He specified only that they must not be torn down, but that I\nmight use them as I should see fit.\n\nAs I have said before, the Gnomons contained numerous large, long\nchambers, and it only became necessary to put a permanent bottom in\nthese to convert them into enormous warehouses. All the storage places\ninside the city were rapidly filling with grain, which poured in at\nevery gate on tens of thousands of mules. The plenteous crop, already\nripening, would have to be housed somewhere, and even if I did not\nsucceed in buying a large store of grain for myself, I knew how to make\na storehouse eat up a large portion of the value of the grain it housed.\nI had seen wheat, stored year after year, finally become the property of\nthe elevator owner, by virtue of his charges.\n\nI was not only putting a bottom to the storage chambers, but converting\nthe inclined slopes of the largest Gnomons into a passable mule-trail,\nby roughening and corrugating the surface to give the patient animals a\nsurer foot-hold, so they might climb to the top to discharge their\ncargoes. This was a simple form of elevator, and I laughed to think what\nsome of my former acquaintances would think of it! One of the smaller\nGnomons had already been completed to receive my share of the grain\nwhich I earned in the Pharaoh's service, and to this I was adding such\nmeagre purchases as I could make from the small farmers. These, however,\nwere not numerous, for the land was mostly in the hands of the Pharaoh\nand of a few large owners, more or less bound to him. I was therefore\nnot a little surprised now upon approaching to see a long line of mules\npicking their way up the inclined side of the finished Gnomon, and as\nthey reached the top their drivers emptied the pair of sacks they bore\ninto my storehouse. Including the drove of unladen animals at the bottom\nof the Gnomon, there must have been a hundred in all, and I was awaited\nby the chief driver, who rode one sleek mule covered with a soft blanket\nof feather texture, and had another similarly saddled by his side. After\na slow salute of each hand upon his cheek, he said to me,--\n\n\"My master, the glorious Hotep, sendeth to the keeper of the Pharaoh's\ngrain a present of two hundred bags of wheat, and wisheth to know if it\nbe true that thou desirest to buy a large store of grain with gold? For\nhath not Hotep the gathered harvests of two full years in his bins, and\nupon his fertile lands the largest crop in all Kem (save only that of\nthe Pharaoh) is nodding and awaiting the warm, ripening breath of the\nSnowless Month! Yet Hotep hath no use for iron money, for he is weighted\nand fettered with it already; but if thou desirest to bargain with him\nfor as much yellow gold as thou hast bartered to the Pharaoh, he will be\nmost pleased to treat with thee, and sendeth me with this ambling mule\nto fetch thee. Will it please thee to come with me now to his palace\nwithin the city?\"\n\n\"What do you think, Doctor? This Hotep must be almost a rival to the\nPharaoh, if he has stored so much grain and owns so many ripening\nfields. He must have seen the new gold ornaments upon the Pharaoh's\nwomen, which have rendered him envious. If, indeed, he has such a vast\nquantity of grain to sell, I will deck him out with gold, such as will\nturn the Pharaoh green with envy! I shall lose no time in seeing him;\"\nand so saying I mounted the mule, and assured the chief driver I would\nexpress my thanks in person to the great Hotep.\n\nHe conducted me to the opposite side of the city, and, as we crossed a\nheight near its centre, he pointed out to me the long fields of his\nmaster lining the left bank of the river. There were miles of waving\ngrain just beginning to turn from a luxuriant green to the lighter\nyellow tints of harvest. Presently we approached a large palace, which I\nhad often before seen from afar against the distant wall of the city,\nbut had never known. Upon entering, I observed every sign of the same\nidle luxury which marked the Pharaoh's dwelling, but none of that regal\ndisdain or imperial haughtiness which separated every one but his\nfavourite women from the immediate presence of the monarch.\n\nI was graciously received in a large, lighted chamber, where Hotep\nreclined lazily upon a billowy heap of downy cushions, surrounded by\nmany women. He only arose from his elbow to a sitting posture when I\nsaluted him. Without saying a word to him, I approached, and, loosening\nmy belt from about my waist, I unbuckled its mouth and poured out upon\na large cushion by his side my three hundred shining golden eagles. The\neffect was electrical, for they were twice the size and three times as\nmany as the coins I had given the Pharaoh. It must have seemed\nimpossible to him that I could possess larger coins, and more of them,\nthan he had seen upon the monarch's favourites. He was simply delighted\nwith the mere view, and his women crowded around or ran out in haste to\nbring in their absent sisters to behold a marvel of riches such as Kem\nhad never seen. But though they wondered and gloated over the sight,\nnone of them touched a coin until I spoke.\n\n\"I pray thee, most gracious Hotep, examine all these coins, and pass\nthem among thy women to see if they be pleased with them. Observe their\nregularity of form and beauty of design, and test the music they give\nforth when cast upon thy floor of stone. Mayhap, thou wouldst rather own\nall these than to be cumbered with so much grain.\"\n\nThereupon Hotep seized a heaping handful, which he poured jingling from\none palm to the other, and all the women delved their pretty fingers\ninto the shining heap and passed the coins to their admiring sisters,\nuntil not one was left upon the cushion.\n\n\"Thy Chief of Harvests hath made known to me, O Hotep, that thou still\nhast the full crops of two years. Wilt thou tell me how many bags of\ngrain grow upon thy fields at a single crop?\"\n\n\"Are not the number of my mules a thousand and one, and bear they not\ntwo bags each? To gather a single harvest, each faithful animal must\nmake five trips each day for the period of an hundred days.\"\n\nI had often estimated an average mule-load at five bushels, upon which\nbasis each crop would aggregate two and a half million bushels. This\nseemed impossible for a single farmer, but his fields wearied the sight\nto follow down the left bank of the Nasr-Nil.\n\n\"If thou wilt leave all this gold with me, I will deliver by my mules to\nthy storehouses upon the plateau all the grain of my past two crops with\nwhich my whole palace here is cumbered.\"\n\n\"I fear thou holdest thy grain too dearly, and that thou knowest not the\nvalue of this gold. What is more plenteous in Kem than wheat? There be\nmore bags of it than the stars in heaven. But this gold I bring is more\nthan all the store of it upon Ptah before I came. Pray give it back\nagain,\" I said, gathering up the few pieces which had been returned to\nthe cushion, and glancing about among the women as if searching for the\nrest. They returned them slowly, but Hotep still held his handful. After\na brief pause, I continued,--\n\n\"Hast thou not a fair crop growing which thou mightest also give me, so\nthat no other than Hotep shall receive any of these coins?\"\n\n\"In truth, I have never ridden as far as my waving fields stretch down\nthe Nasr-Nil; but one cannot sell what hath not fully ripened, for who\nknoweth what it may turn out to be?\"\n\n\"Then I must beg thee to return my coins,\" I answered slowly; but,\nunbuckling the other end of my belt, I poured out upon another cushion\nthe hundred magnificent double eagles which I was holding in reserve.\nThen, taking a particularly bright one of these, I continued,--\n\n\"But as thou hast been generous and thoughtful enough to send me a\npresent, O Hotep, I desire to return one to thee, such as no man in Kem\never possessed before. Will it please thee to accept this disc of gold\nas large as the lesser moon that creeps across the sky? And with it go\nmy wishes that Hotep's crops may always be great and plentiful.\"\n\nSlowly and unwillingly the women returned the eagles to the cushion,\nwhile they stared in wonder at the heap of larger coins. Hotep filtered\nthe handful through his fingers to the cushion, and accepted the double\neagle with gladness. With his eyes fixed on the second heap he seemed to\nbe thinking deeply and making calculations.\n\n\"The people are wont to call thee Iron Man, but I believe thou art\ngolden!\" he ruminated, and then suddenly, \"For these heaps of riches,\nlarge and small, what desirest thou of all my possessions? Wilt thou\nhave all my grain and half my land? Shall I give to thee all my fields\nwhich cannot be seen from the palace here?\"\n\n\"Why should I wish thy land when I have no cattle to till it, nor mules\nto gather the harvest? In lieu of the land, give me only a share of what\nit should produce for a few years. Now give heed to the bargain I will\nmake with thee. If thou wilt deliver to my storehouses, upon the\nplateau, all the gathered grain of thy past two crops, and all the grain\nthou shalt gather from this growing crop (save only what thou needest\nfor seed), and half of each of the crops of the three succeeding\nyears,--provided, however, that you assure me each year as much as thy\nthousand mules can carry in an hundred journeys;--then thou mayest keep\nall this store of gold, which is, indeed, all that both of us from the\nBlue Star possess.\"\n\nHe seemed to be revolving these terms slowly in his mind to be sure of\nthem, and then called out to his servants,--\n\n\"Bring in spiced wine, and bid my Chief of Harvests enter! He shall be\nwitness that Hotep agrees to this compact, and, should I die before it\nis fulfilled, he shall see that it is carried out to the last year. But\nwilt thou leave all this gold with me now, or must I wait until the\nharvests are delivered?\"\n\n\"What Hotep promiseth me I believe, as certainly as if it were done\nalready. I will leave the gold with thee, knowing thou wilt perform the\ncontract in every item; but if thou failest in any year, thou shalt\nreturn to me one small gold-piece for each trip that thy thousand mules\nfall short of an hundred.\"\n\nHe agreed, and arose and recited the terms of the compact to his Chief\nof Harvests, charging him to carry it out, and to cause to be engraved a\nsmall stone cylinder as a permanent record of its provisions, as it was\ntheir custom to do in such cases. Then filling three goblets with rich\nspiced wine, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"For thy sake, O most generous youth, may the Nasr-Nil fondly nurse\nevery harvest, and may the gentle Snowless Month ripen them in such\nabundance as they have never shown before! And may Hotep's mules grow\nold and weary bearing the plenty to thy storehouses!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHumanity on Ptah\n\n\nThe magnificent abundance of the seventh great harvest, which ripened\nlate in the year of our arrival, attracted a multitude of both men and\nanimals from all the out-lying countries into Kem to assist in gathering\nit, and many of them remained to spend their gains in the luxuries of\nthe great city. It was an unparalleled period of prosperity and plenty;\nand though the rich wasted everything with a careless hand, the poor\nwere better provided for than they had ever been.\n\nLike an endless caravan Hotep's mules trailed across the city day by\nday, and emptied their cargoes into the bottomless pits of the Gnomons.\nAnd Hotep's thousand cattle tramped his threshing-floors during the long\nwinter, and until the later nightly snows signalled the coming of a\ntardy spring; and yet the patient mules streamed through the city, and\nwore deeper paths into the sides of the Gnomons, until one by one the\ngreat chambers were filled and sealed.\n\nLate in the spring the toiling cattle left the threshing-floors, and\ntraversed the fields in long procession, two and two, lashed together by\na bar across the horns instead of a yoke, and dragging heavy stone\nploughs slowly after them to prepare the soil for a new planting. But\nwhile the whole left bank of the Nasr-Nil swarmed with Hotep's patient\nteams and their busy drivers, the right bank was deserted, idle, and\nlifeless. Every one wondered why the Pharaoh's planting was being\ndelayed; no one knew why the Pharaoh's men and cattle were idle; and the\nold men shook their heads and muttered that the river would overflow its\nbanks long before the Pharaoh's seed was in. After a while Zaphnath sent\nfor me, and when I came before him he said,--\n\n\"The Pharaoh is sick with the plenty of the land, weary of the sight of\ngrain-laden mules and ploughing cattle, and so cumbered about with\nmountains of wheat that he desireth not to plant his fields. Thou art\nnot one to see his lands lie idle. If thou hast aught with which to\ntempt him, I can persuade him to let unto thee all his land and to hire\nunto thee all his men and mules and cattle. For hath he not acquired all\nhis riches in seven years' harvests? and in another seven thou mayest be\nas rich as he.\"\n\n\"Mayhap, O Zaphnath, the coming seven years may not be as plenteous as\nthe last seven have been; but, in any case, I have no more gold with\nwhich to tempt the Pharaoh, having parted with all of it in a bad\nbargain with Hotep, whom thou knowest, for half of his coming crops.\"\n\nThereupon he bade me remain, and sent for Hotep, and said to him,--\n\n\"Behold, have not the harvests of seven years made Pharaoh the richest\nman upon Ptah, so that he covets no more grain, but only things of rare\nbeauty? And are not thy harvests reduced by half through thy compact\nwith him from the Blue Star? Now, if thou likest to tempt the Pharaoh\nwith an hundred of thy golden coins, and one-and-twenty of the\nmoon-sized discs of gold such as thou wearest there, thou mayest hire\nhis land for the next seven years, and all his men and animals for a\nlike time, if thou wilt feed and nourish them; and then shall not both\nbanks of the great river bring forth riches, and be burdened with the\nplenteous harvests of Hotep?\"\n\n\"Is the Pharaoh indeed weary of rich harvests, or doth he rather itch\nfor my gold? Yet, had I the seed to plant all his fields, I might\nconsider the undertaking thou shewest me.\"\n\n\"Let not that delay thee,\" answered Zaphnath, \"for I am sure he will\ngladly lend to such a man as Hotep the seed thou needest until thy next\nharvest be gathered.\"\n\nSo the matter was thus finally concluded, and I was a witness to the\ncompact.\n\nThen Hotep's Chief of Harvests worked early and late to finish planting\nbefore the Month of Midnight Snows, when the Nasr-Nil usually overflows\nits banks and waters the harvest. But, as if to oblige a man so\nindustrious in preparing the way for it, the great river did not rise at\nits customary time, and Hotep was able to finish his seeding on both\nbanks.\n\nThe black loam along the shores parched and crumbled, and borrowed the\nlook of the great desert; the feathers of darkness fell later and later,\nuntil they began to appear with the dawn, and yet the river failed to\nrise; the priests went through their perfunctory rites to placate the\ngod of the Overflow, and made their impotent sacrifices to tempt him to\nbless the harvest; but Hotep saw the Snowless Month, which should have\nripened his grain, dawn upon fields that were dried to seas of drifting\ndust and void of all vegetation. His army of men, augmented by the\nPharaoh's thousands, and his ten thousand cattle and mules, all ate and\nwaited and waited and ate, and yet there was no work for them. The\nfollowing spring there was no need to plough the fields, and no seed to\nplant them.\n\nWhen Zaphnath learned that Hotep must deliver a hundred thousand\nmule-cargoes of wheat to me, or forfeit a hundred gold pieces, he sent\nfor him, and sold to him for the hundred pieces enough of the Pharaoh's\ngrain already on the plateau to pay me, and lent him the seed to plant\nall the land again. But aside from this, the Pharaoh sold not a bag of\nwheat, and during the first year all the small stores of grain\nthroughout Kem were consumed, and the price rose to three times its\nformer value. Therefore, Hotep consoled himself with the thought that he\ncould make more out of one crop after a failure than he could have made\nout of two crops without it, and he happily sowed his fields anew.\n\nBefore the river was due to rise the second time, the poor began to\nsuffer from the famine. There was no employment for the thousands who\nhad been attracted to Kem to gather the previous large harvests. Only\nthose fortunate enough to be slaves enjoyed an assured living, and this\nentire class was now dependent upon Hotep, for Pharaoh supported only\nhis women and his personal servants. Many people desired to deliver\nthemselves into slavery, but Pharaoh would not accept any, and Hotep\nalready had more than he could feed. During the Month of Midnight Snows\nthe entire population of the city watched the river with apprehension,\nnoting its slightest fluctuation. But day after day the people saw no\nchange, and idleness fostered grumbling and discontent among them.\nZaphnath and the Pharaoh were privately criticised because they did not\nattend or contribute to the sacrifices made to the god of Overflow;\nbecause they hoarded so much grain, and did nothing to alleviate the\ndistress of the people. And there were many who attributed the unusual\naction of the river to the presence upon Ptah of two strangers from the\nBlue Star.\n\nWhen two fruitless months had passed without any rising of the waters,\nHotep lost courage, and was obliged to proclaim that all his men and\nbeasts must exist upon half-rations. It was then that public suffering\nbecame general. About this time I consulted with the doctor whether to\npress Hotep for the second delivery of a hundred thousand cargoes of\nwheat.\n\n\"Certainly; demand it from him,\" he answered, greatly to my surprise,\n\"especially so long as it amounts to squeezing the wheat out of the\nPharaoh. It is certain he will furnish the wheat in exchange for Hotep's\ngold, and a few coins are really nothing to him or to you either. As\nlong as the Pharaoh covets them, make him pay well for them.\"\n\n\"But I expected you would advise leniency, as you have never sympathized\nwith my wheat speculation in the least,\" I replied.\n\n\"I do not share your idle dream of riches, but nevertheless I want to\nget as much wheat into our hands as possible, especially if it comes\nfrom the Pharaoh. You do not seem to appreciate the real reason, but\nblindly chase after the bauble of fortune. It was the same when I first\nsaw you in Chicago, and now you are just as impulsive and thoughtless. I\nhave no doubt but you have already computed a hundred times how rich\nyou are in Earthly terms and figures.\"\n\n\"The time for a big value has not quite come yet, but I confess I have\nestimated that it will run into many millions of dollars.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! What is the use of such childish nonsense? Even if we had our\nprojectile to return with, you could never take any of your riches back\nto Earth with you!\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I demanded in astonishment.\n\n\"What is your fortune? It now exists in grain at an inflated famine\nvalue. You couldn't transport the grain back to Earth, and if you could,\nit would shrink in value and fail to pay the freight. What can you\nexchange it for here? For lands, for women, for slaves, none of which\nhave any commercial value on Earth.\"\n\n\"But I can sell it for money!\" I put in.\n\n\"Yes, for iron money worth a few dollars a ton on Earth! Why, not even\nyour entire fortune will buy enough iron to build a new projectile to\nenable us to return. You parted with the only valuable and portable form\nof property when you exchanged your gold. Now that is rapidly going into\nthe Pharaoh's hands, to remain there, and you can never return to Earth\nas rich as you left it, though you be worth all the money and property\nin the land of Kem!\"\n\n\"Well, it does look a little as if I had been scheming for riches here,\nwithout knowing just why I want them.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have formed that habit on Earth. Only they carry it further\nthere--swindle their brothers, deceive their parents, oppress the weak,\nextort from the poor; work, toil, plot, cheat, rob, yes, even _kill!_ in\norder to lay up a store of something they can never take away with them,\nand which renders them unhappy oftener than happy while they remain to\nguard it.\"\n\n\"I have heard that sort of talk often before, Doctor, but I never saw\nthe truth of it quite so plainly as now. I have outwitted and squeezed\nHotep, the man on whom the whole city now depends for existence.\"\n\n\"They think they depend upon him, but you know as well as I do that he\nwill be powerless; that he must see them starve by thousands, and part\nwith the last bit of his cherished riches to save his own life. No,\nIsidor, your business sagacity has not been in vain, for this entire\npeople depend not on Hotep, but on _you_! You alone have the food to\npreserve many of them alive through a famine and a pestilence whose\nhorrors are just beginning. Pharaoh and Zaphnath will squeeze and pinch\nthem, and see them die, and turn it all to their own profit; but let us\nconstitute ourselves a relief committee, you and I. Let us set these\nKemish rulers an example of humanity, as we know it on Earth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nRevolutionist and Eavesdropper\n\n\nIn Kem, where agriculture was almost the only occupation, and where the\nox was helpful both in planting and threshing the grain, it was quite\nnatural that he should be revered, or at least respected as a partner in\nthe toil, and that a strong prejudice should prevail against his being\nslaughtered for food. In fact, it was not the practice of the Kemish to\neat any large animals, but they confined themselves to fish and small\nfowl for meats. Nevertheless, I urged upon Hotep the necessity of\nkilling some of his cattle to provide food for his miserable and\npoorly-fed labourers. But he stubbornly refused to do so, saying his men\nwould rather eat the flesh of mules than of cattle.\n\nWithout being pressed for it, he paid me the second hundred thousand\ncargoes of wheat, which he bought from the Pharaoh with gold, as he had\ndone before. But I divided this entire quantity of grain among Hotep's\nlabourers, which eked out their half-rations for almost a year. I\nstipulated that none of this grain should be used for seed, for I\nfirmly believed it would be wasted. But Pharaoh again lent the seed for\nplanting a third crop, insisting that the discouraged Hotep should put\nit in the ground, and reminding him that the only way he could get grain\nto pay his heavy debts was to raise a crop.\n\nThenocris had not been long in learning the location of our house near\nher favourite gate, and it was her habit to call on us every day at the\ntime of the noon-day meal. She always carried and caressed her white\nrabbit, and they came to us like two dumb animals to be fed. Her tall,\nstately figure, traversing the city on her daily journey to our house,\nsoon became a familiar sight; and when the people began to be oppressed\nby hunger, they gradually overcame their early fear of us, and followed\nher to our door for food. We had never turned any away, for beggary was\nrare enough in Kem, and no sane person ever resorted to it except in the\nsorest extremes of need.\n\nZaphnath doubtless looked with an evil eye upon the crowds that daily\nthronged our door to secure food. The Pharaoh rarely left his palace,\nand bothered little about affairs outside, and Zaphnath must have been\nat the bottom of an edict which was shortly issued. Nothing that I\nremember in Kem better illustrated the absolute power of the Pharaoh and\nthe unrestrained enforcement of his merest whim. The edict referred to\nthe scarcity of bread and the multitude of foreigners who were flocking\nto the city to secure it, and provided (ostensibly for the good of the\nKemish people) that no man in the city of Kem should give bread or any\nsort of food to any but the members of his own household. Moreover, no\nman should sell grain or bread at a less price than that established by\nthe Pharaoh for the sale of his own.\n\nThe doctor and I realized that this was aimed at no one but us. They\nwere jealous of our charity, and wished to turn everybody's need to\ntheir own profit. We scoffed at the tyranny of such an edict, but it was\nthe arbitrary sort of law to which the Kemish were accustomed. Yet if we\ngave up our undertaking, and the unfortunate multitude went unfed for a\nfew days, bread riots were certain to break out, and they might result\nin the death or overthrow of the short-sighted Pharaoh, and the seizure\nof his grain. Even this would not settle the question, for the victors\nmight enforce a worse monopoly of it, if that were possible.\n\n\"We must continue to feed them all outside the city,--at the Gnomons,\nfor instance,\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes, we must feed them there in a large chamber, and eat with them, so\nthat they may be considered members of our household,\" added the doctor.\n\nThus it happened that the paths which Hotep's mules had worn so deeply\nwere now thronged by a great multitude of the city's poor in their\ndaily pilgrimage to the Gnomons. In an enormous chamber which we fitted\nup for that purpose, we served to each comer one generous meal, and\nthere were so many who came that this meal was going on almost all day\nlong. The Pharaoh fed no one but his favourites and his soldiers, and of\nthese last he discharged a large number, reducing his army to a hungry,\nill-fed thousand men. Those who were discharged came to eat with us, and\nmany of those retained would gladly have done so, had we not excluded\nevery one in the Pharaoh's service.\n\nMeantime the Nasr-Nil ran lower in her banks than ever before, and gave\nno signs of rising; the nightly snows were brief and evanescent, and the\nrains, which had never been copious on Ptah, now ceased entirely. Every\ngreen thing gradually vanished from Kem, and Hotep's third crop rotted\nor lay sodden in the ground as the others had done. He knew that I had\nbeen offered the opportunity to plant the Pharaoh's fields, and that I\nhad not only refused, but had hoarded grain. This may have led him to\nconclude that I knew some reason for the famine, and I was not surprised\nwhen he sought me one day at the Gnomons. He begged a strictly private\ninterview with me, and I conducted him to a small room I had constructed\nby running two thin walls of porous stone from one Gnomon to another,\nand covering the enclosure with a flat roof.\n\n\"Dost thou know that thou hast linked together with thy slender walls\nthe monuments of two antagonistic dynasties?\" he began. \"This structure\nto the left was built by the fifth ancestor of the present Pharaoh, in\ntruth the first ruler of his dynasty. The structure to the right,\nhowever, is vastly older, and was built by the tenth Pharaoh of the\ndynasty, from which I am directly descended. My ancestors were\nvanquished by dint of wars, and their powers usurped by the ancestors of\nthis same selfish Pharaoh, who hath not so good a right to rule as I.\"\n\nI think I was born without a vestige of revolutionary spirit, for I have\nalways felt a respect for the institutions that are, and an allegiance\nto the powers that rule. I remember the distinct shock which this\nutterance of Hotep's gave me. I said nothing, but he answered the\nsurprised look on my face.\n\n\"Thou knowest well that the entire labouring population of Kem is fed by\nme in my fields on one side of the city; while all the poor and\nunfortunate are fed by you here on the other side. What man of Kem\nthinks of the grand palace of the Pharaoh in the midst of the city, but\nto curse it? What subject who knows how the Pharaoh and his favourites\ngorge themselves in luxurious plenty, while he nurses his hunger, but\nwould a thousand times rather pay allegiance to those who save him from\nabsolute starvation? And Zaphnath, in his nightly wanderings and his\ndaily errands of espionage, thinkest thou he overhears a public grumbler\nwho fails to curse him and his Pharaoh, and to extol the men from the\nBlue Star, and the unfortunate farmer, who, until now, has been able to\ngive the people work and sustenance?\"\n\n\"Doth Zaphnath spend his time in watching and spying, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Aye, that he doth! I crossed his path even now, coming through the\ncity, and he set at following me, but by quick turns I eluded him. He it\nis who by his loans and compacts hath snared and tricked me until now I\nam utterly ruined, unless I can claim my rightful turn at ruling. Alone\nI cannot do it; with thy help I can.\"\n\n\"How, then, could I be of assistance to you?\" I exclaimed in some\nastonishment, without stopping to think of the justice of his claims.\n\n\"From what I have heard of the thunder thou commandest, and the\nlightning thou art able to carry, it doth appear that thou couldst\novercome the Pharaoh and his thousand half-starved men, who secretly\nitch to change masters. Thou hast the means to do it; I have the right\nto do it; and the people would unanimously applaud the doing of it. Let\nus strike together, then; let us seize the Pharaoh's grain and apportion\nit among our supporters and the needy, and when I am established as\nPharaoh, thou shalt be my ruler in the place of Zaphnath.\"\n\n\"Thou temptest me but little, O Hotep. Once before I was offered a\nrulership in Kem which I refused. Besides, am I not bound by an\nagreement to loyalty and obedience to this Pharaoh?\"\n\n\"Aye! Even as I am bound to come to a sure ruin; and as every man in Kem\nis bound to sit meekly by and starve. But is a ruler no way bound? May\nhe claim the life of his subjects for his profit? How long will they\nsuffer such treatment? And if we are restrained by loyalty, how long\nwill it be till some one else strikes the blow we stick at----?\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a vigorous knocking at the door, as of one who\ncommands rather than entreats an opening. Who could it be? I turned to\nsee, but Hotep caught me by the arm.\n\n\"Before thou openest, tell me if thou wilt join me in this undertaking\nfor the sake of a suffering people?\"\n\n\"Nay, Hotep; it is wrong, and I will not do it. I am bound to this\nPharaoh, bad as he is, and to thy dynasty I owe nothing.\" The rapping\nbegan again and more loudly now, but Hotep still restrained me.\n\n\"For half of all my fields wilt thou furnish me the grain to pay the\nPharaoh, and thus avert my ruin?\"\n\n\"And if I would, how wouldst thou feed the men and mules and cattle\nthrough another year of famine, and another, and another?\"\n\n\"Thou thinkest the crops will fail yet three more years!\" he exclaimed,\nhalf stupefied by the thought.\n\n\"Aye, four! I know it for most certain,\" I answered, and the insistent\nknocking was vigorously renewed.\n\n\"Then I am too deep in the mire for thee or any one to pull me out. Open\nto this importunate knocker.\"\n\nI threw open the door, and there stood the keen-eyed, angry-visaged\nZaphnath! How long had he been listening outside there? How much had he\nstealthily overheard before he began knocking? All the Kemish had need\nto speak doubly loud to us from Earth, for our ears were not made for\nthin air and its weak sounds. Moreover, Hotep had spoken throughout with\na fervent declamation. But what I said in my ordinary tones was always\neasily understood by Hotep's keen ears. Therefore it seemed quite\ncertain that Zaphnath had heard through the thin wall all that Hotep had\nsaid, and probably none of what I said. So much the worse. He had\ndoubtless supplied my speeches to suit himself, and made them fit into\nHotep's plotting. At any rate there was hot anger in his face when he\nspoke to me,--\n\n\"Thou servest the Pharaoh well, by contriving how to cross his wishes at\nevery point! It were well thy office were withdrawn; I have brothers\nabout me now who could better fill it.\"\n\n\"Whenever it pleaseth the Pharaoh or his all-potent ruler to abrogate\nhis compact with me, I am quite ready to begin where we left off when it\nwas made,\" I retorted. I did not think till afterwards that this might\nserve wrongly to indicate to him the tenor of my answers to Hotep's\nscheming. His eyes flashed angrily at this, yet he made no reply, but\nspoke to Hotep instead.\n\n\"Before the end of the clock this day, the Pharaoh requireth of thee\nfull settlement of all thou owest him. Attempt nothing but a just and\nfull repayment, O most precious Hotep, for thy every act is watched and\nknown to us!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Doctor Disappears\n\n\nHotep saw that he was ruined, and he went to fall down before Pharaoh\nand beg for mercy. The monarch, not having the courage of his own\nhard-heartedness, answered him,--\n\n\"I desire not to deal harshly with thee, O Hotep; for thou hast\nstruggled desperately against an unwilling soil and unpropitious\nseasons. But thou knowest all my affairs are in the hands of Zaphnath,\nwithout whom I do nothing. Therefore go thou before him and do even as\nhe telleth thee.\"\n\nAnd Hotep, having made an invoice of all his money, and slaves, and\nmules, and cattle, took it before Zaphnath, saying,--\n\n\"Behold, O most merciful ruler of Kem, I have threescore-and-ten of the\ngreat golden discs, and seven hundredweight of the coins of Kem\nwherewith to repay the Pharaoh for the seed which the seasons have\nstolen from me. But I have neither food for all the men, and mules, and\ncattle which are the Pharaoh's, nor yet for mine own; wherefore I beg\nof thee to take back his slaves and animals, and release me from feeding\nthem; and I will forfeit unto the Pharaoh all my working slaves, which\nare thirty score, and all my mules, which are a thousand and one, and\nall my cattle, which are an hundred score, and they shall be his for\never.\"\n\n\"Methinks thou borrowest with a large hand and repayest like a very\nmiser,\" answered Zaphnath. \"All the money thou namest will not buy a\nthousand cargoes of grain, for behold, is not wheat worth iron money,\nweight for weight? And to reimburse the Pharaoh for feeding all his men\nand animals through the famine, which may continue, it is a rare\nkindness in thee to desire to give him also all of thine to be fed and\nnourished! What wilt thou do with all thy land when thou hast no men or\nbeasts to till it? And how wilt thou maintain thy proud palace, with\nthree hundred women, when thou hast no revenues left?\"\n\n\"'Tis true, O Zaphnath; and if the Pharaoh covet them, take them\nall--the palace, the women, the rich clothing and rare jewels, and even\nthe endless fields which have cursed me! For the days of Hotep's riches\nare ended. Let him be acquit, and go from thee in peace!\"\n\n\"Even with them all, thou knowest he is but poorly paid; yet it is I who\nhave prevailed upon him not to be harsh with thee. But if the famine\ncontinue, what thinkest thou of doing to gain a living?\"\n\n\"By my beard! Doth the Pharaoh wish to make a slave of me also?\"\n\n\"Nay, Hotep; not a common slave. But hast thou a mind to starve? I have\nbesought him to give thee an honourable and luxuriant service, befitting\nthy tastes and habits. He will make thee chamberlain of his palace.\"\n\n\"Is there no other thing thou canst think of or invent, O most merciful\nZaphnath? Lands, slaves, animals, money, women, jewels, palace, and even\nmy life and body for the gracious Pharaoh's service! Is that all? If so,\nI beg thee declare the bargain made and all my undertakings fully\nacquit.\"\n\nHotep came to me the following day, with his beard shaven and the\nPharaoh's bird-wing on his brow. He wore the dress of the Pharaoh's\nchamberlain, and he told me how it had all happened. He also told me\nthat the Pharaoh had now thrown wide open the doors of slavery, and\noffered to feed all who surrendered themselves to his service for life.\nAnd Zaphnath never ceased to itch for all the lands, and cattle, and\nslaves of every one in Kem and her tributary countries, either in\nexchange for the bare needs of life, or as pledges for seed which he\nknew would only rot and ruin the borrower.\n\nI went about my affairs on the plateau that day, wondering how long I\nshould continue there, or whether my threat had been effective in\nsilencing the enmity of the rulers. When I returned that evening, I did\nnot find the doctor at the house. My servant said that a messenger from\nthe chamberlain had summoned him on important business, soon after the\nnoon-day meal. I waited a little longer, and then I began to fear that\nthe chamberlain had been used to decoy the doctor into some trap. If he\nwas staying away of his own account, why did he not send me some word?\nMessengers were plenty. At last I sent the servant to the palace to\ninquire and search for him. After a long stay he returned, saying the\ndoctor was nowhere to be found. No one had seen or heard of him there\nthat day.\n\n\"And the chamberlain?\" I demanded.\n\n\"He was not to be found in his rooms, and no one had seen him since\nnoon-day.\"\n\n\"Didst thou make inquiry for the messenger who summoned the doctor?\" I\nasked.\n\nHe had not thought of it; so I started to the palace myself. I had gone\nbut a few steps when it occurred to me to act with a little more\ncaution, and be prepared for some plot against myself. I turned back to\nthe house, and had the servant remove the heap of pillows where I slept.\nUnderneath was a loosened stone of the floor, and below it we kept the\nrifles, revolvers, and ammunition hidden. I carefully loaded all of\nthem, and put all the remaining cartridges into our two old belts. I\nthought of strapping one of these about me, but reflected that this\nwould have a hostile and treasonable appearance, so I contented myself\nwith concealing one revolver in my coat, and then I carefully covered up\nall the rest, and had the servant pile the pillows over the stone slab\nagain.\n\nThen I went out and walked to the palace. Leaping the wall, I questioned\nevery one I saw about the doctor, the chamberlain, and his messenger. No\none had seen anything of them. The messenger was absent from his\nlodging, as well as the chamberlain. Either they were all gone somewhere\nsecretly together, or they had all suffered a common mysterious fate.\nUnable to do anything more, I returned home full of apprehension.\n\nI slept fitfully a few hours, and then I had a most realistic dream,\nwhich began among my old surroundings on Earth: the wheat pit, the\nclosing of a turbulent session, the drive through the parks till I came\nsuddenly in sight of the great spherical cactus design of the World in\nWashington Park. As I approached this, it seemed to leave its pedestal\nand move freely through space toward me. I seized one of its meridians,\nand, clinging tightly, was carried off over the park, over the lake,\nover seas of ice, through an ocean of sparkling light, faster and\nfarther every moment, until presently my little globe refused to hold me\nlonger, and repelled me through a long, giddy, awful fall which filled\nme with terror. But I landed in the dark chamber of a Gnomon, waist-deep\nin loose wheat. It seemed gradually to grow deeper about me, rose to my\nshoulders, to my chin; and as I looked up I saw Slater pouring in wheat\nin a steady stream. He meant to smother and choke me with it. Ah, if I\nonly had a thousand, aye, ten thousand mouths to eat it, he could never\ndo it. I could keep even with him. But it gradually rose past my mouth,\npast my nose; it covered my head and was smothering me. What an awful\nthing was too much food, after all! And then I wakened to find my head\ncovered with pillows until I was half-choked for breath.\n\nIt was all so vivid I could not rid my mind of it. It seemed really to\nhave happened but a moment ago. My mind was palpitating afresh with\nthose Earthly scenes which had for years been fading out of it. What\ncould it all mean? Then I thought of the doctor. Perhaps they were\nsmothering him in one of the Gnomons. It seemed hardly probable, but the\nidea took a strange hold on me. The chambers were all full and sealed,\nbut one; it had been opened, and wheat was daily being used out of it;\nnone was at hand to be poured in. It was foolish to do so, but I could\nnot rest until I had gone to the Gnomons to see. Of course I would find\nnothing there, but I should not be content till I had tried. At least,\nthe night air and the gently falling feathers of darkness would restore\nmy calmness again.\n\nI had the precaution to take my revolver again, and after a very short\nwalk I stood face to face with the great stone gate, barred and locked\nto confine all others within the city. The fact that it was fastened on\nthe inside proved that the doctor's captors were not outside, or, at\nleast, did not expect to return till after daylight. With a brisk jump I\ncleared the wall easily, and walked rapidly to the plateau. There was no\nsign of life there. I mounted the only unsealed Gnomon and shouted down\ninto its cavernous depths. Of course there was no answer. I was now so\nwide awake it seemed to me quite silly to follow the promptings of a\ndream, so I began to return in a leisurely walk.\n\nThe night scene all about me, how different it was from those to which I\nhad been accustomed on Earth! Out of a pink sky flakes of frozen dew\nwere gently falling, starching the arid, verdureless soil with a\nglistening coat of evanescent white. Along the river bank, tall,\nslender, lightly-rooted trees reached far up into the breathless air,\nbut there was never the movement of a bough or the rustle of a leaf,\nexcept from the flutter of birds. Jungles of spindling reeds also\ntowered from waste marshes, in testimony to the easy struggle which\nvegetable sap had been able to accomplish over a weak gravity.\nEverything was eloquent with the reminder that I was on a different\nworld; but yet, when I looked up at the starry heavens, they were the\nsame. All the familiar constellations, changing their positions through\nthe night with the same stately dignity, were there. The Pleiades,\nOrion, the Great Bear, with his nose constantly pointed at the Pole\nStar, made me feel that, at least in the heavens, I was at home! Only\nthe colour of the night, the two little moons, and the planets looked\ndifferent. Great Jupiter, king of the Martian night, whose brilliancy,\nif not his size, outrivalled the pale moons; Saturn, with his tilted\nring, was visible to the naked eye; and yon pearly blue star, just\nrising to announce the morning, was Earth. Earth, which I had so\nunwillingly left, would I ever see her again as anything but a\nSun-attending star? Would I ever walk her familiar paths, and know my\nbrother creatures there again?\n\nWith this thought came over me an unspeakable sense of loneliness, a\ndepressing home-sickness, an aching yearning for that life, tempestuous\nas it had been. And how I despised the monotony and lowness of the\nMartian life; how I loathed the spreading misery of the famine, and the\nvile and dreadful pestilences which it was begetting! How could I ever\nendure the four more slow years of it which I confidently expected to\nensue? What would I not give to leave it all and return!\n\nI had retraced my steps, leapt the wall again, and as I approached our\nhouse was surprised to see, in the dim light of the coming morning, a\nfigure standing guard at the doorway. He was a soldier, and on closer\napproach I saw that he wore a beard, which showed him to be a captain.\nBut what surprised me far more was that he held awkwardly in his arms\none of our loaded rifles. Here was certain treachery. Since he stood\nguard, he doubtless had soldiers within; and if they had found one\nfirearm they must have found the others also. But how had they succeeded\nin finding them? A mere search never would have revealed their secret\nplace. Some one who knew of their location must have disclosed it. Could\nit have been the doctor? Had they brought him back, and forced him to\nproduce the arms?\n\nIn that case, now was my chance to liberate him. Fortunately they did\nnot know how to use the arms they had captured, and I had one revolver\nwith five good loads in it. With five telling shots I ought to be able\nto create panic enough to enable the doctor to get possession of another\ngun and help me rout them.\n\nAll this flashed through my mind in a twinkling, and just as I drew out\nmy revolver the captain caught sight of me. He quickly shifted the rifle\nin his hands and tugged at the hammer. He knew nothing of the necessity\nof taking aim, or of the use of the trigger. It would only be by the\nmerest chance if he hit me. I had half drawn the trigger, and was just\ncorrecting my aim, when a long flash of flame from the rifle startled\nme, and unconsciously I fired wild. By lifting the hammer of the rifle\nand letting it snap back, the captain had exploded one cartridge at\nrandom. But my careful aiming had now taught him a trick; I saw him\nattempting the same arm's-length aim with the rifle. He did it awkwardly\nenough, and pulled up the hammer with the other hand. It fell with a\nsnap on the discharged cartridge. He could be relied on never to learn\nthe trick of ejecting them and reloading with the sixteen that lay ready\nup the length of the barrel. Therefore, instead of firing again, I\nrushed at him to capture the rifle. But he was too quick for me, for\nthrusting it inside the house with a quick command, the other was handed\nout to him. I was now at such extremely close range that his awkward aim\ncovered me; but I was quicker on the trigger than he was on the hammer,\nand with a cry the first Martian to suffer by gunpowder fell to the\nground. I sprang for his rifle just as some one from inside snatched it\naway and pointed it at me again. Whoever had it, stood half behind the\ndoor and out of range. But I aimed at his fingers on the rifle barrel,\nand by a lucky chance I hit them, for the rifle dropped and the body\nstaggered into full view. Another quick shot sent this fellow to the\nground, but as I reached for his rifle, it was snatched away again.\n\nNow I saw the absolute necessity of possessing myself of another\nfirearm, for I had but one load left in the revolver. I felt little fear\nof their awkward aim, therefore I made bold to rush inside on the chance\nof seizing the first gun I could lay my hands on. At the same time I\nwould be able to see the position of the doctor. He must be gagged, for\nhe had made no answer to my frequent cries to him in English. Once\ninside, I saw that the room was full of soldiers--twenty at least. They\nhad a prisoner, true enough, but not the doctor. It was my servant, whom\nthey had forced to disclose the location of the arms.\n\nThe soldiers quickly blocked the door and began closing in on me. One\nseized me by each arm, but with a quick shake I threw them off. Then a\nthird fellow clutched my left arm so tightly I could not loosen him. Had\nI taken my eyes or my revolver off the crowd in front, they would have\nbeen upon me in a body; yet with my left arm I was able slowly to turn\nthe clinging soldier around in front of me and to bring him gradually\nwithin close range of my revolver. When he saw its gleaming muzzle, he\nbroke from me and fled to the others.\n\nLittle did they know that I could not afford to sacrifice my remaining\nload to kill a single man. I must use it to capture the other revolver,\nfor rifles were of no use at such short range. I man[oe]uvred cautiously\nto keep most of the soldiers in front of me, and stealthily backed\ntoward the door, where a soldier stood guard with the other weapon. I\nwas reckoning on the cowardice of most of those in front of me, but I\nhad failed to count on the men I had shot. As I now backed quickly\ntowards the door, I suddenly felt the arms of the fallen man about my\nlegs, and I stumbled backwards over him. In a twinkling the whole crowd\nwas upon me, my revolver was seized, my arms were pinned to the ground,\nand the dying soldier clutched my legs in his last frenzy. I expected no\nbetter than to be shot immediately by a rifle held against my head, but\ntheir orders were evidently different. My arms were securely bound with\nrough fibrous thongs, and then they marched me to the palace just as the\nsun was rising.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe Revelation of Hotep\n\n\nI was not a little surprised to see that they carried me to the same\nante-room in the palace which I had occupied on coming to Kem. But it\nwas now quite stripped of all furnishings, and over each door were hung\nlarge, closely-spun fabrics, which completely covered and concealed them\nfrom sight. There were but two little windows high above my head, and\nhad I been free to leap up to them, they were too small to afford me an\nexit. Driven into a stone slab of the floor were two large bent-wood\nstaples. Between these they placed several cushions, upon which they\nlaid me.\n\n\"May it please the strong man to rest here quietly, aye! and to slumber\nif he feel the need, until my master, the worshipful Zaphnath, be\nrisen?\" sneered the leader in polite irony, as the soldiers, having\nunbound my arms, proceeded to tie each hand securely to one of the\nwooden rings. Then with jeers they left me, pointing the fire-arms and\nswords at me as they went. I heard them bar the doors on the outside\nand try them with a severe shake; then their footsteps receded and all\nwas still.\n\nAs I lay on my back looking up at the vaulted stone roof, I had my first\nleisure to reflect on the desperate condition into which we had at last\nfallen. The arms, which had meant our supremacy, were in the hands of\nour enemies; Hotep, our only friend in the palace, had mysteriously\ndisappeared; the doctor was taken, perhaps killed by this time; and I\ncould hardly outlast the day, for Zaphnath would reserve but one fate\nfor a conspirator who sought his place. How soon would he come, and how\nwould he dispose of me? I remembered having seen the punishment for\ntreason of a noble personage, with whom I had once eaten at the\nPharaoh's table. He was confined at the bottom of a tight stone pit, and\na heavy, poisonous gas was slowly poured into it. He could see it slowly\nfill the pit, and as it gradually rose toward his nostrils, he could\nfeel his death gradually measured out to him by inches. When he had\nbreathed it in a little, his face swelled a livid purple, he choked and\nstrangled, staggered and fell beneath the murky surface to die out of\nsight. The terror of such a slowly creeping danger! the horror of such a\nrepulsive death! I remember saying at the time that in his place I would\nhave snatched a quick respite from the lingering agonies by strangling\nmyself, or tearing my wrist open with my teeth. Now, as I thought of\nit, I suddenly remembered my dream of being similarly smothered in the\nGnomons by slowly inpouring grain. A superstitious mind would have\nfeared that dream foretold my fate, but I was rational enough to\nperceive that it must have been suggested to me by a vagrant memory of\nthe poisoning I had seen.\n\nAs I lay thinking thus, I shifted my position a little on the pillows\nfor better comfort, and my eyes wandered slowly from the vaulted roof to\nthe daylight at the two little high windows. I started in terror at what\nI saw, but blinked my eyes to make sure I was awake, and then looked\nmore intently. There was no dreaming this time! I saw clearly, and at\nboth windows, a curling, purple stream of dense, noxious gas pouring\ndown into the room! It was much heavier than the air, and trickled\nslowly down like the ghost of murky waters gradually filling up a great\nwell. Then I turned to look at the floor, the stones were no longer\nvisible, but a coat of muddy purple covered them to a depth of several\ninches, and the noisome gas already reached almost to the tops of my\ncushions! All this had trickled in within ten minutes, and twice as much\nmore would rise and cover me completely. Then an awful but silent death\nwould creep into my lungs, and my only friends, the common people of\nKem, would never know how I had perished.\n\nDid I try to strangle myself or tear open my wrist? I could not get hand\nand mouth near enough together for either of these expedients, had the\nstubborn instinct of self-preservation left them any place in my mind. I\nkicked away the cushions, which gave me a little more room to work my\nknees under me. Then by straining on my thongs I was able to lift my\nhead and shoulders upright, and save my nostrils from the noxious stuff\nfor many minutes longer. All the years of my life on Ptah I had been\nvain of my superior physical strength. Would it serve me now to break\nthe thongs that bound me? I tugged, and pulled, and struggled until I\ncut the flesh, but they only drew tighter; yet at each effort I gained a\nlittle more length of thong.\n\nThe purple surface, on which death floated, crept up toward me. The room\nwas gas-tight; the doors were so covered that they could not leak, and\nhad I succeeded in breaking loose I could not have shaken their bars. To\nsave myself, I must make a breach in the floor; I must pull up a slab\nand let the gaseous poison run out below. That was my only chance. I\nworked my knees back as nearly as possible to the edge of the slab into\nwhich the wooden staples were fastened, and threw all my weight and\nstrength into the effort. The stone did not move. Yet I got more\nthong-room, and succeeded in doubling my feet under me to give more\nforce to the next heave. I felt sure I could have lifted the weight of\nthe stone if it were free, but struggle as I would, I could not loosen\nit from its wedged position. The purple poison had risen to my waist by\nthis time, and in my violent efforts I had stirred it into billowing\nwaves which occasionally surged almost to my nostrils. I had breathed a\nlittle which made me faint and giddy. I feared lest I should stagger and\nfall into it. Once my head below the surface, and I was most surely and\nhorribly drowned!\n\nI stood resting a second, anxiously thinking, planning in desperation\nand keeping my eyes always fixed on the rising purple. Suddenly, though\nI had given no tug, I heard the stone under me crunch at its edges, and\nfelt it begin to rise a little at one side! What could have loosened it,\nwhen all my efforts had failed? No matter! if I could pull it away now\nand make a breach, I would at least gain a long respite. I tugged again\nand found it easy to pull the loosened stone up on one edge, till it\ntottered and fell over against me. Feverishly I watched the poison about\nme; it rose no longer; slowly it began to sink away. Thank God for so\nmuch!\n\nThen suddenly I heard voices calling me. They seemed to come from below.\nYes! It was Hotep in Kemish,--and the doctor in English! Were they\nconfined in the cavern below, then? And had the gas been reserved for\nthem, when it had finished its dread work with me? Horrible thought! If\nso, in saving myself I was only sending the sure poison to them. Where\nwere they? I could not see down through the murky stuff; but I must\nwarn them.\n\n\"Halloo! The gas is poisonous! Leap through, save yourselves! Climb out,\nor it will kill you!\"\n\n\"Bear up!\" I heard the doctor's voice begin, \"one minute more and\nwe----\" Then there was a violent coughing, a door slammed, and the voice\nwas barely heard--afar off--as through a wall. Had they escaped, then,\nto another room? I had no further time to puzzle what it meant, for\nanother slab of my floor rose, wavered and fell over with a crash, and\nup through the purplish gas I could see a great round black thing\nrising, stretching high up into the room until its top almost touched\nthe roof.\n\nMy God! _It was the projectile!_\n\nWhen the breach in the floor was cleared, all the gas rushed down into\nthe lower chamber. The projectile eased over on its side, and out of the\nrear port-hole came Hotep with a revolver and a sword. He soon had me\ncut loose, and then he told me how it all had happened.\n\nHe had been chamberlain but a single day when he discovered the\nexistence of a secret subterranean chamber under the ante-room of the\nbanquet hall. His curiosity led him to explore this, and in its darkest\nrecess, unseen at first entrance, he found our projectile. It had been\nthere ever since the day of its disappearance. During our interview\nbefore Zaphnath and the wise men, they had learned from us that others\ncould not come from Earth without the projectile, and that we had left\nno third person in charge of it. It must have been with an order to make\naway with the projectile, and to secrete it in this chamber, that the\nthird messenger had been dispatched that day. Also on my first evening\nin this very ante-room, I had heard Two-spot barking in the chamber\nbelow, and the servant, on hearing him too, had him hastily released,\nlest he should betray the hiding-place.\n\nAs soon as Hotep had found the projectile, he had sent for us, but it\nwas the doctor alone who joined him. They two had been busy all that day\nand night repairing the projectile and storing it anew. In this manner\nthe doctor had escaped the soldiers who came at daybreak to capture us\nboth. Beyond the projectile, Hotep had discovered a secret passage\nleading outside the palace walls, which they could use on their errands\nof repairs without being observed.\n\nAll night they worked without disturbance, but early in the morning\nsomething happened to alarm them. They heard footsteps outside and a\nnoise at the door which led to the palace. It probably meant death to be\ndiscovered there, but they extinguished their lights, entered the\nprojectile, and closed the port-holes and lay there quite still. The\ndoor was opened, and soldiers bearing lights entered. But they made no\nsearch; they carried with them our swords, fire-arms, and the two belts\nof cartridges, which they deposited here, it being the natural place\nfor their safe keeping. When they were gone, the doctor emerged and\nexamined the revolvers and rifles, and finding that five cartridges had\nbeen discharged, he knew there had been a struggle with me in which I\nhad been worsted. This caused them to hasten their efforts and make an\nescape with the projectile as soon as possible. All the supplies\nnecessary to the batteries had been found intact in their places, and\nthe compressing of air with the repaired pump and the further storing of\nfood could be postponed till they were more free to do it.\n\nAt last the projectile lifted and worked; slowly it loosened the stones\nof my floor above them; but when one stone was pushed aside they noticed\nthat the daylight did not come through the breach as it ought. They had\nheard my cries, and as the gas came down on them, the doctor had slammed\nthe front port-hole, which was never wide open, and had thus saved\nhimself. Hotep was safely shut into the other compartment with the\nfire-arms and ammunition.\n\nThe doctor now came down to the rear port-hole to speak to me.\n\n\"My plan is to escape now to the Gnomons, where we will leave Hotep in\npossession with most of our fire-arms. You can give him some\ninstructions how to use them, so that he may defend himself. There we\ncan finish our stores of air and food.\" To this I assented, and said to\nHotep,--\n\n\"The Gnomons I give to thee, and all the land round about them, as a\nreward for thy most valuable assistance. Also I put into thy charge all\nmy stores of wheat, to be distributed among the needy. Thou must husband\nthem to last yet four years more, and for thine own thou mayest keep one\nmeasure in twenty. Take thou also a sword, a rifle, a revolver, and a\nbelt of cartridges. Mayhap, to thy right to rule they may add the power\nto be a Pharaoh!\"\n\nI was interrupted by a noise below, as of some one opening the door of\nthe secret chamber. All the deadly gas lurked in that room now, and it\nwas certain death to whoever opened and entered! Yet if an alarm had\nbeen raised it was there they would immediately go for the fire-arms. I\nlistened and heard faintly a voice of command, like that of Zaphnath,\nsaying, \"Haste, get me the thunderers!\" Then, as the door below creaked\nopen, I heard it louder: \"The thunderers!\" Next I heard many men in\nviolent fits of coughing; I heard some groan and fall; but who or how\nmany died by the purplish poison intended for me, I never knew.\n\nIt was but a moment later that hurried footsteps in the banquet-hall\nwere heard approaching the veiled doorway. I took the revolver from\nHotep, and motioned him inside the projectile. How cautiously they\nopened the door I could not see, for it was behind the great curtain.\nPresently, however, the captain who had bound me and bade me wait, drew\naside the curtain, and the Pharaoh stood in the door, and behind him\nwere a crowd of soldiers armed with cross-bows. In all the number I did\nnot see the face of Zaphnath. They beheld me alone, and had no reason to\nsuspect the presence of the others inside the projectile.\n\n\"Guard both the doors!\" the captain commanded, and a detachment of\nsoldiers barred the other door, as if thus to prevent me from escaping\nwith the projectile; for of course they had not seen it rise through the\nfloor.\n\n\"Seize and bind yon traitor!\" cried the Pharaoh; \"and he who hesitates\nshall be flayed!\"\n\n\"And he who attempts it, shall die ere his first step be taken!\" I\nreplied, levelling the revolver. The captain started for me and I shot\nhim down.\n\n\"If a man of you moves till I have entered this thing, I will kill the\nPharaoh, as I have killed this dog! Ye serve him best who stand still as\nye are!\" So saying, I covered the trembling monarch with the revolver,\nand with my other hand I opened the rear port-hole; then stooping, I\nsprang inside with a quick motion. When the Pharaoh had recovered from\nhis fright, I heard him cry out,--\n\n\"Cast that black thing, and the traitor inside it, into yon poisonous\nhole again!\"\n\nThe soldiers did not fear to act this time, and the whole company seized\nthe projectile and carried it toward the breach in the floor. As they\nlifted it on end to thrust into the hole, I called out to the doctor,\nwho turned in two batteries, and gently we lifted out of their dumb\nhands and rose steadily till we touched the roof. There the vaulted\nstonework stopped us, and an exultant shout went up from below. Suddenly\na score of arrows twanged against my window, but the doctor turned in\ntwo more batteries and then gradually we lifted the key of the great\nstone arch, broke through the roof, and the whole universe was an open\nsea before us!\n\nCrouching by me at the port-hole, Hotep watched the roof collapse and\ntumble in. \"For thy sake,\" I said to him, \"I hope a falling stone may\nhave crushed him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus ended our other-world life. In a time of activity it would never\nhave occurred to me to write down these events. It was to relieve the\nuneventful quiet of our trip back to Earth that I undertook to set down\nall our Martian experiences in their proper order. No doubt it was the\nchangeless monotony of that return journey which made the record appear\nto me novel, unusual, and at times exciting. But now, six little months\nagain on Earth have made the more than three Martian years (equalling\nsix years of Earth) seem slow, tame, and profitless. If they were\npregnant with adventure, they lacked the real experiences of life which\nhave been crowded into the half-year since our return.\n\nThe very day I reached my old home I found another wheat corner more\nwide-spread, if less complete and impregnable, and I set to work to\nbreak it down. Thus the maelstr\u00f6m of modern commercial life dragged me\ninto its dizzy whirl before I slept the first night on Earth, and I am\nalready surfeited with it. I seem to take the Earthly life in too large\nand rapid doses. Into the half-year she has put a flattering success and\na dismaying failure. She has given me a month of her sweetest\nexperiences and another of her bitterest disappointments. As if she knew\nI would not remain long at her feast, she has served to me in quick\nsuccession a measure of renown, a taste of fortune, the rapture of\nwooing, the bliss of marriage, and the rare delight of loving a soul\ncreated to love me. Then one little drop from the cup of Death\nembittered the whole feast and turned me against it all.\n\nIn the rush and turmoil of it all I should never have thought of my\ncrudely written narrative again had not my cousin Ruth, who never tired\nof the story, fished it out and sent it to a literary friend in Boston.\nIt was probably the instant success in the scientific world of Dr.\nAnderwelt's scholarly books on _Mars and His Life_, and the new\ndirection given to modern thought by his _Theory of Parallel Planetary\nLife_, which led my literary sponsor to think the world would be\ninterested in a plain, unscientific narrative of our trip Marsward and\nour doings there. In agreeing to look it over and cause it to be a \"good\ndelivery\" in the literary world, he exacted a promise from me to make\nmy recent Earthly experiences and our adventures on Venus join in\nproducing another story. For before the eyes of the first reader have\nreached these words, Dr. Anderwelt and I will have departed sunwards, on\nthe visit to our brilliant sister planet, where, according to his\ntheory, life will have run through some 31,000 years more than Earth\ntoward the perfect existence. By the first return of the projectile I\nhave promised to send back a thorough account of the evolution of life\nand the advancement of civilization on Venus, so far as Earthly eyes and\nwits can see and know it.\n\n\n\n\nButler & Tanner, The Selwood Printing Works, Frome, and London.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pharaoh's Broker, by Ellsworth Douglass\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHARAOH'S BROKER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25295-8.txt or 25295-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/2/9/25295/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, George Snoga, Stephen Blundell and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
