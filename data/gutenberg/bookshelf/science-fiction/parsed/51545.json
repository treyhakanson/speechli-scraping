A simple\n               boon to grant--first decide what part of\n               you it is that you wish to have survive!\n\n\n\"Absolutely impossible,\" declared Professor Carver.\n\n\"But I saw it,\" said Fred, his companion and bodyguard. \"Late last\nnight, I saw it! They carried in this hunter--he had his head half\nripped off--and they--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Professor Carver said, leaning forward expectantly.\n\nThey had left their spaceship before dawn, in order to witness the\nsunrise ceremonies in the village of Loray, upon the planet of the same\nname. Sunrise ceremonies, viewed from a proper distance, are often\ncolorful and can provide a whole chapter for an anthropologist's book;\nbut Loray, as usual, proved a disappointment.\n\nWithout fanfare, the sun rose, in answers to prayers made to it the\npreceding night. Slowly it hoisted its dull red expanse above the\nhorizon, warming the topmost branches of the great rain-forest that\nsurrounded the village. And the natives slept on....\n\nNot _all_ the natives. Already the Sweeper was out, cleaning the\ndebris between huts with his twig broom. He slowly shuffled along,\nhuman-shaped but unutterably alien. The Sweeper's face was a stylized\nblank, as though nature had drawn there a preliminary sketch of\nintelligent life. His head was strangely knobbed and his skin was\npigmented a dirty gray.\n\nThe Sweeper sang to himself as he swept, in a thick, guttural voice. In\nonly one way was the Sweeper distinguishable from his fellow Lorayans:\npainted across his face was a broad black band. This was his mark of\nstation, the lowest possible station in that primitive society.\n\n\"Now then,\" Professor Carver said, after the sun had arisen without\nincident, \"a phenomenon such as you describe could not exist. And it\nmost especially could not exist upon a debased, scrubby little planet\nlike this.\"\n\n\"I saw what I saw,\" Fred maintained. \"I don't know from impossible,\nProfessor. I saw it. You want to pass it up, that's up to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned against the gnarly bole of a stabicus tree, folded his arms\nacross his meager chest and glowered at the thatch-roofed village. They\nhad been on Loray for nearly two months and Fred detested the village\nmore each day.\n\nHe was an underweight, unlovely young man and he wore his hair in a\nbristling crewcut which accentuated the narrowness of his brow. He\nhad accompanied the professor for close to ten years, had journeyed\nwith him to dozens of planets, and had seen many strange and wonderful\nthings. Everything he saw, however, only increased his contempt for\nthe Galaxy at large. He desired only to return, wealthy and famous, or\nwealthy and unknown, to his home in Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\n\"This thing could make us rich,\" Fred accused. \"And _you_ want to pass\nit up.\"\n\nProfessor Carver pursed his lips thoughtfully. Wealth was a pleasant\nthought, of course. But the professor didn't want to interrupt his\nimportant scientific work to engage in a wild goose chase. He was\nnow completing his great book, the book that would fully amplify and\ndocument the thesis that he had put forth in his first paper, _Color\nBlindness Among the Thang Peoples_. He had expanded the thesis in his\nbook, _Lack of Coordination in the Drang Race_. He had generalized it\nin his monumental _Intelligence Deficiencies Around the Galaxy_,\nin which he proved conclusively that intelligence among Non-Terrans\ndecreases arithmetically as their planet's distance from Terra\nincreases geometrically.\n\nNow the thesis had come to full flower in Carver's most recent work,\nhis unifying effort, which was to be titled _Underlying Causes of the\nImplicit Inferiority of Non-Terran Peoples_.\n\n\"If you're right--\" Carver said.\n\n\"Look!\" Fred cried. \"They're bringing in another! See for yourself!\"\n\nProfessor Carver hesitated. He was a portly, impressive, red-jowled\nman, given to slow and deliberate movement. He was dressed in a\ntropical explorer's uniform, although Loray was in a temperate zone. He\ncarried a leather swagger stick, and strapped to his waist was a large\nrevolver, a twin to the one Fred wore.\n\n\"If you're right,\" Carver said slowly, \"it would indeed be, so to\nspeak, a feather in the cap.\"\n\n\"Come on!\" said Fred.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour srag hunters were carrying a wounded companion to the medicine\nhut, and Carver and Fred fell in beside them. The hunters were visibly\nexhausted; they must have trekked for days to bring their friend to the\nvillage, for the srag hunts ranged deep into the rain-forest.\n\n\"Looks done for, huh?\" Fred whispered.\n\nProfessor Carver nodded. Last month he had photographed a srag, from\na vantage point very high in a very tall, stout tree. He knew it for\na large, ill-tempered, quick-moving beast, with a dismaying array of\nclaws, teeth and horns. It was also the only non-taboo meat-bearing\nanimal on the planet. The natives had to kill srags or starve.\n\nBut the wounded man had not been quick enough with spear and shield,\nand the srag had opened him from throat to pelvis. The hunter had bled\ncopiously, even though the wound had been hastily bound with dried\ngrasses. Mercifully, he was unconscious.\n\n\"That chap hasn't a chance,\" Carver remarked. \"It's a miracle he's\nstayed alive this long. Shock alone, to say nothing of the depth and\nextent of the wound--\"\n\n\"You'll see,\" Fred said.\n\nThe village had suddenly come awake. Men and women, gray-skinned,\nknobby-headed, looked silently as the hunters marched toward the\nmedicine hut. The Sweeper paused to watch. The village's only child\nstood before his parents' hut, and, thumb in mouth, stared at the\nprocession. Deg, the medicine man, came out to meet the hunters,\nalready wearing his ceremonial mask. The healing dancers assembled,\nquickly putting on their makeup.\n\n\"Think you can fix him, Doc?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"One may hope,\" Deg replied piously.\n\nThey entered the dimly lighted medicine hut. The wounded Lorayan was\nlaid tenderly upon a pallet of grasses and the dancers began to perform\nbefore him. Deg started a solemn chant.\n\n\"That'll never do it,\" Professor Carver pointed out to Fred, with the\ninterested air of a man watching a steam shovel in operation. \"Too late\nfor faith healing. Listen to his breathing. Shallower, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Fred said.\n\nDeg finished his chant and bent over the wounded hunter. The Lorayan's\nbreathing was labored. It slowed, hesitated....\n\n\"It is time!\" cried the medicine man. He took a small wooden tube out\nof his pouch, uncorked it, and held it to the dying man's lips. The\nhunter drank. And then--\n\nCarver blinked, and Fred grinned triumphantly. The hunter's breathing\nwas becoming stronger. As they watched, the great gash became a line of\nscar tissue, then a thin pink mark, then an almost invisible white line.\n\nThe hunter sat up, scratched his head, grinned foolishly and asked for\nsomething to drink, preferably intoxicating.\n\nDeg declared a festival on the spot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarver and Fred moved to the edge of the rain-forest for a conference.\nThe professor walked like a man in a dream. His pendulous lower lip was\nthrust out and occasionally he shook his head.\n\n\"How about it?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"It shouldn't be possible,\" said Carver dazedly. \"No substance in\nnature should react like that. And you saw it work last night also?\"\n\n\"Damned well right,\" Fred said. \"They brought in this hunter--he had\nhis head pulled half off. He swallowed some of that stuff and healed\nright before my eyes.\"\n\n\"Man's age-old dream,\" Carver mused. \"A universal panacea!\"\n\n\"We could get any price for stuff like that,\" Fred said.\n\n\"Yes, we could--as well as performing a duty to science,\" Professor\nCarver reminded him sternly. \"Yes, Fred, I think we should obtain some\nof that substance.\"\n\nThey turned and, with firm strides, marched back to the village.\n\nDances were in progress, given by various members of the beast cults.\nAt the moment, the Sathgohani, a cult representing a medium-sized\ndeerlike animal, were performing. They could be recognized by the three\nred dots on their foreheads. Waiting their turn were the men of the\nDresfeyxi and the Taganyes, cults representing other forest animals.\nThe beasts adopted by the cults were taboo and there was an absolute\ninjunction against their slaughter. Carver had been unable to discover\nthe rationale behind this rule. The Lorayans refused to speak of it.\n\nDeg, the medicine man, had removed his ceremonial mask. He was seated\nin front of his hut, watching the dancing. He arose when the Earthmen\napproached him.\n\n\"Peace!\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Fred. \"Nice job you did this morning.\"\n\nDeg smiled modestly. \"The gods answered our prayers.\"\n\n\"The gods?\" said Carver. \"It looked as though the serum did most of the\nwork.\"\n\n\"Serum? Oh, the sersee juice!\" Deg made a ceremonial gesture as he\nmentioned the name. \"Yes, the sersee juice is the mother of the Lorayan\npeople.\"\n\n\"We'd like to buy some,\" Fred said bluntly, ignoring Professor Carver's\ndisapproving frown. \"What would you take for a gallon?\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" Deg said.\n\n\"How about some nice beads? Mirrors? Or maybe a couple of steel knives?\"\n\n\"It cannot be done,\" the medicine man asserted. \"The sersee juice is\nsacred. It must be used only for holy healing.\"\n\n\"Don't hand me that,\" Fred said, a flush mounting his sallow cheek.\n\"You gooks think you can--\"\n\n\"We quite understand,\" Carver broke in smoothly. \"We know about sacred\nthings. Sacred things are sacred. They are not to be touched by\nprofane hands.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy?\" Fred whispered in English.\n\n\"You are a wise man,\" Deg said gravely. \"You understand why I must\nrefuse you.\"\n\n\"Of course. But it happens, Deg, I am a medicine man in my own country.\"\n\n\"Ah? I did not know this!\"\n\n\"It is so. As a matter of fact, in my particular line, I am the highest\nmedicine man.\"\n\n\"Then you must be a very holy man,\" Deg said, bowing his head.\n\n\"Man, he's holy!\" Fred put in emphatically. \"Holiest man you'll ever\nsee around here.\"\n\n\"Please, Fred,\" Carver said, blinking modestly. He said to the medicine\nman, \"It's true, although I don't like to hear about it. Under the\ncircumstances, however, you can see that it would not be wrong to give\nme some sersee juice. On the contrary, it is your priestly duty to give\nme some.\"\n\nThe medicine man pondered for a long time while contrary emotions\npassed just barely perceptibly over his almost blank face. At last he\nsaid, \"It may be so. Unfortunately, I cannot do what you require.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because there is so little sersee juice, so terribly little. There is\nhardly enough for the village.\"\n\nDeg smiled sadly and walked away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLife in the village continued its simple, invariant way. The Sweeper\nmoved slowly along, cleaning with his twig broom. The hunters trekked\nout in search of srags. The women of the village prepared food and\nlooked after the village's one child. The priests and dancers prayed\nnightly for the sun to rise in the morning. Everyone was satisfied, in\na humble, submissive fashion.\n\nEveryone except the Earthmen.\n\nThey had more talks with Deg and slowly learned the complete story of\nthe sersee juice and the troubles surrounding it.\n\nThe sersee bush was a small and sickly affair. It did not flourish in\na state of nature. Yet it resisted cultivation and positively defied\ntransplantation. The best one could do was to weed thoroughly around it\nand hope it would blossom. But most sersee bushes struggled for a year\nor two, then gave up the ghost. A few blossomed, and a few out of the\nfew lived long enough to produce their characteristic red berries.\n\nFrom the berry of the sersee bush was squeezed the elixir that meant\nlife to the people of Loray.\n\n\"And you must remember,\" Deg pointed out, \"how sparsely the sersee\ngrows and how widely scattered it is. We must search for months,\nsometimes, to find a single bush with berries. And those berries will\nsave the life of only a single Lorayan, or perhaps two at the most.\"\n\n\"Sad, very sad,\" Carver said. \"But surely some form of intensive\nfertilization--\"\n\n\"Everything has been tried.\"\n\n\"I realize,\" Carver said earnestly, \"how important the sersee juice is\nto you. But if you could give us a little--even a pint or two--we could\ntake it to Earth, have it examined, synthesized, perhaps. Then you\ncould have all you need.\"\n\n\"But we dare not give any. Have you noticed how few children we have?\"\n\nCarver nodded.\n\n\"There are very few births. Our life is a constant struggle against\nthe obliteration of our race. Every man's life must be preserved until\nthere is a child to replace him. And this can be done only by our\nconstant and never-ending search for the sersee berries. And there are\nnever enough,\" the medicine man sighed. \"Never enough.\"\n\n\"Does the juice cure _everything_?\" Fred asked.\n\n\"It does more than that. Those who have tasted sersee add fifty of our\nyears to their lives.\"\n\nCarver opened his eyes wide. Fifty years on Loray was roughly the\nequivalent of sixty-three on Earth.\n\nThe sersee was more than a healing agent, more than a regenerator. It\nwas a longevity drug as well.\n\nHe paused to consider the prospect of adding another sixty years to his\nlifetime. Then he asked, \"What happens if a man takes sersee again\nafter the fifty years?\"\n\n\"We do not know,\" Deg told him. \"No man would take it a second time\nwhile there is not enough.\"\n\nCarver and Fred exchanged glances.\n\n\"Now listen to me carefully, Deg,\" Professor Carver said. He spoke of\nthe sacred duties of science. Science, he told the medicine man, was\nabove race, above creed, above religion. The advancement of science\nwas above life itself. What did it matter, after all, if a few more\nLorayans died? They would die eventually anyhow. The important thing\nwas for Terran science to have a sample of sersee.\n\n\"It may be as you say,\" Deg said. \"But my choice is clear. As a priest\nof the Sunniheriat religion, I have a sacred trust to preserve the\nlives of my people. I cannot go against this trust.\"\n\nHe turned and walked off. The Earthmen frustratedly returned to their\nspaceship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter coffee, Professor Carver opened a drawer and took out the\nmanuscript of _Underlying Causes for the Implicit Inferiority of\nNon-Terran Races_. Lovingly he read over the last chapter, the chapter\nthat dealt with the specialized inferiorities of the Lorayan people.\nThen he put the manuscript away.\n\n\"Almost finished, Fred,\" he told his assistant. \"Another week's work,\ntwo weeks at the most!\"\n\n\"Um,\" Fred replied, staring at the village through a porthole.\n\n\"This will do it,\" Carver said. \"This book will prove, once and for\nall, the natural superiority of Terrans. We have proven it by force of\narms, Fred, and we have proven it by our technology. Now it is proven\nby the impersonal processes of logic.\"\n\nFred nodded. He knew the professor was quoting from the book's\nintroduction.\n\n\"Nothing must interfere with the great work,\" Carver said. \"You agree\nwith that, don't you?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Fred said absent-mindedly. \"The book comes first. Put the gooks\nin their place.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't exactly mean that. But you know what I mean. Under the\ncircumstances, perhaps we should forget about sersee. Perhaps we should\njust finish the job we started.\"\n\nFred turned and faced his employer. \"Professor, how much do you expect\nto make out of this book?\"\n\n\"Hm? Well, the last did quite well, you will remember. This book should\ndo even better. Ten, perhaps twenty thousand dollars!\" He permitted\nhimself a small smile. \"I am fortunate, you see, in my subject matter.\nThe general public of Earth seems to be rather interested in it, which\nis gratifying for a scientist.\"\n\n\"Say you even make fifty thousand. Chicken feed! Do you know what we\ncould make on a test tube of sersee?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand?\" Carver said vaguely.\n\n\"Are you kidding? Suppose a rich guy was dying and we had the only\nthing to cure him. He'd give everything he owned! Millions!\"\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" Carver agreed. \"And it _would_ be a valuable\nscientific advancement.... But the medicine man unfortunately won't\ngive us any.\"\n\n\"Buying isn't the only way.\" Fred unholstered his revolver and checked\nthe chambers.\n\n\"I see, I see,\" Carver said, his red face turning slightly pale. \"But\nhave we the right?\"\n\n\"What do _you_ think?\"\n\n\"Well, they _are_ inferior. I believe I have proven that conclusively.\nYou might indeed say that their lives don't weigh heavily in the scheme\nof things. Hm, yes--yes, Fred, we could save Terran lives with this!\"\n\n\"We could save our own lives,\" Fred said. \"Who wants to punk out ahead\nof time?\"\n\nCarver stood up and determinedly loosened his gun in its holster.\n\"Remember,\" he told Fred, \"we are doing this in the name of science,\nand for Earth.\"\n\n\"Absolutely, Professor,\" Fred said, moving toward the port, grinning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found Deg near the medicine hut. Carver said, without preamble,\n\"We must have some sersee.\"\n\n\"But I explained to you,\" said the medicine man. \"I told you why it was\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"We gotta have it,\" Fred said. He pulled his revolver from its holster\nand looked ferociously at Deg.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You think I'm kidding?\" Fred asked. \"You know what this weapon can do?\"\n\n\"I have seen you use it.\"\n\n\"Maybe you think I won't use it on you.\"\n\n\"I do not care. You can have no sersee.\"\n\n\"I'll shoot,\" Fred warned, his voice rising angrily. \"I swear to you,\nI'll shoot.\"\n\nThe villagers of Loray slowly gathered behind their medicine man.\nGray-skinned, knobby-headed, they moved silently into position, the\nhunters carrying their spears, other villagers armed with knives and\nstones.\n\n\"You cannot have the sersee,\" Deg said.\n\nFred slowly leveled the revolver.\n\n\"Now, Fred,\" said Carver, \"there's an awful lot of them. Do you really\nthink--\"\n\nFred's thin body tightened and his finger grew taut and white on the\ntrigger. Carver closed his eyes.\n\nThere was a moment of dead silence. Then the revolver exploded. Carver\nwarily opened his eyes.\n\nThe medicine man was still erect, although his knees were shaking.\nFred was pulling back the hammer of the revolver. The villagers had\nmade no sound. It was a moment before Carver could figure out what had\nhappened. At last he saw the Sweeper.\n\nThe Sweeper lay on his face, his outstretched left hand still clutching\nhis twig broom, his legs twitching feebly. Blood welled from the hole\nFred had neatly drilled through his forehead.\n\nDeg bent over the Sweeper, then straightened. \"He is dead,\" the\nmedicine man said.\n\n\"That's just the first,\" Fred warned, taking aim at a hunter.\n\n\"No!\" cried Deg.\n\nFred looked at him with raised eyebrows.\n\n\"I will give it to you,\" Deg said. \"I will give you all our sersee\njuice. Then you must go!\"\n\nHe ran into the medicine hut and reappeared a moment later with three\nwooden tubes, which he thrust into Fred's hands.\n\n\"We're in business, Professor,\" Fred said. \"Let's get moving!\"\n\nThey walked past the silent villagers, toward their spaceship.\nSomething bright flashed in the sunlight. Fred yipped and dropped his\nrevolver. Professor Carver hastily scooped it up.\n\n\"One of those gooks cut me,\" Fred said. \"Give me the revolver!\"\n\nA spear arced high and buried itself at their feet.\n\n\"Too many of them,\" said Carver. \"Let's run for it!\"\n\nThey sprinted to their ship with spears and knives singing around them,\nreached it safely and bolted the port.\n\n\"Too close,\" Carver said, panting for breath, leaning against the\ndogged port. \"Have you got the serum?\"\n\n\"I got it,\" said Fred, rubbing his arm. \"Damn!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"My arm. It feels numb.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCarver examined the wound, pursed his lips thoughtfully, but made no\ncomment.\n\n\"It's numb,\" Fred said. \"I wonder if they poison those spears.\"\n\n\"It's quite possible,\" Professor Carver admitted.\n\n\"They did!\" Fred shouted. \"Look, the cut is changing color already!\"\n\nThe edges of the wound had a blackened, septic look.\n\n\"Sulfa,\" Carver said. \"Penicillin, too. I wouldn't worry much about it,\nFred. Modern Terran drugs--\"\n\n\"--might not even touch this stuff. Open one of those tubes!\"\n\n\"But, Fred,\" Carver objected, \"we have so little of it. Besides--\"\n\n\"To hell with that,\" Fred said. He took one of the tubes and uncorked\nit with his teeth.\n\n\"Wait, Fred!\"\n\n\"Wait, nothing!\"\n\nFred drained the contents of the tube and flung it down. Carver said\ntestily, \"I was merely going to point out that the serum should be\ntested before an Earthman uses it. We don't know how it'll react on a\nhuman. It was for your own good.\"\n\n\"Sure it was,\" Fred said mockingly. \"Just look at how the stuff is\nreacting.\"\n\nThe blackened wound had turned flesh-colored again and was sealing.\nSoon there was a line of white scar tissue. Then even that was gone,\nleaving firm pink flesh beneath.\n\n\"Pretty good, huh?\" Fred gloated, with a slight touch of hysteria. \"It\nworks, Professor, it works! Drink one yourself, pal, live another sixty\nyears. Do you suppose we can synthesize this stuff? Worth a million,\nworth ten million, worth a billion. And if we can't, there's always\ngood old Loray. We can drop back every fifty years or so for a refill.\nThe stuff even tastes good, Professor. Tastes like--what's wrong?\"\n\nProfessor Carver was staring at Fred, his eyes wide with astonishment.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Fred asked, grinning. \"Ain't my seams straight?\nWhat you staring at?\"\n\nCarver didn't answer. His mouth trembled. Slowly he backed away.\n\n\"What the hell is wrong!\" Fred glared at Carver. Then he ran to the\nspaceship's head and looked in the mirror.\n\n\"_What's happened to me?_\"\n\nCarver tried to speak, but no words came. He watched as Fred's features\nslowly altered, smoothed, became blank, rudimentary, as though nature\nhad drawn there a preliminary sketch of intelligent life. Strange knobs\nwere coming out on Fred's head. His complexion was changing slowly from\npink to gray.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I told you to wait,\" Carver sighed.\n\n\"_What's happening?_\" asked Fred in a frightened whimper.\n\n\"Well,\" Carver said, \"it must all be residual in the sersee. The\nLorayan birth-rate is practically nonexistent, you know. Even with the\nsersee's healing powers, the race should have died out long ago. Unless\nthe serum had another purpose as well--the ability to change lower\nanimal forms into the Lorayan form.\"\n\n\"That's a wild guess!\"\n\n\"A working hypothesis based upon Deg's statement that sersee is the\nmother of the Lorayan people. I'm afraid that is the true meaning of\nthe beast cults and the reason they are taboo. The various beasts must\nbe the origins of certain portions of the Lorayan people, perhaps\nall the Lorayan people. Even the topic is taboo; there clearly is\na deep-seated sense of inferiority about their recent step up from\nbestiality.\"\n\nCarver rubbed his forehead wearily. \"The sersee juice has,\" he\ncontinued, \"we may hazard, a role-sharing in terms of the life of the\nrace. We may theorize--\"\n\n\"To hell with theory,\" Fred said, and was horrified to find that his\nvoice had grown thick and guttural, like a Lorayan voice. \"Professor,\ndo something!\"\n\n\"There's nothing I can do.\"\n\n\"Maybe Terran science--\"\n\n\"No, Fred,\" Carver said quietly.\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\n\"Fred, please try to understand. I can't bring you back to Earth.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? You must be crazy!\"\n\n\"Not at all. How can I bring you back with such a fantastic story? They\nwould consider the whole thing a gigantic hoax.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Listen to me. No one would believe! They would consider, rather, that\nyou were an unusually intelligent Lorayan. Your very presence, Fred,\nwould undermine the whole thesis of my book!\"\n\n\"You can't leave me,\" Fred said. \"You just can't do that.\"\n\nProfessor Carver still had both revolvers. He stuck one in his belt and\nleveled the other.\n\n\"I am not going to endanger the work of a lifetime. Get out, Fred.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I mean it. Get out, Fred.\"\n\n\"I won't! You'll have to shoot me!\"\n\n\"I will if I must,\" Carver assured him. \"I'll shoot you and throw you\nout.\"\n\nHe took aim. Fred backed to the port, undogged it, opened it. The\nvillagers were waiting quietly outside.\n\n\"What will they do to me?\"\n\n\"I'm really sorry, Fred,\" Carver said.\n\n\"I won't go!\" Fred shrieked, gripping the edges of the port with both\nhands.\n\nCarver shoved him into the waiting hands of the crowd and threw the\nremaining tubes of sersee after him. Then, quickly, not wishing to see\nwhat was going to happen, he sealed the port.\n\nWithin an hour, he was leaving the planet's atmospheric limits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he returned to Earth, his book, _Underlying Causes of the Implicit\nInferiority of Non-Terran Peoples_, was hailed as a milestone in\ncomparative anthropology. But he ran into some difficulty almost at\nonce.\n\nA space captain named Jones returned to Earth and maintained that,\non the planet Loray, he had discovered a native who was in every\nsignificant way the equal of a Terran. And he had tape recordings and\nmotion pictures to prove it.\n\nCarver's thesis seemed in doubt for some time, until Carver examined\nthe evidence for himself. Then he pointed out, with merciless logic,\nthat the so-called super-Lorayan, this paragon of Loray, this supposed\nequal of Terran humanity, occupied the lowest position in the Lorayan\nhierarchy, the position of Sweeper, clearly shown by the broad black\nstripe across his face.\n\nThe space captain admitted that this was true.\n\nWhy then, Carver thundered, was this Lorayan Superior not able, in\nspite of his so-called abilities, to reach any higher position in the\ndebased society in which he dwelt?\n\nThe question silenced the space captain and his supporters, demolished\nthe entire school, as a matter of fact. And the Carverian Doctrine of\nthe Implicit Inferiority of Non-Terrans is now accepted by reasoning\nTerrans everywhere in the Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sweeper of Loray, by Finn O'Donnevan\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SWEEPER OF LORAY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51545.txt or 51545.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/5/4/51545/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
