LOVECRAFT\n First Vice-President U. A. P. A.]\n\n\n\n\nUnited Amateur Press Association\n\nEXPONENT OF AMATEUR JOURNALISM\n\n\nITS OBJECT\n\nThe desire to write for publication is one which inheres strongly in\nevery human breast. From the proficient college graduate, storming the\ngates of the high-grade literary magazines, to the raw schoolboy, vainly\nendeavoring to place his first crude compositions in the local\nnewspapers, the whole intelligent public are today seeking expression\nthrough the printed page, and yearning to behold their thoughts and\nideals permanently crystallized in the magic medium of type. But while a\nfew persons of exceptional talent manage eventually to gain a foothold\nin the professional world of letters rising to celebrity through the\nwide diffusion of their art, ideals, or opinions; the vast majority,\nunless aided in their education by certain especial advantages, are\ndoomed to confine their expression to the necessarily restricted sphere\nof ordinary conversation. To supply these especial educational\nadvantages which may enable the general public to achieve the\ndistinction of print, and which may prevent the talented but unknown\nauthor from remaining forever in obscurity, has arisen that largest and\nforemost of societies for literary education =The United Amateur Press\nAssociation=.\n\n\nITS ORIGIN\n\nAmateur journalism, or the composition and circulation of small,\nprivately printed magazines, is an instructive diversion which has\nexisted in the United States for over half a century. In the decade of\n1866-1876 this practice first became an organized institution; a\nshort-lived society of amateur journalists, including the now famous\npublisher, Charles Scribner, having existed from 1869 to 1874. In 1876 a\nmore lasting society was formed, which exists to this day as an exponent\nof light dilettantism. Not until 1895, however, was amateur journalism\nestablished as a serious branch of educational endeavour. On September\n2nd of that year, Mr. William H. Greenfield, a gifted professional\nauthor, of Philadelphia, founded =The United Amateur Press Association=,\nwhich has grown to be the leader of its kind, and the representative of\namateur journalism in its best phases throughout the English-speaking\nworld.\n\n\nITS NATURE\n\nIn many respects the word \"amateur\" fails to do full credit to amateur\njournalism and the association which best represents it. To some minds\nthe term conveys an idea of crudity and immaturity, yet the =United= can\nboast of members and publications whose polish and scholarship are\nwell-nigh impeccable. In considering the adjective \"amateur\" as applied\nto the press association, we must adhere to the more basic\ninterpretation, regarding the word as indicating the non-mercenary\nnature of the membership. Our amateurs write purely for love of their\nart, without the stultifying influence of commercialism. Many of them\nare prominent professional authors in the outside world, but their\nprofessionalism never creeps into their association work. The atmosphere\nis wholly fraternal, and courtesy takes the place of currency.\n\nThe real essential of amateur journalism and =The United Amateur Press\nAssociation= is the amateur paper or magazine, which somewhat resembles\nthe average high-school or college publication. These journals, varying\ngreatly in size and character, are issued by various members at their\nown expense, and contain, besides the literary work of their several\neditors or publishers, contributions from all the many members who do\nnot publish papers of their own. Their columns are open to every person\nin the association, and it may be said with justice that no one will\nfind it impossible to secure the publication of any literary composition\nof reasonable brevity. The papers thus published are sent free to all\nour many members, who constitute a select and highly appreciative\nreading public. Since each member receives the published work of every\nother member, many active and brilliant minds are brought into close\ncontact, and questions of every sort, literary, historical, and\nscientific, are debated both in the press and in personal\ncorrespondence. The correspondence of members is one of the most\nvaluable features of the =United=, for through this medium a great\nintellectual stimulus, friendly and informal in nature, is afforded.\nCongenial members are in this way brought together in a lettered\ncompanionship, which often grows into life-long friendship, while\npersons of opposed ideas may mutually gain much breadth of mind by\nhearing the other side of their respective opinions discussed in a\ngenial manner. In short, the =United= offers an exceptionally\nwell-proportioned mixture of instruction and fraternal cheer. There are\nno limits of age, sex, education, position, or locality in this most\ncomplete of democracies. Boys and girls of twelve and men and women of\nsixty, parents and their sons and daughters, college professors and\ngrammar-school pupils, aristocrats and intelligent labourers, Easterners\nand Westerners, are here given equal advantages, those of greater\neducation helping their cruder brethren until the common fund of culture\nis as nearly level as it can be in any human organization. Members are\nclassified according to age; \"A\" meaning under sixteen, \"B\" from 16 to\n21, and \"C\" over 21. The advantages offered to those of limited\nacquirements are immense, many persons having gained practically all\ntheir literary polish through membership in the =United=. A much\ncherished goal is professional authorship or editorship, and numerous\nindeed are the =United= members who have now become recognized authors,\npoets, editors, and publishers. True, though trite, is the saying that\namateur journalism is an actual training school for professional\njournalism.\n\n\nITS PUBLISHING ACTIVITIES\n\nMembers of the =United= may or may not publish little papers of their\nown. This is a matter of choice, for there are always enough journals to\nprint the work of the non-publishing members. Youths who possess\nprinting presses will find publishing an immense but inexpensive\npleasure, whilst other publishers may have their printing done at very\nreasonable rates by those who do own presses. The favorite size for\namateur papers is 5\u00d77 inches, which can be printed at 55 or 60 cents per\npage, each page containing about 250 words. Thus a four-page issue\ncontaining 1000 words can be published for less than $2.50, if\narrangements are made, as is often the case, for its free mailing with\nany other paper. Certain of the more pretentious journals affect the\n7\u00d710 size, which costs about $1.60 for each page of 700 words. These\nfigures allow for 250 copies, the most usual number to be mailed. Mr.\nE. E. Ericson of Elroy, Wisconsin, is our Official Printer, and his work\nis all that the most fastidious could demand. Other printers may be\nfound amongst the young men who print their own papers. In many cases\nthey can quote very satisfactory prices. Two or more members may issue a\npaper co-operatively, the individual expense then being very slight.\n\n\nITS CONTRIBUTED LITERATURE\n\nThe =United= welcomes all literary contributions; poems, stories, and\nessays, which the various members may submit. However, contribution is\nby no means compulsory, and in case a member finds himself too busy for\nactivity, he may merely enjoy the free papers which reach him, without\ntaxing himself with literary labour. For those anxious to contribute,\nevery facility is provided. In some cases negotiations are made directly\nbetween publisher and contributor, but the majority are accommodated by\nthe two Manuscript Bureaus, Eastern and Western, which receive\ncontributions in any quantity from the non-publishing members, and are\ndrawn upon for material by those who issue papers. These bureaus\npractically guarantee on the one hand to find a place for each member's\nmanuscript, and on the other hand to keep each publisher well supplied\nwith matter for his journal.\n\n\nITS CRITICAL DEPARTMENTS\n\nThe two critical departments of the =United= are at present the most\nsubstantial of its various educational advantages. The Department of\nPrivate Criticism is composed exclusively of highly cultured members,\nusually professors or teachers of English, who practically mould the\ntaste of the whole association, receiving and revising before\npublication the work of all who choose to submit it to them. The service\nfurnished free by this department is in every way equal to that for\nwhich professional critical bureaus charge about two dollars.\nManuscripts are carefully corrected and criticised in every detail, and\nauthors are given comprehensive advice designed to elevate their taste,\nstyle, and grammar. Many a crude but naturally gifted writer has been\ndeveloped to polished fluency and set on the road to professional\nauthorship through the =United's= Department of Private Criticism.\n\nThe Department of Public Criticism reviews thoroughly and impartially\nthe various printed papers and their contents, offering precepts and\nsuggestions for improvement. Its reports are printed in the official\norgan of the association, and serve as a record of our literary\nachievement.\n\n\nITS LITERARY AWARDS\n\nTo encourage excellence amongst the members of the =United=, annual\nhonours or \"laureateships\" are awarded the authors of the best poems,\nstories, essays, or editorials. Participation in these competitions is\nnot compulsory, since they apply only to pieces which have been\nespecially \"entered for laureateship.\" The entries are judged not by the\nmembers of the association, but by highly distinguished litterateurs of\nthe professional world, selected particularly for the occasion. Our\nlatest innovation is a laureateship for the best home-printed paper,\nwhich will excite keen rivalry among our younger members, and bring out\nsome careful specimens of the typographical art. Besides the\nlaureateships there are other honours and prizes awarded by individual\npublishers within the =United=, many of the amateur journals offering\nexcellent books for the best stories, reviews, or reports submitted to\nthem.\n\n\nITS OFFICIAL ORGAN\n\nThe association, as a whole, publishes a voluminous 7\u00d710 monthly\nmagazine called =The United Amateur=, which serves as the official\norgan. In this magazine may be found the complete revised list of\nmembers, the reports of officers and committees, the ample reviews\nissued by the Department of Public Criticism, a selection of the best\ncontemporary amateur literature, together with the latest news of\namateur journalists and their local clubs from all over the Anglo-Saxon\nworld. =The United Amateur= is published by an annually elected Official\nEditor, and printed by the Official Publisher. It is sent free to all\nmembers of the association.\n\n\nITS GOVERNMENT\n\n=The United Amateur Press Association= is governed by a board of\nofficers elected by popular vote. The elections take place at the annual\nconventions, where amateurs from all sections meet and fraternize. Those\nwho attend vote in person, whilst all others send in proxy ballots.\nThere is much friendly rivalry between cities concerning the selection\nof the convention seat each year. The principal elective officers of the\n=United= are the President, two Vice-Presidents, the Treasurer, the\nOfficial Editor and the three members of the Board of Directors. There\nare also a Historian, a Laureate Recorder, and two Manuscript Managers.\nAppointed by the President are the members of the two Departments of\nCriticism, the Supervisor of Amendments, the Official Publisher, and the\nSecretary of the association. All save Secretary and Official Publisher,\nserve without remuneration. The basic law of the =United= comprises an\nexcellent Constitution and By-Laws.\n\n\nITS LOCAL CLUBS\n\nThe =United= encourages the formation of local literary or press clubs\nin cities or towns containing several members. These clubs generally\npublish papers, and hold meetings wherein the pleasures of literature\nare enlivened by those of the society. The most desirable form of club\nactivity is that in which a high-school instructor forms a literary\nsociety of the more enthusiastic members of his class.\n\n\nITS PLACE IN EDUCATION\n\nDuring the past two years, as it has approached and passed its twentieth\nbirthday, the =United= has been endeavoring more strongly than ever to\nfind and occupy its true place amongst the many and varied phases of\neducation. That it discharges an unique function in literary culture is\ncertain, and its members have of late been trying very actively to\nestablish and define its relation to the high-school and the university.\nMr. Maurice Winter Moe, Instructor of English at the Appleton High\nSchool, Appleton, Wisconsin, and one of our very ablest members, took\nthe first decisive step by organizing his pupils into an amateur press\nclub, using the =United= to supplement his regular class-room work. The\nscholars were delighted, and many have acquired a love of good\nliterature which will never leave them. Three or four, in particular,\nhave become prominent in the affairs of the =United=. After\ndemonstrating the success of his innovation, Mr. Moe described it in\n=The English Journal=, his article arousing much interest in educational\ncircles, and being widely reprinted by other papers. In November, 1914,\nMr. Moe addressed an assemblage of English teachers in Chicago, and\nthere created so much enthusiasm for the =United=, that scores of\ninstructors have subsequently joined our ranks, many of them forming\nschool clubs on the model of the original club at Appleton. Here, then,\nis one definite destiny for our association: to assist the teaching of\nadvanced English in the high-school. We are especially eager for\nhigh-school material, teachers and pupils alike.\n\nBut there still remain a numerous class, who, though not connected with\nschool or college, have none the less sincere literary aspirations. At\npresent they are benefited immensely through mental contact with our\nmore polished members, yet for the future we plan still greater aids for\ntheir development, by the creation of a systematic \"Department of\nInstruction,\" which will, if successfully established, amount\npractically to a free correspondence school, and an \"Authors' Placing\nBureau,\" which will help amateurs in entering the professional field.\nOur prime endeavor is at present to secure members of high mental and\nscholastic quality, in order that the =United= may be strengthened for\nits increasing responsibility. Professors, teachers, clergymen, and\nauthors have already responded in gratifying numbers to our wholly\naltruistic plea for their presence among us. The reason for the\n=United's= success as an educational factor seems to lie principally in\nthe splendid loyalty and enthusiasm which all the members somehow\nacquire upon joining. Every individual is alert for the welfare of the\nassociation, and its activities form the subject of many of the current\nessays and editorials. The ceaseless writing in which most of the\nmembers indulge is in itself an aid to fluency, while the mutual\nexamples and criticisms help on still further the pleasantly unconscious\nacquisition of a good literary style. When regular courses of\ninstruction shall have been superimposed upon these things, the\nassociation can indeed afford to claim a place of honour in the world of\neducation.\n\n\nITS ENTRANCE CONDITIONS\n\nThe only requirement for admission to the =United= is earnest literary\naspiration. Any member will furnish the candidate for admission with an\napplication blank, signed in recommendation. This application, filled\nout and forwarded to the Secretary of the association with the sum of\nfifty cents as dues for the first year, and accompanied by a\n\"credential,\" or sample of the candidate's original literary work, will\nbe acted upon with due consideration by the proper official. No\ncandidate of real sincerity will be denied admittance, and the applicant\nwill generally be soon rewarded by his certificate of membership, signed\nby the President and Secretary. Papers, letters, and postal cards of\nwelcome will almost immediately pour in upon him, and he will in due\ntime behold his credential in print. (Unless it be something already\nprinted.) Once a member, his dues will be one dollar yearly, and if he\nshould ever leave the =United=, later desiring to join again, his\nreinstatement fee will be one dollar.\n\n\nITS REPRESENTATIVES\n\n=The United Amateur Press Association= is anything but local in its\npersonnel. Its active American membership extends from Boston to Los\nAngeles, and from Milwaukee to Tampa, thus bringing all sections in\ncontact, and representing every phase of American thought. Its English\nmembership extends as far north as Newcastle-on-Tyne. Typical papers are\npublished in England, California, Kansas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois,\nAlabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, District of Columbia, New York,\nand Rhode Island.\n\nIn writing for entrance blanks or for further information concerning the\n=United=, the applicant may address any one of the following officers,\nwho will gladly give details, and samples of amateur papers: Leo\nFritter, President, 503 Central National Bank Bldg., Columbus, Ohio;\nH. P. Lovecraft, Vice-President, 598 Angell St., Providence, R. I.; Mrs.\nJ. W. Renshaw, Second Vice-President, Coffeeville, Miss.; William J.\nDowdell, Secretary, 2428 East 66th St., Cleveland, Ohio; or Edward F.\nDaas, Official Editor, 1717 Cherry St., Milwaukee, Wis. Professional\nauthors interested in our work are recommended to communicate with the\nSecond Vice-President, while English teachers may derive expert\ninformation from Maurice W. Moe, 658 Atlantic St., Appleton, Wis.

NUMBER 3\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\nTHE BADGER for January is the first number of a strikingly meritorious\nand serious paper published by George S. Schilling. We here behold none\nof the frivolity which spoils the writings of those who view amateur\njournalism merely as a passing amusement. The Badger shows evidence of\ncareful and tasteful editorship, combined with a commendable artistic\nsense in choice of paper and cover.\n\nThe leading article, an essay on the minimum wage, is from the pen of\nthe editor, and shows both literary ability and a sound knowledge of\neconomics. \"Sister to the Ox\", by A. W. Ashby, is an excellent short\nstory whose strength is rather in its moral than in its plot. The\neditorials are certainly not lacking in force, and seem well calculated\nto stir the average amateur from his torpor of triteness and inanity.\n\nTHE INSPIRATION for November is an \"Official Number\", containing the\nwork of none but titled authors. Rheinhart Kleiner contributes the\nsingle piece of verse, a smooth and pleasing lyric entitled \"Love\nAgain\", which is not unlike his previous poem, \"Love, Come Again\". As an\namatory poet, Mr. Kleiner shows much delicacy of sentiment, refinement\nof language, and appreciation of metrical values; his efforts in this\ndirection entitle him to a high place among amateur bards.\n\nOne of the truly notable prose features of the magazine is Walter John\nHeld's delightful sketch of Joaquin Miller's home and haunts. This\nartistic picture of Californian scenery exhibits a real comprehension of\nthe beauties of Nature, and stirs to an unusual degree the imagination\nof the reader. Mr. Held's prose possesses a fluency and grace that bring\nit close to the professional quality, and its few faults are far less\nconsiderable than might be expected from the pen of a young author.\nHowever, we must remark some rather awkward examples of grammatical\nconstruction. The correct plural of \"eucalyptus\" is \"eucalypti\", without\nany final \"s\", the name being treated as a Latin noun of the second\ndeclension. \"Slowly and dignified--it pursues its way\" is hardly a\npermissible clause; the adjective \"dignified\" must be exchanged for an\nadverb. Perhaps Mr. Held sought to employ poetical enallage, but even\nso, the adjective does not correspond with \"slowly\"; besides, the use of\nenallage in prose is at best highly questionable. \"This free and rank\nflowers and brush\" is another bad clause. But it is not well to dissect\nthe sketch too minutely. A youth of Mr. Held's ability needs only time\nand continued practice to raise him to the highest rank in prose\ncomposition.\n\nINVICTUS for January, the first number of Mr. Paul J. Campbell's new\nindividual paper, is one of those rare journals concerning which it is\nalmost impossible to speak without enthusiasm. Not one of its twenty-six\npages fails to delight us. Foremost in merit, and most aptly suited to\nMr. Campbell's particular type of genius, are the three inspiring\nessays, \"The Impost of the Future\", \"The Sublime Ideal\", and \"Whom God\nHath Put Asunder\". Therein appears to great advantage the keen reasoning\nand sound materialistic philosophy of the author. \"The Sublime Ideal\" is\nespecially absorbing, tracing as it does the expansion of the human mind\nfrom a state of the narrowest and most violent bigotry to its present\nmoderate breadth.\n\nThe three pieces of verse, \"Inspiration\", \"The Larger Life\", and \"Down\nin Mexico\", are all of smooth construction and musical metre, though\nnot exhibiting their author's powers as well as his essays. \"Down in\nMexico\", a virile poem in Kipling's style, is unquestionably the best of\nthe three.\n\nMr. Campbell's comments on amateur affairs are well-written and\nentertaining, especially his reminiscent article entitled \"After Seven\nYears\".\n\nOUTWARD BOUND for January is an excellent journal edited by George\nWilliam Stokes of Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. It is gratifying to behold\nsuch a paper as this, one of the links between America and the parent\ncountry which the United is helping to forge.\n\nHerbert B. Darrow opens the issue with a short story entitled \"A\nLesson\". The tale is of conventional pattern, containing a sound though\nnot strikingly original moral. The language is generally good, except in\none sentence where the author speaks of \"the vehicles in the street and\nbuildings about him\". Surely he does not mean that the vehicles were in\nthe buildings as well as in the street. The use of the definite article\nbefore the word \"buildings\" would do much toward dispelling the\nambiguous effect.\n\n\"The Haunted Forest\", a poem by J. H. Fowler, is almost Poe-like in its\ngrimly fantastic quality. We can excuse rather indefinite metre when we\nconsider the admirably created atmosphere, the weird harmony of the\nlines, the judicious use of alliteration, and the apt selection of\nwords. \"Bird-shunned\", as applied to the thickets of the forest, is a\nparticularly graphic epithet. Mr. Fowler is to be congratulated upon his\nglowing imagination and poetical powers.\n\n\"A Bit o' Purple Heather\", by Edna von der Heide, is a delightful piece\nof verse in modified Scottish dialect, which well justifies the\ndedication of the magazine to this poetess.\n\nMr. Stokes' editorial, headed \"Ships that Pass\", sustains the nautical\natmosphere of his periodical. We wish he had given his thoughts a larger\nspace for expression.\n\nTHE PIPER for December comes as a surprise to those who have known\nRheinhart Kleiner only as a master of metre, for he is here displayed as\nthe possessor of a pure and vigorous prose style as well. In this, the\nopening number of his individual journal, Mr. Kleiner provides us with a\npleasing variety of literary matter; two serious poems, two rhymes of\nlighter character, an essay on the inevitable topic of Consolidation,\nand a brilliant collection of short editorials and criticisms.\n\n\"A Carnation\", which begins the issue, is an exquisite piece of\nsentiment couched in faultless verse. The odd measure of the poem is one\npeculiarly suited to the author's delicate type of genius; an iambic\nline of only three feet. The other lyric, \"Heart, Do Not Wake\", is\nlikewise of excellent quality, though the succession of \"again\" and\n\"pain\" in the first line might suggest to some ears an unnecessary\ninternal rhyme.\n\n\"The Rhyme of the Hapless Poet\" is very clever, and can be truly\nappreciated by every author of printed matter. Perhaps the misfortune of\nwhich the poet complains is the cause of the extra syllable in the first\nline of the second stanza; we hope that the following is what Mr.\nKleiner intended:\n\n    \"I wrote a poem, 'twas a prize\".\n\nOtherwise we are forced to believe that he pronounces \"poem\" as a\nmonosyllable, \"pome\". \"My Favorite Amateur\" is a good specimen of light,\nimitative verse.\n\nThe article on Consolidation is cynical in tone, but eminently sensible.\nIt is only too true that our greatest intellectual stimulus is found in\ncontroversy and antagonism; we are really quite bellicose in our\ninstincts, despite the utterances of the peace advocates.\n\nMr. Kleiner concludes his journal with a sparkling epigram on a rather\nobvious though regrettable tendency in amateur circles.\n\nThe Piper is in general a paper of satisfying merit, to whose future\nissues we shall look forward with eagerness.\n\nTHE RECRUITING FEMININE for 1914-1915 is a publication of unusual worth.\n\"The Rose Supreme,\" by Coralie Austin, is a delicate little poem in\nwhich we regret the presence of one inexcusably bad rhyme. To rhyme the\nwords \"rose\" and \"unclosed\" is to exceed the utmost limits of poetic\nlicense. It is true that considerable variations in vowel sounds have\nbeen permitted; \"come\" makes, or at least used to make, an allowable\nrhyme with \"home\", \"clock\" with \"look\", or \"grass\" with \"place\"; but a\nfinal consonant attached to one of two otherwise rhyming syllables\npositively destroys the rhyme.\n\nMrs. Myra Cole's essay on \"The Little Things of Life\" is well written\nand instructive.\n\n\"The Dirge of the Great Atlantic\", by Anne Vyne Tillery Renshaw, is a\ngrim and moving bit of verse, cast in the same primitively stirring\nmetre which this author used in her professionally published poem, \"The\nChant of Iron\". Mrs. Renshaw possesses an enviable power to reach the\nemotions through the medium of written words.\n\n\"Two Octobers--A Contrast\", by Eloise N. Griffith, is a meritorious\nsketch ending with the usual appeal for the cessation of the European\nwar. We fear that the author cannot quite realize the ambitious\npassions, essential ingredients of human nature, which render necessary\na final decision.\n\nMiss Edna von der Heide, in an able article, rallies to the defense of\nMr. W. E. Griffin's now famous \"Favorite Pastime\". The Modern Lothario\nis fortunate in having so competent and experienced a champion. However,\nwe cannot wholly endorse the sentiments of these excellent writers. The\nstatement that \"all amateur journalists are flirts, more or less\", is a\nbase and unwarranted libel which we are prepared completely to refute.\n\n\"The Audience\", by Mrs. Florence Shepphird, is a masterly defense of\nthose inactive amateurs whom we are all too prone to consider as\ndelinquent. It is indeed true that authors would be useless were it not\nfor some sort of a reading public.\n\nTOLEDO AMATEUR for December is a wholesome juvenile product. The\ntypography still leaves something to be desired, but the evidences of\ncare are everywhere visible, and we may reasonably expect to see it\nimprove from month to month, into one of the leading amateur papers.\nCredentials form the keynote of the current issue, and a very promising\nassortment of recruits are here introduced to the members of the United.\nMiss Sandborn, who is fortunate enough to be one of Mr. Moe's pupils at\nAppleton, contributes an interesting school anecdote, narrated in simple\nfashion. Miss Thie gives information concerning the \"Campfire Girls\".\nSome new members of adult years are also represented in this number. Mr.\nJenkins shows an admirable command of light prose, and will undoubtedly\nprove one of the United's most entertaining writers. Misses Kline and\nMcGeoch both exhibit marked poetical tendencies in prose, the latter\nwriter having something of Mr. Fritter's facility in the use of\nmetaphor. Mr. Porter's editorials are refreshingly naive and unaffected.\nHis grammar is generally good, except in the one sentence where he\nspeaks of the Toledo Times. He should say, \"the newspaper which has\ngiven me much experience, and to whose publishers I owe a great deal of\nexperience gained.\"\n\nTHE UNITED OFFICIAL QUARTERLY for November marks the beginning of a\nlaudable enterprise on the part of the official board. The magazine is\nof artistic appearance in cover, paper, and typography alike, while the\ncontents show considerable care in preparation.\n\nIra A. Cole's essay on \"The Gods of Our Fathers\" is the leading feature\nand, though not of perfect perspicuity nor faultless unity, is none the\nless noteworthy as a sincere expression of Pantheism. Mr. Cole keenly\nfeels the incongruity of our devotion to Semitic theological ideals,\nwhen as a matter of fact we are descended from Aryan polytheists, and\nhis personification of the Grecian deities in the men of today is a\npleasing and ingenious conception. We are inclined to wonder whether the\nauthor or the printer is to blame for rendering the poet Hesiod's name\nas \"Hesoid\".\n\nThe metric art is represented by three contributions. Paul J. Campbell's\nlines on \"The Heritage of Life\" are smooth in construction and proper in\nsentiment, though they are far from showing their author at his best.\nMr. Campbell is a supreme master of the philosophical essay and of\npointed, satirical prose, being a very \"Junius\" in bold, biting\ninvective; but is placed at something of a disadvantage in the domain of\nconventional poetry. Rheinhart Kleiner and ourselves revel in heroic\ncouplets of widely differing nature. Our own masterpiece is in full\nQueen Anne style with carefully balanced lines and strictly measured\nquantities. We have succeeded in producing eighteen lines without a\nsingle original sentiment or truly poetical image. Rev. Mr. Pyke, the\nobject of the verses, deserves a better encomiast. Mr. Kleiner, on the\nother hand, uses an heroic metre of that softened type which was\nevolved at the close of the eighteenth century from the disruption of\nthe more formal style. In this sort of verse the stiff, classic\nexpressions are discarded, and the sense frequently overflows from\ncouplet to couplet, giving the romantic poet a greater latitude for\nexpression than was possible in the old models. \"Vacation\" is not\ndistinguished by any strikingly novel idea, but is in general a very\nclever piece of light work. The only substantial defect is in the eighth\nline, where the word \"resort\" is so placed, that the accent must fall\nwrongfully upon the first syllable.\n\nLeo Fritter's article on criticism is timely and sensible. As he justly\ncontends, some authorized amateur critics deal far too roughly with the\nhalf-formed products of the young author, while most unofficial and\ninexperienced reviewers fairly run mad with promiscuous condemnation.\nThe fancied brilliancy of the critic is always greatest when he censures\nmost, so that the temptations of the tribe are many. We are at best but\nliterary parasites, and need now and then just such a restraining word\nas our counter-critic gives us. Mr. Fritter's style is here, as usual,\nhighly ornamented with metaphor. One slight defect strikes the\nfastidious eye, but since split infinitives are becoming so common in\nthese days, we shall attend the author's plea for gentleness, and remain\nsilent.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                             Chairman, Department of Public Criticism.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MARCH 1915\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\nTHE BLARNEY STONE for November-December is dedicated to its contributors\nand wholly given over to their work. \"Did You Ever Go A-Fishin'?,\" by\nOlive G. Owen, is a vivid poetical portrayal of that peculiar attraction\nwhich the angler's art exerts on its devotees. While the whole is of\nhigh and pleasing quality, exception must be taken to the rhyming of\n\"low\" with itself at the very beginning of the poem. It may be that the\nsecond \"low\" is a misprint for \"slow\", yet even in that case, the rhyme\nis scarcely allowable, since the dominant rhyming sound would still be\n\"low\". Miss Edna von der Heide, in \"The Christmas of Delsato's Maria\",\ntells how an Italian thief utilized his questionable art to replace a\nloss in his family. \"To General Villa\" is a peculiar piece of verse\nwritten last summer for the purpose of defying those who had charged its\nauthor with pedantry and pomposity. It has suffered somewhat at the\nhands of the printer; \"Intrepido\" being spelled \"Intrepedo\", and the\nword \"own\" being dropped from the clause \"your own name can't write\" in\nthe third line of the second stanza. Also, the first of the Spanish\ndouble exclamation marks around the oath \"Santa Maria\" is right side up\ninstead of inverted according to Castilian custom. Having been hastily\nwritten, the piece is wholly without merit. \"Senor\", in the second line\nof the third stanza is placed so that the accent must fall erroneously\non the first syllable. The changes of time and revolutions have rendered\nthe last stanza sadly out of date.\n\nThe issue is concluded with a beautiful editorial on \"The Service With\nLove\", wherein is described the ideal spirit of brotherhood which should\npervade amateur journalism. We regret the two blank pages at the back of\nthe magazine, and wish that some talented Blarney had seen fit to adorn\nthem with his work.\n\nTHE BROOKLYNITE for January is of unusual merit, fairly teeming with\nfeatures of a well-written and substantial character.\n\nThe short story by Mrs. Carson is developed with admirable simplicity\nand ease; the plot not too strained, and the moral not too pragmatically\nforced upon the reader. The conversation, always a difficult point with\namateur authors, is surprisingly natural.\n\nMrs. Adams' essay on ghosts displays considerable literary knowledge,\nthough the anecdote at the end is rather ancient for use today. We last\nheard it about ten years ago, with a Scotchman instead of a negro\npreacher as the narrator, and with the word \"miracle\" instead of\n\"phenomena\" as the subject.\n\nMr. Goodwin's \"Cinigrams\" are delightful, and we expect soon to hear the\nauthor heralded as the Martial of amateur journalism. \"Ford, Do Not\nShake\", Mr. Goodwin's parody on Kleiner's \"Heart, Do Not Wake\", is\nactually side-splitting. The metre is handled to perfection, and the\nhumor is extremely clever.\n\n\"Consolidation\", by George Julian Houtain, is a fair example of the\nmanner in which some of the less dignified National politicians try to\ncast silly aspersions on the United. The elaborately sarcastic phrase:\n\"United boys and girls\", seems to please its author, since he uses it\ntwice. There is unconscious irony in the spectacle of a National man,\nonce a member of the notorious old Gotham ring, preaching virtuously\nagainst the \"unenviable record\" of the United.\n\nMr. Stoddard's brief essay, composed at a meeting of the Blue Pencil\nClub, is excellent, and his concluding quatrain regular and melodious.\nWe wish, however, that he would give us some more of the serious fiction\nthat he can write so splendidly, and which used several years ago to\nappear in the amateur press.\n\n\"Music Moods\", by Charles D. Isaacson, is an emotional sketch of great\npower and delicate artistry. Mr. Isaacson has an active imagination and\na literary ability which makes his readers see very vividly the images\nhe creates.\n\nMrs. Houtain's poem shows great but as yet undeveloped talent. The\nrepeated use of the expletive \"do\" in such phrases as \"I do sigh\", or \"I\npray and do pine\", mars the verse somewhat. As Pope remarked and\nhumorously illustrated in his Essay on Criticism:\n\n    \"Expletives their feeble aid DO join.\"\n\nMr. Ayres' jocose epic is clever and tuneful. The climax, or rather\nanticlimax, comes quite effectively.\n\nMr. Adams, in his brilliant verses entitled \"Gentlemen, Please Desist\",\nexposes in a masterly way the fatuity of our loud-mouthed peace workers.\nMiss Silverman's lines on the same subject are very good, but scarcely\nequal in keenness of wit. It is all very well to \"keep industry\nbooming\", but industry cannot take the place of military efficiency in\nprotecting a nation against foreign aggression.\n\nAs a whole, the January Brooklynite is the best number we have yet seen.\n\nTHE COYOTE for March is not a revival of Ex-President Brechler's\nwell-known amateur journal of that name, but a semi-professional leaflet\nedited by Mr. William T. Harrington, a rather new recruit. The leading\nfeature is a sensational short story by the editor, entitled \"What\nGambling Did\". In this tale, Mr. Harrington exhibits at least a strong\nambition to write, and such energy, if well directed, may eventually\nmake of him one of our leading authors of fiction. Just now, however, we\nmust protest against his taste in subject and technique. His models are\nobviously not of the classical order, and his ideas of probability are\nfar from unexceptionable. In developing the power of narration, it is\ngenerally best, as one of our leading amateurs lately reiterated, to\ndiscard the thought of elaborate plots and thrilling climaxes, and to\nbegin instead with the plain and simple description of actual incidents\nwith which the author is familiar. Likewise, the young author may avoid\nimprobability by composing his earliest efforts in the first person. He\nknows what he himself would do in certain circumstances, but he does not\nalways know very exactly what some others might do in similar cases.\nMeanwhile, above all things he should read classic fiction, abstaining\nentirely from \"Wild West Weeklies\" and the like. Mr. Harrington has a\ntaste for excitement, and would probably thrive on Scott, Cooper, or\nPoe. Let him read the Leather Stocking Tales if he loves pioneers and\nfrontier life. Not until after he has acquired a familiarity with the\nmethods of the best authors, and refined his imagination by a perusal of\ntheir works, should he make attempts at writing outside his own\nexperience. He will then be able to produce work of a quality which\nwould surprise him now.\n\nWe are sorry to note that the Coyote's editorial columns are occupied by\na mere condensed copy of the United's standard recruiting circular. This\nspace might have been filled much more profitably with brief original\ncomments by the editor on the numerous exchanges which are listed in\nanother part of his paper. The paid advertising and subscription price\nare not to be commended. Such things have no place in a truly amateur\npaper. But continued membership in the United will doubtless fill Mr.\nHarrington with the genuine amateur spirit, and cause The Coyote to\nbecome a worthy successor to its older namesake.\n\nDOWDELL'S BEARCAT for October is a modest but very promising little\npaper, mostly composed of amateur notes and brief reviews. The editor\nhas interest in his work, and fluency in his language, foundations on\nwhich a more elaborate structure may some day be erected. One feature\nopen to criticism is Mr. Dowdell's sudden change in his editorial column\nfrom the usual first person plural to the third person singular. It\nwould be better to save \"The Old Bear\" and his interesting chat, for a\nseparate column. The typography of Dowdell's Bearcat is not perfect, but\nmay be expected to improve from issue to issue.\n\nTHE EMISSARY for July is a National paper, but contains the work of\nseveral United members. Of the publication itself we need not stop to\nspeak. Mr. Reading, though only eighteen years of age, is an editor and\nprinter of the highest grade, and has produced an issue which will be\nlong remembered in the amateur world.\n\n\"Ausonius, the Nature-Lover\", by Edward H. Cole, is a pleasing and\njudicious appreciation of a later Latin poet, showing how a bard of the\ndecaying Roman Empire approached in certain passages the spirit of\nmodern romanticism. Mr. Cole's translated extracts are beautifully\nphrased, and his comment upon the subject well exhibits his wide and\ncareful scholarship. Articles of this quality are rarely found in the\namateur press, and it will be interesting to note what effect their more\nfrequent appearance would have upon the literary tone of the\nassociations.\n\n\"To Sappho\", by Olive G. Owen, is a lyrical poem of much merit, yet\nhaving a defective line. Why, we wonder, did the author see fit to leave\ntwo necessary syllables out of the third line of the opening verse?\n\n\"Lamb o' Mine\", by Dora M. Hepner, is probably the most attractive bit\nof verse in the magazine. The negro dialect is inimitable, and the\nconsoling spirit of the old black \"mammy\" fairly radiates from the\nlines. Metrically, the piece is faultless, and we wish its author were a\nmore frequent contributor to the amateur journals.\n\nMiss von der Heide's two poems, \"The Mill Mother\", and \"Greeting\",\nexpress admirably the sentiments of pathos and natural beauty,\nrespectively. Personally, we prefer \"Greeting\".\n\nMr. Campbell's lines on \"Huerta's Finish\" are distinctly below the usual\nstandard of this talented writer's work. The metre is satisfactory, but\nthe humor is somewhat strained, and the pun in the last line based on a\nmispronunciation of the old Indian's name. \"Wehr-ta\" is probably the\ncorrect sound, rather than \"Hurt-a\".\n\nTHE INSPIRATION for January must be judged strictly by its quality; not\nits quantity. Pinkney C. Grissom, a very young amateur, cheers us\ngreatly with his article on \"Smiles\", while Miss von der Heide's\nmicroscopic story, \"A Real Victory\", is indeed a literary treat. We\ntrust that the editor's threat of discontinuance may not be realized.\n\nTHE KANSAN for July reaches us at a late date through the kindness of\nMr. Daas. In this magazine the Sunflower Club of Bazine makes its formal\ndebut, being ushered into amateur society by means of a pleasing and\nwell-written article from the pen of Miss Hoffman. The informal\n\"Exchange Comment\" is a charitable and generally delightful department,\nwhose anonymity we rather regret. The Editorial pages are brilliant in\ntheir justification of the United's sunny spirit, as contrasted with the\nNational's forbidding frigidity.\n\nTHE OLYMPIAN for September-February well sustains the lofty traditions\nof that magazine. Mr. Cole defines with considerable precision his\nlatest editorial policy and his true attitude toward the United,\nrevealing only the more strongly, however, his remarkable and\nineradicable prejudice against our association in favor of the National.\n\"Evening Prayer\", by Rheinhart Kleiner, is a poem of great beauty and\nreal worth, couched in the alternating iambic pentameter and trimeter\nwhich this poet seems to have made his own particular medium of\nexpression. Mr. Kleiner is rapidly assuming a very high rank among\namateur poets.\n\n\"The Public Library\", by Eloise N. Griffith, is a delightful and\nappreciative reminiscence of quiet hours of lettered joy.\n\n\"The Play Hour\", consisting of two clever bits of metre dedicated to a\nvery young amateur, appears in a collection of short and sprightly\npieces signed by the Senior Editor himself. It is difficult,\nnevertheless, to imagine the dignified Olympian Zeus as the author.\nThough the second of these tuneful rhymes is apparently written in the\n\"simplified\" spelling now so popular among certain amateur editors, a\ncloser inspection reveals the fact that the spelling is merely made\njuvenile to suit the subject. After all, however, simplified spelling\nand baby-talk are but little removed from each other. The Reviewers'\nClub is in this issue represented by both editors, whose criticisms are\nas usual just and illuminating.\n\nPROMETHEUS for September-November is a journal of unusual literary and\nartistic value, edited by our poet-laureate, Miss Olive G. Owen. The\npaper well lives up to its sub-title, \"A Magazine of Aspirations Dreamed\ninto Reality\". Mr. William H. Greenfield, the honored founder of the\nUnited, claims the first page with a graceful Pindaric ode, \"To My\nFriend\". \"The Weaver of Dreams\", by Edna G. Thorne, is a strikingly\nwell-written short story pervaded with a delicate pathos and expressing\na beautiful Christian philosophy. George W. Macauley, continuing to\nconcentrate his narrative powers on the Oriental tale, presents a\npleasing fable of old Moorish Spain, entitled \"Ali Ahmed and the\nAqueduct\". \"The Ethics of Stimulation\", by Maurice W. Moe, is an\neminently sound exposition of the relative evil of coffee and alcoholic\nliquor as stimulants. \"Partners\", by H. A. Reading, exhibits great\nability on the part of its author, and is well calculated to arouse the\nemotions of affectionate fathers and sons.\n\nMiss Owen's work, scattered here and there throughout the magazine, is\nnaturally of the very first quality. It is hard to choose between the\ntwo poems \"Atthis, I Love Thee\", and \"To Elizabeth Knopf\", but we\nincline slightly toward the former. The sketches \"The Visitor\" and \"Some\nThings I Like in New York\" are both delightful in their artistic\nsimplicity.\n\nCritically analyzed, Prometheus may be classed as one of the most varied\nand generally readable magazines of the season.\n\nRED LETTER DAYS for October is the first of an informal individual paper\nby George W. Macauley, representing the most purely personal phase of\namateur journalism. This issue is almost completely devoted to an\nanimated account of the \"Red Letter Days\" spent by Mr. Macauley last\nsummer with the amateurs who stopped to see him while on their way to\nthe various conventions. The author's style is familiar and pleasing,\nthough rather careless, and slightly marred by defects in spelling and\ngrammar. For instance, we are told of the caution which he and Mr.\nStoddard exercised in changing seats in a boat, since neither \"could\nswim, had the boat DID the usual thing.\" We are sorry that Mr. Macauley\nhas adopted \"simplified\" spelling, but it is an evil in which he is by\nno means alone.\n\nRed Letter Days, broadly considered, is a highly commendable paper; its\nsimplicity and lack of affectation are alone sufficient to win general\napproval.\n\nSTRAY LEAVES for May-June is another paper which has arrived late and\nindirectly. In this publication we note with disapproval some evidence\nof pseudo-professionalism, such as a subscription rate and\nadvertisements, but we trust that Miss Draper will ere long acquire the\nperfect amateur spirit. \"Love Proved To Be the Master of Hate\", a short\nstory by Frances Wood, is handicapped by its unwieldy title. \"The\nTriumph of Love\", or some heading of equal brevity, would better suit\nit. Indications of immaturity are here and there perceptible, and at the\nvery beginning there is an inexplicable mass of hyphenation. However,\nthe tale is undeniably of considerable merit, conveying a pleasing\npicture of jealousy overcome.\n\nThe Editorial department might be improved by a judicious copying of the\nbest amateur models. The reference to anti-Suffrage and Suffrage as \"two\nvital questions\" is hardly permissible; these are the two sides of only\none question.\n\n\"Thinkers\", by G. D., is really excellent as an essay, despite the\nawkwardness of style.\n\nThe Bermuda letter is highly interesting in its descriptions, but\npainfully unscholarly in its phraseology. We here behold a case of real\ntalent obscured by want of literary polish, and hope that F. A. B.,\nwhoever he or she may be, will profit by his or her connection with the\nUnited.\n\nStray Leaves has great possibilities, and will doubtless prove one of\nthe leading papers of amateur journalism in times to come.\n\nTHE UNITED OFFICIAL QUARTERLY for January hardly lives up to the\nartistic standard set by the first number, though it contains much\nvaluable matter. Herbert B. Darrow pleads very ably for the personal\nacknowledgement of amateur papers received, while Paul J. Campbell\nwrites convincingly on the true value of amateur journalism. Pres.\nHepner, in the concluding article, opposes with considerable vigor the\nHoffman policy of issuing co-operative magazines. We are not, however,\ninclined entirely to agree with our executive's conclusions. The\nco-operative journal is practically the only adequate medium of\nexpression for the amateur of limited means, and most of the later\njournals of this class, of which the Official Quarterly is itself an\nexample, have been of excellent quality. It is perhaps too much to\nexpect the average President, encumbered with a host of other duties, to\nconduct this work, but in any event some suitable official should be\ndelegated for that purpose. The association should not lightly abandon a\npolicy which made the preceding administration one of the most brilliant\nand successful in years.\n\nTHE WOODBEE for January exhibits amateur journalism at its best. Mrs.\nAnne Tillery Renshaw opens the magazine with a pleasing poem, dedicated\nto the Woodbees, which combines simplicity of diction with regularity of\nmetre. Those decasyllabic quatrains are a decided departure from Mrs.\nRenshaw's usual style, which explains the slight lack of fluency. The\nlast line of the third stanza contains a redundant syllable, a defect\nwhich might be corrected by the removal of the article before the word\n\"louder\", or by the poetical contraction of \"sympathy\" into \"symp'thy\".\nThe third line of the fourth stanza possesses only four feet. This may\nbe an intentional shortening to give rhetorical effect, yet it mars none\nthe less the symmetry of the verse.\n\n\"The Spiritual Significance of the Stars\", by Leo Fritter, is the\nleading feature of the issue. The inspiring influence of astronomical\nstudy on the cultivated intellect is here shown to best advantage. Mr.\nFritter traces the slow unfolding of celestial knowledge to the world,\nand points out the divinity of that mental power which enables man to\ndiscern the vastness of the universe, and to comprehend the complex\nprinciples by which it is governed. In the laws of the heavens he finds\nthe prototype of all human laws, and the one perfect model for human\ninstitutions. Mr. Fritter's essay is eminently worthy of a place among\nthe classics of amateur journalism.\n\n\"A Morn in June\", by Harriet E. Daily, is a short and dainty poem of\nexcellent quality, though marred by a reprehensible attempt to rhyme\n\"grass\" with \"task\". As we mentioned in connection with another amateur\npoem, a final consonant on one of two otherwise rhyming syllables\nutterly destroys the rhyme. \"We Are Builders All\", by Elizabeth M.\nBallou, is a graceful allegory based on the temple of Solomon. Edna\nMitchell Haughton's character sketch, \"The Family Doctor\", is just and\nwell drawn.\n\n\"A Dog for Comfort\", by Edna von der Heide, is a meritorious poem of\ngloomy impressiveness. We cannot quite account for the defective second\nline of the fourth stanza, since Miss von der Heide is so able a\npoetess. Perhaps it is intentional, but we wish the line were of normal\ndecasyllabic length. \"My Grandmother's Garden\", by Ida Cochran Haughton,\nis a truly delightful bit of reminiscent description which deserves more\nthan one reading. \"A Little Girl's Three Wishes\", by Mrs. R. M. Moody,\nis entertaining in quality and correct in metre. It is a relief to\nbehold amidst the formless cacophony of modern poetry such a regular,\nold-fashioned specimen of the octosyllabic couplet. \"Two Little\nWaterwheels\", by Dora M. Hepner, is an exquisite idyllic sketch. In the\nsecond paragraph we read of a channel \"damned\" up by a projecting root\nof a tree; which somewhat surprises us, since we did not know that\ntree-roots are accustomed to use profane language. Perhaps the author\nintended to write \"dammed\".\n\nThe editorials are brief. In one of them it is stated that the paper is\nsubmitted without fear to the critics AND Eddie Cole. In view of Mr.\nCole's scholarly and conscientious critical work, we hope that no\nreflection upon him is there intended.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                             Chairman, Department of Public Criticism.\n\n\nMARCH\n\n    Let other bards with nobler talents sing\n    The beauties of the mild, maturer spring.\n    My rustic Muse on bleaker times must dwell,\n    When Earth, but new-escap'd from winter's spell,\n    Uncloth'd, unshelter'd, unadorn'd, is seen;\n    Stript of white robes, nor yet array'd in green.\n    Hard blows the breeze, but with a warmer force.\n    The melting ground, the brimming watercourse,\n    The wak'ning air, the birds' returning flight,\n    The longer sunshine, and the shorter night,\n    Arcturus' beams, and Corvus' glitt'ring rays,\n    Diffuse a promise of the genial days.\n    Yon muddy remnant of the winter snow\n    Shrinks humbly in the equinoctial glow,\n    Whilst in the fields precocious grass-blades peep\n    Above the earth so lately wrapt in sleep.\n    What sweet, elusive odor fills the soil,\n    To rouse the farmer to his yearly toil!\n    Though thick the clouds, and bare the maple bough,\n    With what gay song he guides the cumbrous plough!\n    In him there stirs, like sap within the tree,\n    The joyous call to new activity:\n    The outward scene, however dull and drear,\n    Takes on a splendor from the inward cheer.\n    Prophetic month! Would that I might rehearse\n    Thy hidden beauties in sublimer verse:\n    Thy glorious youth, thy vigor all unspent,\n    Thy stirring winds, of spring and winter blent.\n    Summer brings blessings of enervate kind;\n    Thy joys, O March, are ecstasies of mind.\n    In June we revel in the bees' soft hum,\n    But March exalts us with the bliss to come.\n\n                                --H. P. LOVECRAFT.\n\n\n\n\n                        THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA\n\n VOLUME XIV         GEORGETOWN, ILL., MAY, 1915.          NUMBER 5\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\nTHE BLARNEY STONE for January-February is replete with good literature,\namidst which may particularly be mentioned Arthur Goodenough's\nharmonious poem, \"God Made Us All of Clay\". The theme is not new, but\nappears advantageously under Mr. Goodenough's delicate treatment.\n\nM. W. Hart's short story, \"The Redemption\", is intended to portray a\nrighteous transformation from conventional false morality to true\nChristian life, but in reality presents a very repulsive picture of\nbestial atavism. The meaner character was not \"reformed by mercy\", but\nmerely withheld from wholesale vice by isolation. Mr. Hart is so plainly\nin earnest when he relates this dismal tale as a sermon, that we must\nnot be too harsh in questioning his taste or condemning his free\nstandards of civilized morality; yet we doubt seriously if stories or\nessays of this type should appear in the press, and especially in the\namateur press. Two or three technical points demand attention. The word\n\"diversified\" on page 2 might better be \"diverse\", while \"environment\"\non page 4, could well be replaced by \"condition\" or \"state\". On page 5\noccurs the sentence \"All intelligence ... were ... instinct\". Obviously\nthe verb should be in the singular number to correspond with its\nsubject. Mr. Hart is developing a prose style of commendable dignity,\nunusually free from the jarring touch of modern frivolity.\n\nH. B. Scott is proving himself a finished scholar and a thoughtful\neditor in his conduct of The Blarney Stone; his able essay on\n\"Personality\" is eminently worthy of more than one perusal.\n\nTHE BOYS' HERALD for May presents us with a highly interesting account\nof Robert Louis Stevenson's career as an amateur journalist, together\nwith a facsimile reproduction of the cover of \"The Sunbeam Magazine\",\nStevenson's hand-written periodical. The column of reminiscences,\ncontaining letters from various old-time amateurs, is extremely\ninspiring to the younger members, showing how persistently the amateur\nspirit adheres to all who have truly acquired it. \"Nita at the Passing\nShow\" is a witty and entertaining parody by Mr. Smith, illustrating the\ntheatrical hobby of Miss Gerner; one of the latest United recruits. The\nBoys' Herald discharges a peculiar and important function in the life of\nthe associations, connecting the present with the past, and furnishing\nus with just standards for comparison.\n\nDOWDELL'S BEARCAT for December opens with a Christmas poem of great\nbeauty and harmonious construction from the pen of Dora M. Hepner. The\nthoughts and images are without exception lofty and well selected, and\nthe only possible defect is the attempt to rhyme \"come\" with \"run\" in\nthe last stanza. Edward H. Cole's review of a recent booklet in memory\nof Miss Susan Brown Robbins, a former amateur, is more than a criticism.\nIt is a rare appreciation of the bonds of mutual esteem and respect\nwhich grow up amongst the congenial members of the press associations.\nMr. Cole is peculiarly well fitted to deal with his subject, and no\npraise is needed beyond the statement that the review is characteristic\nof him.\n\nDOWDELL'S BEARCAT for January marks the metamorphosis of that periodical\ninto a newspaper. With youthful ambition, Mr. Dowdell is resolved to\nfurnish the United with the latest items of interest concerning\namateurs. While the general style of the paper is fluent and pleasing,\nwe believe that \"Bruno\" might gain much force of expression through the\nexercise of a little more care and dignity in his prose. For instance,\nmany colloquial contractions like \"don't\", \"won't\", or \"can't\" might be\neliminated, while such slang phrases as \"neck of the woods\", \"make\ngood\", \"somewhat off\", or \"bunch of yellow-backs\" were better omitted.\n\nDOWDELL'S BEARCAT for March is notable for an increase in size. \"A Visit\nto Niagara Falls\", by Andrew R. Koller, is an intelligent and animated\npiece of description, which promises well for the development of its\nauthor. What looseness of construction exists may be charged to youth.\n\"An Ambition and a Vision\", by Nettie A. Hartman, is a neat and\ngrammatically written little sketch, probably autobiographical,\ndescribing the evolution of an amateur. Greater cultivation of\nrhetorical taste would improve Miss Hartman's style, and we are certain\nthat it possesses a fundamental merit which will make improvement an\neasy matter. With the usual regret we observe an instance of \"simple\nspelling\", which Mr. Dowdell, who does not fall into this vice himself,\nhas evidently overlooked in editing. The news items this month are\ntimely and vivacious, exhibiting \"Bruno\" at his best.\n\nTHE LAKE BREEZE for March inaugurates a very welcome revival of the\nUnited's foremost news sheet, now to be issued monthly. Mr. Daas is so\nactive an amateur, and so closely connected with the development of the\nassociation, that his ably edited journal has almost the authority of an\nofficial organ.\n\nThe editorial entitled \"Ashes and Roses\" is a powerful and convincing\nreply to a rather weak attack lately made on the United by a member of a\nless active association. Mr. Daas uses both sense and sarcasm to great\nadvantage, leaving but little ground for his opponent to occupy.\n\n\"The Amateur Press\" is a well conducted column of contributed reviews,\namong which Mrs. A. M. Adams' eulogy of Mrs. Griffith's essay in Outward\nBound is perhaps the best. \"What is Amateur Journalism?\", by \"El\nImparcial\", is a sketch of the various types of amateurs, with a\nsuggestion of the ideal type. While free from glaring defects, the essay\ngives no really new information, and brings out no strikingly original\nideas. \"Some Objections to Moving Pictures\", by Edmund L. Shehan,\npresents a strong array of evidence against one of the most popular and\ninstructive amusements of today. We do not believe, however, that the\nobjections here offered are vital. The moving picture has infinite\npossibilities for literary and artistic good when rightly presented, and\nhaving achieved a permanent place, seems destined eventually to convey\nthe liberal arts to multitudes hitherto denied their enjoyment. Mr.\nShehan's prose style is clear and forceful, capable of highly\nadvantageous development.\n\nLITERARY BUDS for April is the first number of a paper issued by the new\nAthenaeum Club of Journalism, Harvey, Ill. Though the text of most of\nthe contributions has suffered somewhat through a slight misapprehension\nconcerning the editing, the issue is nevertheless pleasing and\ncreditable.\n\n\"A la Rudyard\", a poem by George A. Bradley, heads the contents. While\nhampered by some of the heaviness natural to authors of school age, Mr.\nBradley has managed to put into his lines a laudable enthusiasm and\ngenuine warmth. The editorial column is well conducted, the second item\nbeing especially graphic, though the \"superdreadnought\" metaphor seems\nrather forced. Clara Inglis Stalker, the enthusiastic and capable\neducator through whose efforts the club was formed, gives a brief\naccount of her organization, under the title \"The History of an\nEight-Week-Old\", and in a prose style of uniformly flowing and\nattractive quality. \"A Love Song\", Miss Stalker's other contribution, is\na poem of delicate imagery and unusual metre. \"Our Paring Knife\", by\nGertrude Van Lanningham, is a short sketch with an aphorism at the end.\nThough this type of moral lesson is a little trite, Miss Van Lanningham\nshows no mean appreciation of literary form, and will, when she has\nemerged from the \"bud\" stage, undoubtedly blossom into a graphic and\nsympathetic writer. \"Co-Education\", by Caryl W. Dempsey, is an\ninteresting but only partially convincing article on a topic of\nconsiderable importance. The author, being enthusiastically in favor of\nthe practice, enumerates its many benefits; yet the arguments are\ndecidedly biased. While the advantage of co-education to young ladies\nis made quite obvious, it remains far from clear that young men receive\nequal benefit. A desirable decline of cliques and hazing might, it is\ntrue, result from the admission of women to men's universities, but the\nyoung men would undoubtedly lose much in earnest, concentrated energy\nand dignified virility through the presence of the fair. The experiment,\nradical at best, has failed more than once. The style of this essay is\nslightly wanting in ease and continuity, yet possesses the elements of\nforce. \"The Traitor\", by Agnes E. Fairfield, is a short story of\nartistic development but questionable sentiment. The present fad of\npeace-preaching should not be allowed to influence a writer of sense\ninto glorifying a socialistic, unpatriotic fanatic who refuses to uphold\nthe institutions that his fathers before him created with their toil,\nblood, and sacrifice. It is not the right of the individual to judge of\nthe necessity of a war; no layman can form an intelligent idea of the\ndangers that may beset his fatherland. The man is but a part of the\nstate, and must uphold it at any cost. We are inclined to wonder at Miss\nFairfield's mention of a king, when the name Phillipe La Roque so\nclearly proclaims the hero a Frenchman. France, be it known, has been a\nrepublic for some little time. \"Penny in the Slot\", by Vaughn Flannery,\npossesses a humor that is pleasing and apparently quite spontaneous. We\nshould like to behold more of Mr. Flannery's efforts in this field.\n\nViewed in its entirety, allowance being made for its present essentially\njuvenile nature, Literary Buds may be regarded as a pronounced success.\nThat it will mature in consonance with the club which it represents is\ncertain, and each future issue can be relied upon to surpass its\npredecessor.\n\nOLE MISS' for March, edited by Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Renshaw, easily falls\ninto the very front rank of the season's amateur journals. In this\nnumber Mr. Joseph W. Renshaw makes his initial appearance before the\nmembers of the United, producing a very favorable impression with his\npure, attractive prose. The introduction, credited in another column to\nMr. Renshaw, is of graceful and pleasing character, recalling the\nelusively beautiful atmosphere of the Old South which is too soon\npassing away.\n\n\"The Humble Swallow\", an anonymous essay, praises with singularly\ndelicate art a feathered creature whose charms lie not on the surface.\nThe concluding paragraph, condemning the wanton slaughter of this winged\nfriend to mankind, is especially apt at a time of hysterical peace\nagitation. While the well meaning advocates of peace call wildly upon\nmen to abandon just warfare against destructive and malignant enemies,\nthey generally pass over without thought or reproof the wholesale murder\nof these innocent little birds, who never did nor intended harm to\nanyone. \"A Higher Recruiting Standard\", by Mrs. Renshaw, is an able\nexposition of the newer and loftier type of ideals prevailing in the\nUnited. Our association has never lacked numbers, but would undoubtedly\nbe the better for an increased standard of scholarship such as is here\ndemanded. Mrs. Renshaw's work as a recruiter is in keeping with her\npolicy, and this, together with Mr. Moe's work amongst the English\nteachers, seems destined to raise the United far above its lesser\ncontemporaries. \"An A. J. Suggestion\", by Mr. Renshaw, deals ingeniously\nand logically with the always difficult problem of selecting a printer.\nThough evidently written quite independently, it ably seconds Paul J.\nCampbell's original suggestion in the UNITED AMATEUR. The advantages of\nhaving one printer for all amateur work are many, and the well presented\nopinions of Mr. Renshaw should aid much in securing this desirable\ninnovation.\n\nThe poetry in Ole Miss' is all by Mrs. Renshaw, and therefore of first\nquality. \"Some One I Know\" is a lightly amatory piece of tuneful rhythm.\n\"Night of Rain\" gives a peculiarly pleasing aspect to a type of scene\nnot usually celebrated in verse. The only jarring note is the rather\nmundane metaphor which compares the trees to a \"beautiful mop\". Though\nMrs. Renshaw holds unusual ideas regarding the use of art in poetry, we\ncontend that this instance of rhetorical frigidity is scarcely\npermissible. It is too much like Sir Richard Blackmore's description of\nMount Aetna, wherein he compares a volcanic eruption to a fit of colic;\nor old Ben Johnson's battle scene in the fifth act of \"Catiline\", where\nhe represents the sun perspiring. \"Man of the Everyday\" is a noble\npanegyric on the solid, constructive virtues of the ordinary citizen,\nportraying very graphically the need of his presence in a world that\nheeds him but little.\n\nConsidered in all its aspects, Ole Miss' is a notable contribution to\namateur literature, and one which we hope to see oft repeated.\n\nTHE PASSING SHOW for February is the \"second annual production\" of an\nexcellent though informal little paper by Nita Edna Gerner, a new member\nof the United, and the daughter of an old-time amateur. Miss Gerner is\nan enthusiast on all matters pertaining to the theatre, and has\nimpressed her hobby very strongly on the pages of her publication.\n\nThe dominant theme of the current issue is that of amateur romance,\nexhibiting the press associations in the role of matrimonial agencies.\n\"The Twos-ers\", by Edwin Hadley Smith, is a long list of couples who\nbecame wedded through acquaintanceships formed in amateur journalism.\nThis catalogue, recording 26 marriages and engagements from the\nearliest ages to the present, must have cost its author much time and\nresearch. \"A Romance of Amateur Journalism\", by Edward F. Daas, is a\nvery brief statement of facts in unornamented style. \"An 'Interstate'\nRomance\", by Leston M. Ayres, is more elaborate in treatment, and\ndisplays an easy, colloquial style.\n\nThe editorial column, headed \"Through the Opera-Glasses\", is bright and\ninformal. We note with regret that Miss Gerner has seen fit to adopt the\npopular mutilated orthography of the day, a fad which we trust she will\ndiscard in time.\n\nPEARSON'S PET for April is a bright and attractive little paper\nthroughout. \"Burnin' Off\" is a delightful specimen of dialect verse\nwhich conveys a graphic image. We have never witnessed such an\nagricultural function as Mr. Pearson describes, but can gain from his\nclever lines a vivid idea of its weird impressiveness. \"How I Met Elbert\nHubbard\" is narrated in commendably easy prose, which same may be said\nof the sketch or editorial entitled \"Broke Loose Again\". Mr. Pearson is\nassuredly a competent exponent of amateur journalism's lighter and less\nformal side.\n\nTHE PIPER for May is as pleasing and meritorious as the first number,\nboth in its verse and its prose. \"The Modern Muse\", exhibiting Mr.\nKleiner in a somewhat humorous mood, is very forceful in its satire on\nthe altered ideals of the poetical fraternity, but is marred by the\nnoticeably imperfect rhyming of \"garret\" and \"carrot\", it is barely\npossible that according to the prevailing New York pronunciation this\nrhyme is not so forced as it appears, but we are of New England, and\naccustomed to hearing the sounds more classically differentiated. The\ndefect is trivial at most, and mentioned here only because Mr. Kleiner\nprofesses such a rigid adherence to the law of perfect rhyming. \"The\nBooks I Used to Read\" is the most delightful appreciation of juvenile\nliterature that has appeared in amateur journalism within our memory.\nThere are few of us in whom this poem will fail to arouse glad\nreminiscences. \"Spring\" is a pleasing poem on a subject which though not\nexactly new, is nevertheless susceptible to an infinite variety of\ntreatment. The four stanzas are highly creditable, both sentimentally\nand metrically. Apart from the poetry, criticism seems the dominant\nelement in The Piper, and it would be difficult indeed to find a more\nlucid and discerning series of reviews. Mr. Kleiner's unvarying advocacy\nof correct metre and perfect rhyming is refreshing to encounter in this\nage of laxity and license. Perhaps he is a little stern in his\ncondemnation of the \"allowable\" rhymes of other days, especially in view\nof his recent \"garret-carrot\" attempt, yet we admit that there is much\nto be said in favor of his attitude.\n\nTHE PLAINSMAN for February contains a gruesome moral tale by Ricardo\nSantiago, entitled \"The Bell of Huesca\". It is proper to remark here,\nthat an important sentence was omitted at the top of page 3. The passage\nshould read \"'Sire, thy bell has no clapper!' 'Thy head shall be the\nclapper'; said the king, and he sent him to the block\" etc. Whatever may\nbe said of the aptness of the allegory, it is evident that Mr. Santiago\npossesses the foundations of a pure and forcible prose style, and a\ncommendable sense of unity in narration and development of climax. This\nstory is undoubtedly worthy of its distinction as winner in The\nPlainsman's post-card contest.\n\nTHE SPECTATOR for June-July, 1914, though somewhat trite in title, is\nthe first number of a magazine notable for its quality. Walter John Held\nis without doubt one of the most enterprising youths who have ever\njoined the ranks of the association, though his views on paid\nsubscriptions and advertisements show his still imperfect acquisition of\nthe true amateur spirit. Mr. Held mistakes commercial progress for\nartistic development, believing that the aim of every amateur in his\nascent toward professional authorship is to write remunerative matter.\nHe therefore considers a publisher's advancement to be best shown in\nability to extract an odd penny now and then from a few subscribers who\nreally subscribe only out of courtesy. We wish that Mr. Held might come\nto consider amateur journalism in its higher aspects; as a medium for\nimprovement in literature and taste; an aid to the cultivation of the\nart for its own sake in the manner of gentlemen, not of cheap tradesmen.\nThe selection of commercial prosperity as a goal will ruin any true\nliterary progress, and dull the artistic aspiration of the student as\nsoon as his mercenary instincts shall have been satisfied. Besides,\nthere is really no sound business principle in the so-called \"sale\" of\nlittle papers. No youth could ever found or sustain a real magazine of\nsubstantial price and more than nominal circulation. The various\nten-cents-a-year journals which some \"amateurs\" try to edit are no\nlogical steps toward actually professional publishing. The latter comes\nonly after literary skill has been attained, and literary skill must at\nfirst be developed without regard for immediate monetary profit.\n\nBut the merit of Mr. Held's work is none the less unusual. \"The Frank\nFriend\" gives evidence of considerable critical ability, despite the\ntouch of arrogance, apologized for in a latter issue, shown in imperfect\nappreciation of Mr. Edward H. Cole's phenomenally pure English. Mr.\nHeld, in his enthusiasm for \"local color\", forgets that all the\nEnglish-speaking world is heir to one glorious language which should be\nthe same from Cape Colony to California or New York to New Zealand.\n\nThe only poem in this issue is Olive G. Owen's \"How Prayest Thou?\", a\npiece of true sentiment and artistic beauty. The only fault is metrical;\nthe use of the word \"trial\" as a monosyllable. This tendency to slur\nover words appears to be Miss Owen's one poetical vice, as exemplified\nin the imperfect rendering of \"jewel\", \"realness\", and \"cruelness\"\nelsewhere.\n\nTHE SPECTATOR for August-September is marred by a resurrection of the\never odious topic of Consolidation, but is otherwise of remarkable\nmerit. Elbert Hubbard, a professional advertiser and writer of\nconsiderable popularity in certain circles, relates in an interesting\nway the history of his most widely known literary effort. Mr. Hubbard's\nprose style is direct and pointed, though rather abrupt and barren. \"The\nMidnight Extra\", by Dora M. Hepner, is a humorous short story of unusual\nmerit, leading from a well created atmosphere of terror to a clever and\nunexpected anticlimax.\n\nTHE SPECTATOR for October-November contains much matter of very\nsubstantial worth. \"Creation\", by Edward R. Taylor, Dean of the\nUniversity of California, is a beautiful bit of poetical sentiment and\nharmonious metre, while \"Half-past-twelve\", by Miss von der Heide, is\nlikewise of great merit, both in thought and in structure. We have\nlately been told that many apparent metrical defects which we have noted\nare really no more than typographical errors, wherefore we will here\ncontent ourselves by expressing the belief that the third line of the\nsecond stanza of \"Half-past-twelve\" was originally written thus:\n\n    \"Across the dark their shrilling laughter floats\".\n\nThis rendering would do away with two seeming errors in the printed\ncopy. Olive G. Owen's \"Battle-Prayer\" is powerful in its appeal and\nfaultless in its construction. Of marked interest is \"Divine\nSelf-Tower\", a brief essay by Takeshi Kanno, the Japanese philosopher.\nThese words, in a tongue foreign to the writer, contain material for\nmore than a moment's thought.\n\n\"The Frank Friend\" is in this number as interesting a critic as before.\nThe passage of four months has tempered his undue severity; indeed, we\nfear that he has in certain cases veered a little too far toward the\nother extreme. The most ambitious review is that of \"Pig-pen Pete\", by\nElbert Hubbard, which gives Mr. Held an opportunity to display his\npowers to great advantage. Of the two editorials, that entitled \"Life\"\nis the more notable. Though its philosophy must necessarily be rather\nartificial, considering Mr. Held's age, it is none the less a very\nartistic and generally creditable piece of composition. The cover of The\nSpectator would be less Hearst-like if the fulsome announcements were\neliminated.\n\nTOLEDO AMATEUR for April greets us in altered form, as a two-column\npaper. Having given over the previous issue to the credentials of new\nmembers, Mr. Porter very justly claims a goodly space for himself this\nmonth, commenting ably on the affairs and activities of the\nassociations.\n\n\"Camp Columbia\", by James J. Hennessey, gives an interesting outline of\nthe American army routine in Cuba during the years 1907 and 1908.\n\"Observations of an Outsider\", by Mrs. Porter, mother of the editor,\nsheds light on amateur journalism from a hitherto unusual angle. We note\nwith pleasure that Toledo Amateur remains immune from the destructive\nbacillus of deformed spelling.\n\nTHE WOODBEE for April contains \"The Cycle Eternal\", a lucid\nphilosophical article by Samuel James Schilling, wherein is described\nthe dispersal and new combinations of the organic cells that compose the\nbody of mankind. By the perpetual reincorporation or reincarnation of\nthese cells in all other forms of matter, man is shown to be immortal,\nand in the closest degree akin to every natural object surrounding him.\nHis outward form is merely one transient phase of a ceaseless\nrearrangement of atoms; he is simply one aspect of infinite and eternal\nNature. Save for a few slight traces of rhetorical awkwardness, Mr.\nSchilling's expository style is remarkable for its force and clearness;\nthe arrangement of the essay into Prologue, Body, and Epilogue is\nespecially favorable to comprehensiveness.\n\nWhile Mr. Schilling deals with mankind in the abstract, Miss Mabel\nMcKee, in \"A Gift from the City\", presents a concrete example of the\nworkings of the human heart. Her subject and treatment are not\nstartlingly original, but such themes lose very little when repeated in\npure English and attractive style. The story is distinctly pleasing, and\nartistically developed throughout.\n\nA notable feature of the April Woodbee is Miss Hepner's fervent and\nunstudied tribute to Mr. Leo Fritter, candidate for the United's\nPresidency. Though the editorial is bestrewn with slang and distinctly\nfamiliar in construction, it produces upon the reader an impression of\nabsolute sincerity and intensity of feeling which more elaborate\nrhetoric might fail so forcibly to convey. Great as is the tribute,\nhowever, we feel that Mr. Fritter is worthy of it, and must congratulate\nhim on having such support. Our own efforts for his election, appearing\nin The Conservative, seem slight in comparison. The only verse in this\nnumber is \"My Shrine\", by Harriet E. Daily. Though containing an attempt\nto rhyme the words \"time\" and \"shrine\", this ethereal little poem of\nspring is of great attractiveness.\n\nZEPPELIN for March, a publication emanating from the pen of Mr. O. S.\nHackett of Canton, Pennsylvania, is scarcely as formidable and menacing\nas its name, being distinctly friendly and fraternal in its general\ntone. Mr. Hackett's prose has obviously not received its final\npolishing, but it is so filled with aspiration, ambition, and enthusiasm\nfor the cause of amateur journalism, that it evidently requires only\nsuch development as is obtainable from a closer study of grammar and\nrhetoric, and a wider perusal of classic English literature. In one\nmatter Mr. Hackett seems to harbor a wrong impression. The name\n\"credential\", in the language of the amateurs, is not applied to all\nliterary productions, but only to those which are submitted by the new\nrecruits as evidence of their educational fitness for membership in the\nassociation they seek to enter.\n\nJoseph R. Schaffman's poem, \"Think of Times Yet Coming\", shows the same\ninnate sense of rhyme and metre that has distinguished his earlier work.\nOnly the conclusion lacks perfect ease and naturalness. Mr. Schaffman\nhas so far confined his Muse to optimistic opinions and moral maxims; we\nhope that in the near future he will vary his efforts and attempt to\nreflect more of his general reading in his poetry. The field is large\nfor one so happily favored with the gift of song.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n                   THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n Official Organ of the United Amateur Press Association\n\n VOLUME XV    ELROY, WIS., SEPTEMBER, 1915     NUMBER 2\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n_The Alabamian_ for Spring is a magazine unique amongst the publications\nof the United. Devoted wholly to poetry, it contains some of the finest\nshort verses to appear this season, whilst even the crudest part of its\ncontents possesses some undoubted merit. The opening poem, a delightful\nand ornate nature sonnet entitled \"The Brook,\" professes to be a\ntranslation from the Spanish, a claim borne out by the use of the word\n\"jasmine\" in a place where the metre throws the accent anomalously on\nthe last syllable, as in the corresponding Spanish word \"jazmin.\" The\nsentiment of the whole is exquisite, and every image exhibits striking\nbeauty. It is to be regretted that both author and translator are\nsuffered to remain unrevealed. \"A Poet's Songs,\" by Miss Owen, is a\npowerful and well-written tribute to her fellow-bards both ancient and\nmodern. In Coralie Austin's \"Tribute to Our President,\" dedicated to\nMiss Hepner, we may discern the native talent of the true poet, slightly\nobscured by the crudities of youth. The opening line appears to lack a\nsyllable, though this may be due only to the printer's omission of the\narticle before the word \"laurel.\" In stanza 1, line 2, the trisyllabic\nword \"violets\" appears as a dissyllable. This contraction is a rather\nnatural one, and must not be criticised too sternly. Indeed, there is\nhere a sort of middle zone betwixt error and allowableness, wherein no\ndecisive precepts may be laid down. Words like \"radiant,\" \"difference,\"\nand so forth, are nearly always slurred into dissyllables, and we were\nourselves guilty of an even greater liberalism when we wrote that line\nin \"Quinsnicket Park\" which reads:\n\n    \"The bending boughs a _diamond_ wealth amass.\"\n\nBut in Miss Austin's second stanza occur two errors of graver nature.\n\"For only her alone\" is a lamentably tautological line which requires\nthe omission either of \"only\" or \"alone,\" and the substitution of some\nword to carry on the flow of metre. The attempted rhyming of \"alone\" and\n\"home\" is obviously incorrect. The dissimilar consonantal sounds render\nagreement impossible. This \"m-n\" rhyme, as we may call it, is becoming\nalarmingly frequent in careless modern verse, and must ever be avoided\nwith utmost diligence. In the third stanza we discover a marked error in\nmaintenance of number. We are told that the \"years go\" and that at \"its\nend\" we will lay trophies, etc. This mistake may be obviated with ease,\nby changing \"years go\" to \"year goes.\" Miss Austin's poetic talent is\ngreat, but shows the want of precise cultivation. \"Mother o' Mine,\" by\nMiss von der Heide, is a beautiful piece of anapaestic verse whose metre\nand sentiment alike attract the reader. \"Parsifal,\" by Miss Owen, shows\nsatisfactory depth of thought, but is rather modern in metre. From the\nconformation of the last line of the first stanza, we are led to believe\nthat the word \"viol\" is contracted to a monosyllable, or, to make a\nrather reprehensible pun, that \"vi-ol\" has here a \"vile\" pronunciation.\n\"Frailties of Life,\" by Editor Baxley, shows a remarkable system of\nextended rhyming, coupled with a noticeable lack of metrical harmony.\nMr. Baxley's technique is such that we believe his improvement would be\nbest effected by a repeated perusal of the older poets, whose classical\nexactitude of form would teach him rhythm by rote, so to speak. Let him\ncultivate his ear for metre, even though forced to acquire it through\nnonsensical jingles. We believe that many a child has obtained from his\n\"Mother Goose\" a love of correct rhythm which has later helped him in\nserious poetical efforts. \"Paid Back,\" a short, powerful poem by Miss\nvon der Heide, concludes an excellent and praiseworthy issue.\n\n_Aurora_ for April is a delightful individual leaflet by Mrs. Ida C.\nHaughton, exclusively devoted to poetical matters. The first poem,\n\"Aurora,\" is truly exquisite as a verbal picture of the summer dawn,\nthough rather rough-hewn metrically. Most open to criticism of all the\nfeatures of this piece, is the dissimilarity of the separate stanzas. In\na stanzaic poem the method of rhyming should be identical in every\nstanza, yet Mrs. Haughton has here wavered between couplets and\nalternate rhymes. In the opening stanza we behold first a quatrain, then\na quadruple rhyme. In the second we find couplets only. In the third a\nquatrain is followed by an arrangement in which two rhyming lines\nenclose a couplet, while in the final stanza the couplet again reigns\nsupreme. The metre also lacks uniformity, veering from iambic to\nanapaestic form. These defects are, of course, merely technical, not\naffecting the beautiful thought and imagery of the poem; yet the\nsentiment would seem even more pleasing were it adorned with the garb of\nmetrical regularity. \"On the Banks of Old Wegee\" is a sentimental poem\nof considerable merit, which suffers, however, from the same faults that\naffect \"Aurora.\" Most of these defects might have been obviated when the\nstanzas were composed, by a careful counting of syllables in each line\nand a constant consultation of some one, definite plan of rhyming. We\nmust here remark an error made in the typewritten copy of the original\nmanuscript, and reproduced in the finished magazine, for which, of\ncourse, neither the poetical art of the author nor the technique of the\nprinter is to blame. In the second stanza, lines 6 and 7 were originally\nwritten:\n\n    \"How oft I've essayed to be\n    A fisherman bold, but my luck never told.\"\n\n\"Anent the Writing of Poetry\" is a short prose essay, in which many\nvaluable truths are enunciated. Mrs. Haughton has evidently taken up the\npoetic art with due seriousness, and considering the marked talent shown\nin the first issue of her paper, we may justly expect to behold a\nwonderfully rapid development in the near future.\n\n_The Badger_ for June fulfills the promise of January, and shows us that\nthe present year has given the United a new and serious periodical of\nsatisfying quality. In the \"Introductory,\" Mr. George Schilling\ndiscusses in lively fashion the latest topics of the day, thereby\natoning for our own tedious \"Finale.\" \"Ready Made,\" by Samuel J.\nSchilling, is a thoughtful presentation of a lamentable fact. The evil\nwhich he portrays is one that has rendered the masses of America almost\nwholly subservient to the vulgar press; to be led astray into every sort\nof radicalism through low tricks of sensationalism. Our own poetical\nattempt, entitled \"Quinsnicket Park,\" contains 112 lines, and spoils\nthree and a half otherwise excellent pages. It is probable that but few\nhave had the fortitude to read it through, or even to begin it, hence we\nwill pass over its defects in merciful silence. \"What May I Own?\" by\nA. W. Ashby, is an able sociological essay which displays considerable\nfamiliarity with the outward aspects of economic conditions. Mr. Ashby,\ncondemning the present system practiced in the coal and iron industries,\ndeclares that on moral grounds he had rather be a brewer or purveyor of\nliquor than a coal magnate or an ironmaster. In this statement,\nevidently born of hasty fervour, Mr. Ashby forgets the basic character\nof the two types of industry which he contrasts. Beneath the liquor\ntraffic lies a foundation accursed by decency and reason. The entire\nindustry is designed to pander to a false craving whose gratification\nlowers man in the scale of mental and physical evolution. The distiller\nand vendor of rum is elementally the supreme foe of the human race, and\nthe most powerful, dangerous and treacherous factor in the defiance of\nprogress and the betrayal of mankind. His trade can never be improved or\npurified, being itself a crime against Nature. On the other hand, the\ncoal and iron industries are, in their fundamental forms, desirable and\nnecessary adjuncts to an expanding civilization. Their present evils are\nwholly alien to their essential principles, being connected only with\nthe uneasy industrialism of this age. These faults are not confined to\ncoal-mining and iron-working, but are merely those possessed in common\nwith all great industries. Joseph E. Shufelt's article on the European\nwar is an amazing outburst of socialism in its worst form. The idea that\nthis shocking carnage is the result of a deliberate plot of the ruling\nclasses of all the belligerents to destroy their labouring element is\nwonderfully ludicrous in its extravagance. We are led to infer that\nthose best of friends, der Kaiser and his cousins George and Nicholas,\nare merely pretending hostility in order to rid themselves of a\ntroublesome peasantry! We do not know what Mr. Shufelt has been reading\nlately, but we hope that time may modify his ideas to such a degree that\nhe will turn his dignified style and pure English to some object worthy\nof their employment.\n\n_Dowdell's Bearcat_ for July marks the beginning of an unprecedented era\nof improvement in the quality of that periodical. Having settled down to\nthe conventional 5\u00d77 size, it has now acquired a cover and an abundance\nof pages which the editor informs us will never be lessened. The\ninfluence of _The Olympian_ is perceptible in the _Bearcat_, and for his\ntaste in the selection of so worthy a model Mr. Dowdell is to be\ncommended. \"When the Tape Broke\" is the first article of the editorial\ncolumn, and well describes an example of collapsed activity which the\nUnited should avoid. \"A Runaway Horse,\" by Mrs. Ida C. Haughton, is a\nbrief and vivid sketch of a fatal accident. \"Tragedy,\" an exquisite poem\nby Emilie C. Holladay, deserves very favourable notice for the delicate\npathos of its sentiment, and perfect adaptation of the measure to the\nsubject. We may discern a few traces of immaturity in the handling of\nthe metre and in the presence of \"allowable\" rhymes. As elsewhere\nstated, we personally approve and employ the old-fashioned \"allowable\"\nrhyming sounds, but the best modern taste, as exemplified in the United\nby its Laureate, Rheinhart Kleiner, demands absolute perfection in this\nregard. As to the metre, we respectfully offer the following amended\nsecond stanza as an example. It is absolutely uniform with the original\nfirst stanza, which, of course, furnishes the model.\n\n          The summer rains\n          And autumn winds\n    The snowdrop find yet standing;\n          A petal gone,\n          And all alone,\n    Her tender roots expanding.\n\nThe remarkable poetical talent exhibited by Miss Holladay deserves a\ncultivation that shall invest her productions with a technique of the\nhighest order. \"The Dignity of Journalism,\" by ourselves, may be taken\nby the reader as a sort of supplement to this Department. We there\nenumerate in the abstract some of the precepts which we shall here apply\nto individual writers. There are several misprints, which we hope will\nnot be taken as evidences of our bad spelling, and at the conclusion the\nword \"even\" is omitted from the phrase which should read: \"the\nnecessity, or _even_ the expediency.\" \"June Journals\" is an excellent\nset of short reviews which display very favourably the critical ability\nof Mr. Dowdell. The concluding notes on \"Amateur Affairs\" are brief, but\nvery interesting. The general excellence of _Dowdell's Bearcat_ excuses\nthe instances of imperfect proof-reading, which fault we are sure will\nsoon be eliminated.\n\n_The Blarney Stone_ for March-April contains \"Thoughts,\" a meritorious\npoem by Chester P. Munroe. The tone of the piece is that of sentimental\nand almost melancholy reverie, hence the metre is not quite uniform; but\na commendable absence of rough breaks lends a delightful flow to the\nlines. We hope to behold further efforts from Mr. Munroe's pen. \"The\nAmateur's Creed,\" by Mrs. Renshaw, is written in the style of this\nauthor's previous and now well-known poem, \"A Symphony,\" and should do\nmuch toward lifting the United upward to the highest literary ideals.\n\n_The Blarney Stone_ for May-June has cast off all undue seriousness, and\nteems with light and attractive matter concerning the recent Rocky Mount\nconvention. Some of the displays of wit and cleverness are very striking\nand entertaining indeed, while no page departs so far from merit that it\nmay be justly adjudged as dull.\n\n_The Boys' Herald_ for August is an issue of unusual elaborateness,\nannouncing the engagement of its editor, Mr. Edwin Hadley Smith, and\nMiss Nita Edna Gerner of New York. Excellent portraits of the happy\ncouple follow the formal announcement, and Miss Gerner, now Associate\nEditor, describes in an excellent prose style the romance which\nculminated in the engagement. \"Gerneriana,\" consisting mainly of a\nreprint from an earlier issue, is an interesting account of the late\nRichard Gerner, an old-time amateur, and father of the prospective\nbride. This article is well supplemented by the reproductions of parts\nof old amateur papers which adorn the back cover of the magazine. The\nremainder of _The Boys' Herald_ is wholly statistical, dealing with the\namateur career of Mr. Smith. Few members of the association could\nproduce superior records of activity.\n\n_The Brooklynite_ for April maintains the high standard set by the\nprevious number. \"A Miracle,\" the opening poem, was composed by Alice L.\nCarson during the course of a meeting of the Blue Pencil Club, yet\nexhibits all the grace and harmony expected in a carefully planned and\nlaboriously polished work. \"Spring Thoughts,\" by A. M. Adams, is a\nhumorous prose masterpiece by the National's new Critic. Seldom is the\namateur press favoured with such a well-sustained succession of\nbrilliant epigrams. Miss Owen's \"Ode to Trempealeau Mountain\" is a noble\nspecimen of heroic blank verse, containing some very striking\nantithetical lines. The title, however, is a misnomer, since a true ode\nis necessarily of irregular form. \"Some Late Amateur Magazines,\" by\nW. B. Stoddard, is a series of brief, informal reviews. As a critic, Mr.\nStoddard shows considerable discernment, though having a rather\nunpleasant air of conscious superiority in certain places. A little more\nstateliness of style would add to the force of his criticisms. \"Spring\"\nreveals Rheinhart Kleiner in his favourite domain of amatory verse. Mr.\nKleiner's tuneful numbers and pure diction render his poetry ever a\ndelight. \"Rebellion,\" by Miss von der Heide, is a metrically perfect\npiece of verse whose artistry is marred only by the use of the\nunpoetical philosophical term \"subconscious\" instead of \"unconscious.\"\n\n_The Brooklynite_ for July is of especial interest as the first paper to\nprint an account of the Rocky Mount convention. This description, from\nthe facile and versatile pen of Miss von der Heide, is of distinctly\ninformal character, yet is none the less interesting as an animated\nchronicle of an enjoyable event. Rheinhart Kleiner's account of the\nNational convention is more dignified, and may be considered as a model\nfor this sort of composition. Mr. Kleiner shines as brightly in prose as\nin verse, and each day surprises us with revelations of excellence in\nvarious dissimilar departments of literature.\n\n_The Conservative_ for July is notable for Mr. Ira Cole's delightfully\npantheistic poem, \"A Dream of the Golden Age.\" The unusual poetic genius\nof Mr. Cole has been revealed but recently, yet the imaginative\nqualities pervading some of his prose long ago gave indications of this\ngift. The pantheistic, Nature-worshipping mind of our author lends to\nhis productions an unique and elusive atmosphere which contrasts very\nfavourably with the earthy tone of some of our less fanciful bards.\nMetrically, Mr. Cole adopts instinctively the regular, conservative\nforms of a saner generation. In this specimen of heroic verse he\ninclines toward the practice of Keats, and does not always confine\nsingle thoughts to single couplets in the manner of the\neighteenth-century poets. We believe that Mr. Cole is commencing a\nsuccessful career as a United poet, and await the day when he shall be\naccorded the honor of a laureateship.\n\n_The Coyote_ for July reveals a wonderful improvement over the March\nnumber, both in the literary quality of its contributions and in general\neditorial excellence. Never before have we seen the perfect amateur\nspirit acquired so quickly as in Mr. Harrington's case. \"Night Fancies,\"\nby Helen H. Salls, is a sonnet of exceptional power and artistry, whose\nfaultless metre is equalled only by its bold and striking images. Amidst\nthis profusion of excellent metaphor, it is difficult to select\nindividual instances for particular praise, but we might commend\nespecially the passage:\n\n    \"... the stars still keep\n    Afloat like boats that black sky-billows ride.\"\n\nMiss Salls is clearly an amateur poet of the first rank, and it is to be\nhoped that she will be a liberal contributor to United magazines. \"The\nRebirth of the British Empire,\" by William T. Harrington, is a clear and\nconcise exposition of the virtues whereby Old England maintains her\nproud position as Mistress of the Seas, and chief colonial empire of the\nworld. The style of the essay is admirable, and well exhibits the\nprogressive qualities of Mr. Harrington. \"An Ideal,\" by Nettie Hartman,\nis a short poem of pleasing sentiment and harmonious metre. The notes on\namateur affairs are interesting and well composed, revealing Mr.\nHarrington's increasing enthusiasm for the cause.\n\n_Dowdell's Bearcat_ for May is another striking illustration of the\nimprovement which can affect a paper within a very short time. Since\nlast October Mr. Dowdell has been progressing swiftly toward\njournalistic excellence, and even this cleverly conceived and uniquely\nshaped issue fails to mark the limit of his ambition. \"Knowest Thou?\" by\nMrs. Renshaw, is an expressive tribute to a nation whose recent infamies\ncan never wholly becloud its rugged virtues. \"With Nature I Rejoice\" is\nprobably the best poem which Joseph R. Schaffman has yet written. As his\nremarkable talent matures, the didactic element in his verse is\ngradually giving way to the more purely poetic, and this latest effort\nis one of which he may be justly proud. Concerning Mr. Dowdell's own\nspirited prose, we need only repeat the previous suggestion, that a\nlittle less slang would add much to its force and dignity.\n\n_Dowdell's Bearcat_ for May 26 contains another poem by Mrs. Renshaw\nwhose national tone is not likely to be popular just now outside the\ncountry to which it refers; in fact, Editor Dowdell has deemed it wise\nto make an apologetic statement concerning it. However, if we call \"Ein\nMann\" Col. Theodore Roosevelt, and shift the scene to San Juan Hill, we\nmay be able to appreciate the real patriotism delineated.\n\n_Dowdell's Bearcat_ for June is wholly given over to notes of the\namateur world. Mr. Dowdell is indeed a pleasing young writer, and leaves\nnone of his topics without a characteristic touch of light adornment.\n\n_The Lake Breeze_ for April is distinguished by James L. Crowley's poem\nentitled \"April,\" a brief lyric of marked merit, highly expressive of\nthe season. \"Writing Poetry,\" an essay by Dora M. Hepner, is a clear and\ntasteful analysis of the poet's art and inspiration. \"The Norwegian\nRecruit,\" a dialect monologue by Maurice W. Moe, is the leading feature\nof this issue. This exquisite bit of humor, recited by Mr. Moe at the\nUnited's 1913 convention, is a sketch of rare quality. \"The Amateur\nPress,\" now firmly established as a column of contributed reviews, is\nthis month of substantial size and fair quality. It is needless to say\nthat the news pages are interesting, and that the paper as a whole well\nmaintains the high reputation it has ever enjoyed.\n\n_The Lake Breeze_ for June apparently opens an era of unprecedented\nimprovement, being of distinctly literary rather than political nature.\nThe plea for a Department of Instruction is a just one, and ought to\nmeet with response from some of our pedagogical members. \"Broken Metre,\"\nby Mrs. Renshaw, is an attempt at defending the popular atrocities\ncommitted in the name of freedom by the modern poets. While the article\nis superficially quite plausible, we feel that the settled forms of\nregular metre have too much natural justification thus to be disturbed.\nThe citation of Milton, intended to strengthen Mrs. Renshaw's argument,\nreally weakens it; for while he undoubtedly condemns _rhyme_, he laments\nin the course of this very condemnation the _lame metre_ which is\nsometimes concealed by apt rhyming. \"Some Views on Versification,\" by\nClara I. Stalker, is an essay written from a sounder and more\nconservative point of view. The middle course in poetical composition,\nwhich avoids alike wild eccentricities and mechanical precision, has\nmuch to recommend it, and Miss Stalker does well to point out its\nvirtues. However, we do not see why even the few irregularities which\nare here said to be inevitable, cannot be smoothed out by the bard\nwithout destroying the sense of his poetry. \"Disappointment,\" by Mrs.\nMaude K. Barton, is a clever piece of light verse whose sprightly humour\nmakes up for its slight metrical roughness. The imperfect but allowable\nrhyming of \"bear\" and \"appear\" in the first stanza is entirely correct\naccording to the old-time standards which we ourselves follow, but we\nfear that the delicate ear of a precise metrical artist like Rheinhart\nKleiner would object to its liberalism. \"The Amateur Press\" is\ndistinguished by an excellent review from the pen of Mrs. Renshaw. The\nstyle is satisfactory, and the criticism just, making the whole well\nworthy of the prize book it has secured for its author. \"'Pollyanna,'\nthe Glad Book\" is a meritorious and entertaining review by Mrs.\nGriffith. \"Hope,\" by Marguerite Sisson, is commendable for its use of\nthat noble but neglected measure, the heroic couplet. Mr. Daas'\nconcluding editorial, \"Literature and Politics,\" is admirable for its\nconcise exposition of the United's new ideals, and its masterly\nrefutation of the common fallacy that political quarrels are necessary\nto stimulate activity in the press associations.\n\n_The Looking Glass_ for May is a journal unique in purpose and quality.\nEdited by Mrs. Renshaw in behalf of her many gifted recruits, it reveals\na condition absolutely unexampled; the acquisition by one member of so\nmany high-grade novices that a special publication is required properly\nto introduce them to the United. \"To a Critic of Shelley,\" by Helen H.\nSalls, is a long piece of beautiful blank verse, marred only by one\naccidental rhyme. Miss Salls is evidently one of those few really\npowerful poets who come all too seldom into Amateur Journalism,\nstartling the Association with impeccable harmony and exalted images.\nThe present poem grows even more attractive on analysis. The diction is\nof phenomenal purity and wholly unspoiled by any ultra-modern touch. It\nmight have been a product of Shelley's own age. The metaphor is\nmarvellous, exhibiting a soul overflowing with true spirituality, and a\nmind trained to express beautiful thought in language of corresponding\nbeauty. Such unforced ornateness is rarely met in the domain of amateur\npoetry. We feel certain that Miss Salls has already become a fixed star\nin the empyrean of the United. Exalted poetry of quite another type is\nfurnished by the work of our new Director, Rev. Frederick Chenault,\nwhose two exquisite lyrics, \"Birth\" and \"The Sea of Somewhere,\" appear\nin this issue. With little use of formal rhyme and metre, Mr. Chenault\nabounds in delicate conceptions and artistic renditions.\n\"Retrospection,\" by Kathleen Baldwin, is likewise a poem of high order,\nand of fairly regular metre, evidently following comparatively recent\nmodels in technique. \"The Faithful Man,\" by I. T. Valentine, shows\ngrowing poetical talent, but is cruelly injured by the anticlimactic\nline. Not that there is any anticlimax of sentiment, but the colloquial\nmode of expression shocks the reader who has been perusing the more\ndignified lines which go before. \"The Stonework of Life\" is an excellent\nprose sermon by Joseph Ernest Shufelt, which displays great ability in\nthe field of metaphor and allegory. Mr. Shufelt possesses an admirable\nstyle, unusually well fitted for didactic matter of this sort; indeed,\nit is regrettable that he should ever depart from such congenial themes\nand turn to the wild sensationalism which he shows in _The Badger_. In\ndemonstrating the beauties of morality and religion, he has few\nsuperiors, and a task so appropriate to his genius ought to claim his\nwhole attention. True, his thoughts may follow strange courses in their\nquest for truth and beauty, but were he always to curb them within the\nbounds of probability and conservatism, as here, he would never lose the\nconfidence of his public, as he has done with his strange war theories.\n\"The Autocracy of Art,\" by Anne Vyne Tillery Renshaw, is the leading\narticle of the magazine. Herein the author proclaims the supremacy of\nspiritual utterances over all restrictions created by the mind, and\nurges the emancipation of the soaring bard from the earthly chains of\nrhyme and metre. That the inward promptings of the poetic instinct are\nof prime value to the poet, few will dispute; but that they may give\nfinal form to his soul's creations without some regulation by the\nnatural laws of rhythm, few will agree. The metric sense lies far deeper\nin the breast of man than Mrs. Renshaw is here disposed to acknowledge.\nAfter this article, the perfectly regular stanzas of \"Fellow Craftsman,\"\n_by the same author_, are refreshing. The typography and form of _The\nLooking Glass_ leave something to be desired, but the riches within make\nample compensation for outward crudity.\n\n_The New Member_ for May, edited by William Dowdell, contains but one\ncredential, yet doubtless paves the way for a resumption of the\nenterprise so ably conducted by Miss Hoffman last year. \"Melancholy,\" a\npoem by I. T. Valentine, shows traces of the beginner's crudeness, yet\nhas about it a quality which promises much for the future of the poet.\n\"Lock-Step Pete,\" by Miss von der Heide, is an unusual poem with a\nthoughtful suggestion embodied in its concluding stanza.\n\n_The New Member_ bound with the May _Official Quarterly_ is a model that\nshould henceforth be followed as the nearest approach to perfection yet\nbeheld. Credentials, lists of prospective members, news of recruits, and\naccounts of local clubs are here given in just and pleasing proportion.\n\"Bluets and Butterflies,\" by Carolyn L. Amoss, is a poem of great\ndelicacy and ethereal atmosphere. The solitary, tiny flaw is the\nattempted rhyming of \"Miss\" and \"yes.\" \"War in America,\" by Annette E.\nFoth, is a pleasant juvenile story. E. Ralph Cheyney's extract from his\nessay on \"Youth\" is in many ways remarkable, and shows us that we have\nanother recruit of choice quality. His rather peculiar ideas are well\nexpressed, though their soundness is quite debatable. A few abnormal\ncharacters like Byron and Shelley doubtless experienced all the\nadolescent phenomena which Mr. Cheyney describes, but we believe that\nthe average youth is a copyist, and for the most part reflects his\nenvironment. Radicalism and novel ideas arise just as much from blas\u00e9,\nelderly cynics, who are tired of sane and sober conservatism. We have\nbeen reflecting on Life for about twenty years, ever since we were five,\nand have consistently believed that the wisdom of the ancient sage is\nthe true wisdom; that Life is essentially immutable, and that the\nglorious dreams of youth are no more than dreams, to be dissipated by\nthe dawn of maturity and the full light of age. \"Flowers on the Grave,\"\na poem by J. D. Hill, has a commendable sentiment, and is remarkable for\nits possession of only one repeated rhyming sound. Whether or not the\nlatter feature be monotonous, all must admit that the versification is\nattractive. \"We Are All Desperate!\" is a striking philosophical fragment\nby Melvin Ryder, which first appeared as an editorial in the _Ohio State\nLantern_. The conjectures are plausible, and the precepts sound. The\nnews items in this paper are all fresh and interesting, concluding an\nissue uniformly excellent.\n\n_The Pippin_ for May displays very favourably the high-school club whose\nfounding and maintenance are due entirely to the genius of Mr. Maurice\nW. Moe. \"The Coasters,\" by Esther Ronning, is the only poem in the\nissue, but its quality atones for the absence of other verse. The\npleasures and perils of coasting are here portrayed with wonderfully\ngraphic pen, whilst the metre is, so far as technical correctness is\nconcerned, all that might be desired. However, we wish that Miss\nRonning were less fond of unusual rhyming arrangements. The lines here\ngiven are of regular ballad length. Were they disposed in couplets, we\nshould have a tuneful lay of the \"Chevy Chase\" order; but as it is, our\near misses the steady couplet effect to which the standard models have\naccustomed us. \"With the Assistance of Carmen\" is a clever short story\nby Gladys Bagg, derived from the same plot nucleus by Mr. Moe which\nlikewise evoked Miss Moore's story in the March UNITED AMATEUR. The\nstructure of the narrative is excellent, but we do not like the use of\nthe plebeian expression \"onto\" on page 3. There is properly no such word\nas \"onto\" in the English language, \"upon\" being the preposition here\nrequired. Webster clearly describes \"onto\" as a low provincialism or\ncolloquialism. \"Little Jack in Fairyland,\" by Ruth Ryan, is a well\nwritten account of a dream, with the usual awakening just as events are\ncoming to a climax. The style is very attractive, and the images\ningenious. \"Getting What You Want,\" by Mr. Moe, is a brief one-act farce\nillustrating the subtle devices whereby the sharp housewife bewilders\nthe good-natured landlord into the granting of extraordinary favours.\nHad the heroine kept on to still greater lengths, she might have secured\nan entire new house. The present number of _The Pippin_ is, save for the\nabsence of photographs, quite as pleasing as the previous number. We\ntrust that Mr. Moe's editorial prophecy may be fulfilled, and that we\nmay soon behold another issue which shall make us familiar with the new\nfaces brought by revolving time into the congenial Appleton circle.\n\n_The Plainsman_ for July is the best number yet issued, the two\neleventh-hour contributions being very cleverly introduced. \"Revised\nEdition,\" by Mrs. Jeanette Timkin, is a versified piece of keen humour\nand good metre, well illustrating the opening of the third or aerial\nelement to human travel. \"To Bazine, Kansas\" is a sprightly prose\naccount by James J. Hennessey of his journey from Boston to Bazine. \"An\nIncident of Early Days,\" by Mrs. John Cole, is presented in the same\nattractive reminiscent style which makes her article in _The Trail_ so\nreadable and interesting. We are here told of the times when herds of\nbison were common sights, and are given a pleasing account of the\nformation of the Bazine Sunday-School. The articles by Mr. and Mrs. Ira\nCole show their appreciation of the amateurs who have visited them, and\nconclude an issue of thoroughly entertaining quality.\n\n_The Providence Amateur_ for June introduces to the United another local\npress club of great enthusiasm. Owing to some unauthorized omissions\nmade by the printer, this first issue is scarcely representative of the\nclub's entire personnel, but that which still remains affords, after\nall, a fair index to the character and ideals of the new organization.\nThe editorials by John T. Dunn are both frank and fearless. We detest a\nshifty club whose allegiance wavers betwixt the United, the Morris\nFaction and the National, and so are greatly pleased at Mr. Dunn's manly\nand open stand for the one real United. The editor's opinions on\nacknowledgment of papers is certainly just from one point of view,\nthough much may be said for the opposite side. When an amateur journal\nhas been prepared with unusual labour, and mailed conscientiously to\nevery member of the Association, the publisher has substantial reason\nfor resenting any marked display of neglect. We do not blame _The\nBlarney Stone_ for its attitude on this question, and shall probably\nfollow its custom by mailing the next _Conservative_ only to those who\nhave acknowledged one or both of the previous issues.\n\n_The Reflector_ for June is a British amateur magazine, transplanted on\nAmerican soil by its able editor, Ernest A. Dench. \"Crossing the\nAtlantic in War Time\" is a pleasing account of Mr. Dench's voyage from\nLiverpool to New York. \"Chunks of Copy\" forms the title of an excellent\nthough informal editorial department, while \"A Brain Tank at Your\nService\" teems with witticisms concerning various members of the Blue\nPencil Club. This magazine has no connection with any former journal of\nlike title, but seems likely to prove a worthy successor to all its\nnamesakes.\n\n_The Trail_ for Spring is a new and substantial illustrated magazine of\n20 pages and cover, issued by our well-known Private Critic, Mr. Alfred\nL. Hutchinson. At the head of the contents are the reminiscences of the\neditor, which prove extremely interesting reading, and which are well\nsupplemented by the lines entitled \"The Tramp Printer.\" Also by Mr.\nHutchinson is the well written and animated account of Mr. Nicholas\nBruehl, whose artistic photographical work adorns the inside covers of\nthis issue. \"Pioneer Life in Kansas,\" by Mrs. John Cole, is a\ndelightfully graphic picture of the trials and adventures of the early\nsettlers in the West. Being written from actual personal experience, the\nvarious incidents leave a lasting impression on the mind of the reader,\nwhile a pleasing smoothness of style enhances the vividness of the\nnarrative. \"Memory-Building\" is the first of a series of psychological\narticles by our master amateur, Maurice W. Moe. It is here demonstrated\nquite conclusively, that the faculty of memory is dependent on the\nfundamental structure and quality of the brain, and may never be\nacquired or greatly improved through cultivation. \"Evening at Magnolia\nSprings,\" by Laura E. Moe, exhibits the same type of literary talent\nthat her gifted husband possesses; in fact, this sketch may be compared\nwith Mr. Moe's well-known \"Cedar Lake Days.\" The use of trivial\nincidents gives an intense naturalness to the description. \"Caught,\" by\nRuth M. Lathrop, is a brilliant short story whose development and climax\nare natural and unforced. Fiction is generally the amateur's weakest\nspot, but Miss Lathrop is evidently one of the few shining exceptions.\nSo thoroughly excellent is _The Trail_, that we hope to see not merely a\nsecond issue, but its permanent establishment as one of the United's\nleading magazines.\n\n_The Tryout_ for June belongs to the National, but contains much matter\nby United members. \"Tempora Mutantur,\" a very meritorious short story by\nMarguerite Sisson, affords an illuminating contrast between the solid\nculture of 1834 and the detestable shallowness of the present time. This\nprevailing frivolity and unscholarliness is something which the United\nis seeking to remedy, and we are thankful indeed for stories such as\nthis, which expose modern levity in all its nauseousness. It is evident\nthat Miss Sisson is emulating the appreciative Anne Carroll of 1834,\nrather than her obtuse and indifferent descendant. \"The District\nSchool,\" by Edna R. Guilford, describes very vividly the many petty\nannoyances that beset the average teacher. While the picture is\nextremely well presented as a whole, certain roughnesses of diction\nnevertheless arrest the critical eye. \"Onto,\" in the first paragraph, is\na provincialism which should be superseded by \"to.\" Further on we hear\nthe teacher admonishing a youth to wash up some ink, and \"wash it\n_good_\"! Would a _teacher_ thus express herself? \"Well\" is the adverb\nhere needed. \"Too tired _to hardly stand_\" is a seriously ungrammatical\nphrase, which should read: \"almost too tired to stand.\" We note that one\nof the pupils' names is given as \"Robert Elsmere.\" While it may not be\nessentially a fault thus to use the name of a famous character of\nfiction, we feel that the exercise of a little more originality might\nhave avoided this appropriation of Mrs. Humphry Ward's celebrated hero.\nMiss Guilford's fundamental talent is unmistakable, but needs\ncultivation and practice before it can shine out in full splendour.\n\n_The Tryout_ for July contains \"Cripple George,\" a beautiful short story\nby Mrs. Rose L. Elmore, commendable alike in plot and technique. \"A Day\nin the Mountains,\" by Harry H. Connell, is a very interesting sketch\nwhose style exhibits considerable promise.\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for March contains a literary department which will,\nwe hope, remain as a regular feature. \"Tobias Smithers, Leading Man\" is\nMiss Ellen Moore's prize-winning attempt at constructing a story from a\nvery brief nucleus given by Mr. Moe. Miss Moore here exhibits a facile\npen and a just appreciation of humorous situations. \"Ghosts,\" by Mrs.\nRenshaw, well illustrates the vague superstitions of the negroes, those\nstrange creatures of darkness who seem never to cross completely the\nthreshold from apedom to humanity. \"March,\" by ourselves, is a gem of\nexquisite poesy, etc., etc., which we have here praised because no one\nelse could ever conscientiously do so. Line 10 apparently breaks the\nmetre, but this seeming break is due wholly to the printer. The line\nshould read:\n\n    \"The longer sunshine, and the shorter night.\"\n\n\"The Unknown Equation\" is a love story by Mrs. Florence Shepphird.\nThough the major portion is quite polished and consistent, we cannot but\ndeem the conclusion too abrupt and precipitate. Perhaps, being a frigid\nold critic without experience in romance, we ought to submit the\nquestion to some popular newspaper column of Advice to the Lovelorn,\ninquiring whether or not it be permissible for a young lady, after only\na few hours' acquaintanceship with a young gentleman, to encourage him\nto \"put his arm around her yielding form and kiss her passionately\"!!\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for May is graced by \"Reveille,\" a powerful and\nstirring poem written in collaboration by our two gifted bards, Mr.\nKleiner, the Laureate, and Miss von der Heide. \"Nature and the\nCountryman,\" by A. W. Ashby, is an iconoclastic attack on that love of\nnatural beauty which is inherent in every poetical, imaginative and\ndelicately strung brain. In prose of faultless technique and polished\nstyle, Mr. Ashby catalogues like a museum curator every species of flaw\nthat he can possibly pick in the scenes and events of rustic life. But\nwhile the career of the farmer is assuredly not one of uninterrupted\nbliss, it were folly to assert that Nature's superlative loveliness is\nnot more than enough to compensate for its various infelicities. No mind\nof high grade is so impervious to aesthetic emotion that it can behold\nwithout admiration the wonders of the rural realm, even though a vein of\nsordid suffering ran through the beauteous ensemble. Of all our personal\nfriends, the one who most adores and loves to personify Nature is a\nsuccessful farmer of unceasing diligence. Mr. Ashby errs, we are\ncertain, in taking the point of view of the unimaginative and\nunappreciative peasant. This sort of animal interprets Nature by\nphysical, not mental associations, and is unfitted by heredity to\nreceive impressions of the beautiful in its less material aspects.\nWhilst he grumbles at the crimson flames of Aurora, thinking only of the\nafternoon rain thus predicted, the man of finer mould, though equally\ncognizant that a downpour may follow, rejoices impulsively at the pure\nbeauty of the scene itself, a scene whose intellectual exaltation will\nhelp him the better to bear the dull afternoon. Is not the beauty-lover\nthe happier of the two? Both must endure the trials, but the poet enjoys\ncompensating pleasures which the boor may never know. The\npersonification and deification of Nature is a legacy from primitive\nages which will delight us in an atavistical way till our very race\nshall have perished. And let Mr. Ashby remember that those early tribes\nwho placed a god or goddess in every leafy tree, crystal fount, reedy\nlake or sparkling brook, were far closer to Nature and the soil than is\nany modern tenant farmer.\n\n_The United Official Quarterly_ for May has resumed its former\nattractive appearance, and contains a very creditable assortment of\nliterary matter. \"Atmosphere,\" by Mrs. Shepphird, is a thoughtful and\npleasing essay, whose second half well describes the individuality of\nthe various amateur authors and editors. \"The Kingly Power of Laughter,\"\nby Louena Van Norman, is no less just and graphic, illustrating the\nsupreme force of humour and ridicule. Leo Fritter, in \"Concerning\nCandidates,\" points out some important details for office-seekers,\nwhilst Ira A. Cole, in \"Five Sticks on Finance,\" gives some interesting\nsuggestions for economy. \"Opportunity,\" an essay by Mildred Blanchard,\nconcludes the issue, and successfully disputes the noxious old\nplatitude, that \"Opportunity knocks but once at each man's door.\" With\nthe _Quarterly_ is bound _The New Member_, reviewed elsewhere, the two\nforming a tasteful and meritorious magazine.\n\n_The Woodbee_ for July is an issue of unusual interest, revealing the\nmore serious and substantial activities of the prosperous Columbus Club.\nThe opening feature is a sonnet by Alma Sanger, \"To Autumn Violets,\"\nwhich exhibits some poetical talent and a just sense of metrical values.\nWe are sure that the defective second line is the fault of the printer\nrather than of the author. \"The Blind Prince,\" by Henriette Ziegfeld, is\nan excellent juvenile tale involving a fairy story. The only serious\nobjection is the undercurrent of adult comment which flows through the\nnarrative. Particularly cynical is the closing sentence: \"'And here's\nMother,' finished poor Auntie with a sigh of relief.\" The ordinary fairy\nstories told to children are bits of actual Teutonic mythology, and\nshould be related with a grave, absolute simplicity and naivete.\nHowever, as a psychological study of the typical childish auditor, the\nsketch as a whole is highly meritorious. We are inclined to wonder at\nthe possible meaning of the strange word \"alright,\" which appears more\nthan once in Miss Ziegfeld's tale. It is certainly no part of our\nlanguage, and if it be a corruption of \"all right,\" we must say that we\nfail to perceive why the correct expression could not have been used.\n\"What's in a Name?\" by Irene Metzger, is a clever sketch concerning\nthe silly modern practice of giving fancy names to helpless infants.\nGlancing backward a little through history, Miss Metzger would probably\nsympathize with the innocent offspring of the old Puritans, who\nreceived such names as \"Praise-God,\" and the like. Praise-God Barebones,\na leading and fanatical member of Cromwell's rebel parliament,\nwent a step further than his father, naming his own son\n\"If-Jesus-Christ-had-not-died-for-thee-thou-hadst-been-Damned\"! All this\nwas actually the first name of young Barebones, but after he grew up and\ntook a Doctor's degree, he was called by his associates, \"_Damned Dr.\nBarebones_\"! \"Moonlight on the River,\" by Ida Cochran Haughton, is an\nexquisite sentimental poem, each stanza of which ends with the same\nexpression. The atmosphere is well created, and the images dexterously\nintroduced. The whole piece reminds the reader of one of Thomas Moore's\nbeautiful old \"Irish Melodies.\" That Mrs. Haughton's talent has\ndescended to the second generation is well proven by Edna M. Haughton's\n\"Review of the Literary Work of the Quarter.\" Miss Haughton is a\npolished and scholarly reviewer, and her criticisms are in every\ninstance just and helpful. The editorial on \"Miss United\" is very well\nwritten, and should be carefully perused by those in danger of\nsuccumbing to the autumnal advances of that sour old maid, Miss\nNational.\n\n                                             --HOWARD P. LOVECRAFT\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\nLittle Journeys to the Homes of Prominent Amateurs\n\nAmong the many amateurs I have never met in the flesh and realness of\nLife, Howard Phillips Lovecraft, poet, critic and student, appeals to me\nas no other recent \"find\" in the circles of amateuria has ever appealed.\nAnd Lovecraft _is_ a distinct \"find.\" Just why he holds a firm grip on\nmy heart-strings is something of a mystery to me. Perhaps it is because\nof his wholesome ideals; perhaps it is because he is a recluse, content\nto nose among books of ancient lore; perhaps it's because of his\nphysical afflictions; his love of things beautiful in Life; his ardent\nadvocacy of temperance, cleanliness and purity--I don't know. We\ndisagree on many questions; he criticises my literary activities; he\nsmiles at my suffrage theories, and disapproves of my language in _Chain\nLightning_. But I like him.\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft has an interesting history, and this fact was\nknown to Official Editor Daas when he asked me to take a little journey\nto the study-home of the Vice-President. \"Don't stint yourself for\nspace\" was noted on the assignment tab, and after glancing over the\nbiographical notes before me--I am sure that Daas has again exemplified\nhis quiet humor during a serious moment.\n\nLovecraft was born at 454 Angell St., Providence, R. I., on August 20,\n1890. His nationality is Anglo-American, and under British law he can\nclaim to be a British subject, since he is a grandson in direct male\nline of a British subject not naturalized in the United States. His\nancestry is purely English. On the paternal side he is a descendant of\nthe Lovecrafts, a Devonshire family which has furnished a great many\nclergymen to the Church of England, and the Allgoods of Northumberland,\na history-honored family of which several members have been knighted.\nThe Allgoods have been a military line, and this may account for\nLovecraft's militarism and belief in the justice of war. On the maternal\nside he is a typical Yankee, coming from East English stock which\nsettled in Rhode Island about 1680. Lovecraft is a student of\nastronomy--it is a domineering passion with him--and this love was\napparently inherited from his maternal grandmother, Rhoby Phillips, who\nstudied it thoroughly in her youth at Lapham Seminary, and whose\ncollection of old astronomical books first interested him. Lovecraft\ncame from pure-blood stock, and he is the last male descendant of that\nfamily in the United States. With him the name will die in America. He\nis unmarried.\n\nAs he was about to enter college at the age of eighteen, his feeble\nhealth gave way, and since then he has been physically incapacitated and\nrendered almost an invalid. Being thus deprived of his cherished hope to\nfurther his education and prepare himself for a life of letters, he has\ncontented himself with his home, which is just three squares from his\nbirthplace, and where he lives with his mother. And his home life is\nideal. His personal library--his haven of contentment--contains more\nthan 1500 volumes, many of them yellowed with age, and crude examples of\nthe printer's art. Among these treasured books may be found volumes\nwhich have passed through the various branches of his family, some\ndating back to 1681 and 1702, and methinks I can see Lovecraft poring\nover these time-stained bits o' bookish lore as the monks of old\nfollowed the printed lines with quivering fingers in the taper's\nuncertain, flickering light. For Lovecraft appeals to me as a\nbookworm--one of those lovable mortals whose very existence seems to\nhang on the numbered pages of a heavy, clumsy book!\n\nHis connection with organized amateur journalism is of recent date. On\nApril 6, 1914, his application for membership in the United Amateur\nPress Association of America was forwarded to the Secretary. Like a\ngreat many of the recruits, Lovecraft was completely ignored for several\nmonths. In July of last year he became active, and he has proven to be\nan invaluable asset to the literary life of the Association. He is _not_\na politician. However, his literary activities had been prosecuted many\nyears before he had ever heard of the United. At the age of eight and\none-half years he published the _Scientific Gazette_, a weekly\nperiodical, written in pencil and issued in editions of four carbon\ncopies. This journal was devoted to the science of chemistry, which was\none of his earliest hobbies, and ran from March, 1899, to February,\n1904. As in most cases, my knowledge of chemistry was acquired after I\nhad spent four years in high-school, and the fact that any boy should be\ninterested in that study at the age of eight and one-half years appeals\nto me as something out of the ordinary. But Lovecraft was not an\nordinary boy. His second and more ambitious venture was the _Rhode\nIsland Journal of Astronomy_. This was at first published as a weekly,\nand later changed to a monthly publication. This was carefully printed\nby hand and then duplicated on the hectograph and issued in lots of\ntwenty-five copies. The _Journal_ was issued from 1903 to 1907, and\ncontained the latest astronomical news, re-written from the original\ntelegraphic reports issued from Harvard University and seen at the Ladd\nObservatory. It also contained many of his original articles and\nforecasts of phenomena. He owns a 3-inch telescope of French make, and\naside from amateur journalism, his one great hobby is astronomy. At the\nage of sixteen he commenced writing monthly astronomical articles for\nthe Providence _Tribune_, and later changed to the _Evening News_, to\nwhich he still contributes. During the present year he has contributed a\ncomplete elementary treatise on astronomy in serial form to the\nAsheville (N. C.) _Gazette-News_. Besides contributing a great many\npoems and articles to the amateur press, editing _The Conservative_ and\nassisting with the editorial work on _The Badger_, the appearance of Mr.\nLovecraft's work in the professional magazines is of common occurrence.\nDuring the past year he has had charge of the Bureau of Public Criticism\nin THE UNITED AMATEUR, where he has proven himself a just, impartial and\npainstaking critic. That he will achieve a great popularity in the world\nof amateur letters is a foregone conclusion, and I do not think that I\nam indulging in extravagant praise in predicting a brilliant future for\nhim in the professional field.\n\nI am acquainted with Howard Phillips Lovecraft only through\ncorrespondence; I have never felt the flesh of his palm, and yet, I know\nhe is a man--every inch of him--and that amateur journalism will be\nenriched and promoted to its highest plane through his kindly influence\nand literary leadership.\n\n                                               ANDREW FRANCIS LOCKHART\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    FEBRUARY 1916\n\n\nThe Teuton's Battle-Song\n\n    \"Omnis erat vulnus unda\n    Terra rubefacta calido\n    Frendebat gladius in loricas\n    Gladius findebat clypeos--\n    Non retrocedat vir a viro\n    Hoc fuit viri fortis nobilitas diu--\n    Laetus cerevisiam cum Asis\n    In summa sede bibam\n    Vitae elapsae sunt horae\n    Ridens moriar.\"\n                    --REGNER LODBROG\n\n    The mighty Woden laughs upon his throne,\n    And once more claims his children for his own.\n    The voice of Thor resounds again on high,\n    While arm'd Valkyries ride from out the sky:\n    The Gods of Asgard all their pow'rs release\n    To rouse the dullard from his dream of peace.\n    Awake! ye hypocrites, and deign to scan\n    The actions of your \"brotherhood of Man.\"\n    Could your shrill pipings in the race impair\n    The warlike impulse put by Nature there?\n    Where now the gentle maxims of the school,\n    The cant of preachers, and the Golden Rule?\n    What feeble word or doctrine now can stay\n    The tribe whose fathers own'd Valhalla's sway?\n    Too long restrain'd, the bloody tempest breaks,\n    And Midgard 'neath the tread of warriors shakes.\n    On to thy death, Berserker bold!

P. LOVECRAFT\n\n\n_Author's Note._\n\nThe writer here endeavours to trace the ruthless ferocity and incredible\nbravery of the modern Teutonic soldier to the hereditary influence of\nthe ancient Northern Gods and Heroes. Despite the cant of the\npeace-advocate, we must realise that our present Christian civilisation,\nthe product of an alien people, rests but lightly upon the Teuton when\nhe is deeply aroused, and that in the heat of combat he is quite prone\nto revert to the mental type of his own Woden-worshipping progenitors,\nlosing himself in that superb fighting zeal which baffled the conquering\ncohorts of a Caesar, and humbled the proud aspirations of a Varus.\nThough appearing most openly in the Prussian, whose recent acts of\nviolence are so generally condemned, this native martial ardour is by no\nmeans peculiar to him, but is instead the common heritage of every\nbranch of our indomitable Xanthochroic race, British and Continental\nalike, whose remote forefathers were for countless generations reared in\nthe stern precepts of the virile religion of the North. Whilst we may\nwith justice deplore the excessive militarism of the Kaiser Wilhelm and\nhis followers, we cannot rightly agree with those effeminate preachers\nof universal brotherhood who deny the virtue of that manly strength\nwhich maintains our great North European family in its position of\nundisputed superiority over the rest of mankind, and which in its purest\nform is today the bulwark of Old England. It is needless to say to an\neducated audience that the term \"Teuton\" is in no way connected with the\nmodern German Empire, but embraces the whole Northern stock, including\nEnglish and Belgians.\n\nIn the Northern religion, Alfadur, or the All-Father, was a vague though\nsupreme deity. Beneath him were among others Woden, or Odin, practically\nthe supreme deity, and Woden's eldest son Thor, the God of War. Asgard,\nor heaven, was the dwelling-place of the Gods, whilst Midgard was the\nearth, or abode of man. The rainbow, or bridge of Bifrost, which\nconnected the two regions, was guarded by the faithful watchman\nHeimdall. Woden lived in the palace of Valhalla, near the grove of\nGlasir, and had as messengers to earth the Valkyries, armed, mailed and\nmounted virgins who conveyed from the earth to Asgard such men as had\nfallen bravely in battle. Only those who fell thus could taste to the\nfull the joys of paradise. These joys consisted of alternate feasting\nand fighting. At Woden's feasts in Valhalla was served the flesh of the\nboar Sehrimnir, which, though cooked and eaten at every meal, would\nregain its original condition the next day. The wounds of the warriors\nin each celestial combat were miraculously healed at the end of the\nfighting.\n\nBut this heaven was not to last forever. Some day would come Ragnarok,\nor the Twilight of the Gods, when all creation would be destroyed, and\nall the Gods and men save Alfadur perish. Surtur, after killing the last\nof these Gods, would burn up the world. Afterward the supreme Alfadur\nwould make a new earth or paradise, creating again the Gods and men, and\nsuffering them ever after to dwell in peace and plenty.\n\n\n\n\n                   THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n VOLUME XV    GEORGETOWN, ILL., APRIL, 1916    NUMBER 9\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Brooklynite= for January contains one of Rheinhart Kleiner's\ncharacteristic poems, entitled \"A Mother's Song\". Mr. Kleiner's command\nof good taste, harmony, and correctness requires no further panegyric\namongst those who know him; but to the more recent United members who\nhave not yet read extensively in our journals, his work may well be\nrecommended as undoubtedly the safest of all amateur poetical models for\nemulation. Mr. Kleiner has a sense of musical rhythm which few amateur\nbards have ever possessed, and his choice of words and phrases is the\nresult of a taste both innate and cultivated, whose quality appears to\nrare advantage in the present degenerate age. This remarkable young poet\nhas not yet fully displayed in verse the variety of thoughts and images\nof which his fertile brain and well selected reading have made him\nmaster, but has preferred to concentrate most of his powers upon\ndelicate amatory lyrics. While some of his readers may at times regret\nthis limitation of endeavor, and wish he might practice to a greater\nextent that immense versatility which he permitted the amateur public to\nglimpse in the September =Piper=; it is perhaps not amiss that he should\ncultivate most diligently that type of composition most natural and easy\nto him, for he is obviously a successor of those polished and elegant\npoets of gallantry whose splendour adorned the reigns of Queen Elizabeth\nand King James the First.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Conservative= for January opens with Winifred Virginia Jordan's\n\"Song of the North Wind\", one of the most powerful poems lately seen in\nthe amateur press. Mrs. Jordan is the newest addition to the United's\nconstellation of genuine poetical luminaries; shining as an artist of\nlively imagination, faultless taste, and graphic expression, whose work\npossesses touches of genius and individualism that have already brought\nher renown in amateur circles. In the poem under consideration, Mrs.\nJordan displays a phenomenal comprehension of the sterner aspects of\nNature, producing a thoroughly virile effect. Words are chosen with care\nand placed with remarkable force, whilst both alliteration and\nonomatopoeia are employed with striking success. By the same author is\nthe shorter poem entitled \"Galileo and Swammerdam\", which though vastly\ndifferent in aspect and rhythm, yet retains that suggestion of mysticism\nso frequently encountered in Mrs. Jordan's work.\n\nJames Tobey Pyke, a lyrical and philosophical poet of high scholastic\nattainments, contributes two poems; \"Maia\", and \"The Poet\". The latter\nis a stately sonnet, rich in material for reflection. Such is the\nquality of Mr. Pyke's work, that his occasional contributions are ever\nto be acclaimed with the keenest interest and appreciation.\n\nRheinhart Kleiner, our Laureate, is another bard twice represented in\nthe January =Conservative=. His two poems, \"Consolation\" and \"To Celia\",\nthough widely different in structure, are yet not unrelated in\nsentiment, being both devoted to the changing heart. One amateur critic\nhas seen fit to frown upon so skilled an apotheosis of inconsistency,\nbut it seems almost captious thus to analyse an innocuous bit of art so\ndaintily and tastefully arrayed. \"To Celia\" is perhaps slightly the\nbetter of the two, having a very commendable stateliness of cadence, and\na gravity of thought greater than that of \"Consolation\".\n\n\"The Horizon of Dreams\", by Mrs. Renshaw, is a graphic and enthralling\nventure into the realm of nocturnal unreality. The free play of active\nimagination, the distorted and transitory conceptions and apparitions,\nand the strangely elusive analogies, all lend charm and color to this\nhappy portrayal of the vague boundaries of Somnus' domain. Mrs.\nRenshaw's rank as a poet is of very high tone, most of her productions\ninvolving a spiritual insight and metaphysical comprehension vastly\nbeyond that of the common mind. But this very nobility of imagination,\nand superiority to the popular appeal, are only too likely to render her\nbest work continually underestimated and unappreciated by the majority.\nShe is not a \"poet of the masses\", and her graver efforts must needs\nreach audiences more notable for cultured than numerical magnitude. Of\nMrs. Renshaw's liberal metrical theories, enough is said elsewhere. This\nDepartment can neither endorse principles so radical, nor refrain from\nremarking that want of proper rhyme and metre has relegated to obscurity\nmany a rich and inspired poem.\n\n\"Departed\", by Maude Kingsbury Barton, is a sentimental poem of\nundoubted grace and sweetness, happily cast in unbroken metre.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Coyote= for January is adorned by no less than three of Mrs.\nWinifred V. Jordan's exquisite short poems. \"The Night-Wind\" is a\ndelicately beautiful fragment of dreamy metaphor. There is probably a\nslight misprint in the last line, since the construction there becomes\nsomewhat obscure. \"My Love's Eyes\" has merit, but lacks polish. The word\n\"azure\" in the first stanza, need not be in the possessive case; whilst\nthe use of a singular verb with a plural noun in the second stanza\n(smiles-beguiles) is a little less than grammatical. \"Longing\" exhibits\nthe author at her best, the images and phraseology alike showing the\ntouch of genius.\n\nOther poetry in this issue is by Adam Dickson, a bard of pleasing manner\nbut doubtful correctness. \"Smile\" needs rigorous metrical and rhetorical\nrevision to escape puerility. \"Silver Bells of Memory\" is better, though\nmarred by the ungrammatical passage \"thoughts doth linger\". In this\npassage, either the noun must be made singular, or the verb form plural.\n\n\"Prohibition in Kansas\" is a well written prose article by Editor\nWilliam T. Harrington, wherein he exhibits a commendably favourable\nattitude toward the eradication of the menace of strong drink. Mr.\nHarrington is an able and active amateur, and takes an intelligent\ninterest in many public questions. His style and taste are steadily\nimproving, so that =The Coyote= has already become a paper of importance\namong us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Dixie Booster= for January is Mr. Raymond E. Nixon's =Capital City\nNews=, transferred to the amateur world, and continued under the new\nname. With this number the editor's brother, Mr. Roy W. Nixon, assumes\nthe position of Associate Editor. This neat little magazine is\nhome-printed throughout, and may well remind the old-time amateurs of\nthose boyish \"palmy days\" whose passing they lament so frequently. By\nmeans of a cut on the third page, we are properly introduced to Editor\nNixon, who at present boasts but thirteen years of existence. The gifted\nand versatile associate editor, Mr. Roy W. Nixon, shows marked talent in\nthree distinct departments of literature; essay-writing, fiction, and\nverse. \"Writing as a Means of Self-Improvement\" is a pure, dignified and\ngraceful bit of prose whose thought is as commendable as its structure.\n\"A Bottle of Carbolic Acid\" is a gruesome but clever short story of the\nPoe type, exhibiting considerable comprehension of abnormal psychology\nas treated in literature. \"My Valentine\" is a poem of tuneful metre and\nwell expressed sentiment, though not completely polished throughout. The\nthird stanza, especially, might be made less like prose in its images.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Dowdell's Bearcat= for December is quaint and attractive in appearance.\nThe youthful editor has provided himself with a series of cuts of the\nmetaphorical \"Bruin\" in various attitudes and various employments, these\nclever little pictures lending a pleasing novelty to the cover and the\nmargins. Judiciously distributed red ink, also, aids in producing a\nChristmas number of truly festive quality. Mr. Dowdell's \"Growls from\nthe Pit\" is a series of editorials both timely and interesting, while\nhis \"Did You Hear That\" is a lively page of fresh news. This issue is\nnotable for Mrs. Winifred V. Jordan's poetical contributions, of which\nthere are three. \"Life's Sunshine and Shadows\" is a tuneful moral poem\nwhose rhythm and imagery are equally excellent. \"Contentment\" is brief\nbut delightful. \"When the Woods Call\" is a virile, graphic piece;\nvibrant with the thrill of the chase, and crisp with the frosty air of\nthe Northern Woods.\n\nThe present reviewer's lines \"To Samuel Loveman\" contain five misprints,\nas follows:\n\n Line  3 for =are=     read =art=\n   \"   5  \"  =Appollo=   \"  =Apollo=\n   \"   6  \"  =versus=    \"  =verses=\n   \"  15  \"  =eternal=   \"  =ethereal=\n   \"  18  \"  =the=       \"  =thee=\n\n\"Beads from my Rosary\", by Mary M. Sisson, is a collection of well\nwritten and sensible paragraphs on amateur journalism, which ought to\nassist in arousing enthusiasm amongst many members hitherto dormant.\nEditor Dowdell's pithy little epigrams at the foot of each page form an\nentertaining feature, many of them being of considerable cleverness.\n=Dowdell's Bearcat= will soon revert to its original newspaper form,\nsince Mr. Dowdell intends to make newspaper work his life Profession.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Inspiration= for November is a decidedly informal though\nexceedingly clever personal paper issued by Miss Edna von der Heide as a\nreminiscence of the Rocky Mount convention. Prose and verse of\nwhimsically humorous levity are employed with success in recording the\nsocial side of the amateur gathering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Looking Glass= for January is composed wholly of biographical\nmatter, introducing to the association the multitude of accomplished\nrecruits obtained through Mrs. Renshaw and others. In these forty life\nstories, most of them autobiographical, the student of human nature may\nfind material for profound reflection on the variety of mankind. The\nmore recent members of the United, as here introduced, are in the\naggregate a maturer, more serious, and more scholarly element than that\nwhich once dominated the amateur world; and if they can be properly\nwelcomed and acclimated to the realm of amateur letters, they will be of\ngreat value indeed in building up the ideals and character of the\nassociation. For this influx of sedate, cultivated members, the United\nhas Mrs. Renshaw to thank, since the present policy of recruiting was\noriginated and is conducted largely by the Second Vice-President.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Ole Miss'= for December is the most important of all recent additions\nto amateur letters, and it is with regret that we learn of the\nmagazine's prospective discontinuance. The issue under consideration is\nlargely local, most of the contributions being by Mississippi talent,\nand it must be said that the contributors all reflect credit upon their\nnative or adopted State.\n\nMr. J. W. Renshaw's page of editorials is distinguished equally by good\nsense and good English. His attitude of disapproval toward petty\npolitical activities and fruitless feuds in the United is one which\nevery loyal member will endorse, for nearly all of the past disasters in\namateur history have been caused not by serious literary differences,\nbut by conflicting ambitions among those seeking no more than cheap\nnotoriety.\n\nMrs. Renshaw is well represented both by prose and by verse, the most\ninteresting of her pieces being possibly the essay entitled \"Poetic\nSpontaneity\", wherein more arguments are advanced in her effort to prove\nthe inferior importance of form and metre in poesy. According to Mrs.\nRenshaw, the essence of all genuine poetry is a certain spontaneous and\ninvoluntary spiritual or psychological perception and expression;\nincapable of rendition in any prescribed structure, and utterly\ndestroyed by subsequent correction or alteration of any kind. That is,\nthe bard must respond unconsciously to the noble impulse furnished by a\nfluttering bird, a dew-crowned flower, or a sun-blest forest glade;\nrecording his thoughts exactly as evolved, and never revising the\nresult, even though it be detestably cacophonous, or absolutely\nunintelligible to his less inspired circle of readers. To such a theory\nas this we must needs reply, that while compositions of the sort\nindicated may indeed represent poesy, they certainly represent art in\nits proper sense no more than do \"futuristic\" pictures and other modern\nmonstrosities of a like nature. The only exact means whereby a poet may\ntransmit his ideas to others is language, a thing both definite and\nintellectual. Granting that vague, chaotic, dissonant lines are the best\nform in which the tender suitor of the Muses may record his spiritual\nimpressions for his own benefit and comprehension, it by no means\nfollows that such lines are at all fitted to convey those impressions to\nminds other than his own. When language is used without appropriateness,\nharmony, or precision, it can mean but little save to the person who\nwrites it. The soul of a poem lies not in words but in meaning; and if\nthe author have any skill at all in recording thought through language,\nhe will be able to refine the uncouth mass of spontaneous verbiage\nwhich first comes to him as representing his idea, but which in its\noriginal amorphous state may fail entirely to suggest the same idea to\nanother brain. He will be able to preserve and perpetuate his idea in a\nstyle of language which the world may understand, and in a rhythm which\nmay not offend the reader's sense of propriety with conspicuous\nharshness, breaks, or sudden transitions.\n\n\"Flames of the Shadow\", Mrs. Renshaw's longest poetical contribution to\nthis issue, is a powerful piece which, despite the author's theory,\nseems in no way injured by its commendably regular structure.\n\"Immortality of Love\" is likewise rather regular, though the plan of\nrhyming breaks down in the last stanza. \"For You\" and \"Sacrament of\nSpirit\" are short pieces, the former containing an \"allowable\" rhyming\nof \"tongue\" and \"long\", which would not meet with the approval of the\nKleiner type of critic, but upon which this department forbears to\nfrown.\n\nJames T. Pyke's two poems, \"To a Butterfly\" and \"Life and Time\" are gems\nof incomparable beauty. \"Ole Gardens\", by Winifred V. Jordan, is a\nhaunting bit of semi-irregular verse which deserves warm applause for\nthe cleverness of its imagery and the aptness of its phraseology. \"The\nReward of it All\", by Emilie C. Holladay, is a potent but pathetic poem\nof sentiment, whose development is highly commendable, but whose\nmetrical construction might be improved by judicious care. \"A\nMississippi Autumn\" was written as prose by Mrs. Renshaw, and set in\nheroic verse without change of ideas by the present critic. The metaphor\nis uniformly lofty and delicate, whilst the development of the sentiment\nis facile and pleasing. It is to be hoped that the original thoughts of\nthe author are not impaired or obscured by the technical turns of the\nless inspired versifier. \"My Dear, Sweet, Southern Blossom\", dedicated\nto Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw with Compliments of the Author, James Laurence\nCrowley, is a saccharine and sentimental piece of verse reminiscent of\nthe popular ballads which flourished ten or more years ago. Triteness is\nthe cardinal defect, for each genuine image is what our discerning\nprivate critic Mr. Moe would call a \"rubber-stamp\" phrase. Mr. Crowley\nrequires a rigorous course of reading among the classic poets of our\nlanguage, and a careful study of their art as a guide to the development\nof his taste. At present his work has about it a softness bordering on\neffeminacy, which leads us to believe that his conception of the poet's\nart is rather imperfect. It is only in caricature that we discover the\npoet as a sighing, long-haired scribbler of gushing flights of infantile\nawe or immature adoration. Earnestness, dignity, and at times, sonorous\nstateliness, become a good poet; and such thoughts as are generally\nsuggested by the confirmed use of \"Oh\", \"Ah\", \"dear\", \"little\",\n\"pretty\", \"darling\", \"sweetest flow'ret of all\", \"where the\nmorning-glory twineth\", and so on, belong less to literary poetry than\nto the Irving Berlin song-writing industry of \"Tin Pan Alley\" in the\nYiddish wilds of New York City. Mr. Crowley has energy of no mean sort,\nand if he will apply himself assiduously to the cultivation of masculine\ntaste and technic, he can achieve a place of prominence among United\nbards.\n\nW. S. Harrison deserves a word of praise for his poem of Nature,\nentitled \"Our Milder Clime\", wherein he celebrates the charms of\nMississippi, his native state. The lines contain an old-fashioned grace\ntoo often wanting in contemporary verse. Other contributions to =Ole\nMiss'= are Mrs. Maude K. Barton's \"Something of Natchez\", a very\ninteresting descriptive sketch in prose, and Dr. Rolfe Hunt's two negro\ndialect pieces, both of which are of inimitable wit and cleverness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Pippin= for February is the first number of this important\nhigh-school journal to be issued without the supervision of Mr. Moe, and\nits excellence well attests the substantial independent merit of the\nAppleton Club. The city of Appleton forms the dominant theme in this\nnumber, and with the assistance of seven attractive half-tone\nillustrations, the publication well displays the beauty and advantages\nof the pleasant Wisconsin town. Miss Eleanor Halls cleverly weaves into\nconversational form much information concerning the remote history of\nAppleton, emphasizing the superior character resulting from the select\nquality of the settlers, and the early introduction of learning. Mr.\nAlfred Galpin surprises many readers when he reveals the fact that\nAppleton possessed the first of all telephone systems, a surprise\nquickly followed by Mr. Joseph Harriman's illustrated paragraph telling\nof the first street-car, also an Appleton innovation. Among other\narticles, that by Miss Torrey on Lawrence College is of unusual\ninterest. \"The Immortalization of the Princess\", by Miss Fern Sherman,\nis an excellent Indian tale, whose structure and atmosphere well suggest\nnot only the characteristic tribal legends of the red folk, but other\nand more classical myths as well. Though Miss Sherman is not yet a\nmember of the United, one of such gifts would be heartily welcomed in\nthe ranks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Plainsman= for December is the most substantial number of his\njournal which Mr. Ira Cole has yet issued. First in order of importance\namong the contents is perhaps the editor's own prose sketch entitled\n\"Monuments\", wherein Mr. Cole reveals to particular advantage his\nexceptional skill in depicting and philosophizing upon the various\naspects and phenomena of Nature. Mr. Cole's style is constantly\nimproving, though not now of perfect polish, it is none the less\nremarkable for its grace and fluency. \"To Florence Shepphird\", also by\nMr. Cole, is a rather long piece of blank verse, containing many\nbeautiful passages. The author's skill in stately and sonorous poetry is\nfar above the common level, and his work has about it an atmosphere of\nthe polished past which that of most amateur bards lacks; yet the\npresent poem is not without errors. The passage (lines 10-11) reading:\n\"calm =days= that =knoweth= not dread Boreas' chilling breath\" must be\nchanged so that either the noun shall be singular or the verb plural.\nThe double negative in line 23 might well be eliminated. Two lines whose\nmetre could be improved are the 13th and 50th. The final quatrain is\npleasing to the average ear, including that of the present critic;\nthough the very exact taste of today, as represented by Mr. Kleiner,\nfrowns upon such deviation from the dominant blank verse arrangement.\n\"On the Cowboys of the West\" is a brief bit of verse by this reviewer,\naccompanied by a note from the pen of Mr. Cole. The note is better than\nthe verse, and exhibits Mr. Cole's vivid and imaginative prose at its\nbest. \"The Sunflower\", a versified composition by James Laurence\nCrowley, concludes the issue. There is much attractiveness in the lines;\nthough we may discover particularly in the second stanza, that touch of\nexcessive softness which occasionally mars Mr. Crowley's work. No one\ncan fail to discern the weakness of such a line as \"You big giant of all\nthe flowers\".\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Providence Amateur= for February is worthy of particular attention\non account of Mr. Peter J. MacManus' absorbing article on \"The Irish and\nthe Fairies\". Mr. MacManus firmly believes not only that fairies exist\nin his native Ireland, but that he has actually beheld a troop of them;\nfacts which impart to this article a psychological as well as a literary\ninterest. The prose style of Mr. MacManus is very good, being notable\nalike for fluency and freedom from slang, whilst his taste is of the\nbest. His future work will be eagerly awaited by the amateur public.\nEdmund L. Shehan contributed both verse and prose to this issue. \"Death\"\nis a stately poem on a grave subject, whose sentiments are all of\nsuitable humility and dignity. The apparently anomalous pronoun \"her\",\nin the tenth line, is a misprint for \"he\". The piece ends with a rhyming\ncouplet, to which Mr. Kleiner, representing correct modern taste, takes\nmarked exception. The present reviewer, however, finds no reason to\nobject to any part of Mr. Shehan's poem, and attributes this concluding\ncouplet to the influence of similar Shakespearian terminations. The\nprose piece by Mr. Shehan well describes a visit to a cinematograph\nstudio, and is entitled \"The Making of a Motion Picture\". In the verses\nentitled \"A Post-Christmas Lament\", Mr. John T. Dunn combines much\nkeenness of wit with commendable regularity of metre. Mr. Dunn is among\nthe cleverest of the United's humorous writers. \"To Charlie of the\nComics\" is a harmless parody on our Laureate's excellent poem \"To Mary\nof the Movies\", which appeared some time ago in =The Piper=. In \"The\nBride of the Sea\", Mr. Lewis Theobald, Jr., presents a rather weird\npiece of romantic sentimentality of the sort afforded by bards of the\nearly nineteenth century. The metre is regular, and no flagrant\nviolations of grammatical or rhetorical precepts are to be discerned,\nyet the whole effort lacks clearness, dignity, inspiration, and poetic\nspontaneity. The word printed \"enhanc'd\" in the sixth stanza is properly\n\"entranc'd\".\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Tom Fool, Le Roi= bears no definite date, but is a sort of pensive\nautumn reverie following the Rocky Mount convention of last summer. This\ngrave and dignified journal is credited to the House of Tillery, and if\ntypographical evidence may be accepted, it belongs most particularly to\nthat branch now bearing the name of Renshaw and having its domain in\nCoffeeville, Mississippi. \"Mother Gooseries from the Convention\", by\nEmilie C. Holladay, is a long stanzaic and Pindaric ode, whose taste and\ntechnic are alike impeccable. The exalted images are sketched with\nartistic touch, whilst the deep underlying philosophy, skillfully\nclothed in well balanced lines, arouses a sympathetic reaction from\nevery cultural intellect. \"The Carnival\", by Mrs. E. L. Whitehead, is an\nadmirable example of stately descriptive prose mixed with aesthetic\nverse. The long and euphonious periodic sentences suggest the style of\nGibbon or of Dr. Johnson, whilst the occasional metrical lines remind\nthe reviewer of Dr. Young's solemn \"Night Thoughts\". \"Dummheit\", by Dora\nM. Hepner, is a grave discourse on Original Sin, describing the planning\nof =Tom Fool, Le Roi=. Elizabeth M. Ballou's article entitled \"Our\nAbsent Friend\" forms a notable contribution to amateur historical\nannals, and displays Miss Ballou as the possessor of a keen faculty for\nobservation, and a phenomenally analytical intellect. \"Banqueters from\nthe Styx\", Mrs. Renshaw's masterly description of the convention dinner\nand its honoured guests from the regions of Elysium and elsewhere,\nreminds the reviewer of the 11th book of the Odyssey and the 6th book of\nthe Aeneid, wherein the fraternizing of men with the shades of men is\nclassically delineated.\n\n=Tom Fool= is a memorable publication, suggesting the old \"fraternal\"\npapers, whose passing so many amateurs regret.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for November contains besides the official matter a\nsmall but select assortment of poems, prominent among which is \"The\nMeadow Cricket\", by Jas. T. Pyke. It is impossible to overestimate the\nbeauty of thought and expression which Mr. Pyke shows in all his verses,\nand the United is fortunate in being able to secure specimens of his\nwork.\n\n\"Remorse\", by James Laurence Crowley, is one of the best samples of this\ngentleman's poesy which we have yet seen, though Mr. Crowley insists\nthat one of the punctuation marks has been wrongfully located by the\nreviser. Since the present critic prepared the manuscript for\npublication, he is willing to assume full culpability for this crime.\nThere is genuine poetic feeling in this short piece; and it seems an\nundoubted fact that Mr. Crowley with a little added restraint and\ndignity of expression, is capable of producing excellent work. \"List to\nthe Sea\", by Winifred V. Jordan, is a delightfully musical lyric, whose\ndancing dactyls and facile triple rhymes captivate alike the fancy and\nthe ear. \"The Wind and the Beggar\", by Maude K. Barton, is sombre and\npowerful. \"Ambition\", by William de Ryee, is regular in metre and\ncommendable in sentiment, yet not exactly novel or striking in\ninspiration. \"Choose ye\", by Ella C. Eckert, is a moral poem of clever\nconception and correct construction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The United Official Quarterly= for January opens with \"A Prayer for the\nNew Year\", by Frederick R. Chenault. Mr. Chenault is a poet of the first\norder so far as inspiration is concerned, but his work is frequently\nmarred by irregularity of metre, and the use of assonance in place of\nrhyme. The metre of this poem is correct, but the two attempted rhymes\n\"deeper-meeker\" and \"supremely-sincerely\" are technically no more than\nassonant sounds. Pres. Fritter writes very powerfully on our publishing\nsituation in this number; and his article should not only be perused\nwith attention, but heeded with sincerity and industriousness.\n\n\"Behind the Canvas Wall\", by William J. Dowdell, is one of the cleverest\nand most ingenious bits of fiction which the amateur press has contained\nfor some time. That it is of a nature not exactly novel is but a trivial\nobjection. The homely, appealing plot, and the simple, sympathetic\ntreatment, both point to Mr. Dowdell as a possible success in the realm\nof short story writing, should he ever care to enter it seriously.\nAnother excellent tale is \"The Good Will of a Dog\", by P. J. Campbell.\nThe plot is of a well defined type which always pleases, whilst the\nincidents are graphically delineated. \"The Bookstall\" is a metrical\nmonstrosity by the present reviewer. Mr. Maurice W. Moe, the\ndistinguished Private Critic, lately gave us the following opinion of\nour verse. \"You are,\" he writes, \"steeped in the poetry of a certain\nage; an age, by the way, which cut and fit its thought with greater\nattention to one model than any other age before or since; and the\nresult is that when you turn to verse as a medium of expression, it is\njust as if you were pressing a button liberating a perfect flood of\nthese perfectly good but stereotyped formulae of expression. The result\nis very ingenious, but just because it is such a skillful mosaic of\nGeorgian 'rubber-stamp' phrases, it must ever fall short of true art.\"\nMr. Moe is correct. We have, in fact, heard this very criticism\nreiterated by various authorities ever since those prehistoric days when\nwe began to lisp in numbers. Yet somehow we perversely continue to\n\"mosaic\" along in the same old way! But then, we have never claimed to\npossess \"true art\"; we are merely a metrical mechanic. \"A New Point of\nView In Home Economics\", a clever article by Miss Eleanor Barnhart,\nconcludes the =Official Quarterly= proper.\n\nBut the =New Member= supplement, with its profusion of brilliant\ncredentials, yet remains to be considered. \"Dutch Courage\", by Louis E.\nBoutwell, is a liquorish sketch whose scene is laid in a New Jersey\ntemple of Bacchus. Being totally unacquainted with the true saloon\natmosphere, we find ourself a little embarrassed as to critical\nprocedure, yet we may justly say that the characters are all well drawn,\nevery man in his humor.\n\n\"Ol' Man Murdock\" is a quaint, and in two senses an =absorbing=, figure.\nThe rest of the issue is given over to the Muses of poesy. \"The Saturday\nFray\" is a clever piece by Daisy Vandenbank. The rhyming is a little\nuneven, and in one case assonance is made to answer for true rhyme.\n\"Cream\" and \"mean\" cannot make an artistic couplet. \"The Common\nSoldiers\", by John W. Frazer, is a poem of real merit; whilst \"Little\nBoy Blue\", by W. Hume, is likewise effective. Mr. Hume's pathetic touch\nis fervent and in no manner betrays that weakness bordering on the\nridiculous, to which less skillful flights of pathos are prone. \"The Two\nSprings\" is a pleasant moral sermon in verse by Margaret Ellen Cooper.\nConcluding the issue is \"The Under Dog in the Fight\", a vigorous\nphilosophical poem by Andrew Stevenson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for January is distinguished by Mrs. Winifred V. Jordan's\nbrilliant short poem entitled \"Oh, Where is Springtime?\" The sentiment\nof the piece is an universal one, and the pleasing lines will appeal to\nall. \"Retribution\", by Mrs. Ida C. Haughton, is a clever story, but the\npresent critic's extreme fondness for cats makes it difficult to review\nafter reading the first sentence. However, the well-approached\nconclusion is indeed just. The \"moral\" is a pathetic example of\nunregeneracy! Miss Edna M. Haughton's critical article is direct and\ndiscerning; the Woodbee Club is fortunate in having among its members so\ncapable a reviewer. Editor Fritter likewise mounts the reviewer's throne\nin this issue, proceeding first of all to demolish our own fond dream of\nyesterday; =The Conservative=. Looking backward down the dim vista of\nthose bygone but memory-haunted days of October, 1915, when we\nperpetrated the horribly plainspoken and frightfully ungentle number\nwhereof Mr. Fritter treats, we are conscious of our manifold sins, and\nmust beg the pardon of the liquor interests for shouting so rudely in\nthe cause of total abstinence. Pres. Fritter's critical style is a good\none, and is developing from month to month. His advocacy of lukewarmness\nin writing is perhaps not so complete as one might judge from this\narticle; though his use of the cautious phrase \"it is rumored\" in\nconnection with a well known statement seems hardly necessary. Rigid\nimpartiality, the critic's greatest asset, is manifest throughout the\nreview, and we thoroughly appreciate the favorable mention not\ninfrequently accorded us. In passing upon the merits of =Dowdell's\nBearcat=, Mr. Fritter shows equal penetration and perspicuity, and we\nare convinced that his rank amongst amateur reviewers is very high.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n                   THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n VOLUME XV    GEORGETOWN, ILL., JUNE, 1916    NUMBER 11\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Coyote= for July opens with Harry E. Rieseberg's verses entitled\n\"The Sum of Life\", whose structure is excellent as a whole, though\ndefective in certain places. The word \"mirage\" is properly accented on\nthe second syllable, hence is erroneously situated in the first stanza.\n\"A mirage forever seeming\" is a possible substitute line. Other defects\nare the attempted rhymes of \"decay\" with \"constancy\", \"carried\" with\n\"hurried\", and \"appalled\" with \"all\". The metre is without exception\ncorrect, and the thoughts and images in general well presented,\nwherefore we believe that with a little more care Mr. Rieseberg can\nbecome a very pleasing poet indeed. \"The Philippine Question\", by Earl\nSamuel Harrington, aged 15, is an excellent juvenile essay, and\nexpresses a very sound opinion concerning our Asiatic colonies. It is\ndifficult to be patient with the political idiots who advocate the\nrelinquishment of the archipelago by the United States, either now or at\nany future time. The mongrel natives, in whose blood the Malay strain\npredominates, are not and never will be racially capable of maintaining\na civilized condition by themselves. \"How Fares the Garden Rose?\" is a\npoem bearing the signature of Winifred Virginia Jordan, which is a\nsufficient guarantee of its thorough excellence. \"To a Breeze\", also by\nMrs. Jordan, is distinguished by striking imagery, and displays in the\nepithet \"moon-moored\", that highly individualistic touch which is\ncharacteristic of its author. \"Peace\", by Andrew Francis Lockhart, is a\npoem of excellent construction, though marred by two serious misprints\nwhich destroy the harmony of the first and third lines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Dixie Booster= for March-April is an exceedingly neat and clever\npaper from the House of Nixon. \"Spring in the South\", a poem by Maude K.\nBarton, opens the issue in pleasant fashion, the attractive images well\natoning for certain slight mechanical deficiencies. \"Dick's Success\", by\nGladys L. Bagg, is a short story whose phraseology exhibits considerable\ntalent and polish. The didactic element is possibly more emphasized than\nthe plot, though not to a tedious extent. Whether or not a rough draft\nof a novel may be completed in the course of a single afternoon, a feat\ndescribed in this tale, we leave for the fiction-writing members of the\nUnited to decide! Of the question raised regarding the treatment of the\nIndian by the white man in America it is best to admit in the words of\nSir Roger de Coverly, \"that much might be said on both sides\". Whilst\nthe driving back of the aborigines has indeed been ruthless and\nhigh-handed, it seems the destiny of the Anglo-Saxon to sweep inferior\nraces from his path wherever he goes. There are few who love the Indian\nso deeply that they would wish this continent restored to its original\ncondition, peopled by savage nomads instead of civilized colonists. \"The\nDeuce and Your Add\", by Melvin Ryder, is a bit of light philosophy whose\nallegorical case is well maintained. \"To a Warbler\", by Roy W. Nixon, is\na meritorious piece of verse whose rhythm moves with commendable\nsprightliness, though the first line of the first stanza might be made\nto correspond better with the first line of the second stanza. The word\n\"apparent\" in the last line, seems a little unsuited to the general\nstyle of the poem, being more suggestive of the formal type of\ncomposition. \"Grandma\", also by Mr. Roy Nixon, is a noble sonnet whose\nquality foreshadows real poetical distinction for its author. \"You\", by\nDora M. Hepner, contains sublime images, but possesses metrical\nimperfections. The general anapaestic or dactylic rhythm is much\ndisturbed by the iambic fourth line of the first stanza. The editorials,\njokes, and jingles in this issue are all clever, and proclaim Mr.\nRaymond Nixon as a capable and discriminating editor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Literary Buds= for February exhibits the amateurs of Harvey, Illinois,\nafter a long absence from the publishing arena. The present issue,\nedited by Mr. Caryl Wilson Dempesy, contains matter of merit and\ninterest. \"The Dells of the Wisconsin\", by A. Myron Lambert, is an\ninteresting account of an outing spent amidst scenes of natural grandeur\nand beauty. The author's style is fluent and pleasing, though a few\nslight crudities are to be discerned. On page 1, where the height of a\nlarge dam is mentioned, it is stated \"that the water must raise that\ndistance before it can fall\". Of course, \"=rise=\" is the verb which\nshould have been used. Another erroneous phrase is \"nature tract\".\n\"=Nature=\" is not an adjective, but a noun; \"=natural=\" is the correct\nword. However, this anomalous use of nouns for adjectives has only too\nmuch prevalence amongst all grades of writers today, and must not be too\nharshly censured in this case. On page 4 the word \"=onto=\" should be\nsupplanted by \"=upon=\", and the awkward phrase: \"to be convinced that we\nhad ventured to a place that we did not know any dangers were connected\nwith\", should be changed to something like this: \"to convince us that we\nhad ventured to a seemingly dangerous place whose apparent dangers we\nhad not then noticed\". \"A Song of Love\", by Editor Dempesy, is cast in\nuniformly flowing and regular metre, but some of the words require\ncomment. \"=Lover=\" is not generally applied by bards to adored members\nof the gentler sex, \"=love=\" being the conventional term. Likewise, the\nphrase \"heart which always softly does its beating\" might well be\nrevised with greater attention to poetical precedent. Yet the whole is\nof really promising quality, and exhibits a metrical correctness much\nabove the average. \"The Operation\" is a very witty sketch by Miss Clara\nI. Stalker, with a sudden turn toward the end which arouses the complete\nsurprise and unexpected mirth of the reader. \"The High Cost of\nFlivving\", by Albert Thompson, is a bright bit of versified humour\ninvolving novel interpretations of certain technical terms of\nliterature. The swinging dactylic rhythm is well managed except where\nthe words \"descending\" and \"ascending\" occur, and where, in line 24, the\nmetre becomes momentarily anapaestic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Looking Glass= for May is the final number of Mrs. Renshaw's\njournal of introductions, and makes known to the association a group of\n27 new members. One of the most interesting autobiographies is that of\nMr. J. E. Hoag of Greenwich, New York, whose friendly sentences, written\nfrom the cumulative experience of 85 years of life, possess an elusively\ncaptivating quality. Of the non-biographical matter in this issue, Mrs.\nRenshaw's compilation entitled \"Writing for Profit\" deserves particular\nperusal. This is well set off by the same author's colloquial lines,\n\"Pride O' The Pen\", wherein the lethal taint of trade in literature is\neffectively deplored. \"Something\", by David H. Whittier, is a thoughtful\nanalysis of conditions in the United, with suggestions for improvement.\n\"One Bright Star Enough For Me\", by Mr. John Hartman Oswald of Texas, is\na pious poem reminding one of Mr. Addison's well known effort which\nbegins: \"The spacious firmament on high\". We doubt, however, if Mr.\nAddison has been much improved upon, since several instances of\nimperfect poetical taste are to be found in Mr. Oswald's lines. But\nthere are evidences of a great soul throughout the ten stanzas, and the\nmetre is in the main correct. What Mr. Oswald appears to require is a\nthorough reading of the English classics, with minute attention to their\nphraseology and images. With such study we believe him capable of\ndevelopment into a poet of enviable force and sincerity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Toledo Amateur= for April marks the welcome reappearance of Mr. Wesley\nH. Porter's neat little journal after a year's absence. \"A Story\", by\nDavid H. Whittier, possesses a tragical plot whose interest is slightly\nmarred by triteness and improbable situations. Of the latter we must\npoint out the strained coincidence whereby four distinct things,\nproceeding from entirely unrelated causes, give rise to the final\ndenouement. The culmination of the aged father's resolve to kill his\nenemy, the conditions which make possible the return of the son, the\npresence of the enemy's hat and coat under the wayside tree, and the\nstorm which prompts the son to don these garments, are all independent\ncircumstances, whose simultaneous occurrence, each at exactly the proper\ntime to cause the catastrophe, may justly be deemed a coincidence too\ngreat for the purpose of good literature. In an artistically constructed\ntale, the various situations all develop naturally out of that original\ncause which in the end brings about the climax; a principle which, if\napplied to the story in question, would limit the events and their\nsequences to those arising either directly or indirectly from the wrong\ncommitted by the father's enemy. Since there is no causative connection\nbetween the immediate decision of the father to kill his foe, and the\ndevelopments or discoveries which enable the son to return, the\nsimultaneous occurrence of these unusual things is scarcely natural.\nSuperadded to this coincidence are two more extraneous events; the\nrather strange presence of the hat and coat near the road, and the\ntimely or untimely breaking of the storm, the improbability indeed\nincreasing in geometrical progression with each separate circumstance.\nIt must, however, be admitted that such quadruple coincidences in\nstories are by no means uncommon among even the most prominent and\nwidely advertised professional fiction-blacksmiths of the day. Mr.\nWhittier's style is that of a careful and sincere scholar, and we\nbelieve that his work will become notable in this and the succeeding\namateur journalistic generation. The minuteness of the preceding\ncriticism has been prompted not by a depreciatory estimate of his\npowers, but rather by an appreciative survey of his possibilities. \"Say,\nBrother\", by Mrs. Renshaw, is a poem describing life in the trenches of\nthe Huns. The metre is quite regular, and the plan of rhyming but once\nbroken. Mr. Porter's prose work; editorial, introductory, and narrative,\nis all pleasing, though, not wholly free from a certain slight looseness\nof scholarship. We should advise rigorous exercise in parsing and\nrhetoric. \"Respite\", by Edgar Ralph Cheyney, shows real poetical genius,\nand the iambic heptameters are very well handled, save where one\nredundant syllable breaks the flow of the last line. Even that would be\nperfect if the tongue could condense the noun and article \"the music\",\ninto \"th' music\".\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Tornado= for April constitutes the publishing debut of Mrs. Addie\nL. Porter, mother of =Toledo Amateur's= gifted young editor. Mrs.\nPorter's \"Recollections From Childhood\" are pleasant and well phrased,\nbringing to mind very vividly the unrivalled joys of Christmas as\nexperienced by the young. Wesley H. Porter, in \"My Vacation\", tells\nentertainingly of his visit to the hive of the Woodbees last September.\nThe editorial and news paragraphs are all of attractive aspect,\ncompleting a bright paper whose four pages teem with enthusiasm and\npersonality. It is to be hoped that other comparatively new United\nmembers may follow Mr. Porter's example in entering the publishing\nfield; for individual journals, though of no greater size than this, are\never welcome, and do more than anything else to maintain interest and\npromote progress in the association.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Trail= for April must by no means be confused with Alfred L.\nHutchinson's professionalized magazine of identical title, for this\n=Trail= is an older and emphatically non-professional publication issued\nco-operatively by Dora M. Hepner and George W. Macauley.\nNon-professionalism, indeed, seems to dominate the entire issue to a\ndegree unusual in the broadened and developed United. With the exception\nof one poem and one short story or sketch, the contents are wholly\npersonal and social. \"He Reached my Hand\", by Dora M. Hepner, is an\nexcellent piece of verse, though perhaps not of that extreme polish\nwhich is observed in the productions of very careful bards. Miss Hepner\nhas great refinement of fancy and vigour of expression, but evidently\nneglects to cultivate that beautiful rhetoric and exquisite rhythmic\nharmony which impress us so forcibly in the work of scholars and bookmen\nlike Rheinhart Kleiner. \"A Girl of the U. S.\", by George W. Macauley, is\na prose piece whose nature seems to waver between that of a story and a\ndescriptive sketch. Though description apparently preponderates, the\nnarrative turn toward the conclusion may sanction classification as\nfiction. The faults are all faults of imperfect technique rather than of\nbarren imagination, for Mr. Macauley wields a graphic pen, and adorns\nevery subject he approaches. In considering minor points, we must remark\nthe badly fractured infinitive \"to no longer walk\", and the unusual\nword \"reliefful\". We have never seen the latter expression before, and\nthough it may possibly be a modernism in good usage, it was certainly\nunknown in the days when we attempted to acquire our education. Mr.\nMacauley, with his marked descriptive ability, is less at ease in\nstories of contemporary life than in historical fiction, particularly\nmediaeval and Oriental tales. His genius is not unlike that of Sir\nWalter Scott, and shows to especial advantage in annals of knights and\nchivalry. \"Scratchings\" are by the pen of Miss Hepner, and display an\nactive wit despite the profusion of slang. It would seem, however, that\nso brilliant a writer could preserve the desired air of vivacity without\nquite so many departures from the standard idioms of our language.\n\nMiss Hepner's remarks on the assimilation of new United members are\nworthy of note. The cruder amateurs should not feel discouraged by the\nextraordinary average scholarship of the recent element, but should\nrather use it as a model for improvement. They should establish\ncorrespondence with the cultivated recruits, thereby not only benefiting\nthemselves, but helping each gifted newcomer to find a useful and\ncongenial place amongst us. The present situation is pitifully\nludicrous, for practically all young aspirants call upon only one or two\nsadly overburdened older members for literary aid, forgetting that there\nare scores of brilliant writers, teachers, and professors waiting\nanxiously but vainly to be of real service to their fellow-amateurs.\nSeveral of the scholarly new members have particularly inquired how they\ncan best assist the association; yet the association, as represented by\nits literary novices, has failed to take advantage of most of these\noffers of instructions and co-operation. We are impelled here to\nreiterate the slogan which Mr. Daas has so frequently printed in his\nvarious journals: \"=Welcome the Recruits!=\". Such a welcome is certain\nto react with double felicity upon the giver.\n\n\"From the Michigan Trail\" is Mr. Macauley's personal column, and\ncontains so bitter an attack on some of the United's policies of\nimprovement, that we are tempted to remonstrate quite loudly. The\ncaptious criticism of the Second Vice-President's invaluable activities,\nconstructive labours which have practically regenerated the association\nand raised it to a higher plane in the world of educational endeavour,\nis positively ungenerous. To speak of the article in =Ole Miss'=\nentitled \"Manuscripts and Silver\" as \"mercenary\", is the summit of\ninjustice, for it was nothing more or less than the absolutely\ngratuitous offer to the United of what is now the Symphony Literary\nService. We are rather at a loss to divine Mr. Macauley's precise notion\nof amateur journalism. He speaks of it as a \"tarn\", but we cannot\nbelieve he would have it so stagnant a thing as that name implies.\nSurely, the United is something greater than a superficial fraternal\norder composed of mediocre and unambitious dabblers. Progress leads\ntoward the outside world of letters, and to cavil at work such as Mrs.\nRenshaw's is to set obstacles in the path of progress. Professional\nliterary success on the part of amateur journalists can never react\nunfavorably on the United, and it seems far from kind and proper to\nimpede the development of members. Why is a professional author\nnecessarily less desirable as an amateur journalist than a professional\nplumber or boiler-maker? But there is one sound principle at the base of\nMr. Macauley's argument, which deserves more emphasis than the points he\nelaborates. Professionalism must not enter into the workings of the\nassociation, nor should the professionalized amateur take advantage of\namateur connexions to create a market for writings otherwise unsalable.\nThis applies to the now happily extinct tribe of \"ten-cents-a-year\"\npublishers, who coolly expected all amateur journalists to subscribe to\ntheir worthless misprints as a matter of fraternal obligation. Mr.\nMacauley is an extremist on the subject of amateur rating, a fact which\nexplains many otherwise puzzling allusions in his current editorials.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for February is the final number of the Daas regime,\nand constitutes a noble valedictory indeed. We find it impossible to\nexpress with sufficient force our regret at the withdrawal of Mr. Daas\nfrom the United, and we can but hope that the retirement may prove\nmerely temporary. The February official organ is wholly literary in\ncontents, and in quality sustains the best traditions of amateur\njournalism. Miss Olive G. Owen's poem, \"Give us Peace!\", which opens\nthe issue, is tasteful in imagery and phraseology, and correct in rhyme\nand metre, but contains the customary unrealities and substitutions of\nemotion for reasoning which are common to all pacific propaganda. \"The\nLittle Old Lady's Dream\", by M. Almedia Bretholl, is a short story of\nthe almost unpleasantly \"realistic\" type, whose development and\natmosphere exhibit much narrative talent and literary skill. \"The\nTeuton's Battle-Song\" is an attempt of the present critic to view the\nprinciples of human warfare without the hypocritical spectacles of\nsentimentality. \"Nature in Literature\", by Arthur W. Ashby, is an essay\nof unusual quality, revealing a depth of well assimilated scholarship\nand a faculty for acute observation and impartial analysis, of which few\namateur writers may justly boast. \"His All\", is an excellent poem by\nMrs. Ella Colby Eckert, distinguished equally for its noble thought and\nfacile rhythm. \"'Twixt the Red and the White\", a short story by Miss\nCoralie Austin, displays marked skill in construction and phraseology,\nthough its development is not without a few of the typical crudities of\nyouthful work. There is a trifling suspicion of triteness and banality\nin plot and dialogue; which is, however, compensated for in the artistic\npassages so frequently encountered. \"Romance, Mystery, and Art\", an\nessay by Edgar Ralph Cheyney, reflects the learning and thoughtfulness\nof its author. The poetical fragments entitled \"Songs from Walpi\", by\nMrs. Winifred V. Jordan, describe the hopeless affection of a\nSouthwestern Indian prince for a maiden of the conquering white race.\nThe atmosphere and images are cleverly wrought, whilst the rhythm is in\nevery detail satisfactory. \"Nescio Quo\", by Kathleen Baldwin, is a poem\nof great attractiveness both in structure and sentiment. \"A Crisis\", by\nEleanor J. Barnhart, is a short story of distinctly modern type, whose\nsubstance and development compare well with professional work. \"My Heart\nand I\", a sonnet by James T. Pyke, exhibits the skill and philosophical\nprofundity characteristic of its author. \"My Native Land\", a poem by\nAdam Dickson, describes the Scottish Border with pleasing imagery and\nbounding anapaestic metre. Mr. Dickson is a poet whose progress should\nbe carefully watched. His improvement is steady, the present piece being\neasily the best specimen of his work to appear in the amateur press.\n\"Poetry and its Power\", by Helen M. Woodruff, is a delightful essay\ncontaining liberal quotations from various classic bards. \"A\nResolution\", by Harry Z. Moore, seems to be modelled after Mrs.\nRenshaw's well known poem, \"A Symphony\". The various precepts are\nwithout exception sound and commendable. Helene E. Hoffman presents a\nbrief but pleasing critique of Sir Thomas Browne's \"Hydriotaphia,\nUrn-Burial; or a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in\nNorfolk\". It is refreshing to discover a modern reader who can still\nappreciate the quaint literature of the seventeenth century, and Miss\nHoffman is to be thanked for her sympathetic review of the pompous,\nLatinised phrases of the old physician. \"He and She\", by Margaret A.\nRichard, is a thoroughly meritorious poem whose two \"allowable rhymes\",\n\"fair-dear\", and \"head-prayed\", would be censured only by a critic of\npunctilious exactitude. \"At Sea\", a witty bit of =vers de societe= by\nHenry Cleveland Wood, forms an appropriately graceful conclusion to a\nrichly enjoyable issue of the magazine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for March brings to the fore Mr. George S.\nSchilling's unusual editorial talent, and makes manifest the bright\nfuture of the official organ for the balance of the present\nadministrative year. The chief literary contribution is \"Hail, Autumn!\",\none of Mr. Arthur Ashby's brilliant and scholarly essays on Nature. The\nquality of Mr. Ashby's work deserves particular attention for its\nreflective depth of thought, and glowing profusion of imagery. His style\nis remarkably mature, and escapes completely that subtle suggestion of\nthe schoolboy's composition which seems inseparable from the average\namateur's attempts at natural description and philosophizing. Mr.\nSchilling's editorials are forcible and straightforward, vibrant with\nenthusiasm for the welfare of the association. \"A Representative\nOfficial Organ\", by Paul J. Campbell, serves to explain the author's\nhighly desirable constitutional amendment proposed for consideration at\nthe coming election, which will open the columns of THE UNITED AMATEUR\nto the general membership at a very reasonable expense. The News Notes\nin the present issue are sprightly and interesting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for April is made brilliant by the presence of Henry\nClapham McGavack's terse and lucid exposure of hyphenated hypocrisy,\nentitled \"Dr. Burgess, Propagandist\". Mr. McGavack's phenomenally virile\nand convincing style is supported by a remarkable fund of historical and\ndiplomatic knowledge, and the feeble fallacies of the pro-German embargo\nadvocates collapse in speedy fashion before the polished but vigorous\nonslaughts of his animated pen. Another essay inspired by no superficial\nthinking is Edgar Ralph Cheyney's \"Nietzschean Philosophy\", wherein some\nof the basic precepts of the celebrated iconoclast are set forth in\ncomprehensive array. \"The Master Voice of Ages Calls for Peace\", a poem\nby Mrs. Frona Scott, has fairly regular metre, though its sentiment is\none of conventional and purely emotional pacifism. \"A Gentle Satire on\nFriendship\", by Freda de Larot, is a very clever piece of light prose;\nwhich could, however, be improved by the deletion of much slang, and the\nrectification of many loose constructions. \"A Wonderful Play\" is Mrs.\nEloise R. Griffith's well worded review of Jerome K. Jerome's \"The\nPassing of the Third Floor Back\", as enacted by Forbes-Robertson. Mrs.\nGriffith has here, as in all her essays, achieved a quietly pleasing\neffect, and pointed a just moral. \"Fire Dreams\" is a graphic and\ncommendably regular poem by Mrs. Renshaw. \"The Beach\", a poem by O. M.\nBlood, requires grammatical emendation. \"How better could the hours been\nspent\" and \"When life and love true pleasure brings\" cannot be excused\neven by the exigencies of rhyme and metre. After the second stanza, the\ncouplet form shifts in an unwarranted manner to the quatrain\narrangement. The phraseology of the entire piece displays poetical\ntendencies yet reveals a need for their assiduous cultivation through\nreading and further practice. \"My Shrine\", by James Laurence Crowley,\nexhibits real merit both in wording and metre, yet has a rather weak\nthird stanza. The lines:\n\n    \"One day I crossed the desert sands;\n    One day I ride my train;\"\n\nare obviously anticlimactic. To say that the subject is trite would be a\nlittle unjust to Mr. Crowley's Muse, for all amatory themes, having been\nworked over since the very dawn of poesy, are necessarily barren of\npossibilities save to the extremely skilled metrist. Contemporary\nlove-lyrics can scarcely hope to shine except through brilliant and\nunexpected turns of wit, or extraordinarily tuneful numbers. The\nfollowing lines by Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, who died in 1673,\nwell express the situation despite their crudeness:\n\n    \"O Love, how thou art tired out with rhyme!\n    Thou art a tree whereon all poets climb;\n    And from thy branches every one takes some\n    Of the sweet fruit, which Fancy feeds upon.\n    But now thy tree is left so bare and poor,\n    That they can hardly gather one plum more!\"\n\n\"Indicatory\", a brilliant short sketch by Ethel Halsey, well illustrates\nthe vanity of the fair, and completes in pleasing fashion a very\ncreditable number of our official magazine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for May forms still another monument to the taste and\nenergy of our official editor, Mr. Schilling. Biography is the keynote\nof the current issue, Mrs. Renshaw, Mr. J. E. Hoag, and Mr. Henry\nCleveland Wood each receiving mention. Miss Emilie C. Holladay displays\na pleasing prose style in her account of our Second Vice-President, and\narouses interest with double force through the introduction of juvenile\nincidents.\n\n\"Happiness Defined\" is a delightful little sketch by Ida C. Haughton,\nwhose philosophy will awake an universal response from the breasts of\nthe majority. \"The Wind Fairies\", by Jean F. Barnum, is a poem in prose\nwhich contains more of the genuine poetic essence than does the average\ncontemporary versified effort. The grace and grandeur of the clouds and\nthe atmosphere have in all ages been admired, and it is but natural that\nthey figure to a great extent in the beautiful legends of primitive\nmythology. \"The Ship that Sails Away\", by J. E. Hoag, is a delicate and\nattractive poem whose images and phraseology are equally meritorious.\nMr. Hoag's poetical attainments are such that we await with eagerness\nthe appearance of the pieces predicted in his biography. \"To Flavia\", by\nChester Pierce Munroe, is a sweet lyric addressed to a young child and\npervaded throughout with a quaintly whimsical, almost Georgian,\nsemblance of stately gallantry. The first word of the seventeenth line\nshould read \"=small=\" instead of \"=swell=\". As misprinted, this line\nconveys a rather incongruous impression. \"Mountains in Purple Robes of\nMist\", a vivid and powerful poem of Nature by Rev. Eugene B. Kuntz, is\ncast in Alexandrine quatrains, a rather uncommon measure. The only\npossible defect is in line thirteen, where the accent of the word\n\"sublime\" seems to impede the flow of the metre. Line nineteen\napparently lacks two syllables, but the deficiency is probably\nsecretarial or typographical rather than literary. \"Man as Cook\", also\nby Dr. Kuntz, is a clever bit of humorous verse in octosyllabic\ncouplets. \"Consolation\" well exhibits Andrew Francis Lockhart's\nremarkable progress as a poet. His verse is increasing every day in\npolish, and is fast becoming one of the most pleasing and eagerly\nawaited features of amateur letters. \"At the End of the Road\", by Mary\nFaye Durr, is a graphic and touching description of a deserted\nschoolhouse. The atmosphere of pensive reminiscence is well sustained by\nthe judiciously selected variety of images and allusions. \"There's None\nLike Mine at Home\", by James Laurence Crowley, is a characteristic bit\nof Crowleian sentimentality which requires revision and condensation.\nThere is not enough thought to last out three stanzas of eight lines\neach. Technically we must needs shudder at the apparent incurable use of\n\"m-n\" assonance. \"Own\" and \"known\" are brazenly and repeatedly flaunted\nwith \"roam\" and \"home\" in attempted rhyme. But the crowning splendour of\nimpossible assonance is attained in the \"Worlds-girls\" atrocity. Mr.\nCrowley needs a long session with the late Mr. Walker's well-known\nRhyming Dictionary! Metrically, Mr. Crowley is showing a decided\nimprovement of late. The only censurable points in the measure of this\npiece are the redundant syllables in lines 1 and 3, which might in each\ncase be obviated by the substitution of \"=I've=\" for \"=I have=\", and the\nchange of form in the first half of the concluding stanza. Of the\ngeneral phraseology and imagery we may only remark that Mr. Crowley has\nmuch to forget, as well as to learn, before he can compete with Mr.\nKleiner or other high-grade amatory poets in the United. Such\nexpressions as \"my guiding star\", \"my own dear darling Kate\", or \"she's\nthe sweetest girl that e'er on earth did roam\", tell the whole sad story\nto the critical eye and ear. If Mr. Crowley would religiously eschew the\npopular songs and magazine \"poetry\" of the day, and give over all his\ntime to a perusal of the recognized classics of English verse, the\nresult would immediately be reflected in his own compositions. As yet,\nhe claims to be independent of scholarly tradition, but we must remind\nhim of the Latin epigram of Mr. Owen, which Mr. Cowper thus translated\nunder the title of \"Retaliation\":\n\n    \"The works of ancient bards divine,\n      Aulus, thou scorn'st to read;\n    And should posterity read thine,\n      It would be strange indeed!\"\n\nSo energetic and prolific a writer as Mr. Crowley owes it alike to\nhimself and to his readers to develop as best he can the talent which\nrests latent within him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for April opens with a melodious poem by Adam Dickson,\nentitled \"Love\". While the metre might well be changed in the interests\nof uniformity, the general effect is not at all harsh, and the author is\nentitled to no small credit for his production. The only other poem in\nthe magazine is \"Alone With Him\", by Mrs. Ida C. Haughton. This piece is\nremarkable for its rhyming arrangement, each rhyme being carried through\nfour lines instead of the usual couplet. The sentiments are just, the\nimages well drawn, and the technique correct; the whole forming a highly\ncommendable addition to amateur literature. \"The Melody and Colour of\n'The Lady of Shalott'\", by Mary Faye Durr, is a striking Tennysonian\ncritique, whose psychological features, involving a comparison of\nchromatic and poetic elements, are ingenious and unusual. Miss Durr is\nobviously no careless student of poesy, for the minute analyses of\nvarious passages give evidence of thorough assimilation and intelligent\ncomprehension. \"On Being Good\", by Newton A. Thatcher, contains sound\nsense and real humour, whilst its pleasingly familiar style augurs well\nfor Mr. Thatcher's progress in this species of composition. \"War\nReflections\", by Herbert Albing, is an apt and thoughtful epitome of the\ncompensating benefits given to mankind by the present belligerent\ncondition of the world. The cogent and comprehensive series of reviews\nby Miss Edna M. Haughton, and the crisp and pertinent paragraphs by\nEditor Fritter, combine with the rest of =The Woodbee's= contents to\nproduce an issue uniformly meritorious.\n\n                                                  H.

P. LOVECRAFT.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    AUGUST 1916\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\nFIRST ANNUAL REPORT 1915-1916.\n\nFollowing a novel idea originated by the present Columbus\nadministration, the Department of Public Criticism will herewith submit\nfor the first time in its history an annual report, or summary of the\npreceding year's literary events within the United Amateur Press\nAssociation.\n\nThe programme of improvement informally decided upon in the official\nyear of 1913-1914 received its definite ratification at the Rocky Mount\nConvention, when the assembled representatives of the United pledged\n\"Individual collective support\" to Mr. Fritter, the new President, in\nhis endeavors to raise the literary standard of our society, and when an\nabsolutely unanimous vote invested Mrs. J. W. Renshaw, the leading\nspirit of progress, with the important office of Second Vice-President.\nPres. Fritter has since discharged his obligations and sustained his\nresponsibilities in a thoroughly satisfactory manner despite many trying\ndifficulties, whilst Mrs. Renshaw, as a recruiter, has succeeded in\nlaying the foundations of a completely broadened, elevated, and\nrejuvenated association. Yet all that has been accomplished is merely\nthe prologue of that greater period of change which must bring about the\nfinal assimilation of Mrs. Renshaw's phenomenally gifted recruits, and\nthe materialization of the still nebulous plans evolved during the past\ntwelvemonth.\n\nThe undersigned has on several occasions advocated the formation of a\nregular \"Department of Instruction\" in the United, to be conducted by\nprofessional teachers and college instructors for the purpose of guiding\nthe more or less inexperienced members. He has communicated his idea to\nseveral high-school preceptors of great ability, and has learned that\nunder present conditions such a department is not perfectly feasible. It\nhas been suggested that if each experienced and educated amateur would\nassume a personal and sympathetic advisory position toward some one of\nthe younger or cruder members, much actual good might result. As our\nlist now stands, the crude and the cultured are perhaps evenly balanced,\nyet instant success even in this modified course can scarcely be\nexpected. At least another year seems to be required, in which the\nvarious members may gain a closer knowledge of each other through the\nwider diffusion of their printed efforts. However, the need for a more\nuniformly educated membership is pressing, and the undersigned will\nwelcome aid or advice of any kind from those willing to assist him in\nestablishing some sort of scholastic Department.\n\nAnother idea which has received undeserved neglect and discouraging\nopposition is the Authors' Placing Bureau or \"United Literary Service\",\nas outlined by the Second Vice-President. The normal goal of the amateur\nwriter is the outside world of letters, and the United should certainly\nbe able to provide improved facilities for the progress of its members\ninto the professional field. The objections offered to this plan are\napparently less vital than those affecting the Department of\nInstruction, and it is to be hoped that the mistaken zeal of our\nnon-professional sticklers may not serve to prevent a step so sorely\nneeded.\n\nPassing on to the details of Departmental work, the undersigned is\npleased to report a remarkable increase in the literary value of the\ncompositions brought forth in the United this year; an increase which\nmay be fairly declared to constitute a true elevation of our\nintellectual standard, and which undoubtedly compensates for the present\nregrettable paucity of amateur publishing media. In verse, particularly,\nis the advance notable. Some of our poets are securing recognition in\nthe outside world of letters, whilst many lesser bards show a steady\nupward trend in their amateur efforts. Prose continues to suffer because\nof the seemingly unavoidable brevity of the average amateur journal. It\nis impossible to crowd any really well developed piece of prose within\nthe limits generally assigned, hence our best authors seem almost to be\ndriven into verse as a medium of expression. Financial prosperity of\nsufficient extent to ensure the publication of larger papers is\nobviously the only remedy for this deplorable condition.\n\nOf our poets, the Laureate Rheinhart Kleiner (also Laureate of the\nNational for 1916-1917) continues as the foremost technician and\nharmonist. His accurate and tasteful lines satisfy the ear and the\nunderstanding with equal completeness, and he shows no sign of yielding\nto the corrupting influences of decadent modern standards. In his own\njournal, =The Piper=, he reveals a versatile and phenomenally well\nstocked mind. The September number, containing imitations of the work of\nother amateur poets, will long be remembered. Mrs. Renshaw maintains her\nhigh place as a philosophical and expressionistic bard, though hampered\nby unusual theories of spontaneous versification. A greater deference to\nthe human ear and metrical sense would render her already lofty poetry\nas attractive as it is exalted. Miss Olive G. Owen, former Laureate, has\nlately returned to activity, and may well be expected to duplicate her\nformer successes in the domain of the Muses. The poetical progress of\nAndrew Francis Lockhart is a notable feature of amateur letters this\nyear. Mr. Lockhart has always possessed the true genius of the bard,\nwriting ably and voluminously; but his recent technical care is bringing\nout hitherto undiscovered beauties in his verse, and placing him in the\nvery front rank of United poets. \"Benediction\" and \"Consolation\" are\nvastly above the average.\n\nOf the new poets of prime magnitude who have risen above our horizon\nduring the past year, Mrs. Winifred Virginia Jordan of Newton Centre,\nMass., deserves especial mention both for high quality and great volume\nof work. Mrs. Jordan's poetry is of a tunefully delicate and highly\nindividualistic sort which has placed it in great demand amongst amateur\neditors, and it is not unlikely that the author may be rewarded with a\nLaureateship at no distant date. The work is invariably of spontaneously\ngraceful rhythm and universally pleasing in sentiment, having frequently\nan elusive suggestion of the unreal. A few of Mrs. Jordan's poems are of\nthe grimly weird and powerful variety. \"The Song of the North Wind\" is a\nremarkable contribution to amateur letters, and has won the enthusiastic\nadmiration of the United's poetical element. Professional success has\nrecently crowned the efforts of Mrs. Jordan. =Weekly Unity= for June 17\ncontains her lines on \"The Singing Heart\", whilst several other poems\nfrom her pen have been accepted by =The National Magazine=. Rev. James\nTobey Pyke is another poet of the first order whose writings have lately\nenriched the literature of the United. His style is correct, and his\nthought deep and philosophical. \"The Meadow Cricket\" is a poem which\ndeserved more than a superficial perusal. John Russell, formerly of\nScotland but now of Florida, is a satirist and dialect writer of\nenviable talent. His favorite measure is the octosyllabic couplet, and\nin his skilled hands this simple metre assumes a new and sparkling\nlustre. Rev. Frederick Chenault is a prolific lyrical poet whose\nsentiments are of uniform loftiness. The substitution of exact rhyme for\nassonance in his lines would double the already immense merit of his\nwork. Other new bards of established ability are W. S. Harrison,\nKathleen Baldwin, Eugene B. Kuntz, Mary Evelyn Brown, Henry Cleveland\nWood, John W. Frazier, William Hume, Ella Colby Eckert, J. E. Hoag,\nEdgar Ralph Cheyney, Margaret A. Richard, William de Ryee, Helen H.\nSalls, and Jeanette Aylworth.\n\nOf the poets whom we may term \"rising\", none presents a more striking\nfigure than Ira A. Cole of Bazine, Kansas. Previously well known as a\nprose writer and publisher, he made his debut as a metrist just a year\nago, through a very beautiful piece in the heroic couplet entitled \"A\nDream of the Golden Age\". Mr. Cole is one of the few survivors of the\ngenuine classic school, and constitutes a legitimate successor to the\nlate Georgian poets. His development has been of extraordinary rapidity,\nand he will shortly surprise the amateur public both by a poetic drama\ncalled \"The Pauper and the Prince\", and by a long mythological poem not\nunlike Moore's \"Lalla Rookh\". The natural and pantheistic character of\nMr. Cole's philosophy adapts him with phenomenal grace to his position\nas a mirror of classical antiquity. Another developing poet is Mr. Roy\nWesley Nixon of Florida. \"Grandma\", his latest published composition, is\na sonnet of real merit. Adam Dickson, a Scotsman by birth, but now a\nresident of Los Angeles, writes tunefully and pleasantly. His pieces are\nnot yet of perfect polish, but each exhibits improvement over the\npreceding. He tends to favor the anapaest and the iambic tetrameter.\nMrs. Ida Cochran Haughton of Columbus is scarcely a novice, but her\nlatest pieces are undeniably showing a great increase of technical\ngrace. Chester Pierce Munroe of North Carolina is a delicate amatory\nlyrist of the Kleiner type. He has the quaint and attractive Georgian\ntouch, particularly evident in \"To Flavia\" and \"To Chloris\". Miss M.\nEstella Shufelt is absolutely new to the kingdom of poesy, yet has\nalready produced work of phenomenal sweetness and piety. Mrs. E. L.\nWhitehead, though formerly confined wholly to prose, has entered the\npoetical field with intelligent and discriminating care. Her words are\nthoughtfully weighed and selected, whilst her technique has rapidly\nassumed a scholarly exactitude. Two new poets whose work requires much\ntechnical improvement are Mrs. Agnes R. Arnold and Mr. George M.\nWhiteside. Mr. Whiteside has indications of qualities not far remote\nfrom genius, and would be well repaid by a rigorous course of study.\nMessrs. John Hartman Oswald and James Laurence Crowley are both gifted\nwith a fluency and self-sufficiency which might prove valuable assets in\na study of poesy. W. F. Booker of North Carolina possesses phenomenal\ngrace, which greater technical care would develop into unusual power.\nRev. Robert L. Selle, D. D., of Little Rock, Arkansas, is inspired by\nsincerest religious fervor, and has produced a voluminous quantity of\nverse whose orthodoxy is above dispute. Mrs. Maude K. Barton writes\nfrequently and well, though her technical polish has not yet attained\nits maximum. John Osman Baldwin of Ohio is a natural poet of spontaneous\ngrace, though requiring cultivation in correct style.\n\nFrom the foregoing estimate it may easily be gathered that imperfect\ntechnique is the cardinal sin of the average amateur poet. We have among\nus scores of writers blest with beautiful thoughts and attractive\nfluency, yet the number of precise versifiers may be counted on one's\nfingers. Our association needs increased requirements in classic\nscholarship and literary exactitude. At present, it is impossible for an\nimpartial critic to give unstinted approval to the technique of any well\nknown United poet save Rheinhart Kleiner.\n\nTurning to the consideration of our prose writers, the undersigned finds\nit difficult to render a true judgment, owing to the adverse conditions\nmentioned earlier in this report. Many fluent pens are doubtless cramped\ninto feebleness through want of space.\n\nFiction is among us the least developed of all the branches of\nliterature. Really good stories are rare phenomena, whilst even\nmediocrity is none too common. The best short stories of the year are\nprobably those by M. Almedia Bretholl and Eleanor Barnhart; the others\nare mainly juvenile work. Roy W. Nixon and Miss Coralie Austin represent\nthe extremes of excitement and tameness, with \"A Bottle of Carbolic\nAcid\" on the one hand, and with \"Jane\" and \"'Twixt the Red and the\nWhite\" on the other. Both of these authors possess substantial ability.\nDavid H. Whittier is developing along classic lines, and will be a\nprominent figure in the next generation of amateur journalists. Mr.\nMoe's pupils are all good story-tellers, the work of Miss Gladys L. Bagg\nstanding forth quite prominently this year. Florence Brugger's \"Tale of\nthe Sea\" is a graphic narrative from a youthful pen, as is William\nDowdell's \"Behind the Canvas Wall\", in a somewhat different way.\nHenriette and Florenz Ziegfeld have each contributed excellent work, nor\nmust Mary M. Sisson's \"Tempora Mutantur\" be forgotten.\n\nThe rather loosely defined domain of the \"sketch\" has thriven this year,\nsince it elicits fluent expression from those less prolific in other\nbranches of literature. Mr. Melvin Ryder has entertained us with an\nentire magazine of this sort of material, whilst Mrs. Ida C. Haughton,\nIrene Metzger, Benjamin Repp, Mary Faye Durr, Ethel Halsey, Clara Inglis\nStalker, Freda de Larot, Helene E. Hoffman Cole, Helen M. Woodruff, Ira\nA. Cole, and Eloise N. Griffith prove no less entertaining with shorter\nsketches.\n\nCriticism is well represented by Leo Fritter, Edna M. Haughton, Mrs.\nJ. W. Renshaw, and Rheinhart Kleiner. The latter is no less gifted a\ncritic than a poet, and gives out very acute judgments in his journal,\n=The Piper=.\n\nIn viewing the formal essays of the year, one is impressed with the\nprofusion of mere schoolboy compositions. Masters of the Addisonian art\nare few but those few almost atone for the general lack of polish. Henry\nClapham McGavack leads the list with a clarity of style and keenness of\nreasoning unsurpassed in the association. His \"Dr. Burgess,\nPropagandist\" is an amateur classic. Edgar Ralph Cheyney is an extreme\nradical, but is none the less a masterful essayist. His articles take a\nvery high rank both for thoughtfulness and for diction. A third writer\nof unusual power and analytical depth is Arthur W. Ashby, whose essays\non the varied aspects of Nature command our serious attention. The two\nSchillings, George and Samuel, deserve more than a passing mention,\nwhilst Pres. Fritter's Laureateship well attests his merit. Rev. E. P.\nParham has produced work of attractive quality. Joseph W. Renshaw's\nessays and editorials command notice whenever beheld; whilst Ira A.\nCole, ever versatile, will shortly display his epistolary skill in the\nnow unpublished series of \"Churchill-Tutcombie Letters\". William T.\nHarrington has progressed by leaps and bounds to a prominent place\namongst our essay-writers, his able encomiums of Old England being a\ndelightful feature of the year. It would be gratifying to speak of\nMaurice W. Moe's splendid style and terse English at this point, for he\nis one of our very foremost essayists; but his enforced inactivity in\namateur journalism this year has deprived us of any current specimens\nsave the brief editorial in the February =Pippin=.\n\nThe general quality of our prose is by no means satisfactory. Too many\nof our authors are contaminated with modern theories which cause them to\nabandon grace, dignity, and precision, and to cultivate the lowest forms\nof slang.\n\nPapers and magazines have been neither ample nor numerous this year; in\nfact, the tendency of the times appears to be a centralization of effort\nin THE UNITED AMATEUR; something which is for many reasons to be\napplauded, and for a few reasons to be deplored. Those members who feel\ncapable of issuing individual papers should be encouraged to do so;\nwhilst those who are ordinarily silent, should be encouraged to join the\ncontributing staff of THE UNITED AMATEUR as provided by the Campbell\namendment.\n\nThe best individual journal of the year is =Ole Miss'=. For frequency\nand regularity, =The Scot=, =The Woodbee=, =The Dixie Booster=, and =The\nCoyote= are to be commended. THE UNITED AMATEUR has prospered as a\nmonthly despite adverse conditions. The elaborate September, October and\nFebruary numbers put us in deep debt to Mr. Edward F. Daas, while\nsubsequent examples of good editorship must be accredited to Mr. George\nSchilling. It is gratifying to note the increasing literary character of\nthe Official Organ; purely official numbers are invariably tedious, many\nof the long, detailed reports being quite superfluous. It is a strong\nand sincere hope of the undersigned, that Mr. Daas may rejoin us at and\nafter the present convention. The resumption of =The Lake Breeze= would\nsupply a pressing need. Mr. Moitoret's =Cleveland Sun=, which promises\nto be a frequently issued paper, made its first appearance lately, and\nwill, after much of its \"loudness\" has been removed, be of substantial\nbenefit to new members. The \"sporting\" features should be eliminated at\nonce, as not only being in bad taste, but exerting a noxious influence\nover the literary development of the younger members.\n\nWhile upon the subject of papers, the undersigned would like to enter a\nrenewed protest against the persistent use of certain distorted forms of\nspelling commonly called \"simplified\". These wretched innovations,\npopular amongst the less educated element during the past decade, are\nnow becoming offensively prominent in certain periodicals of supposedly\nbetter grade, and require concerted opposition on the part of all\nfriends of our language. The advantages claimed for the changes are\nalmost wholly unsubstantial, whilst the inevitable disadvantages are\nimmense. Let us see fewer \"thrus\" and \"thoros\" in the amateur press!\n\nWhat the association needs above all things is a return to earlier forms\nin prose and verse alike; to poetry that does not pain the ear, and\nparagraphs that do not affront the aesthetic sense of the reader. If our\nwriters would pay more attention to the tasteful Georgian models, they\nwould produce work of infinitely less cacophonous quality. Almost every\none of our authors who is familiar with the literature of the past, is\ndistinguished by exceptional grace and fluency of composition.\n\nAs this report draws toward its conclusion, a few minor aims of the\nDepartment of Public Criticism are to be noted. It is now the desire of\nthe undersigned to aid authors in rectifying the injustices to which\nthey are subjected by the wretched typography of most amateur journals.\nWriters are hereby encouraged to transmit to this Department corrected\ncopies of all misprinted work, the corrections to be made public in THE\nUNITED AMATEUR. By this method it is hoped that no amateur journalist\nwill again be forced to suffer for faults not his own, as so many have\nsuffered in the past. Of course, the critical reports themselves are\nfrequently misprinted, but the vast majority of mistakes may with care\nbe eliminated.\n\nConcerning the name of this association, which a number wish changed in\na manner that will eliminate the word \"amateur\", the undersigned feels\nthat the sentiment of the veteran element is too strongly against such a\nmove to warrant its immediate adoption. The primary object is the\ntraining of young writers before they have attained the professional\ngrade, wherefore the present title is by no means such a misnomer as\nmight be inferred from the talents of the more cultivated members.\nHowever, the proposed alteration is certainly justified in many ways,\nhence the idea should be deferred rather than abandoned altogether.\n\nThe wane of interest in amateur political affairs is to be commended as\na recognition of the superior importance of literary matters. Amateur\njournalism is rapidly progressing nearer and nearer its ideal: a device\nfor the instruction of the young and crude, and an aid for the obscure\nauthor of any sort, rather than a playground for the aimless and the\nfrivolous.\n\nLast of all, the undersigned wishes to thank the membership for its kind\nreception of the Department's reports. It is ever the Chairman's design\nto render impartial judgment, and if harshness or captiousness may at\nany time have been noticed in the reports, it has in each case been\nunintentional. An ideal of sound conservatism has been followed, but in\nno instance has the critic sought to enforce upon others that peculiarly\narchaic style of which he is personally fond, and which he is accustomed\nto employ in his own compositions. The Department of Public Criticism\naspires to be of substantial assistance to the members of the United,\nand hopes next year to co-operate with Mr. Lockhart in presenting\nreviews of truly constructive quality.\n\nSolicitous for the approval, and confident of the indulgence of the\nassociation, the Department herewith has the honor to conclude its first\nannual report; in the hope that such a summary of events and estimate of\nconditions may be of use to the incoming administration.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    SEPTEMBER 1916\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Amateur Special= for July is a voluminous magazine of credentials\nand other work of new members, edited by Mrs. E. L. Whitehead, retiring\nEastern Manuscript Manager, with the assistance of the Recruiting\nCommittee. Of all papers lately issued in the United, this is without\ndoubt among the most valuable and most significant; since it is the\npioneer of the new regime, whereby the talent of all our membership is\nto be brought out by better publishing facilities. Mrs. Whitehead, with\nnotable generosity, has reserved for herself but one page, on which we\nfind a clever and correct bit of verse, and a number of graceful\nacknowledgments and useful suggestions. The contents in general are well\ncalculated to display the thorough literary excellence and supremacy of\nthe United in its present condition; for in this collection of stories,\npoems, and articles, taken practically at random from the manuscript\nbureaus, there is scarce a line unworthy of commendation.\n\n\"Tatting\", by Julian J. Crump, is a fluent and graceful colloquial\nsketch. \"Mother and Child\", by J. E. Hoag, is a sombre and thoughtful\npoem having a certain atmosphere of mysticism. The metre, which is well\nhandled, consists of regular iambic pentameter quatrains with a couplet\nat the conclusion. An annoying misprint mars the first stanza, where\n\"=sigh=\" is erroneously rendered as \"=sight=\". \"Homesick for the\nSpring\", a poem by Bessie Estelle Harvey, displays real merit in thought\nand construction alike. \"Mother Earth\", by Rev. E. P. Parham, is a well\nadorned little essay in justification of the traditional saying that\n\"the earth is mother of us all\". George M. Whiteside, a new member of\nthe United, makes his first appearance before us as a poet in \"The\nLittle Freckled Face Kid\". Mr. Whiteside's general style is not unlike\nthat of the late James Whitcomb Riley, and its prevailing air of homely\nyet pleasing simplicity is well maintained. \"To Chloris\", by Chester\nPierce Munroe, is a smooth and melodious amatory poem of the Kleiner\nschool. The imagery is refined, and the polish of the whole amply\njustifies the inevitable triteness of the theme. The word \"=adorns=\", in\nnext the last line, should read \"=adorn=\". \"A Dream\", by Helen Harriet\nSalls, is a hauntingly mystical succession of poetic images cast in\nappropriate metre. The natural phenomena of the morning are vividly\ndepicted in a fashion possible only to the true poet. The printer has\ndone injustice to this exquisite phantasy in three places. In the first\nstanza \"=wonderous=\" should read \"=wondrous=\", while in the seventh\nstanza \"=arient=\" should be \"=orient=\". \"=Thou'st=\", in the eleventh\nstanza, should be \"=Thou'rt=\". \"Prayers\", a religious poem by Rev.\nRobert L. Selle, D. D., displays the classic touch of the eighteenth\ncentury in its regular octosyllabic couplets, having some resemblance to\nthe work of the celebrated Dr. Watts. \"Snow of the Northland\", by M.\nEstella Shufelt, is a religious poem of different sort, whose tuneful\ndactylic quatrains contain much noble and appropriate metaphor. In the\nfinal line the word \"=re-cleaned=\" should read \"=re-cleansed=\". \"In\nPassing By\", by Sophie Lea Fox, is a meritorious poem of the thoughtful,\nintrospective type, which has been previously honoured with professional\npublication. \"A Time to Sing\", by M. B. Andrews, introduces to the\nUnited another genuine poet of worth. The lines are happy in inspiration\nand finished in form, having only one possible defect, the use of\n\"=heralding=\" as a dissyllable. \"The Stately Mountains\", by Rev. Eugene\nB. Kuntz, D. D., is a notable contribution to amateur poetic literature.\nDr. Kuntz chooses as his favourite metre the stately Alexandrine; and\nusing it in a far more flexible and ingenious manner than that of\nDrayton, he manages to achieve a dignified and exalted atmosphere\nvirtually impossible in any other measure. The even caesural break so\ncommon to Alexandrines, and so often urged by critics as an objection\nagainst them, is here avoided with great ingenuity and good taste. Dr.\nKuntz's sentiments and phrases are as swelling and sublime as one might\nexpect from his metre. His conception of Nature is a broad and noble\none, and his appreciation of her beauties is that of the innate poet.\n\"An April Memory\" acquaints us with W. Frank Booker, a gifted lyrist\nwhose lines possess all the warmth, witchery and grace of his native\nSouthland. James J. Hennessey, in his essay on \"The Army in Times of\nPeace\", exhibits very forcibly the various indispensable services so\nquietly and efficiently performed by the United States Army in every-day\nlife. Mr. Hennessey makes plain the great value of having among us a\nbody of keen, versatile, and well-trained men ready for duty of any\nsort, and ever alert for their country's welfare in peace or in war. The\nAmerican Soldier well deserves Mr. Hennessey's tribute, and the present\nessay adds one more to the already incontrovertible array of arguments\nin favour of an adequate military system. As printed, the article is\nmarred by a superfluous letter \"=s=\" on the very last word, which should\nread \"=citizen=\". \"Sowing the Good\", a brief bit of moralizing by Horace\nFowler Goodwin, contains a serious misprint, for the final word of line\n1, stanza 2, should be \"=say=\". \"Bobby's Literary Lesson\", by Gladys L.\nBagg, is a delightful specimen of domestic satire in prose. The handling\nof the conversation exhibits Miss Bagg as a writer of considerable skill\nand promise. \"The Leaf\", a clever poem of Nature by Emily Barksdale,\ncontains some gruesome atrocities by the printer. In the second stanza\n\"=it's=\" should be \"=it=\", and \"=wonderous=\" should be \"=wondrous=\". In\nthe third stanza the typographical artist has killed a pretty woodland\n\"=copse=\" with the letter \"=r=\", so that it reads \"=corpse=\"! In the\nfourth stanza \"=head=\" should read \"=heard=\". Perhaps the \"=r=\" which\nmurdered the \"=copse=\" escaped from this sadly mutilated word! In stanza\nfive, \"=Chaots=\" should be \"=chants=\". But why continue the painful\nchronicle? Mr. Kleiner said just what we would like to say about\nmisprints over a year ago, when he wrote \"The Rhyme of the Hapless\nPoet\"! \"Submission\", by Eugene B. Kuntz, is a delightful bit of light\nprose, forming the autobiography of a much-rejected manuscript. This\npiece well exhibits Dr. Kuntz's remarkable versatility. The humour is\nkeen, and nowhere overstrained. \"Number 1287\", a short story by Gracia\nIsola Yarbrough, exhibits many of the flaws of immature work, yet\ncontains graphic touches that promise well for the author. The lack of\nunity in plot and development detracts somewhat from the general effect,\nwhile the unusual lapses of time and artificial working up of the later\nsituations are also antagonistic to technical polish. Triteness is\npresent, but that is to be expected in all amateur fiction. \"A Drama of\nBusiness\", by Edgar Ralph Cheyney, is a terse bit of prose which might\nwell serve as an editorial in a liberal literary magazine. \"The Schools\nof Yesterday and Today\", a sketch by Selma Guilford, presents in\npleasing fashion an interesting and optimistic contrast. In \"Mother\",\nGeorge M. Whiteside treats a noble theme in rather skilful fashion,\nthough the rhyming of \"=breezes=\" and \"=trees is=\" can hardly be deemed\nsuitable in a serious poem. \"When the Sea Calls\", a poem by Winifred\nVirginia Jordan, is possibly the most striking feature of the magazine.\nMrs. Jordan's style in dealing with the wilder aspects of Nature has a\ngrim potency all its own, and we can endorse without qualification the\njudgment of Mr. Moe when he calls this poem \"positively magnificent in\ndynamic effect\". To Mrs. Jordan is granted a natural poetic genius which\nfew other amateurs can hope to parallel. Not many of our literary\nartists can so aptly fit words to weird or unusual passages, or so\nhappily command all the advantages of alliteration and onomatopoeia. We\nbelieve that Mrs. Jordan's amateur eminence will eventually ripen into\nprofessional recognition. \"Preachers in Politics\", by Rev. James Thomas\nSelf, is a long, thoughtful, and extremely well phrased essay against\nthe descent of the ministry to the uncertain affairs of practical\nlegislation. Dr. Self has a just idea of the dignity of the cloth; an\nidea which some clergymen of less conservative habits would do well to\nacquire. Very painful is the sight of the slang-mouthing \"evangelist\"\nwho deserts his pulpit for the stump or the circus-tent. \"Peace,\nGermany!\", a poem by Maude Kingsbury Barton, constitutes an appeal to\nthe present outlaw among nations. We feel, however, that it is only from\nLondon that Germany will eventually be convinced of the futility of her\npseudo-Napoleonic enterprise. And when peace does come to Germany, it\nwill be British-made peace! The structure of Mrs. Barton's poem is\nregular, and many of the images are very well selected. The worst\nmisprints are those in the sixth stanza, where \"=in=\" is omitted before\nthe word \"=pomp=\", and in the seventh stanza where \"=come=\" is printed\nas \"=came=\". In the biographical sketch entitled \"Two Lives\", Helen\nHamilton draws a powerful moral from the contrasting but contemporaneous\ncareers of Florence Nightingale and the ex-Empress Eugenie. \"Class-Room\nSpirits I Have Known\", an essay by Bessie Estelle Harvey, displays a\nsound comprehension of pedagogical principles. Two more poems by Mrs.\nJordan conclude the issue. \"The Time of Peach Tree Bloom\" is the fourth\nof the \"Songs from Walpi\", three of which appeared in THE UNITED\nAMATEUR. \"In a Garden\" is a gem of delightful delicacy and ethereal\nelegance. It is indeed not without just cause that the author has, from\nthe very first, held the distinction of being the most frequent poetical\ncontributor in all amateur journalism.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Cleveland Sun= for June is the first number of an amateur newspaper\nedited by Anthony F. Moitoret, Edwin D. Harkins, and William J. Dowdell;\nand remarkable for an excellent heading, drawn by a staff artist of the\n=Cleveland Leader=. The present issue is printed in close imitation of\nthe modern professional daily, and displays some interesting examples of\n\"newspaper English\". Mr. Moitoret is an old-time United man, now\nreentering the sphere of activity, and he is to be commended warmly both\nfor his generous attitude toward the new members, and for his really\nmagnanimous offer of aid to those desirous of issuing individual papers.\nHis editorial hostility toward the Campbell amendment is, we believe,\nmistaken; yet is none the less founded on a praiseworthy desire to serve\nwhat he deems the best interests of the Association. Were Mr. Moitoret\nmore in touch with the rising ideals of the newer United, he would\nrealize the essential childishness of our \"official business\" as\ncontrasted with the substantial solidity of our developing literature.\nPossibly the plan of Mr. Campbell, as experimentally tried during the\npresent year, will alter Mr. Moitoret's present opinion. Taken\naltogether, we are not sure whether the =Sun= will prove beneficial or\nharmful to the United. We most assuredly need some sort of stimulus to\nactivity, yet the comparatively crude atmosphere of newspaperdom is\nanything but inspiring in a literary society. We cannot descend from the\nideals of Homer to those of Hearst without a distinct loss of quality,\nfor which no possible gain in mere enthusiasm can compensate. Headlines\nsuch as \"Columbus Bunch Boosting Paul\" or \"Hep Still Shows Pep\", are\npositive affronts to the dignity of amateur journalism. There is room\nfor an alert and informing news sheet in the United, yet we feel certain\nthat the =Sun= must become a far more sedate and scholarly publication\nbefore it can adequately supply the need. At present, its garish rays\ndazzle and blind more than they illuminate; in a perusal of its pages we\nexperience more of =sunstroke= than of =sunshine=. Of \"The Best Sport\nPage In Amateurdom\" we find it difficult to speak or write. Not since\nperusing the delectable lines of \"Tom Crib's Memorial to Congress\", by\njovial old \"Anacreon Moore\", have we beheld such an invasion of\nprize-fight philosophy and race-track rhetoric. We learn with interest\nthat a former United member named \"Handsome Harry\" has now graduated\nfrom literature to =left field=, and has, through sheer genius, risen\nfrom the lowly level of the ambitious author, to the exalted eminence of\nthe =classy slugger=. Too proud to =push the pen=, he now =swats the\npill=. Of such doth the dizzy quality of sempiternal Fame consist!\nSpeaking without levity, we cannot but censure Mr. Dowdell's\nintroduction of the ringside or ball-field spirit into an Association\npurporting to promote culture and lettered skill. Our members can\nscarcely be expected to place the Stygian-hued John Arthur Johnson,\nEsq., on a pedestal beside his well-known namesake Samuel; or calmly to\ncompare the stinging wit of a Sidney Smith with the stinging fist-cuffs\nof a \"Gunboat\" Smith. In a word, what is suited to the street-corner is\nnot always suited to the library, and the taste of the United is as yet\nbut imperfectly attuned to the lyrical liltings of the pool-room Muse.\nIt is both hard and unwise to take the \"Best Sport Page\" seriously. As a\ncopy of \"yellow\" models it is a work of artistic verisimilitude; indeed,\nwere Mr. Dowdell a somewhat older man, we might justly suspect a\nsatirical intention on his part.\n\nWe trust that =The Cleveland Sun= may shine on without cloud or setting,\nthough we must needs hope that the United's atmosphere of academic\nrefinement will temper somewhat the scorching glare with which the\nbright orb has risen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Conservative= for April opens with Andrew Francis Lockhart's\nmelodious and attractive poem entitled \"Benediction\". As a whole, this\nis possibly the best piece of verse which Mr. Lockhart has yet written;\nthe sentiment is apt, if not entirely novel, whilst the technical\nconstruction is well-nigh faultless. Such expressions as \"pearl-scarr'd\"\nserve to exhibit the active and original quality of Mr. Lockhart's\ngenius. \"Another Endless Day\", by Rheinhart Kleiner, is a beautiful and\nharmonious poetical protest against monotony. Much to be regretted is\nthe misprint in line 3 of the third stanza, where the text should read:\n\n    \"=A= love to thrill with new delight\".\n\n\"April\", by Winifred Virginia Jordan, is a seasonable and extremely\ntuneful poem whose imagery is of that dainty, sprightly sort which only\nMrs. Jordan can create. \"In Morven's Mead\", also by Mrs. Jordan,\ncontains an elusive and haunting suggestion of the unreal, in the\nauthor's characteristic style. \"The Night Wind Bared My Heart\" completes\na highly meritorious trilogy. In justice to the author, it should be\nstated that the last of these three poems is, as here presented, merely\na rough draft. Through our own reprehensible editorial oversight, the\nprinter received this unpolished copy instead of the finished poem. The\nfollowing emendations should be observed:\n\n    Stanza I, line 4, to read: \"Awak'd my anguish'd sighs\".\n\n    Stanza II, line 3, to read: \"But Oh, from grief =were= prest\".\n\n\"The Best Wine\", by William de Ryee, is an earnestly introspective poem,\nwell cast in iambic pentameter quatrains. \"Ye Ballade of Patrick von\nFlynn\" is a comic delineation of the cheap pseudo-Irish, England-hating\nagitators who have been so offensively noisy on this side of the\nAtlantic ever since the European war began, and particularly since the\nlate riots in Dublin. This class, which so sadly misrepresents the loyal\nIrish people, deserves but little patience from Americans. Its members\nstutter childishly about \"breaches of neutrality\" every time a real\nAmerican dares speak a word in favour of the Mother Country; yet they\nconstantly violate neutrality themselves in their clumsy attempts to use\nthe United States as a catspaw against England. The actual German\npropagandists have the excuse of patriotism for their race and\nVaterland, but these Hibernian hybrids, neither good Irishmen nor good\nAmericans, have no excuse whatever when they try to subvert the\nfunctions of the country which is giving them protection and livelihood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Conservative= for July pays a deserved tribute to one of the most\nlucid and acute of our amateur essayists, by devoting the entire issue\nto his work. Henry Clapham McGavack, in \"The American Proletariat versus\nEngland\", exposes with admirable fearlessness the silly Anglophobic\nnotions which a mistaken conception of the Revolution, and an ignorant\nIrish population, have diffused among our lower classes. It is seldom\nthat an author ventures to speak so frankly on this subject, for the\nservile tendency of the times impels most writers and publishers to play\nthe demagogue by essaying to feed the Irish masses with the anti-English\nswill they desire; but Mr. McGavack wields an independent pen, and\nrecords the truth without fear of the =mobile vulgus= and its shallow\nviews. In power, directness, urbanity, and impartiality, Mr. McGavack\ncannot be excelled. He marshals his arguments without passion, bias, or\ncircumlocution; piling proof upon proof until none but the most stubborn\nEngland-hater can fail to blush at the equal injustice and stupidity of\nthose who malign that mighty empire to whose earth-wide circle of\ncivilisation we all belong.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Coyote= for April is a Special English Number, dedicated to our\nsoldier-member, George William Stokes of Newcastle-on-Tyne. The opening\npoem \"To England\", well exhibits the versatility of Mrs. Winifred V.\nJordan, who here appears as a national panegyrist of commendable dignity\nand unexceptionable taste. The word at the beginning of the fourth line\nshould read \"=Is=\" instead of \"=To=\". The short yet stirring metre is\nparticularly well selected. \"Active English Amateurs I Have Met\", by\nErnest A. Dench, is a rather good prose piece, though not without marks\nof careless composition. \"The Vultur\", by Henry J. Winterbone of the\nB. A. P. A., is a remarkably good story whose development and conclusion\nwould do credit to a professional pen. We hope Mr. Winterbone may join\nthe United, thereby giving American readers a more ample opportunity to\nenjoy his work. Editor William T. Harrington, whose prose is so rapidly\nacquiring polish and fluency, contributes two brief but able essays:\n\"History Repeats\" and \"How Great Britain Keeps Her Empire\". In \"History\nRepeats\", certain parts of the second sentence might well be amended a\ntrifle in structure, to read thus: \"it must be remembered =that= the\nfirst half was a series of victories for the South, and =that= only\nafter the Battle of Gettysburg did the strength of the North begin to\nassert itself\". This number of =The Coyote= is an exceedingly timely and\ntasteful tribute to our Mother Country, appearing at an hour when the\nair of America reeks with the illiterate anti-British trash of the \"Sinn\nFein\" simpletons and Prussian propagandists.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Invictus= for July is the second number of Mr. Paul J. Campbell's\npersonal organ, and represents the strictly individual magazine in its\nmost tasteful and elaborate form. Unimpeachably artistic in appearance,\nits contents justify the exterior; the whole constituting a publication\nof the first rank, wherein are joined the virtues both of the old and of\nthe new schools of amateur journalism. Since Mr. Campbell is\npreeminently an essayist, it is to his dissertations on \"The Pursuit of\nHappiness\" and \"The Age of Accuracy\" which we turn most eagerly; and\nwhich in no way disappoint our high expectations. The first of these\nessays is a dispassionate survey of mankind in its futile but frantic\nscramble after that elusive but unreal sunbeam called \"happiness\". The\nauthor views the grimly amusing procession of human life with the\ngenuine objective of an impartial spectator, and with commendable\nfreedom from the hypocritical colouring of those who permit commonplace\nemotions and tenuous idealizings to obscure the less roseate but more\nsubstantial vision of their intellects. \"The Age of Accuracy\" presents\nan inspiring panorama of the evolution of Intellect, and of its\nincreasing domination over the more elemental faculties of instinct and\nemotion. At the same time, much material for reflection is furnished,\nsince it is obvious that the advance is necessarily confined to a\ncomparatively small and select part of humanity. Instinct and emotion\nare still forces of tremendous magnitude, against which Reason wages an\nupward struggle of incredible bravery. Only the strong can escape the\nclutch of the primitive, wherefore there can be no successful social\norder which does not conform in its essentials to the blind impulses of\nthe natural man or man-ape. We are in danger of overestimating the\nascendancy and stability of Reason, for it is in reality the most\nfragile and rudimentary element in our mortal fabric. A heavy blow on\ncertain parts of the skull, or a bullet in certain parts of the brain,\ncan destroy in an instant all the accumulated intellect which aeons of\nheredity have bestowed, depressing the victim from the zenith of culture\nand refinement to a condition separated only by colour and contour from\nthat of the negro or the gorilla; yet not all the edicts of the\nlawgiver, devices of the educator, measures of the reformer, or skill of\nthe surgeon, can extirpate the ingrained instincts and seated\nsuperstitions of the average human animal.\n\nThe poetry of Mr. Campbell is represented in =Invictus= by three\nspecimens, whose merit speaks well for the author's progress in the art.\n\"The Sunshine Girl\" is an amatory panegyric of no small skill and\npolish, though not strikingly novel in sentiment or expression. \"German\nKultur\" is a scathing and virile indictment of the present enemies of\nhumanity. The versification is bold, and in places rugged, whilst the\nimagery is appropriately grim and sardonic. Points which we might\ncriticise are the repeated use of \"=civilization=\" as a word of only\nfour syllables, and the archaic pronunciation of \"=drown-ed=\" as a\ndissyllable. This latter usage would be objectionable in verse of\nstately or conservative cast, but here grates upon the ear as an\nanachronism. The trenchant wit of the piece is well sustained, and\nbrought out with particular force in the second and fourth stanzas. \"The\nMajor Strain\" is without doubt the foremost verse of the issue. This is\nreal poetry. The sustained rhyming, whereby each stanza contains only\none rhyming sound, is pleasing and unusual. Mr. Campbell's comment on\n\"Amateur Affairs\" really deserves to be classed as an essay, for its\nthoughtful conclusions and intelligent analyses of human nature\ncertainly draw it within the pale of true literature. The broad\ncomprehension and continued love of amateur journalism here exhibited,\nare potent justifications of the author's practically unanimous election\nto the Presidency of the United. =Invictus= is one of the very foremost\njournals of the amateur world, and the only possible objection which can\nbe raised against it, is its infrequency of appearance. It is the voice\nof a virile and vibrant personality who unites vigour of thought with\nurbanity of expression.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Scot= for May marks the advent of this highly entertaining and well\nconducted magazine to the United, and extends the northern frontier of\namateur journalism to Bonnie Dundee, in Auld Scotland, the Land of\nMountain and Flood. \"Hidden Beauty\", a poem in blank verse by R. M.\nIngersley, opens the issue with a combination of lofty conceptions,\nvivid imagery, and regular structure. \"England's Glory\", by Clyde Dane,\nis a stirring tale of that fearless and self-sacrificing honour which\nhas given to the Anglo-Saxon the supremacy of the world. It would be in\nbad taste to cavil at slight technical imperfections or instances of\ntriteness when considering so earnest and glowing a delineation of the\nBritish character; the noblest human type ever moulded by the Creator.\n\"Oh Rose, Red Rose!\" is a tuneful little lyric by Winifred V. Jordan,\nwhose work is never too brief to be pleasing, or too long to be\nabsorbing. \"Clemency versus Frightfulness\", by William T. Harrington, is\na thoughtful and lucid exposition of the British governmental ideal of\nlenient justice; an ideal whose practical success has vividly\ndemonstrated its thorough soundness. \"At Last\", by Muriel Wilson, is a\nblank verse poem of much merit. \"Do You Remember?\", by the late Lieut.\nRoy Arthur Thackara, R. N., is a delicate sketch possessing the\nadditional interest of coming from the pen of one who has now given his\nlife for King and Country; the author having gone down with H. M. S.\n=India=. \"A Battle with the Sea\", a sketch by Midshipman Ernest L.\nMcKeag, exhibits descriptive power of no common order, yet might well\nhave a less abrupt conclusion. \"To Some One\", by Margaret Trafford, is a\npoem in dactylic measure, dedicated to the women of Britain. The\nsentiment is noble, and the encomium well bestowed, though the metre\ncould be improved in polish. \"Gum\", by Henry J. Winterbone, is a\ndelightfully humorous sketch. It is evident that those who depreciate\nBritish humour must have taken pains to avoid its perusal, since it has\na quietly pungent quality seldom found save among Anglo-Saxons.\nPersonally, we believe that the summit of clumsy pseudo-jocoseness is\nattained by the average \"comic\" supplement of the Hearst Sunday papers.\nThese, and not the British press, present the pathetic spectacle of\nutter inanity and repulsive grotesqueness without the faintest redeeming\ntouch of genuine comedy, legitimate satire, or refined humour. \"Life's\nVoyage\", by Matthew Hilson, is a poem of great attractiveness, though of\nscarcely impeccable construction. Concerning the expression \"tempests\nwild do roar\", we must reiterate the advice of Mr. Pope, who condemned\nthe expletive \"do\", \"doth\", or \"did\" as a \"feeble aid\". Such usage has,\nin fact, been in bad taste ever since the reign of Queen Anne; Dryden\nbeing the last bard in whom we need not censure the practice. Mr.\nMcColl's editorials are brief but informing. He may well be\ncongratulated on his work as a publisher, and he certainly deserves as\nhearty a welcome as the United can give.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Scot= for June is a \"British Old-Timers' Number\", confined wholly\nto the work of the senior amateur journalists of the Mother Country.\nEdward F. Herdman, to whom this number is dedicated, opens the issue\nwith a religious poem entitled \"Life\", which compares well with the bulk\nof current religious verse. Mr. Herdman also contributes one of several\nprose essays on amateur journalism, in which the various authors view\nour field of endeavor from similar angles. \"A Song of a Sailor\", by\nR. D. Roosemale-Cocq, exhibits buoyant animation, and considerable ease\nin the handling of a rollicking measure. The internal rhymes are for the\nmost part well introduced, though greater uniformity might have been\nused in their distribution. The first two lines have none. In the last\nstanza there are two lines whose metre seems deficient, but being\nconscious of the uncertainties of the secretarial and typographical\narts, we suspend judgment on the author. \"A Song of Cheer\", by Alfred H.\nPearce, is an optimistic ode of real merit. The last line furnishes a\nparticularly pleasing example of sprightly wit. Mr. Gavin T. McColl is\nsensible and perspicuous in all his editorial utterances. His work in\nissuing one of the only two regular monthly magazines in amateurdom has\nalready brought him to prominence, though his connexion with the press\nassociations is still new.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for June is given over largely to critical and\nofficial matter, though two pieces of verse serve to vary the monotony.\n\"Content\", from our own pen, is an answer to Mr. Rheinhart Kleiner's\ndelightful poem in the April =Conservative=, entitled \"Another Endless\nDay\". The lines are notable chiefly on account of some fearful and\nwonderful typographical errors. In the fourth line \"=sublime=\" should\nread \"=sublimer=\". In the eighth line there should be no apostrophe in\nthe word \"=stars=\". In the second column, eleventh line from the end,\nthere should be no apostrophe in the word \"=fathers=\", and finally, in\nthe ninth line from the end, \"=hollow'd=\" should read \"=hallow'd=\". \"The\nSwing in the Great Oak Tree\", by Mrs. Agnes Richmond Arnold, is a\nreminiscent poem whose measure is as swinging as its subject, and whose\natmosphere is pleasantly rural. There are flaws in the metre, and\nirregularities in the rhyming arrangement, but the spirit of the whole\nrises blithesomely above such slight technical matters. Editor\nSchilling's column is to be praised for its dignified style, and\nendorsed for its sound opinions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for July is an attractive and important contribution to\nthe history of amateur journalism; since it is entirely devoted to the\nbiographies of the gifted Columbus amateurs, and to the annals of their\nbrilliant local organization. The Woodbees undoubtedly form the most\nactive and representative adult club in the United; to which only the\nAppleton Club, representing the juvenile Muse, may justly be compared.\nThe Woodbees are typical, in a sense, of all that is best in the entire\nassociation. They are pursuing courses of serious literary study,\nproducing a regularly issued magazine of unfailing merit and good taste,\nworking enthusiastically for the welfare and expansion of the United,\nand leading or following every worthy or progressive movement in amateur\npolitics. They reflect credit upon themselves, their society, the\nAssociation, and amateur journalism as a whole. The delightful\nbiographical article which occupies the major portion of the current\n=Woodbee= is unsigned; but deserves particular praise, whoever the\nauthor may be. The various characters are well displayed, and their\npleasing qualities and manifold activities well exhibited.\n\nMr. Fritter's editorials are as usual timely, lucid, and sensible. His\nadvocacy of the Campbell Amendment is to be applauded; and will, we\ntrust, be justified by the year's trial which that measure is now\nundergoing. The present issue marks the conclusion of Mr. Fritter's term\nas editor. He has given the amateur public a creditable volume, and is\nentitled to the gratitude of every member of our Association. A final\nword of praise is due the excellent group photograph of the Woodbees\nwhich forms the frontispiece of the magazine. Added to the biographical\nmatter, it completes a thoroughly commendable introduction to a\nthoroughly commendable body of literary workers.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n                     THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n   OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n VOLUME XVI    GEORGETOWN, ILL., NOVEMBER, 1916    NUMBER 4\n\n\nTHE ALCHEMIST\n\nHigh up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are\nwooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest,\nstands the old chateau of my ancestors. For centuries its lofty\nbattlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside\nabout, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose\nhonoured line is older even than the moss-grown castle walls. These\nancient turrets, stained by the storms of generations and crumbling\nunder the slow yet mighty pressure of time, formed in the ages of\nfeudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all\nFrance. From its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons,\nCounts, and even Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls\nresounded to the footstep of the invader.\n\nBut since those glorious years all is changed. A poverty but little\nabove the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids\nits alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the\nscions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour;\nand the falling stones of the walls, the overgrown vegetation in the\nparks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill-paved courtyards, and toppling\ntowers without, as well as the sagging floors, the worm-eaten wainscots,\nand the faded tapestries within, all tell a gloomy tale of fallen\ngrandeur. As the ages passed, first one, then another of the four great\nturrets were left to ruin, until at last but a single tower housed the\nsadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate.\n\nIt was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower\nthat I, Antoine, last of the unhappy and accursed Comtes de C----, first\nsaw the light of day, ninety long years ago. Within these walls, and\namongst the dark and shadowy forests, the wild ravines and grottoes of\nthe hillside below, were spent the first years of my troubled life. My\nparents I never knew. My father had been killed at the age of\nthirty-two, a month before I was born, by the fall of a stone somehow\ndislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle, and my mother\nhaving died at my birth, my care and education devolved solely upon one\nremaining servitor, an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence,\nwhose name I remember as Pierre. I was an only child, and the lack of\ncompanionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the\nstrange care exercised by my aged guardian in excluding me from the\nsociety of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and\nthere upon the plains that surround the base of the hill. At the time,\nPierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble\nbirth placed me above association with such plebeian company. Now I know\nthat its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the\ndread curse upon our line, that were nightly told and magnified by the\nsimple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their\ncottage hearths.\n\nThus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my\nchildhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the\nshadow-haunted library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or\npurpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the\nsides of the hill near its foot. It was perhaps an effect of such\nsurroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy. Those\nstudies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most\nstrongly claimed my attention.\n\nOf my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what\nsmall knowledge of it I was able to gain, seemed to depress me much.\nPerhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor\nto discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror\nwhich I ever felt at the mention of my great house, yet as I grew out of\nchildhood, I was able to piece together disconnected fragments of\ndiscourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter\nin approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to a certain\ncircumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now became\ndimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at\nwhich all the Comtes of my line had met their end. Whilst I had hitherto\nconsidered this but a natural attribute of a family of short-lived men,\nI afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths, and began to\nconnect them with the wanderings of the old man, who often spoke of a\ncurse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my\ntitle from much exceeding the span of thirty-two years. Upon my\ntwenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document\nwhich he said had for many generations been handed down from father to\nson, and continued by each possessor. Its contents were of the most\nstartling nature, and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my\napprehensions. At this time, my belief in the supernatural was firm and\ndeep-seated, else I should have dismissed with scorn the incredible\nnarrative unfolded before my eyes.\n\nThe paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when\nthe old castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable\nfortress. It told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelt on our\nestates, a person of no small accomplishments, though little above the\nrank of peasant; by name, Michel, usually designated by the surname of\nMauvais, the Evil, on account of his sinister reputation. He had studied\nbeyond the custom of his kind, seeking such things as the Philosopher's\nStone, or the Elixir of Eternal Life, and was reputed wise in the\nterrible secrets of Black Magic and Alchemy. Michel Mauvais had one son,\nnamed Charles, a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts, and\nwho had therefore been called Le Sorcier, or the Wizard. This pair,\nshunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous\npractices. Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a\nsacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable disappearances of many\nsmall peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two. Yet\nthrough the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray\nof humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity,\nwhilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection.\n\nOne night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion\nby the vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri, the Comte. A searching\nparty, headed by the frantic father, invaded the cottage of the\nsorcerers and there came upon old Michel Mauvais, busy over a huge and\nviolently boiling cauldron. Without certain cause, in the ungoverned\nmadness of fury and despair, the Comte laid hands on the aged wizard,\nand ere he released his murderous hold his victim was no more. Meanwhile\njoyful servants were proclaiming aloud the finding of young Godfrey in a\ndistant and unused chamber of the great edifice, telling too late that\npoor Michel had been killed in vain. As the Comte and his associates\nturned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists, the form of Charles\nLe Sorcier appeared through the trees. The excited chatter of the\nmenials standing about told him what had occurred, yet he seemed at\nfirst unmoved at his father's fate. Then, slowly advancing to meet the\nComte, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever\nafterward haunted the house of C----.\n\n    \"May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line\n    Survive to reach a greater age than thine!\"\n\nspake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood, he drew\nfrom his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw in the face\nof his father's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the\nnight. The Comte died without utterance, and was buried the next day,\nbut little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth. No\ntrace of the assassin could be found, though relentless bands of\npeasants scoured the neighboring woods and the meadow-land around the\nhill.\n\nThus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in\nthe minds of the late Comte's family, so that when Godfrey, innocent\ncause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title, was killed by an\narrow whilst hunting, at the age of thirty-two, there were no thoughts\nsave those of grief at his demise. But when, years afterward, the next\nyoung Comte, Robert by name, was found dead in a nearby field from no\napparent cause, the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had\nbut lately passed his thirty-second birthday when surprised by early\ndeath. Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same\nfateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous\nchronicle; Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy\nand virtuous lives when a little below the age of their unfortunate\nancestor at his murder.\n\nThat I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made\ncertain to me by the words which I read. My life, previously held at\nsmall value, now became dearer to me each day, as I delved deeper and\ndeeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic. Isolated\nas I was, modern science had produced no impression upon me, and I\nlaboured as in the Middle Ages, as wrapt as had been old Michel and\nyoung Charles themselves in the acquisition of demonological and\nalchemical learning. Yet read as I might, in no manner could I account\nfor the strange curse upon my line. In unusually rational moments, I\nwould even go so far as to seek a natural explanation, attributing the\nearly deaths of my ancestors to the sinister Charles Le Sorcier and his\nheirs; yet having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known\ndescendants of the alchemist, I would fall back to my occult studies,\nand once more endeavour to find a spell that would release my house from\nits terrible burden. Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved. I should\nnever wed, for since no other branches of my family were in existence, I\nmight thus end the curse with myself.\n\nAs I drew near the age of thirty, old Pierre was called to the land\nbeyond. Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about\nwhich he had loved to wander in life. Thus was I left to ponder on\nmyself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my\nutter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the\nimpending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of\nmy ancestors had met. Much of my time was now occupied in the\nexploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old\nchateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which\nold Pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over\nfour centuries. Strange and awsome were many of the objects I\nencountered. Furniture, covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with\nthe rot of long dampness met my eyes. Cobwebs in a profusion never\nbefore seen by me were spun everywhere, and huge bats flapped their bony\nand uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom.\n\nOf my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful\nrecord, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the\nlibrary tolled off so much more of my doomed existence. At length I\napproached that time which I had so long viewed with apprehension. Since\nmost of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they\nreached the exact age of the Comte Henri at his end, I was every moment\non the watch for the coming of the unknown death. In what strange form\nthe curse should overtake me, I knew not; but I was resolved at least\nthat it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim. With new\nvigour I applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its\ncontents.\n\nIt was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the\ndeserted portion of the castle, less than a week before that fatal hour\nwhich I felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth, beyond\nwhich I could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw\nbreath, that I came upon the culminating event of my whole life. I had\nspent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half ruined\nstaircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets. As the\nafternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels, descending into what\nappeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, or a more\nrecently excavated storehouse for gunpowder. As I slowly traversed the\nnitre-encrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase, the paving\nbecame very damp, and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch\nthat a blank, water-stained wall impeded my journey. Turning to retrace\nmy steps, my eye fell upon a small trap-door with a ring, which lay\ndirectly beneath my feet. Pausing, I succeeded with difficulty in\nraising it, whereupon there was revealed a black aperture, exhaling\nnoxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter, and disclosing in the\nunsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps. As soon as the torch,\nwhich I lowered into the repellent depths, burned freely and steadily, I\ncommenced my descent. The steps were many, and led to a narrow\nstone-flagged passage which I knew must be far underground. This passage\nproved of great length, and terminated in a massive oaken door,\ndripping with the moisture of the place, and stoutly resisting all my\nattempts to open it. Ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction,\nI had proceeded back some distance toward the steps, when there suddenly\nfell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks\ncapable of reception by the human mind. Without warning, =I heard the\nheavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hinges=. My\nimmediate sensations are incapable of analysis. To be confronted in a\nplace as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with\nevidence of the presence of man or spirit, produced in my brain a horror\nof the most acute description. When at last I turned and faced the seat\nof the sound, my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight\nthat they beheld. There in the ancient Gothic doorway stood a human\nfigure. It was that of a man clad in a skull-cap and long mediaeval\ntunic of dark colour. His long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible\nand intense black hue, and of incredible profusion. His forehead, high\nbeyond the usual dimensions; his cheeks, deep sunken and heavily lined\nwith wrinkles; and his hands, long, claw-like and gnarled, were of such\na deathly, marble-like whiteness as I have never elsewhere seen in man.\nHis figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent\nand almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment. But\nstrangest of all were his eyes; twin caves of abysmal blackness;\nprofound in expression of understanding, yet inhuman in degree of\nwickedness. These were now fixed upon me, piercing my soul with their\nhatred, and rooting me to the spot whereon I stood. At last the figure\nspoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull\nhollowness and latent malevolence. The language in which the discourse\nwas clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more\nlearned men of the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged\nresearches into the works of the old alchemists and demonologists. The\napparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house, told me\nof my coming end, dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against\nold Michel Mauvais, and gloated over the revenge of Charles Le Sorcier.\nHe told me how the young Charles had escaped into the night, returning\nin after years to kill Godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he\napproached the age which had been his father's at his assassination; how\nhe had secretly returned to the estate and established himself, unknown,\nin the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed\nthe hideous narrator; how he had seized Robert, son of Godfrey, in a\nfield, forced poison down his throat and left him to die at the age of\nthirty-two, thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse.\nAt this point I was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery\nof all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when Charles Le\nSorcier must in the course of nature have died, for the man digressed\ninto an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards,\nfather and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles\nLe Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook\nof it eternal life and youth.\n\nHis enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible\neyes the hatred that had at first so haunted them, but suddenly the\nfiendish glare returned, and with a shocking sound like the hissing of a\nserpent, the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of\nending my life as had Charles Le Sorcier, six hundred years before,\nended that of my ancestor. Prompted by some preserving instinct of\nself-defense, I broke through the spell that had hitherto held me\nimmovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my\nexistence. I heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the\npassage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid\nscene with a ghastly radiance. The shriek of fright and impotent malice\nemitted by the would-be assassin proved too much for my already shaken\nnerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint.\n\nWhen at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind\nremembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more;\nyet curiosity overmastered all. Who, I asked myself, was this man of\nevil, and how came he within the castle walls? Why should he seek to\navenge the death of poor Michel Mauvais, and how had the curse been\ncarried on through all the long centuries since the time of Charles Le\nSorcier? The dread of years was lifted off my shoulders, for I knew that\nhe whom I had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse; and\nnow that I was free, I burned with the desire to learn more of the\nsinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries, and made of my\nown youth one long-continued nightmare. Determined upon further\nexploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the\nunused torch which I had with me. First of all, the new light revealed\nthe distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger. The hideous\neyes were now closed. Disliking the sight, I turned away and entered the\nchamber beyond the Gothic door. Here I found what seemed much like an\nalchemist's laboratory. In one corner was an immense pile of a shining\nyellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch. It may\nhave been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I was strangely\naffected by that which I had undergone. At the farther end of the\napartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines\nof the dark hillside forest. Filled with wonder, yet now realizing how\nthe man had obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded to return. I had\nintended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face, but\nas I approached the body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint\nsound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct. Aghast, I turned to\nexamine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor.\n\nThen all at once the horrible eyes, blacker even than the seared face in\nwhich they were set, opened wide with an expression which I was unable\nto interpret. The cracked lips tried to frame words which I could not\nwell understand. Once I caught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again\nI fancied that the words \"years\" and \"curse\" issued from the twisted\nmouth. Still I was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected\nspeech. At my evident ignorance of his meaning, the pitchy eyes once\nmore flashed malevolently at me, until, helpless as I saw my opponent to\nbe, I trembled as I watched him.\n\nSuddenly the wretch, animated with his last burst of strength, raised\nhis hideous head from the damp and sunken pavement. Then, as I remained,\nparalyzed with fear, he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed\nforth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and my\nnights. \"Fool,\" he shrieked, \"can you not guess my secret? Have you no\nbrain whereby you may recognize the will which has through six long\ncenturies fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house? Have I not told\nyou of the great elixir of eternal life? Know you not how the secret of\nAlchemy was solved? I tell you, it is I! I! =I! that have lived for six\nhundred years to maintain my revenge=, FOR I AM CHARLES LE SORCIER!\"\n\n                                                      H. P. LOVECRAFT.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MARCH 1917\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Conservative= for October opens with Miss Olive G. Owen's tuneful\nlines on \"The Mocking Bird.\" Of the quality of Miss Owen's poetry it is\nscarce necessary to speak; be it sufficient to say that the present\npiece ranks among her best. In the intense fervour of the sentiment, and\nthe felicitous choice of the imagery, the touch of the born poet is\nalike shown. Through an almost inexcusable editorial mistake of our own,\nthe first word of this poem is erroneously rendered. Line 1 should read:\n\n    \"=Where= Southern moonlight softly falls.\"\n\n\"Old England and the Hyphen\" is an attempt of the present critic to\ndemonstrate why relations between the United States and Mother England\nmust necessarily be closer than those between the States and any of the\nreally foreign powers. So patent and so inevitable is the essential\nunity of the Anglo-Saxon world that such an essay as this ought really\nto be superfluous; but its practical justification is found in the silly\nclamour of those Anglophobes who are unfortunately permitted to reside\nwithin our borders. \"Insomnia,\" by Winifred Virginia Jordan, is a\nremarkable piece of verse whose dark turns of fancy are almost worthy of\na Poe. The grotesque tropes, the cleverly distorted images, the bizarre\natmosphere, and ingeniously sinister repetitions all unite to produce\none of the season's most notable poems. Each of the stanzas is vibrant\nwith the hideous, racking turmoil of the insomnious mind. \"Prussianism,\"\nby William Thomas Harrington, is a concise and lucid essay on a timely\nsubject, reviewing ably the cause and responsibility of the present war.\nIt is especially valuable at this season of incoherent peace\ndiscussion, for it explodes very effectively that vague, brainless\n\"neutrality\" which prompts certain pro-German pacifists to cry for peace\nbefore the normal and final settlement of Europe's troubles shall have\nbeen attained by the permanent annihilation of the Prussian military\nmachine. \"Twilight,\" by Chester Pierce Munroe, is a beautiful bit of\npoetic fancy and stately phraseology. Mr. Munroe, a Rhode Islander\ntransplanted to the mountains of North Carolina, is acquiring all the\ngrace and delicacy of the native Southern bard, while retaining that\nhappy conservatism of expression which distinguishes his work from that\nof most contemporary poets. Callously modern indeed must be he who would\nwish Mr. Munroe's quaintly euphonious lines transmuted into the\nirritatingly abrupt and barren phraseology of the day. \"The Bond\nInvincible,\" by David H. Whittier, is a short story of great power and\nskilful construction, suggesting Poe's \"Ligeia\" in its central theme.\nThe plot is developed with much dexterity, and the climax comes so\nforcibly and unexpectedly upon the reader, that one cannot but admire\nMr. Whittier's mastery of technique. Certain overnice critics may\npossibly object to the tale, as containing incidents which no one\nsurvives to relate; but when we reflect that Poe has similarly written a\nstory without survivors, (\"The Masque of the Red Death\") we can afford\nto applaud without reservation. The complete absence of slang and of\ndoubtful grammar recommends this tale as a model to other amateur\nfiction-writers. \"Respite\" is a lachrymose lament in five stanzas by the\npresent critic. The metre is regular, which is perhaps some excuse for\nits creation and publication. \"By the Waters of the Brook,\" by Rev.\nEugene B. Kuntz, D. D., is one of the noblest amateur poems of the year.\nWhile the casual reader may find in the long heptameter lines a want of\nsing-song facility; the true lover of the Nine pauses in admiration at\nthe deep flowing nobility of the rhyme. The quick rippling of the brook\nis duplicated within each line, rather than from line to line. The\nimagery and phraseology are of the sort which only Dr. Kuntz can\nfashion, and are rich in that exalted pantheism of fancy which comes to\nhim who knows Nature in her wilder and more rugged moods and aspects.\n\"The Pool,\" by Winifred Virginia Jordan, contains an elusive hint of the\nterrible and the supernatural which gives it high rank as poetry. Mrs.\nJordan has two distinct, yet related, styles in verse. One of these\nmirrors all the joy and buoyant happiness of life, whilst the other\nreflects that undertone of grimness which is sometimes felt through the\nexterior of things. The kinship betwixt these styles lies in their\nessentially fanciful character, as distinguished from the tiresomely\ncommonplace realism of the average modern rhymester. Another bit of\nsinister psychology in verse is \"The Unknown,\" by Elizabeth Berkeley.\nMrs. Berkeley's style is less restrained than that of Mrs. Jordan, and\npresents a picture of stark, meaningless horror, the like of which is\nnot often seen in the amateur press. It is difficult to pass upon the\nactual merit of so peculiar a production, but we will venture the\nopinion that the use of italics, or heavy-faced type, is not desirable.\nThe author should be able to bring out all needed emphasis by words, not\nprinter's devices. The issue concludes with \"Inspiration,\" a poem by\nLewis Theobald, Jun. The form and rhythm of this piece are quite\nsatisfactory, but the insipidity of the sentiment leaves much to be\ndesired. The whole poem savours too much of the current magazine style.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Coyote= for October is made notable by Editor Harrington's\nthoughtful and well compiled article on \"Worldwide Prohibition,\" wherein\nan extremely important step in the world's progress is truthfully\nchronicled. That legislation against alcohol is spreading rapidly\nthroughout civilization, is something which not even the densest\nchampions of \"personal liberty\" can deny. The utter emptiness of all\narguments in behalf of strong drink is made doubly apparent by the swift\nprohibitory enactments of the European nations when confronted by the\nemergencies of war, and by the abolition of liquor in a large number of\nAmerican states for purely practical reasons. All these things point to\na general recognition of liquor as a foe to governmental and industrial\nwelfare. Mr. Harrington's style in this essay is clear and in most\nrespects commendable; though certain passages might gain force and\ndignity through a less colloquial manner. In particular, we must protest\nagainst the repeated use of the vulgarism =booze=, a word probably\nbrought into public favour by the new school of gutter evangelism,\nwhose chief exponent is the Reverend William Sunday. The verb =to\nbooze=, =boose=, or =bouse=, meaning \"to drink immoderately,\" and the\nadjective =boozy=, =boosy=, or =bousy=, meaning \"drunken,\" are by no\nmeans new to our language, Dryden having written the form =bousy= in\nsome of his verses; but =booze= as a noun signifying \"liquor\" is\ncertainly too vulgar a word for constant employment in any formal\nliterary composition. Another essay of Mr. Harrington's is \"The Divine\nBook,\" a plea for the restoration of the Bible as a source of popular\nreading and arbiter of moral conduct. Whatever may be the opinion of the\nsearching critic regarding the place of the Scriptures in the world of\nfact, it is undeniably true that a closer study of the revered volume,\nand a stricter adherence to its best precepts, would do much toward\nmending the faults of a loose age. We have yet to find a more\nefficacious means of imparting virtue and contentment of heart to the\nmasses of mankind. \"Pioneers of New England,\" an article by Alice M.\nHamlet, gives much interesting information concerning the sturdy\nsettlers of New Hampshire and Vermont. In the unyielding struggles of\nthese unsung heroes against the sting of hardship and the asperity of\nprimeval Nature, we may discern more than a trace of that divine fire of\nconquest which has made the Anglo-Saxon the empire builder of all the\nages. In Mr. Harrington's editorial column there is much discussion of a\nproposed \"International Amateur Press Association,\" but we fail to\nperceive why such an innovation is needed, now that the United has\nopened itself unreservedly to residents of all the countries of the\nglobe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Merry Minutes= for November is a clever publication of\nsemi-professional character, edited by Miss Margaret Trafford of London,\nand containing a pleasant variety of prose, verses, and puzzles. \"King\nof the Nursery Realm,\" by Margaret Mahon, is a smooth and musical piece\nof juvenile verse which excels in correctness of form rather than in\nnovelty of thought.\n\n\"Bards and Minstrels, and The Augustan Age,\" by Beryl Mappin, is the\nsecond of a series of articles on English literature and its classical\nfoundations. The erudition and enthusiasm displayed in this essay speak\nwell for the future of the authoress, though certain faults of style and\nconstruction demand correction. Careful grammatical study would\neliminate from Miss Mappin's style such solecisms as the use of =like=\nfor =as=, whilst greater attention to the precepts of rhetoric would\nprevent the construction of such awkward sentences as the following:\n\"The same if one is reading an interesting book, can one not see all\nthat is happening there as clearly with one's inner eyes as if it was\nall taking place before one, and viewed with one's outer ones?\" This\npassage is not only wanting in coherence and correctness of syntax, but\nis exceedingly clumsy through redundancy of statement, and repetition of\nthe word =one=. This word, though essential to colloquial diction,\nbecomes very tiresome when used to excess; and should be avoided in many\ncases through judicious transpositions of the text. The following is a\nrevised version of the sentence quoted above: \"Thus, in reading an\ninteresting book, can one not see with the inner eyes all that is\nhappening there, as clearly as if it were taking place in reality before\nthe outer eyes?\" Other parts of the essay require similar revision.\nConcerning the development of the whole, we must needs question the\nunity of the topics. Whilst the connecting thread is rather evident\nafter a second or third perusal, the cursory reader is apt to become\npuzzled over the skips from the Graeco-Roman world to the early Saxon\nkingdoms, and thence to the dawn of our language amongst the\nAnglo-Normans. What Miss Mappin evidently wishes to bring out, is that\nthe sources of English literature are twofold; being on the one hand the\npolished classics of antiquity, inspired by Greece, amplified and\ndiffused by Rome, preserved by France, and brought to England by the\nNormans; and on the other hand the crude but virile products of our\nSaxon ancestors, brought from the uncivilized forests of the continent\nor written after the settlement in Britain. From this union of\nGraeco-Roman classicism with native Anglo-Saxon vitality springs the\nunquestioned supremacy of English literature. Assiduous devotion to the\nmastery of rhetoric, and the habit of constructing logical synopses\nbefore writing the text of articles would enable Miss Mappin to utilise\nher knowledge of literary history in a manner truly worthy of its depth.\n\"Trinidad and its People,\" by \"F. E. M. Hercules,\" exhibits a somewhat\nmaturer style, and forms a very interesting piece of geographical\ndescription. \"The Pursuit of the Innocent,\" is a serial story by Miss\nTrafford, and though only a small part of it is printed in the current\nissue, we judge that it derives its general atmosphere from the popular\n\"thrillers\" of the day. The dialogue is not wholly awkward, but there is\na noticeable want of proportion in the development of the narrative.\nMiss Trafford would probably profit by a more faithful study of the\nstandard novelists, and a more complete avoidance of the type of fiction\nfound in modern weekly periodicals such as =Answers= or =Tit-Bits=.\nThose who feel impelled to introduce stirring adventure into their\ntales, can do so without sacrifice of excitement and interest by\nfollowing really classic writers like Poe and Stevenson; or\nsemi-standard authors like Sir A. Conan Doyle. The puzzles propounded by\nMiss Hillman are quite interesting, though matter of this sort is\nscarcely to be included within the domain of pure literature. We guess\n=airship= as the answer to the first one, but have not space to record\nour speculations concerning the second. =Merry Minutes= closes with the\nfollowing poem by Master Randolph Trafford, a very young author:\n\n    \"Once upon a time, there was a little boy,\n      And, if you please, he went to school;\n    That little boy, he always would annoy,\n      And found at school a very nasty rule.\"\n\nWithout undue flattery to Master Trafford, we may conclusively state\nthat we deem his poem a great deal better than most of the =vers libre=\neffusions which so many of his elders are perpetrating nowadays!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Scot= for July is devoted completely to the work of the feminine\namateurs of the United States, and is announced by its editor as an\n\"American 'Petticoat' Number\"; a title which might possibly bear\nreplacement by something rather less colloquial. \"Over the Edge of the\nWorld,\" a poem by Olive G. Owen, is correct in construction and\nappropriate in sentiment, deriving much force from the continued\nrepetition of the first line. \"In Morven's Mead,\" by Winifred V. Jordan,\nis one of a series of fanciful poems all bearing the same title. The\npresent verses show all the charm and delicacy which characterise the\nwhole. \"Patience--A Woman's Virtue,\" is one of Mrs. Eloise N. Griffith's\nthoughtful moral essays, and is as commendable for its precepts as for\nits pure style. \"His Flapper,\" by Edna von der Heide, is a clever piece\nof trochaic verse in Cockney dialect, which seems, so far as an American\ncritic can judge, to possess a very vivid touch of local colour. \"An Eye\nfor an Eye,\" by the same authoress, seems vaguely familiar, having\npossibly been published in the amateur press before. If so, it is well\nworthy of republication. \"Women and Snakes,\" a sketch by Eleanor J.\nBarnhart, is not a misogynistical attempt at comparison, but a theory\nregarding the particular fear with which the former are popularly\nsupposed to regard the latter. Whilst Miss Barnhart writes with the\nbravery of the true scientist, we are constrained to remark that a\ncertain dislike of snakes, mice, and insects is a very real thing; not\nonly amongst the fair, but equally amongst those sterner masculine souls\nwho would stoutly deny it if questioned. It is an atavistical fear,\nsurviving from primitive ages when the venomous qualities of reptiles,\ninsects, and the like, made their quick avoidance necessary to\nuninstructed man. \"Be Tolerant,\" by Winifred V. Jordan, is a didactic\npoem of the sort formerly published in =The Symphony=. While it does not\npossess in fullest measure the grace and facility observed in Mrs.\nJordan's more characteristic work; it is nevertheless correct and\nmelodious, easily equalling most poetry of its kind. Mr. McColl's\neditorial column, the only masculine feature of the issue, contains a\nvery noble tribute to the two soldier cousins of Miss von der Heide, who\nhave laid down their lives for the cause of England and the right. From\nsuch men springs the glory of Britannia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Scot= for August opens with Winifred V. Jordan's tuneful lines, \"If\nYou but Smile,\" whose inspiration and construction are alike of no mean\norder. \"Hoary Kent,\" by Benjamin Winskill, is an exquisite sketch of a\nregion where the past still lives. In an age of turmoil and unrest, it\nis a comfort to think that in one spot, at least, the destroying claws\nof Time have left no scars. There lie the scenes dear to every son and\ngrandson of Britain; there are bodied forth the eternal and unchanging\ntraditions that place above the rest of the world\n\n    \"This precious stone set in the silver sea--\n    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.\"\n\n\"Meditation of a Scottish Queen on Imprisonment,\" a poem by Margaret\nTrafford, contains noble passages, but is marred by defective technique.\nPassing over the use of the expletives =do= and =doth= as legitimate\narchaisms in this case, we must call attention to some awkward\nphraseology, and to the roughness of certain lines, which have either\ntoo few or too many syllables. The very first line of the poem requires\ncontraction, which might be accomplished by substituting =hapless= for\n=unhappy=. Line 8 would read better if thus amended:\n\n    \"I would that death might come and me release.\"\n\nThe final line of the first stanza lacks a syllable, which might be\nsupplied by replacing =vile= with =hateful=. The second stanza will pass\nas it is, but the entire remainder of the poem requires alteration,\nsince but two of the lines are of normal decasyllabic length. The\nfollowing is rough revision, though we have not attempted to build the\npoetry anew:\n\n    Oh! could I breathe again dear Scotland's air;\n      Behold once more her stately mountains high,\n      Thence view the wide expanse of azure sky,\n    Instead of these perpetual walls so bare!\n\n    Could I but see the grouse upon the moor,\n      Or pluck again the beauteous heather bell!\n      Freedom I know not in this dismal cell,\n    As I my anguish from my heart outpour.\n\n    My Scotland! know'st thou thy poor Queen's distress,\n      And canst thou hear my wailing and my woe?\n      May the soft wind that o'er thy hills doth blow\n    Waft thee these thoughts, that I cannot suppress!\n\n\"Six Cylinder Happiness,\" a brief essay by William J. Dowdell, presents\nin ingeniously pleasing style a precept not entirely new amongst\nphilosophers. Mr. Dowdell's skill with the pen is very considerable,\nparticularly when he ventures outside the domain of slang. We should\nlike to suggest a slightly less colloquial title for this piece, such as\n\"Real Happiness.\" \"For Right and Liberty,\" a poem by Matthew Hilson, is\ncommendable in sentiment and clever in construction, but lacks\nperfection in several details of phraseology. In the third line of the\nthird stanza the word =ruinous= must be replaced by a true dissyllable,\npreferably =ruin'd=. \"For Their Country,\" a short story by Margaret\nTrafford, is vivid in plot and truly heroic in moral, but somewhat\ndeficient in technique, particularly at the beginning. Miss Trafford\nshould use care in moulding long sentences, and should avoid the\nemployment of abbreviations like =etc.= in the midst of narrative text.\n\"That Sunny Smile,\" by John Russell, is a cleverly optimistic bit of\nverse whose rhythm is very facile, but which would be improved by the\naddition of two syllables to the third and sixth lines of each stanza.\nThe rhyme of =round you= and =found true= is incorrect, since the second\nsyllables of double rhymes must be identical. \"The Evil One,\" by\nNarcissus Blanchfield, is announced as \"A Prose-poem, after Oscar\nWilde--a long way after.\" As an allegory it is true to the facts of the\ncase; though one cannot but feel that there is room for a freer play of\nthe poetic imagination in so great a subject.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Toledo Amateur= for October is a literary publication which reflects\nmuch credit upon its young editor, Mr. Wesley Hilon Porter, and upon the\nseveral contributors. \"Twilight,\" a correct and graceful poem by Miss\nvon der Heide opens the issue. \"A Sabbath,\" by Mary Margaret Sisson, is\na sketch of great merit, though not wholly novel in subject. The\nhypocrisy of many self-satisfied \"pillars of the church\" is only too\nwell known both in life and in literature. At the very close of the\npiece, the word =epithet= is used in a slightly incorrect sense, meaning\n\"motto.\" =Epithet=, as its Greek derivation shows, signifies an\n=adjective= or descriptive expression. \"The Workers of the World,\" by\nDora M. Hepner, is another sociological sketch of no small merit,\npleasantly distinguished by the absence of slang. \"Not All,\" by Olive G.\nOwen, is a poem of much fervour, albeit having a somewhat too free use\nof italics. The words and rhythm of a poet should be able to convey his\nimages without the more artificial devices of typographical variation.\nAnother questionable point is the manner of using archaic pronouns and\nverb forms. Miss Owen seems to use both ancient and modern conjugations\nof the verb indifferently with such subjects as =thou=. \"A Day at Our\nSummer Home,\" by Emma Marie Voigt, is a descriptive sketch of\nconsiderable promise, and \"My First Amateur Convention,\" by Mrs. Addie\nL. Porter, is a well written chronicle of events. \"The Wild Rose,\" by\nMarguerite Allen, is a poem of no little grace, though beset with many\nof the usual crudities of youthful work. In the first place, the\nquatrains should have their rhymes regularly recurring; either in both\nfirst and third, and second and fourth lines; or only in second and\nfourth. A rhyme occurring only in first and third lines gives an\nunmusical cast, since it causes the stanza to end unrhymed. Secondly,\nthe words =fence= and =scent= do not form a legitimate rhyme. The easy\ncorrectness of the metre is an encouraging sign, and indicates a poetic\ntalent which Miss Allen would do well to cultivate. Mr. Porter's article\non amateur journalism is interesting and quite just, though we hope that\nthe United has not quite so \"little to offer\" the devotee of \"so-called\nhigh-class literature\" as the author believes. If we are to retain our\ncultivated members, or our younger members after they acquire\ncultivation, we must necessarily cater to the better grade of taste;\nthough of course without neglecting the succeeding generation of\nnovices. The editorial column of this issue is bright and fluent,\nconcluding one of the best amateur journals of the season.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for September contains something only too seldom\nfound in the amateur press; a really meritorious short story. \"The\nShadow on the Trail,\" by Eleanor J. Barnhart, possesses every element of\ngood fiction; a substantial and really interesting plot, a logical\ndevelopment from beginning to conclusion, an adequate amount of\nsuspense, a climax which does not disappoint, and a praiseworthy degree\nof local colour. Besides all of which it is fluent in language and\ncorrect in syntax. The rest of the literary department in this issue is\ndevoted to verse. \"To a Friend,\" by Alice M. Hamlet, is particularly\npleasing through the hint of old-school technique which its well ordered\nphrases convey. The one weak point is the employment of =thy=, a\nsingular expression, in connexion with several objects; namely, \"paper,\npen, and ready hand.\" =Your= should have been used. The metre is\nexcellent throughout, and the whole piece displays a gratifying skill on\nits author's part. \"The Path Along the Sea,\" by Rev. Eugene B. Kuntz, is\na flawless and beautiful bit of sentimental poetry, cast in fluent and\nfelicitous heptameter. \"Dad,\" by Horace Fowler Goodwin, is decidedly the\nbest of this writer's pieces yet to appear in the amateur press. The\ndefects are mostly technical, including the bad rhyme of =engaged= and\n=dismayed=, and the overweighted seventh line of the final stanza. The\nlatter might be rectified by substituting =blest=, or some other\nmonosyllable, for =lucky=. \"Li'l Baby Mine,\" by W. Frank Booker, is a\nquaint and captivating darky lullaby, whose accuracy of dialect and\natmosphere comes from that first-hand knowledge of the negroes which\nonly a Southern writer can possess. Mr. Booker is one of our most\npromising bards, and will be doubly notable when his style shall have\nreceived its final polish. \"When I Gaze on Thee,\" by Kathleen Foster\nSmith, is an amatory poem of much grace and fluency.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for October furnishes us with a species of\ncomposition not frequently encountered in amateurdom; an official report\nwhich is also a literary classic. Pres. Campbell's message is really an\nessay on contemporary amateur journalism, and contains a multitude of\nwell stated truths which every member of the fraternity would do well to\nperuse. \"The Wanderer's Return,\" by Andrew Francis Lockhart, is a\nbeautiful piece of anapaestic verse whose flow is as pleasing as its\nsentiment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for October is edited by Mrs. Ida C. Haughton, and though\nnot of large size, does credit both to her and to the Columbus Club. \"To\nthe Woodbees,\" a witty parody of Poe's \"Annabel Lee,\" exhibits Miss\nIrene Metzger as the possessor of no little skill in numbers; and\nincidentally suggests that other young bards might well improve their\nstyles by judicious exercises of this sort. Much of the spirit of metre\nmay be absorbed through copying the works of the standard poets.\n\"Louise's Letter,\" a short story by Norma Sanger, contains some of the\ndefects of early composition, notably an undue hastening of the action\nimmediately after the letter quoted in the text. The plot involves a\nrather unusual coincidence, yet is probably no more overstrained than\nthat of the average piece of light fiction. \"The Ruling Passion,\" by\nEdna M. Haughton, is a story of phenomenal power and interest, forming a\npsychological study worthy of more than one perusal. All the\nrequirements of good fiction, both inspirational and technical, are\ncomplied with to the satisfaction of even the most exacting critic. Miss\nHaughton's work is of a very high grade, and would be welcomed in larger\nquantities by the amateur world. Miss Harwood's interesting News Notes\nand Mrs. Haughton's thoughtful editorial conclude an issue whose every\nfeature deserves commendation.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MAY 1917\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Conservative= for January deserved distinction for its opening\npoem, \"The Vagrant,\" which proceeds from the thrice-gifted pen of Mrs.\nW. V. Jordan. The piece is one well worthy of close attention, since it\ncontains to a marked degree those elements of charm which render its\nauthor so prominent among amateur bards. Bold and discriminating choice\nof words and phrases, apt and unique images and personifications, and a\ncarefully sustained atmosphere of delicate unreality, all unite to\nimpart a characteristic beauty to the lines. This beauty, searchingly\nanalysed, reveals itself as something more sylvan and spontaneous than\nstudied and bookish; indeed, all of Mrs. Jordan's verse is born rather\nthan built.\n\n\"The Unbreakable Link,\" a prose sketch by Arthur W. Ashby, is smooth and\ngraphic in its delineation of a dream or vision of the past. The ancient\nheritage of Old England and its hoary edifices is here vividly set\nforth. Mr. Ashby's work, always notable for its command and intelligent\ninterpretation of detail, is welcome wherever encountered.\n\n\"When New-Year Comes,\" a poem by Rev. Eugene B. Kuntz, exhibits its\nbrilliant author in a most felicitous though decidedly novel vein.\nTurning from his usual Alexandrines and heptameters, and laying aside\nhis characteristically stately and sonorous vocabulary, Dr. Kuntz has\nproduced a gem of brevity and simplicity in octosyllabic couplets. The\nease and naturalness of the language are so great that the reader feels\nno other words or constructions could have been used with equal effect.\nThe remainder of =The Conservative=, being the work of the present\ncritic, deserves no particular mention.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Coyote= for January bears an attractive cover design illustrating\nthe gentle beast after which the publication is named. The opening\npiece, an alleged poem by the present critic, contains an humiliating\nerror for which none but the author is responsible. The impossible word\n=supremest= in line 16, should read =sublimest=. The author is likewise\nresponsible for the omission of the following couplet after line 26:\n\n    \"Around his greatness pour disheart'ning woes,\n      But still he tow'rs above his conquering foes.\"\n\nThe rest of the magazine is devoted to prose of practical nature,\ncontaining suggestions by Editor Harrington and Rev. Graeme Davis for\nthe resuscitation of one of the dormant press associations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Coyote= for April, home-printed and reduced to the conventional 5\u00d77\npage, opens with Mrs. Jordan's pleasant lines on \"The Duty.\" While the\ngeneral sentiment of this piece is by no means novel, the powerful and\ndistinctive touch of the authoress is revealed by such highly original\npassages as the following:\n\n    \"And black-wing'd, clucking shadows\n      Brought out their broods of fears.\"\n\nA poet of rather different type is displayed in \"The Five-Minute\nSchool,\" by Lovell Leland Massie. Mr. Massie is said to have \"an\nunlimited supply of poems on hand which he desires to publish,\" but it\nis evident that some preliminary alterations would not be undesirable.\nIn the first place, the metre requires correction; though it is\nremarkably good for beginner's work. Particularly weak lines are the\nsecond in stanza four, and the second in stanza six. The phraseology is\nstiff but by no means hopeless, and proclaims nothing more serious than\nthe need of greater poetic familiarity on the author's part. The rhymes\nare good with two exceptions; =past= and =class=, and =jewel= and\n=school=. Mr. Massie, however, is not the first bard to reduce =jew-el=\nto \"=jool=!\" \"The Coyote,\" by Obert O. Bakken, is a worthy and\ninteresting composition upon a well known animal. \"A Soul,\" by Olive G.\nOwen, is reprinted from the professional press, and amply merits the\nhonour. The poem is of unexceptionable technique and adequate sentiment.\nMiss Owen's brilliant, fruitful, and long-continued poetical career has\nfew parallels in the amateur world. \"The Amateur Christian,\" a brief\nprose essay by Benjamin Winskill, presents more than one valuable truth;\nthough we wish the word \"=par=,\" near the close, might be expanded to\nproper fulness. We presume that it is intended to stand for =paragraph=.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Crazyquilt= for December is a highly entertaining illustrated\npublication whose exact classification is a matter of some difficulty.\nWe might perhaps best describe it as a bubbling over of youthful\nspirits, with here and there a touch of unobtrusive seriousness. The\neditor, Mr. Melvin Ryder, is to be commended upon his enterprise; which\nconsists in approximately equal parts of prose, verse, and whimsical\n=vers libre=. It is the last named product which most absorbs our\nattention, since the given specimens afford a very brilliant satire on\nthe absurd medium in which they are set. The choicest selections are due\nto the fertile pen of Mr. William S. Wabnitz, assisted by that not\nunknown classic called \"Mother Goose,\" whose ideas accord well with the\nthought of the new \"poetry.\" \"A Futuresk Romance,\" by Mr. Wabnitz alone,\nis of exceeding cleverness. Among the genuine poems, we may give\nparticular commendation to \"Bluebirds are Flying Over,\" by Mrs. Dora\nHepner Moitoret; \"Longin' and Yearnin',\" \"Spring,\" \"Verses,\" and\n\"Dreaming,\" by J. H. Gavin; and \"Stars After Rain,\" by William S.\nWabnitz. Mr. Gavin's \"Dreaming\" is a hauntingly pretty piece, though\nmarred by an imperfect line (the twelfth) and by an incorrect\naccentuation of the word =romance=. This word should be accented on the\nfinal syllable.\n\n\"Odd Patches and Even\" is the title of the editorial column, which\ncontains many words of wisdom (though not too grave) by Mr. Ryder. We\nhope to behold future issues of =The Crazyquilt=.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Dowdell's Bearcat= for October, partly compiled and financed by the\nUnited's official board in lieu of the missing =Official Quarterly=,\ncomes to us unbound and without a cover; yet contains, aside from the\ninexcusable editorials, a rich array of meritorious material. Mr.\nDowdell's comment on radical eccentrics and malcontents is apt and\nclever, showing how bright this young writer can be when he avoids bad\ntaste and personalities.\n\n\"A Little Lovely Lyric,\" by Mrs. Dora H. Moitoret, is one of the\nchoicest of this author's poems, having a spirit and cadence of rare\nquality. In \"The Real Amateur Spirit,\" Pres. Campbell presents in\nvigorous prose many important truths and principles of amateur\njournalism. The concluding sentence forms a definition of our animating\nimpulse which deserves repeated publication as a motto and inspiration.\n\"An American To Mother England,\" by the present critic, is an expression\nof cultural and ancestral ties which have now, through the fortunes of\nwar, grown doubly strong. The word =Saxon=, in the last line, should\nbegin with a capital. \"Dream Life\" is a vivid piece of prose mysticism\nby our versatile and gifted Vice-President, Mr. Ira A. Cole. Defying\nprecise grouping either as a sketch or a story, this enigmatical bit of\nfancy deserves highest praise for its fluent diction, rich imagination,\npotent atmosphere, and graphic colouring. Mr. Cole has a bright future\nin prose as well as in verse for in both of these media he is a genuine\nand spontaneous poet. \"United Impressions,\" by Mrs. E. L. Whitehead, is\nclear, interesting, and well-written, as is also the sketch by Mary M.\nSisson entitled \"Passion versus Calm.\" \"The Elm Tree,\" by James Tobey\nPyke, is a poem of remarkable sweetness and nobility, through whose\nlofty sentiment shines the true splendour of the inspired bard. There is\na master touch in the passage referring to\n\n    \"----a sweet heaven\n    Of singing birds and whispering leaves.\"\n\nMrs. Winifred Virginia Jordan, without one of whose delightful verses no\namateur publication can really compete, contributes a sparkling\nsuccession of amatory anapaests entitled \"Dear.\" The middle stanza rises\nto great lyric heights, and should prove especially captivating to such\ndiscriminating critics of lyricism as our colleague Mr. Kleiner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Enthusiast= for February is a hectographed publication issued by\nour latest young recruit, Mr. James Mather Mosely of Westfield, Mass.\nMr. Mosely is a youth of sterling ability and great promise, whose work\nis already worthy of notice and encouragement. The editor's leading\narticle, \"The Secret Inspiration of a Man Who Made Good,\" shows unusual\nfluency and literary assurance, though we might wish for a more\ndignified title. The expression =to make good= is pure slang, and should\nbe supplanted by one of the many legitimate English words and phrases\nwhich convey the same meaning. Mr. Mosely's editorials are likewise open\nto criticism on the ground of colloquialism, though the natural\nexuberance of youth excuses much. \"The Birds,\" by Harold Gordon Hawkins,\nis a truly excellent specimen of juvenile verse, which contains much\npromise for the author's efforts. Increased familiarity with standard\nliterary models will remove all evidences of stiffness now perceptible.\n\"How Men Go Wrong,\" a conventional moral homily by Edgar Holmes Plummer,\nshows a slight want of original ideas and a tendency to commonplaces;\nthough having much merit in construction. Another subject might display\nMr. Plummer's talent to better advantage. The use of the word =habitat=\nfor =inhabitant= or =denizen= is incorrect, for its true meaning is a\n=natural locality= or =place of habitation=. \"Blueberry Time,\" by Ruth\nFoster, is obviously a schoolgirl composition, albeit a pleasing one.\n\nF. R. Starr's cartoon scarcely comes within the province of a literary\ncritic, but is doubtless an excellent example of elementary art. We\nquestion, however, the place of popular cartoons in serious papers; the\n\"funny picture\" habit is essentially a plebeian one, and alien to\njournalism of the highest grade. All things considered, =The Enthusiast=\nis a creditable exponent of junior letters, which deserves the\nencouragement and support of the United.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Excelsior= for March is in many respects the most notable of the\nseason's amateur magazines edited by our brilliant Laureate Recorder,\nMiss Verna McGeoch, it contains a surprisingly ample and impressive\ncollection of prose and verse by our best writers; including the\ndelectable lyricist Perrin Holmes Lowrey, whose work has hitherto been\nunrepresented in the press of the United. The issue opens with Mr.\nJonathan E. Hoag's stately \"Ode to Old Ocean,\" whose appropriate imagery\nand smooth couplets are exceedingly pleasant to the mind and ear alike.\nMr. Hoag's unique charm is no less apparent in the longer reminiscent\npiece entitled \"The Old Farm Home,\" which describes the author's boyhood\nscenes at Valley Falls, New York, where he was born more than eighty-six\nyears ago. This piece has attracted much favorable notice in the\nprofessional world, having been reprinted in =The Troy Times=. Perrin\nHolmes Lowrey contributes a cycle of three poems touching on the\nbeauties of the month of April; one of which, \"April in Killarney,\" will\nthis summer be set to music by Leopold Godowsky. The style of Mr. Lowrey\npossesses an attractive individuality and delicacy which is already\nbringing him celebrity in the larger literary sphere. What could be more\nthoroughly enchanting than such a stanza as the following?\n\n    \"Oh, it's April in Killarney,\n    Early April in Killarney,\n      Where the Irish lanes are merry\n        And the lyric breezes blow;\n      And the scented snows of cherry\n      Drift across the fields of Kerry--\n    Oh, it's April in Killarney\n        And she loves the April so.\"\n\n\"Treasure Trove,\" by Henry Cleveland Wood, is a pleasant and urbane bit\nof light verse; while \"Percival Lowell,\" by Howard Phillips Lovecraft,\nis an abominably dull elegiac piece of heavy verse. Edwin Gibson's\n\"Sonnet to Acyion\" deserves keen attention as the work of a capable and\nrapidly developing young bard. \"Real versus Ideal\" is a bright metrical\ndivertissement by John Russell, which suffers through the omission of\nthe opening line by the printer. This line is:\n\n    \"For sale--a cottage by the sea.\"\n\nWe recommend the final line to the attention of those careless bards who\npronounce =real= as =reel=, and =ideal= as =ideel=. The correct\nquantities, as there given, will serve as examples. Verse of deeper\nquality is furnished by amateurdom's foremost expressionist, Anne\nTillery Renshaw, two of whose poems appear. \"The Singing Sea\" contains\nan error of technique, =hope= and =note= being placed in attempted\nrhyme; but the structure is in general very regular, considering the\nauthor's radical theories. Of the merit of the sentiment it is\nunnecessary to speak. \"A Wish\" is cast in less fluent metre, but is so\nreplete with aptness, grandeur and refinement of ideas, that the\nsternest critic must needs view its form with lenient glance. The prose\ncontents of =Excelsior= are worthy company for the verse. Paul J.\nCampbell is represented by a very brief though characteristic essay\nentitled \"The Price of Freedom,\" wherein appears the sound reasoning and\ncourageous philosophy for which Mr. Campbell has always been\ndistinguished. Another notable essay or review is \"English History,\" by\nHenry Clapham McGavack. Mr. McGavack here ably employs his keen analysis\nand lucid style in dissecting Prof. Meyer's absurdly biased but\ndiabolically clever pro-German History of England.\n\n\"The Association,\" by David H. Whittier, teems with good advice\nconcerning the proper management of the United. Mr. Whittier's style is\nsmooth and dignified, exhibiting a sober maturity unusual for a young\nauthor. \"Tonio's Salvation,\" a short story by Edna von der Heide, is the\nonly bit of fiction in the magazine. This brief glimpse of the\ncosmopolitan child life of a modern city is marked equally by\nnaturalness of plot and facility of technic, forming a piece quite\nprofessional in quality and atmosphere. =Excelsior= has done much to\nsustain the best traditions of the United, and we hope its future\nappearance will be frequent and regular. The editorial column reveals\nthe genius and exquisite taste of its gifted publisher.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Merry Minutes= for December-January is an interesting number of an\ninteresting publication, opening with some extremely clever cartoons by\nthe United's soldier-member, George William Stokes. \"Merry Minutes,\" a\npoem in trochaic measure by Olive G. Owen, is distinguished by the touch\nof beauty characteristic of all its author's work; but has a singular\nsort of rhyming in the first and third lines of the stanzas. The cadence\nseems to call for double rhymes, yet only the final syllables agree. The\nlast word of the first stanza is unfortunately shorn by the printer of\nits final =s=. \"The Dancing Tiger\" is an excellent short story by\nRaymond Blathwayt, which might, however, be improved in style by a\nslightly closer attention to punctuation and structure of sentences.\n\"Home,\" by Margaret Mahon, is a poem in that rather popular modern\nmeasure which seems to waver betwixt the iambus and anapaest. The\nimagery is pleasing, and the sentiment, though not novel, is acceptable.\n\"The Choice,\" a serial story by Beryl Mappin, exhibits the same\nimmaturities of style which mark the didactic articles of this author;\nyet so active is the imagination shown in some of the passages, that we\nbelieve Miss Mappin requires only time and harder study in order to\nbecome a very meritorious writer. The syntactical structure of this\nstory is, on the average, smoother than that of Miss Mappin's essays;\nindeed, there is reason to believe that fiction is the better suited to\nher pen. \"Absence,\" by Winifred Virginia Jordan, is a brief poem of\nfaultless harmony whose quaintly sparkling imagery gives to an old theme\na new lustre. \"Education in Trinidad\" is another of F. E. Hercules'\nterse and informing descriptive sketches. \"Alley,\" by Mrs. Jordan, is a\nlight pulsing lyric of almost Elizabethan quality, one of whose rhymes\nis of a type which has caused much discussion in the United's critical\ncircles. The native pronunciation of New England makes of =scarf= and\n=laugh= an absolutely perfect rhyme; this perfection depending upon the\ncurtailed phonetic value of the letter =r=; which in a place such as\nthis is silent, save as it modifies the quality of the preceding vowel.\nIn the London of Walker's day the same condition existed. But the tongue\nand ear of the American West have become accustomed to a certain roll\nwhich causes =scarf= to be enunciated as =scarrf=, thus throwing it out\nof rhyme with words of similar sound which lack the =r=. The Westerner\nwould have to write =scahf=, in order to express to his own mind the\nNew-England sound of =scarf=. Hitherto, the present critic has called no\nnotice to rhymes of this type; and has, indeed, frequently employed them\nhimself; but recognition of etymological principles involved will\nhereafter impel him to abandon and discourage the practice, which was\nnot followed by the older classicists. To the New-England author this\nrenunciation means relinquishment of many rhymes which are to his ear\nperfect, yet in the interests of tradition and universality it seems\ndesirable that the sacrifice be made. \"Why Mourn Thy Soldier Dead,\" is a\npoem of brave sorrow by Olive G. Owen. The fervour of the lines is deep,\nand the sentiments are of great nobility. Structurally the piece is\nflawless. \"Chaucer, the Father of English Poetry,\" is the third of Miss\nMappin's series of articles on literary history. An unfortunate misprint\nrelegates to the bottom of the footnote a line which should immediately\nfollow the specimen verse. The style is decidedly clearer and better\nthan that of the preceding instalment of the series. \"When You Went,\" by\nMrs. Jordan, is an engagingly pathetic poem; with just that touch of the\nunseen which lends so particular a charm to Jordanian verse. Miss\nTrafford's appealing lines on \"A Girl to Her Dead Lover\" form a vividly\npathetic glimpse into low life. The poetic form is quite satisfactory.\nAs a whole, =Merry Minutes= constitutes a rather remarkable enterprise,\nsustaining through troubled times the spark of activity which will\nkindle anew the fires of British amateur journalism after the victorious\nclose of the war. May America, in her new crisis, do as well!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Merry Minutes= for February opens with Margaret Mahon's poem \"God's\nSolace,\" a smooth and restful bit of versification. \"Spencer and the\nBeginning of the Elizabethan Era\" is the current article of Beryl\nMappin's series on English Literature, and contains some very promising\npassages, especially the almost poetic introduction. Miss Mappin has an\nunusual fund of knowledge, and a pleasing gift of expression; but these\nadvantages are as yet not fully systematised or marshalled to best\neffect. Miss Trafford's serial, \"The Pursuit of the Innocent,\" concludes\nin this number. This story bears many of the signs of juvenile\nworkmanship, the present instalment being so hurried in action that it\nalmost attains the brevity of a synopsis. Careful and analytical perusal\nof standard fiction would assist greatly in maturing and perfecting the\nauthor's style. \"Religion and Superstition\" is the current article in\nF. E. M. Hercules' interesting series on Trinidad; and exhibits all the\npolish, lucidity and conciseness of its predecessors. \"His Photo,\" by\nMaster Randolph Trafford, is a very promising poem by a youthful bard.\nEvery rhyme is correct, which is more than can be claimed for a great\ndeal of the poesy perpetrated by older and more pretentious versifiers\non this side of the Atlantic. The present instalment of \"The Choice,\" by\nBeryl Mappin, is marked by considerable fluency and animation, though\npossessed of certain limitations previously mentioned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Merry Minutes= for March commences with the present critic's dull lines\n\"On Receiving a Picture of the Marshes at Ipswich.\" Passing to more\nmeritorious matter, we encounter Miss Mappin's latest literary article,\n\"Shakespeare,\" which interests even whilst it reveals deficiencies of\nprose technique. \"Jimmy's Little Girl,\" by Joseph Parks, is a vivid\ntranscript of military life by a military author. While the tale is not\none of vast originality, it nevertheless recommends itself through\nsimplicity and verisimilitude. Miss Mappin's serial \"The Choice,\"\nconcludes in this issue. It is very praiseworthy for its many colourful\npassages, but mildly censurable for its melodramatic atmosphere and\nrhetorical lapses. The opening sentence of this instalment contains\ninstances of both of these faults: \"A terrible foreboding gripped\nChristabel's heart in bands of steel, as if for a moment to cleave her\ntongue to the roof of her mouth.\" This is the last number of the\npublication to appear under the present name. Beginning with the April\nissue it will be known as =The Little Budget=; and will contain, on the\naverage, a rather higher grade of reading matter than heretofore. But in\nforming a judgment of any kind, it is well to recognize that the\nmagazine's appeal is frankly popular.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Pep= for February is the first number of a somewhat extraordinary\nenterprise conducted by George W. Macauley with the laudable object of\nwaking up a sleeping amateurdom. The editor very justly takes the press\nassociations to task for their manifold sins, particularly the dubious\ncircumstances surrounding a recent convention, in which it is needless\nto say the United had no part. Mr. Macauley's literary attainments are\nvery considerable, but as yet unperfected. Possessed of rare charm in\ndescriptive prose, he needs to exercise a greater nicety of construction\nin order to develop fully the riches which are his. Gifted with a large,\nfacile, and ingenious vocabulary, he is not sufficiently precise and\ndiscriminating in his employment of words according to their finer\nshades of meaning. This carelessness makes faults of his very virtues;\nfor his vigour of expression tends to take the form of =outre= and\ninadmissible rhetoric, whilst his talent for word-painting tends to\ndegenerate into word-coining. It would be quite possible for an acute\ncritic to compile a dictionary of peculiarly Macaulian words and\nphrases, to which the current =Pep= might contribute such terms as\n=probverb= (proverb?). Spelling and punctuation also should claim more\nof Mr. Macauley's time and attention; for he might easily avoid such\nslips as =believeing=, =it's= (for =its=), =thots=, and the like. In\nshort, Mr. Macauley is at present a gifted writer and brilliant editor\nlabouring under the disadvantages of haste, carelessness, and perhaps a\ndash of radicalism.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Phoenician= for Spring is the first number of an enthusiastically\nconducted semi-professional venture of juvenile nature, whose connexion\nwith the United hinges on the associate editorship of our clever\nrecruit, Mr. James Mather Mosely. Like =Merry Minutes=, this publication\nis of the popular rather than conservative sort; being obviously\ndesigned primarily to please, secondarily to instruct. We deplore the\nuse of commonplace and sensational topics, colloquial expressions, and\nmalformed spelling; but make due concessions to the youth of the\neditorial staff and the nascent state of the periodical. So promising\nare the young publishers that time cannot fail to refine and mature\ntheir efforts. \"An Hour with a Lunatic,\" by Harry B. Sadik, is a very\nshort and very thrilling tale of the \"dime novel\" variety. Mr. Sadik has\na commendable sense of the dramatic, which would serve him well should\nhe choose a less sensational field of endeavour. \"Our Soldiers,\" a\nCanadian mother's war song by Mrs. Minnie E. Taylor, exhibits merit,\nthough having many signs of imperfect technic. In line 2 of the first\nstanza =bid= should be replaced by =bade=. The final rhyme of the poem,\nthat of =gain= and =name=, is false and inadmissible. Metrically there\nis much roughness, which careful study and diligent reading of good\nverse can in time correct. \"Candy and Health,\" and \"If You Were Down and\nOut,\" by James Mather Mosely, are two typical newspaper interviews with\nrepresentative men. Mr. Mosely shows much aptitude as a reporter, having\nan almost professional ease and fluency. This is not literature, but it\nis good journalism. \"The Dinner Never Paid For,\" by Viola Jameson, is a\npiece of characteristic light fiction; commendably innocuous, and not at\nall overburdened with philosophical complexity. \"The Secret of Success,\"\nby Edith L. Clark, is a promising bit of didactic prose. \"The End of the\nRoad,\" by Pearl K. Merritt, is a brief essay of substantial worth. \"The\nToll of the Sea,\" a poem by Harold Gordon Hawkins, shows considerable\nmerit despite irregularities. \"Memories,\" by Arthur Goodenough, well\nsustains the high poetical reputation of its author, though it is\ncruelly marred by the illogical and censurable \"simplified\" spelling\nwhich the young editors see fit to employ. One line affords a silent but\nstriking instance of the utter senselessness and confusion of the new\northographical fad. This line reads:\n\n    \"Of human =thot= might well be =wrought=.\"\n\nNow in the first place, =thot= does not express the true pronunciation\nof =thought=. The word, thus written, tends to acquire the vocal quality\nof =shot= or =blot=, as distinguished from =taught= or =brought=.\nSecondly, in this place it is out of accord with =wrought=, which is\ncorrectly spelled. If Messrs. Plummer and Mosely would be logical, let\nthem write =wrought= as =wrot=--or perhaps plain =rot= would be still\nmore correct and phonetic, besides furnishing a laconic punning\ncommentary on simple spelling in general. =The Phoenician's= editorial\ncolumn is conducted with laudable seriousness, the item of \"The Power of\nBooks\" being well worthy of perusal. What could best be spared from the\nmagazine are the vague jokes and cartoons, purposeless \"fillers\" of\nmiscellaneous nature, and columns of idle gossip about things in\ngeneral. Some of the moving picture items are greatly suggestive of what\na newspaper man would dub \"press agent stuff.\" The magazine represents a\ndegree of purpose and energy quite rare amongst the anaemic youth of\ntoday, and should receive corresponding encouragement from the members\nof the United. Those who are inclined to censure its professional aspect\nwould do well to remember the much-vaunted beginnings of amateur\njournalism, when the most highly respected sheets were of this selfsame\nvariety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for November is heavily burdened with a sombre and\nsinister short story from our own pen, entitled \"The Alchemist.\" This is\nour long unpublished credential to the United, and constitutes the first\nand only piece of fiction we have ever laid before a critical and\ndiscerning public wherefore we must needs beg all the charitable\nindulgence the Association can extend to an humble though ambitious\ntyro. A more interesting feature of the magazine is the biography of Mr.\nFritter, written by our brilliant Official Editor, Andrew Francis\nLockhart. Mr. Lockhart's quaint and friendly prose style is here\ndisplayed at its best, giving a vivid and sympathetic portrayal of his\nprominent subject. \"Beyond the Law,\" by Mary Faye Durr, is a light short\nstory of excellent idea and construction, whose only censurable point is\nthe use of \"simplified\" spelling. We believe that some procedure of\nquite drastic nature should be taken against the spread of this empty\ninnovation before our settled orthography shall have become completely\ndisorganized. Even in the United we can \"do our bit.\" Our editors should\nband together in an effort to exclude the new forms from their\npublications, and our manuscript managers should see that every piece\npassing through their hands is duly purged of these radical distortions.\nAt the same time, a series of articles explaining and analysing the\nspelling problem should be given wide publicity. The poetry in this\nissue is of encouraging quality. George M. Whiteside, in \"Dream of the\nIdeal,\" gives indications of real genius; at the same time displaying a\nlittle of the technical infelicity which has marked his earlier verse.\nMr. Whiteside's greatest weakness is in the domain of rhyme, a\nnoticeable error in the present poem being the attempted rhyming of\n=hours= with =bars= and =stars=. \"I Know a Garden,\" by Agnes Richmond\nArnold, is a tuneful and beautiful lyric of a somewhat Elizabethan type.\nThe metre, as the lines are rendered, appears to be quite unusual; but\nscansion reveals the fact that it is none other than the octosyllabic\ncouplet, disguised by the printer's art.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for December begins with \"A Girl's Ambition,\" a poem\nby Margaret Trafford. The general idea of the piece is both ingenious\nand appropriate, but the language and technical development leave\nconsiderable to be desired. In the first place, the rhyming plan is\nunfortunate; the opening and concluding couplets of each stanza being\nunrhymed. In the second place, the metre is irregular; departing very\nwidely in places from the iambic heptameter which appears to be the\ndominant measure. Miss Trafford should cultivate an ear for rhythm, at\nthe same time counting very carefully the syllables in each line she\ncomposes. A third point requiring mention is the occasional awkwardness\nof expression, a juvenile fault which will doubtless amend itself in\ntime. Just now we will call attention to only one defect--the\nexceedingly forced abbreviation \"=dresses'd=\" for =dresses would=. \"To\nMy Physician,\" by M. Estella Shufelt, is a smooth, graceful, and serious\npoem whose only possible fault is the infrequency of rhyme. This is not\na technical defect, since the plan of construction is well maintained\nthroughout; but we believe a poem of this type requires more than one\nrhyme to each stanza of eight lines. \"The Old Inn,\" a stirring short\nstory by Gertrude L. Merkle, is a very promising piece of work, albeit\nsomewhat conventional and melodramatic. The alliterative romance of\nHarry Henders and Hazel Hansen has a genuinely mid-Victorian flavour.\n\"Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" a short story by Ida Cochran Haughton, is a\nghastly and gruesome anecdote of the untenanted clay; related by a\nvillage dressmaker. The author reveals much comprehension of rural\npsychology in her handling of the theme; an incident which might easily\nshake the reason of a sensitive and imaginative person, merely\n\"unnerves\" the two quaint and prim maiden ladies. Poe would have made of\nthis tale a thing to gasp and tremble at; Mrs. Haughton, with the same\nmaterial, constructs genuine though grim comedy!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for January contains Editor Lockhart's captivatingly\ngraceful retrospect of the older amateur journalism, concluding with a\njust and eloquent appeal for the revival of our ancient enthusiasm. \"Who\nPays,\" by Helene H. Cole, is a brief and tragic story of considerable\nsociological significance. We deplore the use of the false verbal form\n=alright=; for while the expression =all right= may well occur in\nconversation of the character uttering it, the two words should be\nwritten out in full. \"To a Babe,\" by Olive G. Owen, embodies in\nimpeccable verse a highly clever and pleasing array of poetical\nconceits; and deserves to be ranked amongst the choicest of recent\namateur offerings. \"Girls are Like Gold,\" by Paul J. Campbell, is a\nstriking and witty adaptation of Thomas Hood's celebrated lines on\n\n    \"Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold!\n    Bright and yellow, hard and cold.\"\n\nMr. Campbell exhibits both ingenuity and metrical ability in this facile\n=jeu d'esprit=.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for March contains \"Love's Scarlet Roses,\" an\nexquisite piece of lyric verse by Mary Henrietta Lehr of California.\nMiss Lehr, a scholar and poetic genius of high order, is a prominent\namateur of a few years ago, lately returned to activity after a period\nof endeavour in other fields. Her verse is uniformly distinguished by\ndepth of inspiration, delicacy of sentiment, and grace of structure;\noccupying a place amongst the rarest products of amateurdom. Another\npoem of remarkable merit in this issue is \"The Gods' Return,\" by Olive\nG. Owen. Inspired by a recent article from the pen of Richard Le\nGallienne, these well-wrought lines interpret one of the subtlest yet\nmost potent of the varied moods created in the human breast by the\nmomentous occurrences of the age. Looking over the file of THE UNITED\nAMATEUR for the present administrative year, one may discover a diverse\nand meritorious array of poetry and prose, which amply proves the\ncontention of Pres. Campbell that a literary official organ is not only\nfeasible but eminently desirable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for January introduces to amateurdom a new bard, Mr. J.\nMorris Widdows, Hoosier exponent of rural simplicity. Mr. Widdows has\nenjoyed considerable success in the professional world as a poet,\nsong-writer, and musical composer; hence it is no untried or faltering\nquill which he brings within our midst. \"Stringtown on the Pike,\" which\nadorns the first page of the magazine, is a very pleasing bit of dialect\nverse whose accent and cadences suggest the work of the late James\nWhitcomb Riley. The metre is gratifyingly correct, and the rusticisms\nexceedingly colourful; though the average reader might find it somewhat\ndifficult to associate the name Miko with Yankee countryside. Such a\npraenomen carries with it suggestions of a rich brogue rather than a\nnasal drawl. \"Personal Liberty,\" a brilliant short essay by Leo Fritter,\nably and sensibly explodes one of the characteristically specious\narguments of the liquor advocates. Mr. Fritter's legal training aids him\nin presenting a clear, polished, and logical arraignment of\nanti-prohibition hypocrisy. \"Just a Little Love Tale,\" by Elizabeth M.\nBallou, is a smoothly constructed bit of very light fiction. Mrs.\nHaughton's editorial, \"A Review of Reviews,\" is concise and sensible;\ngiving a merited rebuke to those who seek to create unrest and\ndissatisfaction in amateur journalism.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Woodbee= for April is an ample and attractive number, opening with\nDora H. Moitoret's excellent poem in the heroic couplet, \"The April\nMaiden.\" The metre of this piece follows the fashion of the nineteenth\nrather than of the eighteenth century, having very few \"end-stopt\" lines\nor sense-limiting couplets. The final rhyme of =caprice= and =these= is\nsomewhat imperfect, the effect being that of an attempted rhyme of =s=\nand =z=. \"Her Fateful Day,\" a short story by Maude Dolby, is pleasing\nand ingenious despite certain improbabilities. \"Ashes of Roses,\" by\nFrieda M. Sanger, belongs to that abnormal and lamentable type of\npseudo-literature known as =vers libre=, and is the first serious\nspecimen of its kind ever inflicted upon the United. We are sincerely\nsorry that one so gifted as Miss Sanger should descend to this hybrid,\nmakeshift medium, when she could so well express her thoughts either in\nlegitimate prose or legitimate verse. \"Free Verse\" has neither the flow\nof real verse nor the dignity of real prose. It tends to develop\nobnoxious eccentricities of expression, and is closely associated with\nbizarre and radical vagaries of thought. It is in nine cases out of ten\na mere refuge of the obtuse, hurried, indolent, ignorant, or negligent\nbard who cannot or will not take the time and pains to compose genuine\npoetry or even passable verse. It has absolutely no justification for\nexistence, and should be shunned by every real aspirant to literary\nexcellence, no matter how many glittering inducements it seems to hold\nout. True, a person of very little knowledge or ability can make himself\nappear extremely cultured, aesthetic, and aristocratic by juggling a few\nempty words in the current fashion; scribbling several lines of unequal\nlength, each beginning with a capital letter. It is an admirably easy\nway to acquire a literary reputation without much effort. As the late\nW. S. Gilbert once wrote of a kindred fad:\n\n      \"The meaning doesn't matter\n      If it's only idle chatter\n    Of a transcendental kind.\"\n\nBut we believe that the members of the United are more earnest and solid\nin their ambition, hence we advise Miss Sanger to turn her undoubted\ntalent into more substantial channels. That she possesses genuine poetic\ngenius is amply evident, even from the specimen of =vers libre= before\nus. The labour of real versification will be more arduous, but the\nfruits will prove richer in proportion. It is better to glean a little\ngold than much fools' gold. Miss Sanger's nephew, Mr. Norman Sanger, is\nmore conservative in his tastes, and is creditably represented by his\nlines on \"The Ol' Fishin' Hole.\" This piece contains many of the\nrhythmical defects common to juvenile composition, but is pervaded by a\nnaturalness and pastoral simplicity which promise well for its young\nauthor. Wider reading and closer rhetorical study will supply all that\nMr. Sanger now lacks. At present we should advise him to seek metrical\nregularity by taking some one well defined line as a model, and moulding\nall the others to it by counting the syllables and intoning the accents\nin each. In the case of the present poem, the very first line will serve\nas a perfect guide; its conformity to the iambic heptameter plan being\nabsolute. The alternating stresses of the fourteen syllables should be\nnoted and copied:\n\n    \"The =days= are =get=-tin' =balm=-y =now=, and =first=-est =thing=\n            you =know=.\"\n\nTwo defects of rhyme are to be noted. =By= and =lullaby= cannot properly\nbe rhymed, since the rhyming syllables are =identical=, instead of\nmerely =similar=. \"=Rapcher=\" and =laughter= do not rhyme at all. Miss\nHaughton's essay \"Is a Lie Ever Justifiable?\" forms a prominent feature\nof the magazine, and presents some very ingenious though dogmatic\nreasoning. Mrs. Haughton's editorial, \"United We Stand,\" is an\nexceedingly timely appeal for genuine amateur activity, and should be of\nmuch value in stimulating a renaissance of the Association. The passage\nreading \"Who has been the latest victim of Cupid? =Whom= of Hymen?\"\narouses a query as to the grammatical status of =whom=. We fear this is\nwhat Franklin P. Adams of the =New York Tribune= playfully calls a\n\"=Cyrilization=.\" It is, as all readers of \"The Conning Tower\" can\ntestify, a remarkably common error; and one into which many of the\nleading authors of the age frequently fall. The jingle \"A Soldier's\nDelight,\" by George William Stokes, concludes the current issue in\ntuneful manner.\n\nAmidst the present dearth of amateur magazines it is ever a delight to\nbehold =The Woodbee=; meritorious in contents and regular in issuance.\nThe debt of the United to the Columbus Club is indeed a heavy one.\n\n                                                  H. P. LOVECRAFT,\n                                                             Chairman.\n\n\n\n\n                   THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n VOLUME XVI    GEORGETOWN, ILL., JULY, 1917    NUMBER 9\n\n\nODE FOR JULY FOURTH, 1917\n\n    As Columbia's brave scions, in anger array'd,\n      Once defy'd a proud monarch and built a new nation;\n    'Gainst their brothers of Britain unsheath'd the sharp blade\n      That hath ne'er met defeat nor endur'd desecration;\n          So must we in this hour\n          Show our valour and pow'r,\n    And dispel the black perils that over us low'r:\n      Whilst the sons of Britannia, no longer our foes,\n      Will rejoice in our triumphs and strengthen our blows!\n\n    See the banners of Liberty float in the breeze\n      That plays light o'er the regions our fathers defended;\n    Hear the voice of the million resound o'er the leas,\n      As the deeds of the past are proclaim'd and commended;\n          And in splendour on high\n          Where our flags proudly fly,\n    See the folds we tore down flung again to the sky:\n      For the Emblem of England, in kinship unfurl'd,\n      Shall divide with Old Glory the praise of the world!\n\n    Bury'd now are the hatreds of subject and King,\n      And the strife that once sunder'd an Empire hath vanish'd.\n    With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring\n      As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish'd:\n          And the broad British sea,\n          Of her enemies free,\n    Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia, to thee:\n      For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side,\n      Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!\n\n                                            H. P. LOVECRAFT.\n\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Conservative= for July opens with Ira A. Cole's delightful and\nmelodious lines \"In Vita Elysium\" (Heaven in Life), which present a\nstrong arraignment of those conventional theologians who deem all things\nbeautiful reserved for a vague existence after death. While the orthodox\nreader may deem the flight of the imagination too free, the rational and\nappreciative litterateur will delight in the vigour of imagination and\ndelicacy of fancy displayed. The metrical structure is beyond reproach\nin taste and fluency, the regular and spirited heroic couplets affording\na refreshing contrast to the harsh and languid measures of the day. Mr.\nCole's poetical future is bright indeed, for he possesses an innate\nconception of fitness and poetic values which too few of his\ncontemporaries can boast. We wish to emphasize to those readers who are\nfamiliar with =The Conservative's= editorial policy, that the lines\nappear practically without revision; every bold conception and stroke of\ngenius being Mr. Cole's own. Two couplets in particular delight the ear\nand the imagination, proving the author's claim to distinction as a poet\nof the purest classical type:\n\n    \"Go! Go! vain man, to those unbounded fanes\n    Where God's one proven priest--fair Nature--reigns.\"\n\n    \"Uplifted, glad, thy spirit then shall know\n    That life is light, and heaven's here below!\"\n\n\"The Genesis of the Revolutionary War,\" by Henry Clapham McGavack, is\none of those searchingly keen bits of iconoclastic analysis which have\nmade Mr. McGavack so famous as an essayist since his advent to the\nUnited. Our author here explodes conclusively a large body of bombastic\nlegend which false textbooks have inflicted upon successive generations\nof innocent American youth. We are shown beyond a doubt that the\nRevolution of 1776 was no such one-sided affair as the petty political\n\"historians\" would have us believe, and that our Mother Country indeed\nhad a strong case before the bar of International justice. It is an\narticle which makes us doubly proud of our racial and cultural\naffiliations.\n\n\"Sweet Frailty,\" a poem by Mary Henrietta Lehr, contains all those\nelements of charm, delicacy, and ingenuity which mark its author as one\nof amateurdom's most cultivated and gifted members.\n\nOf the editorial column modesty forbids us to speak, but we hope the\namateur public may be duly charitable with our shortcomings as therein\ndisplayed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Inspiration= for April is a \"Tribute Number,\" dedicated to the\namateur journalists of Great Britain and Canada who have devoted their\nlives and fortunes to the cause of civilisation and the Empire. With so\nwonderfully inspiring a subject, it is small wonder that the magazine\nlives gloriously up to its name. Miss von der Heide shows extreme skill\nand sympathy in the editorship of the publication, and in the verses\nwhich she contributes; proving herself worthy indeed of the high place\nshe has occupied in amateurdom for so many years.\n\n\"The Lion's Brood,\" by Henry Clapham McGavack, exhibits the versatility\nof this brilliant writer; for though he is by preference a concise\nessayist, he here rises to great heights in the domain of rhetorical\npanegyric. His stirring encomium is ingeniously continued by Mr. William\nT. Harrington, who adds many merited words of praise for our kindred\nacross the seas. The present critic's lines are as full of heartfelt\nlove of England as they are wanting in merit; while the lines of Olive\nG. Owen possess both deep fervour and conspicuous merit. Mrs. Griffith's\ntribute, \"He Conquers who Endures,\" breathes out the true spirit of the\nAmerican nation today, anticipating the official action of a cautious\nand slow-moving government. The \"Open Letters\" of Messrs. Macauley,\nStokes and Martin, speak the brave spirit of the age, and make us the\nmore sharply regretful of our own rejection for military service.\n\"Treasure,\" by Miss von der Heide, is an appealing bit of sentiment,\nwhose interest is timely indeed.\n\nViewed as a whole, =The Inspiration= takes first rank amongst the\namateur papers published since March.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Little Budget= for May opens with Paul J. Campbell's meritorious\npoem entitled \"Signals.\" Mr. Campbell, always facile in metre, exhibits\nincreasing power in the realm of poetical imagination, and is entitled\nto a substantial place on the slopes of Parnassus. A misprint in the\npresent version of \"Signals\" gives =look= when =looked= should appear.\n\n\"The Adventures of 'Dido' Plum,\" by Joseph Parks, is a pleasing story of\nmilitary life by one who is himself a soldier. Mr. Parks' brief sketches\nform a pleasing feature of the contemporary amateur press, being\ndistinguished by a naturalness which intensifies their interest as\nliteral transcripts of the army atmosphere. \"Road Song,\" a tuneful lyric\nby Eleanor J. Barnhart, marks the first appearance of that brilliant\nauthor as a poet. Her inexperience in this art, however, is not at all\nto be suspected from this fervent and finished composition; which might\nwell do credit to some of our veteran bards. \"Impulse,\" by Norah Sloane\nStanley, is described as \"A Parisian Fragment,\" and exhibits much\ningenuity in spirit and atmosphere. \"Keep a Cheerful Countenance,\" by\nEugene B. Kuntz, is a poem of great merit despite the doubtful rhyme of\n=way= and =quality= in the last stanza. Miss Mappin, in her article on\nMilton, displays her ample knowledge of literary history, and even more\nthan her customary fluency. \"The Contented Robin,\" a poem by Margaret\nMahon, is apt, pleasing and harmonious; whilst Miss Trafford's brief\njingle is quaint and clever. \"Spring,\" by Randolph Trafford (aetat 10)\nis full of the exuberant vigour of youth, and speaks well for the future\nof this bright young bard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Little Budget= for June gains distinction from Henry Clapham\nMcGavack's brilliant essay on American Anglophobia, entitled \"Blood is\nnot Thicker Than Water.\" This acute analysis of anti-British sentiment\namong certain classes in the States reveals a lamentable result of\nbigotry and historical ignorance; which may, we hope, be cured by the\nnew bonds of alliance betwixt the Old and the New Englands. As Mr.\nMcGavack well demonstrates, most of our Anglophobia is manufactured by\nthe alleged \"historians\" who poison the minds of the young through\nmendacious textbooks. This species of false teaching, an evil potently\nfostered by the Fenians and Sinn Feiners who lurk serpent-like in our\nmidst, is one which cannot too soon be eradicated; for the cultural\nidentity and moral unity of the States and the Empire make such sources\nof unintelligent prejudice increasingly nauseous and detrimental. We may\nadd that the textbook treatment of our War between the States is almost\nequally unfair, the Northern cause being ridiculously exalted above the\nbrave and incredibly high-minded attitude of the Confederacy.\n\nAnother delightful prose contribution is \"Back to Blighty,\" by Joseph\nParks, a vivid vignette of one phase of military life. \"Trinidad and its\nForests,\" by F. E. M. Hercules, is marked by its author's customary ease\nof expression and felicity of diction; presenting many facts of general\ninterest. The poetry in this issue includes work from the pens of J. E.\nHoag, H. P. Lovecraft, Rev. Eugene B. Kuntz, Beryl Mappin, and the\nEditor. Dr. Kuntz's lines to the memory of Phillips Gamwell are animated\nwith a nobility which well befits their subject, though the rhyme of\n=day= and =melody= is not strictly correct. Few amateur poets are able\nto achieve the sonorous dignity which Dr. Kuntz imparts to his flowing\nAlexandrines, or to select with equal appropriateness the vivid and\nmusical words that so irresistibly delight the ear and impress the\nimagination. Miss Mappin's metrical effort, entitled \"Only a Thought,\"\nbetrays some of the crudities of youth; including the attempted rhyme of\n=alone= and =home=. The metre, phraseology, and plan of rhyming demand\nextensive revision, the following being a possible amended version of\nthe piece:\n\n    As sad and alone in a distant land\n      I sat by the dismal shore,\n    My chin laid pensively in my hand,\n      And my dreams all of home once more;\n    I watch'd and mus'd o'er the sunless sea,\n      And study'd the cruel foam;\n    For the waves bore an exile's woe to me,\n      From my kindred forc'd to roam.\n\n    But lo! floating light upon the wind\n      And murm'ing o'er ocean crest,\n    Come the thoughts of those I left behind,\n      Bringing comfort and love and rest.\n    Only a word--aye, only a thought!\n      Each speeds like a heav'n-sent dart;\n    Who can measure the gladness and aid they've brought--\n      These thoughts--to the breaking heart?\n\nThe first line of the original, \"=Far away= in a =distant= land,\" is\nlamentably pleonastic; whilst the identity or intended identity of the\nsecond and fourth rhymes is undesirable. In a verse of this type, it is\nnot well to repeat a rhyme immediately. In the second stanza the first\nand third lines and the fifth and seventh are unrhymed, a variation from\nthe original design which is not sanctioned by custom. Once a poet\ndecides on his metre and plan of rhyme, he should maintain them\nunchanged throughout the poem. In the foregoing revised version, all\nthese defects have been remedied. Miss Trafford's poem, \"After a Dream,\"\nshows much promise both technically and in the thought. The final line\nof the first stanza, \"And the joy it contains is much,\" is very weak;\nand should be changed to read: \"And of joy it contains so much.\" In\nwriting the definite article, Miss Trafford mistakenly uses the\ncontracted form =th'= when full syllabic value is to be given. This\ncontraction is employed only when the article is metrically placed as a\nproclitic before another word, and is thereby shorn of its separate\npronunciation as follows:\n\n    =Th' ambitious= bard a nobler theme essays.\n\nThe illustrated bit of humor by George William Stokes deserves mention\nas presenting one of the cleverest drawings to appear lately in the\namateur press. It is difficult to decide in which domain Mr. Stokes\nshines the more brightly, literature or pictorial art. His heading for\n=The Little Budget= is a masterpiece of its kind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Pippin= for May brings once more to our notice amateurdom's\nforemost high-school club, the Appleton aggregation, whose existence is\ndue to Mr. Maurice W. Moe's untiring efforts. \"Doings of the Pippins,\"\nby Joseph Harriman, is a terse and informing chronicle of recent\nactivity. \"Once Upon a Time,\" by Florence A. Miller, is a bit of\nhumorous verse whose metre might be improved by the use of greater care.\n\"Some Cloth!,\" by John Ingold, is an exceedingly clever piece of wit;\nwhich, though avowedly Irish, bears the characteristic hall-mark of\nnative American humor. The delightful exaggerations recall some of the\nbrightest spots in American light literature. \"Speed,\" by Matilda\nHarriman, is an interesting sketch recalling Poe's \"Mellonta Tauta,\" in\nits imaginative flights. \"From Over the Threshold,\" by Ruth Ryan, shows\nmuch promise in the realm of fiction. \"Once an Amateur, Always an\nAmateur\" is one of those rare bits of prose with which our distinguished\nCritical member, Mr. Moe, favours us. We are proud of the unshaken\namateur allegiance of so brilliant a personality, and trust that some\nday he may realise his dream of \"an attic or basement printshop.\" \"The\nPress Club,\" by Ruth Schumaker, is a pleasing sketch, as is also Miss\nKelly's \"Our Club and the United.\" We trust that the Appleton Club may\nsafely weather the hard times of which Miss Kelly complains.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE UNITED AMATEUR for May contains a captivating and graceful sketch by\nW. Edwin Gibson, entitled \"Beauty.\" Mr. Gibson is one of our younger\nmembers who bids fair to become prominent in the coming amateur\ngeneration. Of the month's poetry, we may mention with particular\ncommendation Miss von der Heide's \"Worship,\" though through some error,\npossibly typographical, the final line of the second stanza seems to\nlack two syllables. \"When Dreams Come True,\" by Kathleen Foster Smith,\nis likewise of more than common merit, though the word =hear= in the\nsecond line of the second stanza is probably a misprint for =heard=.\n\"Smile,\" by O. M. Blood, is ingenious though scarcely novel. Its chief\ndefects are inequalities in the lines, which care should be able to\ncorrect. The first line contains two superfluous syllables, while the\nfourth line contains one too many. The ninth line of the final section\ncontains two syllables too many, as do the tenth and eleventh lines as\nwell. The rhyme of =appear= and =disappear= is incorrect, since\nsyllables in rhyme should be merely similar--not the same. Mr. Blood\nrequires much practice in poetry, but undoubtedly possesses the germ of\nsuccess. \"To the U. A. P. A.,\" by Matthew Hilson, is acceptable in\nconstruction and delightful in sentiment, laying strata on the new\nAnglo-American unity--the one redeeming feature of the present\ninternational crisis. THE UNITED AMATEUR closes with a quotation from\nEuripides, which we will not attempt to review here, since the author\nhas been receiving critical attention from far abler men for many\ncenturies!\n\n                                                  H.

Moe, Chief of our Department of Private Criticism, is trying\na novel experiment this summer for the sake of his health. He has\nundertaken a labourer's work on one of the new buildings of Lawrence\nCollege, lifting planks, shovelling mud, and wheeling bags of cement\nlike a seasoned workingman. While painful at first, the regimen is\nproving actually beneficial, and Mr. Moe is proud of the physical\nprowess he is beginning to exhibit. One of our amateur poetasters\nrecently perpetrated the following four lines on the unusual occurrence\nof a learned instructor working manually upon a college building:\n\n                     To M. W. M.\n\n    Behold the labourer, who builds the walls\n    That soon shall shine as Learning's sacred halls;\n    A man so apt at ev'ry art and trade,\n    He well might govern what his hands have made!\n\n\n\n\n                          _THE\n                     UNITED AMATEUR_\n\n OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n VOLUME XVII    ATHOL, MASS., NOVEMBER, 1917    NUMBER 2\n\n\nA Reminiscence of Dr. Samuel Johnson\n\nHumphry Littlewit, Esq.\n\nThe Privilege of Reminiscence, however rambling or tiresome, is one\ngenerally allow'd to the very aged; indeed, 'tis frequently by means of\nsuch Recollections that the obscure occurrences of History, and the\nlesser Anecdotes of the Great, are transmitted to Posterity.\n\nTho' many of my readers have at times observ'd and remark'd a Sort of\nantique Flow in my Stile of Writing, it hath pleased me to pass amongst\nthe Members of this Generation as a young Man, giving out the Fiction\nthat I was born in 1890, in =America=. I am now, however, resolv'd to\nunburthen myself of a secret which I have hitherto kept thro' Dread of\nIncredulity; and to impart to the Publick a true knowledge of my long\nyears, in order to gratifie their taste for authentick Information of an\nAge with whose famous Personages I was on familiar Terms. Be it then\nknown that I was born on the family Estate in =Devonshire=, of the 10th\nday of August, 1690, (or in the new =Gregorian= Stile of Reckoning, the\n20th of August) being therefore now in my 228th year. Coming early to\n=London=, I saw as a Child many of the celebrated Men of King\n=William's= Reign, including the lamented Mr. =Dryden=, who sat much at\nthe Tables of =Will's= Coffee-House. With Mr. =Addison= and Dr. =Swift=\nI later became very well acquainted, and was an even more familiar\nFriend to Mr. =Pope=, whom I knew and respected till the Day of his\nDeath. But since it is of my more recent Associate, the late Dr.\n=Johnson=, that I am at this time desir'd to write; I will pass over my\nYouth for the present.\n\nI had first Knowledge of the Doctor in May of the year 1738, tho' I did\nnot at that Time meet him. Mr. =Pope= had just compleated his Epilogue\nto his Satires, (the Piece beginning: \"Not twice a Twelvemonth you\nappear in Print.\") and had arrang'd for its Publication. On the very Day\nit appear'd, there was also publish'd a Satire in Imitation of\n=Juvenal=, entituled \"=London=,\" by the then unknown =Johnson=; and this\nso struck the Town, that many Gentlemen of Taste declared, it was the\nWork of a greater Poet than Mr. =Pope=. Notwithstanding what some\nDetractors have said of Mr. =Pope's= petty Jealousy, he gave the Verses\nof his new Rival no small Praise; and having learnt thro' Mr.\n=Richardson= who the Poet was, told me, \"that Mr. =Johnson= wou'd soon\nbe =deterre=.\"\n\nI had no personal Acquaintances with the Doctor till 1763, when I was\npresented to him at the =Mitre= Tavern by Mr. =James Boswell=, a young\n=Scotchman= of excellent Family and great Learning, but small Wit, whose\nmetrical Effusions I had sometimes revis'd.\n\nDr. =Johnson=, as I beheld him, was a full, pursy Man, very ill drest,\nand of slovenly Aspect. I recall him to have worn a bushy Bob-Wig,\nuntyed and without Powder, and much too small for his Head. His Cloaths\nwere of rusty brown, much wrinkled, and with more than one Button\nmissing. His Face, too full to be handsom, was likewise marred by the\nEffects of some scrofulous Disorder; and his Head was continually\nrolling about in a sort of convulsive way. Of this Infirmity, indeed, I\nhad known before; having heard of it from Mr. =Pope=, who took the\nTrouble to make particular Inquiries.\n\nBeing nearly seventy-three, full nineteen Years older than Dr.\n=Johnson=, (I say Doctor, tho' his Degree came not till two Years\nafterward) I naturally expected him to have some Regard for my Age; and\nwas therefore not in that Fear of him, which others confess'd. On my\nasking him what he thought of my favourable Notice of his Dictionary in\n=The Londoner=, my periodical Paper, he said: \"Sir, I possess no\nRecollection of having perus'd your Paper, and have not a great Interest\nin the Opinions of the less thoughtful Part of Mankind.\" Being more than\na little piqued at the Incivility of one whose Celebrity made me\nsolicitous of his Approbation, I ventur'd to retaliate in kind, and told\nhim, I was surpris'd that a Man of Sense shou'd judge the Thoughtfulness\nof one whose Productions he admitted never having read. \"Why, Sir,\"\nreply'd =Johnson=, \"I do not require to become familiar with a Man's\nWritings in order to estimate the Superficiality of his Attainments,\nwhen he plainly shews it by his Eagerness to mention his own Productions\nin the first Question he puts to me.\" Having thus become Friends, we\nconvers'd on many Matters. When, to agree with him, I said I was\ndistrustful of the Authenticity of =Ossian's= Poems, Mr. =Johnson= said:\n\"That, Sir, does not do your Understanding particular Credit; for what\nall the Town is sensible of, is no great Discovery for a =Grub-Street=\nCritick to make. You might as well say, you have a strong Suspicion that\n=Milton= wrote 'Paradise Lost!'\"\n\nI thereafter saw =Johnson= very frequently, most often at Meetings of\nTHE LITERARY CLUB, which was founded the next Year by the Doctor,\ntogether with Mr. =Burke=, the parliamentary Orator, Mr. =Beauclerk=, a\nGentleman of Fashion, Mr. =Langton=, a pious Man and Captain of Militia,\nSir =J. Reynolds=, the widely known Painter, Dr. =Goldsmith=, the Prose\nand poetick Writer, Dr. =Nugent=, father-in-law to Mr. =Burke=, Sir\n=John Hawkins=, Mr. =Anthony Chamier=, and my self. We assembled\ngenerally at seven o'clock of an Evening, once a Week, at the\n=Turk's-Head=, in =Gerrard-Street=, =Soho=, till that Tavern was sold\nand made into a private Dwelling; after which Event we mov'd our\nGatherings successively to =Prince's= in =Sackville-Street=, =Le\nTellier's= in =Dover-Street=, and =Parsloe's= and the =Thatched House=\nin =St. James's-Street=. In these Meetings we preserv'd a remarkable\nDegree of Amity and Tranquillity, which contrasts very favourably with\nsome of the Dissensions and Disruptions I observe in the literary and\namateur Press Associations of today. This Tranquillity was the more\nremarkable, because we had amongst us Gentlemen of very opposed\nOpinions. Dr. =Johnson= and I, as well as many others, were high Tories;\nwhilst Mr. =Burke= was a Whig, and against the =American= War, many of\nhis Speeches on that Subject having been widely publish'd. The least\ncongenial Member was one of the Founders, Sir =John Hawkins=, who hath\nsince written many misrepresentations of our Society. Sir =John=, an\neccentrick Fellow, once declin'd to pay his part of the Reckoning for\nSupper, because 'twas his Custom at Home to eat no Supper. Later he\ninsulted Mr. =Burke= in so intolerable a Manner, that we all took Pains\nto shew our Disapproval; after which Incident he came no more to our\nMeetings. However, he never openly fell out with the Doctor, and was the\nExecutor of his Will; tho' Mr. =Boswell= and others have Reason to\nquestion the genuineness of his Attachment. Other and later Members of\nthe CLUB were Mr. =David Garrick=, the Actor and early Friend of Dr.\n=Johnson=, Messieurs =Tho.= and =Jos. Warton=, Dr. =Adam Smith=, Dr.\n=Percy=, Author of the \"Reliques,\" Mr. =Edw. Gibbon=, the Historian, Dr.\n=Burney=, the Musician, Mr. =Malone=, the Critick, and Mr. =Boswell=.\nMr. =Garrick= obtain'd Admittance only with Difficulty; for the Doctor,\nnotwithstanding his great Friendship, was for ever affecting to decry\nthe Stage and all Things connected with it. =Johnson=, indeed, had a\nmost singular Habit of speaking for =Davy= when others were against him,\nand of arguing against him, when others were for him. I have no Doubt\nbut that he sincerely lov'd Mr. =Garrick=, for he never alluded to him\nas he did to =Foote=, who was a very coarse Fellow despite his comick\nGenius. Mr. =Gibbon= was none too well lik'd, for he had an odious\nsneering Way which offended even those of us who most admir'd his\nhistorical Productions. Mr. =Goldsmith=, a little Man very vain of his\nDress and very deficient in Brilliancy of Conversation, was my\nparticular Favourite; since I was equally unable to shine in the\nDiscourse. He was vastly jealous of Dr. =Johnson=, tho' none the less\nliking and respecting him. I remember that once a Foreigner, a =German=,\nI think, was in our Company; and that whilst =Goldsmith= was speaking,\nhe observ'd the Doctor preparing to utter something. Unconsciously\nlooking upon =Goldsmith= as a meer Encumbrance when compar'd to the\ngreater Man, the Foreigner bluntly interrupted him and incurr'd his\nlasting Hostility by crying, \"Hush, Toctor =Shonson= iss going to\nspeak!\"\n\nIn this luminous Company I was tolerated more because of my Years than\nfor my Wit or Learning; being no Match at all for the rest. My\nFriendship for the celebrated Monsieur =Voltaire= was ever a Cause of\nAnnoyance to the Doctor; who was deeply orthodox, and who us'd to say of\nthe =French= Philosopher: \"Vir est acerrimi Ingenii et paucarum\nLiterarum.\"\n\nMr. =Boswell=, a little teazing Fellow whom I had known for some Time\npreviously, us'd to make Sport of my aukward Manners and old-fashion'd\nWig and Cloaths. Once coming in a little the worse for Wine (to which he\nwas addicted) he endeavour'd to lampoon me by means of an Impromptu in\nverse, writ on the Surface of the Table; but lacking the Aid he usually\nhad in his Composition, he made a bad grammatical Blunder. I told him,\nhe shou'd not try to pasquinade the Source of his Poesy. At another Time\n=Bozzy= (as we us'd to call him) complain'd of my Harshness toward new\nWriters in the Articles I prepar'd for The Monthly Review. He said, I\npush'd every Aspirant off the Slopes of Parnassus. \"Sir,\" I reply'd,\n\"you are mistaken. They who lose their Hold do so from their own Want of\nStrength; but desiring to conceal their Weakness, they attribute the\nabsence of Success to the first Critick that mentions them.\" I am glad\nto recall that Dr. =Johnson= upheld me in this Matter.\n\nDr. =Johnson= was second to no Man in the Pains he took to revise the\nbad Verses of others; indeed, 'tis said that in the book of poor blind\nold Mrs. =Williams=, there are scarce two lines which are not the\nDoctor's. At one Time =Johnson= recited to me some lines by a Servant to\nthe Duke of =Leeds=, which had so amus'd him, that he had got them by\nHeart. They are on the Duke's Wedding, and so much resemble in Quality\nthe Work of other and more recent poetick Dunces, that I cannot forbear\ncopying them:\n\n    \"When the Duke of =Leeds= shall marry'd be\n    To a fine young Lady of high Quality\n    How happy will that Gentlewoman be\n    In his Grace of =Leeds'= good Company.\"\n\nI ask'd the Doctor, if he had ever try'd making Sense of this Piece; and\nupon his saying he had not, I amus'd myself with the following Amendment\nof it:\n\n    When Gallant LEEDS auspiciously shall wed\n    The virtuous Fair, of antient Lineage bred,\n    How must the Maid rejoice with conscious Pride\n    To win so great an Husband to her Side!\n\nOn shewing this to Dr. =Johnson=, he said, \"Sir, you have straightened\nout the Feet, but you have put neither Wit nor Poetry into the Lines.\"\n\nIt wou'd afford me Gratification to tell more of my Experiences with Dr.\n=Johnson= and his circle of Wits; but I am an old Man, and easily\nfatigued. I seem to ramble along without much Logick or Continuity when\nI endeavour to recall the Past; and fear I light upon but few Incidents\nwhich others have not before discuss'd. Shou'd my present Recollections\nmeet with Favour, I might later set down some further Anecdotes of old\nTimes of which I am the only Survivor. I recall many Things of =Sam\nJohnson= and his Club, having kept up my Membership in the Latter long\nafter the Doctor's Death, at which I sincerely mourn'd. I remember how\n=John Burgoyne=, Esq., the General, whose Dramatick and Poetical Works\nwere printed after his Death, was blackballed by three Votes; probably\nbecause of his unfortunate Defeat in the =American= War, at =Saratoga=.\nPoor =John=! His Son fared better, I think, and was made a Baronet. But\nI am very tired. I am old, very old; it is Time for my Afternoon Nap.\n\n\nDEPARTMENT _of_ PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Dabbler=, for September, in the entire unexpectedness and splendor\nof its appearance, must be counted as one of the most effective of\nrecent rebukes to the pessimists. There have been several such rebukes,\nand those who had already prepared themselves for another barren year in\namateur journalism are beginning to realize that even history cannot be\nrelied upon to repeat itself indefinitely. =The Dabbler= is issued by\nH. L. Lindquist of Chicago, and contains 16 pages, exclusive of the\ncovers. The initial letters and a few incidental adornments are printed\nin green, and the title-page, with its harmonious arrangement of type\nand decoration, is a delight to the eye. The typography, throughout, is\nalmost flawless, and the contents, in general, are worthy of the care\nwith which they have been presented to the reader. Paul J. Campbell, in\nhis article, \"What Does Amateur Journalism Mean to You?\" once again\ndefines the peculiar benefits and pleasures to be derived from our\nhobby, and warns away all those who come to it because of an idle\ncuriosity, or a vain desire for self-glorification, or any motive other\nthan a true impulse toward mental development and literary culture. \"A\nCritical Review,\" by Frank C. Reighter, is devoted to the July\n=Brooklynite=, and subjects that publication to a well-nigh exhaustive\nanalysis and criticism. The article is both interesting and instructive\nand reveals Mr. Reighter as an acute and capable critic. The verses with\nwhich he concludes his remarks are particularly clever and melodious,\nand furnish an excellent example of light verse when it is written by\none possessing a natural aptitude for that form of expression. Jennie M.\nKendall, in her fragment, \"The One Thing Needful,\" makes a modern\nbusiness woman give her opinion of idle wives, which she does in\nforceful, although not always accurate, English. \"U. A. P. A. Convention\nEchoes,\" by Litta Voelchert; \"The Old-Timer's Comeback,\" by L. J. Cohen;\nand \"The Only Hope of A. J.,\" by W. E. Mellinger, consist of\nreminiscence, assurance and advice, from three well-known amateur\njournalists. The articles were obviously written somewhat hastily but\nare, nevertheless, very interesting and suggestive. H. L. Lindquist, in\n\"At It Again,\" tells how he severed his connection with amateur\njournalism six years ago--being occupied with several professional\nventures--only to find that the old passion would not die and finally\ncompelled him to return to his early love. Those who have seen the\nresult of Mr. Lindquist's acquiescence in his Fate will gain some idea\nof what his activity must have meant in other days.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Dabbler=, for October, follows hard upon its predecessor and, in\nall essentials, is of equal merit. \"Hiking in the Rocky Mountain\nNational Park,\" by Louis H. Kerber, Jr., is a well-written account of a\ntour through some of America's most wonderful scenery, and reflects\ngreat credit on Mr. Kerber's powers of observation. \"Day-Dreams,\" by\nFrank C. Reighter, is a didactic poem and so labors under an initial\nhandicap in attempting to hold the attention of the reader. The\ntechnique of the poet, however, is deserving of praise, and if a fault\nmust be pointed out, it is in the forced pronunciation of the word\n\"idea\" in the last line, which seems too cheap a device to appear in\npoetry, even when, as in the present case, it is used intentionally.\n\"Dominion Day in Winnipeg,\" by W. B. Stoddard, is an account of a\npatriotic celebration in Canada and was evidently witnessed by the\nwriter on his recent--and somewhat protracted--travels. \"Ecstasy,\" a\npoem, by Eleanor J. Barnhart, begins rather promisingly but we do not\nproceed very far before detecting various crudities of craftsmanship.\nLines like the following:\n\n    \"The changing fire splendor of sky opals, rare,\"\n\nand\n\n    \"Like sea gulls swift soaring in tireless sky flight,\"\n\nand, once again,\n\n    \"Till star gleams bright glittering high in mid-sky,\"\n\ncontain the germ of true poetry, but when we read them we are aware not\nonly of a harsh and difficult combination of consonants but also of an\nentire absence of metrical swing and grace. In fact, we get an\nimpression from the above lines that an excessive number of important\nwords have been crowded hap-hazard upon a metrical pattern which was not\nintended to hold so many, and it is not surprising that the fabric\nshould show signs of being subjected to a severe strain. But care and\npractise may yet awaken that poet's instinct within Miss Barnhart which\nwill enable her to detect and reject, instantly, all such blemishes in\nwhat should be the rounded beauty of her song.\n\nThomas Curtis Clark is indeed a poet of \"Ring and Swing,\" as an\neditorial note to his poems declares him to be. \"The Dawn of Liberty\"\nand \"America's Men\" must be read in their entirety to be appreciated,\nbut a quotation from the latter poem may not be amiss.\n\n    We are America's men,\n      Brave, dauntless and true;\n    We are America's men,\n      Ready to dare and do;\n    Ready to wield the sword with might,\n    Ready the tyrant's brow to smite--\n    And ready to sheath the sword--for Right!\n      We are America's Men.\n\nThe unsigned story entitled, \"The Man Out of Work,\" is very brief, but\napparently not the effort of a tyro. It would probably hold the\nattention even if it were much longer and we are almost inclined to\nregret its extreme abruptness. Nevertheless, it is complete as it stands\nand an artistic whole. \"Still At It,\" by Mr. Lindquist, gives us\ninteresting information regarding the editor and also some sound advice\nas to finding congenial employment. Mr. Lindquist seems to be a\nphilosopher whose practise will bear comparison with his theory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Olympian= for October, awakens much of the old-time thrill with\nwhich amateurs were wont to receive the once frequent issues of that\njustly known and esteemed publication. The present number is not so\nambitious in some respects as many of its predecessors, but it must be\nsaid that within a somewhat smaller scope it accomplishes quite as much\nas a more pretentious issue could hope to do. Nor is the latest\n=Olympian= at all in need of any apologies for shortcomings in the way\nof size, appearance, or general literary quality. Indeed, publications\nthat consist of 12 pages and cover are always certain of a hearty\nwelcome, while the present production of Mr. and Mrs. Cole has\nqualifications in addition to those just mentioned that recommend it\nwarmly to all readers. The poem, \"Motherhood,\" by Ethelwyn Dithridge is\na truly noble and inspired effort. Amateur journalism is fortunate to\nnumber a poet of Miss Dithridge's attainments in its ranks. In\n\"Retrospect and Prospect,\" Edward H. Cole sums up the three years of\namateur history which have just passed and comes to the conclusion that\n\"the best hope for amateur journalism in these days of stress and\nstrain ... is in the peaceful co-operation of the surviving associations\nin a campaign of expansion of a practicable nature.\" \"Here and Now,\" by\nHelene Hoffman Cole, consists of suggestions for the practical\nco-operation proposed by Mr. Cole, and should be a stimulus to increased\nactivity in some positive form among present-day amateurs. \"The\nReviewers' Club\" is quite as authoritative and sound in its criticisms\nas in the past and must always be considered one of the most delightful\nand instructive features of =The Olympian=.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe National Amateur Press Association could hardly inaugurate a year of\npromised activity more auspiciously than it has by the sterling issue of\nits president's =Sprite=. It is just about everything that one could ask\nfor in amateur journalism. The modest grey of the cover, the excellence\nof the paper stock, the flawlessness of the typography, the exquisite\ntaste with which the component parts are blended--all these strike the\neye at the first glance. When one comes to read the contents, he finds\neach contribution well worth the setting. For a leading article we have\nsomething that is well nigh unique in literature, either amateur or\nprofessional, an attempted reconstruction of a scene supposedly excised\nfrom \"King Lear.\" This is so unusual, in fact, that it might well be\ncalled a \"stunt,\" but certainly it is a successful stunt. In the not\noverly long scene presented, which pictures the ruthless hanging of\nCordelia and the Fool before the eyes of the aged Lear, we can discern\nno quality that is not strictly Shakespearian. The language has been\npurged of every trace of modernism and flows with that semi-solemn,\narchaic, Elizabethan cadence that almost makes it hard to believe that\nit was written in this century. But all this might be done without\nachieving the supreme Shakespearian touch. The triumph of the scene is\nthat the character delineation is carried on with such a mastery of its\nintricacies that this scene might be interpolated in a new edition of\nthe play and fool the higher critics of the future. The author, Samuel\nLoveman, is an amateur of former days who celebrates his return to the\nhobby with this feat so characteristic of his peculiar genius. The\nUnited has its Lovecraft, a belated Georgian who says he is nowhere so\nmuch at home today as he would be in the coffee-houses of Pope or\nJohnson. The National once more after a lapse of years has its Loveman,\na belated Elizabethan who could have walked into the Mermaid Tavern and\nproved a congenial soul to Kit Marlowe and friend Will. The United\nwelcomes him back.\n\nHarry Martin, the editor, follows with an essay on the elements of the\nclassic Greek tragedy to be found in \"King Lear,\" which in depth, tone,\nand general literary quality are strongly reminiscent of the best work\nthat appears in the =Atlantic Monthly=. As an essay it is perfect in\nform, its thesis is stated clearly and developed with forceful logic,\nand the wealth of material brought to bear upon the subject displays a\nknowledge of Shakespeare and the classic drama worthy of Truman Spencer,\nof beloved amateur memory.\n\nThe editorial section is only to be criticized in that Mr. Martin has\ncut us off with so few of his readable \"Views Martinique,\" but we shall\nlive in hopes of another excellent =Sprite= with a longer editorial\ndepartment. George Cribbs' \"History\" is just a little poem used for a\nfiller, but this must not be taken in derogation, for it is filler\nchosen with the good taste that characterizes the choice of all the\nother contributions. In spite of its simplicity and its brevity, it\nplays with the deft touch of mastery on that chord of pathos that always\nvibrates to the thought of Time's ceaseless and inevitable surge. From\nevery point of view the whole journal is a symphony of excellence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Yerma=, for October, is edited by John H. D. Smith of Orondo,\nWashington, and, aside from the fact that it is an attractive and\nwell-printed publication, may be considered as being rather in the\nnature of a promise of future achievement. The dedicatory verses \"To the\nYerma,\" by Alice M. Hamlet are fairly good so far as rhyme and metre are\nconcerned. They run smoothly and are really graceful in sentiment. They\ncontain one or two grammatical inversions, however, such as\n\n    \"I would a little jingle write,\"\n\nand\n\n    \"I'd love to be a poet great,\"\n\nwhich have no more right to appear in verse than in prose. Then, too,\nthey betray an occasional inelegance of expression like the following:\n\n    \"I find that I am stuck.\"\n\nBut Miss Hamlet should by all means persist in her versifying, since\nthere can be no doubt that she owns an instinctive grasp of the basic\nlaws of rhyme and rhythm. If she will read and study the lighter efforts\nto be found in any standard anthology of poetry and then, with such\nmodels ever before her, strive sincerely to overcome her present defects\nby unremitting practise, Miss Hamlet may yet become a truly clever and\naccomplished versifier. \"The Reform Spirit--Its Mission,\" by P. A.\nSpain, M. D., is an exceedingly able and thought provoking essay. It is\nto be hoped that in future issues Mr. Smith will give us an inkling of\nhis own ideas on various subjects. The chief defect in =The Yerma= is\nthe entire absence of editorial comment.\n\n\nREPORTS OF OFFICERS\n\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\n\nFellow-Amateurs:--\n\nThe fourth month of the United's official year opens with the\norganization still nearer completion; Mrs. Helene Hoffman Cole, former\nPresident and thoroughly active and capable amateur, having accepted\nappointment as Supervisor of Amendments. The Fourth Vice-Presidency has\nbeen accepted by Alfred Galpin, Jr., 779 Kimball St., Appleton,\nWisconsin.\n\nThe Official Editor is to be commended for the excellence of the\nSeptember =United Amateur=, as is also the printer, Mr. W. Paul Cook.\nThe Association will be gratified to hear that Mr. Cook has accepted the\nposition of Official Publisher for the year; but the members must\nremember that only by their liberality in replenishing the Official\nOrgan Fund, can regular issuance be ensured.\n\nThe 1916-1917 Year-Book of the Association, having been completed by the\nCommittee, is now undergoing critical inspection and condensation by the\nexpert judgment of Messrs. Paul J. Campbell and Edward F. Daas. Here\nagain we appeal to the generosity of the members, especially the veteran\nmembers, to make possible the publication in full of this epitome of\namateur history. Unless the Year-Book Fund is materially swelled, the\nvolume cannot possibly be printed in its unabridged form of sixty-three\nclosely typed manuscript pages.\n\nThe amateur press is now showing signs of a gradual recovery from the\nlate period of minimum activity. Mr. Martin's remarkable production,\n=The Sprite=, Mr. Lindquist's two numbers of =The Dabbler=, Mr. and Mrs.\nCole's welcome =Olympian=, Mr. Cook's wonderfully ample =Vagrant=, and\nMr. John H. D. Smith's small but enterprising =Yerma=, all attest the\nreality of this awakening. Within the next few months many more papers\nare to be expected; including an excellent one from Miss Lehr, a\nscholarly =Piper= from Mr. Kleiner, a brilliant first venture, =The\nArcadian=, from Mrs. Jordan, and both a =Vagrant= and a =Monadnock= from\nMr. Cook. Mr. Cook makes a truly philanthropic offer to print small\npapers at reasonable rates, and it is to be hoped that a large number of\nmembers will avail themselves of it, communicating with Mr. Cook\nregarding particulars. His address is 451 Main St., Athol, Mass.\n\nRecruiting proceeds steadily if not with meteoric rapidity, some\nexcellent material having been obtained since the beginning of the\nyear's campaign. The most serious defect in our system is the lack of a\ngeneral welcome shown the new members, particularly as regards the\ndistribution of papers. One of our most important recruits of last July,\nnow a responsible officer, declares he has seen but a fraction of the\npapers issued since his entrance; a fact indicating a censurable but\neasily remediable condition. Let us impress it upon ourselves, that if\nwe would do our full share toward maintaining the Association and its\nliterary life, we must see that all our respective publications reach\n=every= member new or old. A considerable part of our yearly losses in\nmembership are undoubtedly due to the indifferent reception which so\nmany gifted newcomers receive.\n\nThe general signs of the times are bright and encouraging. A renascent\namateur press, a closer co-operation between members, an influx of\ninterested recruits, and an improved state of relations with our\ncontemporaries, are but a few of the good omens which promise to make\nthe coming year a pleasing and profitable one.\n\n                                           H. P. LOVECRAFT, President.\n October 28, 1917.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    JANUARY 1918\n\n\nREPORTS OF OFFICERS\n\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\n\nFellow-Amateurs:--\n\nThe dawn of the new year discovers the United in what may, considering\nthe general condition of the times, be called a very enviable position.\nWith a full complement of officers, and with the recruiting machinery\nfairly under way, our course seems clear and our voyage propitious.\n\nThe November Official Organ deserves praise of the highest sort; and\nwill remain as a lasting monument to the editorial ability of Miss\nMcGeoch and the mechanical good taste of Mr. Cook. It has set a standard\nbeneath which it should not fall, but to maintain which a well-supplied\nOfficial Organ Fund is absolutely necessary. If each member of the\nAssociation would send a dollar, or even less, to Custodian McGeoch,\nthis Fund might be certain of continuance at a level which would ensure\na large and regularly published UNITED AMATEUR.\n\nThe publication of lists of new and prospective members should arouse\nevery amateur to recruiting activity, and cause each newcomer to receive\na goodly number of letters, papers, and postcards. It would be well if\nthe line of demarcation between Recruiting Committees and the general\namateur public were not so sharply drawn; for whilst it is the duty of\nthe official recruiter to approach these new names, any other members\nconfer no less a favour on the United by doing so unofficially. We must\nremedy the condition which permits able writers to join and pass out of\nthe Association almost without a realization of the fact of their\nmembership. How few of these gifted amateurs who entered in 1915-1916\nare now with us!\n\nPublishing activity is strikingly exemplified by the appearance of\n=Spindrift=, a regularly issued monthly from the able pen of Sub-Lieut.\nErnest Lionel McKeag of the Royal Navy. When a busy naval officer in\nactive service can edit so excellent a magazine as this, no civilian\nshould complain that the present war has made amateur journalism an\nimpossibility! The number of papers expected in the near future has been\nincreased by a plan of the Second Vice-President to unite the members of\nthe Recruiting Committee in a co-operative editorial venture. It is to\nbe hoped that this enterprise may succeed as well as similar papers\nconducted during former administrations. Of great interest to the\nliterary element will be Mr. Cook's contemplated volume of laureate\npoetry, containing the winning pieces of all our competitions from the\nestablishment of Laureateships to the present time.\n\nThe Association extends its heartiest congratulations, individually and\ncollectively, to ex-Pres. Campbell and Treasurer Barnhart, who were most\nauspiciously joined in wedlock on Thanksgiving Day. Its heartfelt\nsympathy is transmitted to relatives of the late Rev. W. S. Harrison,\nwhose death on December 3d left a vacancy in the ranks of stately and\nspiritual poets which cannot be filled.\n\nA final word of commendation should be given to those more than generous\nteachers, professors, and scholars who are making \"The Reading Table\" so\npleasing and successful a feature of the United's literary life. The\nidea, originated by Miss McGeoch, has been ably developed by Messrs. Moe\nand Lowrey, and is likely to redeem many of the promises of real\nprogress which have pervaded the Association during the past few years.\n\n                                           H. P. LOVECRAFT, President.\n January 2, 1918.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MARCH 1918\n\n\nREPORTS OF OFFICERS\n\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\n\nFellow-Amateurs:--\n\nAs the second half of the official year progresses, we behold the United\nin excellent condition, though not marked by as great a degree of\nactivity as might be desired. The official organ faithfully maintains\nits phenomenally high standard, the January issue indeed eclipsing all\nprecedents; but a larger number of other papers must be published, if we\nare to make the present term as memorable quantitatively as it is\nqualitatively. An excellent example is set by Mrs. Jordan, whose newly\nestablished =Eurus= comes so opportunely. May this publication prove\npermanent, and of frequent appearance! Besides this, we are indebted to\nMiss Trafford, Lieut. McKeag, and Mr. Martin for a =Little Budget=,\n=Spindrift=, and =Sprite=, respectively. Several other papers are\nreported in press, including what promises to be a very remarkable\n=Vagrant=.\n\nIn order to increase the publishing activity of the Association, the\nadministration will endeavour to arrange for the publication of one or\nmore co-operative papers. Any United member able to contribute $1.50 or\nmore to such an enterprise should communicate with the undersigned, who\nwill attend to the details of issuance if a sufficient number of\ncontributing editors can be obtained. $1.50 will pay for one page, 7\u00d710,\nand each contributor is at liberty to take as many pages as he desires\nat that rate. Contributors may utilise their space according to their\nown wishes, and all will be equally credited with editorship. This plan,\nsuccessfully practiced four years ago, should enable many hitherto\nsilent members to appear in the editorial field to great advantage, in a\njournal whose contents and appearance will alike be creditable.\n\nThe comparative scarcity of entries makes imperative a second warning\nregarding the new conditions in the Laureateship department. Ten persons\nmust compete in any class before an award in that particular division\ncan be granted, and at present no class contains an adequate variety of\nentries. Again it is urged that the members lose no time in submitting\ntheir printed literary productions to Mr. Hoag for entry.\n\nA careful study of the four proposed constitutional amendments is\nnecessary to ensure intelligent voting next July. The undersigned, as\ntheir author, naturally favours their passage; but the one providing for\nan abolition of the officers' activity requirements should not be\nadopted without ample opportunity for debate and interchange of views.\n\nThe congratulations of the Association are extended to Mr. and Mrs.\nEdward H. Cole upon the advent of a son, Edward Sherman Cole, on\nFebruary 14. With equal sincerity the United felicitates Ex-President\nLeo Fritter, on his marriage to Miss Frances P. Hepner, March 6.\n\nThe United's 22nd annual convention will be held on July 22nd, 23d and\n24th, at the Dells of the Wisconsin River. Under the direction of Mr.\nDaas this event cannot fail to be of interest and pleasure to all\ndelegates, and every member who finds attendance possible is urged to be\npresent.\n\nTo commend the official board for its generous, harmonious, and\nindustrious co-operation this year, seems but a reiteration of needless\npanegyric; yet it would not be just to conclude this message without\nsome such expression of grateful appreciation. The enthusiastic and\nunswerving loyalty of all our leaders has been a constant shield against\nthe adversity of these gloomy times, and has been wonderfully successful\nin maintaining the United at a high cultural level.\n\n                                           H. P. LOVECRAFT, President.\n March 8, 1918.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MAY 1918\n\n\nSunset\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft\n\n    The cloudless day is richer at its close;\n      A golden glory settles on the lea;\n    Soft stealing shadows hint of cool repose\n      To mellowing landscape, and to calming sea.\n\n    And in that nobler, gentler, lovelier light,\n      The soul to sweeter, loftier bliss inclines;\n    Freed from the noonday glare, the favour'd sight\n      Increasing grace in earth and sky divines.\n\n    But ere the purest radiance crowns the green,\n      Or fairest lustre fills th' expectant grove,\n    The twilight thickens, and the fleeting scene\n      Leaves but a hallow'd memory of love!\n\n\nDEPARTMENT _of_ PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=Eurus= for February serves a double purpose; to introduce to the United\nin an editorial capacity the gifted poetess, Mrs. W. V. Jordan, and to\ncommemorate the 87th natal anniversary of amateurdom's best beloved\nbard, Jonathan E. Hoag. The dedication to Mr. Hoag is both worthy and\nwell merited. There are few whose qualities could evoke so sincere an\nencomium, and few encomiasts who could render so felicitous an\nexpression of esteem. The entire production sustains the best traditions\nof Mrs. Jordan's work, and forms the most creditable individual paper to\nappear in the United since the dawn of the new year.\n\nThe issue opens with Mr. Hoag's stately and beautiful poem, \"To the\nFalls of Dionondawa,\" which describes in an exquisite way the supposed\nhistory of a delightful cascade in Greenwich, New York. The lines, which\nare cast in the heroic couplet, have all the pleasing pomp and fire of\nthe Augustan age of English verse; and form a refreshing contrast to the\nharsh or languid measures characteristic of the present day. Mr. Hoag\nbrings down to our time the urbane arts of a better literary period.\n\n\"An Appreciation,\" by Verna McGeoch, is a prose-poetical tribute to Mr.\nHoag, whose literary merit is of such a quality that we must needs\nlament the infrequency with which the author contributes to the amateur\npress. Of this piece a reader of broad culture lately said: \"I have\nnever read a production of this kind, more finely phrased, more\ncomprehensive, more effective, and withal, so terse, and throughout, in\nsuch excellent taste.\" =Eurus= has good reason for self-congratulation\non carrying this remarkable bit of composition.\n\n\"Chores,\" by Winifred Virginia Jordan, displays this versatile writer in\na very singular vein; that of sombre, repellent, rustic tragedy. It has\nall the compelling power which marks Mrs. Jordan's darker productions,\nand is conveyed in an arresting, staccato measure which emphasizes the\nhomely horror of the theme. The phraseology, with its large proportion\nof rural and archaic words and constructions, adds vastly to the general\neffect and atmosphere. We believe that Mrs. Jordan analyses the\nNew-England rustic mind more keenly and accurately than any other\namateur writer; interpreting rural moods and sentiments, be they bright\nor dark, with unvarnished simplicity and absolute verisimilitude,\nnotwithstanding the fact that most of her verse is of a much more\npolished and classical character. In \"Chores\" we are brought vividly\nface to face with the bleakest aspect of rusticity; the dull,\ncommonplace couple, dwelling so far from the rest of mankind that they\nhave become almost primitive in thought and feelings, losing all the\ncomplex refinements and humanities of social existence. The poem\nintensifies that feeling of hidden terror and tragedy which sometimes\nstrikes us on beholding a lonely farmer, enigmatical of face and sparing\nof words, or on spying, through the twilight, some grey, unpainted,\nramshackle, cottage, perched upon a wind-swept hill or propped up\nagainst the jutting boulders of some deserted slope, miles from the town\nand remote from the nearest neighbour.\n\n\"Young Clare,\" by Edith Miniter, is a narrative poem of that power and\npolish which might be expected of its celebrated author. The only\nconsiderable objection which could possibly be brought against it is a\ntechnical one, applying to the fourth line of the opening stanza:\n\n    \"To work a cabaret show.\"\n\nHere we must needs wonder at the use of =work= as a transitive verb when\nthe intransitive sense is so clearly demanded, and at the evident\naccentuation of =cabaret=. We believe that the correct pronunciation of\n=cabaret= is trisyllabic, with the accent on the final syllable, thus:\n\"=cab-a-ray=.\" We will not be quite so dogmatic about =artiste= in line\n2 of the last stanza, though we think the best usage would demand the\naccent on the final syllable.\n\n\"Gentle Gusts,\" the quaintly named editorial section, contains much\nmatter of merit, clothed in a pleasantly smooth style. The classical\nname of the publication is here ingeniously explained, and its\ndedication formally made. The tribute to Mr. Hoag is as well rendered as\nit is merited. The editorial note on amateur criticism is sound and\nkindly; the author voicing her protests in a manner which disarms them\nof malice, and putting us in a receptive attitude. Personally, the\npresent critic is in complete agreement with the remarks on poetical\nelision and inversions; but we are confident that those of our board who\nhold different views, will accept the dicta in the friendly spirit\nintended.\n\n\"Someone--Somewhere,\" by Jennie E. T. Dowe, is a delightful lyric by an\nauthoress too well known in amateurdom to need an introduction. Mrs.\nDowe writes with the polish of long experience and genuine culture,\ndisplaying an enviable poetic genius.\n\n=Eurus= closes with some commendatory lines to Mr. Hoag from the pen of\nH. P. Lovecraft. They are in heroics, and redolent of the spirit of two\ncenturies ago. We discern no striking violations of good taste or metre,\nnor do we find any remarkable poetic power or elevation of thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Little Budget= for February and March is a double number, whose\nsize and quality are alike encouraging. The issue opens with an ornate\nand felicitous Nature-poem by Rev. Eugene B. Kuntz, entitled \"Above the\nClouds,\" in which the author for once breaks away from his favourite\nAlexandrines and heptameters, presenting us with an ideally beautiful\nspecimen of the heroic quatrain. Despite the strong reasons which impel\nDr. Kuntz to adhere to long measures, we believe he should compose more\nin pentameter. That his chosen metres have peculiar advantages, none\nwill deny; but it seems plain that the standard shorter line has other\nadvantages which amply outweigh them. It was not by chance that the line\nof five iambuses became the dominant metre of our language. In the\npresent poem we discern a grace and flow far greater than any which\ncould pervade an Alexandrine piece; a condition well shown by parallel\nperusal of this and one of the same author's more characteristic\nefforts. As a creator of graphic, lofty, and majestic images, Dr. Kuntz\nhas no peer in amateurdom. His sense of colour and of music weaves a\nrich and gorgeous element into the fabric of his work, and his sensitive\nliterary faculty gives birth to happy combinations of words and phrases\nwhich not only please the imagination with their aptness, but delight\nthe ear with their intrinsic euphony.\n\n\"The Drama as a Medium of Education,\" by Lieut. Ernest L. McKeag, is a\nshort but terse essay on a neglected factor in liberal culture. It is\ntrue that our ordinary curricula lay all too little stress on dramatic\nart; and that as a result, this branch of \u00e6sthetic expression is grossly\nand consistently undervalued. The low estimate of the dramatic\nprofession entertained by Dr. Johnson is a sad illustration of the\none-sided state of mind prevailing even amongst scholars, concerning an\nart which is certainly not inferior to painting and sculpture, and\nprobably much superior to music, in the \u00e6sthetic and intellectual scale.\n\n\"The Wizard of the North,\" an essay on Sir Walter Scott, is the current\ninstalment of Miss Mappin's Modern Literature Series. It is marred by a\nseeming hiatus, discernible not so much in the flow of words as in the\nflow of the narrative, which leads us to believe that a considerable\nportion has been left out, either through accident, or through an\nattempt at abridgment.\n\n\"My Books,\" by Alfred H. Pearce is a sonnet of apt idea and perfect\nconstruction.\n\n\"On Self-Sacrifice,\" by W. Townsend Ericson, is one of the \"Essays of a\nDreamer\" which are regularly appearing in the =Budget=. The effort is\nmarked by much sincerity and idealism, though in grammar and\npracticability it is less distinguished. We might mention the erroneous\nuse of =whom= for =who= (a not uncommon defect amongst amateur writers),\nthe faulty use of the word =usurping= where =depriving= is meant, and\nthe split infinitive \"to at least make;\" all three of which mistakes\noccur on page 138. Mr. Ericson should drill himself more thoroughly in\nthe principles of syntax. Other essays of this series are included in\nthe present issue. \"On Contentment\" gives an illustration which we fear\nwill injure Mr. Ericson's contention more than it will aid it. It is the\n=reductio ad absurdum= of the typical \"Pollyanna\" school of philosophy.\n\n\"Down an' Out,\" by Ernest L. McKeag, is a very clever ballad of the\n\"rough and ready\" school; picturesque in atmosphere, but somewhat\ndefective in technique. Lieut. McKeag should pay a trifle more attention\nto his rhymes; which are not, however, worse than many of the rhymes in\n\"Hudibras\" and other comic pieces.\n\n\"Why Roses are White,\" a children's story, by Margaret Mahon, is marked\nby much grace and ingenuity; the central idea being quite original so\nfar as we know. Further contributions to the children's department are\nmade by Miss Birkmyre, whose woodland sketches will be appreciated by\nolder readers as well.\n\n\"Selfish Ambition,\" a poem, by Nell Hilliard, is as correct and fluent\nin metre as we might expect from the author, though the expletive =does=\nin the final line of the first stanza is not to be commended. The\nsentiment is not precisely novel, but is well presented.\n\n\"The Flying Dutchman,\" a Romance of the Sea, by Joseph Parks, is more\nreplete with nautical verisimilitude than with literary force. As\ncompared with many of Mr. Parks' other tales, its plot is distinctly\nweak and lacking in symmetry. We must, however, praise the generally\nsalty atmosphere. The picture of seafaring life is vivid and realistic.\n\nThe current =Budget= concludes with a summary of the year just closed,\ndisplaying a record of achievement of which the editress may well be\nproud.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Silver Clarion= for March is the publication of John Milton\nSamples, of Macon, Ga., a new member of the United. In tone the paper is\nquite serious and strongly inclined toward the religious; but so able\nare the majority of the contributions, that it lacks nothing in\ninterest.\n\n\"Singing on the Way,\" a poem by James Larkin Pearson, opens the issue in\nattractive fashion. The lines are tuneful and felicitous, the triple\nrhymes giving an especially pleasing effect; though we must criticise\nthe line\n\n    \"Will certainly provide for us\"\n\nas being a trifle prosaic. We should recommend \"plenteously provide,\" or\nsomething of that nature, as more poetic. Mr. Pearson is a poet of\nability and experience, with a volume of published verse to his credit,\nwhose work never falls below a high standard of merit.\n\n\"Just Icicles,\" by Sarah Story Duffee, is a sort of fairy tale with a\njuvenile exterior; which contains, however, more than a slight hint of\nthe vanity of human wishes and fruitlessness of human endeavour. Whilst\nit exhibits no little cleverness in construction, we must own that it\npossesses certain looseness, insipidity, and almost rambling quality,\nwhich detract from its merit as a piece of literature. Mrs. Duffee would\nprofit from a closer study of classical models, and a slighter attention\nto the more ordinary folk tales.\n\n\"The Blessings of Thorns,\" by Sallie M. Adams, is a religious poem of\nconsiderable excellence, containing a pious and worthy sentiment well\nexpressed. The chief defects are technical. In the first stanza, line 3\nlacks a syllable, whilst line 4 has one too many. Also, the =day-way=\nrhyme is repeated too closely. To have but one rhyming sound through two\nrhymes is a fault hard to excuse. All the defects above enumerated might\nbe removed with ease, as the following revised version of the opening\nlines illustrates:\n\n    When we thank our Heav'nly Father\n      For the boons each day bestow'd;\n    For the flowers that are scatter'd\n      O'er the roughness of the road.\n\nIn the third stanza we find the =day-way= rhyme again repeated, also a\nsuperfluity of syllables in the sixth line. The latter might be cut down\nby the omission of the second =the=.\n\n\"Springtime in Dixieland,\" by John Milton Samples, is a tuneful pastoral\nwhich justifies the author's right to his first two names. But one or\ntwo defects mar the general delightful effect. The phrase \"zephyr\nbreeze,\" in the opening stanza, strikes us as a trifle pleonastic; since\na =zephyr= is itself a =breeze=; not a quality of a breeze. The syntax\nof the latter part of this stanza is somewhat obscure, but might be\ncleared up if the seventh line were thus amended:\n\n    \"And save when cloud-ships cross their track.\"\n\nThe sixth and seventh lines of the last stanza each have a syllable too\nmany, and in line 6 the word =raise= is used incorrectly; =rise= being\nthe word needed. This, of course, would necessitate a change of rhyme.\n\n\"One Face is Passing,\" by Mamie Knight Samples, is a timely and\nexcellent sketch concerning soldiers.\n\n\"Co-ee,\" a poem by Harry E. Rieseberg, contains much genuine pathos, and\nis generally smooth and commendable in technique.\n\n\"The Likeness of the Deity,\" by Arthur H. Goodenough, is one of the\ncharacteristically excellent products of its author, who holds the proud\nrank of \"Literatus\" in the United. The amount and quality of Mr.\nGoodenough's work is very unusual; few other amateurs producing so much\nverse of the first order. As a religious poet, he stands alone;\nresembling the celebrated Dr. Watts. He invests every theme he touches\nwith an atmosphere truly and richly poetic.\n\n\"Astral Nights,\" by John Milton Samples, is a genuinely poetic piece of\nprose arranged in lines resembling those of verse. We believe that the\nloftiness and excellence of this composition would justify its\nmetamorphosis into real verse.\n\nAlso by Editor Samples is the prose sketch entitled \"The Present War: A\nBlessing in Disguise.\" From the title, one would expect Mr. Samples'\npoint of view to be akin to that of the esteemed Gen. von Bernhardi; but\nsuch is not the case, since Mr. Samples means to say that he considers\nthe conflict a just Divine Punishment for a sinful world--a punishment\nwhich will bring about a sinless and exemplary future. We wish it were\nso.\n\n\"Lord, Keep My Spirit Sweet,\" by Mr. Samples, is a religious lyric of\nsubstantial charm and grace.\n\nThe Editorials in this issue consist mainly of critical notes on\nprevious numbers, and in general show a gratifying soundness of opinion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Spindrift= for January opens with \"Mater Dolorosa,\" a poem, by Vere M.\nMurphy, whose sentiment and technique are alike deserving of praise.\n\n\"The Spirit of January,\" a sketch by Jean Birkmyre, runs into the\nFebruary issue, and is quite acceptable from every point of view, though\nnot distinguished by that highly imaginative colouring which we find in\nmany of Miss Birkmyre's similar pieces.\n\n\"The Mystery of Murdor Grange\" this month falls into the hands of Editor\nMcKeag, who furnishes one of the best chapters we have so far perused;\npossibly the very best. It is exasperating to be cut off abruptly in the\nmidst of the exciting narrative, with the admonition to wait for page\n47!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Spindrift= for February has as its leading feature an essay on\n\"Heredity or Environment,\" by the Editor. In this brief article many\ntruths are stated, though we fear Lieut. McKeag slightly underestimates\nthe force of heredity. We might remind him of the Darwin family,\nbeginning with the poet and physician, Erasmus Darwin. The grandson of\nthis celebrated man was the immortal Charles Darwin, whilst the sons of\nCharles have all occupied places of eminence in the world of intellect.\n\n\"To the Enlisted men of the United States,\" by Edna Hyde, is an ode of\nadmirable spirit and faultless construction.\n\n\"A Fragment,\" by S. L. (whose identity is now known to us!) shows much\npoetical ability, though the metre would move much more smoothly if\njudiciously touched up here and there. The description of the crescent\nmoon sinking in the morning, is astronomically erroneous.\n\n\"The Estates of Authors,\" by Albert E. Bramwell, is a brief but\ninformative article. As the late Dr. Johnson said of the Ordinary of\nNewgate's account, \"it contains strong facts.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Spindrift= for March very appropriately commences with a poem on that\nblustering month, from the pen of Annie Pearce. Apparently the piece is\na juvenile effort, since despite a commendably poetic atmosphere there\nare some striking errors of construction. In the third line of the first\nstanza there is a very awkward use of the impersonal pronoun =one=. This\npronoun has no place in good poetry, and should always be avoided by\nmeans of some equivalent arrangement. In the second stanza it appears\nthat the authoress, through the exigencies of versification, has fallen\ninto the paradox of calling the \"fair green shoots\" \"roots!\" Perhaps we\nare mistaken, but our confusion is evidence of the lack of perspicuity\nin this passage. A rather more obvious error is the evidently transitive\nuse of the verb =abound= in the last line of this stanza. Be it known,\nthat =abound= is strictly an intransitive verb!\n\n\"The Soul of Newcastle,\" an historical article by John M'Quillen, begins\nin this number; and describes the Roman period. We regret the misprint\nwhereby the name =Aelii= becomes =Aelu=. The presence of a Hunnish\n=umlaut= over the =u= adds insult to injury! Mr. M'Quillen writes in an\nattractive style, and we shall look forward to the remainder of the\npresent article.\n\n\"Heart Thirst,\" by Vere M. Murphy, is a very meritorious lyric,\ncontaining an ingenious conceit worthy of a more classical age.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the literary contributions to the UNITED AMATEUR for January are\nmainly in the form of verse, I shall devote most of my attention to\nthem. Poetry, like the poor, we have always with us; but the critic is\nmoved to remark, as he casts back in his mind over the last twenty years\nof amateur publishing activity, that on the whole the tone of amateur\npoetry is distinctly higher than it used to be. Banal verse we still\nhave in larger amounts than we should; but the amateur journals of a\ndecade or two ago had reams of it. On the other hand, they contained not\na few poems with more than a passing spark of the divine fire. The\npromising fact is that in the poetry of today's journals we get much\nmore frequent glimpses of this true inspiration. In passing, the critic\ncannot forbear calling attention to Mr. Kleiner's \"Ruth\" in the February\n=Brooklynite=, which attains the highest levels of lyric expression,\nalthough only the simplest of figure and diction are employed. It is not\noften that one runs across a poem so simple and yet so pregnant with\nsincere emotion.\n\nThe first poem in the UNITED AMATEUR arouses mixed feelings. \"Give Aid,\"\nby Julia R. Johnson, presents a thought that cannot be too often or too\nstrongly stressed in this gloomy old world. Mrs. Johnson, furthermore,\nhas carved out her own poetic medium, alternating two tetrameter lines\nwith a single heptameter, a most unusual combination. It is always a\npromising sign to find a new poet experimenting with unhackneyed verse\nforms, although the experiments may not always be happy ones. But a word\nabout the thought of this poem. It is one of those \"recipe\" poems,\nso-called because it can be produced in almost unlimited quantities by\nany writer clever enough to follow the formula. Some day the critic is\ngoing to take enough time off to write a book of poetic recipes, and\nalready he has his subject so well blocked out that he is sure his book\nwill contain the fundamental ingredients of a great majority of the\namateur poems now appearing. The poem under consideration belongs to the\n\"glad\" recipe, an off-shoot of the Pollyanna school of fiction, and true\nto type it contains its quota of \"glad\" ingredients such as \"cheer,\"\n\"merry song,\" \"troubles,\" and \"sorrows,\" the last two, of course, for\nthe sake of contrast.\n\n\"Astrophobos,\" by Ward Phillips, is another recipe poem; although his\nrecipe is so much more intricate that it is not to be recommended for\nthe Freshman. The critic would denominate a poem composed according to\nthis recipe, a ulalumish poem, as it has so many earmarks of Poe. True\nto type, it is ulaluminated with gorgeous reds and crimsons, vistas of\nstupendous distances, coined phrases, unusual words, and general touches\nof either mysticism or purposeless obscurity. Such a poem is a feast for\nepicures who delight in intellectual caviar, but is not half so\nsatisfying to the average poetic taste as Mr. Kleiner's \"Ruth.\"\n\nTheodore Gottlieb's \"Contentment\" is a clever and readable working out\nin verse of Mr. Ruskin's theme in his \"King's Treasures\"; namely, the\nsatisfying companionship of great books. Mr. Gottlieb shows commendable\ncontrol of the felicitous phrase, while the literary allusions with\nwhich his lines bristle mark a catholicity of taste entirely beyond the\nordinary.\n\nMetrical versions of the Psalms are not at all new; they are used, in\nfact, in Scotch Presbyterian churches in place of regular hymns. The\npoetic paraphrase of the first Psalm by Wilson Tylor is well done, and\nonly in a few such phrases as \"winds that blow\" and \"perish and shall\nnot be blest,\" does he get dangerously near redundancy for the sake of\nrhyme and metre.\n\n\"A Thought,\" by Dorothy Downs, is a pretty little thought indeed, and\nprettily expressed, although the term \"holiness divine\" is strained when\napplied to a rose, and \"we will be surprised\" is frankly ungrammatical\nas a simple future in the first person. The =sine qua non= of all poetry\nis absolutely correct grammar and freedom from redundancy.\n\nThe bit of verse heading the War Items written by F. G. Morris, is quite\nadequate except for the lack of a rhyme in the last line, where the form\nof the stanza leads the reader to expect a rhyme for \"part.\"\n\nMatthew Hilson's rhymed greeting to the United from across the water,\nis on the whole, graceful and well done, and the United acknowledges its\nreceipt with thanks.\n\nOne other piece of work in this number deserves especial mention. Alfred\nGalpin's \"Mystery\" introduces to the association a thinker more gifted\nfor his years than probably any other recruit within recent years. This\njudgment is not based alone on the short article under consideration,\nbut even this little piece of thought, if carefully analysed, is enough\nto stamp him as one who thinks with extreme facility in the deepest of\nabstractions, and who for expression of that thought commands a\nvocabulary of remarkable range. Mr. Galpin is going far in this world,\nand we hope that he will sojourn long enough with us so that we can feel\nthat whatever glory he may attain will cast some of its rays upon the\nAssociation.\n\nThe editorial remarks in this issue of the UNITED AMATEUR are worthy of\nclose perusal on account of their graceful literary quality. Seldom has\nthe critic seen the subject of the New Year so felicitously treated as\nin this brief study by Miss McGeoch. The author's mastery of appropriate\nwords, phrases, and images, and her intuitive perception of the most\ndelicate elements of literary harmony, combine to make the reader wish\nshe were more frequently before the Association as a writer, as well as\nin an editorial capacity.\n\n\nREPORTS OF OFFICERS\n\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\n\nFellow-Amateurs:--\n\nAccording to indications, the last few weeks of the United's\nadministrative year will exceed their predecessors in general activity\nand work accomplished. The college recruiting campaign, delayed through\nan unavoidable combination of circumstances, is now taking definite\nform; and may be expected to show some actual results even before the\nclose of the present term, though its greatest fruits must necessarily\nbe reaped by the next administration. General recruiting is on the\nincrease, and a more satisfactory number of renewals and reinstatements\nis noted.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to be combated during this unsettled era,\nis the mistaken notion that amateur journalism is a non-essential and a\nluxury, unworthy of attention or support amidst the national stress. The\nprevalence of this opinion is difficult to account for, since its logic\nis so feeble. It is universally recognised that in times like these,\nsome form of relaxation is absolutely indispensable if the poise and\nsanity of the people are to be preserved. Amusements of a lighter sort\nare patronised with increased frequency, and have risen to the dignity\nof essentials in the maintenance of the national morale. If, then, the\nflimsiest of pleasures be accorded the respect and favour of the public,\nwhat may we not say for amateur journalism, whose function is not only\nto entertain and relieve the mind, but to uplift and instruct as well?\nMr. Edward H. Cole has ably treated this matter in his recent =Bema=,\nand no one who thoughtfully reviews the situation can dispute the force\nand verity of his conclusions. As Mr. Cole points out in a later\ncommunication, war-time amateur effort must of course be less elaborate\nthan in pre-war days; but amateurdom itself is now worthy of double\nencouragement, rather than discouragement, since by its soothing and\nsteadying influence it becomes a source of calm and strength, and\ntherefore an active factor in the winning of the war. Let us on this\nside of the Atlantic view the rejuvenescence of British amateurdom after\nfour years of warfare, as exhibited in the formation of the prosperous\nAmateur Press Club by Messrs. Winskill and Parks. The moral is not hard\nto deduce.\n\nOf the new publications of the season it is hard to speak without using\nsuperlatives, since Mr. Cook's epoch-making June =Vagrant= is among\ntheir number. This veritable book of 148 pages and cover constitutes the\ngreatest achievement of contemporary amateurdom, and may legitimately be\nconsidered as one of the outstanding features in the recent history of\nthe institution. It is the one product of our day which will bear actual\ncomparison with the publications of the departed \"Halcyon\" period. A\nJuly =Vagrant=, of equal quality though lesser size, may be expected in\nthe near future. A newcomer to our list of journals is =The Silver\nClarion=, issued by Mr. John Milton Samples of Macon, Ga., a promising\npoet, essayist, and editor, who has just entered the Association. =The\nClarion=, whose contents are distinguished for their wholesome tone and\npleasing literary quality, is a regularly issued monthly, and forms a\nsubstantial addition to the literature of the United. Another welcome\npaper is =The Roamer=, published by Mr. Louis H. Kerber, Jr., of\nChicago. This journal, devoted exclusively to travel articles, will\noccupy a unique place in the United. Among the papers to be expected\nbefore the close of the official year are a =Dabbler= from Mr. Lindquist\nand a =Yerma= from Mr. J. H. D. Smith, now a soldier in the service of\nhis country at Camp Laurel, Md.\n\nResponses to the proposal for a co-operative paper have been slow in\ncoming in. Let the members once more reflect upon the advantages of the\nplan, and unite in an effort to increase the literary output of the\nAssociation.\n\nThe annual convention, to be held on the 22nd, 23d and 24th of next July\nat the Dells of the Wisconsin River, may well be expected to stimulate\ninterest to an unusually high pitch. A large attendance is urged, and\nsince Mr. Daas is in charge of arrangements, the gathering will\nundoubtedly prove a bright spot in the year's programme.\n\n                                           H.

P. Lovecraft\n\n(Editor Laureate)\n\nTo those who look beneath the surface, the present universal war drives\nhome more than one anthropological truth in striking fashion; and of\nthese verities none is more profound than that relating to the essential\nimmutability of mankind and its instincts.\n\nFour years ago a large part of the civilised world laboured under\ncertain biological fallacies which may, in a sense, be held responsible\nfor the extent and duration of the present conflict. These fallacies,\nwhich were the foundation of pacifism and other pernicious forms of\nsocial and political radicalism, dealt with the capability of man to\nevolve mentally beyond his former state of subservience to primitive\ninstinct and pugnacity, and to conduct his affairs and international or\ninter-racial relations on a basis of reason and good-will. That belief\nin such capability is unscientific and childishly naive, is beside the\nquestion. The fact remains, that the most civilised part of the world,\nincluding our own Anglo-Saxondom, did entertain enough of these notions\nto relax military vigilance, lay stress on points of honour, place trust\nin treaties, and permit a powerful and unscrupulous nation to indulge\nunchecked and unsuspected in nearly fifty years of preparation for\nworld-wide robbery and slaughter. We are reaping the result of our\nsimplicity.\n\nThe past is over. Our former follies we can but regret, and expiate as\nbest we may by a crusade to the death against the Trans-Rhenane monster\nwhich we allowed to grow and flourish beneath our very eyes. But the\nfuture holds more of responsibility, and we must prepare to guard\nagainst any renascence of the benevolent delusions that four years of\nblood have barely been able to dispel. In a word, we must learn to\ndiscard forever the sentimental standpoint, and to view our species\nthrough the cold eyes of science alone. We must recognise the essential\nunderlying savagery in the animal called man, and return to older and\nsounder principles of national life and defence. We must realise that\nman's nature will remain the same so long as he remains man; that\ncivilisation is but a slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast\nsleeps lightly and ever ready to awake. To preserve civilisation, we\nmust deal scientifically with the brute element, using only genuine\nbiological principles. In considering ourselves, we think too much of\nethics and sociology--too little of plain natural history. We should\nperceive that man's period of historical existence, a period so short\nthat his physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest\ndegree, is insufficient to allow of any considerable mental change. The\ninstincts that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians of old, govern\nus as well; and as the ancients thought, grasped, struggled, and\ndeceived, so shall we moderns continue to think, grasp, struggle, and\ndeceive in our inmost hearts. Change is only superficial and apparent.\n\nMan's respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental\nconstitution and environment. Through certain modes of thought and\ntraining it can be elevated tremendously, yet there is always a limit.\nThe man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths the\nrestraints imposed by conventions and honour, but beyond a certain point\nprimitive will or desire cannot be curbed. Denied anything ardently\ndesired, the individual or state will argue and parley just so\nlong--then, if the impelling motive be sufficiently great, will cast\naside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition, plunging\nviciously after the object wished; all the more fantastically savage\nbecause of previous repression. =The sole ultimate factor in human\ndecisions is physical force.= This we must learn, however repugnant the\nidea may seem, if we are to protect ourselves and our institutions.\nReliance on anything else is fallacious and ruinous. Dangerous beyond\ndescription are the voices sometimes heard today, decrying the\ncontinuance of armament after the close of the present hostilities.\n\nThe specific application of the scientific truth regarding man's native\ninstincts will be found in the adoption of a post-bellum international\nprogramme. Obviously, we must take into account the primordial\nsubstructure and arrange for the upholding of culture by methods which\nwill stand the acid test of stress and conflicting ambitions. In\ndisillusioned diplomacy, ample armament, and universal military training\nalone will be found the solution of the world's difficulties. It will\nnot be a perfect solution, because humanity is not perfect. It will not\nabolish war, because war is the expression of a natural human tendency.\nBut it will at least produce an approximate stability of social and\npolitical conditions, and prevent the menace of the entire world by the\ngreed of any one of its constituent parts.\n\n\nREPORTS OF OFFICERS\n\nPRESIDENT'S MESSAGE\n\nFellow-Amateurs:--\n\nThe conclusion of an administrative year is naturally a time for\nretrospection rather than for announcement and planning, and seldom may\nwe derive more satisfaction from such a backward glance than at the\npresent period.\n\nThe United has just completed a twelvemonth which, though not notable\nfor numerousness of publications or expansion of the membership list,\nwill nevertheless be long remembered for the tone and quality of its\nliterature, and the uniformly smooth maintenance of its executive\nprogramme. The virtual extirpation of petty politics, and the\nelimination of all considerations save development of literary taste and\nencouragement of literary talent, have raised our Association to a new\nlevel of poise, harmony, dignity, and usefulness to the serious\naspirant.\n\nPrime honours must be awarded to our Official Editor and Official\nPublisher, who have given us an official organ unequalled and\nunapproached in the history of amateur journalism. The somewhat altered\nnature of contents, and radically elevated standard of editorship, mark\nan era in the progress of the Association; since the UNITED AMATEUR is\nreally the nucleus of our activity and a reflection of the best in our\ncurrent thought and ideals. We have this year helped to shatter the\nfoolish fetichism which restricts the average official organ to a\nboresome and needless display of facts and figures, relating to the\npolitical mechanism of amateurdom. The organ has been a literary one, as\nbefits a literary association; and has been conducted with a sounder\nsense of relative values than in times when amateurs seemed to place\nelections and annual banquets above art, taste, and rhetoric.\n\nThe publications of the year have been distinguished for their merit,\ngeneral polish, and scholarly editorship. The percentage of crude matter\nappearing in print has been reduced to a minimum through the careful and\nconscientious critical service rendered both by the official bureau and\nby private individuals. The artistic standard of the United has evolved\nto a point where no aims short of excellence can win unqualified\napproval. The classics have become our sole models, and whilst even the\nmost glaring faults of the sincere beginner receive liberal\nconsideration and sympathetically constructive attention, there is no\nlonger a seat of honour for complacent crudity. Genuine aspiration is\nour criterion of worth. The spirit of this newer amateur journalism is\nsplendidly shown by such magazines of the year as =Eurus=, =Spindrift=,\n=The Vagrant=, and the official organ.\n\nJust before the close of the present term, several new publications have\nappeared, amongst them a =Vagrant=, a =Conservative=, and Mr. Moloney's\nsplendid first venture, =The Voice From the Mountains=. Early in the\nnext fiscal year will appear =The United Co-Operative=, the fruit of\nthis year's planning, edited by Mrs. Jordan, Miss Lehr, Mr. J. Clinton\nPryor, and the undersigned. A revival of manuscript magazines,\ninaugurated by the appearance of Sub-Lieut. McKeag's =Northumbrian=, is\nin a measure solving the problems created by the high price of printing.\nNext month the undersigned will put into circulation =Hesperia=, a\ntypewritten magazine designed to foster a closer relationship between\nBritish and American amateurdom.\n\nJudges of Award for the Laureateship contests have been appointed as\nfollows: Poetry, Mr. Nixon Waterman, a New-England bard who needs no\nintroduction to the lover of lofty and graceful expression. Verse, Dr.\nHenry T. Schnittkind of the Stratford Publishing Co. Essay, Prof. Lewis\nP. Shanks of the University of Pennsylvania. Study, Mr. J. Lee Robinson,\nEditor of the =Cambridge Tribune=. Story, Mr. William R. Murphy of the\nPhiladelphia =Evening Ledger=, a former United man of the highest\nattainments. Editorial, Hon. Oliver Wayne Stewart, Associate Editor of\n=The National Enquirer=.\n\nIn doffing the official mantle after a year of executive endeavour, the\nundersigned must express regret at his inability to serve in as vigorous\na manner as would the ideal President. He is acutely conscious of his\nshortcomings in a position which demands constant care and exertion, and\nwhich imposes a strain that only the robust are perfectly qualified to\nbear. It would be impossible for him fully to express his gratitude to\nhis faithful and capable colleagues, to whose unremitting and\nfaultlessly co-ordinated efforts all the successes of the present year\nmust in justice be attributed.

P. Lovecraft\n\n    _The centre of our studies, the goal of our thoughts, the point to\n    which all paths lead and the point from which all paths start again,\n    is to be found in Rome and her abiding power._--Freeman.\n\nFew students of mankind, if truly impartial, can fail to select as the\ngreatest of human institutions that mighty and enduring civilisation\nwhich, first appearing on the banks of the Tiber, spread throughout the\nknown world and became the direct parent of our own. If to Greece is due\nthe existence of all modern thought, so to Rome is due its survival and\nour possession of it; for it was the majesty of the Eternal City which,\nreducing all Western Europe to a single government, made possible the\nwide and uniform diffusion of the high culture borrowed from Greece, and\nthereby laid the foundation of European enlightenment. To this day the\nremnants of the Roman world exhibit a superiority over those parts which\nnever came beneath the sway of the Imperial Mother; a superiority\nstrikingly manifest when we contemplate the savage code and ideals of\nthe Germans, aliens to the priceless heritage of Latin justice,\nhumanity, and philosophy. The study of Roman literature, then, needs no\nplea to recommend it. It is ours by intellectual descent; our bridge to\nall antiquity and to those Grecian stores of art and thought which are\nthe fountain head of existing culture.\n\nIn considering Rome and her artistic history, we are conscious of a\nsubjectivity impossible in the case of Greece or any other ancient\nnation. Whilst the Hellenes, with their strange beauty-worship and\ndefective moral ideals, are to be admired and pitied at once, as\nluminous but remote phantoms; the Romans, with their greater practical\nsense, ancient virtue, and love of law and order, seem like our own\npeople. It is with personal pride that we read of the valour and\nconquests of this mighty race, who used the alphabet we use, spoke and\nwrote with but little difference many of the words we speak and write,\nand with divine creative power evolved virtually all the forms of law\nwhich govern us today. To the Greek, art and literature were\ninextricably involved in daily life and thought; to the Roman, as to us,\nthey were a separate unit in a many-sided civilisation. Undoubtedly this\ncircumstance proves the inferiority of the Roman culture to the Greek;\nbut it is an inferiority shared by our own culture, and therefore a bond\nof sympathy.\n\nThe race whose genius gave rise to the glories of Rome is, unhappily,\nnot now in existence. Centuries of devastating wars, and foreign\nimmigration into Italy, left but few real Latins after the early\nImperial \u00e6ra. The original Romans were a blend of closely related\ndolichocephalic Mediterranean tribes, whose racial affinities with the\nGreeks could not have been very remote, plus a slight Etruscan element\nof doubtful classification. The latter stock is an object of much\nmystery to ethnologists, being at present described by most authorities\nas of the brachycephalic Alpine variety. Many Roman customs and habits\nof thought are traceable to this problematical people.\n\nIt is a singular circumstance, that classic Latin literature is, save in\nthe case of satire, almost wholly unrelated to the crude effusions of\nthe primitive Latins; being borrowed as to form and subject from the\nGreeks, at a comparatively late date in Rome's political history. That\nthis borrowing assisted greatly in Latin cultural advancement, none may\ndeny; but it is also true that the new Hellenised literature exerted a\nmalign influence on the nation's ancient austerity, introducing lax\nGrecian notions which contributed to moral and material decadence. The\ncounter-currents, however, were strong; and the virile Roman spirit\nshone nobly through the Athenian dress in almost every instance,\nimparting to the literature a distinctively national cast, and\ndisplaying the peculiar characteristics of the Italian mind. On the\nwhole, Roman life moulded Roman literature more than the literature\nmoulded the life.\n\nThe earliest writings of the Latins are, save for a fragment or two,\nlost to posterity; though a few of their qualities are known. They were\nfor the most part crude ballads in an odd \"Saturnian\" metre copied from\nthe Etruscans, primitive religious chants and dirges, rough medleys of\ncomic verse forming the prototype of satire, and awkward \"Fescennine\"\ndialogues or dramatic farces enacted by the lively peasantry. All\ndoubtless reflected the simple, happy and virtuous, if stern, life of\nthe home-loving agricultural race which was destined later to conquer\nthe world. In B. C. 364 the medleys or \"Satur\u00e6\" were enacted upon the\nRoman stage, the words supplemented by the pantomime and dancing of\nEtruscan performers who spoke no Latin. Another early form of dramatic\nart was the \"fabula Atellana,\" which was adapted from the neighbouring\ntribe of Oscans, and which possessed a simple plot and stock characters.\nWhile this early literature embodied Oscan and Etruscan as well as Latin\nelements, it was truly Roman; for the Roman was himself formed of just\nsuch a mixture. All Italy contributed to the Latin stream, but at no\ntime did any non-Roman dialect rise to the distinction of a real\nliterature. We have here no parallel for the \u00c6olic, Ionic, and Doric\nphases of Greek literature.\n\nClassical Latin literature dates from the beginning of Rome's free\nintercourse with Greece, a thing brought about by the conquest of the\nHellenic colonies in Southern Italy. When Tarentum fell to the Romans in\nB. C. 272, there was brought to Rome as a captive and slave a young man\nof great attainments, by name Andronicus. His master, M. Livius\nSalinator, was quick to perceive his genius, and soon gave him his\nliberty, investing him according to custom with his own nomen of Livius,\nso that the freedman was afterward known as Livius Andronicus. The\nerstwhile slave, having established a school, commenced his literary\ncareer by translating the Odyssey into Latin Saturnian verse for the use\nof his pupils. This feat was followed by the translation of a Greek\ndrama, which was enacted in B. C. 240, and formed the first genuinely\nclassic piece beheld by the Roman public. The success of Livius\nAndronicus was very considerable, and he wrote many more plays, in which\nhe himself acted, besides attempting lyric and religious poetry. His\nwork, of which but 41 lines remain in existence, was pronounced inferior\nby Cicero; yet must ever be accorded respect as the very commencement of\na great literature.\n\nLatin verse continued to depend largely on Greek models, but in prose\nthe Romans were more original, and the first celebrated prose writer was\nthat stern old Greek hater, M. Porcius Cato (234-149 B. C.), who\nprepared orations and wrote on history, agriculture, and other subjects.\nHis style was clear, though by no means perfect, and it is a source of\nregret that his historical work, the \"Origines,\" is lost. Other prose\nwriters, all orators, extending from Cato's time down to the polished\nperiod, are L\u00e6lius, Scipio, the Gracchi, Antonius, Crassus, and the\ncelebrated Q. Hortensius, early opponent of Cicero.\n\nSatire, that one absolutely native product of Italy, first found\nindependent expression in C. Lucilius (180-103 B. C.), though the great\nRoman inclination toward that form of expression had already found an\noutlet in satirical passages in other sorts of writing. There is perhaps\nno better weapon for the scourging of vice and folly than this potent\nliterary embodiment of wit and irony, and certainly no author ever\nwielded that weapon more nobly than Lucilius. His \u00e6ra was characterised\nby great degeneracy, due to Greek influences, and the manner in which he\nupheld failing Virtue won him the unmeasured regard of his\ncontemporaries and successors. Horace, Persius, and Juvenal all owe much\nto him, and it is melancholy to reflect that all his work, save a\nfragment or two, is lost to the world. Lucilius, sometimes called \"The\nFather of Satire,\" was a man of equestrian rank, and fought with Scipio\nat Numantia.\n\nWith the age of M. Tullius Cicero (106-43 B. C.)--the Golden Age--opens\nthe period of highest perfection in Roman literature. It is hardly\nnecessary to describe Cicero himself--his luminous talents have made him\nsynonymous with the height of Attic elegance in wit, forensic art, and\nprose composition. Born of equestrian rank, he was educated with care,\nand embarked on his career at the age of twenty-five. His orations\nagainst L. Sergius Catilina during his consulship broke up one of the\nmost dastardly plots in history, and gained for him the title of \"Father\nof His Country.\" Philosophy claimed much of his time, and his delightful\ntreatises \"De Amicitia\" and \"De Senectute\" will be read as long as\nfriendship endures on earth, or men grow old. Near the end of his life\nCicero, opposing the usurpations of M. Antonius, delivered his\nmasterpieces of oratory, the \"Philippics,\" modelled after the similar\norations of the Greek Demosthenes against Philip of Macedonia. His\nmurder, demanded by the vengeful Antonius in the proscription of the\nsecond triumvirate, was the direct result of these Philippics.\nContemporary with Cicero was M. Terentius Varro, styled \"most learned of\nthe Romans,\" though ungraceful in style. Of his works, embracing many\ndiverse subjects, only one agricultural treatise survives.\n\nIn this survey we need allot but little space to Caius Julius C\u00e6sar,\nprobably the greatest human being so far to appear on this globe. His\nCommentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are models of pure and\nperspicuous prose, and his other work, voluminous but now lost, was\ndoubtless of equal merit. At the present time, passages of C\u00e6sar's\nGallic War are of especial interest on account of their allusions to\nbattles against those perpetual enemies of civilisation, the Germans.\nHow familiar, for instance, do we find the following passage from Book\nSix, describing German notions of honour:\n\n\"Latrocinia nullam habent infamiam, qu\u00e6 extra fines cujusque civitatis\nfiunt, atque ea juventutis exercend\u00e6 ac desidi\u00e6 minuend\u00e6 causa fieri\npr\u00e6dicant!\"\n\nThe next generation of authors fall within what has been termed the\n\"Augustan Age,\" the period during which Octavianus, having become\nEmperor, encouraged letters to a degree hitherto unknown; not only\npersonally, but through his famous minister M\u00e6cenas (73-8 B. C.). The\nliterature of this period is immortal through the genius of Virgil,\nHorace, and Ovid, and has made the name \"Augustan\" an universal synonyme\nfor classic elegance and urbanity. Thus in our own literary history,\nQueen Anne's reign is known as the \"Augustan Age\" on account of the\nbrilliant wits and poets then at their zenith. M\u00e6cenas, whose name must\never typify the ideal of munificent literary patronage, was himself a\nscholar and poet, as was indeed Augustus. Both, however, are\novershadowed by the titanic geniuses who gathered around them.\n\nSucceeding the Golden Age, and extending down to the time of the\nAntonines, is the so-called \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature, in which\nare included several writers of the highest genius, despite a general\ndecadence and artificiality of style. In the reign of Tiberius we note\nthe annalists C. Velleius Paterculus and Valerius Maximus, the medical\nwriter, A. Cornelius Celsus, and the fabulist Ph\u00e6drus, the latter a\nfreedman from Thrace who imitated his more celebrated predecessor \u00c6sop.\n\nThe satirist, A. Persius Flaccus (34-62 A. D.), is the first eminent\npoet to appear after the death of Ovid. Born at Volaterr\u00e6 of an\nequestrian family, carefully reared by his gifted mother, and educated\nat Rome by the Stoic philosopher Cornutus, he became famous not only as\na moralist of the greatest power and urbanity, but as one whose life\naccorded perfectly with his precepts; a character of unblemished virtue\nand delicacy in an age of unprecedented evil. His work, which attacked\nonly the less repulsive follies of the day, contains passages of the\nhighest nobility. His early death terminated a career of infinite\npromise.\n\nIn the person of D. Junius Juvenalis (57-128 A. D.), commonly called\nJuvenal, we behold the foremost satirist in literary history. Born at\nAquinum of humble but comfortably situated parents, he came to Rome as a\nrhetorician; though upon discovering his natural bent, turned to\npoetical satire. With a fierceness and moral seriousness unprecedented\nin literature, Juvenal attacked the darkest vices of his age; writing as\na relentless enemy rather than as a man of the world like Horace, or as\na detached spectator like Persius. The oft repeated accusation that his\nminute descriptions of vice shew a morbid interest therein, may fairly\nbe refuted when one considers the almost unthinkable depths to which the\nrepublic had fallen. Only a tolerant or a secluded observer could avoid\nattacking openly and bitterly the evil conditions which obtruded\nthemselves on every hand; and Juvenal, a genuine Roman of the active and\nvirtuous old school, was neither tolerant nor secluded. Juvenal wrote\nsixteen satires in all, the most famous of which are the third and\ntenth, both imitated in modern times with great success by Dr. Johnson.\nContemporary with Juvenal was the Spaniard, M. Valerius Martialis\n(43-117 A. D.), commonly called Martial, master of the classic epigram.\nUnsurpassed in compact, scintillant wit, his works present a subjective\nand familiar picture of that society which Juvenal so bitterly attacked\nfrom without.\n\nWe come now upon one of the most distressing spectacles of human\nhistory. The mighty empire of Rome; its morals corrupted through Eastern\ninfluences, its spirit depressed through despotic government, and its\npeople reduced to mongrel degeneracy through unrestrained immigration\nand foreign admixture; suddenly ceases to be an abode of creative\nthought, and sinks into a mental lethargy which dries up the very\nfountains of art and literature. The Emperor Constantinus, desirous of\nembellishing his new capital with the most magnificent decorations, can\nfind no artist capable of fashioning them; and is obliged to strip\nancient Greece of her choicest sculptures to fulfil his needs. Plainly,\nthe days of Roman glory are over; and only a few and mainly mediocre\ngeniuses are to be expected in the years preceding the actual downfall\nof Latin civilisation.\n\nIt is interesting, in a melancholy way, to trace the course of Roman\npoetry down to its very close, when it is lost amidst the darkness of\nthe Middle Ages. Claudius Rutilius Namatianus, who flourished in the 5th\ncentury, was a Gaul, and wrote a very fair piece culled the\n\"Itinerarium,\" describing a voyage from Rome to his native province.\nThough inferior to his contemporary, Claudian, in genius, Rutilius\nexcels him in purity of diction and refinement of taste. At this period,\npure Latin was probably confined to the highest circles, the masses\nalready using that =eloquium vulgare= which later on formed the several\nmodern Romance Languages; hence Rutilius must have been in a sense a\nclassical antiquarian.\n\nThe end draws near. Compilers, grammarians, critics, commentators, and\nencyclop\u00e6dists; summarising the past and quibbling over technical\nminuti\u00e6; are the last survivors of a dying literature from whence\ninspiration has already fled. Macrobius, a critic and grammarian of\ncelebrity, flourished in the fourth or fifth century, and interests us\nas being one through knowledge of whose works Samuel Johnson first\nattracted notice at Oxford. Priscian, conceded to be one of the\nprincipal grammatical authorities of the Roman world, flourished about\nthe year 500. Isidorus Hispalensis, Bishop of Seville, grammarian,\nhistorian and theologian, was the most celebrated and influential\nliterary character of the crumbling Roman fabric, save the philosopher\nBoetius and the historian Cassiodorus, and was highly esteemed during\nthe Middle Ages, of which, indeed, he was as much a part, as he was a\npart of expiring classicism.\n\nNow falls the curtain. =Roma fuit.= At the time of Isidorus' death in\nA. D. 636, the beginnings of medi\u00e6valism were fully under way.\nAuthorship had disappeared in the broader sense; learning, such as it\nwas, had retired into the monasteries; whilst the populace of the\nerstwhile Empire, living side by side with the invading barbarians, no\nlonger spoke a language justly to be called classical Latin. With the\nrevival of letters we shall see more Latin writings, but they will not\nbe Roman; for their authors will have new and strange idioms for their\nmother-tongues, and will view life in a somewhat different manner. The\nlink of continuity will have been irreparably broken, and these revivers\nwill be Romans only in an artificial and antiquarian sense. He who calls\nhimself \"Pomponius L\u00e6tus\" will be found to have been baptised Pomponio\nLeto. Classical antiquity, with its simple magnificence, can never\nreturn.\n\nIn glancing back over the literature we have examined, we are impressed\nby its distinctiveness, despite its Greek form. It is truly\ncharacteristic of the Roman people, and expresses Rome's majestic mind\nin a multitude of ways. Law, order, justice, and supremacy; \"these\nthings, O Roman, shall to you be arts!\" All through the works of Latin\nauthors runs this love of fame, power, order, and permanence. Art is not\na prime phase of life or entirely an intrinsic pleasure, but a means of\npersonal or national glorification; the true Roman poet writes his own\nepitaph for posterity, and exults in the lasting celebrity his memory\nwill receive. Despite his debt to Hellas, he detests the foreign\ninfluence, and can find no term of satirical opprobrium more biting than\n\"Gr\u00e6culus.\" The sense of rigid virtue, so deficient in the Greek,\nblossoms forth nobly in the Roman; making moral satire the greatest of\nnative growths. Naturally, the Roman mind is most perfectly expressed in\nthose voluminous works of law, extending all the way down to the\nByzantine age of Justinianus, which have given the modern world its\nentire foundation of jurisprudence; but of these, lack of space forbids\nus to treat. They are not, strictly speaking, a part of literature\nproper.\n\nThe influence of the Latin classics upon modern literature has been\ntremendous. They are today, and will ever be, vital sources of\ninspiration and guidance. Our own most correct age, that of Queen Anne\nand the first three Georges, was saturated with their spirit; and there\nis scarce a writer of note who does not visibly reflect their immediate\ninfluence. Each classic English author has, after a fashion, his Latin\ncounterpart. Mr. Pope was a Horace; Dr. Johnson a Juvenal. The early\nElizabethan tragedy was a reincarnation of Seneca, as comedy was of\nPlautus. English literature teems with Latin quotations and allusions to\nsuch a degree that no reader can extract full benefit if he have not at\nleast a superficial knowledge of Roman letters.\n\nWherefore it is enjoined upon the reader not to neglect cultivation of\nthis rich field; a field which offers as much of pure interest and\nenjoyment of necessary cultural training and wholesome intellectual\ndiscipline.\n\n\nTo Alan Seeger:\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft\n\n(In =National Enquirer=)\n\n    SEEGER, whose soul, with animated lyre\n    Wak'd the dull dreamer to a manlier fire;\n    Whose martial voice, by martial deeds sustain'd,\n    Denounc'd the age when shameful peace remain'd;\n    Let thy brave spirit yet among us dwell,\n    And linger where thy form in valour fell:\n    Proudly before th' invader's fury mass'd,\n    Behold thy country's cohorts, rous'd at last!\n    It was not for thy mortal eye to see\n    Columbia arm'd for right and liberty;\n    Thine was the finer heart, that could not stay\n    To wait for laggards in the vital fray,\n    And ere the millions felt thy sacred heat,\n    Thou hadst thy gift to Freedom made complete.\n    But while thou sleepest in an honour'd grave\n    Beneath the Gallic sod thou bledst to save,\n    May thy soul's vision scan the ravag'd plain,\n    And tell thee that thou didst not fall in vain:\n    Here, as though pray'dst, a million men advance,\n    To prove Columbia one with flaming France,\n    And heeding now the long-forgotten debt,\n    Pay with their blood the gen'rous LAFAYETTE!\n    Thy ringing odes to prophecies are turn'd,\n    Whilst legions feel the blaze that in thee burn'd.\n    Not as a lonely stranger dost thou lie,\n    Thy form forsaken 'neath a foreign sky,\n    On Gallic tongues thy name forever lives,\n    First of the mighty host thy country gives:\n    All that thou dreamt'st in life shall come to be,\n    And proud Columbia find her voice in thee!\n\n(Alan Seeger fell in the Cause of Civilisation at Belloy-en-Santerre,\nJuly 4, 1916.)\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    JANUARY 1919\n\n\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\n\n1858-1919\n\n    Last of the giants, in whose soul shone clear\n          The sacred torch of greatness and of right,\n    A stricken world, that cannot boast thy peer,\n          Mourns o'er thy grave amidst the new-born night.\n\n    Sage, seer and statesman, wise in ev'ry art;\n          First to behold, and first to preach, the truth;\n    Soldier and patriot, in whose mighty heart\n          Throbb'd the high valour of eternal youth.\n\n    Foremost of citizens and best of chiefs,\n          Within thy mind no weak inaction lay;\n    Leal to thy standards, firm in thy beliefs;\n          As quick to do, as others are to say.\n\n    Freeman and gentleman, whose spirit glow'd\n          With kindness' and with goodness' warmest fire;\n    To prince and peasant thy broad friendship flow'd,\n          Each proud to take, and eager to admire.\n\n    Within thy book of life each spotless page\n          Lies open for a world's respecting view;\n    Thou stand'st the first and purest of our age,\n          To private, as to public virtue true.\n\n    In thee did such transcendent greatness gleam,\n          That none might grudge thee an Imperial place;\n    Yet such thy modesty, thou need'st must seem\n          The leader, not the monarch, of thy race.\n\n    Courage and pow'r, to wit and learning join'd,\n          With energy that sham'd the envious sun;\n    The ablest, bravest, noblest of mankind--\n          A Caesar and Aurelius mixt in one.\n\n    At thy stern gaze Dishonour bow'd its head;\n          Oppression slunk ingloriously away;\n    The virtuous follow'd where thy footsteps led,\n          And Freedom bless'd thy uncorrupted sway.\n\n    When from the East invading Vandals pour'd,\n          And selfish ignorance restrain'd our hand,\n    Thy voice was first to bid us draw the sword\n          To guard our liberties and save our land.\n\n    Envy deny'd thee what thy spirit sought,\n          And held thee from the battle-seething plain;\n    Yet thy proud blood in filial bodies fought,\n          And poppies blossom o'er thy QUENTIN slain.\n\n    'Twas thine to see the triumph of thy cause;\n          Thy grateful eyes beheld a world redeem'd;\n    Would that thy wisdom might have shap'd the laws\n          Of the new age, and led to heights undream'd!\n\n    Yet art thou gone?

P. LOVECRAFT.\n January 13, 1919.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MARCH 1919\n\n\nA Note on Howard P. Lovecraft's Verse\n\nRheinhart Kleiner\n\nComment occasioned by the verse of Mr. Howard P. Lovecraft, who is a\nmore or less frequent contributor to the amateur press, has not\nconsisted of unmixed praise.\n\nCertain critics have regarded his efforts as too obviously imitative of\na style that has long been discredited. Others have accepted his work\nwith admiration and have even gone so far as to imitate the couplets\nwhich he produces with such apparent ease.\n\nBetween these two opinions there is a critical neutral ground, the\nholders of which realise how large an element of conscious parody enters\ninto many of Mr. Lovecraft's longer and more serious productions, and\nwho are capable of appreciating the cleverness and literary charm of\nthese pastoral echoes without being dominated by them to the extent of\nindiscriminate praise and second-hand imitation.\n\nThose who would beguile Mr. Lovecraft from his chosen path are probably\nunaware of the attitude which he consistently maintains toward hostile\ncriticism. Mr. Lovecraft contends that it gives him pleasure to write as\nthe Augustans did, and that those who do not relish his excursions into\nclassic fields need not follow him. He tries to conciliate no one, and\nis content to be his own sole reader! What critic, with these facts\nbefore him, will think it worthwhile to break a lance with the poet?\n\nBut even Mr. Lovecraft is willing to be original, at times. He has\nwritten verse of a distinctly modern atmosphere, and where his imagery\nis not too obtrusively artificial--according to the modern idea--many of\nhis quatrains possess genuine poetic value.\n\nMany who cannot read his longer and more ambitious productions find Mr.\nLovecraft's light or humorous verse decidedly refreshing. As a satirist\nalong familiar lines, particularly those laid down by Butler, Swift and\nPope, he is most himself--paradoxical though it seems. In reading his\nsatires one cannot help but feel the zest with which the author has\ncomposed them. They are admirable for the way in which they reveal the\ndepth and intensity of Mr. Lovecraft's convictions, while the wit,\nirony, sarcasm and humour to be found in them serve as an indication of\nhis powers as a controversialist. The almost relentless ferocity of his\nsatires is constantly relieved by an attendant broad humour which has\nthe merit of causing the reader to chuckle more than once in the perusal\nof some attack levelled against the particular person or policy which\nmay have incurred Mr. Lovecraft's displeasure.\n\n\nOFFICIAL REPORTS\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC CRITICISM\n\n=The Coyote= for October-January is a \"Special War Number,\" dedicated to\nCpl. Raymond Wesley Harrington, the editor's valiant soldier brother,\nand having a general martial atmosphere throughout. Among the contents\nare two bits of verse by the gallant overseas warrior to whom the issue\nis inscribed, both of which speak well for the poetic sentiment of their\nheroic author.\n\n\"Lord Love You, Lad,\" a poem by Winifred V. Jordan, is the opening\ncontribution; and deserves highest commendation both for its spirit and\nfor its construction.\n\n\"The Paramount Issue,\" by William T. Harrington, is a somewhat ambitious\nattempt to trace the responsibility for the great war to alcoholic\nliquor and its degenerative effect on mankind. The author even goes so\nfar as to say that \"had man been represented in his true and noble form,\nthen war would have been impossible.\" Now although the present critic is\nand always has been an ardent prohibitionist, he must protest at this\nextravagant theory. Vast and far-reaching as are the known evil effects\nof drink, it is surely transcending fact to accuse it of causing\nmankind's natural greed, pride, and combative instincts, which lie at\nthe base of all warfare. It may, however, be justly suggested that much\nof the peculiar bestiality of the Huns is derived from their swinish\naddiction to beer. Technically, Mr. Harrington's essay is marked by few\ncrudities, and displays an encouraging fluency. Other pieces by Mr.\nHarrington are \"A Bit of My Diary,\" wherein the author relates his\nregrettably brief military experience at Camp Dodge, and \"Victory,\" a\nstirring editorial.\n\n\"Black Sheep,\" by Edna Hyde, is an excellent specimen of blank verse by\nour gifted laureate. Line 14 seems to lack a syllable, but this\ndeficiency is probably the result of a typographical error.\n\nA word of praise is due the general appearance of the magazine. The\ncover presents a refreshing bit of home-made pictorial art, whilst the\nphotograph of Corporal Harrington makes a most attractive frontispiece.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Pathfinder= for January is easily the best issue yet put forth by\nits enterprising young editor. \"Hope,\" which adorns the cover, is a poem\nof much merit by Annie Pearce. The apparent lack of a syllable in line 2\nof the third stanza is probably due to a printer's error whereby the\nword =us= is omitted immediately after the word =for=.\n\n\"How and Why Roses Are White,\" by Margaret Mahon, is a fairy legend of\nmuch charm and decided originality, which argues eloquently for its\nauthor's imaginative scope and literary ability.\n\n\"Happiness in a Glove\" is a very facile and pleasing rendering of a bit\nof Spanish dialogue. Through a mistake, the authorship is credited to\nthe translator, Miss Ella M. Miller, though her own manuscript fully\nproclaimed the text as a translation.\n\n\"Welcome, 1919,\" is a brief contemplative essay by Editor Glause; in\nspirit admirable, but in phraseology showing some of the uncertainty of\nyouthful work. Mr. Glause might well pay more attention to compact\nprecision in his prose, using as few and as forceful words as possible\nto express his meaning. For instance, his opening words would gain\ngreatly in strength if contracted to the following: \"Now that a new year\nis beginning.\" Farther down the page we find the word =namely= in a\nplace which impels us to question its use. Its total omission would\nstrengthen the sentence which contains it. Another point we must mention\nis the excessive punctuation, especially the needless hyphenation of\n=amateurdom= and =therefore=, and the apostrophe in the possessive\npronoun =its=. The form =it's= is restricted to the colloquial\ncontraction of \"=it is=\"; the similarly spelled pronoun is written\nsolidly without an apostrophe. Additional notes by Mr. Glause are of\nequal merit, and his reply to a recent article on travel is highly\nsensible and commendable. He is a writer and thinker of much power, and\nneeds only technical training in order to develop into an essayist of\nthe first rank. As an editor he cannot be praised too highly for his\nfaithfulness in publishing his welcome and attractive quarterly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=Pine Cones= for February well maintains the high standard set by Mr.\nPryor in his opening number. \"Life, Death and Immortality,\" by Jonathan\nE. Hoag, is a brief but appealing piece from the pen of a gifted and\nvenerable bard, and thoroughly deserves its place of honour on the\ncover. On the next page occurs a metrical tribute to this sweet singer\non his 88th birthday, written by H. P. Lovecraft in the latter's typical\nheroic strain.\n\n\"The Helpful Twins,\" a clever child story by Editor Pryor, is the prose\ntreat of the issue. It would, indeed, be hard to find more than one or\ntwo equally interesting, human, and well-developed bits of fiction in\nany current amateur periodicals. Not only are the characters drawn with\ndelightful naturalness, but there is real humour present; and the plot\nmoves on to its climax without a single instance of awkwardness or a\nsingle intrusive or extraneous episode. In short, the story is almost a\nmodel of its kind; one which ought to prove a success in a professional\nas well as an amateur magazine. Mr. Pryor's humour is more broadly shown\nin the smile-producing pseudo-anecdotes of \"The Boy Washington.\"\n\nThe bit of unsigned verse, \"A New Year Wish,\" is excellent, though we\nquestion the advisability of having an Alexandrine for the final line.\n\n\"Comment Pryoristic\" is always interesting, and that in the current\n=Pine Cones= forms no exception to the rule. The appearance of this\nvigorously alive and intelligently edited publication is proving a great\nand gratifying factor in amateurdom's post-bellum renaissance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Recruiter= for January marks the advent to amateurdom of a new\npaper, which easily takes its place among the very best of recent\neditorial enterprises. Edited by Misses Mary Faye Durr and L. Evelyn\nSchump in the interest of the United recruits whom they are securing,\nits thoroughly meritorious quality speaks well for the new members thus\nadded to our circle.\n\nThe issue opens auspiciously with a lyric poem of distinguished\nexcellence by Helen McFarland, entitled \"A Casualty.\" In depth of\nsentiment, fervour of expression, and correctness of construction, these\nmelodious lines leave little to be desired; and seem to indicate that\nthe United has acquired one more poet of the first rank.\n\n\"Billy,\" a character sketch by L. Evelyn Schump, introduces to the\nAssociation a light essayist of unusual power and grace, whose work is\nvividly natural through keen insight, apt and fluent expression, and\nmastery of homely and familiar detail. The present sketch is\ncaptivatingly lifelike and thoroughly well-written, arousing a response\nfrom every lover of children.\n\n\"Winter,\" a brief poem by Hettie Murdock, celebrates in a pleasant way\nan unpleasant season. The lines are notable for correctness, spontaneity\nand vitality, though not in the least ambitious in scope.\n\nMartha Charlotte Macatee's \"Song of Nature\" reveals its 12-year-old\ncreator as a genuine \"Galpiness\" (if we may coin a word which only\namateurs and Appletonians will understand). Mistress Macatee has\nsucceeded in infusing more than a modicum of really poetic atmosphere\nand imagery into her short lyric, and may be relied upon to produce\nimportant work in the coming years of greater maturity. The chief defect\nof her present piece is the absence of rhyme, which should always occur\nin a short stanzaic poem. Rhyming is not at all difficult after a little\npractice, and we trust that the young writer will employ it in later\nverses.\n\n\"Tarrytown,\" by Florence Fitzgerald, is a reminiscent poem of phenomenal\nstrength, marred only by a pair of false rhymes in the opening stanza.\nAssonance must never be mistaken for true rhyme, and combinations like\n=boats-float= or =them-brim= should be avoided. The imagery of this\npiece is especially appealing, and testifies to its author's fertility\nof fancy.\n\n\"Shades of Adam,\" by Mary Faye Durr, is an interesting and humorously\nwritten account of the social side of our 1918 convention. Miss Durr is\nexceptionally gifted in the field of apt, quiet, and laconic wit, and in\nthis informal chronicle neglects no opportunity for dryly amusing\ncomment on persons and events.\n\n\"Spring,\" by L. Evelyn Schump, is a refreshingly original poem in blank\nverse, on a somewhat familiar subject. For inspiration and technique\nalike, the piece merits enthusiastic commendation; though we may\nvindicate our reputation as a fault-finding critic by asking why\nalternate lines are indented despite the non-existence of alternate\nrhymes.\n\n=The Recruiter's= editorial column is brief and businesslike,\nintroducing the magazine as a whole, and its contributors individually.\nAmateurdom is deeply indebted to the publishers of this delightful\nnewcomer, and it is to be hoped that they may continue their efforts;\nboth toward seeking recruits as high in quality as those here\nrepresented, and toward issuing their admirable journal as frequently as\nis feasible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Silver Clarion= for January comes well up to the usual standard,\ncontaining a number of pieces of considerable power. In \"The Temple of\nthe Holy Ghost,\" Mr. Arthur Goodenough achieves his accustomed success\nas a religious poet, presenting a variety of apt images, and clothing\nthem in facile metre. The only defect is a lack of uniformity in rhyming\nplan. The poet, in commencing a piece like this, should decide whether\nor not to rhyme the first and third lines of quatrains; and having\ndecided, should adhere to his decision. Instead, Mr. Goodenough omits\nthese optional rhymes in the first stanza and in the first half of the\nthird and fourth stanzas; elsewhere employing them. The result, while\nnot flagrantly inharmonious, nevertheless gives an impression of\nimperfection, and tends to alienate the fastidious critic. Mr.\nGoodenough possesses so great a degree of inspiration, and so wide an\narray of allusions and imagery; that he owes it to himself to complete\nthe excellence of his vivid work with an unexceptionable technique.\n\n\"The Cross,\" a sonnet by Captain Theodore Draper Gottlieb, is dedicated\nto the Red Cross, with which the author is serving so valiantly. In\nthought and form this piece deserves unqualified praise.\n\n\"Death,\" by Andrew Francis Lockhart, exhibits our versatile Western bard\nin sober mood. The poem contains that unmistakable stamp of genuine\nemotion which we have come to associate with Mr. Lockhart's work, and is\ntechnically faultless.\n\n\"Destiny,\" by W. F. Pelton, is a sonnet of smooth construction and\nthorough excellence by one whom we know better as \"Wilfrid Kemble.\"\n\nThe lines \"To My Pal, Fred\" present Mr. Harry E. Rieseberg, a new\nmember of the United who has for some time been a regular =Clarion=\ncontributor. In this piece Mr. Rieseberg falls somewhat below his usual\nstandard; for though the sentiment is appropriate, the metre is sadly\nirregular. Mr. Rieseberg should count the syllables in his lines, for he\nis a young poet of much promise, and should allow his technique to keep\npace with his genius.\n\n\"Faith,\" by Winifred V. Jordan, enunciates a familiar doctrine in\nmelodious and original metaphor, and well sustains the poetical\nreputation of its celebrated author.\n\n\"The Song Unsung,\" by W. F. Booker, is a war poem in minor key, which\ndeserves much praise.\n\n\"You're Like a Willow,\" by Eugene B. Kuntz, is marked by that warmth of\nfancy and wealth of imagery for which its author is noted.\n\n\"Thoughts,\" a courtly offering from the quill of James Laurence Crowley,\nwinds up the poetical part of the magazine; this month a very ample\npart. In rhyme and metre this sentimental gem is quite satisfactory.\n\nThe only prose in this issue is Mr. Samples' well-written editorial on\n\"The Passing Year.\" Herein we find some really excellent passages,\nsavouring somewhat of the oratorical in style.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n=The Silver Clarion= for February is of ample size and ample merit.\nOpening the issue is an excellent poem in heroic couplets by Mrs. Stella\nL. Tully of Mountmellick, Ireland, a new member of the United. Mrs.\nTully, whose best work is in a lyric and religious vein, is one endowed\nwith hereditary or family genius; as the Association no doubt\nappreciated when reading the poetry of her gifted sister, Mrs. S. Lilian\nMcMullen of Newton Centre, in the preceding issue of THE UNITED AMATEUR.\nThe present piece by Mrs. Tully, \"The Greatest of These is Love,\" is\nbased upon a Biblical text, and sets forth its ideas very effectively,\ndespite a few passages whose stiff construction betrays a slight\ninexperience in the traditions of heroic verse.\n\n\"The Two Crosses,\" by Capt. Theodore Gottlieb, is also in heroics, and\ngraphically compares the most holy symbols of today and of nineteen\nhundred years ago.\n\nMore of the religious atmosphere is furnished by John Milton Samples'\ntrochaic composition entitled \"The Millennium\"--from whose title, by the\nway, one of the necessary n's is missing. In this pleasing picture of\nan impossible age we note but three things requiring critical attention.\n(1) The term \"super-race\" in stanza 5, is too technically philosophical\nto be really poetic. (2) The rhyme of =victory= and =eternally= is not\nvery desirable, because both the rhyming syllables bear only a secondary\naccent. (3) There is something grotesque and unconsciously comic in the\nprophecy \"Then the lamb shall kiss the lion.\" Such grotesqueness is not\nto be found in the original words of Mr. Samples' predecessor and source\nof inspiration, the well-known prophet Isaiah. (Vide Isaiah, xi: 6-7.)\n\n\"Nature Worship,\" by Arthur Goodenough, is one of the most meritorious\npoems in the issue, despite some dubious grammar in the first stanza,\nand an internal rhyme in the final stanza which has no counterpart in\nthe lines preceding. The first named error consists of a disagreement in\nnumber betwixt subject and verb: \"faith and form and ... mazes which ...\nperplexes, dazes.\"\n\n\"The New Order,\" an essay by John Milton Samples, is an eloquent but\nfantastically idealistic bit of speculation concerning the wonderful\nfuture which dreamers picture as arising out of the recent war. To us,\nthere is a sort of pathos in these vain hopes and mirage-like visions of\nan Utopia which can never be; yet if they can cheer anyone, they are\ndoubtless not altogether futile. Indeed, after the successive menaces of\nthe Huns and the Bolsheviki, we can call almost any future Utopian, if\nit will but afford the comparative calm of pre-1914 days!\n\n\"No Night So Dark, No Day So Drear,\" by Mamie Knight Samples, is a poem\nwhich reveals merit despite many crudities. The outstanding fault is\ndefective metre--Mrs. Samples should carefully count her syllables, and\nrepeat her lines aloud, to make sure of perfect scansion. Since the\nintended metre appears to be iambic tetrameter, we shall here give a\nrevised rendering of the first stanza; showing how it can be made to\nconform to that measure:\n\n    \"No night so dark, no day so drear,\n    But we may sing our songs of cheer.\"\n    These words, borne from the world without,\n    Cheer'd a heart sick with grief and doubt.\n    O doubting soul, bow'd down so low,\n    If thou couldst feel, and only know\n    The darkness is in thee alone,\n    For grief and tears it would atone.\n    \"No night so dark, no day so drear,\n    But we may sing our songs of cheer.\"\n\nLet the authoress note that each line must have eight syllables--no\nmore, no less. For the trite ideas and hackneyed rhymes, nothing can be\nrecommended save a more observant and discriminating perusal of standard\npoets. It must be kept in mind that the verse found in current family\nmagazines and popular hymn-books is seldom, if ever, true poetry. The\nonly authors suitable as models, are those whose names are praised in\nhistories of English literature.\n\nW. F. Booker's \"Song\" is a delightful short lyric whose sentiment and\ntechnique deserve naught but praise.\n\n\"When I Am Gone,\" a poem in pentameter quatrains by James Laurence\nCrowley, contains the customary allotment of sweet sentiment, together\nwith some really commendable imagery. Mr. Crowley's genius will shine\nbrightly before long.\n\n\"The Path to Glory,\" by Andrew Francis Lockhart, is perhaps the poetic\ngem of the issue. In this virile anap\u00e6stic piece Mr. Lockhart sums up\nall the horrors of the trenches in such a way that the reader may guess\nat the extent of the sacrifice undergone by those who have given all for\ntheir country.\n\nIn \"Coconino Jim, Lumberjack,\" Mr. Harry E. Rieseberg shows himself a\ntrue and powerful poet of the rugged, virile school of Kipling, Service,\nKnibbs, and their analogues. The present piece is entirely correct in\nrhyme and well-developed in thought, wanting only good metre to make it\nperfect. This latter accomplishment Mr. Rieseberg should strive hard to\nattain, for his poetry surely deserves as good a form as he can give it.\n\nA word of praise should be given Mr. Samples' editorial, \"The\nProfessional in Amateur Journalism,\" in which he shows the fallacy of\nthe plea for a cruder, more juvenile amateurdom, which often emanates\nfrom members of the older and less progressive associations. As the\neditor contends, intellectual evolution must occur; and the whole recent\ncareer of the United demonstrates the value of a purely literary society\nfor genuine literary aspirants of every age and every stage of mental\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MAY 1919\n\n\nHelene Hoffman Cole--Litterateur\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft\n\nOf the various authors who have contributed to the fame of our\nAssociation, few can be compared in sustained ability and breadth of\ninterests to the late Helene Hoffman Cole. Represented in the press as a\npoet, critic, essayist, and fiction-writer, Mrs. Cole achieved\ndistinction in all of these departments; rising during recent years to\nan almost unique prominence in the field of book-reviewing. Her\ncompositions display a diversity of attainments and catholicity of taste\nhighly remarkable in one of so relatively slight an age, familiar\nknowledge of foreign and archaic literature supplying a mature\nbackground too seldom possessed by amateur authors.\n\nIt is as a poet that Mrs. Cole has been least known, since her verse was\nnot of frequent occurrence in the amateur press. A glance at the few\nexisting specimens, however, demonstrates conclusively that her poetical\ngifts were by no means inconsiderable; and that had she chosen such a\ncourse, she might easily have become one of the leading bards of the\nUnited. Verse like the unnamed autumn pieces in =Leaflets= and =The\nHellenian= possess an aptness and cleverness of fancy which bespeak the\ntrue poet despite trivial technical imperfections.\n\nIn fiction the extent of Mrs. Cole's genius was still further revealed,\nnearly all her narratives moving along with impeccable grace and\nfluency. Her plots were for the most part light and popular in nature,\nand would have reflected credit on any professional writer of modern\nmagazine tales. Of her stories, \"The Picture,\" appearing in =Leaflets=\nfor October, 1913, is an excellent example. More dramatic in quality is\n\"Her Wish,\" in the August, 1914, =Olympian=. This brief tragedy of a\nSerbian and his bride is perhaps one of the very first tales written\naround the World War.\n\nBut it is in the domain of the literary essay that this authoress rose\nto loftiest altitude. Of wide and profound reading, and of keen and\ndiscriminating mind, Mrs. Cole presented in a style of admirable grace\nand lucidity her reactions to the best works of numerous standard\nauthors, ancient and modern, English and foreign. The value of such work\nin amateurdom, extending the cultural outlook and displaying the outside\nworld as seen through the eyes of a gifted, respected, and\nrepresentative member, scarce needs the emphasis of the commentator. He\nwho can link the amateur and larger spheres in a pleasing and acceptable\nfashion, deserves the highest approbation and panegyric that the United\ncan bestow. Notable indeed are Mrs. Cole's sound reviews of Sir Thomas\nBrowne's \"Hydriotaphia\" in THE UNITED AMATEUR, of \"Pelle, the Conqueror\"\nin =The Tryout=, and of numerous South American works but little known\nto Northern readers. Of equal merit are such terse and delightful essays\nas \"M. Tullius Cicero, Pater Patriae,\" where the essayist invests a\nclassical theme with all the living charm of well-restrained\nsubjectivity. The style of these writings is in itself captivating; the\nvocabulary containing enough words of Latin derivation to rescue it from\nthe Boeotian harshness typical of this age. All that has been said of\nMrs. Cole's broader reviews may be said of her amateur criticism, much\nof which graced the columns of =The Olympian= and other magazines.\n\nThe exclusively journalistic skill of Mrs. Cole now remains to be\nconsidered, and this we find as brilliant as her other attainments. As\nthe editor of numerous papers during every stage of her career, she\nexhibited phenomenal taste and enterprise; never failing to create\nenthusiasm and evoke encomium with her ventures both individual and\nco-operative. Her gift for gathering, selecting and writing news was\nquite unexampled. As the reporter =par excellence= of both associations,\nshe was the main reliance of other editors for convention reports and\ngeneral items; all of which were phrased with an ease, urbanity, and\npersonality that lent them distinctiveness. Not the least of her\nqualities was a gentle and unobtrusive humour which enlivened her\nlighter productions. Amateurdom will long remember the quaint piquancy\nof the issues of =The Martian= which she cleverly published in the name\nof her infant son.\n\nDuring these latter days nearly every amateur has expressed a kind of\nincredulity that Mrs. Cole can indeed be no more, and in this the\npresent writer must needs share. To realise that her gifted pen has\nceased to enrich our small literary world requires a painful effort on\nthe part of everyone who has followed her brilliant progress in the\nfield of letters. The United loses more by her sudden and untimely\ndemise than can well be reckoned at this moment.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    JULY 1919\n\n\nAmericanism\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft\n\nLaureate\n\nIt is easy to sentimentalise on the subject of \"the American\nspirit\"--what it is, may be, or should be. Exponents of various novel\npolitical and social theories are particularly given to this practice,\nnearly always concluding that \"true Americanism\" is nothing more or less\nthan a national application of their respective individual doctrines.\n\nSlightly less superficial observers hit upon the abstract principle of\n\"Liberty\" as the keynote of Americanism, interpreting this justly\nesteemed principle as anything from Bolshevism to the right to drink\n2.75 per cent. beer. \"Opportunity\" is another favourite byword, and one\nwhich is certainly not without real significance. The synonymousness of\n\"America\" and \"opportunity\" has been inculcated into many a young head\nof the present generation by Emerson via Montgomery's \"Leading Facts of\nAmerican History.\" But it is worthy of note that nearly all would-be\ndefiners of \"Americanism\" fail through their prejudiced unwillingness to\ntrace the quality to its European source. They cannot bring themselves\nto see that abiogenesis is as rare in the realm of ideas as it is in the\nkingdom of organic life; and consequently waste their efforts in trying\nto treat America as if it were an isolated phenomenon without ancestry.\n\n\"Americanism\" is expanded Anglo-Saxonism. It is the spirit of England,\ntransplanted to a soil of vast extent and diversity, and nourished for a\ntime under pioneer conditions calculated to increase its democratic\naspects without impairing its fundamental virtues. It is the spirit of\ntruth, honour, justice, morality, moderation, individualism,\nconservative liberty, magnanimity, toleration, enterprise,\nindustriousness, and progress--which is England--plus the element of\nequality and opportunity caused by pioneer settlement. It is the\nexpression of the world's highest race under the most favourable social,\npolitical, and geographical conditions. Those who endeavour to belittle\nthe importance of our British ancestry, are invited to consider the\nother nations of this continent. All these are equally \"American\" in\nevery particular, differing only in race-stock and heritage; yet of them\nall, none save British Canada will even bear comparison with us. We are\ngreat because we are a part of the great Anglo-Saxon cultural sphere; a\nsection detached only after a century and a half of heavy colonisation\nand English rule, which gave to our land the ineradicable stamp of\nBritish civilisation.\n\nMost dangerous and fallacious of the several misconceptions of\nAmericanism is that of the so-called \"melting-pot\" of races and\ntraditions. It is true that this country has received a vast influx of\nnon-English immigrants who come hither to enjoy without hardship the\nliberties which our British ancestors carved out in toil and bloodshed.\nIt is also true that such of them as belong to the Teutonic and Celtic\nraces are capable of assimilation to our English type and of becoming\nvaluable acquisitions to the population. But, from this it does not\nfollow that a mixture of really alien blood or ideas has accomplished or\ncan accomplish anything but harm. Observation of Europe shows us the\nrelative status and capability of the several races, and we see that the\nmelting together of English gold and alien brass is not very likely to\nproduce any alloy superior or even equal to the original gold.\nImmigration cannot, perhaps, be cut off altogether, but it should be\nunderstood that aliens who choose America as their residence must accept\nthe prevailing language and culture as their own; and neither try to\nmodify our institutions, nor to keep alive their own in our midst. We\nmust not, as the greatest man of our age declared, suffer this nation to\nbecome a \"polyglot boarding house.\"\n\nThe greatest foe to rational Americanism is that dislike for our parent\nnation which holds sway amongst the ignorant and bigoted, and which is\nkept alive largely by certain elements of the population who seem to\nconsider the sentiments of Southern and Western Ireland more important\nthan those of the United States. In spite of the plain fact that a\nseparate Ireland would weaken civilisation and menace the world's peace\nby introducing a hostile and undependable wedge betwixt the two major\nparts of Saxondom, these irresponsible elements continue to encourage\nrebellion in the Green Isle; and in so doing tend to place this nation\nin a distressingly anomalous position as an abettor of crime and\nsedition against the Mother Land. Disgusting beyond words are the public\nhonours paid to political criminals like Edward, alias Eamonn, de\nValera, whose very presence at large among us is an affront to our\ndignity and heritage. Never may we appreciate or even fully comprehend\nour own place and mission in the world, till we can banish those clouds\nof misunderstanding which float between us and the source of our\nculture.\n\nBut the features of Americanism peculiar to this continent must not be\nbelittled. In the abolition of fixed and rigid class lines a distinct\nsociological advance is made, permitting a steady and progressive\nrecruiting of the upper levels from the fresh and vigorous body of the\npeople beneath. Thus opportunities of the choicest sort await every\ncitizen alike, whilst the biological quality of the cultivated classes\nis improved by the cessation of that narrow inbreeding which\ncharacterises European aristocracy.\n\nTotal separation of civil and religious affairs, the greatest political\nand intellectual advance since the Renaissance, is also a local\nAmerican--and more particularly a Rhode Island--triumph. Agencies are\ntoday subtly at work to undermine this principle, and to impose upon us\nthrough devious political influences the Papal chains which Henry VIII\nfirst struck from our limbs; chains unfelt since the bloody reign of\nMary, and infinitely worse than the ecclesiastical machinery which Roger\nWilliams rejected. But when the vital relation of intellectual freedom\nto genuine Americanism shall be fully impressed upon the people, it is\nlikely that such sinister undercurrents will subside.\n\nThe main struggle which awaits Americanism is not with reaction, but\nwith radicalism. Our age is one of restless and unintelligent\niconoclasm, and abounds with shrewd sophists who use the name\n\"Americanism\" to cover attacks on that institution itself. Such familiar\nterms and phrases as \"democracy,\" \"liberty,\" or \"freedom of speech\" are\nbeing distorted to cover the wildest forms of anarchy, whilst our old\nrepresentative institutions are being attacked as \"un-American\" by\nforeign immigrants who are incapable both of understanding them or of\ndevising anything better.\n\nThis country would benefit from a wider practice of sound Americanism,\nwith its accompanying recognition of an Anglo-Saxon source. Americanism\nimplies freedom, progress, and independence; but it does not imply a\nrejection of the past, nor a renunciation of traditions and experience.\nLet us view the term in its real, practical, and unsentimental meaning.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    NOVEMBER 1919\n\n\nThe White Ship\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft\n\nI am Basil Elton, keeper of the North Point light that my father and\ngrandfather kept before me. Far from the shore stands the grey\nlighthouse, above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is low,\nbut unseen when the tide is high. Past that beacon for a century have\nswept the majestic barques of the seven seas. In the days of my\ngrandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and\nnow there are so few that I sometimes feel strangely alone, as though I\nwere the last man on our planet.\n\nFrom far shores came those white-sailed argosies of old; from far\nEastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odours linger about\nstrange gardens and gay temples. The old captains of the sea came often\nto my grandfather and told him of these things, which in turn he told to\nmy father, and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when\nthe wind howled eerily from the East. And I have read more of these\nthings, and of many things besides, in the books men gave me when I was\nyoung and filled with wonder.\n\nBut more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the\nsecret lore of ocean. Blue, green, grey, white or black; smooth,\nruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days have I\nwatched it and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told to\nme only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with\nthe years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things\nmore strange and more distant in space and in time. Sometimes at\ntwilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me\nglimpses of the ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of\nthe sea have grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the\nways beneath. And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that\nwere and the ways that might be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is\nmore ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the\ndreams of Time.\n\nOut of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon\nwas full and high in the heavens. Out of the South it would glide very\nsmoothly and silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or\ncalm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always\nglide smoothly and silently, its sails distent and its long strange\ntiers of oars moving rhythmically. One night I espied upon the deck a\nman, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for fair\nunknown shores. Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and\never did he beckon me.\n\nVery brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and I\nwalked out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of moonbeams.\nThe man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language I\nseemed to know well, and the hours were filled with soft songs of the\noarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious South, golden with the glow\nof that full, mellow moon.\n\nAnd when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of\nfar lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown. Up from the sea rose\nlordly terraces of verdure, tree-studded, and shewing here and there the\ngleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples. As we drew\nnearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the Land of\nZar, where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men\nonce and then are forgotten. And when I looked upon the terraces again I\nsaw that what he said was true, for among the sights before me were many\nthings I had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon in the\nphosphorescent depths of ocean. There too were forms and fantasies more\nsplendid than I had ever known; the visions of young poets who died in\nwant before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed. But\nwe did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that\nhe who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore.\n\nAs the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar,\nwe beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and\nthe bearded man said to me, \"This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand\nWonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain\nto fathom.\" And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city\nwas greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before. Into the sky\nthe spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their\npeaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls,\nover which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet\nadorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned mightily to\nenter this fascinating yet repellent city, and beseeched the bearded man\nto land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he\ngently denied my wish, saying, \"Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand\nWonders, many have passed but none returned. Therein walk only d\u00e6mons\nand mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with\nthe unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that\nreigns over the city.\" So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of\nThalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose\nglossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared.\n\nThen came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where\nas far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours\nbeneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song\nand snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so\ndelicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the\nscene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we\napproached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the\nflowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The\nwind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel\nodour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we\nsailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at\nlast, saying, \"This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\"\n\nSo once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm\nblessed seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes. Day after day and\nnight after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would\nlisten to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when\nwe sailed away from my far native land. And it was by moonlight that we\nanchored at last in the harbour of Sona-Nyl, which is guarded by twin\nheadlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent\narch. This is the Land of Fancy, and we walked to the verdant shore upon\na golden bridge of moonbeams.\n\nIn the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither\nsuffering nor death; and there I dwelt for many \u00e6ons. Green are the\ngroves and pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical\nthe streams, clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the\ntemples, castles, and cities of Sona-Nyl. Of that land there is no\nbound, for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful.\nOver the countryside and amidst the splendour of cities can move at will\nthe happy folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed\nhappiness. For the \u00e6ons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through\ngardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and\nwhere the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms. I climbed\ngentle hills from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of\nloveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with\nthe golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant\nhorizon. And I viewed by moonlight the sparkling sea, the crystal\nheadlands, and the placid harbour wherein lay anchored the White Ship.\n\nIt was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp\nthat I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt\nthe first stirrings of unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and\ntold him of my new yearning to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man\nhath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the\nWest. It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all\nthat we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate. But the bearded man\nsaid to me, \"Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say Cathuria\nlies. In Sona-Nyl there is no pain nor death, but who can tell what lies\nbeyond the basalt pillars of the West?\" Natheless at the next full moon\nI boarded the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the\nhappy harbour for untravelled seas.\n\nAnd the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars\nof the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full\nmoon. In my mind I would often picture the unknown Land of Cathuria with\nits splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights\nthere awaited me. \"Cathuria,\" I would say to myself, \"is the abode of\ngods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold. Its forests are of aloe\nand sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the\ntrees flutter gay birds sweet with song. On the green and flowery\nmountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and\npainted glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of\nsilver, where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come\nfrom the grotto-born river Narg. And the cities of Cathuria are\ncinctured with golden walls, and their pavements are also of gold. In\nthe gardens of these cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes\nwhose beds are of coral and amber. At night the streets and the gardens\nare lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from three-coloured shell of the\ntortoise, and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the\nlutanist. And the houses of the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, each\nbuilt over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred Narg. Of\nmarble and porphyry are the houses, and roofed with glittering gold\nthat reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendour of the\ncities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks. Fairest of all\nis the palace of the great monarch Dorieb, whom some say to be a demigod\nand others a god. High is the palace of Dorieb, and many are the turrets\nof marble upon its walls. In its wide halls may multitudes assemble, and\nhere hang the trophies of the ages. And the roof is of pure gold, set\nupon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of\ngods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seem to gaze upon\nthe living Olympus. And the floor of the palace is of glass, under which\nflow the cunningly lighted waters of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not\nknown beyond the bounds of lovely Cathuria.\"\n\nThus would I speak to myself of Cathuria, but ever would the bearded man\nwarn me to turn back to the happy shores of Sona-Nyl; for Sona-Nyl is\nknown of men, while none hath ever beheld Cathuria.\n\nAnd on the thirty-first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the\nbasalt pillars of the West. Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man\nmight peer beyond them or see their summits--which indeed some say reach\neven to the heavens. And the bearded man again implored me to turn back,\nbut I heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars I\nfancied there came the notes of singer and lutanist; sweeter than the\nsweetest songs of Sona-Nyl, and sounding mine own praises; the praises\nof me, who had voyaged far under the full moon and dwelt in the Land of\nFancy.\n\nSo to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into the mist betwixt\nthe basalt pillars of the West. And when the music ceased and the mist\nlifted, we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but a swift-rushing\nresistless sea, over which our helpless barque was borne toward some\nunknown goal. Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling\nwaters, and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic\nspray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down\nto abysmal nothingness. Then did the bearded man say to me with tears on\nhis cheek, \"We have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we\nmay never behold again. The gods are greater than men, and they have\nconquered.\" And I closed my eyes before the crash that I knew would\ncome, shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its\nmocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent.\n\nOut of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and of\nthings which were not men. From the East tempestuous winds arose, and\nchilled me as I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen\nbeneath my feet. Then as I heard another crash I opened my eyes and\nbeheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse from whence I had\nsailed so many \u00e6ons ago. In the darkness below there loomed the vast\nblurred outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks, and as I\nglanced out over the waste I saw that the light had failed for the first\ntime since my grandfather had assumed its care.\n\nAnd in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I\nsaw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at\nthe hour I sailed away. With the dawn I descended the tower and looked\nfor wreckage upon the rocks, but what I found was only this: a strange\ndead bird whose hue was as of the azure sky, and a single shattered\nspar, of a whiteness greater than that of the wave-tips or of the\nmountain snow.\n\nAnd thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many\ntimes since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens, the White\nShip from the South came never again.\n\n\nTO MISTRESS SOPHIA SIMPLE, QUEEN OF THE CINEMA\n\n(With humblest apologies to Randolph St. John, Gent.)\n\nL.

P. Lovecraft\n\nIn a former article our readers have been shewn the fundamental sources\nof literary inspiration, and the leading prerequisites to expression. It\nremains to furnish hints concerning expression itself; its forms,\ncustoms, and technicalities, in order that the young writer may lose\nnothing of force or charm in presenting his ideas to the public.\n\n\nGrammar\n\nA review of the elements of English grammar would be foreign to the\npurpose of this department. The subject is one taught in all common\nschools, and may be presumed to be understood by every aspirant to\nauthorship. It is necessary, however, to caution the beginner to keep a\nreliable grammar and dictionary always beside him, that he may avoid in\nhis compositions the frequent errors which imperceptibly corrupt even\nthe purest ordinary speech. As a general rule, it is well to give close\ncritical scrutiny to all colloquial phrases and expressions of doubtful\nparsing, as well as to all words and usages which have a strained or\nunfamiliar sound. The human memory is not to be trusted too far, and\nmost minds harbour a considerable number of slight linguistic faults and\ninelegancies picked up from random discourse or from the pages of\nnewspapers, magazines, and popular modern books.\n\n\nTypes of Mistakes\n\nMost of the mistakes of young authors, aside from those gross violations\nof syntax which ordinary education corrects, may perhaps be enumerated\nas follows.\n\n    (1) Erroneous plurals of nouns, as =vallies= or =echos=.\n\n    (2) Barbarous compound nouns, as =viewpoint= or =upkeep=.\n\n    (3) Want of correspondence in number between noun and verb where the\n    two are widely separated or the construction involved.\n\n    (4) Ambiguous use of pronouns.\n\n    (5) Erroneous case of pronouns, as =whom= for =who=, and vice versa,\n    or phrases like \"between you and =I=,\" or \"Let =we= who are loyal,\n    act promptly.\"\n\n    (6) Erroneous use of =shall= and =will=, and of other auxiliary\n    verbs.\n\n    (7) Use of intransitive for transitive verbs, as \"he =was graduated=\n    from college,\" or vice versa, as \"he =ingratiated= with the tyrant.\"\n\n    (8) Use of nouns for verbs, as \"he =motored= to Boston,\" or \"he\n    =voiced= a protest.\"\n\n    (9) Errors in moods and tenses of verbs, as \"If I =was= he, I should\n    do otherwise,\" or \"He said the earth =was= round.\"\n\n    (10) The split infinitive, as \"=to= calmly =glide=.\"\n\n    (11) The erroneous perfect infinitive, as \"Last week I expected =to\n    have met= you.\"\n\n    (12) False verb-forms, as \"I =pled= with him.\"\n\n    (13) Use of =like= for =as=, as \"I strive to write =like= Pope\n    wrote.\"\n\n    (14) Misuse of prepositions, as \"The gift was bestowed =to= an\n    unworthy object,\" or \"The gold was divided =between= the five men.\"\n\n    (15) The superfluous conjunction, as \"I wish =for= you to do this.\"\n\n    (16) Use of words in wrong =senses=, as \"The book greatly\n    =intrigued= me,\" \"=Leave= me take this,\" \"He was =obsessed= with the\n    idea,\" or \"He is a =meticulous= writer.\"\n\n    (17) Erroneous use of non-Anglicised foreign forms, as \"a strange\n    =phenomena=,\" or \"two =stratas= of clouds.\"\n\n    (18) Use of false or unauthorized words, as =burglarize= or\n    =supremest=.\n\n    (19) Errors of taste, including vulgarisms, pompousness, repetition,\n    vagueness, ambiguousness, colloquialism, bathos, bombast, pleonasm,\n    tautology, harshness, mixed metaphor, and every sort of rhetorical\n    awkwardness.\n\n    (20) Errors of spelling and punctuation, and confusion of forms such\n    as that which leads many to place an apostrophe in the possessive\n    pronoun =its=.\n\nOf all blunders, there is hardly one which might not be avoided through\ndiligent study of simple textbooks on grammar and rhetoric, intelligent\nperusal of the best authors, and care and forethought in composition.\nAlmost no excuse exists for their persistent occurrence, since the\nsources of correction are so numerous and so available. Many of the\npopular manuals of good English are extremely useful, especially to\npersons whose reading is not as yet extensive; but such works sometimes\nerr in being too pedantically precise and formal. For correct writing,\nthe cultivation of patience and mental accuracy is essential. Throughout\nthe young author's period of apprenticeship, he must keep reliable\ndictionaries and textbooks at his elbow; eschewing as far as possible\nthat hasty extemporaneous manner of writing which is the privilege of\nmore advanced students. He must take no popular usage for granted, nor\nmust he ever hesitate, in case of doubt, to fall back on the authority\nof his books.\n\n\nReading\n\nNo aspiring author should content himself with a mere acquisition of\ntechnical rules. As Mrs. Renshaw remarked in the preceding article,\n\"Impression should ever precede and be stronger than expression.\" All\nattempts at gaining literary polish must begin with judicious =reading=,\nand the learner must never cease to hold this phase uppermost. In many\ncases, the usage of good authors will be found a more effective guide\nthan any amount of precept. A page of Addison or of Irving will teach\nmore of style than a whole manual of rules, whilst a story of Poe's will\nimpress upon the mind a more vivid notion of powerful and correct\ndescription and narration than will ten dry chapters of a bulky\ntextbook. Let every student read unceasingly the best writers, guided by\nthe admirable Reading Table which has adorned the UNITED AMATEUR during\nthe past two years.\n\nIt is also important that cheaper types of reading, if hitherto\nfollowed, be dropped. Popular magazines inculcate a careless and\ndeplorable style which is hard to unlearn, and which impedes the\nacquisition of a purer style. If such things must be read, let them be\nskimmed over as lightly as possible. An excellent habit to cultivate is\nthe analytical study of the King James Bible. For simple yet rich and\nforceful English, this masterly production is hard to equal; and even\nthough its Saxon vocabulary and poetic rhythm be unsuited to general\ncomposition, it is an invaluable model for writers on quaint or\nimaginative themes. Lord Dunsany, perhaps the greatest living prose\nartist, derived nearly all of his stylistic tendencies from the\nScriptures; and the contemporary critic Boyd points out very acutely the\nloss sustained by most Catholic Irish writers through their\nunfamiliarity with the historic volume and its traditions.\n\n\nVocabulary\n\nOne superlatively important effect of wide reading is the enlargement of\nvocabulary which always accompanies it. The average student is gravely\nimpeded by the narrow range of words from which he must choose, and he\nsoon discovers that in long compositions he cannot avoid monotony. In\nreading, the novice should note the varied mode of expression practiced\nby good authors, and should keep in his mind for future use the many\nappropriate synonymes he encounters. Never should an unfamiliar word be\npassed over without elucidation; for with a little conscientious\nresearch we may each day add to our conquests in the realm of philology,\nand become more and more ready for graceful independent expression.\n\nBut in enlarging the vocabulary, we must beware lest we misuse our new\npossessions. We must remember that there are fine distinctions betwixt\napparently similar words, and that language must ever be selected with\nintelligent care. As the learned Dr. Blair points out in his Lectures,\n\"Hardly in any language are there two words that convey precisely the\nsame idea; a person thoroughly conversant in the propriety of language\nwill always be able to observe something that distinguishes them.\"\n\n\nElemental Phases\n\nBefore considering the various formal classes of composition, it is well\nto note certain elements common to them all. Upon analysis, every piece\nof writing will be found to contain one or more of the following basic\nprinciples: =Description=, or an account of the appearance of things;\n=Narration=, or an account of the actions of things; =Exposition=, which\ndefines and explains with precision and lucidity; =Argument=, which\ndiscovers truth and rejects error; and =Persuasion=, which urges to\ncertain thoughts or acts. The first two are the bases of fiction; the\nthird didactic, scientific, historical and editorial writings. The\nfourth and fifth are mostly employed in conjunction with the third, in\nscientific, philosophical, and partisan literature. All these\nprinciples, however, are usually mingled with one another. The work of\nfiction may have its scientific, historical, or argumentative side;\nwhilst the textbook or treatise may be embellished with descriptions and\nanecdotes.\n\n\nDescription\n\nDescription, in order to be effective, calls upon two mental qualities;\nobservation and discrimination. Many descriptions depend for their\nvividness upon the accurate reproduction of details; others upon the\njudicious selection of salient, typical, or significant points.\n\nOne cannot be too careful in the selection of adjectives for\ndescriptions. Words or compounds which describe precisely, and which\nconvey exactly the right suggestions to the mind of the reader, are\nessential. As an example, let us consider the following list of epithets\napplicable to a =fountain=, taken from Richard Green Parker's admirable\nwork on composition.\n\n    Crystal, gushing, rustling, silver, gently-gliding, parting, pearly,\n    weeping, bubbling, gurgling, chiding, clear, grass-fringed,\n    moss-fringed, pebble-paved, verdant, sacred, grass-margined,\n    moss-margined, trickling, soft, dew-sprinkled, fast-flowing,\n    delicate, delicious, clean, straggling, dancing, vaulting,\n    deep-embosomed, leaping, murmuring, muttering, whispering,\n    prattling, twaddling, swelling, sweet-rolling, gently-flowing,\n    rising, sparkling, flowing, frothy, dew-distilling, dew-born,\n    exhaustless, inexhaustible, never-decreasing, never-failing,\n    heaven-born, earth-born, deep-divulging, drought-dispelling,\n    thirst-allaying, refreshing, soul-refreshing, earth-refreshing,\n    laving, lavish, plant-nourishing.\n\nFor the purpose of securing epithets at once accurate and felicitous,\nthe young author should familiarize himself thoroughly with the general\naspect and phenomena of Nature, as well as with the ideas and\nassociations which these things produce in the human mind.\n\nDescriptions may be of objects, of places, of animals, and of persons.\nThe complete description of an object may be said to consist of the\nfollowing elements:\n\n    1. When, where, and how seen; when made or found; how affected by\n    time.\n\n    2. History and traditional associations.\n\n    3. Substance and manner of origin.\n\n    4. Size, shape, and appearance.\n\n    5. Analogies with similar objects.\n\n    6. Sensations produced by contemplating it.\n\n    7. Its purpose or function.\n\n    8. Its effects--the results of its existence.\n\nDescriptions of places must of course vary with the type of the place.\nOf natural scenery, the following elements are notable:\n\n    1. How beheld--at dawn, noon, evening, or night; by starlight or\n    moonlight.\n\n    2. Natural features--flat or hilly; barren or thickly grown; kind of\n    vegetation; trees, mountains, and rivers.\n\n    3. Works of man--cultivation, edifices, bridges; modifications of\n    scenery produced by man.\n\n    4. Inhabitants and other forms of animal life.\n\n    5. Local customs and traditions.\n\n    6. Sounds--of water; forest; leaves; birds; barnyards; human beings;\n    machinery.\n\n    7. View--prospect on every side, and the place itself as seen from\n    afar.\n\n    8. Analogies to other scenes, especially famous scenes.\n\n    9. History and associations.\n\n    10. Sensations produced by contemplating it.\n\nDescriptions of animals may be analyzed thus:\n\n    1. Species and size.\n\n    2. Covering.\n\n    3. Parts.\n\n    4. Abode.\n\n    5. Characteristics and habits.\n\n    6. Food.\n\n    7. Utility or harmfulness.\n\n    8. History and associations.\n\nDescriptions of persons can be infinitely varied. Sometimes a single\nfelicitous touch brings out the whole type and character, as when the\nmodern author Leonard Merrick hints at shabby gentility by mentioning\nthe combination of a frock coat with the trousers of a tweed suit.\nSuggestion is very powerful in this field, especially when mental\nqualities are to be delineated. Treatment should vary with the author's\nobject; whether to portray a mere personified idea, or to give a quasi\nphotographic view, mental and physical, of some vividly living\ncharacter. In a general description, the following elements may be\nfound:\n\n    1. Appearance, stature, complexion, proportions, features.\n\n    2. Most conspicuous feature.\n\n    3. Expression.\n\n    4. Grace or ugliness.\n\n    5. Attire--nature, taste, quality.\n\n    6. Habits, attainments, graces, or awkwardnesses.\n\n    7. Character--moral and intellectual--place in the community.\n\n    8. Notable special qualities.\n\nIn considering the preceding synopses, the reader must remember that\nthey are only suggestions, and not for =literal= use. The extent of any\ndescription is to be determined by its place in the composition; by\ntaste and fitness. It should be added, that in fiction description must\nnot be carried to excess. A plethora of it leads to dulness, so that it\nmust ever be balanced by a brisk flow of =Narration=, which we are about\nto consider.\n\n\nNarration\n\nNarration is an account of action, or of successive events, either real\nor imagined; and is therefore the basis both of history and of fiction.\nTo be felicitous and successful, it demands an intelligent exercise of\ntaste and discrimination; salient points must be selected, and the order\nof time and of circumstances must be well maintained. It is deemed\nwisest in most cases to give narratives a climactic form; leading from\nlesser to greater events, and culminating in that chief incident upon\nwhich the story is primarily founded, or which makes the other parts\nimportant through its own importance. This principle, of course, cannot\nbe literally followed in all historical and biographical narratives.\n\n\nFictional Narration\n\nThe essential point of fictional narration is =plot=, which may be\ndefined as a =sequence of incidents designed to awaken the reader's\ninterest and curiosity as to the result=. Plots may be simple or\ncomplex; but suspense, and climactic progress from one incident to\nanother, are essential. Every incident in a fictional work should have\nsome bearing on the climax or denouement, and any denouement which is\nnot the inevitable result of the preceding incidents is awkward and\nunliterary. No formal course in fiction-writing can equal a close and\nobservant perusal of the stories of Edgar Allan Poe or Ambrose Bierce.\nIn these masterpieces one may find that unbroken sequence and linkage of\nincident and result which mark the ideal tale. Observe how, in \"The Fall\nof the House of Usher,\" each separate event foreshadows and leads up to\nthe tremendous catastrophe and its hideous suggestion. Poe was an\nabsolute master of the mechanics of his craft. Observe also how Bierce\ncan attain the most stirring denouements from a few simple happenings;\ndenouements which develop purely from these preceding circumstances.\n\nIn fictional narration, verisimilitude is absolutely essential. A story\nmust be consistent and must contain no event glaringly removed from the\nusual order of things, unless that event is the main incident, and is\napproached with the most careful preparation. In real life, odd and\nerratic things do occasionally happen; but they are out of place in an\nordinary story, since fiction is a sort of idealization of the average.\nDevelopment should be as lifelike as possible, and a weak, trickling\nconclusion should be assiduously avoided. The end of a story must be\nstronger rather than weaker than the beginning; since it is the end\nwhich contains the denouement or culmination, and which will leave the\nstrongest impression upon the reader. It would not be amiss for the\nnovice to write the last paragraph of his story first, once a synopsis\nof the plot has been carefully prepared--as it always should be. In this\nway he will be able to concentrate his freshest mental vigour upon the\nmost important part of his narrative; and if any changes be later found\nneedful, they can easily be made. In no part of a narrative should a\ngrand or emphatic thought or passage be followed by one of tame or\nprosaic quality. This is =anticlimax=, and exposes a writer to much\nridicule. Notice the absurd effect of the following couplet--which was,\nhowever, written by no less a person than Waller:\n\n    \"Under the tropic is our language spoke,\n    =And part of Flanders hath receiv'd our yoke=.\"\n\n\nUnity, Mass, Coherence\n\nIn developing a theme, whether descriptive or narrative, it is necessary\nthat three structural qualities be present: Unity, Mass, and Coherence.\nUnity is that principle whereby every part of a composition must have\nsome bearing on the central theme. It is the principle which excludes\nall extraneous matter, and demands that all threads converge toward the\nclimax. Classical violations of Unity may be found in the =episodes= of\nHomer and other epic poets of antiquity, as well as in the digressions\nof Fielding and other celebrated novelists; but no beginner should\nventure to emulate such liberties. Unity is the quality we have lately\nnoted and praised in Poe and Bierce.\n\nMass is that principle which requires the more important parts of a\ncomposition to occupy correspondingly important places in the whole\ncomposition, the paragraph, and the sentence. It is that law of taste\nwhich insists that emphasis be placed where emphasis is due, and is most\nstrikingly embodied in the previously mentioned necessity for an\nemphatic ending. According to this law, the end of a composition is its\nmost important part, with the beginning next in importance.\n\nCoherence is that principle which groups related parts together and\nkeeps unrelated parts removed from one another. It applies, like Mass,\nto the whole composition, the paragraph, or the sentence. It demands\nthat kindred events be narrated without interruption, effect following\ncause in a steady flow.\n\n\nForms of Composition\n\nFew writers succeed equally in all the various branches of literature.\nEach type of thought has its own particular form of expression, based on\nnatural appropriateness; and the average author tends to settle into\nthat form which best fits his particular personality. Many, however,\nfollow more than one form; and some writers change from one form to\nanother as advancing years produce alterations in their mental processes\nor points of view.\n\nIt is well, in the interests of breadth and discipline, for the beginner\nto exercise himself to some degree in every form of literary art. He may\nthus discover that which best fits his mind, and develop hitherto\nunsuspected potentialities.\n\nWe have so far surveyed only those simpler phases of writing which\ncentre in prose fiction and descriptive essays. Hereafter we hope to\ntouch upon didactic, argumentative, and persuasive writing; to\ninvestigate to some extent the sources of rhetorical strength and\nelegance; and to consider a few major aspects of versification.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MAY 1920\n\n\nFor What Does the United Stand?\n\nIt is easy to comply in 500 words with a request for an article on what\nthe United represents. An amateur journalistic association is generally\ntoo democratic to have any one object for long; it is rather a\nbattle-ground between the proponents of opposed ideas.\n\nI think, however, that since the dawn of the Hoffman administration,\nwhen the best elements were automatically sifted out through the\nsecession of most of the confirmed politicians, we have been gradually\nacquiring a policy and a tradition which will endure. The\nprinting-press, political and frivolous phases have been passed through;\nand our aspirations seem to be crystallising into a form more worthy\nthan any of our past aspirations.\n\nJudging from the majority of our truly active members, the United now\naims at the development of its adherents in the direction of purely\nartistic literary perception and expression; to be effected by the\nencouragement of writing, the giving of constructive criticism, and the\ncultivation of correspondence friendships among scholars and aspirants\ncapable of stimulating and aiding one another's efforts. It aims at the\nrevival of the uncommercial spirit; the real creative thought which\nmodern conditions have done their worst to suppress and eradicate. It\nseeks to banish mediocrity as a goal and standard; to place before its\nmembers the classical and the universal and to draw their minds from the\ncommonplace to the beautiful.\n\nThe United aims to assist those whom other forms of literary influence\ncannot reach. The non-university man, the dwellers in distant places,\nthe recluse, the invalid, the very young, the elderly; all these are\nincluded within our scope. And beside our novices stand persons of\nmature cultivation and experience, ready to assist for the sheer joy of\nassisting. In no other society does wealth or previous learning count\nfor so little. Merit and aspiration form the only criterion we apply to\nour members, nor has poverty or primitive crudity ever retarded the\nsteady progress of any determined aspirant among us. We ask only that\nthe goal be high; that the souls of our band be seeking the antique\nlegacy of verdant Helicon.\n\nPractically, we are aware of many obstacles; yet we think we are in the\nmain fulfilling our functions. Naturally, we do not expect to make a\nShelley or Swinburne of every rhymer who joins us, or a Poe or Dunsany\nof every teller of tales; but if we enable these persons to appreciate\nShelley and Swinburne and Poe and Dunsany, and teach them how to shed\ntheir dominant faults and use words correctly and expressively, we\ncannot call ourselves unsuccessful and only genius can lead to the\nheights; it is our province merely to point the way and assist on the\ngentler, lower slopes.\n\nThe United, then, stands for education in the eternal truths of literary\nart, and for personal aid in the realisation of its members' literary\npotentialities. It is a university, stripped of every artificiality and\nconventionality, and thrown open to all without distinction. Here may\nevery man shine according to his genius, and here may the small as well\nas the great writer know the bliss of appreciation and the glory of\nrecognised achievement.\n\n                                                      H. P. LOVECRAFT.\n\n\n\n\n                   THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n Official Organ of the United Amateur Press Association\n\n VOLUME XX    ELROY, WIS., SEPTEMBER, 1920     NUMBER 1\n\n\nPoetry and the Gods\n\nANNA HELEN CROFTS AND HENRY PAGET-LOWE\n\nA damp, gloomy evening in April it was, just after the close of the\nGreat War, when Marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and\nwishes; unheard-of yearnings which floated out of the spacious\ntwentieth-century drawing-room, up the misty deeps of the air, and\nEastward to far olive-groves in Arcady which she had seen only in her\ndreams. She had entered the room in abstraction, turned off the glaring\nchandeliers, and now reclined on a soft divan by a solitary lamp which\nshed over the reading table a green glow as soothing and delicious as\nmoonlight through the foliage about an antique shrine. Attired simply,\nin a low-cut evening dress of black, she appeared outwardly a typical\nproduct of modern civilisation; but tonight she felt the immeasurable\ngulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic surroundings. Was it\nbecause of the strange home in which she lived; that abode of coldness\nwhere relations were always strained and the inmates scarcely more than\nstrangers? Was it that, or was it some greater and less explicable\nmisplacement in Time and Space, whereby she had been born too late, too\nearly, or too far away from the haunts of her spirit ever to harmonise\nwith the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality? To dispel the mood\nwhich was engulfing her more deeply each moment, she took a magazine\nfrom the table and searched for some healing bit of poetry. Poetry had\nalways relieved her troubled mind better than anything else, though many\nthings in the poetry she had seen detracted from the influence. Over\nparts of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapour of sterile\nugliness and restraint, like dust on a window-pane through which one\nviews a magnificent sunset.\n\nListlessly turning the magazine's pages, as if searching for an elusive\ntreasure, she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor.\nAn observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had\ndiscovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her\nunattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before. It was only\na bit of _vers libre_, that pitiful compromise of the poet who overleaps\nprose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers; but it had in it\nall the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels, and who gropes\necstatically for unveiled beauty. Devoid of regularity, it yet had the\nwild harmony of winged, spontaneous words; a harmony missing from the\nformal, convention-bound verse she had known. As she read on, her\nsurroundings gradually faded, and soon there lay about her only the\nmists of dream; the purple, star-strown mists beyond Time, where only\ngods and dreamers walk.\n\n    \"Moon over Japan,\n    White butterfly moon!\n    Where the heavy-lidded Buddhas dream\n    To the sound of the cuckoo's call....\n    The white wings of moon-butterflies\n    Flicker down the streets of the city,\n    Blushing into darkness the useless wicks of round lanterns in the\n            hands of girls.\n\n    \"Moon over the tropics,\n    A white-curved bud\n    Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven....\n    The air is full of odours\n    And languorous warm sounds....\n    A flute drones its insect music to the night\n    Below the curving moon-petal of the heavens.\n\n    \"Moon over China,\n    Weary moon on the river of the sky,\n    The stir of light in the willows is like the flashing of a thousand\n            silver minnows\n    Through dark shoals;\n    The tiles on graves and rotting temples flash like ripples,\n    The sky is flecked with clouds like the scales of a dragon.\"\n\nAmid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars of her\ndelight at the coming of a new age of song, a rebirth of Pan. Half\nclosing her eyes, she repeated words whose melody lay hid like crystals\nat the bottom of a stream before the dawn; hidden but to gleam\neffulgently at the birth of day.\n\n    \"Moon over Japan,\n    White butterfly moon!\n\n    \"Moon over the tropics,\n    A white-curved bud\n    Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven.\n    The air is full of odours\n    And languorous warm sounds ... languorous warm sounds.\n\n    \"Moon over China,\n    Weary moon on the river of the sky ... weary moon!\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nOut of the mists gleamed godlike the figure of a youth in winged helmet\nand sandals, caduceus-bearing, and of a beauty like to nothing on earth.\nBefore the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which Apollo had\ngiven him in trade for the nine-corded shell of melody, and upon her\nbrow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses. Then, adoring, Hermes\nspoke:\n\n\"O Nymph more fair than the golden-haired sisters of Cyane or the\nsky-inhabiting Atlantides, beloved of Aphrodite and blessed of Pallas,\nthou hast indeed discovered the secret of the Gods, which lieth in\nbeauty and song. O Prophetess more lovely than the Sybil of Cumae when\nApollo first knew her, thou hast truly spoken of the new age, for even\nnow on Maenalus, Pan sighs and stretches in his sleep, wishful to awake\nand behold about him the little rose-crowned Fauns and the antique\nSatyrs. In thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal else, saving\nonly a few whom the world reject, remembereth; _that the Gods were never\ndead_, but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of Gods in\nlotos-filled Hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset. And now draweth\nnigh the time of their awaking, when coldness and ugliness shall perish,\nand Zeus sit once more on Olympus. Already the sea about Paphos\ntrembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on before,\nand at night on Helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings and\nhalf-remembered notes. Woods and fields are tremulous at twilight with\nthe shimmering of white saltant forms, and immemorial Ocean yields up\ncurious sights beneath thin moons. The Gods are patient, and have slept\nlong, but neither man nor giant shall defy the Gods forever. In Tartarus\nthe Titans writhe, and beneath the fiery Aetna groan the children of\nUranus and Gaea. The day now dawns when man must answer for his\ncenturies of denial, but in sleeping the Gods have grown kind, and will\nnot hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of Gods. Instead will their\nvengeance smite the darkness, fallacy and ugliness which have turned the\nmind of man; and under the sway of bearded Saturnus shall mortals, once\nmore sacrificing unto him, dwell in beauty and delight. This night shalt\nthou know the favour of the Gods, and behold on Parnassus those dreams\nwhich the Gods have through ages sent to Earth to show that they are not\ndead. For poets are the dreams of the Gods, and in each age someone hath\nsung unknowing the message and the promise from the lotos-gardens beyond\nthe sunset.\"\n\nThen in his arms Hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies.\nGentle breezes from the tower of Aiolos wafted them high above warm,\nscented seas, till suddenly they came upon Zeus holding court on the\ndouble-headed Parnassus; his golden throne flanked by Apollo and the\nMuses on the right hand, and by ivy-wreathed Dionysus and\npleasure-flushed Bacchae on the left hand. So much of splendour Marcia\nhad never seen before, either awake or in dreams, but its radiance did\nher no injury, as would have the radiance of lofty Olympus; for in this\nlesser court the Father of Gods had tempered his glories for the sight\nof mortals. Before the laurel-draped mouth of the Corycian cave sat in a\nrow six noble forms with the aspect of mortals, but the countenances of\nGods. These the dreamer recognised from images of them which she had\nbeheld, and she knew that they were none else than the divine Maeonides,\nthe Avernian Dante, the more than mortal Shakespeare, the\nchaos-exploring Milton, the cosmic Goethe, and the Musaean Keats. These\nwere those messengers whom the Gods had sent to tell men that Pan had\npassed not away, but only slept; for it is in poetry that Gods speak to\nmen. Then spake the Thunderer:\n\n\"O daughter, for, being one of my endless line, thou art indeed my\ndaughter, behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers that\nGods have sent down, that in the words and the writings of men there may\nstill be some trace of divine beauty. Other bards have men justly\ncrowned with enduring laurels, but these hath Apollo crowned, and these\nhave I set in places apart, as mortals who have spoken the language of\nthe Gods. Long have we dreamed in lotos-gardens beyond the West, and\nspoken only through our dreams; but the time approaches when our voices\nshall not be silent. It is a time of awaking and of change. Once more\nhath Phaeton ridden low, searing the fields and drying the streams. In\nGaul lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no\nmore, and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals. Ares\nand his train have gone forth with the madness of Gods, and have\nreturned, Deimos and Phobos glutted with unnatural delight. Tellus moans\nwith grief, and the faces of men are as the faces of the Erinyes, even\nas when Astraea fled to the skies, and the waves of our bidding\nencompassed all the land saving this high peak alone. Amidst this chaos,\nprepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival, even now\ntoileth our latest-born messenger, in whose dreams are all the images\nwhich other messengers have dreamed before him. He it is that we have\nchosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the world\nhath known before, and to write words wherein shall echo all the wisdom\nand the loveliness of the past. He it is who shall proclaim our return,\nand sing of the days to come when Fauns and Dryads shall haunt their\naccustomed groves in beauty. Guided was our choice by those who now sit\nbefore the Corycian grotto on thrones of ivory, and in whose songs thou\nshalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shall know the\ngreater messenger when he cometh. Attend their voices as one by one they\nsing to thee here. Each note shalt thou hear again in the poetry which\nis to come; the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy soul,\nthough search for it through bleak years thou must. Attend with\ndiligence, for each chord that vibrates away into hiding shall appear\nagain to thee after thou hast returned to earth, as Alpheus, sinking his\nwaters into the soil of Hellas, appears as the crystal Arethusa in\nremote Sicilia.\"\n\nThen arose Homeros, the ancient among bards, who took his lyre and\nchaunted his hymn to Aphrodite. No word of Greek did Marcia know, yet\ndid the message fall not vainly upon her ears; for in the cryptic rhythm\nwas that which spake to all mortals and Gods, and needed no interpreter.\n\nSo too the songs of Dante and Goethe, whose unknown words clave the\nether with melodies easy to read and to adore. But at last remembered\naccents rebounded before the listener. It was the Swan of Avon, once a\nGod among men, and still a God among Gods:\n\n    \"Write, write, that from the bloody course of war,\n    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie;\n    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far,\n    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.\"\n\nAccents still more familiar arose as Milton, blind no more, declaimed\nimmortal harmony:\n\n    \"Or let my lamp at midnight hour\n    Be seen in some high lonely tower,\n    Where I might oft outwatch the Bear\n    With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere\n    The spirit of Plato, to unfold\n    What worlds or what vast regions hold\n    Th' immortal mind, that hath forsook\n    Her mansion in this fleshy nook.\n              \u00b7       \u00b7       \u00b7\n    Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy\n    In sceptred pall come sweeping by,\n    Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,\n    Or the tale of Troy divine.\"\n\nLast of all came the young voice of Keats, closest of all the messengers\nto the beauteous faun-folk.\n\n    \"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\n    Are sweeter: therefore, ye soft pipes, play on....\n              \u00b7       \u00b7       \u00b7\n    When old age shall this generation waste,\n    Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\n    Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,\n    'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'--that is all\n    Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\n\nAs the singer ceased, there came a sound in the wind blowing from far\nEgypt, where at night Aurora mourns by the Nile for her slain son\nMemnon. To the feet of the Thunderer flew the rosy-fingered Goddess, and\nkneeling, cried, \"Master, it is time I unlocked the gates of the East.\"\nAnd Phoebus, handing his lyre to Calliope, his bride among the Muses,\nprepared to depart for the jewelled and column-raised Palace of the Sun,\nwhere fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of day. So\nZeus descended from his carven throne and placed his hand upon the head\nof Marcia, saying:\n\n\"Daughter, the dawn is nigh, and it is well that thou shouldst return\nbefore the awaking of mortals to thy home. Weep not at the bleakness of\nthy life, for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone, and the Gods\nshall once more walk among men. Search thou unceasingly for our\nmessenger, for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort. By his word\nshall thy steps be guided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty\nshall thy spirit find all that it craveth.\" As Zeus ceased, the young\nHermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading stars;\nup, and westward over unseen seas.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nMany years have passed since Marcia dreamt of the Gods and of their\nParnassian conclave. Tonight she sits in the same spacious drawing-room,\nbut she is not alone. Gone is the old spirit of unrest, for beside her\nis one whose name is luminous with celebrity; the young poet of poets at\nwhose feet sits all the world. He is reading from a manuscript words\nwhich none has ever heard before, but which when heard will bring to men\nthe dreams and fancies they lost so many centuries ago, when Pan lay\ndown to doze in Arcady, and the greater Gods withdrew to sleep in\nlotos-gardens beyond the lands of the Hesperides. In the subtle cadences\nand hidden melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden has found rest\nat last, for there echo the divinest notes of Thracian Orpheus; notes\nthat moved the very rocks and trees by Hebrus' banks. The singer ceases,\nand with eagerness asks a verdict, yet what can Marcia say but that the\nstrain is \"fit for the Gods\"?\n\nAnd as she speaks there comes again a vision of Parnassus and the\nfar-off sound of a mighty voice saying, \"By his word shall thy steps be\nguided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find\nall that it craveth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Paul J. Campbell deserves the most unstinted thanks of the United\nthis year, for besides serving as First Vice-President he has furnished\nfree of charge a supply of recruiting booklets and application blanks,\nthus relieving us of one of our most onerous burdens. Mr. Campbell's\neighteen years of undiminished devotion to amateurdom form a thing\nworthy of emulation.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    NOVEMBER 1920\n\n\nNyarlathotep\n\nH. P. LOVECRAFT\n\nNyarlathotep ... the crawling chaos ... I am the last ... I will tell\nthe audient void....\n\nI do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The\ngeneral tension was horrible. To a season of political and social\nupheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous\nphysical danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as\nmay be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night. I\nrecall that the people went about with pale and worried faces, and\nwhispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat\nor acknowledge to himself that he had heard. A sense of monstrous guilt\nwas upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill\ncurrents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a\ndemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons--the autumn heat\nlingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the\nuniverse had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of\ngods or forces which were unknown.\n\nAnd it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none\ncould tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a\nPharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He\nsaid he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and\nthat he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the\nlands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister,\nalways buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them\ninto instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences--of\nelectricity and psychology--and gave exhibitions of power which sent his\nspectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding\nmagnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered.\nAnd where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were\nrent with the screams of nightmare. Never before had the screams of\nnightmare been such a public problem; now the wise men almost wished\nthey could forbid sleep in the small hours, that the shrieks of cities\nmight less horribly disturb the pale, pitying moon as it glimmered on\ngreen waters gliding under bridges, and old steeples crumbling against a\nsickly sky.\n\nI remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city--the great, the old, the\nterrible city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of\nthe impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I\nburned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said\nthey were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings;\nthat what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things\nnone but Nyarlathotep dare prophesy, and that in the sputter of his\nsparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before\nyet which shewed only in the eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad that\nthose who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not.\n\nIt was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless\ncrowds to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the\nendless stairs into the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw\nhooded forms amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from behind\nfallen monuments. And I saw the world battling against blackness;\nagainst the waves of destruction from ultimate space; whirling,\nchurning; struggling around the dimming, cooling sun. Then the sparks\nplayed amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and hair stood up\non end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came out and\nsquatted on the heads. And when I, who was colder and more scientific\nthan the rest, mumbled a trembling protest about \"imposture\" and \"static\nelectricity,\" Nyarlathotep drave us all out, down the dizzy stairs into\nthe damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was\n_not_ afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others screamed with me\nfor solace. We sware to one another that the city _was_ exactly the\nsame, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we\ncursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces\nwe made.\n\nI believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when\nwe began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary\nmarching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared\nnot think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks\nloose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to show\nwhere the tramways had run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone,\nwindowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side. When we gazed around\nthe horizon, we could not find the third tower by the river, and noticed\nthat the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top. Then we\nsplit up into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a different\ndirection. One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only\nthe echo of a shocking moan. Another filed down a weed-choked subway\nentrance, howling with a laughter that was mad. My own column was sucked\ntoward the open country, and presently felt a chill which was not of the\nhot autumn: for as we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us\nthe hellish moon-glitter of evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows,\nswept asunder in one direction only, where lay a gulf all the blacker\nfor its glittering walls. The column seemed very thin indeed as it\nplodded dreamily into the gulf. I lingered behind, for the black rift in\nthe green-litten snow was frightful, and I thought I had heard the\nreverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished; but my\npower to linger was slight. As if beckoned by those who had gone before,\nI half-floated between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid,\ninto the sightless vortex of the unimaginable.\n\nScreamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can\ntell. A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands,\nand whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses\nof dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the\npallid stars and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts\nof monstrous things; half-seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest\non nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the\nspheres of light and darkness. And through this revolving graveyard of\nthe universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin,\nmonotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted\nchambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance\nslowly, awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate\ngods--the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is\nNyarlathotep.\n\n\nEditorial\n\nEditorial comment upon amateur journalism generally falls within one of\ntwo classes; complacent self-congratulation upon a mythical perfection,\nor hectic urging toward impossible achievements. It is our purpose this\nmonth to indulge in neither of these rhetorical recreations, but to make\none very prosaic and practical appeal which springs solely from\nrealistic observation.\n\nThis appeal concerns the official situation in the United. For several\nyears our foes have reproached us for excessive centralisation of\nauthority: asserting that the control of our society is anything from\noligarchical to monarchial, and pointing to the large amount of\ninfluence wielded by a very few leaders. Denials on our part, prompted\nby the conspicuous absence of any dictatorial ambitions in the minds of\nour executives, have been largely nullified by the fact that while power\nhas not been autocratically usurped and arbitrarily exercised, the\nburden of administrative work has certainly been thrust by common\nconsent on a small number of reluctant though loyal shoulders. A few\npersons have been forced to retain authority because no others have\narisen to relieve them of their burdens, until official nominations have\ncome to mean no more than a campaign by one or two active spirits to\npersuade certain patient drudges to \"carry on\" another year. Nor does\nthe formal official situation reflect all of the prevailing condition.\nMuch of the Association's most important activity, such as recruiting,\nwelcoming and criticism, verges into the field of unorganised effort;\nand here the tendency to leave everything to a narrow group is\noverwhelming.\n\nObviously, this condition demands a remedy; and that remedy lies in one\ndirection only--an acceptance of potential official responsibility by\nall of those members who possess the time and experience to act as\nleaders. As the fiscal year progresses, the season for candidacies draws\nnear; and amateurs who feel competent to sustain their share of the\nadministrative burden should come forward as nominees, or at least\nshould respond when approached by their friends. That office-holding\ninvolves tedious work, all admit, but this tedium is a small enough\nprice to pay for the varied boons of amateurdom. In unofficial labour an\nequal willingness should be shown. Why is it that all the private\nrevision in the United is performed by about three men at most, despite\nthe presence in our ranks of a full score of scholars abundantly capable\nof rendering such service? If the _literati_ as a whole will not awaken\nto the needs of the day, one of two things will occur. The United will\nstagnate quietly under the perpetual dictatorship of a limited group of\nunwilling but benevolent autocrats, or it will succumb to the onslaught\nof some political clique of vigorous barbarians who will destroy in a\nmonth what it has taken the United over ten years to build up. Memories\nof 1919 should prove to us the reality of such a danger of sudden\nrelapse.\n\nOur appeal, then, is for responsible candidates for high office, and for\nvolunteers in the work of maintaining interest and lending literary aid.\nWe know that executive energy and enthusiasm tend to be more abundant in\nthe Goth than in the Greek; that those best qualified to serve are\ngenerally least moved by political ambition. But we are sure that the\nneeds of our society should arouse enough sense of duty among its\ncultivated membership to draw to the front a new generation of leaders.\nWe ask for new presidential and editorial candidates who are prepared to\nserve faithfully and independently if elected; for new critics and\nrecruiters who understand our traditions and are willing to expend\nenergy in upholding and diffusing them. Shall 1921 bring them to light?\n\n                                                     --H. P.

LOVECRAFT\n\nIn these days of unrestrained license in poetry, it would at first sight\nseem difficult to single out any one bard as the possessor of ideas and\nmodes of expression so unique and original that the overworked adjective\n\"different\" is merited. Every poetaster of the modern school claims to\nbe \"different,\" and bases his claim to celebrity upon this \"difference\";\nan effect usually achieved by the adoption of a harsh, amorphous style,\nand a tone of analytical, introspective subjectivity so individual that\nall the common and universal elements of beauty and poetry are excluded.\nIndeed, eccentricity has come so completely into fashion, that he who\nfollows up the wildest vagaries is actually the least different from the\nhectic scribbling throng about him.\n\nBut notwithstanding this malady of the times, there does remain among us\nan ample field for genius and artistic distinctiveness. The laws of\nhuman thought are unchangeable, and whenever there is born a soul\nattuned to real harmony, and inspired by that rare sensitiveness which\nenables it to feel and express the latent beauty and hidden\nrelationships of Nature, the world receives a new poet. Such an one will\nof necessity break through the decadent customs of the period; and\nfalling back to the forms of true melody, sing a spontaneous song which\ncan not help being original, because it represents the unforced reaction\nof a keen and delicate mind to the panorama of life. And when this\nreaction is enabled to bring out in the simplest and most beautiful\nstyle fancies and images which the world has not received or noted\nbefore, we are justified in claiming that the bard is \"different.\"\n\nSuch a bard is Winifred Virginia Jackson, whose poetry has for six years\nbeen the pride of the United Amateur Press Association. Born in Maine,\nand through childhood accustomed to the mystical spell of the ancient\nNew-England countryside, Miss Jackson for a long period quietly and\nunconsciously absorbed a prodigious store of beauty and phantasy from\nlife. Having no design to become a poet, she accepted these ethereal\ngifts as a matter of course; until about a decade ago they manifested\nthemselves in a burst of spontaneous melody which can best be described\nas a sheer overflowing of delightful dreams and pictures from a mind\nfilled to the brim with poetic loveliness. Since that time Miss Jackson\nhas written vast quantities of verse; always rich and musical, and if\none may speak in paradox, always artless with supreme art. None of these\npoems is in any sense premeditated or consciously composed; they are\nmore like visions of the fancy, instantaneously photographed for the\nperception of others, and unerringly framed in the most appropriate\nmetrical medium.\n\nWhen we peruse the poetry of Miss Jackson we are impressed first by its\namazing variety, and almost as quickly by a certain distinctive quality\nwhich gives all the varied specimens a kind of homogeneity. As we\nanalyse our impressions, we find that both of these qualities have a\ncommon source--the complete objectivity and almost magical imagination\nof supreme genius. Objectivity and imagination, the gifts of the epic\nbards of classical antiquity, are today the rarest of blessings. We live\nin an age of morbid emotion and introspectiveness; wherein the poets,\nsuch as they are, have sunk to the level of mere pathologists engaged in\nthe dissection of their own ultra-sophisticated spirits. The fresh touch\nof Nature is lost to the majority, and rhymesters rant endlessly and\nrealistically about the relation of man to his fellows and to himself;\noverlooking the real foundations of art and beauty--wonder, and man's\nrelation to the unknown cosmos. But Miss Jackson is not of the majority,\nand has not overlooked these things. In her the ancient and unspoiled\nbard is refulgently reincarnated; and with an amazing universality and\nfreedom from self-consciousness she suppresses the ego completely,\ndelineating Nature's diverse moods and aspects with an impersonal\nfidelity and delicacy which form the delight of the discriminating\nreader, and the despair of the stupid critic who works by rule and\nformula rather than by brain. There is no medium which the spirit of\nMiss Jackson can not inhabit. The same mind which reflects the daintiest\nand most gorgeous phantasies of the faery world, or furnishes the most\nfinely wrought pictures or refined pathos and sentiment, can abruptly\ntake up its abode in some remote Maine timber region and pour out such a\nwild, virile chantey of the woods and the river that we seem to glimpse\nthe singer as the huskiest of a tangle-bearded, fight-scarred,\nloud-shouting logging crew sprawling about a pine campfire.\n\nA critic has grouped the poetical work of Miss Jackson into six classes:\nLyrics of ideal beauty, including delightful Nature-poems replete with\nlocal colour; delicate amatory lyrics; rural dialect lyrics and vigorous\ncolloquial pieces; poems of sparkling optimism; child verse; and poems\nof potent terror and dark suggestion. \"With her,\" he adds, \"sordid\nrealism has no place; and her poems glow with a subtle touch of the\nfanciful and the supernatural which is well sustained by tasteful and\nunusual word-combinations, images, and onomatopoetic effects.\" This\nestimate is confirmed by the latest productions of the poetess, as we\nshall endeavour to show by certain specimens lately published or about\nto be published, selected almost at random:\n\n\"The Bonnet\" is a characteristic bit of Jacksonian delicacy and\noriginality. We here behold a sustained metaphor of that striking type\nwhich the author so frequently creates; a metaphor which draws on all\nNature and the unseen world for its basis, and whose analogies are just\nthe ones which please us most, yet which our own minds are never finely\nattuned enough to conceive unaided. The swain in the poem tells of his\nintention to make a bonnet for his chosen nymph to wear. He will fashion\nit with \"golden thimble, scissors, needle, thread\"; taking velvet from\nthe April sky as a groundwork, stars for trimming, moonlight for\nbanding, and a web of dreams for lining. He will scent it with the\nperfume of \"the reddest rose that the singing wind finds sweetest where\nit farthest blows,\" and \"will take it at the twilight for his love to\nwear.\" Here we have nothing of the bizarre or the conspicuous, yet in\nthe six little stanzas of quaintly regular metre there is suggested all\nof that world of faery beauty which the eye can glimpse beyond the\nleaden clouds of reality; a world which exists because it can be dreamed\nof. The poem is \"different\" in the truest way; it is original because it\nconveys beauty originally in an inconspicuous and harmonious vehicle.\n\nBut turn now to \"Ellsworth to Great Pond\" and marvel! True, we still\nfind the vivid delineation of human feelings, but what a distance we\nhave travelled! Gone is the young dreamer with his world of moonshine,\nfor here roars the Maine lumberjack with all the uncouth vigour and rude\nnatural expressiveness of the living satyr. It is life; primal,\nuncovered, and unpolished--the ebullient, shouting vitality of healthy\nanimalism.\n\n    \"Drink hard cider, swig hard cider,\n      Swill hard cider, Boys!\n    Throw yer spikers, throw yer peavies,\n      Beller out yer noise!\"\n\nWe have drifted from the aether of Keats to the earth of Fielding, yet\nunder the guidance of the same author. Greater proof of Miss Jackson's\nabsolute objectivity and marvellous imagination could not be produced or\nasked.\n\nYet who shall say that the Jackson pendulum is powerful only at the\nextremes of its sweeping arc? In \"Workin' Out\" we discover a pastoral\nlove-lyric which for quaintness and graphic humanness could not well be\nsurpassed. Here the distinctive and spontaneous inventiveness of Miss\nJackson's fancy is displayed with especial vividness. The rural youth,\n\"workin' out\" far from his loved Molly, enumerates the prosaic chores he\ncan perform with easy heart; but mentions in each case some more poetic\nthing which stirs his emotions and gives him loneliness for the absent\nfair. He can cut and husk corn, but the golden-rod reminds him of his\nMolly's golden hair. He can milk cows, but the gentian reminds him of\nhis Molly's blue eyes. Aside from their intrinsic ingeniousness, these\nimages possess an unconscious lesson for the poet who can read it. They\nexpose with concrete illustrations the fallacy of the so-called \"new\npoetry,\" which disregards the natural division between beautiful and\nunbeautiful things and rhapsodises as effusively over a sewer-pipe as\nover the crescent moon.\n\n\"The Token\" exhibits Miss Jackson in her airiest lyrical mood; a mood\noriginal because it possesses the rare lyrism of pure music and fancy\nrather than the common lyrism of unsubtilised emotion. There is bounding\nmusic in thought and medium alike, whilst the naive plunge into the\ntheme without introduction or explanation is a stroke savouring of the\nsimplicity of genius. Equally effective is the simple metrical\ntransition whereby the chorus assumes the trochaic measure of a\nchildhood chant or carol:\n\n    \"Lightly O, brightly O,\n      Down the long lane she will go!\n    Dancing she, glancing she,\n      Down the lane with eyes aglow!\"\n\nIn \"Assurance\" and \"It's Lovetime,\" the author displays a lyrical\nfervour of more conventional type; adding the touch of originality by\nmeans of melodious simplicity and reiteration in the one case, and pure\nlyric ecstasy in the other.\n\nThe metrical originality of Miss Jackson, displayed in all classes of\nher work, should not be slighted amidst the enthusiasm one entertains\nfor her magical mastery of thoughts and images. No other conservative\npoet of the period is more versatile and individual in choice of\nnumbers, or in adaptation of measure to mood. \"Driftwood,\" a wonderfully\noriginal poem of imagination describing the fancies which arise from the\nsmoke of logs wafted from far mysterious lands where once the trees grew\nunder strange suns, moons, and rainbows, is as remarkable in form as in\nidea. One may judge by a sample pair of stanzas:\n\n    \"You warm your hands\n      And smile\n    Before the fire of driftwood.\n\n    \"I feel old lands'\n      Wan guile\n    That writhes in fire of driftwood.\"\n\nWe have so far viewed poetry which would lead us to classify Miss\nJackson as a delineator of moods rather than of character; yet knowing\nher versatility, we naturally expect to find among her works some potent\ncharacter studies. Nor are we disappointed. \"Joe,\" a song of the Maine\nwoods, describes in admirably appropriate verbiage--as simple and as\nnearly monosyllabic as possible--the typical Anglo-Saxon stoic of far\nplaces, who faces comfort and disaster, life and death, with the same\nunemotional attitude which Miss Jackson sums up so skilfully in the one\nejaculatory bit of colloquial indifference--\"Dunno!\"\n\n\"The Song of Jonny Laughlin\" is a highly unusual ballad relating the\nhistory of a peculiarly good and self-sacrificing river character. The\nstory is simple, but the piece gains distinctiveness from its absolutely\nfaithful reproduction of the spirit of frontier balladry. In words,\nswing, and weird refrain, there exists every internal evidence of\ntraditional authenticity; and that such a bit of Nature could be\ncomposed by a cultivated feminine author is an overwhelming testimonial\nto Miss Jackson's unique gifts.\n\nThat Miss Jackson can reflect the spirit of the most dissimilar\ncharacters is further proved by the two immensely powerful studies of\nthe vagabond type entitled \"The Call\" and \"John Worthington Speaks.\"\nThese things are masterpieces of their kind; the self-revealing\nnarratives of restless wanderers by land and sea, crammed to repletion\nwith details and local colour which no one but their author could\ncommand without actual experience as a derelict of five continents and\nas many oceans. They leave the reader veritably breathless with wonder\nat the objectivity and imagination which can enable a New-England\npoetess to mirror with such compelling vividness in thought and language\nthe sentiments of so utterly opposite a type. Not even the narrowly\nspecialised genius of such rough-and-ready writers as Service and\nKnibbs, working in their own peculiar field, can surpass this one slight\nphase of Miss Jackson's universal genius.\n\nIt remains to speak of the singular power of Miss Jackson in the realm\nof the gruesome and the terrible. With that same sensitiveness to the\nunseen and the unreal which lends witchery to her gayer productions, she\nhas achieved in darker fields of verse results inviting comparison with\nthe best prose work of Ambrose Bierce or Maurice Level. Among her older\npoems the ghastly and colourful phantasy \"Insomnia\" and the grimly\nrealistic rustic tragedy \"Chores\" excited especial praise, a critic\nreferring as follows to the latter piece:\n\n    \"It has all the compelling power which marks Miss Jackson's darker\n    productions, and is conveyed in an arresting staccato measure which\n    emphasises the homely horror of the theme. The phraseology, with its\n    large proportion of rural and archaic words and constructions, adds\n    vastly to the general effect and atmosphere.\"\n\nThis reference to Miss Jackson's unusual vocabulary deserves\nelaboration, for one of the secrets of her effective poetry is the wide\nand diverse array of words and word-combinations which she commands.\nRecondite archaisms and ruralisms, together with marvellously apt and\noriginal descriptive compounds, are things which perpetually astonish\nand delight her readers. Of recent specimens of Miss Jackson's darker\nverse, \"Finality,\" \"The Song\" and \"Fallen Fences\" deserve especial\npraise. The horrible picture conjured up in the closing lines of the\nfirst named piece is one well calculated to haunt the dreams of the\nimaginative.\n\nAs we conclude this survey of rich and varied poetry, our dominant\nimpression aside from admiration is that of wonder at the tardiness with\nwhich the author has been recognised by the non-amateur public. As yet\nthe name of Jackson is a comparative novelty to the literary world, a\nthing explainable only by the reluctance of its possessor to adopt that\nspecies of trumpeting which helps less modest and less genuine poets\ninto the glare of celebrity. But genius such as Miss Jackson's can not\nremain forever hidden, however slight be her striving for fame; so that\nwe may reasonably expect the next few years to witness her establishment\namong the leading literary figures, as one of the ablest, broadest and\nmost original of contemporary bards.\n\n\nEx Oblivione\n\nWARD PHILLIPS\n\nWhen the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began\nto drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let\nfall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim's body, I loved the\nirradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I\nhad vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and\nenchanted woods.\n\nOnce when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and\nsailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.\n\nOnce when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream\nunder the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight,\niridescent arbours and undying roses.\n\nAnd once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and\nruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced\nby a little gate of bronze.\n\nMany times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I\npause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and\ntwisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to\ntrunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples.\nAnd always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with\nthe little gate of bronze therein.\n\nAfter a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from\ntheir greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through\nthe valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for\nmy eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull\nworld stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the\nlittle gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a\ndream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.\n\nSo each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in\nthe ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well-hidden. And I\nwould tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting\nmerely, but more lovely and radiant as well.\n\nThen one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus\nfilled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city,\nand who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were\nwritten many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was\nlore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall\npierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it\ntouched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the\nyellowed papyrus.\n\nSome of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the\nirrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew\nnot which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the\nunknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new\nhorror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace.\nSo when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me\nthrough, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.\n\nLast night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden\nvalley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique\nwall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a\nglow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and tops of the buried\ntemples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the\nland from whence I should never return.\n\nBut as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me\nthrough, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that\nnew realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled\nand illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hope to be, I\ndissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which\nthe daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.\n\n\nOFFICIAL ORGAN FUND\n\nProvidence, R.

A prostrating and overwhelming flood of\nprofessional duties, coupled with a state of health permitting only the\nshortest of working hours, has forced the editor to delay transmission\nof this copy to the publisher until November 4: a date which should be\nremembered in justice to the latter official, who is equally handicapped\nin the matter of conflicting duties.\n\n                                                            THE EDITOR\n\n\nEditorial\n\nIn the excellent October _Woodbee_, Mr. Leo Fritter criticises with much\nforce the attempt of the present editor to conduct THE UNITED AMATEUR on\na tolerably civilised plane. He points out that the appearance of a\njournal representing a fairly uniform maturity of thought and artistic\ndevelopment may perhaps tend to discourage those newer aspirants who\nhave not yet attained their full literary stature, and thus defeat the\neducational ends of the Association.\n\nMr. Fritter gathers his material for complaint from the opinions of\ncertain amateurs with whom he has held communication, and on this basis\nalleges a \"wide-spreading dissatisfaction\" with the present editorial\npolicy. We have ourselves received numerous and enthusiastic assurances\nof an opposite nature, especially since the Fritter attack, so that we\nmust rebut at least his charge that we are ignoring the membership's\nwishes and \"trying to conform them to a mould we have arbitrarily cast\naccording to ideas of our own.\" To adopt a lower standard would, indeed,\nbe affronting a more influential element than that which may at present\nbe dissatisfied; an element which has possibly gained higher claims to\nconsideration through the _continuous_ nature of its services to the\nAssociation during trying times when others were silent and inactive.\n\nBut in determining the question of editorial policy, the abstract merits\nof the case are more important than the act of pleasing this or that\nperson or group. Were we convinced that the existing order hampered the\nsincere novice, we would abandon it without pride or ceremony. That we\ndo not, is because we are certain that retrogression and decadence would\nconstitute a fatal mistake. The public we serve is assumed to be a\ngenuinely progressive one, a group bent upon attaining some measure of\nproficiency in that sincere self-expression which is art. If it were\nnot, it would have joined some other association of different\npurposes--the defiantly crude Erford pseudo-United or the complacently\nsocial and stationary National. What justifies the separate existence\nand support of the United is its higher aesthetic and intellectual cast;\nits demand for the unqualified best as a goal--which demand, by the way,\nmust not be construed as discriminating against even the crudest\nbeginner who honestly cherishes that goal. With these objects in mind,\nit will be seen that the self-satisfied exultation of the superficial,\nthe obvious, the commonplace, and the conventional, would form the\ngreatest possible tactical error. The goal would be unjustifiably\nobscured, and the aspiration of the membership stunted, through the\nenshrining of a false and inferior goal--a literary Golden Calf. We must\nenvisage a genuine scale of values, and possess a model of genuine\nexcellence toward which to strive. It would pay better to work toward a\nhigh standard oneself, than to seek to drag the standard down to fit\nwhatever particular grade of ignorance one may happen to have at a given\nmoment. With proper effort any member may eventually produce work of the\nUNITED AMATEUR grade, and such work will be certain of a cordial welcome\nin this office. The official organ is not so narrow as it seems; if more\nof our capable members would favour it with their literary\ncontributions, the range of authors represented would not be so\nrestricted. It is not the editor but the body of our _literati_ who must\nbear responsibility for the constant reappearance of certain names. This\nissue is headed by the same poet who headed the last two--but only\nbecause another eminent amateur, so far unrepresented during the present\nregime, utterly ignored our repeated requests for a contribution.\n\nMr. Fritter--who, I fear, wrongs etymology in his acceptance of the word\n_amateur_ as meaning a tyro rather than a genuine and disinterested\nartist--forgets that a relapse to cruder standards would totally unfit\nthe United for serving that staunch element which has contributed most\nto its present welfare. Many would find a society of the lower grade\nintolerable; certainly it could not hope to hold the very ones who have\ngiven this organization its existing distinctiveness and pre-eminence.\n\nYet in the arguments of Mr. Fritter there is an underlying soundness\nwhich misapplication should not obscure to the analytical reader. He is\nright in lamenting, as we believe he does, the absence of a suitable\npublishing medium for the work of our younger writers. It is not in a\nspirit of affront to him that we give preference to the plan of\nPresident Haughton, as outlined in her opening message, for the\nre-establishment of a special magazine for credentials. We should be\nglad to curtail the official organ in the interest of such a magazine,\nas indeed we offered to do at the beginning of the term.\n\n_Frustra laborat_, says the old proverb, _qui omnibus placere studet_.\nWe regret that any one policy must of necessity displease a few members,\nyet do not see how any improvement could be effected by making a change\nwhich would merely shift the displeasure to another and even more\ncontinuously industrious group. It is significant that the Gothic party\nhave no editorial candidate of their own to offer, so that the thankless\nand toilsome office has been forced upon one whose indifferent health\nmakes it an almost unbearable burden to him. The question is one which\nshould ultimately be decided at the polls, each party putting forward a\nnominee who can be depended upon to fulfil its mandates. Meanwhile the\npresent editor, whose sincere beliefs and policies were fully known long\nbefore his unopposed election, stands ready to resign most cheerfully\nwhenever a suitable successor can be found. Bitterness, division and\npersonalities must be avoided at any cost, and we may be reckoned as a\nsupporter of THE UNITED AMATEUR under any editor and policy.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    NOVEMBER 1921\n\n\n            THE UNITED AMATEUR\n\n              Official Organ\n                  of the\n     UNITED AMATEUR PRESS ASSOCIATION\n\n H.

P. LOVECRAFT         _Official Editor_\n E. EDWARD ERICSON    _Official Publisher_\n\nIssued bi-monthly by the United Amateur Press Association.\n\nSubscription Price, 50 cents per year.\n\nPublished at Elroy, Wisconsin.\n\nEntered as second-class mail matter at the post office at Elroy, Wis.\n\n\nEditorial\n\nAmidst the prevailing efforts of a small but pugnacious group to \"liven\"\nup the United through attacks on the Official Organ, a few basic\nprinciples should be remembered by those who stand in bewilderment.\n\nOur constitution does not define the functions of THE UNITED AMATEUR\nbeyond making imperative the publication of certain official documents.\nThe rest is left to an unwritten combination of tradition and editorial\njudgment. Any editor, once elected, is absolutely in control of the\nmagazine aside from the essential official matter; his only external\nobligation being a tacit recognition of the prevailing objects of the\nAssociation. In the present case a narrow circle of agitators seems to\nbe seeking political capital by accusing the editor of placing too high\nan estimate on the membership and purposes of the United.\n\nSince the whole development of the Association is involved in this\nmatter, it is important that a prompt and perfect understanding be\nreached. The opinions of all members should be known, and if the editor\nfinds that he has been in error, he will be glad to arrange for the\naccommodation of the Organ to the wishes of the majority. Up to the\npresent time, despite the florid overstatements of the few who are\ntrying to work up a new and wholly artificial dissatisfaction, this\noffice has received _not so much as one complaint_ as to policy save\nfrom the two politicians who are seeking to lower the United's\nstandards. Endorsements as to the existing policy have been many, and as\nlong as these remain so tremendously in the Majority, it would be a\nbetrayal of trust to make a change to please a tiny group. If there are\nthose who differ, why do they not speak?\n\nSince truth is the only perfect clarifier when politics seeks to\nbecloud, it is necessary that the editor state his policy here and now\nwith the utmost candour. Shorn of all irrelevant things, that policy is\nsimply the maintenance of those standards established in the United by\nthe departure of the chronically political element in 1912. Prior to\nthat time the Official Organ was mainly a bulletin of reports: not, as\nthe present agitators would imply, a repository for indiscriminate\namateur writings. The standard developed since then is the creation of\nno one person, but a logical outgrowth of the rising calibre of a vital\nand progressive society. It is neither one of favouritism nor one of\nautocracy; but merely one of _stimulation_. It is an embodiment of the\nUnited's desire to let the Official Organ exemplify the members'\nprogress by using the best available material. No genuine aspirant has\never been frowned upon, or so far as we know given any ground for\ndiscouragement. The Organ is a beckoner and encourager, designed to\ninspire the members to renewed efforts to produce work worthy of\nsymbolising the United. Would anyone so far insult the Association as to\nwish its official exponent to cater to that type of mediocrity which\nneither improves nor wishes to improve? Our columns are open to all who\ntoil for the fruits of art, and statements to the contrary cannot be\ninterpreted as other than irresponsibly ignorant or craftily\nmisrepresentative. While insistence on a certain degree of merit is of\ncourse necessary, it is not true that THE UNITED AMATEUR makes any\narbitrary restrictions. The Organ was not designed for the publication\nof various members' work, nor is access to its columns one of the\nspecial objects of membership, as certain agitators are artfully\nintimating. But notwithstanding those technical points, all proficient\nwriters are welcome. It is illuminating, in view of the prevalent loose\nstatements, to reflect that throughout the present editor's service _not\nmore than three manuscripts have been rejected_; and that even these\nthree were or will be elsewhere placed. Those seeking an Associational\ndisturbance will not scruple to take advantage of every outward\nappearance which seems to favour them--unavoidable delays, spatial\nlimitations, and other things interfering with prompt publication of all\nmatter offered to this office. The present editor will be denounced as a\n\"tyrant\" by elements attempting to degrade standards which he did not\nestablish!\n\nThe life and well-being of the United are at stake, and it is imperative\nthat the membership exercise the most careful and independent reflection\nbefore accepting the views of radicals bent on retrogressive\nexperiments.\n\n\n\n\n THE UNITED AMATEUR    MARCH 1922\n\n\nOFFICIAL ORGAN FUND\n\nProvidence, R.

It is like a fairy dwelling, a gnomic palace built of\nthe aether of dreams. It is tiny and delicate and lovely, and replete\nwith memories of sere leaves in November and of lilies in April. It is a\ncastle of vanished hopes, of dimly-remembered dreams, of sad memories\nolder than the deluge. The dead years circle slowly and solemnly around\nits low white walls, and clothe it in a mystic veil of unseen tears. And\nmany marvellous stories could this quaint little old house tell, many\nweird and cryptic stories of him of the Raven hair, and high, pallid\nbrow, and sad, sweet face, and melancholy mien; and of the beloved\nVirginia, that sweet child of a thousand magic visions, child of the\nlonesome, pale-gray latter years, child of the soft and happy South. And\nhow the dreamer of the spheres must have loved this strange little\nhouse. Every night the hollow boards of its porch must have echoed to\nhis footfall, and every morn the great rising sun must have sent its\nrays through the little window, and bathed the lovely tresses of the\ndream-child in mystical yellow. And perhaps there was laughter within\nthe walls of that house--laughter and merriment and singing. But we know\nthat the Evil One came at last, the grim humourless spectre who loves\nnot beauty, and is not of this world. And we know that the house of\nyouth and of love became a house of death, and that memories bitter as\nthe tears of a beautiful woman assailed the dreamer within. And at last\nhe himself left that house of mourning and sought solace among the\nstars. But the house remains a vision out of a magical book; a thing\nseen darkly as in a looking-glass; but lovely beyond the dreams of\nmortals, and ineffably sad.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Notes:\n\nMinor typographical errors have been corrected without note.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
