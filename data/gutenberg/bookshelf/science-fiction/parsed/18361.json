The cab flew at two thousand feet, where\nlighted buildings seemed to soar toward it from the canyons which were\nstreets. There were lights and people everywhere, and Cochrane\nsardonically reminded himself that he was no better than anybody else,\nonly he'd been trying to keep from realizing it. He looked down at the\ntrees and shrubbery on the roof-tops, and at a dance that was going on\natop one of the tallest buildings. All roofs were recreation-spaces\nnowadays. They were the only spaces available. When you looked down at a\ncity like this, you had cynical thoughts. Fourteen million people in\nthis city. Ten million in that. Eight in another and ten in another\nstill, and twelve million in yet another ... Big cities. Swarming\nmillions of people, all desperately anxious--so Cochrane realized\nbitterly--all desperately anxious about their jobs and keeping them.\n\n\"Even as me and I,\" said Cochrane harshly to himself. \"Sure! I'm shaking\nin my shoes right along with the rest of them!\"\n\nBut it hurt to realize that he'd been kidding himself. He'd thought he\nwas important. Important, at least, to the advertising firm of Kursten,\nKasten, Hopkins and Fallowe. But right now he was on the way--like a\ncommon legman--to take the moon-rocket to Lunar City, and he'd been\ninformed of it just thirty minutes ago. Then he'd been told casually to\nget to the rocket-port right away. His secretary and two technical men\nand a writer were taking the same rocket. He'd get his instructions from\nDr. William Holden on the way.\n\nA part of his mind said indignantly, \"_Wait till I get Hopkins on the\nphone! It was a mixup! He wouldn't send me off anywhere with the\nDikkipatti Hour depending on me! He's not that crazy!_\" But he was on\nhis way to the space-port, regardless. He'd raged when the message\nreached him. He'd insisted that he had to talk to Hopkins in person\nbefore he obeyed any such instructions. But he was on his way to the\nspace-port. He was riding in a helicab, and he was making adjustments in\nhis own mind to the humiliation he unconsciously foresaw. There were\nreally three levels of thought in his mind. One had adopted a defensive\ncynicism, and one desperately insisted that he couldn't be as\nunimportant as his instructions implied, and the third watched the other\ntwo as the helicab flew with cushioned booming noises over the dark\ncanyons of the city and the innumerable lonely lights of the rooftops.\n\nThere was a thin roaring sound, high aloft. Cochrane jerked his head\nback. The stars filled all the firmament, but he knew what to look for.\nHe stared upward.\n\nOne of the stars grew brighter. He didn't know when he first picked it\nout, but he knew when he'd found it. He fixed his eyes on it. It was a\nvery white star, and for a space of minutes it seemed in no wise\ndifferent from its fellows. But it grew brighter. Presently it was very\nbright. It was brighter than Sirius. In seconds more it was brighter\nthan Venus. It increased more and more rapidly in its brilliance. It\nbecame the brightest object in all the heavens except the crescent moon,\nand the cold intensity of its light was greater than any part of that.\nThen Cochrane could see that this star was not quite round. He could\ndetect the quarter-mile-long flame of the rocket-blast.\n\nIt came down with a rush. He saw the vertical, stabbing pencil of light\nplunge earthward. It slowed remarkably as it plunged, with all the\nflying aircraft above the city harshly lighted by its glare. The\nspace-port itself showed clearly. Cochrane saw the buildings, and the\nother moon-rockets waiting to take off in half an hour or less.\n\nThe white flame hit the ground and splashed. It spread out in a wide\nflat disk of intolerable brightness. The sleek hull of the ship which\nstill rode the flame down glinted vividly as it settled into the inferno\nof its own making.\n\nThen the light went out. The glare cut off abruptly. There was only a\ndim redness where the space-port tarmac had been made incandescent for a\nlittle while. That glow faded--and Cochrane became aware of the\nenormous stillness. He had not really noticed the rocket's deafening\nroar until it ended.\n\nThe helicab flew onward almost silently, with only the throbbing pulses\nof its overhead vanes making any sound at all.\n\n\"_I kidded myself about those rockets, too_,\" said Cochrane bitterly to\nhimself. \"_I thought getting to the moon meant starting to the stars.\nNew worlds to live on. I had a lot more fun before I found out the facts\nof life!_\"\n\nBut he knew that this cynicism and this bitterness came out of the hurt\nto the vanity that still insisted everything was a mistake. He'd\nreceived orders which disillusioned him about his importance to the firm\nand to the business to which he'd given years of his life. It hurt to\nfind out that he was just another man, just another expendable. Most\npeople fought against making the discovery, and some succeeded in\navoiding it. But Cochrane saw his own self-deceptions with a savage\nclarity even as he tried to keep them. He did not admire himself at all.\n\nThe helicab began to slant down toward the space-port buildings. The sky\nwas full of stars. The earth--of course--was covered with buildings.\nExcept for the space-port there was no unoccupied ground for thirty\nmiles in any direction. The cab was down to a thousand feet. To five\nhundred. Cochrane saw the just-arrived rocket with tender-vehicles\nrunning busily to and fro and hovering around it. He saw the rocket he\nshould take, standing upright on the faintly lighted field.\n\nThe cab touched ground. Cochrane stood up and paid the fare. He got out\nand the cab rose four or five feet and flitted over to the waiting-line.\n\nHe went into the space-port building. He felt himself growing more\nbitter still. Then he found Bill Holden--Doctor William Holden--standing\ndejectedly against a wall.\n\n\"I believe you've got some orders for me, Bill,\" said Cochrane\nsardonically. \"And just what psychiatric help can I give you?\"\n\nHolden said tiredly:\n\n\"I don't like this any better than you do, Jed. I'm scared to death of\nspace-travel. But go get your ticket and I'll tell you about it on the\nway up. It's a special production job. I'm roped in on it too.\"\n\n\"Happy holiday!\" said Cochrane, because Holden looked about as miserable\nas a man could look.\n\nHe went to the ticket desk. He gave his name. On request, he produced\nidentification. Then he said sourly:\n\n\"While you're working on this I'll make a phone-call.\"\n\nHe went to a pay visiphone. And again there were different levels of\nawareness in his mind--one consciously and defensively cynical, and one\nfrightened at the revelation of his unimportance, and the third finding\nthe others an unedifying spectacle.\n\nHe put the call through with an over-elaborate confidence which he\nangrily recognized as an attempt to deceive himself. He got the office.\nHe said calmly:\n\n\"This is Jed Cochrane. I asked for a visiphone contact with Mr.\nHopkins.\"\n\nHe had a secretary on the phone-screen. She looked at memos and said\npleasantly:\n\n\"Oh, yes. Mr. Hopkins is at dinner. He said he couldn't be disturbed,\nbut for you to go on to the moon according to your instructions, Mr.\nCochrane.\"\n\nCochrane hung up and raged, with one part of his mind. Another part--and\nhe despised it--began to argue that after all, he had better wait before\nthinking there was any intent to humiliate him. After all, his orders\nmust have been issued with due consideration. The third part disliked\nthe other two parts intensely--one for raging without daring to speak,\nand one for trying to find alibis for not even raging. He went back to\nthe ticket-desk. The clerk said heartily:\n\n\"Here you are! The rest of your party's already on board, Mr. Cochrane.\nYou'd better hurry! Take-off's in five minutes.\"\n\nHolden joined him. They went through the gate and got into the\ntender-vehicle that would rush them out to the rocket. Holden said\nheavily:\n\n\"I was waiting for you and hoping you wouldn't come. I'm not a good\ntraveller, Jed.\"\n\nThe small vehicle rushed. To a city man, the dark expanse of the\nspace-port was astounding. Then a spidery metal framework swallowed the\ntender-truck, and them. The vehicle stopped. An elevator accepted them\nand lifted an indefinite distance through the night, toward the stars. A\nsort of gangplank with a canvas siderail reached out across emptiness.\nCochrane crossed it, and found himself at the bottom of a spiral ramp\ninside the rocket's passenger-compartment. A stewardess looked at the\ntickets. She led the way up, and stopped.\n\n\"This is your seat, Mr. Cochrane,\" she said professionally. \"I'll strap\nyou in this first time. You'll do it later.\"\n\nCochrane lay down in a contour-chair with an eight-inch mattress of foam\nrubber. The stewardess adjusted straps. He thought bitter, ironic\nthoughts. A voice said:\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane!\"\n\nHe turned his head. There was Babs Deane, his secretary, with her eyes\nvery bright. She regarded him from a contour-chair exactly opposite his.\nShe said happily:\n\n\"Mr. West and Mr. Jamison are the science men, Mr. Cochrane. I got Mr.\nBell as the writer.\"\n\n\"A great triumph!\" Cochrane told her. \"Did you get any idea what all\nthis is about? Why we're going up?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Babs cheerfully. \"I haven't the least idea. But I'm going\nto the moon! It's the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me!\"\n\nCochrane shrugged his shoulders. Shrugging was not comfortable in the\nstraps that held him. Babs was a good secretary. She was the only one\nCochrane had ever had who did not try to make use of her position as\nsecretary to the producer of the Dikkipatti Hour on television. Other\nsecretaries had used their nearness to him to wangle acting or dancing\nor singing assignments on other and lesser shows. As a rule they lasted\njust four public appearances before they were back at desks, spoiled for\nfurther secretarial use by their taste of fame. But Babs hadn't tried\nthat. Yet she'd jumped at a chance for a trip to the moon.\n\nA panel up toward the nose of the rocket--the upper end of this\npassenger compartment--glowed suddenly. Flaming red letters said,\n\"_Take-off, ninety seconds._\"\n\nCochrane found an ironic flavor in the thought that splendid daring and\nincredible technology had made his coming journey possible. Heroes had\nventured magnificently into the emptiness beyond Earth's atmosphere.\nUncountable millions of dollars had been spent. Enormous intelligence\nand infinite pains had been devoted to making possible a journey of two\nhundred thirty-six thousand miles through sheer nothingness. This was\nthe most splendid achievement of human science--the reaching of a\nsatellite of Earth and the building of a human city there.\n\nAnd for what? Undoubtedly so that one Jed Cochrane could be ordered by\ntelephone, by somebody's secretary, to go and get on a passenger-rocket\nand get to the moon. Go--having failed to make a protest because his\nboss wouldn't interrupt dinner to listen--so he could keep his job by\nobeying. For this splendid purpose, scientists had labored and dedicated\nmen had risked their lives.\n\nOf course, Cochrane reminded himself with conscious justice, of course\nthere was the very great value of moon-mail cachets to devotees of\nphilately. There was the value of the tourist facilities to anybody who\ncould spend that much money for something to brag about afterward. There\nwere the solar-heat mines--running at a slight loss--and various other\nfine achievements. There was even a nightclub in Lunar City where one\nhighball cost the equivalent of--say--a week's pay for a secretary like\nBabs. And--\n\nThe panel changed its red glowing sign. It said: \"_Take-off forty-five\nseconds._\"\n\nSomewhere down below a door closed with a cushioned soft definiteness.\nThe inside of the rocket suddenly seemed extraordinarily still. The\nsilence was oppressive. It was dead. Then there came the whirring of\nvery many electric fans, stirring up the air.\n\nThe stewardess' voice came matter-of-factly from below him in the\nupended cylinder which was the passenger-space.\n\n\"We take off in forty-five seconds. You will find yourself feeling very\nheavy. There is no cause to be alarmed. If you observe that breathing is\noppressive, the oxygen content of the air in this ship is well above\nearth-level, and you will not need to breathe so deeply. Simply relax in\nyour chair. Everything has been thought of. Everything has been tested\nrepeatedly. You need not disturb yourself at all. Simply relax.\"\n\nSilence. Two heart-beats. Three.\n\nThere was a roar. It was a deep, booming, numbing roar that came from\nsomewhere outside the rocket's hull. Simultaneously, something thrust\nCochrane deep into the foam-cushions of his contour-chair. He felt the\ncushion piling up on all sides of his body so that it literally\nsurrounded him. It resisted the tendency of his arms and legs and\nabdomen to flatten out and flow sidewise, to spread him in a thin layer\nover the chair in which he rested.\n\nHe felt his cheeks dragged back. He was unduly conscious of the weight\nof objects in his pockets. His stomach pressed hard against his\nbackbone. His sensations were those of someone being struck a hard,\nprolonged blow all over his body.\n\nIt was so startling a sensation, though he'd read about it, that he\nsimply stayed still and blankly submitted to it. Presently he felt\nhimself gasp. Presently, again, he noticed that one of his feet was\ngoing to sleep. He tried to move it and succeeded only in stirring it\nfeebly. The roaring went on and on and on....\n\nThe red letters in the panel said: \"_First stage ends in five seconds._\"\n\nBy the time he'd read it, the rocket hiccoughed and stopped. Then he\nfelt a surge of panic. He was falling! He had no weight! It was the\nsensation of a suddenly dropping elevator a hundred times multiplied. He\nbounced out of the depression in the foam-cushion. He was prevented from\nfloating away only by the straps that held him.\n\nThere was a sputter and a series of jerks. Then he had weight again as\nroarings began once more. This was not the ghastly continued impact of\nthe take-off, but still it was weight--considerably greater weight than\nthe normal weight of Earth. Cochrane wiggled the foot that had gone to\nsleep. Pins and needles lessened their annoyance as sensation returned\nto it. He was able to move his arms and hands. They felt abnormally\nheavy, and he experienced an extreme and intolerable weariness. He\nwanted to go to sleep.\n\nThis was the second-stage rocket-phase. The moon-rocket had blasted off\nat six gravities acceleration until clear of atmosphere and a little\nmore. Acceleration-chairs of remarkably effective design, plus the\npre-saturation of one's blood with oxygen, made so high an acceleration\nsafe and not unendurable for the necessary length of time it lasted.\nNow, at three gravities, one did not feel on the receiving end of a\nviolent thrust, but one did feel utterly worn out and spent. Most people\nstayed awake through the six-gravity stage and went heavily to sleep\nunder three gravities.\n\nCochrane fought the sensation of fatigue. He had not liked himself for\naccepting the orders that had brought him here. They had been issued in\nbland confidence that he had no personal affairs which could not be\nabandoned to obey cryptic orders from the secretary of a boss he had\nactually never seen. He felt a sort of self-contempt which it would have\nbeen restful to forget in three-gravity sleep. But he grimaced and held\nhimself awake to contemplate the unpretty spectacle of himself and his\nactions.\n\nThe red light said: \"_Second stage ends ten seconds._\"\n\nAnd in ten seconds the rockets hiccoughed once more and were silent, and\nthere was that sickening feeling of free fall, but he grimly made\nhimself think of it as soaring upward instead of dropping--which was the\nfact, too--and waited until the third-stage rockets boomed suddenly and\nwent on and on and on.\n\nThis was nearly normal acceleration; the effect of this acceleration was\nthe feel of nearly normal weight. He felt about as one would feel in\nEarth in a contour-chair tilted back so that one faced the ceiling. He\nknew approximately where the ship would be by this time, and it ought to\nhave been a thrill. Cochrane was hundreds of miles above Earth and\nheaded eastward out and up. If a port were open at this height, his\nglance should span continents.\n\nNo.... The ship had taken off at night. It would still be in Earth's\nshadow. There would be nothing at all to be seen below, unless one or\ntwo small patches of misty light which would be Earth's too-many great\ncities. But overhead there would be stars by myriads and myriads, of\nevery possible color and degree of brightness. They would crowd each\nother for room in which to shine. The rocket-ship was spiralling out and\nout and up and up, to keep its rendezvous with the space platform.\n\nThe platform, of course, was that artificial satellite of Earth which\nwas four thousand miles out and went around the planet in a little over\nfour hours, traveling from west to east. It had been made because to\nbreak the bonds of Earth's gravity was terribly costly in fuel--when a\nship had to accelerate slowly to avoid harm to human cargo. The space\nplatform was a filling station in emptiness, at which the moon-rocket\nwould refuel for its next and longer and much less difficult journey of\ntwo hundred thirty-odd thousand miles.\n\nThe stewardess came up the ramp, moving briskly. She stopped and glanced\nat each passenger in each chair in turn. When Cochrane turned his open\neyes upon her, she said soothingly:\n\n\"There's no need to be disturbed. Everything is going perfectly.\"\n\n\"I'm not disturbed,\" said Cochrane. \"I'm not even nervous. I'm perfectly\nall right.\"\n\n\"But you should be drowsy!\" she observed, concerned. \"Most people are.\nIf you nap you'll feel better for it.\"\n\nShe felt his pulse in a businesslike manner. It was normal.\n\n\"Take my nap for me,\" said Cochrane, \"or put it back in stock. I don't\nwant it. I'm perfectly all right.\"\n\nShe considered him carefully. She was remarkably pretty. But her manner\nwas strictly detached. She said:\n\n\"There's a button. You can reach it if you need anything. You may call\nme by pushing it.\"\n\nHe shrugged. He lay still as she went on to inspect the other\npassengers. There was nothing to do and nothing to see. Travellers were\ntreated pretty much like parcels, these days. Travel, like television\nentertainment and most of the other facilities of human life, was\ndesigned for the seventy-to-ninety-per-cent of the human race whose\nlikes and dislikes and predilections could be learned exactly by\nsurveys. Anybody who didn't like what everybody liked, or didn't react\nlike everybody reacted, was subject to annoyances. Cochrane resigned\nhimself to them.\n\nThe red light-letters changed again, considerably later. This time they\nsaid: \"_Free flight, thirty seconds._\"\n\nThey did not say \"free fall,\" which was the technical term for a rocket\ncoasting upward or downward in space. But Cochrane braced himself, and\nhis stomach-muscles were tense when the rockets stopped again and stayed\noff. The sensation of continuous fall began. An electronic speaker\nbeside his chair began to speak. There were other such mechanisms beside\neach other passenger-chair, and the interior of the rocket filled with a\nsoft murmur which was sardonically like choral recitation.\n\n\"_The sensation of weightlessness you now experience_,\" said the voice\nsoothingly, \"_is natural at this stage of your flight. The ship has\nattained its maximum intended speed and is still rising to meet the\nspace platform. You may consider that we have left atmosphere and its\nlimitations behind. Now we have spread sails of inertia and glide on a\nwind of pure momentum toward our destination. The feeling of\nweightlessness is perfectly normal. You will be greatly interested in\nthe space platform. We will reach it in something over two hours of free\nflight. It is an artificial satellite, with an air-lock our ship will\nenter for refueling. You will be able to leave the ship and move about\ninside the Platform, to lunch if you choose, to buy souvenirs and mail\nthem back and to view Earth from a height of four thousand miles through\nquartz-glass windows. Then, as now, you will feel no sensation of\nweight. You will be taken on a tour of the space platform if you wish.\nThere are rest-rooms--._\"\n\nCochrane grimly endured the rest of the taped lecture. He thought sourly\nto himself: \"_I'm a captive audience without even an interest in the\nproduction tricks._\"\n\nPresently he saw Bill Holden's head. The psychiatrist had squirmed\ninside the straps that held him, and now was staring about within the\nrocket. His complexion was greenish.\n\n\"I understand you're to brief me,\" Cochrane told him, \"on the way up. Do\nyou want to tell me now what all this is about? I'd like a nice dramatic\nnarrative, with gestures.\"\n\nHolden said sickly:\n\n\"Go to hell, won't you?\"\n\nHis head disappeared. Space-nausea was, of course, as definite an\nailment as seasickness. It came from no weight. But Cochrane seemed to\nbe immune. He turned his mind to the possible purposes of his journey.\nHe knew nothing at all. His own personal share in the activities of\nKursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe--the biggest advertising agency in\nthe world--was the production of the Dikkipatti Hour, top-talent\ntelevision show, regularly every Wednesday night between eight-thirty\nand nine-thirty o'clock central U. S. time. It was a good show. It was\namong the ten most popular shows on three continents. It was not\nreasonable that he be ordered to drop it and take orders from a\npsychiatrist, even one he'd known unprofessionally for years. But there\nwas not much, these days, that really made sense.\n\nIn a world where cities with populations of less than five millions were\nconsidered small towns, values were peculiar. One of the deplorable\nresults of living in a world over-supplied with inhabitants was that\nthere were too many people and not enough jobs. When one had a good job,\nand somebody higher up than oneself gave an order, it was obeyed. There\nwas always somebody else or several somebodies waiting for every job\nthere was--hoping for it, maybe praying for it. And if a good job was\nlost, one had to start all over.\n\nThis task might be anything. It was not, however, connected in any way\nwith the weekly production of the Dikkipatti Hour. And if that\nproduction were scamped this week because Cochrane was away, he would be\nthe one to take the loss in reputation. The fact that he was on the moon\nwouldn't count. It would be assumed that he was slipping. And a slip was\nnot good. It was definitely not good!\n\n\"_I could do a documentary right now_,\" Cochrane told himself angrily,\n\"_titled 'Man-afraid-of-his-job.' I could make a very authentic\nproduction. I've got the material!_\"\n\nHe felt weight for a moment. It was accompanied by booming noises. The\nsounds were not in the air outside, because there was no air. They were\nreverberations of the rocket-motors themselves, transmitted to the\nfabric of the ship. The ship's steering-rockets were correcting the\ncourse of the vessel and--yes, there was another surge of power--nudging\nit to a more correct line of flight to meet the space platform coming up\nfrom behind. The platform went around the world six times a day, four\nthousand miles out. During three of its revolutions anybody on the\nground, anywhere, could spot it in daylight as an infinitesimal star,\nbright enough to be seen against the sky's blueness, rising in the west\nand floating eastward to set at the place of sunrise.\n\nThere was again weightlessness. A rocket-ship doesn't burn its\nrocket-engines all the time. It runs them to get started, and it runs\nthem to stop, but it does not run them to travel. This ship was floating\nabove the Earth, which might be a vast sunlit ball filling half the\nuniverse below the rocket, or might be a blackness as of the Pit.\nCochrane had lost track of time, but not of the shattering effect of\nbeing snatched from the job he knew and thought important, to travel\nincredibly to do something he had no idea of. He felt, in his mind, like\nsomebody who climbs stairs in the dark and tries to take a step that\nisn't there. It was a shock to find that his work wasn't important even\nin the eyes of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe. That he didn't\ncount. That nothing counted ...\n\nThere was another dull booming outside and another touch of weight. Then\nthe rocket floated on endlessly.\n\nA long time later, something touched the ship's outer hull. It was a\ndefinite, positive clanking sound. And then there was the gentlest and\nvaguest of tuggings, and Cochrane could feel the ship being maneuvered.\nHe knew it had made contact with the space platform and was being drawn\ninside its lock.\n\nThere was still no weight. The stewardess began to unstrap the\npassengers one by one, supplying each with magnetic-soled slippers.\nCochrane heard her giving instructions in their use. He knew the\nair-lock was being filled with air from the huge, globular platform. In\ntime the door at the back--bottom--base of the passenger-compartment\nopened. Somebody said flatly:\n\n\"Space platform! The ship will be in this air-lock for some three hours\nplus for refueling. Warning will be given before departure. Passengers\nhave the freedom of the platform and will be given every possible\nprivilege.\"\n\nThe magnetic-soled slippers did hold one's feet to the spiral ramp, but\none had to hold on to a hand-rail to make progress. On the way down to\nthe exit door, Cochrane encountered Babs. She said breathlessly:\n\n\"I can't believe I'm really here!\"\n\n\"I can believe it,\" said Cochrane, \"without even liking it particularly.\nBabs, who told you to come on this trip? Where'd all the orders come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Mr. Hopkins' secretary,\" said Babs happily. \"She didn't tell me to\ncome. I managed that! She said for me to name two science men and two\nwriters who could work with you. I told her one writer was more than\nenough for any production job, but you'd need me. I assumed it was a\nproduction job. So she changed the orders and here I am!\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Cochrane. His sense of the ironic deepened. He'd thought he\nwas an executive and reasonably important. But somebody higher up than\nhe was had disposed of him with absent-minded finality, and that man's\nsecretary and his own had determined all the details, and he didn't\ncount at all. He was a pawn in the hands of firm-partners and assorted\nsecretaries. \"Let me know what my job's to be and how to do it, Babs.\"\n\nBabs nodded. She didn't catch the sarcasm. But she couldn't think very\nstraight, just now. She was on the space platform, which was the second\nmost glamorous spot in the universe. The most glamorous spot, of course,\nwas the moon.\n\nCochrane hobbled ashore into the platform, having no weight whatever. He\nwas able to move only by the curious sticky adhesion of his\nmagnetic-soled slippers to the steel floor-plates beneath him. Or--were\nthey beneath? There was a crew member walking upside down on a floor\nwhich ought to be a ceiling directly over Cochrane's head. He opened a\ndoor in a side-wall and went in, still upside down. Cochrane felt a\nsudden dizziness, at that.\n\nBut he went on, using hand-grips. Then he saw Dr. William Holden looking\ngreenish and ill and trying sickishly to answer questions from West and\nJamison and Bell, who had been plucked from their private lives just as\nCochrane had and were now clamorously demanding of Bill Holden that he\nexplain what had happened to them.\n\nCochrane snapped angrily:\n\n\"Leave the man alone! He's space-sick! If you get him too much upset\nthis place will be a mess!\"\n\nHolden closed his eyes and said gratefully:\n\n\"Shoo them away, Jed, and then come back.\"\n\nCochrane waved his hands at them. They went away, stumbling and holding\non to each other in the eerie dream-likeness and nightmarish situation\nof no-weight-whatever. There were other passengers from the moon-rocket\nin this great central space of the platform. There was a fat woman\nlooking indignantly at the picture of a weighing-scale painted on the\nwall. Somebody had painted it, with a dial-hand pointing to zero pounds.\nA sign said, \"_Honest weight, no gravity._\" There was the stewardess\nfrom the rocket, off duty here. She smoked a cigarette in the blast of\nan electric fan. There was a party of moon-tourists giggling foolishly\nand clutching at everything and buying souvenirs to mail back to Earth.\n\n\"All right, Bill,\" said Cochrane. \"They're gone. Now tell me why all the\nnot inconsiderable genius in the employ of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and\nFallowe, in my person, has been mobilized and sent up to the moon?\"\n\nBill Holden swallowed. He stood up with his eyes closed, holding onto a\nside-rail in the great central room of the platform.\n\n\"I have to keep my eyes shut,\" he explained, queasily. \"It makes me ill\nto see people walking on side-walls and across ceilings.\"\n\nA stout tourist was doing exactly that at the moment. If one could walk\nanywhere at all with magnetic-soled shoes, one could walk everywhere.\nThe stout man did walk up the side-wall. He adventured onto the ceiling,\nwhere he was head-down to the balance of his party. He stood there\nlooking up--down--at them, and he wore a peculiarly astonished and\nhalf-frightened and wholly foolish grin. His wife squealed for him to\ncome down: that she couldn't bear looking at him so.\n\n\"All right,\" said Cochrane. \"You're keeping your eyes closed. But I'm\nsupposed to take orders from you. What sort of orders are you going to\ngive?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet,\" said Holden thinly. \"We are sent up here on a\nprivate job for Hopkins--one of your bosses. Hopkins has a daughter.\nShe's married to a man named Dabney. He's neurotic. He's made a great\nscientific discovery and it isn't properly appreciated. So you and I and\nyour team of tame scientists--we're on our way to the Moon to save his\nreason.\"\n\n\"Why save his reason?\" asked Cochrane cynically. \"If it makes him happy\nto be a crackpot--\"\n\n\"It doesn't,\" said Holden, with his eyes still closed. He gulped. \"Your\njob and a large part of my practice depends on keeping him out of a\nlooney-bin. It amounts to a public-relations job, a production, with me\nmerely censoring aspects that might be bad for Dabney's psyche.\nOtherwise he'll be frustrated.\"\n\n\"Aren't we all?\" demanded Cochrane. \"Who in hades does he think he is?\nMost of us want appreciation, but we have to be glad when we do our work\nand get paid for it! We--\"\n\nThen he swore bitterly. He had been taken off the job he'd spent years\nlearning to do acceptably, to phoney a personal satisfaction for the\nson-in-law of one of the partners of the firm he worked for. It was\nhumiliation to be considered merely a lackey who could be ordered to\nperform personal services for his boss, without regard to the damage to\nthe work he was really responsible for. It was even more humiliating to\nknow he had to do it because he couldn't afford not to.\n\nBabs appeared, obviously gloating over the mere fact that she was\nwalking in magnetic-soled slippers on the steel decks of the space\nplatform. Her eyes were very bright. She said:\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane, hadn't you better come look at Earth out of the quartz\nEarthside windows?\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Cochrane bitterly. \"If it wasn't that I'd have to hold\nonto something with both hands, in order to do it, I'd be kicking\nmyself. Why should I want to do tourist stuff?\"\n\n\"So,\" said Babs, \"so later on you can tell when a writer or a scenic\ndesigner tries to put something over on you in a space platform show.\"\n\nCochrane grimaced.\n\n\"In theory, I should. But do you realize what all this is about? I just\nlearned!\" When Babs shook her head he said sardonically, \"We are on the\nway to the Moon to stage a private production out of sheer cruelty.\nWe're hired to rob a happy man of the luxury of feeling sorry for\nhimself. We're under Holden's orders to cure a man of being a crackpot!\"\n\nBabs hardly listened. She was too much filled with the zest of being\nwhere she'd never dared hope to be able to go.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be cured of being a crackpot,\" protested Cochrane,\n\"if only I could afford such a luxury! I'd--\"\n\nBabs said urgently:\n\n\"You'll have to hurry, really! They told me it starts in ten minutes, so\nI came to find you right away.\"\n\n\"What starts?\"\n\n\"We're in eclipse now,\" explained Babs, starry-eyed. \"We're in the\nEarth's shadow. In about five minutes we'll be coming out into sunlight\nagain, and we'll see the new Earth!\"\n\n\"Guarantee that it will be a new Earth,\" Cochrane said morosely, \"and\nI'll come. I didn't do too well on the old one.\"\n\nBut he followed her in all the embarrassment of walking on\nmagnetic-soled shoes in a total absence of effective gravity. It was\nquite a job simply to start off. Without precaution, if he merely tried\nto march away from where he was, his feet would walk out from under him\nand he'd be left lying on his back in mid-air. Again, to stop without\nputting one foot out ahead for a prop would mean that after his feet\npaused, his body would continue onward and he would achieve a\nfull-length face-down flop. And besides, one could not walk with a\nregular up-and-down motion, or in seconds he would find his feet\nchurning emptiness in complete futility.\n\nCochrane tried to walk, and then irritably took a hand-rail and hauled\nhimself along it, with his legs trailing behind him like the tail of a\nswimming mermaid. He thought of the simile and was not impressed by his\nown dignity.\n\nPresently Babs halted herself in what was plainly a metal blister in the\nouter skin of the platform. There was a round quartz window, showing the\ninside of steel-plate windows beyond it. Babs pushed a button marked\n\"_Shutter_,\" and the valves of steel drew back.\n\nCochrane blinked, lifted even out of his irritableness by the sight\nbefore him.\n\nHe saw the immensity of the heavens, studded with innumerable stars.\nSome were brighter than others, and they were of every imaginable color.\nTiny glintings of lurid tint--through the Earth's atmosphere they would\nblend into an indefinite faint luminosity--appeared so close together\nthat there seemed no possible interval. However tiny the appearance of a\ngap, one had but to look at it for an instant to perceive infinitesimal\nflecks of colored fire there, also.\n\nEach tiniest glimmering was a sun. But that was not what made Cochrane\ncatch his breath.\n\nThere was a monstrous space of nothingness immediately before his eyes.\nIt was round and vast and near. It was black with the utter blackness of\nthe Pit. It was Earth, seen from its eight-thousand-mile-wide shadow,\nunlighted even by the Moon. There was no faintest relief from its\nabsolute darkness. It was as if, in the midst of the splendor of the\nheavens, there was a chasm through which one glimpsed the unthinkable\nnothing from which creation was called in the beginning. Until one\nrealized that this was simply the dark side of Earth, the spectacle was\none of hair-raising horror.\n\nAfter a moment Cochrane said with a carefully steadied voice:\n\n\"My most disparaging opinions of Earth were never as black as this!\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Babs confidently.\n\nCochrane waited. He had to hold carefully in his mind that this visible\nabyss, this enormity of purest dark, was not an opening into nothingness\nbut was simply Earth at night as seen from space.\n\nThen he saw a faint, faint arch of color forming at its edge. It spread\nswiftly. Immediately, it seemed, there was a pinkish glowing line among\nthe multitudinous stars. It was red. It was very, very bright. It became\na complete half-circle. It was the light of the sun refracted around the\nedge of the world.\n\nWithin minutes--it seemed in seconds--the line of light was a glory\namong the stars. And then, very swiftly, the blazing orb which was the\nsun appeared from behind Earth. It was intolerably bright, but it did\nnot brighten the firmament. It swam among all the myriads of myriads of\nsuns, burning luridly and in a terrible silence, with visibly writhing\nprominences rising from the edge of its disk. Cochrane squinted at it\nwith light-dazzled eyes.\n\nThen Babs cried softly:\n\n\"Beautiful! Oh, beautiful!\"\n\nAnd Cochrane shielded his eyes and saw the world new-born before him.\nThe arc of light became an arch and then a crescent, and swelled even as\nhe looked. Dawn flowed below the space platform, and it seemed that seas\nand continents and clouds and beauty poured over the disk of darkness\nbefore him.\n\nHe stood here, staring, until the steel shutters slowly closed. Babs\nsaid in regret:\n\n\"You have to keep your hand on the button to keep the shutters open.\nElse the window might get pitted with dust.\"\n\nCochrane said cynically:\n\n\"And how much good will it have done me to see that, Babs? How can that\nbe faked in a studio--and how much would a television screen show of\nit?\"\n\nHe turned away. Then he added sourly:\n\n\"You stay and look if you like, Babs. I've already had my vanity smashed\nto little bits. If I look at that again I'll want to weep in pure\nfrustration because I can't do anything even faintly as well worth\nwatching. I prefer to cut down my notions of the cosmos to a tolerable\nsize. But you go ahead and look!\"\n\nHe went back to Holden. Holden was painfully dragging himself back into\nthe rocket-ship. Cochrane went with him. They returned, weightless, to\nthe admirably designed contour-chairs in which they had traveled to this\nplace, and in which they would travel farther. Cochrane settled down to\nstare numbly at the wall above him. He had been humiliated enough by the\nactions of one of the heads of an advertising agency. He found himself\nresenting, even as he experienced, the humbling which had been imposed\nupon him by the cosmos itself.\n\nPresently the other passengers returned, and the moonship was maneuvered\nout of the lock and to emptiness again, and again presently rockets\nroared and there was further feeling of intolerable weight. But it was\nnot as bad as the take-off from Earth.\n\nThere followed some ninety-six hours of pure tedium. After the first\naccelerating blasts, the rockets were silent. There was no weight.\nThere was nothing to hear except the droning murmur of unresting\nelectric fans, stirring the air ceaselessly so that excess moisture from\nbreathing could be extracted by the dehumidifiers. But for them--if the\nair had been left stagnant--the journey would have been insupportable.\n\nThere was nothing to see, because ports opening on outer space were not\nsafe for passengers to look through. Mere humans, untrained to keep\ntheir minds on technical matters, could break down at the spectacle of\nthe universe. There could be no activity.\n\nSome of the passengers took dozy-pills. Cochrane did not. It was against\nthe law for dozy-pills to produce a sensation of euphoria, of\nwell-being. The law considered that pleasure might lead to addiction.\nBut if a pill merely made a person drowsy, so that he dozed for hours\nhalfway between sleeping and awake, no harm appeared to be done. Yet\nthere were plenty of dozy-pill addicts. Many people were not especially\nanxious to feel good. They were quite satisfied not to feel anything at\nall.\n\nCochrane couldn't take that way of escape. He lay strapped in his chair\nand thought unhappily of many things. He came to feel unclean, as people\nused to feel when they traveled for days on end on railroad trains.\nThere was no possibility of a bath. One could not even change clothes,\nbecause baggage went separately to the moon in a robot freight-rocket,\nwhich was faster and cheaper than a passenger transport, but would kill\nanybody who tried to ride it. Fifteen-and twenty-gravity acceleration is\neconomical of fuel, and six-gravity is not, but nobody can live through\na twenty-gravity lift-off from Earth. So passengers stayed in the\nclothes in which they entered the ship, and the only possible concession\nto fastidiousness was the disposable underwear one could get and change\nto in the rest-rooms.\n\nBabs Deane did not take dozy-pills either, but Cochrane knew better than\nto be more than remotely friendly with her outside of office hours. He\ndid not want to give her any excuse to tell him anything for his own\ngood. So he spoke pleasantly and kept company only with his own\nthoughts. But he did notice that she looked rapt and starry-eyed even\nthrough the long and dreary hours of free flight. She was mentally\ntracking the moonship through the void. She'd know when the continents\nof Earth were plain to see, and the tints of vegetation on the two\nhemispheres--northern and southern--and she'd know when Earth's\nice-caps could be seen, and why.\n\nThe stewardess was not too much of a diversion. She was brisk and calm\nand soothing, but she became a trifle reluctant to draw too near the\nchairs in which her passengers rode. Presently Cochrane made deductions\nand maliciously devised a television commercial. In it, a moon-rocket\nstewardess, in uniform and looking fresh and charming, would say sweetly\nthat she went without bathing for days at a time on moon-trips, and did\nnot offend because she used whoosit's antistinkum. And then he thought\npleasurably of the heads that would roll did such a commercial actually\nget on the air.\n\nBut he didn't make plans for the production-job he'd been sent to the\nmoon to do. Psychiatry was specialized, these days, as physical medicine\nhad been before it. An extremely expensive diagnostician had been sent\nto the moon to tap Dabney's reflexes, and he'd gravely diagnosed\nfrustration and suggested young Dr. Holden for the curative treatment.\nFrustration was the typical neurosis of the rich, anyhow, and Bill\nHolden had specialized in its cure. His main reliance was on the making\nof a dramatic production centering about his patient, which was\nexpensive enough and effective enough to have made him a quick\nreputation. But he couldn't tell Cochrane what was required of him. Not\nyet. He knew the disease but not the case. He'd have to see and know\nDabney before he could make use of the extra-special production-crew his\npatient's father-in-law had provided from the staff of Kursten, Kasten,\nHopkins and Fallowe.\n\nNinety-some hours after blast-off from the space platform, the\nrocket-ship turned end for end and began to blast to kill its velocity\ntoward the moon. It began at half-gravity--the red glowing sign gave\nwarning of it--and rose to one gravity and then to two. After days of\nno-weight, two gravities was punishing.\n\nCochrane thought to look at Babs. She was rapt, lost in picturings of\nwhat must be outside the ship, which she could not see. She'd be\nimagining what the television screens had shown often enough, from\nfilm-tapes. The great pock marked face of Luna, with its ring-mountains\nin incredible numbers and complexity, and the vast open \"seas\" which\nwere solidified oceans of lava, would be clear to her mind's eye. She\nwould be imagining the gradual changes of the moon's face with nearness,\nwhen the colorings appear. From a distance all the moon seems tan or\nsandy in tint. When one comes closer, there are tawny reds and\nslate-colors in the mountain-cliffs, and even blues and yellows, and\neverywhere there is the ashy, whitish-tan color of the moondust.\n\nGlancing at her, absorbed in her satisfaction, Cochrane suspected that\nwith only half an excuse she would explain to him how the several\nhundreds of degrees difference in the surface-temperature of the moon\nbetween midnight and noon made rocks split and re-split and fracture so\nthat stuff as fine as talcum powder covered every space not too sharply\ntilted for it to rest on.\n\nThe feeling of deceleration increased. For part of a second they had the\nsensation of three gravities.\n\nThen there was a curious, yielding jar--really very slight--and then the\nfeeling of excess weight ended altogether. But not the feeling of\nweight. They still had weight. It was constant. It was steady. But it\nwas very slight.\n\nThey were on the moon, but Cochrane felt no elation. In the tedious\nhours from the space platform he'd thought too much. He was actually\naware of the humiliations and frustrations most men had to conceal from\nthemselves because they couldn't afford expensive psychiatric\ntreatments. Frustration was the disease of all humanity, these days. And\nthere was nothing that could be done about it. Nothing! It simply wasn't\npossible to rebel, and rebellion is the process by which humiliation and\nfrustration is cured. But one could not rebel against the plain fact\nthat Earth had more people on it than one planet could support.\n\nMerely arriving at the moon did not seem an especially useful\nachievement, either to Cochrane or to humanity at large.\n\nThings looked bad.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\n\nCochrane stood when the stewardess' voice authorized the action. With\nsardonic docility he unfastened his safety-belt and stepped out into the\nspiral, descending aisle. It seemed strange to have weight again, even\nas little as this. Cochrane weighed, on the moon, just one-sixth of what\nhe would weigh on Earth. Here he would tip a spring-scale at just about\ntwenty-seven pounds. By flexing his toes, he could jump. Absurdly, he\ndid. And he rose very slowly, and hovered--feeling singularly\nfoolish--and descended with a vast deliberation. He landed on the ramp\nagain feeling absurd indeed. He saw Babs grinning at him.\n\n\"I think,\" said Cochrane, \"I'll have to take up toe-dancing.\"\n\nShe laughed. Then there were clankings, and something fastened itself\noutside, and after a moment the entrance-door of the moonship opened.\n\nThey went down the ramp to board the moon-jeep, holding onto the\nhand-rail and helping each other. The tourist giggled foolishly. They\nwent out the thick doorway and found themselves in an enclosure very\nmuch like the interior of a rather small submarine. But it did have\nshielded windows--ports--and Babs instantly pulled herself into a seat\nbeside one and feasted her eyes. She saw the jagged peaks nearby and the\ncrenelated ring-mountain wall, miles off to one side, and the smooth\nfrozen lava of the \"sea.\" Across that dusty surface the horizon was\nremarkably near, and Cochrane remembered vaguely that the moon was only\none-fourth the size of Earth, so its horizon would naturally be nearer.\nHe glanced at the stars that shone even through the glass that denatured\nthe sunshine. And then he looked for Holden.\n\nThe psychiatrist looked puffy and sleepy and haggard and disheveled.\nWhen a person does have space-sickness, even a little weight relieves\nthe symptoms, but the consequences last for days.\n\n\"Don't worry!\" he said sourly when he saw Cochrane's eyes upon him. \"I\nwon't waste any time! I'll find my man and get to work at once. Just let\nme get back to Earth....\"\n\nThere were more clankings--the jeep-bus sealing off from the rocket.\nThen the vehicle stirred. The landscape outside began to move.\n\nThey saw Lunar City as they approached it. It was five giant dust-heaps,\nfrom five hundred-odd feet in height down to three. There were airlocks\nat their bases and dust-covered tunnels connecting them, and radar-bowls\nabout their sides. But they were dust-heaps. Which was completely\nreasonable. There is no air on the moon. By day the sun shines down with\nabsolute ferocity. It heats everything as with a furnace-flame. At night\nall heat radiates away to empty space, and the ground-temperature drops\nwell below that of liquid air. So Lunar City was a group of domes which\nwere essentially half-balloons--hemispheres of plastic brought from\nEarth and inflated and covered with dust. With airlocks to permit\nentrance and exit, they were inhabitable. They needed no framework to\nsupport them because there were no stormwinds or earthquakes to put\nstresses on them. They needed neither heating nor cooling equipment.\nThey were buried under forty feet of moon-dust, with vacuum between the\ndust-grains. Lunar City was not beautiful, but human beings could live\nin it.\n\nThe jeep-bus carried them a bare half mile, and they alighted inside a\nlock, and another door and another opened and closed, and they emerged\ninto a scene which no amount of television film-tape could really\nportray.\n\nThe main dome was a thousand feet across and half as high. There were\ngreen plants growing in tubs and pots. And the air was fresh! It smelled\nstrange. There could be no vegetation on the rocket and it seemed new\nand blissful to breathe really freshened air after days of the canned\nvariety. But this freshness made Cochrane realize that he'd feel better\nfor a bath.\n\nHe took a shower in his hotel room. The room was very much like one on\nEarth, except that it had no windows. But the shower was strange. The\nsprays were tiny. Cochrane felt as if he were being sprayed by atomizers\nrather than shower-nozzles until he noticed that water ran off him very\nslowly and realized that a normal shower would have been overwhelming.\nHe scooped up a handful of water and let it drop. It took a full second\nto fall two and a half feet.\n\nIt was unsettling, but fresh clothing from his waiting baggage made him\nfeel better. He went to the lounge of the hotel, and it was not a\nlounge, and the hotel was not a hotel. Everything in the dome was\nindoors in the sense that it was under a globular ceiling fifty stories\nhigh. But everything was also out-doors in the sense of bright light and\ngrowing trees and bushes and shrubs.\n\nHe found Babs freshly garmented and waiting for him. She said in\nbusinesslike tones:\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane, I asked at the desk. Doctor Holden has gone to consult\nMr. Dabney. He asked that we stay within call. I've sent word to Mr.\nWest and Mr. Jamison and Mr. Bell.\"\n\nCochrane approved of her secretarial efficiency.\n\n\"Then we'll sit somewhere and wait. Since this isn't an office, we'll\nfind some refreshment.\"\n\nThey asked for a table and got one near the swimming pool. And Babs wore\nher office manner, all crispness and business, until they were seated.\nBut this swimming pool was not like a pool on Earth. The water was\ndeeply sunk beneath the pool's rim, and great waves surged back and\nforth. The swimmers--.\n\nBabs gasped. A man stood on a board quite thirty feet above the water.\nHe prepared to dive.\n\n\"That's Johnny Simms!\" she said, awed.\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"The playboy,\" said Babs, staring. \"He's a psychopathic personality and\nhis family has millions. They keep him up here out of trouble. He's\nmarried.\"\n\n\"Too bad--if he has millions,\" said Cochrane.\n\n\"I wouldn't marry a man with a psychopathic personality!\" protested\nBabs.\n\n\"Keep away from people in the advertising business, then,\" Cochrane told\nher.\n\nJohnny Simms did not jounce up and down on the diving board to start. He\nsimply leaped upward, and went ceilingward for easily fifteen feet, and\nhung stationary for a full breath, and then began to descend in literal\nslow motion. He fell only two and a half feet the first second, and five\nfeet more the one after, and twelve and a half after that.... It took\nhim over four seconds to drop forty-five feet into the water, and the\nsplash that arose when he struck the surface rose four yards and\nsubsided with a lunatic deliberation.\n\nWatching, Babs could not keep her businesslike demeanor. She was\nbursting with the joyous knowledge that she was on the moon, seeing the\nimpossible and looking at fame.\n\nThey sipped at drinks--but the liquid rose much too swiftly in the\nstraws--and Cochrane reflected that the drink in Babs' glass would cost\nDabney's father-in-law as much as Babs earned in a week back home, and\nhis own was costing no less.\n\nPresently a written note came from Holden:\n\n\"_Jed: send West and Jamison right away to Dabney's lunar laboratory to\nget details of discovery from man named Jones. Get moon-jeep and driver\nfrom hotel. I will want you in an hour.--Bill._\"\n\n\"I'll be back,\" said Cochrane. \"Wait.\"\n\nHe left the table and found West and Jamison in Bell's room, all three\nin conference over a bottle. West and Jamison were Cochrane's scientific\nteam for the yet unformulated task he was to perform. West was the\npopularizing specialist. He could make a television audience believe\nthat it understood all the seven dimensions required for some branches\nof wave-mechanics theory. His explanation did not stick, of course. One\ndidn't remember them. But they were singularly convincing in cultural\nepisodes on television productions. Jamison was the prophecy expert. He\ncould extrapolate anything into anything else, and make you believe that\na one-week drop in the birthdate on Kamchatka was the beginning of a\ntrend that would leave the Earth depopulated in exactly four hundred and\nseventy-three years. They were good men for a television producer to\nhave on call. Now, instructed, they went out to be briefed by somebody\nwho undoubtedly knew more than both of them put together, but whom they\nwould regard with tolerant suspicion.\n\nBell, left behind, said cagily:\n\n\"This script I've got to do, now--Will that laboratory be the set? Where\nis it? In the dome?\"\n\n\"It's not in the dome,\" Cochrane told him. \"West and Jamison took a\nmoon-jeep to get to it. I don't know what the set will be. I don't know\nanything, yet. I'm waiting to be told about the job, myself.\"\n\n\"If I've got to cook up a story-line,\" observed Bell, \"I have to know\nthe set. Who'll act? You know how amateurs can ham up any script! How\nabout a part for Babs? Nice kid!\"\n\nCochrane found himself annoyed, without knowing why.\n\n\"We just have to wait until we know what our job is,\" he said curtly,\nand turned to go.\n\nBell said:\n\n\"One more thing. If you're planning to use a news cameraman up\nhere--don't! I used to be a cameraman before I got crazy and started to\nwrite. Let me do the camera-work. I've got a better idea of using a\ncamera to tell a story now, than--\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" said Cochrane. \"We're not up here to film-tape a show. Our\njob is psychiatry--craziness.\"\n\nTo a self-respecting producer, a psychiatric production would seem\ncraziness. A script-writer might have trouble writing out a\npsychiatrist's prescription, or he might not. But producing it would be\nout of all rationality! No camera, the patient would be the star, and\nmost lines would be ad libbed. Cochrane viewed such a production with\nextreme distaste. But of course, if a man wanted only to be famous, it\nmight be handled as a straight public-relations job. In any case,\nthough, it would amount to flattery in three dimensions and Cochrane\nwould rather have no part in it. But he had to arrange the whole thing.\n\nHe went back to the table and rejoined Babs. She confided that she'd\nbeen talking to Johnny Simms' wife. She was nice! But homesick. Cochrane\nsat down and thought morbid thoughts. Then he realized that he was\nirritated because Babs didn't notice. He finished his drink and ordered\nanother.\n\nHalf an hour later, Holden found them. He had in tow a sad-looking\nyoungish man with a remarkably narrow forehead and an expression of deep\nanxiety. Cochrane winced. A neurotic type if there ever was one!\n\n\"Jed,\" said Holden heartily, \"here's Mr. Dabney. Mr. Dabney, Jed\nCochrane is here as a specialist in public-relations set-ups. He'll take\ncharge of this affair. Your father-in-law sent him up here to see that\nyou are done justice to!\"\n\nDabney seemed to think earnestly before he spoke.\n\n\"It is not for myself,\" he explained in an anxious tone. \"It is my work!\nThat is important! After all, this is a fundamental scientific\ndiscovery! But nobody pays any attention! It is extremely important!\nExtremely! Science itself is held back by the lack of attention paid to\nmy discovery!\"\n\n\"Which,\" Holden assured him, \"is about to be changed. It's a matter of\npublic relations. Jed's a specialist. He'll take over.\"\n\nThe sad-faced young man held up his hand for attention. He thought.\nVisibly. Then he said worriedly:\n\n\"I would take you over to my laboratory, but I promised my wife I would\ncall her in half an hour from now. Johnny Simms' wife just reminded me.\nMy wife is back on Earth. So you will have to go to the laboratory\nwithout me and have Mr. Jones show you the proof of my work. A very\nintelligent man, Jones--in a subordinate way, of course. Yes. I will get\nyou a jeep and you can go there at once, and when you come back you can\ntell me what you plan. But you understand that it is not for myself that\nI want credit! It is my discovery! It is terribly important! It is\nvital! It must not be overlooked!\"\n\nHolden escorted him away, while Cochrane carefully controlled his\nfeatures. After a few moments Holden came back, his face sagging.\n\n\"This your drink, Jed?\" he asked dispiritedly. \"I need it!\" He picked up\nthe glass and emptied it. \"The history of that case would be\ninteresting, if one could really get to the bottom of it! Come along!\"\nHis tone was dreariness itself. \"I've got a jeep waiting for us.\"\n\nBabs stood up, her eyes shining.\n\n\"May I come, Mr. Cochrane?\"\n\nCochrane waved her along. Holden tried to stalk gloomily, but nobody can\nstalk in one-sixth gravity. He reeled, and then depressedly accommodated\nhimself to conditions on the moon.\n\nThere was an airlock with a smaller edition of the moon-jeep that had\nbrought them from the ship to the city. It was a brightly-polished metal\nbody, raised some ten feet off the ground on outrageously large wheels.\nIt was very similar to the straddle-trucks used in lumberyards on Earth.\nIt would straddle boulders in its path. It could go anywhere in spite of\ndust and detritus, and its metal body was air-tight and held air for\nbreathing, even out on the moon's surface.\n\nThey climbed in. There was the sound of pumping, which grew fainter. The\nouter lock-door opened. The moon-jeep rolled outside.\n\nBabs stared with passionate rapture out of a shielded port. There were\nimpossibly jagged stones, preposterously steep cliffs. There had been no\nweather to remove the sharp edge of anything in a hundred million years.\nThe awkward-seeming vehicle trundled over the lava sea toward the\nrampart of mighty mountains towering over Lunar City. It reached a steep\nascent. It climbed. And the way was remarkably rough and the vehicle\nspringless, but it was nevertheless a cushioned ride. A bump cannot be\nharsh in light gravity. The vehicle rode as if on wings.\n\n\"All right,\" said Cochrane. \"Tell me the worst. What's the trouble with\nhim? Is he the result of six generations of keeping the money in the\nfamily? Or is he a freak?\"\n\nHolden groaned a little.\n\n\"He's practically a stock model of a rich young man without brains\nenough for a job in the family firm, and too much money for anything\nelse. Fortunately for his family, he didn't react like Johnny\nSimms--though they're good friends. A hundred years ago, Dabney'd have\ngone in for the arts. But it's hard to fool yourself that way now. Fifty\nyears ago he'd have gone in for left-wing sociology. But we really are\ndoing the best that can be done with too many people and not enough\nworld. So he went in for science. It's non-competitive. Incapacity\ndoesn't show up. But he has stumbled on something. It sounds really\nimportant. It must have been an accident! The only trouble is that it\ndoesn't mean a thing! Yet because he's accomplished more than he ever\nexpected to, he's frustrated because it's not appreciated! What a joke!\"\n\nCochrane said cynically:\n\n\"You paint a dark picture, Bill. Are you trying to make this thing into\na challenge?\"\n\n\"You can't make a man famous for discovering something that doesn't\nmatter,\" said Holden hopelessly. \"And this is that!\"\n\n\"Nothing's impossible to public relations if you spend enough money,\"\nCochrane assured him. \"What's this useless triumph of his?\"\n\nThe jeep bounced over a small cliff and fell gently for half a second\nand rolled on. Babs beamed.\n\n\"He's found,\" said Holden discouragedly, \"a way to send messages faster\nthan light. It's a detour around Einstein's stuff--not denying it, but\nevading it. Right now it takes not quite two seconds for a message to go\nfrom the moon to Earth. That's at the speed of light. Dabney has\nproof--we'll see it--that he can cut that down some ninety-five per\ncent. Only it can't be used for Earth-moon communication, because both\nends have to be in a vacuum. It could be used to the space platform,\nbut--what's the difference? It's a real discovery for which there's no\npossible use. There's no place to send messages to!\"\n\nCochrane's eyes grew bright and hard. There were some three thousand\nmillion suns in the immediate locality of Earth--and more only a\nrelatively short distance way--and it had not mattered to anybody. The\nsituation did not seem likely to change. But--The moon-jeep climbed and\nclimbed. It was a mile above the bay of the lava sea and the dust-heaps\nthat were a city. It looked like ten miles, because of the curve of the\nhorizon. The mountains all about looked like a madman's dream.\n\n\"But he wants appreciation!\" said Holden angrily. \"People on Earth\nalmost trampling on each other for lack of room, and people like me\ntrying to keep them sane when they've every reason for despair--and he\nwants appreciation!\"\n\nCochrane grinned. He whistled softly.\n\n\"Never underestimate a genius, Bill,\" he said kindly. \"I refer modestly\nto myself. In two weeks your patient--I'll guarantee it--will be\nacclaimed the hope, the blessing, the greatest man in all the history of\nhumanity! It'll be phoney, of course, but we'll have Marilyn\nWinters--Little Aphrodite herself--making passes at him in hopes of a\npublicity break! It's a natural!\"\n\n\"How'll you do it?\" demanded Holden.\n\nThe moon-jeep turned in its crazy, bumping progress. A flat area had\nbeen blasted in rock which had been unchanged since the beginning of\ntime. Here there was a human structure. Typically, it was a dust-heap\nleaning against a cliff. There was an airlock and another jeep waited\noutside, and there were eccentric metal devices on the flat space,\nshielded from direct sunshine and with cables running to them from the\nairlock door.\n\n\"How?\" repeated Cochrane. \"I'll get the details here. Let's go! How do\nwe manage?\"\n\nIt was a matter, he discovered, of vacuum-suits, and they were tricky to\nget into and felt horrible when one was in. Struggling, Cochrane thought\nto say:\n\n\"You can wait here in the jeep, Babs--\"\n\nBut she was already climbing into a suit very much oversized for her,\nwith the look of high excitement that Cochrane had forgotten anybody\ncould wear.\n\nThey got out of a tiny airlock that held just one person at a time. They\nstarted for the laboratory. And suddenly Cochrane saw Babs staring\nupward through the dark, almost-opaque glass that a space-suit-helmet\nneeds in the moon's daytime if its occupant isn't to be fried by\nsunlight. Cochrane automatically glanced up too.\n\nHe saw Earth. It hung almost in mid-sky. It was huge. It was gigantic.\nIt was colossal. It was four times the diameter of the moon as seen from\nEarth, and it covered sixteen times as much of the sky. Its continents\nwere plain to see, and its seas, and the ice-caps at its poles gleamed\nwhitely, and over all of it there was a faintly bluish haze which was\nlike a glamour; a fey and eerie veiling which made Earth a sight to draw\nat one's heart-strings.\n\nBehind it and all about it there was the background of space, so thickly\njeweled with stars that there seemed no room for another tiny gem.\n\nCochrane looked. He said nothing. Holden stumbled on to the airlock. He\nremembered to hold the door open for Babs.\n\nAnd then there was the interior of the laboratory. It was not wholly\nfamiliar even to Cochrane, who had used sets on the Dikkipatti Hour of\nmost of the locations in which human dramas can unfold. This was a\nphysics laboratory, pure and simple. The air smelled of ozone and\nspilled acid and oil and food and tobacco-smoke and other items. West\nand Jamison were already here, their space-suits removed. They sat\nbefore beer at a table with innumerable diagrams scattered about. There\nwas a deep-browed man rather impatiently turning to face his new\nvisitors.\n\nHolden clumsily unfastened the face-plate of his helmet and gloomily\nexplained his mission. He introduced Cochrane and Babs, verifying in the\nprocess that the dark man was the Jones he had come to see. A physics\nlaboratory high in the fastnesses of the Lunar Apennines is an odd place\nfor a psychiatrist to introduce himself on professional business. But\nHolden only explained unhappily that Dabney had sent them to learn about\nhis discovery and arrange for a public-relations job to make it known.\n\nCochrane saw Jones' expression flicker sarcastically just once during\nHolden's explanation. Otherwise he was poker-faced.\n\n\"I was explaining the discovery to these two,\" he observed.\n\n\"Shoot it,\" said Cochrane to West. It was reasonable to ask West for an\nexplanation, because he would translate everything into televisable\nterms.\n\nWest said briskly--exactly as if before a television camera--that Mr.\nDabney had started from the well-known fact that the properties of space\nare modified by energy fields. Magnetic and gravitational and\nelectrostatic fields rotate polarized light or bend light or do this or\nthat as the case may be. But all previous modifications of the constants\nof space had been in essentially spherical fields. All previous fields\nhad extended in all directions, increasing in intensity as the square of\nthe distance ...\n\n\"Cut,\" said Cochrane.\n\nWest automatically abandoned his professional delivery. He placidly\nre-addressed himself to his beer.\n\n\"How about it, Jones?\" asked Cochrane. \"Dabney's got a variation? What\nis it?\"\n\n\"It's a field of force that doesn't spread out. You set up two plates\nand establish this field between them,\" said Jones curtly. \"It's\ncircularly polarized and it doesn't expand. It's like a searchlight beam\nor a microwave beam, and it stays the same size like a pipe. In that\nfield--or pipe--radiation travels faster than it does outside. The\nproperties of space are changed between the plates. Therefore the speed\nof all radiation. That's all.\"\n\nCochrane meditatively seated himself. He approved of this Jones, whose\neyebrows practically met in the middle of his forehead. He was not more\npolite than politeness required. He did not express employer-like\nrapture at the mention of his employer's name.\n\n\"But what can be done with it?\" asked Cochrane practically.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Jones succinctly. \"It changes the properties of space,\nbut that's all. Can you think of any use for a faster-than-light\nradiation-pipe? I can't.\"\n\nCochrane cocked an eye at Jamison, who could extrapolate at the drop of\nan equation. But Jamison shook his head.\n\n\"Communication between planets,\" he said morosely, \"when we get to them.\nChats between sweethearts on Earth and Pluto. Broadcasts to the stars\nwhen we find that another one's set up a similar plate and is ready to\nchat with us. There's nothing else.\"\n\nCochrane waved his hand. It is good policy to put a specialist in his\nplace, occasionally.\n\n\"Demonstration?\" he asked Jones.\n\n\"There are plates across the crater out yonder,\" said Jones without\nemotion. \"Twenty miles clear reach. I can send a message across and get\nit relayed twice and back through two angles in about five per cent of\nthe time radiation ought to take.\"\n\nCochrane said with benign cynicism:\n\n\"Jamison, you work by guessing where you can go. Jones works by guessing\nwhere he is. But this is a public relations job. I don't know where we\nare or where we can go, but I know where we want to take this thing.\"\n\nJones looked at him. Not hostilely, but with the detached interest of a\nman accustomed to nearly exact science, when he watches somebody work in\none of the least precise of them all.\n\nHolden said:\n\n\"You mean you've worked out some sort of production.\"\n\n\"No production,\" said Cochrane blandly. \"It isn't necessary. A straight\npublic-relations set-up. We concoct a story and then let it leak out. We\nmake it so good that even the people who don't believe it can't help\nspreading it.\" He nodded at Jamison. \"Right now, Jamison, we want a\ntheory that the sending of radiation at twenty times the speed of light\nmeans that there is a way to send matter faster than light--as soon as\nwe work it out. It means that the inertia-mass which increases with\nspeed--Einstein's stuff--is not a property of matter, but of space, just\nas the air-resistance that increases when an airplane goes faster is a\nproperty of air and not of the plane. Maybe we need to work out a theory\nthat all inertia is a property of space. We'll see if we need that. But\nanyhow, just as a plane can go faster in thin air, so matter--any\nmatter--will move faster in this field as soon as we get the trick of\nit. You see?\"\n\nHolden shook his head.\n\n\"What's that got in it to make Dabney famous?\" he asked.\n\n\"Jamison will extrapolate from there,\" Cochrane assured him. \"Go ahead,\nJamison. You're on.\"\n\nJamison said promptly, with the hypnotic smoothness of the practiced\nprofessional:\n\n\"When this development has been completed, not only will messages be\nsent at multiples of the speed of light, but matter! Ships! The barrier\nto the high destiny of mankind; the limitation of our race to a single\nplanet of a minor sun--these handicaps crash and will shatter as the\ngreat minds of humanity bend their efforts to make the Dabney\nfaster-than-light principle the operative principle of our ships. There\nare thousands of millions of suns in our galaxy, and not less than one\nin three has planets, and among these myriads of unknown worlds there\nwill be thousands with seas and land and clouds and continents, fit for\nmen to enter upon, there to rear their cities. There will be starships\nroaming distant sun-clusters, and landing on planets in the Milky Way.\nWe ourselves will see freight-lines to Rigel and Arcturus, and journey\non passenger-liners singing through the void to Andromeda and Aldebaran!\nDabney has made the first breach in the barrier to the illimitable\ngreatness of humanity!\"\n\nThen he stopped and said professionally:\n\n\"I can polish that up a bit, of course. All right?\"\n\n\"Fair,\" conceded Cochrane. He turned to Holden. \"How about a\npublic-relations job on that order? Won't that sort of publicity meet\nthe requirements? Will your patient be satisfied with that grade of\nappreciation?\"\n\nHolden drew a deep breath. He said unsteadily:\n\n\"As a neurotic personality, he won't require that it be true. All he'll\nwant is the seeming. But--Jed, could it be really true? Could it?\"\n\nCochrane laughed unpleasantly. He did not admire himself. His laughter\nshowed it.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he demanded. \"You got me a job I didn't want. You\nshoved it down my throat! Now there's the way to get it done! What more\ncan you ask?\"\n\nHolden winced. Then he said heavily:\n\n\"I'd like for it to be true.\"\n\nJones moved suddenly. He said in an oddly surprised voice:\n\n\"D'you know, it can be! I didn't realize! It can be true! I can make a\nship go faster than light!\"\n\nCochrane said with exquisite irony:\n\n\"Thanks, but we don't need it. We aren't getting paid for that! All we\nneed is a modicum of appreciation for a neurotic son-in-law of a partner\nof Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe! A public-relations job is all\nthat's required. You give West the theory, and Jamison will do the\nprophecy, and Bell will write it out.\"\n\nJones said calmly:\n\n\"I will like hell! Look! I discovered this faster-than-light field in\nthe first place! I sold it to Dabney because he wanted to be famous! I\ngot my pay and he can keep it! But if he can't understand it himself,\neven to lecture about it ... Do you think I'm going to throw in some\nextra stuff I noticed, that I can fit into that theory but nobody else\ncan--Do you think I'm going to give him starships as a bonus?\"\n\nHolden said, nodding, with his lips twisted:\n\n\"I should have figured that! He bought his great discovery from you, eh?\nAnd that's what he gets frustrated about!\"\n\nCochrane snapped:\n\n\"I thought you psychiatrists knew the facts of life, Bill! Dabney's not\nunusual in my business! He's almost a typical sponsor!\"\n\n\"When you ask me to throw away starships,\" said Jones coldly, \"for a\npublicity feature, I don't play. I won't take the credit for the field\naway from Dabney. I sold him that with my eyes open. But starships are\nmore important than a fool's hankering to be famous! He'd never try it!\nHe'd be afraid it wouldn't work! I don't play!\"\n\nHolden said stridently:\n\n\"I don't give a damn about any deal you made with Dabney! But if you can\nget us to the stars--all us humans who need it--you've got to!\"\n\nJones said, again calmly:\n\n\"I'm willing. Make me an offer--not cash, but a chance to do something\nreal--not just a trick for a neurotic's ego!\"\n\nCochrane grinned at him very peculiarly.\n\n\"I like your approach. You've got illusions. They're nice things to\nhave. I wouldn't mind having some myself. Bill,\" he said to Dr. William\nHolden, \"how much nerve has Dabney?\"\n\n\"Speaking unprofessionally,\" said Holden, \"he's a worm with wants. He\nhasn't anything but cravings. Why?\"\n\nCochrane grinned again, his head cocked on one side.\n\n\"He wouldn't take part in an enterprise to reach the stars, would he?\"\nWhen Holden shook his head, Cochrane said zestfully, \"I'd guess that the\npeak of his ambition would be to have the credit for it if it worked,\nbut he wouldn't risk being associated with it until it had worked!\nRight?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Holden. \"I said he was a worm. What're you driving at?\"\n\n\"I'm outlining what you're twisting my arm to make me do,\" said\nCochrane, \"in case you haven't noticed. Bill, if Jones can really make\na ship go faster than light--\"\n\n\"I can,\" repeated Jones. \"I simply didn't think of the thing in\nconnection with travel. I only thought of it for signalling.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Cochrane, \"I'm literally forced, for Dabney's sake, to do\nsomething that he'd scream shrilly at if he heard about it. We're going\nto have a party, Bill! A party after your and my and Jones' hearts!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Holden.\n\n\"We make a production after all,\" said Cochrane, grinning. \"We are going\nto take Dabney's discovery--the one he bought publicity rights to--very\nseriously indeed. I'm going to get him acclaim. First we break a story\nof what Dabney's field means for the future of mankind--and then we\nprove it! We take a journey to the stars! Want to make your reservations\nnow?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said West incredulously, \"a genuine trip? Why?\"\n\nCochrane snapped at him suddenly.\n\n\"Because I can't kid myself any more,\" he rasped. \"I've found out how\nlittle I count in the world and the estimation of Kursten, Kasten,\nHopkins and Fallowe! I've found out I'm only a little man when I thought\nI was a big one, and I won't take it! Now I've got an excuse to try to\nbe a big man! That's reason enough, isn't it?\"\n\nThen he glared around the small laboratory under the dust-heap. He was\nirritated because he did not feel splendid emotions after making a\nresolution and a plan which ought to go down in history--if it worked.\nHe wasn't uplifted. He wasn't aware of any particular feeling of being\nthe instrument of destiny or anything else. He simply felt peevish and\nannoyed and obstinate about trying the impossible trick.\n\nIt annoyed him additionally, perhaps, to see the expression of\nstarry-eyed admiration on Babs' face as she looked at him across the\nuntidy laboratory table, cluttered up with beer-cans.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n\nIt is a matter of record that the American continents were discovered\nbecause ice-boxes were unknown in the fifteenth century. There being no\nrefrigeration, meat did not keep. But meat was not too easy to come by,\nso it had to be eaten, even when it stank. Therefore it was a noble\nenterprise, and to the glory of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, to\nput up the financial backing for even a crackpot who might get spices\ncheaper and thereby make the consumption of slightly spoiled meat less\nunpleasant. Which was why Columbus got three ships and crews of\njailbirds for them from a government still busy trying to drive the\nMoors out of the last corner of Spain.\n\nThis was a precedent for the matter on hand now. Cochrane happened to\nknow the details about Columbus because he'd checked over the research\nwhen he did a show on the Dikkipatti Hour dealing with him. There were\nmore precedents. The elaborate bargain by which Columbus was to be made\nhereditary High Admiral of the Western Oceans, with a bite of all\nrevenue obtained by the passage he was to discover--he had to hold out\nfor such terms to make the package he was selling look attractive.\nNobody buys anything that is underpriced too much. It looks phoney. So\nCochrane made his preliminaries rather more impressive than they need\nhave been from a strictly practical point of view, in order to make the\nenterprise practical from a financial aspect.\n\nThere was another precedent he did not intend to follow. Columbus did\nnot know where he was going when he set sail, he did not know where he\nwas when he arrived at the end of his voyage, and he didn't know where\nhe'd been when he got back. Cochrane expected to improve on the\nachievement of the earlier explorer's doings in these respects.\n\nHe commandeered the legal department of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins, and\nFallowe to set up the enterprise with strict legality and discretion.\nThere came into being a corporation called \"Spaceways, Inc.\" which could\nnot possibly be considered phoney from any inspection of its charter.\nExpert legal advice arranged that its actual stock-holders should appear\nto be untraceable. Deft manipulation contrived that though its stock was\nlegally vested in Cochrane and Holden and Jones--Cochrane negligently\nthrew in Jones as a convenient name to use--and they were officially the\nowners of nearly all the stock, nobody who checked up would believe they\nwere anything but dummies. Stockholdings in West's, and Jamison's and\nBell's names would look like smaller holdings held for other than the\nmain entrepreneurs. But these stock-holders were not only the legal\nowners of record--they were the true owners. Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins\nand Fallowe wanted no actual part of Spaceways. They considered the\nenterprise merely a psychiatric treatment for a neurotic son-in-law.\nWhich, of course, it was. So Spaceways, Inc., quite honestly and validly\nbelonged to the people who would cure Dabney of his frustration--and\nnobody at all believed that it would ever do anything else. Not anybody\nbut those six owners, anyhow. And as it turned out, not all of them.\n\nThe psychiatric treatment began with an innocent-seeming news-item from\nLunar City saying that Dabney, the so-and-so scientist, had consented to\nact as consulting physicist to Spaceways, Inc., for the practical\napplication of his recent discovery of a way to send messages faster\nthan light.\n\nThis was news simply because it came from the moon. It got fairly wide\ndistribution, but no emphasis.\n\nThen the publicity campaign broke. On orders from Cochrane, Jamison the\nextrapolating genius got slightly plastered, in company with the two\nnews-association reporters in Lunar City. He confided that Spaceways,\nInc., had been organized and was backed to develop the Dabney\nfaster-than-light-signalling field into a faster-than-light-travel\nfield. The news men pumped him of all his extrapolations. Cynically,\nthey checked to see who might be preparing to unload stock. They found\nno preparations for stock-sales. No registration of the company for\nraising funds. It wasn't going to the public for money. It wasn't\nselling anybody anything. Then Cochrane refused to see any reporters at\nall, everybody connected with the enterprise shut up tighter than a\nclam, and Jamison vanished into a hotel room where he was kept occupied\nwith beverages and food at Dabney's father-in-law's expense. None of\nthis was standard for a phoney promotion deal.\n\nThe news story exploded. Let loose on an overcrowded planet which had\nlost all hope of relief after fifty years in which only the moon had\nbeen colonized--and its colony had a population in the hundreds,\nonly--the idea of faster-than-light travel was the one impossible dream\nthat everybody wanted to believe in. The story spread in a manner that\ncould only be described as chain-reaction in character. And of course\nDabney--as the scientist responsible for the new hope--became known to\nall peoples.\n\nThe experts of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe checked on the\npublicity given to Dabney. Strict advertising agency accounting figured\nthat to date the cost-per-customer-mention of Dabney and his discovery\nwere the lowest in the history of advertising. Surveys disclosed that\nwithin three Earth-days less than 3.5 of every hundred interviews\nquestioned were completely ignorant of Dabney and the prospect of travel\nto the stars through his discovery. More people knew Dabney's name than\nknew the name of the President of the United States!\n\nThat was only the beginning. The leading popular-science show jumped\neight points in audience-rating. It actually reached top-twenty rating\nwhen it assigned a regular five-minute period to the Dabney Field and\nits possibilities in human terms. On the sixth day after Jamison's\ncalculated indiscretion, the public consciousness was literally\nsaturated with the idea of faster-than-light transportation. Dabney was\nmentioned in every interview of every stuffed shirt, he was referred\nto on every comedy show (three separate jokes had been invented, which\nwere developed into one thousand eight hundred switcheroos, most\nof them only imperceptibly different from the original trio) and\neven Marilyn Winters--Little Aphrodite Herself--was demanding a\nfaster-than-light-travel sequence in her next television show.\n\nOn the seventh day Bill Holden came into the office where Cochrane\nworked feverishly.\n\n\"Doctor Cochrane,\" said Holden, \"a word with you!\"\n\n\"Doctor?\" asked Cochrane.\n\n\"Doctor!\" repeated Holden. \"I've just been interviewing my patient.\nYou're good. My patient is adjusted.\"\n\nCochrane raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"He's famous,\" said Holden grimly. \"He now considers that everybody in\nthe world knows that he is a great scientist. He is appreciated. He is\nhappily making plans to go back to Earth and address a few learned\nsocieties and let people admire him. He can now spend the rest of his\nlife being the man who discovered the principle by which\nfaster-than-light-travel will some day be achieved. Even when the furor\ndies down, he will have been a great man--and he will stay a great man\nin his own estimation. In short, he's cured.\"\n\nCochrane grinned.\n\n\"Then I'm fired?\"\n\n\"We are,\" said Holden. \"There are professional ethics even among\npsychiatrists, Jed. I have to admit that the guy now has a permanent\nadjustment to reality. He has been recognized as a great scientist. He\nis no longer frustrated.\"\n\nCochrane leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"That may be good medical ethics,\" he observed, \"but it's lousy business\npractice, Bill. You say he's adjusted to reality. That means that he\nwill now have a socially acceptable reaction to anything that's likely\nto happen to him.\"\n\nHolden nodded.\n\n\"A well-adjusted person does. Dabney's the same person. He's the same\nfool. But he'll get along all right. A psychiatrist can't change a\npersonality! All he can do is make it adjust to the world about so the\nguy doesn't have to be tucked away in a straight-jacket. In that sense,\nDabney is adjusted.\"\n\n\"You've played a dirty trick on him,\" said Cochrane. \"You've stabilized\nhim, and that's the rottenest trick anybody can play on anybody! You've\nput him into a sort of moral deep-freeze. It's a dirty trick, Bill!\"\n\n\"Look who's talking!\" said Holden wearily. \"I suppose the advertising\nbusiness is altruistic and unmercenary?\"\n\n\"The devil, no!\" said Cochrane indignantly. \"We serve a useful purpose!\nWe tell people that they smell bad, and so give them an alibi for the\nunpopularity their stupidity has produced. But then we tell them to use\nso-and-so's breath sweetener or whosit's non-immunizing deodorant\nthey'll immediately become the life of every party they attend! It's a\nlie, of course, but it's a dynamic lie! It gives the frustrated\nindividual something to do! It sells him hope and therefore\nactivity--and inactivity is a sort of death!\"\n\nHolden looked at Cochrane with a dreary disinterest.\n\n\"You're adjusted, Jed! But do you really believe that stuff?\"\n\nCochrane grinned again.\n\n\"Only on Tuesdays and Fridays. It's about two-sevenths true. But it does\nhave that much truth in it! Nobody ever gets anything done while they\nmerely make socially acceptable responses to the things that happen to\nthem! Take Dabney himself! We've got a hell of a thing coming along now\njust because he wouldn't make the socially acceptable response to having\na rich wife and no brains. He rebelled. So mankind will start moving to\nthe stars!\"\n\n\"You still believe it?\"\n\nCochrane grimaced.\n\n\"Yesterday morning I sweated blood in a space-suit out in the crater\nbeyond Jones' laboratory. He tried his trick. He had a small\nsignal-rocket mounted on the far side of that crater,--twenty-some\nmiles. It was in front of the field-plate that established the Dabney\nfield across the crater to another plate near us. Jones turned on the\nfield. He ignited the rocket by remote control. I was watching with a\ntelescope. I gave him the word to fire.... How long do you think it took\nthat rocket to cross the crater in that field that works like a pipe? It\nsmashed into the plate at the lab!\"\n\nHolden shook his head.\n\n\"It took slightly,\" said Cochrane, \"slightly under three-fifths of a\nsecond.\"\n\nHolden blinked. Cochrane said:\n\n\"A signal-rocket has an acceleration of about six hundred feet per\nsecond, level flight, no gravity component, mass acceleration only. It\nshould have taken a hundred seconds plus to cross that crater--over\ntwenty miles. It shouldn't have stayed on course. It did stay on course,\ninside the field. It did take under three-fifths of a second. The gadget\nworks!\"\n\nHolden drew a deep breath.\n\n\"So now you need more money and you want me not to discharge my patient\nas cured.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" snapped Cochrane. \"I don't want him as a patient! I'm\nonly willing to accept him as a customer! But if he wants fame, I'll\nsell it to him. Not as something to lean his fragile psyche on, but\nsomething to wallow in! Do you think he could ever get too famous for\nhis own satisfaction?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Holden. \"He's the same fool.\"\n\n\"Then we're in business,\" Cochrane told him. \"Not that I couldn't peddle\nmy fish elsewhere. I'm going to! But I'll give him old-customer\npreference. I'll want him out at the distress-torp tests this afternoon.\nThey'll be public.\"\n\n\"This afternoon?\" asked Holden. \"Distress-torp?\"\n\nA lunar day is two Earth-weeks-long. A lunar night is equally\nlong-drawn-out. Cochrane said impatiently:\n\n\"I got out of bed four hours ago. To me that's morning. I'll eat lunch\nin an hour. That's noon. Say, three hours from now, whatever o'clock it\nis lunar time.\"\n\nHolden glanced at his watch and made computations. He said:\n\n\"That'll be half-past two hundred and three o'clock, if you're curious.\nBut what's a distress-torp?\"\n\n\"Shoo!\" said Cochrane. \"I'll send Babs to find you and load you on the\njeep. You'll see then. Now I'm busy!\"\n\nHolden shrugged and went away, and Cochrane stared at his own watch.\nSince a lunar day and night together fill twenty-eight Earth days of\ntime, a strictly lunar \"day\" contains nearly three hundred forty\nEarth-hours. To call one-twelfth of that period an hour would be an\naffectation. To call each twenty-four Earth hours a day would have been\nabsurd. So the actual period of the moon's rotation was divided into\nfamiliar time-intervals, and a bulletin-board in the hotel lobby in\nLunar City notified those interested that: \"_Sunday will be from 143\no'clock to 167 o'clock A.M._\" There would be another Sunday some time\nduring the lunar afternoon.\n\nCochrane debated momentarily whether this information could be used in\nthe publicity campaign of Spaceways, Inc. Strictly speaking, there was\nsome slight obligation to throw extra fame Dabney's way regardless,\nbecause the corporation had been formed as a public-relations device.\nAny other features, such as changing the history of the human race, were\ntechnically incidental. But Cochrane put his watch away. To talk about\nhorology on the moon wouldn't add to Dabney's stature as a phoney\nscientist. It didn't matter.\n\nHe went back to the business at hand. Some two years before there had\nbeen a fake corporation organized strictly for the benefit of its\npromoters. It had built a rocket-ship ostensibly for the establishment\nof a colony on Mars. The ship had managed to stagger up to Luna, but no\nfarther. Its promoters had sold stock on the promise that a ship that\ncould barely reach Luna could take off from that small globe with six\ntimes as much fuel as it could lift off of Earth. Which was true.\nInvestors put in their money on that verifiable fact. But the truth\nhappened to be, of course, that it would still take an impossible amount\nof fuel to accelerate the ship--so heavily loaded--to a speed where it\nwould reach Mars in one human lifetime. Taking off from Luna would solve\nonly the problem of gravity. It wouldn't do a thing about inertia. So\nthe ship never rose from its landing near Lunar City. The corporation\nthat had built it went profitably bankrupt.\n\nCochrane had been working feverishly to find out who owned that ship\nnow. Just before the torp-test he'd mentioned, he found that the ship\nbelonged to the hotel desk-clerk, who had bought it in hope of renting\nit sooner or later for television background-shots in case anybody was\ncrazy enough to make a television film-tape on the moon. He was now\ndiscouraged. Cochrane chartered it, putting up a bond to return it\nundamaged. If the ship was lost, the hotel-clerk would get back his\ninvestment--about a week's pay.\n\nSo Cochrane had a space-ship practically in his pocket when the public\ndemonstration of the Dabney field came off at half-past 203 o'clock.\n\nThe site of the demonstration was the shadowed, pitch-dark part of the\nfloor of a crater twenty miles across, with walls some ten thousand\njagged feet high. The furnace-like sunshine made the plain beyond the\nshadow into a sea of blinding brightness. The sunlit parts of the\ncrater's walls were no less terribly glaring. But above the edge of the\ncliffs the stars began; infinitely small and many-colored, with\ninnumerable degrees of brightness. The Earth hung in mid-sky like a\nswollen green apple, monstrous in size. And the figures which moved\nabout the scene of the test could be seen only faintly by reflected\nlight from the lava plain, because one's eyes had to be adjusted to the\nwhite-hot moon-dust on the plain and mountains.\n\nThere were not many persons present. Three jeeps waited in the\nsemi-darkness, out of the burning sunshine. There were no more than a\ndozen moon-suited individuals to watch and to perform the test of the\nDabney field. Cochrane had scrupulously edited all fore-news of the\nexperiment to give Dabney the credit he had paid for. There were\npresent, then, the party from Earth--Cochrane and Babs and Holden, with\nthe two tame scientists and Bell the writer--and the only two reporters\non the moon. Only news syndicates could stand the expense-account of a\nfield man in Lunar City. And then there were Jones and Dabney and two\nother figures apparently brought by Dabney.\n\nThere was, of course, no sound at all on the moon itself. There was no\nair to carry it. But from each plastic helmet a six-inch antenna\nprojected straight upward, and the microwaves of suit-talkies made a\njumble of slightly metallic sounds in the headphones of each suit.\n\nAs soon as Cochrane got out of the jeep's air-lock and was recognized,\nDabney said agitatedly:\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane! Mr. Cochrane! I have to discuss something with you! It is\nof the utmost importance! Will you come into the laboratory?\"\n\nCochrane helped Babs to the ground and made his way to the airlock in\nthe dust-heap against the cliff. He went in, with two other space-suited\nfigures who detached themselves from the rest to follow him. Once inside\nthe odorous, cramped laboratory, Dabney opened his face-plate and began\nto speak before Cochrane was ready to hear him. His companion beamed\namiably.\n\n\"--and therefore, Mr. Cochrane,\" Dabney was saying agitatedly, \"I insist\nthat measures be taken to protect my scientific reputation! If this test\nshould fail, it will militate against the acceptance of my discovery! I\nwarn you--and I have my friend Mr. Simms here as witness--that I will\nnot be responsible for the operation of apparatus made by a subordinate\nwho does not fully comprehend the theory of my discovery! I will not be\ninvolved--\"\n\nCochrane nodded. Dabney, of course, didn't understand the theory of the\nfield he'd bought fame-rights to. But there was no point in bringing\nthat up. Johnny Simms beamed at both of them. He was the swimmer Babs\nhad pointed out in the swimming-pool. His face was completely unlined\nand placid, like the face of a college undergraduate. He had never\nworried about anything. He'd never had a care in the world. He merely\nlistened with placid interest.\n\n\"I take it,\" said Cochrane, \"that you don't mind the test being made, so\nlong as you don't have to accept responsibility for its failure--and so\nlong as you get the credit for its success if it works. That's right,\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"If it fails, I am not responsible!\" insisted Dabney stridently. \"If it\nsucceeds, it will be because of my discovery.\"\n\nCochrane sighed a little. This was a shabby business, but Dabney would\nhave convinced himself, by now, that he was the genius he wanted people\nto believe him.\n\n\"Before the test,\" said Cochrane gently, \"you make a speech. It will be\nrecorded. You disclaim the crass and vulgar mechanical details and\nemphasize that you are like Einstein, dealing in theoretic physics only.\nThat you are naturally interested in attempts to use your discovery, but\nyour presence is a sign of your interest but not your responsibility.\"\n\n\"I shall have to think it over--,\" began Dabney nervously.\n\n\"You can say,\" promised Cochrane, \"that if it does not work you will\ncheck over what Jones did and tell him why.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Dabney hesitantly, \"I could do that. But I must think it\nover first. You will have to delay--\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" said Cochrane confidentially, \"I would plan a speech to\nthat effect because the test is coming off in five minutes.\"\n\nHe closed his face-plate as Dabney began to protest. He went into the\nlock. He knew better than to hold anything up while waiting for a\nneurotic to make a decision. Dabney had all he wanted, now. From this\nmoment on he would be frantic for fear of losing it. But there could be\nno argument outside the laboratory. In the airlessness, anything anybody\nsaid by walkie-talkie could be heard by everybody.\n\nWhen Dabney and Simms followed out of the lock, Cochrane was helping\nJones set up the device that had been prepared for this test. It was\nreally two devices. One was a very flat cone, much like a coolie-hat and\nhardly larger, with a sort of power-pack of coils and batteries\nattached. The other was a space-ship's distress-signal rocket, designed\nto make a twenty-mile streak of red flame in emptiness. Nobody had yet\nfigured out what good a distress signal would do, between Earth and\nmoon, but the idea was soothing. The rocket was four feet long and six\ninches in diameter. At its nose there was a second coolie-hat cone, with\nother coils and batteries.\n\nJones set the separate cone on the ground and packed stones around and\nunder it to brace it. His movements were almost ridiculously deliberate.\nBending over, he bent slowly, or the motion would lift his feet off the\nground. Straightening up, he straightened slowly, or the upward impetus\nof his trunk would again lift him beyond contact with solidity. But he\nbraced the flat cone carefully.\n\nHe set the signal-torpedo over that cone. The entire set-up was under\nsix feet tall, and the coolie-hat cones were no more than eighteen\ninches in diameter. He said flatly:\n\n\"I'm all ready.\"\n\nThe hand and arm of a space-suited figure lifted, for attention.\nDabney's voice came worriedly from the headphones of every suit:\n\n\"I wish it understood,\" he said in some agitation, \"that this first\nattempted application of my discovery is made with my consent, but that\nI am not aware of the mechanical details. As a scientist, my work has\nbeen in pure science. I have worked for the advancement of human\nknowledge, but the technological applications of my discovery are not\nmine. Still--if this device does not work, I will take time from my more\nimportant researches to inquire into what part of my discovery has been\ninadequately understood and applied. It may be that present technology\nis not qualified to apply my discovery--\"\n\nJones said without emotion--but Cochrane could imagine his poker-faced\nexpression inside his helmet:\n\n\"That's right. I consulted Mr. Dabney about the principles, but the\napparatus is my doing, I take the responsibility for that!\"\n\nThen Cochrane added with pleasant irony:\n\n\"Since all this is recorded, Mr. Dabney can enlarge upon his disinterest\nlater. Right now, we can go ahead. Mr. Dabney disavows us unless we are\nsuccessful. Let us let it go at that.\" Then he said: \"The observatory's\nset to track?\"\n\nA muffled voice said boredly, by short-wave from the observatory up on\nthe crater's rim:\n\n\"_We're ready. Visual and records, and we've got the timers set to clock\nthe auto-beacon signals as they come in._\"\n\nThe voice was not enthusiastic. Cochrane had had to put up his own money\nto have the nearside lunar observatory put a low-power telescope to\nwatch the rocket's flight. In theory, this distress-rocket should make a\ntwenty-mile streak of relatively long-burning red sparks. A tiny\nauto-beacon in its nose was set to send microwave signals at ten-second\nintervals. On the face of it, it had looked like a rather futile\nperformance.\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Cochrane.\n\nHe noted with surprise that his mouth was suddenly dry. This affair was\nout of all reason. A producer of television shows should not be the\nperson to discover in an abstruse scientific development the way to\nreach the stars. A neurotic son-in-law of an advertising tycoon should\nnot be the instrument by which the discovery should come about. A\npsychiatrist should not be the means of associating Jones--a very junior\nphysicist with no money--and Cochrane and the things Cochrane was\nprepared to bring about if only this unlikely-looking gadget worked.\n\n\"Jones,\" said Cochrane with a little difficulty, \"let's follow an\nancient tradition. Let Babs christen the enterprise by throwing the\nswitch.\"\n\nJones pointed there in the shadow of the crater-wall, and Babs moved to\nthe switch he indicated. She said absorbedly:\n\n\"Five, four, three, two, one--\"\n\nShe threw the switch. There was a spout of lurid red flame.\n\nThe rocket vanished.\n\nIt vanished. It did not rise, visibly. It simply went away from where it\nwas, with all the abruptness of a light going out. There was a flurry of\nthe most brilliant imaginable carmine flame. That light remained. But\nthe rocket did not so much rise as disappear.\n\nCochrane jerked his head up. He was close to the line of the rocket's\nascent. He could see a trail of red sparks which stretched to\ninvisibility. It was an extraordinarily thin line. The separate flecks\nof crimson light which comprised it were distant in space. They were so\nfar from each other that the signal-rocket was a complete failure as a\ndevice making a streak of light that should be visible.\n\nThe muffled voice in the helmet-phones said blankly:\n\n\"_Hey! What'd you do to that rocket?_\"\n\nThe others did not move. They seemed stunned. The vanishing of the\nrocket was no way for a rocket to act. In all expectation, it should\nhave soared skyward with a reasonable velocity, and should have\naccelerated rather more swiftly from the moon's surface than it would\nhave done from Earth. But it should have remained visible during all its\nflight. Its trail should have been a thick red line. Instead, the red\nsparks were so far separated--the trail was so attenuated that it was\nvisible only from a spot near its base. The observatory voice said more\nblankly still:\n\n\"_Hey! I've picked up the trail! I can't see it nearby, but it seems to\nstart, thin, about fifty miles up and go on away from there! That\nrocket shouldn't ha' gone more than twenty miles! What happened?_\"\n\n\"_Watch for the microwave signals_,\" said Jones' voice in Cochrane's\nheadphones.\n\nThe voice from the observatory squeaked suddenly. This was not one of\nthe highly-placed astronomers, but part of the mechanical staff who'd\nbeen willing to do an unreasonable chore for pay.\n\n\"_Here's the blip! It's crazy! Nothing can go that fast!_\"\n\nAnd then in the phones there came the relayed signal of the auto-beacon\nin the vanished rocket. The signal-sound was that of a radar pulse,\nbeginning at low pitch and rising three octaves in the tenth of a\nsecond. At middle C--the middle of the range of a piano--there was a\nmomentary spurt of extra volume. But in the relayed signal that louder\ninstant had dropped four tones. Cochrane said crisply:\n\n\"Jones, what speed would that be?\"\n\n\"_It'd take a slide-rule to figure it_,\" said Jones' voice, very calmly,\n\"_but it's faster than anything ever went before._\"\n\nCochrane waited for the next beep. It did not come in ten seconds. It\nwas easily fifteen. Even he could figure out what that meant! A\nsignal-source that stretched ten seconds of interval at source to\nfifteen at reception ...\n\nThe voice from the observatory wailed:\n\n\"_It's crazy! It can't be going like that!_\"\n\nThey waited. Fifteen seconds more. Sixteen. Eighteen. Twenty. The beep\nsounded. The spurt of sound had dropped a full octave. The\nsignal-rocket, traveling normally, might have attained a maximum\nvelocity of some two thousand feet per second. It was now moving at a\nspeed which was an appreciably large fraction of the speed of light.\nWhich was starkly impossible. It simply happened to be true.\n\nThey heard the signal once more. The observatory's multiple-receptor\nreceiver had been stepped up to maximum amplification. The signal was\ndistinct, but very faint indeed. And the rocket was then traveling--so\nit was later computed--at seven-eighths of the speed of light. Between\nthe flat cone on the front of the distress-torpedo, and the flat cone on\nthe ground, a field of force existed. The field was not on the back\nsurface of the torpedo's cone, but before the front surface. It went\nback to the moon from there, so all the torpedo and its batteries were\nin the columnar stressed space. And an amount of rocket-push that should\nhave sent the four-foot torpedo maybe twenty miles during its period of\nburning, had actually extended its flight to more than thirty-seven\nhundred miles before the red sparks were too far separated to be traced\nany farther, and by then had kicked the torpedo up impossibly close to\nlight-speed.\n\nIn a sense, the Dabney field had an effect similar to the invention of\nrailways. The same horsepower moved vastly more weight faster, over\nsteel rails, than it could haul over a rutted dirt road. The same\nrocket-thrust moved more weight faster in the Dabney field than in\nnormal space. There would be a practical limit to the speed at which a\nwagon could be drawn over a rough road. The speed of light was a limit\nto the speed of matter in normal space. But on a railway the practical\nspeed at which a vehicle could travel went up from three miles an hour\nto a hundred and twenty. In the Dabney field it was yet to be discovered\nwhat the limiting velocity might be. But old formulas for acceleration\nand increase-of-mass-with-velocity simply did not apply in a Dabney\nfield.\n\nJones rode back to Lunar City with Cochrane and Holden and Babs. His\nface was dead-pan.\n\nBabs tried to recover the mien and manner of the perfect secretary.\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane,\" she said professionally, \"will you want to read the\npublicity releases Mr. Bell turns out from what Mr. West and Mr. Jamison\ntell him?\"\n\n\"I don't think it matters,\" said Cochrane. \"The newsmen will pump West\nand Jamison empty, anyhow. It's all right. In fact, it's better than our\nown releases would be. They'll contradict each other. It'll sound more\nauthentic that way. We're building up a customer-demand for\ninformation.\"\n\nThe small moon-jeep rolled and bumped gently down the long, improbable\nhighway back to Lunar City. Its engine ran smoothly, as steam-engines\nalways do. It ran on seventy per cent hydrogen peroxide, first developed\nas a fuel back in the 1940s for the pumps of the V2 rockets that tried\nto win the Second World War for Germany. When hydrogen peroxide comes in\ncontact with a catalyst, such as permanganate of potash, it breaks down\ninto oxygen and water. But the water is in the form of high-pressure\nsteam, which is used in engines. The jeep's fuel supplied steam for\npower and its ashes were water to drink and oxygen to breathe. Steam ran\nall motorized vehicles on Luna.\n\n\"What are you thinking about, Jones?\" asked Cochrane suddenly.\n\nJones said meditatively:\n\n\"I'm wondering what sort of field-strength a capacity-storage system\nwould give me. I boosted the field intensity this time. The results were\npretty good. I'm thinking--suppose I made the field with a strobe-light\npower-pack--or maybe a spot-welding unit. Even a portable strobe-light\ngives a couple of million watts for the forty-thousandth of a second.\nSuppose I fixed up a storage-pack to give me a field with a few billion\nwatts in it? It might be practically like matter-transmission, though it\nwould really be only high-speed travel. I think I've got to work on that\nidea a little ...\"\n\nCochrane digested the information in silence.\n\n\"Far be it from me,\" he said presently, \"to discourage such high-level\ncontemplation. Bill, what's on your mind?\"\n\nHolden said moodily:\n\n\"I'm convinced that the thing works. But Jed! You talk as if you hadn't\nany more worries! Yet even if you and Jones do have a way to make a ship\ntravel faster than light, you haven't got a ship or the capital you\nneed--.\"\n\n\"I've got scenery that looks like a ship,\" said Cochrane mildly.\n\"Consider that part settled.\"\n\n\"But there are supplies. Air--water--food--a crew--. We can't pay for\nsuch things! Here on the moon the cost of everything is preposterous!\nHow can you try out this idea without more capital than you can possibly\nraise?\"\n\n\"I'm going to imitate my old friend Christopher Columbus,\" said\nCochrane. \"I'm going to give the customers what they want. Columbus\ndidn't try to sell anybody shares in new continents. Who wanted new\ncontinents? Who wanted to move to a new world? Who wants new planets\nnow? Everybody would like to see their neighbors move away and leave\nmore room, but nobody wants to move himself. Columbus sold a promise of\nsomething that had an already-established value, that could be sold in\nevery town and village--that had a merchandising system already set up!\nI'm going to offer just such a marketable commodity. I'll have\nfreight-rockets on the way up here within twenty-four hours, and the\nfreight and their contents will all be paid for!\"\n\nHe turned to Babs. He looked more sardonic and cynical than ever before.\n\n\"Babs, you've just witnessed one of the moments that ought to be\nillustrated in all the grammar-school history-books along with Ben\nFranklin flying a kite. What's topmost in your mind?\"\n\nShe hesitated and then flushed. The moon-jeep crunched and clanked\nloudly over the trail that led downhill. There was no sound outside, of\ncourse. There was no air. But the noise inside the moon-vehicle was\nnotable. The steam-motor, in particular, made a highly individual\nracket.\n\n\"I'd--rather not say,\" said Babs awkwardly. \"What's your own main\nfeeling, Mr. Cochrane?\"\n\n\"Mine?\" Cochrane grinned. \"I'm thinking what a hell of a funny world\nthis is, when people like Dabney and Bill and Jones and I are the ones\nwho have to begin operation outer space!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n\nCochrane said kindly into the vision-beam microphone to Earth, \"Cancel\nsection C, paragraph nine. Then section b(1) from paragraph eleven. Then\nafter you've canceled the entire last section--fourteen--we can sign up\nthe deal.\"\n\nThere was a four-second pause. About two seconds for his voice to reach\nEarth. About two seconds for the beginning of the reply to reach him.\nThe man at the other end protested wildly.\n\n\"We're a long way apart,\" said Cochrane blandly, \"and our talk only\ntravels at the speed of light. You're not talking from one continent to\nanother. Save tolls. Yes or no?\"\n\nAnother four-second pause. The man on Earth profanely agreed. Cochrane\nsigned the contract before him. The other man signed. Not only the\ndocuments but all conversation was recorded. There were plugged-in\nwitnesses. The contract was binding.\n\nCochrane leaned back in his chair. His eyes blinked wearily. He'd spent\nhours going over the facsimile-transmitted contract with Joint Networks,\nand had weeded out a total of six joker-stipulations. He was very tired.\nHe yawned.\n\n\"You can tell Jones, Babs,\" he said, \"that all the high financing's\ndone. He can spend money. And you can transmit my resignation to\nKursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe. And since this is a pretty risky\noperation, you'd better send a service message asking what you're to do\nwith yourself. They'll probably tell you to take the next rocket back\nand report to the secretarial pool, I'm afraid. The same fate probably\nawaits West and Jamison and Bell.\"\n\nBabs said guiltily:\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane--you've been so busy I had to use my own judgment. I\ndidn't want to interrupt you--.\"\n\n\"What now?\" demanded Cochrane.\n\n\"The publicity on the torp-test,\" said Babs guiltily, \"was so good\nthat the firm was worried for fear we'd seem to be doing it for\na client of the firm--which we are. So we've all been put on a\nleave-with-expenses-and-pay status. Officially, we're all sick and the\nfirm is paying our expenses until we regain our health.\"\n\n\"Kind of them,\" said Cochrane. \"What's the bite?\"\n\n\"They're sending up talent contracts for us to sign,\" admitted Babs.\n\"When we go back, we would command top prices for interviews. The firm,\nof course, will want to control that.\"\n\nCochrane raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"I see! But you'll actually be kept off the air so Dabney can be\ntelevision's fair-haired boy. He'll go on Marilyn Winter's show, I'll\nbet, because that has the biggest audience on the planet. He'll lecture\nLittle Aphrodite Herself on the constants of space and she'll flutter\nher eyelashes at him and shove her chest-measurements in his direction\nand breathe how wonderful it is to be a man of science!\"\n\n\"How'd you know?\" demanded Babs, surprised.\n\nCochrane winced.\n\n\"Heaven help me, Babs, I didn't. I tried to guess at something too\nimpossible even for the advertising business! But I failed! I failed!\nYou and my official gang, then, are here with the firm's blessing, free\nof all commands and obligations, but drawing salary and expenses?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Babs. \"And so are you.\"\n\n\"I get off!\" said Cochrane firmly. \"Forward my resignation. It's a\nmatter of pure vanity. But Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe do move\nin a mysterious way to latch onto a fast buck! I'm going to get some\nsleep. Is there anything else you've had to use your judgment on?\"\n\n\"The contracts for re-broadcast of the torp-test. The original broadcast\nhad an audience-rating of seventy-one!\"\n\n\"Such,\" said Cochrane, \"are the uses of fame. Our cash?\"\n\nShe showed him a neatly typed statement. For the original run of the\ntorp-test film-tape, so much. It was to be re-run with a popularization\nof the technical details by West, and a lurid extrapolation of things to\ncome by Jamison. The sponsors who got hold of commercial time with that\nexpanded and souped-up version would expect, and get, an audience-rating\nunparalleled in history. Dabney was to take a bow on the rebroadcast,\ntoo--very much the dignified and aloof scientist. There were other\ninterviews. Dabney again, from a script written by Bell. And Jones.\nJones hated the idea of being interviewed, but he had faced a\nbeam-camera and answered idiotic questions, and gone angrily back to his\nwork.\n\nSpaceways, Inc., had a bank-account already amounting to more than\ntwenty years of Cochrane's best earning-power. He was selling publicity\nfor sponsors to hang their commercials on, in a strict parallel to\nChristopher Columbus' selling of spices to come. But Cochrane was\ndelivering for cash. Freight-rockets were on the way moonward now, whose\ncargoes of supplies for a space-journey Cochrane was accepting only when\na bonus in money was paid for the right to brag about it. So-and-so's\noxygen paid for the privilege of supplying air-reserves.\nWhat's-his-name's dehydrated vegetables were accepted on similar terms,\nwith whoosit's instant coffee and somebody else's noodle soup in bags.\n\n\"If,\" said Cochrane tiredly, looking up from the statement, \"we could\nonly start off in a fleet instead of a single ship, Babs, we'd not only\nbe equipped but so rich before we started that we'd want to stay home to\nenjoy it!\" He yawned prodigiously. \"I'm going to get some sleep. Don't\nlet me sleep too long!\"\n\nHe went off to his hotel-room and was out cold before his head had\ndrifted down to its pillow. But he was not pleased with himself. It\nannoyed him that his revolt against being an expendable employee had\ntaken the form of acting like one of his former bosses in collecting\nruthlessly for the brains--in the case of Jones--and the neurotic\nidiosyncrasies--in the case of Dabney--of other men. The gesture by\nwhich he had become independent was not quite the splendid, scornful one\nhe'd have liked. The fact that this sort of gesture worked, and nothing\nelse would have, did not make him feel better.\n\nBut he slept.\n\nHe dreamed that he was back at his normal business of producing a\ntelevision show. Nobody but himself cared whether the show went on or\nnot. The actual purpose of all his subordinates seemed to be to cut as\nmany throats among their fellow-workers as possible--in a business way,\nof course--so that by their own survival they might succeed to a better\njob and higher pay. This is what is called the fine spirit of teamwork\nby which things get done, both in private and public enterprise.\n\nIt was a very realistic dream, but it was not restful.\n\nWhile he slept, the world wagged on and the cosmos continued on its\nnormal course. The two moons of Earth--one natural and one\nartificial--swung in splendid circles about. A psychiatrist should not\nbe the means of associ-[Missing text] that planet's divided rings. The\nred spot of Jupiter and the bands on that gas-giant world moved in\norderly fashion about its circumference. Light-centuries away, giant\nCepheid suns expanded monstrously and contracted again, rather more\nrapidly than their gravitational fields could account for. Double stars\nsedately swung about each other. Comets reached their farthest points\nand, mere aggregations of frigid jagged stones and metal, prepared for\nanother plunge back into light and heat and warmth.\n\nAnd various prosaic actions took place on Luna.\n\nWhen Cochrane waked and went back to the hotel-room in use as an office,\nhe found Babs talking confidentially to a woman--girl, rather--whom\nCochrane vaguely remembered. Then he did a double take. He did remember\nher. Three or four years before she'd been the outstanding television\npersonality of the year. She'd been pretty, but not so pretty that you\ndidn't realize that she was a person. She was everything that Marilyn\nWinters was not--and she'd been number two name in television.\n\nCochrane said blankly:\n\n\"Aren't you Alicia Keith?\"\n\nThe girl smiled faintly. She wasn't as pretty as she had been. She\nlooked patient. And an expression of patience, on a woman's face, is\ncertainly not unpleasant. But it isn't glamorous, either.\n\n\"I was,\" she said. \"I married Johnny Simms.\"\n\nCochrane looked at Babs.\n\n\"They live up here,\" explained Babs. \"I pointed him out at the\nswimming-pool the day we got here.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" said Cochrane. \"How--\"\n\n\"Johnny,\" said Alicia, \"has bought into your Spaceways corporation. He\ngot your man West drunk and bought his shares of Spaceway stock.\"\n\nCochrane sat down--not hard, because it was impossible to sit down hard\non the moon. But he sat down as hard as it was possible to sit.\n\n\"Why'd he do that?\"\n\n\"He found out you had hold of the old Mars colony ship. He understands\nyou're going to take a trip out to the stars. He wants to go along. He's\nvery much like a little boy. He hates it here.\"\n\n\"Then why live--.\" Cochrane checked the question, not quite in time.\n\n\"He can't go back to Earth,\" said Alicia calmly. \"He's a psychopathic\npersonality. He's sane and quite bright and rather dear in his way, but\nhe simply can't remember what is right and wrong. Especially when he\ngets excited. When they fixed up Lunar City as an international colony,\nby sheer oversight they forgot to arrange for extradition from it. So\nJohnny can live here. He can't live anywhere else--not for long.\"\n\nCochrane said nothing.\n\n\"He wants to go with you,\" said Alicia pleasantly. \"He's thrilled. The\nlawyer his family keeps up here to watch over him is thrilled, too. He\nwants to go back and visit his family. And as a stockholder, Johnny can\nkeep you from taking a ship or any other corporate property out of the\njurisdiction of the courts. But he'd rather go with you. Of course I\nhave to go too.\"\n\n\"It's blackmail,\" said Cochrane without heat. \"A pretty neat job of it,\ntoo. Babs, you see Holden about this. He's a psychiatrist.\" He turned to\nAlicia. \"Why do you want to go? I don't know whether it'll be dangerous\nor not.\"\n\n\"I married Johnny,\" said Alicia. Her smile was composed. \"I thought it\nwould be wonderful to be able to trust somebody that nobody else could\ntrust.\" After a moment she added: \"It would be, if one could.\"\n\nA few moments later she went away, very pleasantly and very calmly. Her\nhusband had no sense of right or wrong--not in action, anyhow. She tried\nto keep him from doing too much damage by exercising the knowledge she\nhad of what was fair and what was not. Cochrane grimaced and told Babs\nto make a note to talk to Holden. But there were other matters on hand,\ntoo. There were waivers to be signed by everybody who went along off\nLuna. Then Cochrane said thoughtfully:\n\n\"Alicia Keith would be a good name for film-tape ...\"\n\nHe plunged into the mess of paper-work and haggling which somebody has\nto do before any achievement of consequence can come about. Pioneer\nefforts, in particular, require the same sort of clearing-away process\nas the settling of a frontier farm. Instead of trees to be chopped\nand dug up by the roots, there are the gratuitous obstructionists\nwho have to be chopped off at the ankles in a business way, and\nthe people who exercise infinite ingenuity trying to get a cut of\nsomething--anything--somebody else is doing. And of course there are\nthe publicity-hounds. Since Spaceways was being financed on sales of\npublicity which could be turned on this product and that,\npublicity-hounds cut into its revenue and capital.\n\nBack on Earth a crackpot inventor had a lawyer busily garnering free\nadvertisement by press conferences about the injury done his client by\nSpaceways, Inc., who had stolen his invention to travel through space\nfaster than light. Somebody in the Senate made a speech accusing the\nSpaceway project of being a political move by the party in power for\nsome dire ultimate purpose.\n\nUltimately the crackpot inventor would get on the air and announce\ntriumphantly that only part of his invention had been stolen, because\nhe'd been too smart to write it down or tell anybody, and he wouldn't\ntell anybody--not even a court--the full details of his invention unless\npaid twenty-five million in cash down, and royalties afterward. The\nproject for a congressional investigation of Spaceways would die in\ncommittee.\n\nBut there were other griefs. The useless spaceship hulk had to be\nemptied of the mining-tools stored in it. This was done by men working\nin space-suits. Occupational rules required them to exert not more than\none-fourth of the effort they would have done if working for themselves.\nWhen the ship was empty, air was released in it, and immediately froze\nto air-snow. So radiant heaters had to be installed and powered to warm\nup the hull to where an atmosphere could exist in it. Its generators had\nto be thawed from the metal-ice stage of brittleness and warmed to where\nthey could be run without breaking themselves to bits.\n\nBut there were good breaks, too. Presently a former\nmoonship-pilot--grounded to an administrative job on Luna--on his own\nfree time checked over the ship. Jones arranged it. With rocket-motors\nof adamite--the stuff discovered by pure accident in a steel-mill back\non Earth--the propelling apparatus checked out. The fuel-pumps had been\ntaken over in fullness of design from fire-engine pumps on Earth. They\nwere all right. The air-regenerating apparatus had been developed from\nthe aeriating culture-tanks in which antibiotics were grown on Earth. It\nneeded only reseeding with algae--microscopic plants which when supplied\nwith ultraviolet light fed avidly on carbon dioxide and yielded oxygen.\nThe ship was a rather involved combination of essentially simple\ndevices. It could be put back into such workability as it had once\npossessed with practically no trouble.\n\nIt was.\n\nJones moved into it, with masses of apparatus from the laboratory in the\nLunar Apennines. He labored lovingly, fanatically. Like most spectacular\ndiscoveries, the Dabney field was basically simple. It was almost\nidiotically uncomplicated. In theory it was a condition of the space\njust outside one surface of a sheet of metal. It was like that\nconduction-layer on the wires of a cross-country power-cable, when\nelectricity is transmitted in the form of high-frequency alterations and\ntravels on the skins of many strands of metal, because high-frequency\ncurrent simply does not flow inside of wires, but only on their\nsurfaces. The Dabney field formed on the surface--or infinitesimally\nbeyond it--of a metal sheet in which eddy-currents were induced in\nsuch-and-such a varying fashion. That was all there was to it.\n\nSo Jones made the exterior forward surface of the abandoned spaceship\ninto a generator of the Dabney field. It was not only simple, it was too\nsimple! Having made the bow of the ship into a Dabney field plate, he\nimmediately arranged that he could, at will, make the rear of the ship\ninto another Dabney field plate. The two plates, turned on together,\namounted to something that could be contemplated with startled awe, but\nJones planned to start off, at least, in a manner exactly like the\ndistress-torp test. The job of wiring up for faster-than-light travel,\nhowever, was not much more difficult than wiring a bungalow, when one\nknew how it should be done.\n\nTwo freight-rockets came in, picked up by radar and guided to landings\nby remote control. The Lunar City beam receiver picked up music aimed up\nfrom Earth and duly relayed it to the dust-heaps which were the\nbuildings of the city. The colonists and moon-tourists became familiar\nwith forty-two new tunes dealing with prospective travel to the stars.\nOne work of genius tied in a just-released film-tape drama titled\n\"_Child of Hate_\" to the Lunar operation, and charmed listeners saw and\nheard the latest youthful tenor gently plead, \"_Child of Hate, Come to\nthe Stars and Love._\" The publicity department responsible for the\nmasterpiece considered itself not far from genius, too.\n\nThere was confusion thrice and four and five times confounded. Cochrane\ncame in to dispute furiously with Holden whether it was better to have a\npsychopathic personality on the space-ship or to have a legal battle in\nthe courts. Cochrane won. Jones arrived, belligerent, to do battle for\ntechnical devices which would cost money.\n\n\"Look!\" said Cochrane harassedly. \"I'm not trying to boss you! Don't\ncome to me for authority! If you can make that ship take off I'll be in\nit, and my neck will be in as much danger as yours. You buy what will\nkeep my neck as safe as possible, along with yours. I'm busy raising\nmoney and fighting off crackpots and dodging lawsuits and getting\nsupplies! I've got a job that needs three men anyhow. All I'm hoping is\nthat you get ready to take off before I start cutting out paperdolls.\nWhen can we leave?\"\n\n\"We?\" said Jones suspiciously. \"You're going?\"\n\n\"If you think I'll stay behind and face what'll happen if this business\nflops,\" Cochrane told him, \"you're crazy! There are too many people on\nEarth already. There's no room for a man who tried something big and\nfailed! If this flops I'd rather be a frozen corpse with a happy smile\non my face--I understand that in space one freezes--than somebody living\non assisted survival status on Earth!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jones, mollified. \"How many people are to go?\"\n\n\"Ask Bill Holden,\" Cochrane told him. \"Remember, if you need something,\nget it. I'll try to pay for it. If we come back with picture-tapes of\nouter space--even if we only circumnavigate Mars!--we'll have money\nenough to pay for anything!\"\n\nJones regarded Cochrane with something almost like warmth.\n\n\"I like this way of doing business,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not business!\" protested Cochrane. \"This is getting something\ndone! By the way. Have you picked out a destination for us to aim at?\"\nWhen Jones shook his head, Cochrane said harassedly; \"Better get one\npicked out. But when we make out our sail-off papers, for destination\nwe'll say, 'To the stars.' A nice line for the news broadcasts. Oh, yes.\nTell Bill Holden to try to find us a skipper. An astrogator. Somebody\nwho can tell us how to get back if we get anywhere we need to get back\nfrom. Is there such a person?\"\n\n\"I've got him,\" said Jones. \"He checked the ship for me. Former\nmoon-rocket pilot. He's here in Lunar City. Thanks!\"\n\nHe shook hands with Cochrane before he left. Which for Jones was an\nexpression of overwhelming emotion. Cochrane turned back to his desk.\n\n\"Let's see ... That arrangement for cachets on stamps and covers to be\ntaken along and postmarked Outer Space. Put in a stipulation for extra\npayment in case we touch on planets and invent postmarks for them ...\"\n\nHe worked on, while Babs took notes. Presently he was dictating. And as\nhe talked, frowning, he took a fountain-pen from his pocket and absently\nworked the refill-handle. It made ink exude from the pen-point. On the\nmoon, the surface tension of the ink was exactly the same as on earth,\nbut the gravity was five-sixths less. So a drop of ink of really\nimpressive size could be formed before the moon's weak gravity made it\nfall.\n\nDictating as he worked the pen, Cochrane achieved a pear-shaped\nmass of ink which was quite the size of a large grape before it fell\ninto his waste-basket. It was the largest he'd made to date. It\nfell--slow-motion--and splashed--violently--as he regarded it with\nharried satisfaction.\n\nMore time passed. A moon-rocket arrived from Earth. There were new\ntourists under the thousand-foot plastic dome. Out by the former\nMars-ship Jones made experiments with small plastic balloons coated with\na conducting varnish. In a vacuum, a cubic inch of air at Earth-pressure\nwill expand to make many cubic feet of near-vacuum. If a balloon can\nsustain an internal pressure of one ounce to the square foot, a\nthimbleful of air will inflate a sizeable globe to that pressure. Jones\nwas arranging tiny Dabney field robot-generators with tiny atomic\nbatteries to power them. Each such balloon would be a Dabney field\n\"plate\" when cast adrift in emptiness, and its little battery would keep\nit in operation for twenty years or more.\n\nBaggage came up from Earth for Johnny Simms. It was mostly elephant-guns\nand ammunition for them. Johnny, as the heir to innumerable millions\nback on earth, had had a happy life, but hardly one to give him a\npractical view of things. To him, star-travel meant landing on such\nexotic planets as the fictioneers had been writing about for a hundred\nyears or so. He really looked upon the venture into space as a combined\nbig-game expedition and escape from Lunar City. And he did look forward,\ntoo, to freedom from his family's legal representative and the constant\nreminder of ethical and moral values which Johnny preferred happily to\nignore.\n\nFilm-tape came up, and cameras to use it in. Every imaginable item an\nexpedition to space could use or even might use, was thrust upon\nSpaceways, Inc. Manufacturers yearned to have their products used in\nconnection with the hottest news story in decades. There was a steady\ntrailing of moon-jeeps from the airlocks of Lunar City to the ship.\n\nThe time of lunar sunset arrived--503:30 o'clock, half-past five hundred\nand three hours. Time was measured from midnight to midnight,\nastronomical fashion. The great, blazing sun whose streamer prominences,\neven, were too bright to be looked at with the naked eye--the sun neared\nand reached the horizon. There was no change in the star-studded sky.\nThere were no sunset colorings. The incandescent brightness on the\nmountains was not lessened in the least. Only the direction of the stark\nblack shadows shifted.\n\nThe glaring sun descended. Its motion was almost infinitely slow. Its\ndisk was of the order of half a degree of arc, and it took a full hour\nto be fully obscured. And then there was at first no difference in the\nlook of things save that the _Mare Imbrium_--the solidified, arid Sea of\nShowers--was as dark as the shadows in the mountains.\n\nThey still gleamed brightly. For a very long time the white-hot sunshine\nglowed on their flanks. The brightness rose and rose, and blackness\nfollowed it. At long last only the topmost peaks of the Apennines blazed\nluridly against a background of stars whose light seemed feeble by\ncomparison.\n\nThen it was night indeed. But the Earth shone forth, a half-globe of\nseas and clouds and continents, vast and nostalgic in the sky. And now\nEarthshine fell upon the moon. It was many times brighter than moonlight\never was upon the Earth. Even at lunar sunset the Earthlight was sixteen\ntimes brighter. At midnight, when the Earth was full, it would be bright\nenough for any activity. Actually, the human beings on Luna were nearly\nnocturnal in their habits, because it was easier to run moon-jeeps in\nfrigidity and keep men and machines warm enough for functioning, than it\nwas to protect them against the more-than-boiling heat of midday on the\nmoon.\n\nSo the activity about the salvaged space-ship increased. There were\nelectric lights blazing in the demi-twilight, to guide freight vehicles\nwith their loads. The tourist-jeeps went and returned and went and\nreturned. The last shipload of travelers from Earth wanted to see the\nspace-craft about which all the world was talking.\n\nEven Cochrane presently became curious. There came a time when all the\npaper-work connected with what had happened was done with, and\nconditional contracts drawn up on everything that could be foreseen. It\nwas time for something new to happen.\n\nCochrane said dubiously:\n\n\"Babs, have you seen the ship?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"I think we'd better go take a look at it,\" said Cochrane. \"Do you know,\nI've been acting like a damned business man! I've only been out of Lunar\nCity three times. Once to the laboratory to talk, once to test a\nsignal-rocket across the crater, and once when the distress-torp went\noff. I haven't even seen the nightclub here in the City!\"\n\n\"You should,\" said Babs matter-of-factly. \"I went once, with Doctor\nHolden. The dancing was marvelous!\"\n\n\"Bill Holden, eh?\" said Cochrane. He found himself annoyed. \"Took you to\nthe nightclub; but not to see the ship!\"\n\n\"The ship's farther,\" explained Babs. \"I could always be found at the\nnightclub if you needed me. I went when you were asleep.\"\n\n\"Damn!\" said Cochrane. \"Hm ... You ought to get a bonus. What would you\nrather have, Babs, a bonus in cash or Spaceways stock?\"\n\n\"I've got some stock,\" said Babs. \"Mr. Bell--the writer, you know--got\nin a poker game. He was cleaned out. So I gave him all the money I\nhad--I told you I cleared out my savings-account before we came up, I\nthink--for half his shares.\"\n\n\"Either you got very badly stuck,\" Cochrane told her cynically, \"or else\nyou'll be so rich you won't speak to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Babs warmly. \"Never!\"\n\nCochrane yawned.\n\n\"Let's get out and take a look at the ship. Maybe I can stow cargo or\nsomething, now there's no more paper-work.\"\n\nBabs said with an odd calm:\n\n\"Mr. Jones wanted you out there today--in an hour, he said. I promised\nyou'd go. I meant to mention it in time.\"\n\nCochrane did not notice her tone. He was dead-tired, as only a man can\nbe who has driven himself at top speed for days on end over a business\ndeal. Business deals are stimulating only in their major aspects. Most\nof the details are niggling, tedious, routine, and boring--and very\noften bear-trapped. Cochrane had done, with only Babs' help, an amount\nof mental labor that in the offices of Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and\nFallowe would have been divided among two vice-presidents, six lawyers,\nand at least twelve account executives. The work, therefore, would\nactually have been done by not less than twenty secretaries. But Babs\nand Cochrane had done it all.\n\nIn the moon-jeep on the way to the ship he felt that heavy, exhausted\nsense of relaxation which is not pleasurable at all. Babs annoyed him a\nlittle, too. She was late getting to the airlock, and seemed breathless\nwhen she arrived.\n\nThe moon-jeep crunched and clanked and rumbled over the gently\nundulating lava sea beneath its giant wheels. Babs looked zestfully out\nof the windows. The picture was, of course, quite incredible. In the\nrelatively dim Earthlight the moonscape was somehow softened, and yet\nthe impossibly jagged mountains and steep cliffsides and the razor-edged\npasses of monstrous stone,--these things remained daunting. It was like\nriding through a dream in which everything nearby seemed fey and\nglamorous, but the background was deathly-still and ominous.\n\nThere were the usual noises inside the jeep. The air had a metallic\nsmell. One could detect the odors of oil, and ozone, and varnish, and\nplastic upholstery. There were the crunching sounds of the wheels,\ntraveling over stone. There was the paradoxic gentleness of all the\njeep's motions because of the low gravity. Cochrane even noted the\nextraordinary feel of an upholstered seat when one weighs only one-sixth\nas much as back on Earth. All his sensations were dreamlike--but he felt\nthat headachy exhaustion that comes of overwork too long continued.\n\n\"I'll try,\" he said tiredly, \"to see that you have some fun before you\ngo back, Babs. You'll go back as soon as we dive off into whatever we're\ndiving into, but you ought to get in the regular tourist stuff up here,\nanyhow.\"\n\nBabs said nothing. Pointedly.\n\nThe moon-jeep clanked and rumbled onward. The hissing of steam was\naudible. The vehicle swung around a pinnacle of stone, and Cochrane saw\nthe space-ship.\n\nIn the pale Earthlight it was singularly beautiful. It had been designed\nto lure investors in a now-defunct promotion. It was stream-lined, and\ngigantic, and it glittered like silver. It stood upright on its\ntail-fins, and it had lighted ports and electric lights burned in the\nemptiness about it. But there was only one moon-jeep at its base. A\nspace-suited figure moved toward a dangling sling and sat in it. He rose\ndeliberately toward an open airlock-hatch, and the other moon-jeep moved\nsoundlessly away back toward Lunar City.\n\nThere was no debris about. There was no cargo waiting to be loaded.\nCochrane did see a great metal plate, tilted on the ground, with a large\nbox attached to it by cables. That would be the generators and the\nfield-plate for a Dabney field. It was plainly to remain on the moon. It\nwas not underneath the ship. Cochrane puzzled tiredly over it for a\nmoment. Then he understood. The ship would lift on its rockets, hover\nover the plate--which would be generating its half of the field--and\nthen Jones would switch on the apparatus in the ship itself. The\nforward, needle-pointed nose of the ship would become another generator\nof the Dabney field. The ship's inertia, in that field, would be\neffectively reduced to a fraction of its former value. The rockets,\nwhich might give it an acceleration of a few hundred feet per second\nanywhere but in a Dabney field, would immediately accelerate the ship\nand all its contents to an otherwise unattainable velocity. The\noccupants of the rocket would lose their relative inertia to the same\ndegree as the ship. They should feel no more acceleration than from the\nsame rocket-thrust in normal space. But they would travel--\n\nCochrane felt that there was a fallacy somehow, in the working of the\nDabney field as he understood it. If there was less inertia in the\nDabney field--why--a rocket shouldn't push as hard in it, because, it\nwas the inertia of the rocket-gases that gave the rocket-thrust. But\nCochrane was much too tired to work out a theoretic objection to\nsomething he knew did work. He was almost dozing when Babs touched his\narm.\n\n\"Space-suits, Mr. Cochrane.\"\n\nHe got wearily into the clumsy costume. But he saw again that Babs wore\nthe shining-eyed look of rapturous adventure that he had seen her wear\nbefore.\n\nThey got out of the moon-jeep, one after the other. The sling came down\nthe space-ship's gleaming side. They got in it, together. It lifted\nthem.\n\nThe vast, polished hull of the space-ship slid past them only ten feet\naway. The ground diminished. They seemed less to be lifted than to float\nskyward. And in this sling, in this completely unreal ascent, Cochrane\nroused suddenly. He felt the acute unease which comes of height. He had\nlooked down upon Earth from a height of four thousand miles with no\nfeeling of dizziness. He had looked at Earth a quarter-million miles\naway with no consciousness of depth. But a mere fifty feet above the\nsurface of the moon he felt like somebody swinging out of a skyscraper\nwindow.\n\nThen the airlock opening was beside them, and the sling rolled inward.\nThey were in the lock, and Cochrane found himself pushing Babs away from\nthe unrailed opening. He was relieved when the airlock closed.\n\nInside the ship, with the space-suits off, there was light and warmth,\nand a remarkably matter-of-fact atmosphere. The ship had been built to\nsell stock in a scheme for colonizing Mars. Prospective investors had\nbeen shown through it. It had been designed to be a convincing\npassenger-liner of space.\n\nIt was. But Cochrane found himself not needed for any consultation, and\nJones was busy, and Bill Holden highly preoccupied. He saw Alicia\nKeith--but her name was Simms now. She smiled at him but took Babs by\nthe arm. They went off somewhere.\n\nCochrane waited for somebody to tell him what to look at and to admire.\nHe saw Jamison, and Bell, and he saw a man he had not seen before. He\nsettled down in a deeply upholstered chair. He felt neglected. Everybody\nwas busy. But mostly he felt tired.\n\nHe slept.\n\nThen Babs was shaking his arm, her eyes shining.\n\n\"Mr. Cochrane!\" she cried urgently. \"Mr. Cochrane! Wake up! Go on up to\nthe control-room! We're going to take off!\"\n\nHe blinked at her.\n\n\"We!\" Then he started up, and went five feet into the air from the\nviolence of his uncalculated movement. \"We? No you don't! You go back to\nLunar City where you'll be safe!\"\n\nThen he heard a peculiar drumming, rumbling noise. He had heard it\nbefore. In the moonship. It was rockets being tested; being burned;\nrockets in the very last seconds of preparation before take-off for the\nstars.\n\nHe didn't drop back to the floor beside the chair he'd occupied. The\nfloor rose to meet him.\n\n\"I've had our baggage brought on board,\" said Babs, happily. \"I'm going\nbecause I'm a stockholder! Hold on to something and climb those stairs\nif you want to see us go up! I'm going to be busy!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\n\nThe physical sensations of ascending to the ship's control-room were\nweird in the extreme. Cochrane had just been wakened from a worn-out\nsleep, and it was always startling on the moon to wake and find one's\nself weighing one-sixth of normal. It took seconds to remember how one\ngot that way. But on the way up the stairs, Cochrane was further\nconfused by the fact that the ship was surging this way and swaying\nthat. It moved above the moon's surface to get over the tilted flat\nDabney field plate on the ground a hundred yards from the ship's\noriginal position.\n\nThe Dabney field, obviously, was not in being. The ship hovered on its\nrockets. They had been designed to lift it off of Earth--and they\nhad--against six times the effective gravity here, and with an\nacceleration of more gravities on top of that. So the ship rose lightly,\nalmost skittishly. When gyros turned to make it drift sidewise--as a\nhelicopter tilts in Earth's atmosphere--it fairly swooped to a new\nposition. Somebody jockeyed it this way and that.\n\nCochrane got to the control-room by holding on with both hands to\nrailings. He was angry and appalled.\n\nThe control-room was a hemisphere, with vertical vision-screens\npicturing the stars overhead. Jones stood in an odd sort of harness\nbeside a set of control-switches that did not match the smoothly\ndesigned other controls of the ship. He looked out of a plastic blister,\nby which he could see around and below the ship. He made urgent signals\nto a man Cochrane had never seen before, who sat in a strap-chair before\nmany other complex controls with his hands playing back and forth upon\nthem. A loudspeaker blatted unmusically. It was Dabney's voice, highly\nagitated and uneasy.\n\n\"_ ... my work for the advancement of science has been applied by other\nminds. I need to specify that if the experiment now about to begin does\nnot succeed, it will not invalidate my discovery, which has been amply\nverified by other means. It may be, indeed, that my discovery is so far\nahead of present engineering--._\"\n\n\"See here!\" raged Cochrane. \"You can't take off with Babs on board! This\nis dangerous!\"\n\nNobody paid any attention. Jones made frantic gestures to indicate the\nmost delicate of adjustments. The man in the strap-chair obeyed the\ninstruction with an absorbed attention. Jones suddenly threw a switch.\nSomething lighted, somewhere. There was a momentary throbbing sound\nwhich was not quite a sound.\n\n\"Take it away,\" said Jones in a flat voice.\n\nThe man in the strap-chair pressed hard on the controls. Cochrane\nglanced desperately out of one of the side ports. He saw the\nmoonscape--the frozen lava sea with its layer of whitish-tan moondust.\nHe saw many moon-jeeps gathered near, as if most of the population of\nLunar City had been gathered to watch this event. He saw the\nextraordinary nearness of the moon's horizon.\n\nBut it was the most momentary of glimpses. As he opened his mouth to\nroar a protest, he felt the upward, curiously comforting thrust of\nacceleration to one full Earth-gravity.\n\nThe moonscape was snatched away from beneath the ship. It did not\ndescend. The ship did not seem to rise. The moon itself diminished and\nvanished like a pricked bubble. The speed of its disappearance was\nnot--it specifically was not--attributable to one earth-gravity of lift\napplied on a one-sixth-gravity moon.\n\nThe loudspeaker hiccoughed and was silent. Cochrane uttered the roar he\nhad started before the added acceleration began. But it was useless. Out\nthe side-port, he saw the stars. They were not still and changeless and\nwinking, as they appeared from the moon. These stars seemed to stir\nuneasily, to shift ever so slightly among themselves, like flecks of\nbright color drifting on a breeze.\n\nJones said in an interested voice:\n\n\"Now we'll try the booster.\"\n\nHe threw another switch. And again there was a momentary throbbing sound\nwhich was not quite a sound. It was actually a sensation, which one\nseemed to feel all through one's body. It lasted only the fraction of a\nsecond, but while it lasted the stars out the side-ports ceased to be\nstars. They became little lines of light, all moving toward the ship's\nstern but at varying rates of speed. Some of them passed beyond view.\nSome of them moved only a little. But all shifted.\n\nThen they were again tiny spots of light, of innumerable tints and\ncolors, of every conceivably degree of brightness, stirring and moving\never-so-slightly with relation to each other.\n\n\"The devil!\" said Cochrane, raging.\n\nJones turned to him. And Jones was not quite poker-faced, now. Not\nquite. He looked even pleased. Then his face went back to impassiveness\nagain.\n\n\"It worked,\" he said mildly.\n\n\"I know it worked!\" sputtered Cochrane. \"But--where are we? How far did\nwe come?\"\n\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" said Jones mildly as before. \"Does it\nmatter?\"\n\nCochrane glared at him. Then he realized how completely too late it was\nto protest anything.\n\nThe man he had seen absorbed in the handling of controls now lifted his\nhands from the board. The rockets died. There was a vast silence, and\nweightlessness. Cochrane weighed nothing. This was free flight\nagain--like practically all of the ninety-odd hours from the space\nplatform to the moon. The pilot left the controls and in an accustomed\nfashion soared to a port on the opposite side of the room. He gazed out,\nand then behind, and said in a tone of astonished satisfaction:\n\n\"This is good!--There's the sun!\"\n\n\"How far?\" asked Jones.\n\n\"It's fifth magnitude,\" said the pilot happily. \"We really did pile on\nthe horses!\"\n\nJones looked momentarily pleased again. Cochrane said in a voice that\neven to himself sounded outraged:\n\n\"You mean the sun's a fifth-magnitude star from here? What the devil\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Booster,\" said Jones, nearly with enthusiasm. \"When the field was just\na radiation speed-up, I used forty milliamperes of current to the square\ncentimetre of field-plate. That was the field-strength when we sent the\nsignal-rocket across the crater. For the distress-torpedo test, I\nstepped the field-strength up. I used a tenth of an ampere per square\ncentimetre. I told you! And don't you remember that I wondered what\nwould happen if I used a capacity-storage system?\"\n\nCochrane held fast to a hand-hold.\n\n\"The more power you put into your infernal field,\" he demanded, \"the\nmore speed you get?\"\n\nJones said contentedly:\n\n\"There's a limit. It depends on the temperature of the things in the\nfield. But I've fixed up the field, now, like a spot-welding outfit.\nLike a strobe-light. We took off with a light field. It's on now--we\nhave to keep it on. But I got hold of some pretty storage condensers. I\nhooked them up in parallel to get a momentary surge of high-amperage\ncurrent when I shorted them through my field-making coils. Couldn't make\nit a steady current! Everything would blow! But I had a surge of\nprobably six amps per square centimetre for a while.\"\n\nCochrane swallowed.\n\n\"The field was sixty times as strong as the one the distress-torpedo\nused? We went--we're going--sixty times as fast?\"\n\n\"We had lots more speed than that!\" But then Jones' enthusiasm dwindled.\n\"I haven't had time to check,\" he said unhappily. \"It's one of the\nthings I want to get at right away. But in theory the field should\nmodify the effect of inertia as the fourth power of its strength. Sixty\nto the fourth is--.\"\n\n\"How far,\" demanded Cochrane, \"is Proxima Centaurus? That's the nearest\nstar to Earth. How near did we come to reaching it?\"\n\nThe pilot on the other side of the control-room said with a trace less\nthan his former zest:\n\n\"That looks like Sirius, over there ...\"\n\n\"We didn't head for Proxima Centaurus,\" said Jones mildly. \"It's too\nclose! And we have to keep the field-plate back on the moon lined up\nwith us, more or less, so we headed out roughly along the moon's axis.\nToward where its north pole points.\"\n\n\"Then where are we headed? Where are we going?\"\n\n\"We're not going anywhere just yet,\" said Jones without interest. \"We\nhave to find out where we are, and from that--\"\n\nCochrane ran his hand through his hair.\n\n\"Look!\" he protested. \"Who's running this show? You didn't tell me you\nwere going to take off! You didn't pick out a destination! You didn't--\"\n\nJones said very patiently:\n\n\"We have to try out the ship. We have to find out how fast it goes with\nhow much field and how much rocket-thrust. We have to find out how far\nwe went and if it was in a straight line. We even have to find out how\nto land! The ship's a new piece of apparatus. We can't do things with it\nuntil we find out what it can do.\"\n\nCochrane stared at him. Then he swallowed.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"The financial and business department of Spaceways,\nInc., has done its stuff for the time being.\"\n\nJones nodded.\n\n\"The technical staff now takes over?\"\n\nJones nodded again.\n\n\"I still think,\" said Cochrane, \"that we could have done with a little\ninterdepartmental cooperation. How long before you know what you're\nabout?\"\n\nJones shook his head.\n\n\"I can't even guess. Ask Babs to come up here, will you?\"\n\nCochrane threw up his hands. He went toward the\nspiral-ladder-with-handholds that led below. He went down into the main\nsaloon. A tiny green light winked on and off, urgently, on the far side.\nBabs was seated at a tiny board, there. As Cochrane looked, she pushed\nbuttons with professional skill. Bill Holden sat in a strap-chair with\nhis face a greenish hue.\n\n\"We took off,\" said Holden in a strained voice.\n\n\"We did,\" said Cochrane. \"And the sun's a fifth magnitude star from\nwhere we've got to--which is no place in particular. And I've just found\nout that we started off at random and Jones and the pilot he picked up\nare now happily about to do some pure-science research!\"\n\nHolden closed his eyes.\n\n\"When you want to cheer me up,\" he said feebly, \"you can tell me we're\nabout to crash somewhere and this misery will soon be over.\"\n\nCochrane said bitterly:\n\n\"Taking off without a destination! Letting Babs come along! They don't\nknow how far we've come and they don't know where we're going! This is a\nhell of a way to run a business!\"\n\n\"Who called it a business?\" asked Holden, as feebly as before. \"It\nstarted out as a psychiatric treatment!\"\n\nBabs' voice came from the side of the saloon where she sat at a\nvision-tube and microphone. She was saying professionally:\n\n\"I assure you it's true. We are linked to you by the Dabney field, in\nwhich radiation travels much faster than light. When you were a little\nboy didn't you ever put a string between two tin cans, and then talk\nalong the string?\"\n\nCochrane stopped beside her scowling. She looked up.\n\n\"The press association men on Luna, Mr. Cochrane. They saw us take off,\nand the radar verified that we traveled some hundred of thousands of\nmiles, but then we simply vanished! They don't understand how they can\ntalk to us without even the time-lag between Earth and Lunar City. I was\nexplaining.\"\n\n\"I'll take it,\" said Cochrane. \"Jones wants you in the control-room.\nCameras? Who was handling the cameras?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bell,\" said Babs briskly. \"It's his hobby, along with poker-playing\nand children.\"\n\n\"Tell him to get some pictures of the star-fields around us,\" said\nCochrane, \"and then you can see what Jones wants. I will do a little\nbusiness!\"\n\nHe settled down in the seat Babs had vacated. He faced the two\npress-association reporters in the screen. They had seen the ship's take\noff. It was verified beyond any reasonable question. The microwave beam\nto Earth was working at capacity to transmit statements from the Moon\nObservatory, which annoyedly conceded that the Spaceways, Inc., salvaged\nship had taken off with an acceleration beyond belief. But, the\nastronomers said firmly, the ship and all its contents must necessarily\nhave been destroyed by the shock of their departure. The acceleration\nmust have been as great as the shock of a meteor hitting Luna.\n\n\"You can consider,\" Cochrane told them, \"that I am now an angel, if you\nlike. But how about getting a statement from Dabney?\"\n\nA press-association man, back on Luna, uttered the first profanity ever\nto travel faster than light.\n\n\"All he can talk about,\" he said savagely, \"is how wonderful he is! He\nagrees with the Observatory that you must all be dead. He said so. Can\nyou give us any evidence that you're alive and out in space? Visual\nevidence, for broadcast?\"\n\nAt this moment the entire fabric of the space-ship moved slightly. There\nwas no sound of rockets. The ship seemed to turn a little, but that was\nall. No gravity. No acceleration. It was a singularly uncomfortable\nsensation, on top of the discomfort of weightlessness.\n\nCochrane said sardonically:\n\n\"If you can't take my word that I'm alive, I'll try to get you some\nproof! Hm. I'll send you some pictures of the star-fields around us.\nShoot them to observatories back on Earth and let them figure out for\nthemselves where we are! Displacement of the relative positions of the\nstars ought to let them figure things out!\"\n\nHe left the communicator-board. Holden still looked greenish in his\nstrap-chair. The main saloon was otherwise empty. Cochrane made his way\ngingerly to the stair going below. He stepped into thin air and\ndescended by a pull on the hand-rail.\n\nThis was the dining-saloon. The ship having been built to impress\ninvestors in a stock-sales enterprise, it had been beautifully equipped\nwith trimmings. And, having had to rise from Earth to Luna, and needing\nto take an acceleration of a good many gravities, it had necessarily to\nbe reasonably well-built. It had had, in fact, to be an honest job of\nship-building in order to put across a phoney promotion. But there were\ntrimmings that could have been spared. The ports opening upon emptiness,\nfor example, were not really practical arrangements. But everybody but\nHolden and the two men in the control-room now clustered at those ports,\nlooking out at the stars. There was Jamison and Bell the writer, and\nJohnny Simms and his wife. Babs had been here and gone.\n\nBell was busy with a camera. As Cochrane moved to tell him of the need\nfor star-shots to prove to a waiting planet that they were alive, Johnny\nSimms turned and saw Cochrane. His expression was amiable and unawed.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Johnny Simms cheerfully.\n\nCochrane nodded curtly.\n\n\"I bought West's stock in Spaceways,\" said Johnny Simms, amusedly,\n\"because I want to come along. Right?\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" said Cochrane, as curtly as before.\n\n\"West said,\" Johnny Simms told him gleefully, \"that he was going back to\nEarth, punch Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe on their separate\nnoses, and then go down to South Carolina and raise edible snails for\nthe rest of his life.\"\n\n\"An understandable ambition,\" said Cochrane. He frowned, waiting to talk\nto Bell, who was taking an infernally long time to focus a camera out of\na side-port.\n\n\"It's going to be good when he tries to cash my check,\" said Johnny\nSimms delightedly. \"I stopped payment on it when he wouldn't pick up\nthe tab for some drinks I invited him to have!\"\n\nCochrane forced his face to impassiveness. Johnny Simms was that way, he\nunderstood. He was a psychopathic personality. He was completely\ninsensitive to notions of ethics. Ideas of right and wrong were as\ncompletely meaningless to him as tones to a tone-deaf person, or pastel\ntints to a man who is color-blind. They simply didn't register. His mind\nwas up to par, and he could be a charming companion. He could experience\nthe most kindly of emotions and most generous of impulses, which he put\ninto practice. But he also had a normal person's impulse to less\nadmirable behavior, and he simply could not understand that there was\nany difference between impulses. He put the unpleasing ones into\npractice too. He'd been on the moon to avoid extradition because of past\nimpulses which society called murderous. On this ship it was yet to be\ndiscovered what he would do--but because he was technically sane his\nlawyers could have prevented a take off unless he came along. Cochrane,\nat the moment, felt an impulse to heave him out an airlock as a probable\ndanger. But Cochrane was not a psychopathic personality.\n\nHe stopped Bell in his picture-taking and looked at the first of the\nprints. They were excellent. He went back to the vision-set to transmit\nthem back to Luna. He sent them off. They would be forwarded to\nobservatories on Earth and inspected. They literally could not be faked.\nThere were thousands of stars on each print--with the Milky Way for\nbackground on some--and each of those thousands of stars would be\nidentified, and each would have changed its relative position from that\nseen on earth, with relation to every other star. Astronomers could\ndetect the spot from which the picture had been taken. But to fake a\nsingle print would have required years of computation and almost\ncertainly there would have been slip-ups somewhere. These pictures were\nunassailable evidence that a human expedition had reached a point in\nspace that had been beyond all human dreaming.\n\nThen Cochrane had nothing to do. He was a supernumerary member of the\ncrew. The pilot and Jones were in charge of the ship. Jamison would take\ncare of the catering, when meal-time came. Probably Alicia Keith--no,\nAlicia Simms--would help. Nothing else needed attention. The rockets\neither worked or they didn't. The air-apparatus needed no supervision.\nCochrane found himself without a function.\n\nHe went restlessly back to the control-room. He found Babs looking\nhelpless, and Jones staring blankly at a slip of paper in his hands,\nwhile the pilot was still at a blister-port, staring at the stars\nthrough one of those squat, thick telescopes used on Luna for the\nexamination of the planets.\n\n\"How goes the research?\" asked Cochrane.\n\n\"We're stumped,\" said Jones painfully. \"I forgot something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Whenever I wanted anything,\" said Jones, \"I wrote it out and gave a\nmemo to Babs. She attended to it.\"\n\n\"My system, exactly,\" admitted Cochrane.\n\n\"I wrote out a memo for her,\" said Jones unhappily, \"asking for\nstar-charts and for her to get somebody to set up a system of\nastrogation for outside the solar system. Nobody's ever bothered to do\nthat before. Nobody's ever reached even Mars! But I figured we'd need\nit.\"\n\nCochrane waited. Jones showed him a creased bit of paper, closely\nwritten.\n\n\"I wrote out the memo and put it in my pocket,\" said Jones, \"and I\nforgot to give it to Babs. So we can't astrogate. We don't know how. We\ndidn't get either star-charts or instructions. We're lost.\"\n\nCochrane waited.\n\n\"Apparently Al was mistaken in the star he spotted as our sun,\" added\nJones. He referred to the pilot, whom Cochrane had not met before.\n\"Anyhow we can't find it again. We turned the ship to look at some more\nstars, and we can't pick it out any more.\"\n\nCochrane said:\n\n\"You'll keep looking, of course.\"\n\n\"For what?\" asked Jones.\n\nHe waved his hand out the four equally-spaced plastic blister-ports.\nFrom where he stood, Cochrane could see thousands of thousands of stars\nout those four small openings. They were of every conceivable color and\ndegree of brightness. The Milky Way was like a band of diamonds.\n\n\"We know the sun's a yellow star,\" said Jones, \"but we don't know how\nbright it should be, or what the sky should look like beyond it.\"\n\n\"Constellations?\" asked Cochrane.\n\n\"Find 'em!\" said Jones vexedly.\n\nCochrane didn't try. If a moon-rocket pilot could not spot familiar\nstar-groups, a television producer wasn't likely to see them. And it was\nobvious, once one thought, that the brighter stars seen from Earth would\nbe mostly the nearer ones. If Jones was right in his guess that his\nbooster had increased the speed of the ship by sixty to the fourth\npower, it would have gone some millions of times as fast as the\ndistress-torpedo, for a brief period (the ratio was actually something\nover nineteen million times) and it happened that nobody had been able\nto measure the speed of that test-object.\n\nCochrane was no mathematician, but he could see that there was no data\nfor computation on hand. After one found out how fast an acceleration of\none Earth-gravity in a Dabney field of such-and-such strength speeded up\na ship, something like dead reckoning could be managed. But all that\ncould be known right now was that they had come a long way.\n\nHe remembered a television show he'd produced, laid in space on an\nimaginary voyage. The script-writer had had one of the characters say\nthat no constellation would be visible at a hundred light-years from the\nsolar system. It would be rather like a canary trying to locate the\nwindow he'd escaped from, from a block away, with no memories of the\nflight from it.\n\nCochrane said suddenly, in a pleased tone:\n\n\"This is a pretty good break--if we can keep them from finding out about\nit back home! We'll have an entirely new program, good for a\nthirteen-week sequence, on just this!\"\n\nBabs stared at him.\n\n\"Main set, this control-room,\" said Cochrane enthusiastically. \"We'll\nget a long-beard scientist back home with a panel of experts. We'll\ndiscuss our problems here! We'll navigate from home, with the whole\nbusiness on the air! We'll have audience-identification up to a record!\nEverybody on Earth will feel like he's here with us, sharing our\nproblems!\"\n\nJones said irritably:\n\n\"You don't get it! We're lost! We can't check our speed without knowing\nwhere we are and how far we've come! We can't find out what the ship\nwill do when we can't find out what it's done! Don't you see?\"\n\nCochrane said patiently:\n\n\"I know! But we're in touch with Luna through the Dabney field that got\nus here! It transmitted radiation before, faster than light. It's\ntransmitting voice and pictures now. Now we set up a television show\nwhich pays for our astrogation and lets the world sit in on the prettier\naspects of our travels. Hm.... How long before you can sit down on a\nplanet, after you have all the navigational aids of--say--the four best\nobservatories on Earth to help you? I'll arrange for a sponsor--.\"\n\nHe went happily down the stairs again. This was a spiral stair, and he\nzestfully spun around it as he went to the next deck below. At the\nbottom he called up to Babs:\n\n\"Babs! Get Bell and Alicia Keith and come along to take dictation! I'm\ngoing to need some legal witnesses for the biggest deal in the history\nof advertising, made at several times the speed of light!\"\n\nAnd he went zestfully to the communicator to set it up.\n\nAnd time passed. Data arrived, which at once solved Jones' and the\npilot's problem of where they were and how far they had come--it was,\nactually, 178.3 light-years--and they spent an hour making further tests\nand getting further determinations, and then they got a destination.\n\nThey stopped in space to extrude from the airlock a small package which\nexpanded into a forty-foot plastic balloon with a minute atomic battery\nattached to it. The plastic was an electric conductor. It was a\nfield-plate of the Dabney field. It took over the field from Earth and\nmaintained it. It provided a second field for the ship to maintain. The\nship, then, could move at any angle from the balloon. The Dabney field\nstretched 178.3 light-years through emptiness to the balloon, and then\nat any desired direction to the ship.\n\nThe ship's rockets thrust again--and the booster-circuit came into play.\nThere were maneuverings. A second balloon was put out in space.\n\nAt 8:30 Central U. S. Time, on a period relinquished by other\nadvertisers--bought out--a new program went on the air. It was a\nhalf-hour show, sponsored by the Intercity Credit Corporation--\"Buy on\nCredit Guaranteed\"--with ten straight minutes of commercials interjected\nin four sections. It was the highest-priced show ever put on the air. It\nshowed the interior of the ship's control-rooms, with occasional brief\nswitches to authoritative persons on Earth for comment on what was\nrelayed from the far-off skies.\n\nThe first broadcast ensured the success of the program beyond possible\ndispute. It started with curt conversation between Jones and the pilot,\nAl--Jones loathed this part of it, but Al turned out to be something of\na ham--on the problems of approaching a new solar system. Cut to\ncomputers back on Earth. Back to the control-room of the starship.\nPictures of the local sun, and comments on its differentness from the\nsun that had nourished the human race since time began.\n\nThen the cameras--Bell worked them--panned down through the ship's\nblister-ports. There was a planet below. The ship descended toward it.\nIt swelled visibly as the space-ship approached. Cochrane stood out of\ncamera-range and acted as director as well as producer of the opus. He\nused even Johnny Simms as an offstage voice repeating stern commands. It\nwas corny. There was no doubt about it. It had a large content of ham.\n\nBut it happened to be authentic. The ship had reached another planet,\nwith vast ice-caps and what appeared to be no more than a\ntwenty-degree-wide equatorial belt where there was less than complete\nglaciation. The rockets roared and boomed as the ship let down into the\ncloud-layers.\n\nTelevision audiences back on Earth viewed the new planet nearly as soon\nas did those in the ship. The time-lag was roughly three seconds for a\ndistance of 203.7 light-years.\n\nThe surface of the planet was wild and dramatic beyond belief. There\nwere valleys where vegetation grew luxuriantly. There were ranges of\nsnow-clad mountains interpenetrating the equatorial strip, and there\nwere masses of white which, as the ship descended, could be identified\nas glaciers moving down toward the vegetation.\n\nBut as the ship sank lower and lower--and the sound of its rockets\nbecame thunderous because of the atmosphere around it--a new feature\ntook over the central position in one's concept of what the planet was\nactually like.\n\nThe planet was volcanic. There were smoking cones everywhere--in the\nsnow-fields, among the ice-caps, in between the glaciers, and even among\nthe tumbled areas whose greenness proved that here was an environment\nwhich might be perilous, but where life should thrive abundantly.\n\nThe ship continued to descend toward a great forest near a terminal\nmoraine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\n\nJamison declaimed, wearing a throat-mike as Bell zestfully panned his\ncamera and the ship swung down. It was an impressive broadcast. The\nrockets roared. With the coming of air about the ship, they no longer\nmade a mere rumbling. They created a tumult which was like the growl of\nthunder if one were in the midst of the thunder-cloud. It was a numbing\nnoise. It was almost a paralyzing noise. But Jamison talked with\nprofessional smoothness.\n\n\"This planet,\" he orated, while pictures from Bell's camera went direct\nto the transmitter below, \"this planet is the first world other than\nEarth on which a human ship has landed. It is paradoxic that before men\nhave walked on Mars' red iron-oxide plains and breathed its thin cold\nair, or fought for life in the formaldehyde gales of Venus, that they\nshould look upon a world which welcomes them from illimitable\nremoteness. Here we descend, and all mankind can watch our descent upon\na world whose vegetation is green; whose glaciers prove that there is\nair and water in plenty, whose very smoking volcanoes assure us of its\nclose kinship to Earth!\"\n\nHe lifted the mike away from his throat and framed words with his lips.\n\"_Am I still on?_\" Cochrane nodded. Cochrane wore headphones carrying\nwhat the communicator carried, as this broadcast went through an angled\nDabney field relay system back to Lunar City and then to Earth. He spoke\nclose to Jamison's ear.\n\n\"Go ahead! If your voice fades, it will be the best possible sign-off.\nSuspense. Good television!\"\n\nJamison let the throat-mike back against his skin. The roaring of the\nrockets would affect it only as his throat vibrated from the sound. It\nwould register, even so.\n\n\"I see,\" said Jamison above the rocket-thunder, \"forests of giant trees\nlike the sequoias of Mother Earth. I see rushing rivers, foaming along\ntheir rocky beds, taking their rise in glaciers. We are still too high\nto look for living creatures, but we descend swiftly. Now we are level\nwith the highest of the mountains. Now we descend below their smoking\ntops. Under us there is a vast valley, miles wide, leagues long. Here a\ncity could be built. Over it looms a gigantic mountain-spur, capped with\ngreen. One would expect a castle to be built there.\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows at Cochrane. They were well in atmosphere, now,\nand it had been an obvious defect--condition--necessity of the Dabney\nfield that both of its plates should be in a vacuum. One was certainly\nin air now. But Cochrane made that gesture which in television\nproduction-practice informs the actors that time to cutting is measured\nin tens of seconds, and he held up two fingers. Twenty seconds.\n\n\"We gaze, and you gaze with us,\" said Jamison, \"upon a world that future\ngenerations will come to know as home--the site of the first human\ncolony among the stars!\"\n\nCochrane began to beat time. Ten, nine, eight--.\n\n\"We are about to land,\" Jamison declaimed. \"We do not know what we shall\nfind--What's that?\" He paused dramatically. \"A living creature?--A\nliving creature sighted down below! We sign off now--from the stars!\"\n\nThe ending had been perfectly timed. Allowing for a three-second\ninterval for the broadcast to reach the moon, and just about two more\nfor it to be relayed to Earth, his final word, \"Stars!\" had been uttered\nat the precise instant to allow a four-minute commercial by Intercity\nCredit, in the United States, by Citroen in Europe, by Fabricanos Unidos\nin South and Central America, and Near East Oil along the Mediterranean.\nAt the end of that four minutes it would be time for station\nidentification and a time-signal, and the divers eight-second flashes\nbefore other programs came on the air.\n\nThe rockets roared and thundered. The ship went down and down. Jamison\nsaid:\n\n\"I thought we'd be cut off when we hit air!\"\n\n\"That's what Jones thought,\" Cochrane assured him. He bellowed above the\noutside tumult, \"Bell! See anything alive down below?\"\n\nBell shook his head. He stayed at the camera aimed out a blister-port,\nstoring up film-tape for later use. There was the feel of gravitation,\nnow. Actually, it was the fact that the ship slowed swiftly in its\ndescent.\n\nCochrane went to a port. The ship continued its descent.\n\n\"Living creature? Where?\"\n\nJamison shrugged. He had used it as a sign-off line. An extrapolation\nfrom the fact that there was vegetation below. He looked somehow\ndistastefully out the port at a swiftly rising green ground below. He\nwas a city man. He had literally never before seen what looked like\nhabitable territory of such vast extent, with no houses on it. In a\nvalley easily ten miles long and two wide, there was not a square inch\nof concrete or of glass. There was not a man made object in view. The\nsky was blue and there were clouds, but to Jamison the sight of\nvegetation implied rooftops. There ought to be parapets where roofs\nended to let light down to windows and streets below. He had never\nbefore seen grass save on elevated recreation-areas, nor bushes not\narranged as landscaping, and certainly not trees other than the\ndomesticated growths which can grow on the tops of buildings. To Jamison\nthis was desolation. On the moon, absence of structures was\nunderstandable. There was no air. But here there should be a city!\n\nThe ship swayed a little as the rockets swung their blasts to balance\nthe descending mass. The intended Mars-ship slowed, and slowed, and\nhovered--and there was terrifying smoke and flame suddenly all\nabout--and then there was a distinct crunching impact. The rockets\ncontinued to burn, their ferocity diminished. They slackened again. And\nyet again. They were reduced to a mere faint murmur.\n\nThere was a remarkable immobility of everything. It was the result of\ngravity. Earth-value gravity, or very near it. There was a distinct\npressure of one's feet against the floor, and a feeling of heaviness to\none's body which was very different from Lunar City, and more different\nstill from free flight in emptiness.\n\nNothing but swirling masses of smoke could be seen out the ports. They\nhad landed in a forest, of sorts, and the rocket-blasts had burned away\neverything underneath, down to solid soil. In a circle forty yards about\nthe ship the ground was a mass of smoking, steaming ash. Beyond that\nflames licked hungrily, creating more dense vapor. Beyond that still\nthere was only coiling smoke.\n\nCochrane's headphones yielded Babs' voice, almost wailing:\n\n\"_Mr. Cochrane! We must have landed! I want to see!_\"\n\nCochrane pressed the hand-mike button.\n\n\"Are we still hooked up to Lunar City?\" he demanded. \"We can't be, but\nare we?\"\n\n\"_We are_,\" said Babs' voice mutinously. \"_The broadcast went through\nall right. They want to talk to you. Everybody wants to talk to you!_\"\n\n\"Tell them to call back later,\" commanded Cochrane. \"Then leave the beam\nworking--however it works!--and come up if you like. Tell the moon\noperator you'll be away for ten minutes.\"\n\nHe continued to stare out the window. Al, the pilot, stayed in his\ncushioned seat before the bank of rocket-controls. The rockets were\nbarely alight. The ship stayed as it had landed, upright on its triple\nfins. He said to Jones:\n\n\"It feels like we're solid. We won't topple!\"\n\nJones nodded. The rocket-sound cut off. Nothing happened.\n\n\"I think we could have saved fuel on that landing,\" said Jones. Then he\nadded, pleased, \"Nice! The Dabney field's still on! It has to be started\nin a vacuum, but it looks like it can hold air away from itself once\nit's established. Nice!\"\n\nBabs rushed up the stairs. She gazed impassionedly out of a vision-port.\nThen she said disappointedly:\n\n\"It looks like--\"\n\n\"It looks like hell,\" said Cochrane. \"Just smoke and steam and stuff. We\ncan hope, though, that we haven't started a forest fire, but have just\nburned off a landing-place.\"\n\nThey stared out. Presently they went to another port and gazed out of\nthat. The smoke was annoying, and yet it could have been foreseen. A\nmoon-rocket, landing at its space-port on Earth, heated the tarmac to\nred-hotness in the process of landing. Tender-vehicles had to wait for\nit to cool before they could approach. Here the ship had landed in\nwoodland. Naturally its flames had seared the spot where it came down.\nAnd there was inflammable stuff about, which caught fire. So the ship\nwas in the situation of a phoenix, necessarily nesting in a\nconflagration. Anywhere it landed the same thing would apply, unless it\ntried landing on a glacier. But then it would settle down into a lake of\nboiling water, amid steam, and could expect to be frozen in as soon as\nits landing-place cooled.\n\nNow there was nothing to do. They had to wait. Once the whole ship\nquivered very slightly, as if the ground trembled faintly under it. But\nthere was nothing at which to be alarmed.\n\nThey could see that this particular forest was composed mainly of two\nkinds of trees which burned differently. One had a central trunk, and it\nburned with resinous flames and much black and gray-black smoke. The\nother was a curious growth--a solid, massive trunk which did not touch\nground at all, but was held up by aerial roots which supported it aloft\nthrough very many slender shafts widely spread. Possibly the heavier\npart was formed on the ground and lifted as its air-roots grew.\n\nIt was irritating, though, to be unable to see from the ship so long as\nthe fire burned outside. The pall of smoke lasted for a long time. In\nthree hours there were no longer any fiercely blazing areas, but the\nashes still smouldered and smoke still rose. In three hours and a half,\nthe local sun began to set. There were colorings in the sky, beyond all\ncomparison glorious. Which was logical enough. When Krakatoa, back on\nEarth, blew itself to bits in the eighteen hundreds, it sent such\nvolumes of dust into the air that sunsets all around the globe were\nnotably improved for three years afterward. On this planet, smoking\ncones were everywhere visible. Volcanic dust, then, made nightfall\nmagnificent past description. There was not only gold and crimson in the\nwest. The zenith itself glowed carmine and yellow, and those in the\nspace-ship gazed up at a sky such as none of them could have imagined\npossible.\n\nThe colors changed and changed, from yellow to gold all over the sky,\nand still the glory continued. Presently there was a deep, deep red,\ndeep past imagining, and presently faint bluish stars pierced it, and\nthey stared up at new strange constellations-some very bright\nindeed--and all about the ship there was a bed of white ash with glowing\nembers in it, and a thin sheet of white smoke still flowed away down the\nvalley.\n\nIt was long after sunset when Cochrane got up from the communicator.\nCommunication with Earth was broken at last. There was a balloon out in\nspace somewhere with an atomic battery maintaining all its surface as a\nDabney field plate. The ship maintained a field between itself and that\nplate. The balloon maintained another field between itself and another\nballoon a mere 178.3 light-years from the solar system. But the\nsubstance of this planet intervened between the nearer balloon and the\nship. Jones made tests and observed that the field continued to exist,\nbut was plugged by the matter of this newly-arrived-at world. Come\ntomorrow, when there was no solid-stone barrier to the passage of\nradiation, they could communicate with Earth again.\n\nBut Cochrane was weary and now discouraged. So long as talk with Earth\nwas possible, he'd kept at it. There was a great deal of talking to be\ndone. But a good deal of it was extremely unsatisfactory.\n\nHe found Bill Holden having supper with Babs, on the floor below the\ncommunicator. Very much of the recent talk had been over Cochrane's\nhead. He felt humiliated by the indignation of scientists who would not\ntell him what he wanted to know without previous information he could\nnot give.\n\nWhen he went over to the dining-table, he felt that he creaked from\nweariness and dejection. Babs looked at him solicitously, and then\njumped up to get him something to eat. Everybody else was again watching\nout the ship's ports at the new, strange world of which they could see\nnext to nothing.\n\n\"Bill,\" said Cochrane fretfully, \"I've just been given the dressing-down\nof my life! You're expecting to get out of the airlock in the morning\nand take a walk. But I've been talking to Earth. I've been given the\ndevil for landing on a strange planet without bringing along a\nbacteriologist, an organic chemist, an ecologist, an epidemiologist, and\na complete laboratory to test everything with, before daring to take a\nbreath of outside air. I'm warned not to open a port!\"\n\nHolden said:\n\n\"You sound as if you'd been talking to a biologist with a reputation.\nYou ought to know better than that!\"\n\nCochrane protested:\n\n\"I wanted to talk to somebody who knew more than I did! What could I do\nbut get a man with a reputation?\"\n\nHolden shook his head.\n\n\"We psychiatrists,\" he observed, \"go around peeping under the corners of\nrugs at what people try to hide from themselves. We have a worm's-eye\nview of humanity. We know better than to throw a difficult problem at a\nman with an established name! They're neurotic about their reputations.\nLike Dabney, they get panicky at the idea of anybody catching them in a\nmistake. No big name in medicine or biology would dare tell you that of\ncourse it's all right for us to take a walk in the rather pretty\nlandscape outside.\"\n\n\"Then who will?\" demanded Cochrane.\n\n\"We'll make what tests we can,\" said Holden comfortingly, \"and decide\nfor ourselves. We can take a chance. We're only risking our lives!\"\n\nBabs brought Cochrane a plate. He put food in his mouth and chewed and\nswallowed.\n\n\"They say we can't afford to breathe the local air at all until we know\nits bacteriology; we can't touch anything until we test it as a possible\nallergen; we can't.\"\n\nHolden grunted.\n\n\"What would those same authorities have told your friend Columbus? On a\nstrange continent he'd be sure to find strange plants and strange\nanimals. He'd find strange races of men and he ought to find strange\ndiseases. They'd have warned him not to risk it. _They_ wouldn't!\"\n\nCochrane ate with a sort of angry vigor. Then he snapped:\n\n\"If you want to know, we've got to land! We're sunk if we don't go\noutside and move around! We'll spoil our story-line. This is the\ngreatest adventure-serial anybody on Earth ever tuned in to follow! If\nwe back down on exploration, our audience will be disgusted and\nresentful and they'll take it out on our sponsors!\"\n\nBabs said softly, to Holden:\n\n\"That's my boss!\"\n\nCochrane glared at her. He didn't know how to take the comment. He said\nto Holden:\n\n\"Tomorrow we'll try to figure out some sort of test and try the air.\nI'll go out in a space-suit and crack the face-plate! I can close it\nagain before anything lethal gets in. But there's no use stepping out\ninto a bed of coals tonight. I'll have to wait till morning.\"\n\nHolden smiled at him. Babs regarded him with intent, enigmatic eyes.\n\nNeither of them said anything more. Cochrane finished his meal. Then he\nfound himself without an occupation. Gravity on this planet was very\nnearly the same as on Earth. It felt like more, of course, because all\nof them had been subject only to moon-gravity for nearly three weeks.\nJones and the pilot had been in one-sixth gravity for a much longer\ntime. And the absence of gravity had caused their muscles to lose tone\nby just about the amount that the same time spent in a hospital bed\nwould have done. They felt physically worn out.\n\nIt was a healthy tiredness, though, and their muscles would come back\nto normal as quickly as one recovers strength after illness--rather\nfaster, in fact. But tonight there would be no night-life on the\nspace-ship. Johnny Simms disappeared, after symptoms of fretfulness akin\nto those of an over-tired small boy. Jamison gave up, and Bell, and Al\nthe pilot fell asleep while Jones was trying to discuss something\ntechnical with him. Jones himself yawned and yawned and when Al snored\nin his face he gave up. They retired to their bunks.\n\nThere was no point in standing guard over the ship. If the bed of hot\nashes did not guard it, it was not likely that an individual merely\nsitting up and staring out its ports would do much good. There were\nextremely minor, practically unnoticeable vibrations of the ship from\ntime to time. They would be volcanic temblors--to be expected. They were\nnot alarming, certainly, and the forest outside was guarantee of no\ngreat violence to be anticipated. The trees stood firm and tall. There\nwas no worry about the ship. It was perfectly practical, and even\nnecessary simply to turn out the lights and go to sleep.\n\nBut Cochrane could not relax. He was annoyed by the soreness of his\nmuscles. He was irritated by the picture given him of the expedition as\na group of heedless ignoramuses who'd taken off without star-charts or\nbacteriological equipment--without even apparatus to test the air of\nplanets they might land on!--and who now were sternly warned not to make\nany use of their achievement. Cochrane was not overwhelmed by the\nachievement itself, though less than eighteen hours since the ship and\nall its company had been aground on Luna, and now they were landed on a\nnew world twice as far from Earth as the Pole Star.\n\nIt is probable that Cochrane was not awed because he had a\ntelevision-producer's point of view. He regarded this entire affair as a\nproduction. He was absorbed in the details of putting it across. He\nlooked at it from his own, quite narrow, professional viewpoint. It did\nnot disturb him that he was surrounded by a wilderness. He considered\nthe wilderness the set on which his production belonged, though he was\nas much a city man as anybody else. He went back to the control-room.\nWith the ship standing on its tail that was the highest point, and as\nthe embers burned out and the smoke lessened it was possible to look out\ninto the night.\n\nHe stared at the dimly-seen trees beyond the burned area, and at the\ndark masses of mountains which blotted out the stars. He estimated them,\nwithout quite realizing it, in view of what they would look like on a\ntelevision screen. When light objects in the control-room rattled\nslightly, he paid no attention. His rehearsal-studio had been rickety,\nback home.\n\nBabs seemed to be sleepless, too. There was next to no light where\nCochrane was--merely the monitor-lights which assured that the Dabney\nfield still existed, though blocked for use by the substance of a\nplanet. Babs arrived in the almost-dark room only minutes after\nCochrane. He was moving restlessly from one port to another, staring\nout.\n\n\"I thought I'd tell you,\" Babs volunteered, \"that Doctor Holden put some\nalgae from the air-purifier tanks in the airlock, and then opened the\nouter door.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Cochrane.\n\n\"Algae's Earth plant-life,\" explained Babs. \"If the air is poisonous, it\nwill be killed by morning. We can close the outer door of the lock, pump\nout the air that came from this planet, and then let air in from the\nship so we can see what happens.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Cochrane.\n\n\"And then I couldn't sleep,\" said Babs guilelessly. \"Do you mind if I\nstay here? Everybody else has gone to bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Cochrane. \"Stay if you like.\"\n\nHe stared out at the dark. Presently he moved to another port. After a\nmoment he pointed.\n\n\"There's a glow in the sky there,\" he said curtly.\n\nShe looked. There was a vast curving blackness which masked the stars.\nBeyond it there was a reddish glare, as if of some monstrous burning.\nBut the color was not right for a fire. Not exactly.\n\n\"A city?\" asked Babs breathlessly.\n\n\"A volcano,\" Cochrane told her. \"I've staged shows that pretended to\nshow intellectual creatures on other planets--funny how we've been\ndreaming of such things, back on Earth--but it isn't likely. Not since\nwe've actually reached the stars.\"\n\n\"Why since then?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Cochrane, half ironically, \"man was given dominion over\nall created things. I don't think we'll find rivals for that dominion. I\ncan't imagine we'll find another race of creatures who could\nbe--persons. Heaven knows we try to rob each other of dignity, but I\ndon't think there's another race to humiliate us when we find them!\"\n\nAfter a moment he added:\n\n\"Bad enough that we're here because there are deodorants and cosmetics\nand dog-foods and such things that people want to advertise to each\nother! We wouldn't be here but for them, and for the fact that some\npeople are neurotics and some don't like their bosses and some are crazy\nin other fashions.\"\n\n\"Some crazinesses aren't bad,\" argued Babs.\n\n\"I've made a living out of them,\" agreed Cochrane sourly. \"But I don't\nlike them. I have a feeling that I could arrange things better. I know I\ncouldn't, but I'd like to try. In my own small way, I'm even trying.\"\n\nBabs chuckled.\n\n\"That's because you are a man. Women aren't so foolish. We're realists.\nWe like creation--even men--the way creation is.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" Cochrane said irritably. \"We've accomplished something\nterrific, and I don't get a kick out of it! My head is full of business\ndetails that have to be attended to tomorrow. I ought to be uplifted. I\nought to be gloating! I ought to be happy! But I'm worrying for fear\nthat this infernal planet is going to disappoint our audience!\"\n\nBabs chuckled again. Then she went to the stair leading to the\ncompartment below.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded.\n\n\"After all, I'm going to leave you alone,\" said Babs cheerfully. \"You're\nalways very careful not to talk to me in any personal fashion. I think\nyou're afraid I'll tell you something for your own good. If I stayed\nhere, I might. Goodnight!\"\n\nShe started down the stairs. Cochrane said vexedly:\n\n\"Hold on! Confound it, I didn't know I was so transparent! I'm sorry,\nBabs. Look! Tell me something for my own good!\"\n\nBabs hesitated, and then said very cheerfully:\n\n\"You only see things the way a man sees them. This show, this trip--this\nwhole business doesn't thrill you because you don't see it the way a\nwoman would.\"\n\n\"Such as how? What does a woman see that I don't?\"\n\n\"A woman,\" said Babs, \"sees this planet as a place that men and women\nwill come to live on. To live on! You don't. You miss all the real\nimplications of people actually living here. But they're the things a\nwoman sees first of all.\"\n\nCochrane frowned.\n\n\"I'm not so conceited I can't listen to somebody else. If you've got an\nidea--\"\n\n\"Not an idea,\" said Babs. \"Just a reaction. And you can't explain a\nreaction to somebody who hasn't had it. Goodnight!\"\n\nShe vanished down the stairs. Some time later, Cochrane heard the\nextremely minute sound of a door closing on one of the cabins three\ndecks down in the space-ship.\n\nHe went back to his restless inspection of the night outside. He tried\nto make sense of what Babs had said. He failed altogether. In the end he\nsettled in one of the over-elaborately cushioned chairs that had made\nthis ship so attractive to deluded investors. He intended to think out\nwhat Babs might have meant. She was, after all, the most competent\nsecretary he'd ever had, and he'd been wryly aware of how helpless he\nwould be without her. Now he tried painstakingly to imagine what changes\nin one's view the inclusion of women among pioneers would involve. He\nworked out some seemingly valid points. But it was not a congenial\nmental occupation.\n\nHe fell asleep without realizing it, and was waked by the sound of\nvoices all about him. It was morning again, and Johnny Simms was\nshouting boyishly at something he saw outside.\n\n\"Get at it, boy!\" he cried enthusiastically. \"Grab him! That's the\nway--\"\n\nCochrane opened his eyes. Johnny Simms gazed out and down from a\nblister-port, waving his arms. His wife Alicia looked out of the same\nport without seeming to share his excited approval. Bell had dragged a\ncamera across the control-room and was in the act of focussing it\nthrough a particular window.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded Cochrane.\n\nHe struggled out of his chair. And Johnny Simms' pleasure evaporated\nabruptly. He swore nastily, viciously, at something outside the ship.\nHis wife touched his arm and spoke to him in a low tone. He turned\nfuriously upon her, mouthing foulnesses.\n\nCochrane was formidably beside him, and Johnny Simms' expression of fury\nsmoothed out instantly. He looked pleasant and amiable.\n\n\"The fight stopped,\" he explained offhandedly. \"It was a good fight. But\none of the creatures wouldn't stay and take his licking.\"\n\nAlicia said steadily:\n\n\"There were some animals there. They looked rather like bears, only they\nhad enormous ears.\"\n\nCochrane looked at Johnny Simms with hot eyes. It was absurd to be so\nchivalrous, perhaps, but he was enraged. After an instant he turned away\nand went to the port. The burned-over area was now only ashes. At its\nedge, charcoal showed. And now he could see trees and brushwood on\nbeyond. The trees did not seem strange, because no trees would have\nseemed familiar. The brush did not impress him as exotic, because his\nexperience with actual plants was restricted to the artificial plants on\ntelevision sets and the artificially arranged plants on rooftops. He\nhardly let his eyes dwell on the vegetation at all. He searched for\nmovement. He saw the moving furry rumps of half a dozen unknown\ncreatures as they dived into concealment as if they had been frightened.\nHe looked down and could see the hull of the ship and two of the three\ntake-off fins on which it rested.\n\nThe airlock door was opening out. It swung wide. It swung back against\nthe hull.\n\n\"Holden's making some sort of test of the air,\" Cochrane said shortly.\n\"The animals were scared when the outside door swung open. I'll see what\nhe finds out.\"\n\nHe hurried down. He found Babs standing beside the inner door of the\nairlock. She looked somehow pale. There were two saucers of greenish\nsoup-like stuff on the floor at her feet. That would be, of course, the\nalgae from the air-purifying-system tanks.\n\n\"The algae were alive,\" said Babs. \"Dr. Holden went in the lock to try\nthe air himself. He said he'd be very careful.\"\n\nFor some obscure reason Cochrane felt ashamed. There was a long, a\ndesperately long wait. Then sounds of machinery. The outer door closing.\nSmall whistlings--compressed air.\n\nThe inner door opened. Bill Holden came out of the lock, his expression\nzestfully surprised.\n\n\"Hello, Jed! I tried the air. It's all right! At a guess, maybe a little\nhigh in oxygen. But it feels wonderfully good to breathe! And I can\nreport that the trees are wood and the green is chlorophyll, and this\nis an Earth-type planet. That little smoky smell about is completely\nfamiliar--and I'm taking that as an analysis. I'm going to take a walk.\"\n\nCochrane found himself watching Babs' face. She looked enormously\nrelieved, but even Cochrane--who was looking for something of the sort\nwithout realizing it--could not read anything but relief in her\nexpression. She did not, for example, look admiring.\n\n\"I'll borrow one of Johnny Simms' guns,\" said Holden, \"and take a look\naround. It's either perfectly safe or we're all dead anyhow. Frankly, I\nthink it's safe. It feels right outside, Jed! It honestly feels right!\"\n\n\"I'll come with you,\" said Cochrane, \"Jones and the pilot are necessary\nif the ship's to get back to Earth. But we're expendable.\"\n\nHe went back to the control-room. Johnny Simms zestfully undertook to\noutfit them with arms. He made no proposal to accompany them. In twenty\nminutes or so, Cochrane and Holden went into the airlock and the door\nclosed. A light came on automatically, precisely like the light in an\nelectric refrigerator. Cochrane found his lips twitching a little as the\nanalogy came to him. Seconds later the outer door opened, and they gazed\ndown among the branches of tall trees. Cochrane winced. There was no\nrailing and the height bothered him. But Holden swung out the sling. He\nand Cochrane descended, dangling, down fifty feet of unscarred, shining,\nmetal hull.\n\nThe ground was still hot underfoot. Holden cast off the sling and moved\ntoward cooler territory with an undignified haste. Cochrane followed\nhim.\n\nThe smells were absolutely commonplace. Scorched wood. Smokiness. There\nwere noises. Occasional cracklings from burned tree-trunks not wholly\nconsumed. High-pitched, shrill musical notes. And in and among the\nsmells there was an astonishing freshness in the feel of the air.\nCochrane was especially apt to notice it because he had lived in a city\nback on Earth, and had spent four days in the moon-rocket, and then had\nbreathed the Lunar City air for eighteen days more and had just come\nfrom the space-ship whose air was distinctly of the canned variety.\n\nHe did not notice the noise of the sling again in motion behind him. He\nwas all eyes and ears and acute awareness of the completely strange\nenvironment. He was the more conscious of a general strangeness because\nhe was so completely an urban product. Yet he and Holden were vastly\nless aware of the real strangeness about them than men of previous\ngenerations would have been. They did not notice the oddity of croaking\nsounds, like frogs, coming from the tree-tops. When they had threaded\ntheir way among leaning charred poles and came to green stuff underfoot\nand merely toasted foliage all around, Cochrane heard a sweet,\nhigh-pitched trilling which came from a half-inch hole in the ground.\nBut he was not astonished by the place from which the trilling came. He\nwas astonished at the sound itself.\n\nThere was a cry behind them.\n\n_\"Mr. Cochrane! Doctor Holden!\"_\n\nThey swung about. And there was Babs on the ground, just disentangling\nherself from the sling. She had followed them out, after waiting until\nthey had left the airlock and could not protest.\n\nCochrane swore to himself. But when Babs joined them breathlessly, after\na hopping run over the hot ground, he said only:\n\n\"Fancy meeting you here!\"\n\n\"_I--I couldn't resist it_,\" said Babs in breathless apology. \"And you\ndo have guns. It's safe enough--oh, look!\"\n\nShe stared at a bush which was covered with pale purple flowers. Small\ncreatures hovered in the air about it. She approached it and exclaimed\nagain at the sweetness of its scent. Cochrane and Holden joined her in\nadmiration.\n\nIn a sense they were foolishly unwary. This was completely strange\nterritory. It could have contained anything. Earlier explorers would\nhave approached every bush with caution and moved over every hilltop\nwith suspicion, anticipating deadly creatures, unparalleled monsters,\nand exotic and peculiar circumstances designed to entrap the unprepared.\nEarlier explorers, of course, would probably have had advice from famous\nmen to prepare them for all possible danger.\n\nBut this was a valley between snow-clad mountains. The river that ran\ndown its length was fed by glaciers. This was a temperate climate. The\ntrees were either coniferous or something similar, and the vegetation\ngrew well but not with the frenzy of a tropic region. There were fruits\nhere and there. Later, to be sure, they would prove to be mostly\nastringent and unpalatable. They were broad-leafed, low-growing plants\nwhich would eventually turn out to be possessed of soft-fleshed roots\nwhich were almost unanimously useless for human purposes. There were\neven some plants with thorns and spines upon them. But they encountered\nno danger.\n\nBy and large, wild animals everywhere are ferocious only when desperate.\nNo natural setting can permanently be so deadly that human being will be\nattacked immediately they appear. An area in which peril is continuous\nis one in which there is so much killing that there is no food-supply\nleft to maintain its predators. On the whole, there is simply a limit to\nhow dangerous any place can be. Dangerous beasts have to be relatively\nrare, or they will not have enough to eat, when they will thin out until\nthey are relatively rare and do have enough to eat.\n\nSo the three explorers moved safely, though their boldness was that of\nignorance, below gigantic trees nearly as tall as the space-ship\nstanding on end. They saw a small furry biped, some twelve inches tall,\nwhich waddled insanely in the exact line of their progress and with no\napparent hope of outdistancing them. They saw a gauzy creature with\nincredibly spindly legs. It flew from one tree-trunk to another,\nclinging to rough bark on each in turn. Once they came upon a small\nanimal which looked at them with enormous, panic-stricken blue eyes and\nthen fled with a sinuous gait on legs so short that they seemed mere\nflippers. It dived into a hole and vanished.\n\nBut they came out to clear space. They could look for miles and miles.\nThere was a savannah of rolling soil which gradually sloped down to a\nswift-running river. The grass--if it was grass--was quite green, but it\nhad multitudes of tiny rose-colored flowers down the central rib of each\nleaf. Nearby it seemed the color of Earth-grass, but it faded\nimperceptibly into an incredible old-rose tint in the distance. The\nmountain-scarps on either side of the valley were sheer and tall. There\nwas a great stony spur reaching out above the lowland, and there was\nforest at its top and bare brown stone dropping two thousand feet sheer.\nAnd up the valley, where it narrowed, a waterfall leaped out from the\ncliff and dropped hundreds of feet in an arc of purest white, until it\nwas lost to view behind tree-tops.\n\nThey looked. They stared. Cochrane was a television producer, and Holden\nwas a psychiatrist, and Babs was a highly efficient secretary. They did\nnot make scientific observations. The ecological system of the valley\nescaped their notice. They weren't qualified to observe that the flying\nthings around seemed mostly to be furry instead of feathered, and that\ninsects seemed few and huge and fragile,--and they did not notice that\nmost of the plants appeared to be deciduous, so indicating that this\nplanet had pronounced seasons. But Holden said:\n\n\"Up in Greenland there's a hospital on a cliff like that. People with\ndelusions of grandeur sometimes get cured just by looking at something\nthat's so much greater and more splendid than they are. I'd like to see\na hospital up yonder!\"\n\nBabs said, shining-eyed:\n\n\"A city could be built in this valley. Not a tall city, with gray\nstreets and gardens on the roofs. This could be a nice little city like\npeople used to have. There would be little houses, all separate, and\nthere'd be grass all around and people could pluck flowers if they\nwanted to, to take inside.... There could be families here, and\nhomes--not living-quarters!\"\n\nCochrane said nothing. He was envious of the others. They saw, and they\ndreamed according to their natures. Cochrane somehow felt forlorn.\nPresently he said depressedly:\n\n\"We'll go back to the ship. You can work out your woman's viewpoint\nstuff with Bell, Babs. He'll write it, or you can give it to Alicia to\nput over when we go on the air.\"\n\nBabs made no reply. The absence of comment was almost pointed. Cochrane\nrealized that she wouldn't do it, though he couldn't see why.\n\nThey did go back to the ship. Cochrane sent Babs and Holden up the\nsling, first, while he waited down below. It was a singular sensation to\nstand there. He was the only human being afoot on a planet the size of\nEarth or larger, at the foot of a cliff of metal which was the\nspace-ship's hull. He had a weapon in his hand, and it should defend him\nfrom anything. But he felt very lonely.\n\nThe sling came down for him. He felt sick at heart as it lifted him. He\nhad an overwhelming conviction of incompetence, though he could not\ndetail the reasons. The rope hauled him up, swaying, to the dizzy height\nof the air-lock door. He could not feel elated. He was partly\nresponsible for humankind's greatest achievement to date. But he had not\nquite the viewpoint that would let him enjoy its contemplation.\n\nThe ground quivered very faintly as he rose. It was not an earthquake.\nIt was merely a temblor, such as anyone would expect to feel\noccasionally with six smoking volcanic cones in view. The green stuff\nall around was proof that it could be disregarded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n\nIn the United States, some two-hundred-odd light-years away, it happened\nto be Tuesday. On this Tuesday, the broadcast from the stars was\nsponsored by Harvey's, the national men's clothing chain. Harvey's\nadvertising department preferred discussion-type shows, because\ndifferences of opinion in the shows proper led so neatly into their\ntag-line. \"You can disagree about anything but the quality of a Harvey\nsuit! That's Superb!\"\n\nTherefore the broadcast after the landing of the ship on the volcanic\nplanet was partly commercial, and partly pictures and reports from the\nSpaceways expedition, and partly queries and comments by big-name\nindividuals on Earth. Inevitably there was Dabney. And Dabney was\nneurotic.\n\nHe did his best to make a shambles of everything.\n\nThe show started promptly enough at the beginning. There was a\ntwo-minute film-strip of business-suited puppets marching row on row,\nindicating the enormous popularity of Harvey's suits. Then a fast minute\nhill-billy puppet-show about two feuding mountaineers who found they\ncouldn't possibly retain their enmity when they found themselves in\nagreement on the quality of Harvey suits. \"That's Superb!\" The\ncommercial ended with a choral dance of madly enthusiastic miniature\nfigures, dancing while they lustily sang the theme-song, \"You can\ndisagree, yes siree, you can disagree, About anything, indeed\neverything, you and me, But you can't, no you can't disagree, About the\nstrictly super, extra super, Qualitee of a Har-ve-e-e-e suit! That's\nsuperb!\"\n\nAnd thereupon the television audience of several continents saw the\nfaded-in image of mankind's first starship, poised upon its landing-fins\namong trees more splendid than even television shows had ever pictured\nbefore. The camera panned slowly, and showed such open spaces as very\nfew humans had ever seen unencumbered by buildings, and mountains of a\ngrandeur difficult for most people to believe in.\n\nThe scene cut to the space-ship's control-room and Al the pilot acted\nbriskly as the leader of an exploration-party just returned--though he\nactually hadn't left the ship. He introduced Jamison, wearing improvised\nleggings and other trappings appropriate to an explorer in wilderness.\nJamison began to extrapolate from his observations out the control-room\nport, adding film-clips for authority.\n\nSmoothly and hypnotically, he pictured the valley as the ship descended\nthe last few thousand feet, and told of the human colony to be founded\nin this vast and hospitable area just explored. Mountainside hotels for\nstar-tourists would look down upon a scene of tranquility and cozy\nspaciousness. This would be the first human outpost in the stars. In the\nother valleys of this magnificent world there would be pasture-lands,\nand humankind would again begin to regard meat as a normal and\nnot-extravagant part of its diet--on this planet, certainly! There were\nminerals beyond doubt, and water-power. The estimate was that at least\nthe equivalent of the Asian continent had been made available for human\noccupation. And this splendid addition to the resources of humanity ...\n\nThe second commercial cut Jamison off. Naturally. The sponsor was paying\nfor time. So for Jamison was substituted the other fiction about the\npoor young man who found himself envied by the board of directors of the\nfirm which employed him. His impeccable attire caused him to be promoted\nto vice-president without any question of whether or not he could fill\nthe job. Because, of course, he wore a Harvey suit.\n\nAlicia Keith showed herself on the screen and gave the woman's viewpoint\nas written about by Bell. She talked pleasantly about how it felt to\nmove about on a planet never before trodden by human beings. She was\ninterrupted by the pictured face of the lady editor of Joint Networks'\nfeminine programs, who asked sweetly:\n\n\"Tell me, Alicia, what do you think the attainment of the stars will\nmean to the Average American housewife in the immediate future? Right\nnow?\"\n\nThen Dabney came on. His appearance was fitted into the sequence from\nLunar City, and his gestures were extravagant as anybody's gestures will\nbe where their hands and arms weigh so small a fraction of\nEarth-normal.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Dabney impressively, \"to congratulate the men who have so\nswiftly adapted my discovery of faster-than-light travel to practical\nuse. I am overwhelmed at having been able to achieve a scientific\ntriumph which in time will mean that mankind's future stretches\nendlessly and splendidly into the future!\"\n\nHere there was canned applause. Dabney held up his hand for attention.\nHe thought. Visibly.\n\n\"But,\" he said urgently, \"I admit that I am disturbed by the\nprecipitancy of the action that has been taken. I feel as if I were like\nsome powerful djinni giving gifts which the recipients may use without\nthought.\"\n\nMore canned applause, inserted because he had given instructions for it\nwhenever he paused. The communicator-operator at Luna City took pleasure\nin following instructions exactly. Dabney held up his hand again. Again\nhe performed feats of meditation in plain view.\n\n\"At the moment,\" he said anxiously, \"as the author of this truly\nmagnificent achievement, I have to use the same intellect which produced\nit, to examine the possibility of its ill-advised use. May not\nexplorers--who took off without my having examined their plans and\nprecautions--may not over-hasty users of my gift to humanity do harm?\nMay they not find bacteria the human body cannot resist? May they not\nbring back plagues and epidemics? Have they prepared themselves to use\nmy discovery only for the benefit of mankind? Or have they been\nprecipitous? I shall have to apply myself to the devising of methods by\nwhich my discovery--made so that Humanity might attain hitherto\nundreamed-of-heights--I shall have to devise means by which it will be\ntruly a blessing to mankind!\"\n\nDabney, of course, had tasted the limelight. All the world considered\nhim the greatest scientist of all time--except, of course, the people\nwho knew something about science. But the first actual voyagers in space\nhad become immediately greater heroes than himself. It was intolerable\nto Dabney to be restricted to taking bows on programs in which they\nstarred. So he wrote a star part for himself.\n\nThe bearded biologist who followed him was to have lectured on the\npictures and reports forwarded to him beforehand. But he could not\nignore so promising a lead to show how much he knew. So he lectured\nauthoritatively on the danger of extra-terrestrial disease-producing\norganisms being introduced on Earth. He painted a lurid picture, quoting\nfrom the history of pre-sanitation epidemics. He wound up with a\nspecific prophecy of something like the Black Death of the middle ages\nas lurking among the stars to decimate humanity. He was a victim of the\nwell-known authority-trauma which affects some people on television when\nthey think millions of other people are listening to them. They depart\nmadly from their scripts to try to say something startling enough to\njustify all the attention they're getting.\n\nThe broadcast ended with a sentimental live commercial in which a\ndazzlingly beautiful girl melted into the arms of the worthy young man\nshe had previously scorned. She found him irresistible when she noticed\nthat he was wearing a suit she instantly knew by its quality could only\ncome from Harvey's.\n\nOn the planet of glaciers and volcanoes, Holden fumed.\n\n\"Dammit!\" he protested. \"They talk like we're lepers! Like if we ever\ncome back we'll be carriers of some monstrous disease that will wipe out\nthe human race! As a matter of fact, we're no more likely to catch an\nextra-terrestrial disease than to catch wry-neck from sick chickens!\"\n\n\"That broadcast's nothing to worry about,\" said Cochrane.\n\n\"But it is!\" insisted Holden. \"Dabney and that fool biologist presented\nspace-travel as a reason for panic! They could have every human being on\nEarth scared to death we'll bring back germs and everybody'll die of the\ncroup!\"\n\nCochrane grinned.\n\n\"Good publicity--if we needed it! Actually, they've boosted the show.\nFrom now on every presentation has a dramatic kick it didn't have\nbefore. Now everybody will feel suspense waiting for the next show. Has\nJamison got the Purple Death on the Planet of Smoky Hilltops? Will\ndarling Alicia Keith break out in green spots next time we watch her on\nthe air? Has Captain Al of the star-roving space-ship breathed in spores\nof the Swelling Fungus? Are the space-travellers doomed? Tune in on our\nnext broadcast and see! My dear Bill, if we weren't signed up for\nsponsors' fees, I'd raise our prices after this trick!\"\n\nHolden looked unconvinced. Cochrane said kindly:\n\n\"Don't worry! I could turn off the panic tomorrow--as much panic as\nthere is. Kursten, Kasten, Hopkins and Fallowe had a proposal they set\ngreat store by. They wanted to parcel out a big contest for a name for\nmankind's second planet. They had regional sponsors lined up. It would\nhave been worldwide! Advertisers were drooling over the prospect of\npeople proposing names for this planet on box-tops! They were planning\nfive million prize-money--and who'd be afraid of us then? But I turned\nit down because we haven't got a helicopter. We couldn't stage enough\ndifferent shows from this planet to keep it going the minimum six weeks\nfor a contest like that. Instead, we're taking off in a couple of hours.\nJones agrees. The astronomers back home have picked out another Sol-type\nstar that ought to have planets. We're going to run over and see what\npickings we can find. Not too far--only twenty-some light-years!\"\n\nHe regarded Holden quizzically to see how the last phases affected him.\nHolden didn't notice it.\n\n\"A contest--It doesn't make sense!\"\n\n\"I know it isn't sense!\" said Cochrane. \"It's public-relations! I'm\nbeginning to get my self-respect back. I see now that a\nspace-exploration job is only as good as its public-relations man!\"\n\nHe went zestfully to find Babs to tell her to leave the communicator-set\nand let queries go unanswered as a matter of simple business policy.\n\nThe sling which swung out of the airlock now became busy. They had\nlanded on this planet, and they were going to leave it, and there had\nbeen a minimum of actual contact with its soil. So Jamison took his\nleggings--put on for the show--and he and Bell went down to the ground\nand foraged through the woods. Jamison carried one of Johnny Simms'\nguns, which he regarded with acute suspicion, and Bell carried cameras.\nThey photographed trees and underbrush, first as atmosphere and then\nwith fanatic attention to leaves and fruits or flowers. Bell got\npictures of one of the small, furry bipeds that Cochrane and Holden had\nspied when Babs was with them. He got a picture of what he believed to\nbe a spider-web--it was thicker and heavier and huger than any web on\nEarth--and rather fearfully looked for the monster that could string\nthirty-foot cables as thick as fishing-twine. Then he found that it was\nnot a snare at all. It was a construction at whose center something\nundiscoverable had made a nest, with eggs in it. Some creature had made\nan unapproachable home for itself where its young would not be assailed\nby predators.\n\nAl, the pilot, went out of the lock and descended to the ground and went\nas far as the edge of the ash-ring. But he did not go any farther. He\nwandered about unhappily, pretending that he did not want to go into the\nwoods. He tried to appear quite content to view half-burnt trees for his\nexperience of the first extra-terrestrial planet on which men had\nlanded. He did kick up some pebbles--water-rounded--and one of them had\nflecks of what looked like gold in it. Al regarded it excitedly, and\nthen thought of freight-rates. But he did scrabble for more. Presently\nhe had a pocket-full of small stones which would be regarded with\nrapture by his nieces and nephews because they had come from the stars.\nActually, they were quite commonplace minerals. The flecks of what\nlooked like gold were only iron pyrates.\n\nJones did not leave the ship. He was puttering. Nor Alicia. Holden urged\nher to take a walk, and she said quietly:\n\n\"Johnny's out with a gun. He's hunting. I don't like to be with Johnny\nwhen he may be disappointed.\"\n\nShe smiled, and Holden sourly went away. There had been no particular\nconsequences of Johnny Simms' inability to remember what was right and\nwhat was wrong. But Holden felt like a normal man about men whose wives\nlook patient. Even psychiatrists feel that it is somehow disreputable to\nilltreat a woman who doesn't fight back. This attitude is instinctive.\nIt is what is called the fine, deep-rooted impulse to chivalry which is\none of the prides of modern culture.\n\nHolden settled dourly down at the communicator to get an outgoing call\nto Earth, when there were some hundreds of incoming calls backed up. By\nsheer obstinacy and bad manners he made it. He got a connection to a\nhospital where he was known, and he talked to its bacteriologist. The\nbacteriologist was competent, but not yet famous. With Holden giving\nhonest guesses at the color of the sunlight, and its probable\nultra-violet content, and with careful estimates of the exactness with\nwhich burning vegetation here smelled like Earth-plants, they arrived at\nimprecise but common sense conclusions. Of the hundreds of thousands of\npossible organic compounds, only so many actually took part in the\nlife-processes of creatures on Earth. Yet there were hundreds of\nthousands of species prepared to make use of anything usable. If the\nsunlight and temperature of the two worlds were similar, it was somewhat\nmore than likely that the same chemical compounds would be used by\nliving things on both. So that there could be micro-organisms on the\nnew planet which could be harmful. But on the other hand, either they\nwould be familiar in the toxins they produced--and human bodies could\nresist them--or else they would be new compounds to which humans would\nreact allergically. Basically, then, if anybody on the ship developed\nhives, they had reason to be frightened. But so long as nobody sneezed\nor broke out in welts, their lives were probably safe.\n\nThis comforting conclusion took a long time to work out. Meanwhile Babs\nand Cochrane had swung down to the ground and went hiking. Cochrane was\narmed as before, though he had no experience as a marksman. In\ntelevision shows he had directed the firing of weapons shooting blank\ncharges--cut to a minimum so they wouldn't blast the mikes. He knew what\nmotions to go through, but nothing else.\n\nThey did not explore in the same direction as their first excursion. The\nship was to take off presently, as soon as this planet had turned enough\nfor the space-ship's nose to point nearly in the direction of their next\ntarget. They had two hours for exploration.\n\nThey came upon something which lay still across their path, like a great\nserpent. Cochrane looked at it startledly. Then he saw that the round,\nglistening seeming snake was fastened to the ground by rootlets. It was\na plant which grew like a creeper, absorbing nourishment from a vast\nroot-area. Somewhere, no doubt, it would rear upward and spread out\nleaves to absorb the sun's light. It used, in a way, the principle of\nthose lateral wells which in dry climates gather water too scarce to\ncollect in merely vertical holes.\n\nThey went on and on, admiring and amazed. All about them were\ncuriosities of adaptation, freaks of ecological adjustment, marvels of\nsymbiotic cooperation. A botanist would have swooned with joy at the\nmaterial all about. A biologist would have babbled happily. Babs and\nCochrane admired without information. They walked interestedly but\nunawed among the unparalleled. Back on Earth they knew as much as most\npeople about nature--practically nothing at all. Babs had never seen any\nwild plants before. She was fascinated by what she saw, and exclaimed at\neverything. But she did not realize a fraction of the marvels on which\nher eyes rested. On the whole, she survived.\n\n\"It's a pity we haven't got a helicopter,\" Cochrane said regretfully.\n\"If we could fly around from place to place, and send back pictures ...\nWe can't do it in the ship ... It would burn more fuel than we've got.\"\n\nBabs wrinkled her forehead.\n\n\"Doctor Holden's badly worried because we can't make as alluring a\npicture as he'd like.\"\n\nCochrane halted, to watch something which was flat like a disk of\ngray-green flesh and which moved slowly out of their path with\ndisquieting writhing motions. It vanished, and he said:\n\n\"Yes. Bill's an honest man, even if he is a psychiatrist. He wants\ndesperately to do something for the poor devils back home who're so\npitifully frustrated. There are tens of millions of men who can't hope\nfor anything better than to keep the food and shelter supply intact for\nthemselves and their families. They can't even pretend to hope for more\nthan that. There isn't more than so much to go around. But Bill wants to\ngive them hope. He figures that without hope the world will turn\nmadhouse in another generation. It will.\"\n\n\"You're trying to do something about that!\" said Babs quickly. \"Don't\nyou think you're offering hope to everybody back on Earth?\"\n\n\"No!\" snapped Cochrane. \"I'm not trying anything so abstract as\nfurnishing hope to a frustrated humanity! Nobody can supply an\nabstraction! Nobody can accomplish an abstraction! Everything that's\nactually done is specific and real! Maybe you can find abstract\nqualities in it after it's done, but I'm a practical man! I'm not trying\nto produce an improved psychological climate, suitable for debilitated\npsychos! I'm trying to get a job done!\"\n\n\"I've wondered,\" admitted Babs, \"what the job is.\"\n\nCochrane grimaced.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe it, Babs.\"\n\nThere was an odd quivering underfoot. Trees shook. There was no other\npeculiarity anywhere. Nothing fell. No rocks rolled. In a valley among\nvolcanoes, where the smoke from no less than six cones could be seen at\nonce, temblors would not do damage. What damage mild shakings could do\nwould have been done centuries since.\n\nBabs said uneasily:\n\n\"That feels--queer, doesn't it?\"\n\nCochrane nodded. But just as he and Babs had never been conditioned to\nbe afraid of animals, they had been conditioned by air-travel at home\nand space-travel to here against alarm at movements of their\nsurroundings. Temblors were evidently frequent at this place. Trees were\nanchored against them as against prevailing winds in exposed situations.\nLandslides did not remain poised to fall. Really unstable slopes had\nbeen shaken down long ago.\n\n\"I wish we had a helicopter,\" Cochrane repeated. \"The look of the\nmountains as we came down, with glaciers between the smoking cones--that\nwas good show-stuff! We could have held interest here until we worked\nthat naming contest. We could use the extra capital that would bring in!\nAs it is, we've got to move on with practically nothing accomplished.\nThe trouble is that I didn't think we would succeed as we have! Heaven\nknows I could have gotten helicopters!\"\n\nHe helped her up a small steep incline, where rock protruded from a\nhillside.\n\nThe ground trembled again. Not alarmingly, but Babs' hold of his hand\ntightened a little. They continued to climb. They came out atop a small\nbare prominence which rose above the forest. Here they could see over\nthe treetops in a truly extensive view. The mountains all about were\nclearly visible. Some were ten and some twenty miles away. Some, still\nfarther, were barely visible in the thin haze of distance. But there was\na thick pall of smoke hovering about one of the farthest. It was\nmushroom-shaped. At one time in human history, it would have seemed\ntypically a volcanic cloud. To Cochrane and Babs, it was typically the\ncloud of an atomic explosion.\n\nThe ground shook sharply underfoot. Babs staggered.\n\nFlying things rose from the forests in swarms. They hovered and darted\nand flapped above the tree-tops. Temblors did not alarm the creatures of\nthe valley. But ground-shocks like this last were another matter.\n\nA great tree, rearing above its fellows, toppled slowly. With ripping,\ntearing noises, it bent sedately toward the smoking, far-away mountain.\nIt crashed thunderously down upon smaller trees. There were other\nrending noises. The flying things rose higher, seeming agitated. Echoes\nsounded in the ears of the two atop the hill.\n\nThere was another sharp shock. Babs gave a little, inarticulate cry. She\npointed.\n\nThere was much smoke in the distance. Over the far-away cone, which was\nindistinct in the smoke of its own making--over the edge of the distant\nmountains a glare appeared. It was a thin line of bright white light.\nWith infinite deliberation it began to creep down the slanting,\nblessedly remote mountainside.\n\nThe ground seemed to shift abruptly, and then shift back. Across and\ndown the valley, five miles away, a portion of the stony wall detached\nitself and slid downward in seeming slow motion. Two more great trees\nmade ripping sounds. One crashed. There was an enormous darkness above\none part of the sky. Its under side glowed from fires as of hell, in the\ncrater beneath it. There were sparkings above the mountaintop.\n\nVery oddly indeed, the sky overhead was peacefully blue. But at the\nhorizon a sheet of fire rolled down mile-long slopes. It seemed to move\nwith infinite deliberation, but to move visibly at such a distance it\nmust have been traveling like an express-train. It must have been\nunthinkably hot, glaring-white molten stone, thin as water, pouring\ndownward in a flood of fire.\n\nThere was no longer a sensation of the ground trembling underfoot. Now\nthe noticeable sensation was when the ground was still. Temblors were\npractically continuous. There were distinct sharp impacts, as of violent\nblows nearby.\n\nBabs stared, fascinated. She glanced up at Cochrane. His skin was white.\nThere were beads of sweat on his forehead.\n\n\"We're safe here, aren't we?\" she asked, scared.\n\n\"I think so. But I'm not going to take you through falling trees while\nthis is going on! There's another tree down! I'm worrying about the\nship! If it topples--.\"\n\nShe looked at the nose of the space-ship, gleaming silver metal, rising\nfrom the trees about the landing-spot it had burned clear. A third of\nits length was visible.\n\n\"If it topples,\" said Cochrane, \"we'll never be able to take off. It has\nto point up to lift.\"\n\nBabs looked from the ship to him, and back again. Then her eyes went\nfearfully to the remote mountain. Rumblings came from it now. They were\nnot loud. They were hardly more than dull growlings, at the lower limit\nof audible pitch. They were like faint and distant thunder. There were\nflashings like lightning in the cloud which now enveloped the mountain's\ntop.\n\nCochrane made an indescribable small sound. He stared at the ship. As\nexplosion-waves passed over the ground, a faint, unanimous movement of\nthe treetops became visible. It seemed to Cochrane that the space-ship\nwavered as if about to fall from its upright position.\n\nIt was not designed to stand such violence as a fall would imply. Its\nhull would be dented or rent. It was at least possible that its\nfuel-store would detonate. But even if its fall were checked by\nstill-standing trees about it, it could never take off again. The eight\nhumans of its company could never juggle it back to a vertical position.\nRocket-thrust would merely push it in the direction its nose pointed.\nToppled, its rocket-thrust would merely shove it blindly over stones and\ntrees and to destruction.\n\nThe ship swayed again. Visibly. Ground-waves made its weight have the\neffect of blows. Part of its foundation rested on almost-visible stone,\nonly feet below the ground-level. But one of the landing-fins rested on\nhumus. As the shocks passed, that fin-foot sank into the soft soil. The\nspace-ship leaned perceptibly.\n\nFlying creatures darted back and forth above the tree-tops. Miles away,\ninsensate violence reigned. Clouds of dust and smoke shot miles into the\nair, and half a mountainside glowed white-hot, and there was the sound\nof long-continued thunder, and the ground shook and quivered....\n\nThere were movements nearby. A creature with yellow fur and the shape of\na bear with huge ears came padding out of the forest. It swarmed up the\nbare stone of the hill on which Babs and Cochrane stood.\n\nIt ignored them. Halfway up the unwooded part of the hill, it stopped\nand made plaintive, high-pitched noises. Other creatures came. Many had\ncome while the man and girl were too absorbed to notice. Now two more of\nthe large animals came out into the open and climbed the hill.\n\nBabs said shakily:\n\n\"Do you--think they'll--do you think--\"\n\nThere was a nearer roaring. The space-ship leaned, and leaned....\nCochrane's lips tensed.\n\nThe space-ship's rockets bellowed and a storm of hurtling smoke flashed\nup around it. It lifted, staggering as its steering-jets tried\nfrantically to swing its lower parts underneath its mass. It lurched\nviolently, and the rockets flamed terribly. It lifted again. Its tail\nwas higher than the trees, but it did not point straight up. It surged\nhorribly across the top of the forest, leaving a vast flash of flaming\nvegetation behind it. Then it steadied, and aimed skyward and\nclimbed....\n\nThen it was not. Obviously the Dabney field booster had been flashed on\nto get the ship out to space. The ship had vanished into emptiness.\n\nThe Dabney field had flicked it some hundred and seventy-odd light-years\nfrom Earth's moon in the flicker of a heart-beat. It might have gone\nthat far again. Whoever was in it had had no choice but to take off, and\nno way to take off without suicidal use of fuel in any other way.\n\nCochrane looked at where the ship had vanished. Seconds passed. There\ncame the thunderclap of air closing the vacuum the ship's disappearance\nhad left.\n\nThere were squealings behind the pair on the hilltop. Eight of the huge\nyellow beasts were out in the open, now. Tiny, furry biped animals\nwaddled desperately to get out of their way. Smaller creatures scuttled\nhere and there. A sinuous creature with fur but no apparent legs writhed\nits way upward. But all the creatures were frightened. They observed an\nabsolute truce, under the overmastering greater fear of nature.\n\nFar away, the volcano on the skyline boomed and flashed and emitted\nmonstrous clouds of smoke. The shining, incandescent lava on its flanks\nglared across the glaciers.\n\nBabs gasped suddenly. She realized the situation in which she and\nCochrane had been left.\n\nShivering, she pressed close to him as the distant black smoke-cloud\nspread toward the center of the sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n\nBefore sunset, they reached the area of ashes where the ship had stood.\nCochrane was sure that if anybody else had been left behind besides\nthemselves, the landing-place was an inevitable rendezvous. Only three\nmembers of the ship's company had been inside when Babs and Cochrane\nleft to stroll for the two hours astronomers on Earth had set as a\nwaiting-period. Jones had been in the ship, and Holden, and Alicia\nSimms. Everybody else had been exploring. Their attitude had been\nexactly that of sight-seers and tourists. But they could have gotten\nback before the take-off.\n\nApparently they had. Nobody seemed to have returned to the burned-over\nspace since the ship's departure. The blast of the rockets had erased\nall previous tracks, but still there was a thin layer of ash resettled\nover the clearing. Footprints would have been visible in it. Anybody\nremaining would have come here. Nobody had. Babs and Cochrane were left\nalone.\n\nThere were still temblors, but the sharper shocks no longer came. There\nwas conflagration in the wood, where the lurching ship had left a long\nfresh streak of forest-fire. The two castaways stared at the round,\nempty landing-place. Overhead, the blue sky turned yellow--but where the\nsmoke from the eruption rose, the sky early became a brownish red--and\npresently the yellow faded to gold. Unburned green foliage all about was\nsingularly beautiful in that golden glow. But it was more beautiful\nstill as the sky turned rose-pink and then carmine in turn, and then\ncrimson from one horizon to the other save where the volcanic\nsmoke-cloud marred the color. Then the east darkened, and became a red\nso deep as to be practically black, and unfamiliar bright stars began to\npeep through it.\n\nBefore darkness was complete, Cochrane dragged burning branches from the\nedge of the new fire--the heat was searing--and built a new and smaller\nfire in the place where the ship had been.\n\n\"This isn't for warmth,\" he explained briefly, \"but so we'll have light\nif we need it. And it isn't likely that animals will be anything but\nafraid of it.\"\n\nHe went off to drag charred masses of burnable stuff from the burned-out\nfirst forest fire. He built a sort of rampart in the very center of the\nclearing. He brought great heaps of scorched wood. He did not know how\nmuch was needed to keep the fire going until dawn.\n\nWhen he finished, Babs was silently at work trying to find out how to\nkeep the fire going. The burning parts had to be kept together. One\nbranch, burning alone, died out. Two red-hot brands in contact kept each\nother alight.\n\n\"I'm sorry we haven't anything to eat,\" Cochrane told her.\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" she assured him. \"What are we going to do now?\"\n\n\"There's nothing to do until morning.\" Unconsciously, Cochrane looked\ngrim. \"Then there'll be plenty. Food, for one thing. We don't know,\nactually, whether or not there's anything really edible on this\nplanet--for us. It could be that there are fruits or possibly stalks or\nleaves that would be nourishing. Only--we don't know which is which. We\nhave to be careful. We might pick something like poison ivy!\"\n\nBabs said:\n\n\"But the ship will come back!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" agreed Cochrane. \"But it may take them some time to find\nus. This is a pretty big planet, you know.\"\n\nHe estimated his supply of burnable stuff. He improved the rampart he\nhad made at first. Babs stared at him. After four or five minutes he\nstepped back.\n\n\"You can lean against this,\" he explained. \"You can watch the fire quite\ncomfortably. And it's a sort of wall. The fire will light one side of\nyou and the wall will feel comforting behind you when you get sleepy.\"\n\nBabs nodded. She swallowed.\n\n\"I--think I see what you mean when you say they may have trouble finding\nus, because this planet is so large.\"\n\nCochrane nodded reluctantly.\n\n\"Of course there's this burned-off space for a marker,\" he observed\ncheerfully. \"But it could take several days for them to see it.\"\n\nBabs swallowed again. She said carefully:\n\n\"The--ship can't hover like a helicopter, to search. You said so. It\ndoesn't have fuel enough. They can't really search for us at all! The\nonly way to make a real search would be to go back to Earth and--bring\nback helicopters and fuel for them and men to fly them.... Isn't that\nright?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. But we do have to figure on a matter of--well--two or\nthree days as a possibility.\"\n\nBabs moistened her lips and he said quickly:\n\n\"I did a show once about some miners lost in a wilderness. A period\nshow. In it, they knew that part of their food was poisoned. They didn't\nknow what. They had to have all their food. And of course they didn't\nhave laboratories with which to test for poison.\"\n\nBabs eyed him oddly.\n\n\"They bandaged their arms,\" said Cochrane, \"and put scraps of the\ndifferent foodstuffs under the bandages. The one that was poisonous\nshowed. It affected the skin. Like an allergy-test. I'll try that trick\nin the morning when there's light to pick samples by. There are berries\nand stuff. There must be fruits. A few hours should test them.\"\n\nBabs said without intonation:\n\n\"And we can watch what the animals eat.\"\n\nCochrane nodded gravely. Animals on Earth can live on things that--to\nput it mildly--humans do not find satisfying. Grass, for example. But it\nwas good for Babs to think of cheering things right now. There would be\nplenty of discouragement to contemplate later.\n\nThere was a flicker of brightness in the sky. Presently the earth\nquivered. Something made a plaintive, \"_waa-waa-waaaaa!_\" sound off in\nthe night. Something else made a noise like the tinkling of bells. There\nwas an abstracted hooting presently, which now was nearby and now was\nfar away, and once they heard something which was exactly like the noise\nof water running into a pool. But the source of that particular burbling\nmoved through the dark wood beyond the clearing.\n\nIt was not wholly dark where they were, even aside from their own small\nfire. The burning trees in the departing ship's rocket-trail sent up a\ncolumn of white which remaining flames illuminated. The remarkably\nprimitive camp Cochrane had made looked like a camp on a tiny\nsnow-field, because of the ashes.\n\n\"We've got to think about shelter,\" said Babs presently, very quietly\nindeed. \"If there are glaciers, there must be winter here. If there is\nwinter, we have to find out which animals we can eat, and how to store\nthem.\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" protested Cochrane. \"That's looking too far ahead!\"\n\nBabs clasped her hands together. It could have been to keep their\ntrembling from being seen. Cochrane was regarding her face. She kept\nthat under admirable control.\n\n\"Is it?\" asked Babs. \"On the broadcast Mr. Jamison said that there was\nas much land here as on all the continent of Asia. Maybe he exaggerated.\nSay there's only as much land not ice-covered as there is in South\nAmerica. It's all forest and plain and--uninhabited.\" She moistened her\nlips, but her voice was very steady. \"If all of South America was\nuninhabited, and there were two people lost in it, and nobody knew where\nthey were--how long would it take to find them?\"\n\n\"It would be a matter of luck,\" admitted Cochrane.\n\n\"If the ship comes back, it can't hover to look for us. There isn't fuel\nenough. It couldn't spot us from space if it went in an orbit like a\nspace platform. By the time they could get help--they wouldn't even be\nsure we were alive. If we can't count on being found right away, this\nburned-over place will be green again. In two or three weeks they\ncouldn't find it anyhow.\"\n\nCochrane fidgeted. He had worked out all this for himself. He'd been\ndisturbed at having to tell it, or even admit it to Babs. Now she said\nin a constrained voice:\n\n\"If men came to this planet and built a city and hunted for us, it might\nstill be a hundred years before anybody happened to come into this\nvalley. Looking for us would be worse than looking for a needle in a\nhaystack. I don't think we're going to be found again.\"\n\nCochrane was silent. He felt guiltily relieved that he did not have to\nbreak this news to Babs. Most men have an instinctive feeling that a\nwoman will blame them for bad news they hear.\n\nA long time later, Babs said as quietly as before:\n\n\"Johnny Simms asked me to come along while he went hunting. I didn't. At\nleast I--I'm not cast away with him!\"\n\nCochrane said gruffly:\n\n\"Don't sit there and brood! Try to get some sleep.\"\n\nShe nodded. After a long while, her head drooped. She jerked awake\nagain. Cochrane ordered her vexedly to make herself comfortable. She\nstretched out beside the wall of wood that Cochrane had made. She said\nquietly:\n\n\"While we're looking for food tomorrow morning, we'd better keep our\neyes open for a place to build a house.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes.\n\nCochrane kept watch through the dark hours. He heard night-cries in the\nforest, and once toward dawn the distant volcano seemed to undergo a\nfresh paroxysm of activity. Boomings and explosions rumbled in the\nnight. There were flickerings in the sky. But there were fewer temblors\nafter it, and no shocks at all.\n\nMore than once, Cochrane found himself dozing. It was difficult to stay\nin a state of alarm. There was but one single outcry in the forest that\nsounded like the shriek of a creature seized by a carnivore. That was\nnot nearby. He tried to make plans. He felt bitterly self-reproachful\nthat he knew so few of the things that would be useful to a castaway.\nBut he had been a city man all his life. Woodcraft was not only out of\nhis experience--on overcrowded Earth it would have been completely\nuseless.\n\nFrom time to time he found himself thinking, instead of practical\nmatters, of the astonishing sturdiness of spirit Babs displayed.\n\nWhen she waked, well after daybreak, and sat up blinking, he said:\n\n\"Er--Babs. We're in this together. From now on, if you want to tell me\nsomething for my own good, go ahead! Right?\"\n\nShe rubbed her eyes on her knuckles and said,\n\n\"I'd have done that anyhow. For both our good. Don't you think we'd\nbetter try to find a place where we can get a drink of water? Water has\nto be right to drink!\"\n\nThey set off, Cochrane carrying the weapon he'd brought from the ship.\nIt was Babs who pointed out that a stream should almost certainly be\nfound where rain would descend, downhill. Babs, too, spotted one of the\nsmall, foot-high furry bipeds feasting gluttonously on small round\nobjects that grew from the base of a small tree instead of on its\nbranches. The tree, evidently, depended on four-footed rather than on\nflying creatures to scatter its seeds. They gathered samples of the\nfruit. Cochrane peeled a sliver of the meat from one of the round\nobjects and put it under his watchstrap.\n\nThey found a stream. They found other fruits, and Cochrane prepared the\nsame test for them as for the first. One of the samples turned his skin\nred and angry almost immediately. He discarded it and all the fruits of\nthe kind from which it came.\n\nAt midday they tasted the first-gathered fruit. The flesh was red and\njuicy. There was a texture it was satisfying to chew on. The taste was\nindeterminate save for a very mild flavor of maple and peppermint mixed\ntogether.\n\nThey had no symptoms of distress afterward. Other fruits were less\nsatisfactory. Of the samples which the skin-test said were\nnon-poisonous, one was acrid and astringent, and two others had no taste\nexcept that of greenness--practically the taste of any leaf one might\nchew.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Cochrane wryly, as they headed back toward the\nash-clearing at nightfall, \"we've got to find out if the animals can be\neaten.\"\n\nBabs nodded matter-of-factly.\n\n\"Yes. Tonight I'm taking part of the watch. As you remarked this\nmorning, we're in this together.\"\n\nHe looked at her sharply, and she flushed.\n\n\"I mean it!\" she said doggedly. \"I'm watching part of the night!\"\n\nHe was desperately tired. His muscles were not yet back to normal after\nthe low gravity on the moon. She'd had more rest than he. He had to let\nher help. But there was embarrassment between them because it looked as\nif they would have to spend the rest of their lives together, and they\nhad not made the decision. It had been made for them. And they had not\nacknowledged it yet.\n\nWhen they reached the clearing, Cochrane began to drag new logs toward\nthe central place where much of last night's supply of fuel remained.\nMatter-of-factly, Babs began to haul stuff with him. He said vexedly:\n\n\"Quit it! I've already been realizing how little I know about the things\nwe're going to need to survive! Let me fool myself about masculine\nstrength, anyhow!\"\n\nShe smiled at him, a very little. But she went obediently to the fire to\nexperiment with cookery of the one palatable variety of fruit from this\nplanet's trees. He drove himself to bring more wood than before. When he\nsettled down she said absorbedly:\n\n\"Try this, Jed.\"\n\nThen she flushed hotly because she'd inadvertently used his familiar\nname. But she extended something that was toasted and not too much\nburned. He ate, with weariness sweeping over him like a wave. The cooked\nfruit was almost a normal food, but it did need salt. There would be\ntrouble finding salt on this planet. The water that should be in the\nseas was frozen in the glaciers. Salt would not have been leached out of\nthe soil and gathered in the seas. It would be a serious problem. But\nCochrane was very tired indeed.\n\n\"I'll take the first two hours,\" said Babs briskly. \"Then I'll wake\nyou.\"\n\nHe showed her how to use the weapon. He meant to let himself drift\nquietly off to sleep, acting as if he had a little trouble going off.\nBut he didn't. He lay down, and the next thing he knew Babs was shaking\nhim violently. In the first dazed instant when he opened his eyes he\nthought they were surrounded by forest fire. But it wasn't that. It was\ndawn, and Babs had let him sleep the whole night through, and the sky\nwas golden-yellow from one horizon to the other. More, he heard the\nnow-familiar cries of creatures in the forest. But also he heard a\nroaring sound, very thin and far away, which could only be one thing.\n\n\"Jed! Jed! Get up! Quick! The ship's coming back! The ship! We've got to\nmove!\"\n\nShe dragged him to his feet. He was suddenly wide-awake. He ran with\nher. He flung back his head and stared up as he ran. There was a\npin-point of flame and vapor almost directly overhead. It grew swiftly\nin size. It plunged downward.\n\nThey reached the surrounding forest and plunged into it. Babs stumbled,\nand Cochrane caught her, and they ran onward hand in hand to get clear\naway from the down-blast of the rockets. The rocket-roaring grew louder\nand louder.\n\nThe castaways gazed. It was the ship. From below, fierce flames poured\ndown, blue-white and raging. The silver hull slanted a little. It\nshifted its line of descent. It came down with a peculiar deftness of\nhandling that Cochrane had not realized before. Its rockets splashed,\nbut the flame did not extend out to the edge of the clearing that had\nbeen burned off at first. The rocket-flames, indeed, did not approach\nthe proportion to be seen on rockets on film-tape, or as Cochrane had\nseen below the moon-rocket descending on Earth.\n\nThe ship settled within yards of its original landing-place. Its rockets\ndwindled, but remained burning. They dwindled again. The noise was\noutrageous, but still not the intolerable tumult of a moon-rocket\nlanding on Earth.\n\nThe rockets cut off.\n\nThe airlock door opened. Cochrane and Babs waved cheerfully from the\nedge of the clearing. Holden appeared in the door and shouted down:\n\n\"Sorry to be so long coming back.\"\n\nHe waved and vanished. They had, of course, to wait until the ground at\nleast partly cooled before the landing-sling could be used. Around them\nthe noises of the forest continued. There were cooling, crackling sounds\nfrom the ship.\n\n\"I wonder how they found their way back!\" said Babs. \"I didn't think\nthey ever could. Did you?\"\n\n\"Babs,\" said Cochrane, \"you lied to me! You said you'd wake me in two\nhours. But you let me sleep all night!\"\n\n\"You'd let me sleep the night before,\" she told him composedly. \"I was\nfresher than you were, and today'd have been a pretty bad one. We were\ngoing to try to kill some animals. You needed the rest.\"\n\nCochrane said slowly:\n\n\"I found out something, Babs. Why you could face things. Why we humans\nhaven't all gone mad. I think I've gotten the woman's viewpoint now,\nBabs. I like it.\"\n\nShe inspected the looming blister-ports of the ship, now waiting for the\nground to cool so they could come aboard.\n\n\"I think we'd have made out if the ship hadn't come,\" Cochrane told her.\n\"We'd have had a woman's viewpoint to work from. Yours. You looked ahead\nto building a house. Of course you thought of finding food, but you were\nthinking of the possibility of winter and--building a house. You weren't\nthinking only of survival. You were thinking far ahead. Women must think\nfarther ahead than men do!\"\n\nBabs looked at him briefly, and then returned to her apparently absorbed\ncontemplation of the ship.\n\n\"That's what's the matter with people back on Earth,\" Cochrane said\nurgently. \"There's no frustration as long as women can look ahead--far\nahead, past here and now! When women can do that, they can keep men\ngoing. It's when there's nothing to plan for that men can't go on\nbecause women can't hope. You see? You saw a city here. A little city,\nwith separate homes. On Earth, too many people can't think of more than\nliving-quarters and keeping food enough for them--them only!--coming in.\nThey can't hope for more. And it's when that happens--You see?\"\n\nBabs did not answer. Cochrane fumbled. He said angrily:\n\n\"Confound it, can't you see what I'm trying to say? We'd have been\nbetter off, as castaways, than back on Earth crowded and scared of our\njobs! I'm saying I'd rather stay here with you than go back to the way I\nwas living before we started off on this voyage! I think the two of us\ncould make out under any circumstances! I don't want to try to make out\nwithout you! It isn't sense!\" Then he scowled helplessly. \"Dammit, I've\nstaged plenty of shows in which a man asked a girl to marry him, and\nthey were all phoney. It's different, now that _I_ mean it! What's a\ngood way to ask you to marry me?\"\n\nBabs looked momentarily up into his face. She smiled ever so faintly.\n\n\"They're watching us from the ports,\" she said. \"If you want my\nviewpoint--If we were to wave to them that we'll be right back, we can\nget some more of those fruits I cooked. It might be interesting to have\nsome to show them.\"\n\nHe scowled more deeply than before.\n\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way. But if that's it--\"\n\n\"And on the way,\" said Babs. \"When they're not watching, you might kiss\nme.\"\n\nThey had a considerable pile of the red-fleshed fruits ready when the\nground had cooled enough for them to reach the landing-sling.\n\nOnce aboard the ship, Cochrane headed for the control-room, with Jamison\nand Bell tagging after him. Bell had an argument.\n\n\"But the volcano's calmed down--there's only a wall of steam where the\nlava hit the glaciers--and we could fix up a story in a couple of hours!\nI've got background shots! You and Babs could make the story-scenes and\nwe'd have a castaway story! Perfect! The first true castaway story from\nthe stars--. You know what that would mean!\"\n\nCochrane snarled at him.\n\n\"Try it and I'll tear you limb from limb! I've put enough of other\npeople's private lives on the screen! My own stays off! I'm not going to\nhave even a phoney screen-show built around Babs and me for people to\ngabble about!\"\n\nBell said in an injured tone:\n\n\"I'm only trying to do a good job! I started off on this business as a\nwriter. I haven't had a real chance to show what I can do with this sort\nof material!\"\n\n\"Forget it!\" Cochrane snapped again. \"Stick to your cameras!\"\n\nJamison said hopefully:\n\n\"You'll give me some data on plants and animals, Mr. Cochrane? Won't\nyou? I'm doing a book with Bell's pictures, and--\"\n\n\"Let me alone!\" raged Cochrane.\n\nHe reached the control-room. Al, the pilot, sat at the controls with an\nair of special alertness.\n\n\"You're all right? For our lined up trip, we ought to leave in about\ntwenty minutes. We'll be pointing just about right then.\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Cochrane. \"And you can take off when you please.\"\nTo Jones he said: \"How'd you find us? I didn't think it could be done.\"\n\n\"Doctor Holden figured it out,\" said Jones. \"Simple enough, but I was\nlost! When the ground-shocks came, everybody else ran to the ship. We\nwaited for you. You didn't come.\" It had been, of course, because\nCochrane would not risk taking Babs through a forest in which trees were\nfalling. \"We finally had to choose between taking off and crashing. So\nwe took off.\"\n\n\"That was quite right. We'd all be messed up if you hadn't,\" Cochrane\ntold him.\n\nJones waved his hands.\n\n\"I didn't think we could ever find you again. We were sixty light-years\naway when that booster effect died out. Then Doctor Holden got on the\ncommunicator. He got Earth. The astronomers back there located us and\ngave us the line to get back by. We found the planet. Even then I didn't\nsee how we'd pick out the valley. But Doc had had 'em checking the shots\nwe transmitted as we were making our landing. We had the whole first\napproach on film-tape. They put a crowd of map-comparators to work. We\nwent in a Space Platform orbit around the planet, transmitting what we\nsaw from out there--they figured the orbit for us, too--and they checked\nwhat we transmitted against what we'd photographed going down. So they\nwere able to spot the exact valley and tell us where to come down. We\nactually spotted this valley last night, but we couldn't land in the\ndark.\"\n\nCochrane felt abashed.\n\n\"I couldn't have done that job,\" he admitted, \"so I didn't think anybody\ncould. Hm. Didn't all this cost a lot of fuel?\"\n\nJones actually smiled.\n\n\"I worked out something. We don't use as much fuel as we did. We're\nprobably using too much now. Al--go ahead and lift. I want to check what\nthe new stuff does, anyhow. Take off!\"\n\nThe pilot threw a switch, and Jones threw another, a newly installed\none, just added to his improvised control-column. A light glowed\nbrightly. Al pressed one button, very gently. A roaring set up outside.\nThe ship started up. There was practically no feeling of acceleration,\nthis time. The ship rose lightly. Even the rocket-roar was mild indeed,\ncompared to its take-off from Luna and the sound of its first landing on\nthe planet just below.\n\nCochrane saw the valley floors recede, and mountain-walls drop below.\nFrom all directions, then, vegetation-filled valleys flowed toward the\nship, and underneath. Glaciers appeared, and volcanic cones, and then\nenormous stretches of white, with smoking dots here and there upon it.\nIn seconds, it seemed, the horizon was visibly curved. In other seconds\nthe planet being left behind was a monstrous white ball, and there were\npatches of intolerable white sunlight coming in the ports.\n\nAnd Cochrane felt queer. Jones had given the order for take-off. Jones\nhad determined to leave at this moment, because Jones had tests he\nwanted to make.... Cochrane felt like a passenger. From the man who\ndecided things because he was the one who knew what had to be done, he\nhad become something else. He had been absent two nights and part of a\nday, and decisions had been made in which he had no part--\n\nIt felt queer. It felt even startling.\n\n\"We're in a modification of the modified Dabney field now,\" observed\nJones in a gratified tone. \"You know the original theory.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" acknowledged Cochrane.\n\n\"The field's always a pipe, a tube, a column of stressed space between\nthe field-plates,\" Jones reminded him. \"When we landed the first time,\nback yonder, the tail of the ship wasn't in the field at all. The field\nstretched from the bow of the ship only, out to that last balloon we\ndropped. We were letting down at an angle to that line. It was like a\nkite and a string and the kite's tail. The string was the Dabney field,\nand the directions we were heading was the kite's tail.\"\n\nCochrane nodded. It occurred to him that Jones was very much unlike\nDabney. Jones had discovered the Dabney field, but having sold the\nfame-rights to it, he now apparently thought \"Dabney Field\" was the\nproper technical term for his own discovery, even in his own mind.\n\n\"Back on the moon,\" Jones went on zestfully, \"I wasn't sure that a field\nonce established would hold in atmosphere. I hoped that with enough\npower I could keep it, but I wasn't sure--\"\n\n\"This doesn't mean much to me, Jones,\" said Cochrane. \"What does it add\nup to?\"\n\n\"Why--the field held down into atmosphere. And we were out of the\nprimary field as far as the tail of the ship was concerned. But this\ntime we landed, I'd hooked in some ready-installed circuits. There was a\nsecond Dabney field from the stern of the ship to the bow. There was the\nmain one, going out to those balloons and then back to Earth. But there\nwas--and is--a second one only enclosing the ship. It's a sort of\nbubble. We can still trail a field behind us, and anybody can follow in\nany sort of ship that's put into it. But now the ship has a completely\nindependent, second field. Its tail is never outside!\"\n\nCochrane did not have the sort of mind to find such information either\nlucid or suggestive.\n\n\"So what happens?\"\n\n\"We have both plates of a Dabney field always with us,\" said Jones\ntriumphantly. \"We're always in a field, even landing in atmosphere, and\nthe ship has practically no mass even when it's letting down to landing.\nIt has weight, but next to no mass. Didn't you notice the difference?\"\n\n\"Stupid as it may seem, I didn't,\" admitted Cochrane. \"I haven't the\nleast idea what you're talking about.\"\n\nJones looked at him patiently.\n\n\"Now we can shoot our exhaust out of the field! The ship-field, not the\nmain one!\"\n\n\"I'm still numb,\" said Cochrane. \"Multiple sclerosis of the brain-cells,\nI suppose. Let me just take your word for it.\"\n\nJones tried once more.\n\n\"Try to see it! Listen! When we landed the first time we had to use a\nlot of fuel because the tail of the ship wasn't in the Dabney field. It\nhad mass. So we had to use a lot of rocket-power to slow down that mass.\nIn the field, the ship hasn't much mass--the amount depends on the\nstrength of the field--but rockets depend for their thrust on the mass\nthat's thrown away astern. Looked at that way, rockets shouldn't push\nhard in a Dabney field. There oughtn't to be any gain to be had by the\nfield at all. You see?\"\n\nCochrane fumbled in his head.\n\n\"Oh, yes. I thought of that. But there is an advantage. The ship does\nwork.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Jones, triumphant again, \"the field-effect depends\npartly on temperature! The gases in the rocket-blast are hot, away up in\nthe thousands of degrees. They don't have normal inertia, but they do\nhave what you might call heat-inertia. They acquire a sort of fictitious\nmass when they get hot enough. So we carry along fuel that hasn't any\ninertia to speak of when it's cold, but acquires a lunatic sort of\nsubstitute for inertia when it's genuinely hot. So a ship can travel in\na Dabney field!\"\n\n\"I'm relieved,\" acknowledged Cochrane. \"I thought you were about to tell\nme that we couldn't lift off the moon, and I was going to ask how we got\nhere.\"\n\nJones smiled patiently.\n\n\"What I'm telling you now is that we can shoot rocket-blasts out of the\nDabney field we make with the stern of the ship! Landing, we keep our\nfuel and the ship with next to no mass, and we shoot it out to where it\ndoes have mass, and the effect is practically the same as if we were\npushing against something solid! And so we started off with fuel for\nmaybe five or six landings and take-offs against Earth gravity. But with\nthis new trick, we've got fuel for a couple of hundred!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Cochrane mildly. \"This is the first thing you've said that\nmeant anything to me. Congratulations! What comes next?\"\n\n\"I thought you'd be pleased,\" said Jones. \"What I'm really telling you\nis that now we've got fuel enough to reach the Milky Way.\"\n\n\"Let's not,\" suggested Cochrane, \"and say we did! You've got a new star\npicked out to travel to?\"\n\nJones shrugged his shoulders. In him, the gesture indicated practically\nhysterical frustration. But he said:\n\n\"Yes. Twenty-one light-years. Back on Earth they're anxious for us to\ncheck on sol-type suns and Earth-type planets.\"\n\n\"For once,\" said Cochrane, \"I am one with the great scientific minds.\nLet's go over.\"\n\nHe made his way to the circular stairway leading down to the main\nsaloon. On his clumsy way across the saloon floor to the communicator,\nhe felt the peculiar sensation of the booster-current, which should\nhave been a sound, but wasn't. It was the sensation which had preceded\nthe preposterous leap of the space-ship away from Luna, when in a\nheart-beat of time all stars looked like streaks of light, and the ship\ntraveled nearly two light-centuries.\n\nSunshine blinked, and then shone again in the ports around the saloon\nwalls. The second shining came from a different direction--as if\nsomebody had switched off one exterior light and turned on another--and\nat a different angle to the floor.\n\nCochrane reached the communicator. He felt no weight. He strapped\nhimself into the chair. He switched on the vision-phone which sent\nradiation along the field to a balloon two hundred odd light-years from\nEarth--that was the balloon near the glacier planet--and then switched\nto the field traveling to a second balloon then the last hundred\nseventy-odd light-years back to the moon, and then from Luna City down\nto Earth.\n\nHe put in his call. He got an emergency message that had been waiting\nfor him. Seconds later he fought his way frantically through no-weight\nto the control-room again.\n\n\"Jamison! Bell!\" he cried desperately. \"We've got a broadcast due in\ntwenty minutes! I lost track of time! We're sponsored on four continents\nand we damwell have to put on a show! What the devil! Why didn't\nsomebody--\"\n\nJamison said obviously from a blister-port where he swung a squat\nstar-telescope from one object to another:\n\n\"Noo-o-o. That's a gas-giant. We'd be squashed if we landed\nthere--though that big moon looks promising. I think we'd better try\nyonder.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Jones in a flat voice. \"Center on the next one in, Al, and\nwe'll toddle over.\"\n\nCochrane felt the ship swinging in emptiness. He knew because it seemed\nto turn while he felt that he stayed still.\n\n\"We've got a show to put on!\" he raged. \"We've got to fake something--.\"\n\nJamison looked aside from his telescope.\n\n\"Tell him, Bell,\" he said expansively.\n\n\"I wrote a script of sorts,\" said Bell apologetically. \"The story-line's\nnot so good--that's why I wanted a castaway narrative to put in it,\nthough I wouldn't have had time, really. We spliced film and Jamison\nnarrated it, and you can run it off. It's a kind of show. We ran it as a\nspace-platform survey of the glacier-planet, basing it on pictures we\ntook while we were in orbit around it. It's a sort of travelogue.\nJamison did himself proud. Alicia can find the tape-can for you.\"\n\nHe went back to his cameras. Cochrane saw a monstrous globe swing past a\ncontrol-room port. It was a featureless mass of clouds, save for\nstriations across what must be its equator. It looked like the Lunar\nObservatory pictures of Jupiter, back in the Sun's family of planets.\n\nIt went past the port, and a moon swam into view. It was a very large\nmoon. It had at least one ice-cap--and therefore an atmosphere--and\nthere were mottlings of its surface which could hardly be anything but\ncontinents and seas.\n\n\"We've got to put a show on!\" raged Cochrane. \"And now!\"\n\n\"It's all set,\" Bell assured him. \"You can transmit it. I hope you like\nit!\"\n\nCochrane sputtered. But there was nothing to do but transmit whatever\nBell and Jamison had gotten ready. He swam with nightmarelike difficulty\nback to the communicator. He shouted frantically for Babs. She and\nAlicia came. Alicia found the film-tape, and Cochrane threaded it into\nthe transmitter, and bitterly ran the first few feet. Babs smiled at\nhim, and Alicia looked at him oddly. Evidently, Babs had confided the\nconsequence of their casting-away. But Cochrane faced an emergency. He\nbegan to check timings with far-distant Earth.\n\nWhen the ship approached a second planet, Cochrane saw nothing of it. He\nwas furiously monitoring the broadcast of a show in which he'd had no\nhand at all. From his own, professional standpoint it was terrible.\nJamison spouted interminably, so Cochrane considered. Al, the pilot, was\nactually interviewed by an offscreen voice! But the pictures from space\nwere excellent. While the ship floated in orbit, waiting to descend to\npick up Babs and Cochrane, Bell had hooked his camera to an amplifying\ntelescope and he did have magnificent shots of dramatic terrain on the\nplanet now twenty light-years behind.\n\nCochrane watched the show in a mingling of jealousy and relief. It was\nnot as good as he would have done. But fortunately, Bell and Jamison had\nstuck fairly close to straight travelogue-stuff, and close-up shots of\nvegetation and animals had been interspersed with the remoter pictures\nwith moderate competence, if without undue imagination. An audience\nwhich had not seen many shows of the kind would be thrilled. It even\namounted to a valid change of pace. Anybody who watched this would at\nleast want to see more and different pictures from the stars.\n\nHalfway through, he heard the now-muffled noise of rockets. He knew the\nship was descending through atmosphere by the steady sound, though he\nhad not the faintest idea what was outside. He ground his teeth as--for\ntiming--he received the commercial inserted in the film. The U. S.\ncommercials served the purpose, of course. He could not watch the other\npictures shown to residents of other than North America in the\ncommercial portions of the show.\n\nHe was counting seconds to resume transmission when he felt the slight\nbut distant impact which meant that the ship had touched ground. A very\nshort time after, even the lessened, precautionary rocket-roar cut off.\n\nCochrane ground his teeth. The ship had landed on a planet he had not\nseen and in whose choice he had had no hand. He was humiliated. The\nother members of the ship's company looked out at scenes no other human\neyes had ever beheld.\n\nHe regarded the final commercial, inserted into the broadcast for its\nAmerican sponsor. It showed, purportedly, the true story of two girl\nfriends, one blonde and one brunette, who were wall-flowers at all\nparties. They tried frantically to remedy the situation by the use of\nthis toothpaste and that, and this deodorant and the other. In vain! But\nthen they became the centers of all the festivities they attended, as\nsoon as they began to wash their hair with Rayglo Shampoo.\n\nHolden and Johnny Simms came clattering down from the control-room\ntogether. They looked excited. They plunged together toward the\nstair-well that would take them to the deck on which the airlock opened.\n\nHolden panted,\n\n\"Jed! Creatures outside! They look like men!\"\n\nThe communicator-screen faithfully monitored the end of the commercial.\nTwo charming girls, radiant and lovely, raised their voices in grateful\nsong, hymning the virtues of Rayglo Shampoo. There followed brisk\nreminders of the superlative, magical results obtained by those who used\nRayglo Foundation Cream, Rayglo Kisspruf Lipstick, and Rayglo home\npermanent--in four strengths; for normal, hard-to-wave, easy-to-wave,\nand children's hair.\n\nCochrane heard the clanking of the airlock door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n\nHe made for the control-room, where the ports offered the highest and\nwidest and best views of everything outside. When he arrived, Babs and\nAlicia stood together, staring out and down. Bell frantically worked a\ncamera. Jamison gaped at the outer world. Al the pilot made frustrated\ngestures, not quite daring to leave his controls while there was even an\noutside chance the ship's landing-fins might find flaws in their\nsupport. Jones adjusted something on the new set of controls he had\nestablished for the extra Dabney field. Jones was not wholly normal in\nsome ways. He was absorbed in technical matters even more fully than\nCochrane in his own commercial enterprises.\n\nCochrane pushed to a port to see.\n\nThe ship had landed in a small glade. There were trees nearby. The trees\nhad extremely long, lanceolate leaves, roughly the shape of grass-blades\nstretched out even longer. In the gentle breeze that blew outside, they\nwaved extravagantly. There were hills in the distance, and nearby\nout-croppings of gray rocks. This sky was blue like the sky of Earth. It\nwas, of course, inevitable that any colorless atmosphere with\ndust-particles suspended in it would establish a blue sky.\n\nHolden was visible below, moving toward a patch of reed-like vegetation\nrising some seven or eight feet from the rolling soil. He had hopped\nquickly over the scorched area immediately outside the ship. It was much\nsmaller than that made by the first landing on the other planet, but\neven so he had probably damaged his footwear to excess. But he now stood\na hundred yards from the ship. He made gestures. He seemed to be\ntalking, as if trying to persuade some living creature to show itself.\n\n\"We saw them peeping,\" said Babs breathlessly, coming beside Cochrane.\n\"Once one of them ran from one patch of reeds to another. It looked\nlike a man. There are at least three of them in there--whatever they\nare!\"\n\n\"They can't be men,\" said Cochrane grimly. \"They can't!\" Johnny Simms\nwas not in sight. \"Where's Simms?\"\n\n\"He has a gun,\" said Babs. \"He was going to get one, anyhow, so he could\nprotect Doctor Holden.\"\n\nCochrane glanced straight down. The airlock door was open, and the end\nof a weapon peered out. Johnny Simms might be in a better position there\nto protect Holden by gun-fire, but he was assuredly safer, himself.\nThere was no movement anywhere. Holden did not move closer to the reeds.\nHe still seemed to be speaking soothingly to the unseen creatures.\n\n\"Why can't there be men here?\" asked Babs. \"I don't mean actually men,\nbut--manlike creatures? Why couldn't there be rational creatures like\nus? I know you said so but--\"\n\nCochrane shook his head. He believed implicitly that there could not be\nmen on this planet. On the glacier planet every animal had been\nseparately devised from the creatures of Earth. There were resemblances,\nexplicable as the result of parallel evolution. By analogy, there could\nnot be exactly identical mankind on another world because evolution\nthere would be parallel but not the same. But if there were even a\nmental equal to men, no matter how unhuman such a creature might appear,\nif there were a really rational animal anywhere in the cosmos off of\nEarth, the result would be catastrophic.\n\n\"We humans,\" Cochrane told her, \"live by our conceit. We demand more\nthan animality of ourselves because we believe we are more than\nanimals--and we believe we are the only creatures that are! If we came\nto believe we were not unique, but were simply a cleverer animal, we'd\nbe finished. Every nation has always started to destroy itself every\ntime such an idea spread.\"\n\n\"But we aren't only clever animals!\" protested Babs. \"We _are_ unique!\"\n\nCochrane glanced at her out of the corner of his eye.\n\n\"Quite true.\"\n\nHolden still stood patiently before the patch of reeds, still seemed to\ntalk, still with his hands outstretched in what men consider the\nuniversal sign of peace.\n\nThere was a sudden movement at the back of the reed-patch, quite fifty\nyards from Holden. A thing which did look like a man fled madly for the\nnearest edge of woodland. It was the size of a man. It had the\npinkish-tan color of naked human flesh. It ran with its head down, and\nit could not be seen too clearly, but it was startlingly manlike in\noutline. Up in the control-room Bell fairly yipped with excitement and\nswung his camera. Holden remained oblivious. He still tried to lure\nsomething out of concealment. A second creature raced for the woods.\n\nTiny gray threads appeared in the air between the airlock and the racing\nthing. Smoke. Johnny Simms was shooting zestfully at the unidentified\nanimal. He was using that tracer ammunition which poor shots and worse\nsportsmen adopt to make up for bad marksmanship.\n\nThe threads of smoke seemed to form a net about the running things. They\ndodged and zig-zagged frantically. Both of them reached safety.\n\nA third tried it. And now Johnny Simms turned on automatic fire. Bullets\nspurted from his weapon, trailing threads of smoke so that the trails\nlooked like a stream from a hose. The stream swept through the space\noccupied by the fugitive. It leaped convulsively and crashed to earth.\nIt kicked blindly.\n\nCochrane swore. Between the instant of the beginning of the creature's\nflight and this instant, less than two seconds had passed.\n\nThe threads which were smoke-trails drifted away. Then a new thread\nstreaked out. Johnny Simms fired once more at his still-writhing victim.\nIt kicked violently and was still.\n\nHolden turned angrily. There seemed to be shoutings between him and\nJohnny Simms. Then Holden trudged around the reed-patch. There was no\nlonger any sign of life in the still shape on the ground. But it was\nnormal precaution not to walk into a jungle-like thicket in which\nunknown, large living things had recently been sighted. Johnny Simms\nfired again and again from his post in the airlock. The smoke which\ntraced his bullets ranged to the woodland. He shot at imagined targets\nthere. He fired at his previous victim simply because it was something\nto shoot at. He shot recklessly, foolishly.\n\nAlicia, his wife, touched Jamison on the arm and spoke to him urgently.\nJamison followed her reluctantly down the stairs. She would be going to\nthe airlock. Johnny Simms, shooting at the landscape, might shoot\nHolden. A thread of bullet-smoke passed within feet of Holden's body. He\nturned and shouted back at the ship.\n\nThe inner airlock door clanked open. There was the sound of a shot, and\nthe dead thing was hit again. The bullet had been fired dangerously\nclose to Holden. There were voices below. Johnny Simms bellowed\nenragedly.\n\nAlicia cried out.\n\nThere was silence below, but Cochrane was already plunging toward the\nstairs. Babs followed closely.\n\nWhen they rushed down onto the dining-room deck they found Alicia\ndeathly white, but with a flaming red mark on her cheek. They found\nJohnny Simms roaring with rage, waving the weapon he'd been shooting.\nJamison was uneasily in the act of trying to placate him.\n\n\"----!\" bellowed Johnny Simms. \"I came on this ship to hunt! I'm going\nto hunt! Try and stop me!\"\n\nHe waved his weapon.\n\n\"I paid my money!\" he shouted. \"I won't take orders from anybody! Nobody\ncan boss me!\"\n\nCochrane said icily:\n\n\"I can! Stop being a fool! Put down that gun! You nearly shot Holden!\nYou might still kill somebody. Put it down!\"\n\nHe walked grimly toward Johnny Simms. Johnny was near the open airlock\ndoor. The outer door was open, too. He could not retreat. He edged\nsidewise. Cochrane changed the direction of his advance. There are\npeople like Johnny Simms everywhere. As a rule they are not classed as\nunable to tell right from wrong unless they are rich enough to hire a\npsychiatrist. Yet a variable but always-present percentage of the human\nrace ignores rules of conduct at all times. They are the handicap, the\nburden, the main hindrance to the maintenance or the progress of\ncivilization. They are not consciously evil. They simply do not bother\nto act otherwise than as rational animals. The rest of humanity has to\ndefend itself with police, with laws, and sometimes with revolts, though\nthose like Johnny Simms have no motive beyond the indulgence of\nimmediate inclinations. But for that indulgence Johnny would risk any\ninjury to anybody else.\n\nHe edged further aside. Cochrane was white with disgusted fury. Johnny\nSimms went into panic. He raised his weapon, aiming at Cochrane.\n\n\"Keep back!\" he cried ferociously. \"I don't care if I kill you!\"\n\nAnd he did not. It was the stark senselessness which makes juvenile\ndelinquents and Hitlers, and causes thugs and hoodlums and snide lawyers\nand tricky business men. It was the pure perversity which makes sane\nmen frustrate. It was an example of that infinite stupidity which is\ncrime, but is also only stupidity.\n\nCochrane saw Babs pulling competently at one of the chairs at one of the\ntables nearby. He stopped, and Johnny Simms took courage. Cochrane said\nicily:\n\n\"Just what the hell do you think we're here for, anyhow?\"\n\nJohnny Simms' eyes were wide and blank, like the eyes of a small boy in\na frenzy of destruction, when he has forgotten what he started out to do\nand has become obsessed with what damage he is doing.\n\n\"I'm not going to be pushed around!\" cried Johnny Simms, more\nferociously still. \"From now on I'm going to tell you what to do--\"\n\nBabs swung the chair she had slid from its fastenings. It came down with\na satisfying \"_thunk_\" on Johnny Simms' head. His gun went off. The\nbullet missed Cochrane by fractions of an inch. He plunged ahead.\n\nSome indefinite time later, Babs was pulling desperately at him. He had\nJohnny Simms on the floor and was throttling him. Johnny Simms strangled\nand tore at his fingers.\n\nSanity came back to Cochrane with the effect of something snapping. He\ngot up. He nodded to Babs and she picked up the gun Johnny Simms had\nused.\n\n\"I think,\" said Cochrane, breathing hard, \"that you're a good sample of\neverything I dislike. The worst thing you do is make me act like you! If\nyou touch a gun again on this ship, I'll probably kill you. If you get\narrogant again, I will beat the living daylights out of you! Get up!\"\n\nJohnny Simms got up. He looked thoroughly scared. Then, amazingly, he\nbeamed at Cochrane. He said amiably:\n\n\"I forgot. I'm that way. Alicia'll tell you. I don't blame you for\ngetting mad. I'm sorry. But I'm that way!\"\n\nHe brushed himself off, beaming at Alicia and Jamison and Babs and\nCochrane. Cochrane ground his teeth. He went to the airlock and looked\ndown outside.\n\nHolden was bent over the creature Johnny Simms had killed. He\nstraightened up and came back toward the ship. He went faster when the\nground grew hot under his feet. He fairly leaped into the landing-sling\nand started it up.\n\n\"Not human,\" he reported to Cochrane when he slipped from the sling in\nthe airlock. \"There's no question about it when you are close. It's more\nnearly a bird than anything else. It was warm-blooded. It has a beak.\nThere are penguins on Earth that have been mistaken for men.\n\n\"I did a show once,\" said Cochrane coldly, \"that had clips of old films\nof cockfighting in it. There was a kind of gamecock called Cornish Game\nthat was fairly manshaped. If it had been big enough--Pull in the sling\nand close the lock. We're moving.\"\n\nHe turned away. Babs stood by Alicia, offering a handkerchief for Alicia\nto put to her cheek. Jamison listened unhappily as Johnny Simms\nexplained brightly that he had always been that way. When he got excited\nhe didn't realize what he was doing. He said almost with pride that he\nhadn't ever been any other way than that. He didn't really mean to kill\nanybody, but when he got excited--.\n\n\"What happened?\" demanded Holden.\n\n\"Our little psychopath,\" said Cochrane in a grating voice, \"put on an\nact. He threatened me with a rifle. He hit Alicia first. Jamison, trace\nthat bullet-hole. See if it got through to the skin of the ship.\"\n\nHe started for the stairs again. Then he was startled by the frozen\nimmobility of Holden. Holden's face was deadly. His hands were clenched.\nJohnny Simms said with a fine boyish frankness:\n\n\"I'm sorry, Cochrane! No hard feelings?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Cochrane snapped. \"Hard feelings! I've got them!\"\n\nHe took Holden's arm. He steered him up the steps. Holden resisted for\nthe fraction of a second, and Cochrane gripped his arm tighter. He got\nhim up to the deck above.\n\n\"If I'd been here,\" said Holden, unsteadily, \"I'd have killed him--if he\nhit Alicia! Psychopath or no psychopath--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" said Cochrane firmly. \"He shot at me! And in my small way I'm\na psychopath too, Bill. My psychosis is that I don't like his kind of\npsychosis. I am psychotically devoted to sense and my possibly quaint\nidea of decency. I am abnormally concerned with the real world--and\nyou'd better come back to it! Look here! I'm pathologically in revolt\nagainst such imbecilities as an overcrowded Earth and people being\nafraid of their jobs and people going crackpot from despair. You don't\nwant me to get cured of that, do you? Then get hold of yourself!\"\n\nBill Holden swallowed. He was still white. But he managed to grimace.\n\n\"You're right. Lucky I was outside. You're not a bad psychologist\nyourself, Jed.\"\n\n\"I'm better,\" said Cochrane cynically, \"at putting on shows with scrap\nfilm-tape and dream-stuff. So I'm going to look at the films Bell took\nas we landed on this planet, and work out some ideas for broadcasts.\"\n\nHe went up another flight, and Holden went with him in a sort of stilly,\nunnatural calm. Cochrane ran the film-tape through the reversed camera\nfor examination.\n\nOutside, there waved long green tresses of extraordinarily elongated\nleaves. The patches of reed-like stuff stirred in the breeze. Jamison\nappeared in the control-room. He began to question Holden hopefully\nabout the ground-cover outside. It was not grass. It was broad-leaved.\nThere would be, Jamison decided happily, an infinitude of under-leaf\nforms of life. They would most likely be insects, and there would be\ncarnivorous other insects to prey upon them. Some species would find it\nadvantageous to be burrowing insects. There must be other kinds of birds\nthan the giant specimens that looked like men at a distance, too. On the\nglacier planet there had been few birds but many furry creatures.\nPossibly the situation was reversed here, though of course it need not\nbe ...\n\n\"Hm,\" said Cochrane when the films were all run through. \"Ice-caps and\nland and seas. Plenty of green vegetation, so presumably the air is\nnormal for humans. Since you're alive, Holden, we can assume it isn't\ninstantly fatal, can't we? The gravity's tolerable--a little on the\nlight side, maybe, compared to the glacier planet.\"\n\nHe was silent, staring at the blank wall of the control-room. He\nfrowned. Suddenly he said:\n\n\"Does anybody back on Earth know that Babs and I were castaways?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Holden, still very quiet indeed. \"Alicia ran the\ncontrol-board. She told everybody you were too busy to be called to the\ncommunicator. It was queer with you away! Jamison and Bell tied\nthemselves in chairs and spliced tape. Johnny, of course\"--his voice was\nvery carefully toneless--\"wouldn't do anything useful. I was space-sick\na lot of the time. But I did help Alicia figure out what to say on the\ncommunicator. There must be hundreds of calls backed up for you to\ntake.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Cochrane. \"I'll go take some of them. Jones, could we make\na flit to somewhere else on this planet?\"\n\nJones said negligently,\n\n\"I told you we've got fuel to reach the Milky Way. Where do you want to\ngo?\"\n\n\"Anywhere,\" said Cochrane. \"The scenery isn't dramatic enough here for a\nnew broadcast. We've got to have some lurid stuff for our next show.\nThings are shaping up except for the need of just the right scenery to\nsend back to Earth.\"\n\n\"What kind of scenery do you want?\"\n\n\"Animals preferred,\" said Cochrane. \"Dinosaurs would do. Or buffalo or a\nreasonable facsimile. What I'd actually like more than anything else\nwould really be a herd of buffalo.\"\n\nJamison gasped.\n\n\"Buffalo?\"\n\n\"Meat,\" said Cochrane in an explanatory tone. \"On the hoof. The\npublic-relations job all this has turned into, demands a careful\nstimulation of all the basic urges. So I want people to think of steaks\nand chops and roasts. If I could get herds of animals from one horizon\nto another--.\"\n\n\"Meat-herds coming up,\" said Jones negligently. \"I'll call you.\"\n\nCochrane did not believe him. He went down to the communicator again. He\nprepared to take the calls from Earth that had been backed up behind the\nemergency demand for an immediate broadcast-show that he'd met while the\nship came to its landing. There was an enormous amount of business piled\nup. And it was slow work handling it. His voice took six seconds to pass\nthrough something over two hundred light-years of space in the Dabney\nfield, and then two seconds in normal space from the relay in Lunar\nCity. It was twelve seconds between the time he finished saying\nsomething before the first word of the reply reached him. It was very\nslow communication. He reflected annoyedly that he'd have to ask Jones\nto make a special Dabney field communication field as strong as was\nnecessary to take care of the situation.\n\nThe rockets growled and roared outside. The ship lifted. Johnny Simms\ncame storming up from below.\n\n\"My trophy!\" he cried indignantly. \"I want my trophy!\"\n\nCochrane looked up impatiently from the screen.\n\n\"What trophy?\"\n\n\"The thing I shot!\" cried Johnny Simms fiercely. \"I want to have it\nmounted! Nobody else ever killed anything like that! I want it!\"\n\nThe ship surged upward more strongly. Cochrane said coldly:\n\n\"It's too late now. Get out. I'm busy.\"\n\nHe returned his eyes to the screen. Johnny Simms raced for the stairs. A\nlittle later Cochrane heard shoutings in the control-room. But he was\ntoo busy to inquire.\n\nThe ship drifted--with all the queasy sensation of no-weight--and lifted\nagain, and then there was a fairly long period of weightlessness. At\nsuch times Holden would be greenish and sick and tormented by\nspace-sickness. Which might be good for him at this particular time. For\na long time, it seemed, there were alternating periods of lift and free\nfall, which in themselves were disturbing. Once the free fall lasted\nuntil Cochrane began to feel uneasy. But then the rockets roared once\nmore and boomed loudly as if the ship were leaving the planet\naltogether.\n\nBut Cochrane was talking business. In part he bluffed. In part, quite\nautomatically, he demanded much more than he expected to get, simply\nbecause it is the custom in business not to be frank about anything.\nWhatever he asked, the other man would offer less. So he asked too much,\nand the other man offered too little, each knowing in advance very\nnearly on what terms they would finally settle. Considering the cost of\nbeam-phone time to Lunar City, not to mention the extension to the\nstars, it was absurd, but it was the way business is done.\n\nPresently Cochrane called Babs and Alicia and had them witness a\ntentative agreement, which had to be ratified by a board of directors of\na corporation back on Earth. That board would jump at it, but the\nstipulation for possible cancellation had to be made. It was\nmumbo-jumbo. Cochrane felt satisfyingly competent at handling it.\n\nWhile the formalities were in progress, the ship surged and fell and\nswayed and surged again. Cochrane said ruefully:\n\n\"I hate to ask you to work under conditions like this, Babs.\"\n\nBabs grinned. He flushed a little.\n\n\"I know! When you were working for me I wasn't considerate.\"\n\n\"Who am I working for now?\"\n\n\"Us,\" said Cochrane. Then he looked guiltily at Alicia. He felt\nembarrassment at having said anything in the least sentimental before\nher. Considering Johnny Simms, it was not too tactful. Her cheek, where\nit had been red, now showed a distinct bruise. He said: \"Sorry,\nAlicia--about Johnny.\"\n\n\"I got into it myself,\" said Alicia. \"I loved him. He isn't really bad.\nIf you want to know, I think he simply decided years ago that he\nwouldn't grow up past the age of six. He was a rich man's spoiled little\nboy. It was fun. So he made a career of it. His family let him. I\"--she\nsmiled faintly, \"I'm making a career of taking care of him.\"\n\n\"Something can be done even with a six-year-old,\" growled Cochrane.\n\"Holden--. But he wouldn't be the best one to try.\"\n\n\"He definitely wouldn't be the best one to try,\" said Alicia very\nquietly.\n\nCochrane turned away. She knew how Bill Holden felt. Which might or\nmight not be comforting to him.\n\nThe communicator again. The pictures of foot-high furry bipeds on the\nglacier planet had made a sensation on television. A toy-manufacturer\nwanted the right to make toys like them. The pictures were copyrighted.\nCochrane matter-of-factly made the deal. There would be miniature\nextra-terrestrial animals on sale in all toy-shops within days.\nSpaceways, Inc., would collect a royalty on each toy sold.\n\nThe rockets boomed, and lessened their noise, and wavered up and down\nagain. Then there was that deliberate, crunching feel of the great\nlanding-fins pressing into soil with all the ship's weight bearing down.\nThe rockets ran on, drumming ever-so-faintly, for a little longer. Then\nthey cut off.\n\n\"We're landed again! Let's see where we are!\"\n\nThey went up to the control-room. Johnny Simms stood against the wall,\nsulking. He had managed his life very successfully by acting like a\nspoiled little boy. Now he had lost any idea of saner conduct. At the\nmoment, he looked ridiculous. But Alicia had a bruised cheek and\nCochrane could have been killed, and Holden had been in danger because\nJohnny Simms wanted to and insisted on acting like a rich man's spoiled\nlittle boy.\n\nIt occurred to Cochrane that Alicia would probably find recompense for\nher humiliation and pain in the little-boy penitence--exactly as\ntemporary as any other little-boy emotion--when she and Johnny Simms\nwere alone together.\n\nThe ship had come down close to the sunset-line of the planet. Away to\nthe west there was the glint of blue sea. Dusk was already descending\nhere. There were smoothly contoured hills in view, and there was a dark\npatch of forest on one hilltop, and the trees at the woodland's edge had\nthe same drooping, grass-blade-like foliage of the trees first seen. But\nthere were larger and more solid giants among them. The ship had landed\non a small plateau, and downhill from it a spring gushed out with such\nforce that the water-surface was rounded by pressure from below. The\nwater overflowed and went down toward the sea.\n\n\"I think we're all right,\" said Al, the pilot. But he stayed in his\nseat, in case the ship threatened to sway over. Cochrane inspected the\nouter world.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"We sighted what I think you want,\" said Jones. He looked dead-pan and\nyet secretly complacent. \"Just watch.\"\n\nThe dusk grew deeper. Colorings appeared in the west. They were very\nsimilar to the sunset-colorings on Earth.\n\n\"Not many volcanoes here.\"\n\nThe amount of dust was limited, as on Earth. A great star winked into\nview in the east. It was as bright as Venus seen from Earth. It had a\njust-perceptible disk. Close to it, infinitely small, there was a speck\nof light which seemed somehow like a star. Cochrane squinted at it. He\nthought of the great gas-giant world he'd seen out a port on the way\nhere. It had an attendant moon-world which itself had icecaps and seas\nand continents. He called Jamison.\n\n\"I think that's the planet,\" agreed Jamison. \"We passed close by it. We\nsaw it.\"\n\n\"It had a moon,\" observed Cochrane. \"A big one. It looked like a world\nitself. What would it be like there?\"\n\n\"Cooler than this,\" said Jamison promptly, \"because it's farther from\nthe sun. But it might pick up some heat from reflection from its\nprimary's white clouds. It would be a fair world. It has oceans and\ncontinents and strings of foam-girt islands. But its sea is strange and\ndark and restless. Gigantic tides surge in its depths, drawn by the\nplanetary colossus about which it swings. Its animal life--.\"\n\n\"Cut,\" said Cochrane dryly. \"What do you really think? Could it be\nanother inhabitable world for people to move to?\"\n\nJamison looked annoyed at having been cut off.\n\n\"Probably,\" he said more prosaically. \"The tides would be monstrous,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Might be used for power,\" said Cochrane. \"We'll see ...\"\n\nThen Jones spoke with elaborate casualness:\n\n\"Here's something to look at. On the ground.\"\n\nCochrane moved to see. The dusk had deepened still more. The smooth,\ngreen-covered ground had become a dark olive. Where bare hillsides gave\nupon the sky, there were dark masses flowing slowly forward. The edges\nof the hills turned black, and the blackness moved down their nearer\nslopes. It was not an even front of darkness. There were patches which\npreceded the others. They did not stay distinct. They merged with the\nmasses which followed them, and other patches separated in their places.\nAll of the darkness moved without haste, with a sort of inexorable\ndeliberation. It moved toward the ship and the valley and the gushing\nfountain and the stream which flowed from it.\n\n\"What on Earth--\" began Cochrane.\n\n\"You're not on Earth,\" said Jones chidingly. \"Al and I found 'em. You\nasked for buffalo or a reasonable facsimile. I won't guarantee anything;\nbut we spotted what looked like herds of beasts moving over the green\nplains inland. We checked, and they seemed to be moving in this\ndirection. Once we dropped down low and Bell got some pictures. When he\nenlarged them, we decided they'd do. So we lined up where they were all\nheaded for, and here we are. And here they are!\"\n\nCochrane stared with all his eyes. Behind him, he heard Bell fuming to\nhimself as he tried to adjust a camera for close-up pictures in the\nlittle remaining light. Babs stood beside Cochrane, staring\nincredulously.\n\nThe darkness was beasts. They blackened the hillsides on three sides of\nthe ship. They came deliberately, leisurely onward. They were literally\nuncountable. They were as numerous as the buffalo that formerly thronged\nthe western plains of America. In black, shaggy masses, they came toward\nthe spring and its stream. Nearby, their heads could be distinguished.\nAnd all of this was perfectly natural.\n\nThe cosmos is one thing. Where life exists, its living creatures will\nfit themselves cunningly into each niche where life can be maintained.\nOn vast green plains there will be animals to graze--and there will be\nanimals to prey on them. So the grazing things will band together in\nherds for self-defense and reproduction. And where the ground is covered\nwith broad-leaved plants, such plants will shelter innumerable tiny\ncreatures, and some of them will be burrowers. So rain will drain\nquickly into those burrowings and not make streams. And therefore the\ndrainage will reappear as springs, and the grazing animals will go to\nthose springs to drink. Often, they will gather more densely at\nnightfall for greater protection from their enemies. They will even\noften gather at the springs or their overflowing brooks. This will\nhappen anywhere that plains and animals exist, on any planet to the edge\nof the galaxy, because there are laws for living things as well as\nstones.\n\nGreat dark masses of the beasts moved unhurriedly past the ship. They\nwere roughly the size of cattle--which itself would be determined by the\ngravity of the planet, setting a maximum favorable size for grazing\nbeasts with an ample food-supply. There were thousands and tens of\nthousands of them visible in the deepening night. They crowded to the\ngushing spring and to the stream that flowed from it. They drank.\nSometimes groups of them waited patiently until the way to the water was\nclear.\n\n\"Well?\" said Jones.\n\n\"I think you filled my order,\" admitted Cochrane.\n\nThe night became starlight only, and Cochrane impatiently demanded of Al\nor somebody that they measure the length of a complete day and night on\nthis planet. The stars would move overhead at such-and-such a rate. So\nmany degrees in so much time. He needed, said Cochrane--as if this order\nalso could be filled--a day-length not more than six hours shorter or\nlonger than an Earth-day.\n\nJones and Al conferred and prepared to take some sort of reading without\nany suitable instrument. Cochrane moved restlessly about. He did not\nnotice Johnny Simms. Johnny had stood sullenly in his place, not moving\nto look out the windows, ostentatiously ignoring everything and\neverybody. And nobody paid attention! It was not a matter to offend an\nadult, but it was very shocking indeed to a rich man's son who had been\nable to make a career of staying emotionally at a six-year-old level.\n\nCochrane's thoughts were almost feverish. If the day-length here was\nsuitable, all his planning was successful. If it was too long or too\nshort, he had grimly to look further--and Spaceways, Inc., would still\nnot be as completely a success as he wanted. It would have been much\nsimpler to have measured the apparent size of the local sun by any means\navailable, and then simply to have timed the intervals between its\ntouching of the horizon and its complete setting. But Cochrane hadn't\nthought of it at sunset.\n\nPresently he wandered down to where Babs and Alicia worked in the\nkitchen to prepare a meal. He tried to help. The atmosphere was much\nmore like that in a small apartment back home than on a space-ship among\nthe stars. This was not in any way such a journey of exploration as the\nwriters of fiction had imagined. Jamison came down presently and offered\nto prepare some special dish in which he claimed to excel. There was no\nmention of Johnny Simms. Alicia, elaborately ignoring all that was past,\ntold Jamison that Babs and Cochrane were now an acknowledged romance and\nactually had plans for marriage immediately the ship returned to Earth.\nJamison made the usual inept jests suited to such an occasion.\n\nPresently they called the others to dinner. Jones and Johnny Simms were\nlong behind the others, and Jones' expression was conspicuously\ndead-pan. Johnny Simms looked sulkily rebellious. His sulking had not\nattracted attention in the control-room. He had meant to refuse sulkily\nto come to dinner. But Jones wouldn't trust him--alone in the\ncontrol-room. Now he sat down, scowling, and ostentatiously refused to\neat, despite Alicia's coaxing. He snarled at her.\n\nThis, also, was not in the tradition of the behavior of voyagers of\nspace. They dined in the over-large saloon of a ship that had never been\nmeant really to leave the moon. The ship stood upright under strange\nstars upon a stranger world, and all about it outside there were the\nresting forms of thousands upon thousands of creatures like cattle. And\nthe dinner-table conversation was partly family-style jests about Babs'\nand Cochrane's new romantic status, and partly about a television\nbroadcast which had to be ready for a certain number of Earth-hours yet\nahead. And nobody paid any attention to Johnny Simms, glowering at the\ntable and refusing to eat.\n\nIt was a mistake, probably.\n\nMuch, much later, Cochrane and Babs were again in the control-room, and\nthis time they were alone.\n\n\"Look!\" said Cochrane vexedly. \"Do you realize that I haven't kissed you\nsince we got back on the ship? What happened?\"\n\n\"You!\" said Babs indignantly. \"You've been thinking about something else\nevery second of the time!\"\n\nCochrane did not think about anything else for several minutes. He began\nto recall with new tolerance the insane antics of people he had been\nproducing shows about. They had reason--those imaginary people--to act\nunreasonably.\n\nBut presently his mind was working again.\n\n\"We've got to make some plans for ourselves,\" he said. \"We can live back\non Earth, of course. We've already made a neat sum out of the broadcasts\nfrom this trip. But I don't think we'll want to live the way one has to\nlive on Earth, with too many people there. I'd like--.\"\n\nSomebody came clattering up the stairs from below.\n\n\"Johnny?\" It was Bell. \"Is he up here?\"\n\nCochrane released Babs.\n\n\"No. He's not here. Why?\"\n\n\"He's missing,\" said Bell apprehensively. \"Alicia says he took a gun. A\ngun's gone, anyhow. He's vanished!\"\n\nCochrane swore under his breath. A fool asserting his dignity with a gun\ncould be a serious matter indeed. He switched on the control-room\nlights. He was not there. They went down and hunted over the main\nsaloon. He was not there. Then Holden called harshly from the next deck\ndown.\n\nThere was Alicia by the inner airlock door. Her face was deathly pale.\nShe had opened the door. The outer door was open too--and it had not\nbeen opened since this last landing by anybody else. The landing-sling\ncables were run out. They swung slowly in the light that fell upon them\nfrom the inside of the ship.\n\nA smell came in the opening. It was the smell of beasts. It was a musky,\nammoniacal smell, somehow not alien even though it was unfamiliar. There\nwere noises outside in the night. Grunting sounds. Snortings. There were\nsuch sounds as a vast concourse of grazing creatures would make in the\nnight-time, when gathered by thousands and myriads for safety and for\nrest.\n\n\"He--went out,\" said Alicia desperately. \"He meant to punish us. He's a\nspoiled little boy. We weren't nice to him. And--he was afraid of us\ntoo! So he ran away to make us sorry!\"\n\nCochrane went to look out of the lock and to call Johnny Simms back. He\ngazed into absolute blackness on the ground. He felt a queasy giddiness\nbecause there was no hand-railing at the outer lock door and he knew the\ndepth of the fall outside. He raged, within himself. Johnny Simms would\nfeel triumphant when he was called. He would require to be pleaded with\nto return. He would pompously set terms for returning before he was\nkilled....\n\nCochrane saw a flash of fire and the short streak of a tracer-bullet's\npatch before it hit something. He heard the report of the gun. He heard\na bellow of agony and then a scream of purest terror from Johnny Simms.\n\nThen, from the ground, arose a truly monstrous tumult. Every one of the\ncreatures below raised its voice in a horrible, bleating cry. The volume\nof sound was numbing--was agonizing in sheer impact. There were\nstirrings and clickings as of horns clashing against each other.\n\nAnother scream from Johnny Simms. He had moved. It appeared that he was\nrunning. Cochrane saw more gun-flashes, there were more shots. He\nclenched his hands and waited for the thunderous vibration that would be\nall this multitude of animals pounding through the night in blind\nstampede.\n\nIt did not come. There was only that bleating, horrible outcry as all\nthe beasts bellowed of alarm and created this noise to frighten their\nassailants away.\n\nTwice more there were shots in the night. Johnny Simms fired crazily and\nscreamed in hysterical panic. Each time the shots and screaming were\nfarther away.\n\nThere were no portable lights with which to make a search. It was\nunthinkable to go blundering among the beasts in darkness.\n\nThere was nothing to do. Cochrane could only watch and listen helplessly\nwhile the strong beast-smell rose to his nostrils, and the innumerable\nnoises of unseen uneasy creatures sounded in his ears.\n\nInside the ship Alicia wept hopelessly. Babs tried in vain to comfort\nher.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n\nThe sun rose. Cochrane noted the time, it was fourteen hours since\nsunset. The local day would be something more than an Earth-day in\nlength. The manner of sunrise was familiar. There was a pale gray light\nin the sky. It strengthened. Then reddish colors appeared, and changed\nto gold, and the unnamed stars winked out one after another. Presently\nthe nearer hillsides ceased to be black. There was light everywhere.\n\nAlicia, white and haggard, waited to see what the light would show.\n\nBut there was heavy mist everywhere. The hill-crests were clear, and the\nedge of the visible woodland, and the top half of the ship's shining\nhull rose clear of curiously-tinted, slowly writhing fog. But everything\nelse seemed submerged in a sea of milk.\n\nBut the mist grew thinner as the sun shone on it. Its top writhed to\nnothingness. All this was wholly commonplace. Even clouds in the sky\nwere of types well-known enough. Which was, when one thought about it,\ninevitable. This was a Sol-type sun, of the same kind and color as the\nstar which warmed the planet Earth. It had planets, like the sun of\nmen's home world. There was a law--Bode's Law--which specified that\nplanets must float in orbits bearing such-and-such relationships to each\nother. There must also be a law that planets in those orbits must bear\nsuch-and-such relationships of size to each other. There must be a law\nthat winds must blow under ordinary conditions, and clouds form at\nappointed heights and times. It would be very remarkable if Earth were\nan exception to natural laws that other worlds obey.\n\nSo the strangeness of the morning to those who watched from the ship was\nmore like the strangeness of an alien land on Earth than that of a\nwholly alien planet.\n\nThe lower dawnmist thinned. Gazing down, Cochrane saw dark masses\nmoving slowly past the ship's three metal landing-fins. They were the\nbeasts of the night, moving deliberately from their bed-ground to the\nvast plains inland. There were bunches of hundreds, and bunches of\nscores. There were occasional knots of dozens only.\n\nFrom overhead and through the mist Cochrane could not see individual\nanimals too clearly, but they were heavy beasts and clumsy ones. They\nmoved sluggishly. Their numbers dwindled. He saw groups of no more than\nfour or five. He saw single animals trudging patiently away.\n\nHe saw no more at all.\n\nThen the sunlight touched the inland hills. The last of the morning mist\ndissolved, and there were the dead bodies of two beasts near the base of\nthe ship. Johnny Simms had killed them with his first panicky shots of\nthe night. There was another dead beast a quarter-mile away.\n\nCochrane gave orders. Jones and Al could not leave the ship. They were\nneeded to get it back to Earth, with full knowledge of how to make other\nstarships. Cochrane tried to leave Babs behind, but she would not stay.\nBell had loaded himself with a camera and film-tape besides a weapon,\nbefore Cochrane even began his organization. Holden was needed for an\nextra gun. Alicia, tearless and despairing, would not be left behind.\nCochrane turned wryly to Jamison.\n\n\"I don't think Johnny was killed,\" he said. \"He'd gotten a long way off\nbefore it happened, anyhow. We've got to hunt for him. With beasts like\nthose of last night, there'll naturally be other creatures to prey on\nthem. We might run into anything. If we don't get back, you get to the\nlawyers I've had representing Spaceways. They'll get rich off the job,\nbut you'll end up rich, too.\"\n\n\"The best bet all around,\" said Jamison in a low tone, \"would be to find\nhim trampled to death.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Cochrane sourly. \"But apparently the beasts don't\nstampede. Maybe they don't even charge, but just form rings to protect\ntheir females and young, like musk-oxen. I'm afraid he's alive, but I'm\nalso afraid we'll never find him.\"\n\nHe marshaled his group. Jones had walkie-talkies ready, deftly removed\nfor the purpose from space-suits nobody had used since leaving Lunar\nCity--and Holden took one to keep in touch by. They went down in the\nsling, two at a time.\n\nCochrane regarded the two dead animals near the base of the ship. They\nwere roughly the size of cattle, and they were shaggy like buffalo. They\nhad branching, pointed, deadly horns. They had hoofs, single hoofs, not\ncloven. They were not like any Earth animal. But horns and hoofs will\nappear in any system of parallel evolution. It would seem even more\ncertain that proteins and amino acids and such compounds as hemoglobin\nand fat and muscle-tissue should be identical as a matter of chemical\ninevitability. These creatures had teeth and they were herbivorous. Bell\nphotographed them painstakingly.\n\n\"Somehow,\" said Cochrane, \"I think they'd be wholesome food. If we can,\nwe'll empty a freezing-locker and take a carcass for tests.\"\n\nHolden fingered his rifle unhappily. Alicia said nothing. Babs stayed\nclose beside her. They went on.\n\nThey came to another dead animal a quarter-mile away. The ground was\nfull of the scent and the hoofmarks of the departed herd. Bell\nphotographed again. They did not stop. Johnny Simms had been this way,\nbecause of the carcass. He wasn't here now.\n\nThey topped the next rise in the ground. They saw two other slaughtered\ncreatures. It was wholly evident, now, that these animals did not charge\nbut only stood their ground when alarmed. Johnny Simms had fired blindly\nwhen he blundered into their groupings.\n\nThe last carcass they saw was barely two hundred yards from the one\npatch of woodland visible from the ship. Cochrane said with some\ngrimness.\n\n\"If his eyes had gotten used to the darkness, he might have seen the\nforest and tried to get into it to get away from those animals.\"\n\nAnd if Johnny Simms had not stopped short instantly he reached the woods\nand presumable safety, he would be utterly lost by now. There could be\nnothing less hopeful than the situation of a man lost on a strange\nplanet, not knowing in what direction he had blundered on his first\nstarting out. Even nearby, three directions out of four would be wrong.\nFarther away, the chance of stumbling on the way back to the ship would\nbe nonexistent.\n\nAlicia saw a human footprint on the trodden muck near the last carcass.\nIt pointed toward the wood.\n\nThey reached the wood, and search looked hopeless. Then by purest chance\nthey found a place where Johnny had stumbled and fallen headlong. He'd\nleaped up and fled crazily. For some fifteen yards they could track him\nby the trampled dried small growths he'd knocked down in his flight.\nThen there were no more such growths. All signs of his flight were lost.\nBut they went on.\n\nThere were strangenesses everywhere, of which they could realize only a\nsmall part because they had been city-dwellers back on Earth. There was\none place where trees grew like banyans, and it was utterly impossible\nto penetrate them. They swerved aside. There was another spot where\ngiant trees like sequoias made a cathedral-like atmosphere, and it\nseemed an impiety to speak. But Holden reported tonelessly in the\nwalkie-talkie, and assured Jones and Al and Jamison that all so far was\nwell.\n\nThey heard a vast commotion of chattering voices, and they hoped that it\nmight be a disturbance of Johnny Simms' causing. But when they reached\nthe place there was dead silence. Only, there were hundreds of tiny\nnests everywhere. They could not catch a glimpse of a single one of the\nnests' inhabitants, but they felt that they were peeked at from under\nleaves and around branches.\n\nCochrane looked unhappy indeed. In cold blood, he knew that Johnny Simms\nhad left the ship in exactly the sort of resentful bravado with which a\nspoiled little boy will run away from home to punish his parents. Quite\npossibly he had intended only to go out into the night and wait near the\nship until he was missed. But he'd found himself among the unknown\nbeasts. He'd gone into blind panic. Now he was lost indeed.\n\nBut one could not refuse to search for him simply because it was\nhopeless. Cochrane could not imagine doing any less than continuing to\nsearch as long as Alicia had hope. She might hope on indefinitely.\n\nThey heard the faint, distant, incisive sound of a shot.\n\nHolden's voice reported it in the walkie-talkie. Cochrane nodded\nbrightly to Alicia and fired a shot in turn. He was relieved. It looked\nlike everything would end in a commonplace fashion. The party from the\nship headed toward the source of the other sound.\n\nIn half an hour Cochrane was about to fire again. But they heard the\nhysterical rat-tat-tat of firing. It seemed no nearer, but it could only\nbe Johnny Simms.\n\nCochrane and Holden fired together for assurance to Johnny. Bell took\npictures.\n\nAgain they marched toward where the shots had been fired. Again they\ntrudged on for a long time. Seemingly, Johnny had moved away from them\nas they followed him. They breasted a hill, and there was a breeze with\nthe smell of water in it, and they saw that here the land sloped very\ngradually toward the sea, and the sea was in view. It was infinitely\nblue and it reached toward the most alluring of horizons. Between them\nand the sea there was only low-growing stuff, brownish and sparse. There\nwas sand underfoot--a curious bluish sand. Only here and there did the\ndry-seeming vegetation grow higher than their heads.\n\nMore shots. Between them and the sea. Cochrane and Holden fired again.\n\n\"What the devil's the matter with the fool?\" demanded Holden irritably.\n\"He knows we're coming! Why doesn't he stand still or come to meet us?\"\n\nCochrane shrugged. That thought was disturbing him too. They pressed\nforward, and suddenly Holden exclaimed. \"That looks like a man! Two\nmen!\"\n\nCochrane caught the barest glimpse of something running about, far\nahead. It looked like naked human flesh. It was the size of a man. It\nvanished. Another popped into view and darted madly out of sight. They\ndid not see the newcomers.\n\n\"He shot something like that, back where we first landed,\" said Cochrane\ngrimly. \"We'd better hurry!\"\n\nThey did hurry. There was a last flurry of shooting. It was automatic\nfire. It is not wise to shoot on automatic if one's ammunition is\nlimited, Johnny Simms' firearm chattered furiously for part of a second.\nIt stopped short. He couldn't have fired so short a burst. He was out of\nbullets.\n\nThey ran.\n\nWhen they drew near him, a hooting set up. Things scattered away. Large\nthings. Birds the size of men. They heard Johnny Simms screaming.\n\nThey came panting to the very beach, on which foam-tipped waves broke in\nabsolutely normal grandeur. The sand was commonplace save for a slight\nbluish tint. Johnny Simms was out on the beach, in the open. He was\ndown. He had flung his gun at something and was weaponless. He lay on\nthe sand, shrieking. There were four ungainly, monstrous birds like\noversized Cornish Game gamecocks pecking at him. Two ran crazily away at\nsight of the humans. Two others remained. Then they fled. One of them\nhalted, darted back, and took a last peck at Johnny Simms before it fled\nagain.\n\nHolden fired, and missed. Cochrane ran toward the kicking, shrieking\nJohnny Simms. But Alicia got there first.\n\nHe was a completely pitiable object. His clothing had been almost\ncompletely stripped away in the brief time since his last burst of\nshots. There were wounds on his bare flesh. After all, the beak of a\nbird as tall as a man is not a weapon to be despised. Johnny Simms would\nhave been pecked to death but for the party from the ship. He had been\nspotted and harried by a huntingpack of the ostrich-sized creatures at\nearliest dawn. A cooler-headed man would have stood still and killed\nsome of them, then the rest would either have run away or devoured their\nslaughtered fellows. But Johnny Simms was not cool-headed. He had made a\ncareer of being a rich man's spoiled little boy. Now he'd had a fright\ngreat enough and an escape narrow enough to shatter the nerves of a\nnormal man. To Johnny Simms, the effect was catastrophic.\n\nHe could not walk, and the distance was too great to carry him. Holden\nreported by walkie-talkie, and Jones proposed to butcher one of the\nanimals Johnny had killed and put it in a freezer emptied for the\npurpose, and then lift the ship and land by the sea. It seemed a\nreasonable proposal. Johnny was surely not seriously wounded.\n\nBut that meant time to wait. Alicia sat by her husband, soothing him.\nHolden moved along the beach, examining the shells that had come ashore.\nHe picked up one shell more glorious in its coloring than any of the\npearl-making creatures of Earth. This shell grew neither in the flat\nspiral nor the cone-shaped form of Earth mollusks. It grew in a\ndoubly-curved spiral, so that the result was an extraordinary, lustrous,\ncomplex sphere. Bell fairly danced with excitement as he photographed it\nwith lavish pains to get all the colors just right.\n\nCochrane and Babs moved along the beach also. It was not possible to be\napprehensive. Cochrane talked largely. Presently he was saying with\ninfinite satisfaction:\n\n\"The chemical compounds here are bound to be the same! It's a new world,\nbigger than the glacier planet. Those beasts last night--if they're good\nfood-stuff--will make this a place like the old west, and everybody\nenvies the pioneers! This is a new Earth! Everything's so nearly the\nsame--.\"\n\n\"I never,\" observed Babs, \"heard of blue sand on Earth.\"\n\nHe frowned at her. He stooped and picked up a handful of the beach\nstuff. It was not blue. The tiny, sea-broken pebbles were ordinary\nquartz and granite rock. They would have to be. Yet there was a\nblueness--The blue grains were very much smaller than the white and tan\nand gray ones. Cochrane looked closely. Then he blew. All the sand blew\nout of his hand except--at last--one tiny grain. It was white. It\nglittered greasily. Cochrane moved four paces and wetted his hand in the\nsea. He tried to wet the sand-grain. It would not wet.\n\nHe began to laugh.\n\n\"I did a show once,\" he told Babs, \"about the old diamond-mines. Ever\nhear of them? They used to find diamonds in blue clay which was as hard\nas rock. Here, blue clay goes out from the land to under the waves. This\nis a tiny diamond, washed out by the sea! This is the last thing we\nneed!\" Then he looked at his watch. \"We're due on the air in two hours\nand a half! Now we've got what we want! Let's go have Holden tell Jones\nto hurry!\"\n\nBut Babs complained suddenly,\n\n\"Jed! What sort of life am I going to lead with you? Here we are,\nand--nobody can see us--and you don't even notice!\"\n\nCochrane was penitent. In fact, they had to hurry back down the beach to\njoin the others when the space-ship appeared as a silvery gleam, high in\nthe air, and then came swooping down with fierce flames underneath it to\nsettle a quarter-mile inland.\n\nBell had a picture of the tiny diamond by the time the ground was cool\nenough for them to re-enter the ship. The way he photographed it,\nagainst a background which had nothing by which its size could be\nestimated, the little white stone looked like a Kohinoor. It was two\ntransparent pyramids set base to base, and he even got color-flashes\nfrom it. And Jamison, forewarned, took pictures from the air of the\nblue-sand areas. They showed the tint the one tiny diamond explained.\n\nThe broadcast was highly successful. It began with a four-minute\ncommercial in which the evils of faulty elimination were discussed with\ninfinite delicacy, and it was clearly proved--to an audience waiting to\nlook beyond the stars--that only Greshham's Intestinal Emollient allowed\nthe body to make full use of vitamins, proteins, and the very newest\nenzymatic foundation-substances which everybody needed for really\nperfect health. There followed the approach shots to this planet, shots\nof the great beast-herds on the plains, views of luxuriant, waving\nfoliage, the tide of shaggy animals as they came at dusk to their\ndrinking-place, and there was an all-too-brief picturing of the\nblue-tinted soil which the last film-clip of all declared to be\ndiamondiferous.\n\nCochrane's direction of this show was almost inspired. The views of the\nanimal herd were calculated to make any member of his audience think in\nsimultaneous terms of glamour and adventure--with perfect personal\nsafety, of course!--and of steaks, chops and roasts. The more gifted\nviewers back on Earth might even envision filets mignon. The\ninfinitesimal diamond with its prismatic glitterings, of course, roused\ncupidity of another sort.\n\nThere were four commercials cut into these alluring views, the last was\nsuperimposed upon a view Bell had taken of the sunset-colors. And it\nmight have seemed that the television audience would confuse the charm\nof the new world as pictured with the product insistently praised. But\nthe public was pretty well toughened up against commercials nowadays. It\nwas not deceived. As usual, it only deceived itself.\n\nBut there was no deception about the fact that there was a new and\nunoccupied planet fit for human habitation. That was true. And the\nfretting overcrowded cities immediately became places where everybody\nmade happy plans for his neighbor to move there. But the more irritable\npeople would begin to think vaguely that it might be worth going to, for\nthemselves.\n\nThe ship took off two hours after the broadcast. Part of that time was\ntaken up with astrogational conferences with astronomers on Earth.\nCochrane had this conference taped for the auxiliary broadcast-program\nin which the audience shared the problems as well as the triumphs of the\nstar-voyagers. Cochrane wanted to get back to Earth. So far as\ntelevision was concerned, it would be unwise. The ship and its crew\nwould travel indefinitely without a lack of sponsors. But for once,\nCochrane agreed entirely with Holden.\n\n\"We're heading back,\" he told Babs, \"because if we keep on, people will\naccept our shows as just another superior kind of escape-entertainment.\nThey'll have the dream quality of 'You Win a Million' and the\nlottery-shows. They'll be things to dream about but never to think of\ndoing anything about. We're going to make the series disappointingly\nshort, in order to make it more convincingly factual. We won't spin it\nout for its entertainment-value until it practically loses everything\nelse.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Babs. She put her hand in his. She'd found it necessary to\nremind him, now and then.\n\nSo the ship started home. And it would not return direct to Earth--or\nLunar City--for a very definite reason. Cochrane meant to have all his\nbusiness affairs neatly wrapped up before landing. They could get\nanother show or two across, and some highly involved contracts could be\nhaggled to completion more smoothly if one of the parties--Spaceways,\nInc.--was not available except when it felt like being available. The\nother parties would be more anxious.\n\nSo the astrogation-conference did not deal with a direct return to\nEarth, but with a small sol-type star not too far out of the direct\nline. The Pole Star could have been visited, but it was a double star.\nCochrane had no abstract scientific curiosity. His approach was strictly\nthat of a man of business. He did the business.\n\nThere was, of course, a suitable pause not too far from the second\nplanet--the planet of the shaggy beasts. They put out a plastic balloon\nwith a Dabney field generator inside it. It would float in emptiness\nindefinitely. The field would hold for not less than twenty years. It\nwould serve as a beacon, a highway, a railroad track through space for\nother ships planning to visit the third world now available to men.\nUltimately, better arrangements could be made.\n\nJones was already ecstatically designing ground-level Dabney field\ninstallations. There would be Dabney fields extending from star to star.\nAlong them, as along pneumatic tubes, ships would travel at unthinkable\nspeeds toward absolutely certain destinations. True, at times they could\nnot be used because of the bulk of planets between starting-points and\nlanding-stations. But with due attention to scheduling, it would be a\nsimple matter indeed to arrange for something close to commuters'\nservice between star-clusters. He explained all this to Cochrane, with\nHolden listening in.\n\n\"Oh, surely!\" said Cochrane cynically. \"And you'll have tax-payers\nobjecting because you make money. You'll be regulated out of existence.\nWere you thinking that Spaceways would run this transportation system\nyou're planning, without cutting anybody else in on even the glory of\nit?\"\n\nJones looked at him, dead-pan. But he was annoyed.\n\n\"I want some money,\" he said. \"I thought we could get this thing set up,\nand then I could get myself a ship and facilities for doing some really\noriginal work. I'd like to work something out and not have to sell the\npublicity-rights to it!\"\n\n\"I'll arrange it,\" promised Cochrane. \"I've got our lawyers setting up a\ndeal right now. You're going to get as many tricky patents as you can on\nthis field, and assign them all to Spaceways. And Spaceways is going to\nassign them all to a magnificent Space Development Association, a sort\nof Chamber of Commerce for all the outer planets, and all the stuffed\nshirts in creation are going to leap madly to get honorary posts on it.\nAnd it will be practically beyond criticism, and it will have the public\ninterest passionately at its heart, and it will be practically beyond\ninterference and it will be as inefficient as hell! And the more\ninefficient it is, the more it will have to take in to allow for its\ninefficiency--and for your patents it has to give us a flat cut of its\ngross! And meanwhile we'll get ours from the planets we've landed on and\npublicized. We've got customers. We've built up a market for our\nplanets!\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Jones in frank astonishment.\n\n\"We,\" said Cochrane, \"rate as first inhabitants and therefore\nproprietors and governments of the first two planets ever landed on\nbeyond Earth. When the Moon-colony was formed, there were elaborate laws\nmade to take care of surviving nation prides and so on. Whoever first\nstays on a planet a full rotation is its proprietor and\ngovernment--until other inhabitants arrive. Then the government is all\nof them, but the proprietorship remains with the first. We own two\nplanets. Nice planets. Glamorized planets, too! So I've already made\ndeals for the hotel-concessions on the glacier world.\"\n\nHolden had listened with increasing uneasiness. Now he said doggedly:\n\n\"That's not right, Jed! I don't mind making money, but there are things\nthat are more important! Millions of people back home--hundreds of\nmillions of poor devils--spend their lives scared to death of losing\ntheir jobs, not daring to hope for more than bare subsistence! I want to\ndo something for them! People need hope, Jed, simply to be healthy!\nMaybe I'm a fool, but the human race needs hope more than I need money!\"\n\nCochrane looked patient.\n\n\"What would you suggest?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Holden heavily, \"that we ought to give what we've got to\nthe world. Let the governments of the world take over and assist\nemigration. There's not one but will be glad to do it ...\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Cochrane, \"you are perfectly right. They would!\nThere have been resettlement projects and such stuff for generations.\nI'm very much afraid that just what you propose will be done to some\ndegree somewhere or other on other planets as they're turned up. But on\nthe glacier planet there will be hotels. The rich will want to go there\nto stay, to sight-see, to ride, to hunt, to ski, and to fly in\nhelicopters over volcanoes. The hotels will need to be staffed. There\nwill be guides and foresters and hunters. It will cost too much to bring\nfood from Earth, so farms will be started. It will be cheaper to buy\nfood from independent farmers than to raise it with hired help. So the\nfarmers will be independent. There will have to be stores to supply them\nwith what they need, and tourists with what they don't need but want.\nFrom the minute the glacier planet starts up as a tourist resort, there\nwill be jobs for hundreds of people. It won't be long before there are\njobs for thousands. There'll be a man-shortage there. Anybody who wants\nto can go there to work, and if he doesn't go there expecting a\ncertified, psychologically conditioned environment, but just a good job\nwith possible or probable advancement ... That's the environment we\nhumans want! Presently the hotels won't even be tourist hotels. They'll\njust be the normal hotels that exist everywhere that there are cities\nand people moving about among them! Then it won't be a tourist-planet,\nand tourists will be a nuisance. It'll be home for one hell of a lot of\npeople! And they'll have made every bit of it themselves!\"\n\nHolden said uncomfortably:\n\n\"It'll be slow ...\"\n\n\"It'll be sure!\" snapped Cochrane. \"The first settlements in America\nwere failures until the people started to work for themselves! Look at\nthis planet we're leaving! How many people will come to work that silly\ndiamond mine! How many will hunt to supply them with meat? How many will\nfarm to supply the hunters and the miners with other food? And how many\nothers will be along to run stores and manufacture things ...\" He made\nan impatient gesture. \"You're thinking of encouraging people to move to\nthe stars to make more room on Earth. You'd get nice passive colonists\nwho'd obediently move because the long-hairs said it was wise and the\ngovernment paid for it. I'm thinking of colonists who'll fight and quite\npossibly cheat and lie a little to get jobs where they can take care of\ntheir families the way they want to! I want people to move to get what\nthey want in spite of any discouragement anybody throws at them. Now\nshoo! I'm busy!\"\n\nJones asked mildly:\n\n\"At what?\"\n\n\"The latest proposed deal,\" said Cochrane impatiently, \"is for rights to\nbore for oil. The uranium concessions are farmed out. Water-power is\npending--not for cash, but a cut--and--.\"\n\nHolden said uneasily:\n\n\"There's one other thing, Jed. All your plans and all your scheming\ncould still be blocked if back on Earth they think we might bring\nplagues back to Earth. Remember Dabney suggested that? And some\nbiologist or other agreed with him?\"\n\nCochrane grinned.\n\n\"There's a diamond-mine. There are herds of what people will call\ncattle. There's food and riches. There's scenery and adventure. There's\nroom to do things! Nobody could keep political office if he tried to\nkeep his constituents from food and cash and adventure--even by proxy\nwhen they send expendable Cousin Albert out to see if he can make a\nliving there. We've got to take reasonable precautions against germs, of\ncourse. We'll have trouble enforcing them. But we'll manage!\"\n\nAl called down from the control-room. The ship was sufficiently aligned,\nhe thought, for their next stopping-place. He wanted Jones to charge the\nbooster-circuit and flash it over. Jones went.\n\nA little later there was the peculiar sensation of a sound that was not\na sound, but was felt all through one. The result was not satisfactory.\nThe ship was still in empty space, and the nearest star was still a\nstar. There was a repetition of the booster-jump. Still not too good.\nThereafter the ship drove, and jumped, and jumped, and drove.\n\nJamison came down to where Cochrane conducted business via communicator.\nHe waited. Cochrane said:\n\n\"Dammit, I won't agree! I want twelve per cent or I take up another\noffer!--What?\"\n\nThe last was to Jamison. Jamison said uneasily:\n\n\"We found another planet. About Earth-size. Ice-caps. Clouds. Oceans.\nSeas. Even rivers! But there's no green on it! It's all bare rocks!\"\n\nCochrane thought concentratedly. Then he said impatiently:\n\n\"The whiskered people back home said that life couldn't have gotten\nstarted on all the planets suited for it. They said there must be\nplanets where life hasn't reached, though they're perfectly suited for\nit. Make a landing and try the air with algae like we did on the first\nplanet.\"\n\nHe turned back to the communicator.\n\n\"You reason,\" he snapped to a man on far-away Earth, \"that all this is\nonly on paper. But that's the only reason you're getting a chance at it!\nI'll guarantee that Jones will install drives on ships that meet our\nrequirements of space-worthiness--or government standards, whichever are\nstrictest--for ten per cent of your company stock plus twelve per cent\ncash of the cost of each ship. Nothing less!\"\n\nHe heard the rockets make the louder sound that was the symptom of\ndescent against gravity.\n\nThe world was lifeless. The ship had landed on bare stone, when Cochrane\nlooked out the control-room ports. There had been trouble finding a flat\nspace on which the three landing-fins would find a suitable foundation.\nIt had taken half an hour of maneuvering to locate such a place and to\nsettle solidly on it. Then the look of things was appalling.\n\nThe landing-spot was a naked mass of what seemed to be basalt polygons,\nsimilar to the Giants' Causeway of Ireland back on Earth. There was no\nsoftness anywhere. The stone which on other planets underlay soil, here\nshowed harshly. There was no soil. There was no microscopic life to\nnibble at rocks and make soil in which less minute life could live. The\nnudity of the stones led to glaring colors everywhere. The colors were\nbrilliant as nowhere else but on Earth's moon. There was no vegetation\nat all.\n\nThat was somehow shocking. The ship's company stared and stared, but\nthere could be no comment. There was a vast, dark sea to the left of the\nlanding-place. Inland there were mountains and valleys. But the\nmountains were not sloped. There were heaps of detritus at the bases of\ntheir cliffs, but it was simply detritus. No tiniest patch of lichen\ngrew anywhere. No blade of grass. No moss. No leaf. Nothing.\n\nThe air was empty. Nothing flew. There were clouds, to be sure. The sky\nwas even blue, though a darker blue than Earth's, because there was no\nvegetation to break stone down to dust, or to form dust by its own\ndecay.\n\nThe sea was violently active. Great waves flung themselves toward the\nharsh coastline and beat upon it with insensate violence. They shattered\ninto masses of foam. But the foam broke--too quickly--and left the\nsurging water dark again. Far down the line of foam there were dark\nclouds, and rain fell in masses, and lightning flashed. But it was a\nscene of desolation which was somehow more horrible even than the\nscarred and battered moon of Earth.\n\nCochrane looked out very carefully. Alicia came to him, a trifle\nhesitant.\n\n\"Johnny's asleep now. He didn't sleep at first, and while we were out of\ngravity he was unhappy. But he went off to sleep the instant we landed.\nHe needs rest. Could we--just stay landed here until he catches up on\nsleep?\"\n\nCochrane nodded. Alicia smiled at him and went away. There was still the\nmark of a bruise on her cheek. She went down to where her husband needed\nher. Holden said dourly:\n\n\"This world's useless. So is her husband.\"\n\n\"Wait till we check the air,\" said Cochrane absently.\n\n\"I've checked it,\" Holden told him indifferently. \"I went in the port\nand sniffed at the cracked outer door. I didn't die, so I opened the\ndoor. There is a smell of stone. That's all. The air's perfectly\nbreathable. The ocean's probably absorbed all soluble gases, and\npoisonous gases are soluble. If they weren't, they couldn't be\npoisonous.\"\n\n\"Mmmmmm,\" said Cochrane thoughtfully.\n\nJamison came over to him.\n\n\"We're not going to stay here, are we?\" he asked. \"I don't like to look\nat it. The moon's bad enough, but at least nothing could live there!\nAnything could live here. But it doesn't! I don't like it!\"\n\n\"We'll stay here at least while Johnny has a nap. I do want Bell to take\nall the pictures he can, though. Probably not for broadcast, but for\nbusiness reasons. I'll need pictures to back up a deal.\"\n\nJamison went away. Holden said without interest:\n\n\"You'll make no deals with this planet! This is one you can do what you\nlike with! I don't want any part of it!\"\n\nCochrane shrugged.\n\n\"Speaking of things you don't want any part of--what about Johnny Simms?\nSpeaking as a psychiatrist, what effect will that business of being in\nthe dark all night and nearly being pecked to death--what will it do to\nhim? Are psychopaths the way they are because they can't face reality,\nor because they've never had to?\"\n\nHolden stared away down the incredible, lifeless coastline at the\ndistant storm. There was darkness under many layers of cloud. The sea\nfoamed and lashed and instantly was free of foam again. Because there\nwere no plankton, no animalcules, no tiny, gluey, organic beings in it\nto give the water the property of making foam which endured. There was\nthunder, yonder in the storm, and no ear heard it. Over a vast world\nthere was sunshine which no eyes saw. There was night in which nothing\nrested, and somewhere dawn was breaking now, and nothing sang.\n\n\"Look at that, Jed,\" said Holden heavily. \"There's a reality none of us\nwants to face! We're all more or less fugitives from what we are afraid\nis reality. That is real, and it makes me feel small and futile. So I\ndon't like to look at it. Johnny Simms didn't want to face what one does\ngrow up to face. It made him feel futile. So he picked a pleasanter role\nthan realist.\"\n\nCochrane nodded.\n\n\"But his unrealism of last night put him into a very realistic mess that\nhe couldn't dodge! Will it change him?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Holden without any expression at all in his voice.\n\"They used to put lunatics in snake-pits. When they were people who'd\ntaken to lunacy for escape from reality, it made them go back to reality\nto escape from the snakes. Shock-treatments used to be used, later, for\nthe same effect. We're too soft to use either treatment now. But Johnny\ngave himself the works. The odds are that from now on he will never want\nto be alone even for an instant, and he will never again quite dare to\nbe angry with anybody or make anybody angry. You choked him and he ran\naway, and it was bad! So from now on I'd guess that Johnny will be a\nvery well-behaved little boy in a grown man's body.\" He said very wryly\nindeed, \"Alicia will be very happy, taking care of him.\"\n\nA moment later he added:\n\n\"I look at that set-up the way I look at the landscape yonder.\"\n\nCochrane said nothing. Holden liked Alicia. Too much. It would not make\nany difference at all. After a moment, though, he changed the subject.\n\n\"I think this is a pretty good bet, this planet. You think it's no good.\nI'm going to talk to the chlorella companies. They grow edible yeast in\ntanks, and chlorella in vats, and they produce an important amount of\nfood. But they have to grow the stuff indoors and they have a ghastly\njob keeping everything sterile. Here's a place where they can sow\nchlorella in the oceans! They can grow yeast in lakes, out-of-doors!\nSuppose they use this world to grow monstrous quantities of unattractive\nbut useful foodstuff--in a way--wild? It will be good return-cargo\nmaterial for ships taking colonists out to our other planets.--I\nsuppose,\" he added meditatively, \"they'll ship it back in bulk, dried.\"\n\nHolden blinked. He was jolted out of even his depression.\n\n\"Jed!\" he said warmly. \"Tell that to the world--prove that--and--people\nwill stop being afraid! They won't be afraid of starving before they can\nget to the stars! Jed--Jed! This is the thing the world needs most of\nall!\"\n\nBut Cochrane grimaced.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he admitted it. \"But I've tasted the stuff. I think it's foul!\nStill, if people want it ...\"\n\nHe went back down to the communicator to contact the chlorella companies\nof Earth, to find out if there was any special data they would need to\npass on the proposal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd so presently the ship took off for home. It landed on the moon\nfirst, and Johnny Simms was loaded into a space-suit and transferred to\nLunar City, where he could live without being extradited back to Earth.\nHe wouldn't stay there. Alicia guaranteed that. They'd move to the\nglacier planet as soon as hotels were built. Maybe some day they'd\ntravel to the planet of the shaggy beasts. Johnny would never be\ntroublesome again. He was pathetically anxious, now, to have people like\nhim, and stay with him, and not under any circumstances be angry with\nhim or shut him away from them. Alicia would now have a full-time\noccupation keeping people from taking advantage of him.\n\nBut the ship went back to Earth. And on Earth Jamison became the leading\ntelevision personality of all time, describing and extrapolating the\ndelicious dangers and the splendid industrial opportunities of\nstar-travel. Bell was his companion and co-star. Presently Jamison\nconceded privately to Cochrane that he and Bell would need shortly to\ntake off on another journey of exploration with some other expedition.\nNeither of them thought to retire, though they were well-off enough.\nThey were stock-holders in the Spaceways company, which guaranteed them\na living.\n\nCochrane put Spaceways, Inc., into full operation. He fought savagely\nagainst personal publicity, but he worked himself half to death. He\nspent hours every day in frenzied haggling, and in the cynical\nexamination of deftly booby-trapped business proposals. His lawyers\ninsisted that he needed an office--he did--and presently he had four\nsecretaries and there developed an entire hierarchy of persons under\nhim. One day his chief secretary told him commiseratingly that somebody\nhad waited two hours past appointment-time to see him.\n\nIt was Hopkins, who had not been willing to interrupt his dinner to\nlisten to a protest from Cochrane. Hopkins was still exactly as\nimportant as ever. It was only that Cochrane was more so.\n\nIt woke Cochrane up. He stormed, to Babs, and ruthlessly cancelled\nappointments and abandoned or transferred enterprises, and made\npreparations for a more satisfactory way of life.\n\nThey went, in time, to the Spaceways terminal, to take ship for the\nstars. The terminal was improvised, but it was busy. Already eighteen\nships a day went away from there in Dabney fields. Eighteen others\narrived. Jones was already off somewhere in a ship built according to\nhis own notions. Officially he was doing research for Spaceways, Inc.,\nbut actually nobody told him what to do. He puttered happily with\nimprobable contrivances and sometimes got even more improbable results.\nHolden was already off of Earth. He was on the planet of the shaggy\nbeasts, acting as consultant on the cases of persons who arrived there\nand became emotionally disturbed because they could do as they pleased,\ninstead of being forced by economic necessity to do otherwise.\n\nBut this day Babs and Cochrane went together into the grand concourse of\nthe Spaceways terminal. There were people everywhere. The hiring-booths\nof enterprises on the three planets now under development took\napplications for jobs on those remote worlds, and explained how long one\nhad to contract to work in order to have one's fare paid. Chambers of\nCommerce representatives were prepared to give technical information to\nprospective entrepreneurs. There were reservation-desks, and\nfreight-routing desks, and tourist-agency desks ...\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Cochrane suddenly. \"D'you know, I haven't heard of Dabney\nin months! What happened to him?\"\n\n\"Dabney?\" said Babs. She beamed. Women in the terminal saw the clothes\nshe was wearing. They did not recognize her--Cochrane had kept her off\nthe air--but they envied her. She felt very nice indeed. \"Dabney?--Oh, I\nhad to use my own judgment there, Jed. You were so busy! After all, he\nwas scientific consultant to Spaceways. He did pay Jones cold cash for\nfame-rights. When everything else got so much more important than just\nthe scientific theory, he got in a terrible state. His family consulted\nDoctor Holden, and we arranged it. He's right down this way!\"\n\nShe pointed. And there was a splendid plate-glass office built out from\nthe wall of the grand concourse. It was elevated, so that it was\ncharmingly conspicuous. There was a chastely designed but highly visible\nsign under the stairway leading to it. The sign said; \"_H. G. Dabney,\nScientific Consultant._\"\n\nDabney sat at an imposing desk in plain view of all the thousands who\nhad shipped out and the millions who would ship out in time to come. He\nthought, visibly. Presently he stood up and paced meditatively up and\ndown the office which was as eye-catching as a gold-fish bowl of equal\nsize in the same place. He seemed to see someone down in the concourse.\nHe could have recognized Cochrane, of course. But he did not.\n\nHe bowed. He was a great man. Undoubtedly he returned to his wife each\nevening happily convinced that he had done the world a great favor by\npermitting it to glimpse him.\n\nCochrane and Babs went on. Their baggage was taken care of. The\ndeparture of a ship for the stars, these days, was much less complicated\nand vastly more comfortable than it used to be when a mere moon-rocket\ntook off.\n\nWhen they were in the ship, Babs heaved a sigh of absolute relief.\n\n\"Now,\" she said zestfully, \"now you're retired, Jed! You don't have to\nworry about anything! And so now I'm going to try to make you worry\nabout me--not worry about me, but think about me!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Cochrane. He regarded her with honest affection.\n\"We'll take a good long vacation. First on the glacier planet. Then\nwe'll build a house somewhere in the hills back of Diamondville ...\"\n\n\"Jed!\" said Babs accusingly.\n\n\"There's a fair population there already,\" said Cochrane,\napologetically. \"It won't be long before a local television station will\nbe logical. I was just thinking, Babs, that after we get bored with\nloafing, I could start a program there. Really sound stuff. Not\ncommercial. And of course with the Dabney field it could be piped back\nto Earth if any sponsor wanted it. I think they would ...\"\n\nPresently the ship with Babs and Cochrane among its passengers took off\nto the stars. It was a perfectly routine flight. After all, star-travel\nwas almost six months old. It wasn't a novelty any longer.\n\nOperation Outer Space was old stuff.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nTranscriber's notes\n\nThe following typos have been corrected.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
