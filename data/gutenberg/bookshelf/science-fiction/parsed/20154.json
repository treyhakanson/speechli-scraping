He stretched himself, and yawned broadly.\n\n\"Red, how soon do we eat?\" he called.\n\n\"Shut up, you'll wake the others,\" replied a low voice from the rear of\nthe swift little patrol ship. \"See anything?\"\n\n\"Several million stars,\" replied Evans in a lower voice. \"And--\" His\ntone became suddenly severe. \"Assistant Murphy, remember your manners\nwhen addressing your superior officer. I've a mind to report you.\"\n\nA flaming head of hair topping a grinning face poked around the edge of\nthe door. \"Lower your wavelength, lower your wavelength! You may think\nyou're a sun, but you're just a planetoid. But what I'd like to know,\nChief Pilot Russ Evans, is why they locate a ship in a forlorn, out of\nthe way place like this--three-quarters of a billion miles, out of\nplanetary plane. No ships ever come out here, no pirates, not a chance\nto help a wrecked ship. All we can do is sit here and watch the other\nfellows do the work.\"\n\n\"Which is exactly why we're here. Watch--and tell the other ships where\nto go, and when. Is that chow ready?\" asked Russ looking at a small\nclock giving New York time.\n\n\"Uh--think she'll be on time? Come on an' eat.\"\n\nEvans took one more look at the telectroscope screen, then snapped it\noff. A tiny, molecular towing unit in his hand, he pointed toward the\ndoor to the combined galley and lunch room, and glided in the wake of\nMurphy.\n\n\"How much fuel left?\" he asked, as he glided into the dizzily spinning\nroom. A cylindrical room, spinning at high speed, causing an artificial\n\"weight\" for the foods and materials in it, made eating of food a less\ndifficult task. Expertly, he maneuvered himself to the guide rail near\nthe center of the room, and caught the spiral. Braking himself into\nmotion, he soon glided down its length, and landed on his feet. He bent\nand flexed his muscles, waiting for the now-busied assistant to get to\nthe floor and reply.\n\n\"They gave us two pounds extra. Lord only knows why. Must expect us to\nclean up on some fleet. That makes four pound rolls left, untouched, and\ntwo thirds of the original pound. We've been here fifteen days, and have\nsix more to go. The main driving power rolls have about the same amount\nleft, and three pound rolls in each reserve bin,\" replied Red, holding a\ncuriously moving coffee pot that strove to adjust itself to rapidly\nchanging air velocities as it neared the center of the room.\n\n\"Sounds like a fleet's power stock. Martian lead or the terrestrial\nisotope?\" asked Evans, tasting warily a peculiar dish before him. \"Say,\nthis is energy food. I thought we didn't get any more till Saturday.\"\nThe change from the energy-less, flavored pastes that made up the\nprincipal bulk of a space-pilot's diet, to prevent over-eating, when no\nenergy was used in walking in the weightless ship, was indeed a welcome\nchange.\n\n\"Uh-huh. I got hungry. Any objections?\" grinned the Irishman.\n\n\"None!\" replied Evans fervently, pitching in with a will.\n\nSeated at the controls once more, he snapped the little switch that\ncaused the screen to glow with flashing, swirling colors as the\ntelectroscope apparatus came to life. A thousand tiny points of flame\nappeared scattered on a black field with a suddenness that made them\nseem to snap suddenly into being. Points, tiny dimensionless points of\nlight, save one, a tiny disc of blue-white flame, old Sol from a\ndistance of close to one billion miles, and under slight reverse\nmagnification. The skillful hands at the controls were turning\nadjustments now, and that disc of flame seemed to leap toward him with a\nhundred light-speeds, growing to a disc as large as a dime in an\ninstant, while the myriad points of the stars seemed to scatter like\nfrightened chickens, fleeing from the growing sun, out of the screen.\nOther points, heretofore invisible, appeared, grew, and rushed away.\n\nThe sun shifted from the center of the screen, and a smaller\nreddish-green disc came into view--a planet, its atmosphere coloring the\nlight that left it toward the red. It rushed nearer, grew larger. Earth\nspread as it took the center of the screen. A world, a portion of a\nworld, a continent, a fragment of a continent as the magnification\nincreased, boundlessly it seemed.\n\nFinally, New York spread across the screen; New York seen from the air,\nwith a strange lack of perspective. The buildings did not seem all to\nslant toward some point, but to stand vertical, for, from a distance of\na billion miles, the vision lines were practically parallel. Titanic\nshafts of glowing color in the early summer sun appeared; the hot rays\nfrom the sun, now only 82,500,000 miles away, shimmering on the colored\nmetal walls.\n\nThe new Airlines Building, a mile and a half high, supported at various\npoints by actual spaceship driving units, was a riot of shifting,\nrainbow hues. A new trick in construction had been used here, and Evans\nsmiled at it. Arcot, inventor of the ship that carried him, had\nsuggested it to Fuller, designer of that ship, and of that building. The\ncolored berylium metal of the wall had been ruled with 20,000 lines to\nthe inch, mere scratches, but nevertheless a diffraction grating. The\nresult was amazingly beautiful. The sunlight, split up to its rainbow\ncolors, was reflected in millions of shifting tints.\n\nIn the air, supported by tiny packs strapped to their backs, thousands\nof people were moving, floating where they wished, in any direction, at\nany elevation. There were none of the helicopters of even five years\nago, now. A molecular power suit was far more convenient, cost nothing\nto operate, and but $50 to buy. Perfectly safe, requiring no skill,\neveryone owned them. To the watcher in space, they were mere moving,\nsnaky lines of barely distinguishable dots that shivered and seemed to\nwrithe in the refractions of the air. Passing over them, seeming to pass\nalmost through them in this strange perspectiveless view, were the\nshadowy forms of giant space liners, titanic streamlined hulls. They\nwere streamlined for no good reason, save that they looked faster and\nmore graceful than the more efficient spherical freighters, just as\npassenger liners of two centuries earlier, with their steam engines, had\ncarried four funnels and used two. A space liner spent so minute a\nportion of its journey in the atmosphere that it was really inefficient\nto streamline them.\n\n\"Won't be long!\" muttered Russ, grinning cheerily at the familiar,\nsunlit city. His eyes darted to the chronometer beside him. The view\nseemed to be taken from a ship that was suddenly scudding across the\nheavens like a frightened thing, as it ran across from Manhattan Island,\nfollowed the Hudson for a short way, then cut across into New Jersey,\nswinging over the great woodland area of Kittatiny Park, resting finally\non the New Jersey suburb of New York nestled in the Kittatinies,\nBlairtown. Low apartment buildings, ten or twelve stories high, nestled\nin the waving green of trees in the old roadways. When ground traffic\nceased, the streets had been torn up, and parkways substituted.\n\nQuickly the view singled out a single apartment, and the great smooth\nroof was enlarged on the screen to the absolute maximum clarity, till\nfurther magnification simply resulted in worse stratospheric distortion.\nOn the broad roof were white strips of some material, making a huge V\nfollowed by two I's. Russ watched, his hand on the control steadying the\nview under the Earth's complicated orbital motion, and rotation, further\ncorrections for the ship's orbital motion making the job one requiring\ngreat skill. The view held the center with amazing clarity. Something\nseemed to be happening to the last of the I's. It crumpled suddenly,\nrolled in on itself and disappeared.\n\n\"She's there, and on time,\" grinned Russ happily.\n\nHe tried more magnification. Could he--\n\nHe was tired, terribly, suddenly tired. He took his hands from the\nviewplate controls, relaxed, and dropped off to sleep.\n\n\"What made me so tired--wonder--GOD!\" He straightened with a jerk, and\nhis hands flew to the controls. The view on the machine suddenly\nretreated, flew back with a velocity inconceivable. Earth dropped away\nfrom the ship with an apparent velocity a thousand times that of light;\nit was a tiny ball, a pinpoint, gone, the sun--a minute disc--gone--then\nthe apparatus was flashing views into focus from the other side of the\nship. The assistant did not reply. Evans' hands were growing ineffably\nheavy, his whole body yearned for sleep. Slowly, clumsily he pawed for a\nlittle stud. Somehow his hand found it, and the ship reeled suddenly,\nlittle jerks, as the code message was flung out in a beam of such\ntremendous power that the sheer radiation pressure made it noticeable.\nEarth would be notified. The system would be warned. But light, slow\ncrawling thing, would take hours to cross the gulf of space, and radio\ntravels no faster.\n\nHalf conscious, fighting for his faculties with all his will, the pilot\nturned to the screen. A ship! A strange, glistening thing streamlined to\nthe nth degree, every spare corner rounded till the resistance was at\nthe irreducible minimum. But, in the great pilotport of the stranger,\nthe patrol pilot saw faces, and gasped in surprise as he saw them!\nTerrible faces, blotched, contorted. Patches of white skin, patches of\nbrown, patches of black, blotched and twisted across the faces. Long,\nlean faces, great wide flat foreheads above, skulls strangely squared,\nmore box-like than man's rounded skull. The ears were large, pointed\ntips at the top. Their hair was a silky mane that extended low over the\nforehead, and ran back, spreading above the ears, and down the neck.\n\nThen, as that emotion of surprise and astonishment weakened his will\nmomentarily, oblivion came, with what seemed a fleeting instant of\nmemories. His life seemed to flash before his mind in serried rank, a\nfile of events, his childhood, his life, his marriage, his wife, an\nimage of smiling comfort, then the years, images of great and near great\nmen, his knowledge of history, pictures of great war of 2074, pictures\nof the attackers of the Black Star--then calm oblivion, quiet blankness.\n\nThe long, silent ship that had hovered near him turned, and pointed\ntoward the pinhead of matter that glowed brilliantly in the flaming\njewel box of the heavens. It was gone in an instant, rushing toward Sun\nand Earth at a speed that outraced the flying radio message, leaving the\nship of the Guard Patrol behind, and leaving the Pilot as he leaves our\nstory.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\nCANINE PEOPLE\n\n\n\"And that,\" said Arcot between puffs, \"will certainly be a great boon to\nthe Rocket Patrol, you must admit. They don't like dueling with these\nspace-pirates using the molecular rays, and since molecular rays have\nsuch a tremendous commercial value, we can't prohibit the sale of ray\napparatus. Now, if you will come into the 'workshop,' Fuller, I'll give\na demonstration with friend Morey's help.\"\n\nThe four friends rose, Morey, Wade and Fuller following Arcot into his\nlaboratory on the thirty-seventh floor of the Arcot Research Building.\nAs they went, Arcot explained to Fuller the results and principles of\nthe latest product of the ingenuity of the \"Triumvirate,\" as Arcot,\nMorey and Wade had come to be called in the news dispatches.\n\n\"As you know, the molecular rays make all the molecules of any piece of\nmatter they are turned upon move in the desired direction. Since they\nsupply no new energy, but make the body they are turned upon supply its\nown, using the energy of its own random molecular motion of heat, they\nare practically impossible to stop. The energy necessary for molecular\nrays to take effect is so small that the usual type of filter lets\nenough of it pass. A ship equipped with filters is no better off when\nattacked than one without. The rays simply drove the front end into the\nrear, or _vice versa_, or tore it to pieces as the pirates desired. The\nRocket Patrol could kill off the pirates, but they lost so many men in\nthe process, it was a Phyrric victory.\n\n\"For some time Morey and I have been working on something to stop the\nrays. Obviously it can't be by means of any of the usual metallic energy\nabsorption screens.\n\n\"We finally found a combination of rays, better frequencies, that did\nwhat we wanted. I have such an apparatus here. What we want you to do,\nof course, is the usual job of rearranging the stuff so that the\napparatus can be made from dies, and put into quantity production. As\nthe Official Designer for the A.A.L. you ought to do that easily.\" Arcot\ngrinned as Fuller looked in amazement at the apparatus Arcot had picked\nup from the bench in the \"workshop.\"\n\n\"Don't get worried,\" laughed Morey, \"that's got a lifting unit\ncombined--just a plain ordinary molecular lift such as you see by the\nhundreds out there.\" Morey pointed through the great window where\nthousands of those lift units were carrying men, women and children\nthrough the air, lifting them hundreds, thousands of feet above the\nstreets and through the doors of buildings.\n\n\"Here's an ordinary molecular pistol. I'm going to put the suit on, and\nrise about five feet off the floor. You can turn the pistol on me, and\nsee what impression it makes on the suit.\"\n\nFuller took the molecular ray pistol, while Wade helped Arcot into the\nsuit. He looked at the pistol dubiously, pointed it at a heavy casting\nof iron resting in one corner of the room, and turned the ray at low\nconcentration, then pressed the trigger-button. The casting gave out a\nlow, scrunching grind, and slid toward him with a lurch. Instantly he\nshut off the power. \"This isn't any ordinary pistol. It's got seven or\neight times the ordinary power!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh yes, I forgot,\" Morey said. \"Instead of the fuel battery that the\nearly pistols used, this has a space-distortion power coil. This pistol\nhas as much power as the usual A-39 power unit for commercial work.\"\n\nBy the time Morey had explained the changes to Fuller, Arcot had the\nsuit on, and was floating five or six feet in the air, like a grotesque\ncaptive balloon. \"Ready, Fuller?\"\n\n\"I guess so, but I certainly hope that suit is all it is claimed to be.\nIf it isn't--well I'd rather not commit murder.\"\n\n\"It'll work,\" said Arcot. \"I'll bet my neck on that!\" Suddenly he was\nsurrounded by the faintest of auras, a strange, wavering blue light,\nlike the hazy corona about a 400,000-volt power line. \"Now try it.\"\n\nFuller pointed the pistol at the floating man and pushed the trigger.\nThe brilliant blue beam of the molecular ray, and the low hum of the\nair, rushing in the path of the director beam, stabbed out toward Arcot.\nThe faint aura about him was suddenly intensified a million times till\nhe floated in a ball of blue-white fire. Scarcely visible, the air about\nhim blazed with bluish incandescence of ionization.\n\n\"Increase the power,\" suggested Morey. Fuller turned on more power. The\nblue halo was shot through with tiny violet sparks, the sharp odor of\nozone in the air was stifling; the heat of wasted energy was making the\nroom hotter. The power increased further, and the tiny sparks were\nwaving streamers, that laced across the surface of the blue fire. Little\njets of electric flame reached out along the beam of the ray now.\nFinally, as full power of the molecular ray was reached, the entire halo\nwas buried under a mass of writhing sparks that seemed to leap up into\nthe air above the man's head, wavering up to extinction. The room was\nunbearably hot, despite the molecular ray coolers absorbing the heat of\nthe air, and blowing cooled air into the room.\n\nFuller snapped off the ray, and put the pistol on the table beside him.\nThe halo died, and went out a moment later, and Arcot settled to the\nfloor.\n\n\"This particular suit will stand up against anything the ordinary\ncommercial sets will give. The system now: remember that the rays are\nshort electrical waves. The easiest way to stop them is to interpose a\nwave of opposite phase, and cause interference. Fine, but try to get in\ntune with an unknown wave when it is moving in relation to your center\nof control. It is impossible to do it before you yourself have been\nrayed out of existence. We must use some system that will automatically,\ninstantly be out of phase.\n\n\"The Hall effect would naturally tend to make the frequency of a wave\nthrough a resisting medium change, and lengthen. If we can send out a\nspherical wave front, and have it lengthen rapidly as it proceeds, we\nwill have a wave front that is, at all points, different. Any entering\nwave would, sooner or later, meet a wave that was half a phase out, no\nmatter what the motion was, nor what the frequency, as long as it lies\nwithin the comparatively narrow molecular wave band. What this\napparatus, or ray screen, consists of, is a machine generating a\nspherical wave front of the nature of a molecular wave, but of just too\ngreat a frequency to do anything. A second part generates a condition in\nspace, which opposes that wave. After traveling a certain distance, the\nwave has lengthened to molecular wave type, but is now beyond the\nmachine which generated it, and no longer affects it, or damages it.\nHowever, as it proceeds, it continues to lengthen, till eventually it\nreaches the length of infra-light, when the air quickly absorbs it, as\nit reaches one of the absorption bands for air molecular waves, and any\nmolecular wave must find its half-wave complement somewhere in that\nwedge of waves. It does, and is at once choked off, its energy fighting\nthe energy of the ray screen, of course. In the air, however, the screen\nis greatly helped by the fact that before the half-wave frequency is met\nin the ray-wedge, the molecular ray is buried in ions, leaving the ray\nscreen little work to do.\n\n\"Now your job is to design the apparatus in a form that machines can\nmake automatically. We tried doing it ourselves for the fun of it, but\nwe couldn't see how we could make a machine that didn't need at least\ntwo humans to supervise.\"\n\n\"Well,\" grinned Fuller, \"you have it all over me as scientists, but as\neconomic workers--two human supervisors to make one product!\"\n\n\"All right--we agree. But no, let's see you--Lord! What was that?\" Morey\nstarted for the door on the run. The building was still trembling from\nthe shock of a heavy blow, a blow that seemed much as though a machine\nhad been wrecked on the armored roof, and a big machine at that. Arcot,\na flying suit already on, was up in the air, and darting past Morey in\nan instant, streaking for the vertical shaft that would let him out to\nthe roof. The molecular ray pistol was already in his hand, ready to\npull any beams off unfortunate victims pinned under them.\n\nIn a moment he had flashed up through the seven stories, and out to the\nroof. A gigantic silvery machine rested there, streamlined to\nperfection, its hull dazzingly beautiful in the sunlight. A door opened,\nand three tall, lean men stepped from it. Already people were collecting\nabout the ship, flying up from below. Air patrolmen floated up in a\nminute, and seeing Arcot, held the crowd back.\n\nThe strange men were tall, eight feet or more in height. Great, round,\nsoft brown eyes looked in curiosity at the towering multicolored\nbuildings, at the people floating in the air, at the green trees and the\nblue sky, the yellowish sun.\n\nArcot looked at their strangely blotched and mottled heads, faces, arms\nand hands. Their feet were very long and narrow, their legs long and\nthin. Their faces were kindly; the mottled skin, brown and white and\nblack, seemed not to make them ugly. It was not a disfigurement; it\nseemed oddly familiar and natural in some reminiscent way.\n\n\"Lord, Arcot--queer specimens, yet they seem familiar!\" said Morey in an\nundertone.\n\n\"They are. Their race is that of man's first and best friend, the dog!\nSee the brown eyes? The typical teeth? The feet still show the traces of\nthe dog's toe-step. Their nails, not flat like human ones but rounded?\nThe mottled skin, the ears--look, one is advancing.\"\n\nOne of the strangers walked laboriously forward. A lighter world than\nEarth was evidently his home. His great brown eyes fixed themselves on\nArcot's. Arcot watched them. They seemed to expand, grow larger; they\nseemed to fill all the sky. Hypnotism! He concentrated his mind, and the\neyes suddenly contracted to the normal eyes of the stranger. The man\nreeled back, as Arcot's telepathic command to sleep came, stronger than\nhis own will. The stranger's friends caught him, shook him, but he\nslept. One of the others looked at Arcot; his eyes seemed hurt,\ndesperately pleading.\n\nArcot strode forward, and quickly brought the man out of the trance. He\nshook his head, smiled at Arcot, then, with desperate difficulty, he\nenunciated some words in English, terribly distorted.\n\n\"Ahy wizz tahk. Vokle kohds ron. Tahk by breen.\"\n\nDistorted as it was, Arcot recognized the meaning without difficulty. \"I\nwish (to) talk. Vocal cords wrong. Talk by brain.\" He switched to\ncommunication by the Venerian method, telepathically, but without\nhypnotism.\n\n\"Good enough. When you attempted to hypnotize me, I didn't known what\nyou wanted. It is not necessary to hypnotize to carry on communication\nby the method of the second world of this system. What brings you to our\nsystem? From what system do you come? What do you wish to say?\"\n\nThe other, not having learned the Venerian system, had great difficulty\nin communicating his thoughts, but Arcot learned that they had machines\nwhich would make it easier, and the terrestrian invited them into his\nlaboratory, for the crowd was steadily growing.\n\nThe three returned to their ship for a moment, coming out with several\npeculiar headsets. Almost at once the ship started to rise, going up\nmore and more swiftly, as the people cleared a way for it.\n\nThen, in the tiniest fraction of a second, the ship was gone; it shrank\nto a point, and was invisible in the blue vault of the sky.\n\n\"Apparently they intend to stay a while,\" said Wade. \"They are trusting\nsouls, for their line of retreat is cut off. We naturally have no\nintention of harming them, but they can't know that.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" said Arcot. He turned to the apparent leader of the\nthree and explained that there were several stories to descend, and\nstairs were harder than a flying unit. \"Wrap your arms about my legs,\nwhen I rise above you, and hold on till your feet are on the floor\nagain,\" he concluded.\n\nThe stranger walked a little closer to the edge of the shaft, and looked\ndown. White bulbs illuminated its walls down its length to the ground.\nThe man talked rapidly to his friends, looking with evident distaste at\nthe shaft, and the tiny pack on Arcot's back. Finally, smiling, he\nevinced his willingness. Arcot rose, the man grasped his legs, and then\nboth rose. Over the shaft, and down to his laboratory was the work of a\nmoment.\n\nArcot led them into his \"consultation room,\" where a number of\ncomfortable chairs were arranged, facing each other. He seated them\ntogether, and his own friends facing them.\n\n\"Friends of another world,\" began Arcot, \"we do not know your errand\nhere, but you evidently have good reason for coming to this place. It is\nunlikely that your landing was the result of sheer chance. What brought\nyou? How came you to this point?\"\n\n\"It is difficult for me to reply. First we must be _en rapport_. Our\nsystem is not simple as yours, but more effective, for yours depends on\nthought ideas, not altogether universal. Place these on your heads, for\nonly a moment. I must induce temporary hypnotic coma. Let one try first\nif you desire.\" The leader of the visitors held out one of the several\nheadsets they had brought, caplike things, made of laminated metal\napparently.\n\nArcot hesitated, then with a grin slipped it on.\n\n\"Relax,\" came a voice in Arcot's head, a low, droning voice, a voice of\ncommand. \"Sleep,\" it added. Arcot felt himself floating down an infinite\nshaft, on some superflying suit that did not pull at him with its\nstraps, just floating down lightly, down and down and down. Suddenly he\nreached the bottom, and found to his surprise that it led directly into\nthe room again! He was back. \"You are awake. Speak!\" came the voice.\n\nArcot shook himself, and looked about. A new voice spoke now, not the\ntonelessly melodious voice, but the voice of an individual, yet a mental\nvoice. It was perfectly clear, and perfectly comprehensible. \"We have\ntraveled far to find you, and now we have business of the utmost import.\nAsk these others to let us treat them, for we must do what we can in the\nleast possible time. I will explain when all can understand. I am Zezdon\nFentes, First Student of Thought. He who sits on my right is Zezdon\nAfthen, and he beyond him, is Zezdon Inthel, of Physics and of\nChemistry, respectively.\"\n\nAnd now Arcot spoke to his friends.\n\n\"These men have something of the greatest importance to tell us, it\nseems. They want us all to hear, and they are in a hurry. The treatment\nisn't at all annoying. Try it. The man on the extreme right, as we face\nthem, is Zezdon Fentes of Thought, Zezdon apparently meaning something\nlike professor, or 'First Student of.' Those next him are Zezdon Afthen\nof Physics and Zezdon Inthel of Chemistry.\"\n\nZezdon Afthen offered them the headsets, and in a moment everyone\npresent was wearing one. The process of putting them _en rapport_ took\nvery little time, and shortly all were able to communicate with ease.\n\n\"Friends of Earth, we must tell our strange story quickly for the\nbenefit of your world as well as ours, and others, too. We cannot so\nmuch as annoy. We are helpless to combat them.\n\n\"Our world lies far out across the galaxy; even with incalculable\nvelocity of the great swift thing that bore us, three long months have\nwe traveled toward your distant worlds, hoping that at last the Invaders\nmight meet their masters.\n\n\"We landed on this roof because we examined mentally the knowledge of a\npilot of one of your patrol ships. His mind told us that here we would\nfind the three greatest students of Science of this Solar System. So it\nwas here we came for help.\n\n\"Our race has arisen,\" he continued, \"as you have so surely determined\nfrom the race you call canines. It was artificially produced by the\nAncient Masters when their hour of need had come. We have lost the great\nscience of the Ancient Ones. But we have developed a different science,\na science of the mind.\"\n\n\"Dogs are far more psychic than are men. They would naturally tend to\ndevelop such a civilization,\" said Arcot judiciously.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\nA QUARTER OF A MILLION LIGHT YEARS\n\n\n\"Our civilization,\" continued Zezdon Afthen, \"is built largely on the\nknowledge of the mind. We cannot have criminals, for the man who plots\nevil is surely found out by his thoughts. We cannot have lying\npoliticians and unjust rulers.\n\n\"It is a peaceful civilization. The Ancient Masters feared and hated War\nwith a mighty aversion. But they did not make our race cowards, merely\npeaceful intelligence. Now we must fight for our homes, and my race will\nfight mightily. But we need weapons.\n\n\"But my story has little to do with our race. I will tell the story of\nour civilization and of the Ancient Ones later when the time is more\nauspicious.\n\n\"Four months ago, our mental vibration instruments detected powerful\nemanations from space. That could only mean that a new, highly\nintelligent race had suddenly appeared within a billion miles of our\nworld. The directional devices quickly spotted it as emanating from the\nthird planet of our system. Zezdon Fentes, with my aid, set up some\nspecial apparatus, which would pick up strong thoughts and make them\nvisible. We had used this before to see not only what an enemy\nlooked upon, but also what he saw in that curious thing, the eye\nof the mind, the vision of the past and the future. But while the\nthought-amplification device was powerful, the new emanations were hard\nto separate from each other.\n\n\"It was done finally, when all but one man slept. That one we were\nenable to tune sharply to. After that we could reach him at any time. He\nwas the commander. We saw him operate the ship, we saw the ship, saw it\nglide over the barren, rocky surface of that world. We saw other men\ncome in and go out. They were strange men. Short, squat, bulky men.\nTheir arms were short and stocky. But their strength was enormous,\nunbelievable. We saw them bend solid bars of steel as thick as my arm.\nWith perfect ease!\n\n\"Their brains were tremendously active, but they were evil, selfishly\nevil. Nothing that did not benefit them counted. At one time our\ninstruments went dead, and we feared that the commander had detected us,\nbut we saw what happened a little later. The second in command had\nkilled him.\n\n\"We saw them examine the world, working their way across it, wearing\nheavy suits, yet, for all the terrific gravity of that world, bouncing\nabout like rubber balls, leaping and jumping where they wanted. Their\nlegs would drive out like pistons, and they soared up and through the\nair.\n\n\"They were tired while they made those examinations, and slept heavily\nat night.\n\n\"Then one night there was a conference. We saw then what they intended.\nBefore we had tried desperately to signal them. Now we were glad that we\nhad failed.\n\n\"We saw their ship rise (in the thoughts of the second in command) and\nsail out into space, and rush toward our world. The world grew larger,\nbut it was imperfectly sketched in, for they did not know our world\nwell. Their telescopes did not have great power as your electric\ntelescopes have.\n\n\"We saw them investigate the planet. We saw them plan to destroy any\npeople they found with a ray which was as follows: 'the ray which makes\nall parts move as one.' We could not understand and could not interpret.\nThoughts beyond our knowledge have, of course, no meaning, even when our\nmental amplifiers get them, and bring them to us.\"\n\n\"The Molecular ray!\" gasped Morey in surprise. \"They will be an enemy.\"\n\n\"You know it! It is familiar to you! You have it? You can fight it?\"\nasked Zezdon Afthen excitedly.\n\n\"We know it, and can fight it, if that is all they have.\"\n\n\"They have more--much more I fear,\" replied Zezdon Afthen. \"At any rate,\nwe saw what they intended. If our world was inhabited, they would\ndestroy every one on it, and then other men of their race were to float\nin on their great ships, and settle on that largest of our worlds.\n\n\"We had to stop them so we did what we could. We had powerful machines,\nwhich would amplify and broadcast our thoughts. So we broadcast our\nthought-waves, and implanted in the mind of their leader that it would\nbe wise to land, and learn the extent of the civilization, and the\nweapons to be met. Also, as the ship drew nearer, we made him decide on\na certain spot we had prepared for him.\n\n\"He never guessed that the thoughts were not his own. Only the ideas\ncame to him, seeming to spring from his own mind.\n\n\"He landed--and we used our one weapon. It was a thing left to one group\nof rulers when the Ancient Masters left us to care for ourselves. What\nit was, we never knew; we had never used it in the fifteen thousand\nyears since the Great Masters had passed--never had to. But now it was\nbrought out, and concealed behind great piles of rock in a deep canyon\nwhere the ship of the enemy would land. When it landed, we turned the\nbeam of the machine on it, and the apparatus rotated it swiftly, and a\ncone of the beam's ray was formed as the beam was swung through a small\ncircle in the vertical plane. The machine leaped backward, and though it\nwas so massive that a tremendous amount of labor had been required to\nbring it there, the push of the pencil of force we sent out hurled it\nback against a rocky cliff behind it as though it were some child's toy.\nIt continued to operate for perhaps a second, perhaps two. In that time\ntwo great holes had been cut in the enemy ship, holes fifteen feet\nacross, that ran completely through the hull as though a die had cut\nthrough the metal of the ship, cutting out a disc of metal.\n\n\"There was a terrific concussion, and a roar as the air blasted out of\nthe ship. It did not take us long to discover that the enemy were dead.\nTheir terrible, bloated corpses lay everywhere in the ship. Most of the\nmen we were able to recognize, having seen them in the mentovisor. But\nthe colors were distorted, and their forms were peculiar. Indeed, the\nwhole ship seemed strange. The only time that things ever did seem\nnormal about that strange thing, when the angles of it seemed what they\nwere, when the machines did not seem out of proportion, out of shape,\ntwisted, was when on a trial trip we ventured very close to our sun.\"\n\nArcot whistled softly and looked at Morey. Morey nodded. \"Probably\nright. Don't interrupt.\"\n\n\"That you thought something, I understood, but the thoughts themselves\nwere hopelessly unintelligible to me. You know the explanation?\" asked\nZezdon Afthen eagerly.\n\n\"We think so. The ship was evidently made on a world of huge size. Those\nmen, their stocky, block legs and arms, their entire build and their\ndesire for the largest of your planets, would indicate that. Their own\nworld was probably even larger--they were forced to wear pressure suits\neven on that large world, and could jump all over, you said. On so huge\na sphere as their native world seems to be, the gravity would be so\nintense as to distort space. Geometry, such as yours seems to be, and\nsuch as ours was, could never be developed, for you assume the existence\nof a straight line, and of an absolute plane surface. These things\ncannot exist in space, but on small worlds, far from the central sun's\nmass, the conditions approach that without sufficient discrepency to\nmake the error obvious. On so huge a globe as their world the space is\nso curved that it is at once obvious that no straight line exists, and\nthat no plane exists. Their geometry would never be like ours. When you\nwent close to your sun, the attraction was sufficient to curve space\ninto a semblance of the natural conditions on their home planet, then\nyour senses and the ship met a compromise condition which made it seem\nmore or less normal, not so obviously strange to you.\n\n\"But continue.\" Arcot looked at Afthen interestedly.\n\n\"There were none left in their ship now, and we had been careful in\nlocating the first hole, that it should not damage the propulsive\nmachinery. The second hole was accidental, due to the shift of the\nmachine. The machine itself was wrecked now, crushed by its own\nreaction. We forgot that any pencil of force powerful enough to do what\nwe wanted, would tear the machine from its moorings unless fastened with\ngreat steel bolts into the solid rock.\n\n\"The second hole had been far to the rear, and had, by ill-luck, cut out\na portion of the driving apparatus. We could not repair that, though we\ndid succeed at last in lifting the great discs into place. We attempted\nto cut them, and put them back in sections. Our finest saws and machines\ndid not nick them. Their weight was unbelievable, and yet we finally\nsucceeded in lifting the things into the wall of the ship. The actual\nmissing material did not represent more than a tiny cut, perhaps as wide\nas one of your credit-discs. You could slip the thin piece of metal in\nbetween them, but not so much as your finger.\n\n\"Those slots we welded tight with our best steel, letting a flap hang\nover on each side of the cut, and as the hot metal cooled, it was drawn\nagainst the shining walls with terrific force. The joints were perfectly\nairtight.\n\n\"The machines proper were repaired to the greatest possible extent. It\nwas a heartbreaking task, for we must only guess at what machines should\nbe connected together. Much damage had been done by the rushing air as\nit left, for it filled the machines, too, and they were not designed to\nresist the terrific air pressure that was on them when the pressure in\nthe ship escaped. Many of the machines had been burst open, and these we\ncould repair when we had the necessary elements and knew their\nconstruction from the remnants, or could find unbroken duplicates in the\nstock rooms.\n\n\"Once we connected the wrong things. This will show you what we dealt\nwith. They were the wrong poles--two generators, connected together in\nthe wrong way. There was a terrific crash when the switch was thrown,\nand huge sheets of electric flame leaped from one of them. Two men were\nkilled, incinerated in an instant, even the odors one might expect were\nkilled in that flash of heat. Everything save the shining metal and\nclear glass within ten feet of it was instantly wiped out. And there was\na fuse link that gave. The generator was ruined. One was left, and\nseveral small auxiliary generators.\n\n\"Eventually, we did the job. We made the machine work. And we are here.\n\n\"We have come to warn you, and to ask aid. Your system also has a large\nplanet, slightly smaller than the largest of our system, but yet\nattractive. There are approximately 50,000 planetary systems in this\nuniverse, according to the records of the Invaders. Their world is not\nof this system. It is the World Thett, sun Antseck, Universe Venone.\nWhere that is, or even what it means, we do not know. Perhaps you\nunderstand.\n\n\"But they investigated your world, and its address, according to their\nrecords, was World 3769-8482730-3. This, I believe, means, Universe\n3769, sun 8482730, world 3. They have been investigating this system now\nfor nearly three centuries. It was close to 200 years ago that they\nvisited your world--two hundred years of your time.\"\n\n\"This is 2129--which makes it about the year 1929-30 that they floated\naround here investigating. Why haven't they done anything?\" Arcot asked\nhim.\n\n\"They waited for an auspicious time. They are afraid now, for recently\nthey visited your world, and were utterly amazed to find the\nunbelievable progress your people have made. They intend to make an\nimmediate attack on all worlds known to be intelligently populated. They\nhad made the mistake of letting one race learn too much; they cannot\nafford to let it happen again.\n\n\"There are only twenty-one inhabited worlds known, and their thousands\nof scouts have already investigated nearly all the central mass of this\nuniverse, and much of the outer rings. They have established a base in\nthis universe. Where I do not know. That, alone, was never mentioned in\nthe records. But of all peoples, they feared only your world.\n\n\"There is one race in the universe far older than yours, but they are a\nsleeping people. Long ago their culture decayed. Still, now they are not\nfar from you, and perhaps it will be worth the few days needed to learn\nmore about them. We have their location and can take you there. Their\nworld circles a dead star--\"\n\n\"Not any more,\" laughed Morey grimly. \"That's another surprise for the\nenemy. They had a little jog, and they certainly are wide awake now.\nThey are headed for big things, and they are going to do a lot.\"\n\n\"But how do you know these things? You have ships that can go from\nplanet to planet, I know, but the records of the enemy said you could\nnot leave the system of your sun. They alone knew that secret.\"\n\n\"Another surprise for them,\" said Morey. \"We can--and we can move faster\nthan your ship, if not faster than they. The people of the dead star\nhave moved to a very live star--Sirius, the brightest in our heavens.\nAnd they are as much alive now as their new sun. They can move faster\nthan light, also. We had a little misunderstanding a while back, when\ntheir star passed close to ours. They came off second best, and we\nhaven't spoken to them since. But I think we can make valuable allies\nthere.\"\n\nFor all Morey's jocular manner, he realized the terrible import of this\nannouncement. A race which had been able to cross the vast gulf of\nintergalactic space in the days when Terrestrians were still developing\nthe airplane--and already they had mapped Jupiter, and planned their\ncolonies! What developments had come? They had molecular rays, cosmic\nrays, the energy of matter, then--what else had they now? Lux and Relux,\nthe two artificial metals, made of solidified light, far stronger than\nanything of molecular structure in nature, absolutely infusible, totally\ninert chemically, one a perfect conductor of light and of all radiation\nin space, the other a perfect reflector of all radiations--save\nmolecular rays. Made into the condition of reflection by the action of\nspecial frequencies in its formation from light, molecular frequencies\nwere, unfortunately, able to convert it into perfectly transparent lux\nmetal, when the protective value was gone.\n\nThey had that. All Earth had, perhaps.\n\n\"There was one other race of some importance, the others were\nsemi-civilized. They rated us in a position between these races and the\nhigh races--yours, those of the dead star, and those of world\n3769-37:478:326:894-6. Our science had been investigated two hundred or\nso years ago.\n\n\"This other race was at a great distance from us, greater than yours,\nand apparently not feared as greatly as yours. They cannot cross to\nother worlds, save in small ships driven solely by fire, which the\nThessians have called a 'hopelessly inefficient and laughably awkward\nthing to ride in.'\"\n\n\"Rockets,\" grinned Morey. \"Our first ship was part rocket.\"\n\nZezdon Fentes smiled. \"But that is all. We have brought you warning, and\nour plea. Can you help us?\"\n\n\"We cannot answer that. The Interplanetary Council must act. But I am\nafraid that it will be all we can do to protect our own world if this\nenemy attacks soon, and I fear they will. Since they have a base in this\nuniverse, it is impossible to believe that all ships did not report back\nto the home world at stated intervals. That one is missing will soon be\ndiscovered, and it will be sought. War will start at once. Three months\nit took you to reach us--they should come soon.\n\n\"Those men who left will be on their way back from the home world from\nwhich they came. What do you call your planet, friend?\"\n\n\"Ortol is our home,\" replied Zezdon Inthel.\n\n\"At any rate, I can only assure you that your world will be given\nweapons that will permit your people to defend themselves and I will get\nyou to your home within twenty-four hours. Your ship--is it in the\nsystem?\"\n\n\"It waits on the second satellite of the fourth planet,\" replied Zezdon\nAfthen.\n\n\"Signal them, and tell them to land where a beacon of intense light,\nalternating red and blue, reaches up from--this point on the map.\" Arcot\npointed out the spot in Vermont where their private lake and laboratory\nwere.\n\nHe turned to the others, and in rapid-fire English, explained his plans.\n\"We need the help of these people as much as they need ours. I think\nZezdon Fentes will stay here and help you. The others will go with us to\ntheir world. There we shall have plenty of work to do, but on the way we\nare going to stop at Mars and pick up that valuable ship of theirs and\nmake a careful examination for possible new weapons, their system of\nspeed-drive, and their regular space-drive. I'm willing to make a bet\nright now, that I can guess both. Their regular drive is a molecular\ndrive with lead disintegration apparatus for the energy, cosmic ray\nabsorbers for the heating, and a drive much like ours. Their speed drive\nis a time distortion apparatus, I'll wager. Time distinction offers an\neasy solution of speed. All speed is relative--relative to other bodies,\nbut also to time-speed. But we'll see.\n\n\"I'm going to hustle some workmen to installing the biggest spare power\nboard I can get into the storerooms of the _Ancient Mariner_, and pack\nin a ray-screen. It will be useful. Let's move.\"\n\n\"Our ship,\" said Zezdon Afthen, \"will land in three of your hours.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\nTHE FIRST MOVE\n\n\nThe Ortolians were standing on a low, green-clad hill. Below them\nstretched the green flank of the little rise, and beyond lay ridge after\nridge of the broad, smooth carpet of the beautiful Vermont hills.\n\n\"Man of Earth,\" said Zezdon Afthen, turning at last to Wade, who stood\nbehind him. \"It took us three months of constant flight at a speed\nunthinkable, through space dotted with the titanic gems of the Outer\nDark, stars gleaming in red, and blue and orange, some titanic\nlighthouses of our course, others dim pinpoints of glowing color. It was\na scene of unspeakable grandeur, but it was so awesomely mighty in its\nscope, one was afraid, and his soul shriveled within him as he looked at\nthose inconceivable masses floating forever alone in the silence of the\ninconceivable nothingness of eternal cold and eternal darkness. One was\nawed, suppressed by their sheer magnitude. A magnificent spectacle\ntruly, but one no man could love.\n\n\"Now we are at rest on a tiny pinpoint of dust in a tiny bit of a tiny\ncorner of an isolated universe, and the magnitude and stillness is gone.\nOnly the chirpings of those strange birds as they seek rest in darkness,\nthe soft gurgling of the little stream below, and the rustle of\ncountless leaves, break the silence with a satisfying existence, while\nthe loneliness of that great star, your sun, is lost in its tintings of\nsoft color, the fleeciness of the clouds, and the seeming companionship\nof green hills.\n\n\"The beauty of boundless space is awe-inspiring in its magnitude. The\nbeauty of Earth is something man can love.\n\n\"Man of Earth, you have a home that you may well fight for with all the\nstrength of your arms, all the forces of your brain, and all the\nenergies of Space that you can call forth to aid you. It is a wondrous\nworld.\" Silently he stood in the gathering dusk, as first Venus winked\ninto being, then one by one the stars came into existence in the\ndeepening color of the sky.\n\n\"Space is awesomely wonderful; this is--lovable.\" He gazed long at the\nheavens of this world so strange, so beautiful to him, looking at the\nunfamiliar heavens, as star after star flashed into the constellations\nso familiar to terrestrians and to those Venerians who had been above\nthe clouds of Venus' eternal shroud.\n\n\"But somewhere off there in space are other races, and far beyond the\npower of our eyes to see is the star that is the sun of my world, and\naround it circles that little globe that is home to me. What is\nhappening there now? Does it still exist? Are there people still living\non it? Oh, Man of Earth, let us reach that world quickly, you cannot\nguess the pangs that attack me, for if it be destroyed, think--forever I\nam without home--without friends I knew. However kind your people may be\nto me, I would be forever lonely.\n\n\"I will not think of that--only it is time your ship was ready, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"I think we had better return,\" replied Wade softly, his English words\nrousing thoughts in his mind intelligible to the Ortolians.\n\nThe three rose in the air on the molecular suits and drove quickly down\ntoward the blue gem of the lake to the east, nestled among still other\ngreen hills. Lights were showing in the great shop, where the _Ancient\nMariner_ was being fitted with the ray-shields, and all possible\nweapons. Men streaming through her were hastily stocking her with vast\nquantities of foods, stocks of fuel, all the spare parts they could cram\ninto her stock rooms.\n\nWhen the men arrived from the hilltop, the work was practically done,\nand Wade stepped up to Morey, busily checking off a list of required\nitems.\n\n\"Everything you ordered came through?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes--thanks to the pull of a two-billion dollar private fortune. Who\nsays credit-units don't have their value? This expedition never would\nhave gotten through, if it hadn't been for that.\n\n\"But we have the main space distortion power bank, and the new auxiliary\ncoils full. Ten tons of lead aboard for fuel. There's one thing we are\nafraid of. If the enemy have a system of tubes that is able to handle\nmore power than our last tube--we're sunk. These brilliant people that\nsuggest using more tubes to a ray-power bank forget the last tube has to\nhandle the entire output of all the others, and modulate it correctly.\nIf the enemy has a better tube--it will be too bad for us.\" Morey was\nfrankly worried.\n\n\"My end is all set, Morey. How soon will you be ready?\" Arcot asked.\n\n\"'Bout ten-fifteen minutes.\" Morey lit a cigarette and watched as the\nlast of the stuff was carried aboard.\n\nAt last they were ready. The _Ancient Mariner_, originally built for\nintergalactic exploration, was kept in working condition. New apparatus\nhad been incorporated in it, as their research had led to improvements,\nand it was constantly in condition, ready for a trip. Many exploration\ntrips to the nearer stars had already been made.\n\nThe ship was backed out from the hangar now, and rested on the great\nsmooth landing field, its tremendous quarter million ton mass of lux and\nrelux sinking a great, smooth depression in the turf of the field. They\nwere waiting now for the arrival of the Ortolian ship. Zezdon Afthen\nassured them it would be there in a few minutes.\n\nHigh in the sky, came the whining whistle of an approaching ship, coming\nat terrific velocity. It came nearer the field, darting toward the\nground at an unheard of speed, flashing down at a speed of well over\nthree thousand miles an hour, and, only in the last fifty feet slowed\nwith a sickening deceleration. Even so it landed with a crash of fully\ntwo hundred miles of speed. Arcot gasped at the terrible landing the\npilot had made, fully expecting to see the great hull dent somewhat,\neven though made of solid relux. And certainly the jar would kill every\nman on board. Yet the hull did not seem harmed by the crash, and even\nthe ground under the ship was but slightly disturbed, though, at a\ndistance of some thirty feet, the entire block of soil was crushed, and\ncracked by the terrific impact of hundreds of thousands of tons striking\nwith terrific energy.\n\n\"Lord, it's a wonder they didn't kill themselves. I never saw such a\nrotten landing,\" exclaimed Morey with disgust.\n\n\"Don't be too sure. I think they landed gently, and at very low speed.\nNotice how little the soil directly under them was dented?\" replied\nArcot, walking forward. \"They have time control, as I suspected. Ask\nthem. They drifted in gently. Their time rate was speeded up\ntremendously, so that what was hundreds of miles per hour to us was feet\nper minute to them. But come on, get the handlers to bring that junk up\nto the door--they are coming out.\"\n\nOne of the tall, kindly-faced canine people was standing in the doorway\nnow, the white light streaming out around him into the night, casting a\ngrotesque shadow on the landing field, for all the flood lights bathing\nin it.\n\nZezdon Afthen came up and spoke quickly to the man evidently in command\nof the ship. The entire party went into the ship, and the cream of their\nlaboratory instruments was brought in.\n\nFor hours Arcot, Morey and Wade worked at the apparatus in the ship,\nmeasuring, calculating, following electrical and magnetic and sheer\nforce hook-ups of staggering complexity. They were not trying to find\nthe exact method of construction, only the principles involved, so that\nthey could perform calculations of their own, and duplicate the results\nof the enemy. Thus they would be far more thoroughly familiar with the\nmachinery when done.\n\nLittle attention was paid to the actual driving plant, for it was a\nmolecular drive with the same type of lead-fuel burner they used in\ntheir own ship. The tubes of the power bank were, however, a puzzle to\nthem. They were made of relux, so that it was impossible to see the\ninterior of the tube. To open one was to destroy it, but calculations\nmade from readings of their instruments showed that they were more\nefficient, and could readily carry nearly half again the load that the\nbest terrestrian tubes could sustain. This meant the enemy could send\nheavier rays and heavier ray screens.\n\nBut finally they returned to the _Ancient Mariner_, and as the Ortolian\nship whined its way out to space, the _Ancient Mariner_ started, rising\nfaster and faster through the atmosphere till it was in the night of\nspace. Then the molecular power was shut off. The ship suddenly seemed\nto writhe, space was black and starless about them, then sparkling\nweirdly distorted stars, all before them. They were moving already.\nAlmost before the Ortolians fully realized what was happening, a dozen\nstars had swung past the ship, driving on now at better than five light\nyears in every second. At this speed, approximately fourteen hours would\nbe needed to reach Ortol.\n\n\"Now, Arcot, perhaps you will explain to me the secret of this ship,\"\nsaid Zezdon Afthen at last, turning from the great lux pilot's window,\nto Arcot seated in the pilot's chair. \"I know that only the broadest\nprinciples will be intelligible to me, for I could not understand that\nship we captured, after almost four months of study. Yet it crept\nthrough space compared with this ship. Certainly no ship could\noutdistance this in a race!\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact--watch!\" Arcot pushed a little metal button along a\nslide to the extreme end. Again the ship seemed to writhe. Space was no\nlonger black, but faintly gray, and beside them, on either side, floated\ntwo exact replicas of their ship! Zezdon Afthen stared. But in another\nmoment, both were gone, and space was black, yet in but a few moments a\ngrayness was showing, and light was appearing from all about, growing\ngradually in intensity. For three seconds Arcot continued thus, then he\npulled the metal button down the slide, and flicked over another that he\nhad pulled to cause the second change. The stars were again before them,\ntheir colors changed beyond all recognition at that speed. But the\norientation of the stars behind them had been familiar. Now an entirely\ndifferent set of constellation showed.\n\n\"I merely opened the ship out to her maximum speed for a moment. I was\nable to see any large star 2000 light years in our path, and there were\nnone. Small stars do not bother us as I will explain. When I put on full\npower of the main power coils, I drove the ship up to a speed of 30\nlight years a second. When I turned in the full power of the auxiliary\ncoils as well I doubled the power, and the speed was multiplied by\neight. The result was that in the four seconds of racing, we made\napproximately 1000 light years!\"\n\nZezdon Afthen gasped. \"Two hundred and forty light years _per second_\"!\nHe paused in bewilderment. \"Suppose we had struck a small sun, a dark\nstar, even a meteor at that speed? What would have been the result?\"\n\nArcot smiled. \"The chances are excellent that we plowed through more\nthan one meteor, more than one dark star, and more than one small sun.\n\n\"But this is the secret: the ship attains the speed only by going out of\nspace. _Nothing in space can attain the speed of light, save radiation._\nNothing in normal space. But, we alter space, make space along patterns\nwe choose, and so distort it that the natural speed of radiation is\nenormously greater. In fact, we so change space that nothing can go\n_slower_ than a speed we fix.\n\n\"Morey--show Afthen the coils, and explain it all to him. I've got to\nstay here.\"\n\nMorey rose, and diving through the weightless ship, went down to the\npower room, Zezdon Afthen following. Here, giant pots five feet high\nwere in close packed rows. The \"pots\" contained specially designed coils\nstoring tremendous energy, the energy of four tons of disintegrated\nlead, in the only form that energy may be stored, as a strain, or\ndistortion in space. These charged coils distorted only the space within\nthemselves, making a closed field entirely within themselves. But in the\nexact gravitational center of the quarter of a million ton ship was a\nsingle high coil of different design that distorted space around it as\nwell as the space within it. This, as Morey explained, was the control\nthat altered the constants of space to suit. The coils were charged, and\nthe energy stored. Their energy could be pumped into the big coil, and\nthen, when the ship slowed to normal space, could be pumped back to\nthem. The pumping energy, as well as any further energy needed for\nrecharging the coils could be supplied by three huge power generators.\n\n\"These energy-producers,\" Morey explained, \"work on a principle known\nfor hundreds of years on Earth. Lead, when reduced to a temperature\napproaching absolute zero as closely as, for instance, liquid helium,\nhas _no_ electrical resistance. In other words, no matter how great a\ncurrent is sent through it, there is no resistance, and no heat is\nproduced to raise the temperature. What we do is to send a powerful\ncurrent through a lead wire. The wire has a current density so huge that\nthe atoms are destroyed, and the protons and electrons coalesce into\npure radiant energy. Relux, under the influence of a magnetic field,\nconverts this directly into electrical potential. Electricity we can\nconvert to the spatial strain in the power coils, and thus the ship is\ndriven.\" Morey pointed out the huge molecular power cylinder overhead,\nwhere the main power drive was located in the inertial center of the\nship, or as near as the great space coil would permit.\n\nThe smaller power units for vertical lift, and for steering, were in the\nside walls, hidden under heavy walls of relux.\n\n\"The projectors for throwing molecular and heat rays are on the outside\nof course. Both of these projectors are protected. The walls of the ship\nare made of an outer wall of heavy lux metal, a vacuum between, and an\ninner wall of heavy relux. The lux is stronger than relux, and is\ntherefore used for an outer shell. The inner shell of relux will reflect\nany dangerous rays and serve to hold the heat in the ship, since a\nperfect reflector is a perfect non-radiator. The vacuum wall is to\nprotect the occupants of the ship against any undue heat. If we should\nget within the atmosphere of a sun, it would be disastrous if the\nphysical conduction of heat were permitted, for though the relux will\nturn out any radiated heat, it is a conductor of heat, and we would\nroast almost instantly. These artificial metals are both absolutely\ninfusible and non-volatile. The ship has actually been in the limb of a\nstar tremendously hotter than your sun or mine.\n\n\"Now you see why it is we need not fear a collision with a small sun,\nmeteor or such like. Since we are in our own, artificial space, we are\nalone, and there is nothing in space to run into. But, if we enter a\nhuge sun, the terrific gravitational field of the mass of matter would\nbe enough to pull the energy of our coil away from us. That actually\nhappened the time we made our first intergalactic exploration. But it is\nalmost impossible to fall into a large star--they are too brilliant. We\nwon't be worrying about it,\" grinned Morey.\n\n\"But how did the ship we captured operate?\" asked Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"It was a very ingenious system, very closely related to ours, really.\n\n\"We distort space and change the velocity characteristics; in other\nwords, we distort the rate of motion through distance characteristics of\nnormal space. The Thessian ships work on the principle of distorting the\nrate of progress through time instead of through space.\n\n\"_Velocity_ is really 'units of travel through space per unit of travel\nthrough time.' Now if we make the time unit twice as great, and the\nunits traveled through space are not changed, the _velocity_ is twice as\ngreat. That is, if we are moving five light years per second, make the\nsecond twice as long and we are moving ten light years per\ndouble-second. Make it ten thousand times as long, and we are traveling\nfifty thousand light years per ten-thousand-seconds. This is the\nprinciple--but there is a drawback. We might increase the velocity by\nslowing time passage, that is, if it takes me a year for one heartbeat,\ntwo years to raise my arm thus, and six months to turn, my head, if all\nmy body processes are slowed down in this way, I will be able to live a\ntremendous length of time, and though it takes me two hundred years to\ngo from one star to another, so low is my time rate that the two hundred\nyears will seem but a few minutes. I can then make a trip to a distant\nstar--one five light years distant, let us say, in three minutes to me.\nI then will say, looking at my chronometer (which has been similarly\nslowed) 'I have gone five light years in three minutes, or five thirds\nlight years per minute. I have exceeded the speed of light.'\n\n\"But people back on Earth would say, he has taken two hundred years to\ngo five light years, therefore he has gone at a speed one fortieth of\nthat of light, which would be true--for their time rate.\n\n\"But suppose I can also speed up time. That is, I can live a year in a\nminute or two. Then everyone else will be exceedingly slow. The ideal\nthing would be to combine these two effects, arranging that space about\nyour ship will have a very rapid time rate, ten thousand times that of\nnormal space. Then the speed of radiation through that space will be\n1,860,000,000 miles per second, and a speed of 1,000,000,000 miles per\nsecond would be possible, but still you, too, will be affected, so that\nthough the people back home will say you are going far faster than\nlight, you will say 'No, I am going only 100,000 miles per second.'\n\n\"But now imagine that your ship and surrounding space for one mile is at\na time rate 10,000 times normal, and you, in a space of one hundred feet\nwithin your ship, are affected by a time rate 1/10,000 that, or normal,\ndue to a second, reversing field. The two fields will not fight, or be\nmutually antagonistic; they will merely compound their effects. Result:\nyou will agree that you are exceeding the speed of light!\n\n\"Do you understand? That is the principle on which your ship operated.\nThere were two time-fields, overlapping time-fields. Remember the\nterrible speed with which your ship landed, and yet there was no\nappreciable jar according to the men? The answer of course was, that\ntheir time rate had been speeded enough, due to the fact that one field\nhad been completely shut off, the other had not.\n\n\"That is the principle. The system is so complex, naturally, that we\nhave not yet learned the actual method of working the process. We must\ndo a great deal of mathematical and physical research.\n\n\"Wish we had it done--we could use it now,\" mused the terrestrian.\n\n\"We have some other weapons, none as important, of course, as the\nmolecular ray and the heat ray. Or none that have been. But, if the\nenemy have ray shields, then perhaps these others also will be\nimportant. There are molecular motion guns, metal tubes, with molecular\ndirector apparatus at one end. A metal shell is pulling the power turned\non, and the shell leaps out at a speed of about ten miles per\nsecond--since it has been super-heated--and is very accurately aimed, as\nthere is no terrific shock of recoil to be taken up by the gun.\n\n\"But a more effective weapon, if these men are as I expect them to be,\nwill be a peculiarly effective magnetic field concentrator device, which\nwill project a magnetic field as a beam for a mile or more. How useful\nit will be--I don't know. We don't know what the enemy will turn against\n_us_!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\nORTOL\n\n\nAfter Morey's explanation of the ship was completed, Wade took Arcot's\nplace at the controls, while Morey and Arcot retired to the calculating\nroom to do some of the needed mathematics on the time-field\ninvestigation.\n\nTheir work continued here, while the Ortolians prepared a meal and\nbrought it to them, and to Wade. When at last the sun of Ortol was\ngrowing before them, Arcot took over controls from Wade once more.\nSlowing their speed to less than fifty times that of light, they drove\non. The attraction of the giant sun was draining the energy from the\ncoils so rapidly now, that at last Arcot was forced to get into normal\nspace, while the planet was still close to a million miles from them.\nMorey was showing the Ortolians the operation of the telectroscope and\nhad it trained now on the rapidly approaching planet. The planet was\neasily enlarged to a point where the features of continents were\nvisible. The magnification was increased till cities were no longer\nblurs, but truly cities.\n\nSuddenly, as city after city was brought under the action of the\nmachine, the Ortolians recognizing them with glad exclamations, one\nswept into view--and as they watched, it leapt into the air, a vast\ncolumn of dust, then twisting, whirling, it fell back in utter, chaotic\nruin.\n\nZezdon Fentes staggered back from the screen in horror.\n\n\"Arcot--drive down--increase your speed--the Thessians are there already\nand have destroyed one city,\" called Morey sharply. The men secured\nthemselves with heavy belts, as the deep toned hum of the warning echoed\nthrough the ship. A moment later they staggered under an acceleration of\nfour gravities. Space was dark for the barest instant of time, and then\nthere was the scream of atmosphere as the ship rocketed through the air\nof the planet at nearly fifteen hundred miles per second. The outer wall\nwas blazing in incandescence in a moment, and the heavy relux screens\nseemed to leap into place over the windows as the blasting heat,\nradiated from the incandescent walls flooded in. The millions of tons\npressure of the air on the nose of the ship would have brought it to a\nstop in an instant, and had it not been that the molecular drive was on\nat full power, driving the ship against the air resistance, and still\nlosing. The ship slowed swiftly, but was shrieking toward the destroyed\ncity at terrific speed.\n\n\"Hesthis--to the--right and ahead. That would be their next attack,\"\nsaid the Ortolian. Arcot altered the ship's course, and they shot toward\nthe distance city of Hesthis. They were slowing perceptibly, and yet,\nthough the city was half around the world, they reached it in half a\nminute. Now Arcot's wizardry at the controls came into play, for by\naltering his space field constants, he succeeded in reaching a condition\nthat slowed the ship almost instantly to a speed of but a mile a second,\nyet without apparent deceleration.\n\nHigh in the white Ortolian sky was a shining point bearing down on the\nnow-visible city. Arcot slanted toward it, and the approaching ship grew\nlike an expanding rubber balloon.\n\nA ray of intense, blindingly brilliant light flashed out, and a gout of\nlight appeared in the center of the city. A huge flame, bright blue,\nshot heavenward in roaring heat.\n\nSeeing that a strange ship had arrived was enough for the Thessians, and\nthey turned, and drove at Arcot instantly. The Thessian ship was built\nfor a heavy world, and for heavy acceleration in consequence, and, as\nthey had found from the captured ship, it was stronger than the _Ancient\nMariner_. Now the Thessians were driving at Arcot with an acceleration\nand speed that convinced him dodging was useless. Suddenly space was\nblack around them, the sunlit world was gone.\n\n\"Wonder what they thought of _that_!\" grinned Arcot. Wade smiled grimly.\n\n\"It's not what they thought, but what they'll do, that counts.\"\n\nArcot came back to normal space, just in time to see the Thessian ship\nspin in a quick turn, under an acceleration that would have crushed a\nhuman to a pulp. Again the pilot dived at the terrestrian ship. Again it\nvanished. Twice more he tried these fruitless tactics, seeing the ship\nloom before him--bracing for the crash--then it was gone\ninstantaneously, and though he sailed through the spot he knew it to\nhave occupied, it was not there. Yet an instant later, as he turned, it\nwas floating, unharmed, exactly where his ship had passed!\n\nRushing was useless. He stood, and prepared to give battle. A molecular\nray reached out--and disappeared in flaring ions on a shield utterly\nimpenetrable in the ionizing atmosphere.\n\nArcot meanwhile watched the instrument of his shield. The Thessian\nshield would have been impenetrable, but his shield, fed by less\nefficient tubes, was not, and he knew it. Already the terrific energy of\nthe Thessian ray was noticeably heating the copper plates of the tube.\nThe seal would break soon.\n\nAnother ray reached out, a ray of flaring light. Arcot, watching through\nthe \"eyes\" of his telectroscope viewplates, saw it for but an instant,\nthen the \"eyes\" were blasted, and the screen went blank.\n\n\"He won't do anything with that but burn out eyes,\" muttered the\nterrestrian. He pushed a small button when his instruments told him the\nrays were off. Another scanner came into action, and the viewplate was\nalive again.\n\nArcot shot out a cosmic ray himself, and swept the Thessian with it\nthoroughly. For the instant he needed the enemy ship was blinded.\nImmediately the _Ancient Mariner_ dove, and the automatic ray-finders\ncould no longer hold the rays on his ship. As soon as he was out of the\ndeadly molecular ray he shut off his screen, and turned on all his\nmolecular rays. The Thessian ship, their own ray on, had been unable to\nput up their screen, as Arcot was unable to use his ray with the enemy's\nray forcing him to cover with a shield.\n\nAlmost at once the relux covering of the Thessian ship shone with\ncharacteristic iridescence as it changed swiftly to lux metal. The\nmolecular ray blinked out, and a ray screen flashed out instead. The\nThessians were covering up. Their own rays were useless now. Though\nArcot could not hope to destroy their ray shield, they could no longer\nattack his, for their rays were useless, and already they had lost so\nmuch of the protective relux, that they would not be so foolhardy as to\nrisk a second attack of the ray.\n\nArcot continued to bathe the ship in energy, keeping their \"eyes\"\nclosed. As long as he could hold his barrage on them, they would not\ndamage him.\n\n\"Morey--get into the power room, strap onto the board. Throw all the\npower-coil banks into the magnets. I may burn them out, but I have\nhopes--\" Arcot already had the generators going full power, charging the\npower coils.\n\nMorey dived. Almost simultaneously the Thessians succeeded in the\nmaneuver they had been attempting for some time. There were a dozen rays\nflaring wildly from the ship, searching blindly over the sky and ground,\nhoping to stumble on the enemy ship, while their own ship dived and\ntwisted. Arcot was busily dodging the sweeping rays, but finally one hit\nhis viewplates, and his own ship was blind. Instantly he threw the ray\nscreen out, cutting off his own molecular ray. His own cosmics he set\nrotating in cones that covered the three dimensions--save below, where\nthe city lay. Immediately the Thessian had retreated to this one segment\nwhere Arcot did not dare throw his own rays. The Thessian cosmics\ncontinued to make his relux screens necessary, and his ship remained\nblind.\n\nHis ray screen was showing signs of weakening. The Thessians got a third\nray into position for operation, and opened up. Almost at once the tubes\nheated terrifically. In an instant they would give way. Arcot threw his\nship into space, and let the tubes cool under the water jacket. Morey\nreported the coils ready as soon as he came out of space.\n\nArcot cut in the new set of eyes, and put up his molecular ray screen\nagain. Then he cut the energy back to the coils.\n\nHalf a mile below the enemy ship was vainly scurrying around an empty\nsky. Wade laughed at the strange resemblance to a puppy chasing its\ntail. The _Ancient Mariner_ was utterly lost to them.\n\n\"Well, here goes the last trick,\" said Arcot grimly. \"If this doesn't\nwork, they'll probably win, for their tubes are better than ours, and\nthey can maneuver faster. By win I mean force us to let them attack\nOrtol. They can't really attack us; artificial space is a perfect\ndefense.\"\n\nArcot's molecular ray apprized the Thessians of his presence. Their\nscreen flared up once more. Arcot was driving straight toward their ship\nas they turned. He snapped the relux screens in front of his eyes an\ninstant before the enemy cosmics reached his ship. Immediately the thud\nof four heavy relays rang through the ship. The quarter of a million ton\nship leaped forward under a terrific acceleration, and then, as the four\nrelays cut out again, the acceleration was gone. The screen regained\nlife as Arcot opened the shutters. Before them, still directly in their\npath, was the huge Thessian ship. But now its screen was down, the relux\niridescent in decomposition. It was falling, helplessly falling to the\nrocky plateau seven miles below. Its rays reached out even yet--and\nagain the _Ancient Mariner_ staggered under the terrific pull of some\nacceleration. The Thessian ship lurched upward, and a terrific\nconcussion came, and the entire neighborhood of that projector\ndisappeared in a flash of radiation.\n\nArcot drove the _Ancient Mariner_ down beneath the Thessian ship in its\nlong fall, and with a powerful molecular beam ripped a mighty chasm in\nthe deserted plateau. The Thessian ship fell into a quarter mile rift in\nthe solid rock, smashing its way through falling d\u00e9bris. A moment later\nit was buried beneath a quarter mile of broken rock as Arcot swept a\nmolecular beam about with the grace of a mine foreman filling breaks.\n\nAn instant later, a heat ray followed the molecular in dazzling\nbrilliance. A terrific gout of light appeared in the barren rocks. In\nten minutes the plateau was a white hot cauldron of molten rocks,\nglowing now against a darkening sky. Night was falling.\n\n\"That ship,\" said Arcot with an air of finality, \"will never rise\nagain.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\nTHE SECOND MOVE\n\n\n\"What happened to him, though?\" asked Wade, bewildered. \"I haven't yet\nfigured it out. He went down in a heap, and he didn't have any power. Of\ncourse, if he had his power he could have pulled out again. He could\njust melt and burn all the excess rock off, and he would be all set. But\nhis rays all went dead. And why the explosion?\"\n\n\"The magnetic beam is the answer. In our boat we have everything\nmagnetically shielded, because of the enormous magnetic flux set up by\nthe current flowing from the storage coils to the main coil. But--with\nso many wires heavily charged with current, what would have happened if\nthey had not been shielded?\n\n\"If a current cuts across a magnetic field, a side thrust is developed.\nWhat do you suppose happened when the terrific magnetic field of the\nbeam and the currents in the wires of their power-board were mutually\nopposed?\"\n\n\"Lord, it must have ripped away everything in the ship. It'd tear loose\neven the lighting wires!\" gasped Wade in amazement.\n\n\"But if all the power of the ship was destroyed in this way, how was it\nthat one of their rays was operating as they fell?\" asked Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"Each ray is a power plant in itself,\" explained Arcot, \"and so it was\nable to function. I do not know the cause of the explosion, though it\nmight well have been that they had light-bombs such as the Kaxorians of\nVenus have,\" he added, thoughtfully.\n\nThey landed, at Zezdon's advice, in the city that their arrival had been\nable to save. This was Ortol's largest city, and their industrial\ncapital. Here, too, was the University at which Afthen taught.\n\nThey landed, and Arcot, Morey and Wade, with the aid of Zezdon Afthen\nand Zezdon Fentes worked steadily for two of their days of fifty hours\neach, teaching men how to make and use the molecular ships, and the rays\nand screens, heat beams, and relux. But Arcot promised that when he\nreturned he would have some weapon that would bring them certain and\neasy salvation. In the meantime other terrestrians would follow him.\n\nThey left the morning of their third day on the planet. A huge crowd had\ncome to cheer them on their way as they left, but it was the \"silent\ncheer\" of Ortol, a telepathic well-wishing.\n\n\"Now,\" said Arcot as their ship left the planet behind, \"we will have to\nmake the next move. It certainly looks as though that next move would be\nto the still-unknown race that lives on world 3769-37, 478, 326, 894-6.\nEvidently we will have to have some weapon they haven't, and I think\nthat I know what it will be. Thanks to our trip out to the Islands of\nSpace.\"\n\n\"Shall we go?\"\n\n\"I think it would be wise,\" agreed Morey.\n\n\"And I,\" said Wade. The Ortolians agreed, and so, with the aid of the\nphotographic copies of the Thessian charts that Arcot had made, they\nstarted for world 3769-37, 478, 326, 894-6.\n\n\"It will take approximately twenty-two hours, and as we have been\nputting off our sleep with drugs, I think that we had better catch up.\nWade, I wish you'd take the ship again, while Morey and I do a little\nconcentrated sleeping. We have by no means finished that calculation,\nand I'd very much like to. We'll relieve you in five hours.\"\n\nWade took the ship, and following the course Arcot laid out, they sped\nthrough the void at the greatest safe speed. Wade had only to watch the\nview-screen carefully, and if a star showed as growing rapidly, it was\nproof that they were near, and nearing rapidly. If large, a touch of a\nswitch, and they dodged to one side, if small, they were suddenly\nplunged into an instant of unbelievable radiation as they swept through\nit, in a different space, yet linked to it by radiation, not light, that\nwere permitted in.\n\nZezdon Afthen had elected to stay with him, which gave him an\nopportunity he had been waiting for. \"If it's none of my business, just\nsay so,\" he began. \"But that first city we saw the Thessians destroy--it\nwas Zezdon Fentes' home, wasn't it? Did he have a family?\"\n\nThe words seemed blunt as he said them, but there was no way out, once\nhe had started. And Zezdon Afthen took the question with complete calm.\n\n\"Fentes had both wives and children,\" he said quietly. \"His loss was\ngreat.\"\n\nWade concentrated on the screen for a moment, trying to absorb the\nshock. Then, fearing Zezdon Afthen might misinterpret his silence, he\nplunged on. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't realize you were\npolygamous--most people on Earth aren't, but some groups are. It's\nprobably a good way to improve the race. But ... Blast it, what bothers\nme is that Zezdon Fentes seemed to recover from the blow so quickly!\nFrom a canine race, I'd expect more affection, more loyalty, more....\"\n\nHe stopped in dismay. But Zezdon Afthen remained unperturbed. \"More\nunconcealed emotion?\" he asked. \"No. Affection and loyalty we have--they\n_are_ characteristic of our race. But affection and loyalty should not\nbe uselessly applied. To _forget_ dead wives and children--that would be\ninsulting to their memory. But to mourn them with senseless loss of\nhealth and balance would also be insulting--not only to their memory,\nbut to the entire race.\n\n\"No, we have a better way. Fentes, my very good friend, has not\nforgotten, no more than you have forgotten the death of your mother,\nwhom you loved. But you no longer mourn her death with a fear and horror\nof that natural thing, the Eternal Sleep. Time has softened the pain.\n\n\"If we can do the same in five minutes instead of five years, is it not\nbetter? That is why Fentes has _forgotten_\".\n\n\"Then you have aged his memory of that event?\" asked Wade in surprise.\n\n\"That is one way of stating it,\" replied Zezdon Afthen seriously.\n\nWade was silent for a while, absorbing this. But he could not contain\nhis curiosity completely. _Well, to hell with it_, he decided.\n_Conventional manners and tact don't have much meaning between two\ndifferent races_. \"Are you--married?\" he asked.\n\n\"Only three times,\" Zezdon Afthen told him blandly. \"And to forestall\nyour next question--no, our system does not create problems. At least,\nnot those you're thinking of. I know my wives have never had the jealous\nquarrels I see in your mind pictures.\"\n\n\"It isn't safe thinking things around you,\" laughed Wade. \"Just the\nsame, all of this has made me even more interested in the 'Ancient\nMasters' you keep mentioning. Who were they?\"\n\n\"The Ancient Ones,\" began Zezdon Afthen slowly, \"were men such as you\nare. They descended from a primeval omnivorous mammal very closely\nrelated to your race. Evidently the tendency of evolution on any planet\nis approximately the same with given conditions.\n\n\"The race existed as a distinct branch for approximately 1,500,000 of\nyour years before any noticeable culture was developed. Then it existed\nfor a total of 1,525,000 years before extinction. With culture and\nlearning they developed such marvelous means of killing themselves that\nin twenty-five thousand years they succeeded perfectly. Ten thousand\nyears of barbaric culture--I need not relate it to you, five thousand\nyears of the medieval culture, then five thousand years of developed\nscience culture.\n\n\"They learned to fly through space and nearly populated three worlds;\ntwo were fully populated, one was still under colonization when the\ngreat war broke out. An interplanetary war is not a long drawn out\nstruggle. The science of any people so far advanced as to have\ninterplanetary lines is too far developed to permit any long duration of\nwar. Selto declared war, and made the first move. They attacked and\ndestroyed the largest city of Ortol of that time. Ortolian ships drove\nthem off, and in turn attacked Selto's largest city. Twenty million\nintelligences, twenty million lives, each with its aims, its hopes, its\nloves and its strivings--gone in four days.\n\n\"The war continued to get more and more hateful, till it became evident\nthat neither side would be pacified till the other was totally\nsubjugated. So each laid his plans, and laid them to wipe out the entire\nworld of the other.\n\n\"Ortol developed a ray of light that made things not happen,\" explained\nZezdon Afthen, his confused thoughts clearly indicating his own\nuncertainty.\n\n\"'A ray of light that made things not happen,'\" repeated Wade curiously.\n\"A ray, which prevented things, which caused processes to stop--_The\nNegrian Death Ray_!\" he exclaimed as he suddenly recognized, in this\ncrude and garbled description of its powers, the Negrian ray of\nanti-catalysis, a ray which tended to stop the processes of life's\nchemistry and bring instant, painless death.\n\n\"Ah, you know it, too?\" asked the Ortolian eagerly. \"Then you will\nunderstand what happened. The ray was turned first on Selto, and as the\nwhirling planet spun under it, every square foot of it was wiped clean\nof every living thing, from gigantic Welsthan to microscopic Ascoptel,\nand every man, woman and child was killed, painlessly, but instantly.\n\n\"Then Thenten spun under it, and all were killed, but many who had fled\nthe planets were still safe--many?--a few thousand.\n\n\"The day that Thenten spun under that ray, men of Ortol began to\ncomplain of disease--men by the thousands, hundreds of thousands. Every\nman, every woman, every child was afflicted in some way. The diseases\ndid not seem all the same. Some seemingly died of a disease of the\nlungs, some went insane, some were paralyzed, and lay helplessly\ninactive. But most of them were afflicted, for it was exceedingly\nvirulent, and the normal serums were helpless. Before any quantity of\nnew serum was made, all but a slender remnant had died, either of\nstarvation through paralysis, none being left to care for them, or from\nthe disease itself, while thousands who had gone mad were painlessly\nkilled.\n\n\"The Seltonians came to Ortol, and the remaining Ortolians, with their\naid, tried to rebuild the civilization. But what a sorry thing! The\ncities were gigantic, stinking, plague-ridden morgues. And the plague\nbroke among those few remaining people. The Ortolians had done\neverything in their power with the serums--but too late. The Seltonians\nhad been protected with it on landing--but even that was not enough.\nAgain the wild fires of that loathsome disease broke out.\n\n\"Since first those men had developed from their hairy forebears, they\nhad found their eternal friends were the dogs, and to them they turned\nin their last extremity, breeding them for intelligence, hairlessness,\nand resemblance to themselves. The Deathless ones alone remained after\nthree generations of my people, but with the aid of certain rays, the\nrays capable of penetrating lead for a short distance, and most other\nsubstances for considerable distances.\" X-rays, thought Wade. \"Great\nchanges had been wrought. Already they had developed startling\nintelligence, and were able to understand the scheme of their Masters.\nTheir feet and hands were being modified rapidly, and their vocal\napparatus was changing. Their jaws shortened, their chins developed, the\nnose retreated.\n\n\"Generation after generation the process went on, while the Deathless\nAncient Ones worked with their helpers, for soon my race was a real\nhelping organization.\n\n\"But it was done. The successful arousing of true love-emotion followed,\nand the unhappy days were gone. Quickly development followed. In five\nthousand years the new race had outstripped the Ancient Masters, and\nthey passed, voluntarily, willingly joining in oblivion the millions who\nhad died before.\n\n\"Since then our own race has risen, it has been but a short thousand\nyears, a thousand years of work, and hope, and continuous improvement\nfor us, continual accomplishment on which we can look, and a living hope\nto which we could look with raised heads, and smiling faces.\n\n\"Then our hope died, as this menace came. Do you see what you and your\nworld was meant to us, Man of Earth?\" Zezdon Afthen raised his dark eyes\nto the terrestrian with a look in their depths that made Wade\ninvoluntarily resolve that Thet and all Thessians should be promptly\nconsigned to that limbo of forgotten things where they belonged.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\nWORLD 3769-37,478,326,894,6, TALSO\n\n\nWade sat staring moodily at the screen for some time, while Zezdon\nAfthen, sunk in his own reveries, continued.\n\n\"Our race was too highly psychic, and too little mechanically curious.\nWe learned too little of the world about, and too much of our own\nprocesses. We are a peaceful race, for, while you and the Ancient\nMasters learned the rule of existence in a world of strife, where only\nthe fittest, the best fighters survived, we learned life in a carefully\ntended world, where the Ancient Masters taught us to live, where the one\nwhose social instincts were best developed, where he who would most help\nthe others, and the race, was permitted to live. Is it not natural that\nour race will not fight among themselves? We are careful to suppress\ntendencies toward criminality and struggle. The criminal and the maniac,\nor those who are permanently incurable as determined by careful\nexamination, are 'removed' as the Leaders put it. Lethal gas.\n\n\"At any rate, we know so pitiably little of natural science. We were\nhopelessly helpless against an attacking science.\"\n\n\"I promise you, Afthen, that if Earth survives, Ortol shall survive, for\nwe have given you all the weapons we know of and we will give your\npeople all the weapons we shall learn of.\" Morey spoke from the doorway.\nArcot was directly behind him.\n\nThey talked for a short while, then Wade retired for some needed sleep,\nwhile Morey and Arcot started further work on the time fields.\n\nHour after hour the ship sped on through the dark of space, weirdly\ndistorted, glowing spots of light before them, wheeling suns that moved\nand flashed as their awesome speed whirled them on.\n\nThey had to move slower soon, as the changing stars showed them near the\nspace-marks of certain locating suns. Finally, still moving close to\nfifteen thousand miles per second, they saw the sun they knew was sun\n3769-37,478,-326,894, twice as large as Sol, two and a half times as\nmassive and twenty-six times as brilliant.\n\nThirteen major planets they counted as they searched the system with\ntheir powerful telectroscope, the outermost more than ten billion miles\nfrom the parent sun, while planet six, the one indicated by the world\nnumber, was at a distance of five hundred million miles, nearly as far\nfrom the sun as Jupiter is from ours, yet the giant sun, giving more\nthan twenty-five times as much heat and light in the blue-white range,\nheated the planet to approximately the same temperature Earth enjoys.\nSpectroscopy showed that the atmosphere was well supplied with oxygen,\nand so the inhabitants were evidently oxygen-breathing men, unlike those\nof the Negrian people who live in an atmosphere of hydrogen.\n\nArcot threw the ship toward the planet, and as it loomed swiftly larger,\nhe shut off the space-control, and set the coils for full charge, while\nthe ship entered the planet's atmosphere in a screaming dive, still at a\nspeed of better than a hundred miles a second. But this speed was\nquickly damped as the ship shot high over broad oceans to the dull green\nof land ahead in the daylit zone. Observations made from various\ndistances by means of the space-control, thus going back in time, show\nthat the planet had a day of approximately forty hours, the diameter was\nnearly nine thousand miles, which would probably mean an inconveniently\nhigh gravity for the terrestrians and a distressingly high gravity for\nthe Ortolians, used to their world even smaller than Earth, with\nscarcely 80 percent of Earth's gravity.\n\nWade made some volumetric analysis of the atmosphere, and with the aid\nof a mouse, pronounced it \"Q.A.R.\" (quite all right) for human beings.\nIt had not killed the mouse, so probably humans would find it quite all\nright.\n\n\"We'll land at the first city that comes into view,\" suggested Arcot.\n\"Afthen, you be the spokesman; you have a very considerable ability with\nthe mental communication, and have a better understanding of the physics\nwe need to explain than has Zezdon Fentes.\"\n\nThey were over land, a rocky coast that shot behind them as great jagged\nmountains, tipped with snow, rose beneath. Suddenly, a shining\napparition appeared from behind one of the neighboring hills, and drove\ndown at them with an unearthly acceleration. Arcot moved just enough to\ndodge the blow, and turned to meet the ship. Instantly, now that he had\na good view of it he was certain it was a Thessian ship. Waiting no\nlonger to determine that it was not a ship of this world, he shot a\nmolecular beam at it. The beam exploded into a coruscating panoply of\npyrotechnics on the Thessian shield. The Thessian replied with all beams\nhe had available, including an induction-beam, an intensely brilliant\nlight-beam, and several molecular cannons with shells loaded with an\nexplosive that was very evidently condensed light. This was no\nexploration ship, but a full-fledged battleship.\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ was blinded instantly. None of the occupants were\nhurt, but the combined pressure of the various beams hurled the ship to\none side. The induction beam alone was dangerous. It passed through the\nouter lux-metal wall unhindered, and the perfectly conducting relux wall\nabsorbed it, and turned it into power. At once, all the metal objects in\nthe ship began to heat up with terrific rapidity. Since there were no\nmetallic conductors on the ship, no damage was done.\n\nArcot immediately hid behind his perfect shield--the space-distortion.\n\n\"That's no mild dose,\" he said in a tense voice, working rapidly. \"He's\na real-for-sure battleship. Better get down in the power room, Morey.\"\n\nIn a few moments the ship was ready again. Opening the shield somewhat,\nArcot was able to determine that no rays were being played on it, for no\nenergy fields disclosed as distorting the opened field, other than the\nfield of the sun and planet.\n\nArcot opened it. The battleship was searching vainly about the\nmountains, and was now some miles distant. His last view of Arcot's ship\nhad been a suddenly contracting ship, one that vanished in infinite\ndistance, the infinite distance of another space, though he did not know\nit.\n\nArcot turned three powerful heat beams on the Thessian ship, and drove\ndown toward it, accompanying them with molecular rays. The Thessian\nshield stopped the moleculars, but the heat had already destroyed the\neyes of the ship. By some system of magnetic or electrostatic locating\ndevices, the enemy guns and rays replied, and so successfully that Arcot\nwas again blinded.\n\nHe had again been driving in a line straight toward the enemy, and now\nhe threw in the entire power of his huge magnetic field-rays. The\ninduction ray disappeared, and the heat, light and cannons stopped.\n\n\"Worked again,\" grinned Arcot. A new set of eyes was inserted\nautomatically, and the screen again lighted. The Thessian ship was\nspinning end over end toward the ground. It landed with a tremendous\ncrash. Simultaneously from the rear of the _Ancient Mariner_ came a\nterrific crash, an explosion that drove the terrestrian ship forward, as\nthough a giant hand had pushed it from behind.\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ spun like a top, facing the direction of the\nexplosion, though still traveling in the direction it had been pursuing,\nbut backward now. Behind them the air was a gigantic pool of ionization.\nTremendous fragments of what obviously had been a ship were drifting\ndown, turning end over end. And those fragments of the wall showed them\nto be fully four feet of solid relux.\n\n\"Enemy got up behind somehow while the eyes were out, and was ready to\nraise merry hell. Somebody blew them up beautifully. Look at the ground\ndown there--it's red hot. That's from the radiated heat of our recent\nencounter. Heat rays reflected, light bombs turned off, heat escaping\nfrom ions--nice little workout--and it didn't seriously bother our\ndefenses of two-inch relux. Now tell me: what will blow up four-foot\nrelux?\" asked Arcot, looking at the fragments. \"It seems to me those\nfellows don't need any help from us; they may decline it with thanks.\"\n\n\"But they may be willing to help us,\" replied Afthen, \"and we certainly\nneed such help.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect to come out alive from that battleship there. It was\nluck. If they knew what we had, they could insulate against it in an\nhour,\" added Arcot.\n\n\"Let's finish those fellows over there--look!\" From the wreck of the\nship they had downed, a stream of men in glistening relux suits were\nfiling. Any men comparable to humans would have been killed by the fall,\nbut not Thessians. They carried peculiar machines, and as they drove out\nof the ship in dive that looked as though they had been shot from a\ncannon, they turned and landed on the ground and proceeded to jump back,\nleaping at a speed that was bewildering, seemingly impossible in any\nliving creature.\n\nThey busied themselves quickly. It took less than thirty seconds, and\nthey had a large relux disc laid under the entire group and machines.\nArcot turned a molecular ray down. The rock and soil shot up all about\nthem, even the ship shot up, to fall back into the great pit its ray had\nformed. But the ionization told of the ray shield over the little group\nof men. A heat ray reached down, while the men still frantically worked\nat their stubby projectors. The relux disc now showed its purpose. In an\ninstant the soil about them was white hot, bubbling lava. It was liquid,\nboiling furiously. But the deep relux disc simply floated on it. The\nenemy ship began sinking, and in a moment had fallen almost completely\nbeneath the white hot rock.\n\nA fountain of the melted lava sprung up, and under Arcot's skillful\ndirection, fell in a cloud of molten rock on the men working. The suits\nprotected, and the white hot stuff simply rolled off. But it was sinking\ntheir boat. Arcot continued hopefully.\n\nMeanwhile a signaling machine was frantically calling for help and\nsending out information of their plight and position.\n\nThen all was instantly wiped out in a single terrific jolt of the\nmagnetic beam. The machines jumped a little, despite their weight, and\nthe ray shield apparatus slumped suddenly in blazing white heat, the\ninterior mechanism fused. But the men were still active, and rapidly\nspreading from the spot, each protected by a ray shield pack.\n\nA brilliant stab of molecular ray shot at each from either of two of the\n_Ancient Mariner'_s projectors as Morey aided Arcot. Their little packs\nflared brilliantly for an instant under the thousands of horsepower of\nenergy lashing at the screen, then flashed away, and the opalescent\nrelux yielded a moment later, and the figure went twisting, hurtling\naway. Meanwhile Wade was busy with the magnetic apparatus, destroying\nshield after shield, which either Arcot or Morey picked off. The fall\nfrom even so much as half a mile seemed not sufficient to seriously\nbother these supermen, for an instant later they would be up tearing\naway in great leaps on their own power as their molecular suits, blown\nout by the magnetic field, failed them.\n\nIt was but a matter of minutes before the last had been chased down\neither by the rays or the ship. Then, circling back, Arcot slowly\nsettled beside the enemy ship.\n\n\"Wait,\" called Arcot sharply as Morey started for the door.\n\n\"Don't go out yet. The friends who wrecked that little sweetheart who\ncrept up behind will probably show up. Wait and see what happens.\"\nHardly had he spoken, when a strange apparition rose from behind a rock\nscarcely a quarter of a mile away. Immediately Arcot intensified the\nvision screen covering him. He seemed to leap near. There was one man,\nand he held what was obviously a sword by the blade, above his head,\nwaving it from side to side.\n\n\"There they are--whatever they are. Intelligent all right--what more\nuniversally obvious peace sign than a primitive weapon such as a knife\nheld in reverse position? You go with Zezdon Afthen. Try holding a\ncarving knife by the blade.\"\n\nMorey grinned as he got into his power suit, on Wade's O.K. of the\natmosphere. \"They may mistake me for the cook out looking for dinner,\nand I wouldn't risk my dignity that way. I'll take the baseball bat and\nhold it wrong way instead.\"\n\nNevertheless, as he stepped from the ship, with Afthen close behind, he\nheld the long knife by the blade, and Afthen, very awkwardly operating\nhis still rather unfamiliar power suit, followed.\n\nInto the intensely blue sunlight the men stepped. Their skin and\nclothing took on a peculiar tint under the strange sunlight.\n\nThe single stranger was joined by a second, also holding a reversed\nweapon, and together they threw them down. Morey and Zezdon Afthen\nfollowed suit. The two parties advanced toward each other.\n\nThe strangers advanced with a swift, light step, jumping from rock to\nrock, while Morey and Afthen flew part way toward them. The men of this\nworld were totally unlike any intelligent race Morey had conceived of.\nTheir head and brain case was so small as to be almost animalish. The\nnose was small and well formed, the ears more or less cup-shaped with a\nremarkable power of motion. Their eyes were seemingly huge, probably no\nlarger than a terrestrian's, though in the tiny head they were\nnecessarily closely placed, protected by heavy bony ridges that actually\nprojected from the skull to enclose them. Tiny, childlike chins\ncompleted the head, running down to a scrawny neck.\n\nThey were short, scarcely five feet, yet evidently of tremendous\nstrength for their short, heavy arms, the muscle bulging plainly under\nthe tight rubber-like composition garments, and the short legs whose\nstocky girth proclaimed equal strength were members of a body in keeping\nwith them. The deep, broad chest, wide, square shoulders, heavy broad\nhips, combined with the tiny head seemed to indicate a perfect\nincarnation of brainless, brute strength.\n\n\"Strangers from another planet, enemies of our enemies. What brings you\nhere at this time of troubles?\" The thoughts came clearly from the\nstocky individual before them.\n\n\"We seek to aid, and to find aid. The menace that you face, attacks not\nalone your world, but all this star cluster,\" replied Zezdon Afthen\nsteadily.\n\nThe stranger shook his head with an evident expression of hopelessness.\n\"The menace is even greater than we feared. It was just fortune that\npermitted us to have our weapon in workable condition at the time your\nship was attacked. It will be a day before the machine will again be\ncapable of successful operation. When in condition for use, it is\ninvincible, but--one blow in thirty hours--you can see we are not of\ngreat aid.\" He shrugged.\n\nAn enemy with evident resources of tremendous power, deadly, unknown\nrays that wiped out entire cities with a single brief sweep--and no\ndefense save this single weapon, good but once a day! Morey could read\nthe utter despair of the man.\n\n\"What is the difficulty?\" asked Morey eagerly.\n\n\"Power, lack of power. Our cities are going without power, while every\nelectric generator on the planet is pouring its output into the\naccumulators that work these damnable, hopeless things. Invincible with\npower--helpless without.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Morey's face shone with delight--invincible weapon--with power.\nAnd the _Ancient Mariner_ could generate unthinkable power.\n\n\"What power source do you use--how do you generate your power?\"\n\n\"Combining oxidizing agent with reducing agents releases heat. Heat used\nto boil liquid and the vapor runs turbines.\"\n\n\"We can give you power. What wattage have you available?\"\n\nOnly Morey's thoughts had to translate \"watts\" to \"How many man-weights\ncan you lift through your height per time interval, equal to this.\" He\ngave the man some impression of a second, by counting. The man figured\nrapidly. His answer indicated that approximately a total of two billion\nkilowatts were available.\n\n\"Then the weapon is invincible hereafter, if what you say is true. Our\nship alone can easily generate ten thousand times that power.\n\n\"Come, get in the ship, accompany us to your capital.\"\n\nThe men turned, and retreated to their position behind the rocks, while\nMorey and Zezdon Afthen waited for them. Soon they returned, and entered\nthe ship.\n\n\"Our world,\" explained the leader rapidly, \"is a single unified colony.\nThe capital is 'Shesto,' our world we call 'Talso.'\" His directions were\nexplicit, and Arcot started for Shesto, on Talso.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\nUNDEFEATABLE OR UNCONTROLLABLE?\n\n\nFifteen minutes after they started, they came to Shesto. They were\nforced to land, and explain, for their relux ship was decidedly not the\npopular Talsonian idea of a life-saver.\n\nShesto was defended by two of the machines, and each machine had been\nequipped with two fully charged accumulators. Their four possible shots\nwere hoped to be sufficient protection, and, so far, had been. The city\nhad been attacked twice, according to Tho Stan Drel, the Talsonian: once\nby a single ship which had been instantly destroyed, and once by a fleet\nof six ships. The interval had permitted time to recharge the discharged\naccumulator, and the fleet had been badly treated. Of the six ships,\nfour had been brought down in rapid succession, and the remaining two\nships had fled.\n\nWhen the first city had been wiped out, with a loss of life well in the\nhundreds of thousands, the other cities had, to limit of their\nabilities, set up the protective apparatus. Apparently the Thessians\nwere holding off for the present.\n\n\"In a way,\" said Morey seriously, \"it was distinctly fortunate that we\nwere attacked almost at once. Their instantaneous system of destruction\nwould have worked for the one shot needed to send the _Ancient Mariner_\nto eternal blazes.\" He laughed, but it was a slightly nervous laugh.\n\nThe terrestrial ship landed in a great grassy court, and out of respect\nfor the parklike smoothness of the turf, Arcot left the ship on its\npower units, suspended a bit above the surface. Then he, Morey and the\nTalsonian left the ship. Zezdon Afthen was left with the ship and with\nWade in charge, for if some difficulties were encountered, Wade would be\nable to help them with the ship, and Zezdon Afthen with the tremendous\npower of his thought locating apparatus, was busy seeking out the\nThessian stronghold.\n\nA party of men of Talso met the terrestrians outside the ship.\n\n\"Welcome, Men of another world, and to you go our thanks for the\ndestruction of one of our enemies.\" The clear thoughts of the spokesman\nevinced his ability to concentrate.\n\n\"And to your world must go our thanks for saving of our lives, and more\nimportant, our ship,\" replied Arcot. \"For the ship represents a thing of\nenormous value to this entire star-system.\"\n\n\"I see--understand--your--thoughts that you wish to learn more of this\nweapon we use. You understand that it is a question among us as to\nwhether it is undefeatable, uncontrollable or just un-understandable. We\nhave had fair success with it. It is not a weapon, was not developed as\nsuch; it was an experiment in the line of electric-waves. How it works,\nwhat it is, what happens--we do not know.\n\n\"But men who can create so marvelous a ship as this of yours, capable of\ndestroying a ship of the Thessians with their own weapons must certainly\nbe able to understand any machine we may make--and you have power?\" he\nfinished eagerly.\n\n\"Practically infinite power. I will throw into any power line you\nsuggest, all the direct current you wish.\" Arcot's thoughts were pure\nreflection, but the Talsonian brightened at once.\n\n\"I feared it might be alternating--but we can handle direct current. All\nour transmission is done at high voltage direct current. What potential\ndo you generate? Will we have to install changers?\"\n\n\"We generate D.C. at any voltage up to fifty million, any power up to\nthat needed to lift ten trillion men through their own height in this\ntime a second.\" The power represented approximately twenty trillion\nhorsepower.\n\nThe Talsonian's face went blank with amazement as he looked at the ship.\n\"In that tiny thing you generate such power?\" he asked in amazement.\n\n\"In that tiny ship we generate more than one million times that power,\"\nArcot said.\n\n\"Our power troubles are over,\" declared the military man emphatically.\n\n\"Our troubles are not over,\" replied a civilian who had joined the\nparty, with equal emphasis. \"As a matter of fact, they are worse than\never. More tantalizing. What he says means that we have a tremendous\npower source, but it is in one spot. How are you going to transmit the\npower? We can't possibly move any power anywhere near that amount. We\ncouldn't touch it to our lines without having them all go up in one\ninstantaneous blaze of glory.\n\n\"We cannot drain such a lake of power through our tiny power pipes of\nsilver.\"\n\n\"This man is Stel Felso Theu,\" said Tho Stan Drel. \"The greatest of our\nscientists, the man who has invented this weapon which alone seems to\noffer us hope. And I am afraid he is right. See, there is the\nUniversity. For the power requirements of their laboratories, a heavy\npower line has been installed, and it was hoped that you could carry\nleads into it.\" His face showed evident despair greater than ever.\n\n\"We can always feed some power into the lines. Let us see just what hope\nthere is. I think that it would be wiser to investigate the power lines\nat once,\" suggested Morey.\n\nTen minutes later, with but a single officer now accompanying them, Tho\nStan Drel, the terrestrial scientist, and the Talsonian scientist were\ninspecting the power installation.\n\nThey had entered a large stone building, into which led numerous very\nheavy silver wires. The insulators were silicate glass. Their height\nsuggested a voltage of well over one hundred thousand, and such heavy\ncables suggested a very heavy amperage, so that a tremendous load was\nexpected.\n\nWithin the building were a series of gigantic glass tubes, their walls\nfully three inches thick, and even so, braced with heavy platinum rods.\nInside the tubes were tremendous elements such as the tiny tubes of\ntheir machine carried. Great cables led into them, and now their heating\ncoils were glowing a somberly deep red.\n\nAlong the walls were the switchboards, dozens of them, all sizes, all\ntypes of instruments, strange to the eyes of the terrestrians, and in\npractically all the light-beam indicator system was used, no metallic\npointers, but tiny mirrors directing a very fine line of brilliant light\nacted as a needle. The system thus had practically no inertia.\n\n\"Are these the changers?\" asked Arcot gazing at the gigantic tubes.\n\n\"They are; each tube will handle up to a hundred thousand volts,\" said\nStel Felso Theu.\n\n\"But I fear, Stel Felso Theu, that these tubes will carry power only one\nway; that is, it would be impossible for power to be pumped from here\ninto the power house, though the process can be reversed,\" pointed out\nArcot. \"Radio tubes work only one way, which is why they can act as\nrectifiers. The same was true of these tubes. They could carry power one\nway only.\"\n\n\"True, of tubes in general,\" replied the Talsonian, \"and I see by that\nthat you know the entire theory of our tubes, which is rather abstruse.\"\n\n\"We use them on the ship, in special form,\" interrupted Arcot.\n\n\"Then I will only say that the college here has a very complete electric\npower plant of its own. On special occasions, the power generated here\nis needed by the city, and so we arranged the tubes with switches which\ncould reverse the flow. At present they are operating to pour power into\nthe city.\n\n\"If your ship can generate such tremendous power, I suspect that it\nwould be wiser to eliminate the tubes from the circuit, for they put\ncertain restrictions on the line. The main power plant in the city has\ntube banks capable of handling anything the line would. I suggest that\nyour voltage be set at the maximum that the line will carry without\nbreakdown, and the amperage can be made as high as possible without heat\nloss.\"\n\n\"Good enough. The line to the city power will stand what pressure?\"\n\n\"It is good for the maximum of these tubes,\" replied the Talsonian.\n\n\"Then get into communication with the city plant and tell them to\nprepare for every work-unit they can carry. I'll get the generator.\"\nArcot turned, and flew on his power suit to the ship.\n\nIn a few moments he was back, a molecular pistol in one hand, and\nsuspended in front of him on nothing but a ray of ionized air, to all\nappearances, a cylindrical apparatus, with a small cubical base.\n\nThe cylinder was about four feet long, and the cubical box about\neighteen inches on a side.\n\n\"What is that, and what supports it?\" asked the Talsonian scientists in\nsurprise.\n\n\"The thing is supported by a ray which directs the molecules of a small\nbar in the top clamp, driving it up,\" explained Morey, \"and that is the\ngenerator.\"\n\n\"That! Why it is hardly as big as a man!\" exclaimed the Talsonian.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it can generate a billion horsepower. But you couldn't\nget the power away if you did generate it.\" He turned toward Arcot, and\ncalled to him.\n\n\"Arcot--set it down and let her rip on about half a million horsepower\nfor a second or so. Air arc. Won't hurt it--she's made of lux and\nrelux.\"\n\nArcot grinned, and set it on the ground. \"Make an awful hole in the\nground.\"\n\n\"Oh--go ahead. It will satisfy this fellow, I think,\" replied Morey.\n\nArcot pulled a very thin lux metal cord from his pocket, and attached\none end of a long loop to one tiny switch, and the other to a second.\nThen he adjusted three small dials. The wire in hand, he retreated to a\ndistance of nearly two hundred feet, while Morey warned the Talsonians\nback. Arcot pulled one end of his cord.\n\nInstantly a terrific roar nearly deafened the men, a solid sheet of\nblinding flame reached in a flaming cone into the air for nearly fifty\nfeet. The screeching roar continued for a moment, then the heat was so\nintense that Arcot could stand no more, and pulled the cord. The flame\ndied instantly, though a slight ionization clung briefly. In a moment it\nhad cooled to white, and was cooling slowly through orange--red\ndeep--red--\n\nThe grass for thirty feet about was gone, the soil for ten feet about\nwas molten, boiling. The machine itself was in a little crater, half\nsunk in boiling rock. The Talsonians stared in amazement. Then a sort of\nsigh escaped them and they started forward. Arcot raised his molecular\npistol, a blue green ray reached out, and the rock suddenly was black.\nIt settled swiftly down, and a slight depression was the only evidence\nof the terrific action.\n\nArcot walked over the now cool rock, cooled by the action of the\nmolecular ray. In driving the molecules downward, the work was done by\nthe heat of these molecules. The machine was frozen in the solid lava.\n\n\"Brilliant idea, Morey,\" said Arcot disgustedly. \"It'll be a nice job\nbreaking it loose.\"\n\nMorey stuck the lux metal bar in the top clamp, walked off some\ndistance, and snapped on the power. The rock immediately about the\nmachine was molten again. A touch of the molecular pistol to the lux\nmetal bar, and the machine jumped free of the molten rock.\n\nMorey shut off the power. The machine was perfectly clean, and extremely\nhot.\n\n\"And your ship is made of that stuff!\" exclaimed the Talsonian\nscientist. \"What will destroy it?\"\n\n\"Your weapon will, apparently.\"\n\n\"But do you believe that we have power enough?\" asked Morey with a\nsmile.\n\n\"No--it's entirely too much. Can you tone that condensed lightning bolt\ndown to a workable level?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nTHE IRRESISTIBLE AND THE IMMOVABLE\n\n\nThe generator Arcot had brought was one of the two spare generators used\nfor laboratory work. He took it now into the sub-station, and directed\nthe Talsonian students and the scientist in the task of connecting it\ninto the lines; though they knew where it belonged, he knew _how_ it\nbelonged.\n\nThen the terrestrian turned on the power, and gradually increased it\nuntil the power authorities were afraid of breakdowns. The accumulators\nwere charged in the city, and the power was being shipped to other\ncities whose accumulators were not completely charged.\n\nBut, after giving simple operating instructions to the students, Arcot\nand Morey went with Stel Felso Theu to his laboratory.\n\n\"Here,\" Stel Felso Theu explained, \"is the original apparatus. All these\nother machines you see are but replicas of this. How it works, why it\nworks, even what it does, I am not sure of. Perhaps you will understand\nit. The thing is fully charged now, for it is, in part, one of the\ndefenses of the city. Examine it now, and then I will show its power.\"\n\nArcot looked it over in silence, following the great silver leads with\nkeen interest. Finally he straightened, and returned to the Talsonian.\nIn a moment Morey joined them.\n\nThe Talsonian then threw a switch, and an intense ionization appeared\nwithin the tube, then a minute spot of light was visible within the\nsphere of light. The minute spot of radiance is the real secret of the\nweapon. The ball of fire around it is merely wasted energy.\n\n\"Now I will bring it out of the tube.\" There were three dials on the\ncontrol panel from which he worked, and now he adjusted one of these.\nThe ball of fire moved steadily toward the glass wall of the tube, and\nwith a crash the glass exploded inward. It had been highly evacuated.\nInstantly the tiny ball of fire about the point of light expanded to a\nlarge globe.\n\n\"It is now in the outer air. We make the--thing, in an evacuated glass\ntube, but as they are cheap, it is not an expensive procedure. The ball\nwill last in its present condition for approximately three hours. Feel\nthe exceedingly intense heat? It is radiating away its vast energy.\n\n\"Now here is the point of greatest interest.\" Again the Talsonian fell\nto work on his dials, watching the ball of fire. It seemed far more\nbrilliant in the air now. It moved, and headed toward a great slab of\nsteel off to one side of the laboratory. It shifted about until it was\ndirectly over the center of the great slab. The slab rested on a scale\nof some sort, and as the ball of fire touched it, the scale showed a\nsudden increase in load. The ball sank into the slab of steel, and the\nscale showed a steady, enormous load. Evidently the little ball was\npressing its way through as though it were a solid body. In a moment it\nwas through the steel slab, and out on the other side.\n\n\"It will pass through any body with equal ease. It seems to answer only\nthese controls, and these it answers perfectly, and without difficulty.\n\n\"One other thing we can do with it. I can increase its rate of energy\ndischarge.\"\n\nThe Talsonian turned a fourth dial, well off to one side, and the\nbrilliance of the spot increased enormously. The heat was unbearable.\nAlmost at once he shut it off.\n\n\"That is the principle we use in making it a weapon. Watch the actual\noperation.\"\n\nThe ball of fire shot toward an open window, out the window, and\nvanished in the sky above. The Talsonian stopped the rotation of the\ndials. \"It is motionless now, but scarcely visible. I will now release\nall the energy.\" He twirled the fourth dial, and instantly there was a\nflash of light, and a moment later a terrific concussion.\n\n\"It is gone.\" He left the controls, and went over to his apparatus. He\nset a heavy silver bladed switch, and placed a new tube in the\napparatus. A second switch arced a bit as he drove it home. \"Your\ngenerator is recharging the accumulators.\"\n\nStel Felso Theu took the backplate of the control cabinet off, and the\nterrestrians looked at the control with interest.\n\n\"Got it, Morey?\" asked Arcot after a time.\n\n\"Think so. Want to try making it up? We can do so out of spare junk\nabout the ship, I think. We won't need the tube if what I believe of it\nis true.\"\n\nArcot turned to the Talsonian. \"We wish you to accompany us to the ship.\nWe have apparatus there which we wish to set up.\"\n\nBack to the ship they went. There Arcot, Morey and Wade worked rapidly.\n\nIt was about three-quarters of an hour later when Arcot and his friends\ncalled the others to the laboratory. They had a maze of apparatus on the\npower bench, and the shining relux conductors ran all over the ship\napparently. One huge bar ran into the power room itself, and plugged\ninto the huge power-coil power supply.\n\nThey were still working at it, but looked up as the others entered.\n\"Guess it will work,\" said Arcot with a grin.\n\nThere were four dials, and three huge switches. Arcot set all four\ndials, and threw one of the switches. Then he started slowly turning the\nfourth dial. In the center of the room a dim, shining mist a foot in\ndiameter began to appear. It condensed, solidified without shrinking, a\nsolid ball of matter a foot in diameter. It seemed black, but was a\nperfectly reflective surface--and luminous!\n\n\"Then--then you had already known of this thing? Then why did you not\ntell me when I tried to show it?\" demanded the Talsonian.\n\nArcot was sending the globe, now perfectly non-luminous, about the room.\nIt flattened out suddenly, and was a disc. He tossed a small weight on\nit, and it remained fixed, but began to radiate slightly. Arcot\nreadjusted his dials, and it ceased radiating, held perfectly\nmotionless. The sphere returned, and the weight dropped to the floor.\nArcot maneuvered it about for a moment more. Then he placed his friends\nbehind a screen of relux, and increased the radiation of the globe\ntremendously. The heat became intense, and he stopped the radiation.\n\n\"No, Stel Felso Theu, we do not have this on our world,\" Arcot said.\n\n\"You do not have it! You look at my apparatus fifteen minutes, and then\nwork for an hour--and you have apparatus far more effective than ours,\nwhich required years of development!\" exclaimed the Talsonian.\n\n\"Ah, but it was not wholly new to me. This ship is driven by curving\nspace into peculiar coordinates. Even so, we didn't do such a hot job,\ndid we, Morey?\"\n\n\"No, we should have--\"\n\n\"What--it was not a good job?\" interrupted the Talsonian. \"You succeeded\nin creating it in air--in making it stop radiating, in making a ball a\nfoot in diameter, made it change to a disc, made it carry a load--what\ndo you want?\"\n\n\"We want the full possibilities, the only thing that can save us in this\nwar,\" Morey said.\n\n\"What you learned how to do was the reverse of the process we learned.\nHow you did it is a wonder--but you did. Very well--matter is\nenergy--does your physics know that?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"It does; matter contains vast energy,\" replied the Talsonian.\n\n\"Matter has mass, and energy because of that! Mass _is_ energy. Energy\nin any known form is a field of force in space. So matter is ordinarily\na combination of magnetic, electrostatic and gravitational fields. Your\napparatus combined the three, and put them together. The result\nwas--matter!\n\n\"You created matter. We can destroy it but we cannot create it.\n\n\"What we ordinarily call matter is just a marker, a sign that there are\nthose energy-fields. Each bit is surrounded by a gravitational field.\nThe bit is just the marker of that gravitational field.\n\n\"But that seems to be wrong. This artificial matter of yours seems also\na sort of knot, for you make all three fields, combine them, and have\nthe matter, but not, very apparently, like normal matter. Normal matter\nalso holds the fields that make it. The artificial matter is surrounded\nby the right fields, but it is evidently not able to hold the fields, as\nnormal matter does. That was why your matter continually disintegrated\nto ordinary energy. The energy was not bound properly.\n\n\"But the reason why it would blow up so was obvious. It did not take\nmuch to destroy the slight hold that the artificial matter had on its\nfield, and then it instantly proceeded to release all its energy at\nonce. And as you poured millions of horsepower into it all day to fill\nit, it naturally raised merry hell when it let loose.\"\n\nArcot was speaking eagerly, excitedly.\n\n\"But here is the great fact, the important thing: It is artificially\ncreated in a given place. It is made, and exists at the point determined\nby these three coordinated dials. It is not natural, and can exist only\nwhere it is made and nowhere else--obvious, but important. It cannot\nexist save at the point designated. Then, if that point moves along a\nline, the artificial matter must follow that moving point and be always\nat that point. Suppose now that a slab of steel is on that line. The\npoint moves to it--through it. To exist, that artificial matter _must_\nfollow it through the steel--if not, it is destroyed. Then the steel is\nattempting to destroy the artificial matter. If the matter has\nsufficient energy, it will force the steel out of the way, and\npenetrate. The same is true of any other matter, lux metal or relux--it\nwill penetrate. To continue in existence it must. And it has great\nenergy, and will expend every erg of that energy of existence to\ncontinue existence.\n\n\"It is, as long as its energy holds out, absolutely irresistible!\n\n\"But similarly, if it is at a given point, it must stay there, and will\nexpend every erg staying there. It is then immovable! It is either\nirresistible in motion, or immovable in static condition. It is the\nirresistible and the immovable!\n\n\"What happens if the irresistible meets the immovable? It can only fight\nwith its energy of existence, and the more energetic prevails.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\nIMPROVEMENTS AND CALCULATIONS\n\n\n\"It is still incredible. But you have done it. It is certainly\nsuccessful!\" said the Talsonian scientist with conviction.\n\nArcot shook his head. \"Far from it--we have not realized a thousandth\npart of the tremendous possibilities of this invention. We must work and\ncalculate and then invent.\n\n\"Think of the possibilities as a shield--naturally if we can make the\nmatter we should be able to control its properties in any way we like.\nWe should be able to make it opaque, transparent, or any color.\" Arcot\nwas speaking to Morey now. \"Do you remember, when we were caught in that\ncosmic ray field in space when we first left this universe, that I said\nthat I had an idea for energy so vast that it would be impossible to\ndescribe its awful power?[1] I mentioned that I would attempt to\nliberate it if ever there was need? The need exists. I want to find that\nsecret.\"\n\n[Footnote 1: Islands of Space.]\n\nStel Felso Theu was looking out through the window at a group of men\nexcitedly beckoning. He called the attention of the others to them, and\nhimself went out. Arcot and Wade joined him in a moment.\n\n\"They tell me that Fellsheh, well to the poleward of here has used four\nof its eight shots. They are still being attacked,\" explained the\nTalsonian gravely.\n\n\"Well, get in,\" snapped Arcot as he ran back to the ship. Stel Felso\nhastily followed, and the _Ancient Mariner_ shot into the air, and\ndarted away, poleward, to the Talsonian's directions. The ground fled\nbehind them at a speed that made the scientist grip the hand-rail with a\ntenseness that showed his nervousness.\n\nAs they approached, a tremendous concussion and a great gout of light in\nthe sky informed them of the early demise of several Thessians. But a\nreal fleet was clustered about the city. Arcot approached low, and was\nable to get quite close before detection. His ray screen was up and\nMorey had charged the artificial matter apparatus, small as it was, for\noperation. He created a ball of substance outside the _Ancient Mariner_,\nand thrust it toward the nearest Thessian, just as a molecular hit the\n_Ancient Mariner'_s ray screen.\n\nThe artificial matter instantly exploded with terrific violence,\nslightly denting the tremendously strong lux metal walls. The pressure\nof the light was so great that the inner relux walls were dented inward.\nThe ground below was suddenly, instantaneously fused.\n\n\"Lord--they won't pass a ray screen, obviously,\" Morey muttered, picking\nhimself from where he had fallen.\n\n\"Hey--easy there. You blinked off the ray screen, and our relux is\nseriously weakened,\" called Arcot, a note of worry in his voice.\n\n\"No artificial matter with the ray screen up. I'll use the magnet,\"\ncalled Morey.\n\nHe quickly shut off the apparatus, and went to the huge magnet control.\nThe power room was crowded, and now that the battle was raging in truth,\nwith three ships attacking simultaneously, even the enormous power\ncapacity of the ship's generators was not sufficient, and the storage\ncoils had been thrown into the operation. Morey looked at the\ninstruments a moment. They were all up to capacity, save the ammeter\nfrom the coils. That wasn't registering yet. Suddenly it flicked, and\nthe other instrument dropped to zero. They were in artificial space.\n\n\"Come here, will you, Morey,\" called Arcot. In a moment Morey joined his\nmuch worried friend.\n\n\"That artificial matter control won't work through ray screens. The\nThessians never had to protect against moleculars here, and didn't have\nthem up--hence the destruction wrought. We can't take our screen down,\nand we can't use our most deadly weapon with it up. If we had a big\noutfit, we might throw a screen around the whole ship, and sail right\nin. But we haven't.\n\n\"We can't stand ten seconds against that fleet. I'm going to find their\nbase, and make them yell for help.\" Arcot snapped a tiny switch one\nnotch further for the barest instant, then snapped it back. They were\nseveral millions miles from the planet. \"Quicker,\" he explained, \"to\nsimply follow those ships back home--go back in time.\"\n\nWith the telectroscope, he took views at various distances, thus quickly\ntracing them back to their base at the pole of the planet. Instantly\nArcot shot down, reaching the pole in less than a second, by carefully\nmaneuvering of the space device.\n\nA gigantic dome of polished relux rose from rocky, icy plains. The thing\nwas nearly half a mile high, a mighty rounded roof that covered an area\nalmost three-quarters of a mile in diameter. Titanic--that was the only\nword that described it. About it there was the peculiar shimmer of a\nmolecular ray screen.\n\nMorey darted to the power room and set his apparatus into operation. He\ncreated a ball of matter outside the ship and hurled it instantly at the\nfort. It exploded with a terrific concussion as it hit the wall of the\nray screen. Almost instantly a second one followed. The concussion was\nterrifically violent, the ground about was fused, and the ray screen was\nopened for a moment. Arcot threw all his moleculars on the screen, as\nMorey sent bomb after bomb at it. The coils supplied the energy, cracked\nthe rock beneath. Each energy release disrupted the ray-screen for a\nmoment, and the concentrated fury of the molecular beams poured through\nthe opened screen, and struck the relux behind. It glowed opalescent now\nin a spot twenty feet across. But the relux was tremendously thick.\nThirty bombs Morey hurled, while they held their position without\ndifficulty, pouring their bombs and rays at the fort.\n\nArcot threw the ship into space, moved, and reappeared suddenly nearly\nthree hundred yards further on. A snap of the eyes, and he saw that the\nfleet was approaching now. He went again into space, and retreated.\nDiscretion was the better part of valor. But his plan had worked.\n\nHe waited half an hour, and returned. From a distance the telectroscope\ntold him that one lone ship was patrolling outside the fort. He moved\ntoward it, creeping up behind the icy mountains. His magnetic beam\nreached out. The ship lurched and fell. The magnetic beam reached out\ntoward the fort, from which a molecular ray had flashed already, tearing\nup the icy waste which had concealed him. The ray-screen stopped it,\nwhile again Morey turned the magnetic beam on--this time against the\nfort. The ray remained on! Arcot retreated hastily.\n\n\"They found the secret, all right. No use, Morey, come on up,\" called\nthe pilot. \"They evidently put magnetic shielding around the apparatus.\nThat means the magnetic beam is no good to us any more. They will\ncertainly warn every other base, and have them install similar\nprotection.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you try the magnetic ray on our first attack?\" asked Zezdon\nAfthen.\n\n\"If it had worked, their sending apparatus would have been destroyed,\nand no message could have been sent to call their attackers off\nFellsheh. By forcing them to recall their fleet I got results I couldn't\nget by attacking the fleet,\" Arcot said.\n\n\"I think there is little more I can do here, Stel Felso Theu. I will\ntake you to Shesto, and there make final arrangements till my return,\nwith apparatus capable of overthrowing your enemies. If you wish to\naccompany me--you may.\" He glanced around at the others of his party.\n\"And our next move will be to return to Earth with what we have. Then we\nwill investigate the Sirian planets, and learn anything they may have of\ninterest, thence--to the real outer space, the utter void of\nintergalactic space, and an attempt to learn the secret of that enormous\npower.\"\n\nThey returned to Shesto, and there Arcot arranged that the only\ngenerator they could spare, the one already in their possession, might\nbe used till other terrestrian ships could bring more. They left for\nEarth. Hour after hour they fled through the void, till at last old Sol\nwas growing swiftly ahead of them, and finally Earth itself was large on\nthe screens. They changed to a straight molecular drive, and dropped to\nthe Vermont field from which they had taken off.\n\nDuring the long voyage, Morey and Arcot had both spent much of the time\nworking on the time-distortion field, which would give them a tremendous\ncontrol over time, either speeding or slowing their time rate\nenormously. At last, this finished, they had worked on the artificial\nmatter theory, to the point where they could control the shape of the\nmatter perfectly, though as yet they could not control its exact nature.\nThe possibility of such control was, however, definitely proven by the\nresults the machines had given them. Arcot had been more immediately\ninterested in the control of form. He could control the nature as to\nopacity or transparency to all vibrations that normal matter is opaque\nor transparent to. Light would pass, or not as he chose, but cosmics he\ncould not stop nor would radio or moleculars be stopped by any present\nshield he could make.\n\nThey had signaled, as soon as they slowed outside the atmosphere, and\nwhen they settled to the field, Arcot's father and a number of very\nimportant scientists had already arrived.\n\nArcot senior greeted his son very warmly, but he was tremendously\nworried, as his son soon saw.\n\n\"What's happened, Dad--won't they believe your statements?\"\n\n\"They doubted when I went to Luna for a session with the Interplanetary\nCouncil, but before they could say much, they had plenty of proof of my\nstatements,\" the older man answered. \"News came that a fleet of\nPlanetary Guard ships had been wiped out by a fleet of ships from outer\nspace. They were huge things--nearly half a mile in length. The Guard\nships went up to them--fifty of them--and tried to signal for a\nconference. The white ship was instantly wiped out--we don't know how.\nThey didn't have ray screens, but that wasn't it. Whatever it\nwas--slightly luminous ray in space--it simply released the energy of\nthe lux metal and relux of the ship. Being composed of light energy\nsimply bound by photonic attraction, it let go with terrible energy.\nThey can do it almost instantly from a distance. The other Guards at\nonce let loose with all their moleculars and cosmics. The enemy shunted\noff the moleculars, and wiped out the Guard almost instantly.\n\n\"Of course, I could explain the screen, but not the detonation ray. I am\ninclined to believe from other casualties that the destruction, though\nreported as an instantaneous explosion, was not that. Other ships have\nbeen destroyed, and they seemed to catch fire, and burn, but with\nterrific speed, more like gun powder than coal. It seems to start a\nspreading decomposition, the ship lasts perhaps ten minutes. If it went\ninstantly, the shock of such a tremendous energy release would disrupt\nthe planet.\n\n\"At any rate, the great fleet separated, twelve went to the North Pole\nof Earth, twelve to the south, and similarly twelve to each pole of\nVenus. Then one of them turned, and went back to wherever it had come\nfrom, to report. Just turned and vanished. Similarly one from Venus\nturned and vanished. That leaves twelve at each of the four poles, for,\nas I said, there were an even fifty.\n\n\"They all followed the same tactics on landing, so I'll simply tell what\nhappened in Attica. In the North they had to pick one of the islands a\nbit to the south of the pole. They melted about a hundred square miles\nof ice to find one.\n\n\"The ships arranged themselves in a circle around the place, and\nliterally hundreds of men poured out of each and fell to work. In a\nshort time, they had set up a number of machines, the parts coming from\nthe ships. These machines at once set to work, and they built up a relux\nwall. That wall was at least six feet thick; the floor was lined with\nthick relux as well as the roof, which is simply a continuation of the\nwall in a perfect dome. They had so many machines working on it, that\nwithin twenty-four hours they had it finished.\n\n\"We attacked twice, once in practically our entire force, with some\nray-shield machines. The result was disastrous. The second attack was\nmade with ray shielded machines only, and little damage was done to\neither side, though the enemy were somewhat impeded by masses of ice\nhurled into their position. Their relux disintegration ray was\nconspicuous by its absence.\n\n\"Yesterday--and it seems a lot longer than that, son--they started it\nagain. They'd been unloading it from the ship evidently. We had had\nray-shielded machines out, but they simply melted. They went down, and\nEarth retreated. They're in their fortress now. We don't know how to\nfight them. Now, for God's sake, tell us you have learned of some\nweapon, son!\"\n\nThe older man's face was lined. His iron gray head showed his fatigue\ndue to hours of concentration on his work.\n\n\"Some,\" replied Arcot briefly. He glanced around. Other men had arrived,\nmen whom he met in his work. But there were Venerians here, too, in\ntheir protective suits, insulated against the cold of Earth, and against\nits atmosphere.\n\n\"First, though, gentlemen, allow me to introduce Stel Felso Theu of the\nplanet Talso, one of our allies in this struggle, and Zezdon Afthen and\nFentes of Ortol, one of our other allies.\n\n\"As to progress, I can say only that it is in a more or less rudimentary\nstage. We have the basis for great progress, a weapon of inestimable\nvalue--but it is only the basis. It must be worked out. I am leaving\nwith you today the completed calculations and equations of the time\nfield, the system used by the Thessian invaders in propelling their\nships at a speed greater than that of light. Also, the uncompleted\ncalculations in regard to another matter, a weapon which our ally,\nTalso, has given us, in exchange for the aid we gave in allowing them\nthe use of one of our generators. Unfortunately the ship could not spare\nmore than the single generator. I strongly advise rushing a number of\ngenerators to Talso in intergalactic freighters. They badly need\npower--power of respectable dimensions.\n\n\"I have stopped on Earth only temporarily, and I want to leave as soon\nas possible. I intend, however, to attempt an attack on the Arctic base\nof the Thessians, in strong hopes that they have not armored against one\nweapon that the _Ancient Mariner_ carries--though I sadly fear that old\nEarth herself has played us false here. I hope to use the magnetic beam,\nbut Earth's polar magnetism may have forced them to armor, and they may\nhave sufficiently heavy material to block the effects.\"\n\nMorey already had a ground crew servicing the ship. He gave designs to\nmachinists on hand to make special control panels for the large\nartificial matter machines. Arcot and Wade got some badly needed\nequipment.\n\nIn six hours, Arcot had announced himself ready, and a squadron of\nPlanetary Guard ships were ready to accompany the refitted _Ancient\nMariner_.\n\nThey approached the pole cautiously, and were rewarded by the hiss and\nroar of ice melting into water which burst into steam under a ray. It\nwas coming from an outpost of the camp, a tiny dome under a great mass\nof ice. But the dome was of relux. A molecular reached down from a Guard\nship--and the Guard ship crumbled suddenly as dozens of moleculars from\nthe points hit it.\n\n\"They know how to fight this kind of a war. That's their biggest\nadvantage,\" muttered Arcot. Wade merely swore.\n\n\"Ray screens, no moleculars!\" snapped Arcot into the transmitter. He was\nnot their leader, but they saw his wisdom, and the squadron commander\nrepeated the advice as an order. In the meantime, another ship had\nfallen. The dome had its screen up, allowing the multitudes of hidden\nstations outside to fight for it.\n\n\"Hmm--something to remember when terrestrians have to retire to forts.\nThey will, too, before this war is over. That way the main fort doesn't\nhave to lower its ray screen to fight,\" commented Arcot. He was watching\nintensely as a tiny ship swung away from one of the larger machines, and\na tremendously powerful molecular started biting at the fort's ray\nscreen. The ship seemed nothing but a flying ray projector, which was\nwhat it was.\n\nAs they had hoped, the deadly new ray stabbed out from somewhere on the\nside of the fort. It was not within the fort.\n\n\"Which means,\" pointed out Morey, \"that they can't make stuff to stand\nthat. Probably the projector would be vulnerable.\"\n\nBut a barrage of heat rays which immediately followed had no apparent\neffect. The little radio-controlled molecular beam projector lay on the\nrock under the melted ice, blazing incandescent with the rapidly\nreleased energy of the relux.\n\n\"Now to try the real test we came here for,\" Morey clambered back to the\npower room, and turned on the controls of the magnetic beam. The ship\nwas aligned, and then he threw the last switch. The great mass of the\nmachine jerked violently, and plunged forward as the beam attracted the\nmagnetic core of the Earth.\n\nMorey could not see it, but almost instantly the shimmer of the\nmolecular screen on the fort died out. The deadly ray sprang out from\nthe Thessian projector--and went dead. Frantically the Thessians tried\nweapon after weapon, and found them dead almost as soon as they were\nturned on--which was the natural result in the terrific magnetic field.\n\nAnd these men had iron bones, their very bones were attracted by the\nbeam; they plunged upward toward the ship as the beam touched them, but,\naccustomed to the enormous gravitation accelerations of an enormous\nworld, most of them were not killed.\n\n\"Ah--!\" exclaimed Arcot. He picked up the transmitter and spoke again to\nthe Squadron Commander. \"Squadron Commander Tharnton, what relux\nthickness does your ship carry?\"\n\n\"Inch and a quarter,\" replied the surprised voice of the commander.\n\n\"Any of the other ships carry heavier?\"\n\n\"Yes, the special solar investigator carries five inches. What shall we\ndo?\"\n\n\"Tell him to lower his screen, and let loose at once on all operating\nforts. His relux will stand for the time needed to shut them down for\ntheir own screens, unless some genius decides to fight it out. As soon\nas the other ships can lower their screens, tell them to do so, and tell\nthem to join in. I'll be able to help then. My relux has been burned,\nand I'm afraid to lower the screen. It's mighty thin already.\"\n\nThe squadron commander was smiling joyously as he relayed the advice as\na command.\n\nAlmost at once a single ship, blunt, an almost perfect cylinder, lowered\nits screen. In an instant the opalescence of the transformation showed\non it, but its dozen ray projectors were at work. Fort after fort glowed\nopalescent, then flashed into protective ionization of screening.\nQuickly other ships lowered their screens, and joined in. In a moment\nmore, the forts had been forced to raise their screens for protection.\n\nA disc of artificial matter ten feet across suddenly appeared beside the\n_Ancient Mariner_. It advanced with terrific speed, struck the great\ndome of the fort, and the dome caved, bent in, bent still more--but\nwould not puncture. The disc retreated, became a sharp cone, and drove\nin again. This time the point smashed through the relux, and made a\nsmall hole. The cone seemed to change gradually, melting into a cylinder\nof twenty foot diameter, and the hole simply expanded. It continued to\nexpand as the cylinder became a huge disc, a hundred feet across, set in\nthe wall.\n\nSuddenly it simply dissolved. There was a terrific roar, and a mighty\ncolumn of white rushed out of the gaping hole. Figures of Thessians\ncaught by the terrific current came rocketing out. The inside was at\nlast visible. The terrific pressure was hurling the outside line of\nships about like thistledown. The _Ancient Mariner_ reeled back under\nthe tremendous blast of expanding gas. The snow that fell to the boiling\nwater below was not water, _in toto_; some was carbon dioxide--and some\noxygen chilled in the expansion of the gas. It was snowing within the\ndome. The falling forms of Thessians were robbed of the life-giving air\npressure to which they were accustomed. But all this was visible for but\nan instant.\n\nThen a small, thin sheet of artificial matter formed beside the fort,\nand advanced on the dome. Like a knife cutting open an orange, it simply\nwent around the dome's edge, the great dome lifted like the lid of a\nteapot under the enormous gas pressure remaining--then dropped under its\nown weight.\n\nThe artificial matter was again a huge disc. It settled over the exact\ncenter of the dome--and went down. The dome caved in. It was crushed\nunder a load utterly inestimable. Then the great disc, like some\nmonstrous tamper, tamped the entire works of the Thessians into the\nbed-rock of the island. Every ship, every miniature fort, every man was\ncaught under it--and annihilated.\n\nThe disc dissolved. A terrific barrage of heat beams played over the\nisland, and the rock melted, flowed over the ruins, and left only the\nspumes of steam from the Arctic ice rising from a red-hot: mass of rock,\ncontained a boiling pool.\n\nThe Battle of the Arctic was done.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\"WRITE OFF THE MAGNET\"\n\n\n\"Squadron commander Tharnton speaking: Squadron 73-B of Planetary Guard\nwill follow orders from Dr. Arcot directly. Heading south to Antarctica\nat maximum speed,\" droned the communicator. Under the official tone of\ncommand was a note of suppressed rage and determination. \"And the\nsquadron commander wishes Dr. Arcot every success in wiping out\nAntarctica as thoroughly and completely as he destroyed the Arctic\nbase.\"\n\nThe flight of ships headed south at a speed that heated them white in\nthe air, thin as it was at the hundred mile altitude, yet going higher\nwould have taken unnecessary time, and the white heat meant no\ndiscomfort. They reached Antarctica in about ten minutes. The Thessian\nships were just entering through great locks in the walls of the dome.\nAt first sight of the terrestrial ships they turned, and shot toward the\nguard-ships. Their screens were down, for, armored as they were with\nvery heavy relux they expected to be able to overcome the terrestrial\nthin relux before theirs was seriously impaired.\n\n\"Ships will put up screens.\" Arcot spoke sharply--a new plan had\noccurred to him. The moleculars of the Thessians struck glowing screens,\nand no damage was done. \"Ships, in order of number, will lower screen\nfor thirty seconds, and concentrate all moleculars on one ship--the\nleader. Solar investigator will not join in action.\"\n\nThe flagship of the squadron lowered its screen, and a tremendous\nbombardment of rays struck the leading ship practically in one point.\nThe relux glowed, and the opalescence shifted with bewildering,\nconfusing colors. Then the terrestrial ship's screen was up, before the\nThessians could concentrate on the one unprotected ship. Immediately\nanother terrestrial ship opened its screen and bombarded the same ship.\nTwo others followed--and then it was forced to use its screen.\n\nBut suddenly a terrestrial ship crashed. Its straining screen had been\noverworked--and it failed.\n\nArcot's magnetic beam went into action. The Thessian ray did not go\nout--it flickered, dimmed, but was apparently as deadly as ever.\n\n\"Shielded--write off the magnet, Morey. That is one asset we lose.\"\n\nArcot, protected in space, was thinking swiftly. Moleculars--useless.\nThey had to keep their own screens up. Artificial matter--bound in by\ntheir own molecular screen! And the magnet had failed them against the\nprotected mechanism of the dome. The ships were not as yet protected,\nbut the dome was.\n\n\"Guess the only place we'd be safe is under the ground--way under!\"\ncommented Wade dryly.\n\n\"Under the ground--Wade, you're a genius!\" Arcot gave a shout of joy,\nand told Wade to take over the ship.\n\n\"Take the ship back into normal space, head for the hill over behind the\nDome, and drop behind it. It's solid rock, and even their rays will take\na moment or so to move it. As soon as you get there, drop to the ground,\nand turn off the screen. No--here, I'll do it. You just take it there,\nland on the ground, and shut off the screen. I promise the rest!\" Arcot\ndived for the artificial matter room.\n\nThe ship was suddenly in normal space; its screen up. The dog-fight had\nbeen ended. The terrestrial ships had been completely defeated. The\n_Ancient Mariner'_s appearance was a signal for all the moleculars in\nsight. Ten huge ships, half a dozen small forts and now the unshielded\nDome, joined in. Their screen tubes heated up violently in the brief\nmoment it took to dive behind the hill, a tube fused, and blew out.\nAutomatic devices shunted it, another tube took the load--and heated.\nBut their screen was full of holes before they were safe for the moment\nbehind the hill.\n\nInstantly Wade dropped the defective screen. Almost as quickly as the\nscreen vanished, a cylinder of artificial matter surrounded the entire\nship. The cylinder was tipped by a perfect cone of the same base\ndiameter. The entire system settled into the solid rock. The rock above\ncracked and filled in behind them. The ship was suddenly pushed by the\nbase of the cylinder behind them, and drove on through the rock, the\ncone parting the hard granite ahead. They went perhaps half a mile, then\nstopped. In the light of the ship's windows, they could see the faint\nmistiness of the inconceivably hard, artificial matter, and beyond the\nslick, polished surface of the rock it was pushing aside. The cone shape\nwas still there.\n\nThere was a terrific roar behind them, the rock above cracked, shifted\nand moved about.\n\n\"Raying the spot where we went down,\" Arcot grinned happily.\n\nThe cone and cylinder merged, shifted together, and became a sphere. The\nsphere elongated upward and the _Ancient Mariner_ turned in it, till it,\ntoo, pointed upward. The sphere became an ellipsoid.\n\nSuddenly the ship was moving, accelerating terrifically. It plowed\nthrough the solid rock, and up--into a burst of light. They were\n_inside_ the dome. Great ships were berthed about the floor. Huge\nmachines bulked here and there--barracks for men--everything.\n\nThe ellipsoid shrank to a sphere, the sphere grew a protuberance which\nseparated and became a single bar-like cylinder. The cylinder turned,\nand drove through the great dome wall. A little hole but it whirled\nrapidly around, sliced the top off neatly and quickly. Again, like a\ngigantic teapot lid, the whole great structure lifted, settled, and\nstayed there. Men, scrambling wildly toward ships, suddenly stopped,\nseemed to blur and their features ran together horribly. They fell--and\nwere dead in an instant as the air disappeared. In another instant they\nwere solid blocks of ice, for the temperature was below the freezing\npoint of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe giant tamper set to work. The Thessian ships went first. They were\nall crumpled, battered wrecks in a few seconds of work of the terrible\ndisc.\n\nThe dome was destroyed. Arcot tried something else. He put on his\ncontrol machine the equation of a hyperboloid of two branches, and\nchanged the constants gradually till the two branches came close. Then\nhe forced them against each other. Instantly they fought, fought\nterribly for existence. A tremendous blast of light and heat exploded\ninto being. The energy of two tons of lead attempted to maintain those\ntwo branches. It was not, fortunately, explosive, and it took place over\na relux floor. Most of the energy escaped into space. The vast flood of\nlight was visible on Venus, despite the clouds.\n\nBut it fused most of Antarctica. It destroyed the last traces of the\ncamp in Antarctica.\n\n\"Well--the Squadron was wiped out, I see.\" Arcot's voice was flat as he\nspoke. The Squadron: twenty ships--four hundred men.\n\n\"Yes--but so is the Arctic camp, and the Antarctic camp, as well,\"\nreplied Wade.\n\n\"What next, Arcot. Shall we go out to intergalactic space at once?\"\nasked Morey, coming up from the power room.\n\n\"No, we'll go back to Vermont, and have the time-field stuff I ordered\ninstalled, then go to Sirius, and see what they have. They moved their\nplanets from the gravitation field of Negra, their dead, black star, to\nthe field of Sirius--and I'd like to know how they did it.[2]\nThen--Intergalactia.\" He started the ship toward Vermont, while Morey\ngot into communication with the field, and gave them a brief report.\n\n[Footnote 2: \"The Black Star Passes.\"]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nSIRIUS\n\n\nThey landed about half an hour later, and Arcot simply went into the\ncottage, and slept--with the aid of a light soporific. Morey and Wade\ndirected the disposition of the machines, but Dr. Arcot senior really\nfinished the job. The machines would be installed in less than ten\nhours, for the complete plans Arcot and Morey had made, with the modern\nmachines for translating plans to metal and lux had made the actual\nconstruction quick, while the large crew of men employed required but\nlittle time.\n\nWhen Arcot and his friends awoke, the machines were ready.\n\n\"Well, Dad, you have the plans for all the machines we have. I expect to\nbe back in two weeks. In the meantime you might set up a number of ships\nwith very heavy relux walls, walls that will stand rays for a while, and\nequip them with the rudimentary artificial matter machines you have, and\ngo ahead with the work on the calculations. Thett will land other\nmachines here--or on the moon. Probably they will attempt to ray the\nwhole Earth. They won't have concentration of ray enough to move the\nplanet, or to seriously chill it. But life is a different matter--it's\nsensitive. It is quite apt to let go even under a mild ray. I think that\na few exceedingly powerful ray screen stations might be set up, and the\nHeavyside Layer used to transmit the vibrations entirely around the\nEarth. You can see the idea easily enough. If you think it\nworthwhile--or better, if you can convince the thickheaded politicians\nof the Interplanatary Defense Commission that it is--\n\n\"Beyond that, I'll see you in about two weeks,\" Arcot turned, and\nentered the ship.\n\n\"I'll line up for Sirius and let go.\" Arcot turned the ship now, for\nEarth was well behind, and lined it on Sirius, bright in the utter black\nof space. He pushed his control to \"1/2,\" and the space closed in about\nthem. Arcot held it there while the chronometer moved through six and a\nhalf seconds. Sirius was at a distance almost planetary in its magnitude\nfrom them. Controlling directly now, he brought the ship closer, till a\nplanet loomed large before them--a large world, its rocky continents,\nits rolling oceans and jagged valleys white under the enormous\nenergy-flood from the gigantic star of Sirius, twenty-six times more\nbrilliant than the sun they had left.\n\n\"But, Arcot, hadn't you better take it easy?\" Wade asked. \"They might\ntake us for enemies--which wouldn't be so good.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would be wise to go slowly. I had planned, as a matter of\nfact, on looking up a Thessian ship, taking a chance on a fight, and\nproving our friendship,\" replied Arcot.\n\nMorey saw Arcot's logic--then suddenly burst into laughter.\n\"Absolutely--attack a Thessian. But since we don't see any around now,\nwe'll have to make one!\"\n\nWade was completely mystified, and gave Morey a doubtful, sarcastic\nlook. \"Sounds like a good idea, only I wonder if this constant terrific\nmental strain--\"\n\n\"Come along and find out!\" Arcot threw the ship into artificial space\nfor safety, holding it motionless. The planet, invisible to them,\nretreated from their motionless ship.\n\nIn the artificial matter control room, Arcot set to work, and developed\na very considerable string of forms on his board, the equations of their\nformations requiring all the available formation controls.\n\n\"Now,\" said Arcot at last, \"you stay here, Morey, and when I give the\nsignal, create the thing back of the nearest range of hills, raise it,\nand send it toward us.\"\n\nAt once they returned to normal space, and darted down toward the now\ndistant planet. They landed again near another city, one which was\nsituated close to a range of mountains ideally suited to their purposes.\nThey settled, while Zezdon Afthen sent out the message of friendship. He\nfinally succeeded in getting some reaction, a sensation of scepticism,\nof distrust--but of interest. They needed friends, and only hoped that\nthese were friends. Arcot pushed a little signal button, and Morey began\nhis share of the play. From behind a low hill a slim, pointed form\nemerged, a beautifully streamlined ship, the lines obviously those of a\nThessian, the windows streaming light, while the visible ionization\nabout the hull proclaimed its molecular ray screen. Instantly Zezdon\nAfthen, who had carefully refrained from learning the full nature of\ntheir plans, felt the intense emotion of the discovery, called out to\nthe others, while his thoughts were flashed to the Sirians below.\n\nFrom the attacking ship, a body shot with tremendous speed, it flashed\nby, barely missing the _Ancient Mariner_, and buried itself in the\nhillside beyond. With a terrific explosion it burst, throwing the soil\nabout in a tremendous crater. The _Ancient Mariner_ spun about, turned\ntoward the other ship, and let loose a tremendous bombardment of\nmolecular and cosmic rays. A great flame of ionized air was the only\nresult. A new ray reached out from the other ship, a fan-like spreading\nray. It struck the _Ancient Mariner_, and did not harm it, though the\nhillside behind was suddenly withered and blackened, then smoking as the\ntemperature rose.\n\nAnother projectile was launched from the attacking ship, and exploded\nterrifically but a few hundred feet from the _Ancient Mariner_. The\nterrestrial ship rocked and swayed, and even the distant attacker rocked\nunder the explosion.\n\nA projectile, glowing white, leaped from the Earthship. It darted toward\nthe enemy ship, seemed to barely touch it, then burst into terrific\nflames that spread, eating the whole ship, spreading glowing flame. In\nan instant the blazing ship slumped, started to fall, then seemingly\nevaporated, and before it touched the ground, was completely gone.\n\nThe relief in Zezdon Afthen's mind was genuine, and it was easily\nobvious to the Sirians that the winning ship was friendly, for, with all\nits frightful armament, it had downed a ship obviously of Thett. Though\nnot exactly like the others, it had the all too familiar lines.\n\n\"They welcome us now,\" said Zezdon Afthen's mental message to his\ncompanions.\n\n\"Tell them we'll be there--with bells on or thoughts to that effect,\"\ngrinned Arcot. Morey had appeared in the doorway, smiling broadly.\n\n\"How was the show?\" he asked.\n\n\"Terrible--Why didn't you let it fall, and break open?\"\n\n\"What would happen to the wreckage as we moved?\" he asked sarcastically.\n\"I thought it was a darned good demonstration.\"\n\n\"It was convincing,\" laughed Arcot. \"They want us now!\"\n\nThe great ship circled down, landing gently just outside of the city.\nAlmost at once one of the slim, long Sirian ships shot up from a\ncourtyard of the city, racing out and toward the _Ancient Mariner_.\nScarcely a moment later half a hundred other ships from all over the\ncity were on the way. Sirians seemed quite humanly curious.\n\n\"We'll have to be careful here. We have to use altitude suits, as the\nNegrians breathe an atmosphere of hydrogen instead of oxygen,\" explained\nArcot rapidly to the Ortolian and the Talsonian who were to accompany\nhim. \"We will all want to go, and so, although this suit will be\ndecidedly uncomfortable for you and Zezdon Afthen and Stel Felso Theu, I\nthink it wise that you all wear it. It will be much more convincing to\nthe Sirians if we show that people of no less than three worlds are\nalready interested in this alliance.\"\n\nA considerable number of Sirian ships had landed about them, and the\ntall, slim men of the 100,000,000-year-old race were watching them with\ntheir great brown eyes from a slight distance, for a cordon of men with\nevident authority were holding them back.\n\n\"Who are you, friends?\" asked a single man who stood within the cordon.\nHis strongly built frame, a great high brow and broad head designated\nhim a leader at a glance.\n\nDespite the vast change the light of Sirius had wrought, Arcot\nrecognized in him the original photographs he had seen from the planet\nold Sol had captured as Negra had swept past. So it was he who answered\nthe thought-question.\n\n\"I am of the third planet of the sun your people sought as a home a few\nyears back in time, Taj Lamor. Because you did not understand us, and\nbecause we did not understand you, we fought. We found the records of\nyour race on the planet our sun captured, and we know now what you most\nwanted. Had we been able to communicate with you then, as we can now,\nour people would never have fought.\n\n\"At last you have reached that sun you so needed, thanks, no doubt, to\nthe genius that was with you.\n\n\"But now, in your new-found peace comes a new enemy, one who wants not\nonly yours, but every sun in this galaxy.\n\n\"You have tried your ray of death, the anti-catalyst? And it but\nsputters harmlessly on their screens? You have been swept by their\nterrible rays that fuse mountains, then hurl them into space? Our world\nand the world of each of these men is similarly menaced.\n\n\"See, here is Zezdon Afthen, from Ortol, far on the other side of the\ngalaxy, and here is Stel Felso Theu, of Talso. Their worlds, as well as\nyours and mine have been attacked by this menace from a distant galaxy,\nfrom Thett, of the sun Ansteck, of the galaxy Venone.\n\n\"Now we must form an alliance of far wider scope than ever has existed\nbefore.\n\n\"To you we have come, for your race is older by far than any race of our\nalliance. Your science has advanced far higher. What weapons have you\ndiscovered among those ancient documents, Taj Lamor? We have one weapon\nthat you no doubt need; a screen, which will stop the rays of the\nmolecule director apparatus. What have you to offer us?\"\n\n\"We need your help badly,\" was the reply. \"We have been able to keep\nthem from landing on our planets, but it has cost us much. They have\nlanded on a planet we brought with us when we left the black star, but\nit is not inhabited. From this as a base they have made attacks on us.\nWe tried throwing the planet into Sirius. They merely left the planet\nhurriedly as it fell toward the star, and broke free from our attractive\nray.\"\n\n\"The attractive ray! Then you have uncovered that secret?\" asked Arcot\neagerly.\n\nTaj Lamor had some of his men bring an attractive ray projector to the\nship. The apparatus turned out to be nearly a thousand tons in weight,\nand some twenty feet long, ten feet wide and approximately twelve feet\nhigh. It was impossible to load the huge machine into the _Ancient\nMariner_, so an examination was conducted on the spot, with instruments\nwhose reading was intelligible to the terrestrians operating it. Its\nprincipal fault lay in the fact that, despite the enormous energy of\nmatter given out, the machine still gobbled up such titanic amounts of\nenergy before the attraction could be established, that a very large\nmachine was needed. The ray, so long as maintained, used no more power\nthan was actually expended in moving the planet or other body. The power\nused while the ray was in action corresponded to the work done, but a\ntremendous power was needed to establish it, and this power could never\nbe recovered.\n\nFurther, no reaction was produced in the machine, no matter what body it\nwas turned upon. In swinging a planet then, a spaceship could be used as\nthe base for the reaction was not exerted on the machine.\n\nFrom such meager clues, and the instruments, Arcot got the hints that\nled him to the solution of the problem, for the documents, from which\nTaj Lamor had gotten his information, had been disastrously wiped out,\nwhen one of their cities fell, and Taj Lamor had but copied the machines\nof his ancestors.\n\nThe immense value of these machines was evident, for they would permit\nArcot to do many things that would have been impossible without them.\nThe explanation as he gave it to Stel Felso Theu, foretold the uses to\nwhich it might be put.\n\n\"As a weapon,\" he pointed out, \"its most serious fault is that it takes\na considerable time to pump in the power needed. It has here,\npractically the same fault which the artificial matter had on your\nworld.\n\n\"As I see it, the ray is actually a directed gravitational field.\n\n\"Now here is one thing that makes it more interesting, and more useful.\nIt seems to defy the laws of mechanics. It acts, but there is no\napparent reaction! A small ship can swing a world! Remember, the field\nthat generates the attraction is an integral, interwoven part of the\nmesh of Space. It is created by something outside of itself. Like the\nartificial matter, it exists there, and there alone. There is reaction\non that attractive field, but it is created in Space at that given\npoint, and the reaction is taken by all Space. No wonder it won't move.\n\n\"The work considerations are fairly obvious. The field is built up. That\ntakes energy. The beam is focused on a body, the body falls nearer, and\nimmediately absorbs the energy in acquiring a velocity. The machine\nreplenishes the energy, because it is set to maintain a certain\nenergy-level in the field. Therefore the machine must do the work of\nmoving the ship, just as though it were a driving apparatus. After the\nbeam has done what is wanted, it may be shut off, and the energy in the\nfield is now available for any work needed. It may be drained back into\npower coils such as ours for instance, or one might just spend that last\niota of power on the job.\n\n\"As a driving device it might be set to pull the entire ship along, and\nstill not have any acceleration detectable to the occupants.\n\n\"I think we'll use that on our big ship,\" he finished, his eyes far away\non some future idea.\n\n\"Natural gravity of natural matter is, luckily, not selective. It goes\nin all directions. But this artificial gravity is controlled so that it\ndoes not spread, and the result is that the mass-attraction of a mass of\nmatter does not fall off as the inverse square of the distance, but like\nthe ray from the parallel beam spotlight, continues undiminished.\n\n\"Actually, they create an exceedingly intense, exceedingly small\ngravitational field, and direct it in a straight line. The building up\nof this field is what takes time.\"\n\nZezdon Afthen, who had a question which was troubling him, looked\nanxiously at his friends. Finally he broke into their thoughts which had\nbeen too cryptically abbreviated for him to follow, like the work of a\nprofessor solving some problem, his steps taken so swiftly and so\nabbreviated that their following was impossible to his students.\n\n\"But how is it that the machine is not moved when exerting such force on\nsome other body?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Oh, the ray concentrates the gravitational force, and projects it. The\nactual strain is in space. It is space that takes the strain, but in\nnormal cases, unless the masses are very large, no considerable\nacceleration is produced over any great distance. That law operates in\nthe case of the pulled body; it pulls the gravitational field as a\nnormal field, the inverse-square law applying.\n\n\"But on the other hand, the gravity-beam pulls with a constant force.\n\n\"It might be likened to the light-pressure effects of a spotlight and a\nstar. The spotlight would push the sun with a force that was constant;\nno matter what the distance, while the light pressure of the sun would\nvary as the inverse square of the distance.\n\n\"But remember, it is not a body that pulls another body, but a\ngravitational field that pulls another. The field is in space. A normal\nfield is necessarily attached to the matter that it represents, or that\nrepresents it as you prefer, but this artificial field has no connection\nin the form of matter. It is a product of a machine, and exists only as\na strain in space. To move it you must move all space, since it, like\nartificial matter, exists only where it is created in space.\n\n\"Do you see now why the law of action and reaction is apparently\nflouted? Actually the reaction is taken up by space.\"\n\nArcot rose, and stretched. Morey and Wade had been looking at him, and\nnow they asked when he intended leaving for the intergalactic spaces.\n\n\"Now, I think. We have a lot of work to do. At present we have the\nmathematics of the artificial matter to carry on, and the math of the\nartificial gravity to develop. We gave the Sirians all we had on\nartificial matter and on moleculars.\n\n\"They gave us all they had--which wasn't much beyond the artificial\ngravity, and a lot of work. At any rate, let's go!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\nATTACKED\n\n\nThe _Ancient Mariner_ stirred, and rose lightly from its place beside\nthe city. Visible over the horizon now, and coming at terrific speed,\nwas a fleet of seven Thessian ships.\n\nThey must do their best to protect that city. Arcot turned the ship and\ncalled his decision to Morey. As he did so, one of the Thessian ships\nsuddenly swerved violently, and plunged downward. The attractive ray was\nin action. It struck the rocks of Neptune, and plunged in. Half buried,\nit stopped. Stopped--and backed out! The tremendously strong relux and\nlux had withstood the blow, and these strange, inhumanly powerful men\nhad not been injured!\n\nTwo of the ships darted toward him simultaneously, flashing out\nmolecular rays. The rays glanced off of Arcot's screen already in place,\nbut the tubes were showing almost at once that this could not be\nsustained. It was evident that the swiftly approaching ships would soon\nbreak down the shields. Arcot turned the ship and drove to one side. His\neyes went dead.\n\nHe cut into artificial space, waited ten seconds, then cut back. The\nscene before him changed. It seemed a different world. The light was\nvery dim, so dim he could scarcely see the images on the view plate.\nThey were so deep a red that they were very near to black. Even Sirius,\nthe flaming blue-white star was red. The darting Thessian ships were\nmoving quite slowly now, moving at a speed that was easy to follow.\nTheir rays, before ionizing the air brilliantly red, were now dark. The\ninstruments showed that the screen was no longer encountering serious\nloading, and, further, the load was coming in at a frequency harmlessly\nfar down the radio spectrum!\n\nArcot stared in wide-eyed amazement. What could the Thessians have done\nthat caused this change? He reached up and increased the amplification\non the eyes to a point that made even the dim illumination sufficient.\nWade was staring in amazement, too.\n\n\"Lord! What an idea!\" suddenly exclaimed Arcot.\n\nWade was staring at Arcot in equally great amazement. \"What's the\nsecret?\" he asked.\n\n\"Time, man, time! We are in an advanced time plane, living faster than\nthey, our atoms of fuel are destroyed faster, our second is shorter. In\none second of our earthly time our generators do the same amount of work\nas usual, but they do many, many times more work in one second, of the\ntime we were in! We are under the advanced time field.\"\n\nWade could see it all. The red light--normal light seen through eyes\nenormously speeded in all perceptions. The change, the dimness--dim\nbecause less energy reached them per second of their time. Then came\nthis blue light, as they reached the X-ray spectrum of Sirius, and saw\nX-rays as normal light--shielded, tremendously shielded by the\natmosphere, but the enormous amplification of the eyes made up for it.\n\nThe remaining Thessians seemed to get the idea simultaneously, and\nstarted for Arcot in his own time field. The Thessian ship appeared to\nbe actually leaping at him. Suddenly, his speed increased inconceivably.\nSimultaneously, Arcot's hand, already started toward the space-control\nswitch, reached it, and pushed it to the point that threw the ship into\nartificial Space. The last glimmer of light died suddenly, as the\nThessian ship's bow loomed huge beside the _Ancient Mariner_.\n\nThere was a terrific shock that hurled the ship violently to one side,\nthrew the men about inside the ship. Simultaneously the lights blinked\nout.\n\nLight returned as the automatic emergency incandescent lights in the\nroom, fed from an energy store coil, flashed on abruptly. The men were\nwhite-faced, tense in their positions. Swiftly Morey was looking over\nthe indicators on his remote-reading panel, while Arcot stared at the\nfew dials before the actual control board.\n\n\"_There's an air pressure outside the ship!_\" he cried out in surprise.\n\"High oxygen, very little nitrogen, breathable apparently, provided\nthere are no poisons. Temperature ten below zero C.\"\n\n\"Lights are off because relays opened when the crash short circuited\nthem.\" Morey and the entire group were suddenly shaking.\n\n\"Nervous shock,\" commented Zezdon Afthen. \"It will be an hour or more\nbefore we will be in condition to work.\"\n\n\"Can't wait,\" replied Arcot testily, his nerves on edge, too.\n\n\"Morey, make some good strong coffee if you can, and we'll waste a\nlittle air on some smokes.\"\n\nMorey rose and went to the door that led through the main passage to the\ngalley. \"Heck of a job--no weight at all,\" he muttered. \"There is air in\nthe passage, anyway.\" He opened the door, and the air rushed from the\ncontrol room to the passage till the pressure was equalized. The door to\nthe power room was shut, but it was bulged, despite its two-inch lux\nmetal, and through its clear material he could see the wreckage of the\npower room.\n\n\"Arcot,\" he called. \"Come here and look at the power room. Quintillions\nof miles from home, we can't shut off this field now.\"\n\nArcot was with him in a moment. The tremendous mass of the nose of the\nThessian ship had caught them full amid-ship, and the powerful ram had\ndriven through the room. Their lux walls had not been touched; only a\nsledge-hammer blow would have bent them under any circumstances, let\nalone breaking them. But the tremendously powerful main generator was\nsplit wide open. And the mechanical damage was awful. The prow of the\nship had been driven deep into the machine, and the power room was a\nwreck.\n\n\"And,\" pointed out Morey, \"we can't handle a job like that. It will take\na tremendous amount of machinery back on a planet to work that stuff,\nand we couldn't bend that bar, let alone fix it.\"\n\n\"Get the coffee, will you please, Morey? I have an idea that's bound to\nwork,\" said Arcot looking fixedly at the machinery.\n\nMorey turned and went to the galley.\n\nFive minutes later they returned to the corridor, where Arcot stood\nstill, looking fixedly at the engine room. They were carrying small\nplastic balloons with coffee in them.\n\nThey drank the coffee and returned to the control room, and sat about,\nthe terrestrians smoking peacefully, the Ortolian and the Talsonian\nsatisfying themselves with some form of mild narcotic from Ortol, which\nZezdon Afthen introduced.\n\n\"Well, we have a lot more to do,\" Arcot said. \"The air-apparatus stopped\nworking a while back, and I don't want to sit around doing nothing while\nthe air in the storage tanks is used up. Did you notice our friends, the\nenemy?\" Through the great pilot's window the bulk of the Thessian ship's\nbow could be seen. It was cut across with an exactitude of mathematical\ncertainty.\n\n\"Easy to guess what happened,\" Morey grinned. \"They may have wrecked us,\nbut we sure wrecked them. They got half in and half out of our space\nfield. Result--the half that was in, stayed in. The half that was out\nstayed out. The two halves were instantaneously a billion miles apart,\nand that beautifully exact surface represents the point our space cut\nacross.\n\n\"That being decided, the next question is how to fix this poor old\nwreck.\" Morey grinned a bit. \"Better, how to get out of here, and down\nto old Neptune.\"\n\n\"Fix it!\" replied Arcot. \"Come on; you get in your space suit, take the\nportable telectroscope and set it up in space, motionless, in such a\nposition that it views both our ship and the nose of the Thessian\nmachine, will you, Wade? Tune it to--seven-seven-three.\" Morey rose with\nArcot, and followed him, somewhat mystified, down the passage. At the\nairlock Wade put on his space suit, and the Ortolian helped him with it.\nIn a moment the other three men appeared bearing the machine. It was\npractically weightless, though it would fall slowly if left to itself,\nfor the mass of the _Ancient Mariner_ and the front end of the Thessian\nship made a considerable attractive field. But it was clumsy, and needed\nguiding here in the ship.\n\nWade took it into the airlock, and a moment later into space with him.\nHis hand molecular-driving unit pulling him, he towed the machine into\nplace, and with some difficulty got it practically motionless with\nrespect of the two bodies, which were now lying against each other.\n\n\"Turn it a bit, Wade, so that the _Ancient Mariner_ is just in its\nrange,\" came Arcot's thoughts. Wade did so. \"Come on back and watch the\nfun.\"\n\nWade returned. Arcot and the others were busy placing a heavy emergency\nlead from the storeroom in the place of one of the broken leads. In five\nminutes they had it fixed where they wanted it.\n\nInto the control room went Arcot, and started the power-room teleview\nplate. Connected into the system of view plates, the scene was visible\nnow on all the plates in the ship. Well off to one side of the room,\nprepared for such emergencies, and equipped with individual power\nstorage coils that would run it for several days, the view plate\nfunctioned smoothly.\n\n\"Now, we are ready,\" said Arcot. The Talsonian proved he understood\nArcot's intentions by preceding him to the laboratory.\n\nArcot had two viewplates operating here. One was covering the scene as\nshown by the machine outside, and the other showed the power room.\n\nArcot stepped over to the artificial-matter machine, and worked swiftly\non it. In a moment the power from the storage coils of the ship was\nflowing through the new cable, and into the machine. A huge ring\nappeared about the nose of the Thessian ship, fitting snugly over it. A\nterrific wrench--and it was free of the _Ancient Mariner_. The ring\ncontracted and formed a chunk of the stuff free of the broken nose of\nthe ship.\n\nIt was carried over to the wall of the _Ancient Mariner_, a smaller\npiece snipped off as before, and carried inside. A piece of perhaps half\na ton mass. \"I hope they use good stuff,\" grinned Arcot. The piece was\ndeposited on the floor of the ship, and a disc formed of artificial\nmatter plugged the hole in its side. Another took a piece of the relux\nfrom the broken Thessian ship, pushed it into the hole on the ship. The\nspace about the scene of operation was a crackling inferno of energy\nbreaking down into heat and light. Arcot dematerialized his tremendous\ntools, and the wall of the _Ancient Mariner_ was neatly patched with\nrelux smoothed over as perfectly as before. A second time, using some of\nthe relux he had brought within the ship, and the inner wall was\nrebuilt. The job was absolutely perfect, save that now, where there had\nbeen lux, there was an outer wall of relux.\n\nThe main generator was crumpled up, and torn out. The auxiliary\ngenerators would have to carry the load. The great cables were swiftly\nrepaired in the same manner, a perfect cylinder forming about them, and\na piece of relux from the store Arcot had sliced from the enemy ship,\nwelding them perfectly under enormous pressure, pressure that made them\nflow perfectly into one another as heat alone could not.\n\nIn less than half an hour the ship was patched up, the power room\ngenerally repaired, save for a few minor things that had to be replaced\nfrom the stores. The main generator was gone, but that was not an\nessential. The door was straightened and the job done.\n\nIn an hour they were ready to proceed.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\nINTERGALACTIC SPACE\n\n\n\"Well, Sirius has retreated a bit,\" observed Arcot. The star was indeed\nseveral trillions of miles away. Evidently they had not been motionless\nas they had thought, but the interference of the Thessian ship had\nthrown their machine off.\n\n\"Shall we go back, or go on?\" asked Morey.\n\n\"The ship works. Why return?\" asked Wade. \"I vote we go on.\"\n\n\"Seconded,\" added Arcot.\n\n\"If they who know most of the ship vote for a continuance of the\njourney, then assuredly we who know so little can only abide by their\njudgment. Let us continue,\" said Zezdon Afthen gravely.\n\nSpace was suddenly black about them. Sirius was gone, all the jewels of\nthe heavens were gone in the black of swift flight. Ten seconds later\nArcot lowered the space-control. Black behind them the night of space\nwas pricked by points of light, the infinite multitude of the stars.\nBefore them lay--nothing. The utter emptiness of space between the\ngalaxies.\n\n\"Thlek Styrs! What happened?\" asked Morey in amazement, his pet Venerian\nphrase rolling out in his astonishment.\n\n\"Tried an experiment, and it was overly successful,\" replied Arcot, a\nworried look on his face. \"I tried combining the Thessian high speed\n_time_ distortion with our high _speed_ space distortion--both on low\npower. 'There ain't no sich animals,' as the old agriculturist remarked\nof the giraffe. God knows what speed we hit, but it was plenty. We must\nbe ten thousand light years beyond the galaxy.\"\n\n\"That's a fine way to start the trip. You have the old star maps to get\nback however, have you not?\" asked Wade.\n\n\"Yes, the maps we made on our first trip out this way are in the\ncabinet. Look 'em up, will you, and see how far we have to go before we\nreach the cosmic fields?\"\n\nArcot was busy with his instruments, making a more accurate\ndetermination of their distance from the \"edge\" of the galaxy. He\nadopted the figure of twelve thousand five hundred light years as the\nprobable best result. Wade was back in a moment with the information\nthat the fields lay about sixteen thousand light years out. Arcot went\non, at a rate that would reach the fields in two hours.\n\nSeveral hours more were spent in measurements, till at last Arcot\nannounced himself satisfied.\n\n\"Good enough--back we go.\" Again in the control room, he threw on the\ndrive, and shot through the twenty-seven thousand light years of cosmic\nray fields, and then more leisurely returned to the galaxy. The star\nmaps were strangely off. They could follow them, but only with\ndifficulty as the general configuration of the constellations that were\ntheir guides were visibly altered to the naked eye.\n\n\"Morey,\" said Arcot softly, looking at the constellation at which they\nwere then aiming, and at the map before him, \"there is something very,\nvery rotten. The Universe either 'ain't what it used to be' or we have\ntraveled in more than space.\"\n\n\"I know it, and I agree with you. Obviously, from the degree of\nalteration off the constellations, we are off by about 100,000 years.\nQuestion: how come? Question: what are we going to do about it?\"\n\n\"Answer one: remembering what we observed _in re_ Sirius, I suspect that\nthe interference of that Thessian ship, with its time-field opposing our\nspace-field did things to our time-frame. We were probably thrown off\nthen.\n\n\"As to the second question, we have to determine number one first. Then\nwe can plan our actions.\"\n\nWith Wade's help, and by coming to rest near several of the stars, then\nobserving their actual motions, they were able to determine their\ntime-status. The estimate they made finally was of the order of eighty\nthousand years in the past! The Thessian ship had thrown them that much\nout of their time.\n\n\"This isn't all to the bad,\" said Morey with a sigh. \"We at least have\nall the time we could possibly use to determine the things we want for\nthis fight. We might even do a lot of exploring for the archeologists of\nEarth and Venus and Ortol and Talso. As to getting back--that's a\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Which is,\" added Arcot, \"easy to answer now, thank the good Lord. All\nwe have to do is wait for our time to catch up with us. If we just wait\neighty thousand years, eight hundred centuries, we will be in our own\ntime.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think waiting so long would be boring,\" said Wade sarcastically.\n\"What do you suggest we do in the intervening eighty millenniums? Play\ncards?\"\n\n\"Oh, cards or chess. Something like that,\" grinned Arcot. \"Play cards,\ncalculate our fields--and turn on the time rate control.\"\n\n\"Oh--I take it back. You win! Take all! I forgot all about that,\" Wade\nsmiled at his friend. \"That will save a little waiting, won't it.\"\n\n\"The exploring of our worlds would without doubt be of infinite benefit\nto science, but I wonder if it would not be of more direct benefit if we\nwere to get back to our own time, alive and well. Accidents always\nhappen, and for all our weapons, we might easily meet some animal which\nwould put an abrupt and tragic finish to our explorations. Is it not\nso?\" asked Stel Felso Theu.\n\n\"Your point is good, Stel Felso Theu. I agree with you. We will do no\nmore exploring than is necessary, or safe.\"\n\n\"We might just as well travel slowly on the time retarder, and work on\nthe way. I think the thing to do is to go back to Earth, or better, the\nsolar system, and follow the sun in its path.\"\n\nThey returned, and the desolation that the sun in its journey passes\nthrough is nothing to the utter, oppressive desolation of empty space\nbetween the stars, for it has its family of planets--and it has no\nconscious thought.\n\nThe Sun was far from the point that it had occupied when the travelers\nhad left it, billions on billions of miles further on its journey around\nthe gravitational center of our galactic universe, and in the eighty\nmillenniums that they must wait, it would go far.\n\nThey did not go to the planets now, for, as Arcot said in reply to Stel\nFelso Theu's suggestion that they determine more accurately their\nposition in time, life had not developed to an extent that would enable\nthem to determine the year according to our calendar.\n\nSo for thirty thousand years they hung motionless as the sun moved on,\nand the little spots of light, that were worlds, hurled about it in a\nmad race. Even Pluto, in its three-hundred-year-long track seemed madly\ngyrating beneath them; Mercury was a line of light, as it swirled about\nthe swiftly moving sun.\n\nBut that thirty thousand years was thirty days to the men of the ship.\nTheir time rate immensely retarded, they worked on their calculations.\nAt the end of that month Arcot had, with the help of Morey and Wade,\nworked out the last of the formulas of artificial matter, and the\nmachines had turned out the last graphical function of the last branch\nof research that they could discover. It was a time of labor for them,\nand they worked almost constantly, stopping occasionally for a game of\nsome sort to relax the nervous tension.\n\nAt the end of that month they decided that they would go to Earth.\n\nThey speeded their time rate now, and flashed toward Earth at enormous\nspeed that brought them within the atmosphere in minutes. They had\nlanded in the valley of the Nile. Arcot had suggested this as a means of\ndetermining the advancement of life of man. Man had evidently\nestablished some of his earliest civilizations in this valley where\nwater and sun for his food plants were assured.\n\n\"Look--there _are_ men here!\" exclaimed Wade. Indeed, below them were\nvillages, of crude huts made of timber and stone and mud. Rubble work\nwalls, for they needed little shelter here, and the people were but\nsavages.\n\n\"Shall we land?\" asked Arcot, his voice a bit unsteady with suppressed\nexcitement.\n\n\"Of course!\" replied Morey without turning from his station at the\nwindow. Below them now, less than half a mile down on the patchwork of\nthe Nile valley, men were standing, staring up, collecting in little\ngroups, gesticulating toward the strange thing that had materialized in\nthe air above them.\n\n\"Does every one agree that we land?\" asked Arcot.\n\nThere were no dissenting voices, and the ship sank gently toward a road\nbelow and to the left. A little knot of watchers broke, and they fled in\nterror as the great machine approached, crying out to their friends,\ncasting affrighted glances at the huge, shining monster behind them.\n\nWithout a jar the mighty weight of the ship touched the soil of its\nnative planet, touched it fifty millenniums before it was made, five\nhundred centuries before it left!\n\nArcot's brow furrowed. \"There is one thing puzzles me--I can't see how\nwe can come back. Don't you see, Morey, we have disturbed the lives of\nthose people. We have affected history. This must be written into the\nhistory that exists.\n\n\"This seems to banish the idea of free thought. We have changed history,\nyet history is that which is already done!\n\n\"Had I never been born, had--but I _was_ already--I existed fifty-eighty\nthousand years before I was born!\"\n\n\"Let's go out and think about that later. We'll go to a psych hospital,\nif we don't stop thinking about problems of space and time for a little\nwhile. We need some kind of relaxation.\"\n\n\"I suggest that we take our weapons with us. These men may have weapons\nof chemical nature, such as poisons injected into the flesh on small\nsticks hurled either by a spring device or by pneumatic pressure of the\nlungs,\" said Stel Felso Theu as he rose from his seat unstrapping\nhimself.\n\n\"Arrows and blow-guns we call 'em. But it's a good idea, Stel Felso, and\nI think we will,\" replied Arcot. \"Let's not all go out at once, and the\nfirst group to go out goes out on foot, so they won't be scared off by\nour flying around.\"\n\nArcot, Wade, Zezdon Afthen, and Stel Felso Theu went out. The natives\nhad retreated to a respectful distance, and were now standing about,\nlooking on, chattering to themselves. They were edging nearer.\n\n\"Growing bold,\" grinned Wade.\n\n\"It is the characteristic of intelligent races manifesting\nitself--curiosity,\" pointed out Stel Felso Theu.\n\n\"Are these the type of men still living in this valley, or who will be\nliving there in fifty thousand years?\" asked Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"I'd say they weren't Egyptians as we know them, but typical Neolithic\nmen. It seems they have brains fully as large as some of the men I see\non the streets of New York. I wonder if they have the ability to learn\nas much as the average man of--say about 1950?\"\n\nThe Neolithic men were warming up. There was an orator among them, and\nhis grunts, growls, snorts and gestures were evidently affecting them.\nThey had sent the women back (by the simple and direct process of\nsweeping them up in one arm and heaving them in the general direction of\nhome). The men were brandishing polished stone knives and axes, various\ninstruments of war and peace. One favorite seemed to be a large club.\n\n\"Let's forestall trouble,\" suggested Arcot. He drew his ray pistol, and\nturned it on the ground directly in front of them, and about halfway\nbetween them and the Neoliths. A streak of the soil about two feet wide\nflashed into intense radiation under the impact of millions on millions\nof horsepower of radiant energy. Further, it was fused to a depth of\ntwenty feet or more, and intensely hot still deeper. The Neoliths took a\nsingle look at it, then turned, and raced for home.\n\n\"Didn't like our looks. Let's go back.\"\n\nThey wandered about the world, investigating various peoples, and proved\nto their own satisfaction that there was no Atlantis, not at this time\nat any rate. But they were interested in seeing that the polar caps\nextended much farther toward the equator; they had not retreated at that\ntime to the extent that they had by the opening of history.\n\nThey secured some fresh game, an innovation in their larder, and a\nwelcome one. Then the entire ship was swept out with fresh, clean air,\ntheir water tanks filled with water from the cold streams of the melting\nglaciers. The air apparatus was given a new stock to work over.\n\nTheir supplies in a large measure restored, thousands of aerial\nphotographic maps made, they returned once more to space to wait.\n\nTheir time was taken up for the most part by actual work on the enormous\nmass of calculation necessary. It is inconceivable to the layman what\ntremendous labor is involved in the development of a single mathematical\nhypothesis, and a concrete illustration of it was the long time, with\ntremendously advanced calculating machines, that was required in their\npresent work.\n\nThey had worked out the problem of the time-field, but there they had\nbeen aided by the actual apparatus, and the possibilities of making\ndirect tests on machines already set up. The problem of artificial\nmatter, at length fully solved, was a different matter. This had\nrequired within a few days of a month (by their clocks; close to thirty\nthousand years of Earth's time), for they had really been forced to\ndevelop it all from the beginning. In the small improvements Arcot had\ninstituted in Stel Felso Theu's device, he had really merely followed\nthe particular branch that Stel Felso Theu had stumbled upon. Hence it\nwas impossible to determine with any great variety, the type of matter\ncreated. Now, however, Arcot could make any known kind of matter, and\nmany unknown kinds.\n\nBut now came the greatest problem of all. They were ready to start work\non the data they had collected in space.\n\n\"What,\" asked Zezdon Afthen, as he watched the three terrestrians begin\ntheir work, \"is the nature of the thing you are attempting to harness?\"\n\n\"In a word, energy,\" replied Arcot, pausing.\n\n\"We are attempting to harness energy in its primeval form, in the form\nof a space-field. Remember, mass is a measure of energy. Two centuries\nago a scientist of our world proposed the idea that energy could be\nmeasured by mass, and proceeded to prove that the relationship was the\nnow firmly intrenched formula E=Mc^{2}.\n\n\"The sun is giving off energy. It is giving off mass, then, in the form\nof light photons. The field of the sun's gravity must be constantly\ndecreasing as its mass decreases. It is a collapsing field. It is true,\nthe sun's gravitational field does decrease, by a minute amount, despite\nthe fact that our sun loses a thousand million tons of matter every four\nminutes. The percentage change is minute, but the energy released\nis--immeasurable.\n\n\"But, I am going to invent a new power unit, Afthen. I will call it the\n'sol,' the power of a sun. One sol is the rating of our sun. And I will\nmeasure the energy I use in terms of sun-powers, not horsepower. That\nmay tell you of its magnitude!\"\n\n\"But,\" Zezdon Afthen asked, \"while you men of Earth work on this\nproblem, what is there for us? We have no problems, save the problem of\nthe fate of our world, still fifty thousand years of your time in the\nfuture. It is terrible to wait, wait, wait and think of what may be\nhappening in that other time. Is there nothing we can do to help? I know\nour hopeless ignorance of your science. Stel Felso Theu can scarcely\nunderstand the thoughts you use, and I can scarcely understand his\nexplanations! I cannot help you there, with your calculations, but is\nthere nothing I can do?\"\n\n\"There is, Ortolian, decidedly. We badly need your help, and as Stel\nFelso Theu cannot aid us here as much as he can by working with you, I\nwill ask him to do so. I want your knowledge of psycho-mechanical\ndevices to help us. Will you make a machine controlled by mental\nimpulses? I want to see such a system and know how it is done that I may\ncontrol machines by such a system.\"\n\n\"Gladly. It will take time, for I am not the expert worker that you are,\nand I must make many pieces of apparatus, but I will do what I can,\"\nexclaimed Zezdon Afthen eagerly.\n\nSo, while Arcot and his group continued their work of determining the\nconstants of the space-energy field, the others were working on the\nmental control apparatus.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\nALL-POWERFUL GODS\n\n\nAgain there was a period of intense labor, while the ship drifted\nthrough time, following Earth in its mad careening about the sun, and\nthe sun as it rushed headlong through space. At the end of a thirty-day\nperiod, they had reached no definite position in their calculations, and\nthe Talsonian reported, as a medium between the two parties of\nscientists, that the work of the Ortolian had not reached a level that\nwould make a scientific understanding possible.\n\nAs the ship needed no replenishing, they determined to finish their\npresent work before landing, and it was nearly forty thousand years\nafter their first arrival that they again landed on Earth.\n\nIt was changed now; the ice caps had retreated visibly, the Nile delta\nwas far longer, far more prominent, and cities showed on the Earth here\nand there.\n\nGreece, they decided would be the next stop, and to Greece they went,\nlanding on a mountain side. Below was a village, a small village, a\nsmall thing of huts and hovels. But the villagers attacked, swarming up\nthe hillside furiously, shouting and shrieking warnings of their\nterrible prowess to these men who came from the \"shining house,\"\nordering them to flee from them and turn over their possession to them.\n\n\"What'll we do?\" asked Morey. He and Arcot had come out alone this time.\n\n\"Take one of these fellows back with us, and question him. We had best\nget a more or less definite idea of what time-age we are in, hadn't we?\nWe don't want to overshoot by a few centuries, you know!\"\n\nThe villagers were swarming up the side of the hill, armed with weapons\nof bronze and wood. The bronze implements of murder were rare, and\nevidently costly, for those that had them were obviously leaders, and\nbetter dressed than the others.\n\n\"Hang it all, I have only a molecular pistol. Can't use that, it would\nbe a plain massacre!\" exclaimed Arcot.\n\nBut suddenly several others, who had come up from one side, appeared\nfrom behind a rock. The scientists were wearing their power suits, and\nhad them on at low power, leaving a weight of about fifty pounds. Morey,\nwith his normal weight well over two hundred, jumped far to one side of\na clumsy rush of a peasant, leaped back, and caught him from behind.\nLifting the smaller man above his head, he hurled him at two others\nfollowing. The three went down in a heap.\n\nMost of the men were about five feet tall, and rather lightly built. The\n\"Greek God\" had not yet materialized among them. They were probably\npoorly fed, and heavily worked. Only the leaders appeared to be in good\nphysical condition, and the men could not develop to large stature.\nArcot and Morey were giants among them, and with their greater skill,\ntremendous jumping ability, and far greater strength, easily overcame\nthe few who had come by the side. One of the leaders was picked up, and\ntrussed quickly in a rope a fellow had carried.\n\n\"Look out,\" called Wade from above. Suddenly he was standing beside\nthem, having flown down on the power suit. \"Caught your thoughts--rather\nZezdon Afthen did.\" He handed Arcot a ray pistol. The rest of the Greeks\nwere near now, crying in amazement, and running more slowly. They didn't\nseem so anxious to attack. Arcot turned the ray pistol to one side.\n\n\"Wait!\" called Morey. A face peered from around the rock toward which\nArcot had aimed his pistol. It was that of a girl, about fifteen years\nold in appearance, but hard work had probably aged her face. Morey bent\nover, heaved on a small boulder, about two hundred pounds of rock, and\nrolled it free of the depression it rested in, then caught it on a\nmolecular ray, hurled it up. Arcot turned his heat ray on it for an\ninstant, and it was white hot. Then the molecular ray threw it over\ntoward the great rock, and crushed it against it. Three children\nshrieked and ran out from the rock, scurrying down the hillside.\n\nThe soldiers had stopped. They looked at Morey. Then they looked at the\ngreat rock, three hundred yards from him. They looked at the rock\nfragments.\n\n\"They think you threw it,\" grinned Arcot.\n\n\"What else--they saw me pick it up, saw me roll it, and it flew. What\nelse could they think?\"\n\nArcot's heat ray hissed out, and the rocks sputtered and cracked, then\nglowed white. There was a dull explosion, and chips of rock flew up.\nWater, imprisoned, had been turned into steam. In a moment the whistle\nand crackle of combined heat and molecular rays stabbing out from\nArcot's hands had built a barrier of fused rocks.\n\nLeisurely Arcot and Morey carried their now revived prisoner back to the\nship, while Wade flew ahead to open the locks.\n\nHalf an hour later the prisoner was discharged, much to his surprise,\nand the ship rose. They had been able to learn nothing from him. Even\nthe Greek Gods, Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, all the later Greek gods, were\nunknown, or so greatly changed that Arcot could not recognize them.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at length, \"it seems all we know is that they came\nbefore any historical Greeks we know of. That puts them back quite a\nbit, but I don't know how far. Shall we go see the Egyptians?\"\n\nThey tried Egypt, a few moments across the Mediterranean, landing close\nto the mouth of the Nile. The people of a village near by immediately\nset out after them. Better prepared this time, Arcot flew out to meet\nthem with Zezdon Afthen and Stel Felso Theu. Surely, he felt, the sight\nof the strange men would be no more terrifying than the ship or the men\nflying. And that did not seem to deter their attack. Apparently the\nproverb that \"Discretion is the better part of valor,\" had not been\ninvented.\n\nArcot landed near the head of the column, and cut off two or three men\nfrom the rest with the aid of his ray pistol. Zezdon Afthen quickly\nsearched his mind, and with Arcot's aid they determined he did not know\nany of the Gods that Arcot suggested.\n\nFinally they had to return to the ship, disappointed. They had had the\nslight satisfaction of finding that the Sun God was Ralz, the later\nEgyptian Ra might well have been an evolved form of that name.\n\nThey restocked the ship, fresh game and fruits again appearing on the\nmenu, then once again they launched forth into space to wait for their\nown time.\n\n\"It seems to me that we must have produced some effect by our visit,\"\nsaid Arcot, shaking his head solemnly.\n\n\"We did, Arcot,\" replied Morey softly. \"We left an impress in history,\nan impress that still is, and an impress that affected countless\nthousands.\n\n\"Meet the Egyptian Gods with their heads strange to terrestrians, the\nGods who fly through the air without wings, come from a shining house\nthat flies, whose look, whose pointed finger melts the desert sands, and\nthe moist soil!\" he continued softly, nodding toward the Ortolian and\nthe Talsonian.\n\n\"Their 'impossible' Gods existed, and visited them. Indubitably some\ngenius saw that here was a chance for fame and fortune and sold 'charms'\nagainst the 'Gods.' Result: we are carrying with us some of the oldest\ndeities. Again, we did leave our imprint in history.\"\n\n\"And,\" cried Wade excitedly, \"meet the great Hercules, who threw men\nabout. I always knew that Morey was a brainless brute, but I never\nrealized the marvelous divining powers of those Greeks so\nperfectly--now, the Incarnation of Dumb Power!\" Dramatically Wade\npointed to Morey, unable even now to refrain from some unnecessary\ncomments.\n\n\"All right, Mercury, the messenger of the Gods speaks. The little flaps\non Wade's flying shoes must indeed have looked like the winged shoes of\nlegend. Wade was Mercury, too brainless for anything but carrying the\nwords of wisdom uttered by others.\n\n\"And Arcot,\" continued Morey, releasing Wade from his condescending\nstare, \"is Jove, hurling the rockfusing, destroying thunderbolts!\"\n\n\"The Gods that my friends have been talking of,\" explained Arcot to the\ncurious Ortolians, \"are legendary deities of Earth. I can see now that\nwe did leave an imprint on history in the only way we could--as Gods,\nfor surely no other explanation could have occurred to those men.\"\n\nThe days passed swiftly in the ship, as their work approached\ncompletion. Finally, when the last of the equation of Time, artificial\nmatter, and the most awful of their weapons, the unlimited Cosmic Power,\nhad been calculated, they fell to the last stage of the work. The actual\nappliances were designed. Then the completed apparatus that the Ortolian\nand the Talsonian had been working on, was carefully investigated by the\nterrestrial physicists, and its mechanism studied. Arcot had great plans\nfor this, and now it was incorporated in their control apparatus.\n\nThe one remaining problem was their exact location in time. Already\ntheir progress had brought them well up to the nineteenth century, but,\nas Morey sadly remarked, they couldn't tell what date, for they were\nsadly lacking in history. Had they known the real date, for instance, of\nthe famous battle of Bull Run, they could have watched it in the\ntelectroscope, and so determined their time. As it was, they knew only\nthat it was one of the periods of the first half of the decade of 1860.\n\n\"As historians, we're a bunch of first-class kitchen mechanics. Looks\nlike we're due for another landing to locate the exact date,\" agreed\nArcot.\n\n\"Why land now? Let's wait until we are nearer the time to which we\nbelong, so we won't have to watch so carefully and so long,\" suggested\nWade.\n\nThey argued this question for about two hundred years as a matter of\nfact. After that, it was academic anyway.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\nHOME AGAIN\n\n\nThey were getting very near their own time, Arcot felt. Indeed, they\nmust already exist on Earth. \"One thing that puzzles me,\" he commented,\n\"is what would happen if we were to go down now, and see ourselves.\"\n\n\"Either we can't or we don't want to do it,\" pointed out Morey, \"because\nwe didn't.\"\n\n\"I think the answer is that nothing can exist two times at the same\ntime-rate,\" said Arcot. \"As long as we were in a different time-rate we\ncould exist at two times. When we tried to exist simultaneously, we\ncould not, and we were forced to slip through time to a time wherein we\neither did not exist or wherein we had not yet been. Since we were\nnearer the time when we last existed in normal time, than we were to the\ntime of our birth, we went to the time we left. I suspect that we will\nfind we have just left Earth. Shall we investigate?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, Arcot, and here's hoping we didn't overshoot the mark by\nmuch.\" As Morey intimated, had they gone much beyond the time they left\nEarth, they might find conditions very serious, indeed. But now they\nwent at once toward Earth on the time control. As they neared, they\nlooked anxiously for signs of the invasion. Arcot spotted the only\nevident signs, however; two large spheres, tiny points in appearance on\nthe telectroscope screen, were circling Earth, one at about 1,000 miles,\nmoving from east to west, the other about 1,200 miles moving from north\nto south.\n\n\"It seems the enemy have retreated to space to do their fighting. I\nwonder how long we were away.\"\n\nAs they swept down at a speed greater than light, they were invisible\ntill Arcot slowed down near the atmosphere. Instantly half a dozen fast\nships darted toward them, but the ship was very evidently unlike the\nThessian ships, and no attack was made. First the occupants would have\nan opportunity to prove their friendliness.\n\n\"Terrestrians Arcot, Morey and Wade reporting back from exploration in\nspace, with two friends. All have been on Earth with us previously,\"\nsaid Arcot into the radio vision apparatus.\n\n\"Very well, Dr. Arcot. You are going to New York or Vermont?\" asked the\nPatrol commander.\n\n\"Vermont.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir. I'll see that you aren't stopped again.\"\n\nAnd, thanks to the message thus sent ahead, they were not, and in less\nthan half an hour they landed once more in Vermont, on the field from\nwhich they had started.\n\nThe group of scientists who had been here on their last call had gone,\nwhich seemed natural enough to them, who had been working for three\nmonths in the interval of their trip, but to Dr. Arcot senior, as he saw\nthem, it was a misfortune.\n\n\"Now I never will get straight all you'll have ready, and I didn't\nexpect you back till next week. The men have all gone back to their\nlaboratories, since that permits of better work on the part of each, but\nwe can call them here in half an hour. I'm sure they'll want to come.\nWhat did you learn, Son, or haven't you done any calculating on your\ndata as yet?\"\n\n\"We learned plenty, and I feel quite sure that a hint of what we have\nwould bring all those learning-hounds around us pretty quickly, Dad,\"\nlaughed Arcot junior, \"and believe it or not, we've been calculating on\nthis stuff for three months since we left yesterday!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Yes, it's true! We were on our time field, and turned on the space\ncontrol--and a Thessian ship picked that moment to run into us. We cut\nthe ship in half as neatly as you please, but it threw us eighty\nthousand years into the past. We have been coasting through time on\nretarded rate while Earth caught up with itself, so to speak. In the\nmeantime--three months in a day!\n\n\"But don't call those men. Let them come to the appointment, while we do\nsome work, and we have plenty of work to do, I assure you. We have a\nlist of things to order from the standard supply houses, and I think you\nbetter get them for us, Dad.\" Arcot's manner became serious now. \"We\nhaven't gotten our Government Expense Research Cards yet, and you have.\nOrder the stuff, and get it out here, while we get ready for it.\nHonestly, I believe that a few ships such as this apparatus will permit,\nwill be enough in themselves to do the job. It really is a pity that the\nother men didn't have the opportunity we had for crowding much work into\nlittle time!\n\n\"But then, I wouldn't want to take that road to concentration again\nmyself!\n\n\"Have the enemy amused you in my absence? Come on, let's sit down in the\nhouse instead of standing here in the sun.\"\n\nThey started toward the house, as Arcot senior explained what had\nhappened in the short time they had been away.\n\n\"There is a friend of yours here, whom you haven't seen in some time,\nSon. He came with some allies.\"\n\nAs they entered the house, they could hear the boards creak under some\nheavy weight that moved across the floor, soundlessly and light of\nmotion in itself. A shadow fell across the hall floor, and in the\ndoorway a tremendously powerfully-built figure stood.\n\nHe seemed to overflow the doorway, nearly six and a half feet tall, and\nfully as wide as the door. His rugged, bronzed face was smiling\npleasantly, and his deep-set eyes seemed to flash; a living force flowed\nfrom them.\n\n\"Torlos! By the Nine Planets! Torlos of Nansal! Say, I didn't expect you\nhere, and I will not put my hand in that meatgrinder of yours,\" grinned\nArcot happily, as Torlos stretched forth a friendly, but quite too\npowerful hand.\n\nTorlos of Nansal, that planet Arcot had discovered on his first voyage\nacross space, far in another Island of Space, another Island Universe,\nwas not constructed as are human beings of Earth, nor of Venus, Talso,\nor Ortol, but most nearly resembled, save in size, the Thessians. Their\nframework, instead of being stone, as is ours, was iron, their bones\nwere pure metallic iron, far stronger than bone. On these far stronger\nbones were great muscles of an entirely different sort, a muscle that\nused heat of the body as its fuel, a muscle that was utterly tireless,\nand unbelievably powerful. Not a chemical engine, but a molecular motion\nengine, it had no chemical fatigue-products that would tire it, and\nneeded only the constant heat supply the body sucked from the air to\nwork indefinitely. Unlimited by waste-carrying considerations, the\nstrength was enormous.\n\nIt was one of the commercial space freighters plying between Nansal,\nSator, Earth and Venus that had brought the news of this war to him,\nTorlos explained, and he, as the new Trade Coordinator and Fourth of the\nFour who now ruled Nansal, had suggested that they go to the aid of the\nman who had so aided them in their great war with Sator. It was Arcot's\ngift of the secret of the molecular ray and the molecular ship that had\nenabled them to overcome their enemy of centuries, and force upon them\nan unwelcome peace.\n\nNow, with a fleet of fifty interstellar, or better, intergalactic\nbattleships, Nansal was coming to Earth's aid.\n\nThe battleships were now on patrol with all of Earth's and Venus' fleet.\nBut the Nansalian ships were all equipped with the enormously rapid\nspace distortion system of travel, of course, and were a shock troop in\nthe patrol. The Terrestrian and Venerian patrols were not so equipped in\nfull.\n\n\"And Arcot, from what I have learned from your father, it seems that I\ncan be of real assistance,\" finished Torlos.\n\n\"But now, I think, I should know what the enemy has done. I see they\nbuilt some forts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Arcot senior, \"they did. They decided that the system\nused on the forts of North and South poles was too effective. They moved\nto space, and cut off slices of Luna, pulled it over on their molecular\nrays, and used some of the most magnificent apparatus you ever dreamed\nof. I have just started working on the mathematics of it.\n\n\"We sent out a fleet to do some investigating, but they attacked, and\nstopped work in the meantime. Whatever the ray is that can destroy\nmatter at a distance, they are afraid that we could find its secret too\neasily, and block it, for they don't think it is a weapon, and it is\nevidently slow in action.\"\n\n\"Then it isn't what I thought it was,\" muttered Arcot.\n\n\"What did you think it was?\" asked his father.\n\n\"Er--tell you later. Go on with the account.\"\n\n\"Well, to continue. We have not been idle. Following your suggestion, we\nbuilt up a large ray screen apparatus, in fact, several of them, and\ncarried them in ships to different parts of the world. Also some of the\nplanets, lest they start dropping worlds on us. They are already in\noperation, sending their defensive waves against the Heaviside layer.\nRadio is poor, over any distance, and we can't call Venus from inside\nthe layer now. However, we tested the protection, and it works--far more\nefficiently than we calculated, due to the amazing conductivity of the\nlayer.\n\n\"If they intend to attack in that way, I suspect that it will be soon,\nfor they are ready now, as we discovered. An attack on their fort was\nmet with a ray screen from the fort.\n\n\"They fight with a wild viciousness now. They won't let a ship get near\nthem. They destroy everything on sight. They seem tremendously afraid of\nthat apparatus of yours. Too bad we had no more.\"\n\n\"We will have--if you will let me get to work.\"\n\nThey went to the ship, and entered it. Arcot senior did not follow, but\nthe others waited, while the ship left Earth once more, and floated in\nspace. Immediately they went into the time-field.\n\nThey worked steadily, sleeping when necessary, and the giant strength of\nTorlos was frequently as great an asset as his indefatigable work. He\nwas learning rapidly, and was able to do a great deal of the work\nwithout direction. He was not a scientist, and the thing was new to him,\nbut his position as one of the best of the secret intelligence force of\nNansal had proven his brains, and he did his share.\n\nThe others, scientists all, found the operations difficult, for work had\nbeen allotted to each according to his utmost capabilities.\n\nIt was still nearly a week of their time before the apparatus was\ncompleted to the extent possible, less than a minute of normal time\npassing.\n\nFinally the unassembled, but completed apparatus, was carried to the\nlaboratory of the cottage, and word was sent to all the men of Earth\nthat Arcot was going to give a demonstration of the apparatus he hoped\nwould save them. The scientists from all over Earth and Venus were\ninterested, and those of Earth came, for there was no time for the men\nof Venus to arrive to inspect the results.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\nPOWER OF MIND\n\n\nIt was night. The stars visible through the laboratory windows winked\nviolently in the disturbed air of the Heaviside layer, for the molecular\nray screen was still up.\n\nThe laboratory was dimly lighted now, all save the front of the room.\nThere, a mass of compact boxes were piled one on another, and\ninterconnected in various and indeterminate ways. And one table lay in a\nbrilliant path of illumination. Behind it stood Arcot. He was talking to\nthe dim white group of faces beyond the table, the scientists of Earth\nassembled.\n\n\"I have explained our power. It is the power of all the universe--Cosmic\nPower--which is necessarily vaster than all others combined.\n\n\"I cannot explain the control in the time I have at my disposal but the\nmathematics of it, worked out in two months of constant effort, you can\nfollow from the printed work which will appear soon.\n\n\"The second thing, which some of you have seen before, has already been\npartly explained. It is, in brief, artificially created matter. The two\nimportant things to remember about it are that it _is_, that it _does\nexist_, and that it exists _only where it is determined to exist by the\ncontrol there, and nowhere else_.\n\n\"These are all coordinated under the new mental relay control. Some of\nyou will doubt this last, but think of it under this light. Will,\nthought, concentration--they are efforts, they require energy. Then they\ncan exert energy! That is the key to the whole thing.\n\n\"But now for the demonstration.\"\n\nArcot looked toward Morey, who stood off to one side. There was a heavy\nthud as Morey pushed a small button. The relay had closed. Arcot's mind\nwas now connected with the controls.\n\nA globe of cloudiness appeared. It increased in density, and was a\nsolid, opalescent sphere.\n\n\"There is a sphere, a foot in diameter, ten feet from me,\" droned Arcot.\nThe sphere was there. \"It is moving to the left.\" The sphere moved to\nthe left at Arcot's thought. \"It is rising.\" The sphere rose. \"It is\nchanging to a disc two feet across.\" The sphere seemed to flow, and was\na disc two feet across as Arcot's toneless voice of concentration\ncontinued.\n\n\"It is changing into a hand, like a human hand.\" The disc changed into a\nhuman hand, the fingers slightly bent, the soft, white fingers of a\nwoman with the pink of the flesh and the wrinkles at the knuckles\nvisible. The wrist seemed to fade gradually into nothingness, the end of\nthe hand was as indeterminate as are things in a dream, but the hand was\ndefinite.\n\n\"The hand is reaching for the bar of lux metal on the floor.\" The soft,\nlittle hand moved, and reached down and grasped the half ton bar of lux\nmetal, wrapped dainty fingers about it and lifted it smoothly and\neffortlessly to the table, and laid it there.\n\nA mistiness suddenly solidified to another hand. The second hand joined\nthe first, and fell to work on the bar, and pulled. The bar stretched\nfinally under an enormous load. One hand let go, and the thud of the\nhighly elastic lux metal bar's return to its original shape echoed\nthrough the soundless room. These men of the twenty-second century knew\nwhat relux and lux metals were, and knew their enormous strength. Yet it\nwas putty under these hands. The hands that looked like a woman's!\n\nThe bar was again placed on the table, and the hands disappeared. There\nwas a thud, and the relay had opened.\n\n\"I can't demonstrate the power I have. It is impossible. The\npower is so enormous that nothing short of a sun could serve as a\ndemonstration-hall. It is utterly beyond comprehension under any\nconditions. I have demonstrated artificial matter, and control by mental\naction.\n\n\"I'm now going to show you some other things we have learned. Remember,\nI can control perfectly the properties of artificial matter, by\ndetermining the structure it shall have.\n\n\"Watch.\"\n\nMorey closed the relay. Arcot again set to work. A heavy ingot of iron\nwas raised by a clamp that fastened itself upon it, coming from nowhere.\nThe iron moved, and settled over the table. As it approached, a\nmistiness that formed became a crucible. The crucible showed the gray of\npure iron, but it was artificial matter. The iron settled in the\ncrucible, and a strange process of flowing began. The crucible became a\nball, and colors flowed across its surface, till finally it was glowing\nrichly silvery. The ball opened, and a great lump of silvery stuff was\nwithin it. It settled to the floor, and the ball disappeared, but the\nsilvery metal did not.\n\n\"Platinum,\" said Morey softly. A gasp came from the audience. \"Only\nplatinum could exist there, and the matter had to rearrange itself as\nplatinum.\" He could rearrange it in any form he chose, either absorbing\nor supplying energy of existence and energy of formation.\n\nThe mistiness again appeared in the air, and became a globe, a globe of\nbrown. But it changed, and disappeared. Morey recognized the signal. \"He\nwill now make the artificial matter into all the elements, and many\nnonexistent elements, unstable, atomic figures.\" There followed a long\nseries of changes.\n\nThe material shifted again, and again. Finally the last of the natural\nelements was left behind, all 104 elements known to man were shown, and\nmany others.\n\n\"We will skip now. This is element of atomic weight 7000.\"\n\nIt was a lump of soft, oozy blackness. One could tell from the way that\nArcot's mind handled it that it was soft. It seemed cold, terribly cold.\nMorey explained:\n\n\"It is very soft, for its atom is so large that it is soft in the\nmolecular state. It is tremendously photoelectric, losing electrons\nvery readily, and since its atom has so enormous a volume, its electrons\nare very far from the nucleus in the outer rings, and they absorb rays\nof very great length; even radio and some shorter audio waves seem to\naffect it. That accounts for its blackness, and the softness as Arcot\nhas truly depicted it. Also, since it absorbs heat waves and changes\nthem to electrical charges, it tends to become cold, as the frost Arcot\nhas shown indicates. Remember, that that is infinitely hard as you see\nit, for it is artificial matter, but Arcot has seen natural matter\nforced into this exceedingly explosive atomic figuration.\n\n\"It is so heavily charged in the nucleus that its X-ray spectrum is well\ntoward the gamma! The inner electrons can scarcely vibrate.\"\n\nAgain the substance changed--and was gone.\n\n\"Too far--atom of weight 20,000 becomes invisible and nonexistent as\nspace closes in about it--perhaps the origin of our space. Atoms of this\nweight, if breaking up, would form two or more atoms that would exist in\nour space, then these would be unstable, and break down further into\nnormal atoms. We don't know.\n\n\"And one more substance,\" continued Morey as he opened the relay once\nmore. Arcot sat down and rested his head in his hands. He was not\naccustomed to this strain, and though his mind was one of the most\npowerful on Earth, it was very hard for him.\n\n\"We have a substance of commercial and practical use now. Cosmium. Arcot\nwill show one method of making it.\"\n\nArcot resumed his work, seated now. A formation reached out, and grasped\nthe lump of platinum still on the floor. Other bars of iron were brought\nover from the stack of material laid ready, and piled on a broad sheet\nthat had formed in the air, tons of it, tens of tons. Finally he\nstopped. There was enough. The sheet wrapped itself into a sphere, and\ncontracted, slowly, steadily. It was rampant with energy, energy flowed\nfrom it, and the air about was glowing with ionization. There was a\nfeeling of awful power that seeped into the minds of the watchers, and\nheld them spellbound before the glowing, opalescent sphere. The tons of\nmatter were compressed now to a tiny ball! Suddenly the energy flared\nout violently, a terrific burst of energy, ionizing the air in the\nentire room, and shooting it with tiny, burning sparks. Then it was\nover. The ball split, and became two planes. Between them was a small\nball of a glistening solid. The planes moved slowly together, and the\nball flattened, and flowed. It was a sheet.\n\nA clamp of artificial matter took it, and held the paper-thin sheet,\nmany feet square, in the air. It seemed it must bend under its own\nenormous weight of tons, but thin as it was it did not.\n\n\"Cosmium,\" said Morey softly.\n\nArcot crumpled it, and pressed it once more between artificial matter\ntools. It was a plate, thick as heavy cardboard, and two feet on a side.\nHe set it in a holder of artificial matter, a sort of frame, and caused\nthe controls to lock.\n\nTaking off the headpiece he had worn, he explained, \"As Morey said,\nCosmium. Briefly, density, 5007.89. Tensile strength, about two hundred\nthousand times that of good steel!\" The audience gasped. That seems\nlittle to men who do not realize what it meant. An inch of this stuff\nwould be harder to penetrate than three miles of steel!\n\n\"Our new ship,\" continued Arcot, \"will carry six-inch armor. Six inches\nwould be the equivalent of eighteen miles of solid steel, with the\nenormous improvement that it will be concentrated, and so will have far\ngreater resistance than any amount of steel. Its tensile strength would\nbe the equivalent of an eighteen-mile wall of steel.\n\n\"But its most important properties are that it reflects everything we\nknow of. Cosmics, light, and even moleculars! It is made of cosmic ray\nphotons, as lux is made of light photons, but the inexpressibly tighter\nbond makes the strength enormous. It cannot be handled by any means save\nby artificial matter tools.\n\n\"And now I am going to give a demonstration of the theatrical\npossibilities of this new agent. Hardly scientific--but amusing.\"\n\nBut it wasn't exactly amusing.\n\nArcot again donned the headpiece. \"I think,\" he continued, \"that a\nmanifestation of the super-natural will be most interesting. Remember\nthat all you see is real, and all effects are produced by artificial\nmatter generated by the cosmic energy, as I have explained, and are\ncontrolled by my mind.\"\n\nArcot had chosen to give this demonstration with definite reason.\nApparently a bit of scientific playfulness, yet he knew that nothing is\nso impressive, nor so lastingly remembered as a theatrical demonstration\nof science. The greatest scientist likes to play with his science.\n\nBut Arcot's experiment now--it was on a level of its own!\n\nFrom behind the table, apparently crawling up the leg came a thing! It\nwas a hand. A horrible, disjointed hand. It was withered and incarmined\nwith blood, for it was severed from its wrist, and as it hunched itself\nalong, moving by a ghastly twitching of fingers and thumb, it left a\ntrail of red behind it. The papers to be distributed rustled as it\npassed, scurrying suddenly across the table, down the leg, and racing\ntoward the light switch! By some process of writhing jerks it reached\nit, and suddenly the room was plunged into half-light as the lights\nwinked out. Light filtering over the transom of the door from the hall\nalone illuminated the hall, but the hand glowed! It glowed, and scurried\naway with an awful rustling, scuttling into some unseen hole in the\nwall. The quiet of the hall was the quiet of tenseness.\n\nFrom the wall, coming through it, came a mistiness that solidified as it\nflowed across. It was far to the right, a bent stooped figure, a figure\nhalf glimpsed, but fully known, for it carried in its bony, glowing hand\na great, nicked scythe. Its rattling tread echoed hollowly on the floor.\nStooping walk, shuffling gait, the great metal scythe scraping on the\nfloor, half seen as the gray, luminous cloak blew open in some unfelt\nbreeze of its ephemeral world, revealing bone; dry, gray bone. Only the\nscythe seemed to know Life, and it was red with that Life. Slow running,\nsticky lifestuff.\n\nDeath paused, and raised his awful head. The hood fell back from the\ncavernous eyesockets, and they flamed with a greenish radiance that made\nevery strained face in the room assume the same deathly pallor.\n\n\"The Scythe, the Scythe of Death,\" grated the rusty Voice. \"The Scythe\nis slow, too slow. I bring new things,\" it cackled in its cracked voice,\n\"new things of my tools. See!\" The clutching bones dropped the rattling\nScythe, and the handle broke as it fell, and rotted before their eyes.\n\"Heh, heh,\" the Thing cackled as it watched. \"Heh--what Death touches,\nrots as he leaves it.\" The grinning, blackened skull grinned wider, in\nan awful, leering cavity, rotting, twisted teeth showed. But from under\nhis flapping robe, the skeletal hands drew something--ray pistols!\n\n\"These--these are swifter!\" The Thing turned, and with a single leering\nglance behind, flowed once more through the wall.\n\nA gasp, a stifled, groaning gasp ran through the hall, a half sob.\n\nBut far, far away they could hear something clanking, dragging its slow\nway along. Spellbound they turned to the farthest corner--and looked\ndown the long, long road that twined off in distance. A lone, luminous\nfigure plodded slowly along it, his half human shamble bringing him\nrapidly nearer.\n\nLarger and larger he loomed, clearer and clearer became the figure, and\nhis burden. Broken, twisted steel, or metal of some sort, twisted and\nblackened.\n\n\"It's over--it's over--and my toys are here. I win, I always win. For I\nam the spawn of Mars, of War, and of Hate, the sister of War, and my\ntoys are the things they leave behind.\" It gesticulated, waving the\ntwisted stuff and now through the haze, they could see them--buildings.\nThe framework of buildings and twisted liners, broken weapons.\n\nIt loomed nearer, the cavernous, glowing eyes under low, shaggy brows,\nbecame clear, the awful brutal hate, the lust of Death, the rotting\nflesh of Disease--all seemed stamped on the Horror that approached.\n\n\"Ah!\" It had seen them! \"Ahh!\" It dropped the buildings, the broken\nthings, and shuffled into a run, toward them! Its face changed, the lips\ndrew back from broken, stained teeth, the curling, cruel lips, and the\nrotting flesh of the face wrinkled into a grin of lust and hatred. The\nshaggy mop of its hair seemed to writhe and twist, the long, thin\nfingers grasped spasmodically as it neared. The torn, broken fingernails\nwere visible--nearer--nearer--nearer--\n\n\"Oh, God--stop it!\" A voice shrieked out of the dark as someone leaped\nsuddenly to his feet.\n\nSimultaneously with the cry the Thing puffed into nothingness of energy\nfrom which it had sprung, and a great ball of clear, white glowing light\ncame into being in the center of the room, flooding it with a light that\ndazzled the eyes, but calmed broken nerves.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\nEARTH'S DEFENSES\n\n\n\"I am sorry, Arcot. I did not know, for I see I might have helped, but\nto me, with my ideas of horror, it was as you said, amusement,\" said\nTorlos. They were sitting now in Arcot's study at the cottage; Arcot,\nhis father, Morey, Wade, Torlos, the three Ortolians and the Talsonian.\n\n\"I know, Torlos. You see, where I made my mistake, as I have said, was\nin forgetting that in doing as I did, picturing horror, like a snowball\nrolling, it would grow greater. The idea of horror, started, my mind\npictured one, and it inspired greater horror, which in turn reacted on\nmy all too reactive apparatus. As you said, the things changed as you\nwatched, molding themselves constantly as my mind changed them, under\nits own initiative and the concentrated thoughts of all those others. It\nwas a very foolish thing to do, for that last Thing--well, remember it\n_was_, it existed, and the idea of hate and lust it portrayed was caused\nby my mind, but my mind could picture what it would do, if such were its\nemotions, and it would do them because my mind pictured them! And\n_nothing_ could resist it!\" Arcot's face was white once more as he\nthought of the danger he had run, of the terrible consequences possible\nof that 'amusement.'\n\n\"I think we had best start on the ship. I'll go get some sleep now, and\nthen we can go.\"\n\nArcot led the way to the ship, while Torlos, Morey and Wade and Stel\nFelso Theu accompanied him. The Ortolians were to work on Earth, aiding\nin the detection of attacks by means of their mental investigation of\nthe enemy.\n\n\"Well--good-bye, Dad. Don't know when I'll be back. Maybe twenty-five\nthousand years from now, or twenty-five thousand years ago. But we'll\nget back somehow. And we'll clean out the Thessians!\"\n\nHe entered the ship, and rose into space.\n\n\"Where are you going, Arcot?\" asked Morey.\n\n\"Eros,\" replied Arcot laconically.\n\n\"Not if my mind is working right,\" cried Wade suddenly. All the others\nwere tense, listening for inaudible sounds.\n\n\"I quite agree,\" replied Arcot. The ship turned about, and dived toward\nNew York, a hundred thousand miles behind now, at a speed many times\nthat of light as Arcot snapped into time. Across the void, Zezdon\nFentes' call had come--New York was to be attacked by the Thessians, New\nYork and Chicago next. New York because the orbits of their two forts\nwere converging over that city in a few minutes!\n\nThey were in the atmosphere, screaming through it as their relux glowed\ninstantaneously in the Heaviside layer, then was through before damage\ncould be done. The screen was up.\n\nScarcely a minute after they passed, the entire heavens blazed into\nlight, the roar of tremendous thunders crashing above them, great\nlightning bolts rent the upper air for miles as enormous energies\nclashed.\n\n\"Ah--they are sending everything they have against that screen, and it's\nhot. We have ten of our biggest tube stations working on it, and more\ncoming in, to our total of thirty, but they have two forts, and Lord\nknows how many ships.\n\n\"I think me I'm going to cause them some worrying.\"\n\nArcot turned the ship, and drove up again, now at a speed very low to\nthem but as they had the time-field up, very great. They passed the\nscreen, and a tremendous bolt struck the ship. Everything in it was\nshielded, but the static was still great enough to cause them some\ntrouble as the time-field and electric field fought. But the time-field,\nbecause of its very nature, could work faster, and they won through\nundamaged, though the enormous current seemed flowing for many minutes\nas they drifted slowly past it. Slowly--at fifty miles a second.\n\nOut in space, free of the atmosphere, Arcot shot out to the point where\nthe Thessians were congregating. The shining dots of their ships and the\ndiscs of the forts were visible from Earth save for the air's\ndistortion.\n\nThey seemed a miniature Milky Way, their deadly beams concentrated on\nEarth.\n\nThen the Thessians discovered that the terrestrial fleet was in action.\nA ship glowed with the ray, the opalescence of relux under moleculars\nvisible on its walls. It simply searched for its opponent while its\nrelux slowly yielded. It found it in time, and the terrestrial ship put\nup its screen.\n\nThe terrestrial fleet set to work, everything they had flying at the\nThessian giants, but the Thessians had heavier ships, and heavier tubes.\nMore power was winning for them. Inevitably, when the Sun's interference\nsomewhat weakened the ray shield--\n\nAbout that time Arcot arrived. The nearest fort dived toward the further\nwith an acceleration that smashed it against no less than ten of its own\nships before they could so much as move.\n\nWhen the way was clear to the other fort--and that fort had moved, the\nberserk fort started off a new tack--and garnered six more wrecks on its\nside.\n\nThen Thett's emissaries located Arcot. The screen was up, and the\nNegrian attractive ray apparatus which Arcot had used was working\nthrough it. The screen flashed here and there and collapsed under the\nfull barrage of half the Thessian fleet, as Arcot had suspected it\nwould. But the same force that made it collapse operated a relay that\nturned on the space control, and Thett's molecular ray energy steamed\noff to outer space.\n\n\"We worried them, then dug our hole and dragged it in after us, as\nusual, but damn it, we can't hurt them!\" said Arcot disgustedly. \"All we\ncan do is tease them, then go hide where it's perfectly safe, in\nartificial--\" Arcot stopped in amazement. The ship had been held under\nsuch space control that space was shut in about them, and they were\nmotionless. The dials had reached a steady point, the current flow had\nbecome zero, and they hung there with only the very slow drain of the\nSun's gravitational field and that of the planet's field pulling on the\nship. Suddenly the current had leaped, and the dials giving the charge\nin the various coil banks had moved them down toward zero.\n\n\"Hey--they've got a wedge in here and are breaking out our hole. Turn on\nall the generators, Morey.\" Arcot was all action now. Somehow,\ninconceivable though it was, the Thessians had spotted them, and got\nsome means of attacking them, despite their invulnerable position in\nanother space!\n\nThe generators were on, pouring enormous power into the coils, and the\ndials surged, stopped, and climbed ever so slowly. They should have\njumped back under that charge, ordinarily dangerously heavy. For perhaps\nthirty seconds they climbed, then they started down at full speed!\n\nArcot's hand darted to the time field, and switched it on full. The dial\njerked, swung, then swung back, and started falling in unison with the\ndials, stopped, and climbed. All climbed swiftly, gaining ever more\nrapidly. With what seemed a jerk, the time dial flew over, and back, as\nArcot opened the switch. They were free, and the dial on the space\ncontrol coils was climbing normally now.\n\n\"By the Nine Planets, did they drink out our energy! The energy of six\ntons of lead just like that!\"\n\n\"How'd they do it?\" asked Wade.\n\nTorlos kept silent, and helped Morey replace the coils of lead wire with\nothers from stock.\n\n\"Same way we tickled them,\" replied Arcot, carefully studying the\ncontrol instruments, \"with the gravity ray! We knew all along that\ngravitational fields drank out the energy--they simply pulled it out\nfaster than we could pump it in, and used four different rays on us\ndoing it. Which speaks well for a little ship! But they burned off the\nrelux on one room here, and it's a wreck. The molecs hit everything in\nit. Looks like something bad,\" called Arcot. The room was Morey's, but\nhe'd find that out himself. \"In the meantime, see if you can tell where\nwe are. I got loose from their rays by going on both the high speed\ntime-field and the space control at full, with all generators going full\nblast. Man, they had a stranglehold on us that time! But wait till we\nget that new ship turned out!\"\n\nWith the telectroscope they could see what was happening. The terrific\nbombardment of rays was continuing, and the fleets were locked now in a\nstruggle, the combined fleets of Earth and Venus and of Nansal, far\nacross the void. Many of the terrestrian, or better, Solarian ships,\nwere equipped with space distortion apparatus, now, and had some measure\nof safety in that the attractive rays of the Thessians could not be so\nconcentrated on them. In numbers was safety; Arcot had been endangered\nbecause he was practically alone at the time they attacked.\n\nBut it was obvious that the Solarian fleet was losing. They could not\ncompete with the heavier ships, and now the frequent flaming bursts of\nlight that told of a ship caught in the new deadly ray showed another\ndanger.\n\n\"I think Earth is lost if you cannot aid it soon, Arcot, for other\nThessian ships are coming,\" said Stel Felso Theu softly.\n\nFrom out of the plane of the planetary orbits they were coming, across\nspace from some other world, a fleet of dozens of them. They were\nvisible as one after another leapt into normal time-rates.\n\n\"Why don't they fight in advanced time?\" asked Morey, half aloud.\n\n\"Because the genius that designed that apparatus didn't think of it.\nRemember, Morey, those ships have their time apparatus connected with\ntheir power apparatus so that the power has to feed the time\ncontinuously. They have no coils like ours. When they advance their\ntime, they're weakened every other way.\n\n\"We need that new ship. Are we going to make it?\" demanded Arcot.\n\n\"Take weeks at best. What chance?\" asked Morey.\n\n\"Plenty; watch.\" As he spoke, Arcot pulled open the time controls, and\nspun the ship about. They headed off toward a tiny point of light far\nbeyond. It rushed toward them, grew with the swiftness of an exploding\nbomb, and was suddenly a great, rough fragment of a planet hanging\nbefore them, miles in extent.\n\n\"Eros,\" explained Wade laconically to Torlos. \"Part of an ancient planet\nthat was destroyed before the time of man, or life on Earth. The planet\ngot too near the sun when its orbit was irregular, and old Sol pulled it\nto pieces. This is one of the pieces. The other asteroids are the rest.\nAll planetary surfaces are made up of great blocks; they aren't\ncontinuous, you know. Like blocks of concrete in a building, they can\nslide a bit on each other, but friction holds them till they slip with a\njar and we have earthquakes. This is one of the planetary blocks. We see\nEros from Earth intermittently, for when this thing turns broadside it\nreflects a lot of light; edge on it does not reflect so much.\"\n\nIt was a desolate bit of rock. Bare, airless, waterless rock, of\nenormous extent. It was contorted and twisted, but there were no great\ncracks in it for it was a single planetary block.\n\nArcot dropped the ship to the barren surface, and anchored it with an\nattractive ray at low concentration. There was no gravity of consequence\non this bit of rock.\n\n\"Come on, get to work. Space suits, and rush all the apparatus out,\"\nsnapped Arcot. He was on his feet, the power of the ship in neutral now.\nOnly the attractor was on. In the shortest possible time they got into\ntheir suits, and under Arcot's direction set up the apparatus on the\nrocky soil as fast as it was brought out. In all, less than fifteen\nminutes were needed, yet Arcot was hurrying them more and more. Torlos'\ntremendous strength helped, even on this gravitationless world, for he\ncould accelerate more quickly with his burdens.\n\nAt last it was up for operation. The artificial matter apparatus was\noperated by cosmic power, and controlled by mental operation, or by\nmathematical formula as they pleased. Immediately Arcot set to work. A\ngiant hollow cylinder drilled a great hole completely through the thin,\ncurved surface of the ancient planetary block, through twelve miles of\nsolid rock--a cylinder of artificial matter created on a scale possible\nonly to cosmic power. The cylinder, half a mile across, contained a huge\nplug of matter. Then the artificial matter contracted swiftly,\ncompressing the matter, and simultaneously treating it with the\ntremendous fields that changed its energy form. In seconds it was a\ntremendous mass of cosmium.\n\nA second smaller cylinder bored a plug from the rock, and worked on it.\nA huge mass of relux resulted. Now other artificial matter tools set to\nwork at Arcot's bidding, and cut pieces from his huge masses of raw\nmaterials, and literally, quick as thought, built a great framework of\nthem, anchored in the solid rock of the planetoid.\n\nThen a tremendous plane of matter formed, and neatly bisected the\nplanetoid, two great flat pieces of rock were left where one had\nbeen--miles across, miles thick--planetary chips.\n\nOn the great framework that had been constructed, four tall shafts of\ncosmium appeared, and each was a hollow tube, up the center of which ran\na huge cable of relux. At the peak of each mile-high shaft was a great\nglobe. Now in the framework below things were materializing as Arcot's\nflying thoughts arranged them--great tubes of cosmium with relux\nelement--huge coils of relux conductors, insulated with microscopic but\nimpenetrable layers of cosmium.\n\nStill, for all his swiftness of mind and accuracy of thought, he had to\ncorrect two mistakes in all his work. It was nearly an hour before the\nthing was finished. Then, two hundred feet long, a hundred wide, and\nfifty in height, the great mechanism was completed, the tall columns\nrising from four corners of the greater framework that supported it.\n\nThen, into it, Arcot turned the powers of the cosmos. The stars in the\nairless space wavered and danced as though seen through a thick\natmosphere. Tingling power ran through them as it flowed into the\ntremendous coils. For thirty seconds--then the heavens were as before.\n\nAt last Arcot spoke. Through the radio communicators, and through the\nthought-channels, his ideas came as he took off the headpiece. \"It's\ndone now, and we can rest.\" There was a tremendous crash from within the\napparatus. The heavens reeled before them, and shifted, then were still,\nbut the stars were changed. The sun shone weirdly, and the stars were\naltered.\n\n\"That is a time shifting apparatus on a slightly larger scale,\" replied\nArcot to Torlos' question, \"and is designed to give us a chance to work.\nCome on, let's sleep. A week here should be a few minutes of Earthtime.\"\n\n\"You sleep, Arcot. I'll prepare the materials for you,\" suggested Morey.\nSo Arcot and Wade went to sleep, while Morey and the Talsonian and\nTorlos worked. First Morey bound the _Ancient Mariner_ to the frame of\nthe time apparatus, safely away from the four luminous balls,\nbroadcasters of the time field. Then he shut off the attractive ray, and\nbound himself in the operator's seat of the apparatus of the artificial\nmatter machine.\n\nA plane of artificial matter formed, and a stretch of rock rose under\nits lift as it cleft the rock apart. A great cleared, level space\nresulted. Other artificial matter enclosed the rock, and the fragments\ncut free were treated under tremendous pressure. In a few moments a\nsecond enormous mass of cosmium was formed.\n\nFor three hours Morey worked steadily, building a tremendous reserve of\nmaterials. Lux metal he did not make, but relux, the infusible, perfect\nconductor, and cosmium in tremendous masses, he did make. And he made\nsome great blocks of oxygen from the rock, transmuting the atoms, and\nstored it frozen on the plane, with liquid hydrogen in huge tanks, and\nsome metals that would be needed. Then he slept while they waited for\nArcot.\n\nEight hours after he had lain down, Arcot was up, and ate his breakfast.\nHe set to work at once with the machine. It didn't suit him, it seemed,\nand first he made a new tool, a small ship that could move about,\npropelled by a piece of artificial matter, and the entire ship was a\ntremendously greater artificial matter machine, with a greater power\nthan before!\n\nHis thoughts, far faster than hands could move, built up the gigantic\nhull of the new ship, and put in the rooms, and the brace members in\nless than twelve hours. A titanic shell of eight-inch cosmium, a space,\nwith braces of the same nonconductor of heat, cosmium, and a two inch\ninner hull. A tiny space in the gigantic hull, a space less than one\nthousand cubic feet in dimension was the control and living quarters.\n\nIt was held now on great cosmium springs, but Arcot was not by any means\nthrough. One man must do all the work, for one brain must design it, and\nthough he received the constant advice and help of Morey and the others,\nit was his brain that pictured the thing that was built.\n\nAt last the hull was completed. A single, glistening tube, of enormous\nbulk, a mile in length, a thousand feet in diameter. Yet nearly all of\nthat great bulk would be used immediately. Some room would be left for\nadditional apparatus they might care to install. Spare parts they did\nnot have to carry--they could make their own from the energy abounding\nin space.\n\nThe enormous, shining hull was a thing of beauty through stark grandeur\nnow, but obviously incomplete. The ray projectors were not mounted, but\nthey were to be ray projectors of a type never before possible. Space is\nthe transmitter of all rays, and it is in space that those energy forms\nexist. Arcot had merely to transfer the enormously high energy level of\nthe space-curvature to any form of energy he wanted, and now, with the\ncomplete statistics on it, he was able to do that directly. No tubes, no\ngenerators, only fields that changed the energy already there--the\nimmeasurable energy available!\n\nThe next period of work he started the space distortion apparatus. That\nmust go at the exact center of the ship. One tremendous coil, big enough\nfor the _Ancient Mariner_ to lie in easily! Minutes, and flying thoughts\nhad made it--then came thousands of the individual coils, by thinking of\none, and picturing it many times! In ranks, rows, and columns they were\npiled into a great block, for power must be stored for use of this\ntremendous machine, while in the artificial space when its normal power\nwas not available, and that power source must be tremendous.\n\nThen the time apparatus, and after that the driving apparatus. Not the\nmolecular drive now, but an attraction ray focused on their own ship,\nwith projectors scattered about the ship that it might move effortlessly\nin every direction. And provision was made for a force-drive by means of\nartificial matter, planes of it pushing the ship where it was wanted.\nBut with the attraction-drive they would be able to land safely, without\nfear of being crushed by their own weight on Thett, for all its enormous\ngravity.\n\nThe control was now suspended finally, with a series of attraction\ndrives about it, locking it immovably in place, while smaller attraction\ndevices stimulated gravity for the occupants.\n\nThen finally the main apparatus--the power plant--was installed. The\nenormous coils which handled, or better, caused space to handle as they\ndirected, powers so great that whole suns could be blasted\ninstantaneously, were put in place, and the field generators that would\nmake and direct their rays, their ray screen if need be, and handle\ntheir artificial matter. Everything was installed, and all but a rather\nsmall space was occupied.\n\nIt had been six weeks of continuous work for them, for the mind of each\nwas aiding in this work, indirectly or directly, and it neared\ncompletion now.\n\n\"But, we need one more thing, Arcot. That could never land on any planet\nsmaller than Jupiter. What is its mass?\" suggested Morey.\n\n\"Don't know, I'm sure, but it is of the order of a billion tons. I know\nyou are right. What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Put on a tender.\"\n\n\"Why not the _Ancient Mariner_?\" asked Wade.\n\n\"It isn't fitting. It was designed for individual use anyway,\" replied\nMorey. \"I suggest something more like this on a small scale. We won't\nhave much work on that, merely think of every detail of the big ship on\na small scale, with the exception of the control cube furnishings.\nInstead of the numerous decks, swimming pool and so forth, have a large,\nsingle room.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" replied Arcot.\n\nAs if by magic, a machine appeared, a \"small\" machine of\ntwo-hundred-foot length, modified slightly in some parts, its bottom\nflattened, and equipped with an attractor anchor. Then they were ready.\n\n\"We will leave the _Mariner_ here, and get it later. This apparatus\nwon't be needed any longer, and we don't want the enemy to get it. Our\ntrial trip will be a fight!\" called Arcot as he leaped from his seat.\nThe mass of the giant ship pulled him, and he fell slowly toward it.\n\nInto its open port he flew, the others behind him, their suits still on.\nThe door shut behind them as Arcot, at the controls, closed it. As yet\nthey had not released the air supplies. It was airless.\n\nNow the hiss of air, and the quickening of heat crept through it. The\nwater in the tanks thawed as the heat came, soaking through from the\ngreat heaters. In minutes the air and heat were normal throughout the\ngreat bulk. There was air in power compartments, though no one was\nexpected to go there, for the control room alone need be occupied;\nvision-screens here viewed every part of the ship, and all about it.\n\nThe eyes of the new ship were set in recesses of the tremendously strong\ncosmium wall, and over them, protecting them, was an infinitely thin,\nbut infinitely strong wall of artificial matter, permanently maintained.\nIt was opaque to all forms of radiation known from the longest Hertzian\nto the shortest cosmics, save for the very narrow band of visible light.\nWhether this protection would stop the Thessian beam that was so deadly\nto lux and relux was not, of course, known. But Arcot hoped it would,\nand, if that beam was radiant energy, or material particles, it would.\n\n\"We'll destroy our station here now, and leave the _Ancient Mariner_\nwhere it is. Of course we are a long way out of the orbit this planetoid\nfollowed, due to the effect of the time apparatus, but we can note where\nit is, and we'll be able to find it when we want it,\" said Arcot, seated\nat the great control board now. There were no buttons now, or visible\ncontrols; all was mental.\n\nA tiny sphere of artificial matter formed, and shot toward the control\nboard of the time machine outside. It depressed the main switch, and\nspace about them shifted, twisted, and returned to normal. The time\napparatus was off for the first time in six weeks.\n\n\"Can't fuse that, and we can't crush it. It's made of cosmium, and\ntrying to crush it against the rock would just drive it into it. We'll\nsee what we can do though,\" muttered Arcot. A plane of artificial matter\nformed just beneath it, and sheared it from its bed on the planetoid,\ncutting through the heavy cosmium anchors. The framework lifted, and the\napparatus with it. A series of planes, a gigantic honeycomb formed, and\nthe apparatus was cut across again and again, till only small fragments\nwere left of it. Then these were rolled into a ball, and crushed by a\nsphere of artificial matter beyond all repair. The enemy would never\nlearn their secret.\n\nA huge cylinder of artificial matter cut a great gouge from the plane\nthat was left where the apparatus had been, and a clamp of the same\nmaterial picked up the _Ancient Mariner_, deposited it there, then\ncovered it with rubble and broken rock. A cosmic flashed on the rock for\nan instant, and it was glowing, incandescent lava. The _Ancient Mariner_\nwas buried under a hundred feet of rapidly solidifying rock, but rock\nwhich could be fused away from its infusible walls when the time came.\n\n\"We're ready to go now--get to work with the radio, Morey, when we get\nto Earth.\"\n\nThe gravity seemed normal here as they walked about, no accelerations\naffected them as the ship darted forward, for all its inconceivably\ngreat mass, like an arrow, then flashed forward under time control. The\nsun was far distant now, for six weeks they had been traveling with the\nsection of Eros under time control. But with their tremendous time\ncontrol plant, and the space control, they reached the solar system in\nvery little time.\n\nIt seemed impossible to them that that battle could still be waging, but\nit was. The ships of Earth and Venus, battling now as a last, hopeless\nstand, over Chicago, were attempting to stop the press of a great\nThessian fleet. Thin, long Negrian, or Sirian ships had joined them in\nthe hour of Earth time that the men had been working. Still, despite the\nreinforcements, they were falling back.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\nTHE BATTLE OF EARTH\n\n\nIt had been an anxious hour for the forces of the Solar System.\n\nThey were in the last fine stages of Earth's defense when the general\nstaff received notice that a radio message of tremendous power had\npenetrated the ray screen, with advice for them. It was signed \"Arcot.\"\n\n\"Bringing new weapon. Draw all ships within the atmosphere when I start\naction, and drive Thessians back into space. Retire as soon as a\ndistance of ten thousand miles is reached. I will then handle the\nfleet,\" was the message.\n\n\"Gentlemen: We are losing. The move suggested would be eminently poor\ntactics unless we are sure of being able to drive them. If we don't, we\nare lost in any event. I trust Arcot. How vote you?\" asked General\nHetsar Sthel.\n\nThe message was relayed to the ships. Scarcely a moment after the\nmessage had been relayed, a tremendous battleship appeared in space,\njust beyond the battle. It shot forward, and planted itself directly in\nthe midst of the battle, brushing aside two huge Thessians in its\nprogress. The Thessian ships bounced off its sides, and reeled away. It\nlay waiting, making no move. All the Thessian ships above poured the\nfull concentration of their moleculars into its tremendous bulk. A\ndiffused glow of opalescence ran over every ship--save the giant. The\nmoleculars were being reflected from its sides, and their diffused\nenergy attacked the very ships that were sending them!\n\nA fort moved up, and the deadly beam of destruction reached out,\nluminous even in space.\n\n\"Now,\" muttered Morey, \"we shall see what cosmium will stand.\"\n\nA huge spot on the side of the ship had become incandescent. A vapor, a\nstrange puff of smokiness exploded from it, and disappeared instantly.\nAnother came and faster and faster they followed each other. The cosmium\nwas disintegrating under the ray, but very slowly, breaking first into\ngaseous cosmic rays, then free, and spreading.\n\n\"We will not fight,\" muttered Morey happily as he saw Arcot shift in his\nseat.\n\nArcot picked the moleculars. They reached out, touched the heavy relux\nof the fort, and it exploded into opalescence that was hazily white, the\ncolors shifted so quickly. A screen sprang into being, and the ray was\nchopped off. The screen was a mass of darting flames as energies of\nstupendous magnitude clashed.\n\nArcot used a bit more of his inconceivable power. The ray struck the\nscreen, and it flashed once--then died into blackness. The fort suddenly\ncrumpled in like a dented can, and rolled clumsily away. The other fort\nwas near now, and started an attack of its own. Arcot chose the\nartificial matter this time. He was not watching the many attacking\nships.\n\nThe great ship careened suddenly, fell over heavily to one side.\n\"Foolish of me,\" said Arcot. \"They tried crashing us.\"\n\nA mass of crumpled, broken relux and lux surrounded by a haze of gas\nlying against a slight scratch on the great sides, told the story. Eight\ninches of cosmium does not give way.\n\nYet another ship tried it. But it stopped several feet away from the\nreal wall of the ship. It struck a wall even more unyielding--artificial\nmatter.\n\nBut now Arcot was using this major weapon--artificial matter. Ship after\nship, whether fleeing or attacking, was surrounded suddenly by a great\nsphere of it, a sudden terrific blaze of energy as the sphere struck the\nray shield, the control forces now backed by the energy of all the\nmillions of stars of space shattered it in an instant. Then came the\ninexorable crush of the artificial matter, and a ball of matter alone\nremained.\n\nBut the pressing disc of the battle-front which had been lowering on\nChicago, greatest of Earth's metropolises, was lifted. This disc-front\nwas staggering back now as Arcot's mighty ship weakened its strength,\nand destroyed its morale, under the steady drive of the now hopeful\nSolarians.\n\nThe other gigantic fort moved up now, with twenty of the largest\nbattleships. The fort turned loose its destructive ray--and Arcot tried\nhis new \"magnet.\" It was not a true magnet, but a transformed space\nfield, a field created by the energy of all the universe.\n\nThe fort was gigantic. Even Arcot's mighty ship was a small thing beside\nit, but suddenly it seemed warped and twisted as space curved visibly in\na magnetic field of such terrific intensity as to be immeasurable.\n\nArcot's armory was tested and found not wanting.\n\nSuddenly every Thessian ship in sight ceased to exist. They disappeared.\nInstantly Arcot threw on all time power, and darted toward Venus. The\nThessians were already nearing the planet, and no possible rays could\novertake them. An instantaneous touch of the space control, and the\nmighty ship was within hundreds of miles of the atmosphere.\n\nSpace twisted about them, reeled, and was firm. The Thessian fleet was\nbefore them in a moment, visible now as they slowed to normal speed.\nStartled, no doubt, to find before them the ship they had fled, they\ncharged on for a space. Then, as though by some magic, they stopped and\nexploded in gouts of light.\n\nWhen space had twisted, seconds before, it was because Arcot had drawn\non the enormous power of space to an extent that had been appreciable\neven to it--ten sols. That was forty million tons of matter a second,\nand for a hundredth part of a second it had flowed. Before them, in a\nvast plane, had been created an infinitesimally thin film of artificial\nmatter, four hundred thousand tons of it, and into this invisible,\ninfinitely hard barrier, the Thessian fleet had rammed. And it was gone.\n\n\"I think,\" said Arcot softly, as he took off his headpiece, \"that the\nbeginning of the end is in sight.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Morey, \"think it is now out of sight. Half a dozen ships\nstopped. And they are gone now, to warn the others.\"\n\n\"What warning? What can they tell? Only that their ships were destroyed\nby something they couldn't see.\" Arcot smiled. \"I'm going home.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\nDESTRUCTION\n\n\nSome time later, Arcot spoke. \"I have just received a message from\nZezdon Fentes that he has an important communication to make, so I will\ngo down to New York instead of to Chicago, if you gentlemen do not mind.\nMorey will take you to Chicago in the tender, and I can find Zezdon\nFentes.\"\n\nZezdon Fentes' message was brief. He had discovered from the minds of\nseveral who had been killed by the magnetic field Arcot had used, and\nnot destroyed, that they had a base in this universe. Thett's base was\nsomewhere near the center of the galaxy, on a system of unusually large\nplanets, circling a rather small star. But what star their minds had not\nrevealed.\n\n\"It's up to us then to locate said star,\" said Arcot, after listening to\nZezdon Fentes' account: \"I think the easiest way will be to follow them\nhome. We can go to your world, Zezdon Fentes, and see what they are\ndoing there, and drive them off. Then to yours, Stel Felso. I place your\nworld second as it is far better able to defend itself than is Ortol. It\nis agreeable?\"\n\nIt was, and the ship which had been hanging in the atmosphere over New\nYork, where Zezdon Afthen, Fentes and Inthel had come to it in a\ntaxi-ship, signaled for the crowd to clear away above. The enormous bulk\nof the shining machine, the savior of Earth, had attracted a very great\namount of attention, naturally, and thousands on thousands of hardy\nsouls had braved the cold of the fifteen mile height with altitude suits\nor in small ships. Now they cleared away, and as the ship slowly rose,\nthe tremendous concentrated mental well-wishing of the thousands reached\nthe men within the ship. \"That,\" observed Morley, \"is one thing cosmium\nwon't stop. In some ways I wish it would--because the mental power that\ncould be wielded by any great number of those highly advanced Thessians,\nif they know its possibilities, is not a thing to neglect.\"\n\n\"I can answer that, terrestrian,\" thought Zezdon Afthen. \"Our\ninstruments show great mental powers, and great ability to concentrate\nthe will in mental processes, but they indicate a very slight\ndevelopment of these abilities. Our race, despite the fact that our\nmental powers are much less than those of such men as Arcot and\nyourself, have done, and can do many things your greater minds cannot,\nfor we have learned the direction of the will. We need not fear the will\nof the Thessians. I feel confident of that!\"\n\nThe ship was in space now, and as Arcot directed it toward Ortol, far\nfar across the Island, he threw on, for the moment, the combined power\nof space distortion and time fields. Instantly the sun vanished, and\nwhen, less than a second later, he cut off the space field, and left\nonly the time, the constellations were instantly recognizable. They were\nwithin a dozen light years of Ortol.\n\n\"Morey, may I ask what you call this machine?\" asked Torlos.\n\n\"You may, but I can't answer,\" laughed Morey. \"We were so anxious to get\nit going that we didn't name it. Any suggestions?\"\n\nFor a moment none of them made any suggestions, then slowly came Arcot's\nthoughts, clear and sharp, the thoughts of carefully weighed decision.\n\n\"The swiftest thing that ever was _thought_! The most irresistible\nthing, _thought_, for nothing can stop its progress. The most\ndestructive thing, _thought_. Thought, the greatest constructor, the\ngreatest destroyer, the product of mind, and producer of powers, the\ngreatest of powers. Thought is controlled by the mind. Let us call it\n_Thought_!\"\n\n\"Excellent, Arcot, excellent. The _Thought_, the controller of the\npowers of the cosmos!\" cried Morey.\n\n\"But the _Thought_ has not been christened, save in battle, and then it\nhad no name. Let us emblazen its name on it now,\" suggested Wade.\n\nStopping their motion through space, but maintaining a time field that\npermitted them to work without consuming precious time, Arcot formed\nsome more cosmium, but now he subjected it to a special type of\nconverted field, and into the cosmium, he forced some light photons,\nhalf bound, half free. The fixture he formed into the letters, and\nwelded forever on the gigantic prow of the ship, and on its huge sides.\n_Thought_, it stood in letters ten feet high, made of clear transparent\ncosmium, and the golden light photons, imprisoned in it, the slowly\ndisintegrating lux metal, would cause those letters to shine for\ncountless aeons with the steady golden light they now had.\n\nThe _Thought_ continued on now, and as they slowed their progress for\nOrtol, they saw that messengers of Thett had barely arrived. The fort\nhere too had been razed to the ground, and now they were concentrating\nover the largest city of Ortol. Their rays were beating down on the\ngreat ray screen that terrestrial engineers had set up, protecting the\ncity, as Earth had been protected. But the fleet that stood guard was\nsmall, and was rapidly being destroyed. A fort broke free, and plunged\nat last for the ray screen. Its relux walls glowed a thousand colors as\nthe tremendous energy of the ray-screen struck them--but it was through!\n\nA molecular ray reached down for the city--and stopped halfway in a\ntremendous coruscating burst of light and energy. Yet there was none of\nthe sheen of the ray screen. Merely light.\n\nThe fort was still driving downward. Then suddenly it stopped, and the\nside dented in like the side of a can some one has stepped on, and it\ncame to sudden rest against an invisible, impenetrable barrier. A\nmolecular reached down from somewhere in space, hit the ray screen of\nOrtol, which the Thessians had attacked for hours, and the screen\nflashed into sudden brilliance, and disappeared. The ray struck the\nThessian fort, and the fort burst into tremendous opalescence, while the\ninvisible barrier the ray had struck was suddenly a great sheet of\nflaming light. In less than half a second the opalescence was gone, the\nfort shuddered, and shrieked out of the planet's atmosphere, a mass of\nlux now, and susceptible to the moleculars. And everything that lived\nwithin that fort had died instantly and painlessly.\n\nThe fleet which had been preparing to follow the leading fort was\nsuddenly stopped; it halted indecisively.\n\nThen the _Thought_ became visible as its great golden letters showed\nsuddenly, streaking up from distant space. Every ship turned cosmic and\nmoleculars on it. The cosmic rebounded from the cosmium walls, and from\nthe artificial matter that protected the eyes. The moleculars did not\naffect either, but the invisible protective sheet that the _Thought_ was\nmaintaining in the Ortolian atmosphere became misty as it fought the\nslight molecular rebounds.\n\nThe _Thought_ went into action. The fort which remained was the point of\nattack. The fort had turned its destructive ray on the cosmium ship with\nthe result that, as before, the cosmium slowly disintegrated into puffs\nof cosmic rays. The vapor seemed to boil out, puff suddenly, then was\ngone. Arcot put up a wall of artificial matter to test the effect. The\nray went right through the matter, without so much as affecting it. He\ntried a sheet of pure energy, an electro-magnetic energy stream of\ntremendous power. The ray bent sharply to one side. But in a moment the\nThessians had realigned it.\n\n\"It's a photonic stream, but of some type that doesn't affect ordinary\nmatter, but only artificial matter such as lux, relux, or cosmium. If\nthe artificial matter would only fight it, I'd be all right.\" The\nthought running through Arcot's mind reached the others.\n\nA tremendous burst of light energy to the rear announced the fact that a\nThessian had crashed against the artificial matter wall that surrounded\nthe ship. Arcot was throwing the Thessian destructive beam from side to\nside now, and twice succeeded in misdirecting it so that it hit the\nenemy machines.\n\nThe _Thought_ sent out its terrific beam of magnetic energy. The ray was\nsuddenly killed, and the fort cruised helplessly on. Its driving\napparatus was dead. The diffused cosmic reached out, and as the magnetic\nfield, the relux and the cosmics interacted, the great fort was suddenly\nblue-white--then instantly a dust that scattered before an enormous\nblast of air.\n\nFrom the _Thought_ a great shell of artificial matter went, a visible,\nmisty wall, that curled forward, and wrapped itself around the Thessian\nships with a motion of tremendous speed, yet deceptive, for it seemed to\nbillow and flow.\n\nA Thessian warship decided to brush it away--and plowed into\ninconceivable strength. The ship crumpled to a mass of broken relux.\n\nThe greater part of the Thessian fleet had already fled, but there\nremained half a hundred great battleships. And now, within half a\nmillion miles of the planet, there began a battle so weird that\nastronomers who watched could not believe it.\n\nFrom behind the _Thought_, where it hung motionless beyond the misty\nwall, a Thing came.\n\nThe Thessian ships had realized now that the misty sphere that walled\nthem in was impenetrable, and their rays were off, for none they now had\nwould penetrate it. The forts were gone.\n\nBut the Thing that came behind the _Thought_ was a ship, a little ship\nof the same misty white, and it flowed into, and through the wall, and\nwas within their prison. The Thessian ships turned their rays toward it,\nand waited. What was this thing?\n\nThe ovaloid ship which drifted so slowly toward them suddenly seemed to\njerk, and from it reached pseudopods! An amoeba on a titanic scale! It\nwrithed its way purposefully toward the nearest ship, and while that\nship waited, a pseudopod reached out, and suddenly drove through the\nfour foot relux armor! A second pseudopod followed with lightning\nrapidity, and in an instant the ship had been split from end to end!\n\nNow a hundred rays were leaping toward the thing, and the rays burst\ninto fire and gouts of light, blackened, burned pseudopods seemed to\nfall from the thing and hastily it retreated from the enclosure, flowing\nonce more through the wall that stopped their rays.\n\nBut another Thing came. It was enormous, a mile long, a great, shining\nscaly thing, a dragon, and on its mighty neck was mounted an enormous,\ndistorted head, with great flat nose and huge flapping nostrils. It was\na Thessian head! The mouth, fifty feet across, wrinkled into an horrific\ngrin, and broken, stained teeth of iron showed in the mouth. Great\ntalons upraised, it rent the misty wall that bound them, and writhed its\nawful length in. The swish of its scales seemed to come to the watchers,\nas it chased after a great battleship whose pilot fled in terror. Faster\nthan the mighty spaceship the awful Thing caught it in mighty talons\nthat ripped through solid relux. Scratching, fluttering enormous,\nblood-red wings, the silvery claws tore away great masses of relux,\nsending them flying into space.\n\nAgain rays struck at it. Cosmic and moleculars with blinding pencils of\nlight. For now in the close space of the Wall was an atmosphere, the air\nof two great warships, and though the space was great, the air in the\nships was dense.\n\nThe rays struck its awful face. The face burst into light, and black,\ngreasy smoke steamed up, as the thing writhed and twisted horribly,\nawful screams ringing out. Then it was free, and half the face was\nburned away, and a grinning, bleeding, half-cooked face writhed and\nscreamed in anger at them. It darted at the nearest ship, and ripped out\nthat ray that burned it--and quivered into death. It quivered, then\nquickly faded into mist, a haze, and was gone!\n\nA last awful thing--a thing they had not noticed as all eyes watched\nthat Thing--was standing by the rent in the Sphere now, the gigantic\nThessian, with leering, bestial jaws, enormous, squat limbs, the webbed\nfingers and toes, and the heavy torso of his race, grinning at them. In\none hand was a thing--and his jaws munched. Thett's men stared in horror\nas they recognized that thing in his hand--a Thessian body! He grinned\nhappily and reached for a battleship--a ray burned him. He howled, and\nleaped into their midst.\n\nThen the Thessians went mad. All fought, and they fought each other,\nrays of all sorts, their moleculars and their cosmics, while in their\nmidst the Giant howled his glee, and laughed and laughed--\n\nEventually it was over, and the last limping Thessian ship drove itself\ncrazily against the wreck of its last enemy. And only wreckage was left.\n\n\"Lord, Arcot! Why in the Universe did you do that--and how did you\nconceive those horrors?\" asked Morey, more than a little amazed at the\ntactics Arcot had displayed.\n\nArcot shook himself, and disconnected his controls. \"Why--why I don't\nknow. I don't know what made me do that, I'm sure. I never imagined\nanything like that dragon thing--how did--\"\n\nHis keen eyes fixed themselves suddenly on Zezdon Fentes, and their\ntremendous hypnotic power beat down the resistance of the Ortolian's\ntrained mind. Arcot's mind opened for the others the thoughts of Zezdon\nFentes.\n\nHe had acted as a medium between the minds of the Thessians, and Arcot.\nTaking the horror-ideas of the Thessians, he had imprinted them on\nArcot's mind while Arcot was at work with the controls. In Arcot's mind,\nthey had acted exactly as had the ideas that night on Earth, only here\nthe demonstration had been carried to the limit, and the horror ideas\nwere compounded to the utmost. The Thessians, highly developed minds\nthough they were, were not resistant and they had broken. The Allies,\nwith their different horror-ideas, had been but slightly affected.\n\n\"We will leave you on Ortol, Zezdon Fentes. We know you have done much,\nand perhaps your own mind has given a bit. We hope you recover. I think\nyou agree with me, Zezdon Afthen and Inthel?\" thought Arcot.\n\n\"We do, heartily, and are heartily sorry that one of our race has acted\nin this way. Let us proceed to Talso, as soon as possible. You might\nsend Fentes down in a shell of artificial matter,\" suggested Zezdon\nAfthen.\n\n\"Which,\" said Arcot, after this had been done, and they were on their\nway to Talso, \"shows the danger of a mad _Thought_!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\nTHE POWER OF \"_THE THOUGHT_\"\n\n\nBut it seemed, or must have seemed to any infinite being capable of\nwatching it as it moved now, that the _Thought_ was a mad thought. With\nthe time control opened to the limit, and a touch of the space control,\nit fled across the Universe at a velocity such as no other thing was\ncapable of.\n\nOne star--it flashed to a disc, loomed enormous--overpowering--then\nsuddenly they were flashing _through_ it! The enormous coils fed their\ncurrent into the space-coils and the time field, and the ship seemed to\ntwist and writhe in distorted space as the gravitational field of a\ngiant star, and a giant ship's space field fought for a fraction of time\nso short as to be utterly below measurement. Then the ship was gone--and\nbehind it a star, the center of which had suddenly been hurled into\nanother space forever, as the counteracting, gravitational field of the\nouter layers was removed for a moment, and only its own enormous density\naffected space, writhed and collapsed upon itself, to explode into a\nmighty sea of flames. Planets it formed, we know, by a process such as\ncan happen when only this man-made accident happens.\n\nBut the ship fled on, its great coils partly discharged, but still far\nmore charged than need be.\n\nIt was minutes to Talso where it had been hours with the _Ancient\nMariner_, but now they traveled with the speed of _Thought_!\n\nTalso too was the scene of a battle, and more of a battle than Ortol had\nbeen, for here where more powerful defensive forces had been active, the\nThessians had been more vengeful. All their remaining ships seemed\nconcentrated here. And the great molecular screen that terrestrian\nengineers had flung up here had already fallen. Great holes had\nopened in it, as two great forts, and a thousand ships, some mighty\nbattleships of the intergalactic spaces, some little scout cruisers,\nhad turned their rays on the struggling defensive machines. It had held\nfor hours, thanks to the tremendous tubes that Talso had in their\npower-distribution stations, but in the end had fallen, but not before\nmany of their largest cities had been similarly defended, and the people\nof the others had scattered broadcast.\n\nTrue, wherever they might be, a diffused molecular would find them and\ndestroy all life save under the few screens, but if the Thessians once\ndiffused their rays, without entering the atmosphere, the broken screen\nwould once more be able to hold.\n\nNo fleet had kept the Thessian forces out of this atmosphere, but dozens\nof more adequately powered artificial matter bomb stations had taught\nThett respect for Talso. But Talso's own ray screen had stopped their\nbombs. They could only send their bombs as high as the screen. They did\nnot have Arcot's tremendous control power to maintain the matter without\ndifficulty even beyond a screen.\n\nAt last the screen had fallen, and the Thessian ships, a hole once made,\nwere able to move, and kept that hole always under them, though if it\nonce were closed, they would again have the struggle to open it.\n\nExploding matter bombs had twice caused such spatial strains and ionized\nconditions as to come near closing it, but finally the Thessian fleet\nhad arranged a ring of ships about the hole, and opened a cylinder of\nrays that reached down to the planet.\n\nLike some gigantic plow the rays tore up mountains, oceans, glaciers and\nland. Tremendous chasms opened in straight lines as it plowed along.\nUnprotected cities flashed into fountains of rock and soil and steel\nthat leaped upwards as the rays touched, and were gone. Protected\ncities, their screens blazing briefly under the enormous ray\nconcentrations as the ships moved on, unheeding, stood safe on islands\nof safety amidst the destruction. Here in the lower air, where ions\nwould be so plentiful, Thett did not try to break down the screens, for\nthe air would aid the defenders.\n\nFinally, as Thett's forces had planned, they came to one of the ionized\nlayer ray-screen stations that was still projecting its cone of\nprotective screening to the layer above. Every available ray was turned\non that station, and, designed as it was for protecting part of a world,\nthe station was itself protected, but slowly, slowly as its already\nheated tubes weakened their electronic emission, the disc of ions\nretreated more and more toward the station, as, like some splashing\nstream, the Thessian rays played upon it forcing it back. A rapidly\naccelerating retreat, faster and faster, as the disc changed from the\ndull red of normal defense to the higher and bluer quanta of failing,\nless complete defense, the disc of interference retreated.\n\nThen, with a flash of light, and a roar as the soil below spouted up,\nthe station was gone. It had failed.\n\nInstantly the ring of ships expanded as the great screen was weakened by\nthe withdrawal of this support. Wider was the path of destruction now as\nthe forces moved on.\n\nBut high, high in the sky, far out of sight of the naked eye, was a tiny\nspot that was in reality a giant ship. It was flashing forward, and in\nmoments it was visible. Then, as another deserted city vanished, it was\nabove the Thessian fleet.\n\nTheir rays were directed downward through a hole that was even larger. A\nsecond station had gone with that city. But, as by magic, the hole\nclosed up, and chopped their rays off with a decisiveness that startled\nthem. The interference was so sharp now that not even the dullest of\nreds showed where their beams touched. The close interference was giving\noff only radio! In amazement they looked for this new station of such\nenormous power that their combined rays did not noticeably affect it. A\nworld had been fighting their rays unsuccessfully. What single station\ncould do this, if the many stations of the world could not? There was\nbut one they knew of, and they turned now to search for the ship they\nknew must be there.\n\n\"No horrors this time; just clean, burning energy,\" muttered Arcot.\n\nIt was clean, and it was burning. In an instant one of the forts was a\nmass of opalescence that shifted so swiftly it was purest white, then\nrocketed away, lifeless, and no longer relux.\n\nThe other fort had its screen up, though its power, designed to\nwithstand the attack of a fleet of enormous intergalactic,\nmatter-driven, fighting ships lasted but an instant under the driving\npower of half a million million suns, concentrated in one enormous ray\nof energy. The sheer energy of the ray itself, molecular ray though it\nwas, heated the material it struck to blinding incandescence even as it\nhurled it at a velocity close to that of light into outer space. With\nlittle sparkling flashes battleships of the void after giant cruisers\nflashed into lux, and vanished under the ray.\n\nA tremendous combined ray of magnetism and cosmic ray energy replaced\nthe molecular, and the ships exploded into a dust as fine as the\nprimeval gas from which came all matter.\n\nSweeping energy, so enormous that the defenses of the ships did not even\noperate against it, shattered ship after ship, till the few that\nremained turned, and, faster than the pursuing energies could race\nthrough space, faster than light, headed for their base.\n\n\"That was fair fight; energy against energy,\" said Arcot delightedly,\nfor his new toy, which made playthings of suns and fed on the cosmic\nenergy of a universe, was behaving nicely, \"and as I said, Stel Felso\nTheu, at the beginning of this war, the greater Power wins, always. And\nin our island here, I have five hundred thousand million separate power\nplants, each generating at the rate of decillions of ergs a second,\nbacking this ship.\n\n\"Your world will be safe now, and we will head for our last embattled\nally, Sirius.\" The titanic ship turned, and disappeared from the view of\nthe madly rejoicing billions of Talso below, as it sped, far faster than\nlight, across a universe to relieve another sorely tried civilization.\n\nKnowing their cause was lost, hopeless in the knowledge that nothing\nknown to them could battle that enormous force concentrated in one ship,\nthe _Thought_, the Thessians had but one aim now, to do all the damage\nin their power before leaving.\n\nAlready their tremendous, unarmed and unarmored transports were\ndeparting with their hundreds of thousands from that base system for the\nfar-off Island of Space from which they had come. Their battlefleets\nwere engaged in destroying all the cities of the allies, and those other\nhelpless races of our system that they could. Those other inhabited\nworlds, many of which were completely wiped out because Arcot had no\nknowledge of them, were relieved only when the general call for retreat\nto protect the mother planet was sent out.\n\nBut Sirius was looming enormous before them. And its planets, heavily\ndefended now by the combined Sirian, Terrestrial and Venerian fleets and\ngreat ray screens as well as a few matter-bomb stations, were suffering\nlosses none the less. For the old Sixth of Negra, the Third here, had\nfallen. Slipping in on the night side of the planet, all power off, and\nso sending forth no warning impulses till it actually fell through the\nray screen, a small fleet of scouts had entered. Falling still under\nsimple gravity, they had been missed by the rays till they had fallen to\nso small a distance, that no humans or men of our allied systems could\nhave stopped, but only their enormous iron boned strength permitted them\nto resist the acceleration they used to avert collision with the planet.\nThen scattering swiftly, they had blasted the great protective screen\nstations by attacking on the sides, where the ray screen projectors were\nnot mounted. Designed to protect above, they had no side armor, and the\nSixth was opened to attack.\n\nTwo and one-half billion people lost their lives painlessly and\ninstantaneously as tremendous diffused moleculars played on the\nrevolving planet.\n\nArcot arrived soon after this catastrophe. The Thessians left almost\nimmediately, after the loss of three hundred or more ships. One hundred\nand fifty wrecks were found. The rest were so blasted by the forces\nwhich attacked them, that no traces could be found, and no count made.\n\nBut as those ships fled back to their base, Arcot, with the wonderfully\ndelicate mental control of his ship, was able to watch them, and follow\nthem; for, invisible under normal conditions, by twisting space in the\nsame manner that they did he was able to see them flee, and follow.\n\nLight year after light year they raced toward the distant base. They\nreached it in two hours, and Arcot saw them from a distance sink to the\nvarious worlds. There were twelve gigantic worlds, each far larger than\nJupiter of Sol, and larger than Stwall of Talso's sun, Renl.\n\n\"I think,\" said Arcot as he stopped the ship at a third of a light year,\n\"that we had best destroy those planets. We may kill many men, and\ninnocent non-combatants, but they have killed many of our races, and it\nis necessary. There are, no doubt, other worlds of this Universe here\nthat we do not know of that have felt the vengeance of Thett, and if we\ncan cause such trouble to them by destroying these worlds, and putting\nthe fear of our attacking their mother world into them, they will call\noff those other fleets. I could have been invisible to Thett's ships as\nwe followed them here, and for the greater part of the way I was, for I\nwas sufficiently out of their time-rate, so that they were visible only\nby the short ultra-violet, which would have put in their infra-red, and,\nno photo-electric cell will work on quanta of such low energy. When at\nlast I was sure of the sun for which they were heading, I let them see\nus, and they know we are aware of their base, and that we can follow\nthem.\n\n\"I will destroy one of these worlds, and follow a fleet as it starts for\ntheir home nebula. Gradually, as they run, I will fade into\ninvisibility, and they will not know that I have dropped back here to\ncomplete the work, but will think I am still following. Probably they\nwill run to some other nebula in an effort to throw me off, but they\nwill most certainly send back a ship to call the fleets here to the\ndefense of Thett.\n\n\"I think that is the best plan. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Arcot,\" asked Morey slowly, \"if this race attempts to settle another\nUniverse, what would that indicate of their own?\"\n\n\"Hmmm--that it was either populated by their own race or that another\nrace held the parts they did not, and that the other race was stronger,\"\nreplied Arcot. \"The thought idea in their minds has always been a single\nworld, single solar system as their home, however.\"\n\n\"And single solar systems cannot originate in this Space,\" replied\nMorey, referring to the fact that in the primeval gas from which all\nmatter in this Universe and all others came, no condensation of mass\nless than thousands of millions of times that of a sun could form and\ncontinue.\n\n\"We can only investigate--and hope that they do not inhabit the whole\nsystem, for I am determined that, unpleasant as the idea may be, there\nis one race that we cannot afford to have visiting us, and it is going\nto be permanently restrained in one way or another. I will first have a\nconference with their leaders and if they will not be peaceful--the\n_Thought_ can destroy or make a Universe! But I think that a second race\nholds part of that Universe, for several times we have read in their\nminds the thought of the 'Mighty Warless Ones of Venone.'\"\n\n\"And how do you plan to destroy so large a planet as these are?\" asked\nMorey, indicating the telectroscope screen.\n\n\"Watch and see!\" said Arcot.\n\nThey shot suddenly toward the distant sun, and as it expanded, planets\ncame into view. Moving ever slower on the time control, Arcot drove the\nship toward a gigantic planet at a distance of approximately 300,000,000\nmiles from its primary, the sun of this system.\n\nArcot fell into step with the planet as it moved about in its orbit, and\nwatched the speed indicator carefully.\n\n\"What's the orbital speed, Morey?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"About twelve and a half miles per second,\" replied the somewhat\nmystified Morey.\n\n\"Excellent, my dear Watson,\" replied Arcot. \"And now does my dear friend\nknow the average molecular velocity of ordinary air?\"\n\n\"Why, about one-third of a mile a second, average.\"\n\n\"And if that planet as a whole should stop moving, and the individual\nmolecules be given the entire energy, what would their average velocity\nbe? And what temperature would that represent?\" asked Arcot.\n\n\"Good--Why, they would have to have the same kinetic energy as\nindividuals as they now have as a whole, and that would be an average\nmolecular velocity in random motion of 12.5 miles a second--giving\nabout--about--about--twelve thousand degrees centigrade!\" exclaimed\nMorey in surprise. \"That would put it in the far blue-white region!\"\n\n\"Perfect. Now watch.\" Arcot donned the headpiece he had removed, and\nonce more took charge. He was very far from the planet, as distances go,\nand they could not see his ship. But he wanted to be seen. So he moved\ncloser, and hung off to the sunward side of the planet, then moved to\nthe night side, but stayed in the light. In seconds, a battlefleet was\nout attempting to destroy him.\n\nSurrounding the ship with a wall of artificial matter, lest they annoy\nhim, he set to work.\n\nDirectly in the orbit of the planet, a faint mistiness appeared, and\nrapidly solidified to a titanic cup, directly in the path of the planet.\n\nArcot was pouring energy into the making of that matter at such a rate\nthat space was twisted now about them. The meter before them, which had\nnot registered previously, was registering now, and had moved over to\nthree. Three sols--and was still climbing. It stopped when ten were\nreached. Ten times the energy of our sun was pouring into that\ncondensation, and it solidified quickly.\n\nThe Thessians had seen the danger now. It was less than ten minutes away\nfrom their planet, and now great numbers of ships of all sorts started\nup from the planet, swarming out like rats from a sinking vessel.\n\nMajestically the great world moved on in its orbit toward the thin wall\nof infinite strength and infinite toughness. Already Thessian\nbattleships were tearing at that wall with rays of all types, and the\nwall sputtered back little gouts of light, and remained. The meters on\nthe _Thought_ were no longer registering. The wall was built, and now\nArcot had all the giant power of the ship holding it there. Any attempt\nto move it or destroy it, and all the energy of the Universe would rush\nto its defense!\n\nThe atmosphere of the planet reached the wall. Instantly, as the\npressure of that enormous mass of air touched it, the wall fought, and\nburst into a blaze of energy. It was fighting now, and the meter that\nmeasured sun-powers ran steadily, swiftly up the scale. But the men were\nnot watching the meter; they were watching the awesome sight of Man\nstopping a world in its course! Turning a world from its path!\n\nBut the meter climbed suddenly, and the world was suddenly a tremendous\nblaze of light. The solid rock had struck the giant cup, 110,000 miles\nin diameter. It was silent, as a world pitted its enormous kinetic\nenergy against the combined forces of a universe. Soundless--and as\nhopeless. Its strength was nothing, its energy pitted unnoticed against\nthe energy of five hundred thousand million suns--as vain as those\nfutile attempts of the Thessian battleships on the invulnerable walls of\nthe _Thought_.\n\nWhat use is there to attempt description of that scene as\n2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of rock and metal and matter\ncrashed against a wall of energy, immovable and inconceivable. The\nplanet crumpled, and split wide. A thousand pieces, and suddenly there\nwas a further mistiness about it, and the whole enormous mass, seeming\nbut a toy, as it was from this distance in space, and as it was in this\nship, was enclosed in that same, immovable, unalterable wall of energy.\n\nThe ship was as quiet and noiseless, as without indication of strain as\nwhen it hummed its way through empty space. But the planet crumpled and\ntwirled, and great seas of energy flashed about it.\n\nThe world, seeming tiny, was dashed helpless against a wall that stopped\nit, but the wall flared into equal and opposite energy, so that matter\nwas raised not to the twelve thousand Morey had estimated but nearer\ntwenty-four thousand degrees. It was over in less than half an hour, and\na broken, misshapen mass of blue incandescence floated in space. It\nwould fall now, toward the sun, and it would, because it was motionless\nand the sun moved, take an eccentric orbit about that sun. Eventually,\nperhaps, it would wipe out the four inferior planets, or perhaps it\nwould be broken as it came within the Roches limit of that sun. But the\nplanet was now a miniature sun, and not so very small, at that.\n\nAnd from every planet of the system was pouring an assorted stream of\nships, great and small, and they all set panic-stricken across the void\nin the same direction. They had seen the power of the _Thought_, and did\nnot contest any longer its right to this system.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\nTHETT\n\n\nThrough the utter void of intergalactic space sped a tiny shell, a wee\nmite of a ship. Scarcely twenty feet long, it was one single power\nplant. The man who sat alone in it, as it tore through the void at the\nmaximum speed that even its tiny mass was capable of, when every last\ntwist possible had been given to the distorted time fields, watched a\nfar, far galaxy ahead that seemed unchanging.\n\nHours, days sped by, and he did not move from his position in the ship.\nBut the ship had crossed the great gulf, and was speeding through the\ngalaxy now. He was near the end. At a reckless speed, he sat motionless\nbefore the controls, save for slight movements of supple fingers that\ndirected the ship at a mad pace about some gigantic sun and its family\nof planets. Suns flashed, grew to discs, and were left behind in the\nbriefest instant.\n\nThe ship slowed, the terrific pace it had been holding fell, and dull\nwhine of overworked generators fell to a contented hum. A star was\nlooming, expanding before it. The great sun glowed the characteristic\nred of a giant as the ship slowed to less than a light-speed, and turned\ntoward a gigantic planet that circled the red sun. The planet was very\nclose to 50,000 miles in diameter, and it revolved at a distance of four\nand one half billions of miles from the surface of its sun, which made\nthe distance to the center of the titanic primary four billion, eight\nhundred million miles, in round figures, for the sun's diameter was\nclose to six hundred and fifty million miles! Greater even than Antares,\nwhose diameter is close to four hundred million miles, was this star of\nanother universe, and even from the billions of miles of distance that\nits planet revolved, the disc was enormous, a titanic disc of dull red\nflame. But so low was its surface temperature, that even that enormous\ndisc did not overheat the giant planet.\n\nThe planet's atmosphere stretched out tens of thousands of miles into\nspace, and under the enormous gravitational acceleration of the\ntremendous mass of that planet, it was near the surface a blanket dense\nas water. There was no temperature change upon it, though its night was\none hundred hours long, and its day the same. The centrifugal force of\nthe rapid rotation of this enormous body had flattened it when still\nliquid till it seemed now more of the shape of a pumpkin than of an\norange. It was really a double planet, for its satellite was a world of\none hundred thousand miles diameter, yet smaller in comparison to its\ngiant primary than is Luna in comparison to Earth. It revolved at a\ndistance of five million miles from its primary's center, and it, too,\nwas swarming with its people.\n\nBut the racing ship sped directly toward the great planet, and shrieked\nits way down through the atmosphere, till its outer shell was radiating\nfar in the violet.\n\nStraight it flew to where a gigantic city sprawled in the heaped, somber\nmasonry, but in some order yet, for on closer inspection the appearance\nof interlaced circles came over the edge of the giant cities. Ray\nscreens were circular and the city was protected by dozens of stations.\n\nThe scout was going well under the speed of light now, and a message,\nimperative and commanding, sped ahead of him. Half a dozen patrol boats\nflashed up, and fell in beside him, and with him raced to a gigantic\nbuilding that reared its somber head from the center of the city.\n\nUnder a white sky they proceeded to it, and landed on its roof. From the\nlittle machine the single man came out. Using the webbed hands and feet\nthat had led the Allied scientists to think them an aquatic race, he\nswam upward, and through the water-dense atmosphere of the planet toward\nthe door.\n\nTrees overtopped the building, for it had but four stories, above\nground, though it was the tallest in the city. The trees, like seaweed,\nfloated most of their enormous weight in the dense air, but the\nbuildings under the gravitational acceleration, which was more than one\nhundred times Earth's gravity, could not be built very high ere they\ncrumple under their own weight. Though one of these men weighed\napproximately two hundred pounds on Earth, for all their short stature,\non this planet their weight was more than ten tons! Only the enormously\ndense atmosphere permitted them to move.\n\nAnd such an atmosphere! At a temperature of almost exactly 360 degrees\ncentigrade, there was no liquid water on the planet, naturally. At that\ntemperature water cannot be a liquid, no matter what the pressure, and\nit was a gas. In their own bodies there was liquid water, but only\nbecause they lived on heat, their muscles absorbed their energy for work\nfrom the heat of the air. They carried in their own muscles\nrefrigeration, and, with that aid, were able to keep liquid water for\ntheir life processes. With death, the water evaporated. Almost the\nentire atmosphere was made up of oxygen, with but a trace of nitrogen,\nand some amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nHere their enormous strength was not needed, as Arcot had supposed, to\nmove their own bodies, but to enable them to perform the ordinary tasks\nof life. The mere act of lifting a thing weighing perhaps ten pounds on\nEarth, here required a lifting force of more than half a ton! No wonder\nenormous strength had been developed! Such things as a man might carry\nwith him, perhaps a ray pistol, would weigh half a ton; his money would\nweigh near to a hundred pounds!\n\nBut--there were no guns on this world. A man could throw a stone perhaps\na short distance, but when a gravitational acceleration of more than a\nhalf a mile per second acted on it, and it was hurled through an\natmosphere dense as water--what chance was there for a long range?\n\nBut these little men of enormous strength did not know other schemes of\nexistence, save in the abstract, and as things of comical peculiarity.\nTo them life on a planet like Earth was as life to a terrestrian on a\nplanetoid such as Ceres, Juno or Eros would have seemed. Even on\nThettsost, the satellite planet of Thett, life was strange, and they\nused lux roofs over their cities, though their weight there was four\ntons!\n\nAs the scout swam through the dense atmosphere of his world toward the\nentrance way to the building, guards stopped him, and examined his\ncredentials. Then he was led through long halls, and down a shaft ten\nstories below the planet's surface, to where a great table occupied a\npart of a low ceilinged, wide room. This room was shielded, interference\nscreens of all known kinds lined the hollow walls, no rays could reach\nthrough it to the men within. The guard changed, and new men examined\nthe scout's credentials, and he was led still deeper into the bowels of\nthe planet. Once more the guard changed, and he entered a room guarded\nnot by single shields but by triple, and walled with six foot relux, and\nceiled with the same strong material. But here, under the enormous\ngravity, even its great strength required aid in the form of pillars.\n\nA giant of his race sat before a low table. The table ran half the\nlength of the room, and beside it sat four other men. But there were\nplaces for more than two dozen.\n\n\"A scout from the colony? What news?\" demanded the leader. His voice was\na growl, deep and throaty.\n\n\"Oh mighty Sthanto, I bring news of resistance. We waited too long, in\nour explorations, and those men of World 3769-8482730-3 have learned too\nmuch. We were wrong. They had found the secret of exceeding the speed of\nlight, and can travel through space fully as rapidly as we can, and now,\nsince by some means we cannot fathom, they have learned to combine both\nour own system and theirs, they have one enormous engine of destruction\nthat travels across their huge universe in less time than it takes us to\ntravel across a planetary system.\n\n\"Our cause is lost, which is by far the least of our troubles. Thett is\nin danger. We cannot hope to combat that ship.\"\n\n\"Thalt--what means have we. Can we not better them?\" demanded Sthanto of\nhis chief scientist.\n\n\"Great Sthanto, we know that such a substance can be made when pressure\ncan be brought to bear on cosmic rays under the influence of field\n24-7649-321, but that field cannot be produced, because no sufficient\nconcentration of energy is available. Energy cannot be released rapidly\nenough to replace the losses when the field is developing. The fact that\nthey have that material indicates their possession of an unguessed and\nterrific energy source. I would have said that there was no energy\ngreater than the energy of matter, but we know the properties of this\nmaterial and that the triple ray which has at last been perfected, can\nbe produced providing your order for all energy sources is given, will\nrelease its energy at a speed comparable to the rate of energy relux in\na twin ray, but that the release takes place only in the path of the\nray.\"\n\n\"What more, Scout?\" asked Sthanto smoothly.\n\n\"The ship first appeared in connection with our general attack on world\n3769-8482730-3. The attack was near success, their screens were already\nfailing. They have devised a new and very ionized layer as a conductor.\nIt was exceedingly difficult to break, and since their sun had been\nsimilarly screened, we could not throw masses of that matter upon them.\n\n\"In another sthan of time, we would have destroyed their world. Then the\nship appeared. It has molecular rays, magnetic beams and cosmic rays,\nand a fourth weapon we know nothing of. It has molecular screens, we\nsuspect, but has not had occasion to use them.\n\n\"Our heaviest molecular screens flash under their molecular rays.\nOrdinary screens fall instantly without momentary defense. The ray power\nis incalculable.\n\n\"Their magnetic beams are used in conjunction with cosmics. The action\nof the two causes the relux to induce current, and due to reaction of\ncurrents on the magnetic field--\"\n\n\"And the resistance due to the relux, the relux is first heated to\nincandescence and then the ship opens out as the air pressure bends the\nmagnetically softened relux?\" finished Thalt.\n\n\"No, the effect is even more terrific. It explodes into powder,\" replied\nthe scout.\n\n\"And what happens to worlds that the magnetic ray touches?\" inquired the\nscientist.\n\n\"A corner of it touched the world we fought over, and the world shook,\"\nreplied the colonist.\n\n\"And the last weapon?\" asked Sthanto, his voice soft now.\n\n\"It seems a ghost. It is a mistiness that comes into existence like a\ncloud, and what it touches is crushed, what it rams is shattered. It\nsurrounds the great ship, and machines crashing into it at a speed of\nmore than six times that of light are completely destroyed, without in\nthe slightest injuring the shield.\n\n\"Then--what caused my departure from the colony--it showed once more its\nunutterable power. The mistiness formed in the path of our colonial\nworld, number 3769-1-5, and the planet swept against that wall of\nmistiness, and was shattered, and turned in less than five sthan to a\nball of blue-white fire. The wall stopped the planet in its motion. We\ncould not fight that machine, and we left the worlds. The others are\ncoming,\" finished the scout.\n\nThe ruler turned his slightly smiling face to the commander of his\narmies, who sat beside him.\n\n\"Give orders,\" he said softly, almost gently, \"that a triple ray station\nbe set up under the direction of Thalt, and further notice that all\npower be made instantly available to it. Add that the colonists are\nreturning defeated, and bringing danger at their heels. The triple ray\nwill destroy each ship as it enters the system.\" His hand under the\ntable pushed an invisible protuberance, and from the perfectly\nconducting relux floor to the equally perfectly conducting ceiling, and\nbetween four pillars grouped around the spot where the scout stood,\nterrific arcs suddenly came into being. They lasted for the thousandth\npart of a second, and when they suddenly died away, as swiftly as they\nhad come, there was not even ash where the scout had been.\n\n\"Have you any suggestions, Thalt?\" he asked of the scientist, his voice\nas soft as before.\n\n\"I quite agree with your conduct so far, but the future conduct you had\nplanned is quite unsatisfactory,\" replied the scientist. The ruler sat\nmotionless in his great seat, staring fixedly at the scientist. \"I think\nit is time I take your place, therefore.\" The place where the ruler had\nbeen was suddenly seen as through a dark cloud, then the cloud was gone,\nand with it the king, only his relux chair, and the bits of lux or relux\nthat had been about his garments remained.\n\n\"He was a fool,\" said the scientist softly, as he rose, \"to plan on\nremoving his scientist. Are there any who object to my succession?\"\n\n\"No one objects,\" said Faslar, the ex-king's Prime Minister and\ncouncilor.\n\n\"Then I think, Phantal, Commander of planetary forces, that you had best\nsee Ranstud, my assistant, and follow out the plan outlined by my\npredecessor. And you Tastal, Commander of Fleets, had best bring your\nfleets near the planets for protection. Go.\"\n\n\"May I suggest, mighty Thalt,\" said Faslar after the others had left,\n\"that my knowledge will be exceedingly useful to you. You have two\ncommanders, neither of whom loves you, and neither of whom is highly\ncapable. The family of Thadstil would be glad to learn who removed that\nhonored gentleman, and the family of Datstir would gladly support him\nwho brought the remover of their head to them.\n\n\"This would remove two unwelcome menaces, and open places for such as\nRanstud and your son Warrtil.\n\n\"And,\" he said hastily as he saw a slight shift in Thalt's eyes, \"I\nmight say further that the bereaved ones of Parthel would find great\ninterest in certain of my papers, which are only protected by my\npersonal constant watchfulness.\"\n\n\"Ah, so? And what of Kelston Faln, Faslar?\" smiled the new Sthanta.\n\nThalt's hand relaxed and they started a conversation and discussion on\nmeans of defense.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\nVENONE\n\n\nUp from Earth, out of its clear blue sky, and into the glare and dark of\nspace and near a sun the ship soared. They had been holding it\nmotionless over New York, and now as it rose, hundreds of tiny craft,\nand a few large excursion ships followed it until it was out of Earth's\natmosphere. Then--it was gone. Gone across space, racing toward that far\nUniverse at a speed no other thing could equal. In minutes the great\ndisc of the Universe had taken form behind them, as they took their\nroute photographs to find their way back to Earth after the battle, if\nstill they could come.\n\nThen into the stillness of the Intergalactic spaces.\n\n\"This will be our first opportunity to test the full speed of this ship.\nWe have never tried its velocity, and we should measure it now. Take a\nsight on the diameter of the Island, as seen from here, Morey. Then we\nwill travel ten seconds, and look again.\"\n\nHalf a million light years from the center of the Island now, the great\ndisc spread out over the vast space behind them, apparently the size of\na dinner plate at about thirty inches distance, it was more than two\nhundred and fifty thousand light years across. Checking carefully, Morey\nread their distance as just shy of five hundred thousand light years.\n\n\"Hold on--here we go,\" called Arcot. Space was suddenly black, and\nbeside them ran the twin ghost ships that follow always when space is\nclosed to the smallest compass, for light leaving, goes around a space\nwhose radius is measured in miles, instead of light centuries and\nreturns. There was no sound, no slightest vibration, only Torlos' iron\nbones felt a slight shock as the inconceivable currents flowed into the\ngigantic space distortion coil from the storage fields, their shielded\nmagnetic flux leaking by in some slight degree.\n\nFor ten seconds that seemed minutes Arcot held the ship on the course\nunder the maximum combined powers of space distortion and time field\ndistortion. Then he released both simultaneously.\n\nThe velvet black of space was about them as before, but now the disc of\nthe Nebula was tiny behind them! So tiny was it, that these men, who\nknew its magnitude, gasped in sudden wonder. None of them had been able\nto conceive of such a velocity as this ship had shown! In seconds, Morey\nannounced a moment later, they had traveled _one million, one hundred\nthousand light years_! Their velocity was six hundred and sixty\nquadrillion miles per second!\n\n\"Then it will take us only a little over one thousand seconds to travel\nthe hundred and fifty million light years, at 110,000 light years per\nsecond--that's about the radius of our galaxy, isn't it!\" exclaimed\nWade.\n\nThey started on now, and one thousand and ten seconds, or a little more\nthan eighteen minutes later, they stopped again. So far behind them now\nas to be almost lost in the far scattered universes, lay their own\nIsland, and carefully they photographed the Universe that now lay less\nthan twenty million light years ahead. Still, it was further, even after\ncrossing this enormous gulf, than are many of those nebulae we see from\nEarth, many of which lie within that distance. They must proceed\ncautiously now, for they did not know the exact distance to the Nebula.\nCarefully, running forward in jumps of five million light years,\nforty-five second drives, they worked nearer.\n\nThen finally they entered the Island, and drove toward the denser\ncenter.\n\n\"Good Lord, Arcot, look at those suns!\" exclaimed Morey in amazement.\nFor the first time they were seeing the suns of this system at a range\nthat permitted observation, and Arcot had stopped to observe. The first\none they had chosen had been a blue-white giant of enormous mass, nearly\none hundred and fifty times as heavy as our own sun, and all the\nenormous surface was radiating power into space at a rate of nearly\nthirty thousand horsepower per square inch! No planets circled it,\nhowever, in its journey through space.\n\n\"I've been noticing the number of giants here. Look around.\"\n\nThe _Thought_ moved on, on to other suns. They must find one that was\ninhabited.\n\nThey stopped at last near a great orange giant, and examined it. It had\nindeed planets, and as Arcot watched, he saw in the telectroscope a line\nof gigantic freighters rise from the world, and whisk off to nothingness\nas they exceeded the speed of light! Instantly he started the _Thought_\nsearching in time fields for the freighters. He found them, and followed\nthem as they raced across the void. He knew he was visible to them, and\nas he suspected, they soon stopped, slowing down and signaling to him.\n\n\"Morey--take the _Thought_. I'm going to visit them in the _Banderlog_\nas I think we shall name the tender,\" called Arcot, stripping off the\nheadset, and leaving the control seat. The other fleet of ships was now\nless than a hundred thousand miles away, clearly visible in the\ntelectroscope. They were still signaling, and Arcot had set an automatic\nsignaling device flashing an enormously powerful searchlight toward them\nin a succession of dots and dashes, an obvious signal, though also,\nobviously unintelligible to those others.\n\n\"Is it safe, Arcot?\" asked Torlos anxiously. To approach those enormous\nships in the relatively tiny _Banderlog_ seemed unwise.\n\n\"Far safer than they'll believe. Remember, only the _Thought_ could\nstand up against such weapons as even the _Banderlog_ carries, run as\nthey are by cosmic energy,\" replied Arcot, diving down toward the little\ntender.\n\nIn a moment it was out through the lock, and sped away from them like a\nbullet, reaching the distant stranger fleet in less than ten seconds.\n\n\"They are communicating by thought!\" announced Zezdon Afthen presently.\n\"But I cannot understand them, for the impulses are too weak to be\nintelligently received.\"\n\nFor nearly an hour the _Banderlog_ hung beside the fleet, then it turned\nabout, and raced once more to the _Thought_. Inside the lock, and a\nmoment later Arcot appeared again on the threshold of the door. He\nlooked immensely relieved.\n\n\"Well, I have some good news,\" he said and smiled, sitting down. \"Follow\nthat bunch, Morey, and I'll tell you about it. Set it and she'll hold\nnicely. We have a long way to go, and those are slow freighters,\naccompanied by one Cruiser.\n\n\"Those men,\" he began, \"are men of Venone. You remember Thett's records\nsaid something of the Mighty Warless Ones of Venone? Those are they.\nThey inhabit most of this universe, leaving the Thessians but four\nplanets of a minor sun, way off in one corner. It seems the Thessians\nare their undesirable exiles, those who have, from generation to\ngeneration, been either forced to go there, or who wanted to go there.\n\n\"They did not like the easier and more effective method of disposing of\nundesirables, the instantaneous death chamber they now use. Thett was\ntheir prison world. No one ever returned and his family could go with\nhim if they desired, but if they did not, they were carefully watched\nfor outcroppings of undesirable traits--murder, crime of any sort, any\nhabitual tendency to injustice.\n\n\"About six hundred years ago of our time, Thett revolted. There were\nscientists there, and their scientists had discovered a thing that they\nhad been seeking for generations--the Twin-ray. I don't know what it is,\nand the Venonians don't either. It is the ray that destroys relux and\nlux, however, and can be carried only on a machine the size of their\nforts, due to some limitations. Just what those limitations are the\nVenonians don't know. Other than that ray they had no new weapons.\n\n\"But it was enough. Their guard ships which had circled the worlds of\nthe prison system, Antseck, were suddenly destroyed, so suddenly that\nVenone received no word of it till a consignment ship, bringing\nprisoners, discovered their absence. The consignment ship returned\nwithout landing. Thett was now independent. But they were bound to their\nsystem, for although they had the molecular ships, they had never been\npermitted to have time apparatus, nor to see it, nor was any one who\nknew its principles ever consigned there. The result was that they were\nas isolated as ever.\n\n\"This was for two centuries. Two centuries later it was worked out by\none of their scientists, and the Warless Ones had a War of defense.\nTheir small fleet of cruisers, designed for rescue work and for clearing\nspace lanes of wrecks and asteroids, was destroyed instantly, their\nworld was protected only by the ray screen, which the Thessians did not\nhave, and by the fact that they could build more cruisers. In less than\na year Thett was defeated, and beaten back to her world, though Venone\ncould not overcome Thett, now, for around their planets they had so many\nforts projecting the deadly rays, that no ship could approach.\n\n\"Then Thett learned how to make the screen, and came again. Venone had\nplanetoid stations, that projected molecular rays of an intensity I\nwonder at, with their system of projecting. It seems these people have\nforce-power feeds that operate through space, by which an entire solar\nsystem can tie in for power, and they fed these stations in that way.\nLord only knows what tubes they had, but the Thessians couldn't get the\npower to fight.\n\n\"They've been let alone since then, they did not know why. I told them\nwhat their dear friends had been doing in that time, and the Venonians\nwere immensely surprised, and very evidently sorry. They begged my\npardon for letting loose such a menace, quite sincerely feeling that it\nwas their fault. They offered any help they could give, and I told them\nthat a chart of this system would be of the greatest use. They are going\nnow to Venone, and we are to go with them, and see what they have to\noffer. Also, they want a demonstration of this 'remarkable ship that can\ndefeat whole fleets of Thessians, and destroy or make planets at will,'\"\nconcluded Arcot.\n\n\"I do not in the least blame them for wanting to see this ship in\noperation, Arcot, but they are, very evidently, a much older race than\nyours,\" said Torlos, his thoughts coming clear and sharp, as those of a\nman who has thought over what he says carefully. \"Are you not running\ndanger that their minds may be more powerful than yours, that this story\nthey have told you is but a ruse to get this ship on their world where\nthousand, millions can concentrate their will against you and capture\nthe ship by mind where they cannot capture it by force?\"\n\n\"That,\" agreed Arcot, \"is where 'the rub' comes in as an ancient poet of\nEarth put it. I don't know and I did not have a chance to see. Wherefore\nI am about to do some work. Let me have the controls, Morey, will you?\"\n\nArcot made a new ship. It was made entirely, perforce, of cosmium, lux\nand relux, for those were the only forms of matter he could create in\nspace permanently from energy. It was equipped with gravity drive, and\ntime distortion speed apparatus, and his far better trained mind\nfinished this smaller ship with his titanic tools in less than the two\ndays that it took them to reach Venone. In the meantime, the Venonian\ncruiser had drawn close, and watched in amazement as the ship was\nfashioned from the energy of space, became a thing of glistening matter,\nmaterializing from the absolute void of space, and forming under titanic\ntools such as the commander could not visualize.\n\nNow, this move was partly the reason for this construction, for while\nthe Venonian was busy, absorbed in watching the miraculous construction,\nhis mind was not shielded, and it was open for observation of two such\nwonderfully trained minds as those of Zezdon Afthen and Zezdon Inthel.\nWith their instruments and wonderfully developed mind-science, aided at\ntimes by Morey's less skillful, but more powerful mind of his older\nrace, and powerful too, both because of long concentration and training,\nand because of his individual inheritance, they examined the minds of\nmany of the officers of the ship without their awareness.\n\nAs a final test, Arcot, having finished the ship, suggested that the\nVenonian officer and one of the men of his ship have a trial of mental\npowers.\n\nZezdon Afthen tried first, and between the two ships, racing along side\nby side at a speed unthinkable, the two men struggled with those forces\nof will.\n\nQuickly Zezdon Afthen told Arcot what he had learned.\n\nThe sun of Venone was close, now, and Arcot prepared to use as he\nintended the little space machine he had made. Morey took it, and went\naway from the _Thought_ flying on its time field. The ship had been\nstocked with lead fuel for its matter-burning generators from the supply\nthat had been brought on the _Thought_ for emergencies, and the air had\ncome from the _Thought_'s great tanks. Morey was going to Venone ahead\nof the _Thought_ to scout--\"to see many of the important men of Venone\nand find out from them what I can of the relationship between Venone and\nThett.\"\n\nHours later Morey returned with a favorable report. He had seen many of\nthe important men of Venone, and conversed with them mentally from the\nsafety of his ship, where the specially installed gravity apparatus had\nprotected him and the ship against the enormous gravity of this gigantic\nworld. He did not describe Venone; he wanted them to see it as he had\nfirst seen it.\n\nSo the little ship, which had served its purpose now, was destroyed,\nnearly a light year from Venone, and left a crushed wreck when two\nplates of artificial matter had closed upon it, destroying the\napparatus, lest some unwelcome finder use it. There was little about it,\nthe gravity apparatus alone perhaps, that might have been of use to\nThett, and Thett already had the ray--but why take needless risk?\n\nThen once more they were racing toward Venone. Soon the giant star of\nwhich it was a planet loomed enormous. Then, at Morey's direction, they\nswung, and before them loomed a planet. Large as Thett, near a half\nmillion miles in diameter, its mass was very closely equal to that of\nour sun. Yet it was but the burned-out sweepings of the outermost\nphotospheric layers of this giant sun, and the radioactive atoms that\nmade a sun active were not here; it was a cold planet. But its density\nwas far, far higher than that of our sun, for our sun is but slightly\ndenser than ordinary sea water. This world was dense as copper, for with\nthe deeper sweepings of the tidal strains that had formed it, more of\nthe heavier atoms had gone into its making, and its core was denser than\nthat of Earth.\n\nAbout it swept two gigantic satellite Worlds, each larger than Jupiter,\nbut satellites of a satellite here! And Venone itself was inhabited by\ncountless millions, yet their low, green tile and metal cities were\ninvisible in the aspect of rolling lands with tiny hillocks, dwarfed by\ngigantic bulbous trees that floated their enormous weight in the\nwater-dense atmosphere.\n\nHere, too, there were no seas, for the temperature was above the\ncritical temperature of water, and only in the self-cooling bodies of\nthese men and in the trees which similarly cooled themselves, could\nthere be liquid.\n\nThe sun of the world was another of the giant red stars, close to three\nhundred and fifty times the mass of our sun. It was circled by but three\ngiant planets. Its enormous disc was almost invisible from the surface\nof the world as the _Thought_ sank slowly through fifteen thousand miles\nof air, due to the screening effect on light passing through so much\nair. Earth could have rested on this planet and not extended beyond its\natmosphere! Had Earth been situated at this planet's center, the Moon\ncould have revolved about it, and would not have been beyond the\nplanet's surface!\n\nIn silent wonder the terrestrians watched the titanic world as they\nsank, and their friends looked on amazed, comprehending even less of the\nsignificance of what they saw. Already within the titanic gravitational\nfield, they could see that indescribable effects were being produced on\nthem, and on the ship. Arcot alone could know the enormous gravitation,\nand his accelerometer told him now that he was subject to a\ngravitational acceleration of three thousand four hundred and\neighty-seven feet per second, or almost exactly one hundred and nine\ntimes Earth's pull.\n\n\"The _Thought_ weighs one billion, two hundred and six million, five\nhundred thousand tons, with tender, on Earth. Here it weighs\napproximately one hundred and twenty-one billion tons,\" said Arcot\nsoftly.\n\n\"Can you set it down? It may crush under this load if the gravity drive\nisn't supporting it,\" asked Torlos anxiously.\n\n\"Eight inches cosmium, and everything else supported by cosmium. I made\nthis thing to stand any conceivable strain. Watch--if the planet's\nsurface will take the load,\" replied Arcot.\n\nThey were still sinking, and now a number of small marvelously\nstreamlined ships were clustered around the slowly settling giant. In a\nfew moments more people, hundreds, thousands of men were flying through\nthe air up to the ship.\n\nA cruiser had appeared, and was very evidently intent on leading them\nsomewhere, and Arcot followed it as it streaked through the dense air.\n\"No wonder they streamline,\" he muttered as he saw the enormous force it\ntook to drive the gigantic ship through this air. The air pressure\noutside their ship now was so great, that the sheer crushing effect of\nthe air pressure alone was enormous. The pressure was well over nine\ntons to the square inch, on the surface of that enormous ship!\n\nThey landed approximately fifty miles from a large city which was the\ncapital. The land seemed absolutely level, and the horizon faded off in\ndistance in an atmosphere absolutely clear. There was no dust in the air\nat their height of nearly three hundred feet, for dust was too heavy on\nthis world. There were no clouds. The mountains of this enormous world\nwere not large, could not be large, for their sheer weight would tear\nthem down, but what mountains there were were jagged, tortured rock,\nexceedingly sharp in outline.\n\n\"No rain--no temperature change to break them down,\" said Wade looking\nat them. \"The zone of fracture can't be deep here.\"\n\n\"What, Wade, is the zone of fracture?\" asked Torles.\n\n\"Rock has weight. Any substance, no matter how brittle, will flow if\nsufficient pressure is brought to bear from all sides. A thing which can\nflow will not break or fracture. You can't imagine the pressure to which\nthe rock three hundred feet down is subject to. There is the enormous\nmass of atmosphere, the tremendous mass of rock above, and all forced\ndown by this gravitation. By the time you get down half a mile, the rock\nis under such an inconceivably great pressure that it will flow like\nmud. The rock there cannot break; it merely flows under pressure. Above,\nthe rock can break, instead of flowing. That is the zone of fracture. On\nEarth the zone of fracture is ten miles deep. Here it must be of the\norder of only five hundred feet! And the planetary blocks that made a\nplanet's surface float on the zone of flowage--they determine the zone\nof fracture.\"\n\nThe gigantic ship had been sinking, and now, suddenly it gave a very\nunexpected demonstration of Wade's words. It had landed, and Arcot shut\noff the power. There was a roaring, and the giant ship trembled, rocked,\nand rolled along a bit. Instantly Arcot drove it into the air.\n\n\"Whoa--can't do it. The ship will stand it, and won't bend under the\nload--but the planet won't. We caused a Venone-quake. One of those\nplanetary blocks Wade was talking about slipped under the added strain.\"\n\nQuickly Wade explained that all the planetary blocks were floating,\ntruly floating, and in equilibrium just as a boat must be. The added\nload had been sufficiently great, so that, with an already extant\noverload on this particular planetary block, this \"boat\" had sunk a bit\nfurther into the flowage zone, till it was once more at rest and\nbalanced.\n\n\"They wish us to come out that they may see us, strangers and friends\nfrom another Island,\" interrupted Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"Tell them they'd have to scrape us up off the ground, if we attempted\nit. We come from a world where we weigh about as much as a pebble here,\"\nsaid Wade, grinning at the thought of terrestrians trying to walk on\nthis world.\n\n\"Don't--tell them we'll be right out,\" said Arcot sharply. \"All of us.\"\n\nMorey and the others all stared at Arcot in amazement. It was utterly\nimpossible!\n\nBut Zezdon Afthen did as Arcot had asked. Almost immediately, another\nMorey stepped out of the airlock wearing what was obviously a pressure\nsuit. Behind him came another Wade, Torlos, Stel Felso Theu, and indeed\nall the members of their party save Arcot himself! The Galactians stared\nin wonder--then comprehended and laughed together. Arcot had sent\nartificial matter images of them all!\n\nTheir images stepped out, and the Venonian crowd which had collected,\nstared in wonder at the giants, looming twice their height above them.\n\n\"You see not us, but images of us. We cannot withstand your gravity nor\nyour air pressure, save in the protection of our ship. But these images\nare true images of us.\"\n\nFor some time then they communicated, and finally Arcot agreed to give a\ndemonstration of their power. At the suggestion of the cruiser commander\nwho had seen the construction of a spaceship from the emptiness of\nspace, Arcot rapidly constructed a small, very simple, molecular drive\nmachine of pure cosmium, making it entirely from energy. It required but\nminutes, and the Venonians stared in wonder as Arcot's unbelievable\ntools created the machine before their eyes. The completed ship Arcot\ngave to an official of the city who had appeared. The Venonian looked at\nthe thing skeptically, and half expecting it to vanish like the tools\nthat made it, gingerly entered the port. Powered as it was by lead\nburning cosmic ray generators, the lead alone having been made by\ntransmutation of natural matter, it was powerful, and speedy. The\nofficial entered it, and finding it still existing, tried it out. Much\nto his amazement it flew, and operated perfectly.\n\nNearly ten hours Arcot and his friends stayed at Venone, and before they\nleft, the Venonians, for all their vast differences of structure, had\nproven themselves true, kindly honest men, and a race that our Alliance\nhas since found every reason to respect and honor. Our commerce with\nthem, though carried on under difficulties, is none the less a bond of\ngenuine friendship.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n\nTHETT PREPARES\n\n\nStreaking through the void toward Thett was again a tiny scout ship. It\ncarried but a single man, and with all the power of the machine he was\ndarting toward distant Thett, at a speed insanely reckless, but he knew\nthat he must maintain such a speed if his mission were to be successful.\n\nAgain a tiny ship entered Thett's far-flung atmosphere, and slowed to\nless than a light speed, and sent its signal call ahead. In moments the\npatrol ship, less than three hundred miles away, had reached it, and\ntogether they streaked through the dense air in a screaming dive toward\nShatnsoma, the capital city. It was directly beneath, and it was not\nlong before they had reached the great palace grounds, and settled on\nthe upper roof. Then the scout leaped out of his tiny craft, and dove\nfor the door. Flashing his credentials, he dove down, and into the first\nshielded room. Here precious seconds were wasted while a check was made\nof the credentials the man carried, then he was sent through to the\nCouncil Room. And he, too, stood on that exact spot where the other\nscout, but a few weeks before, had stood--and vanished. Waiting, it\nseemed, were four councilors and the new Sthanto, Thalt.\n\n\"What news, Scout?\" asked the Sthanto.\n\n\"They have arrived in the Universe to Venone, and gone to the planet\nVenone. They were on the planet when I left. None of our scouts were\nable to approach the place, as there were innumerable Venonian watchers\nwho would have recognized our deeper skin-color, and destroyed us. Two\nscouts were rayed, though the Galactians did not see this. Finally we\ncaptured two Venonians who had seen it, and attempted to force the\ninformation we needed from them. A young man and his chosen mate.\n\n\"The man would tell nothing, and we were hurried. So we turned to the\ngirl. These accursed Venonians are courageous for all their pacifism. We\nwere hurried, and yet it was long before we forced her to tell what we\nneeded to know so vitally. She had been one of the notetakers for the\nVenonian government. We got most of their conversation, but she died of\nburns before she finished.\n\n\"The Galactians know nothing of the twin-ray beyond its action, and that\nit is an electro-magnetic phenomenon, though they have been able to\ndistort it by using a sheet of pure energy. But their walls are\nimpregnable to it, and their power of creating matter from the pure\nenergy of space, as we saw from a distance, would enable them to easily\ndefeat it, were it not that the twin-ray passes through matter without\nharming it. Any ray which will destroy matter of the natural electrical\ntypes, will be stopped.\n\n\"The girl was damnably clever, for she gave us only the things we\nalready knew, and but few new facts; knowing that she would inevitably\ndie soon, she talked--but it was empty talk. The one thing of import we\nhave learned is that they burn no fuel, use no fuel of any sort but in\nsome inconceivable manner get their energy from the radiations of the\nsuns of space. This could not be great--but we know she told the truth,\nand we know their power is great. She told the truth, for we could\ndetermine when she lied, by mental action, of course.\n\n\"But more we could not learn. The man died without telling anything,\nmerely cursing. He knew nothing anyway, as we already had determined,\"\nconcluded the scout.\n\nSilently the Sthanto sat in thought for some moments. Then he raised his\nhead, and looked at the scout once more.\n\n\"You have done well. You secured some information of import, which was\nmore than we had dared hope for. But you managed things poorly. The\nwoman should not have died so soon. We can only guess.\n\n\"The radiation of the suns of space--hmmm--\" Sthanto Thalt's brow\nwrinkled in thought. \"The radiation of the _suns_ of space. Were his\npower derived from the sun near which he is operating, he would not have\nsaid _suns_. It was more than one?\"\n\n\"It was, oh Sthanto,\" replied the scout positively.\n\n\"His power is unreasonable. I doubt that he gave the true explanation.\nIt may well have been that he did not trust the Venonians. I would not,\nfor all their warless ways. But surely the suns of space give very\nlittle power at any given point at random. Else space would not be cold.\n\n\"But go, Scout, and you will be assigned a position in the fleet. The\nColonial fleet, the remains of it, have arrived, and the colonists been\nremoved. They failed. We will use their ships. You will be assigned.\"\nThe scout left, and was indeed assigned to a ship of the colonists. The\nincoming colonial transports had been met at the outposts of the system,\nand rayed out of existence at once--failures, and bringing danger at\ntheir heels. Besides--there was no room for them on Thett without\nThessians being crowded uncomfortably.\n\nAs their battleships arrived they were conducted to one of the\nsatellites, and each man was \"fumigated,\" lest he bring disease to the\nmother planet. Men entered, men apparently emerged. But they were\ndifferent men.\n\n\"It seems,\" said the Sthanto softly, after the scout had left, \"that we\nwill have little difficulty, for they are, we know, vulnerable to the\ntriple ray. And if we can but once destroy their driving units they will\nbe helpless on our world. I doubt that wild tale of their using no fuel.\nEven if that be true they will be helpless with their power apparatus\ndestroyed, and--if we miss the first time, we can seek it out, or drive\nthem off!\n\n\"All of which is dependent on the fact that they attack at a point where\nwe have a triple ray station to meet them. There are but three of these,\nactually, but I have had dummy stations, apparently identical with our\nother real stations, set up in many places.\n\n\"This gibberish we hear of creating matter--it is impossible, and surely\nunsuitable as a weapon. Their misty wall--that may be a force plane, but\nI know of no such possibility. The artificial substance though--why\nshould any one make it? It but consumes energy, and once made is no more\ndangerous than ordinary matter, save that there is the possibility of\ncreating it in dangerous position. Remember, we have heard already of\nthe mental suggestions planes--mere force planes--_plus_ a wonderfully\ndeveloped power of suggestion. They do most of their damage by mental\nimpression. Remember, we have heard already of the mental suggestions of\nhorrible things that drove one fleet of the weak-minded colonists mad.\n\n\"And that, I think, we will use to protect ourselves. If we can, with\nthe apparatus which you, my son, have developed, cause them to believe\nthat all the other forts are equally dangerous, and that this one on\nThett is the best point of attack--It will be easy. Can you do it?\"\n\n\"I can, Oh Sthanto, if but a sufficient number of powerful minds may be\nbrought to aid me,\" replied the youngest of the four councilmen.\n\n\"And you, Ranstud, are the stations ready?\" asked the ruler.\n\n\"We are ready.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n\nWITH GALAXIES IN THE BALANCE\n\n\nThe _Thought_ arose from Venone after long hours, and at Arcot's\nsuggestion, they assumed an orbit about the world, at a distance of two\nmillion miles, and all on board slept, save Torlos, the tireless\nmolecular motion machine of flesh and iron. He acted as guard, and as he\nhad slept but four days before, he explained there was really no reason\nfor him to sleep as yet.\n\nBut the terrestrians would feel the greatest strain of the coming\nencounter, especially Arcot and Morey, for Morey was to help by\nrepairing any damage done, by working from the control board of the\n_Banderlog_. The little tender had sufficient power to take care of any\ndamage that Thett might inflict, they felt sure.\n\nFor they had not learned of the triple ray.\n\nIt was hours later that, rested and refreshed, they started for Thett.\nFollowing the great space-chart that they had been given by the\nVenonians, a series of blocks of clear lux metal, with tiny points of\nslowly disintegrating lux, such as had been used to illuminate the\nletters of the _Thought_'s name representing suns, the colors and\nrelative intensity being shown. Then there was a more manageable guide\nin the form of photographs, marked for route by constellations\nformations as well, which would be their actual guide.\n\nAt the maximum speed of the time apparatus, for thus they could better\nfollow the constellations, the _Thought_ plunged along in the wake of\nthe tiny scout ship that had already landed on Thett. And, hours later,\nthey saw the giant red sun of Antseck, the star of Thett and its system.\n\n\"We're about there,\" said Arcot, a peculiar tenseness showing in his\nthoughts. \"Shall we barge right in, or wait and investigate?\"\n\n\"We'll have to chance it. Where is their main fort here?\"\n\n\"From the direction, I should say it was to the left and ahead of our\nposition,\" replied Zezdon Afthen.\n\nThe ship moved ahead, while about it the tremendous Thessian battlefleet\nbuzzed like flies, thousands of ships now, and more coming with each\nsecond.\n\nIn a few moments the titanic ship had crossed a great plain, and came to\na region of bare, rocky hills several hundred feet high. Set in those\nhills, surrounded by them, was a huge sphere, resting on the ground. As\nthough by magic the Thessian fleet cleared away from the _Thought_. The\nlast one had not left, when Arcot shot a terrific cosmic ray toward the\nsphere. It was relux, and he knew it, but he knew what would happen when\nthat cosmic ray hit it. The solometer flickered and steadied at three as\nthat inconceivable ray flashed out.\n\nInstantly there was a terrific explosion. The soil exploded into\nhydrogen atoms, and expanded under heat that lashed it to more than a\nmillion degrees in the tiniest fraction of a second. The terrific recoil\nof the ray-pressure was taken by all space, for it was generated in\nspace itself, but the direct pressure struck the planet, and that\ntitanic planet reeled! A tremendous fissure opened, and the section that\nhad been struck by the ray smashed its way suddenly far into the planet,\nand a geyser of fluid rock rolled over it, twenty miles deep in that\nworld. The relux sphere had been struck by the ray, and had turned it,\nwith the result that it was pushed doubly hard. The enormously thick\nrelux strained and dented, then shot down as a whole, into the\nincandescent rock.\n\nFor miles the vaporized rock was boiling off. Then the fort sent out a\nray, and that ray blasted the rock that had flowed over it as Arcot's\ntitanic ray snapped out. In moments the fort was at the surface\nagain--and a molecular hit it. The molecular did not have the energy the\ncosmic had carried, but it was a single concentrated beam of destruction\nten feet across. It struck the fort--and the fort recoiled under its\nenergy. The marvelous new tubes that ran its ray screen flashed\ninstantly to a temperature inconceivable, and, so long as the elements\nembedded in the infusible relux remained the metals they were, those\ntubes could not fail. But they were being lashed by the energy of half a\nsun. The tubes failed. The elements heated to that enormous temperature\nwhen elements cannot exist--and broke to other elements that did not\nresist. The relux flashed into blinding iridescence--\n\nAnd from the fort came a beam of pure silvery light. It struck the\n_Thought_ just behind the bow, for the operator was aiming for the point\nwhere he knew the control room and pilot must be. But Arcot had designed\nthe ship for mental control, which the enemy operator could not guess.\nThe beam was a flat beam, perhaps an inch thick, but it fanned out to\nfifty feet width. And where it touched the _Thought_, there was a\nterrific explosion, and inconceivably violent energy lashed out as the\ncosmium instantaneously liberated its energy.\n\nA hundred feet of the nose was torn off the ship, and the enormously\ndense air of Thett rushed in. But that beam had cut through the very\nedge of one of the ray projectors, or better, one of the ray feed\napparatus. And the ray feed released it without control; it released all\nthe energy it could suck in from space about it, as one single beam of\ncosmic energy, somewhat lower than the regular cosmics, and it flashed\nout in a beam as solid matter.\n\nThere was air about the ship, and the air instantly exploded into atoms\nof a different sort, threw off their electrons, and were raised to the\ntemperature at which no atom can exist, and became protons and\nelectrons. But so rapidly was that coil sucking energy from space that\nspace tended to close in about it, and in enormous spurts the energy\nflooded out. It was directed almost straight up, and but one ship was\ncaught in its beam. It was made of relux, but the relux was powdered\nunder the inconceivable blow that countless quintillions of cosmic ray\nphotons struck it. That ray was in fact, a solid mass of cosmium moving\nwith the velocity of light. And it was headed for that satellite of\nThett, which it would reach in a few hours time.\n\nThe _Thought_, due to the spatial strains of the wounded coil, was\nconstantly rushing away to an almost infinite distance, as the ship\napproached that other space toward which the coil tended with its load,\nand rushing back, as the coil, reaching a spatial condition which\nsupplied no energy, fell back. In a hundredth of a second it had reached\nequilibrium, and they were in a weirdly, terribly distorted space. But\nthe triple-ray of the Thessians seemed to sheer off, and miss, no matter\nhow it was directed. And it was painfully weak, for the coil sucked up\nthe energy of whatsoever matter disintegrated in the neighborhood.\n\nThen suddenly the performance was over. And they plunged into artificial\nspace that was black and clean, and not a thing of wavering, struggling\nenergies. Morey, from his control in the _Banderlog_, had succeeded in\ngetting sufficient energy, by using his space distortion coils, to\ndestroy the great projector mechanism. Instantly Arcot, now able to\ncreate the artificial space without the destruction of the coils by the\nstruggling ray-feed coil, had thrown them to comparative safety.\n\nSpace writhed before they could so much as turn from the instruments.\nThe Thessians had located their artificial space, and reached it with an\nattraction ray. They already had been withstanding the drain of the\nenormous fields of the giant planet and the giant sun; the attractive\nray was an added strain. Arcot looked at his instruments, and with a\ngrim smile set a single dial. The space about them became black again.\n\n\"Pulling our energy--merely let 'em pull. They're pulling on an ocean,\nnot a lake this time. I don't think they'll drain those coils very\nquickly.\" He looked at his instruments. \"Good for two and a half hours\nat this rate.\n\n\"Morey, you sure did your job then. I was helpless. The controls\nwouldn't answer, of course, with that titanic thing flopping its wings,\nso to speak. What are we going to do?\"\n\nMorey stood in the doorway, and from his pocket drew a cigarette, handed\nit to Arcot, another to each of the others who smoked, and lit them, and\nhis own. \"Smoke,\" he said, and puffed. \"Smoke and think. From our last\nexperience with a minor tragedy, it helps.\"\n\n\"But--this is no minor tragedy, they have burst open the wall of this\ninvulnerable ship, destroyed one of those enormous coils, and can do it\nagain,\" exclaimed Zezdon Afthen, exceedingly nervous, so nervous that\nthe normal courage of the man was gone. His too-psychic breeding was\nagainst him as a warrior.\n\n\"Afthen,\" replied Stel Felso Theu calmly, \"when our friends have smoked,\nand thought, the _Thought_ will be repaired perfectly, and it will be\nmade invulnerable to that weapon.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Stel Felso Theu,\" smiled Arcot. He was feeling better\nalready. \"But do you know what that weapon is, Morey?\"\n\n\"Got some readings on it with the _Banderlog_'s instruments, and I think\nI do. Twin-ray is right,\" replied Morey.\n\n\"Hm-hm--so I think. It's a super-photon. What they do is to use a field\nsomewhat similar to the field we use in making cosmium, except that in\ntheirs, instead of the photons lying side by side, they slide into one\nanother, compounding. They evidently get three photons to go into one.\nNow, as we know, that size photon doesn't exist for the excellent reason\nthat it can't in this space. Space closes in about it. Therefore they\nhave a projected field to accompany it that tends to open out space--and\nthey are using that, not the attractive ray, on us now. The result is\nthat for a distance not too great, the triple-ray exists in normal\nspace--then goes into another. Now the question is how can we stop it? I\nhave an idea--have you any?\"\n\n\"Yes, but my idea can't exist in this space either,\" grinned Morey.\n\n\"I think it can. If it's what I think, remember it will have a terrific\nelectric field.\"\n\n\"It's what you think, then. Come on.\" Arcot and Morey went to the\ncalculating room, while Wade took over the ship. But one of the\nray-feeds had been destroyed, and they had three more in action, as well\nas their most important weapon, artificial matter. Wade threw on the\ntime field, and started the emergency lead burner working to recharge\nthe coils that the Thessians were constantly draining. Being in their\nown peculiar space, they could not draw energy from the stars, and Arcot\ndidn't want to return to normal space to discharge them, unless\nnecessary.\n\n\"How's the air pressure in the rest of the ship?\" asked Wade.\n\n\"Triple normal,\" replied Morey. \"The Thessian atmosphere leaked in and\nsent it up terrifically, but when we went into our own space, at the\nhalfway point, a lot leaked out. But the ship is full of water now. It\nwas a bit difficult coming up from the _Banderlog_, and I didn't want to\nbreathe the air I wasn't sure of. But let's work.\"\n\nThey worked. For eight hours of the time they were now in they continued\nto work. The supply of lead metal gave out before the end of the fourth\nhour, and the coils were nearing the end of their resistance. It would\nsoon be necessary for Arcot to return to normal space. So they stopped,\ntheir calculations very nearly complete. Throwing all the remaining\nenergy into the coils, they a little more than held the space about\nthem, and moved away from Thett at a speed of about twice that of light.\nFor an hour more Arcot worked, while the ship plowed on. Then they were\nready.\n\nAs Arcot took over the controls, space reeled once more, and they were\nalone, far from Thett. The suns of this space were flashing and glowing\nabout them, and the unlimited energy of a universe was at Arcot's\ncommand. But all the remaining atmosphere in the ship had either gone\ninstantaneously in the vacuum, or solidified as the chill of expansion\nfroze it.\n\nTo the amazement of the extra-terrestrians, Arcot's first move was to\ncreate a titanic plane of artificial matter, and neatly bisect the\n_Thought_ at the middle! He had thrown all of the controls thus\ninterrupted into neutral, and in the little more than half of the ship\nwhich contained the control cabin, was also the artificial matter\ncontrol. It was busy now. With bewildering speed, with the speed of\nthought trained to construct, enormous masses of cosmium were appearing\nbeside them in space as Arcot created them from pure energy. Cosmium,\nrelux and some clear cosmium-like lux metal. Ordinary cosmium was\nreflective, and he wanted something with cosmium's strength, and the\nclearness of lux.\n\nIn seconds, under Arcot's flying thought manipulation, a great tube had\nbeen welded to the original hull, and the already gigantic ship\nlengthened by more than five hundred feet! Immediately great artificial\nmatter tools gripped the broken nose-section, clamped it into place, and\nwelded it with cosmium flowing under the inconceivable pressure till it\nwas again a single great hull.\n\nThen the Thessian fleet found them. The coils were charged now, and they\ncould have escaped, but Arcot had to work. The Thessians were attacked\nwith moleculars, cosmics, and a great twin-ray. Arcot could not use his\nmagnet, for it had been among those things severed from the control. He\nhad two ray feeds, and the artificial matter. There were nearly three\nthousand ships attacking him with a barrage of energy that was\ninconceivably great, but the cosmium walls merely turned it aside. It\ntook Arcot less than ten seconds to wipe out that fleet of ships! He\ncreated a wall of artificial matter at twenty feet from the ship--and\nanother at twenty thousand miles. It was thin, yet it was utterly\nimpenetrable. He swept the two walls together, and forced them against\neach other until his instruments told him only free energy remained\nbetween them. Then he released the outer wall, and a terrific flood of\nenergy swept out.\n\n\"I don't think we'll be attacked again,\" said Morey softly. They were\nnot. Thett had only one other fleet, and had no intention of losing the\npowers of their generators at this time when they so badly needed them.\nThe strange ship had retired for repairs--very well, they could attack\nagain--and maybe--\n\nArcot was busy. In the great empty space that had been left, he\ninstalled a second collector coil as gigantic as the main artificial\nmatter generator. Then he repaired the broken ray feed, and it, and the\ncompanion coil which, with it, had been in the severed nose section,\nwere now in the same relative position to the new collector coil that\nthey had had with relation to the artificial matter coil. Next Arcot\nbuilt two more ray feeds. Now in the gigantic central power room there\nloomed two tremendous power collectors, and six smaller ray feed\ncollectors.\n\nHis next work was to reconnect the severed connectors and controls. Then\nhe began work on the really new apparatus. Nothing he had constructed so\nfar was more than a duplicate of existing apparatus, and he had been\nable to do it almost instantly, from memory. Now he must vision\nsomething new to his experience, and something that was forced to exist\nin part in this space, and partly in another. He tried four times before\nthe apparatus had been completed correctly, and the work occupied ten\nhours. But at last it was done. The _Thought_ was ready now for the\nbattle.\n\n\"Got it right at last?\" asked Wade. \"I hope so.\"\n\n\"It's right--tried it a little. I don't think you noticed it. I'm going\ndown now to give them a nice little dose,\" said Arcot grimly. His ship\nwas repaired--but they had caused him plenty of trouble.\n\n\"How long have we been out here, their time?\" asked Wade.\n\n\"About an hour and a half.\" The _Thought_ had been on the time field at\nall times save when the Thessian fleet attacked.\n\n\"I think, Earthman, that you are tired, and should rest, lest you make a\ntired thought and do great harm,\" suggested Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"I want to finish it!\" replied Arcot, sharply. He was tired.\n\nIn seconds the _Thought_ was once more over that fortified station in\nthe mountains--and the triple-ray reached out--and suddenly, about the\nship, was a wall of absolute, utter blackness. The triple-ray touched\nit, and exploded into coruscating, blinding energy. It could not\npenetrate it. More energy lashed at the wall of blackness as the\noperators within the sphere-fort turned in the energy of all the\ngenerators under their control. The ground about the fort was a great\nlake of dazzling lava as far as the eye could see, for the triple-ray\nwas releasing its energy, and the wall of black was releasing an equal,\nand opposing energy!\n\n\"Stopped!\" cried Arcot happily. \"Now here is where we give them\nsomething to think about. The magnet and the heat!\"\n\nHe turned the two enormous forces simultaneously on the point where he\nknew the fort was, though it was invisible behind the wall of black that\nprotected him. From his side, the energy of the spot where all the\nsystem of Thett was throwing its forces, was invisible.\n\nThen he released them. Instantly there was a terrific gout of light on\nthat wall of blackness. The ship trembled, and space turned gray about\nthem. The black wall dissolved into grayness in one spot, as a flood of\nenergy beyond comprehension exploded from it. The enormously strong\ncosmium wall dented as the pressure of the escaping radiation struck it,\nand turned X-ray hot under the minute percentage it absorbed. The\ntriple-ray bent away, and faded to black as the cosmic force playing\nabout it, actually twisted space beyond all power of its mechanism to\novercome. Then, in the tiniest fraction of a second it was over, and\nagain there was blackness and only the brilliant, blinding blue of the\ncosmium wall testified to its enormous temperature, cooling now far more\nslowly through green to red.\n\n\"Lord--you're right, Zezdon Afthen. I'm going to sleep,\" called Arcot.\nAnd the ship was suddenly far, far away from Thett. Morey took over, and\nArcot slept. First Morey straightened the uninjured wall and ironed out\nthe dents.\n\n\"What, Morey, is the wall of Blackness?\" asked Stel Felso Theu.\n\n\"It's solid matter. A thing that you never saw before. That wall of\nmatter is made of a double layer of protons lying one against the other.\nIt absorbs absolutely every and all radiation, and because it is solid\nmatter, not tiny sprinklings of matter in empty space, as is the matter\nof even the densest star, it stops the triple-ray. That matter is\nnothing but protons; there are no electrons there, and the positive\nelectrical field is inconceivably great, but it is artificial matter,\nand that electrical field exerts its strain not in pulling and\nelectrifying other bodies, but in holding space open, in keeping it from\nclosing in about that concentrated matter, just as it does about a\nsingle proton, except that here the entire field energy is so absorbed.\n\n\"Arcot was tired, and forgot. He turned his magnet and his heat against\nit. The heat fought the solid matter with the same energy that created\nit, and with an energy that had resources as great. The magnet curved\nspace about it, and about us. The result was the terrific energy release\nyou saw, and the hole in the wall. All Thett couldn't make any\nimpression on it. One of the rays blasted a hole in it,\" said Morey with\na laugh. For he, too, loved this mighty thing, the almost living ideas\nof his friend's brain.\n\n\"But it is as bad as the space defense. It works both ways. We can't\nsend through it but neither can they. Any thing we use that attacks\nthem, attacks it, and so destroys it--and it fights.\"\n\n\"We're worse off than ever!\" said Morey gloomily.\n\n\"My friend, you, too, are tired. Sleep, sleep soundly, sleep till I\ncall--sleep!\" And Morey slept under Zezdon Afthen's will, till Torlos\ncarried him gently to his room. Then Afthen let the sleep relax to a\nnatural one. Wade decided he might as well follow under his own power,\nfor now he knew he was tired, and could not overcome Zezdon Afthen, who\nwas not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn Thett, the fort was undestroyed, and now floating on its power units\nin a sea of blazing lava. Within, men were working quickly to install a\nsecond set of the new tubes in the molecular motion ray screen, and\nother men were transmitting the orders of the Sthanto who had come here\nas the place of actually greatest safety.\n\n\"Order all battleships to the nearest power-feed station, and command\nthat all power available be transmitted to the station attacked. I\nbelieve it will be this one. There is no limit on the power transmission\nlines, and we need all possible power,\" he commanded his son, now in\ncharge of all land and spatial forces.\n\n\"And Ranstud, what happened to that molecular ray screen?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I cannot understand such power.\n\n\"But what most worries me is his wall of darkness,\" said Ranstud\nseriously.\n\n\"But he was forced to retire for all his wall of darkness, as you saw.\n\n\"He can maintain it but a short time, and it was full of holes when he\nfled.\"\n\n\"Old Sthanto is much too confident, I believe,\" said an assistant\nworking at one of the great boards in the enemy's fort, to one of his\nfriends. \"And I think he has lost his science-knowledge. Any power-man\ncould tell what happened. They tried to use their own big rays against\nus, and their screen stopped them from going out, just as it stopped\nours on the way in. Ours had been working at it for seconds, and hadn't\nbothered them. Then for a bare instant their ray touched it--and they\nretired. That shield of blackness is absolutely new.\"\n\n\"They have many men on that ship of theirs,\" replied his friend, helping\nto lift the three hundred ton load of a vacuum tube into place, \"for it\nis evident that they built new apparatus, and it is evident their ship\nwas increased in size to contain it. Also the nose was repaired. They\nprobably worked under a time field, for they accomplished an impossible\namount of work in the period they were gone.\"\n\nRanstud had come up behind them, and overheard the later part of this\nconversation. \"And what,\" he asked suddenly, \"did your meters tell you\nwhen our ray opened his ship?\"\n\n\"Councilor of Science-wisdom, they told us that our power diminished,\nand our generators gave off but little power when his power was\nexceedingly little, we still had much.\"\n\n\"Have you heard the myth of the source of his power, in the story that\nhe gets it from all the stars of the Island?\"\n\n\"We have, Great Councilor. And I for one believe it, for he sucked the\npower from our generators. So might he suck the power from the\ninconceivably greater generators of the Suns. I believe that we should\ntreat with them, for if they be like the peace-loving fools of Venone,\nwe might win a respite in which to learn their secret.\"\n\nRanstud walked away slowly. He agreed, in his heart, but he loved life\ntoo well to tell the Sthanto what to do, and he had no intention of\nsacrificing himself for the possible good of the race.\n\nSo they prepared for another attack of the _Thought_, and waited.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\nMAN, CREATOR AND DESTROYER\n\n\n\"What we must find,\" said Arcot, between contented puffs, for he had\nslept well, and his breakfast had been good, \"is some weapon which will\nattack them, but won't attack us. The question is, what is it? And I\nthink, I think--I know.\" His eyes were dreamy, his thoughts so\ncryptically abbreviated that not even Morey could follow them.\n\n\"Fine--what is it?\" asked Morey after vainly striving to deduce some\nsense from the formulas that were chasing through Arcot's thoughts. Here\nand there he recognized them: Einstein's energy formula, Planck's\nquantum formulas, Nitsu Thansi's electron interference formulas,\nStebkowfski's proton interference, Williamson's electric field, and his\nown formulas appeared, and others so abbreviated he could not recognize\nthem.\n\n\"Do you remember what Dad said about the way the Thessians made the\ngiant forts out in space--hauled matter from the moon and transformed it\nto lux and relux. Remember, I said then I thought it might be a ray--but\nfound it wasn't what I thought? I want to to use the ray I was thinking\nof. The only question in my mind is--what is going to happen to us when\nI use it?\"\n\n\"What's the ray?\"\n\n\"Why is it, Morey, that an electron falls through the different quantum\nenergy levels, falls successively lower and lower till it reaches its\n'lowest energy level,' and can radiate no more. Why can't it fill\nanother step, and reach the proton? Why has it no more quanta to\nrelease? We know that electrons tend to fall always to lower energy\nlevel orbits. Why do they stop?\"\n\n\"And,\" said Morey, his own eyes dreamily bright now, \"what would happen\nif it did? If it fell all the way?\"\n\n\"I cannot follow your thoughts, Earthmen, beyond a glimpse of an\nexplosion. And it seems it is Thett that is exploding, and that Thett is\nexploding itself. Can you explain?\" asked Stel Felso Theu.\n\n\"Perhaps--you know that electrons in their planetary orbits, so called,\ntend to fall away to orbits of lower energy, till they reach the lowest\nenergy orbit, and remain fixed till more energy comes and is absorbed,\ndriving them out again. Now we want to know why they don't fall lower,\nfall all the way? As a matter of fact, thanks to some work I did last\nyear with disintegrating lead, we do know. And thanks to the absolute\nstability of artificial matter, we can handle such a condition.\n\n\"The thing we are interested in is this: Artificial matter has no\ntendency to radiate, its electrons have no tendency to fall into the\nproton, for the matter is created, and remains as it was created. But\nnatural matter does have a tendency to let the electron fall into the\nproton. A force, the 'lowest energy wall,' over which no electron can\njump, caused by the enormous space distorting of the proton's mass and\nelectrical attraction, prevents it. What we want to do is to remove that\nforce, iron it out. Requires inconceivable power to do so in a mass the\nsize of Thett-but then--!\n\n\"And here's what will happen: Our wall of protonic material won't be\naffected by it in the least, because it has no tendency to collapse, as\nhas normal matter, but Thett, beyond the wall, _has_ that tendency, and\nthe ray will release the energy of every planetary electron on Thett,\nand every planetary electron will take with it the energy of one proton.\nAnd it will take about one one-hundred-millionth of a second. Thett will\ndisappear in one instantaneous flash of radiation, radiation in the high\ncosmics!\n\n\"Here's the trouble: Thett represents a mass as great as our sun. And\nour sun can throw off energy at the present rate of one sol for a period\nof some ten million million years, three and a half million tons of\nmatter a second for ten million years. If all of that went up in _one\none-hundred-millionth of a second_, how many sols?\" asked Morey.\n\n\"Too many, is all I can say. Even this ship couldn't maintain its walls\nof energy against that!\" declared Stel Felso Theu, awed by the thought.\n\n\"But that same power would be backing this ship, and helping it to\nsupport its wall. We would operate from--half a million miles.\"\n\n\"We will. If we are destroyed--so is Thett, and all the worlds of Thett.\nLet that flood of energy get loose, and everything within a dozen light\nyears will be destroyed. We will have to warn the Venonians, that their\npeople on nearby worlds may escape in the time before the energy reaches\nthem,\" said Arcot slowly.\n\nThe _Thought_ started toward one of the nearer suns, and as it went,\nArcot and Morey were busy with the calculators. They finished their\nwork, and started back from that world, having given their message of\nwarning, with the artificial matter constructors. When they reached\nThett, less than a quarter of an hour of Thessian time had passed. But,\nbefore they reached Thett, Arcot's viewplates were blinded for an\ninstant as a terrific flood of energy struck the artificial matter\nprotectors, and caused them to flame into defense. Thett's satellite was\nsending its message of instantaneous destruction. That terrific ray had\nreached it, touched it, and left it a shattered, glowing ball of\nhydrogen.\n\n\"There won't be even that left when we get through with Thett!\" said\nArcot grimly. The apparatus was finished, and once more they were over\nthe now fiery-red lava sea that had been mountains. The fort was still\nin action. Arcot had cut a sheet of sheer energy now, and as the\ntriple-ray struck it, he knew what would happen. It did. The triple-ray\nshunted off at an angle of forty-five degrees in the energy field, and\nspread instantly to a diffused beam of blackness. Arcot's molecular\nreached out. The lava was instantly black, and mountains of ice were\nforming over the struggling defenses of the fort. The molecular screen\nwas working.\n\n\"I'd like to know how they make tubes that'll stand that, Morey,\" said\nArcot, pointing to an instrument that read .01 millisols. \"They have\ntubes now, that would have wiped us out in minutes, seconds before\nthis.\"\n\nThe triple-ray snapped off. They were realigning it to hit the ship now,\ncorrecting for the shield. Arcot threw out his protonic shield, and\nretreated to half a million miles, as he had said.\n\n\"Here goes.\" But before even his thoughts could send Theft to radiation,\nthe entire side of the planet blazed suddenly incandescent. Thett was\nlearning what had happened when their ray had wounded the _Thought_.\n\nAnd then, in the barest instant of time, there was no Thett. There was\nan instant of intolerable radiation, then momentary blackness, and then\nthe stars were shining where Thett had been. Thett was utterly gone.\n\nBut Arcot did not see this. About him there was a tremendous roar,\ntitanic generator-converters that had not so much as hummed under the\nimpact of Thett's greatest weapons, whined and shuddered now. The two\nenormous generators, the blackness of the protonic shield, and the great\nartificial matter generator, throwing an inner shield impervious to the\ncosmics Thett gave off as it vanished, both were whining. And the six\nsmaller machines, which Arcot had succeeded in interconnecting with the\nprotonic generator, were whining too. Space was weirdly distorted,\nglowing gray about them, the great generators struggling to maintain the\nvarious walls of protecting power against the surge of energy as Thett,\na world of matter, disintegrated.\n\nBut the very energy that fought to destroy those walls was absorbed in\ndefending it, and by that much the attacking energy was lessened. Still,\nit seemed hours, days that the battle of forces continued.\n\nThen it was over, and the skies were clear once more as Arcot lowered\nthe protonic screen silently. The white sky of Thett was gone, and only\nthe black starriness of space remained.\n\n\"_It's gone!_\" gasped Torlos. He had been expecting it--still, the\ndisappearance of a world--\n\n\"We will have to do no more. No ships had time to escape, and the risk\nwe run is too great,\" said Morey slowly. \"The escaping energy from that\nworld will destroy the others of this system as completely, and it will\nprobably cause the sun itself to blow up--perhaps to form new planets,\nand so the process repeats itself. But Venone knows better now, and\ntheir criminals will not populate more worlds.\n\n\"And we can go--home. To our little dust specks.\"\n\n\"But they're wonderfully welcome dust specks, and utterly important to\nus, Earthman,\" reminded Zezdon Afthen.\n\n\"Let us go then,\" said Arcot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dusk, and the rose tints of the recently-set sun still hung on\nthe clouds that floated like white bits of cotton in the darkening blue\nsky. The dark waters of the little lake, and the shadowy tree-clad hills\nseemed very beautiful. And there was a little group of buildings down\nthere, and a broad cleared field. On the field rested a shining, slim\nshape, seventy-five feet long, ten feet in diameter.\n\nBut all, the lake, the mountains even, were dwarfed by the silent,\nglistening ruby of a gigantic machine that settled very, very slowly,\nand very, very gently downward. It touched the rippled surface of the\nlake with scarcely a splash, then hung, a quarter submerged in that\nlake.\n\nLights were showing in the few windows the huge bulk had, and lights\nshowed now in the buildings on the shore. Through an open door light was\nstreaming, casting silhouettes of two men. And now a tiny door opened in\nthe enormous bulk that occupied the lake, and from it came five figures,\nthat floated up, and away, and toward the cottage.\n\n\"Hello, Son. You have been gone long,\" said Arcot, senior, gravely, as\nhis son landed lightly before him.\n\n\"I thought so. Earth has moved in her orbit. More than six months?\"\n\nHis father smiled a bit wryly. \"Yes. Two years and three months. You got\ncaught in another time field and thrown the other way this time?\"\n\n\"Time and force. Do you know the story yet?\"\n\n\"Part of it--Venone sent a ship to us within a month of the time you\nleft, and said that all Thett's system had disappeared save for one\ntremendous gas cloud--mostly hydrogen. Their ships were met by such a\nblast of cosmic rays as they came toward Thett that the radiation\npressure made it almost impossible to advance. There were two distinct\nwaves. One was rather slighter, and was more in the gamma range, so they\nsuspected that two bodies had been directly destroyed; one small one,\nand one large one were reduced completely to cosmics. Your warning to\nSentfenn was taken seriously, and they have vacated all planets near. It\nwas the force field created when you destroyed Thett that threw you\nforward? Where are the others?\"\n\n\"Zezdon Afthen and Zezdon Inthel we took home, and dropped in their\npower suits, without landing. Stel Felso Theu as well. We will visit\nthem later.\"\n\n\"Have you eaten? Then let us eat, and after supper we'll tell you what\nlittle there is to tell.\"\n\n\"But Arcot,\" said Morey slowly, \"I understand that Dad will be here\nsoon, so let us wait. And I have something of which I have not spoken to\nyou as yet. Worked it out and made it on the back trip. Installed in the\n_Thought_ with the _Banderlog_'s controls. It is--well, will you\nlook?--Fuller! Come and see the new toy you designers are going to have\nto work on!\"\n\nThey had all been depressed by the thought of their long absence, by the\nscenes of destruction they had witnessed so recently. They were\nbeginning to feel better.\n\n\"Watch.\" Morey's thoughts concentrated. The _Thought_ outside had been\nleft on locked controls, but the apparatus Morey had installed responded\nto his thoughts from this distance.\n\nBefore them in the room appeared a cube that was obviously copper. It\nstayed there but a moment, beaming brightly, then there was a snapping\nof energies about them--and it dropped to the floor and rang with the\nimpact!\n\n\"It was not created from the air,\" said Morey simply.\n\n\"And now,\" said Arcot, looking at it, \"Man can do what never before was\npossible. From the nothingness of Space he can make anything.\n\n\"Man alone in this space is Creator and Destroyer.\n\n\"It is a high place.\n\n\"May he henceforth live up to it.\"\n\nAnd he looked out toward the mighty starlit hull that had destroyed a\nsolar system--and could create another.\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nBooks by JOHN W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
