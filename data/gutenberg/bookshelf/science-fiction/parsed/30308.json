The lounge itself was cozily small; the _Persephone_\nhad not been designed as a passenger vessel, and the two passengers\nshe was carrying at the time had been taken on as an accommodation\nrather than as a money-making proposition. On the other hand, the\n_Persephone_ and other ships like her were the only method of getting\nto where Jayjay Kelvin wanted to go; there were no regular passenger\nruns to Pluto. It's hardly the vacation spot of the Solar System.\n\nOn the other side of the table, Jeffry Hull was working industriously\nwith pencil and paper. Jayjay kept his nose buried in his book--not\nbecause he was deliberately slighting Hull, but because he was\ngenuinely interested in the book.\n\n_\"Now wait,\" said Masterson, looking thoughtfully at the footprints on\nthe floor of the cabin where Jed Hooker had died. \"Jest take another\nlook at these prints, Charlie. Silver Bill Greer couldn't have got\nmuch more than his big toe into boots that small! Somethin' tells me\nthe Pecos Kid has....\"_\n\n\"... Traveled nearly two billion miles since then,\" said Hull.\n\nJayjay lifted his head from his book. \"What?\" He blinked. \"I'm sorry;\nI wasn't listening. What did you say?\"\n\nThe younger man was still grinning triumphantly. \"I said: We are\napproaching turnover, and, according to my figures, nine days of\nacceleration at one standard gee will give us a velocity of seventeen\nmillion, five hundred and fifty miles per hour, and we have covered a\ndistance of nearly two billion miles.\" Then he added: \"That is, if I\nremembered my formulas correctly.\"\n\nJayjay Kelvin looked thoughtfully at the ceiling while he ran through\nthe figures in his head. \"Something like that. It's the right order of\nmagnitude, anyway.\"\n\nHull looked a little miffed. \"What answer did you get?\"\n\n\"A little less than eight times ten to the third kilometers per\nsecond. I was just figuring roughly.\"\n\nHull scribbled hastily, then smiled again. \"Eighteen million miles an\nhour, that would be. My memory's better than I thought at first. I'm\nglad I didn't have to figure the time; doing square roots is a process\nI've forgotten.\"\n\nThat was understandable, Jayjay thought. Hull was working for his\ndoctorate in sociology, and there certainly wasn't much necessity for\na sociologist to remember his freshman physics, much less his\nhigh-school math.\n\nStill, it was somewhat of a relief to find that Hull was interested in\nsomething besides the \"sociological reactions of Man in space\". The\nboy had spent six months in the mining cities in the Asteroid Belt,\nand another six investigating the Jovian chemical synthesis planes and\ntheir attendant cities. Now he was heading out to spend a few more\nmonths observing the \"sociological organization Gestalt\" of the men\nand women who worked at the toughest job in the System--taking the\nheavy metals from the particularly dense sphere of Pluto.\n\nHull began scribbling on his paper again, evidently lost in the joys\nof elementary physics, so Jayjay Kelvin went back to his book.\n\nHe had just read three words when Hull said: \"Mr. Kelvin, do you mind\nif I ask a question?\"\n\nJayjay looked up from his book and saw that Jeffry Hull had reverted\nto his role of the earnest young sociologist. Ah, well. \"As I've told\nyou before, Mr. Hull, questions do not offend me, but I can't\nguarantee that the answers won't offend you.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course,\" Hull said in his best investigatory manner. \"I\nappreciate that. It's just that ... well, I have trained myself to\nnotice small things. The little details that are sometimes so\nimportant in sociological investigations. Not, you understand, as an\nattempt to pry into the private life of the individual, but to round\nout the overall picture.\"\n\nJayjay nodded politely. To his quixotic and pixie-like mind, the term\n_overall picture_ conjured up the vision of a large and carefully\ndetailed painting of a pair of dirty overalls, but he kept the smile\noff his face and merely said: \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Well, I've noticed that you're quite an avid reader. That isn't\nunusual in a successful businessman, of course; one doesn't become a\nsuccessful businessman unless one has a thirst for knowledge.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m,\" said Jayjay.\n\n\"But,\" Hull continued earnestly, \"I noticed that you've read most of\nthe ... uh ... historical romances in the library....\"\n\n\"You mean Westerns,\" Jayjay corrected quietly.\n\n\"Uh ... yes. But you don't seem to be interested in the modern\nadventure fiction. May I ask why?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Jayjay found himself becoming irrationally irritated with\nHull. He knew that the young sociologist had nothing to do with his\nown irritation, so he kept the remarks as impersonal as possible. \"In\nthe first place, you, as a sociologist, should know what market most\nfiction is written for.\"\n\n\"Why ... uh ... for people who want to relax and--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jayjay cut in. \"But what kind? The boys on Pluto? The asteroid\nslicers? No. There are four billion people on Earth and less than five\nmillion in space. The market is Earth.\n\n\"Also, most writers have never been any farther off the surface of\nEarth than the few miles up that an intercontinental cruiser takes\nthem.\n\n\"And yet, the modern 'adventure' novel invariably takes place in\nspace.\n\n\"I can read Westerns because I neither know nor care what the Old\nAmerican West was _really_ like. I can sit back and sink into the\nnever-never land that the Western tells about and enjoy myself because\nI am not forced to compare it with reality.\n\n\"But a 'space novel' written by an Earthside hugger is almost as much\na never-never land, and I have to keep comparing it with what is\nactually going on around me. And it irritates me.\"\n\n\"But, aren't some of them pretty well researched?\" Hull asked.\n\n\"Obviously, you haven't read many of them,\" Jayjay said. \"Sure, some\nof them are well researched. Say one half of one per cent, to be\nliberal. The rest don't know what they're talking about!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"For instance,\" Jayjay continued heatedly, \"you take a look at every\nblasted one of them that has anything to do with a spacecraft having\ntrouble. They have to have an accident in space in order to disable\nthe spaceship so that the hairy-chested hero can show what a great guy\nhe is. So what does the writer do? He has the ship hit by a meteor! A\nmeteor!\"\n\nHull thought that over for a second. \"Well,\" he said tentatively, \"a\nship _could_ get hit by a meteor, couldn't it?\"\n\nJayjay closed his eyes in exasperation. \"Of course it could! And an\nair-ship can run into a ruby-throated hummingbird, too. But how often\ndoes it happen?\n\n\"Look: We're hitting it up at about one-fortieth of the velocity of\nlight right now. What do you think would happen if we got hit by a\nmeteor? We'd be gone before we knew what had happened.\n\n\"Why doesn't it happen? Because we can spot any meteor big enough to\nhurt us long before it contacts us, and we can dodge it or blast it\nout of the way, depending on the size.\n\n\"You've seen the outer hull of this ship. It's an inch thick shell of\nplastic, supported a hundred feet away from the steel hull by long\nbooms. Anything small enough to get by the detectors will be small\nenough to burn itself out on that hull before it reaches the ship.\nThe--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJayjay Kelvin was not ordinarily a man to make long speeches,\nespecially when he knew he was telling someone something that they\nalready knew. But this time, he was beating one of his favorite drums,\nand he went on with his tirade in a fine flush of fury.\n\nAlas ... poor Jayjay.\n\nActually, Jayjay Kelvin can't be blamed for his attitude. All he was\nsaying was that it was highly improbable that a spaceship would be hit\nby a meteor. In one way, he was perfectly right, and, in another, he\nwas dead wrong.\n\nHow small must a piece of matter be before it is no longer a meteor?\n\nFortunately, the big hunks rarely travel at more than about two times\nten to the sixth centimeters per second, relative to Sol, in the Solar\nSystem. But there are little meteors--_very_ tiny ones--that come in,\nhell-bent-for-leather, at a shade less than the velocity of light.\nThey're called cosmic rays, but they're not radiation in the strict\nsense of the word. A stripped hydrogen atom, weighing on the order of\nthree point three times ten to the minus twenty-second grams, rest\nmass, can come galumping along at a velocity so close to that of light\nthat the kinetic energy is something colossal for so small a particle.\nProtons with a kinetic energy of ten to the nineteenth electron volts,\nwhile statistically rare, are not unusual.\n\nNow, ten million million million electron volts may be a wee bit\nmeaningless to the average man, so let's look at it from another\nangle.\n\nConsider. According to the well-known formula E = mc^2, a single gram\nof matter, if converted _completely_ into energy, would yield some\nnine hundred million million million ergs of energy. An atomic bomb\nyields only a fraction of that energy, since only a small percentage\nof the mass is converted into energy.\n\nIf _all_ of the mass of an atomic bomb were converted into energy, the\ntest in Alamogordo, New Mexico, 'way back in 1945, would probably have\nbeen the last such test on Earth; there wouldn't have been anyone\naround to make a second test.\n\nSo what does this have to do with cosmic ray particle? Well, if that\natomic bomb had been moving at the velocity with which our\nten-to-the-nineteenth-electron-volts proton is moving, it could have\nbeen made of sand instead of U^235. It would have produced ten\nthousand million times as much energy as the total disintegration of\nthe rest mass would have produced!\n\nKinetic energy, my children, has a great deal more potential than\natomic energy.\n\nBut we digress.\n\nWhat has all this to do with Jayjay Kelvin?\n\nIf Jayjay had been a detective story addict instead of a Western story\naddict, he would have heard of the HIBK or \"Had I But Known\" school of\ndetective writing. You know: \"Had I But Known that, at that moment, in\nthe dismal depths of a secret underground meeting place, the evil\nChuman-Fu was plotting....\"\n\nIf Jayjay Kelvin had known what was going on a few million miles away\nfrom the Pluto-bound _Persephone_, he would have kept his mouth shut.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cargo-ship _Mordred_ was carrying a cargo of heavy metals sunward.\nIn her hold were tightly-packed ingots of osmium-iridium-platinum\nalloy, gold-copper-silver-mercury alloy, and small percentages of\nother of the heavy metals. The cargo was to be taken to the Asteroid\nBelt for purification and then shipped Earthward for final\ndisposition. The fact that silver had replaced copper for electrical\npurposes on Earth was due to the heavy-metals industry on Pluto.\nBecause of Pluto, the American silver bloc had been broken at last.\n\nThe _Mordred_ was approaching turnover.\n\nNow, with a gravito-inertial drive, there is really no need to turn a\nship over end-for-end as she approaches the mid-point of her\ntrajectory. Since there is no rocket jet to worry about, all that is\nreally necessary is to put the engine in reverse. In fact, the patrol\nships of the Interplanetary Police do just that.\n\nBut the IP has been trained to take up to five standard gees in an\nend-to-end flip, and the ships are built to take the stress in both\ndirections. An ordinary cargo ship finds it a lot easier to simply\nflip the ship over; that way, the stresses remain the same, and the\nceiling-floor relationship is constant.\n\nThe _Mordred_ had been having a little trouble with her Number Three\ndrive engine, so the drive was cut off at turnover, while the engineer\nreplaced a worn bearing. At the same time, the maintenance officer\ndecided he'd take a look at the meteor-bumper--the plastic outer hull.\nSince the ship was in free fall, all he had to do was pull himself\nalong one of the beams that supported the meteor-bumper away from the\nmain hull. The end of one of the beams had cracked a part of the\nbumper hull--fatigue from stress, nothing more, but the hull might as\nwell be patched while the drive was off.\n\nIt was a one-man job; the plastic was dense, but under null-gee\nconditions it was easy to maneuver. The maintenance officer repaired\nthe slight crack easily, wiped the sticky pre-polymer from the fingers\nof his spacesuit gloves, and tossed the gooey rag off into space. Then\nhe pushed himself back across the vacuum that separated the outer hull\nfrom the inner, entered the air lock, and reported that the job was\nfinished. Five minutes later, the _Mordred_ began decelerating toward\nthe distant Asteroid Belt.\n\nForget the _Mordred_. The ship is no longer important. Keep your eyes\non that rag. It's a flimsy thing, composed of absorbent plastic and\ngooed up with a little unpolymerized resin, weighing about fifty\ngrams. It is apparently floating harmlessly in space, just beyond the\norbit of Uranus, looking as innocuous as a rag can look. But it is\nmoving sunward at eight hundred million centimeters per second.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Persephone_ was approaching turnover. The ship's engineer\nreported that the engines were humming along smoothly, so there was no\nneed to shut them off; the ship would simply flip over as she ran,\nmaking her path a slightly skewed, elongated S-curve--a sort of\norbital hiccup.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nExcept that she never quite made it through the hiccup. The ship was\nalmost perpendicular to her line of flight when she was sideswiped.\n\nHer meteor detectors hadn't failed; they were still functioning\nperfectly. But meteor detectors are built to look for solid chunks of\nmetal and rock--not thin, porous bits of cloth.\n\nThe rag had traveled a good many millions of miles since it had been\ncast overboard; it was moving sunward with almost the same velocity\nwith which the _Persephone_ was moving Plutowards. The combined\nvelocities were such that, if it had hit the _Persephone_ dead on, it\nwould have delivered close to seventeen thousand kilowatt-hours of\nenergy in one grand burst of incandescence.\n\nFortunately, the tip of the rag merely gave the ship a slap on the\ntail as it passed. The plastic meteor-bumper wasn't built to take that\nsort of thing. The plastic became an expanding cloud of furiously\nincandescent gas in a small fraction of a second, but the velocity of\nthat bit of rag was so great that the gas acted as a solid block of\nsuperheated fury as it leaped across the hundred feet of vacuum which\nseparated the bumper hull from the inner hull.\n\nA rocket-driven missile carrying a shaped-charge warhead weighing\nseveral hundred pounds might have done almost as much damage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJayjay Kelvin moved his arms to pick himself up off the floor and\nfound that there was no necessity for doing so. He was floating in the\nair of the lounge, and, strictly speaking, there was no floor anyway.\nHe opened his eyes and saw that that which had been the floor was now\njust another wall, except that it had chairs bolted to it. It rose on\nhis left, reached the zenith, and set on his right, to be replaced by\nanother wall, and then by what had been the ceiling. The second time\nthe floor came round, Jayjay began to wonder whether he was spinning\naround his longitudinal axis or whether the ship was actually rotating\nabout him. He closed his eyes again.\n\nHe didn't feel more than a little dizzy, but he couldn't be sure\nwhether the dizziness was caused by his spinning or the blow on his\nhead. He opened his eyes again and grabbed at the book that was\norbiting nearby, then hurled it as hard as he could toward the\nsometime ceiling. \"The Pride of the Pecos\" zoomed rapidly in one\ndirection while Jayjay moved sedately in the other.\n\nThe ship was spinning slightly, all right. When he finally grabbed a\nchair, he found that there was enough spin to give him a weight of an\nounce or two. He sat down as best he could and took a good look\naround.\n\nAside from \"The Pride of the Pecos\" and a couple of other books, the\nair was remarkably free from clutter. There hadn't been much loose\nstuff laying around. A pencil, a few sheets of paper--nothing more.\n\nThere was one object missing. Jayjay looked around more carefully, and\nthis time he saw a hand protruding from the space \"beneath\" the low\ntable. He bent down for a better look and saw that Jeffry Hull was\nunconscious. Blood from his nose was spreading slowly over his face,\nand one eye looked rather battered. Jayjay grasped the protruding\nwrist and felt for a pulse. It was pumping nicely. He decided that\nHull was in no immediate danger; very few people die of a bloody nose.\n\nThe lighting in the lounge was none too good; the low-power emergency\nsystem had come on automatically when the power from the ship's\nengines had died. Jayjay wondered just what had happened. There had\nbeen a hell of an explosion; that was all he knew.\n\nHe wondered if anyone else aboard was alive and conscious, and decided\nhe might as well find out. He took a long dive toward the central\nstairwell that ran the length of the ship's long axis and looked down.\nThe emergency door to the cargo hold was closed. No air, most likely.\nThe way up looked clear, so he scrambled up the spiral stairway.\n\nA few feet farther up, he found that he had passed the center of the\nship's rotation. The _Persephone_ was evidently toppling end-over-end,\nand the center of rotation was in the lounge itself. The heavy cargo in\nthe hold was balancing the lighter, but longer, part of the ship above the\nlounge. He began climbing down the stairwell toward the navigation and\ncontrol sections.\n\nSomewhere down there, somebody was cursing fluently in Arabic.\n\n\"Illegitimate offspring of a mangy she-camel! Eater of dogs! Wallower\nin carrion!\" And then, with hardly a break: \"Allah, All-Merciful,\nAll-Compassionate! Have mercy on Thy servant! I swear by the beard of\nThy holy Prophet that I will attend more closely to my duties to Thee\nif Thou wilt get me loose from this ill-begotten monstrosity! Help me\nor I perish!\" The last words were a wail.\n\n\"I'm coming!\" boomed Jayjay in the same tongue. \"Save thy strength!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence from the control room as Jayjay clambered on down\nthe stairwell. Fortunately, the steps had been built so that it was\npossible to use them from either side, no matter which way the gravity\npull happened to be. By the time he reached the control room, he\nweighed a good fifteen pounds.\n\nCaptain Atef al-Amin was staring up at the stairs as Jayjay came down.\nHe was jammed tightly into a space between two of the big control\ncabinets, hanging head downward and looking more disheveled than\nJayjay had ever seen the usually immaculately-uniformed captain.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Captain Al-Amin, in English, \"it's you. For a moment I\nthought--\" Then he waved his free hand. \"Never mind. Can you get me\nout of here?\"\n\nWhat had been the floor of the control room was now the ceiling. The\ntwo steel cabinets which housed parts of the computer unit now\nappeared to be bolted to the ceiling. They were only about five feet\nhigh, and the space between them was far too narrow for a man to have\ngot in there by himself--especially a man of the captain's build. None\nthe less, he was in there--jammed in up to his waist. Only his upper\ntorso and one arm was free. The other arm was jammed in against the\nwall.\n\nJayjay took the leap from the stairs and grabbed on to the chair that\nhung from the ceiling nearby. When you only weigh fifteen pounds, you\ncan make Tarzan look like an amateur.\n\n\"You hurt?\" he asked.\n\n\"It isn't comfortable, sure as hell,\" said Al-Amin. \"I think my arm's\nbroken. Think you can get me loose?\"\n\n\"I can try. Give me your hand.\" Jayjay took the captain's free hand\nand gave it a tug. Then he released the chair he was holding, braced\nboth feet against the panels of the computer housings, and gave a good\npull. The captain didn't budge, but he winced a little.\n\n\"That hurt?\"\n\n\"Just my arm. The pressure has cut off my blood circulation; my legs\nare numb, and I can't tell if they hurt or not.\"\n\nJayjay grabbed the chair again and surveyed the situation. \"Where's\nyour First Officer?\"\n\n\"Breckner? Down in the engine room.\"\n\nJayjay didn't comment on that. If the hold was airless, it was likely\nthat the engine room was, too, and there was no need to worry Al-Amin\nany more than necessary just now.\n\n\"Can you use a cutting torch?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't think it'll be necessary,\" Jayjay said. \"Hold on a\nminute.\" He went back up the stairs to the officers' washroom and,\nafter a little search, got a container of liquid soap from the\nsupplies. Then he went back down to the control room. He made the jump\nto the chair, holding on with one hand while he held the container of\nsoap with the other.\n\n\"Can you hold me up with one hand? I'll need both hands to work with.\"\n\n\"In this gravity? Easy. Give me your belt.\"\n\nCaptain Atef Al-Amin grabbed Jayjay's belt and hung on, while Jayjay\nused both hands to squirt the liquid soap all over the captain from\nthe waist down.\n\nIt would have made a great newspaper photo. Captain Al-Amin, wedged\nbetween two steel cabinets, hanging upside-down under a pull of\none-fifteenth standard gee, holding up his rescuer by the belt. The\nrescuer, right-side-up, was squeezing a plastic container of liquid\nsoap and directing the stream against the captain.\n\nWhen Al-Amin was thoroughly wetted with the solution, Jayjay again\nbraced his feet against the steel panels and pulled.\n\nWith a slick, slurping sound, the captain slid loose, and the two of\nthem toppled head-over-heels across the room. Jayjay was prepared for\nthat; he stopped them both by grasping an overhead desk-top as they\nwent by. Then he let go, and the two men dropped slowly to what had\nbeen the ceiling.\n\n\"_Hoo!_\" said the captain. \"That's a relief! Allah!\"\n\nJayjay took a look at the man's arm. \"Radius might be broken; ulna\nseems O.K. We'll splint it later. Your legs are going to tingle like\ncrazy when the feeling comes back.\"\n\n\"I know. But we have other things to worry about, Mr. Kelvin.\nEvidently you and I are the only ones awake so far, and I'm in no\ncondition to go moving all over this spinning bucket just yet. Would\nyou do some reconnoitering for me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Jayjay. \"Just tell me what you want.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin half an hour, the news was in.\n\nThere were five men alive in the ship: Jayjay, Captain Al-Amin, Jeffry\nHull, Second Officer Vandenbosch, and Maintenance Officer Smith.\nVandenbosch had broken both legs and had to be strapped into a bunk\nand given a shot of narcolene.\n\nJayjay had put on a spacesuit and taken a look outside. The whole rear\nend of the ship was gone, and with it had gone the First Officer, the\nRadio Officer, and the Engineering Officer. And, of course, the main\npower plant of the ship.\n\nMost of the cargo hold was intact, but the walls had been breached,\nand the air was gone.\n\n\"Well, that's that,\" said Captain Al-Amin. Jayjay, Smith, Hull, and\nthe captain were in the control room, trying not to look glum. \"I wish\nI knew what happened.\"\n\n\"Meteor,\" Jayjay said flatly. \"The bumper hull is fused at the edges\nof the break, and the direction of motion was inward.\"\n\n\"I don't see how it could have got by the meteor detectors,\" said\nSmith, a lean, sad-looking man with a badly bruised face.\n\n\"I don't either,\" the captain said, \"but it must have. If the engines\nhad blown, the damage would have been quite different.\"\n\nJeffry Hull nervously took a cigarette from his pocket pack. His nose\nhad quit bleeding, but his eye was purpling rapidly and was almost\nswollen shut.\n\nCaptain Al-Amin leaned over and gently took the cigarette from Hull's\nfingers. \"No smoking, I'm afraid. We'll have to conserve oxygen.\"\n\n\"You guys are so damn _calm_!\" Hull said. His voice betrayed a surface\nof anger covering a substratum of fear. \"Here we are, heading away\nfrom the Solar System at eighteen million miles an hour, and you all\nact as if we were going on a picnic or something.\"\n\nThe observation was hardly accurate. Any group of men who went on a\npicnic in the frame of mind that Jayjay and the others were in would\nhave produced the gloomiest outing since the Noah family took a trip\nin an excursion boat.\n\n\"There's nothing to worry about,\" Captain Al-Amin said gently. \"All we\nhave to do is set the screamers going, and the Interplanetary Police\nwill pick us up.\"\n\n\"Screamers?\" Hull looked puzzled.\n\nInstead of answering the implied question, the captain looked at\nSmith. \"Have you checked them?\" He knew that Smith had, but he was\ntrying to quiet Hull's fears.\n\nSmith nodded. \"They're O.K.\" He looked at Hull. \"A screamer is an\nemergency radio. There's one in every compartment. You've seen them.\"\nHe pointed across the room, toward a red panel in the wall. \"In\nthere.\"\n\n\"But I thought it was impossible for a spaceship in flight to contact\na planet by radio,\" Hull objected.\n\n\"Normally, it is,\" Smith admitted. \"It takes too much power and too\ntight a beam to get much intelligence over a distance that great from\na moving ship. But the screamers are set up for emergency purposes.\nThey're like flares, except that they operate on microwave frequencies\ninstead of visible light.\n\n\"The big radio telescopes on Luna and on the Jovian satellites can\npick them up if we beam them sunward, and the Plutonian station can\npick us up if we beam in that direction.\"\n\nHull looked much calmer. \"But where do you get the power if the\nengines are gone? Surely the emergency batteries won't supply that\nkind of power.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Each screamer has its own power supply. It's a\nhydrogen-oxygen fuel cell that generates a hell of a burst of power\nfor about thirty minutes before it burns out from the overload. It's\nmeant to be used only once, but it does the job.\"\n\n\"How do they know where to find us from a burst like that?\" Hull\nasked.\n\n\"Well, suppose we only had one screamer. We'd beam it toward Pluto,\nsince it would be easier for an IP ship to get to us from there. Since\nall screamers have the same frequency--don't ask me what it is; I'm\nnot a radio man--the velocity of our ship will be indicated by the\nDoppler Effect. That is, our motion toward or away from them can be\ncalculated that way. Our angular velocity with respect to them can be\nchecked while the screamer is going; they will know which direction\nwe're moving, if we're moving at an angle.\n\n\"With that information, all they have to do is find out which ship is\nin that general area of the sky, which they can find out by checking\nthe schedule, and they can estimate approximately where we'll be. The\nIP ship will come out, and when they get in the general vicinity, they\ncan find us with their meteor detectors. Nothing to it.\"\n\n\"And,\" Captain Al-Amin added, \"since we have eight screamers still\nleft with us, we have plenty of reserves to call upon. There's\nnothing to worry about, Mr. Hull.\"\n\n\"But how can you aim a beam when we're toppling end-over-end like\nthis?\" Hull asked.\n\n\"Well, if we couldn't stop the rotation,\" said the captain, \"we'd\nbroadcast instead of beaming. Anywhere within the Solar System, a\nscreamer can broadcast enough energy to overcome the background noise.\n\n\"The IP would have a harder time finding us, of course, but we'd be\nsaved eventually.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Hull \"How do we go about stopping the rotation?\"\n\n\"That's the next thing on the agenda,\" Al-Amin said. \"This seasick\nroll is caused by the unevenness of the load, and I'm pretty sick of\nit, myself. Smith, will you and Mr. Kelvin get out the emergency\nrockets? We'll see what we can do to stabilize our platform.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took better than an hour to get the ship straightened out. For the\nmain job, emergency rockets were set off at the appropriate spots\naround the hull to counteract the rotation. The final trimming was\ndone with carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, which Smith and Jayjay\nKelvin used as jets.\n\nGetting a fix on Pluto was easy enough; the lighthouse station at Styx\nbroadcast a strong beep sunward every ten seconds. They could also\npick up the radio lighthouses on Eros, Ceres, Luna, and Mimas.\nEvidently, the one on Titan was behind the Jovian bulk.\n\nThey were ready to send their distress call.\n\n\"It's simple,\" Smith said as he opened the red panel in the wall of\nthe control room. \"First we turn on the receiver.\" He pushed a button\nmarked _R_. \"Then we turn these two wheels here until the pip on that\nlittle screen is centered. That's the signal from Pluto. It comes in\nstrong every ten seconds, see?\"\n\nJayjay watched with interest. He'd heard about screamers and had seen\nthem, but he'd never had the opportunity of observing one in action.\n\nLike flares or bombs, they were intended for one-time use. The\ninstructions were printed plainly on the inside of the red door, and\nSmith was simply reading off what was printed there.\n\n\"These wheels,\" he was saying, \"line up the parabolic reflector with\nthe Pluto signal, you see. There. Now we've got it centered. Now, all\nwe have to do is make one small correction and we're all set. These\nthings are built so that they're fool-proof; a kid could operate it.\nWatch.\"\n\nFacing each other across a small gap were a pair of tapered screw\nplugs, one male and one female. The male was an average of half an\ninch in diameter; the female was larger and bored to fit the male.\n\n\"The female plug,\" Smith said, \"leads to two tanks of high-pressure\ngas inside this cabinet on the left. One tank of oxygen, one of\nhydrogen. See how this male plug telescopes out to fit into the\nfemale? All we have to do is thread them together, and everything is\nautomatic.\"\n\nJayjay was aware that Smith's explanations were meant to give Jeffry\nHull something to think about instead of his fears. Hull was basically\nan Earth-hugger, and free fall did nothing to keep him calm. Evidently\nhis subconscious knew that he had to latch on to something to keep his\nmental equilibrium, because he showed a tremendous amount of interest\nin what should have been a routine operation.\n\n\"How do you mean, it's all automatic?\" he asked. \"What happens?\"\n\n\"Well, you can't see into the female plug, but look here at the male.\nSee those concentric tubes leading into the interior of the cabinet on\nthe right? The outer one leads in the oxygen, the inner leads in the\nhydrogen. We need twice as much hydrogen as oxygen, so the inner tube\nhas twice the volume delivery as the outer. See?\"\n\n\"Yes. But what is the solid silver bar in the center of the inner\ntube?\"\n\n\"That's the electrical connection for the starter battery. There's a\nsmall, short-lived chemical battery, like the ones in an ordinary\npocket radio, except that they're built to deliver a high-voltage,\nhigh-amperage current for about a tenth of a second. That activates\nthe H-O cell, you see. Also, that silver stud depresses the\ncorresponding stud in the female plug, which turns on the gas flow\nbefore it makes the connection with the starter battery. Follow?\"\n\nHull didn't look as though he did, but he nodded gamely. \"Then what\nhappens?\"\n\n\"Then the hydrogen and the oxygen come together in the fuel cell and,\ninstead of generating heat, they generate electric current. That\ncurrent is fed into the radio unit, and the signal is sent to Pluto.\nReal simple.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Hull said. \"Well ... go ahead.\"\n\nSmith telescoped the two leads together and began turning the collar\non the female plug.\n\nHe screwed it up as far as it would go.\n\nAnd nothing happened.\n\n\"What the hell?\" asked Smith of no one in particular. He tried to\ntwist it a little harder. Nothing happened. The threads had gone as\nfar as they would go.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Jayjay asked.\n\n\"Damfino. No connection. Nothing's happening. And it's as tight as it\nwill go.\"\n\n\"Are the gases flowing?\" Jayjay asked.\n\n\"I don't know. These things aren't equipped with meters. They're\nsupposed to work automatically.\"\n\nJayjay pushed Smith aside. \"Let me take a look.\"\n\nSmith frowned as though he resented an ordinary passenger shoving him\naround, but Jayjay ignored him. He cocked his head to one side and\nlooked at the connection. \"Hm-m-m.\" He touched it with a finger. Then\nhe wet the finger with his tongue and touched the connection again.\n\"There's no gas flow, Smith.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Smith was still frowning.\n\n\"There's a gap there. That tapered thread isn't in tight. If there\nwere any gas flowing, it would be leaking out.\" Before Smith could say\nanything Jayjay began unscrewing the coupling. When it came apart, it\nlooked just the same as it had before Smith had put it together.\n\nIn the dim glow from the emergency lights, it was difficult to see\nanything.\n\n\"Got an electric torch?\" Jayjay asked.\n\nSmith pushed himself away from the screamer panel and came back after\na moment with a flashlight. \"Let me take a look,\" he said, edging\nJayjay aside. He looked over the halves of the coupling very\ncarefully, then said: \"I don't see anything wrong. I'll try it again.\"\n\n\"Hold on a second,\" Jayjay said quietly. \"Let me take a look, will\nyou?\"\n\nSmith handed him the torch. \"Go ahead, but there's nothing wrong.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJayjay took the light and looked the connections over again. Then he\nscrewed his head around so that he could look into the female plug.\n\n\"Hm-m-m. Hard to count. Gap's too small. Anybody got a toothpick?\"\n\nNobody did.\n\nJayjay turned to Jeffry Hull. \"Mr. Hull, would you mind going to the\nlounge? I think there's some toothpicks in the snack refrigerator.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Hull. \"Sure.\"\n\nHe pushed himself across the control room and disappeared through the\nstairwell.\n\n\"Get several of them,\" Jayjay called after him.\n\nCaptain Al-Amin said: \"What's the trouble, Mr. Kelvin?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet,\" Jayjay answered. \"When did you last have the\nscreamer units inspected?\"\n\n\"Just before we took off from Jove Station,\" Al-Amin said. \"That's the\nlaw. All emergency equipment has to be checked before takeoff. Why?\nWhat's the matter?\"\n\n\"Did they check this unit?\" Jayjay asked doggedly.\n\n\"Certainly. I watched them check it myself. I--\" He brought himself up\nshort and said: \"Give me that torch, will you? I want to take a look\nat the thing.\"\n\nJayjay handed him the flashlight and grasped the captain's belt. With\none arm in a splint, Al-Amin couldn't hold the flashlight and hold on\nto anything solid at the same time.\n\n\"I don't see anything wrong,\" he said after a minute.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" Jayjay admitted. \"But the way it acts--\"\n\n\"I got the toothpicks!\" Jeffry Hull propelled himself across the room\ntoward the three men who were clustered around the screamer.\n\nJayjay took the toothpicks, selected one, and inserted it into the\nfemale plug. \"Hard to see those threads with all the tubes blocking\nthat plug,\" he said offhandedly.\n\nHull said: \"Captain, did you know that the refrigerator is off?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Atef Al-Amin absently. \"It isn't connected to the\nemergency circuits. Wastes too much energy. What do you find, Mr.\nKelvin?\"\n\nAfter a second's silence, Jayjay said: \"Let me check once more.\" He\nwas running the tip of the toothpick across the threads in the female\nplug, counting as he did so. \"Uh-huh,\" he said finally, \"just as I\nthought. There's one less thread in the female plug. The male plug is\nstopped before it can make contact. There's a gap of about a tenth of\nan inch when the coupling is screwed up tight.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" Smith said. He took the toothpick and went through the\nsame operation. \"You're right,\" he said ruefully, \"the female plug is\nfaulty. We'll have to use one of the other screamers.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Jayjay.\n\nWrong, said Fate. Or the Powers That Be, or the Fallibility of Man,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\nEvery screamer unit suffered from the same defect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't understand it!\" A pause. \"It's impossible! Those units were\ntested!\"\n\nFor the first time in his life, Captain Atef Abdullah Al-Amin allowed\nhis voice to betray him.\n\nArabic is normally spoken about half an octave above the normal tone\nused for English. And, unlike American English, it tends to waver up\nand down the scale. Usually, the captain spoke English in the flat,\nun-accented tones of the Midwest American accent, and spoke Arabic in\nthe ululating tones of the Egyptian.\n\nBut now he was speaking English with an Egyptian waver, not realizing\nthat he was doing it.\n\n\"How could it happen? It's ridiculous!\"\n\nThe captain, his maintenance officer, and Jeffry Hull were clustered\naround the screamer unit in the lounge. Off to one side, Jayjay Kelvin\nheld a deck of cards in his hands and played a game of patience called\n\"transportation solitaire.\" His eyes didn't miss a play, just as his\nears didn't miss a word.\n\nHe pulled an ace from the back of the deck and flipped it to the\nfront.\n\n\"You said the screamers had been checked,\" Jeffry Hull said\naccusingly. \"How come they _weren't_ checked?\"\n\n\"They _were_!\" Al-Amin said sharply.\n\n\"Sure they were,\" Smith added. \"I watched the check-off. There was\nnothing wrong then.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" Hull said, the acid bite of fear in his voice, \"we have\nto sit here and wait for the Interplanetary Police to find us by pure\nluck.\"\n\nThe captain should have let Hull cling to the idea that the IP could\nfind the _Persephone_, even if no signal was sent. But the captain was\nalmost as angry and flustered as Hull was.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Find us?\" he snapped. \"Don't be ridiculous! We won't even be missed\nuntil we're due at Styx, on Pluto, nine days from now. By that time,\nwe'll be close to two billion miles beyond the orbit of Pluto. We'll\nnever be found if we wait 'til then. Something has to be done _now_!\"\nHe looked at his Maintenance Officer. \"Smith, isn't there some way to\nmake contact between those two plugs?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Smith said bitterly. \"If we had the tools, it would be duck\nsoup. All we'd have to do is trim down the male plug to fit the\nfemale, and we'd have it. But we don't have the tools. We've got a\ncouple of files and a quarter-horsepower electric drill with one bit.\nEverything else was in the tool compartment--which is long gone, with\nthe engine room.\"\n\n\"Can't you ... uh, what do you call it? Uh ... jury-something--\"\nHull's voice sounded as though he were forcing it to be calm.\n\n\"Jury-rig?\" Smith said. \"Yeah? With what? Dammit, we haven't got any\ntools, and we haven't got any materials to work with!\"\n\n\"Can't you just use a wrench to tighten them more?\" Hull asked\nhelplessly.\n\nSmith said a dirty word and pushed himself away from the screamer unit\nto glower at an unresisting wall.\n\n\"No, Mr. Hull, we couldn't,\" said Captain Al-Amin with restrained\npatience. \"That would strip the threads. If the electrical contact\nwere made at the same time, the high-pressure oxygen-hydrogen flow\nwould spark off, and we'd get a big explosion that would wreck\neverything--including us.\" Then he muttered to himself: \"I still don't\nsee how it could happen.\"\n\nJayjay Kelvin pulled a nine of spades from the back of the deck to the\nfront. It matched the four of spades that had come three cards\nbefore. Jayjay discarded the two cards between the spades. \"You\ndon't?\" he asked. \"Didn't you ever hear that the total is greater than\nthe sum of its parts?\"\n\n\"What?\" Captain Al-Amin sounded as though he'd been insulted--in\nArabic. \"What are you talking about, Mr. Kelvin?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about the idiocy of the checking system,\" Jayjay said\nflatly. \"Don't you see what they did? Don't you see what happened?\nEach part of a screamer has to be checked separately, right?\"\n\nAl-Amin nodded.\n\n\"Why? Because the things burn out if you check them as a complete\nunit. It's like checking a .50 caliber cartridge. The only way you can\ncheck a cartridge is to shoot it in a gun. If it works, then you know\nit works. Period. The only trouble is that you've wasted the\ncartridge. You know that _that_ one is good, but you've ruined it.\n\n\"Same way with a screamer. If you test it as a unit, you'll ruin it.\nSo you test it a part at a time. All the parts check out nicely\nbecause the test mechanisms are built to check each part.\"\n\nSmith squinted. \"Well, sure. If you check out the whole screamer,\nyou'll ruin it. So what?\"\n\n\"So suppose you were going to check out a cartridge,\" Jayjay said.\n\"You don't fire it; you check each part separately. You check the\nbrass case. It's all right; the tests show that it won't burst under\nfiring pressure. You check the primer; the tests show that it will\nexplode when hit by the gun's hammer. You check the powder; the tests\nshow that the powder will burn nicely when the flame from the primer\nhits it. You check the bullet; the tests show that the slug will be\nexpelled at the proper velocity when the powder is ignited.\n\n\"So you assume that the cartridge will function when fired.\n\n\"But will it?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't it?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Because the flame from the exploding primer can't reach the powder,\nthat's why!\" Jayjay snapped. \"Some jerk has redesigned the primer so\nthat the flame misses the propellant!\"\n\n\"How could that happen?\" Hull asked blankly.\n\n\"How? Because Designer _A_ decided that the male plug on the screamer\nshould have one more turn on its threads, but he forgot to tell\nDesigner _B_, who designs the female plug, that the two should match.\nThe testing equipment is designed to test each part, so each part\ntests out fine. The only trouble is that the thing doesn't test out as\na whole.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Al-Amin nodded slowly. \"That's right. The test showed that the\noxyhydrogen section worked fine. It showed that the starter worked\nfine. It showed that the radiowave broadcaster worked fine. But it\ndidn't show that they'd work together.\"\n\nSmith said a short, five-letter word. It was French; the Anglo-Saxon\nequivalent has only four letters. \"What good does all this theorizing\ndo us?\" he added. \"The question is: How do we fix the thing?\"\n\n\"Well, can't you put another turn on the thread?\" Hull asked.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Smith said sarcastically. \"You give me a lathe and the\nproper tools, and I'll make you all the connections you want. Hell, if\nI had the proper tools, I could turn us out a new spaceship, and we\ncould all go home in comfort.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you drill out the metal with that drill?\" Hull asked\nplaintively.\n\n\"No!\" Smith said harshly. \"How do you expect me to get a quarter-inch\nbit into a space less than a sixteenth of an inch in diameter?\"\n\nHull wasn't used to machinist's terms. \"How big is an inch?\"\n\n\"Two point five four oh oh oh five centimeters,\" Smith said in a nasty\ntone of voice. \"Does that help you any?\"\n\n\"I'm just trying to help!\" Hull snapped. \"You've got no call to get\nsarcastic with me!\"\n\nSmith said the French word again.\n\n\"Enough!\" the captain barked. \"Smith, control your tongue! That sort\nof thing won't help us.\" He jerked his head around. \"Mr. Kelvin, do\nyou have any suggestions?\"\n\nJayjay played another card. \"No. Not yet. I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"Smith? Any ideas?\" The tone of the Arab's voice left no doubt that he\nmeant business.\n\n\"No, sir. Without a properly equipped machine shop, there's nothing we\ncan do.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because that's a precision job, sir. The threads are tapered so that\nthe fit will be gas-tight. That's why the threads have a\nten-thousandth of an inch of soft polyethylene covering the hard\nsteel, so that when the threads are tight, the polyethylene will act\nas a seal. Everything in that connection is a precision fitted job.\nThe ends of the tubes are made to be slightly mashed together, so that\nthe seals will be tight--they're coated with polyethylene, too. If the\noxygen and hydrogen mix, the efficiency of the fuel cell goes down to\nzero, and you run the chance of an explosion.\"\n\n\"Show me,\" Al-Amin said.\n\nSmith took a pencil out of his pocket and began drawing a cross\nsection of the connection on the top of the nearby table.\n\n\"Look here, captain, this is the way the two are supposed to fit. But\nthey don't, because the male plug can't get far enough into the female\nsocket to make the connection. Like this, see?\"\n\nThe captain nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" Smith continued, \"there's a thirty-second of an inch clearance\nthere. If the female had one more turn of thread, the fit would be\nprefect. As it is, we get no connection. So the screamer doesn't\nfunction.\"\n\nAl-Amin looked at the drawing. \"Odd that there's never been any\ncomplaint about this error before.\"\n\nJayjay turned another ace. \"Not so odd, really.\"\n\nAll heads turned toward Jayjay.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Smith asked.\n\n\"Just what I said.\" Jayjay turned another card. \"A screamer is\nsupposed to call for help, isn't it? It's only used in a dire\nemergency. Then the only test of the whole unit comes when the\noccupants of the spaceship are in danger--as we are. If the things\ndon't work, how could there be any complaint? If we can't get ours to\nwork, will we complain? To whom?\n\n\"How many ships have been reported missing in the past year or so? All\nof them presumed lost because of meteor strikes, eh? If a ship is lost\nand doesn't signal, we presume that it was totally destroyed. If it\nwasn't, they'd have signaled. As _Mister_ Smith says: See?\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\nJayjay Kelvin turned the last card, saw that he had lost, and began\nshuffling the deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think I've got it,\" Smith said excitedly, several hours later.\n\nCaptain Al-Amin glanced around. Hull was dozing fitfully a few inches\nabove the couch. Jayjay Kelvin was still methodically playing\nsolitaire.\n\n\"Keep your voice down,\" the captain ordered. \"No use giving our\npassengers false hopes. What do you mean, you've got it?\"\n\n\"Simple. Real simple. All we have to do is file off the last thread of\nthe male plug. Then it will fit into the female.\" Smith's voice was a\nhoarse whisper.\n\n\"Won't work,\" said Jayjay Kelvin from across the room.\n\nSmith blew up. \"How do you know?\" he roared. \"You sit over there\nmaking wiseacre remarks and do nothing! Play cards, that's all! What\ndo you know about things like this, _Mister_ Joseph Kelvin? What does\na businessman know about mechanical equipment?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" Jayjay said quietly. \"Enough to know that, if you try to\nfile off the final thread of the male plug, you'll do an uneven job.\nAnd that will mean leakage.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, an uneven job?\" Smith was still furious.\n\n\"Trimming off the end of the male plug would have to be done on a\nlathe,\" Jayjay said, without looking up from his cards. \"Otherwise,\nthe fit would be wrong, and the gases would mix. And we would all go\n_phfft!_ when the mixture blew.\"\n\nSmith started to say something, but Jayjay went right on talking.\n\"Even if we had a lathe, the male plug doesn't turn, so you'd be out\nof luck all the way. You can't take the screamers apart without\nwrecking them--not without a machine shop. You're going to have to\nwork on that female connection. She's got a sleeve on her that will\nturn. Now, if--\" Jayjay's voice faded off into silence, and his\nmanipulations of the cards became purely mechanical.\n\n\"Huh!\" Smith said softly. \"Just because he's related to Kelvin\nAssociates, he thinks he's hot--\" He said the French word again.\n\n\"Is he right?\" Captain Al-Amin asked sharply.\n\n\"Well--\" Smith rubbed his nose with a forefinger. \"Well, yes. I was\nwrong. We can't do it with a file. It would have to be turned on a\nlathe, and we don't have a lathe. And we don't have any measuring\ninstruments, either. This is a precision job, as I said. And we don't\nhave a common ruler aboard, much less a micrometer. Any makeshift job\nwill be a failure.\"\n\nCaptain Al-Amin brooded over that for a moment. Then he looked at\nJayjay again. \"Mr. Kelvin.\"\n\n\"Yes, captain?\" Jayjay didn't look up from the cards in his hands.\n\n\"_Are_ you related to Kelvin Associates?\"\n\n\"In a way.\"\n\nAl-Amin bit at his lower lip. \"Mr. Kelvin, you registered aboard this\nship as Joseph Kelvin. May I ask if your middle name is James?\"\n\nAfter a short pause, Jayjay said: \"Yes. It is.\"\n\n\"Are you _the_ J. J. Kelvin?\"\n\n\"Yup. But I'd rather you didn't mention it when we get to Pluto.\"\n\nSmith's jaw had slowly sagged during that conversation. Then he closed\nhis mouth with a snap. \"You're Jayjay Kelvin?\" he asked, opening his\nmouth again.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then I apologize.\"\n\n\"Accepted,\" said Jayjay. He wished that Smith hadn't apologized.\n\n\"Why didn't you say so in the first place?\" Captain Al-Amin asked.\n\n\"Because I didn't want it known that I was going to Pluto,\" Kelvin\nsaid. \"And--after the accident happened--I kept quiet because I know\nhuman nature.\"\n\nJeffry Hull, who had awakened during the argument, looked at Jayjay\nand said: \"What's human nature got to do with it, Mr. Kelvin?\"\n\n\"Nothing, except that if I'd told everyone I was J. J. Kelvin, all of\nyou would have been sitting around waiting for me to solve the problem\ninstead of thinking about it yourselves.\"\n\nHull nodded thoughtfully. \"It makes sense, Mr. Kelvin. If they'd known\nthat you were ... well ... Mister Spaceship Himself, they'd have let\nyou do all the thinking. And that would have left you high and dry,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\nJayjay put the deck of cards in his pocket. \"You're a pretty good\nsociologist, after all, Mr. Hull. You're right. Face any group with\nAuthority--with a capital _A_--and they quit thinking for themselves.\nAnd if they do, then the poor slob of an Authority doesn't have\nanything to tickle his own brains, so everybody loses.\"\n\n\"Well, _do_ you have an answer?\" Captain Al-Amin asked.\n\nJayjay shook his head. \"Not yet. I think I've got one coming up, but I\nwish you two would go on talking while I think.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Smith said wryly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe problem was both simple and complex. The female socket lacked one\nsingle turn of thread to make a perfect connection. A few hundredths\nof an inch separated success from disaster.\n\nFive men, including the unconscious Vandenbosch, were only a fraction\nof an inch away from death.\n\nJayjay Kelvin listened to Smith talk for another half hour, throwing\nin objections when necessary, but offering no opinions.\n\n\"All we have to do,\" Smith said at last, \"is get rid of that little\nbit of metal beyond the thread in the female socket. But there's no\nway to get it out. We can't use a chisel because the force would warp\nthe threads. Besides, we couldn't get a chisel in there.\"\n\n\"And we don't have a chisel,\" Captain Al-Amin added. \"We don't have\nany tools at all.\"\n\n\"Except,\" said Jayjay, \"an electric hand drill and a quarter-inch\nbit.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" said Smith. \"But what good will that do us?\"\n\n\"If we rigged a belt between the drill's motor and the sleeve of the\nfemale socket, the sleeve would rotate as if it were on a lathe,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\nSmith blinked. \"Sure. Yeah! Hey!\" His face brightened. Then it looked\nsad again. \"But what good would that do us?\"\n\n\"You said that all we have between us and success is a fraction of an\ninch of metal. If we can remove that fraction of an inch, we're\nsuccessful.\"\n\n\"But how can you put a thread into that socket?\" Smith asked.\n\nJayjay beamed as though it were his birthday. \"We don't have to put a\nthread in there. All we have to do is give the thread on the male plug\nroom to move in. All we have to do is clear away that metal. So we'll\nuse the drill motor to turn the sleeve as if it were on a lathe.\"\n\nSmith still didn't look enthusiastic. \"All right. We have a lathe. But\nwhat are we going to use for tools? What are we going to cut the metal\nwith?\"\n\nJayjay's smile became broader. \"Carbon steel. What else?\"\n\n\"Oh?\" said Smith. \"And where do we get these tools, Mr. Kelvin? From\nthe circumambient ether?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Jayjay. \"Did you ever chip flint?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind. All we have to do is use that quarter-inch bit.\"\n\nSmith still looked confused. \"I don't get it. A bit that big won't fit\nin.\"\n\n\"We simply crack a piece off that hard carbon steel,\" Jayjay said. \"We\ncan make a lathe tool that will fit into the small space between the\ninner and outer tubes. The fractured edge will be sharp enough to take\nout the excess metal. The male plug can move in, and we'll have\ncontact.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be--\" Smith used another French word.\n\nCaptain Atef Al-Amin cast his eyes upwards. \"_Creatio ex nihilo_,\" he\nsaid softly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the Interplanetary Police ship took the five men and the cargo\nfrom the wreck of the _Persephone_, the major in command of the ship,\nwho knew that he had rescued the great J. J. Kelvin, asked him: \"Mr.\nKelvin, what do you plan to do when you return to Ceres City?\"\n\nAnd Jayjay, who knew that both he and the major were speaking for the\nnewsfacs and for posterity, said:\n\n\"I'm going to make sure that Kelvin Associates learns to make\nemergency equipment properly.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
