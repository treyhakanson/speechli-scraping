But I certainly hadn't intended to write it while residing\nunder police surveillance in the Recuperating Ward of St. Luke's\nMemorial Hospital. Nor did I expect the interest and encouragement of\nthe police officer who put me here. Nonetheless, Sgt. Nicolas Falasca\nof the Ohio State Police has been most helpful both in the many long\ndiscussions we have had and in procuring the notes and data from my\nlaboratory for the preparation of this manuscript.\n\nBut I'm afraid there shall be a considerable lot of me in this\nmanuscript--which, I hastily assert, is not its purpose at all. My\napologies for that. Fact is, there's a considerable lot of me, as\nanyone can see. The term I rather prefer using is roly-poly.\n\nFor the record, however, I am duly Certified-at-Birth as one Albert\nJamieson Cooling, to which has been added, by my own modest efforts,\na few odd alphabetic symbols such as M.S. and Ph.D. I am currently\nholding down a professorship at a small, privately endowed Tech\ncollege, have some mentionable background in both nuclear physics and\nbiochemistry, possess a choice collection of rather good jazz records,\nhave a particular fondness for barbecued spareribs--and, of late, have\nbecome an inventor.\n\nIf I've left something out, such as horn-rimmed glasses, then, by the\npoint of my little black beard, it must be the wardrobe of 36 sport\njackets. Wives? Well, I've been tempted, but a professor's salary can't\nsupport alimony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy discovery of the Cooling Effect itself came quite by accident.\nBut twice now, that accident has almost killed me. It may be argued\nthat this is no more than I should have expected, however, since the\ninvention which \"followed naturally\" can only be called one thing.\n\nI have invented a new weapon.\n\nThat's right--a Cooling gun.\n\nBut let it be said that because I was once a war scientist, my\ninventiveness must therefore tend toward weapons and I should be\nstrongly tempted to reach for the nearest one available. The term war\nscientist has been used so much, and has grown so commonplace, that it\nhas become universally accepted as the label for anyone who spent as\nlittle as six weeks in the old AEC. I was in it for six years, and I\nvoluntarily walked out.\n\nThe official policies and inter-agency politics of that era seem of\nlittle consequence now, when we have three permanent space satellites\ncircling the Earth and one of them is Russian. We're no longer in a\nweapons race; both sides have reached the Ultimate Weapon in that\ncontest. Nobody's hiding or betraying classified secrets any more.\nThere's all that silicon-rich basalt waiting to be cheaply processed\nout on the Moon, if we can only get there....\n\nBack in '69, the official news releases were still boasting how much\nbigger was each new toy we rolled out of the workshop, how much\nmore terrible destruction it would wreak than the last one. That was\nhogwash dished out by our PR boys (and, on the other side, by the Reds'\nPropaganda Ministry) simply because people didn't know any better.\nActually, our toys that made the biggest bang were the worst flops as\nweapons.\n\nYou don't conquer an enemy by exterminating him. A hundred million\ncorpses are no problem--just use bulldozers and they're out of the way.\nBut a hundred million living, breathing, freezing, starving, filthy and\nragged human beings can raise one hell of an uproar. And they usually\ndo. Some of us felt that we wouldn't need to knock off even a third of\nRussia's major cities. Much less, in fact.\n\nDr. Charles Whitney made the mistake of saying so. And they canned him.\nThe scuttlebutt was that Doc's conscience backfired. I know better; I\nsaw the explosion. It was his patience, not his conscience.\n\nAnyway, I turned in my resignation two weeks later. I walked out, kept\nmy mouth shut and settled down to a small college professorship. I\nmention these events now simply because I believe it was there that the\ndevelopment of the Cooling gun actually started.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had begun to see what devastating weapons could never achieve. They\n_had_ deterred warfare, at least up to that August of 1969, by their\nthreat of utter destruction--and perhaps Whitney deserved to get\ncanned--but they offered no guarantee for the future. And they couldn't\nliberate a conquered nation or protect people from a dictator's secret\npolice.\n\nIt was time we had something better. (We did, of course, but only a\nsmall part of the AEC was in on the development of atomic rockets.)\nUntil we did, I could sense that we were simply going through the\nmotions.\n\nBut it all began to go places fast with that cold research we were\ndabbling in, last semester. In fact, it was my fault that General\nAtomics tossed that little problem into our Cold Lab here at Webster\nTech--my own past service in the AEC, my rather unusual background\ncombining nuclear physics and biochemistry, and the post-grad crew I've\nmanaged to accumulate under my professorial wing.\n\nThe whole deal was shoveled obligingly into my Christmas stocking and\nthe rest of the faculty obligingly left me to play with it--providing I\ncontinued to conduct my regular classes, of course.\n\nPerhaps it's just as well I kept my hand in, though, because that line\nof research got rapidly nowhere. We found that materials which have\ntheir temperatures reduced to near-absolute zero are just plain cold.\nBring them into room temperature and strange things happen sometimes\nthat isn't just them trying to warm up. It isn't friction-loss and it\nisn't radiation damage and it isn't entropy.\n\nIt shows.\n\nThere's a band of radiant energy somewhere between ultrasonics and\nradiant heat that hits fast and goes deep, and comes out just as\nfast, and it gets triggered off by whatever this is that happens with\nnear-absolute zero objects subjected to room temperature. But the whole\nthing is so negligible that for most practical purposes it can be\nignored.\n\nFinding _that_ out cost General Atomics thirty thousand dollars,\nbut our kids in the Cold Lab had a ball rigging the Mad Scientist's\nsuper-disintegrator gizmo that reproduced the phenomenon.\n\nThen, that night--it's nearly four months ago now--I was alone in the\nlab, just switched off the lights, about to close up and go home. And I\nstumbled over the corner of the thing. Scrambling up, somehow I put my\nfoot into it. And reaching out to grasp its frame, to steady myself, my\nhand hit the switch. It went on and I went out.\n\nIt was still on--I thought--when I regained consciousness, spraddled\nout on the concrete floor. I pulled the switch open and jerked the cord\nout of the wall socket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I got home, there wasn't a bruise or a bump on my noggin. Nor the\nfaintest sign of a burn anywhere on my foot or leg or even on the sole\nof my shoe.\n\nThat was a Tuesday night.\n\nThe next day, the lab remained closed. But that night, I went in,\nswitched the lights on and studied the machine. It showed absolutely\nno sign of damage, no burned insulation, nothing. I stuck my hand into\nit and closed the switch. It came on with its usual quiet hum. Nothing\nhappened.\n\nIt was almost a week before I heard that the janitor was still\nwondering who'd blown all the campus fuses on Tuesday night. Then I\nremembered that I hadn't switched the lights back on when I regained\nconsciousness.\n\nI had been blinded when I switched them off, had stumbled over the\nmachine, fallen, all the rest of it. But I'd come to with night vision,\nnaturally. I saw well enough then by the moonlight streaming in the lab\nwindows. All the lights--the machine, too--could have been off, with\nthe fuses blown, without my noticing it. I had assumed the machine was\non because its switch was closed, had opened the switch and jerked out\nthe cord plug.\n\nWhat happened had therefore required a tremendous spurt of juice in\nthe circuits, or else a heck of a lot less juice than we carry in our\nlab outlets. So I took home the prints on the rig and began making\nchanges. Which led to more changes. Which resulted in some rather\ncomplicated mathematics to which we scientific chaps resort when the\nkind we teach in colleges just won't work out right. I got it: a very\nlow power-input. And I got more.\n\nThe thing is a sort of invisible ray. It can only be emitted,\nor broadcast, as a narrow beam from the muzzle-coils of a very\nfancy-looking electronic rig. Low power is a must; more juice not only\nheats up the rig and smokes insulation, but it won't shoot the beam.\n\nI tested it on the black tulips (Biochemical Research Project 187)\nwhich I got to close up by the clock, not by the Sun, last year\n(Project 187-A) and their blossoms closed each time the beam touched\nthem. The purple mushrooms which fluff their tops in radioactivity\nshowed no effects.\n\nIt works on a simple \"A\" battery. But there's a transistor hookup that\nbehaves like no transistor. Its molecular structure vibrates, which it\nshouldn't, and emits a sharp, keening note in the vicinity of E flat. A\nrather bulky muffler would be required, I'm afraid, to get rid of that\nnoise.\n\nBut the oddest thing, technically, is that invisible ray-beam. It\nhasn't any of the effects of electric shock. I'll not go into the\nelectro-neurological aspects of that--nobody could understand it\nexcept, just possibly, a neurologist--but the simple fact is that this\nray puts a victim to sleep instantly _and it doesn't do anything else_!\n\nNo blockages or convulsions of nerve ganglia, not even a temporary\ncatharsis of \"mild\" shock! Apparently it gallops up the \"white\nmatter\" of the nervous system quite harmlessly, then smacks the \"gray\nmatter\"--the brain, the spinal column--a good wallop. Painlessly.\n\nIn short, the victim just flops over and snores up a half-hour or so,\nand then awakens as if from a short nap, though perhaps with some\npuzzlement. There is no injury whatsoever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally I wanted to find out how the Cooling Effect worked and\nwhy--though I may never learn _what_ it is. Hypnosis? Artificially\ninduced, instantaneous sleep? (Victims can be handled without\nawakening.) Of course, I was curious. I'd have gone through it step by\nstep for my own satisfaction, even if somebody else had already done it\nbefore.\n\nNobody had--and it wasn't easy. During the rest of the term, even\nthrough final exams, I devoted every spare moment to the Cooling\nEffect. Even so, it took another two months' hot sweat--the summer\nvacation's practically gone now--to get those final diagrams onto my\ndrawing board.\n\nBut once I did, there it was, at least its basic circuits and\ncomponents. All I needed was to juggle them around, coax them into a\nslim, tubular case, put a carved butt on it containing the \"A\" battery\nand give it a push-button trigger. With that data, any good bench-hand\nin an electrical repair shop could have done the job. I fashioned it\nout of plastic and odds and ends in my basement laboratory.\n\nA glance in the telephone Red Book gave me the number of a local\nbreeding farm and a call soon brought a pair of fat, inquisitive\nguinea pigs in a small, wire-screened carrying cage. Beyond the patio\nwall, my house sides directly on open pasturage, and beyond that,\nlower in the valley, the alfalfa field begins. With a brisk pacing off\nof a base-line and some rough, splay-thumbed triangulation, I soon\ndetermined my new weapon's effectiveness from point-blank range to a\nthousand yards--on guinea pigs, that is.\n\nAt nine hundred yards, it still knocked them over for the count. At a\nthousand yards, it had no effect whatever, so far as I could determine\nthrough field glasses. The animals gave no sign that they even noticed\nit. That, plus the nature of the mechanism, indicates its application\nis definitely limited. Whether you make it small enough to fit a lady's\npurse or as big as an atomic cannon, its maximum effective range will\nstill remain 900 yards. And not just on guinea pigs.\n\nI already knew from my own experience what it does to a man at close\nrange. Blowing the fuses on the whole campus had been the real danger\nthere, however. Had it been the slightest bit different, even to the\nposition of my foot in that big machine, I should certainly have been\nelectrocuted that night.\n\nThat was the first time it almost killed me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Cooling Effect is worthless as an anesthetic for surgery. While the\nsleeping guinea pigs don't awaken when I pick them up out of their\ncage and handle them, even pulling their legs, they do struggle. They\nresist, like sleeping animals, not wanting to be disturbed. Still, I\npinched them and bounced them and they invariably slept through an\napproximate half-hour. It's shock, and it isn't. It's sleep, and it\nisn't.\n\nBut I certainly knew it was a weapon. A new weapon. And man alive,\n_what_ a weapon!\n\nI turned the guinea pigs loose in the patio, let them scamper, then\ntumbled them both with a quick sweep of the beam.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne man in ambush could knock over a whole company of marching troops!\n\nThe guns could be mounted on tripods with a rotating mechanism that\nkept them sweeping the area constantly. Anyone who approached within\n900 yards would go down--then wake up, climb back to their feet, and go\ndown again every half-hour. Man or animal. The guns could be strung out\nto cover a whole sector, then wired to a single main switch--and one\nlone observer could stop an infantry advance.\n\nBut they wouldn't stop guided missiles or even mortar fire. Nor would\nthey deflect through peepholes on a tank or pillbox. There isn't\nquite that much \"scatter\" from the beam reflecting off a hard surface.\nHowever, there is some--I fired through the wire-screen openings of the\ncage and had the beam glance directly off the back wall, often knocking\nthe guinea pigs down without hitting them directly. It went through\na handkerchief easily, even when folded thick. A thin glass tumbler,\nhowever, stopped it.\n\nYou could take cover from it almost anywhere--if you knew when you\nwere going to be shot at. You could wear a light plastic armor--if\nthe joints were sealed and you kept it hooked to about a fifty-pound\nair-condition unit. No problem at all if you ride a motor scooter.\n\nIt wouldn't stop an invading army, but it could certainly raise the\ndevil with the occupation. Almost anyone could make the gun. Given the\ncomponents of a pocket radio, a few pieces of copper wire, a few sticks\nof chewing gum and a penknife, I could whittle one out of wood or put\nit into a plastic toy water-pistol.\n\nBut what the Armed Forces _don't_ want right now is a new secret\nweapon! They have their manned satellite now, keeping its vigil over\nthe arsenals of Earth, their big atomic missiles ready to jump off\nagainst preset targets--but with the frightful unknown of deep space\nchilling their backsides.\n\nAnd, too, I can imagine trying to sell those Generals on something that\nwon't even stop a tank.\n\nI'm afraid I forgot to shut off the kitchen monitor that night. The\nservos dished out the dinner menu I'd dialed before noon, then whisked\nit away when it got cold. I noticed it when the waste processor's\nstuttering hum went on a bit longer than usual.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI realized all too clearly what a predicament I was in.\n\nThe Armed Forces would undoubtedly suppress my invention. Their lives\nare nightmarish enough already--not knowing what they'll find out in\nspace or how it will affect matters. What's more, they would suppress\n_me_! There are certain retroactive clauses in that contract I signed\nwith the AEC which would do the job with complete legality. A nice\nlittle hideaway, then, with nothing for miles but security guards,\nradar traps, trip-wires and electric fences.\n\nBut that was the kindest fate I could expect. Quite a number of\nassorted big and small dictators might like my head blown off.\n\nThe most obvious alternative was to suppress the invention myself. To\ndestroy all traces of my experiments and forget about it. To convince\nmyself the world wasn't ready for it.\n\nIt's quite possible I might have--if I hadn't kept forgetting to shut\noff things--and if not for an unsavory little group.\n\nThere is small chance that Big Jake Claggett and his three henchmen\nwill ever be remembered for their unwitting contribution to science\nand the future of mankind. In fact, their contribution can be accepted\nas the merest coincidence--unless you discount Big Jake's liking for\nforeign sports cars. But that came later.\n\nWe always have had criminals and crime, and it just happened that\nClaggett's gang were the big news that day. It could as easily have\nbeen some other bunch of crooks.\n\nAnyway, when nine P.M. rolled around, my wall TV burst into\nits customary serenade of sound and color, timed for just enough of the\nopening commercial to let me settle down to watch Mr. Winkle's news\ncommentary. It was August 23rd, 1979. At two o'clock that afternoon,\nBig Jake Claggett and his gang robbed the Bellefontaine County Savings\nBank and got away with $23,000.\n\nOne of the gang clubbed the elderly bank guard senseless with the\nbarrel of his revolver. The guard was hospitalized for a possible skull\nfracture. Witnesses said Big Jake cursed the gunman who struck the\nguard, warning him to \"get hold of himself!\"\n\nThat was enough for me. The world had to be given my new weapon. (I'm\neven more convinced of it now, after discussing it with Sgt. Falasca.\nPractically every professional criminal in this country would give\nalmost anything for the Cooling gun. Then they could commit armed\nrobbery with no risk of earning a murder rap!) I could see that both\ncriminals and police officers would welcome it and for one simple\nreason.\n\nIt doesn't kill, maim or injure. Even if it should cause a tremendous\nincrease in robberies and similar crimes, its victims wouldn't be dead.\nBetter a hundred robberies than one man's death.\n\nBesides, I had a notion that I could discourage its criminal use.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFirst I had to prevent its suppression. Solve that problem and there\nwouldn't be any reason I couldn't manufacture the pistols, advertise\nthem, and sell them exactly as any firearms company can sell .22\nrifles. Except that I should probably do better to arrange for their\nmanufacture by some established firm.\n\nThat was when I began planning to write this. There is just one\ncondition under which no secret can be suppressed--_when it ceases to\nbe a secret!_\n\nIt took preparation. The roughed-out diagrams and scribbled notes a\nman uses in research are hardly suitable for publication. Technical\nspecifications had to be phrased in clear, understandable terms.\nThe complete data took nearly two weeks to reach final draft. Also,\nit seemed best to establish the importance, and at least imply the\nprobable consequences, of this publication.\n\nAnd then, obviously, I had to find a publisher.\n\nThat one had me stumped.\n\nFurthermore, I suspect it might still have me stumped if I did not now\nhave the full support of the Governor and the State Police of Ohio.\n_These police officers want Cooling guns!_ But even back then, while\nI was still the only man on Earth who knew about it, I managed to\nformulate a solution of sorts.\n\nAny publisher would be scared of the thing while only he and I and the\nprinters knew about it. He'd be risking a Federal injunction, at the\nvery least, even to consider publishing it.\n\nBut if it were no longer a secret and simply not yet _common\nknowledge_, most publishers would grab it. If, for example, some\nmanufacturing firm had already considered it and was planning to put\nCooling guns into production....\n\nDr. Charles Whitney is currently the president and chief stockholder of\nthe Cleveland Atomic Equipment Company, which designs and manufactures\nspecial tools and equipment for nuclear power companies, radiation labs\nand universities throughout the Midwest. He started the business after\nhis dismissal from the AEC and built it up gradually over the ensuing\nten years. We have some of his tools at Webster Tech.\n\nThen, too, Whitney and I had maintained a cursory, but friendly contact\nthrough the years, so naturally I thought of him first. He had the\nproduction layout for the job; what's more, he had the guts to go\nthrough with it. All I had to do was sell him on it.\n\nUnfortunately, by then I was scared silly. I was the furtive, sneaky\nlittle man whose invention would change the world. I contacted Dr.\nWhitney with a simple televisor call--but instead of suggesting a\nperfectly normal appointment at his office, I had to swear him to\nsecrecy and arrange a clandestine meeting in the country! I wonder he\ndidn't consult an almanac to see if there wasn't a full moon that night.\n\nIn fact, I wonder that he came at all. It was pouring rain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt least six hours are still required to reach Indian Lake in dry\nweather, even allowing the Federal Freeway's 125 mph speed limit.\nOnce through the Columbus Turnoff, you have to double back westward\nand northward through a hilly, rural country with twisting county\nroads. You must have excellent driving ability to average more than 30\nmph--and it won't be much more--over that maze of roads. When they're\nwet, you need driving ability just to stay on them.\n\nI'd worked late the night before, arranging my material for this\nmeeting, and didn't arise until noon. One glance at the sky's heavy\novercast told me what to expect. The weather reports confirmed it.\n\nThe world proceeded about its own business, of course, thoroughly\nindifferent to a worried man eating his belated breakfast. I was\nso completely _alone_! If I felt any sense of foreboding, stuffing\narticles into my pockets, picking up the guinea pigs' case and going\nout to the car, I couldn't distinguish it from my feeling of gloom.\nPerhaps I did, since the world's affairs caught up with me quite\nforcibly that night.\n\nI met the rain before I was halfway up the Freeway and had to cut\nspeed clear down to 85.\n\nThe old hotel on Indian Lake was my natural choice for a rendezvous,\nsince it was a gutted ruin in abandoned backwoods--though \"abandoned\"\nisn't exactly true. Local residents still fish the lake and there are a\nfew homes around the shore area.\n\nStrictly speaking, the region has simply changed with the times. Today,\nyou can't get past the toll-gate onto a Federal Freeway unless you have\na Federal Driver's License and your Vehicle Inspection sticker is up\nto date--which changed more things, I think, than nuclear power and\nindustrial automation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen people suddenly couldn't drive across the country in any junkheap\nwith a nut at the wheel, it became a mark of distinction just to _live_\nin the country. That's what made more rural jobs--the small community\nshopping centers springing up, products having to be shipped out to\nthem, the growth of rural power and water systems--when work in the\ncities got scarce, with automation taking over the factories.\n\nBut it hit the small resort areas especially hard. More people are\nvacationing in the cities now than at the seashore or mountains!\n\nI hadn't been out to the lake in years, but I had less trouble finding\nmy way this time than ever before. The influx of new home-builders has\nconsiderably improved the road signs around there, both in number and\naccuracy, and that's all you need in a Porsche Apache. My little blue\nspeedster takes those narrow, rain-slicked county roads like a Skid Row\nbum making the saloon circuit with a brand new ten-dollar bill. The\nonly real problem is getting around those armor-sided Detroit mastodons\nthat can't decide which end is the front.\n\nAnyway, driving kept me too busy to think much of anything else. But\nI made good time--better than I expected--and it wasn't long after\ndark when my headlights cut through the sheeting rain to pick out the\nfire-blackened ruin of the hotel.\n\nI jounced the little Porsche around the deep-rutted drive and parked\nnext to the empty frame building that had once been the restaurant and\nbar.\n\nI had plenty of time to think, for Dr. Whitney didn't arrive until two\nhours later.\n\nIt was sometime during those two hours that the Claggett gang smashed\ntheir way through a police roadblock just outside Lima, their guns\nblasting reply to the machine-gun bullets peppering their big sedan.\nTwo policemen were seriously wounded; one died on the way to the\nhospital.\n\nShortly afterward, the bullet-riddled sedan was found by the roadside,\nbut only one of the gang was in it. He was dead.\n\nAnd some time later, a call aroused Sgt. Falasca from a sound sleep.\nHe didn't even take time to don his State Police uniform, but merely\npulled a trenchcoat on over his pajamas, got his revolver out of the\nbureau drawer, and kissed his wife on the way out the front door. He\nhad three other State Troopers to pick up, off-duty as he was, before\nproceeding to the assembly point at Lima.\n\nThe Claggett gang had split up, some of them probably wounded, each of\nthem armed and more dangerous than ever. They were wanted for murder\nnow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Whitney made the trip by helicopter, of course--the head of a\nscientific instrument company must keep up appearances. He'd waited as\nlong as he could, hoping the weather might clear, then had taken off on\ninstruments and reached the lake by ADF gridmap. He settled to the lake\nsurface and crept in to shore, his landing lights probing the thick\ncurtains of rain.\n\nI heard the hollow roar of his turbine, rather than the throb of his\nrotor blades, and hurried around the slanting wing of the old hotel\nto meet him. The lakefront presented a macabre view that wrenched at\nmy memory. The desolate, cracked-stucco walls with the black holes of\ntheir windows rising from mounds of rubble beside me, a weed-grown lawn\nand a straggle of trees half-masking the lake--stark-looking trees now,\nin the 'copter's landing lights--and a small boat-dock leaning half\ninto the black water.\n\nOnce, as a rather obnoxious young high-school student, I had seen\nthis lakefront on just such a night. A steady rain fell, lightning\nflickered, and thunder blasted its anger ... and, for a moment, I saw\nit as it had been, with that grand old British pioneer of space flight,\nArthur C. Clarke, standing out there in the pelting rain with his\ncamera, taking pictures of the lightning!\n\nDr. Whitney brought his sleek craft over the treetops and settled\nneatly into the small space that remained of the lawn, his rotor tips\nalmost nicking the crumbled walls of the hotel. It was a plexi-nosed,\nthree-place executive ship--a Bell, I think. A lot of people prefer\nflying. They must fly specific air routes and airfield traffic\npatterns; and with airfields so crowded, they have trouble finding a\nplace to park. It's not for me.\n\nBut Dr. Whitney had heard the newscasts on the way out. I don't recall\nwhat was said at our meeting. It was rather uncomfortable, under the\ncircumstances--the more so for me, I think, as those circumstances were\nmy own making. But when we'd rounded the hotel and entered the old\nrestaurant-bar, I recall Whitney's jocular approval.\n\n\"Well, we're cozy enough here,\" he said. \"So long as the Claggett gang\ndoesn't drop in on us!\"\n\nThat was how I heard of the night's happenings. When he saw that his\nremark puzzled me, he related the news while I was setting things up\nfor our conference. We were in the back room, which had once been the\nbar--the front section, formerly the restaurant, had had windows all\naround, which now formed an unbroken gap with a chill wind whistling\nthrough it. The place was stripped bare of its former fixtures, but\nsome unsung fisherman had provided the old barroom with a rickety table\nand several pressed-board boxes to sit on. I had a Coleman radiant heat\nlantern which I swung from a ceiling wire hook, a plastic sheet which\nI threw across the table, and a couple of patio chair cushions for the\nboxes.\n\nIt took some shifting about to get everything out of the way of several\nroof leaks, and I had to choose a sturdy box for myself, first testing\na few.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI can well imagine the thoughts and emotions struggling through Dr.\nWhitney's mind then, but he showed none of them. It was I, rather, with\nmy clumsy movements, the pauses to polish my glasses, the lump I kept\ntrying to swallow, who took so long to face up to it.\n\nBut finally we were ready. I took out my notebook and opened it upon\nthe table before me. Whitney's frosty eyebrows raised. Then he quietly\nreached inside his own topcoat, produced his notebook and pen, and laid\nthe notebook open before him. It was a gesture of an almost-forgotten\npast, but a habit neither of us had ever abandoned. Something about\nit--the reminder of countless AEC conferences we had both attended--had\na steadying effect on me.\n\nI placed my pistol in the center of the table. The guinea pigs' cage\nwas on the floor before us. I told what I had to tell.\n\nThen I went to the cage, removed one of the animals and tucked it into\nmy pocket. Returning to the table, I picked up the pistol and fired at\nthe cage. The shrill E flat note pierced the rushing sound of the rain.\n\nWhitney rose and went to the cage. Gently removing the little\ncreature, he felt it a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Asleep,\" he said, and replaced it in the cage.\n\nLooking over my notes, I see that considerable space would be required\nto cover the entire interrogation which followed. Also, I see that\nI failed to note down the almost gradual change in my old friend's\ndemeanor--from his calm, quiet manner at first to the keen-eyed\nexcitement of his flushed features, his rapid-fire questions at the end.\n\nI shall, instead, give some examples of that discussion.\n\n\"The guinea pigs sleep for only a half-hour? Always a half-hour?\"\n\n\"Yes. It never varies much. A minute or so each way.\"\n\n\"If you--uh--shoot one, then shoot it again, does that prolong its\nsleep any?\"\n\n\"Not at all! Still only a half-hour, no matter how many times you shoot\nthem while they sleep.\"\n\n\"Ummm. That could indicate sleep is the brain's defense mechanism\nagainst the effects of your ray. A successful defense, it would seem.\nThey show _no_ after-effects of this?\"\n\n\"None whatever. They've begun to associate it with the pistol, though.\nEach time I point the pistol at them, they get mad--\"\n\n\"You mean angry? They aren't _afraid_ of it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not afraid! One in my pocket here tries burrowing into\ncorners, making furious grunting sounds. The other one usually just\nstands and glares at me.\"\n\n\"How about when they wake up?\"\n\n\"Well, generally, their first reaction is to keep a sharp eye out for\nme--and the pistol.\"\n\n\"Wary, eh? Damned inconvenient, I suppose, getting knocked asleep all\nthe time. But it certainly doesn't seem to hurt them. What about mental\ndisturbance?\"\n\n\"No obvious aberrations. But I don't know--\"\n\n\"Yes, they're only guinea pigs. Hardly be satisfactory to the American\nMedical Association, among others. Take years of research to determine\nits absolute safety--\"\n\n\"But it should be released to the public now!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because its harmful effects, if any, are very likely to be\ninsignificant--or we'd have no doubts about their existence.\"\n\n\"That assumption _could_ be dangerous.\"\n\n\"Yes. But there's something else, too. This new weapon will replace\nfirearms--which certainly _do_ inflict injury, even death.\"\n\n\"Ah, society's application of it--\" And Dr. Whitney took several\nminutes to digest that aspect.\n\nI outlined my plans to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was incredulous at first, then frankly aghast. \"You expect me to\n_mass-produce_ that thing?\"\n\nI said I hoped he would.\n\nHe then commenced raking me over the coals in a most fitting and proper\nmanner. Didn't I realize what I had created? My visions of it freeing\npeoples from police-state enslavement were all fine and good, and it\nmight conceivably have such result; but what I had here was nothing\nmore than _the most fiendish instrument ever inflicted upon human\nsociety_!\n\nWhat did I think it might do in the hands of muggers, sex offenders,\npickpockets, burglars or worse? Why, our whole civilized culture would\nbe thrown into chaos! No person would dare ever be alone, for fear of\nambush. No one could sleep without someone else standing watch! No man\ncould defend his own possessions, no woman could keep her chastity,\nunless people were around them, watching them _every moment of their\nlives_!\n\nGoods could no longer be transported without heavy guard. The\nwealthy--who could afford it--would have to live in massive,\nwell-guarded fortresses. The rest of us would be like the feudal\nserf, with nothing worth stealing and quite accustomed to having his\ndaughters raped. _We'd be thrown back into the Dark Ages!_\n\nI nodded agreement to everything he said.\n\nThen I took the guinea pig from my pocket, held it squirming, and\nfastened a little collar about its neck. I unwound a wire from the\nplastic disc on the collar so Dr. Whitney could see it. He instantly\nrecognized the tiny node on the wire as a miniature microphone.\n\n\"Remember how you determined that the other pig was asleep?\" I asked.\nI taped the tiny node to the artery on the pig's neck, carried it\nover to the cage, and placed it inside. \"I call this my 'Hey, Rube!'\"\nI explained, grinning. \"But imagine it as a little wrist radio\ntransmitter, worn by everyone who requests them, tuned to the police\nbroadcast frequency. Radio DF could pinpoint the location in seconds.\"\n\nGoing back to the table, I picked up the pistol. \"This one's just for\ndemonstration,\" I added, and fired at the cage.\n\nAs the guinea pig slumped beside its companion, the disc on its collar\nemitted a harsh, buzzing noise.\n\nWhitney chuckled. \"Slowed heartbeat, eh? Simple as that!\"\n\n\"And better than any burglar alarm,\" I pointed out. \"This one needn't\nsit still while some crook disconnects it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pointed out, of course, that this might destroy its usefulness to\npeople in a police-state. The dictator's police and troops could wear\n\"Hey, Rube!\" radios, too. I replied that all the people's underground\nfighters would need is a Cooling pistol and a saw-edged meat knife.\nOne man could knock over a whole platoon and cut their heel-tendons in\nminutes. \"The American Indians used to collect scalps in less time!\" I\nsaid. \"But a wounded man's more trouble to the enemy than a dead one. I\nthink the heel-tendon would be easiest.\"\n\nPerhaps it was a bit out of character for me. Whitney looked at me for\na long moment, and blinked. Both eyes, tight.\n\nBut still he didn't think much of my plans.\n\nHis subsequent suggestions were far more rational, however, than the\nones I had evolved through fear.\n\nFirst, we didn't really know the Armed Forces _would_ suppress this\ngun. They were completely involved in their problems of space flight\nand military satellites; there probably wasn't anyone left in\nWashington who was even looking for secret weapons now. And we just\nmight get this gun through while they weren't looking.\n\nHe suggested, therefore, that I attempt to patent my invention. But\nthat we should take adequate safeguards: I must handle all patent\ncorrespondence through his office. Then, if the Armed Forces clamped\ndown, they'd come there first--and he could tip me off in time to\nescape. I'd have to flee the country. But at least I'd be free and we\ncould adopt other measures for bringing out the gun.\n\nIt would be pointless now to disclose what other plans and arrangements\nwe made. It's enough to say I agreed. The discussion then turned to\nfurther speculation of what the future might be with the Cooling gun.\n\nWhitney was not at all convinced it would be good, but, rather, that\nneither we nor any group of men had the right to decide what humanity\nshould or should not do.\n\nHe had strong doubts that it would mean the end of dictatorship.\n\"Dictators dream world conquest, and dreams like that breed war,\" he\nsaid. \"But they aren't the only ones to blame. You'll find people who\n_like_ dictatorships!\"\n\nBut the truth was that most of humanity didn't want to get involved,\nnever realizing that that involved them more than anything else could.\n\nIt was at approximately this time, so far as I can determine, that Big\nJake Claggett and one of his henchmen walked up to a service station\nwhere a Porsche speedster was getting gas. They clubbed the station\nattendant unconscious, hauled the driver out of the little sports car\nand took off in it.\n\nDr. Whitney left me with a problem. What could be done to keep people\nalert? It is this one thing that will determine the Cooling gun's\neffect on the world--whether as an instrument of crime or protection\nfor the weak, the innocent.\n\nWhere people are complacent, it will be a boon to thieves and\nrevolutionaries.\n\nWhere people are alert--\n\nBut what could keep us alert?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDriving back, I was preoccupied, hardly conscious of the little car's\ndeft progress over the slick roads. It was almost with a feeling of\ndetached interest that I saw the black skid-marks at the bottom of the\nhill--then, with chill shock, the dark bulk of the sedan on its side in\nthe ditch.\n\nI was slowing when a flashlight beam raked outward from the car,\nshowing crumpled metal and broken headlights. One figure, perhaps\ntwo, were standing behind it. Another one, a man in a trenchcoat,\nmud-splattered almost to his hips, was walking onto the road in front\nof me, flagging me down.\n\n\"Get out of that car!\"\n\nThere were exasperation and rage in his voice, an expression of utter\nfury on his face. He stood just at the edge of my headlights' glare,\nnot directly in it, with his hands thrust deep in his pockets.\n\nThere was that. There was the speed of the sedan, as evidenced by\nits skid-marks. My mind leaped instantly to one nerve-shattering\nconclusion--\n\nAnd I felt absolutely calm. I can't explain that. It may have been that\nthe night's events had already drained me of tense emotion.\n\n_They're armed_, I thought, _but so am I! And I have a weapon that can\nget them all with one sweep--_\n\nThis, while I opened the door and climbed out. While I thrust my hand\ninto my own pocket.\n\nI whipped out the little pistol.\n\nOne instant, he was standing still, hands thrust in the wet\ntrenchcoat. The next, a heavy revolver exploded at his hip. A\nsledgehammer caught me in the right side, knocked me reeling.\n\nIt occurred to me then, lying there on the road, cold rain pelting my\nface, a warm wetness spreading along my side. I had met the one pitfall\nwe shall never escape in a pistol-packing society: the man who's faster\nwith a gun than you are!\n\nBending over me, Sgt. Nicolas Falasca picked up the little plastic\nCooling gun and straightened up, peering at it, scowling. \"What the\nhell!\" he muttered.\n\nI was rather inclined to agree.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNaturally, this had to be told. The State of Ohio wants Cooling guns\nfor its police officers; after this, other States will undoubtedly\nfollow suit. The Armed Forces don't want to suppress it. And Dr.\nWhitney will start production in just another week.\n\nThey've been very decent about paying my hospital bills and seeing that\nnothing else happens to me.\n\nEven though Sgt. Falasca was saddled with the latter responsibility, I\nmust repeat that he's treated me very well. The future will depend a\nlot on men like him.\n\nAs for the rest--I've been assured that the guinea pigs were honorably\nretired to the breeding farm; Nurse wouldn't let me keep them here.\nEveryone knows of the violent end of the Claggett gang.\n\nI want to state vigorously at this point that, despite widespread\npublic belief, neither I nor the Cooling gun had anything whatsoever to\ndo with it. I never at any time even saw Claggett or any member of his\ngang. Their unwitting contribution was the alerting of Sgt. Falasca and\nthe rest of the police, and, as I mentioned at the beginning of this\naccount, Claggett's stealing a Porsche like mine because he was fond of\nsports cars.\n\nThat's the whole of the story, except for one additional item:\n\nThis is scheduled to appear at the same time as the plans and\nspecifications for the Cooling gun. You'll find them given as premiums\nwith safety razors, breakfast cereals, cigarettes and other articles. I\nwish to thank the manufacturers for their kind cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Touch of E Flat, by Joe Gibson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A TOUCH OF E FLAT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51304.txt or 51304.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/0/51304/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
