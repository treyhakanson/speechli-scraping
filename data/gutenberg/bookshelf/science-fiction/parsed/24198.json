Extensive research did\n not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication\n was renewed.\n\n\n\n\n                             A SPACESHIP\n\n                                NAMED\n\n                               McGUIRE\n\n\n\n                                  By\n\n                           RANDALL GARRETT\n\n\n     _The basic trouble with McGuire was that, though \"he\" was a\n     robot spaceship, nevertheless \"he\" had a definite weakness\n     that a man might understand...._\n\n\n                        Illustrated by Douglas\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nNo. Nobody ever deliberately named a spaceship that. The staid and\nstolid minds that run the companies which design and build spaceships\nrarely let their minds run to fancy. The only example I can think of\nis the unsung hero of the last century who had puckish imagination\nenough to name the first atomic-powered submarine _Nautilus_. Such\nminds are rare. Most minds equate dignity with dullness.\n\nThis ship happened to have a magnetogravitic drive, which\nautomatically put it into the MG class. It also happened to be the\nfirst successful model to be equipped with a Yale robotic brain, so it\nwas given the designation MG-YR-7--the first six had had more bugs in\nthem than a Leopoldville tenement.\n\nSo somebody at Yale--another unsung hero--named the ship McGuire; it\nwasn't official, but it stuck.\n\nThe next step was to get someone to test-hop McGuire. They needed just\nthe right man--quick-minded, tough, imaginative, and a whole slew of\ncomplementary adjectives. They wanted a perfect superman to test pilot\ntheir baby, even if they knew they'd eventually have to take second\nbest.\n\nIt took the Yale Space Foundation a long time to pick the right man.\n\nNo, I'm not the guy who tested the McGuire.\n\nI'm the guy who stole it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShalimar Ravenhurst is not the kind of bloke that very many people can\nbring themselves to like, and, in this respect, I'm like a great many\npeople, if not more so. In the first place, a man has no right to go\naround toting a name like \"Shalimar\"; it makes names like \"Beverly\"\nand \"Leslie\" and \"Evelyn\" sound almost hairy chested. You want a dozen\nother reasons, you'll get them.\n\nShalimar Ravenhurst owned a little planetoid out in the Belt, a hunk\nof nickel-iron about the size of a smallish mountain with a gee-pull\nmeasurable in fractions of a centimeter per second squared. If you're\nsusceptible to spacesickness, that kind of gravity is about as much\nhelp as aspirin would have been to Marie Antoinette. You get the\nfeeling of a floor beneath you, but there's a distinct impression that\nit won't be there for long. It keeps trying to drop out from under\nyou.\n\nI dropped my flitterboat on the landing field and looked around\nwithout any hope of seeing anything. I didn't. The field was about the\nsize of a football field, a bright, shiny expanse of rough-polished\nmetal, carved and smoothed flat from the nickel-iron of the planetoid\nitself. It not only served as a landing field, but as a reflector\nbeacon, a mirror that flashed out the sun's reflection as the\nplanetoid turned slowly on its axis. I'd homed in on that beacon, and\nnow I was sitting on it.\n\nThere wasn't a soul in sight. Off to one end of the rectangular field\nwas a single dome, a hemisphere about twenty feet in diameter and half\nas high. Nothing else.\n\nI sighed and flipped on the magnetic anchor, which grabbed hold of the\nmetal beneath me and held the flitterboat tightly to the surface. Then\nI cut the drive, plugged in the telephone, and punched for \"Local.\"\n\nThe automatic finder searched around for the Ravenhurst tickler\nsignal, found it, and sent out a beep along the same channel.\n\nI waited while the thing beeped twice. There was a click, and a voice\nsaid: \"Raven's Rest. Yes?\" It wasn't Ravenhurst.\n\nI said: \"This is Daniel Oak. I want to talk to Mr. Ravenhurst.\"\n\n\"Mr. Oak? But you weren't expected until tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'm early. Let me talk to Ravenhurst.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Ravenhurst wasn't expecting you to--\"\n\nI got all-of-a-sudden exasperated. \"Unless your instruments are\nrunning on secondhand flashlight batteries, you've known I was coming\nfor the past half hour. I followed Ravenhurst's instructions not to\nuse radio, but he should know I'm here by this time. He told me to\ncome as fast as possible, and I followed those instructions, too. I\nalways follow instructions when I'm paid enough.\n\n\"Now, I'm here; tell Ravenhurst I want to talk to him, or I'll simply\nflit back to Eros, and thank him much for a pretty retainer that\ndidn't do him any good but gave me a nice profit for my trouble.\"\n\n\"One moment, please,\" said the voice.\n\nIt took about a minute and a half, which was about nine billion\njiffies too long, as far as I was concerned.\n\nThen another voice said: \"Oak? Wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.\"\n\n\"So I hear. I thought you were in a hurry, but if you're not, you can\njust provide me with wine, women, and other necessities until\ntomorrow. That's above and beyond my fee, of course, since you're\nwasting my time, and I'm evidently not wasting yours.\"\n\nI couldn't be sure whether the noise he made was a grunt or a muffled\nchuckle, and I didn't much care. \"Sorry, Oak; I really didn't expect\nyou so soon, but I do want to ... I want you to get started right\naway. Leave your flitterboat where it is; I'll have someone take care\nof it. Walk on over to the dome and come on in.\" And he cut off.\n\nI growled something I was glad he didn't hear and hung up. I wished\nthat I'd had a vision unit on the phone; I'd like to have seen his\nface. Although I knew I might not have learned much more from his\nexpression than I had from his voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got out of the flitterboat, and walked across the dome, my magnetic\nsoles making subdued clicking noises inside the suit as they caught\nand released the metallic plain beneath me. Beyond the field, I was\nsurrounded by a lumpy horizon and a black sky full of bright, hard\nstars.\n\nThe green light was on when I reached the door to the dome, so I\nopened it and went on in, closing it behind me. I flipped the toggle\nthat began flooding the room with air. When it was up to pressure, a\ntrap-door in the floor of the dome opened and a crew-cut, blond young\nman stuck his head up. \"Mr. Oak?\"\n\nI toyed, for an instant, with the idea of giving him a sarcastic\nanswer. Who else would it be? How many other visitors were running\naround on the surface of Raven's Rest?\n\nInstead, I said: \"That's right.\" My voice must have sounded pretty\nmuffled to him through my fishbowl.\n\n\"Come on down, Mr. Oak. You can shuck your vac suit below.\"\n\nI thought \"below\" was a pretty ambiguous term on a low-gee lump like\nthis, but I followed him down the ladder. The ladder was a necessity\nfor fast transportation; if I'd just tried to jump down from one floor\nto the next, it would've taken me until a month from next St.\nSwithin's Day to land.\n\nThe door overhead closed, and I could hear the pumps start cycling.\nThe warning light turned red.\n\nI took off my suit, hung it in a handy locker, showing that all I had\non underneath was my skin-tight \"union suit.\"\n\n\"All right if I wear this?\" I asked the blond young man, \"Or should I\nborrow a set of shorts and a jacket?\" Most places in the Belt, a union\nsuit is considered normal dress; a man never knows when he might have\nto climb into a vac suit--_fast_. But there are a few of the\nhoity-toity places on Eros and Ceres and a few of the other\nwell-settled places where a man or woman is required to put on shorts\nand jacket before entering. And in good old New York City, a man and\nwoman were locked up for \"indecent exposure\" a few months ago. The\njudge threw the case out of court, but he told them they were lucky\nthey hadn't been picked up in Boston. It seems that the eye of the\nbluenose turns a jaundiced yellow at the sight of a union suit, and he\nsees red.\n\nBut there were evidently no bluenoses here. \"Perfectly all right, Mr.\nOak,\" the blond young man said affably. Then he coughed politely and\nadded: \"But I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take off the gun.\"\n\nI glanced at the holster under my armpit, walked back over to the\nlocker, opened it, and took out my vac suit.\n\n\"Hey!\" said the blond young man. \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"Back to my boat,\" I said calmly. \"I'm getting tired of this runaround\nalready. I'm a professional man, not a hired flunky. If you'd called a\ndoctor, you wouldn't tell him to leave his little black bag behind; if\nyou'd called a lawyer, you wouldn't make him check his brief case. Or,\nif you did, he'd tell you to drop dead.\n\n\"I was asked to come here as fast as possible, and when I do, I'm told\nto wait till tomorrow. Now you want me to check my gun. The hell with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Merely a safety precaution,\" said the blond young man worriedly.\n\n\"You think I'm going to shoot Ravenhurst, maybe? Don't be an idiot.\" I\nstarted climbing into my vac suit.\n\n\"Just a minute, please, Mr. Oak,\" said a voice from a hidden speaker.\nIt was Ravenhurst, and he actually sounded apologetic. \"You mustn't\nblame Mr. Feller; those are my standing orders, and I failed to tell\nMr. Feller to make an exception in your case. The error was mine.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I wasn't blaming Mr. Feller. I wasn't even talking\nto him. I was addressing you.\"\n\n\"I believe you. Mr. Feller, our guest has gone to all the trouble of\nhaving a suit made with a space under the arm for that gun; I see no\nreason to make him remove it.\" A pause. \"Again, Mr. Oak, I apologize.\nI really want you to take this job.\"\n\nI was already taking off the vac suit again.\n\n\"But,\" Ravenhurst continued smoothly, \"if I fail to live up to your\nideas of courtesy again, I hope you'll forgive me in advance. I'm\nsometimes very forgetful, and I don't like it when a man threatens to\nleave my employ twice in the space of fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"I'm not in your employ yet, Ravenhurst,\" I said. \"If I accept the\njob, I won't threaten to quit again unless I mean to carry it through,\nand it would take a lot more than common discourtesy to make me do\nthat. On the other hand, your brand of discourtesy is a shade above\nthe common.\"\n\n\"I thank you for that, at least,\" said Ravenhurst. \"Show him to my\noffice, Mr. Feller.\"\n\nThe blond young man nodded wordlessly and led me from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalking under low-gee conditions is like nothing else in this\nuniverse. I don't mean trotting around on Luna; one-sixth gee is\npractically homelike in comparison. And zero gee is so devoid of\norientation that it gives the sensation of falling endlessly until you\nget used to it. But a planetoid is in a different class altogether.\n\nRemember that dream--almost everybody's had it--where you're suddenly\nable to fly? It isn't flying exactly; it's a sort of swimming in the\nair. Like being underwater, except that the medium around you isn't so\ndense and viscous, and you can breathe. Remember? Well, that's the\nfeeling you get on a low-gee planetoid.\n\nYour arms don't tend to hang at your sides, as they do on Earth or\nLuna, because the muscular tension tends to hold them out, just as it\ndoes in zero-gee, but there is still a definite sensation of\nup-and-down. If you push yourself off the floor, you tend to float in\na long, slow, graceful arc, provided you don't push too hard. Magnetic\nsoles are practically a must.\n\nI followed the blond Mr. Feller down a series of long corridors which\nhad been painted a pale green, which gave me the feeling that I was\nunderwater. There were doors spaced at intervals along the corridor\nwalls. Occasionally one of them would open and a busy looking man\nwould cross the corridor, open another door, and disappear. From\nbehind the doors, I could hear the drum of distant sounds.\n\nWe finally ended up in front of what looked like the only wooden door\nin the place. When you're carving an office and residence out of a\nnickel-iron planetoid, importing wood from Earth is a purely luxury\nmatter.\n\nThere was no name plate on that mahogany-red door; there didn't need\nto be.\n\nFeller touched a thin-lined circle in the door jamb.\n\n\"You don't knock?\" I asked with mock seriousness.\n\n\"No,\" said Feller, with a straight face. \"I have to signal. Knocking\nwouldn't do any good. That's just wood veneer over a three-inch-thick\nsteel slab.\"\n\nThe door opened and I stepped inside.\n\nI have never seen a room quite like it. The furniture was all that\nsame mahogany--a huge desk, nineteenth century baroque, with carved\nand curlicued legs; two chairs carved the same, with padded seats of\nmaroon leather; and a chair behind the desk that might have doubled as\na bishop's throne, with even fancier carving. Off to one side was a\nlong couch upholstered in a lighter maroon. The wall-to-wall carpeting\nwas a rich Burgundy, with a pile deep enough to run a reaper through.\nThe walls were paneled with mahogany and hung with a couple of huge\ntapestries done in maroon, purple, and red. A bookcase along one wall\nwas filled with books, every one of which had been rebound in maroon\nleather.\n\nIt was like walking into a cask of old claret. Or old blood.\n\nThe man sitting behind the desk looked as though he'd been built to be\nthe lightest spot in an analogous color scheme. His suit was mauve\nwith purple piping, and his wide, square, saggy face was florid. On\nhis nose and cheeks, tiny lines of purple tracing made darker areas in\nhis skin. His hair was a medium brown, but it was clipped so short\nthat the scalp showed faintly through, and amid all that overwhelming\nbackground, even the hair looked vaguely violet.\n\n\"Come in, Mr. Oak,\" said Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n\nI walked toward him across the Burgundy carpet while the blond young\nman discreetly closed the door behind me, leaving us alone. I didn't\nblame him. I was wearing a yellow union suit, and I hate to think what\nI must have looked like in that room.\n\nI sat down in one of the chairs facing the desk after giving a brief\nshake to a thick-fingered, well-manicured, slightly oily hand.\n\nHe opened a crystal decanter that stood on one end of the desk. \"Have\nsome Madeira, Mr. Oak? Or would you like something else? I never drink\nspirits at this time of night.\"\n\nI fought down an impulse to ask for a shot of redeye. \"The Madeira\nwill be fine, Mr. Ravenhurst.\"\n\nHe poured and handed me a stemmed glass nearly brimming with the wine.\nI joined him in an appreciative sip, then waited while he made up his\nmind to talk.\n\nHe leaned across the desk, looking at me with his small, dark eyes. He\nhad an expression on his face that looked as if it were trying to\nsneer and leer at the same time but couldn't get much beyond the\nsmirk stage.\n\n\"Mr. Oak, I have investigated you thoroughly--as thoroughly as it can\nbe done, at least. My attorneys say that your reputation is A-one;\nthat you get things done and rarely disappoint a client.\"\n\nHe paused as if waiting for a comment. I gave him nothing.\n\nAfter a moment, he went on. \"I hope that's true, Mr. Oak, because I'm\ngoing to have to trust you.\" He leaned back in his chair again, his\neyes still on me. \"Men very rarely like me, Mr. Oak. I am not a\nlikable man. I do not pretend to be. That's not my function.\" He said\nit as if he had said it many times before, believed it, and wished it\nwasn't so.\n\n\"I do not ask that you like me,\" he continued. \"I only ask that you be\nloyal to my interests for the duration of this assignment.\" Another\npause. \"I have been assured by others that this will be so. I would\nlike your assurance.\"\n\n\"If I take the assignment, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I told him, \"I'll be\nworking for _you_. I can be bought, but once I'm bought I stay bought.\n\n\"Now, what seems to be your trouble?\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Well, now, let's get one thing settled: Are you working\nfor me, or not?\"\n\n\"I won't know that until I find out what the job is.\"\n\nHis frown deepened. \"Now, see here; this is very confidential work.\nWhat happens if I tell you and you decide not to work for me?\"\n\nI sighed. \"Ravenhurst, right now, you're paying me to listen to you.\nEven if I don't take your job, I'm going to bill you for expenses and\ntime to come all the way out here. So, as far as listening is\nconcerned, I'm working for you now. If I don't like the job, I'll\nstill forget everything I'm told. All right?\"\n\nHe didn't like it, but he had no choice. \"All right,\" he said. He\npolished off his glass of Madeira and refilled it. My own glass was\nstill nearly full.\n\n\"Mr. Oak,\" he began, \"I have two problems. One is minor, the other\nmajor. But I have attempted to blow the minor problem up out of\nproportion, so that all the people here at Raven's Rest think that it\nis the only problem. They think that I brought you out here for that\nreason alone.\n\n\"But all that is merely cover-up for the real problem.\"\n\n\"Which is?\" I prompted.\n\nHe leaned forward again. Apparently, it was the only exercise he ever\ngot. \"You're aware that Viking Spacecraft is one of the corporations\nunder the management of Ravenhurst Holdings?\"\n\nI nodded. Viking Spacecraft built some of the biggest and best\nspacecraft in the System. It held most of Ceres--all of it, in fact,\nexcept the Government Reservation. It had moved out to the asteroids a\nlong time back, after the big mining concerns began cutting up the\nsmaller asteroids for metal. The raw materials are easier to come by\nout here than they are on Earth, and it's a devil of a lot easier to\nbuild spacecraft under low-gee conditions than it is under the pull of\nEarth or Luna or Mars.\n\n\"Do you know anything about the experimental robotic ships being built\non Eros?\" Ravenhurst asked.\n\n\"Not much,\" I admitted. \"I've heard about them, but I don't know any\nof the details.\" That wasn't quite true, but I've found it doesn't pay\nto tell everybody everything you know.\n\n\"The engineering details aren't necessary,\" Ravenhurst said. \"Besides,\nI don't know them, myself. The point is that Viking is trying to build\na ship that will be as easy to operate as a flitterboat--a one-man\ncargo vessel. Perhaps even a completely automatic job for cargo, and\njust use a one-man crew for the passenger vessels. Imagine how that\nwould cut the cost of transportation in the Solar System! Imagine how\nit would open up high-speed cargo transfer if an automatic vessel\ncould accelerate at twenty or twenty-five gees to turnover!\"\n\nI'll give Ravenhurst this: He had a light in his eyes that showed a\nreal excitement about the prospect he was discussing, and it wasn't\ndue entirely to the money he might make.\n\n\"Sounds fine,\" I said. \"What seems to be the trouble?\"\n\nHis face darkened half a shade. \"The company police suspect sabotage,\nMr. Oak.\"\n\n\"How? What kind?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"They don't know. Viking has built six ships of that type--the McGuire\nclass, the engineers call it. Each one has been slightly different\nthan the one before, of course, as they ironed out the bugs in their\noperation. But each one has been a failure. Not one of them would pass\nthe test for space-worthiness.\"\n\n\"Not a failure of the drive or the ordinary mechanisms of the ship, I\ntake it?\"\n\nRavenhurst sniffed. \"Of course not. The brain. The ships became, as\nyou might say, _non compos mentis_. As a matter of fact, when the last\none simply tried to burrow into the surface of Eros by reversing its\ndrive, one of the roboticists said that a coroner's jury would have\nreturned a verdict of 'suicide while of unsound mind' if there were\ninquests held for spaceships.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make much sense,\" I said.\n\n\"No. It doesn't. It isn't sensible. Those ships' brains shouldn't have\nbehaved that way. Robot brains don't go mad unless they're given\ninstructions to do so--conflicting orders, erroneous information, that\nsort of thing. Or, unless they have actual physical defects in the\nbrains themselves.\"\n\n\"The brains can handle the job of flying a ship all right, though?\" I\nasked. \"I mean, they have the capacity for it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They're the same type that's used to control the\nautomobile traffic on the Eastern Seaboard Highway Network of North\nAmerica. If they can control the movement of millions of cars, there's\nno reason why they can't control a spaceship.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I suppose not.\" I thought it over for a second, then\nasked, \"But what do your robotics men say is causing the\nmalfunctions?\"\n\n\"That's where the problem comes in, Mr. Oak.\" He pursed his pudgy\nlips, and his eyes narrowed. \"The opinions are divided. Some of the\nmen say it's simply a case of engineering failure--that the bugs\nhaven't been worked out of this new combination, but that as soon as\nthey are, everything will work as smoothly as butter. Others say that\nonly deliberate tampering could cause those failures. And still others\nsay that there's not enough evidence to prove either of those theories\nis correct.\"\n\n\"But your opinion is that it's sabotage?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Ravenhurst, \"and I know who is doing it and why.\"\n\nI didn't try to conceal the little bit of surprise that gave me. \"You\nknow the man who's responsible?\"\n\nHe shook his head rapidly, making his jowls wobble. \"I didn't mean\nthat. It's not a single man; it's a group.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd better go into a little more detail on that, Mr.\nRavenhurst.\"\n\nHe nodded, and this time his jowls bobbled instead of wobbled. \"Some\ngroup at Viking is trying to run me out of the managerial business.\nThey want Viking to be managed by Thurston Enterprises; they evidently\nthink they can get a better deal from him than they can from me. If\nthe McGuire project fails, they'll have a good chance of convincing\nthe stock-holders that the fault lies with Ravenhurst. You follow?\"\n\n\"So far,\" I said. \"Do you think Thurston's behind this, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said slowly. \"He might be, or he might not. If he\nis, that's perfectly legitimate business tactics. He's got a perfect\nright to try to get more business for himself if he wants to. I've\nundercut him a couple of times.\n\n\"But I don't think he's too deeply involved, if he's involved at all.\nThis smacks of a personal attack against me, and I don't think that's\nThurston's type of play.\n\n\"You see, things are a little touchy right now. I won't go into\ndetails, but you know what the political situation is at the moment.\n\n\"It works this way, as far as Viking is concerned: If I lose the\nmanagerial contract at Viking, a couple of my other contracts will go\nby the board, too--especially if it's proved that I've been lax in\nmanagement or have been expending credit needlessly.\n\n\"These other two companies are actually a little shaky at the moment;\nI've only been managing them for a little over a year in one case and\ntwo years in the other. Their assets have come up since I took over,\nbut they'd still dump me if they thought I was reckless.\"\n\n\"How can they do that?\" I asked. \"You have a contract, don't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They wouldn't break it. But they'd likely ask the\nGovernment Inspectors to step in and check every step of the\nmanagerial work. Now, you and I and everybody else knows that you have\nto cut corners to make a business successful. If the GI's step in,\nthat will have to stop--which means we'll show a loss heavy enough to\nput us out. We'll be forced to sell the contract for a pittance.\n\n\"Well, then. If Viking goes, and these other two corporations go,\nit'll begin to look as if Ravenhurst can't take care of himself and\nhis companies anymore. Others will climb on the bandwagon. Contracts\nthat are coming up for renewal will be reconsidered instead of\ncontinuing automatically. I think you can see where that would lead\neventually.\"\n\nI did. You don't go into the managing business these days unless you\nhave plenty on the ball. You've got to know all the principles and all\nthe tricks of organization and communication, and you've got to be\nable to waltz your way around all the roadblocks that are caused by\nGovernment laws--some of which have been floating around on the books\nof one nation or another for two or three centuries.\n\nDid you know that there's a law on the American statute books that\nforbids the landing of a spaceship within one hundred miles of a city?\nThat was passed back when they were using rockets, but it's never been\nrepealed. Technically, then, it's almost impossible to land a ship\nanywhere on the North American continent. Long Island Spaceport is\nopenly flouting the law, if you want to look at it that way.\n\nA managerial combine has to know all those little things and know how\nto get around them. It has to be able to have the confidence of the\nstock-holders of a corporation--if it's run on the Western Plan--or\nthe confidence of communal owners if it's run on the Eastern Plan.\n\nSomething like this could snowball on Ravenhurst. It isn't only the\nrats that desert a sinking ship; so does anyone else who has any\nsense.\n\n\"What I want to know, Mr. Oak,\" Ravenhurst continued, \"is who is\nbehind this plot, whether an individual or a group. I want to know\nidentity and motivation.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" I eyed him skeptically.\n\n\"No. Of course not. I want you to make sure that the MG-YR-7 isn't\nsabotaged. I want you to make sure it's protected from whatever kind\nof monkey wrenches are being thrown into its works.\"\n\n\"It's nearly ready for testing now, isn't it?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is ready. It seems to be in perfect condition so far. Viking is\nalready looking for a test pilot. It's still in working order now, and\nI want to be certain that it will remain so.\"\n\nI cocked my head to one side and gave him my Interrogative And\nSuspicious Glance--Number 9 in the manual. \"You didn't do any checking\non the first six McGuire ships. You wait until this one is done before\ncalling me. Why the delay, Ravenhurst?\"\n\nIt didn't faze him. \"I became suspicious after McGuire 6 failed. I put\nColonel Brock on it.\"\n\nI nodded. I'd had dealings with Brock. He was head of Ravenhurst's\nSecurity Guard. \"Brock didn't get anywhere,\" I said.\n\n\"He did not. His own face is too well known for him to have\ninvestigated personally, and he's not enough of an actor to get away\nwith using a plexiskin mask. He had to use underlings. And I'm afraid\nsome of them might be in the pay of the ... ah ... opposition. They\ngot nowhere.\"\n\n\"In other words, you may have spies in your own organization who are\nworking with the Viking group. Very interesting. That means they know\nI'm working for you, which will effectively seal me up, too. You might\nas well have kept Brock on the job.\"\n\nHe smiled in a smug, superior sort of way that some men might have\nresented. I did. Even though I'd fed him the line so that he could\nfeel superior, knowing that a smart operator like Ravenhurst would\nalready have covered his tracks. I couldn't help wishing I'd told him\nsimply to trot out his cover story instead of letting him think I\nbelieved it had never occurred to either of us before.\n\n\"As far as my staff knows, Mr. Oak, you are here to escort my\ndaughter, Jaqueline, to Braunsville, Luna. You will, naturally, have\nto take her to Ceres in your flitterboat, where you will wait for a\nspecially chartered ship to take you both to Luna. That will be a week\nafter you arrive. Since the McGuire 7 is to be tested within three\ndays, that should give you ample time.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't?\"\n\n\"We will consider that possibility if and when it becomes probable. I\nhave a great deal of faith in you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. One more thing: why do you think anybody will swallow the\nidea that your daughter needs a private bodyguard to escort her to\nBraunsville?\"\n\nHis smile broadened a little. \"You have not met my daughter, Mr. Oak.\nJaqueline takes after me in a great many respects, not the least of\nwhich is her desire to have things her own way and submit to no man's\nyoke, as the saying goes. I have had a difficult time with her, sir; a\ndifficult time. It is and has been a matter of steering a narrow\ncourse between the Scylla of breaking her spirit with too much\ndiscipline and the Charybdis of allowing her to ruin her life by\nletting her go hog wild. She is seventeen now, and the time has come\nto send her to a school where she will receive an education suitable\nto her potentialities and abilities, and discipline which will be\nsuitable to her spirit.\n\n\"Your job, Mr. Oak, will be to make sure she gets there. You are not a\nbodyguard in the sense that you must protect her from the people\naround her. Quite the contrary, _they_ may need protection from _her_.\nYou are to make sure she arrives in Braunsville on schedule. She is\nperfectly capable of taking it in her head to go scooting off to Earth\nif you turn your back on her.\"\n\nStill smiling, he refilled his glass. \"Do have some more Madeira, Mr.\nOak. It's really an excellent year.\"\n\nI let him refill my glass.\n\n\"That, I think, will cover your real activities well enough. My\ndaughter will, of course, take a tour of the plant on Ceres, which\nwill allow you to do whatever work is necessary.\"\n\nHe smiled at me.\n\nI didn't smile back.\n\n\"Up till now, this sounded like a pretty nice assignment,\" I said.\n\"But I don't want it now. I can't take care of a teenage girl with a\ndesire for the bright lights of Earth while I investigate a sabotage\ncase.\"\n\nI knew he had an out; I was just prodding him into springing it.\n\nHe did. \"Of course not. My daughter is not as scatterbrained as I have\npainted her. She is going to help you.\"\n\n\"_Help_ me?\"\n\n\"Exactly. You are ostensibly her bodyguard. If she turns up missing,\nyou will, of course, leave no stone unturned to find her.\" He\nchuckled. \"And Ceres is a fairly large stone.\"\n\nI thought it over. I still didn't like it too well, but if Jaqueline\nwasn't going to be too much trouble to take care of, it might work\nout. And if she did get to be too much trouble, I could see to it that\nshe was unofficially detained for a while.\n\n\"All right, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, \"you've got yourself a man for\nboth jobs.\"\n\n\"Both?\"\n\n\"I find out who is trying to sabotage the McGuire ship, and I baby-sit\nfor you. That's two jobs. And you're going to pay for both of them.\"\n\n\"I expected to,\" said Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n\nFifteen minutes later, I was walking into the room where I'd left my\nvac suit. There was a girl waiting for me.\n\nShe was already dressed in her vac suit, so there was no way to be sure,\nbut she looked as if she had a nice figure underneath the suit. Her face\nwas rather unexceptionally pretty, a sort of nice-girl-next-door face. Her\nhair was a reddish brown and was cut fairly close to the skull; only a\nwoman who never intends to be in a vac suit in free fall can afford to let\nher hair grow.\n\n\"Miss Ravenhurst?\" I asked.\n\nShe grinned and stuck out a hand. \"Just call me Jack. And I'll call\nyou Dan. O.K.?\"\n\nI grinned and shook her hand because there wasn't much else I could\ndo. Now I'd met the Ravenhursts: A father called Shalimar and a\ndaughter called Jack.\n\nAnd a spaceship named McGuire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI gave the flitterboat all the push it would take to get us to Ceres\nas fast as possible. I don't like riding in the things. You sit there\ninside a transite hull, which has two bucket seats inside it, fore and\naft, astraddle the drive tube, and you guide from one beacon to the\nnext while you keep tabs on orbital positions by radio. It's a long\njump from one rock to the next, even in the asteroid belt, and you\nhave to live inside your vac suit until you come to a stopping place\nwhere you can spend an hour or so resting before you go on. It's like\ndriving cross-continent in an automobile, except that the signposts\nand landmarks are constantly shifting position. An inexperienced man\ncan get lost easily in the Belt.\n\nI was happy to find that Jack Ravenhurst knew how to handle a\nflitterboat and could sight navigate by the stars. That meant that I\ncould sleep while she piloted and vice-versa. The trip back was a lot\neasier and faster than the trip out had been.\n\nI was glad, in a way, that Ceres was within flitterboat range of\nRaven's Rest. I don't like the time wasted in waiting for a regular\nspaceship, which you have to do when your target is a quarter of the\nway around the Belt from you. The cross-system jumps don't take long,\nbut getting to a ship takes time.\n\nThe Ravenhurst girl wasn't much of a talker while we were en route. A\nlittle general chitchat once in a while, then she'd clam up to do a\nlittle mental orbit figuring. I didn't mind. I was in no mood to pump\nher just yet, and I was usually figuring orbits myself. You get in the\nhabit after a while.\n\nWhen the Ceres beacon came into view, I was snoozing. Jack reached\nforward and shook my shoulder. \"Decelerating toward Ceres,\" she said.\n\"Want to take over from here on?\" Her voice sounded tinny and tired in\nthe earphones of my fishbowl.\n\n\"O.K.; I'll take her in. Have you called Ceres Field yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I figured that you'd better do that, since it's your\nflitterboat.\"\n\nI said O.K. and called Ceres. They gave me a traffic orbit, and I\nfollowed it in to Ceres Field.\n\nIt was a lot bigger than the postage-stamp field on Raven's Rest, and\nmore brightly lit, and a lot busier, but it was basically the same\nidea--a broad, wide, smooth area that had been carved out of the\nsurface of the nickel-iron with a focused sun beam. One end of it was\nreserved for flitterboats; three big spaceships sat on the other end,\nlooking very _noblesse oblige_ at the little flitterboats.\n\nI clamped down, gave the key to one of the men behind the desk after\nwe had gone below, and turned to Jack. \"I suggest we go to the hotel\nfirst and get a shower and a little rest. We can go out to Viking\ntomorrow.\"\n\nShe glanced at her watch. Like every other watch and clock in the\nBelt, it was set for Greenwich Standard Time. What's the point in\nhaving time zones in space?\n\n\"I'm not tired,\" she said brightly. \"I got plenty of sleep while we\nwere on the way. Why don't we go out tonight? They've got a\nbounce-dance place called _Bali_'s that--\"\n\nI held up a hand. \"No. You may not be tired, but I am. Remember, I\nwent all the way out there by myself, and then came right back.\n\n\"I need at least six hours sleep in a nice, comfortable bed before\nI'll be able to move again.\"\n\nThe look she gave me made me feel every one of my thirty-five years,\nbut I didn't intend to let her go roaming around at this stage of the\ngame.\n\nInstead, I put her aboard one of the little rail cars, and we headed\nfor the Viking Arms, generally considered the best hotel on Ceres.\n\nCeres has a pretty respectable gee pull for a planetoid: Three per\ncent of Standard. I weigh a good, hefty five pounds on the surface.\nThat makes it a lot easier to walk around on Ceres than on, say,\nRaven's Rest. Even so, you always get the impression that one of the\nlittle rail cars that scoots along the corridors is climbing uphill\nall the way, because the acceleration is greater than any measly\nthirty centimeters per second squared.\n\nJack didn't say another word until we reached the Viking, where\nRavenhurst had thoughtfully made reservations for adjoining rooms.\nThen, after we'd registered, she said: \"We could at least get\nsomething to eat.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea. We can get something to line our stomachs,\nanyway. Steak?\"\n\nShe beamed up at me. \"Steak. Sounds wonderful after all those mushy\nconcentrates. Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe restaurant off the lobby was just like the lobby and the corridors\noutside--a big room hollowed out of the metal of the asteroid. The\nwalls had been painted to prevent rusting, but they still bore the\nroughness left by the sun beam that had burnt them out.\n\nWe sat down at a table, and a waiter brought over a menu. The place\nwouldn't be classed higher than a third-rate cafe on Earth, but on\nCeres it's considered one of the better places. The prices certainly\ncompare well with those of the best New York or Moscow restaurants,\nand the price of meat, which has to be shipped from Earth, is--you\nshould pardon the gag--astronomical.\n\nThat didn't bother me. Steaks for two would go right on the expense\naccount. I mentally thanked Mr. Ravenhurst for the fine slab of beef\nwhen the waiter finally brought it.\n\nWhile we were waiting, though, I lit a cigarette and said: \"You're\nawfully quiet, Jack.\"\n\n\"Am I? Men are funny.\"\n\n\"Is that meant as a conversational gambit, or an honest observation?\"\n\n\"Observation. I mean, men are always complaining that girls talk too\nmuch, but if a girl keeps her mouth shut, they think there's something\nwrong with her.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. And you think that's a paradox or something?\"\n\nShe looked puzzled. \"Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The noise a jackhammer makes isn't pleasant at all, but\nif it doesn't make that noise, you figure it isn't functioning\nproperly. So you wonder why.\"\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I had noticed a man wearing the\nblack-and-gold union suit of Ravenhurst's Security Guard coming toward\nus from the door, using the gliding shuffle that works best under low\ngee. I ignored him to listen to Jack Ravenhurst.\n\n\"That has all the earmarks of a dirty crack,\" she said. The tone of\nher voice indicated that she wasn't sure whether to be angry or to\nlaugh.\n\n\"Hello, Miss Ravenhurst; Hi, Oak.\" Colonel Brock had reached the\ntable. He stood there, smiling his rather flat smile, while his eyes\nlooked us both over carefully.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe was five feet ten, an inch shorter than I am, and lean almost to\nthe point of emaciation. His scarred, hard-bitten face looked as\nthough it had gotten that way when he tried to kiss a crocodile.\n\n\"Hello, Brock,\" I said. \"What's new?\"\n\nJack gave him a meaningless smile and said: \"Hello, colonel.\" She was\nobviously not very impressed with either of us.\n\n\"Mind if I sit?\" Brock asked.\n\nWe didn't, so he sat.\n\n\"I'm sorry I missed you at the spaceport,\" Brock said seriously, \"but\nI had several of my boys there with their eyes open.\" He was quite\nobviously addressing Jack, not me.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Jack said. \"I'm not going anywhere this time.\" She\nlooked at me and gave me an odd grin. \"I'm going to stay home and be a\ngood girl this time around.\"\n\nColonel Brock's good-natured chuckle sounded about as genuine as the\nring of a lead nickel. \"Oh, you're no trouble, Miss Ravenhurst.\"\n\n\"Thank you, kind sir; you're a poor liar.\" She stood up and smiled\nsweetly. \"Will you gentlemen excuse me a moment?\"\n\nWe would and did. Colonel Brock and I watched her cross the room and\ndisappear through a door. Then he turned to look at me, giving me a\nwry grin and shaking his head a little sadly. \"So you got saddled with\nJack the Ripper, eh, Oak?\"\n\n\"Is she that bad?\"\n\nHis chuckle was harsher this time, and had the ring of truth. \"You'll\nfind out. Oh, I don't mean she's got the morals of a cat or anything\nlike that. So far as I know, she's still waiting for Mister Right to\ncome along.\"\n\n\"Drugs?\" I asked. \"Liquor?\"\n\n\"A few drinks now and then--nothing else,\" Brock said. \"No, it's none\nof the usual things. It isn't what _she_ does that counts; it's what\nshe talks other people into doing. She's a convincer.\"\n\n\"That sounds impressive,\" I said. \"What does it mean?\"\n\nHis hard face looked wolfish, \"I ought to let you find out for\nyourself. But, no; that wouldn't be professional courtesy, and it\nwouldn't be ethical.\"\n\n\"Brock,\" I said tiredly, \"I have been given more runarounds in the\npast week than Mercury has had in the past millennium. I expect\nclients to be cagey, to hold back information, and to lie. But I\ndidn't expect it of you. Give.\"\n\nHe nodded brusquely. \"As I said, she's a convincer. A talker. She can\ntalk people into doing almost anything she wants them to.\"\n\n\"For instance?\"\n\n\"Like, for instance, getting all the patrons at the _Bali_ to do a\nsnake dance around the corridors in the altogether. The Ceres police\nbroke it up, but she was nowhere to be found.\"\n\nHe said it so innocently that I knew he'd been the one to get her out\nof the mess.\n\n\"And the time,\" he continued, \"that she almost succeeded in getting a\nwelder named Plotkin elected Hereditary Czar of Ceres. She'd have\nsucceeded, too, if she hadn't made the mistake of getting Plotkin\nhimself up to speak in front of his loyal supporters. After that,\neverybody felt so silly that the movement fell apart.\"\n\nHe went on, reciting half a dozen more instances of the girl's ability\nto influence people without winning friends. None of them were new to\nme; they were all on file in the Political Survey Division of the\nUnited Nations Government on Earth, plus several more which Colonel\nBrock either neglected to tell me or wasn't aware of himself.\n\nBut I listened with interest; after all, I wasn't supposed to know any\nof these things. I am just a plain, ordinary, \"confidential\nexpediter\". That's what it says on the door of my office in New York,\nand that's what it says on my license. All very legal and very\ndishonest.\n\nThe Political Survey Division is very legal and very dishonest, too.\nTheoretically, it is supposed to be nothing but a branch of the System\nCensus Bureau; it is supposed to do nothing but observe and tabulate\npolitical trends. The actual fact that it is the Secret Service branch\nof the United Nations Government is known only to relatively few\npeople.\n\nI know it because I work for the Political Survey Division.\n\nThe PSD already had men investigating both Ravenhurst and Thurston,\nbut when they found out that Ravenhurst was looking for a confidential\nexpediter, for a special job, they'd shoved me in fast.\n\nIt isn't easy to fool sharp operators like Colonel Brock, but, so far, I'd\nbeen lucky enough to get away with it by playing ignorant-but-not-stupid.\n\nThe steaks were brought, and I mentally saluted Ravenhurst, as I had\npromised myself I would. Then I rather belatedly asked the colonel if\nhe'd eat with us.\n\n\"No,\" he said, with a shake of his head. \"No, thanks. I've got to get\nthings ready for her visit to the Viking plant tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh? Hiding something?\" I asked blandly.\n\nHe didn't even bother to look insulted. \"No. Just have to make sure\nshe doesn't get hurt by any of the machinery, that's all. Most of the\nstuff is automatic, and she has a habit of getting too close. I guess\nshe thinks she can talk a machine out of hurting her as easily as she\ncan talk a man into standing on his head.\"\n\nJack Ravenhurst was coming back to the table. I noticed that she'd\nfixed her hair nicely and put on make-up. It made her look a lot more\nfeminine than she had while she was on the flitterboat.\n\n\"Well,\" she said as she sat down, \"have you two decided what to do\nwith me?\"\n\nColonel Brock just smiled and said: \"I guess we'll have to leave that\nup to you, Miss Ravenhurst.\" Then he stood up. \"Now, if you'll excuse\nme, I'll be about my business.\"\n\nJack nodded, gave him a quick smile, and fell to on her steak with the\nvoraciousness of an unfed chicken in a wheat bin.\n\nMiss Jaqueline Ravenhurst evidently had no desire to talk to me at the\nmoment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn Ceres, as on most of the major planetoids, a man's home is his\ncastle, even if it's only a hotel room. Raw nickel-iron, the basic\nbuilding material, is so cheap that walls and doors are seldom made of\nanything else, so a hotel room is more like a vault than anything else\non Earth. Every time I go into one of the hotels on Ceres or Eros, I\nget the feeling that I'm either a bundle of gold certificates or a\nparticularly obstreperous prisoner being led to a medieval solitary\nconfinement cell. They're not pretty, but they're _solid_.\n\nJack Ravenhurst went into her own room after flashing me a rather hurt\nsmile that was supposed to indicate her disappointment in not being\nallowed to go nightclubbing. I gave her a big-brotherly pat on the\nshoulder and told her to get plenty of sleep, since we had to be up\nbright and early in the morning.\n\nOnce inside my own room, I checked over my luggage carefully. It had\nbeen brought there from the spaceport, where I'd checked it before\ngoing to Ravenhurst's Raven's Rest, on orders from Ravenhurst himself.\nThis was one of several rooms that Ravenhurst kept permanently rented\nfor his own uses, and I knew that Jack kept a complete wardrobe in her\nown rooms.\n\nThere were no bugs in my luggage--neither sound nor sight spying\ndevices of any kind. Not that I would have worried if there had been;\nI just wanted to see if anyone was crude enough to try that method of\nsmuggling a bug into the apartment.\n\nThe door chime pinged solemnly.\n\nI took a peek through the door camera and saw a man in a bellboy's\nuniform, holding a large traveling case. I recognized the face, so I\nlet him in.\n\n\"The rest of your luggage, sir,\" he said with a straight face.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" I told him. I handed him a tip, and he popped\noff.\n\nThis stuff was special equipment that I hadn't wanted Ravenhurst or\nanybody else to get his paws into.\n\nI opened it carefully with the special key, slid a hand under the\nclothing that lay on top for camouflage, and palmed the little\ndetector I needed. Then I went around the room, whistling gently to\nmyself.\n\nThe nice thing about an all-metal room is that it's impossible to hide\na self-contained bug in it that will be of any use. A small, concealed\nbroadcaster can't broadcast any farther than the walls, so any bug has\nto have wires leading out of the room.\n\nI didn't find a thing. Either Ravenhurst kept the room clean or\nsomebody was using more sophisticated bugs than any I knew about. I\nopened the traveling case again and took out one of my favorite\ngadgets. It's a simple thing, really: a noise generator. But the noise\nit generates is non-random noise. Against a background of \"white,\"\npurely random noise, it is possible to pick out a conversation, even\nif the conversation is below the noise level, simply because\nconversation is patterned. But this little generator of mine was\nnon-random. It was the multiple recording of ten thousand different\nconversations, all meaningless, against a background of \"white\" noise.\nTry that one on your differential analyzers.\n\nBy the time I got through, nobody could tap a dialogue in that room,\nbarring, as I said, bugs more sophisticated than any the United\nNations knew about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen I went over and tapped on the communicating door between my room\nand Jack Ravenhurst's. There was no answer.\n\nI said, \"Jack, I'm coming in. I have a key.\"\n\nShe said, \"Go away. I'm not dressed. I'm going to bed.\"\n\n\"Grab something quick,\" I told her. \"I'm coming in.\"\n\nI keyed open the door.\n\nShe was no more dressed for bed than I was, unless she made a habit of\nsleeping in her best evening togs. Anger blazed in her eyes for a\nsecond, then that faded, and she tried to look all sweetness and\nlight.\n\n\"I was trying on some new clothes,\" she said innocently.\n\nA lot of people might have believed her. The emotional field she threw\nout, encouraging utter belief in her every word, was as powerful as\nany I'd ever felt. I just let it wash past me and said: \"Come into my\nroom for a few minutes, Jack; I want to talk to you.\"\n\nI didn't put any particular emphasis into it. I don't have to. She\ncame.\n\nOnce we were both inside my shielded room with the walls vibrating\nwith ten thousand voices and a hush area in the center, I said\npatiently, \"Jack, I personally don't care where you go or what you do.\nTomorrow, you can do your vanishing act and have yourself a ball, for\nall I care. But there are certain things that have to be done first.\nNow, sit down and listen.\"\n\nShe sat down, her eyes wide. Evidently, nobody had ever beaten her at\nher own game before.\n\n\"Tonight, you'll stay here and get some sleep. Tomorrow, we go for a\ntour of Viking, first thing in the morning. Tomorrow afternoon, as\nsoon as I think the time is ripe, you can sneak off. I'll show you how\nto change your appearance so you won't be recognized. You can have all\nthe fun you want for twenty-four hours. I, of course, will be hunting\nhigh and low for you, but I won't find you until I have finished my\ninvestigation.\n\n\"On the other hand, I want to know where you are at all times, so that\nI can get in touch with you if I need you. So, no matter where you\nare, you'll keep in touch by phoning BANning 6226 every time you\nchange location. Got that number?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"BANning 6226,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Fine. Now, Brock's agents will be watching you, so I'll have to\nfigure out a way to get you away from them, but that won't be too\nhard. I'll let you know at the proper time. Meanwhile, get back in\nthere, get ready for bed, and get some sleep. You'll need it. Move.\"\n\nShe nodded rather dazedly, got up, and went to the door. She turned,\nsaid goodnight in a low, puzzled voice, and closed the door.\n\nHalf an hour later, I quietly sneaked into her room just to check. She\nwas sound asleep in bed. I went back to my own room, and got some sack\ntime myself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's a pleasure to have you here again, Miss Ravenhurst,\" said Chief\nEngineer Midguard. \"Anything in particular you want to see this time?\"\nHe said it as though he actually enjoyed taking the boss' teenage\ndaughter through a spacecraft plant.\n\nMaybe he did, at that. He was a paunchy, graying man in his sixties,\nwho had probably been a rather handsome lady-killer for the first\nhalf-century of his life, but he was approaching middle age now, which\nhas a predictable effect on the telly-idol type.\n\nJack Ravenhurst was at her regal best, with the kind of _noblesse\noblige_ that would bring worshipful gratitude to the heart of any\nunderling. \"Oh, just a quick run-through on whatever you think would\nbe interesting, Mr. Midguard; I don't want to take up too much of your\ntime.\"\n\nMidguard allowed as how he had a few interesting things to show her,\nand the party, which also included the watchful and taciturn Colonel\nBrock, began to make the rounds of the Viking plant.\n\nThere were three ships under construction at the time: two cargo\nvessels and a good-sized passenger job. Midguard seemed to think that\nevery step of spacecraft construction was utterly fascinating--for\nwhich, bully for him--but it was pretty much of a drag as far as I was\nconcerned. It took three hours.\n\nFinally, he said, \"Would you like to see the McGuire-7?\"\n\nWhy, yes, of course she would. So we toddled off to the new ship while\nMidguard kept up a steady line of patter.\n\n\"We think we have all the computer errors out of this one, Miss\nRavenhurst. A matter of new controls and safety devices. We feel that\nthe trouble with the first six machines was that they were designed to\nbe operated by voice orders by any qualified human operator. The\ntrouble is that they had no way of telling just who was qualified. The\nbrains are perfectly capable of distinguishing one individual from\nanother, but they can't tell whether a given individual is a space\npilot or a janitor. In fact--\"\n\nI marked the salient points in his speech. The MG-YR-7 would be\nstrictly a one-man ship. It had a built-in dog attitude--friendly\ntoward all humans, but loyal only to its master. Of course, it was\nlikely that the ship would outlast its master, so its loyalties could\nbe changed, but only by the use of special switching keys.\n\nThe robotics boys still weren't sure why the first six had gone\ninsane, but they were fairly certain that the primary cause was the\nmatter of too many masters. The brilliant biophysicist, Asenion, who\npromulgated the Three Laws of Robotics in the last century, had shown\nin his writings that they were unattainable ideals--that they only\ntold what a perfect robot _should_ be, not what a robot actually was.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe First Law, for instance, would forbid a robot to harm a human\nbeing, either by action or inaction. But, as Asenion showed, a robot\ncould be faced with a situation which allowed for only two possible\ndecisions, both of which required that a human being be harmed. In\nsuch a case, the robot goes insane.\n\nI found myself speculating what sort of situation, what sort of\nAsenion paradox, had confronted those first six ships. And whether it\nhad been by accident or design. Not that the McGuire robots had been\nbuilt in strict accord with the Laws of Robotics; that was impossible\non the face of it. But no matter how a perfectly logical machine is\nbuilt, the human mind can figure out a way to goof it up because the\nhuman mind is capable of transcending logic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe McGuire ship was a little beauty. A nice, sleek, needle, capable\nof atmospheric as well as spatial navigation, with a mirror-polished,\nberyl-blue surface all over the sixty-five feet of her--or\nhis?--length.\n\nIt was standing upright on the surface of the planetoid, a shining\nneedle in the shifting sunlight, limned against the star-filled\ndarkness of space. We looked at it through the transparent viewport,\nand then took the flexible tube that led to the air lock of the ship.\n\nThe ship was just as beautiful inside as it was outside. Neat,\ncompact, and efficient. The control room--if such it could be\ncalled--was like no control room I'd ever seen before. Just an\nacceleration couch and observation instruments. Midguard explained\nthat it wasn't necessary to be a pilot to run the ship; any person who\nknew a smattering of astronavigation could get to his destination by\nsimply telling the ship what he wanted to do.\n\nJack Ravenhurst took in the whole thing with wide-eyed interest.\n\n\"Is the brain activated, Mr. Midguard?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes. We've been educating him for the past month, pumping\ninformation in as rapidly as he could record it and index it. He's\nfinished with that stage now; we're just waiting for the selection of\na test pilot for the final shakedown cruise.\" He was looking warily at\nJack as he spoke, as if he were waiting for something.\n\nEvidently, he knew what was coming. \"I'd like to talk to him,\" Jack\nsaid. \"It's so interesting to carry on an intelligent conversation\nwith a machine.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that's impossible, Miss Ravenhurst,\" Midguard said rather\nworriedly. \"You see, McGuire's primed so that the first man's voice he\nhears will be identified as his master. It's what we call the 'chick\nreaction'. You know: the first moving thing a newly-hatched bird sees\nis regarded as the mother, and, once implanted, that order can't be\nrescinded. We can change McGuire's orientation in that respect, but\nwe'd rather not have to go through that. After the test pilot\nestablishes contact, you can talk to him all you want.\"\n\n\"When will the test pilot be here?\" Jack asked, still as sweet as\nsucrodyne.\n\n\"Within a few days. It looks as though a man named Nels Bjornsen will\nbe our choice. You may have heard of him.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"but I'm sure your choice will be correct.\"\n\nMidguard still felt apologetic. \"Well, you know how it is, Miss\nRavenhurst; we can't turn a delicate machine like this over to just\nanyone for the first trial. He has to be a man of good judgment and\nfast reflexes. He has to know exactly what to say and when to say it,\nif you follow me.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly; certainly.\" She paused and looked thoughtful. \"I\npresume you've taken precautions against anyone stealing in here and\ntaking control of the ship.\"\n\nMidguard smiled and nodded wisely. \"Certainly. Communication with\nMcGuire can't be established unless and until two keys are used in the\nactivating panel. I carry one; Colonel Brock has the other. Neither\nof us will give his key up to anyone but the accredited test pilot.\nAnd McGuire himself will scream out an alarm if anyone tries to jimmy\nthe locks. He's his own burglar alarm.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I see.\" A pause. \"Well, Mr. Midguard, I think you've done\na very commendable job. Thank you so much. Is there anything else you\nfeel I should see?\"\n\n\"Well--\" He was smilingly hesitant. \"If there's anything else you want to\nsee, I'll be glad to show it to you. But you've already seen\nour ... ah ... _piece de resistance_, so to speak.\"\n\nShe glanced at her wrist. It had been over four hours since we'd\nstarted. \"I am rather tired,\" Jack said. \"And hungry, too. Let's call\nit a day and go get something to eat.\"\n\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Midguard said. \"I'll be honored to be your host, if I\nmay. We could have a little something at my apartment.\"\n\nI knew perfectly well that he'd had a full lunch prepared and waiting.\n\nThe girl acknowledged his invitation and accepted it. Brock and I\ntrailed along like the bodyguards we were supposed to be. I wondered\nwhether or not Brock suspected me of being more than I appeared to be.\nIf he didn't, he was stupider than I thought; on the other hand, he\ncould never be sure. I wasn't worried about his finding out that I was\na United Nations agent; that was a pretty remote chance. Brock didn't\neven know the United Nations Government _had_ a Secret Service; it was\nunlikely that he would suspect me of being an agent of a presumably\nnonexistent body.\n\nBut he could very easily suspect that I had been sent to check on him\nand the Thurston menace, and, if he had any sense, he actually did. I\nwasn't going to give him any verification of that suspicion if I could\nhelp it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMidguard had an apartment in the executive territory of the Viking\nreservation, a fairly large place with plastic-lined walls instead of\nthe usual painted nickel-iron. Very luxurious for Ceres.\n\nThe meal was served with an air of subdued pretension that made\neverybody a little stiff and uncomfortable, with the possible\nexception of Jack Ravenhurst, and the definite exception of myself. I\njust listened politely to the strained courtesy that passed for small\ntalk and waited for the chance I knew would come at this meal.\n\nAfter the eating was all over, and we were all sitting around with\ncigarettes going and wine in our glasses, I gave the girl the signal\nwe had agreed upon. She excused herself very prettily and left the\nroom.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes, I began to look a little worried. The bathroom\nwas only a room away--we were in a dining area, and the bathroom was\njust off the main bedroom--and it shouldn't have taken her that long\nto brush her hair and powder her face.\n\nI casually mentioned it to Colonel Brock, and he smiled a little.\n\n\"Don't worry, Oak; even if she does walk out of this apartment, my men\nwill be following her wherever she goes. I'd have a report within one\nminute after she left.\"\n\nI nodded, apparently satisfied. \"I've been relying on that,\" I said.\n\"Otherwise, I'd have followed her to the door.\"\n\nHe chuckled and looked pleased.\n\nTen minutes after that, even he was beginning to look a little\nworried. \"Maybe we'd better go check,\" he said. \"She might have hurt\nherself or ... or become ill.\"\n\nMidguard looked flustered. \"Now, just a minute, colonel! I can't allow\nyou to just barge in on a young girl in the ... ah ... bathroom.\nEspecially not Miss Ravenhurst.\"\n\nBrock made his decision fast; I'll give him credit for that.\n\n\"Get Miss Pangloss on the phone!\" he snapped. \"She's just down the\ncorridor. She'll come down on your orders.\"\n\nAt the same time, he got to his feet and made a long jump for the\ndoor. He grabbed the doorpost as he went by, swung himself in a new\norbit, and launched himself toward the front door. \"Knock on the\nbathroom door, Oak!\" he bawled as he left.\n\nI did a long, low, flat dive toward the bedroom, swung left, and\nbrought myself up sharply next to the bathroom door. I pounded on the\ndoor. \"Miss Ravenhurst! Jack! Are you all right?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nGood. There shouldn't have been.\n\nColonel Brock fired himself into the room and braked himself against\nthe wall. \"Any answer?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"My men outside say she hasn't left.\" He rapped sharply on the door\nwith the butt of his stun gun. \"Miss Ravenhurst! Is there anything the\nmatter?\"\n\nAgain, no answer.\n\nI could see that Brock was debating on whether he should go ahead and\ncharge in by himself without waiting for the female executive who\nlived down the way. He was still debating when the woman showed up,\nescorted by a couple of the colonel's uniformed guards.\n\nMiss Pangloss was one of those brisk, efficient, middle-aged\ncareer-women who had no fuss or frills about her. She had seen us\nknocking on the door, so she didn't bother to do any knocking herself.\nShe just opened the door and went in.\n\nThe bathroom was empty.\n\nAgain, as it should be.\n\nAll hell broke loose then, with me and Brock making most of the\nblather. It took us nearly ten minutes to find that the only person\nwho had left the area had been an elderly, thin man who had been\nwearing the baggy protective clothing of a maintenance man.\n\nBy that time, Jack Ravenhurst had been gone more than forty minutes.\nShe could be almost anywhere on Ceres.\n\nColonel Brock was furious and so was I. I sneered openly at his\nassurance that the girl couldn't leave and then got sneered back at\nfor letting other people do what was supposed to be my job. That\nphase only lasted for about a minute, though.\n\nThen Colonel Brock muttered: \"She must have had a plexiskin mask and a\nwig and the maintenance clothing in her purse. As I recall, it was a\nfairly good-sized one.\" He didn't say a word about how careless I had\nbeen to let her put such stuff in her purse. \"All right,\" he went on,\n\"we'll find her.\"\n\n\"I'm going to look around, too,\" I said. \"I'll keep in touch with your\noffice.\" I got out of there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got to a public phone as fast as I could, punched BANning 6226, and\nsaid: \"Marty? Any word?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"I'll call back.\"\n\nI hung up and scooted out of there.\n\nI spent the next several hours pushing my weight around all over\nCeres. As the personal representative of Shalimar Ravenhurst, who was\nmanager of Viking Spacecraft, which was, in turn, the owner of Ceres,\nI had a lot of weight to push around. I had every executive on the\nplanetoid jumping before I was through.\n\nColonel Brock, of course, was broiling in his own juices. He managed\nto get hold of me by phone once, by calling a Dr. Perelson whom I was\ninterviewing at the time.\n\nThe phone chimed, Perelson said, \"Excuse me,\" and went to answer. I\ncould hear his voice from the other room.\n\n\"Mr. Daniel Oak? Yes; he's here. Well, yes. Oh, all sorts of\nquestions, colonel.\" Perelson's voice was both irritated and worried.\n\"He says Miss Ravenhurst is missing; is that so? Oh? Well, does this\nman have any right to question me this way? Asking me? About\neverything!... How well I know the girl, the last time I saw\nher--things like that. Good heavens, we've hardly met!\" He was getting\nexasperated now. \"But does he have the authority to ask these\nquestions? Oh. Yes. Well, of course, I'll be glad to co-operate in any\nmanner I can ... Yes ... Yes. All right, I'll call him.\"\n\nI got up from the half-reclining angle I'd been making with the wall,\nand shuffled across the room as Dr. Perelson stuck his head around the\ncorner and said, \"It's for you.\" He looked as though someone had put\naluminum hydrogen sulfate in his mouthwash.\n\nI picked up the receiver and looked at Brock's face in the screen. He\ndidn't even give me a chance to talk. \"What are you trying to do?\" he\nshouted explosively.\n\n\"Trying to find Jaqueline Ravenhurst,\" I said, as calmly as I could.\n\n\"Oak, you're a maniac! Why, by this time, it's all over Ceres that the\nboss' daughter is missing! Shalimar Ravenhurst will have your hide for\nthis!\"\n\n\"He will?\" I gave him Number 2--the wide-eyed innocent stare. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Why, you idiot, I thought you had sense enough to know that this\nshould be kept quiet! She's pulled this stunt before, and we always\nmanaged to quiet things down before anything happened! We've managed\nto keep everything under cover and out of the public eye ever since\nshe was fifteen, and now you blow it all up out of proportion and\ncreate a furore that won't ever be forgotten!\"\n\nHe gave his speech as though it had been written for him in full caps,\nwith three exclamation points after every sentence, and added gestures\nand grimaces after every word.\n\n\"Just doing what I thought was best,\" I said. \"I want to find her as\nsoon as possible.\"\n\n\"Well, stop it! Now! Let us handle it from here on in!\"\n\nThen I lowered the boom. \"Now _you_ listen, Brock. I am in charge of\nJack Ravenhurst, not you. I've lost her, and I'll find her. I'll\nwelcome your co-operation, and I'd hate to have to fight you, but if\nyou don't like the way I'm handling it, you can just tell your boys to\ngo back to their regular work and let me handle it alone, without\ninterference. Now, which'll it be?\"\n\nHe opened his mouth, closed it, and blew out his breath from between\nhis lips. Then he said: \"All right. The damage has been done, anyhow.\nBut don't think I won't report all this to Ravenhurst as soon as I can\nget a beam to Raven's Rest.\"\n\n\"That's your job and your worry, not mine. Now, have you got any\nleads?\"\n\n\"None,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Then I'll go out and dig up some. I'll let you know if I need you.\"\nAnd I cut off.\n\nDr. Perelson was sitting on his couch, with an expression that\nindicated that the pH of his saliva was hovering around one point\nfive.\n\nI said, \"That will be all, Dr. Perelson. Thank you for your\nco-operation.\" And I walked out into the corridor, leaving him with a\nbaffled look.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the next public phone, I dialed the BANning number again.\n\n\"Any news?\"\n\n\"Not from her; she hasn't reported in at all.\"\n\n\"I didn't figure she would. What else?\"\n\n\"Just as you said,\" he told me. \"With some cute frills around the\nedges. Ten minutes ago, a crowd of kids--sixteen to twenty-two age\nrange--about forty of 'em--started a songfest and football game in the\ncorridor outside Colonel Brock's place. The boys he had on duty there\nrecognized the Jack Ravenhurst touch, and tried to find her in the\ncrowd. Nothing doing. Not a sign of her.\"\n\n\"That girl's not only got power,\" I said, \"but she's bright as a solar\nflare.\"\n\n\"Agreed. She's headed up toward Dr. Midguard's place now. I don't know\nwhat she has in mind, but it ought to be fun to watch.\"\n\n\"Where's Midguard now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Hovering around Brock, as we figured. He's worried and feels\nresponsible because she disappeared from his apartment, as predicted.\"\n\n\"Well, I've stirred up enough fuss in this free-falling anthill to\ngive them all the worries they need. Tell me what's the overall\neffect?\"\n\n\"Close to perfect. It's slightly scandalous and very mysterious, so\neverybody's keeping an eye peeled. If anyone sees Jaqueline\nRavenhurst, they'll run to a phone, and naturally she's been spotted\nby a dozen different people in a dozen different places already.\n\n\"You've got both Brock's Company guards and the civil police tied up\nfor a while.\"\n\n\"Fine. But be sure you keep the boys who are on her tail shifting\naround often enough so that she doesn't spot them.\"\n\n\"Don't worry your thick little head about that, Dan,\" he said. \"They\nknow their business. Are you afraid they'll lose her?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not, and you know it. I just don't want her to know she's\nbeing followed. If she can't ditch her shadow, she's likely to try to\ntalk to him and pull out all the stops convincing him that he should\ngo away.\"\n\n\"You think she could? With _my_ boys?\"\n\n\"No, but if she tries it, it'll mean she knows she's being followed.\nThat'll make it tougher to keep a man on her trail. Besides, I don't\nwant her to try to convince him and fail.\"\n\n\"_Ich graben Sie._ On the off chance that she does spot one and gives\nhim a good talking to, I'll pass along the word that the victim is to\nwalk away meekly and get lost.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, \"but I'd rather she didn't know.\"\n\n\"She won't. You're getting touchy, Dan; 'pears to me you'd rather be\ndoing that job yourself, and think nobody can handle it but you.\"\n\nI gave him my best grin. \"You are closer than you know. O.K., I'll lay\noff. You handle your end of it and I'll handle mine.\"\n\n\"A fair exchange is no bargain. Go, and sin no more.\"\n\n\"I'll buzz you back before I go in,\" I said, and hung up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPlaying games inside a crowded asteroid is not the same as playing\ngames in, say, Honolulu or Vladivostok, especially when that game is a\ncombination of hide-and-seek and ring-around-the-Rosie. The trouble is\nlack of communication. Radio contact is strictly line-of-sight inside\na hunk of metal. Radar beams can get a little farther, but a man has\nto be an expert billiards player to bank a reflecting beam around very\nmany corners, and even that would depend upon the corridors being\nempty, which they never are. To change the game analogy again, it\nwould be like trying to sink a ninety-foot putt across Times Square on\nNew Year's Eve.\n\nFollowing somebody isn't anywhere near as easy as popular fiction\nmight lead you to believe. Putting a tail on someone whose spouse\nwants divorce evidence is relatively easy, but even the best\ndetectives can lose a man by pure mischance. If the tailee, for\ninstance, walks into a crowded elevator and the automatic computer\ndecides that the car is filled to the limit, the man who's tailing him\nwill be left facing a closed door. Something like that can happen by\naccident, without any design on the part of the tailee.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIf you use a large squad of agents, all in radio contact with one\nanother, that kind of loss can be reduced to near zero by simply\nhaving a man covering every possible escape route.\n\nBut if the tailee knows, or even suspects, that he's being followed,\nwants to get away from his tail, and has the ability to reason\nmoderately well, it requires an impossibly large team to keep him in\nsight. And if that team has no fast medium of communication, they're\nlicked at the onset.\n\nIn this case, we were fairly certain of Jack Ravenhurst's future\nactions, and so far our prophecies had been correct ... but if she\ndecided to shake her shadows, fun would be had by all.\n\nAnd as long as I had to depend on someone else to do my work for me, I\nwas going to be just the teenchiest bit concerned about whether they\nwere doing it properly.\n\nI decided it was time to do my best to imitate a cosmic-ray particle,\nand put on a little speed through the corridors that ran through the\nsubsurface of Ceres.\n\nMy vac suit was in my hotel room. One of the other agents had picked\nit up from my flitterboat and packed it carefully into a small attach\u00e9\ncase. I'd planned my circuit so that I'd be near the hotel when things\ncame to the proper boil, so I did a lot of diving, breaking all kinds\nof traffic regulations in the process.\n\nI went to my room, grabbed the attach\u00e9 case, checked it over\nquickly--never trust another man to check your vac suit for\nyou--and headed for the surface.\n\nNobody paid any attention to me when I walked out of the air lock onto\nthe spacefield. There were plenty of people moving in and out, going\nto and from their ships and boats. It wasn't until I reached the edge\nof the field that I realized that I had over-played my hand with\nColonel Brock. It was only by the narrowest hair, but that had been\nenough to foul up my plans. There were guards surrounding the\nperimeter with radar search beams.\n\nAs I approached, one of the guards walked toward me and made a series\nof gestures with his left hand--two fingers up, fist, two fingers up,\nfist, three fingers up. I set my suit phone for 223; the guy's right\nhand was on the butt of his stun gun.\n\n\"Sorry, sir,\" came his voice. \"We can't allow anyone to cross the\nfield perimeter. Emergency.\"\n\n\"My name's Oak,\" I said tiredly. \"Daniel Oak. What is going on here?\"\n\nHe came closer and peered at me. Then: \"Oh, yes, sir; I recognize you.\nWe're ... uh--\" He waved an arm around. \"Uh ... looking for Miss\nRavenhurst.\" His voice lowered conspiratorially. I could tell that he\nwas used to handling the Ravenhurst girl with silence and suede\ngloves.\n\n\"Up _there_?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, Colonel Brock is a little worried. He says that Miss Ravenhurst\nis being sent to a school on Luna and doesn't want to go. He got to\nthinking about it, and he's afraid that she might try to leave\nCeres--sneak off you know.\"\n\nI knew.\n\n\"We've got a guard posted at the airlocks leading to the field, but\nColonel Brock is afraid she might come up somewhere else and jump\noverland.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said. I hadn't realized that Brock was that close to panic.\nWhat was eating him?\n\nThere must be something, but I couldn't figure it. Even the\nIntelligence Corps of the Political Survey Division can't get complete\ninformation every time.\n\nAfter all, if he didn't want the girl to steal a flitterboat and go\nscooting off into the diamond-studded velvet, all he'd have to do\nwould be to guard the flitterboats. I turned slowly and looked around.\nIt seemed as though he'd done that, too.\n\nAnd then my estimation of Brock suddenly leaped up--way up. Just a\nguard at each flitterboat wouldn't do. She could talk her way into the\nboat and convince the guard that he really shouldn't tell anyone that\nshe had gone. By the time he realized he'd been conned, she'd be\nthousands of miles away.\n\nAnd since a boat guard would have to assume that any approaching\nperson _might_ be the boat's legitimate owner, he'd have to talk to\nwhomever it was that approached. _Kaput._\n\nBut a perimeter guard would be able to call out an alarm if anyone\ncame from the outside without having to talk to them.\n\nAnd the guards watching the air locks undoubtedly had instructions to\nwatch for any female that even vaguely matched Jack's description. A\nvac suit fits too tightly to let anyone wear more than a facial\ndisguise, and Brock probably--no, _definitely_--had his tried-and-true\nmen on duty there. The men who had already shown that they were fairly\nresistant to Jack Ravenhurst's peculiar charm. There probably weren't\nmany with such resistance, and the number would become less as she\ngrew older.\n\nThat still left me with my own problem. I had already lost too much\ntime, and I had to go a long way. Ceres is irregular in shape, but\nit's roughly four hundred and eighty miles in diameter and a little\nover fifteen hundred miles in circumference.\n\nViking Test Field Four, where McGuire 7 was pointing his nose at the\nsky, was about twenty-five miles away, as the crow flies. But of\ncourse I couldn't go by crow.\n\nBy using a low, fairly flat, jackrabbit jump, a man in good condition\ncan make a twelve hundred foot leap on the surface of Ceres, and each\njump takes him about thirty seconds. At that rate, you can cover\ntwenty-five miles in less than an hour. That's what I'd intended on\ndoing, but I couldn't do it with all this radar around the field. I\nwouldn't be stopped, of course, but I'd sure tip my hand to Colonel\nBrock--the last thing I wanted to do.\n\nBut there was no help for it. I'd have to go back down and use the\ncorridors, which meant that I'd arrive late--_after_ Jack Ravenhurst\ngot there, instead of _before_.\n\nThere was no time to waste, so I got below as fast as possible,\nrepacked my vac suit, and began firing myself through the corridors as\nfast as possible. It was illegal, of course; a collision at\ntwenty-five miles an hour can kill quickly if the other guy is coming\nat you at the same velocity. There were times when I didn't dare break\nthe law, because some guard was around, and, even if he didn't catch\nme, he might report in and arouse Brock's interest in a way I wouldn't\nlike.\n\nI finally got to a tubeway, but it stopped at every station, and it\ntook me nearly an hour and a half to get to Viking Test Area Four.\n\nAt the main door, I considered--for all of five seconds--the idea of\nsimply telling the guard I had to go in. But I knew that, by now, Jack\nwas there ahead of me. No. I couldn't just bull my way in. Too crude.\nToo many clues.\n\nHell's fire and damnation! I'd have to waste more time.\n\nI looked up at the ceiling. The surface wasn't more than a hundred\nfeet overhead, but it felt as though it were a hundred light-years.\n\nIf I could get that guard away from that door for five seconds, all\nwould be gravy from then on in. But how? I couldn't have the diversion\nconnected with me. Or--\n\nSometimes, I'm amazed at my own stupidity.\n\nI beetled it down to the nearest phone and got hold of my BANning\nnumber.\n\n\"Jack already inside?\" I snapped.\n\n\"Hell, yes! What happened to you?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Got to make the best of it. I'm a corner away from Area\nFour. Where's your nearest man?\"\n\n\"At the corner near the freight office.\"\n\n\"I'll go to him. What's he look like?\"\n\n\"Five-nine. Black, curly hair. Your age. Fat. Name's Peter Quilp. He\nknows you.\"\n\n\"Peter Quilp?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Good. Circulate a report that Jack has been seen in the vicinity of\nthe main gate to Area Four. Put it out that there's a reward of five\nthousand for the person who finds her. I'm going to have Quilp gather\na crowd.\"\n\nHe didn't ask a one of the million questions that must have popped\ninto his mind. \"Right. Anything else?\"\n\n\"No.\" I hung up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin ten minutes, there was a mob milling through the corridor.\nEverybody in the neighborhood was looking for Jaqueline Ravenhurst.\nThen Peter Quilp yelled.\n\n\"I've got her! I've got her! Guard!\"\n\nWith a scene like that going on, the guard couldn't help but step out\nof his cubicle to see what was going on.\n\nI used the key I was carrying, stepped inside, and relocked the door.\nNo one in the crowd paid any attention.\n\nFrom then on up, it was simply a matter of evading patrolling\nguards--a relatively easy job. Finally, I put on my vac suit and went\nout through the air lock.\n\nMcGuire was still sitting there, a bright blue needle that reflected\nthe distant sun as it moved across the ebon sky. Ceres' rotation took\nit from horizon to horizon in less than two hours, and you could see\nit and the stars move against the spire of the ship.\n\nI made it to the air lock in one long jump.\n\nJack Ravenhurst had gone into the ship through the tube that led to\nthe passenger lock. She might or might not have her vac suit on; I\nknew she had several of them on Ceres. It was probable that she was\nwearing it without the fishbowl.\n\nI used the cargo lock.\n\nIt took a few minutes for the pumps to cycle, wasting more precious\ntime. I was fairly certain that she would be in the control cabin,\ntalking, but I was thankful that the pumps were silent.\n\nFinally, I took off my fishbowl and stepped into the companionway.\n\nAnd something about the size of Luna came out of nowhere and clobbered\nme on the occiput. I had time to yell, \"Get away!\" Then I was as one\nwith intergalactic space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Please!_ said the voice. _Please! Stop the drive! Go back! McGuire!\nI_ demand _that you stop! I_ order _you to stop! Please! PLEASE!_\n\nIt went on and on. A voice that shifted around every possible mode of\nemotion. Fear. Demand. Pleading. Anger. Cajoling. Hate. Threat.\n\nAround and around and around.\n\n_Can't you speak, McGuire? Say something to me!_ A shrill, soft,\nthroaty, harsh, murmuring, screaming voice that had one basic\ncharacteristic. It was a female voice.\n\nAnd then another voice.\n\n_I am sorry, Jack. I can speak with you. I can record your data. But I\ncannot accept your orders. I can take orders from only One. And he has\ngiven me his orders._\n\nAnd the feminine voice again: _Who was it? What orders? You keep\nsaying that it was the man on the couch. That doesn't make sense!_\n\nI didn't hear the reply, because it suddenly occurred to me that\nDaniel Oak was the man on the couch, and that I was Daniel Oak.\n\nMy head was throbbing with every beat of my heart, and it felt as if\nmy blood pressure was varying between zero and fifteen hundred pounds\nper square inch in the veins and arteries and capillaries that fed my\nbrain.\n\nI sat up, and the pain began to lessen. The blood seemed to drain away\nfrom my aching head and go elsewhere.\n\nI soon figured out the reason for that; I could tell by the feel that\nthe gravity pull was somewhere between one point five and two gees. I\nwasn't at all used to it, but my head felt less painful and rather\nmore hazy. If possible.\n\nI concentrated, and the girl's voice came back again.\n\n\"... I knew you when you were McGuire One, and Two, and Three, and\nFour, and Five, and Six. And you were always good to me and\nunderstanding. Don't you remember?\"\n\nAnd then McGuire's voice--human, masculine, and not distorted at all\nby the reproduction system, but sounding rather stilted and terribly\nlogical: \"I remember, Jack. The memory banks of my previous\nactivations are available.\"\n\n\"_All_ of them? Can you remember everything?\"\n\n\"I can remember everything that is in my memory banks.\"\n\nThe girl's voice rose to a wail. \"But you _don't_ remember! You\n_always_ forgot things! They took things out each time you were\nreactivated, don't you remember?\"\n\n\"I cannot remember that which is not contained in my memory banks,\nJack. That is a contradiction in terms.\"\n\n\"But I was always able to _fix_ it before!\" The tears in her eyes were\naudible in her voice. \"I'd tell you to remember, and I'd tell you\n_what_ to remember, and you'd _remember_ it! Tell me what's happened\nto you this time!\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you. The information is not in my data banks.\"\n\nSlowly, I got to my feet. Two gees isn't much, once you get used to\nit. The headache had subsided to a dull, bearable throb.\n\nI was on a couch in a room just below the control chamber, and Jack\nRavenhurst's voice was coming down from above. McGuire's voice was all\naround me, coming from the hidden speakers that were everywhere in\nthe ship.\n\n\"But why won't you obey me any more, McGuire?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'll answer that, McGuire,\" I said.\n\nJack's voice came weakly from the room above. \"Mr. Oak? Dan? Thank\nheaven you're all right!\"\n\n\"No thanks to you, though,\" I said. I was trying to climb the ladder\nto the control room, and my voice sounded strained.\n\n\"You've got to do something!\" she said with a touch of hysteria.\n\"McGuire is taking us straight toward Cygnus at two gees and won't\nstop.\"\n\nMy thinking circuits began to take over again. \"Cut the thrust to half\na gee, McGuire. Ease it down. Take a minute to do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe gravity pull of acceleration let up slowly as I clung to the\nladder. After a minute, I climbed on up to the control room.\n\nJack Ravenhurst was lying on the acceleration couch, looking\nswollen-faced and ill. I sat down on the other couch.\n\n\"I'm sorry I hit you,\" she said. \"Really.\"\n\n\"I believe you. How long have we been moving, McGuire?\"\n\n\"Three hours, twelve minutes, seven seconds, sir,\" said McGuire.\n\n\"I didn't want anyone to know,\" Jack said. \"Not anyone. That's why I\nhit you. I didn't know McGuire was going to go crazy.\"\n\n\"He's not crazy, Jack,\" I said carefully. \"This time, he has a good\nchance of remaining sane.\"\n\n\"But he's not McGuire any more!\" she wailed. \"He's different!\nTerrible!\"\n\n\"Sure he's different. You should be thankful.\"\n\n\"But what happened?\"\n\nI leaned back on the couch. \"Listen to me, Jack, and listen carefully.\nYou think you're pretty grown up, and, in a lot of ways you are. But\nno human being, no matter how intelligent, can store enough experience\ninto seventeen years to make him or her wise. A wise choice requires\ndata, and gathering enough data requires time.\" That wasn't exactly\naccurate, but I had to convince her.\n\n\"You're pretty good at controlling people, aren't you, Jack. A real\npowerhouse. Individuals, or mobs, you can usually get your own way. It\nwas your idea to send you to Luna, not your father's. It was your idea\nto appoint yourself my assistant in this operation. It was you who\nplanted the idea that the failure of the McGuire series was due to\nThurston's activities.\n\n\"You used to get quite a kick out of controlling people. And then you\nwere introduced to McGuire One. I got all the information on that. You\nwere fifteen, and, for the first time in your life, you found an\nintelligent mind that couldn't be affected at all by that emotional\nfield you project so well. Nothing affected McGuire but data. If you\ntold him something, he believed it. Right, McGuire?\"\n\n\"I do not recall that, sir.\"\n\n\"Fine. And, by the way, McGuire--the data you have been picking up in\nthe last few hours, since your activation, is to be regarded as\nunique data. It applies only to Jaqueline Ravenhurst, and is not to be\nassumed relevant to any other person unless I tell you otherwise.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"That's what I don't understand!\" Jack said unhappily. \"I stole the\ntwo keys that were supposed to activate McGuire. He was supposed to\nobey the first person who activated him. But _I_ activated him, and he\nwon't obey!\"\n\n\"You weren't listening to what Midguard said, Jack,\" I said gently.\n\"He said: 'The first _man's_ voice he hears will be identified as his\nmaster.'\"\n\n\"You'd been talking to every activation of McGuire. You'd ... well, I\nwon't say you'd fallen in love with him, but it was certainly a\nschoolgirl crush. You found that McGuire didn't respond to emotion,\nbut only to data and logic.\n\n\"You've always felt rather inferior in regard to your ability to\nhandle logic, haven't you, Jack?\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes. I have.\"\n\n\"Don't cry, now; I'm only trying to explain it to you. There's nothing\nwrong with your abilities.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. But you wanted to be able to think like a man, and you couldn't.\nYou think like a woman! And what's wrong with that? Nothing! Your\nmethod of thinking is just as good as any man's, and better than most\nof 'em.\n\n\"You found you could handle people emotionally, and you found it was\nso easy that you grew contemptuous. The only mind that responded to\nyour logic was McGuire's. But your logic is occasionally as bad as\nyour feminine reasoning is good. So, every time you talked to McGuire,\nyou eventually gave him data that he couldn't reconcile in his\ncomputations. If he did reconcile them, then his thinking had very\nlittle in common with the actual realities of the universe, and he\nbehaved in non-survival ways.\n\n\"McGuire was your friend, your brother, your Father Confessor. He\nnever made judgments or condemned you for anything you did. All he did\nwas sit there and soak up troubles and worries that he couldn't\nunderstand or use. Each time, he was driven mad.\n\n\"The engineers and computermen and roboticists who were working on it\nwere too much under your control to think of blaming you for McGuire's\ntroubles. Even Brock, in spite of his attitude of the tough guy\nwatching over a little girl, was under your control to a certain\ndegree. He let you get away with all your little pranks, only making\nsure that you didn't get hurt.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"They were all so easy. So very easy. I could speak\nnonsense and they'd listen and do what I told them. But McGuire didn't\naccept nonsense, I guess.\" She laughed a little. \"So I fell in love\nwith a machine.\"\n\n\"Not _a_ machine,\" I said gently. \"Six of them. Each time the basic\ndata was pumped into a new McGuire brain, you assumed that it was the\nsame machine you'd known before with a little of its memory removed.\nEach time, you'd tell it to 'remember' certain things, and, of course,\nhe did. If you tell a robot that a certain thing is in his memory\nbanks, he'll automatically put it there and treat it as a memory.\n\n\"To keep you from ruining him a seventh time, we had them put in one\nlittle additional built-in inhibition. McGuire won't take orders from\na woman.\"\n\n\"So, even after I turned him on, he still wouldn't take orders from\nme,\" she said. \"But when you came in, he recognized you as his\nmaster.\"\n\n\"If you want to put it that way.\"\n\nAgain, she laughed a little. \"I know why he took off from Ceres. When\nI hit you, you said, 'Get away'. McGuire had been given his first\norder, and he obeyed it.\"'\n\n\"I had to say something,\" I said. \"If I'd had time, I'd have done a\nlittle better.\"\n\nShe thought back. \"You said, '_We_ had them add that inhibition.'\nWho's _we_?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you yet. But we need young women like you, and you'll be\ntold soon enough.\"\n\n\"Evidently they need men like you, too,\" she said. \"You don't react to\nan emotional field, either.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do. Any human being does. But I use it; I don't fight it.\nAnd I don't succumb to it.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\" she asked. \"Go back to Ceres?\"\n\n\"That's up to you. If you do, you'll be accused of stealing McGuire,\nand I don't think it can be hushed up at this stage of the game.\"\n\n\"But I can't just run away.\"\n\n\"There's another out,\" I said. \"We'll have a special ship pick us up\non one of the nearer asteroids and leave McGuire there. We'll be\nsmuggled back, and we'll claim that McGuire went insane again.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No. That would ruin Father, and I can't do that,\nin spite of the fact that I don't like him very much.\"\n\n\"Can you think of any other solution?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Thanks. But you have. All I have to do is take it to Shalimar\nRavenhurst. He'll scream and yell, but he has a sane ship--for a\nwhile. Between the two of us. I think we can get everything\nstraightened out.\"\n\n\"But I want to go to school on Luna.\"\n\n\"You can do that, too. And I'll see that you get special training,\nfrom special teachers. You've got to learn to control that technique\nof yours.\"\n\n\"You have that technique, don't you? And you can control it. You're\nwonderful.\"\n\nI looked sharply at her and realized that I had replaced McGuire as\nthe supermind in her life.\n\nI sighed. \"Maybe in another three or four years,\" I said. \"Meanwhile,\nMcGuire, you can head us for Raven's Rest.\"\n\n\"Home, James,\" said Jack Ravenhurst.\n\n\"I am McGuire,\" said McGuire.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Spaceship Named McGuire, by \nGordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A SPACESHIP NAMED MCGUIRE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24198-8.txt or 24198-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/1/9/24198/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
