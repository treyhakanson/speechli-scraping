Agent Pell used his head, even if he did rely on\nhunches more than on the computer. In fact, when the game got rough, he\nfound that to use his head, he first had to keep it...._]\n\n\n\n\nChapter I\n\n\nThe night the visitors came Richard Pell worked late among the great\nbanks of criminological computers. He whistled to himself, knowing that\nhe was way off key but not caring. Ciel, his wife, was still in his\nmind's eye; he'd seen her on the viewer and talked with her not ten\nminutes ago.\n\n\"Be home shortly, baby,\" he'd said, \"soon as I fill in a form or two.\"\n\n\"All right, dear. I'll wait,\" she'd answered, with just the slightest\ntone of doubt.\n\nIt was an important night. It was at once their second anniversary and\nthe beginning of their second honeymoon. Just how Pell--knobby, more or\nless homely, and easygoing--had won himself a lovely, long-limbed blonde\nlike Ciel was something of a mystery to many of their friends. She could\nhardly have married him for his money. Central Investigation Bureau\nagents were lucky if all their extras and bonuses brought them up to a\nthousand credits a year.\n\nPell had unquestionably caught her in a romantic moment. Maybe that was\npart of the trouble--part of the reason they needed this second\nhoneymoon, this period of re-acquaintance so badly. Being the wife of a\nC.I.B. agent meant sitting at home nine-tenths of the time while he was\nworking on a case, and then not hearing about the case for security\nreasons during the one-tenth of the time he was with her.\n\nFour times now Pell had been ready to take his vacation; four times last\nminute business had come up. No more, though, by golly. Tonight he'd get\nout of here just as quickly as....\n\nThe Identifier, beyond the door, began to hum. That meant somebody was\nputting his hand to the opaque screen, and if the scanner recognized the\nfingerprints the door would open. Pell scowled at the bulky shadows\noutside.\n\n\"Go away, whoever you are,\" he muttered to himself.\n\nSome of the other agents were out there, no doubt; they were always\ngetting sudden inspirations late at night and returning to use the\ncomputers again. In fact, it had been tactfully suggested to Agent\nRichard Pell that he might use the computers a little more himself\ninstead of relying on hunches as he so often did. \"Investigation's a\ncold science, not a fancy art,\" Chief Larkin was fond of saying to the\ngroup--with his eyes on Pell.\n\nWell, whoever it was, Pell was definitely through. No time-wasting\nconversation for him! He was ready for six glorious weeks of saved-up\nvacation time. He and Ciel, early tomorrow, would grab a rocket for one\nof the Moon resorts, and there they'd just loaf and relax and pay\nattention to each other. Try to regain whatever it was they'd had....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door opened and Chief Larkin walked in.\n\nChief Eustace J. Larkin was tall, in his forties, but still boyishly\nhandsome. He dressed expensively and well. He was dynamic and confident\nand he always had about him just the faintest aroma of very expensive\nshaving cologne. He had a Master's degree in criminology and his rise to\nthe post of Director, C.I.B., had been sudden, dramatic and impressive.\nNot the least of his talents was a keen sense of public relations.\n\n\"I--uh--was on my way out,\" said Pell. He reached for his hat. Funny\nabout hats: few people traveled topside anymore, and in the\nclimate-conditioned tunnels you didn't need a hat. But C.I.B. agents had\nto be neat and dignified; regulations required hats and ties and cuffs\nand lapels. Thus, you could always spot a C.I.B. agent a mile away.\n\nLarkin had a dimple when he smiled and Pell would bet he knew it. \"We'd\nhave called your home if we hadn't found you here. Sit down, Dick.\"\n\nPell sat glumly. For the first time, he noticed the men who had come in\nwith the Chief. He recognized both. One was fiftyish, tall,\nsolidly-built and well-dressed on the conservative side. His face was\nstrong, square and oddly pale, as if someone had taken finest white\nmarble and roughly hacked a face into it. Pell had seen that face in\nfaxpapers often. The man was Theodor Rysland, once a wealthy corporation\nlawyer, now a World Government adviser in an unofficial way. Some\nadmired him as a selfless public servant; others swore he was a\npower-mad tyrant. Few were indifferent.\n\n\"I'm sure you recognize Mr. Rysland,\" said Chief Larkin, smiling. \"And\nthis is Dr. Walter Nebel, of the World Department of Education.\"\n\nDr. Walter Nebel was slight and had a head remarkably tiny in proportion\nto the rest of him. He wore cropped hair. His eyes were turtle-lidded\nand at first impression sleepy, and then, with a second look--wary. Pell\nremembered that he had won fame some time ago by discovering the\nelectrolytic enzyme in the thought process. Pell wasn't sure exactly\nwhat this was, but the faxpapers had certainly made a fuss about it at\nthe time.\n\nHe shook hands with the two men and then said to Larkin, \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Patience,\" said Larkin and shuffled chairs into place.\n\nRysland sat down solidly and gravely; Nebel perched. Rysland looked at\nPell with a strong, level stare and said, \"It's my sincere hope that\nthis meeting tonight will prevent resumption of the war with Venus.\"\n\nLarkin said, \"Amen.\"\n\nPell stared back in some surprise. High-level stuff!\n\nRysland saw his stare and chuckled. \"Chief Larkin tells me your\nsympathies are more or less Universalist. Not that it would be\nnecessary, but it helps.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Pell, with mild bewilderment. The difference between the\nUniversal and Defense parties was pretty clear-cut. The Universalists\nhoped to resume full relations with Venus and bring about a really\nsecure peace through friendship and trade. It would admittedly be a\ntough struggle, and the Defenders didn't think it was possible. Forget\nVenus, said they; fortify Earth, keep the line of demarcation on Mars,\nand sit tight.\n\n\"But there is, as you may know,\" said Rysland, \"a third course in our\nrelations with Venus.\"\n\n\"There is?\" asked Pell. From the corner of his eye he saw Chief Larkin\nlooking at him with an expression of--what, amusement? Yes, amusement,\nlargely, but with a touch of contempt, too, perhaps. Hard to say.\n\n\"The third course,\" said Rysland, not smiling, \"would be to attack Venus\nagain, resume the war, and hope to win quickly. We know Venus is\nexhausted from the recent struggle. A sudden, forceful attack might\npossibly subjugate her. At least, that is the argument of a certain\ngroup called the Supremists.\"\n\nDr. Nebel spoke for the first time. Pell realized that the man had been\nwatching him closely. His voice was sibilant; it seemed to drag itself\nthrough wet grass. \"Also Venus is psychologically unprepared for war;\nthe Supremists believe that, too.\"\n\nPell reached back into his memory. The Supremists. They were a minor\npolitical party--sort of a cult, too. The outfit had sprung up in the\nlast year or so. Supremists believed that Earthmen, above all other\ncreatures, had a destiny--were chosen--were supreme. They had several\nfollowers as delegates in World Congress. General impression: slightly\ncrackpot.\n\n\"The Supremists,\" said Theodor Rysland, tapping his hard, white palm,\nand leaning forward, \"have been calling for attack. Aggression. Starting\nthe war with Venus all over again. And they're not only a vociferous\nnuisance. They have an appeal in this business of Earthman's supremacy.\nThey're gaining converts every day. In short, _they've now become\ndangerous_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPell thought it over as Rysland talked. Certainly the idea of renewed\nwar was nightmarish. He'd been in the last one: who hadn't? It had\nstarted in 2117, the year he was born, and it had dragged on for\ntwenty-five years until T-day and the truce. The causes? Well, both\nEarth and Venus worked the mineral deposits on Mars unimpeded by the\nnon-intelligent insectile life on that planet, and the original\narguments had been about those mineral deposits, though there were\nenough for a dozen planets there. The causes were more complicated and\nobscure than that. Semantics, partly. There was freedom as Earthmen saw\nit and freedom as the Venusians saw it. Same with honor and good and\nevil. They were always two different things. And then Venusians had a\ngreenish tinge to their skins and called the Earthmen, in their clicking\nlanguage, \"Pink-faces.\" And both Earthmen and Venusians hated like the\ndevil to see the other get away with anything.\n\nAnyway, there had been war, terrible war. Space battle, air battle,\nlanding, repulse. Stalemate. Finally, through utter weariness perhaps,\ntruce. Now, a taut, uneasy, suspicious peace. Communications opened, a\nfew art objects mutually exchanged. Immigration for a few Venusian\ndancers or students or diplomats. It wasn't much, but it was all in the\nright direction. At least Pell felt so.\n\nRysland was saying: \"We're not sure, of course, but we suspect--we\n_feel_--that more than mere accident may be behind these Supremists.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Someone seeking power, perhaps. As I said, we don't know. We want to\nfind out. Dr. Nebel has been interested for some time in the curious\npsychology of these Supremists--their blind, unthinking loyalty to their\ncause, for instance. He is, as you know, a special assistant in the\nDepartment of Education. He asked my help in arranging for an\ninvestigation, and I agreed with him wholeheartedly that one should be\nmade.\"\n\n\"And I told these gentlemen,\" said Chief Larkin, \"that I'd put a detail\non it right away.\"\n\nNow Pell believed he saw through it. Larkin didn't believe it was\nimportant at all; he was just obliging these Vips. A man couldn't have\ntoo many friends in World Government circles, after all. But of course\nLarkin couldn't afford to put one of his bright, machine-minded boys on\nit, and so Pell was the patsy.\n\n\"Could I remind you,\" said Pell, \"that my vacation is supposed to start\ntomorrow?\"\n\n\"Now, now, Dick,\" said Larkin, turning on the personality, \"this won't\ntake you long. Just a routine report. The computers ought to give you\nall the information you need in less than a day.\"\n\n\"That's what you always say, every time I'm ready to take a vacation.\nI've been saving up for two years now....\"\n\n\"Dick, that's hardly the right attitude for an agent who is so close to\nmaking second grade.\"\n\nLarkin had him over a barrel, there. Pell desperately wanted to make his\npromotion. Second-graders didn't spend their time at the control banks\ngathering data; they did mostly desk work and evaluation. They had a\nlittle more time to spend with their wives. He said, \"Okay, okay,\" and\ngot up.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To get my wife on the viewer and tell her I won't be home for a while\nafter all.\"\n\nHe left the three of them chuckling and thought: _He jests at scars who\nnever felt a wound._ He didn't say it aloud. You could quote formulae or\nscientific precepts in front of Larkin, but not Shakespeare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe punched out his home number and waited until Ciel's image swirled\ninto the viewplate. His heart went boppety-bop as it always did. Hair of\npolished gold. Dark eyes, ripe olives, a little large for her face and\nsometimes deep and fathomless. She wore a loose, filmy nightgown and the\nsuggestion of her body under it was enough to bring on a touch of\nmadness in him.\n\n\"Let me say it,\" Ciel said. She wasn't smiling. \"You won't be home for a\nwhile. You've got another case.\"\n\n\"Well--yes. That's it, more or less.\" Pell swallowed.\n\n\"Oh, Dick.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey. It's just that something important came up. I've got\na conference on my hands. It shouldn't take more than an hour.\"\n\n\"And we were supposed to leave for the moon in the morning.\"\n\n\"Listen, baby, this is absolutely the last time. I mean it. As soon as\nthis thing is washed up we'll _really_ take that vacation. Look, I'll\ntell you what, I'll meet you somewhere in an hour. We'll have some\nfun--take in a floor show--drink a little meth. We haven't done that in\na long time. How about the Stardust Cafe? I hear they've got a terrific\nnew mentalist there.\"\n\nCiel said, \"No.\"\n\n\"Don't be like that. We need an evening out. It'll hold us until I get\nthis new case washed up. That won't be long, but at least we'll have a\nlittle relaxation.\"\n\nCiel said, \"Well....\"\n\n\"Attababy. One hour. Absolutely. You just go to Station B-90, take the\nlift to topside and it's right on Shapley Boulevard there. You can't\nmiss it.\"\n\n\"I know where it is,\" said Ciel. She shook her finger. \"Richard Pell, so\nhelp me, if you stand me up this time....\"\n\n\"Baby!\" he said in a tone of deep injury.\n\n\"Goodbye, Dick.\" She clicked off.\n\nPell had the feeling that even the free-flowing meth and the gaiety of\nthe Stardust Cafe wouldn't really help matters much. He sighed deeply as\nhe turned and went back into the other room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\nA little over an hour later he stepped from the elevator kiosk at\nStation B-90 and breathed the night air of topside. It was less pure\nactually than the carefully controlled tunnel air, but it was somehow\ninfinitely more wonderful. At least to a sentimental primitive boob like\nRichard Pell, it was. Oh, he knew that it was infinitely more sensible\nto live and work entirely underground as people did these days--but just\nthe same he loved the look of the black sky with the crushed diamonds of\nstars thrown across it and he loved the uneven breeze and the faint\nsmell of trees and grass.\n\nThis particular topside section was given over to entertainment; all\nabout him were theaters and cafes and picnic groves and airports for\nflying sports. A few hundred feet ahead he could see the\nthree-dimensional atmospheric projection that marked the Stardust Cafe,\nand he could hear faintly the mournful sound of a Venusian lament being\nplayed by the askarins. He was glad they hadn't banned Venusian music,\nanyway, although he wouldn't be surprised if they did, some day.\n\nThat was one of the things these Supremists were trying to do. Rysland\nand Chief Larkin had given him a long and careful briefing on the outfit\nso that he could start work tomorrow with his partner, Steve Kronski.\nSteve, of course, would shrug phlegmatically, swing his big shoulders\ntoward the computer rooms and say, \"Let's go to work.\" It would be just\nanother assignment to him.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the job would be not without a certain amount of\ninterest. There were a couple of puzzling things about these Supremists\nthat Rysland had pointed out. First of all, they didn't seem to be at\nall organized or incorporated. No headquarters, no officers that anybody\nknew about. They just _were_. It was a complete mystery how a man became\na Supremist, how they kept getting new members all the time. Yet you\ncouldn't miss a Supremist whenever you met one. Before the conversation\nwas half over he'd start spouting about the destiny of Earthmen and the\ngeneral inferiority of all other creatures and so on. It sounded like\nhogwash to Pell. He wondered how such an attitude could survive in a\nscientific age.\n\nNor would a Supremist be essentially a moron or a neurotic; they were\nfound in all walks of life, at all educational and emotional levels.\nRysland told how he had questioned a few, trying to discover when, where\nand how they joined the movement: Apparently there was nothing to join,\nat least to hear them tell it. They just knew one day that they were\nSupremists, and that was the word. Rysland had shaken his head sadly and\nsaid, \"Their belief is completely without logic--and maybe that's what\nmakes it so strong. Maybe that's what frightens me about it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOkay, tomorrow then Pell would tackle it. Tomorrow he'd think about it.\nRight now he had a date with his best girl.\n\nHe entered the cafe and the music of the askarins swirled more loudly\nabout his head and he looked through the smoke and colored light until\nhe spotted Ciel sitting in a rear booth. The place was crowded. On the\nsmall dance floor before the orchestra nearly nude Venusian girls were\ngoing through the writhing motions of a serpentine dance. Their greenish\nskins shimmered iridescently. The sad-faced Venusian musicians on the\nband-stand waved their graceful, spatulated fingers over their curious,\nboxlike askarins, producing changing tones and overtones by the altered\ncapacitance. A rocketman in the black and silver uniform of the Space\nForce was trying to stumble drunkenly out on to the floor with the\ndancers and his friends were holding him back. There was much laughter\nabout the whole thing. The Venusian girls kept dancing and didn't change\ntheir flat, almost lifeless expressions.\n\nCiel looked up without smiling when he got to the booth. She had a\nhalf-finished glass of meth before her.\n\nHe tried a smile anyway. \"Hello, baby.\" He sat down.\n\nShe said, \"I didn't really think you'd get here. I could have had dates\nwith exactly eleven spacemen. I kept count.\"\n\n\"You have been faithful to me, Cynara, in your fashion. I need a drink\nand don't want to wait for the waitress. Mind?\" He took her half glass\nof meth and tossed it down. He felt the wonderful illusion of an\nexplosion in his skull, and it seemed to him that his body was suddenly\nthe strongest in the world and that he could whip everybody in the joint\nwith one arm tied behind his back. He said, \"Wow.\"\n\nCiel tried a smile now. \"It does that to you when you're not used to\nit.\"\n\nThe first effect passed and he felt only the warmth of the drink. He\nsignaled a waitress and ordered a couple more. \"Don't forget to remind\nme to take a hangover pill before I go to work in the morning,\" he told\nCiel.\n\n\"You--you are going to work in the morning, then?\"\n\n\"Afraid I can't get out of it.\"\n\n\"And the moon trip's off?\"\n\n\"Not off, just postponed. We'll get to it, don't worry.\"\n\n\"Dick.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I can take it just so long, putting our vacation off and off and off.\"\nHer eyes were earnest, liquid and opaque. \"I've been thinking about it.\nTrying to arrive at something. I'm beginning to wonder, Dick, if maybe\nwe hadn't just better, well--call it quits, or something.\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"Baby, what are you saying?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA sudden, fanfare-like blast from the orchestra interrupted. They looked\nat the dance floor. There was a flash of light, a swirling of mist, and\nwithin the space of a second the Venusian girls suddenly disappeared and\ntheir place was taken by a tall, hawk-nosed, dark-eyed man with a cloak\nslung dramatically over one shoulder. The audience applauded.\n\n\"That's Marco, the new mentalist,\" said Pell.\n\nCiel shrugged to show that she wasn't particularly impressed. Neither\nwas Pell, to tell the truth. Mentalists were all the rage, partly\nbecause everybody could practice a little amateur telepathy and\nhypnotism in his own home. Mentalists, of course, made a career of it\nand were much better at it than anybody else.\n\nTheir drinks came and they watched Marco go through his act in a rather\ngloomy silence. Marco was skillful, but not especially unusual. He did\nthe usual stuff: calling out things that people wrote on slips of paper,\ncalling out dates on coins, and even engaging in mental duels wherein\nthe challenger wrote a phrase, concealed it from Marco, and then\ndeliberately tried to keep him from reading it telepathically. He had\nthe usual hypnotism session with volunteers who were certain they could\nresist. He made them hop around the stage like monkeys, burn their\nfingers on pieces of ice, and so on. The audience roared with laughter.\nPell and Ciel just kept staring.\n\nWhen Marco had finished his act and the thundering applause had faded\nthe Venusian dancing girls came back on the stage again.\n\nCiel yawned.\n\nPell said, \"Me, too. Let's get out of here.\"\n\nIt wasn't until they were home in their underground apartment and\ngetting ready for bed that Ciel turned to him and said, \"You see?\"\n\nHe was buttoning his pajamas. \"See what?\"\n\n\"It's _us_, Dick. It's not the floor show, or the meth, or\nanything--it's _us_. We can't enjoy _anything_ together any more.\"\n\nHe said, \"Now wait a minute....\"\n\nBut she had already stepped into the bedroom and slammed the door. He\nheard the lock click.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said, \"what am I supposed to do, sleep out here?\"\n\nHe took the ensuing silence to mean that he was.\n\nAnd he did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, as he came into the office, Pell scowled deeply and\nwent to his desk without saying good morning to anybody. Ciel had kept\nherself locked in the bedroom and he had made his own breakfast. How it\nwas all going to end he didn't know. He had the feeling that she was\nworking herself up to the decision to leave him. And the real hell of it\nwas that he couldn't exactly blame her.\n\n\"Morning, partner,\" said a voice above him. He looked up. Way up. Steve\nKronski was built along the general lines of a water buffalo. The usual\nbattered grin was smeared across his face. \"I see we got a new\nassignment.\"\n\n\"Oh--did Larkin brief you on it already?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Before I could get my hat off. Funny set-up, all right. I punched\nfor basic data before you got in. Hardly any.\"\n\n\"Maybe that means something in itself. Maybe somebody saw to it that the\ninformation never got into the central banks.\"\n\nThe C.I.B. computers could be hooked into the central banks which stored\ninformation on nearly everything and everybody. If you incorporated,\nfiled for a patent, paid taxes, voted, or just were born, the central\nbanks had an electronic record of it.\n\nKronski jerked his thumb toward the computer room. \"I punched for names\nof Supremist members coupla minutes ago. Thought maybe we could start in\nthat way.\"\n\nPell followed, his mind not really on the job yet. He wasn't at his best\nworking with the computers, and yet operating them was ninety per cent\nof investigation. He supposed he'd get used to it sometime.\n\nThree walls of the big computer room were lined with control racks,\nconsisting mostly of keyboard setups. Code symbols and index cards were\nplaced in handy positions. The C.I.B. circuits, of course, were adapted\nto the specialized work of investigation. In the memory banks of tubes\nand relays there was a master file of all names--aliases and nicknames\nincluded--with which the organization had ever been concerned.\nCriminals, witnesses, complaints, everyone. Code numbers linked to the\nnames showed where data on their owner could be found. A name picked at\nrandom might show that person to have data in the suspect file, the\narrest file, the psychological file, the modus operandi file, and so\nforth. Any of the data in these files could be checked, conversely,\nagainst the names.\n\nKronski walked over to where letter sized cards were flipping from a\nslot into a small bin. He said, \"Didn't even have to dial in Central\nData for these. Seems we got a lot of Supremist members right in our own\nlittle collection.\"\n\nPell picked up one of the cards and examined it idly. Vertical columns\nwere inscribed along the card, each with a heading, and with further\nsub-headed columns. Under the column marked _Modus Operandi_, for\ninstance, there were subcolumns titled _Person Attacked_, _Property\nAttacked_, _How Attacked_, _Means of Attack_, _Object of Attack_, and\n_Trademark_. Columns of digits, one to nine, were under each item. If\nthe digits 3 and 2 were punched under _Trademark_ the number 32 could be\nfed into the Operational Data machine and this machine would then give\nback the information on a printed slip that number 32 stood for the\ntrademark of leaving cigar butts at the scene of the crime.\n\n\"Got five hundred now,\" said Kronski. \"I'll let a few more run in case\nwe need alternates.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Pell. \"I'll start this batch through the analyzer.\"\n\nHe took the cards across the room to a machine about twenty feet long\nand dropped them into the feeder at one end. Channels and rollers ran\nalong the top of this machine and under them were a series of vertical\nslots into which the selected cards could drop. He cleared the previous\nsetting and ran the pointer to _Constants_. He set the qualitative dial\nto 85%. This meant that on the first run the punch hole combinations in\nthe cards would be scanned and any item common to 85% of the total would\nbe registered in a relay. Upon the second run the machine would select\nthe cards with this constant and drop them into a slot corresponding\nwith that heading. Further scanning, within the slot itself, would pick\nout the constant number.\n\nPell started the rollers whirring.\n\nKronski came over. He rubbed his battered nose. \"Hope we get outside on\nthis case. I'm gettin' sick o' the office. Haven't been out in weeks.\"\n\nPell nodded. Oh, for the life of a C.I.B. man. In teleplays they\ncornered desperate criminals in the dark ruins of the ancient cities\ntopside, and fought it out with freezers. The fact was, although\nregulations called for them to carry freezers in their shoulder\nholsters, one in a thousand ever got a chance to use them.\n\nPell said, \"Maybe you need a vacation.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Only I keep putting my vacation off. Got a whole month saved up\nnow.\"\n\n\"Me, too.\" Pell sighed. Ciel would probably be pacing the floor back\nhome now, trying to make up her mind. To break it up, or not to break it\nup? There would be no difficulty, really: she had been a pretty good\ncommercial artist before they were married and she wouldn't have any\ntrouble finding a job again somewhere in World City.\n\nThe rollers kept whirring and the cards flipping along with a whispering\nsound.\n\n\"Wonder what we're looking into these Supremists for?\" asked Kronski. \"I\nalways thought they were some kind of harmless crackpots.\"\n\n\"The Chief doesn't think so. Neither does Theodor Rysland.\" He told\nKronski more about the interview last night.\n\nPresently the machine stopped, clicked several times and began rolling\nthe other way.\n\n\"Well, it found something,\" said Kronski.\n\nThey kept watching. Oh, for the life of a C.I.B. man. Cards began to\ndrop into one of the slots. The main heading was _Physical_ and the\nsub-heading _Medical History_. Pell frowned and said, \"Certainly didn't\nexpect to find a constant in this department.\" He picked up a few of the\nfirst cards and looked at them, hoping to catch the constant by eye. He\ncaught it. \"What's 445 under this heading?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKronski said, \"I'll find out,\" and stepped over to the Operational Data\nboard. He worked it, took the printed slip that came out and called\nback: \"Record of inoculation.\"\n\n\"That's a funny one.\"\n\n\"Yup. Sure is.\" Kronski stared at the slip and scratched his neck. \"It\nmust be just any old kind inoculation. If it was special--like typhoid\nor tetanus or something--it'd have another digit.\"\n\n\"There must be some other boil-downs, if we could think of them.\" Pell\nwas frowning heavily. Some of the other men, used to the machines, could\ngrab a boil-down out of thin air, run the cards again and get another\nsignificant constant. The machine, however, inhibited Pell. It made him\nfeel uneasy and stupid whenever he was around it.\n\n\"How about location?\" suggested Kronski.\n\nPell shook his head. \"I checked a few by eye. All different numbers\nunder location. Some of 'em come from World City, some from Mars\nLanding, some from way out in the sticks. Nothing significant there.\"\n\n\"Maybe what we need is a cup of coffee.\"\n\nPell grinned. \"Best idea all morning. Come on.\"\n\nSome minutes later they sat across from each other at a table in the big\ncafeteria on the seventy-third level. It was beginning to be crowded now\nwith personnel from other departments and bureaus. The coffee urge came\nfor nearly everybody in the government offices at about the same time.\nPell was studying by eye a handful of spare data cards he'd brought\nalong and Kronski was reading faxpaper clippings from a large manila\nenvelope marked _Supremist Party_. Just on a vague hunch Pell had\nviewplated Central Public Relations and had them send the envelope down\nby tube.\n\n\"_Prominent Educator Addresses Supremist Rally_,\" Kronski muttered.\n\"_Three Spaceport Cargomen Arrested at Supremist Riot. Young Supremists\nForm Rocket Club._ Looks like anybody and everybody can be a Supremist.\nAnd his grandmother. Wonder how they do it?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\" Pell wasn't really listening.\n\n\"And here's a whole town went over to the Supremists. On the moon.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Pell.\n\nKronski sipped his coffee loudly. A few slender, graceful young men from\nWorld Commerce looked at him distastefully. \"Happened just this year.\nNew Year they all went over. Augea, in the Hercules Mountains. Big\ncelebration.\"\n\nPell looked up and said, \"Wait a minute....\"\n\n\"Wait for what? I'm not goin' anywhere. Not on this swivel-chair of a\njob, damn it.\"\n\n\"New Year they all become Supremists. And the last week of December\neverybody on the moon gets his inoculations, right?\"\n\n\"Search me.\"\n\n\"But I know that. I found that out when I was tailing those two gamblers\nwho had a place on the moon, remember?\"\n\n\"So it may be a connection.\" Kronski shrugged.\n\n\"It may be the place where we can study a bunch of these cases in a\nbatch instead of picking 'em one by one.\"\n\n\"You mean we oughta take a trip to the moon?\"\n\n\"Might not hurt for a few days.\"\n\nKronski was grinning at him.\n\n\"What are you grinning at?\"\n\n\"First you got to stay over on your vacation, so you can't go to the\nmoon with your wife. Now all of a sudden you decide duty has got to take\nyou to the moon, huh?\"\n\nPell grinned back then. \"What are you squawking about? You said you\nwanted to get out on this case.\"\n\nKronski, still grinning, got up. \"I'm not complaining. I'm just\ndemonstrating my powers of deduction, as they say in teleplays. Come on,\nlet's go make rocket reservations.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n\nThe big tourist rocket let them down at the Endymion Crater Landing, and\nthey went through the usual immigration and customs formalities in the\nunderground city there. They stayed in a hotel overnight, Pell and Ciel\nlooking very much like tourists, Kronski tagging along and looking\nfaintly out of place. In the morning--morning according to the 24 hour\nearth clock, that is--they took the jitney rocket to the resort town of\nAugea, in the Hercules Mountains. The town was really a cliff dwelling,\nbuilt into the side of a great precipice with quartz windows overlooking\na tremendous, stark valley.\n\nIt was hard to say just what attraction the moon had as a vacation land,\nand it was a matter of unfathomable taste. You either liked it, or you\ndidn't. If you didn't, you couldn't understand what people who liked it\nsaw in it. They couldn't quite explain. \"It's so quiet. It's so vast.\nIt's so beautiful,\" they'd say, but never anything clearer than that.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAugea itself was like twenty other resorts scattered throughout both the\nnorthern and southern latitudes of the moon. Except for the military\nposts and scientific research stations the moon had little value other\nthan as a vacation land. People came there to rest, to look at the\nbizarre landscape through quartz, or occasionally to don spacesuits and\ngo out on guided exploration trips.\n\nImmediately after checking into their hotel Pell and Kronski got\ndirections to the office of the Resident Surgeon and prepared to go\nthere. Ciel looked on quietly as Pell tightened the straps of his\nshoulder holster and checked the setting on his freezer.\n\nCiel said, \"I knew it.\"\n\n\"Knew what, honey?\" Pell went to the mirror to brush his hair. He wasn't\nsure it would materially improve the beauty of his long, knobby, faintly\nmelancholy face, but he did it any way.\n\n\"The minute we get here you have to go out on business.\"\n\nHe turned, kissed her, then held and patted her hand. \"That's just\nbecause I want to get it over with. Then I'll have time for you. Then\nwe'll have lots of time together.\"\n\nShe melted into him suddenly. She put her arms around his neck and held\nhim tightly. \"If I didn't love you, you big lug, it wouldn't be so bad.\nBut, Dick, I can't go on like this much longer. I just can't.\"\n\n\"Now, baby,\" he started to say.\n\nThere was a knock on the door then and he knew Kronski was ready. He\nbroke away from her, threw a kiss and said, \"Later. Later, baby.\"\n\nShe nodded and held her under lip in with her upper teeth.\n\nHe sighed and left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPell and Kronski left the hotel and started walking along the winding\ntunnel with the side wall of quartz. On their right the huge valley,\nwith its stark, unearthly landshapes, stretched away. It was near the\nend of the daylight period and the shadows from the distant peaks,\nacross the valley, were long and deep. Some of them, with little\nreflected light, seemed to be patches of nothingness. Pell fancied he\ncould step through them into another dimension.\n\nAll about them, even here in the side of the mountain, and behind the\nthick quartz, there was the odd, utterly dead silence of the moon.\n\nTheir footsteps echoed sparsely in the corridor.\n\nPell said to Kronski, \"Got the story all straight?\"\n\n\"Like as if it was true.\"\n\n\"Remember the signal?\"\n\n\"Sure. Soon as you say we're out of cigarettes. What's the matter, you\nthink I'm a moron, I can't remember?\"\n\nPell laughed and clapped him on the shoulder blade.\n\nMinutes later they turned in from the corridor, went through another,\nshorter passageway and then came to a door marked: Resident Surgeon.\nThey knocked and a deep voice boomed: \"Come in!\"\n\nIt was a medium-sized room, clearly a dispensary. There was an operating\ntable, a sterilizer, tall glass-fronted instrument cabinets and a\nrefrigerator. At the far end of the room a hulking, bear-like man sat\nbehind a magnalloy desk. The nameplate on the desk said: Hal H. Wilcox,\nM.D.\n\n\"Howdy, gents,\" said Dr. Hal H. Wilcox, shattering the moon-silence with\na vengeance. \"What can I do for you?\" he was all smiles.\n\nThat smile, decided Pell, didn't quite match the shrewdness of his eyes.\nHave to watch this boy, maybe. There was a big quartz window behind the\nman so that for the moment Pell saw him almost in silhouette. \"We're\nfrom _Current_ magazine,\" said Pell. \"I'm Dick Pell and this is Steve\nKronski. You got our radio, I guess.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.\" Wilcox creaked way back in his chair. \"You're\nthe fellas want to do a story on us moon surgeons.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Pell fumbled a little self-consciously with the gravity\nweights clipped to his trousers. Took a while for moon visitors to get\nused to them, everybody said.\n\n\"Well, I don't know exactly as how there's much of a story in what we\ndo. We're just a bunch of sawbones stationed here, that's all.\"\n\n\"We're interested in the diseases peculiar to the moon,\" said Pell. \"For\ninstance, why do the permanent residents up here have to have an\ninoculation every year?\"\n\n\"That's for the Venusian rash. Thought everybody knew that.\"\n\n\"Venusian rash?\"\n\n\"Nearest thing we ever had to it on Earth was Rocky Mountain Spotted\nFever. It's a rickettsia disease. Makes a fella pretty sick; sometimes\nkills him in two, three days. It started when they had those Venusian\nconstruction workers and tunnel men here, oh, long before the war. Under\ncertain conditions the rickettsia stays dormant and then pops up again.\"\n\n\"And the inoculation's for that?\"\n\n\"Standard. Once a year. You got the inoculation yourself, no doubt,\nbefore you jumped off for the moon.\"\n\n\"Where does the serum or whatever you call it come from?\"\n\nPell thought he saw Wilcox's eyes flicker. The doctor said, \"It's stored\nat the main landings. We draw it as we need it from there.\"\n\n\"Have any here now?\"\n\nWilcox's eyes did move this time. He looked at the refrigerator--but\nonly for the veriest moment. \"Don't really reckon so,\" he said finally.\nHe was staring blankly at Pell again.\n\nPell patted his pockets, turned to Kronski and said, \"You know, I think\nwe're out of cigarettes.\" Before Kronski could answer he moved to the\nbig quartz window behind Wilcox's desk. He gazed at the moonscape. \"Just\ncan't get over how big and quiet it is,\" he said.\n\nWilcox turned and gazed with him.\n\nKronski drew his freezer. He pointed it, squeezed, and there was a soft,\nmomentary buzzing and a twinkling of violet sparks at the muzzle of the\nweapon.\n\nWilcox sat where he was, frozen, knowing nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPell turned fast. \"Come on, Steve. Let's get it.\" They both stepped to\nthe refrigerator.\n\nThey had only seconds; Kronski's weapon had been set at a low reading.\nThe time of paralysis varied with the individual and Doc Wilcox looked\nhusky enough not to stay frozen very long. If Pell and Kronski returned\nto their original positions after he came out of it he would never know\nthat anything had happened.\n\nFar back on a lower shelf of the refrigerator were a dozen small bottles\nof the same type. Pell grabbed one, glanced at the label, nodded, and\ndropped it into his pocket. They took their places again.\n\nA few moments later Wilcox moved slightly and said, \"Yup. Moon's a funny\nplace all right. You either like it or you don't.\"\n\nThe rest of the conversation was fairly uninspired. Pell didn't want to\nwalk out too quickly, and had to keep up the pretense of interviewing\nWilcox for a magazine story. It wasn't easy. They excused themselves\nfinally, saying they'd be back for more information as soon as they made\nup some notes and got the overall picture--whatever that meant. Wilcox\nseemed satisfied with it.\n\nThey hurried back along the tunnel, descended to another level and found\nthe Augea Post Office. They showed the postmaster their C.I.B. shields\nand identification cards and arranged for quick and special handling for\nthe bottle of vaccine. Pell marked it _Attention, Lab_, and it was\nscheduled to take a quick rocket to the Endymion landing and the next\nunmanned mail rocket back to World City.\n\nPell stayed at the Post Office to make out a quick report on the\nincident so he wouldn't have to bore Ciel by doing it in the room, and\nKronski sauntered on back to the hotel.\n\nThere was a fax receiver there and Pell, missing the hourly voice\nbulletins of World City Underground, checked it for news. The pages were\ncoming out in a long tongue. He looked at the first headline:\n\n     VENUSIAN OBSERVERS ADMITTED TO WORLD CONGRESS\n\nWell, that was a step in the right direction. Maybe one of these days\nthey'd get around to a Solar Congress, as they ought to. The recent open\nwar with Venus had taught both Earthmen and Venusians a lot about space\ntravel, and it was probably possible to explore the solar system further\nright now. No one had yet gone beyond the asteroids. Recent observations\nfrom the telescope stations here on the moon had found what seemed to be\ngeometrical markings on some of Jupiter's satellites. Life there? Could\nbe. Candidates for a brotherhood of the zodiac--if both Terrans and\nVenusians could get the concept of brotherhood pounded through their\nstill partially savage skulls.\n\nAnother headline:\n\n     'WE CAN LICK UNIVERSE'--WAR SEC\n\nNot so good, that. Loose talk. Actually it was an Undersecretary of War\nwho had said it. Pell ran over the rest of the article quickly and came\nto what seemed to him a significant excerpt. \"_Certain patriotic groups\nin the world today are ready and willing to make the necessary\nsacrifices to get it over with. There is a fundamental difference\nbetween Earthmen and other creatures of the system, and this difference\ncan be resolved only by the dominance of one over the other._\"\n\nSupremist stuff. Strictly. If this Undersecretary were not actually a\nmember he was at least a supporter of the Supremist line. And that line\nhad an appeal for the unthinking, Pell had to admit. It was pleasant to\nconvince yourself that you were a superior specimen, that you were\nchosen....\n\n     VENUSIAN SPY SUSPECTS HELD ON MARS\n\nPell frowned deeply at that one and read the story. A couple of Venusian\nminers on Mars had wandered too close to one of the Earth military\noutposts, and had been nabbed. He doubted that they were spies; he\ndoubted that the authorities holding them thought so. But it seemed to\nmake a better story with a slight scare angle. He thought about how Mars\nwas divided at an arbitrary meridian--half to Venus, half to Earth. The\ndivision solved nothing, pleased nobody. Joe Citizen, the man in the\ntunnels could see these things, why couldn't these so-called trained\ndiplomats?\n\nPell finished his report, questioned the Postmaster a little on routine\nfacts concerning the town, and went back to the hotel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCiel was waiting for him. She was in a smart, frontless frock of\nsilvercloth. Her golden hair shone. Her large, dark eyes looked deep,\nmoist, alive. She looked at him questioningly? and he read the silent\nquestion: _Now can you spare a little time?_\n\n\"Baby,\" he said softly, and kissed her.\n\n\"Mm,\" he said when he had finished kissing her.\n\nThe voice-phone rang.\n\nHe said, \"Damn it.\"\n\nIt was Kronski, in his own room next door. \"Did Wilcox leave yet?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Wilcox?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The Doc. Is he still there?\"\n\n\"I didn't know he was here at all.\"\n\nKronski said, \"Huh?\"\n\nPell said, \"Maybe we better back up and start all over again.\"\n\n\"Wilcox, the Resident Surgeon Doc Wilcox,\" said Kronski, not too\npatiently. \"He was in my room a little while ago. Said he'd drop by on\nhis way out and see if you were in.\"\n\nPell glanced at Ciel. She was busy lighting a cigarette at the other end\nof the room. Or pretending to be busy. Pell said, \"I just got here. Just\nthis minute. I didn't see any Wilcox. What'd he want?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly. He was kind of vague about it. Wanted to know if\nhe could answer any more questions for us, or anything like that.\"\n\n\"Sounds screwy.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It sure does, now that I think it over.\"\n\n\"Let me call you back,\" said Pell and hung up. He turned to Ciel. \"Was\nDoc Wilcox here?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. He stopped in.\" Nothing but blank innocence on her face.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\n\"Hm?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"He just stopped in to see if you were\nhere, that was all. I told him you weren't and he went out again.\"\n\n\"But you didn't mention it.\"\n\n\"Well, why should I?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'd think you'd say something about it.\"\n\n\"Now, listen, Dick--I'm not some suspect you're grilling. What's the\nmatter with you, anyway?\"\n\n\"It just strikes me as funny that Wilcox should drop in here and you\nshouldn't say one word about it, that's all.\"\n\n\"Well, I like that.\" She folded her arms. \"You're getting to be so much\nof a cop you're starting to be suspicious of your own wife.\"\n\n\"Now, you know it's not that at all.\"\n\n\"What else is it? Dick, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this whole stupid\nbusiness you're in. The first time we get a few minutes alone together\nyou start giving me the third degree. I won't stand for it, that's all!\"\n\n\"Now, baby,\" he said and took a step toward her.\n\nThe deeper tone of the viewer sounded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Agh, for Pete's sake,\" he said disgustedly and answered the call. The\nimage of Chief Larkin's boyishly handsome face came into focus on the\nscreen. Pell lifted a surprised eyebrow and said, \"Oh, hello, Chief.\"\n\nLarkin's eye was cold. Especially cold in the setting of that boyish\nface. \"What in hell,\" he asked, \"are you and Kronski doing on the moon?\"\n\n\"Hm?\" Now it was Pell's turn to look innocent. \"Why, you know what we're\ndoing, Chief. We're investigating that case. You know the one--I don't\nwant to mention it over the viewer.\"\n\n\"Who the devil authorized you to go traipsing to the _moon_ to do it?\"\n\n\"Why, nobody authorized us. I thought--I mean, when you're working on a\ncase and you have a lead, you're supposed to go after it, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not when it's a crazy wild goose chase.\" In the viewer Pell\nsaw the Chief slam his desk with the palm of his hand. \"I'd like to know\nwhat in blazes you think you can do on the moon that you can't do in a\ngood healthy session at the computers?\"\n\n\"Well, that's kind of hard to explain over the viewer. We have made some\nprogress, though. I just sent you a report on it.\"\n\nLarkin narrowed one eye. \"Pell, who do you think you're fooling?\"\n\n\"Fooling?\"\n\n\"You heard me. I know damn well you wanted to take a vacation on the\nmoon. But we have a little job for you that holds you up, and what do\nyou do? The next best thing, eh? You see to it that the job _takes_ you\nto the moon.\"\n\n\"Now, Chief, it wasn't that at all....\"\n\n\"The devil it wasn't. Now, listen to me, Pell. You pack your bags and\nget right back to World City. The next rocket you can get. You\nunderstand?\"\n\nBefore he answered the question he looked at Ciel. She was staring at\nhim quietly. Again he could read something of what was in her mind. He\nknew well enough that she was trying to say to him: \"_Make a clean break\nnow. Tell him No, you won't come back. Quit. Now's the time to do\nit--unless you want that stupid job of yours more than you want me...._\"\n\nPell sighed deeply, slowly looked into the viewer again and said,\n\"Kronski and I'll be back on the next rocket, Chief.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\nBack again in the underground offices of C.I.B., Agent Richard Pell\nplunged into his job. Up to his neck. It was the only way he could keep\nfrom brooding about Ciel. She was somewhere in the city at this very\nmoment and if he really wanted to take the trouble he'd be able to find\nher easily enough--but he didn't want it to happen that way. She'd never\nreally be his again unless _she_ came to _him_....\n\nAnd so once more he found himself in the office late at night. Alone.\nPoring over the lab reports that had come in that afternoon, turning\nthem over in his mind and hoping, he supposed, for a nice intuitive\nflash, free of charge.\n\nAs a matter of fact the analysis of the vaccine he'd lifted from\nWilcox's dispensary was not without significance. There was definitely\nan extraneous substance. The only question was just what this substance\nmight be. Take a little longer to find that out, the report said.\n\nIt made Pell think of the corny sign World Government officials always\nhad on their desks, the one about doing the difficult right away and\ntaking a little longer for the impossible. Some day, when he was a\nbig-shot, he would have a sign on his desk saying: _Why make things\ndifficult when with even less effort you can make them impossible?_ Of\ncourse, ideas like that were probably the very reason he'd never be a\nbig-shot....\n\nThe Identifier humming. Someone coming again.\n\nHe looked up, and then had the curious feeling of being jerked back in\ntime to several nights ago. Chief Larkin and Theodor Rysland entered.\n\n\"Hello, Dick,\" said Larkin, with a touch of studied democracy. He\nglanced at the government adviser as if to say: _See? Knew we'd find him\nhere._\n\nPell made a sour face. \"Some day I'm going to stop giving all this free\novertime. Some day I'm not going to show up at all.\"\n\nRysland smiled, dislodging some of the rock strata of his curiously pale\nface. He seemed a little weary this evening. He moved slowly and with\neven more than his usual dignity. He said, \"I hope, Mr. Pell, that\nyou'll wait at least until you finish this job for us. I understand\nyou've made some progress.\"\n\nPell shrugged and gestured at the lab report. \"Progress, maybe--but I\ndon't know how far. Just a bunch of new puzzles to be perfectly frank.\"\n\nRysland sat down at the other desk and drummed on it with his\nfingertips. He looked at Pell gravely. \"As a matter of fact, since we\nlast talked to you the situation has become even more urgent. A\nSupremist congressman introduced a bill today before the world delegates\nwhich may prove very dangerous. Perhaps you know the one I refer to.\"\n\n\"I was too busy to follow the news today,\" said Pell, looking\nmeaningfully at Larkin.\n\nLarkin didn't seem to notice.\n\nRysland said, \"I'll brief you then. The bill purports to prohibit\nmaterial aid of any kind to a non-Terran government. That means both\ncredit and goods. And since the only real non-Terran government we know\nis Venus, it's obviously directed specifically at the Venusians.\"\n\nPell thought it over. High level stuff again. He nodded to show he\nfollowed.\n\n\"On the surface,\" continued Rysland, \"this would seem to be a sort of\nanti-espionage bill. Actually, it's a deliberately provocative act. I\nknow the Venusians will take it that way. But right now certain quarters\nare secretly trying to negotiate a trade treaty with Venus which would\nbe a major step toward peaceful relations. If this bill became law, such\na treaty would be impossible.\"\n\n\"But World Congress isn't likely to pass such a bill, is it? Won't they\nsee through it?\"\n\nRysland frowned. \"That's what we're not sure of. Messages are pouring in\nurging passage--all of them from Supremists, of course. The Supremists\nare relatively few, but they make a lot of noise. Sometimes noise like\nthat is effective. It could swing a lot of delegates who don't see the\nreal danger of this bill and are at the moment undecided. The Defender\nside, with its desire to isolate and fortify, is especially\nsusceptible.\"\n\n\"That _is_ bad,\" said Pell thoughtfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRysland put his palm on the desk. \"Now then, if we can somehow discredit\nthe Supremists--get to the bottom of this thing quickly enough--I'm sure\nthat bill will be killed. I came here tonight, I suppose, out of pure\nanxiety. In other words, Mr. Pell, just how far are you?\"\n\nPell smiled and shook his head. \"Not very, I'm afraid. This Supremist\nthing is the damndest I ever came across. No central headquarters, no\nofficers, no propaganda mill--entirely word of mouth as far as I can\nsee. No way of finding out how it started, or even how the new members\nare proselyted. Ask any member how he became a Supremist. He just looks\nkind of dreamy and mutters something about the truth suddenly dawning\nupon him one day.\"\n\n\"But don't you have any theories?\"\n\n\"I've got a hunch,\" Pell said, picking up the lab report.\n\nChief Larkin snorted softly. The snort said clearly enough that an\nefficient investigator didn't depend on hunches these days: he went\nafter something doggedly on the computer, or by other approved\ntechniques.\n\nPell pretended not to hear the snort. \"First of all we discovered that\nnearly all Supremists received some kind of an inoculation before they\nbecame Supremists. Then we found a whole village, one of those moon\nresort towns, that had gone over. There was the record of inoculation\nthere, too. I got hold of some of the vaccine and had the lab analyze\nit. It's mostly vaccine all right, but there _is_ a foreign substance in\nit. Listen.\" He read from the report: \"_Isolated point oh six four seven\ngrams unclassified crystal compound, apparently form of nucleotide\nenzyme. Further analysis necessary._\"\n\n\"You think this enzyme, or whatever it is, has something to do with it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. All I have is a pretty wild theory. To begin, when our\nlab can't analyze something right away, it's pretty rare--possibly even\nunknown to chemistry in general. Now it's just possible that this\nsubstance does something to the brain that makes a man into a Supremist,\nand that somebody's behind the whole thing, deliberately planting the\nstuff so that people here and there become injected with it.\"\n\n\"Pell.\" Larkin made a pained face. \"Really.\"\n\nPell shrugged. \"Well, as I say, it's a hunch, that's all.\"\n\n\"It's a pipe dream,\" said Larkin. \"I never heard of anything so\nfantastic.\"\n\n\"That's what folks said a couple of centuries ago when the Venusians\nwere first trying to make contact and their ships were sighted all over\nthe place. 'I never heard of anything so fantastic,' they all said.\"\n\nTheodor Rysland still looked interested. \"Granted there is some\nconnection between the Supremist mental state and this, er, enzyme. What\nthen, Mr. Pell?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Pell, stretching his legs out, \"I had an idea maybe your\nfriend Dr. Nebel could give us some help on that.\"\n\n\"Nebel?\"\n\n\"He's interested in this thing, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Nebel's a very public spirited man.\"\n\n\"Well, I understand he's one of the top psychobiologists in the country\ntoday. Seems to me this new enzyme, whatever it is, would be right up\nhis alley. Of course the lab should get to it eventually, but he might\ndo it a lot quicker.\"\n\nLarkin had been examining some statistical crime charts on the wall. He\nturned from them. \"Pell, does Kronski know about all these wild hunches\nof yours?\"\n\n\"I haven't talked with him about them yet. He left today before the lab\nreport came in. Why?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering,\" said Larkin evenly, \"whether I had two maniacs\nin my organization or only one.\"\n\nRysland, frowning, turned to the chief. \"I wouldn't be hasty, Larkin,\"\nhe said. \"Crazy as it sounds Pell may have something here.\"\n\nLarkin snorted again, and this time along with it he shook his head\nsadly.\n\n\"What's your next move then?\" Rysland asked Pell.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, first thing,\" Pell said, \"I'll take a sample of this\nstuff to Dr. Nebel and see what he can do with it. Of course the lab can\nkeep on working on it in the meantime.\"\n\n\"Don't you think you might do better to get busy on those computers?\"\nLarkin asked.\n\nPell shook his head. \"This hunch is too strong, Chief.\"\n\nRysland smiled, and got up. \"I'm inclined to put a little stock into\nthis man's hunches. He's done pretty well with them so far. I'd even say\nhe's pretty close to a solution of this thing--possibly.\"\n\nLarkin shrugged and started to look at the crime charts again.\n\nRysland held out his hand. \"Good night, Mr. Pell. You've encouraged me.\nLarkin and I are going topside for a little night cap before we turn in.\nLike to join us?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Pell. \"I'm sleepy. I want to get home and hit that\nsack.\"\n\n\"Very well. Good night again.\" The two men went toward the door.\n\nPell watched them quietly. He had lied. He wasn't sleepy at all. He just\nwanted to get home and sit by that viewer and hope, hope against hope,\nthat it would ring and that Ciel's lovely image would swirl into\nview....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the way home he was just the least bit tempted to go topside,\nhowever. He thought he might like to walk the broad, quiet boulevards\nunder the stars. His brain functioned better there. The tunnels were so\nclean and bright and sterile, so wonderfully functional and sensible,\nthat they oppressed him somehow. Maybe, he sometimes thought, he wasn't\nfit for this age. Maybe he should have been born a couple of hundred\nyears ago. But common sense told him that people in _that_ age must have\noften thought exactly the same thing to themselves.\n\nHe looked at his chrono and decided he had better go home.\n\nThe apartment, when he came to it, was cold and empty without Ciel. He\nbathed and tried to keep up his spirits by singing in his tuneless way,\nbut it didn't help.\n\nHe went back into the living room, selected a film from the library and\nslipped it into a lap projector. He sat down and tried to concentrate on\nthe film, a historical adventure about the days of the first moon\nrockets. He couldn't follow it.\n\nThe viewer rang.\n\nHe bounded from the chair as though he had triggered a high speed\nejection seat in a burning jet. He went to the viewer and flicked it on.\nThe plate shimmered, and then Ciel's image came into focus.\n\n\"_Baby!_\" He was certain his shout overmodulated every amp tube in the\nentire World City viewer system. But he felt better, wonderfully better,\nalready.\n\nShe was smiling. \"Hello, Dick.\"\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nAnd then they looked at each other in affectionate embarrassment for a\nmoment.\n\n\"One of us,\" said Pell, \"ought to have his script writer along.\"\n\n\"Dick, I don't know exactly how to say what I want to say....\"\n\n\"Don't. Don't say anything. Just pretend nothing ever happened. Just\ncome on home fast as you can.\"\n\n\"No, Dick. Not yet. I still want to talk about--well, everything. Dick,\nwe've got to reach some sort of compromise. There _must_ be a way.\"\n\n\"Come on home. We'll find a way.\"\n\n\"Not home. Too many memories there. Besides,\" she smiled a little, \"I\ndon't trust us alone together. You know what would happen. We wouldn't\nget _any_ talking done. Not any sensible talking anyway. You'd better\nmeet me someplace.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Okay. Where can I meet you?\"\n\n\"How about the Stardust Cafe?\"\n\n\"Again? That place didn't help us much the last time.\"\n\n\"I know, but it's the handiest. I'm sure we can find a quiet place. Out\non the terrace or something.\"\n\n\"Is there a terrace?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so. I'm sure there must be.\"\n\nHe looked at his chrono. \"All right, baby. Half an hour?\"\n\n\"Half an hour.\"\n\nWhen she clicked off he felt his heart pounding. He felt dizzy. He felt\nas though he had just taken a quart of meth at one jolt--intravenously.\nHe sang, more loudly and more off-key than ever. He went into the\nbedroom and started to get dressed again.\n\nIt wasn't until he was finishing the knot in his tie that the hunch hit\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was funny about that hunch. He would have said it came out of\nnowhere, and yet it must have broken from the bottom of his mind through\nsome kind of restraining layer into the conscious levels. He didn't\nremember thinking anything that might have brought it on--his mind was\nstrictly on Ciel. Maybe that was how it came through, with the attention\nof his conscious mind directed elsewhere.\n\nWith the hunch he heard Ciel's voice again, heard it very clearly,\nsaying: \"_I'm sure we can find a quiet place. Out on the terrace or\nsomething._\" And with that other things started to fall into place.\n\nAs he thought, and as the possibilities of his hunch fanned out to\nembrace other possibilities he became suddenly cold and sick inside. He\nfought the feeling. \"Got to go through with it,\" he muttered to himself.\n\"Got to.\"\n\nAs soon as he was dressed he took the tunnel cars to Station D-90,\nchanging twice. People were aboard at this hour, returning from the\nevening. Lots of men and women in uniform: the green of the\nlandfighters, the white of the seamen, the blue of the flyers, the\nsilver and black of the space force. Young people. Kids mostly: kids who\nhad never seen war, smelled death, heard the wounded scream. He hoped\nthey never would. But if his hunch was correct they might be dangerously\nnear to it right now.\n\nIf only he had time to call Kronski. He'd feel a lot safer....\n\nHe shook himself. Have to stop thinking about it. Proceed cautiously\nnow, and take each thing as it came. That was the only thing to do.\n\nHe went topside and stepped from the elevator kiosk into the night air.\nAhead he saw the bright globular sign of the Stardust Cafe. But he\ndidn't go toward it right away. He turned in the other direction, walked\nswiftly, and kept a sharp eye on the shadows. He turned off on a side\nstreet, circled a small park, and then crossed a sloping lawn toward the\nback of the night club. He headed for the light of the service entrance.\n\nA half-credit bill got him inside through the back entrance. He found\nthe door with the temporary sign saying: Marco the Mentalist. He\nknocked.\n\nMarco the Mentalist opened the door. He didn't look quite as tall\nface-to-face as he did out on the floor, nor quite as impressive. His\nface was still dark and faintly saturnine, but the jowls seemed a little\npuffier now, there was a faint network of capillaries around his\nnostrils and his eyes looked just the least bit weary and tired. In a\npleasant enough voice he said, \"Yes?\"\n\nPell showed his C.I.B. identification.\n\nMarco raised his eyebrows a little and said, \"Come inside, please.\"\nInside he found a chair for Pell. He sat across from him at his dressing\ntable, half-turned toward the room. \"I must get ready for my show in a\nlittle while. You understand that, of course.\"\n\nPell nodded. \"What's on my mind won't take long. First of all, I want to\nask a few questions about hypnotism. They may seem silly to you, or\nmaybe a little elementary, but I'd like you to answer 'em just the\nsame.\"\n\nMarco's eyebrows went a little bit higher and he said, \"Proceed.\"\n\n\"Okay. Question number one: can anybody be hypnotized against his will?\"\n\n\"Some can, some can't.\" Marco smiled. \"The average person, under average\ncircumstances--no. I appear in my act to hypnotize people against their\nwills. Actually, subconsciously, they _wish_ to be hypnotized, which is\nwhy they volunteer to let me try in the first place.\"\n\n\"Okay, number two. Is there any drug that can hypnotize a person?\"\n\nMarco frowned. \"Pentothal and several things _appear_ to do that. You\ncould argue it either way, whether the subject is actually hypnotized or\nnot. I believe post-hypnotic commands have been given to subjects under\nsodium pentothol and carried out, even back in the dark ages of\npsychiatry several hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"I've got one more really important question,\" Pell said then. \"I'd\nunderstood that somebody under hypnosis won't do anything against his\nmoral or ethical sense. An honest man, for instance, can't be forced to\nsteal. Is that true?\"\n\nMarco laughed and gestured with his graceful fingers. \"I don't think it\nis true. It was once believed to be, because hypnotic technique was not\nstrong enough. That is, the subject's hypnosis was not strong enough to\novercome a strong moral sense, which is actually a surface veneer on a\ndeeper, more brutal nature. But I think with deep enough hypnosis, and\nthe right kind of command, you can get a person to do most anything in\npost-hypnotic behavior--and of course not know why he _must_ do it, even\nknowing it's wrong. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"I hope I do.\" Then Pell leaned forward. \"And now I have a very great\nfavor to ask of you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I want you to put on a little special private performance for me, right\nhere and now.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand.\"\n\n\"You will, in about sixty seconds. Just listen carefully....\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n\nHe was late for his date with Ciel, of course. He glanced at his chrono\nas he entered the Stardust Cafe by the front door and saw that he was\ntwenty minutes late. However, this time he was certain Ciel wouldn't\ncomplain too vigorously.\n\nAgain the askarins were playing, and once more the green-skinned\nVenusian girls were doing their writhing, spasmodic, aphrodisiacal\ndance. It was remarkable how they could achieve such an effect of utter\nabandon and yet keep their faces blank and frozen. He looked around the\nrest of the room swiftly. Not so crowded tonight, and people were\ngenerally quieter. There were no oversexed spacemen clawing after the\ndancers on the floor.\n\nCiel was again in a rear booth, in the same corner of the room she had\nchosen before. She had spotted him now; she was looking his way. She\nlifted a white-gloved hand and waved.\n\nHe smiled and headed for her. He forced his smile, and made himself\nforget the prickling of his wrists and the feeling of bristling fur\nalong his spine. And he held his smile all the way across the room.\n_Why, hello, darling, fancy seeing you here; no, nothing's wrong,\nnothing at all, why on earth would you think anything was wrong?_\n\n\"Hi, baby,\" was all he actually said.\n\n\"I'm--I'm glad you're here, Dick.\" Her eyes didn't show much. They roved\nover his face a little too much perhaps, but otherwise they seemed\nsimply as large and dark as ever. He noticed that the meth glass in\nfront of her was empty.\n\nGrinning, he sat down. \"This is a big moment. This is almost too much\nfor me to handle. Maybe that's what I need--a good slug of meth.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Let's not waste time. Let's go out on the terrace. I want you to kiss\nme.\"\n\n\"Best offer I've had all evening.\" He rose again. \"Where's the terrace?\"\n\n\"Through that door. There's a dining room there that's closed at night.\nYou go through the dining room and out to the terrace.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nHe took her arm and led her in and out of tables, across the room. They\nmoved swiftly through the quiet, nearly dark dining room, and after that\nthrough a pair of window-doors. They were on the terrace then, a\nflagstoned space with a low wall. It overlooked the scattered lights of\nWorld City's topside area and some distance beyond they could see the\nriver, a blue-silver ribbon in the moonlight.\n\nThey stopped at the wall. She turned toward him. He looked down at her,\nat her pale face and deep, dark eyes. He smelled her perfume and he felt\nher live warmth near him and coming nearer. He saw her eyes close, her\nlips part just slightly, and each lip glistening, faintly moist....\n\nHe was wondering when it would happen. He was wondering when he would be\nstruck.\n\nAs he wondered that he suddenly discovered he wasn't on the terrace any\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked about him in some surprise. It was nearly dark. He was in a\nroom; he could sense the walls about him. He heard a curious,\nhigh-pitched metallic voice--and recognized it.\n\n\"_Pell? Are you awake now?_\"\n\nIt had happened then, just as he had expected. Someone had thrown a\nfreezer on him there in the patio, and during his complete\nunconsciousness he'd been taken here, wherever this was. He sighed. The\nleast they could have done would have been to let him finish kissing\nCiel.\n\nAs calmly as he could he said to the four blank walls, \"I'm awake.\"\n\nSoft glowlights came on gradually and he saw that the room about him was\nfairly small--twenty by fifteen, roughly--and very plain. It contained a\nbed and a few odd pieces of furniture, all apparently of good quality.\nThere was a door in one wall. He tried the door. Locked. He went back to\nthe middle of the room.\n\n\"Chief,\" he said to the blank walls, \"what's this all about? Is it some\nkind of a joke?\"\n\nThe metallic voice chuckled. It belonged to Eustace J. Larkin, Chief,\nCentral Investigation Bureau, and even filtered like this it was\nsomewhat prim and precise. \"No, Dick, it's not a joke, I'm afraid. I'm\nsurprised you haven't guessed what it's all about. Or at least had one\nof your brilliant hunches.\" There was sarcasm in this last.\n\n\"Where's Ciel?\" Pell asked.\n\n\"Right here with me. In the next room. Here--listen.\"\n\nCiel's voice said, \"Don't worry, darling, we'll explain everything. And\nwhen it's all over it will be for the best. You'll see that it will.\"\n\n\"All right, everybody,\" said Pell, half-belligerently, \"what's the big\nidea?\"\n\n\"Big idea is right,\" Larkin's voice came back. \"The biggest that ever\nhit the human race. And as Ciel says we'll explain it all in a moment.\nBut first I'd like your word that you won't be foolish and make any kind\nof a struggle. If you'll promise that you can come in the other room\nhere and we can all talk face to face.\"\n\nPell frowned. \"I don't know--I'm not so sure I can honestly promise\nthat.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself, then. A few minutes from now it won't make any\ndifference anyway.\"\n\n\"Will you stop being so damned mysterious and tell me what it's all\nabout?\"\n\nLarkin's voice laughed. \"Very well. I haven't had much chance to tell\nabout it, frankly. And I think you'll agree we've rather neatly kept our\nparts under cover--until you got dangerously close to the answer,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Until I got close?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Doc Wilcox's office on the moon was perhaps our one weakness\nin the whole set-up. How you managed to stumble on to that, I'll never\nknow--your luck must have been with you.\"\n\n\"It wasn't luck, Larkin, it was a hunch.\"\n\n\"Still believe in hunches, eh? Well, we won't argue the point. At any\nrate you wouldn't have found the enzyme any place else but there.\"\n\n\"Oh, so the enzyme does have something to do with it.\"\n\n\"Everything. Here--suppose I let Doctor Nebel explain it to you. He\ndeveloped it, after all.\"\n\nPell lifted his eyebrows in surprise and Dr. Walter Nebel's sibilant\nvoice came through the hidden speakers. \"I think you should know how it\nworks, Mr. Pell. You may know that a certain part of the brain called\nRossi's area is, to put it figuratively, the hypnotic center. The\ncut-off of the adrenal cortex, so to speak. In ordinary hypnosis the\nfunction of that area is dulled by overexercising the motor senses. By\nthat method the intensity of hypnosis is widely variable and never\nreally one hundred per cent effective. My compound, however, brings\nabout complete and absolute cut-off. Any post-hypnotic suggestion given\nunder those circumstances takes permanently and deeply. It can only be\nremoved by further post-hypnosis under the same treatment, negating the\noriginal command.\"\n\nPell stared at the blank walls. \"Go on,\" he said in a soft, tense voice.\n\"What's the rest?\"\n\nLarkin spoke again. \"Suppose we briefly examine a little history as a\nkind of introduction to this matter. The human race, since the beginning\nof recorded time, has failed to achieve real peace and stability, right?\nEvery time there has been a chance for cooperative effort--for total\nagreement--certain selfish interests have spoiled it. There have been\ntimes, however, when certain groups--states or combinations of\nstates--came close to permanent peace and prosperity. The Napoleonic era\nwas one. Hitler two hundred years ago almost brought it about. The only\nreason they failed was that they didn't achieve their goal--_complete_\nconquest.\"\n\n_Did Pell hear correctly? Was there a faint simmering of madness in that\nmetallic voice now?_ In the words there was madness, surely....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt went on: \"The fact is, Pell, people simply don't know what's good for\nthem. Look at the blunderers and even downright crooks who are elected\nto World Government. Never the best brains, never the best talents. When\na really able man gets into a position of leadership it's an accident--a\nfluke.\"\n\n\"I still don't see what all this has got to do with it,\" said Pell.\n\nThere was a shrug in the metallic voice. \"For once the ablest men are\ngoing to take over. There are a number of us. You know already about\nmyself and Doctor Nebel. Rysland will be with us, too, as soon as we can\nget him conditioned.\"\n\n\"By conditioned, you mean this enzyme of yours?\"\n\n\"Exactly. We started out in a small way, using force or trickery where\nnecessary, and managed to condition a number of doctors and nurses.\nConditioning simply means injecting Nebel's compound and then giving the\npost-hypnotic command to be unquestioningly loyal to the Supremists. We\ncreated the Supremists, of course. In order for us to take over it will\nbe necessary to have another war, and to conquer Venus. That can be done\nif Earth strikes quickly. Within the next few days I think there'll be\nenough Supremist influence to get this war started.\"\n\nPell stared back, open-mouthed. To hear it coldly and calmly like this\nwas shock, cold-water shock. \"Let me get this straight now. Your group\nmade Supremists of doctors and nurses and they in turn made new members\nby installing this hypnosis stuff whenever anybody came for a hypodermic\ninjection of any kind, is that it?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n\"But how does this stuff work? Does it knock you out, or what?\"\n\n\"You'll be finding that out at first hand very shortly.\"\n\nPell stiffened, made fists and unconsciously lifted them and looked\naround him, warily.\n\nLarkin laughed. \"It won't do you much good to put up a fight. I'm\nsending a couple of my assistants in there. They specialize in people\nwho want to make a struggle. And there's no reason to feel unhappy about\nit, Pell: once you're conditioned you'll simply be unable to do anything\nagainst the Supremist cause. You'll be happier, in fact, having such a\ncause. Ask your wife if that isn't so.\"\n\nPell trembled with anger. \"How did you get to her? How did you make her\ndo what she did?\"\n\n\"You mean luring you into our little trap on the terrace, so to speak?\nYou mustn't blame Ciel for that. She couldn't help herself; she had to\nobey, after all. You see she was conditioned in Augea on the moon by Dr.\nWilcox, one of our very loyal men. He simply dropped in when you were at\nthe Post Office, pretended that Ciel needed a routine injection and she,\nnot at all suspicious, allowed him to do it. He gave her the command of\nloyalty, and also cautioned her not to say anything about it. So you\nsee, Ciel's been one of us for several days. It was just a little\nprecaution of mine, in case you should become troublesome. I had to\nassign somebody to the investigation, of course, because Rysland and his\ncrowd would have been too suspicious if I hadn't complied with their\nrequest.\"\n\n\"You're stark crazy, Larkin! You ought to be in a mental hospital!\"\n\n\"You'll be over that idea in a minute or so. Meanwhile, we're wasting\ntime. I'm sending the boys in now. You'll make it easier for yourself if\nyou submit without giving them any trouble.\"\n\nThe door opened, then. Pell caught a quick glimpse of the other room and\nsaw that it was a tastefully furnished living room. He recognized it,\nand knew where he was. This was a country house of Larkin's, topside,\nnot far from the outskirts of World City. Whoever turned the freezer on\nhim must have set the control at high intensity because it would take at\nleast an hour to get to this place from the Stardust Cafe and he had\nbeen unconscious at least that long.\n\nHe had the momentary impulse to rush that partly opened door--and then\nthe boys, as Larkin had called them, appeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were specialists, little doubt of that. They regarded Pell with\nflat, almost disinterested looks as the door closed behind them. One\nheld a hypodermic needle. He was the shorter of the two, but he had\nshoulders like ox-yokes. His face had been kneaded in the prize ring,\nand his bare arms were muscular and hairy but the top of his head was\nbald. The other had red hair, close-cropped. He was big and\nwell-proportioned; Pell might have taken him for a professional football\nplayer.\n\nRed did the talking. He spoke quietly, almost pleasantly. \"Gonna\ncooperate?\" he asked Pell.\n\nPell said, \"You touch me, brother, and I'll make your face look like\nBaldy's.\"\n\nRed glanced at Baldy and seemed to sigh. Abruptly he whirled, jumped at\nPell and brought a sizzling right hand punch through the air. Pell\nducked it. He saw Baldy move in as he did so, and a painful blow struck\nthe back of his neck. His teeth rattled when it struck. Something caught\nhim under the chin, straightened him. When he was straight a pile driver\nstruck him in the midsection.\n\nIt was all over within a matter of seconds. Under different\ncircumstances Pell might have found time to admire their technique.\n\nAs it was, he was now face down on the floor and Red was straddling him,\nholding him there. The pain in his stomach made him gasp. His face and\nthe back of his neck ached terribly.\n\nRed had his arm in the small of his back. Pell tried to struggle.\n\n\"I can break the arm if you move,\" said Red cheerfully.\n\nAnd then Pell felt the bite of the needle just below his shoulder.\n\nA misty feeling came. He felt as though he were in a red whirlpool,\nspinning, going down--down.... He fought to rise. He could still hear.\nHe could hear footsteps and the slam of the door when somebody else came\ninto the room. And then he seemed abruptly to be detached from his own\nbody and floating in a huge gray void....\n\nWords hammered at his brain. Larkin's voice, at his ear now and no\nlonger metallic. \"_You will be loyal to the Supremist cause. You will do\nnothing against the Supremist doctrine. You will believe that Earthmen\nare meant to rule the Universe--_\"\n\nHe felt an overpowering impulse to nod, to agree, to believe that it was\nright to do this. He fought this impulse, straining his mind and his\nvery being until it seemed that something might burst with the effort.\n\n\"_You will work for the cause; you will give your life for it if\nnecessary._\"\n\nYes, perhaps it was better to succumb. The words were too strong. He\ncouldn't fight them. Larkin was right, Earthmen were supreme, and they\nwere destined to rule....\n\nSomewhere in the depths a tiny spot of resistance still glowed. He tried\ndesperately to evoke it. It seemed then that it became brighter. He\n_could_ resist--he _would_.... He kept thinking over and over again:\n\"_No, no, no!_\"\n\nLarkin's voice said, \"Carry him in the other room. He'll come to in a\nmoment.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe came to slowly, and he saw that he was lying on a couch and that\nseveral people were gathered around him smiling down at him. Something\ndetached itself from the group, knelt by his side. He blinked. It was\nCiel. Her golden hair shone and her dark eyes searched his face and she\nwas smiling. \"Hello, darling,\" she said.\n\n\"Hello, Ciel.\" He kissed her, and then sat up on the couch and looked\naround.\n\nLarkin and Dr. Nebel were standing together, and Red and Baldy were a\nfew steps behind them, still looking indifferent.\n\n\"Now you're one of us, Dick,\" said Larkin, flashing his professional\nsmile, dimples and everything. Pell rose. Nebel held his hands behind\nhis back and beamed, blinking his heavy reptilian eyelids and Larkin\nstepped forward and held out his hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pell, shaking the hand, \"I guess we're all working for the\nsame thing now. What do you want me to do?\"\n\nLarkin laughed. \"Nothing right away. We'll give you instructions when\nthe time comes. I think you might as well go home with Ciel now; I have\na copter and a chauffeur outside that'll take you to the station near\nyour apartment.\"\n\n\"Okay, Chief, whatever you say.\" He smiled and took Ciel's arm. He\nstarted toward the door. Then he stopped, patted his chest and said,\n\"Oh--my freezer. I guess the boys took it away....\"\n\nLarkin turned to Baldy. \"Give him his weapon.\"\n\nBaldy took the freezer from his pocket and casually tossed it to Pell.\n\nA sudden change came over Pell, then. His smile disappeared. He stepped\nquickly away from Ciel, whirled and faced all of them. He pointed the\nfreezer. \"All right, everybody stay perfectly still--you, too, Ciel.\nThis is where we break up your little Supremist nightmare.\"\n\nLarkin stared in utter amazement. Nebel's turtle lids opened wide. Ciel\nbrought her hand to her throat.\n\nRed's hand blurred suddenly, going for his own weapon. Pell squeezed the\ntrigger, the violet sparks danced for an instant, and then Red stood\nfrozen with his hand almost to his chest.\n\n\"I'd advise nobody else to try that,\" said Pell, and then in an ironical\ntone to Larkin: \"C.I.B. agents are trained to be pretty quick with a\nfreezer, right, Chief?\"\n\nLarkin seemed to find his voice now. \"But--how--what happened? You were\ninjected. How can you....\"\n\n\"I just took a little precaution, that's all,\" said Pell. \"There'll be\nplenty of time to explain it all later. You'll probably hear the whole\nthing in court, Larkin, when I testify at your trial for treason.\nMeanwhile, all of you just stay nice and calm while I use the viewer.\"\n\nHe stepped to the viewer and dialed with his free hand. The plate\nglowed, shimmered and a moment later the pale, grave face of Theodor\nRysland came into view. His eyebrows rose as he saw the weapon in Pell's\nhand and glimpsed the people beyond Pell. \"Hello--what's this all\nabout?\"\n\n\"Haven't time to explain fully now,\" said Pell, \"but I want you to get\nto Larkin's country house as soon as you can. I'll call agent Kronski in\na moment and have him bring some others, and together we'll take Larkin\nand Nebel into custody. They're behind the Supremist movement--a\ndeliberate attempt to take over the government. They did it with a drug;\nthat's how Supremist's are made.\"\n\n\"What's this? A drug?\"\n\n\"Think about it later,\" said Pell. \"Just grab the facts right now. The\ndrug makes a person subject to post-hypnotic commands--that's why your\nSupremists are blindly, unthinkingly loyal. However, the command can be\nerased by a second treatment. That'll be tough and take a lot of\nferreting out, but it won't be impossible.\" He glanced at Ciel, and saw\nthat she was staring at him with horror--with enmity. It sickened him,\nbut he steadied himself with the realization that Ciel would be one of\nthe first to be re-treated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral minutes later he had completed his calls. Rysland, Kronski and\nthe others were on the way. He kept the freezer pointed, and watched his\ncaptives carefully. Ciel had gone over to the couch and was sitting\nthere, her face in her hands, weeping softly.\n\n\"I don't know how you did it,\" said Larkin. \"I don't understand it. The\ninjection should have worked. It always did before.\"\n\n\"Well, it almost worked,\" said Pell. \"I must admit I had quite a time\nfighting off your commands. But, you see, I knew you'd gotten to Ciel\nsomehow when she called me up to make the date this evening. She spoke\nof going out to the terrace at the Stardust Cafe. It was a little odd\nthat she should speak of the terrace like that, out of a clear sky--and\nI wondered why it should be on her mind. Then it struck me that neither\nof us had ever noticed a terrace there, and Ciel must have some special\nreason for knowing about it.\n\n\"She did, of course--she'd been instructed to get me out there where\nyour boys could slap a freezer on me. So I started guessing with that\nhunch to work on. Everything more or less fell into place after that. It\nwas pretty certain that they'd try to make a loyal Supremist out of me,\ntoo, and that's when I took that little precaution I mentioned to you.\"\n\n\"What precaution?\"\n\nPell smiled. \"I had Marco the mentalist hypnotize me and give me a\nrather special post-hypnotic command. He ordered me not to believe any\n_subsequent_ post-hypnotic commands. That's why your conditioning didn't\nwork on me.\"\n\nLarkin could find no words; he just stared.\n\n\"Think about it, Larkin,\" said Pell. \"Think hard. Maybe you'd convinced\nyourself you were doing good, but your purpose was still tyranny. And\nlike any tyranny it contained the means of its own destruction. It\nalways works out that way, Larkin--maybe it's a law, or something.\"\n\nIt had been a long speech for Pell, practically an oration. He was,\nafter all, a cop, not a philosopher. Just a guy trying to get along.\nJust an ordinary citizen whose name was legion, looking at his wife now\nand waiting with what patience he could find for the time when she would\nbe cleared of the poisonous doctrine that any one race or group or even\nspecies was supreme.\n\nHe was thinking, too, that the trial would keep him busy as the very\ndevil and that they _still_ wouldn't get to that vacation and second\nhoneymoon for a long time....\n\nThat, considering everything, was not too much to put up with.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Brink of Madness, by Walter J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
