WELLS\n\n                                  1899\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION\n\n_When the Sleeper Wakes_, whose title I have now altered to _The Sleeper\nAwakes_, was first published as a book in 1899 after a serial appearance\nin the _Graphic_ and one or two American and colonial periodicals. It is\none of the most ambitious and least satisfactory of my books, and I have\ntaken the opportunity afforded by this reprinting to make a number of\nexcisions and alterations. Like most of my earlier work, it was written\nunder considerable pressure; there are marks of haste not only in the\nwriting of the latter part, but in the very construction of the story.\nExcept for certain streaks of a slovenliness which seems to be an almost\nunavoidable defect in me, there is little to be ashamed of in the writing\nof the opening portion; but it will be fairly manifest to the critic that\ninstead of being put aside and thought over through a leisurely\ninterlude, the ill-conceived latter part was pushed to its end. I was at\nthat time overworked, and badly in need of a holiday. In addition to\nvarious necessary journalistic tasks, I had in hand another book, _Love\nand Mr. Lewisham_, which had taken a very much stronger hold upon my\naffections than this present story. My circumstances demanded that one or\nother should be finished before I took any rest, and so I wound up the\nSleeper sufficiently to make it a marketable work, hoping to be able to\nrevise it before the book printers at any rate got hold of it. But\nfortune was against me. I came back to England from Italy only to fall\ndangerously ill, and I still remember the impotent rage and strain of my\nattempt to put some sort of finish to my story of Mr. Lewisham, with my\ntemperature at a hundred and two. I couldn't endure the thought of\nleaving that book a fragment. I did afterwards contrive to save it from\nthe consequences of that febrile spurt--_Love and Mr. Lewisham_ is indeed\none of my most carefully balanced books--but the Sleeper escaped me.\n\nIt is twelve years now since the Sleeper was written, and that young man\nof thirty-one is already too remote for me to attempt any very drastic\nreconstruction of his work. I have played now merely the part of an\neditorial elder brother: cut out relentlessly a number of long tiresome\npassages that showed all too plainly the fagged, toiling brain, the heavy\nsluggish _driven_ pen, and straightened out certain indecisions at the\nend. Except for that, I have done no more than hack here and there at\nclumsy phrases and repetitions. The worst thing in the earlier version,\nand the thing that rankled most in my mind, was the treatment of the\nrelations of Helen Wotton and Graham. Haste in art is almost always\nvulgarisation, and I slipped into the obvious vulgarity of making what\nthe newspaper syndicates call a \"love interest\" out of Helen. There was\neven a clumsy intimation that instead of going up in the flying-machine\nto fight, Graham might have given in to Ostrog, and married Helen. I have\nnow removed the suggestion of these uncanny connubialities. Not the\nslightest intimation of any sexual interest could in truth have arisen\nbetween these two. They loved and kissed one another, but as a girl and\nher heroic grandfather might love, and in a crisis kiss. I have found it\npossible, without any very serious disarrangement, to clear all that\nobjectionable stuff out of the story, and so a little ease my conscience\non the score of this ungainly lapse. I have also, with a few strokes of\nthe pen, eliminated certain dishonest and regrettable suggestions that\nthe People beat Ostrog. My Graham dies, as all his kind must die, with no\ncertainty of either victory or defeat.\n\nWho will win--Ostrog or the People? A thousand years hence that will\nstill be just the open question we leave to-day.\n\nH.G. WELLS.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n       I. INSOMNIA\n\n      II. THE TRANCE\n\n     III.

Halfway down the precipitous path to\nthe Pentargen beach he came suddenly upon a man sitting in an attitude of\nprofound distress beneath a projecting mass of rock. The hands of this\nman hung limply over his knees, his eyes were red and staring before him,\nand his face was wet with tears.\n\nHe glanced round at Isbister's footfall. Both men were disconcerted,\nIsbister the more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his involuntary\npause, he remarked, with an air of mature conviction, that the weather\nwas hot for the time of year.\n\n\"Very,\" answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a second, and added in a\ncolourless tone, \"I can't sleep.\"\n\nIsbister stopped abruptly. \"No?\" was all he said, but his bearing\nconveyed his helpful impulse.\n\n\"It may sound incredible,\" said the stranger, turning weary eyes to\nIsbister's face and emphasizing his words with a languid hand, \"but I\nhave had no sleep--no sleep at all for six nights.\"\n\n\"Had advice?\"\n\n\"Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My nervous system.... They are\nall very well for the run of people. It's hard to explain. I dare not\ntake ... sufficiently powerful drugs.\"\n\n\"That makes it difficult,\" said Isbister.\n\nHe stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do. Clearly the\nman wanted to talk. An idea natural enough under the circumstances,\nprompted him to keep the conversation going. \"I've never suffered from\nsleeplessness myself,\" he said in a tone of commonplace gossip, \"but in\nthose cases I have known, people have usually found something--\"\n\n\"I dare make no experiments.\"\n\nHe spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space both\nmen were silent.\n\n\"Exercise?\" suggested Isbister diffidently, with a glance from his\ninterlocutor's face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore.\n\n\"That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I have followed the coast,\nday after day--from New Quay. It has only added muscular fatigue to the\nmental. The cause of this unrest was overwork--trouble. There was\nsomething--\"\n\nHe stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his forehead with a lean\nhand. He resumed speech like one who talks to himself.\n\n\"I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through a world in which I\nhave no part. I am wifeless--childless--who is it speaks of the childless\nas the dead twigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless, childless--I could\nfind no duty to do. No desire even in my heart. One thing at last I set\nmyself to do.\n\n\"I said, I _will_ do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this\ndull body, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I've had enough of drugs! I\ndon't know if _you_ feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its\nexasperating demand of time from the mind--time--life! Live! We only live\nin patches. We have to eat, and then comes the dull digestive\ncomplacencies--or irritations. We have to take the air or else our\nthoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and blind alleys. A\nthousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes\ndrowsiness and sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a man's\nday is his own--even at the best! And then come those false friends,\nthose Thug helpers, the alkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill\nrest--black coffee, cocaine--\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"I did my work,\" said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation.\n\n\"And this is the price?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor a little while the two remained without speaking.\n\n\"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel--a hunger and\nthirst. For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a\nwhirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts\nleading nowhere, spinning round swift and steady--\" He paused. \"Towards\nthe gulf.\"\n\n\"You must sleep,\" said Isbister decisively, and with an air of a remedy\ndiscovered. \"Certainly you must sleep.\"\n\n\"My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer. But I know I am\ndrawing towards the vortex. Presently--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light of the day, out\nof this sweet world of sanity--down--\"\n\n\"But,\" expostulated Isbister.\n\nThe man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and his\nvoice suddenly high. \"I shall kill myself. If in no other way--at the\nfoot of yonder dark precipice there, where the waves are green, and the\nwhite surge lifts and falls, and that little thread of water trembles\ndown. There at any rate is ... sleep.\"\n\n\"That's unreasonable,\" said Isbister, startled at the man's hysterical\ngust of emotion. \"Drugs are better than that.\"\n\n\"There at any rate is sleep,\" repeated the stranger, not heeding him.\n\nIsbister looked at him. \"It's not a cert, you know,\" he remarked.\n\"There's a cliff like that at Lulworth Cove--as high, anyhow--and a\nlittle girl fell from top to bottom. And lives to-day--sound and well.\"\n\n\"But those rocks there?\"\n\n\"One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night, broken bones\ngrating as one shivered, chill water splashing over you. Eh?\"\n\nTheir eyes met. \"Sorry to upset your ideals,\" said Isbister with a sense\nof devil-may-careish brilliance. \"But a suicide over that cliff (or any\ncliff for the matter of that), really, as an artist--\" He laughed. \"It's\nso damned amateurish.\"\n\n\"But the other thing,\" said the sleepless man irritably, \"the other\nthing. No man can keep sane if night after night--\"\n\n\"Have you been walking along this coast alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Silly sort of thing to do. If you'll excuse my saying so. Alone! As you\nsay; body fag is no cure for brain fag. Who told you to? No wonder;\nwalking! And the sun on your head, heat, fag, solitude, all the day long,\nand then, I suppose, you go to bed and try very hard--eh?\"\n\nIsbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.\n\n\"Look at these rocks!\" cried the seated man with a sudden force of\ngesture. \"Look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever!\nSee the white spume rush into darkness under that great cliff. And this\nblue vault, with the blinding sun pouring from the dome of it. It is your\nworld. You accept it, you rejoice in it. It warms and supports and\ndelights you. And for me--\"\n\nHe turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes and\nbloodless lips. He spoke almost in a whisper. \"It is the garment of my\nmisery. The whole world ... is the garment of my misery.\"\n\nIsbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them\nand back to that face of despair. For a moment he was silent.\n\nHe started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. \"You get a\nnight's sleep,\" he said, \"and you won't see much misery out here. Take\nmy word for it.\"\n\nHe was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter. Only half\nan hour ago he had been feeling horribly bored. Here was employment the\nbare thought of which, was righteous self-applause. He took possession\nforthwith. The first need of this exhausted being was companionship. He\nflung himself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the motionless\nseated figure, and threw out a skirmishing line of gossip.\n\nHis hearer lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally seaward, and spoke only\nin answer to Isbister's direct questions--and not to all of those. But he\nmade no objection to this benevolent intrusion upon his despair.\n\nHe seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister, feeling that his\nunsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that they should reascend\nthe steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging the view into Blackapit,\nhe submitted quietly. Halfway up he began talking to himself, and\nabruptly turned a ghastly face on his helper. \"What can be happening?\" he\nasked with a gaunt illustrative hand. \"What can be happening? Spin, spin,\nspin, spin. It goes round and round, round and round for evermore.\"\n\nHe stood with his hand circling.\n\n\"It's all right, old chap,\" said Isbister with the air of an old friend.\n\"Don't worry yourself. Trust to me,\"\n\nThe man dropped his hand and turned again. They went over the brow and to\nthe headland beyond Penally, with the sleepless man gesticulating ever\nand again, and speaking fragmentary things concerning his whirling brain.\nAt the headland they stood by the seat that looks into the dark mysteries\nof Blackapit, and then he sat down. Isbister had resumed his talk\nwhenever the path had widened sufficiently for them to walk abreast. He\nwas enlarging upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle Harbour in\nbad weather, when suddenly and quite irrelevantly his companion\ninterrupted him again.\n\n\"My head is not like what it was,\" he said, gesticulating for want of\nexpressive phrases. \"It's not like what it was. There is a sort of\noppression, a weight. No--not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like\na shadow, a deep shadow falling suddenly and swiftly across something\nbusy. Spin, spin into the darkness. The tumult of thought, the confusion,\nthe eddy and eddy. I can't express it. I can hardly keep my mind on\nit--steadily enough to tell you.\"\n\nHe stopped feebly.\n\n\"Don't trouble, old chap,\" said Isbister. \"I think I can understand. At\nany rate, it don't matter very much just at present about telling me,\nyou know.\"\n\nThe sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them.\nIsbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had\na fresh idea. \"Come down to my room,\" he said, \"and try a pipe. I can\nshow you some sketches of this Blackapit. If you'd care?\"\n\nThe other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.\n\nSeveral times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his\nmovements were slow and hesitating. \"Come in with me,\" said\nIsbister, \"and try some cigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol.\nIf you take alcohol?\"\n\nThe stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He seemed no longer aware of\nhis actions. \"I don't drink,\" he said slowly, coming up the garden path,\nand after a moment's interval repeated absently, \"No--I don't drink. It\ngoes round. Spin, it goes--spin--\"\n\nHe stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one\nwho sees nothing.\n\nThen he sat down heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost to fall into\nit. He leant forward with his brows on his hands and became motionless.\nPresently he made a faint sound in his throat.\n\nIsbister moved about the room with the nervousness of an inexperienced\nhost, making little remarks that scarcely required answering. He\ncrossed the room to his portfolio, placed it on the table and noticed\nthe mantel clock.\n\n\"I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me,\" he said with an\nunlighted cigarette in his hand--his mind troubled with ideas of a\nfurtive administration of chloral. \"Only cold mutton, you know, but\npassing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe.\" He repeated this after\nmomentary silence.\n\nThe seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped, match in hand,\nregarding him.\n\nThe stillness lengthened. The match went out, the cigarette was put down\nunlit. The man was certainly very still. Isbister took up the portfolio,\nopened it, put it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak. \"Perhaps,\" he\nwhispered doubtfully. Presently he glanced at the door and back to the\nfigure. Then he stole on tiptoe out of the room, glancing at his\ncompanion after each elaborate pace.\n\nHe closed the door noiselessly. The house door was standing open, and\nhe went out beyond the porch, and stood where the monkshood rose at the\ncorner of the garden bed. From this point he could see the stranger\nthrough the open window, still and dim, sitting head on hand. He had\nnot moved.\n\nA number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the artist\ncuriously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt that possibly\nhis circumspect attitude and position looked peculiar and unaccountable.\nSmoking, perhaps, might seem more natural. He drew pipe and pouch from\nhis pocket, filled the pipe slowly.\n\n\"I wonder,\" ... he said, with a scarcely perceptible loss of\ncomplacency. \"At any rate one must give him a chance.\" He struck a match\nin the virile way, and proceeded to light his pipe.\n\nHe heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit from the\nkitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped her at the\ndoor of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in explaining the\nsituation in whispers, for she did not know he had a visitor. She\nretreated again with the lamp, still a little mystified to judge from her\nmanner, and he resumed his hovering at the corner of the porch, flushed\nand less at his ease.\n\nLong after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad,\ncuriosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back into his\ndarkling sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger was still\nin the same attitude, dark against the window. Save for the singing of\nsome sailors aboard one of the little slate-carrying ships in the harbour\nthe evening was very still. Outside, the spikes of monkshood and\ndelphinium stood erect and motionless against the shadow of the hillside.\nSomething flashed into Isbister's mind; he started, and leaning over the\ntable, listened. An unpleasant suspicion grew stronger; became\nconviction. Astonishment seized him and became--dread!\n\nNo sound of breathing came from the seated figure!\n\nHe crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to listen.\nAt last he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair. He bent down\nuntil the two heads were ear to ear.\n\nThen he bent still lower to look up at his visitor's face. He started\nviolently and uttered an exclamation. The eyes were void spaces of white.\n\nHe looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled\nunder the lids. He was afraid. He took the man by the shoulder and shook\nhim. \"Are you asleep?\" he said, with his voice jumping, and again, \"Are\nyou asleep?\"\n\nA conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead. He\nbecame active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering against the\ntable as he did so, and rang the bell.\n\n\"Please bring a light at once,\" he said in the passage. \"There is\nsomething wrong with my friend.\"\n\nHe returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder, shook\nit, shouted. The room was flooded with yellow glare as his landlady\nentered with the light. His face was white as he turned blinking towards\nher. \"I must fetch a doctor,\" he said. \"It is either death or a fit. Is\nthere a doctor in the village? Where is a doctor to be found?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE TRANCE\n\n\nThe state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted for\nan unprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to the flaccid\nstate, to a lax attitude suggestive of profound repose. Then it was his\neyes could be closed.\n\nHe was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the\nsurgery, after some weeks, to London. But he still resisted every attempt\nat reanimation. After a time, for reasons that will appear later, these\nattempts were discontinued. For a great space he lay in that strange\ncondition, inert and still--neither dead nor living but, as it were,\nsuspended, hanging midway between nothingness and existence. His was a\ndarkness unbroken by a ray of thought or sensation, a dreamless\ninanition, a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mind had swelled and\nrisen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the man? Where is any man\nwhen insensibility takes hold of him?\n\n\"It seems only yesterday,\" said Isbister. \"I remember it all as though it\nhappened yesterday--clearer, perhaps, than if it had happened yesterday.\"\n\nIt was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a young\nman. The hair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the\nfashionable length, was iron grey and clipped close, and the face that\nhad been pink and white was buff and ruddy. He had a pointed beard shot\nwith grey. He talked to an elderly man who wore a summer suit of drill\n(the summer of that year was unusually hot). This was Warming, a London\nsolicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man who had fallen into the\ntrance. And the two men stood side by side in a room in a house in London\nregarding his recumbent figure.\n\nIt was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing\nshirt, a figure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and\nlank nails, and about it was a case of thin glass. This glass seemed to\nmark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him, he was a thing\napart, a strange, isolated abnormality. The two men stood close to the\nglass, peering in.\n\n\"The thing gave me a shock,\" said Isbister. \"I feel a queer sort of\nsurprise even now when I think of his white eyes. They were white, you\nknow, rolled up. Coming here again brings it all back to me.\"\n\n\"Have you never seen him since that time?\" asked Warming.\n\n\"Often wanted to come,\" said Isbister; \"but business nowadays is too\nserious a thing for much holiday keeping. I've been in America most of\nthe time.\"\n\n\"If I remember rightly,\" said Warming, \"you were an artist?\"\n\n\"Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was all up with black and\nwhite, very soon--at least for a mediocrity, and I jumped on to process.\nThose posters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people.\"\n\n\"Good posters,\" admitted the solicitor, \"though I was sorry to see\nthem there.\"\n\n\"Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary,\" exclaimed Isbister with\nsatisfaction. \"The world changes. When he fell asleep, twenty years ago,\nI was down at Boscastle with a box of water-colours and a noble,\nold-fashioned ambition. I didn't expect that some day my pigments would\nglorify the whole blessed coast of England, from Land's End round again\nto the Lizard. Luck comes to a man very often when he's not looking.\"\n\nWarming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. \"I just missed seeing\nyou, if I recollect aright.\"\n\n\"You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station. It\nwas close on the Jubilee, Victoria's Jubilee, because I remember the\nseats and flags in Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea.\"\n\n\"The Diamond Jubilee, it was,\" said Warming; \"the second one.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee--the Fifty Year affair--I was down at\nWookey--a boy. I missed all that.... What a fuss we had with him! My\nlandlady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't let him stay--he looked so queer\nwhen he was rigid. We had to carry him in a chair up to the hotel. And\nthe Boscastle doctor--it wasn't the present chap, but the G.P. before\nhim--was at him until nearly two, with me and the landlord holding lights\nand so forth.\"\n\n\"Do you mean--he was stiff and hard?\"\n\n\"Stiff!--wherever you bent him he stuck. You might have stood him on his\nhead and he'd have stopped. I never saw such stiffness. Of course\nthis\"--he indicated the prostrate figure by a movement of his head--\"is\nquite different. And the little doctor--what was his name?\"\n\n\"Smithers?\"\n\n\"Smithers it was--was quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon,\naccording to all accounts. The things he did! Even now it makes me feel\nall--ugh! Mustard, snuff, pricking. And one of those beastly little\nthings, not dynamos--\"\n\n\"Coils.\"\n\n\"Yes. You could see his muscles throb and jump, and he twisted about.\nThere were just two flaring yellow candles, and all the shadows were\nshivering, and the little doctor nervous and putting on side, and\n_him_--stark and squirming in the most unnatural ways. Well, it made\nme dream.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"It's a strange state,\" said Warming.\n\n\"It's a sort of complete absence,\" said Isbister. \"Here's the body,\nempty. Not dead a bit, and yet not alive. It's like a seat vacant and\nmarked 'engaged.' No feeling, no digestion, no beating of the heart--not\na flutter. _That_ doesn't make me feel as if there was a man present. In\na sense it's more dead than death, for these doctors tell me that even\nthe hair has stopped growing. Now with the proper dead, the hair will go\non growing--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Warming, with a flash of pain in his expression.\n\nThey peered through the glass again. Graham was indeed in a strange\nstate, in the flaccid phase of a trance, but a trance unprecedented in\nmedical history. Trances had lasted for as much as a year before--but at\nthe end of that time it had ever been a waking or a death; sometimes\nfirst one and then the other. Isbister noted the marks the physicians\nhad made in injecting nourishment, for that had been resorted to to\npostpone collapse; he pointed them out to Warming, who had been trying\nnot to see them.\n\n\"And while he has been lying here,\" said Isbister, with the zest of a\nlife freely spent, \"I have changed my plans in life; married, raised a\nfamily, my eldest lad--I hadn't begun to think of sons then--is an\nAmerican citizen, and looking forward to leaving Harvard. There's a touch\nof grey in my hair. And this man, not a day older nor wiser (practically)\nthan I was in my downy days. It's curious to think of.\"\n\nWarming turned. \"And I have grown old too. I played cricket with him when\nI was still only a boy. And he looks a young man still. Yellow perhaps.\nBut that _is_ a young man nevertheless.\"\n\n\"And there's been the War,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"From beginning to end.\"\n\n\"And these Martians.\"\n\n\"I've understood,\" said Isbister after a pause, \"that he had some\nmoderate property of his own?\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Warming. He coughed primly. \"As it happens--I have\ncharge of it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: \"No doubt--his keep here is\nnot expensive--no doubt it will have improved--accumulated?\"\n\n\"It has. He will wake up very much better off--if he wakes--than when\nhe slept.\"\n\n\"As a business man,\" said Isbister, \"that thought has naturally been in\nmy mind. I have, indeed, sometimes thought that, speaking commercially,\nof course, this sleep may be a very good thing for him. That he knows\nwhat he is about, so to speak, in being insensible so long. If he had\nlived straight on--\"\n\n\"I doubt if he would have premeditated as much,\" said Warming. \"He was\nnot a far-sighted man. In fact--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"We differed on that point. I stood to him somewhat in the relation of a\nguardian. You have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise that\noccasionally a certain friction--. But even if that was the case, there\nis a doubt whether he will ever wake. This sleep exhausts slowly, but it\nexhausts. Apparently he is sliding slowly, very slowly and tediously,\ndown a long slope, if you can understand me?\"\n\n\"It will be a pity to lose his surprise. There's been a lot of change\nthese twenty years. It's Rip Van Winkle come real.\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of change certainly,\" said Warming. \"And, among\nother changes, I have changed. I am an old man.\"\n\nIsbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise. \"I shouldn't\nhave thought it.\"\n\n\"I was forty-three when his bankers--you remember you wired to his\nbankers--sent on to me.\"\n\n\"I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"Well, the addition is not difficult,\" said Warming.\n\nThere was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable\ncuriosity. \"He may go on for years yet,\" he said, and had a moment of\nhesitation. \"We have to consider that. His affairs, you know, may fall\nsome day into the hands of--someone else, you know.\"\n\n\"That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one of the problems most\nconstantly before my mind. We happen to be--as a matter of fact, there\nare no very trustworthy connexions of ours. It is a grotesque and\nunprecedented position.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" said Isbister.\n\n\"It seems to me it's a case of some public body, some practically\nundying guardian. If he really is going on living--as the doctors, some\nof them, think. As a matter of fact, I have gone to one or two public men\nabout it. But, so far, nothing has been done.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be a bad idea to hand him over to some public body--the\nBritish Museum Trustees, or the Royal College of Physicians. Sounds a bit\nodd, of course, but the whole situation is odd.\"\n\n\"The difficulty is to induce them to take him.\"\n\n\"Red tape, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Partly.\"\n\nPause. \"It's a curious business, certainly,\" said Isbister. \"And compound\ninterest has a way of mounting up.\"\n\n\"It has,\" said Warming. \"And now the gold supplies are running short\nthere is a tendency towards ... appreciation.\"\n\n\"I've felt that,\" said Isbister with a grimace. \"But it makes it better\nfor _him_.\"\n\n\"_If_ he wakes.\"\n\n\"If he wakes,\" echoed Isbister. \"Do you notice the pinched-in look of his\nnose, and the way in which his eyelids sink?\"\n\nWarming looked and thought for a space. \"I doubt if he will wake,\" he\nsaid at last.\n\n\"I never properly understood,\" said Isbister, \"what it was brought this\non. He told me something about overstudy. I've often been curious.\"\n\n\"He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic, emotional. He\nhad grave domestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact, and it was\nas a relief from that, I think, that he took up politics of the\nrabid sort. He was a fanatical Radical--a Socialist--or typical\nLiberal, as they used to call themselves, of the advanced school.\nEnergetic--flighty--undisciplined. Overwork upon a controversy did this\nfor him. I remember the pamphlet he wrote--a curious production. Wild,\nwhirling stuff. There were one or two prophecies. Some of them are\nalready exploded, some of them are established facts. But for the most\npart to read such a thesis is to realise how full the world is of\nunanticipated things. He will have much to learn, much to unlearn, when\nhe wakes. If ever a waking comes.\"\n\n\"I'd give anything to be there,\" said Isbister, \"just to hear what he\nwould say to it all.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Warming. \"Aye! so would I,\" with an old man's sudden\nturn to self pity. \"But I shall never see him wake.\"\n\nHe stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure. \"He will never awake,\"\nhe said at last. He sighed. \"He will never awake again.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE AWAKENING\n\n\nBut Warming was wrong in that. An awakening came.\n\nWhat a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity--the self!\nWho can trace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the\nflux and confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding,\nthe dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of the\nunconscious to the subconscious, the subconscious to dawning\nconsciousness, until at last we recognise ourselves again. And as it\nhappens to most of us after the night's sleep, so it was with Graham at\nthe end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud of sensation taking shape, a\ncloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguely somewhere, recumbent,\nfaint, but alive.\n\nThe pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs, to\noccupy epochs. Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time,\nleft vague perplexing memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as if\nfrom another planet. There was a distinct impression, too, of a momentous\nconversation, of a name--he could not tell what name--that was\nsubsequently to recur, of some queer long-forgotten sensation of vein and\nmuscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the effort of a man near\ndrowning in darkness. Then came a panorama of dazzling unstable confluent\nscenes....\n\nGraham became aware that his eyes were open and regarding some\nunfamiliar thing.\n\nIt was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood. He moved\nhis head slightly, following the contour of this shape. It went up\nbeyond the top of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be. Did it\nmatter, seeing he was so wretched? The colour of his thoughts was a dark\ndepression. He felt the featureless misery of one who wakes towards the\nhour of dawn. He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps\nhastily receding.\n\nThe movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical\nweakness. He supposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the\nvalley--but he could not recall that white edge. He must have slept. He\nremembered now that he had wanted to sleep. He recalled the cliff and\nWaterfall again, and then recollected something about talking to a\npasser-by....\n\nHow long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And that\nrise and fall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a\nlanguid hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was his habit\nto place it, and touched some smooth hard surface like glass. This was so\nunexpected that it startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled over,\nstared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting position. The effort\nwas unexpectedly difficult, and it left him giddy and weak--and amazed.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his\nmind was quite clear--evidently his sleep had benefited him. He was not\nin a bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very soft\nand yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass. The mattress was\npartly transparent, a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity, and\nbelow it was a mirror reflecting him greyly. About his arm--and he saw\nwith a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow--was bound a\ncurious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass\ninto his skin above and below. And this bed was placed in a case of\ngreenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a bar in the white\nframework of which had first arrested his attention. In the corner of the\ncase was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus, for the\nmost part quite strange appliances, though a maximum and minimum\nthermometer was recognisable.\n\nThe slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded\nhim on every hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a\nvast apartment of splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple\nwhite archway facing him. Close to the walls of the cage were articles of\nfurniture, a table covered with a silvery cloth, silvery like the side of\na fish, a couple of graceful chairs, and on the table a number of dishes\nwith substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses. He realised that\nhe was intensely hungry.\n\nHe could see no one, and after a period of hesitation scrambled off the\ntranslucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his\nlittle apartment. He had miscalculated his strength, however, and\nstaggered and put his hand against the glass like pane before him to\nsteady himself. For a moment it resisted his hand, bending outward like a\ndistended bladder, then it broke with a slight report and vanished--a\npricked bubble. He reeled out into the general space of the hall, greatly\nastonished. He caught at the table to save himself, knocking one of the\nglasses to the floor--it rang but did not break--and sat down in one of\nthe armchairs.\n\nWhen he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the\nbottle and drank--a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a\npleasing faint aroma and taste and a quality of immediate support and\nstimulus. He put down the vessel and looked about him.\n\nThe apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the\ngreenish transparency that had intervened was removed. The archway he saw\nled to a flight of steps, going downward without the intermediation of a\ndoor, to a spacious transverse passage. This passage ran between polished\npillars of some white-veined substance of deep ultramarine, and along it\ncame the sound of human movements, and voices and a deep undeviating\ndroning note. He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly, forgetting the\nviands in his attention.\n\nThen with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him\nfor covering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside\nhim. This he wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.\n\nHis mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he had slept, and had\nbeen removed in his sleep. But where? And who were those people, the\ndistant crowd beyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and\npartially drank another glass of the colourless fluid.\n\nWhat was this place?--this place that to his senses seemed subtly\nquivering like a thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and\nbeautiful form of the apartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the\nroof was broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and, as\nhe looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out and passed, and came\nagain and passed. \"Beat, beat,\" that sweeping shadow had a note of its\nown in the subdued tumult that filled the air.\n\nHe would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat.\nThen he stood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his\nway towards the archway. He staggered down the steps, tripped on the\ncorner of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and saved himself\nby catching at one of the blue pillars.\n\nThe passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple and ended remotely\nin a railed space like a balcony brightly lit and projecting into a space\nof haze, a space like the interior of some gigantic building. Beyond and\nremote were vast and vague architectural forms. The tumult of voices rose\nnow loud and clear, and on the balcony and with their backs to him,\ngesticulating and apparently in animated conversation, were three\nfigures, richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft\ncolourings. The noise of a great multitude of people poured up over the\nbalcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, and once some\nbrightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the\nair perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The shouts sounded like\nEnglish, there was a reiteration of \"Wake!\" He heard some indistinct\nshrill cry, and abruptly these three men began laughing.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed one--a red-haired man in a short purple robe. \"When\nthe Sleeper wakes--_When_!\"\n\nHe turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. His face changed,\nthe whole man changed, became rigid. The other two turned swiftly at his\nexclamation and stood motionless. Their faces assumed an expression of\nconsternation, an expression that deepened into awe.\n\nSuddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar\ncollapsed limply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE SOUND OF A TUMULT\n\n\nGraham's last impression before he fainted was of the ringing of bells.\nHe learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between life and\ndeath, for the better part of an hour. When he recovered his senses, he\nwas back on his translucent couch, and there was a stirring warmth at\nheart and throat. The dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed from\nhis arm, which was bandaged. The white framework was still about him, but\nthe greenish transparent substance that had filled it was altogether\ngone. A man in a deep violet robe, one of those who had been on the\nbalcony, was looking keenly into his face.\n\nRemote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that\nsuggested to his mind the picture of a great number of people\nshouting together. Something seemed to fall across this tumult, a\ndoor suddenly closed.\n\nGraham moved his head. \"What does this all mean?\" he said slowly.\n\"Where am I?\"\n\nHe saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him. A voice\nseemed to be asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.\n\nThe man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with a\nslightly foreign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper's ears.\n\"You are quite safe. You were brought hither from where you fell asleep.\nIt is quite safe. You have been here some time--sleeping. In a trance.\"\n\nHe said, something further that Graham could not hear, and a little phial\nwas handed across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist\nplayed over his forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment\nincreased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.\n\n\"Better?\" asked the man in violet, as Graham's eyes reopened. He was a\npleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and a\nclasp of gold at the neck of his violet robe.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic trance. You have heard?\nCatalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but I can assure you\neverything is well.\"\n\nGraham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose.\nHis eyes went from face to face of the three people about him. They were\nregarding him strangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in Cornwall,\nbut he could not square these things with that impression.\n\nA matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at\nBoscastle recurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected. He\ncleared his throat.\n\n\"Have you wired my cousin?\" he asked. \"E. Warming, 27, Chancery Lane?\"\n\nThey were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat it. \"What an odd\n_blurr_ in his accent!\" whispered the red-haired man. \"Wire, sir?\" said\nthe young man with the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.\n\n\"He means send an electric telegram,\" volunteered the third, a\npleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty. The flaxen-bearded man gave a\ncry of comprehension. \"How stupid of me! You may be sure everything shall\nbe done, sir,\" he said to Graham. \"I am afraid it would be difficult\nto--_wire_ to your cousin. He is not in London now. But don't trouble\nabout arrangements yet; you have been asleep a very long time and the\nimportant thing is to get over that, sir.\" (Graham concluded the word was\nsir, but this man pronounced it \"_Sire_.\")\n\n\"Oh!\" said Graham, and became quiet.\n\nIt was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress\nknew what they were about. Yet they were odd and the room was odd. It\nseemed he was in some newly established place. He had a sudden flash of\nsuspicion! Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhibition! If it was\nhe would give Warming a piece of his mind. But it scarcely had that\ncharacter. And in a place of public exhibition he would not have\ndiscovered himself naked.\n\nThen suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. There was\nno perceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly\nhe knew that his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if by some\nprocesses of thought-reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that\npeered into his. He looked at them strangely, full of intense emotion. It\nseemed they read his eyes. He framed his lips to speak and could not. A\nqueer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his mind almost at the\nmoment of his discovery. He looked at his bare feet, regarding them\nsilently. His impulse to speak passed. He was trembling exceedingly.\n\nThey gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty\ntaste, and the assurance of returning strength grew.\n\n\"That--that makes me feel better,\" he said hoarsely, and there were\nmurmurs of respectful approval. He knew now quite clearly. He made to\nspeak again, and again he could not.\n\nHe pressed his throat and tried a third time. \"How long?\" he asked in a\nlevel voice. \"How long have I been asleep?\"\n\n\"Some considerable time,\" said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly\nat the others.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"A very long time.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" said Graham, suddenly testy. \"But I want--Is it--it is--some\nyears? Many years? There was something--I forget what. I feel--confused.\nBut you--\" He sobbed. \"You need not fence with me. How long--?\"\n\nHe stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his eyes with his knuckles\nand sat waiting for an answer.\n\nThey spoke in undertones.\n\n\"Five or six?\" he asked faintly. \"More?\"\n\n\"Very much more than that.\"\n\n\"More!\"\n\n\"More.\"\n\nHe looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles\nof his face. He looked his question.\n\n\"Many years,\" said the man with the red beard.\n\nGraham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped a rheumy tear from\nhis face with a lean hand. \"Many years!\" he repeated. He shut his eyes\ntight, opened them, and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar thing\nto another.\n\n\"How many years?\" he asked.\n\n\"You must be prepared to be surprised.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"More than a gross of years.\"\n\nHe was irritated at the strange word. \"More than a _what_?\"\n\nTwo of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that were made about\n\"decimal\" he did not catch.\n\n\"How long did you say?\" asked Graham. \"How long? Don't look like\nthat. Tell me.\"\n\nAmong the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: \"More than a\ncouple of centuries.\"\n\n\"_What_?\" he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken. \"Who\nsays--? What was that? A couple of _centuries_!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man with the red beard. \"Two hundred years.\"\n\nGraham repeated the words. He had been prepared to hear of a vast repose,\nand yet these concrete centuries defeated him.\n\n\"Two hundred years,\" he said again, with the figure of a great gulf\nopening very slowly in his mind; and then, \"Oh, but--!\"\n\nThey said nothing.\n\n\"You--did you say--?\"\n\n\"Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,\" said the man with the\nred beard.\n\nThere was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had\nheard was indeed true.\n\n\"But it can't be,\" he said querulously. \"I am dreaming. Trances--trances\ndon't last. That is not right--this is a joke you have played upon me!\nTell me--some days ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of\nCornwall--?\"\n\nHis voice failed him.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard hesitated. \"I'm not very strong in history,\nsir,\" he said weakly, and glanced at the others.\n\n\"That was it, sir,\" said the youngster. \"Boscastle, in the old Duchy of\nCornwall--it's in the south-west country beyond the dairy meadows. There\nis a house there still. I have been there.\"\n\n\"Boscastle!\" Graham turned his eyes to the youngster. \"That was\nit--Boscastle. Little Boscastle. I fell asleep--somewhere there. I don't\nexactly remember. I don't exactly remember.\"\n\nHe pressed his brows and whispered, \"More than _two hundred years_!\"\n\nHe began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was\ncold within him. \"But if it _is_ two hundred years, every soul I know,\nevery human being that ever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep,\nmust be dead.\"\n\nThey did not answer him.\n\n\"The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, Church and State. High\nand low, rich and poor, one with another ... Is there England still?\"\n\n\"That's a comfort! Is there London?\"\n\n\"This _is_ London, eh? And you are my assistant-custodian;\nassistant-custodian. And these--? Eh? Assistant-custodians too!\"\n\nHe sat with a gaunt stare on his face. \"But why am I here? No! Don't\ntalk. Be quiet. Let me--\"\n\nHe sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another\nlittle glass of pinkish fluid held towards him. He took the dose.\nDirectly he had taken it he began to weep naturally and refreshingly.\n\nPresently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears, a\nlittle foolishly. \"But--two--hun--dred--years!\" he said. He grimaced\nhysterically and covered his face again.\n\nAfter a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands hanging over his knees\nin almost precisely the same attitude in which Isbister had found him on\nthe cliff at Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick\ndomineering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage. \"What are you\ndoing? Why was I not warned? Surely you could tell? Someone will suffer\nfor this. The man must be kept quiet. Are the doorways closed? All the\ndoorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet. He must not be told. Has he\nbeen told anything?\"\n\nThe man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham\nlooking over his shoulder saw approaching a short, fat, and thickset\nbeardless man, with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very thick\nblack and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met over his nose and\noverhung deep grey eyes, gave his face an oddly formidable expression. He\nscowled momentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to the man\nwith the flaxen beard. \"These others,\" he said in a voice of extreme\nirritation. \"You had better go.\"\n\n\"Go?\" said the red-bearded man.\n\n\"Certainly--go now. But see the doorways are closed as you go.\"\n\nThe two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at\nGraham, and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked\nstraight to the dead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. A long\nstrip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap, hung over the\ntwo retreating men and fell again, and immediately Graham was alone with\nthe newcomer and the purple-robed man with the flaxen beard.\n\nFor a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham, but\nproceeded to interrogate the other--obviously his subordinate---upon the\ntreatment of their charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only\npartially intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only a matter\nof surprise but of consternation and annoyance to him. He was evidently\nprofoundly excited.\n\n\"You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,\" he repeated again\nand again. \"You must not confuse his mind.\"\n\nHis questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper\nwith an ambiguous expression.\n\n\"Feel queer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very.\"\n\n\"The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?\"\n\n\"I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, now.\"\n\n\"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?\"\n\n\"They--\" said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxen-bearded man\nmet his eye and went away. \"You will very speedily have clothes,\" said\nthe thickset man.\n\n\"Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred--?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a\nmatter of fact.\"\n\nGraham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed\nmouth. He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, \"Is there a\nmill or dynamo near here?\" He did not wait for an answer. \"Things have\nchanged tremendously, I suppose?\" he said.\n\n\"What is that shouting?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the thickset man impatiently. \"It's people. You'll\nunderstand better later--perhaps. As you say, things have changed.\" He\nspoke shortly, his brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man\ntrying to decide in an emergency. \"We must get you clothes and so forth,\nat any rate. Better wait here until they can be procured. No one will\ncome near you. You want shaving.\"\n\nGraham rubbed his chin.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly,\nlistened for a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried\noff through the archway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting grew\nlouder, and the thickset man turned and listened also. He cursed suddenly\nunder his breath, and turned his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly\nexpression. It was a surge of many voices, rising and falling, shouting\nand screaming, and once came a sound like blows and sharp cries, and then\na snapping like the crackling of dry sticks. Graham strained his ears to\ndraw some single thread of sound from the woven tumult.\n\nThen he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For a\ntime he doubted his ears. But surely these were the words: \"Show us the\nSleeper! Show us the Sleeper!\"\n\nThe thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.\n\n\"Wild!\" he cried. \"How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing?\"\n\nThere was perhaps an answer.\n\n\"I can't come,\" said the thickset man; \"I have _him_ to see to. But shout\nfrom the balcony.\"\n\nThere was an inaudible reply.\n\n\"Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you.\"\n\nHe came hurrying back to Graham. \"You must have clothes at once,\" he\nsaid. \"You cannot stop here--and it will be impossible to--\"\n\nHe rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In a\nmoment he was back.\n\n\"I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex to explain. In a\nmoment you shall have your clothes made. Yes--in a moment. And then I can\ntake you away from here. You will find out our troubles soon enough.\"\n\n\"But those voices. They were shouting--?\"\n\n\"Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They have some twisted idea. I\ndon't know what it is. I know nothing.\"\n\nA shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote\nnoises, and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in\nthe corner of the room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of\ncrystal, nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then he walked to the\nwall through which the two men had vanished. It rolled up again like a\ncurtain, and he stood waiting.\n\nGraham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the\nrestoratives had given him. He thrust one leg over the side of the couch\nand then the other. His head no longer swam. He could scarcely credit his\nrapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did\nso the cage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man, and\na lean, grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a tightly-fitting\ncostume of dark green, appeared therein.\n\n\"This is the tailor,\" said the thickset man with an introductory gesture.\n\"It will never do for you to wear that black. I cannot understand how it\ngot here. But I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid as possible?\" he\nsaid to the tailor.\n\nThe man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on the\nbed. His manner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. \"You will\nfind the fashions altered, Sire,\" he said. He glanced from under his\nbrows at the thickset man.\n\nHe opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant\nfabrics poured out over his knees. \"You lived, Sire, in a period\nessentially cylindrical--the Victorian. With a tendency to the hemisphere\nin hats. Circular curves always. Now--\" He flicked out a little appliance\nthe size and appearance of a keyless watch, whirled the knob, and\nbehold--a little figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the\ndial, walking and turning. The tailor caught up a pattern of bluish white\nsatin. \"That is my conception of your immediate treatment,\" he said.\n\nThe thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.\n\n\"We have very little time,\" he said.\n\n\"Trust me,\" said the tailor. \"My machine follows. What do you\nthink of this?\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the man from the nineteenth century.\n\n\"In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,\" said the tailor, \"but\nthis is our modern development. See here.\" The little figure repeated its\nevolutions, but in a different costume. \"Or this,\" and with a click\nanother small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched on to the\ndial. The tailor was very quick in his movements, and glanced twice\ntowards the lift as he did these things.\n\nIt rumbled again, and a crop-haired anemic lad with features of the\nChinese type, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a\ncomplicated machine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into\nthe room. Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was\ninvited to stand in front of the machine and the tailor muttered some\ninstructions to the crop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and\nwith words Graham did not recognise. The boy then went to conduct an\nincomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the tailor pulled out a\nnumber of slotted arms terminating in little discs, pulling them out\nuntil the discs were flat against the body of Graham, one at each\nshoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth, so that\nat last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and limbs.\nAt the same time, some other person entered the room by the lift, behind\nGraham. The tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-sounding\nrhythmic movement of parts in the machine, and in another moment he was\nknocking up the levers and Graham was released. The tailor replaced his\ncloak of black, and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him a little\nglass of some refreshing fluid. Graham saw over the rim of the glass a\npale-faced young man regarding him with a singular fixity.\n\nThe thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and\nwent through the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a\ndistant crowd still came in gusts and cadences. The crop-headed lad\nhanded the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began fixing\nthis in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of a roll of paper in a\nnineteenth century printing machine. Then they ran the entire thing on\nits easy, noiseless bearings across the room to a remote corner where a\ntwisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. They made some\nconnexion and the machine became energetic and swift.\n\n\"What is that doing?\" asked Graham, pointing with the empty glass to the\nbusy figures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. \"Is\nthat--some sort of force--laid on?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man with the flaxen beard.\n\n\"Who is _that_?\" He indicated the archway behind him.\n\nThe man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in\nan undertone, \"He is Howard, your chief guardian. You see, Sire--it's\na little difficult to explain. The Council appoints a guardian and\nassistants. This hall has under certain restrictions been public. In\norder that people might satisfy themselves. We have barred the\ndoorways for the first time. But I think--if you don't mind, I will\nleave him to explain.\"\n\n\"Odd!\" said Graham. \"Guardian? Council?\" Then turning his back on the\nnew comer, he asked in an undertone, \"Why is this man _glaring_ at me? Is\nhe a mesmerist?\"\n\n\"Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist.\"\n\n\"Capillotomist!\"\n\n\"Yes--one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions.\"\n\nIt sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the last phrase with an\nunsteady mind. \"Sixdoz lions?\" he said.\n\n\"Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had the old pounds? They are\nour monetary units.\"\n\n\"But what was that you said--sixdoz?\"\n\n\"Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these little things, have\naltered. You lived in the days of the decimal system, the Arab\nsystem--tens, and little hundreds and thousands. We have eleven numerals\nnow. We have single figures for both ten and eleven, two figures for a\ndozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great hundred, you know, a\ndozen gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad. Very simple?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Graham. \"But about this cap--what was it?\"\n\nThe man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.\n\n\"Here are your clothes!\" he said. Graham turned round sharply and saw the\ntailor standing at his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new\ngarments over his arm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one ringer, was\nimpelling the complicated machine towards the lift by which he had\narrived. Graham stared at the completed suit. \"You don't mean to say--!\"\n\n\"Just made,\" said the tailor. He dropped the garments at the feet of\nGraham, walked to the bed, on which Graham had so recently been lying,\nflung out the translucent mattress, and turned up the looking-glass. As\nhe did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the corner. The\nman with the flaxen beard rushed across to him and then hurried out by\nthe archway.\n\nThe tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,\nstockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from\nthe corner to meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the\nbalcony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had\nan unmistakable quality of anxiety. Over the purple under-garment came\na complex garment of bluish white, and Graham, was clothed in the\nfashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced, unshaven and shaggy\nstill, but at least naked no longer, and in some indefinable\nunprecedented way graceful.\n\n\"I must shave,\" he said regarding himself in the glass.\n\n\"In a moment,\" said Howard.\n\nThe persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened\nthem, and with a lean hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he stopped,\nwith his hand slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.\n\n\"A seat,\" said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded man\nhad a chair behind Graham. \"Sit down, please,\" said Howard.\n\nGraham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wild-eyed man he saw the\nglint of steel.\n\n\"Don't you understand, Sire?\" cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurried\npoliteness. \"He is going to cut your hair.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Graham enlightened. \"But you called him--\"\n\n\"A capillotomist--precisely! He is one of the finest artists in\nthe world.\"\n\nGraham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The\ncapillotomist came forward, examined Graham's ears and surveyed him, felt\nthe back of his head, and would have sat down again to regard him but for\nHoward's audible impatience. Forthwith with rapid movements and a\nsuccession of deftly handled implements he shaved Graham's chin, clipped\nhis moustache, and cut and arranged his hair. All this he did without a\nword, with something of the rapt air of a poet inspired. And as soon as\nhe had finished Graham was handed a pair of shoes.\n\nSuddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece of machinery in the\ncorner--\"At once--at once. The people know all over the city. Work is\nbeing stopped. Work is being stopped. Wait for nothing, but come.\"\n\nThis shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures it\nseemed to Graham that he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly he\nwent towards the corner where the apparatus stood about the little\ncrystal ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous shouting from the\narchway that had continued during all these occurrences rose to a mighty\nsound, roared as if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding\nswiftly. It drew Graham after it with an irresistible attraction. He\nglanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed his impulse. In two strides\nhe was down the steps and in the passage, and in a score he was out upon\nthe balcony upon which the three men had been standing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE MOVING WAYS\n\n\nHe went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation\nof surprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of people\ncame from the great area below.\n\nHis first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into\nwhich he looked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously in\neither direction. Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the\nhuge width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out\nthe sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams\nthat filtered down through the girders and wires. Here and there a\ngossamer suspension bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the\nchasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A cliff of edifice\nhung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward, and the opposite\nfa\u00e7ade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circular\nperforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast\nwindows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. Athwart these\nran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering.\nHere and there close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were\nfastened, and drooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the\nopposite side of the space, and even as Graham noted these a remote and\ntiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested his attention. This\nlittle figure was far overhead across the space beside the higher\nfastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward from a little ledge\nof masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent from\nthe line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham's heart into his\nmouth, this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a round\nopening on the hither side of the way. Graham had been looking up as he\ncame out upon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to\nhim had at first seized his attention to the exclusion of anything else.\nThen suddenly he discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all, as\nGraham understood such things, for in the nineteenth century the only\nroads and streets were beaten tracks of motionless earth, jostling\nrivulets of vehicles between narrow footways. But this roadway was three\nhundred feet across, and it moved; it moved, all save the middle, the\nlowest part. For a moment, the motion dazzled his mind. Then he\nunderstood. Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to\nGraham's right, an endless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth\ncentury express train, an endless platform of narrow transverse\noverlapping slats with little interspaces that permitted it to follow\nthe curvatures of the street. Upon it were seats, and here and there\nlittle kiosks, but they swept by too swiftly for him to see what might\nbe therein. From this nearest and swiftest platform a series of others\ndescended to the centre of the space. Each moved to the right, each\nperceptibly slower than the one above it, but the difference in pace was\nsmall enough to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one\nadjacent, and so walk uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the\nmotionless middle way. Beyond this middle way was another series of\nendless platforms rushing with varying pace to Graham's left. And seated\nin crowds upon the two widest and swiftest platforms, or stepping from\none to another down the steps, or swarming over the central space, was\nan innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people.\n\n\"You must not stop here,\" shouted Howard suddenly at his side. \"You must\ncome away at once.\"\n\nGraham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran with a\nroar and the people were shouting. He perceived women and girls with\nflowing hair, beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the breasts.\nThese first came out of the confusion. Then he perceived that the\ndominant note in that kaleidoscope of costume was the pale blue that the\ntailor's boy had worn. He became aware of cries of \"The Sleeper. What has\nhappened to the Sleeper?\" and it seemed as though the rushing platforms\nbefore him were suddenly spattered with the pale buff of human faces, and\nthen still more thickly. He saw pointing fingers. He perceived that the\nmotionless central area of this huge arcade just opposite to the balcony\nwas densely crowded with blue-clad people. Some sort of struggle had\nsprung into life. People seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on\neither side, and carried away against their will. They would spring off\nso soon as they were beyond the thick of the confusion, and run back\ntowards the conflict.\n\n\"It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper,\" shouted voices. \"That is\nnever the Sleeper,\" shouted others. More and more faces were turned to\nhim. At the intervals along this central area Graham noted openings,\npits, apparently the heads of staircases going down with people\nascending out of them and descending into them. The struggle it seemed\ncentred about the one of these nearest to him. People were running down\nthe moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously from platform to\nplatform. The clustering people on the higher platforms seemed to divide\ntheir interest between this point and the balcony. A number of sturdy\nlittle figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and working methodically\ntogether, were employed it seemed in preventing access to this descending\nstaircase. About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating. Their brilliant\ncolour contrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists, for\nthe struggle was indisputable.\n\nHe saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm.\nAnd then suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.\n\nHe perceived that the cries of \"The Sleeper!\" grew in volume, and that\nthe people on the nearer platform were standing up. The nearer platform\nhe perceived was empty to the right of him, and far across the space the\nplatform running in the opposite direction was coming crowded and passing\naway bare. With incredible swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the\ncentral space before his eyes; a dense swaying mass of people, and the\nshouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous incessant clamour: \"The\nSleeper! The Sleeper!\" and yells and cheers, a waving of garments and\ncries of \"Stop the Ways!\" They were also crying another name strange to\nGraham. It sounded like \"Ostrog.\" The slower platforms were soon thick\nwith active people, running against the movement so as to keep themselves\nopposite to him.\n\n\"Stop the Ways,\" they cried. Agile figures ran up from the centre to the\nswift road nearest to him, were borne rapidly past him, shouting strange,\nunintelligible things, and ran back obliquely to the central way. One\nthing he distinguished: \"It is indeed the Sleeper. It is indeed the\nSleeper,\" they testified.\n\nFor a space Graham stood motionless. Then he became vividly aware that\nall this concerned him. He was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he\nbowed, and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his arm. He was\nastonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked. The tumult about\nthe descending stairway rose to furious violence. He became aware of\ncrowded balconies, of men sliding along ropes, of men in trapeze-like\nseats hurling athwart the space. He heard voices behind him, a number of\npeople descending the steps through the archway; he suddenly perceived\nthat his guardian Howard was back again and gripping his arm painfully,\nand shouting inaudibly in his ear.\n\nHe turned, and Howard's face was white. \"Come back,\" he heard. \"They will\nstop the ways. The whole city will be in confusion.\"\n\nHe perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars\nbehind Howard, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall\nman in vivid vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and all\nthese people had anxious eager faces.\n\n\"Get him away,\" cried Howard.\n\n\"But why?\" said Graham. \"I don't see--\"\n\n\"You must come away!\" said the man in red in a resolute voice. His face\nand eyes were resolute, too. Graham's glances went from face to face, and\nhe was suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavour in life,\ncompulsion. Someone gripped his arm....\n\nHe was being dragged away. It seemed as though the tumult suddenly\nbecame two, as if half the shouts that had come in from this wonderful\nroadway had sprung into the passages of the great building behind him.\nMarvelling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to resist, Graham was\nhalf led, half thrust, along the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly he\nfound himself alone with Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE HALL OF THE ATLAS\n\n\nFrom the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when\nGraham found himself in the lift, was altogether barely five minutes. As\nyet the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as yet the\ninitial strangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched\neverything with wonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something of\nthe quality of a realistic dream. He was still detached, an astonished\nspectator, still but half involved in life. What he had seen, and\nespecially the last crowded tumult, framed in the setting of the balcony,\nhad a spectacular turn, like a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said. \"What was the trouble? My mind is in a\nwhirl. Why were they shouting? What is the danger?\"\n\n\"We have our troubles,\" said Howard. His eyes avoided Graham's enquiry.\n\"This is a time of unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking\njust now, has a sort of connexion--\"\n\nHe spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He\nstopped abruptly.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Graham.\n\n\"It will be clearer later,\" said Howard.\n\nHe glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the\nlift slow.\n\n\"I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about a\nlittle,\" said Graham puzzled. \"It will be--it is bound to be perplexing.\nAt present it is all so strange. Anything seems possible. Anything. In\nthe details even. Your counting, I understand, is different.\"\n\nThe lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long\npassage between high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of\ntubes and big cables.\n\n\"What a huge place this is!\" said Graham. \"Is it all one building? What\nplace is it?\"\n\n\"This is one of the city ways for various public services. Light and\nso forth.\"\n\n\"Was it a social trouble--that--in the great roadway place? How are you\ngoverned? Have you still a police?\"\n\n\"Several,\" said Howard.\n\n\"Several?\"\n\n\"About fourteen.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Very probably not. Our social order will probably seem very complex\nto you. To tell you the truth, I don't understand it myself very\nclearly. Nobody does. You will, perhaps--bye and bye. We have to go to\nthe Council.\"\n\nGraham's attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his\ninquiries and the people in the passages and halls they were traversing.\nFor a moment his mind would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting\nanswers he made, and then he would lose the thread in response to some\nvivid unexpected impression. Along the passages, in the halls, half the\npeople seemed to be men in the red uniform. The pale blue canvas that had\nbeen so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear. Invariably\nthese men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as they passed.\n\nHe had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a\nnumber of girls sitting on low seats, as though in a class. He saw no\nteacher, but only a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice\nproceeded. The girls regarded him and his conductor, he thought, with\ncuriosity and astonishment. But he was hurried on before he could form\na clear idea of the gathering. He judged they knew Howard and not\nhimself, and that they wondered who he was. This Howard, it seemed, was\na person of importance. But then he was also merely Graham's guardian.\nThat was odd.\n\nThere came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung so\nthat he could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon,\nbut no more of them. Then vague impressions of galleries and of casual\nastonished passers-by turning round to stare after the two of them with\ntheir red-clad guard.\n\nThe stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary. He was\nspeedily fatigued by this excessive haste. He asked Howard to slacken his\nspeed. Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great street\nspace, but this was glazed and did not open, and they were too high for\nhim to see the moving platforms below. But he saw people going to and fro\nalong cables and along strange, frail-looking bridges.\n\nThence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it. They\ncrossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear that\nit made him giddy even to remember it. The floor of it also was of glass.\nFrom his memory of the cliffs between New Quay and Boscastle, so remote\nin time, and so recent in his experience, it seemed to him that they\nmust be near four hundred feet above the moving ways. He stopped, looked\ndown between his legs upon the swarming blue and red multitudes, minute\nand foreshortened, struggling and gesticulating still towards the little\nbalcony far below, a little toy balcony, it seemed, where he had so\nrecently been standing. A thin haze and the glare of the mighty globes of\nlight obscured everything. A man seated in a little openwork cradle shot\nby from some point still higher than the little narrow bridge, rushing\ndown a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling. Graham stopped\ninvoluntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish below, and then his\neyes went back to the tumultuous struggle.\n\nAlong one of the faster ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. This\nbroke up into individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring\ndown the slower ways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central\narea. These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons;\nthey seemed to be striking and thrusting. A great shouting, cries of\nwrath, screaming, burst out and came up to Graham, faint and thin. \"Go\non,\" cried Howard, laying hands on him.\n\nAnother man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly glanced up to see whence\nhe came, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of cables and\ngirders, dim rhythmically passing forms like the vanes of windmills, and\nbetween them glimpses of a remote and pallid sky. Then Howard had thrust\nhim forward across the bridge, and he was in a little narrow passage\ndecorated with geometrical patterns.\n\n\"I want to see more of that,\" cried Graham, resisting.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Howard, still gripping his arm. \"This way. You must go\nthis way.\" And the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce\nhis orders.\n\nSome negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared\ndown the passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that\nhad seemed a door to Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found\nhimself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great chamber. The\nattendant in black and yellow crossed this, thrust up a second shutter\nand stood waiting.\n\nThis place had the appearance of an ante-room. He saw a number of\npeople in the central space, and at the opposite end a large and\nimposing doorway at the top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but\ngiving a glimpse of some still larger hall beyond. He perceived white\nmen in red and other negroes in black and yellow standing stiffly about\nthose portals.\n\nAs they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, \"The Sleeper,\"\nand was aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation. They entered\nanother little passage in the wall of this ante-chamber, and then he\nfound himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that passed round the\nside of the great hall he had already seen through the curtains. He\nentered the place at the corner, so that he received the fullest\nimpression of its huge proportions. The black in the wasp uniform stood\naside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valve behind him.\n\nCompared with any of the places Graham had seen thus far, this second\nhall appeared to be decorated with extreme richness. On a pedestal at the\nremoter end, and more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a\ngigantic white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe upon his\nbowed shoulders. It was the first thing to strike his attention, it was\nso vast, so patiently and painfully real, so white and simple. Save for\nthis figure and for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the place was\na shining vacancy. The dais was remote in the greatness of the area; it\nwould have looked a mere slab of metal had it not been for the group of\nseven men who stood about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its\nproportions. They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have\narisen that moment from their seats, and they were regarding Graham\nsteadfastly. At the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some\nmechanical appliances.\n\nHoward led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mighty\nlabouring figure. Then he stopped. The two men in red who had followed\nthem into the gallery came and stood on either hand of Graham.\n\n\"You must remain here,\" murmured Howard, \"for a few moments,\" and,\nwithout waiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.\n\n\"But, _why_--?\" began Graham.\n\nHe moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by one of\nthe men in red. \"You have to wait here, Sire,\" said the man in red.\n\n\"_Why_?\"\n\n\"Orders, Sire.\"\n\n\"Whose orders?\"\n\n\"Our orders, Sire.\"\n\nGraham looked his exasperation.\n\n\"What place is this?\" he said presently. \"Who are those men?\"\n\n\"They are the lords of the Council, Sire.\"\n\n\"What Council?\"\n\n\"_The_ Council.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other\nman, went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who\nstood watching him and whispering together.\n\nThe Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the newcomer\nhad arrived he had not observed. They made no gestures of greeting; they\nstood regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might\nhave stood in the street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly\nfloated into view. What council could it be that gathered there, that\nlittle body of men beneath the significant white Atlas, secluded from\nevery eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness? And why should he be\nbrought to them, and be looked at strangely and spoken of inaudibly?\nHoward appeared beneath, walking quickly across the polished floor\ntowards them. As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar\nmovements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then he ascended the steps\nof the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table.\n\nGraham watched that visible inaudible conversation. Occasionally, one of\nthe white-robed men would glance towards him. He strained his ears in\nvain. The gesticulation of two of the speakers became animated. He\nglanced from them to the passive faces of his attendants.... When he\nlooked again Howard was extending his hands and moving his head like a\nman who protests. He was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the\nwhite-robed men rapping the table.\n\nThe conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham's sense. His eyes\nrose to the still giant at whose feet the Council sat. Thence they\nwandered to the walls of the hall. It was decorated in long painted\npanels of a quasi-Japanese type, many of them very beautiful. These\npanels were grouped in a great and elaborate framing of dark metal,\nwhich passed into the metallic caryatidae of the galleries, and the\ngreat structural lines of the interior. The facile grace of these panels\nenhanced the mighty white effort that laboured in the centre of the\nscheme. Graham's eyes came back to the Council, and Howard was\ndescending the steps. As he drew nearer his features could be\ndistinguished, and Graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his\ncheeks. His countenance was still disturbed when presently he reappeared\nalong the gallery.\n\n\"This way,\" he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little\ndoor that opened at their approach. The two men in red stopped on either\nside of this door. Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing\nback, saw the white-robed Council still standing in a close group and\nlooking at him. Then the door closed behind him with a heavy thud, and\nfor the first time since his awakening he was in silence. The floor,\neven, was noiseless to his feet.\n\nHoward opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguous\nchambers furnished in white and green. \"What Council was that?\" began\nGraham. \"What were they discussing? What have they to do with me?\" Howard\nclosed the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something in an\nundertone. He walked slantingways across the room and turned, blowing out\nhis cheeks again. \"Ugh!\" he grunted, a man relieved.\n\nGraham stood regarding him.\n\n\"You must understand,\" began Howard abruptly, avoiding Graham's eyes,\n\"that our social order is very complex. A half explanation, a bare\nunqualified statement would give you false impressions. As a matter of\nfact--it is a case of compound interest partly--your small fortune, and\nthe fortune of your cousin Warming which was left to you--and certain\nother beginnings--have become very considerable. And in other ways that\nwill be hard for you to understand, you have become a person of\nsignificance--of very considerable significance--involved in the\nworld's affairs.\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Graham.\n\n\"We have grave social troubles.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, it is advisable to\nseclude you here.\"\n\n\"Keep me prisoner!\" exclaimed Graham.\n\n\"Well--to ask you to keep in seclusion.\"\n\nGraham turned on him. \"This is strange!\" he said.\n\n\"No harm will be done you.\"\n\n\"No harm!\"\n\n\"But you must be kept here--\"\n\n\"While I learn my position, I presume.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Very well then. Begin. Why _harm_?\"\n\n\"Not now.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It is too long a story, Sire.\"\n\n\"All the more reason I should begin at once. You say I am a person of\nimportance. What was that shouting I heard? Why is a great multitude\nshouting and excited because my trance is over, and who are the men in\nwhite in that huge council chamber?\"\n\n\"All in good time, Sire,\" said Howard. \"But not crudely, not crudely.\nThis is one of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your\nawakening--no one expected your awakening. The Council is consulting.\"\n\n\"What council?\"\n\n\"The Council you saw.\"\n\nGraham made a petulant movement. \"This is not right,\" he said. \"I should\nbe told what is happening.\"\n\n\"You must wait. Really you must wait.\"\n\nGraham sat down abruptly. \"I suppose since I have waited so long to\nresume life,\" he said, \"that I must wait a little longer.\"\n\n\"That is better,\" said Howard. \"Yes, that is much better. And I must\nleave you alone. For a space. While I attend the discussion in the\nCouncil.... I am sorry.\"\n\nHe went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.\n\nGraham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in some\nway he never came to understand, turned about, paced the room restlessly,\nmade the circuit of the room, and sat down. He remained sitting for some\ntime with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his finger nails and\ntrying to piece together the kaleidoscopic impressions of this first hour\nof awakened life; the vast mechanical spaces, the endless series of\nchambers and passages, the great struggle that roared and splashed\nthrough these strange ways, the little group of remote unsympathetic men\nbeneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's mysterious behaviour. There was an\ninkling of some vast inheritance already in his mind--a vast inheritance\nperhaps misapplied--of some unprecedented importance and opportunity.\nWhat had he to do? And this room's secluded silence was eloquent of\nimprisonment!\n\nIt came into Graham's mind with irresistible conviction that this series\nof magnificent impressions was a dream. He tried to shut his eyes and\nsucceeded, but that time-honoured device led to no awakening.\n\nPresently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments\nof the two small rooms in which he found himself.\n\nIn a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished. He\nwas clad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little\ngreyshot beard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked\nnow with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but\npleasing manner. He seemed a man of five-and-forty perhaps. For a moment\nhe did not perceive this was himself.\n\nA flash of laughter came with the recognition. \"To call on old Warming\nlike this!\" he exclaimed, \"and make him take me out to lunch!\"\n\nThen he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiar\nacquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his amusement\nrealised that every soul with whom he might jest had died many score of\nyears ago. The thought smote him abruptly and keenly; he stopped short,\nthe expression of his face changed to a white consternation.\n\nThe tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge fa\u00e7ade of that\nwonderful street reasserted itself. The shouting multitudes came back\nclear and vivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councillors in\nwhite. He felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual,\npitifully conspicuous. And all about him, the world was--_strange_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIN THE SILENT ROOMS\n\n\nPresently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments. Curiosity\nkept him moving in spite of his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived,\nwas high, and its ceiling dome shaped, with an oblong aperture in the\ncentre, opening into a funnel in which a wheel of broad vanes seemed to\nbe rotating, apparently driving the air up the shaft. The faint humming\nnote of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet place. As\nthese vanes sprang up one after the other, Graham could get transient\nglimpses of the sky. He was surprised to see a star.\n\nThis drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these\nrooms was due to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the\ncornices. There were no windows. And he began to recall that along all\nthe vast chambers and passages he had traversed with Howard he had\nobserved no windows at all. Had there been windows? There were windows on\nthe street indeed, but were they for light? Or was the whole city lit day\nand night for evermore, so that there was no night there?\n\nAnd another thing dawned upon him. There was no fireplace in either room.\nWas the season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or was\nthe whole city uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in these\nquestions, began examining the smooth texture of the walls, the simply\nconstructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of\nbedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything was a\ncurious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and colour,\nthat he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several very\ncomfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying several\nbottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance\nlike jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no\nwriting materials. \"The world has changed indeed,\" he said.\n\nHe observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of\npeculiar double cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that\nharmonized with the decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of\nthis side projected a little apparatus about a yard square and having a\nwhite smooth face to the room. A chair faced this. He had a transitory\nidea that these cylinders might be books, or a modern substitute for\nbooks, but at first it did not seem so.\n\nThe lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first sight it seemed like\nRussian. Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about certain\nof the words.\n\n\"Thi Man huwdbi Kin\" forced itself on him as \"The Man who would be King.\"\n\n\"Phonetic spelling,\" he said. He remembered reading a story with that\ntitle, then he recalled the story vividly, one of the best stories in the\nworld. But this thing before him was not a book as he understood it. He\npuzzled out the titles of two adjacent cylinders. \"The Heart of Darkness\"\nhe had never heard of before nor \"The Madonna of the Future\"--no doubt if\nthey were indeed stories, they were by post-Victorian authors.\n\nHe puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it.\nThen he turned to the square apparatus and examined that. He opened a\nsort of lid and found one of the double cylinders within, and on the\nupper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell. He pressed\nthis and a rapid clicking began and ceased. He became aware of voices and\nmusic, and noticed a play of colour on the smooth front face. He suddenly\nrealised what this might be, and stepped back to regard it.\n\nOn the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured, and\nin this picture were figures that moved. Not only did they move, but they\nwere conversing in clear small voices. It was exactly like reality viewed\nthrough an inverted opera glass and heard through a long tube. His\ninterest was seized at once by the situation, which presented a man\npacing up and down and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant\nwoman. Both were in the picturesque costume that seemed so strange to\nGraham. \"I have worked,\" said the man, \"but what have you been doing?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Graham. He forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair.\nWithin five minutes he heard himself, named, heard \"when the Sleeper\nwakes,\" used jestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed\nhimself by, a thing remote and incredible. But in a little while he knew\nthose two people like intimate friends.\n\nAt last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the\napparatus was blank again.\n\nIt was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see,\nunscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire\neconomic struggle; there were allusions he did not understand, incidents\nthat conveyed strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of\ndubious enlightenment. The blue canvas that bulked so largely in his\nfirst impression of the city ways appeared again and again as the costume\nof the common people. He had no doubt the story was contemporary, and its\nintense realism was undeniable. And the end had been a tragedy that\noppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.\n\nHe started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so absorbed in the latter-day\nsubstitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green and white room\nwith more than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening.\n\nHe stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonderland. The\nclearness of the kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast\nplace of streets, the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking\nhour, came back. These people had spoken of the Council with suggestions\nof a vague universality of power. And they had spoken of the Sleeper; it\nhad not really struck him vividly at the time that he was the Sleeper. He\nhad to recall precisely what they had said....\n\nHe walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of\nthe revolving fan. As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise\nof machinery came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence. Though the\nperpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he perceived the little\nintermittent strip of sky was now deep blue--black almost, with a dust of\nlittle stars....\n\nHe resumed his examination of the rooms. He could find no way of opening\nthe padded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance. His\nfeeling of wonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for\ninformation. He wanted to know exactly how he stood to these new things.\nHe tried to compose himself to wait until someone came to him. Presently\nhe became restless and eager for information, for distraction, for fresh\nsensations.\n\nHe went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled out\nthe method of replacing the cylinders by others. As he did so, it came\ninto his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the\nlanguage so that it was still clear and understandable after two hundred\nyears. The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical\nfantasia. At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. He\npresently recognised what appeared to him to be an altered version of the\nstory of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the rendering was\nrealistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did not go\nto a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What was a Pleasure City? A\ndream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.\n\nHe became interested, curious. The story developed with a flavour of\nstrangely twisted sentimentality. Suddenly he did not like it. He liked\nit less as it proceeded.\n\nHe had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, no idealisations,\nbut photographed realities. He wanted no more of the twenty-second\ncentury Venusberg. He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth\ncentury art, and gave way to an archaic indignation. He rose, angry and\nhalf ashamed at himself for witnessing this thing even in solitude. He\npulled forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought for a means\nof stopping its action. Something snapped. A violet spark stung and\nconvulsed his arm and the thing was still. When he attempted next day to\nreplace these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he found the\napparatus broken....\n\nHe struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro, struggling\nwith intolerable vast impressions. The things he had derived from the\ncylinders and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him. It seemed\nto him the most amazing thing of all that in his thirty years of life he\nhad never tried to shape a picture of these coming times. \"We were making\nthe future,\" he said, \"and hardly any of us troubled to think what future\nwe were making. And here it is!\"\n\n\"What have they got to, what has been done? How do I come into the midst\nof it all?\" The vastness of street and house he was prepared for, the\nmultitudes of people. But conflicts in the city ways! And the\nsystematised sensuality of a class of rich men!\n\nHe thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so oddly\nanticipated this actual experience. But here was no Utopia, no\nSocialistic state. He had already seen enough to realise that the ancient\nantithesis of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and abject\npoverty on the other, still prevailed. He knew enough of the essential\nfactors of life to understand that correlation. And not only were the\nbuildings of the city gigantic and the crowds in the street gigantic, but\nthe voices he had heard in the ways, the uneasiness of Howard, the very\natmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent. What country was he in? Still\nEngland it seemed, and yet strangely \"un-English.\" His mind glanced at\nthe rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.\n\nHe prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal\nmight do. He was very tired, with that feverish exhaustion that does not\nadmit of rest. He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to catch\nsome distant echo of the tumults he felt must be proceeding in the city.\n\nHe began to talk to himself. \"Two hundred and three years!\" he said to\nhimself over and over again, laughing stupidly. \"Then I am two hundred\nand thirty-three years old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven't\nreversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the rule of the\noldest. My claims are indisputable. Mumble, mumble. I remember the\nBulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday. 'Tis a great age! Ha\nha!\" He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing, and then laughed\nagain deliberately and louder. Then he realised that he was behaving\nfoolishly. \"Steady,\" he said. \"Steady!\"\n\nHis pacing became more regular. \"This new world,\" he said. \"I don't\nunderstand it. _Why_? ... But it is all _why_!\"\n\n\"I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things. Let me try and\nremember just how it began.\"\n\nHe was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first\nthirty years had become. He remembered fragments, for the most part\ntrivial moments, things of no great importance that he had observed. His\nboyhood seemed the most accessible at first, he recalled school books and\ncertain lessons in mensuration. Then he revived the more salient features\nof his life, memories of the wife long since dead, her magic influence\nnow gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and friends and betrayers, of\nthe decision of this issue and that, and then of his last years of\nmisery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last of his strenuous studies. In\na little while he perceived he had it all again; dim perhaps, like metal\nlong laid aside, but in no way defective or injured, capable of\nre-polishing. And the hue of it was a deepening misery. Was it worth\nre-polishing? By a miracle he had been lifted out of a life that had\nbecome intolerable....\n\nHe reverted to his present condition. He wrestled with the facts in vain.\nIt became an inextricable tangle. He saw the sky through the ventilator\npink with dawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his\nmemory. \"I must sleep,\" he said. It appeared as a delightful relief from\nthis mental distress and from the growing pain and heaviness of his\nlimbs. He went to the strange little bed, lay down and was presently\nasleep....\n\nHe was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments\nbefore he left them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. During\nthat time no one, except Howard, entered the rooms. The marvel of his\nfate mingled with and in some way minimised the marvel of his survival.\nHe had awakened to mankind it seemed only to be snatched away into this\nunaccountable solitude. Howard came regularly with subtly sustaining and\nnutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods, quite strange to Graham.\nHe always closed the door carefully as he entered. On matters of detail\nhe was increasingly obliging, but the bearing of Graham on the great\nissues that were evidently being contested so closely beyond the\nsound-proof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate. He evaded,\nas politely as possible, every question on the position of affairs in the\nouter world.\n\nAnd in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts went far and wide.\nAll that he had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him\nseeing, worked together in his mind. Almost every possible interpretation\nof his position he debated--even as it chanced, the right interpretation.\nThings that presently happened to him, came to him at last credible, by\nvirtue of this seclusion. When at length the moment of his release\narrived, it found him prepared....\n\nHoward's bearing went far to deepen Graham's impression of his own\nstrange importance; the door between its opening and closing seemed to\nadmit with him a breath of momentous happening. His enquiries became\nmore definite and searching. Howard retreated through protests and\ndifficulties. The awakening was unforeseen, he repeated; it happened\nto have fallen in with the trend of a social convulsion. \"To explain\nit I must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years,\"\nprotested Howard.\n\n\"The thing is this,\" said Graham. \"You are afraid of something I shall\ndo. In some way I am arbitrator--I might be arbitrator.\"\n\n\"It is not that. But you have--I may tell you this much--the automatic\nincrease of your property puts great possibilities of interference in\nyour hands. And in certain other ways you have influence, with your\neighteenth century notions.\"\n\n\"Nineteenth century,\" corrected Graham.\n\n\"With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every\nfeature of our State.\"\n\n\"Am I a fool?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?\"\n\n\"You were never expected to act at all. No one counted on your\nawakening. No one dreamt you would ever awake. The Council had surrounded\nyou with antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact, we thought that you\nwere dead--a mere arrest of decay. And--but it is too complex. We dare\nnot suddenly---while you are still half awake.\"\n\n\"It won't do,\" said Graham. \"Suppose it is as you say--why am I not being\ncrammed night and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the\ntime to fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now than two days\nago, if it is two days, when I awoke?\"\n\nHoward pulled his lip.\n\n\"I am beginning to feel--every hour I feel more clearly--a system of\nconcealment of which you are the face. Is this Council, or committee, or\nwhatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate? Is that it?\"\n\n\"That note of suspicion--\" said Howard.\n\n\"Ugh!\" said Graham. \"Now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who\nhave put me here. It will be ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I am\nalive. Every day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more\nvigorous. No more quiescence. I am a man come back to life. And I want\nto _live_--\"\n\n\"_Live_!\"\n\nHoward's face lit with an idea. He came towards Graham and spoke in an\neasy confidential tone.\n\n\"The Council secludes you here for your good. You are restless.\nNaturally--an energetic man! You find it dull here. But we are anxious\nthat everything you may desire--every desire--every sort of desire ...\nThere may be something. Is there any sort of company?\"\n\nHe paused meaningly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham thoughtfully. \"There is.\"\n\n\"Ah! _Now_! We have treated you neglectfully.\"\n\n\"The crowds in yonder streets of yours.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Howard, \"I am afraid--But--\"\n\nGraham began pacing the room. Howard stood near the door watching him.\nThe implication of Howard's suggestion was only half evident to Graham.\nCompany? Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some sort of\n_company_? Would there be any possibilities of gathering from the\nconversation of this additional person some vague inkling of the struggle\nthat had broken out so vividly at his waking moment? He meditated again,\nand the suggestion took colour. He turned on Howard abruptly.\n\n\"What do you mean by company?\"\n\nHoward raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \"Human beings,\" he\nsaid, with a curious smile on his heavy face. \"Our social ideas,\" he\nsaid, \"have a certain increased liberality, perhaps, in comparison with\nyour times. If a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as this--by feminine\nsociety, for instance. We think it no scandal. We have cleared our minds\nof formulae. There is in our city a class, a necessary class, no longer\ndespised--discreet--\"\n\nGraham stopped dead.\n\n\"It would pass the time,\" said Howard. \"It is a thing I should perhaps\nhave thought of before, but, as a matter of fact, so much is happening--\"\n\nHe indicated the exterior world.\n\nGraham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a possible woman dominated\nhis mind with an intense attraction. Then he flashed into anger.\n\n\"_No_!\" he shouted.\n\nHe began striding rapidly up and down the room. \"Everything you say,\neverything you do, convinces me--of some great issue in which I am\nconcerned. I do not want to pass the time, as you call it. Yes, I know.\nDesire and indulgence are life in a sense--and Death! Extinction! In my\nlife before I slept I had worked out that pitiful question. I will not\nbegin again. There is a city, a multitude--. And meanwhile I am here like\na rabbit in a bag.\"\n\nHis rage surged high. He choked for a moment and began to wave his\nclenched fists. He gave way to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses. His\ngestures had the quality of physical threats.\n\n\"I do not know who your party may be. I am in the dark, and you keep me\nin the dark. But I know this, that I am secluded here for no good\npurpose. For no good purpose. I warn you, I warn you of the consequences.\nOnce I come at my power--\"\n\nHe realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself. He\nstopped. Howard stood regarding him with a curious expression.\n\n\"I take it this is a message to the Council,\" said Howard.\n\nGraham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man, fell or stun him. It\nmust have shown upon his face; at any rate Howard's movement was quick.\nIn a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the man from the\nnineteenth century was alone.\n\nFor a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands half raised. Then he\nflung them down. \"What a fool I have been!\" he said, and gave way to his\nanger again, stamping about the room and shouting curses.... For a long\ntime he kept himself in a sort of frenzy, raging at his position, at his\nown folly, at the knaves who had imprisoned him. He did this because he\ndid not want to look calmly at his position. He clung to his\nanger--because he was afraid of fear.\n\nPresently he found himself reasoning with himself. This imprisonment\nwas unaccountable, but no doubt the legal forms--new legal forms--of\nthe time permitted it. It must, of course, be legal. These people were\ntwo hundred years further on in the march of civilisation than the\nVictorian generation. It was not likely they would be less--humane. Yet\nthey had cleared their minds of formulae! Was humanity a formula as\nwell as chastity?\n\nHis imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him.\nThe attempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions, though for\nthe most part logically valid, were quite unavailing. \"Why should\nanything be done to me?\"\n\n\"If the worst comes to the worst,\" he found himself saying at last, \"I\ncan give up what they want. But what do they want? And why don't they ask\nme for it instead of cooping me up?\"\n\nHe returned to his former preoccupation with the Council's possible\nintentions. He began to reconsider the details of Howard's behaviour,\nsinister glances, inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind\ncircled about the idea of escaping from these rooms; but whither could he\nescape into this vast, crowded world? He would be worse off than a Saxon\nyeoman suddenly dropped into nineteenth century London. And besides, how\ncould anyone escape from these rooms?\n\n\"How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me?\"\n\nHe thought of the tumult, the great social trouble of which he was so\nunaccountably the axis. A text, irrelevant enough, and yet curiously\ninsistent, came floating up out of the darkness of his memory. This also\na Council had said:\n\n\"It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE ROOF SPACES\n\n\nAs the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and\npermitted glimpses of the night, dim sounds drifted in thereby. And\nGraham, standing underneath, was startled by the sound of a voice.\n\nHe peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, dark and dim, the\nface and shoulders of a man regarding him. Then a dark hand was extended,\nthe swift vane struck it, swung round and beat on with a little brownish\npatch on the edge of its thin blade, and something began to fall\ntherefrom upon the floor, dripping silently.\n\nGraham looked down, and there were spots of blood at his feet. He looked\nup again in a strange excitement. The figure had gone.\n\nHe remained motionless--his every sense intent upon the flickering patch\nof darkness. He became aware of some faint, remote, dark specks floating\nlightly through the outer air. They came down towards him, fitfully,\neddyingly, and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan. A gleam of\nlight flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness came\nagain. Warmed and lit as he was, he perceived that it was snowing within\na few feet of him.\n\nGraham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. He\nsaw the head of a man pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then a\nsmart blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vanes\nstopped. A gust of snowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before\nthey touched the floor. \"Don't be afraid,\" said a voice.\n\nGraham stood under the vane. \"Who are you?\" he whispered.\n\nFor a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan, and then the\nhead of a man was thrust cautiously into the opening. His face\nappeared nearly inverted to Graham; his dark hair was wet with\ndissolving flakes of snow upon it. His arm went up into the darkness\nholding something unseen. He had a youthful face and bright eyes, and\nthe veins of his forehead were swollen. He seemed to be exerting\nhimself to maintain his position.\n\nFor several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.\n\n\"You were the Sleeper?\" said the stranger at last.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"I come from Ostrog, Sire.\"\n\n\"Ostrog?\"\n\nThe man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was\ntowards Graham. He appeared to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty\nexclamation, and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape the\nsweep of the released fan. And when Graham peered up there was nothing\nvisible but the slowly falling snow.\n\nIt was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the\nventilator. But at last came the same metallic interference again; the\nfans stopped and the face reappeared. Graham had remained all this time\nin the same place, alert and tremulously excited.\n\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak to you, Sire,\" said the intruder. \"We want--I\ncan't hold the thing. We have been trying to find a way to you--these\nthree days.\"\n\n\"Is it rescue?\" whispered Graham. \"Escape?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire. If you will.\"\n\n\"You are my party--the party of the Sleeper?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\" said Graham.\n\nThere was a struggle. The stranger's arm appeared, and his hand was\nbleeding. His knees came into view over the edge of the funnel. \"Stand\naway from me,\" he said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and\none shoulder at Graham's feet. The released ventilator whirled noisily.\nThe stranger rolled over, sprang up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a\nbruised shoulder, and with his bright eyes on Graham.\n\n\"You are indeed the Sleeper,\" he said. \"I saw you asleep. When it was the\nlaw that anyone might see you.\"\n\n\"I am the man who was in the trance,\" said Graham. \"They have imprisoned\nme here. I have been here since I awoke--at least three days.\"\n\nThe intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at\nthe door, and suddenly left Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick\nincoherent words. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand, and he\nbegan tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon the hinges. \"Mind!\"\ncried a voice. \"Oh!\" The voice came from above.\n\nGraham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked, was struck on the\nshoulder by one of them, and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. He\nfell on his knees and forward, and the weight went over his head. He\nknelt up and saw a second man from above seated before him.\n\n\"I did not see you, Sire,\" panted the man. He rose and assisted\nGraham to rise. \"Are you hurt, Sire?\" he panted. A succession of heavy\nblows on the ventilator began, something fell close to Graham's face,\nand a shivering edge of white metal danced, fell over, and lay fiat\nupon the floor.\n\n\"What is this?\" cried Graham, confused and looking at the ventilator.\n\"Who are you? What are you going to do? Remember, I understand nothing.\"\n\n\"Stand back,\" said the stranger, and drew him from under the ventilator\nas another fragment of metal fell heavily.\n\n\"We want you to come, Sire,\" panted the newcomer, and Graham glancing at\nhis face again, saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his\nforehead, and a couple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom.\n\"Your people call for you.\"\n\n\"Come where? My people?\"\n\n\"To the hall about the markets. Your life is in danger here. We have\nspies. We learned but just in time. The Council has decided--this very\nday--either to drug or kill you. And everything is ready. The people are\ndrilled, the Wind-Vane police, the engineers, and half the way-gearers\nare with us. We have the halls crowded--shouting. The whole city shouts\nagainst the Council. We have arms.\" He wiped the blood with his hand.\n\"Your life here is not worth--\"\n\n\"But why arms?\"\n\n\"The people have risen to protect you, Sire. What?\"\n\nHe turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing with\nhis teeth. Graham saw the latter start back, gesticulate to them to\nconceal themselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening door.\n\nAs he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one hand and his heavy\nface downcast. He started, looked up, the door slammed behind him, the\ntray tilted side-ways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear. He\nwent down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell athwart the floor of the\nouter room. The man who had struck him bent hastily, studied his face for\na moment, rose, and returned to his work at the door.\n\n\"Your poison!\" said a voice in Graham's ear.\n\nThen abruptly they were in darkness. The innumerable cornice lights had\nbeen extinguished. Graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly\nsnow whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three knelt on\nthe vane. Some dim thing--a ladder--was being lowered through the\nopening, and a hand appeared holding a fitful yellow light.\n\nHe had a moment of hesitation. But the manner of these men, their swift\nalacrity, their words, marched so completely with his own fears of the\nCouncil, with his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a moment.\nAnd his people awaited him!\n\n\"I do not understand,\" he said. \"I trust. Tell me what to do.\"\n\nThe man with the cut brow gripped Graham's arm. \"Clamber up the ladder,\"\nhe whispered. \"Quick. They will have heard--\"\n\nGraham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put his foot on the\nlower rung, and, turning his head, saw over the shoulder of the nearest\nman, in the yellow flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over\nHoward and still working at the door. Graham turned to the ladder again,\nand was thrust by his conductor and helped up by those above, and then\nhe was standing on something hard and cold and slippery outside the\nventilating funnel.\n\nHe shivered. He was aware of a great difference in the temperature. Half\na dozen men stood about him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and\nface and melted. For a moment it was dark, then for a flash a ghastly\nviolet white, and then everything was dark again.\n\nHe saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which had\nreplaced the miscellaneous houses, streets and open spaces of Victorian\nLondon. The place upon which he stood was level, with huge serpentine\ncables lying athwart it in every direction. The circular wheels of a\nnumber of windmills loomed indistinct and gigantic through the darkness\nand snowfall, and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful wind rose\nand fell. Some way off an intermittent white light smote up from below,\ntouched the snow eddies with a transient glitter, and made an evanescent\nspectre in the night; and here and there, low down, some vaguely outlined\nwind-driven mechanism flickered with livid sparks.\n\nAll this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood\nabout him. Someone threw a thick soft cloak of fur-like texture about\nhim, and fastened it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things\nwere said briefly, decisively. Someone thrust him forward.\n\nBefore his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm. \"This way,\"\nsaid this shape, urging him along, and pointed Graham across the flat\nroof in the direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham obeyed.\n\n\"Mind!\" said a voice, as Graham stumbled against a cable. \"Between them\nand not across them,\" said the voice. And, \"We must hurry.\"\n\n\"Where are the people?\" said Graham. \"The people you said awaited me?\"\n\nThe stranger did not answer. He left Graham's arm as the path grew\nnarrower, and led the way with rapid strides. Graham followed blindly. In\na minute he found himself running. \"Are the others coming?\" he panted,\nbut received no reply. His companion glanced back and ran on. They came\nto a sort of pathway of open metal-work, transverse to the direction they\nhad come, and they turned aside to follow this. Graham looked back, but\nthe snowstorm had hidden the others.\n\n\"Come on!\" said his guide. Running now, they drew near a little windmill\nspinning high in the air. \"Stoop,\" said Graham's guide, and they avoided\nan endless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. \"This way!\"\nand they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow,\nbetween two low walls of metal that presently rose waist high. \"I will go\nfirst,\" said the guide. Graham drew his cloak about him and followed.\nThen suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter leapt to the\nsnowy darkness of the further side. Graham peeped over the side once and\nthe gulf was black. For a moment he regretted his flight. He dared not\nlook again, and his brain spun as he waded through the half liquid snow.\n\nThen out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat\nspace damp with thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly translucent\nto lights that went to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable\nlooking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and so they came to\nand clambered up slippery steps to the rim of a great dome of glass.\nRound this they went. Far below a number of people seemed to be dancing,\nand music filtered through the dome.... Graham fancied he heard a\nshouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him on with a new\nspurt of haste. They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills, one\nso vast that only the lower edge of its vanes came rushing into sight and\nrushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. They hurried for\na time through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came at\nlast above a place of moving platforms like the place into which Graham\nhad looked from the balcony. They crawled across the sloping transparency\nthat covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands and knees\nbecause of the slipperiness of the snowfall.\n\nFor the most part the glass was bedewed, and Graham saw only hazy\nsuggestions of the forms below, but near the pitch of the transparent\nroof the glass was clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down\nupon it all. For awhile, in spite of the urgency of his guide, he gave\nway to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the glass, sick and paralysed.\nFar below, mere stirring specks and dots, went the people of the\nunsleeping city in their perpetual daylight, and the moving platforms\nran on their incessant journey. Messengers and men on unknown\nbusinesses shot along the drooping cables and the frail bridges were\ncrowded with men. It was like peering into a gigantic glass hive, and\nit lay vertically below him with only a tough glass of unknown\nthickness to save him from a fall. The street showed warm and lit, and\nGraham was wet now to the skin with thawing snow, and his feet were\nnumbed with cold. For a space he could not move. \"Come on!\" cried his\nguide, with terror in his voice. \"Come on!\"\n\nGraham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.\n\nOver the ridge, following his guide's example, he turned about and slid\nbackward down the opposite slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche of\nsnow. While he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some broken\ngap should come in his way. At the edge he stumbled to his feet ankle\ndeep in slush, thanking heaven for an opaque footing again. His guide was\nalready clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse.\n\nThrough the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast\nwindmills, and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels\nwas pierced with a deafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling of\nextraordinary intensity that seemed to come simultaneously from every\npoint of the compass.\n\n\"They have missed us already!\" cried Graham's guide in an accent of\nterror, and suddenly, with a blinding flash, the night became day.\n\nAbove the driving snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, appeared\nvast masts carrying globes of livid light. They receded in illimitable\nvistas in every direction. As far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall\nthey glared.\n\n\"Get on this,\" cried Graham's conductor, and thrust him forward to a long\ngrating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly\nsloping expanses of snow. It felt warm to Graham's benumbed feet, and a\nfaint eddy of steam rose from it.\n\n\"Come on!\" shouted his guide ten yards off, and, without waiting, ran\nswiftly through the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the\nnext range of wind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonishment,\nfollowed as fast, convinced of his imminent capture....\n\nIn a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black\nshadows shot with moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels. Graham's\nconductor ran on for some time, and suddenly darted sideways and vanished\ninto a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge support. In\nanother moment Graham was beside him.\n\nThey cowered panting and stared out.\n\nThe scene upon which Graham looked was very wild and strange. The snow\nhad now almost ceased; only a belated flake passed now and again across\nthe picture. But the broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly\nwhite, broken only by gigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy\nstrips of impenetrable darkness, vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All\nabout them, huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly vast as it\nseemed to him, interlaced, and the edges of wind-wheels, scarcely moving\nin the lull, passed in great shining curves steeper and steeper up into a\nluminous haze. Wherever the snow-spangled light struck down, beams and\ngirders, and incessant bands running with a halting, indomitable\nresolution, passed upward and downward into the black. And with all that\nmighty activity, with an omnipresent sense of motive and design, this\nsnow-clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save\nthemselves, seemed as trackless and deserted and unfrequented by men as\nsome inaccessible Alpine snowfield.\n\n\"They will be chasing us,\" cried the leader. \"We are scarcely halfway\nthere yet. Cold as it is we must hide here for a space--at least until it\nsnows more thickly again.\"\n\nHis teeth chattered in his head.\n\n\"Where are the markets?\" asked Graham staring out. \"Where are all\nthe people?\"\n\nThe other made no answer.\n\n\"_Look_!\" whispered Graham, crouched close, and became very still.\n\nThe snow had suddenly become thick again, and sliding with the whirling\neddies out of the black pit of the sky came something, vague and large\nand very swift. It came down in a steep curve and swept round, wide wings\nextended and a trail of white condensing steam behind it, rose with an\neasy swiftness and went gliding up the air, swept horizontally forward in\na wide curve, and vanished again in the steaming specks of snow. And,\nthrough the ribs of its body, Graham saw two little men, very minute and\nactive, searching the snowy areas about him, as it seemed to him, with\nfield glasses. For a second they were clear, then hazy through a thick\nwhirl of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they were gone.\n\n\"_Now_!\" cried his companion. \"Come!\"\n\nHe pulled Graham's sleeve, and incontinently the two were running\nheadlong down the arcade of iron-work beneath the wind-wheels. Graham,\nrunning blindly, collided with his leader, who had turned back on him\nsuddenly. He found himself within a dozen yards of a black chasm. It\nextended as far as he could see right and left. It seemed to cut off\ntheir progress in either direction.\n\n\"Do as I do,\" whispered his guide. He lay down and crawled to the edge,\nthrust his head over and twisted until one leg hung. He seemed to feel\nfor something with his foot, found it, and went sliding over the edge\ninto the gulf. His head reappeared. \"It is a ledge,\" he whispered. \"In\nthe dark all the way along. Do as I did.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, went down upon all fours, crawled to the edge, and\npeered into a velvety blackness. For a sickly moment he had courage\nneither to go on nor retreat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt his\nguide's hands pulling at him, had a horrible sensation of sliding over\nthe edge into the unfathomable, splashed, and felt himself in a slushy\ngutter, impenetrably dark.\n\n\"This way,\" whispered the voice, and he began crawling along the gutter\nthrough the trickling thaw, pressing himself against the wall. They\ncontinued along it for some minutes. He seemed to pass through a hundred\nstages of misery, to pass minute after minute through a hundred degrees\nof cold, damp, and exhaustion. In a little while he ceased to feel his\nhands and feet.\n\nThe gutter sloped downwards. He observed that they were now many feet\nbelow the edge of the buildings. Rows of spectral white shapes like the\nghosts of blind-drawn windows rose above them. They came to the end of a\ncable fastened above one of these white windows, dimly visible and\ndropping into impenetrable shadows. Suddenly his hand came against his\nguide's. \"_Still_!\" whispered the latter very softly.\n\nHe looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine\ngliding slowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of\nsnow-flecked grey-blue sky. In a moment it was hidden again.\n\n\"Keep still; they were just turning.\"\n\nFor awhile both were motionless, then Graham's companion stood up, and\nreaching towards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some\nindistinct tackle.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Graham.\n\nThe only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched motionless. Graham\npeered and saw his face dimly. He was staring down the long ribbon of\nsky, and Graham, following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and\nfaint and remote. Then he saw that the wings spread on either side, that\nit headed towards them, that every moment it grew larger. It was\nfollowing the edge of the chasm towards them.\n\nThe man's movements became convulsive. He thrust two cross bars into\nGraham's hand. Graham could not see them, he ascertained their form by\nfeeling. They were slung by thin cords to the cable. On the cord were\nhand grips of some soft elastic substance. \"Put the cross between your\nlegs,\" whispered the guide hysterically, \"and grip the holdfasts. Grip\ntightly, grip!\"\n\nGraham did as he was told.\n\n\"Jump,\" said the voice. \"In heaven's name, jump!\"\n\nFor one momentous second Graham could not speak. He was glad afterwards\nthat darkness hid his face. He said nothing. He began to tremble\nviolently. He looked sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the\nsky as it rushed upon him.\n\n\"Jump! Jump--in God's name! Or they will have us,\" cried Graham's guide,\nand in the violence of his passion thrust him forward.\n\nGraham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a cry in spite of\nhimself, and then, as the flying machine swept over them, fell forward\ninto the pit of that darkness, seated on the cross wood and holding the\nropes with the clutch of death. Something cracked, something rapped\nsmartly against a wall. He heard the pulley of the cradle hum on its\nrope. He heard the aeronauts shout. He felt a pair of knees digging into\nhis back.... He was sweeping headlong through the air, falling through\nthe air. All his strength was in his hands. He would have screamed but he\nhad no breath.\n\nHe shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter. He\nrecognised the great passage with the running ways, the hanging lights\nand interlacing girders. They rushed upward and by him. He had a\nmomentary impression of a great round mouth yawning to swallow him up.\n\nHe was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping with aching hands,\nand behold! a clap of sound, a burst of light, and he was in a brightly\nlit hall with a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. The people!\nHis people! A proscenium, a stage rushed up towards him, and his cable\nswept down to a circular aperture to the right of this. He felt he was\ntravelling slower, and suddenly very much slower. He distinguished shouts\nof \"Saved! The Master. He is safe!\" The stage rushed up towards him with\nrapidly diminishing swiftness. Then--\n\nHe heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified, and\nthis shout was echoed by a shout from below. He felt that he was no\nlonger gliding along the cable but falling with it. There was a tumult of\nyells, screams, and cries. He felt something soft against his extended\nhand, and the impact of a broken fall quivering through his arm....\n\nHe wanted to be still and the people were lifting him. He believed\nafterwards he was carried to the platform and given some drink, but he\nwas never sure. He did not notice what became of his guide. When his mind\nwas clear again he was on his feet; eager hands were assisting him to\nstand. He was in a big alcove, occupying the position that in his\nprevious experience had been devoted to the lower boxes. If this was\nindeed a theatre.\n\nA mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar, the shouting of a\ncountless multitude. \"It is the Sleeper! The Sleeper is with us!\"\n\n\"The Sleeper is with us! The Master--the Owner! The Master is with us.\nHe is safe.\"\n\nGraham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people. He saw\nno individuals, he was conscious of a froth of pink faces, of waving arms\nand garments, he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over\nhim, buoying him up. There were balconies, galleries, great archways\ngiving remoter perspectives, and everywhere people, a vast arena of\npeople, densely packed and cheering. Across the nearer space lay the\ncollapsed cable like a huge snake. It had been cut by the men of the\nflying machine at its upper end, and had crumpled down into the hall. Men\nseemed to be hauling this out of the way. But the whole effect was vague,\nthe very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices.\n\nHe stood unsteadily and looked at those about him. Someone supported him\nby one arm. \"Let me go into a little room,\" he said, weeping; \"a little\nroom,\" and could say no more. A man in black stepped forward, took his\ndisengaged arm. He was aware of officious men opening a door before him.\nSomeone guided him to a seat. He staggered. He sat down heavily and\ncovered his face with his hands; he was trembling violently, his nervous\ncontrol was at an end. He was relieved of his cloak, he could not\nremember how; his purple hose he saw were black with wet. People were\nrunning about him, things were happening, but for some time he gave no\nheed to them.\n\nHe had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that. He was safe. These were\nthe people who were on his side. For a space he sobbed for breath, and\nthen he sat still with his face covered. The air was full of the shouting\nof innumerable men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE PEOPLE MARCH\n\n\nHe became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his\nattention, looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow\ngarment. He took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was glowing. A\ntall man in a black robe stood by his shoulder, and pointed to the half\nopen door into the hall. This man was shouting close to his ear and yet\nwhat was said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar from the\ngreat theatre. Behind the man was a girl in a silvery grey robe, whom\nGraham, even in this confusion, perceived to be beautiful. Her dark eyes,\nfull of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on him, her lips trembled apart.\nA partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall, and admitted\na vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping and shouting that died away\nand began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch, and so continued\nintermittently all the time that Graham remained in the little room. He\nwatched the lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some\nexplanation.\n\nHe stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up\nabruptly; he grasped the arm of this shouting person.\n\n\"Tell me!\" he cried. \"Who am I? Who am I?\"\n\nThe others came nearer to hear his words. \"Who am I?\" His eyes searched\ntheir faces.\n\n\"They have told him nothing!\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Tell me, tell me!\" cried Graham.\n\n\"You are the Master of the Earth. You are owner of the world.\"\n\nHe did not believe he heard aright. He resisted the persuasion. He\npretended not to understand, not to hear. He lifted his voice again. \"I\nhave been awake three days--a prisoner three days. I judge there is some\nstruggle between a number of people in this city--it is London?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the younger man.\n\n\"And those who meet in the great hall with the white Atlas? How does it\nconcern me? In some way it has to do with me. _Why_, I don't know. Drugs?\nIt seems to me that while I have slept the world has gone mad. I have\ngone mad.... Who are those Councillors under the Atlas? Why should they\ntry to drug me?\"\n\n\"To keep you insensible,\" said the man in yellow. \"To prevent your\ninterference.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\"\n\n\"Because _you_ are the Atlas, Sire,\" said the man in yellow. \"The world\nis on your shoulders. They rule it in your name.\"\n\nThe sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one\nmonotonous voice. Now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came a\ndeafening tumult, a roaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer,\nvoices hoarse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted the\npeople in the little room could not hear each other shout.\n\nGraham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had\njust heard. \"The Council,\" he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a\nname that had struck him. \"But who is Ostrog?\" he said.\n\n\"He is the organiser--the organiser of the revolt. Our Leader--in\nyour name.\"\n\n\"In my name?--And you? Why is he not here?\"\n\n\"He--has deputed us. I am his brother--his half-brother, Lincoln. He\nwants you to show yourself to these people and then come on to him. That\nis why he has sent. He is at the wind-vane offices directing. The people\nare marching.\"\n\n\"In your name,\" shouted the younger man. \"They have ruled, crushed,\ntyrannised. At last even--\"\n\n\"In my name! My name! Master?\"\n\nThe younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder,\nindignant and vociferous, a high penetrating voice under his red\naquiline nose and bushy moustache. \"No one expected you to wake. No one\nexpected you to wake. They were cunning. Damned tyrants! But they were\ntaken by surprise. They did not know whether to drug you, hypnotise you,\nkill you.\"\n\nAgain the hall dominated everything.\n\n\"Ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready--. Even now there is a rumour\nof fighting beginning.\"\n\nThe man who had called himself Lincoln came close to him. \"Ostrog has it\nplanned. Trust him. We have our organisations ready. We shall seize the\nflying stages--. Even now he may be doing that. Then--\"\n\n\"This public theatre,\" bawled the man in yellow, \"is only a contingent.\nWe have five myriads of drilled men--\"\n\n\"We have arms,\" cried Lincoln. \"We have plans. A leader. Their police\nhave gone from the streets and are massed in the--\" (inaudible). \"It is\nnow or never. The Council is rocking--They cannot trust even their\ndrilled men--\"\n\n\"Hear the people calling to you!\"\n\nGraham's mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds, now dark and\nhopeless, now clear and ghastly. He was Master of the Earth, he was a man\nsodden with thawing snow. Of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant\nones presented an antagonism; on the one hand was the White Council,\npowerful, disciplined, few, the White Council from which he had just\nescaped; and on the other, monstrous crowds, packed masses of\nindistinguishable people clamouring his name, hailing him Master. The\nother side had imprisoned him, debated his death. These shouting\nthousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him. But why these things\nshould be so he could not understand.\n\nThe door opened, Lincoln's voice was swept away and drowned, and a rash\nof people followed on the heels of the tumult. These intruders came\ntowards him and Lincoln gesticulating. The voices without explained their\nsoundless lips. \"Show us the Sleeper, show us the Sleeper!\" was the\nburden of the uproar. Men were bawling for \"Order! Silence!\"\n\nGraham glanced towards the open doorway, and saw a tall, oblong picture\nof the hall beyond, a waving, incessant confusion of crowded, shouting\nfaces, men and women together, waving pale blue garments, extended hands.\nMany were standing, one man in rags of dark brown, a gaunt figure, stood\non the seat and waved a black cloth. He met the wonder and expectation of\nthe girl's eyes. What did these people expect from him. He was dimly\naware that the tumult outside had changed its character, was in some way\nbeating, marching. His own mind, too, changed. For a space he did not\nrecognise the influence that was transforming him. But a moment that was\nnear to panic passed. He tried to make audible inquiries of what was\nrequired of him.\n\nLincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was deafened to that. All the\nothers save the woman gesticulated towards the hall. He perceived what\nhad happened to the uproar. The whole mass of people was chanting\ntogether. It was not simply a song, the voices were gathered together and\nupborne by a torrent of instrumental music, music like the music of an\norgan, a woven texture of sounds, full of trumpets, full of flaunting\nbanners, full of the march and pageantry of opening war. And the feet of\nthe people were beating time--tramp, tramp.\n\nHe was urged towards the door. He obeyed mechanically. The strength of\nthat chant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. The hall opened\nto him, a vast welter of fluttering colour swaying to the music.\n\n\"Wave your arm to them,\" said Lincoln. \"Wave your arm to them.\"\n\n\"This,\" said a voice on the other side, \"he must have this.\" Arms were\nabout his neck detaining him in the doorway, and a black\nsubtly-folding mantle hung from his shoulders. He threw his arm free\nof this and followed Lincoln. He perceived the girl in grey close to\nhim, her face lit, her gesture onward. For the instant she became to\nhim, flushed and eager as she was, an embodiment of the song. He\nemerged in the alcove again. Incontinently the mounting waves of the\nsong broke upon his appearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting.\nGuided by Lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the centre of the\nstage facing the people.\n\nThe hall was a vast and intricate space--galleries, balconies, broad\nspaces of amphitheatral steps, and great archways. Far away, high up,\nseemed the mouth of a huge passage full of struggling humanity. The whole\nmultitude was swaying in congested masses. Individual figures sprang out\nof the tumult, impressed him momentarily, and lost definition again.\nClose to the platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by three\nmen, her hair across her face and brandishing a green staff. Next this\ngroup an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained his place in the\ncrush with difficulty, and behind shouted a hairless face, a great cavity\nof toothless mouth. A voice called that enigmatical word \"Ostrog.\" All\nhis impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling\nsong. The multitude were beating time with their feet--marking time,\ntramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The green weapons waved, flashed and slanted.\nThen he saw those nearest to him on a level space before the stage were\nmarching in front of him, passing towards a great archway, shouting \"To\nthe Council!\" Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. He raised his arm, and the\nroaring was redoubled. He remembered he had to shout \"March!\" His mouth\nshaped inaudible heroic words. He waved his arm again and pointed to the\narchway, shouting \"Onward!\" They were no longer marking time, they were\nmarching; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. In that host were bearded men, old\nmen, youths, fluttering robed bare-armed women, girls. Men and women of\nthe new age! Rich robes, grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of\ntheir movement amidst the dominant blue. A monstrous black banner jerked\nits way to the right. He perceived a blue-clad negro, a shrivelled woman\nin yellow, then a group of tall fair-haired, white-faced, blue-clad men\npushed theatrically past him. He noted two Chinamen. A tall, sallow,\ndark-haired, shining-eyed youth, white clad from top to toe, clambered up\ntowards the platform shouting loyally, and sprang down again and receded,\nlooking backward. Heads, shoulders, hands clutching weapons, all were\nswinging with those marching cadences.\n\nFaces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his\nand passed and vanished. Men gesticulated to him, shouted inaudible\npersonal things. Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly\nwhite. And disease was there, and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt\nand lean. Men and women of the new age! Strange and incredible meeting!\nAs the broad stream passed before him to the right, tributary gangways\nfrom the remote uplands of the hall thrust downward in an incessant\nreplacement of people; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The unison of the song\nwas enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches and\npassages. Men and women mingled in the ranks; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\nThe whole world seemed marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his brain\nwas tramping. The garments waved onward, the faces poured by more\nabundantly.\n\nTramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln's pressure he turned towards the\narchway, walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his\nmovement for the melody and stir of it. The multitude, the gesture and\nsong, all moved in that direction, the flow of people smote downward\nuntil the upturned faces were below the level of his feet. He was aware\nof a path before him, of a suite about him, of guards and dignities, and\nLincoln on his right hand. Attendants intervened, and ever and again\nblotted out the sight of the multitude to the left. Before him went the\nbacks of the guards in black--three and three and three. He was marched\nalong a little railed way, and crossed above the archway, with the\ntorrent dipping to flow beneath, and shouting up to him. He did not know\nwhither he went; he did not want to know. He glanced back across a\nflaming spaciousness of hall. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE DARKNESS\n\n\nHe was no longer in the hall. He was marching along a gallery overhanging\none of the great streets of the moving platforms that traversed the city.\nBefore him and behind him tramped his guards. The whole concave of the\nmoving ways below was a congested mass of people marching, tramping to\nthe left, shouting, waving hands and arms, pouring along a huge vista,\nshouting as they came into view, shouting as they passed, shouting as\nthey receded, until the globes of electric light receding in perspective\ndropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bare heads. Tramp, tramp,\ntramp, tramp.\n\nThe song roared up to Graham now, no longer upborne by music, but coarse\nand noisy, and the beating of the marching feet, tramp, tramp, tramp,\ntramp, interwove with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the\nundisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways.\n\nAbruptly he noted a contrast. The buildings on the opposite side of the\nway seemed deserted, the cables and bridges that laced across the aisle\nwere empty and shadowy. It came into Graham's mind that these also should\nhave swarmed with people.\n\nHe felt a curious emotion--throbbing--very fast! He stopped again. The\nguards before him marched on; those about him stopped as he did. He saw\nanxiety and fear in their faces. The throbbing had something to do with\nthe lights. He too looked up.\n\nAt first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights simply, an\nisolated phenomenon, having no bearing on the things below. Each huge\nglobe of blinding whiteness was as it were clutched, compressed in a\nsystole that was followed by a transitory diastole, and again a systole\nlike a tightening grip, darkness, light, darkness, in rapid alternation.\n\nGraham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to do\nwith the people below. The appearance of the houses and ways, the\nappearance of the packed masses changed, became a confusion of vivid\nlights and leaping shadows. He saw a multitude of shadows had sprung into\naggressive existence, seemed rushing up, broadening, widening, growing\nwith steady swiftness--to leap suddenly back and return reinforced. The\nsong and the tramping had ceased. The unanimous march, he discovered, was\narrested, there were eddies, a flow sideways, shouts of \"The lights!\"\nVoices were crying together one thing. \"The lights!\" cried these voices.\n\"The lights!\" He looked down. In this dancing death of the lights the\narea of the street had suddenly become a monstrous struggle. The huge\nwhite globes became purple-white, purple with a reddish glow, flickered,\nflickered faster and faster, fluttered between light and extinction,\nceased to flicker and became mere fading specks of glowing red in a vast\nobscurity. In ten seconds the extinction was accomplished, and there was\nonly this roaring darkness, a black monstrosity that had suddenly\nswallowed up those glittering myriads of men.\n\nHe felt invisible forms about him; his arms were gripped. Something\nrapped sharply against his shin. A voice bawled in his ear, \"It is all\nright--all right.\"\n\nGraham shook off the paralysis of his first astonishment. He struck his\nforehead against Lincoln's and bawled, \"What is this darkness?\"\n\n\"The Council has cut the currents that light the city. We must\nwait--stop. The people will go on. They will--\"\n\nHis voice was drowned. Voices were shouting, \"Save the Sleeper. Take care\nof the Sleeper.\" A guard stumbled against Graham and hurt his hand by an\ninadvertent blow of his weapon. A wild tumult tossed and whirled about\nhim, growing, as it seemed, louder, denser, more furious each moment.\nFragments of recognisable sounds drove towards him, were whirled away\nfrom him as his mind reached out to grasp them. Voices seemed to be\nshouting conflicting orders, other voices answered. There were suddenly a\nsuccession of piercing screams close beneath them.\n\nA voice bawled in his ear, \"The red police,\" and receded forthwith beyond\nhis questions.\n\nA crackling sound grew to distinctness, and therewith a leaping of faint\nflashes along the edge of the further ways. By their light Graham saw the\nheads and bodies of a number of men, armed with weapons like those of his\nguards, leap into an instant's dim visibility. The whole area began to\ncrackle, to flash with little instantaneous streaks of light, and\nabruptly the darkness rolled back like a curtain.\n\nA glare of light dazzled his eyes, a vast seething expanse of struggling\nmen confused his mind. A shout, a burst of cheering, came across the\nways. He looked up to see the source of the light. A man hung far\noverhead from the upper part of a cable, holding by a rope the blinding\nstar that had driven the darkness back.\n\nGraham's eyes fell to the ways again. A wedge of red a little way\nalong the vista caught his eye. He saw it was a dense mass of red-clad\nmen jammed on the higher further way, their backs against the pitiless\ncliff of building, and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists.\nThey were fighting. Weapons flashed and rose and fell, heads vanished\nat the edge of the contest, and other heads replaced them, the little\nflashes from the green weapons became little jets of smoky grey while\nthe light lasted.\n\nAbruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways were an inky darkness\nonce more, a tumultuous mystery.\n\nHe felt something thrusting against him. He was being pushed along the\ngallery. Someone was shouting--it might be at him. He was too confused\nto hear. He was thrust against the wall, and a number of people\nblundered past him. It seemed to him that his guards were struggling\nwith one another.\n\nSuddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again, and the whole scene\nwas white and dazzling. The band of red-coats seemed broader and nearer;\nits apex was half-way down the ways towards the central aisle. And\nraising his eyes Graham saw that a number of these men had also appeared\nnow in the darkened lower galleries of the opposite building, and were\nfiring over the heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of\npeople on the lower ways. The meaning of these things dawned upon him.\nThe march of the people had come upon an ambush at the very outset.\nThrown into confusion by the extinction of the lights they were now being\nattacked by the red police. Then he became aware that he was standing\nalone, that his guards and Lincoln were along the gallery in the\ndirection along which he had come before the darkness fell. He saw they\nwere gesticulating to him wildly, running back towards him. A great\nshouting came from across the ways. Then it seemed as though the whole\nface of the darkened building opposite was lined and speckled with\nred-clad men. And they were pointing over to him and shouting. \"The\nSleeper! Save the Sleeper!\" shouted a multitude of throats.\n\nSomething struck the wall above his head. He looked up at the impact and\nsaw a star-shaped splash of silvery metal. He saw Lincoln near him. Felt\nhis arm gripped. Then, pat, pat; he had been missed twice.\n\nFor a moment he did not understand this. The street was hidden,\neverything was hidden, as he looked. The second flare had burned out.\n\nLincoln had gripped Graham by the arm, was lugging him along the gallery.\n\"Before the next light!\" he cried. His haste was contagious. Graham's\ninstinct of self-preservation overcame the paralysis of his incredulous\nastonishment. He became for a time the blind creature of the fear of\ndeath. He ran, stumbling because of the uncertainty of the darkness,\nblundered into his guards as they turned to run with him. Haste was his\none desire, to escape this perilous gallery upon which he was exposed. A\nthird glare came close on its predecessors. With it came a great shouting\nacross the ways, an answering tumult from the ways. The red-coats below,\nhe saw, had now almost gained the central passage. Their countless faces\nturned towards him, and they shouted. The white fa\u00e7ade opposite was\ndensely stippled with red. All these wonderful things concerned him,\nturned upon him as a pivot. These were the guards of the Council\nattempting to recapture him.\n\nLucky it was for him that these shots were the first fired in anger for\na hundred and fifty years. He heard bullets whacking over his head, felt\na splash of molten metal sting his ear, and perceived without looking\nthat the whole opposite fa\u00e7ade, an unmasked ambuscade of red police, was\ncrowded and bawling and firing at him.\n\nDown went one of his guards before him, and Graham, unable to stop, leapt\nthe writhing body.\n\nIn another second he had plunged, unhurt, into a black passage, and\nincontinently someone, coming, it may be, in a transverse direction,\nblundered violently into him. He was hurling down a staircase in absolute\ndarkness. He reeled, and was struck again, and came against a wall with\nhis hands. He was crushed by a weight of struggling bodies, whirled\nround, and thrust to the right. A vast pressure pinned him. He could not\nbreathe, his ribs seemed cracking. He felt a momentary relaxation, and\nthen the whole mass of people moving together, bore him back towards the\ngreat theatre from which he had so recently come. There were moments when\nhis feet did not touch the ground. Then he was staggering and shoving. He\nheard shouts of \"They are coming!\" and a muffled cry close to him. His\nfoot blundered against something soft, he heard a hoarse scream under\nfoot. He heard shouts of \"The Sleeper!\" but he was too confused to speak.\nHe heard the green weapons crackling. For a space he lost his individual\nwill, became an atom in a panic, blind, unthinking, mechanical. He thrust\nand pressed back and writhed in the pressure, kicked presently against a\nstep, and found himself ascending a slope. And abruptly the faces all\nabout him leapt out of the black, visible, ghastly-white and astonished,\nterrified, perspiring, in a livid glare. One face, a young man's, was\nvery near to him, not twenty inches away. At the time it was but a\npassing incident of no emotional value, but afterwards it came back to\nhim in his dreams. For this young man, wedged upright in the crowd for a\ntime, had been shot and was already dead.\n\nA fourth white star must have been lit by the man on the cable. Its\nlight came glaring in through vast windows and arches and showed Graham\nthat he was now one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back\nacross the lower area of the great theatre. This time the picture was\nlivid and fragmentary, slashed and barred with black shadows. He saw\nthat quite near to him the red guards were fighting their way through\nthe people. He could not tell whether they saw him. He looked for\nLincoln and his guards. He saw Lincoln near the stage of the theatre\nsurrounded in a crowd of black-badged revolutionaries, lifted up and\nstaring to and fro as if seeking him. Graham perceived that he himself\nwas near the opposite edge of the crowd, that behind him, separated by a\nbarrier, sloped the now vacant seats of the theatre. A sudden idea came\nto him, and he began fighting his way towards the barrier. As he reached\nit the glare came to an end.\n\nIn a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that not only impeded his\nmovements but made him conspicuous, and had slipped it from his\nshoulders. He heard someone trip in its folds. In another he was scaling\nthe barrier and had dropped into the blackness on the further side. Then\nfeeling his way he came to the lower end of an ascending gangway. In the\ndarkness the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices\nlulled. Then suddenly he came to an unexpected step and tripped and fell.\nAs he did so pools and islands amidst the darkness about him leapt to\nvivid light again, the uproar surged louder and the glare of the fifth\nwhite star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre walls.\n\nHe rolled over among some seats, heard a shouting and the whirring rattle\nof weapons, struggled up and was knocked back again, perceived that a\nnumber of black-badged men were all about him firing at the reds below,\nleaping from seat to seat, crouching among the seats to reload.\nInstinctively he crouched amidst the seats, as stray shots ripped the\npneumatic cushions and cut bright slashes on their soft metal frames.\nInstinctively he marked the direction of the gangways, the most plausible\nway of escape for him so soon as the veil of darkness fell again.\n\nA young man in faded blue garments came vaulting over the seats. \"Hullo!\"\nhe said, with his flying feet within six inches of the crouching\nSleeper's face.\n\nHe stared without any sign of recognition, turned to fire, fired, and\nshouting, \"To hell with the Council!\" was about to fire again. Then it\nseemed to Graham that the half of this man's neck had vanished. A drop of\nmoisture fell on Graham's cheek. The green weapon stopped half raised.\nFor a moment the man stood still with his face suddenly expressionless,\nthen he began to slant forward. His knees bent. Man and darkness fell\ntogether. At the sound of his fall Graham rose up and ran for his life\nuntil a step down to the gangway tripped him. He scrambled to his feet,\nturned up the gangway and ran on.\n\nWhen the sixth star glared he was already close to the yawning throat of\na passage. He ran on the swifter for the light, entered the passage and\nturned a corner into absolute night again. He was knocked sideways,\nrolled over, and recovered his feet. He found himself one of a crowd of\ninvisible fugitives pressing in one direction. His one thought now was\ntheir thought also; to escape out of this fighting. He thrust and struck,\nstaggered, ran, was wedged tightly, lost ground and then was clear again.\n\nFor some minutes he was running through the darkness along a winding\npassage, and then he crossed some wide and open space, passed down a long\nincline, and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place. Many\npeople were shouting, \"They are coming! The guards are coming. They are\nfiring. Get out of the fighting. The guards are firing. It will be safe\nin Seventh Way. Along here to Seventh Way!\" There were women and children\nin the crowd as well as men.\n\nThe crowd converged on an archway, passed through a short throat and\nemerged on a wider space again, lit dimly. The black figures about him\nspread out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series\nof steps. He followed. The people dispersed to the right and left.... He\nperceived that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest\nstep. Before him, on that level, were groups of seats and a little kiosk.\nHe went up to this and, stopping in the shadow of its eaves, looked about\nhim panting.\n\nEverything was vague and grey, but he recognised that these great steps\nwere a series of platforms of the \"ways,\" now motionless again. The\nplatform slanted up on either side, and the tall buildings rose beyond,\nvast dim ghosts, their inscriptions and advertisements indistinctly seen,\nand up through the girders and cables was a faint interrupted ribbon of\npallid sky. A number of people hurried by. From their shouts and voices,\nit seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting. Other less noisy\nfigures flitted timidly among the shadows.\n\nFrom very far away down the street he could hear the sound of a struggle.\nBut it was evident to him that this was not the street into which the\ntheatre opened. That former fight, it seemed, had suddenly dropped out of\nsound and hearing. And they were fighting for him!\n\nFor a space he was like a man who pauses in the reading of a vivid book,\nand suddenly doubts what he has been taking unquestionably. At that time\nhe had little mind for details; the whole effect was a huge astonishment.\nOddly enough, while the flight from the Council prison, the great crowd\nin the hall, and the attack of the red police upon the swarming people\nwere clearly present in his mind, it cost him an effort to piece in his\nawakening and to revive the meditative interval of the Silent Rooms. At\nfirst his memory leapt these things and took him back to the cascade at\nPentargen quivering in the wind, and all the sombre splendours of the\nsunlit Cornish coast. The contrast touched everything with unreality. And\nthen the gap filled, and he began to comprehend his position.\n\nIt was no longer absolutely a riddle, as it had been in the Silent Rooms.\nAt least he had the strange, bare outline now. He was in some way the\nowner of the world, and great political parties were fighting to possess\nhim. On the one hand was the Council, with its red police, set\nresolutely, it seemed, on the usurpation of his property and perhaps his\nmurder; on the other, the revolution that had liberated him, with this\nunseen \"Ostrog\" as its leader. And the whole of this gigantic city was\nconvulsed by their struggle. Frantic development of his world! \"I do not\nunderstand,\" he cried. \"I do not understand!\"\n\nHe had slipped out between the contending parties into this liberty of\nthe twilight. What would happen next? What was happening? He figured the\nred-clad men as busily hunting him, driving the black-badged\nrevolutionists before them.\n\nAt any rate chance had given him a breathing space. He could lurk\nunchallenged by the passers-by, and watch the course of things. His eye\nfollowed up the intricate dim immensity of the twilight buildings, and it\ncame to him as a thing infinitely wonderful, that above there the sun was\nrising, and the world was lit and glowing with the old familiar light of\nday. In a little while he had recovered his breath. His clothing had\nalready dried upon him from the snow.\n\nHe wandered for miles along these twilight ways, speaking to no one,\naccosted by no one--a dark figure among dark figures--the coveted man out\nof the past, the inestimable unintentional owner of the world. Wherever\nthere were lights or dense crowds, or exceptional excitement, he was\nafraid of recognition, and watched and turned back or went up and down by\nthe middle stairways, into some transverse system of ways at a lower or\nhigher level. And though he came on no more fighting, the whole city\nstirred with battle. Once he had to run to avoid a marching multitude of\nmen that swept the street. Everyone abroad seemed involved. For the most\npart they were men, and they carried what he judged were weapons. It\nseemed as though the struggle was concentrated mainly in the quarter of\nthe city from which he came. Ever and again a distant roaring, the\nremote suggestion of that conflict, reached his ears. Then his caution\nand his curiosity struggled together. But his caution prevailed, and he\ncontinued wandering away from the fighting--so far as he could judge. He\nwent unmolested, unsuspected through the dark. After a time he ceased to\nhear even a remote echo of the battle, fewer and fewer people passed him,\nuntil at last the streets became deserted. The frontages of the buildings\ngrew plain, and harsh; he seemed to have come to a district of vacant\nwarehouses. Solitude crept upon him--his pace slackened.\n\nHe became aware of a growing fatigue. At times he would turn aside and\nsit down on one of the numerous benches of the upper ways. But a feverish\nrestlessness, the knowledge of his vital implication in this struggle,\nwould not let him rest in any place for long. Was the struggle on his\nbehalf alone?\n\nAnd then in a desolate place came the shock of an earthquake--a roaring\nand thundering--a mighty wind of cold air pouring through the city, the\nsmash of glass, the slip and thud of falling masonry--a series of\ngigantic concussions. A mass of glass and ironwork fell from the remote\nroofs into the middle gallery, not a hundred yards away from him, and in\nthe distance were shouts and running. He, too, was startled to an aimless\nactivity, and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back.\n\nA man came running towards him. His self-control returned. \"What have\nthey blown up?\" asked the man breathlessly. \"That was an explosion,\" and\nbefore Graham could speak he had hurried on.\n\nThe great buildings rose dimly, veiled by a perplexing twilight, albeit\nthe rivulet of sky above was now bright with day. He noted many strange\nfeatures, understanding none at the time; he even spelt out many of the\ninscriptions in Phonetic lettering. But what profit is it to decipher a\nconfusion of odd-looking letters resolving itself, after painful strain\nof eye and mind, into \"Here is Eadhamite,\" or, \"Labour Bureau--Little\nSide\"? Grotesque thought, that all these cliff-like houses were his!\n\nThe perversity of his experience came to him vividly. In actual fact he\nhad made such a leap in time as romancers have imagined again and again.\nAnd that fact realised, he had been prepared. His mind had, as it were,\nseated itself for a spectacle. And no spectacle unfolded itself, but a\ngreat vague danger, unsympathetic shadows and veils of darkness.\nSomewhere through the labyrinthine obscurity his death sought him. Would\nhe, after all, be killed before he saw? It might be that even at the next\ncorner his destruction ambushed. A great desire to see, a great longing\nto know, arose in him.\n\nHe became fearful of corners. It seemed to him that there was safety in\nconcealment. Where could he hide to be inconspicuous when the lights\nreturned? At last he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the\nhigher ways, conceiving he was alone there.\n\nHe squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes. Suppose when he looked\nagain he found the dark trough of parallel ways and that intolerable\naltitude of edifice gone. Suppose he were to discover the whole story of\nthese last few days, the awakening, the shouting multitudes, the darkness\nand the fighting, a phantasmagoria, a new and more vivid sort of dream.\nIt must be a dream; it was so inconsecutive, so reasonless. Why were the\npeople fighting for him? Why should this saner world regard him as Owner\nand Master?\n\nSo he thought, sitting blinded, and then he looked again, half hoping in\nspite of his ears to see some familiar aspect of the life of the\nnineteenth century, to see, perhaps, the little harbour of Boscastle\nabout him, the cliffs of Pentargen, or the bedroom of his home. But fact\ntakes no heed of human hopes. A squad of men with a black banner tramped\nathwart the nearer shadows, intent on conflict, and beyond rose that\ngiddy wall of frontage, vast and dark, with the dim incomprehensible\nlettering showing faintly on its face.\n\n\"It is no dream,\" he said, \"no dream.\" And he bowed his face upon\nhis hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE OLD MAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING\n\n\nHe was startled by a cough close at hand.\n\nHe turned sharply, and peering, saw a small, hunched-up figure sitting a\ncouple of yards off in the shadow of the enclosure.\n\n\"Have ye any news?\" asked the high-pitched wheezy voice of a very old\nman.\n\nGraham hesitated. \"None,\" he said.\n\n\"I stay here till the lights come again,\" said the old man. \"These blue\nscoundrels are everywhere--everywhere.\"\n\nGraham's answer was inarticulate assent. He tried to see the old man but\nthe darkness hid his face. He wanted very much to respond, to talk, but\nhe did not know how to begin.\n\n\"Dark and damnable,\" said the old man suddenly. \"Dark and damnable.\nTurned out of my room among all these dangers.\"\n\n\"That's hard,\" ventured Graham. \"That's hard on you.\"\n\n\"Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And all the world gone mad.\nWar and fighting. The police beaten and rogues abroad. Why don't they\nbring some negroes to protect us? ... No more dark passages for me. I\nfell over a dead man.\"\n\n\"You're safer with company,\" said the old man, \"if it's company of\nthe right sort,\" and peered frankly. He rose suddenly and came\ntowards Graham.\n\nApparently the scrutiny was satisfactory. The old man sat down as if\nrelieved to be no longer alone. \"Eh!\" he said, \"but this is a terrible\ntime! War and fighting, and the dead lying there--men, strong men, dying\nin the dark. Sons! I have three sons. God knows where they are to-night.\"\n\nThe voice ceased. Then repeated quavering: \"God knows where they are\nto-night.\"\n\nGraham stood revolving a question that should not betray his ignorance.\nAgain the old man's voice ended the pause.\n\n\"This Ostrog will win,\" he said. \"He will win. And what the world will\nbe like under him no one can tell. My sons are under the wind-vanes,\nall three. One of my daughters-in-law was his mistress for a while.\nHis mistress! We're not common people. Though they've sent me to\nwander to-night and take my chance.... I knew what was going on.\nBefore most people. But this darkness! And to fall over a dead body\nsuddenly in the dark!\"\n\nHis wheezy breathing could be heard.\n\n\"Ostrog!\" said Graham.\n\n\"The greatest Boss the world has ever seen,\" said the voice.\n\nGraham ransacked his mind. \"The Council has few friends among the\npeople,\" he hazarded.\n\n\"Few friends. And poor ones at that. They've had their time. Eh! They\nshould have kept to the clever ones. But twice they held election. And\nOstrog--. And now it has burst out and nothing can stay it, nothing can\nstay it. Twice they rejected Ostrog--Ostrog the Boss. I heard of his\nrages at the time--he was terrible. Heaven save them! For nothing on\nearth can now he has raised the Labour Companies upon them. No one else\nwould have dared. All the blue canvas armed and marching! He will go\nthrough with it. He will go through.\"\n\nHe was silent for a little while. \"This Sleeper,\" he said, and stopped.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham. \"Well?\"\n\nThe senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the dim, pale face came\nclose. \"The real Sleeper--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Died years ago.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Graham, sharply.\n\n\"Years ago. Died. Years ago.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" said Graham.\n\n\"I do. I do say so. He died. This Sleeper who's woke up--they changed in\nthe night. A poor, drugged insensible creature. But I mustn't tell all I\nknow. I mustn't tell all I know.\"\n\nFor a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret was too much for\nhim. \"I don't know the ones that put him to sleep--that was before my\ntime--but I know the man who injected the stimulants and woke him again.\nIt was ten to one--wake or kill. Wake or kill. Ostrog's way.\"\n\nGraham was so astonished at these things that he had to interrupt, to\nmake the old man repeat his words, to re-question vaguely, before he was\nsure of the meaning and folly of what he heard. And his awakening had\nnot been natural! Was that an old man's senile superstition, too, or had\nit any truth in it? Feeling in the dark corners of his memory, he\npresently came on something that might conceivably be an impression of\nsome such stimulating effect. It dawned upon him that he had happened\nupon a lucky encounter, that at last he might learn something of the new\nage. The old man wheezed awhile and spat, and then the piping,\nreminiscent voice resumed:\n\n\"The first time they rejected him. I've followed it all.\"\n\n\"Rejected whom?\" said Graham. \"The Sleeper?\"\n\n\"Sleeper? _No_. Ostrog. He was terrible--terrible! And he was promised\nthen, promised certainly the next time. Fools they were--not to be more\nafraid of him. Now all the city's his millstone, and such as we dust\nground upon it. Dust ground upon it. Until he set to work--the workers\ncut each other's throats, and murdered a Chinaman or a Labour policeman\nat times, and left the rest of us in peace. Dead bodies! Robbing!\nDarkness! Such a thing hasn't been this gross of years. Eh!--but 'tis ill\non small folks when the great fall out! It's ill.\"\n\n\"Did you say--there had not been--what?--for a gross of years?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said the old man.\n\nThe old man said something about clipping his words, and made him repeat\nthis a third time. \"Fighting and slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools\nbawling freedom and the like,\" said the old man. \"Not in all my life has\nthere been that. These are like the old days--for sure--when the Paris\npeople broke out--three gross of years ago. That's what I mean hasn't\nbeen. But it's the world's way. It had to come back. I know. I know. This\nfive years Ostrog has been working, and there has been trouble and\ntrouble, and hunger and threats and high talk and arms. Blue canvas and\nmurmurs. No one safe. Everything sliding and slipping. And now here we\nare! Revolt and fighting, and the Council come to its end.\"\n\n\"You are rather well-informed on these things,\" said Graham.\n\n\"I know what I hear. It isn't all Babble Machine with me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham, wondering what Babble Machine might be. \"And you are\ncertain this Ostrog--you are certain Ostrog organised this rebellion and\narranged for the waking of the Sleeper? Just to assert himself--because\nhe was not elected to the Council?\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that, I should think,\" said the old man. \"Except--just\nfools. He meant to be master somehow. In the Council or not. Everyone who\nknows anything knows that. And here we are with dead bodies lying in the\ndark! Why, where have you been if you haven't heard all about the trouble\nbetween Ostrog and the Verneys? And what do you think the troubles are\nabout? The Sleeper? Eh? You think the Sleeper's real and woke of his own\naccord--eh?\"\n\n\"I'm a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful,\" said Graham. \"Lots of\nthings that have happened--especially of late years--. If I was the\nSleeper, to tell you the truth, I couldn't know less about them.\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the voice. \"Old, are you? You don't sound so very old! But\nit's not everyone keeps his memory to my time of life--truly. But these\nnotorious things! But you're not so old as me--not nearly so old as me.\nWell! I ought not to judge other men by myself, perhaps. I'm young--for\nso old a man. Maybe you're old for so young.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Graham. \"And I've a queer history. I know very little.\nAnd history! Practically I know no history. The Sleeper and Julius\nCaesar are all the same to me. It's interesting to hear you talk of\nthese things.\"\n\n\"I know a few things,\" said the old man. \"I know a thing or two.\nBut--. Hark!\"\n\nThe two men became silent, listening. There was a heavy thud, a\nconcussion that made their seat shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted\nto one another. The old man was full of questions; he shouted to a man\nwho passed near. Graham, emboldened by his example, got up and accosted\nothers. None knew what had happened.\n\nHe returned to the seat and found the old man muttering vague\ninterrogations in an undertone. For a while they said nothing to\none another.\n\nThe sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet so remote, oppressed\nGraham's imagination. Was this old man right, was the report of the\npeople right, and were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they all in\nerror, and were the red guards driving all before them? At any time the\nflood of warfare might pour into this silent quarter of the city and\nseize upon him again. It behoved him to learn all he could while there\nwas time. He turned suddenly to the old man with a question and left it\nunsaid. But his motion moved the old man to speech again.\n\n\"Eh! but how things work together!\" said the old man. \"This Sleeper that\nall the fools put their trust in! I've the whole history of it--I was\nalways a good one for histories. When I was a boy--I'm that old--I used\nto read printed books. You'd hardly think it. Likely you've seen\nnone--they rot and dust so--and the Sanitary Company burns them to make\nashlarite. But they were convenient in their dirty way. One learnt a\nlot. These new-fangled Babble Machines--they don't seem new-fangled to\nyou, eh?--they're easy to hear, easy to forget. But I've traced all the\nSleeper business from the first.\"\n\n\"You will scarcely believe it,\" said Graham slowly, \"I'm so\nignorant--I've been so preoccupied in my own little affairs, my\ncircumstances have been so odd--I know nothing of this Sleeper's history.\nWho was he?\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the old man. \"I know, I know. He was a poor nobody, and set\non a playful woman, poor soul! And he fell into a trance. There's the\nold things they had, those brown things--silver photographs--still\nshowing him as he lay, a gross and a half years ago--a gross and a half\nof years.\"\n\n\"Set on a playful woman, poor soul,\" said Graham softly to himself, and\nthen aloud, \"Yes--well go on.\"\n\n\"You must know he had a cousin named Warming, a solitary man without\nchildren, who made a big fortune speculating in roads--the first\nEadhamite roads. But surely you've heard? No? Why? He bought all the\npatent rights and made a big company. In those days there were grosses of\ngrosses of separate businesses and business companies. Grosses of\ngrosses! His roads killed the railroads--the old things--in two dozen\nyears; he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And because he didn't want\nto break up his great property or let in shareholders, he left it all to\nthe Sleeper, and put it under a Board of Trustees that he had picked and\ntrained. He knew then the Sleeper wouldn't wake, that he would go on\nsleeping, sleeping till he died. He knew that quite well! And plump! a\nman in the United States, who had lost two sons in a boat accident,\nfollowed that up with another great bequest. His trustees found\nthemselves with a dozen myriads of lions'-worth or more of property at\nthe very beginning.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Graham.\"\n\n\"No--I mean--that American's.\"\n\n\"Isbister.\"\n\n\"Isbister!\" cried Graham. \"Why, I don't even know the name.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the old man. \"Of course not. People don't learn\nmuch in the schools nowadays. But I know all about him. He was a rich\nAmerican who went from England, and he left the Sleeper even more than\nWarming. How he made it? That I don't know. Something about pictures by\nmachinery. But he made it and left it, and so the Council had its start.\nIt was just a council of trustees at first.\"\n\n\"And how did it grow?\"\n\n\"Eh!--but you're not up to things. Money attracts money--and twelve\nbrains are better than one. They played it cleverly. They worked politics\nwith money, and kept on adding to the money by working currency and\ntariffs. They grew--they grew. And for years the twelve trustees hid the\ngrowing of the Sleeper's estate under double names and company titles and\nall that. The Council spread by title deed, mortgage, share, every\npolitical party, every newspaper they bought. If you listen to the old\nstories you will see the Council growing and growing. Billions and\nbillions of lions at last--the Sleeper's estate. And all growing out of a\nwhim--out of this Warming's will, and an accident to Isbister's sons.\n\n\"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"The strange thing to me is how the\nCouncil worked together so long. As many as twelve. But they worked in\ncliques from the first. And they've slipped back. In my young days\nspeaking of the Council was like an ignorant man speaking of God. We\ndidn't think they could do wrong. We didn't know of their women and all\nthat! Or else I've got wiser.\n\n\"Men are strange,\" said the old man. \"Here are you, young and\nignorant, and me--sevendy years old, and I might reasonably before\ngetting--explaining it all to you short and clear.\n\n\"Sevendy,\" he said, \"sevendy, and I hear and see--hear better than I\nsee. And reason clearly, and keep myself up to all the happenings of\nthings. Sevendy!\n\n\"Life is strange. I was twaindy before Ostrog was a baby. I remember him\nlong before he'd pushed his way to the head of the Wind Vanes Control.\nI've seen many changes. Eh! I've worn the blue. And at last I've come to\nsee this crush and darkness and tumult and dead men carried by in heaps\non the ways. And all his doing! All his doing!\"\n\nHis voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of Ostrog.\n\nGraham thought. \"Let me see,\" he said, \"if I have it right.\"\n\nHe extended a hand and ticked off points upon his fingers. \"The Sleeper\nhas been asleep--\"\n\n\"Changed,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Perhaps. And meanwhile the Sleeper's property grew in the hands of\nTwelve Trustees, until it swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of\nthe world. The Twelve Trustees--by virtue of this property have become\nmasters of the world. Because they are the paying power--just as the old\nEnglish Parliament used to be--\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said the old man. \"That's so--that's a good comparison.\nYou're not so--\"\n\n\"And now this Ostrog--has suddenly revolutionised the world by waking the\nSleeper--whom no one but the superstitious, common people had ever dreamt\nwould wake again--raising the Sleeper to claim his property from the\nCouncil, after all these years.\"\n\nThe old man endorsed this statement with a cough. \"It's strange,\" he\nsaid, \"to meet a man who learns these things for the first time\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Graham, \"it's strange.\"\n\n\"Have you been in a Pleasure City?\" said the old man. \"All my life I've\nlonged--\" He laughed. \"Even now,\" he said, \"I could enjoy a little fun.\nEnjoy seeing things, anyhow.\" He mumbled a sentence Graham did not\nunderstand.\n\n\"The Sleeper--when did he awake?\" said Graham suddenly.\n\n\"Three days ago.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Ostrog has him. He escaped from the Council not four hours ago. My\ndear sir, where were you at the time? He was in the hall of the\nmarkets--where the fighting has been. All the city was screaming about\nit. All the Babble Machines. Everywhere it was shouted. Even the fools\nwho speak for the Council were admitting it. Everyone was rushing off to\nsee him--everyone was getting arms. Were you drunk or asleep? And even\nthen! But you're joking! Surely you're pretending. It was to stop the\nshouting of the Babble Machines and prevent the people gathering that\nthey turned off the electricity--and put this damned darkness upon us.\nDo you mean to say--?\"\n\n\"I had heard the Sleeper was rescued,\" said Graham. \"But--to come back a\nminute. Are you sure Ostrog has him?\"\n\n\"He won't let him go,\" said the old man.\n\n\"And the Sleeper. Are you sure he is not genuine? I have never heard--\"\n\n\"So all the fools think. So they think. As if there wasn't a thousand\nthings that were never heard. I know Ostrog too well for that. Did I tell\nyou? In a way I'm a sort of relation of Ostrog's. A sort of relation.\nThrough my daughter-in-law.\"\n\n\"I suppose--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I suppose there's no chance of this Sleeper asserting himself. I suppose\nhe's certain to be a puppet--in Ostrog's hands or the Council's, as soon\nas the struggle is over.\"\n\n\"In Ostrog's hands--certainly. Why shouldn't he be a puppet? Look at his\nposition. Everything done for him, every pleasure possible. Why should he\nwant to assert himself?\"\n\n\"What are these Pleasure Cities?\" said Graham, abruptly.\n\nThe old man made him repeat the question. When at last he was assured of\nGraham's words, he nudged him violently. \"That's _too_ much,\" said he.\n\"You're poking fun at an old man. I've been suspecting you know more than\nyou pretend.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do,\" said Graham. \"But no! why should I go on acting? No, I do\nnot know what a Pleasure City is.\"\n\nThe old man laughed in an intimate way.\n\n\"What is more, I do not know how to read your letters, I do not know\nwhat money you use, I do not know what foreign countries there are. I do\nnot know where I am. I cannot count. I do not know where to get food, nor\ndrink, nor shelter.\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the old man, \"if you had a glass of drink now, would\nyou put it in your ear or your eye?\"\n\n\"I want you to tell me all these things.\"\n\n\"He, he! Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun.\" A\nwithered hand caressed Graham's arm for a moment. \"Silk. Well, well! But,\nall the same, I wish I was the man who was put up as the Sleeper. He'll\nhave a fine time of it. All the pomp and pleasure. He's a queer looking\nface. When they used to let anyone go to see him, I've got tickets and\nbeen. The image of the real one, as the photographs show him, this\nsubstitute used to be. Yellow. But he'll get fed up. It's a queer world.\nThink of the luck of it. The luck of it. I expect he'll be sent to Capri.\nIt's the best fun for a greener.\"\n\nHis cough overtook him again. Then he began mumbling enviously of\npleasures and strange delights. \"The luck of it, the luck of it! All my\nlife I've been in London, hoping to get my chance.\"\n\n\"But you don't know that the Sleeper died,\" said Graham, suddenly.\n\nThe old man made him repeat his words.\n\n\"Men don't live beyond ten dozen. It's not in the order of things,\" said\nthe old man. \"I'm not a fool. Fools may believe it, but not me.\"\n\nGraham became angry with the old man's assurance. \"Whether you are a fool\nor not,\" he said, \"it happens you are wrong about the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"You are wrong about the Sleeper. I haven't told you before, but I will\ntell you now. You are wrong about the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"How do you know? I thought you didn't know anything--not even about\nPleasure Cities.\"\n\nGraham paused.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said the old man. \"How are you to know? It's very\nfew men--\"\n\n\"I _am_ the Sleeper.\"\n\nHe had to repeat it.\n\nThere was a brief pause. \"There's a silly thing to say, sir, if you'll\nexcuse me. It might get you into trouble in a time like this,\" said\nthe old man.\n\nGraham, slightly dashed, repeated his assertion.\n\n\"I was saying I was the Sleeper. That years and years ago I did, indeed,\nfall asleep, in a little stone-built village, in the days when there were\nhedgerows, and villages, and inns, and all the countryside cut up into\nlittle pieces, little fields. Have you never heard of those days? And it\nis I--I who speak to you--who awakened again these four days since.\"\n\n\"Four days since!--the Sleeper! But they've _got_ the Sleeper. They have\nhim and they won't let him go. Nonsense! You've been talking sensibly\nenough up to now. I can see it as though I was there. There will be\nLincoln like a keeper just behind him; they won't let him go about alone.\nTrust them. You're a queer fellow. One of these fun pokers. I see now why\nyou have been clipping your words so oddly, but--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and Graham could see his gesture.\n\n\"As if Ostrog would let the Sleeper run about alone! No, you're telling\nthat to the wrong man altogether. Eh! as if I should believe. What's\nyour game? And besides, we've been talking of the Sleeper.\"\n\nGraham stood up. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I am the Sleeper.\"\n\n\"You're an odd man,\" said the old man, \"to sit here in the dark, talking\nclipped, and telling a lie of that sort. But--\"\n\nGraham's exasperation fell to laughter. \"It is preposterous,\" he cried.\n\"Preposterous. The dream must end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am\nI--in this damned twilight--I never knew a dream in twilight before--an\nanachronism by two hundred years and trying to persuade an old fool that\nI am myself, and meanwhile--Ugh!\"\n\nHe moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In a moment the old man\nwas pursuing him. \"Eh! but don't go!\" cried the old man. \"I'm an old\nfool, I know. Don't go. Don't leave me in all this darkness.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of telling his secret\nflashed into his mind.\n\n\"I didn't mean to offend you--disbelieving you,\" said the old man coming\nnear. \"It's no manner of harm. Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases\nyou. 'Tis a foolish trick--\"\n\nGraham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his way.\n\nFor a time he heard the old man's hobbling pursuit and his wheezy\ncries receding. But at last the darkness swallowed him, and Graham saw\nhim no more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nOSTROG\n\n\nGraham could now take a clearer view of his position. For a long time yet\nhe wandered, but after the talk of the old man his discovery of this\nOstrog was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision. One thing\nwas evident, those who were at the headquarters of the revolt had\nsucceeded very admirably in suppressing the fact of his disappearance.\nBut every moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of his\nrecapture by the Council.\n\nPresently a man stopped before him. \"Have you heard?\" he said.\n\n\"No!\" said Graham, starting.\n\n\"Near a dozand,\" said the man, \"a dozand men!\" and hurried on.\n\nA number of men and a girl passed in the darkness, gesticulating and\nshouting: \"Capitulated! Given up!\" \"A dozand of men.\" \"Two dozand of\nmen.\" \"Ostrog, Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!\" These cries receded, became\nindistinct.\n\nOther shouting men followed. For a time his attention was absorbed in the\nfragments of speech he heard. He had a doubt whether all were speaking\nEnglish. Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English, like \"nigger\"\ndialect, blurred and mangled distortions. He dared accost no one with\nquestions. The impression the people gave him jarred altogether with his\npreconceptions of the struggle and confirmed the old man's faith in\nOstrog. It was only slowly he could bring himself to believe that all\nthese people were rejoicing at the defeat of the Council, that the\nCouncil which had pursued him with such power and vigour was after all\nthe weaker of the two sides in conflict. And if that was so, how did it\naffect him? Several times he hesitated on the verge of fundamental\nquestions. Once he turned and walked for a long way after a little man of\nrotund inviting outline, but he was unable to master confidence to\naddress him.\n\nIt was only slowly that it came to him that he might ask for the\n\"wind-vane offices\" whatever the \"wind-vane offices\" might be. His first\nenquiry simply resulted in a direction to go on towards Westminster. His\nsecond led to the discovery of a short cut in which he was speedily lost.\nHe was told to leave the ways to which he had hitherto confined\nhimself--knowing no other means of transit--and to plunge down one of the\nmiddle staircases into the blackness of a cross-way. Thereupon came some\ntrivial adventures; chief of these an ambiguous encounter with a\ngruff-voiced invisible creature speaking in a strange dialect that seemed\nat first a strange tongue, a thick flow of speech with the drifting\ncorpses of English Words therein, the dialect of the latter-day vile.\nThen another voice drew near, a girl's voice singing, \"tralala tralala.\"\nShe spoke to Graham, her English touched with something of the same\nquality. She professed to have lost her sister, she blundered needlessly\ninto him he thought, caught hold of him and laughed. But a word of vague\nremonstrance sent her into the unseen again.\n\nThe sounds about him increased. Stumbling people passed him, speaking\nexcitedly. \"They have surrendered!\" \"The Council! Surely not the\nCouncil!\" \"They are saying so in the Ways.\" The passage seemed wider.\nSuddenly the wall fell away. He was in a great space and people were\nstirring remotely. He inquired his way of an indistinct figure. \"Strike\nstraight across,\" said a woman's voice. He left his guiding wall, and in\na moment had stumbled against a little table on which were utensils of\nglass. Graham's eyes, now attuned to darkness, made out a long vista with\ntables on either side. He went down this. At one or two of the tables he\nheard a clang of glass and a sound of eating. There were people then cool\nenough to dine, or daring enough to steal a meal in spite of social\nconvulsion and darkness. Far off and high up he presently saw a pallid\nlight of a semi-circular shape. As he approached this, a black edge came\nup and hid it. He stumbled at steps and found himself in a gallery. He\nheard a sobbing, and found two scared little girls crouched by a railing.\nThese children became silent at the near sound of feet. He tried to\nconsole them, but they were very still until he left them. Then as he\nreceded he could hear them sobbing again.\n\nPresently he found himself at the foot of a staircase and near a wide\nopening. He saw a dim twilight above this and ascended out of the\nblackness into a street of moving ways again. Along this a disorderly\nswarm of people marched shouting. They were singing snatches of the song\nof the revolt, most of them out of tune. Here and there torches flared\ncreating brief hysterical shadows. He asked his way and was twice puzzled\nby that same thick dialect. His third attempt won an answer he could\nunderstand. He was two miles from the wind-vane offices in Westminster,\nbut the way was easy to follow.\n\nWhen at last he did approach the district of the wind-vane offices it\nseemed to him, from the cheering processions that came marching along the\nWays, from the tumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration of\nthe lighting of the city, that the overthrow of the Council must already\nbe accomplished. And still no news of his absence came to his ears.\n\nThe re-illumination of the city came with startling abruptness. Suddenly\nhe stood blinking, all about him men halted dazzled, and the world was\nincandescent. The light found him already upon the outskirts of the\nexcited crowds that choked the ways near the wind-vane offices, and the\nsense of visibility and exposure that came with it turned his colourless\nintention of joining Ostrog to a keen anxiety.\n\nFor a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endangered by men hoarse and\nweary with cheering his name, some of them bandaged and bloody in his\ncause. The frontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by some\nmoving picture, but what it was he could not see, because in spite of his\nstrenuous attempts the density of the crowd prevented his approaching it.\nFrom the fragments of speech he caught, he judged it conveyed news of the\nfighting about the Council House. Ignorance and indecision made him slow\nand ineffective in his movements. For a time he could not conceive how he\nwas to get within the unbroken fa\u00e7ade of this place. He made his way\nslowly into the midst of this mass of people, until he realised that the\ndescending staircase of the central way led to the interior of the\nbuildings. This gave him a goal, but the crowding in the central path\nwas so dense that it was long before he could reach it. And even then he\nencountered intricate obstruction, and had an hour of vivid argument\nfirst in this guard room and then in that before he could get a note\ntaken to the one man of all men who was most eager to see him. His story\nwas laughed to scorn at one place, and wiser for that, when at last he\nreached a second stairway he professed simply to have news of\nextraordinary importance for Ostrog. What it was he would not say. They\nsent his note reluctantly. For a long time he waited in a little room at\nthe foot of the lift shaft, and thither at last came Lincoln, eager,\napologetic, astonished. He stopped in the doorway scrutinising Graham,\nthen rushed forward effusively.\n\n\"Yes,\" he cried. \"It is you. And you are not dead!\"\n\nGraham made a brief explanation.\n\n\"My brother is waiting,\" explained Lincoln. \"He is alone in the wind-vane\noffices. We feared you had been killed in the theatre. He doubted--and\nthings are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling them\n_there_--or he would have come to you.\"\n\nThey ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage, crossed a great\nhall, empty save for two hurrying messengers, and entered a comparatively\nlittle room, whose only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc\nof cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall. There Lincoln\nleft Graham for a space, and he remained alone without understanding the\nsmoky shapes that drove slowly across this disc.\n\nHis attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly. It was\ncheering, the frantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd, a roaring\nexultation. This ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound heard\nbetween the opening and shutting of a door. In the outer room was a noise\nof hurrying steps and a melodious clinking as if a loose chain was\nrunning over the teeth of a wheel.\n\nThen he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of unseen garments. \"It is\nOstrog!\" he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, and then\neverything was still again.\n\nPresently came voices, footsteps and movement without. The footsteps of\nsome one person detached itself from the other sounds, and drew near,\nfirm, evenly measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall,\nwhite-haired man, clad in garments of cream-coloured silk, appeared,\nregarding Graham from under his raised arm.\n\nFor a moment the white form remained holding the curtain, then dropped it\nand stood before it. Graham's first impression was of a very broad\nforehead, very pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an aquiline\nnose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The folds of flesh over the\neyes, the drooping of the corners of the mouth contradicted the upright\nbearing, and said the man was old. Graham rose to his feet instinctively,\nand for a moment the two men stood in silence, regarding each other.\n\n\"You are Ostrog?\" said Graham.\n\n\"I am Ostrog.\"\n\n\"The Boss?\"\n\n\"So I am called.\"\n\nGraham felt the inconvenience of the silence. \"I have to thank you\nchiefly, I understand, for my safety,\" he said presently.\n\n\"We were afraid you were killed,\" said Ostrog. \"Or sent to sleep\nagain--for ever. We have been doing everything to keep our secret--the\nsecret of your disappearance. Where have you been? How did you get here?\"\n\nGraham told him briefly.\n\nOstrog listened in silence.\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Do you know what I was doing when they came to tell\nme you had come?\"\n\n\"How can I guess?\"\n\n\"Preparing your double.\"\n\n\"My double?\"\n\n\"A man as like you as we could find. We were going to hypnotise him, to\nsave him the difficulty of acting. It was imperative. The whole of this\nrevolt depends on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even\nnow a great multitude of people has gathered in the theatre clamouring to\nsee you. They do not trust.... You know, of course--something of your\nposition?\"\n\n\"Very little,\" said Graham.\n\n\"It is like this.\" Ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned.\n\"You are absolute owner,\" he said, \"of the world. You are King of the\nEarth. Your powers are limited in many intricate ways, but you are the\nfigure-head, the popular symbol of government. This White Council, the\nCouncil of Trustees as it is called--\"\n\n\"I have heard the vague outline of these things.\"\n\n\"I wondered.\"\n\n\"I came upon a garrulous old man.\"\n\n\"I see.... Our masses--the word comes from your days--you know, of\ncourse, that we still have masses--regard you as our actual ruler. Just\nas a great number of people in your days regarded the Crown as the\nruler. They are discontented--the masses all over the earth--with the\nrule of your Trustees. For the most part it is the old discontent, the\nold quarrel of the common man with his commonness--the misery of work and\ndiscipline and unfitness. But your Trustees have ruled ill. In certain\nmatters, in the administration of the Labour Companies, for example, they\nhave been unwise. They have given endless opportunities. Already we of\nthe popular party were agitating for reforms--when your waking came.\nCame! If it had been contrived it could not have come more\nopportunely.\" He smiled. \"The public mind, making no allowance for\nyour years of quiescence, had already hit on the thought of waking you\nand appealing to you, and--Flash!\"\n\nHe indicated the outbreak by a gesture, and Graham moved his head to show\nthat he understood.\n\n\"The Council muddled--quarrelled. They always do. They could not decide\nwhat to do with you. You know how they imprisoned you?\"\n\n\"I see. I see. And now--we win?\"\n\n\"We win. Indeed we win. To-night, in five swift hours. Suddenly we struck\neverywhere. The wind-vane people, the Labour Company and its millions,\nburst the bonds. We got the pull of the aeroplanes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"That was, of course, essential. Or they could have got away. All the\ncity rose, every third man almost was in it! All the blue, all the public\nservices, save only just a few aeronauts and about half the red police.\nYou were rescued, and their own police of the ways--not half of them\ncould be massed at the Council House--have been broken up, disarmed or\nkilled. All London is ours--now. Only the Council House remains.\n\n\"Half of those who remain to them of the red police were lost in that\nfoolish attempt to recapture you. They lost their heads when they lost\nyou. They flung all they had at the theatre. We cut them off from the\nCouncil House there. Truly to-night has been a night of victory.\nEverywhere your star has blazed. A day ago--the White Council ruled as it\nhas ruled for a gross of years, for a century and a half of years, and\nthen, with only a little whispering, a covert arming here and there,\nsuddenly--So!\"\n\n\"I am very ignorant,\" said Graham. \"I suppose--I do not clearly\nunderstand the conditions of this fighting. If you could explain. Where\nis the Council? Where is the fight?\"\n\nOstrog stepped across the room, something clicked, and suddenly, save for\nan oval glow, they were in darkness. For a moment Graham was puzzled.\n\nThen he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken depth and colour, had\nassumed the appearance of an oval window looking out upon a strange\nunfamiliar scene.\n\nAt the first glance he was unable to guess what this scene might be. It\nwas a daylight scene, the daylight of a wintry day, grey and clear.\nAcross the picture, and halfway as it seemed between him and the remoter\nview, a stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically. Then he\nperceived that the rows of great wind-wheels he saw, the wide intervals,\nthe occasional gulfs of darkness, were akin to those through which he had\nfled from the Council House. He distinguished an orderly file of red\nfigures marching across an open space between files of men in black, and\nrealised before Ostrog spoke that he was looking down on the upper\nsurface of latter-day London. The overnight snows had gone. He judged\nthat this mirror was some modern replacement of the camera obscura, but\nthat matter was not explained to him. He saw that though the file of red\nfigures was trotting from left to right, yet they were passing out of the\npicture to the left. He wondered momentarily, and then saw that the\npicture was passing slowly, panorama fashion, across the oval.\n\n\"In a moment you will see the fighting,\" said Ostrog at his elbow. \"Those\nfellows in red you notice are prisoners. This is the roof space of\nLondon--all the houses are practically continuous now. The streets and\npublic squares are covered in. The gaps and chasms of your time have\ndisappeared.\"\n\nSomething out of focus obliterated half the picture. Its form suggested a\nman. There was a gleam of metal, a flash, something that swept across the\noval, as the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye, and the picture was\nclear again. And now Graham beheld men running down among the\nwind-wheels, pointing weapons from which jetted out little smoky flashes.\nThey swarmed thicker and thicker to the right, gesticulating--it might be\nthey were shouting, but of that the picture told nothing. They and the\nwind-wheels passed slowly and steadily across the field of the mirror.\n\n\"Now,\" said Ostrog, \"comes the Council House,\" and slowly a black edge\ncrept into view and gathered Graham's attention. Soon it was no longer an\nedge but a cavity, a huge blackened space amidst the clustering edifices,\nand from it thin spires of smoke rose into the pallid winter sky. Gaunt\nruinous masses of the building, mighty truncated piers and girders, rose\ndismally out of this cavernous darkness. And over these vestiges of some\nsplendid place, countless minute men were clambering, leaping, swarming.\n\n\"This is the Council House,\" said Ostrog. \"Their last stronghold. And the\nfools wasted enough ammunition to hold out for a month in blowing up the\nbuildings all about them--to stop our attack. You heard the smash? It\nshattered half the brittle glass in the city.\"\n\nAnd while he spoke, Graham saw that beyond this area of ruins,\noverhanging it and rising to a great height, was a ragged mass of white\nbuilding. This mass had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of its\nsurroundings. Black gaps marked the passages the disaster had torn apart;\nbig halls had been slashed open and the decoration of their interiors\nshowed dismally in the wintry dawn, and down the jagged walls hung\nfestoons of divided cables and twisted ends of lines and metallic rods.\nAnd amidst all the vast details moved little red specks, the red-clothed\ndefenders of the Council. Every now and then faint flashes illuminated\nthe bleak shadows. At the first sight it seemed to Graham that an attack\nupon this isolated white building was in progress, but then he perceived\nthat the party of the revolt was not advancing, but sheltered amidst the\ncolossal wreckage that encircled this last ragged stronghold of the\nred-garbed men, was keeping up a fitful firing.\n\nAnd not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the ventilating fans in a\nlittle chamber within that remote building wondering what was happening\nin the world!\n\nLooking more attentively as this warlike episode moved silently across\nthe centre of the mirror, Graham saw that the white building was\nsurrounded on every side by ruins, and Ostrog proceeded to describe in\nconcise phrases how its defenders had sought by such destruction to\nisolate themselves from a storm. He spoke of the loss of men that huge\ndownfall had entailed in an indifferent tone. He indicated an improvised\nmortuary among the wreckage, showed ambulances swarming like cheese-mites\nalong a ruinous groove that had once been a street of moving ways. He was\nmore interested in pointing out the parts of the Council House, the\ndistribution of the besiegers. In a little while the civil contest that\nhad convulsed London was no longer a mystery to Graham. It was no\ntumultuous revolt had occurred that night, no equal warfare, but a\nsplendidly organised _coup d'\u00e9tat_. Ostrog's grasp of details was\nastonishing; he seemed to know the business of even the smallest knot of\nblack and red specks that crawled amidst these places.\n\nHe stretched a huge black arm across the luminous picture, and showed the\nroom whence Graham had escaped, and across the chasm of ruins the course\nof his flight. Graham recognised the gulf across which the gutter ran,\nand the wind-wheels where he had crouched from the flying machine. The\nrest of his path had succumbed to the explosion. He looked again at the\nCouncil House, and it was already half hidden, and on the right a\nhillside with a cluster of domes and pinnacles, hazy, dim and distant,\nwas gliding into view.\n\n\"And the Council is really overthrown?\" he said.\n\n\"Overthrown,\" said Ostrog.\n\n\"And I--. Is it indeed true that I--?\"\n\n\"You are Master of the World.\"\n\n\"But that white flag--\"\n\n\"That is the flag of the Council--the flag of the Rule of the World. It\nwill fall. The fight is over. Their attack on the theatre was their last\nfrantic struggle. They have only a thousand men or so, and some of these\nmen will be disloyal. They have little ammunition. And we are reviving\nthe ancient arts. We are casting guns.\"\n\n\"But--help. Is this city the world?\"\n\n\"Practically this is all they have left to them of their empire. Abroad\nthe cities have either revolted with us or wait the issue. Your awakening\nhas perplexed them, paralysed them.\"\n\n\"But haven't the Council flying machines? Why is there no fighting\nwith them?\"\n\n\"They had. But the greater part of the aeronauts were in the revolt with\nus. They wouldn't take the risk of fighting on our side, but they would\nnot stir against us. We _had_ to get a pull with the aeronauts. Quite\nhalf were with us, and the others knew it. Directly they knew you had got\naway, those looking for you dropped. We killed the man who shot at\nyou--an hour ago. And we occupied the flying stages at the outset in\nevery city we could, and so stopped and captured the greater aeroplanes,\nand as for the little flying machines that turned out--for some did--we\nkept up too straight and steady a fire for them to get near the Council\nHouse. If they dropped they couldn't rise again, because there's no clear\nspace about there for them to get up. Several we have smashed, several\nothers have dropped and surrendered, the rest have gone off to the\nContinent to find a friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out.\nMost of these men were only too glad to be taken prisoner and kept out of\nharm's way. Upsetting in a flying machine isn't a very attractive\nprospect. There's no chance for the Council that way. Its days are done.\"\n\nHe laughed and turned to the oval reflection again to show Graham what he\nmeant by flying stages. Even the four nearer ones were remote and\nobscured by a thin morning haze. But Graham could perceive they were very\nvast structures, judged even by the standard of the things about them.\n\nAnd then as these dim shapes passed to the left there came again the\nsight of the expanse across which the disarmed men in red had been\nmarching. And then the black ruins, and then again the beleaguered white\nfastness of the Council. It appeared no longer a ghostly pile, but\nglowing amber in the sunlight, for a cloud shadow had passed. About it\nthe pigmy struggle still hung in suspense, but now the red defenders were\nno longer firing.\n\nSo, in a dusky stillness, the man from the nineteenth century saw the\nclosing scene of the great revolt, the forcible establishment of his\nrule. With a quality of startling discovery it came to him that this was\nhis world, and not that other he had left behind; that this was no\nspectacle to culminate and cease; that in this world lay whatever life\nwas still before him, lay all his duties and dangers and\nresponsibilities. He turned with fresh questions. Ostrog began to answer\nthem, and then broke off abruptly. \"But these things I must explain more\nfully later. At present there are--duties. The people are coming by the\nmoving ways towards this ward from every part of the city--the markets\nand theatres are densely crowded. You are just in time for them. They are\nclamouring to see you. And abroad they want to see you. Paris, New York,\nChicago, Denver, Capri--thousands of cities are up and in a tumult,\nundecided, and clamouring to see you. They have clamoured that you should\nbe awakened for years, and now it is done they will scarcely believe--\"\n\n\"But surely--I can't go ...\"\n\nOstrog answered from the other side of the room, and the picture on the\noval disc paled and vanished as the light jerked back again. \"There are\nkineto-telephoto-graphs,\" he said. \"As you bow to the people here--all\nover the world myriads of myriads of people, packed and still in darkened\nhalls, will see you also. In black and white, of course--not like this.\nAnd you will hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting in the hall.\n\n\"And there is an optical contrivance we shall use,\" said Ostrog, \"used by\nsome of the posturers and women dancers. It may be novel to you. You\nstand in a very bright light, and they see not you but a magnified image\nof you thrown on a screen--so that even the furtherest man in the\nremotest gallery can, if he chooses, count your eyelashes.\"\n\nGraham clutched desperately at one of the questions in his mind. \"What is\nthe population of London?\" he said.\n\n\"Eight and twaindy myriads.\"\n\n\"Eight and what?\"\n\n\"More than thirty-three millions.\"\n\nThese figures went beyond Graham's imagination.\n\n\"You will be expected to say something,\" said Ostrog. \"Not what you used\nto call a Speech, but what our people call a word--just one sentence, six\nor seven words. Something formal. If I might suggest--'I have awakened\nand my heart is with you.' That is the sort of thing they want.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"'I am awakened and my heart is with you.' And bow--bow royally. But\nfirst we must get you black robes--for black is your colour. Do you mind?\nAnd then they will disperse to their homes.\"\n\nGraham hesitated. \"I am in your hands,\" he said.\n\nOstrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought for a moment, turned to\nthe curtain and called brief directions to some unseen attendants. Almost\nimmediately a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe Graham had\nworn in the theatre, was brought. And as he threw it about his shoulders\nthere came from the room without the shrilling of a high-pitched bell.\nOstrog turned in interrogation to the attendant, then suddenly seemed to\nchange his mind, pulled the curtain aside and disappeared.\n\nFor a moment Graham stood with the deferential attendant listening to\nOstrog's retreating steps. There was a sound of quick question and answer\nand of men running. The curtain was snatched back and Ostrog reappeared,\nhis massive face glowing with excitement. He crossed the room in a\nstride, clicked the room into darkness, gripped Graham's arm and pointed\nto the mirror.\n\n\"Even as we turned away,\" he said.\n\nGraham saw his index finger, black and colossal, above the mirrored\nCouncil House. For a moment he did not understand. And then he perceived\nthat the flagstaff that had carried the white banner was bare.\n\n\"Do you mean--?\" he began.\n\n\"The Council has surrendered. Its rule is at an end for evermore.\"\n\n\"Look!\" and Ostrog pointed to a coil of black that crept in little jerks\nup the vacant flagstaff, unfolding as it rose.\n\nThe oval picture paled as Lincoln pulled the curtain aside and entered.\n\n\"They are clamorous,\" he said.\n\nOstrog kept his grip of Graham's arm.\n\n\"We have raised the people,\" he said. \"We have given them arms. For\nto-day at least their wishes must be law.\"\n\nLincoln held the curtain open for Graham and Ostrog to pass through....\n\nOn his way to the markets Graham had a transitory glance of a long narrow\nwhite-walled room in which men in the universal blue canvas were carrying\ncovered things like biers, and about which men in medical purple hurried\nto and fro. From this room came groans and wailing. He had an impression\nof an empty blood-stained couch, of men on other couches, bandaged and\nblood-stained. It was just a glimpse from a railed footway and then a\nbuttress hid the place and they were going on towards the markets....\n\nThe roar of the multitude was near now: it leapt to thunder. And,\narresting his attention, a fluttering of black banners, the waving of\nblue canvas and brown rags, and the swarming vastness of the theatre near\nthe public markets came into view down a long passage. The picture opened\nout. He perceived they were entering the great theatre of his first\nappearance, the great theatre he had last seen as a chequer-work of glare\nand blackness in his flight from the red police. This time he entered it\nalong a gallery at a level high above the stage. The place was now\nbrilliantly lit again. His eyes sought the gangway up which he had fled,\nbut he could not tell it from among its dozens of fellows; nor could he\nsee anything of the smashed seats, deflated cushions, and such like\ntraces of the fight because of the density of the people. Except the\nstage the whole place was closely packed. Looking down the effect was a\nvast area of stippled pink, each dot a still upturned face regarding him.\nAt his appearance with Ostrog the cheering died away, the singing died\naway, a common interest stilled and unified the disorder. It seemed as\nthough every individual of those myriads was watching him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE END OF THE OLD ORDER\n\n\nSo far as Graham was able to judge, it was near midday when the white\nbanner of the Council fell. But some hours had to elapse before it was\npossible to effect the formal capitulation, and so after he had spoken\nhis \"Word\" he retired to his new apartments in the wind-vane offices. The\ncontinuous excitement of the last twelve hours had left him inordinately\nfatigued, even his curiosity was exhausted; for a space he sat inert and\npassive with open eyes, and for a space he slept. He was roused by two\nmedical attendants, come prepared with stimulants to sustain him through\nthe next occasion. After he had taken their drugs and bathed by their\nadvice in cold water, he felt a rapid return of interest and energy, and\nwas presently able and willing to accompany Ostrog through several miles\n(as it seemed) of passages, lifts, and slides to the closing scene of the\nWhite Council's rule.\n\nThe way ran deviously through a maze of buildings. They came at last to a\npassage that curved about, and showed broadening before him an oblong\nopening, clouds hot with sunset, and the ragged skyline of the ruinous\nCouncil House. A tumult of shouts came drifting up to him. In another\nmoment they had come out high up on the brow of the cliff of torn\nbuildings that overhung the wreckage. The vast area opened to Graham's\neyes, none the less strange and wonderful for the remote view he had had\nof it in the oval mirror.\n\nThis rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the better part of a mile to\nits outer edge. It was gold lit on the left hand, catching the sunlight,\nand below and to the right clear and cold in the shadow. Above the\nshadowy grey Council House that stood in the midst of it, the great black\nbanner of the surrender still hung in sluggish folds against the blazing\nsunset. Severed rooms, halls and passages gaped strangely, broken masses\nof metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage, vast masses of\ntwisted cable dropped like tangled seaweed, and from its base came a\ntumult of innumerable voices, violent concussions, and the sound of\ntrumpets. All about this great white pile was a ring of desolation; the\nsmashed and blackened masses, the gaunt foundations and ruinous lumber of\nthe fabric that had been destroyed by the Council's orders, skeletons of\ngirders, Titanic masses of wall, forests of stout pillars. Amongst the\nsombre wreckage beneath, running water flashed and glistened, and far\naway across the space, out of the midst of a vague vast mass of\nbuildings, there thrust the twisted end of a water-main, two hundred feet\nin the air, thunderously spouting a shining cascade. And everywhere great\nmultitudes of people.\n\nWherever there was space and foothold, people swarmed, little people,\nsmall and minutely clear, except where the sunset touched them to\nindistinguishable gold. They clambered up the tottering walls, they clung\nin wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars. They swarmed along\nthe edges of the circle of ruins. The air was full of their shouting, and\nthey were pressing and swaying towards the central space.\n\nThe upper storeys of the Council House seemed deserted, not a human\nbeing was visible. Only the drooping banner of the surrender hung\nheavily against the light. The dead were within the Council House, or\nhidden by the swarming people, or carried away. Graham could see only a\nfew neglected bodies in gaps and corners of the ruins, and amidst the\nflowing water.\n\n\"Will you let them see you, Sire?\" said Ostrog. \"They are very anxious\nto see you.\"\n\nGraham hesitated, and then walked forward to where the broken verge of\nwall dropped sheer. He stood looking down, a lonely, tall, black figure\nagainst the sky.\n\nVery slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him. And as they did so\nlittle bands of black-uniformed men appeared remotely, thrusting through\nthe crowds towards the Council House. He saw little black heads become\npink, looking at him, saw by that means a wave of recognition sweep\nacross the space. It occurred to him that he should accord them some\nrecognition. He held up his arm, then pointed to the Council House and\ndropped his hand. The voices below became unanimous, gathered volume,\ncame up to him as multitudinous wavelets of cheering.\n\nThe western sky was a pallid bluish green, and Jupiter shone high in the\nsouth, before the capitulation was accomplished. Above was a slow\ninsensible change, the advance of night serene and beautiful; below was\nhurry, excitement, conflicting orders, pauses, spasmodic developments of\norganisation, a vast ascending clamour and confusion. Before the Council\ncame out, toiling perspiring men, directed by a conflict of shouts,\ncarried forth hundreds of those who had perished in the hand-to-hand\nconflict within those long passages and chambers....\n\nGuards in black lined the way that the Council would come, and as far as\nthe eye could reach into the hazy blue twilight of the ruins, and\nswarming now at every possible point in the captured Council House and\nalong the shattered cliff of its circumadjacent buildings, were\ninnumerable people, and their voices, even when they were not cheering,\nwere as the soughing of the sea upon a pebble beach. Ostrog had chosen a\nhuge commanding pile of crushed and overthrown masonry, and on this a\nstage of timbers and metal girders was being hastily constructed. Its\nessential parts were complete, but humming and clangorous machinery still\nglared fitfully in the shadows beneath this temporary edifice.\n\nThe stage had a small higher portion on which Graham stood with Ostrog\nand Lincoln close beside him, a little in advance of a group of minor\nofficers. A broader lower stage surrounded this quarter-deck, and on this\nwere the black-uniformed guards of the revolt armed with the little green\nweapons whose very names Graham still did not know. Those standing about\nhim perceived that his eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming people\nin the twilight ruins about him to the darkling mass of the White Council\nHouse, whence the Trustees would presently come, and to the gaunt cliffs\nof ruin that encircled him, and so back to the people. The voices of the\ncrowd swelled to a deafening tumult.\n\nHe saw the Councillors first afar off in the glare of one of the\ntemporary lights that marked their path, a little group of white figures\nin a black archway. In the Council House they had been in darkness. He\nwatched them approaching, drawing nearer past first this blazing\nelectric star and then that; the minatory roar of the crowd over whom\ntheir power had lasted for a hundred and fifty years marched along beside\nthem. As they drew still nearer their faces came out weary, white, and\nanxious. He saw them blinking up through the glare about him and Ostrog.\nHe contrasted their strange cold looks in the Hall of Atlas.... Presently\nhe could recognise several of them; the man who had rapped the table at\nHoward, a burly man with a red beard, and one delicate-featured, short,\ndark man with a peculiarly long skull. He noted that two were whispering\ntogether and looking behind him at Ostrog. Next there came a tall, dark\nand handsome man, walking downcast. Abruptly he glanced up, his eyes\ntouched Graham for a moment, and passed beyond him to Ostrog. The way\nthat had been made for them was so contrived that they had to march past\nand curve about before they came to the sloping path of planks that\nascended to the stage where their surrender was to be made.\n\n\"The Master, the Master! God and the Master,\" shouted the people. \"To\nhell with the Council!\" Graham looked at their multitudes, receding\nbeyond counting into a shouting haze, and then at Ostrog beside him,\nwhite and steadfast and still. His eye went again to the little group of\nWhite Councillors. And then he looked up at the familiar quiet stars\noverhead. The marvellous element in his fate was suddenly vivid. Could\nthat be his indeed, that little life in his memory two hundred years gone\nby--and this as well?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nFROM THE CROW'S NEST\n\n\nAnd so after strange delays and through an avenue of doubt and battle,\nthis man from the nineteenth century came at last to his position at the\nhead of that complex world.\n\nAt first when he rose from the long deep sleep that followed his rescue\nand the surrender of the Council, he did not recognise his surroundings.\nBy an effort he gained a clue in his mind, and all that had happened came\nback to him, at first with a quality of insincerity like a story heard,\nlike something read out of a book. And even before his memories were\nclear, the exultation of his escape, the wonder of his prominence were\nback in his mind. He was owner of the world; Master of the Earth. This\nnew great age was in the completest sense his. He no longer hoped to\ndiscover his experiences a dream; he became anxious now to convince\nhimself that they were real.\n\nAn obsequious valet assisted him to dress under the direction of a\ndignified chief attendant, a little man whose face proclaimed him\nJapanese, albeit he spoke English like an Englishman. From the latter he\nlearnt something of the state of affairs. Already the revolution was an\naccepted fact; already business was being resumed throughout the city.\nAbroad the downfall of the Council had been received for the most part\nwith delight. Nowhere was the Council popular, and the thousand cities\nof Western America, after two hundred years still jealous of New York,\nLondon, and the East, had risen almost unanimously two days before at the\nnews of Graham's imprisonment. Paris was fighting within itself. The rest\nof the world hung in suspense.\n\nWhile he was breaking his fast, the sound of a telephone bell jetted from\na corner, and his chief attendant called his attention to the voice of\nOstrog making polite enquiries. Graham interrupted his refreshment to\nreply. Very shortly Lincoln arrived, and Graham at once expressed a\nstrong desire to talk to people and to be shown more of the new life that\nwas opening before him. Lincoln informed him that in three hours' time a\nrepresentative gathering of officials and their wives would be held in\nthe state apartments of the wind-vane Chief. Graham's desire to traverse\nthe ways of the city was, however, at present impossible, because of the\nenormous excitement of the people. It was, however, quite possible for\nhim to take a bird's-eye view of the city from the crow's nest of the\nwind-vane keeper. To this accordingly Graham was conducted by his\nattendant. Lincoln; with a graceful compliment to the attendant,\napologised for not accompanying them, on account of the present pressure\nof administrative work.\n\nHigher even than the most gigantic, wind-wheels hung this crow's nest, a\nclear thousand feet above the roofs, a little disc-shaped speck on a\nspear of metallic filigree, cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn\nin a little wire-hung cradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming stem was a\nlight gallery about which hung a cluster of tubes--minute they looked\nfrom above--rotating slowly on the ring of its outer rail. These were the\nspecula, _en rapport_ with the wind-vane keeper's mirrors, in one of\nwhich Ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule. His Japanese attendant\nascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering\nquestions.\n\nIt was a day full of the promise and quality of spring. The touch of the\nwind warmed. The sky was an intense blue and the vast expanse of London\nshone dazzling under the morning sun. The air was clear of smoke and\nhaze, sweet as the air of a mountain glen.\n\nSave for the irregular oval of ruins about the House of the Council and\nthe black flag of the surrender that fluttered there, the mighty city\nseen from above showed few signs of the swift revolution that had, to his\nimagination, in one night and one day, changed the destinies of the\nworld. A multitude of people still swarmed over these ruins, and the huge\nopenwork stagings in the distance from which started in times of peace\nthe service of aeroplanes to the various great cities of Europe and\nAmerica, were also black with the victors. Across a narrow way of\nplanking raised on trestles that crossed the ruins a crowd of workmen\nwere busy restoring the connection between the cables and wires of the\nCouncil House and the rest of the city, preparatory to the transfer\nthither of Ostrog's headquarters from the Wind-Vane buildings.\n\nFor the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed. So vast was its\nserenity in comparison with the areas of disturbance, that presently\nGraham, looking beyond them, could almost forget the thousands of men\nlying out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasi-subterranean\nlabyrinth, dead or dying of the overnight wounds, forget the improvised\nwards with the hosts of surgeons, nurses, and bearers feverishly busy,\nforget, indeed, all the wonder, consternation and novelty under the\nelectric lights. Down there in the hidden ways of the anthill he knew\nthat the revolution triumphed, that black everywhere carried the day,\nblack favours, black banners, black festoons across the streets. And out\nhere, under the fresh sunlight, beyond the crater of the fight, as if\nnothing had happened to the earth, the forest of wind vanes that had\ngrown from one or two while the Council had ruled, roared peacefully upon\ntheir incessant duty.\n\nFar away, spiked, jagged and indented by the wind vanes, the Surrey Hills\nrose blue and faint; to the north and nearer, the sharp contours of\nHighgate and Muswell Hill were similarly jagged. And all over the\ncountryside, he knew, on every crest and hill, where once the hedges had\ninterlaced, and cottages, churches, inns, and farm houses had nestled\namong their trees, wind-wheels similar to those he saw and bearing like\nthem vast advertisements, gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new age,\ncast their whirling shadows and stored incessantly the energy that flowed\naway incessantly through all the arteries of the city. And underneath\nthese wandered the countless flocks and herds of the British Food Trust,\nhis property, with their lonely guards and keepers.\n\nNot a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of gigantic shapes\nbelow. St. Paul's he knew survived, and many of the old buildings in\nWestminster, embedded out of sight, arched over and covered in among the\ngiant growths of this great age. The Thames, too, made no fall and gleam\nof silver to break the wilderness of the city; the thirsty water mains\ndrank up every drop of its waters before they reached the walls. Its bed\nand estuary, scoured and sunken, was now a canal of sea water, and a race\nof grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials of trade from the Pool\nthereby beneath the very feet of the workers. Faint and dim in the\neastward between earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal\nshipping in the Pool. For all the heavy traffic, for which there was no\nneed of haste, came in gigantic sailing ships from the ends of the earth,\nand the heavy goods for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a\nsmaller swifter sort.\n\nAnd to the south over the hills came vast aqueducts with sea water for\nthe sewers, and in three separate directions ran pallid lines--the roads,\nstippled with moving grey specks. On the first occasion that offered he\nwas determined to go out and see these roads. That would come after the\nflying ship he was presently to try. His attendant officer described them\nas a pair of gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide, each one for\nthe traffic going in one direction, and made of a substance called\nEadhamite--an artificial substance, so far as he could gather, resembling\ntoughened glass. Along this shot a strange traffic of narrow rubber-shod\nvehicles, great single wheels, two and four wheeled vehicles, sweeping\nalong at velocities of from one to six miles a minute. Railroads had\nvanished; a few embankments remained as rust-crowned trenches here and\nthere. Some few formed the cores of Eadhamite ways.\n\nAmong the first things to strike his attention had been the great fleets\nof advertisement balloons and kites that receded in irregular vistas\nnorthward and southward along the lines of the aeroplane journeys. No\ngreat aeroplanes were to be seen. Their passages had ceased, and only one\nlittle-seeming monoplane circled high in the blue distance above the\nSurrey Hills, an unimpressive soaring speck.\n\nA thing Graham had already learnt, and which he found very hard to\nimagine, was that nearly all the towns in the country, and almost all the\nvillages, had disappeared. Here and there only, he understood, some\ngigantic hotel-like edifice stood amid square miles of some single\ncultivation and preserved the name of a town--as Bournemouth, Wareham, or\nSwanage. Yet the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable such a\nchange had been. The old order had dotted the country with farmhouses,\nand every two or three miles was the ruling landlord's estate, and the\nplace of the inn and cobbler, the grocer's shop and church--the village.\nEvery eight miles or so was the country town, where lawyer, corn\nmerchant, wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon, doctor, draper,\nmilliner and so forth lived. Every eight miles--simply because that eight\nmile marketing journey, four there and back, was as much as was\ncomfortable for the farmer. But directly the railways came into play, and\nafter them the light railways, and all the swift new motor cars that had\nreplaced waggons and horses, and so soon as the high roads began to be\nmade of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite, and all sorts of elastic durable\nsubstances--the necessity of having such frequent market towns\ndisappeared. And the big towns grew. They drew the worker with the\ngravitational force of seemingly endless work, the employer with their\nsuggestion of an infinite ocean of labour.\n\nAnd as the standard of comfort rose, as the complexity of the mechanism\nof living increased, life in the country had become more and more costly,\nor narrow and impossible. The disappearance of vicar and squire, the\nextinction of the general practitioner by the city specialist; had robbed\nthe village of its last touch of culture. After telephone, kinematograph\nand phonograph had replaced newspaper, book, schoolmaster, and letter, to\nlive outside the range of the electric cables was to live an isolated\nsavage. In the country were neither means of being clothed nor fed\n(according to the refined conceptions of the time), no efficient doctors\nfor an emergency, no company and no pursuits.\n\nMoreover, mechanical appliances in agriculture made one engineer the\nequivalent of thirty labourers. So, inverting the condition of the city\nclerk in the days when London was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly\nfoulness of its air, the labourers now came to the city and its life and\ndelights at night to leave it again in the morning. The city had\nswallowed up humanity; man had entered upon a new stage in his\ndevelopment. First had come the nomad, the hunter, then had followed the\nagriculturist of the agricultural state, whose towns and cities and ports\nwere but the headquarters and markets of the countryside. And now,\nlogical consequence of an epoch of invention, was this huge new\naggregation of men.\n\nSuch things as these, simple statements of fact though they were to\ncontemporary men, strained Graham's imagination to picture. And when he\nglanced \"over beyond there\" at the strange things that existed on the\nContinent, it failed him altogether.\n\nHe had a vision of city beyond city; cities on great plains, cities\nbeside great rivers, vast cities along the sea margin, cities girdled by\nsnowy mountains. Over a great part of the earth the English tongue was\nspoken; taken together with its Spanish American and Hindoo and Negro and\n\"Pidgin\" dialects, it was the everyday-language of two-thirds of\nhumanity. On the Continent, save as remote and curious survivals, three\nother languages alone held sway--German, which reached to Antioch and\nGenoa and jostled Spanish-English at Cadiz; a Gallicised Russian which\nmet the Indian English in Persia and Kurdistan and the \"Pidgin\" English\nin Pekin; and French still clear and brilliant, the language of lucidity,\nwhich shared the Mediterranean with the Indian English and German and\nreached through a negro dialect to the Congo.\n\nAnd everywhere now through the city-set earth, save in the administered\n\"black belt\" territories of the tropics, the same cosmopolitan social\norganisation prevailed, and everywhere from Pole to Equator his property\nand his responsibilities extended. The whole world was civilised; the\nwhole world dwelt in cities; the whole world was his property....\n\nOut of the dim south-west, glittering and strange, voluptuous, and in\nsome way terrible, shone those Pleasure Cities of which the\nkinematograph-phonograph and the old man in the street had spoken.\nStrange places reminiscent of the legendary Sybaris, cities of art\nand beauty, mercenary art and mercenary beauty, sterile wonderful\ncities of motion and music, whither repaired all who profited by the\nfierce, inglorious, economic struggle that went on in the glaring\nlabyrinth below.\n\nFierce he knew it was. How fierce he could judge from the fact that these\nlatter-day people referred back to the England of the nineteenth century\nas the figure of an idyllic easy-going life. He turned his eyes to the\nscene immediately before him again, trying to conceive the big factories\nof that intricate maze....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nPROMINENT PEOPLE\n\n\nThe state apartments of the Wind Vane Keeper would have astonished Graham\nhad he entered them fresh from his nineteenth century life, but already\nhe was growing accustomed to the scale of the new time. He came out\nthrough one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a plateau of landing\nat the head of a flight of very broad and gentle steps, with men and\nwomen far more brilliantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen,\nascending and descending. From this position he looked down a vista of\nsubtle and varied ornament in lustreless white and mauve and purple,\nspanned by bridges that seemed wrought of porcelain and filigree, and\nterminating far off in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens.\n\nGlancing upward, he saw tier above tier of ascending galleries with faces\nlooking down upon him. The air was full of the babble of innumerable\nvoices and of a music that descended from above, a gay and exhilarating\nmusic whose source he did not discover.\n\nThe central aisle was thick with people, but by no means uncomfortably\ncrowded; altogether that assembly must have numbered many thousands. They\nwere brilliantly, even fantastically dressed, the men as fancifully as\nthe women, for the sobering influence of the Puritan conception of\ndignity upon masculine dress had long since passed away. The hair of the\nmen, too, though it was rarely worn long, was commonly curled in a\nmanner that suggested the barber, and baldness had vanished from the\nearth. Frizzy straight-cut masses that would have charmed Rossetti\nabounded, and one gentleman, who was pointed out to Graham under the\nmysterious title of an \"amorist,\" wore his hair in two becoming plaits _\u00e0\nla_ Marguerite. The pigtail was in evidence; it would seem that citizens\nof Chinese extraction were no longer ashamed of their race. There was\nlittle uniformity of fashion apparent in the forms of clothing worn. The\nmore shapely men displayed their symmetry in trunk hose, and here were\npuffs and slashes, and there a cloak and there a robe. The fashions of\nthe days of Leo the Tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence, but the\naesthetic conceptions of the far east were also patent. Masculine\nembonpoint, which, in Victorian times, would have been subjected to the\nbuttoned perils, the ruthless exaggeration of tight-legged tight-armed\nevening dress, now formed but the basis of a wealth of dignity and\ndrooping folds. Graceful slenderness abounded also. To Graham, a\ntypically stiff man from a typically stiff period, not only did these men\nseem altogether too graceful in person, but altogether too expressive in\ntheir vividly expressive faces. They gesticulated, they expressed\nsurprise, interest, amusement, above all, they expressed the emotions\nexcited in their minds by the ladies about them with astonishing\nfrankness. Even at the first glance it was evident that women were in a\ngreat majority.\n\nThe ladies in the company of these gentlemen displayed in dress, bearing\nand manner alike, less emphasis and more intricacy. Some affected a\nclassical simplicity of robing and subtlety of fold, after the fashion of\nthe First French Empire, and flashed conquering arms and shoulders as\nGraham passed. Others had closely-fitting dresses without seam or belt at\nthe waist, sometimes with long folds falling from the shoulders. The\ndelightful confidences of evening dress had not been diminished by the\npassage of two centuries.\n\nEveryone's movements seemed graceful. Graham remarked to Lincoln that he\nsaw men as Raphael's cartoons walking, and Lincoln told him that the\nattainment of an appropriate set of gestures was part of every rich\nperson's education. The Master's entry was greeted with a sort of\ntittering applause, but these people showed their distinguished manners\nby not crowding upon him nor annoying him by any persistent scrutiny, as\nhe descended the steps towards the floor of the aisle.\n\nHe had already learnt from Lincoln that these were the leaders of\nexisting London society; almost every person there that night was either\na powerful official or the immediate connexion of a powerful official.\nMany had returned from the European Pleasure Cities expressly to welcome\nhim. The aeronautic authorities, whose defection had played a part in the\noverthrow of the Council only second to Graham's, were very prominent,\nand so, too, was the Wind Vane Control. Amongst others there were several\nof the more prominent officers of the Food Department; the controller of\nthe European Piggeries had a particularly melancholy and interesting\ncountenance and a daintily cynical manner. A bishop in full canonicals\npassed athwart Graham's vision, conversing with a gentleman dressed\nexactly like the traditional Chaucer, including even the laurel wreath.\n\n\"Who is that?\" he asked almost involuntarily.\n\n\"The Bishop of London,\" said Lincoln.\n\n\"No--the other, I mean.\"\n\n\"Poet Laureate.\"\n\n\"You still--?\"\n\n\"He doesn't make poetry, of course. He's a cousin of Wotton--one of the\nCouncillors. But he's one of the Red Rose Royalists--a delightful\nclub--and they keep up the tradition of these things.\"\n\n\"Asano told me there was a King.\"\n\n\"The King doesn't belong. They had to expel him. It's the Stuart blood, I\nsuppose; but really--\"\n\n\"Too much?\"\n\n\"Far too much.\"\n\nGraham did not quite follow all this, but it seemed part of the general\ninversion of the new age. He bowed condescendingly to his first\nintroduction. It was evident that subtle distinctions of class prevailed\neven in this assembly, that only to a small proportion of the guests, to\nan inner group, did Lincoln consider it appropriate to introduce him.\nThis first introduction was the Master Aeronaut, a man whose sun-tanned\nface contrasted oddly with the delicate complexions about him. Just at\npresent his critical defection from the Council made him a very important\nperson indeed.\n\nHis manner contrasted very favourably, according to Graham's ideas, with\nthe general bearing. He offered a few commonplace remarks, assurances of\nloyalty and frank inquiries about the Master's health. His manner was\nbreezy, his accent lacked the easy staccato of latter-day English. He\nmade it admirably clear to Graham that he was a bluff \"aerial dog\"--he\nused that phrase--that there was no nonsense about him, that he was a\nthoroughly manly fellow and old-fashioned at that, that he didn't profess\nto know much, and that what he did not know was not worth knowing. He\nmade a curt bow, ostentatiously free from obsequiousness, and passed.\n\n\"I am glad to see that type endures,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Phonographs and kinematographs,\" said Lincoln, a little spitefully. \"He\nhas studied from the life.\" Graham glanced at the burly form again. It\nwas oddly reminiscent.\n\n\"As a matter of fact we bought him,\" said Lincoln. \"Partly. And partly he\nwas afraid of Ostrog. Everything rested with him.\"\n\nHe turned sharply to introduce the Surveyor-General of the Public\nSchools. This person was a willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown,\nhe beamed down upon Graham through _pince-nez_ of a Victorian pattern,\nand illustrated his remarks by gestures of a beautifully manicured hand.\nGraham was immediately interested in this gentleman's functions, and\nasked him a number of singularly direct questions. The Surveyor-General\nseemed quietly amused at the Master's fundamental bluntness. He was a\nlittle vague as to the monopoly of education his Company possessed; it\nwas done by contract with the syndicate that ran the numerous London\nMunicipalities, but he waxed enthusiastic over educational progress\nsince the Victorian times. \"We have conquered Cram,\" he said,\n\"completely conquered Cram--there is not an examination left in the\nworld. Aren't you glad?\"\n\n\"How do you get the work done?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"We make it attractive--as attractive as possible. And if it does not\nattract then--we let it go. We cover an immense field.\"\n\nHe proceeded to details, and they had a lengthy conversation. Graham\nlearnt that University Extension still existed in a modified form. \"There\nis a certain type of girl, for example,\" said the Surveyor-General,\ndilating with a sense of his usefulness, \"with a perfect passion for\nsevere studies--when they are not too difficult you know. We cater for\nthem by the thousand. At this moment,\" he said with a Napoleonic touch,\n\"nearly five hundred phonographs are lecturing in different parts of\nLondon on the influence exercised by Plato and Swift on the love affairs\nof Shelley, Hazlitt, and Burns. And afterwards they write essays on the\nlectures, and the names in order of merit are put in conspicuous places.\nYou see how your little germ has grown? The illiterate middle-class of\nyour days has quite passed away.\"\n\n\"About the public elementary schools,\" said Graham. \"Do you\ncontrol them?\"\n\nThe Surveyor-General did, \"entirely.\" Now, Graham, in his later\ndemocratic days, had taken a keen interest in these and his questioning\nquickened. Certain casual phrases that had fallen from the old man with\nwhom he had talked in the darkness recurred to him. The Surveyor-General,\nin effect, endorsed the old man's words. \"We try and make the elementary\nschools very pleasant for the little children. They will have to work so\nsoon. Just a few simple principles--obedience--industry.\"\n\n\"You teach them very little?\"\n\n\"Why should we? It only leads to trouble and discontent. We amuse them.\nEven as it is--there are troubles--agitations. Where the labourers get\nthe ideas, one cannot tell. They tell one another. There are socialistic\ndreams--anarchy even! Agitators _will_ get to work among them. I take\nit--I have always taken it--that my foremost duty is to fight against\npopular discontent. Why should people be made unhappy?\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham thoughtfully. \"But there are a great many things\nI want to know.\"\n\nLincoln, who had stood watching Graham's face throughout the\nconversation, intervened. \"There are others,\" he said in an undertone.\n\nThe Surveyor-General of schools gesticulated himself away. \"Perhaps,\"\nsaid Lincoln, intercepting a casual glance, \"you would like to know some\nof these ladies?\"\n\nThe daughter of the Manager of the Piggeries was a particularly charming\nlittle person with red hair and animated blue eyes. Lincoln left him\nawhile to converse with her, and she displayed herself as quite an\nenthusiast for the \"dear old days,\" as she called them, that had seen the\nbeginning of his trance. As she talked she smiled, and her eyes smiled in\na manner that demanded reciprocity.\n\n\"I have tried,\" she said, \"countless times--to imagine those old romantic\ndays. And to you--they are memories. How strange and crowded the world\nmust seem to you! I have seen photographs and pictures of the past, the\nlittle isolated houses built of bricks made out of burnt mud and all\nblack with soot from your fires, the railway bridges, the simple\nadvertisements, the solemn savage Puritanical men in strange black coats\nand those tall hats of theirs, iron railway trains on iron bridges\noverhead, horses and cattle, and even dogs running half wild about the\nstreets. And suddenly, you have come into this!\"\n\n\"Into this,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Out of your life--out of all that was familiar.\"\n\n\"The old life was not a happy one,\" said Graham. \"I do not regret that.\"\n\nShe looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause. She sighed\nencouragingly. \"No?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham. \"It was a little life--and unmeaning. But this--We\nthought the world complex and crowded and civilised enough. Yet I\nsee--although in this world I am barely four days old--looking back on my\nown time, that it was a queer, barbaric time--the mere beginning of this\nnew order. The mere beginning of this new order. You will find it hard to\nunderstand how little I know.\"\n\n\"You may ask me what you like,\" she said, smiling at him.\n\n\"Then tell me who these people are. I'm still very much in the dark about\nthem. It's puzzling. Are there any Generals?\"\n\n\"Men in hats and feathers?\"\n\n\"Of course not. No. I suppose they are the men who control the great\npublic businesses. Who is that distinguished looking man?\"\n\n\"That? He's a most important officer. That is Morden. He is managing\ndirector of the Antibilious Pill Department. I have heard that his\nworkers sometimes turn out a myriad myriad pills a day in the twenty-four\nhours. Fancy a myriad myriad!\"\n\n\"A myriad myriad. No wonder he looks proud,\" said Graham. \"Pills! What a\nwonderful time it is! That man in purple?\"\n\n\"He is not quite one of the inner circle, you know. But we like him. He\nis really clever and very amusing. He is one of the heads of the Medical\nFaculty of our London University. All medical men, you know, wear that\npurple. But, of course, people who are paid by fees for _doing_\nsomething--\" She smiled away the social pretensions of all such people.\n\n\"Are any of your great artists or authors here?\"\n\n\"No authors. They are mostly such queer people--and so preoccupied about\nthemselves. And they quarrel so dreadfully! They will fight, some of\nthem, for precedence on staircases! Dreadful, isn't it? But I think\nWraysbury, the fashionable capillotomist, is here. From Capri.\"\n\n\"Capillotomist,\" said Graham. \"Ah! I remember. An artist! Why not?\"\n\n\"We have to cultivate him,\" she said apologetically. \"Our heads are in\nhis hands.\" She smiled.\n\nGraham hesitated at the invited compliment, but his glance was\nexpressive. \"Have the arts grown with the rest of civilised things?\" he\nsaid. \"Who are your great painters?\"\n\nShe looked at him doubtfully. Then laughed. \"For a moment,\" she said, \"I\nthought you meant--\" She laughed again. \"You mean, of course, those good\nmen you used to think so much of because they could cover great spaces of\ncanvas with oil-colours? Great oblongs. And people used to put the things\nin gilt frames and hang them up in rows in their square rooms. We haven't\nany. People grew tired of that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"But what did you think I meant?\"\n\nShe put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow was above suspicion,\nand smiled and looked very arch and pretty and inviting. \"And here,\" and\nshe indicated her eyelid.\n\nGraham had an adventurous moment. Then a grotesque memory of a picture he\nhad somewhere seen of Uncle Toby and the widow flashed across his mind.\nAn archaic shame came upon him. He became acutely aware that he was\nvisible to a great number of interested people. \"I see,\" he remarked\ninadequately. He turned awkwardly away from her fascinating facility. He\nlooked about him to meet a number of eyes that immediately occupied\nthemselves with other things. Possibly he coloured a little. \"Who is that\ntalking with the lady in saffron?\" he asked, avoiding her eyes.\n\nThe person in question he learnt was one of the great organisers of the\nAmerican theatres just fresh from a gigantic production at Mexico. His\nface reminded Graham of a bust of Caligula. Another striking looking man\nwas the Black Labour Master. The phrase at the time made no deep\nimpression, but afterwards it recurred;--the Black Labour Master? The\nlittle lady in no degree embarrassed, pointed out to him a charming\nlittle woman as one of the subsidiary wives of the Anglican Bishop of\nLondon. She added encomiums on the episcopal courage--hitherto there had\nbeen a rule of clerical monogamy--\"neither a natural nor an expedient\ncondition of things. Why should the natural development of the affections\nbe dwarfed and restricted because a man is a priest?\"\n\n\"And, bye the bye,\" she added, \"are you an Anglican?\" Graham was on the\nverge of hesitating inquiries about the status of a \"subsidiary wife,\"\napparently an euphemistic phrase, when Lincoln's return broke off this\nvery suggestive and interesting conversation. They crossed the aisle to\nwhere a tall man in crimson, and two charming persons in Burmese costume\n(as it seemed to him) awaited him diffidently. From their civilities he\npassed to other presentations.\n\nIn a little while his multitudinous impressions began to organise\nthemselves into a general effect. At first the glitter of the gathering\nhad raised all the democrat in Graham; he had felt hostile and satirical.\nBut it is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of courteous\nregard. Soon the music, the light, the play of colours, the shining arms\nand shoulders about him, the touch of hands, the transient interest of\nsmiling faces, the frothing sound of skilfully modulated voices, the\natmosphere of compliment, interest and respect, had woven together into a\nfabric of indisputable pleasure. Graham for a time forgot his spacious\nresolutions. He gave way insensibly to the intoxication of the position\nthat was conceded him, his manner became more convincingly regal, his\nfeet walked assuredly, the black robe fell with a bolder fold and pride\nennobled his voice. After all, this was a brilliant interesting world.\n\nHe looked up and saw passing across a bridge of porcelain and looking\ndown upon him, a face that was almost immediately hidden, the face of the\ngirl he had seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre after\nhis escape from the Council. And she was watching him.\n\nFor the moment he did not remember when he had seen her, and then came a\nvague memory of the stirring emotions of their first encounter. But the\ndancing web of melody about him kept the air of that great marching song\nfrom his memory.\n\nThe lady to whom he talked repeated her remark, and Graham recalled\nhimself to the quasi-regal flirtation upon which he was engaged.\n\nYet, unaccountably, a vague restlessness, a feeling that grew to\ndissatisfaction, came into his mind. He was troubled as if by some half\nforgotten duty, by the sense of things important slipping from him amidst\nthis light and brilliance. The attraction that these ladies who crowded\nabout him were beginning to exercise ceased. He no longer gave vague and\nclumsy responses to the subtly amorous advances that he was now assured\nwere being made to him, and his eyes wandered for another sight of the\ngirl of the first revolt.\n\nWhere, precisely, had he seen her?...\n\nGraham was in one of the upper galleries in conversation with a\nbright-eyed lady on the subject of Eadhamite--the subject was his choice\nand not hers. He had interrupted her warm assurances of personal devotion\nwith a matter-of-fact inquiry. He found her, as he had already found\nseveral other latter-day women that night, less well informed than\ncharming. Suddenly, struggling against the eddying drift of nearer\nmelody, the song of the Revolt, the great song he had heard in the Hall,\nhoarse and massive, came beating down to him.\n\nAh! Now he remembered!\n\nHe glanced up startled, and perceived above him an _oeil de boeuf_\nthrough which this song had come, and beyond, the upper courses of cable,\nthe blue haze, and the pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways.\nHe heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease. He perceived\nquite clearly the drone and tumult of the moving platforms and a murmur\nof many people. He had a vague persuasion that he could not account for,\na sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a huge crowd must\nbe watching this place in which their Master amused himself.\n\nThough the song had stopped so abruptly, though the special music of\nthis gathering reasserted itself, the _motif_ of the marching song, once\nit had begun, lingered in his mind.\n\nThe bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the mysteries of Eadhamite\nwhen he perceived the girl he had seen in the theatre again. She was\ncoming now along the gallery towards him; he saw her first before she saw\nhim. She was dressed in a faintly luminous grey, her dark hair about her\nbrows was like a cloud, and as he saw her the cold light from the\ncircular opening into the ways fell upon her downcast face.\n\nThe lady in trouble about the Eadhamite saw the change in his expression,\nand grasped her opportunity to escape. \"Would you care to know that girl,\nSire?\" she asked boldly. \"She is Helen Wotton--a niece of Ostrog's. She\nknows a great many serious things. She is one of the most serious persons\nalive. I am sure you will like her.\"\n\nIn another moment Graham was talking to the girl, and the bright-eyed\nlady had fluttered away.\n\n\"I remember you quite well,\" said Graham. \"You were in that little room.\nWhen all the people were singing and beating time with their feet. Before\nI walked across the Hall.\"\n\nHer momentary embarrassment passed. She looked up at him, and her face\nwas steady. \"It was wonderful,\" she said, hesitated, and spoke with a\nsudden effort. \"All those people would have died for you, Sire. Countless\npeople did die for you that night.\"\n\nHer face glowed. She glanced swiftly aside to see that no other heard\nher words.\n\nLincoln appeared some way off along the gallery, making his way through\nthe press towards them. She saw him and turned to Graham strangely\neager, with a swift change to confidence and intimacy. \"Sire,\" she said\nquickly, \"I cannot tell you now and here. But the common people are very\nunhappy; they are oppressed--they are misgoverned. Do not forget the\npeople, who faced death--death that you might live.\"\n\n\"I know nothing--\" began Graham.\n\n\"I cannot tell you now.\"\n\nLincoln's face appeared close to them. He bowed an apology to the girl.\n\n\"You find the new world amusing, Sire?\" asked Lincoln, with smiling\ndeference, and indicating the space and splendour of the gathering by one\ncomprehensive gesture. \"At any rate, you find it changed.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham, \"changed. And yet, after all, not so greatly\nchanged.\"\n\n\"Wait till you are in the air,\" said Lincoln. \"The wind has fallen; even\nnow an aeroplane awaits you.\"\n\nThe girl's attitude awaited dismissal.\n\nGraham glanced at her face, was on the verge of a question, found a\nwarning in her expression, bowed to her and turned to accompany Lincoln.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE MONOPLANE\n\n\nThe Flying Stages of London were collected together in an irregular\ncrescent on the southern side of the river. They formed three groups of\ntwo each and retained the names of ancient suburban hills or villages.\nThey were named in order, Roehampton, Wimbledon Park, Streatham, Norwood,\nBlackheath, and Shooter's Hill. They were uniform structures rising high\nabove the general roof surfaces. Each was about four thousand yards long\nand a thousand broad, and constructed of the compound of aluminum and\niron that had replaced iron in architecture. Their higher tiers formed an\nopenwork of girders through which lifts and staircases ascended. The\nupper surface was a uniform expanse, with portions--the starting\ncarriers--that could be raised and were then able to run on very slightly\ninclined rails to the end of the fabric.\n\nGraham went to the flying stages by the public ways. He was accompanied\nby Asano, his Japanese attendant. Lincoln was called away by Ostrog, who\nwas busy with his administrative concerns. A strong guard of the\nWind-Vane police awaited the Master outside the Wind-Vane offices, and\nthey cleared a space for him on the upper moving platform. His passage to\nthe flying stages was unexpected, nevertheless a considerable crowd\ngathered and followed him to his destination. As he went along, he could\nhear the people shouting his name, and saw numberless men and women and\nchildren in blue come swarming up the staircases in the central path,\ngesticulating and shouting. He could not hear what they shouted. He was\nstruck again by the evident existence of a vulgar dialect among the poor\nof the city. When at last he descended, his guards were immediately\nsurrounded by a dense excited crowd. Afterwards it occurred to him that\nsome had attempted to reach him with petitions. His guards cleared a\npassage for him with difficulty.\n\nHe found a monoplane in charge of an aeronaut awaiting him on the\nwestward stage. Seen close this mechanism was no longer small. As it lay\non its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage, its\naluminum body skeleton was as big as the hull of a twenty-ton yacht. Its\nlateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves almost like\nthe nerves of a bee's wing, and made of some sort of glassy artificial\nmembrane, cast their shadow over many hundreds of square yards. The\nchairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing by a complex\ntackle, within the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the\nmiddle. The passenger's chair was protected by a wind-guard and guarded\nabout with metallic rods carrying air cushions. It could, if desired, be\ncompletely closed in, but Graham was anxious for novel experiences, and\ndesired that it should be left open. The aeronaut sat behind a glass that\nsheltered his face. The passenger could secure himself firmly in his\nseat, and this was almost unavoidable on landing, or he could move along\nby means of a little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine,\nwhere his personal luggage, his wraps and restoratives were placed, and\nwhich also with the seats, served as a makeweight to the parts of the\ncentral engine that projected to the propeller at the stern.\n\nThe flying stage about him was empty save for Asano and their suite of\nattendants. Directed by the aeronaut he placed himself in his seat. Asano\nstepped through the bars of the hull, and stood below on the stage waving\nhis hand. He seemed to slide along the stage to the right and vanish.\n\nThe engine was humming loudly, the propeller spinning, and for a second\nthe stage and the buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally\npast Graham's eye; then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He\ngripped the little rods on either side of him instinctively. He felt\nhimself moving upward, heard the air whistle over the top of the wind\nscreen. The propeller screw moved round with powerful rhythmic\nimpulses--one, two, three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer\ncontrolled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibration that\ncontinued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away\nto starboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from\nthe face of the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking\nsideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw--a rapid\nfunicular railway might have given the same sensations. He recognised\nthe Council House and the Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight\ndown between his feet.\n\nFor a moment physical terror possessed him, a passionate sense of\ninsecurity. He held tight. For a second or so he could not lift his eyes.\nSome hundred feet or more sheer below him was one of the big wind-vanes\nof south-west London, and beyond it the southernmost flying stage crowded\nwith little black dots. These things seemed to be falling away from him.\nFor a second he had an impulse to pursue the earth. He set his teeth, he\nlifted his eyes by a muscular effort, and the moment of panic passed.\n\nHe remained for a space with his teeth set hard, his eyes staring into\nthe sky. Throb, throb, throb--beat, went the engine; throb, throb,\nthrob--beat. He gripped his bars tightly, glanced at the aeronaut, and\nsaw a smile upon his sun-tanned face. He smiled in return--perhaps a\nlittle artificially. \"A little strange at first,\" he shouted before he\nrecalled his dignity. But he dared not look down again for some time. He\nstared over the aeronaut's head to where a rim of vague blue horizon\ncrept up the sky. For a little while he could not banish the thought of\npossible accidents from his mind. Throb, throb, throb--beat; suppose some\ntrivial screw went wrong in that supporting engine! Suppose--! He made a\ngrim effort to dismiss all such suppositions. After a while they did at\nleast abandon the foreground of his thoughts. And up he went steadily,\nhigher and higher into the clear air.\n\nOnce the mental shock of moving unsupported through the air was over,\nhis sensations ceased to be unpleasant, became very speedily\npleasurable. He had been warned of air sickness. But he found the\npulsating movement of the monoplane as it drove up the faint south-west\nbreeze was very little in excess of the pitching of a boat head on to\nbroad rollers in a moderate gale, and he was constitutionally a good\nsailor. And the keenness of the more rarefied air into which they\nascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked up\nand saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came\ncautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white\nbirds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then\ngoing lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the\nWind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and\ngrowing smaller every moment. As his eye fell with more confidence now,\nthere came a blue line of hills, and then London, already to leeward, an\nintricate space of roofing. Its near edge came sharp and clear, and\nbanished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For the boundary\nof London was like a wall, like a cliff, a steep fall of three or four\nhundred feet, a frontage broken only by terraces here and there, a\ncomplex decorative fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThat gradual passage of town into country through an extensive sponge of\nsuburbs, which was so characteristic a feature of the great cities of the\nnineteenth century, existed no longer. Nothing remained of it here but a\nwaste of ruins, variegated and dense with thickets of the heterogeneous\ngrowths that had once adorned the gardens of the belt, interspersed among\nlevelled brown patches of sown ground, and verdant stretches of winter\ngreens. The latter even spread among the vestiges of houses. But for the\nmost part the reefs and skerries of ruins, the wreckage of suburban\nvillas, stood among their streets and roads, queer islands amidst the\nlevelled expanses of green and brown, abandoned indeed by the inhabitants\nyears since, but too substantial, it seemed, to be cleared out of the way\nof the wholesale horticultural mechanisms of the time.\n\nThe vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed amidst the countless\ncells of crumbling house walls, and broke along the foot of the city wall\nin a surf of bramble and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses. Here\nand there gaudy pleasure palaces towered amidst the puny remains of\nVictorian times, and cable ways slanted to them from the city. That\nwinter day they seemed deserted. Deserted, too, were the artificial\ngardens among the ruins. The city limits were indeed as sharply defined\nas in the ancient days when the gates were shut at nightfall and the\nrobber foeman prowled to the very walls. A huge semi-circular throat\npoured out a vigorous traffic upon the Eadhamite Bath Road. So the first\nprospect of the world beyond the city flashed on Graham, and dwindled.\nAnd when at last he could look vertically downward again, he saw below\nhim the vegetable fields of the Thames valley--innumerable minute oblongs\nof ruddy brown, intersected by shining threads, the sewage ditches.\n\nHis exhilaration increased rapidly, became a sort of intoxication. He\nfound himself drawing deep breaths of air, laughing aloud, desiring to\nshout. After a time that desire became too strong for him, and he\nshouted. They curved about towards the south. They drove with a slight\nlist to leeward, and with a slow alternation of movement, first a short,\nsharp ascent and then a long downward glide that was very swift and\npleasing. During these downward glides the propeller was inactive\naltogether. These ascents gave Graham a glorious sense of successful\neffort; the descents through the rarefied air were beyond all experience.\nHe wanted never to leave the upper air again.\n\nFor a time he was intent upon the landscape that ran swiftly northward\nbeneath him. Its minute, clear detail pleased him exceedingly. He was\nimpressed by the ruin of the houses that had once dotted the country, by\nthe vast treeless expanse of country from which all farms and villages\nhad gone, save for crumbling ruins. He had known the thing was so, but\nseeing it so was an altogether different matter. He tried to make out\nfamiliar places within the hollow basin of the world below, but at first\nhe could distinguish no data now that the Thames valley was left behind.\nSoon, however, they were driving over a sharp chalk hill that he\nrecognised as the Guildford Hog's Back, because of the familiar outline\nof the gorge at its eastward end, and because of the ruins of the town\nthat rose steeply on either lip of this gorge. And from that he made out\nother points, Leith Hill, the sandy wastes of Aldershot, and so forth.\nSave where the broad Eadhamite Portsmouth Road, thickly dotted with\nrushing shapes, followed the course of the old railway, the gorge of the\nwey was choked with thickets.\n\nThe whole expanse of the Downs escarpment, so far as the grey haze\npermitted him to see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of\nthe city was but a younger brother. They stirred with a stately motion\nbefore the south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted with\nthe sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and there a mounted\nshepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing under the stern of the\nmonoplane came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and\nLeith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving to rob\nthe downland whirlers of their share of breeze. The purple heather was\nspeckled with yellow gorse, and on the further side a drove of black oxen\nstampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept behind, and\ndwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks that were\nswallowed up in haze.\n\nAnd when these had vanished in the distance Graham heard a peewit\nwailing close at hand. He perceived he was now above the South Downs, and\nstaring over his shoulder saw the battlements of Portsmouth Landing Stage\ntowering over the ridge of Portsdown Hill. In another moment there came\ninto sight a spread of shipping like floating cities, the little white\ncliffs of the Needles dwarfed and sunlit, and the grey and glittering\nwaters of the narrow sea. They seemed to leap the Solent in a moment, and\nin a few seconds the Isle of Wight was running past, and then beneath him\nspread a wider and wider extent of sea, here purple with the shadow of a\ncloud, here grey, here a burnished mirror, and here a spread of cloudy\ngreenish blue. The Isle of Wight grew smaller and smaller. In a few more\nminutes a strip of grey haze detached itself from other strips that were\nclouds, descended out of the sky and became a coast-line--sunlit and\npleasant--the coast of northern France. It rose, it took colour, became\ndefinite and detailed, and the counterpart of the Downland of England was\nspeeding by below.\n\nIn a little time, as it seemed, Paris came above the horizon, and hung\nthere for a space, and sank out of sight again as the monoplane circled\nabout to the north. But he perceived the Eiffel Tower still standing, and\nbeside it a huge dome surmounted by a pin-point Colossus. And he\nperceived, too, though he did not understand it at the time, a slanting\ndrift of smoke. The aeronaut said something about \"trouble in the\nunder-ways,\" that Graham did not heed. But he marked the minarets and\ntowers and slender masses that streamed skyward above the city\nwind-vanes, and knew that in the matter of grace at least Paris still\nkept in front of her larger rival. And even as he looked a pale blue\nshape ascended very swiftly from the city like a dead leaf driving up\nbefore a gale. It curved round and soared towards them, growing rapidly\nlarger and larger. The aeronaut was saying something. \"What?\" said\nGraham, loth to take his eyes from this. \"London aeroplane, Sire,\" bawled\nthe aeronaut, pointing.\n\nThey rose and curved about northward as it drew nearer. Nearer it came\nand nearer, larger and larger. The throb, throb, throb--beat, of the\nmonoplane's flight, that had seemed so potent, and so swift, suddenly\nappeared slow by comparison with this tremendous rush. How great the\nmonster seemed, how swift and steady! It passed quite closely beneath\nthem, driving along silently, a vast spread of wire-netted translucent\nwings, a thing alive. Graham had a momentary glimpse of the rows and rows\nof wrapped-up passengers, slung in their little cradles behind\nwind-screens, of a white-clothed engineer crawling against the gale along\na ladder way, of spouting engines beating together, of the whirling wind\nscrew, and of a wide waste of wing. He exulted in the sight. And in an\ninstant the thing had passed.\n\nIt rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the rush of its\nflight. It fell and grew smaller. Scarcely had they moved, as it seemed,\nbefore it was again only a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky. This\nwas the aeroplane that went to and fro between London and Paris. In fair\nweather and in peaceful times it came and went four times a day.\n\nThey beat across the Channel, slowly as it seemed now to Graham's\nenlarged ideas, and Beachy Head rose greyly to the left of them.\n\n\"Land,\" called the aeronaut, his voice small against the whistling of\nthe air over the wind-screen.\n\n\"Not yet,\" bawled Graham, laughing. \"Not land yet. I want to learn more\nof this machine.\"\n\n\"I meant--\" said the aeronaut.\n\n\"I want to learn more of this machine,\" repeated Graham.\n\n\"I'm coming to you,\" he said, and had flung himself free of his chair and\ntaken a step along the guarded rail between them. He stopped for a\nmoment, and his colour changed and his hands tightened. Another step and\nhe was clinging close to the aeronaut. He felt a weight on his shoulder,\nthe pressure of the air. His hat was a whirling speck behind. The wind\ncame in gusts over his wind-screen and blew his hair in streamers past\nhis cheek. The aeronaut made some hasty adjustments for the shifting of\nthe centres of gravity and pressure.\n\n\"I want to have these things explained,\" said Graham. \"What do you do\nwhen you move that engine forward?\"\n\nThe aeronaut hesitated. Then he answered, \"They are complex, Sire.\"\n\n\"I don't mind,\" shouted Graham. \"I don't mind.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause. \"Aeronautics is the secret--the privilege--\"\n\n\"I know. But I'm the Master, and I mean to know.\" He laughed, full of\nthis novel realisation of power that was his gift from the upper air.\n\nThe monoplane curved about, and the keen fresh wind cut across Graham's\nface and his garment lugged at his body as the stem pointed round to the\nwest. The two men looked into each other's eyes.\n\n\"Sire, there are rules--\"\n\n\"Not where I am concerned,\" said Graham, \"You seem to forget.\"\n\nThe aeronaut scrutinised his face \"No,\" he said. \"I do not forget, Sire.\nBut in all the earth--no man who is not a sworn aeronaut--has ever a\nchance. They come as passengers--\"\n\n\"I have heard something of the sort. But I'm not going to argue these\npoints. Do you know why I have slept two hundred years? To fly!\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the aeronaut, \"the rules--if I break the rules--\"\n\nGraham waved the penalties aside.\n\n\"Then if you will watch me--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Graham, swaying and gripping tight as the machine lifted its\nnose again for an ascent. \"That's not my game. I want to do it myself.\nDo it myself if I smash for it! No! I will. See I am going to clamber by\nthis--to come and share your seat. Steady! I mean to fly of my own\naccord if I smash at the end of it. I will have something to pay for my\nsleep. Of all other things--. In my past it was my dream to fly.\nNow--keep your balance.\"\n\n\"A dozen spies are watching me, Sire!\"\n\nGraham's temper was at end. Perhaps he chose it should be. He swore.\nHe swung himself round the intervening mass of levers and the\nmonoplane swayed.\n\n\"Am I Master of the earth?\" he said. \"Or is your Society? Now. Take your\nhands off those levers, and hold my wrists. Yes--so. And now, how do we\nturn her nose down to the glide?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said the aeronaut.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You will protect me?\"\n\n\"Lord! Yes! If I have to burn London. Now!\"\n\nAnd with that promise Graham bought his first lesson in aerial\nnavigation. \"It's clearly to your advantage, this journey,\" he said with\na loud laugh--for the air was like strong wine--\"to teach me quickly and\nwell. Do I pull this? Ah! So! Hullo!\"\n\n\"Back, Sire! Back!\"\n\n\"Back--right. One--two--three--good God! Ah! Up she goes! But this\nis living!\"\n\nAnd now the machine began to dance the strangest figures in the air. Now\nit would sweep round a spiral of scarcely a hundred yards diameter, now\nrush up into the air and swoop down again, steeply, swiftly, falling like\na hawk, to recover in a rushing loop that swept it high again. In one of\nthese descents it seemed driving straight at the drifting park of\nballoons in the southeast, and only curved about and cleared them by a\nsudden recovery of dexterity. The extraordinary swiftness and smoothness\nof the motion, the extraordinary effect of the rarefied air upon his\nconstitution, threw Graham into a careless fury.\n\nBut at last a queer incident came to sober him, to send him flying down\nonce more to the crowded life below with all its dark insoluble riddles.\nAs he swooped, came a tap and something flying past, and a drop like a\ndrop of rain. Then as he went on down he saw something like a white rag\nwhirling down in his wake. \"What was that?\" he asked. \"I did not see.\"\n\nThe aeronaut glanced, and then clutched at the lever to recover, for they\nwere sweeping down. When the monoplane was rising again he drew a deep\nbreath and replied, \"That,\" and he indicated the white thing still\nfluttering down, \"was a swan.\"\n\n\"I never saw it,\" said Graham.\n\nThe aeronaut made no answer, and Graham saw little drops upon his\nforehead.\n\nThey drove horizontally while Graham clambered back to the passenger's\nplace out of the lash of the wind. And then came a swift rush down, with\nthe wind-screw whirling to check their fall, and the flying stage growing\nbroad and dark before them. The sun, sinking over the chalk hills in the\nwest, fell with them, and left the sky a blaze of gold.\n\nSoon men could be seen as little specks. He heard a noise coming up to\nmeet him, a noise like the sound of waves upon a pebbly beach, and saw\nthat the roofs about the flying stage were dense with his people\nrejoicing over his safe return. A black mass was crushed together under\nthe stage, a darkness stippled with innumerable faces, and quivering with\nthe minute oscillation of waved white handkerchiefs and waving hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHREE DAYS\n\n\nLincoln awaited Graham in an apartment beneath the flying stages. He\nseemed curious to learn all that had happened, pleased to hear of the\nextraordinary delight and interest which Graham took in flying. Graham\nwas in a mood of enthusiasm. \"I must learn to fly,\" he cried. \"I must\nmaster that. I pity all poor souls who have died without this\nopportunity. The sweet swift air! It is the most wonderful experience in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"You will find our new times full of wonderful experiences,\" said\nLincoln. \"I do not know what you will care to do now. We have music that\nmay seem novel.\"\n\n\"For the present,\" said Graham, \"flying holds me. Let me learn more of\nthat. Your aeronaut was saying there is some trades union objection to\none's learning.\"\n\n\"There is, I believe,\" said Lincoln. \"But for you--! If you would like to\noccupy yourself with that, we can make you a sworn aeronaut to-morrow.\"\n\nGraham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his sensations for\na while. \"And as for affairs,\" he asked abruptly. \"How are things\ngoing on?\"\n\nLincoln waved affairs aside. \"Ostrog will tell you that to-morrow,\"\nhe said. \"Everything is settling down. The Revolution accomplishes\nitself all over the world. Friction is inevitable here and there, of\ncourse; but your rule is assured. You may rest secure with things in\nOstrog's hands.\"\n\n\"Would it be possible for me to be made a sworn aeronaut, as you call it,\nforthwith--before I sleep?\" said Graham, pacing. \"Then I could be at it\nthe very first thing to-morrow again....\"\n\n\"It would be possible,\" said Lincoln thoughtfully. \"Quite possible.\nIndeed, it shall be done.\" He laughed. \"I came prepared to suggest\namusements, but you have found one for yourself. I will telephone to the\naeronautical offices from here and we will return to your apartments in\nthe Wind-Vane Control. By the time you have dined the aeronauts will be\nable to come. You don't think that after you have dined you might\nprefer--?\" He paused.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham.\n\n\"We had prepared a show of dancers--they have been brought from the\nCapri theatre.\"\n\n\"I hate ballets,\" said Graham, shortly. \"Always did. That other--. That's\nnot what I want to see. We had dancers in the old days. For the matter of\nthat, they had them in ancient Egypt. But flying--\"\n\n\"True,\" said Lincoln. \"Though our dancers--\"\n\n\"They can afford to wait,\" said Graham; \"they can afford to wait. I know.\nI'm not a Latin. There's questions I want to ask some expert--about your\nmachinery. I'm keen. I want no distractions.\"\n\n\"You have the world to choose from,\" said Lincoln; \"whatever you want\nis yours.\"\n\nAsano appeared, and under the escort of a strong guard they returned\nthrough the city streets to Graham's apartments. Far larger crowds had\nassembled to witness his return than his departure had gathered, and\nthe shouts and cheering of these masses of people sometimes drowned\nLincoln's answers to the endless questions Graham's aerial journey had\nsuggested. At first Graham had acknowledged the cheering and cries of\nthe crowd by bows and gestures, but Lincoln warned him that such a\nrecognition would be considered incorrect behaviour. Graham, already a\nlittle wearied by rhythmic civilities, ignored his subjects for the\nremainder of his public progress.\n\nDirectly they arrived at his apartments Asano departed in search of\nkinematographic renderings of machinery in motion, and Lincoln despatched\nGraham's commands for models of machines and small machines to illustrate\nthe various mechanical advances of the last two centuries. The little\ngroup of appliances for telegraphic communication attracted the Master so\nstrongly that his delightfully prepared dinner, served by a number of\ncharmingly dexterous girls, waited for a space. The habit of smoking had\nalmost ceased from the face of the earth, but when he expressed a wish\nfor that indulgence, enquiries were made and some excellent cigars were\ndiscovered in Florida, and sent to him by pneumatic despatch while the\ndinner was still in progress. Afterwards came the aeronauts, and a feast\nof ingenious wonders in the hands of a latter-day engineer. For the time,\nat any rate, the neat dexterity of counting and numbering machines,\nbuilding machines, spinning engines, patent doorways, explosive motors,\ngrain and water elevators, slaughter-house machines and harvesting\nappliances, was more fascinating to Graham than any bayad\u00e8re. \"We were\nsavages,\" was his refrain, \"we were savages. We were in the stone\nage--compared with this.... And what else have you?\"\n\nThere came also practical psychologists with some very interesting\ndevelopments in the art of hypnotism. The names of Milne Bramwell,\nFechner, Liebault, William James, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore a\nvalue now that would have astonished their contemporaries. Several\npractical applications of psychology were now in general use; it had\nlargely superseded drugs, antiseptics and anesthetics in medicine; was\nemployed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration. A real\nenlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in this\ndirection. The feats of \"calculating boys,\" the wonders, as Graham had\nbeen wont to regard them, of mesmerisers, were now within the range of\nanyone who could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long ago\nthe old examination methods in education had been destroyed by these\nexpedients. Instead of years of study, candidates had substituted a few\nweeks of trances, and during the trances expert coaches had simply to\nrepeat all the points necessary for adequate answering, adding a\nsuggestion of the post-hypnotic recollection of these points. In process\nmathematics particularly, this aid had been of singular service, and it\nwas now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manual\ndexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations conducted\nunder finite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort that is, were now\nsystematically relieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion,\nand brought to an unexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of the\nlabouring classes, so soon as they were of sufficient age to be\nhypnotised, were thus converted into beautifully punctual and\ntrustworthy machine minders, and released forthwith from the long, long\nthoughts of youth. Aeronautical pupils, who gave way to giddiness,\ncould be relieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street were\nhypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind. If anyone\ndesired to remember a name, a series of numbers, a song or a speech, it\ncould be done by this method, and conversely memories could be effaced,\nhabits removed, and desires eradicated--a sort of psychic surgery was,\nin fact, in general use. Indignities, humbling experiences, were thus\nforgotten, widows would obliterate their previous husbands, angry lovers\nrelease themselves from their slavery. To graft desires, however, was\nstill impossible, and the facts of thought transference were yet\nunsystematised. The psychologists illustrated their expositions with\nsome astounding experiments in mnemonics made through the agency of a\ntroupe of pale-faced children in blue.\n\nGraham, like most of the people of his former time, distrusted the\nhypnotist, or he might then and there have eased his mind of many painful\npreoccupations. But in spite of Lincoln's assurances he held to the old\ntheory that to be hypnotised was in some way the surrender of his\npersonality, the abdication of his will. At the banquet of wonderful\nexperiences that was beginning, he wanted very keenly to remain\nabsolutely himself.\n\nThe next day, and another day, and yet another day passed in such\ninterests as these. Each day Graham spent many hours in the glorious\nentertainment of flying. On the third, he soared across middle France,\nand within sight of the snow-clad Alps. These vigorous exercises gave him\nrestful sleep; he recovered almost wholly from the spiritless anemia of\nhis first awakening. And whenever he was not in the air, and awake,\nLincoln was assiduous in the cause of his amusement; all that was novel\nand curious in contemporary invention was brought to him, until at last\nhis appetite for novelty was well-nigh glutted. One might fill a dozen\ninconsecutive volumes with the strange things they exhibited. Each\nafternoon he held his court for an hour or so. He found his interest in\nhis contemporaries becoming personal and intimate. At first he had been\nalert chiefly for unfamiliarity and peculiarity; any foppishness in their\ndress, any discordance with his preconceptions of nobility in their\nstatus and manners had jarred upon him, and it was remarkable to him how\nsoon that strangeness and the faint hostility that arose from it,\ndisappeared; how soon he came to appreciate the true perspective of his\nposition, and see the old Victorian days remote and quaint. He found\nhimself particularly amused by the red-haired daughter of the Manager of\nthe European Piggeries. On the second day after dinner he made the\nacquaintance of a latter-day dancing girl, and found her an astonishing\nartist. And after that, more hypnotic wonders. On the third day Lincoln\nwas moved to suggest that the Master should repair to a Pleasure City,\nbut this Graham declined, nor would he accept the services of the\nhypnotists in his aeronautical experiments. The link of locality held him\nto London; he found a delight in topographical identifications that he\nwould have missed abroad. \"Here--or a hundred feet below here,\" he could\nsay, \"I used to eat my midday cutlets during my London University days.\nUnderneath here was Waterloo and the tiresome hunt for confusing trains.\nOften have I stood waiting down there, bag in hand, and stared up into\nthe sky above the forest of signals, little thinking I should walk some\nday a hundred yards in the air. And now in that very sky that was once a\ngrey smoke canopy, I circle in a monoplane.\"\n\nDuring those three days Graham was so occupied with these distractions\nthat the vast political movements in progress outside his quarters had\nbut a small share of his attention. Those about him told him little.\nDaily came Ostrog, the Boss, his Grand Vizier, his mayor of the palace,\nto report in vague terms the steady establishment of his rule; \"a little\ntrouble\" soon to be settled in this city, \"a slight disturbance\" in that.\nThe song of the social revolt came to him no more; he never learned that\nit had been forbidden in the municipal limits; and all the great emotions\nof the crow's nest slumbered in his mind.\n\nBut on the second and third of the three days he found himself, in spite\nof his interest in the daughter of the Pig Manager, or it may be by\nreason of the thoughts her conversation suggested, remembering the girl\nHelen Wotton, who had spoken to him so oddly at the Wind-Vane Keeper's\ngathering. The impression, she had made was a deep one, albeit the\nincessant surprise of novel circumstances had kept him from brooding upon\nit for a space. But now her memory was coming to its own. He wondered\nwhat she had meant by those broken half-forgotten sentences; the picture\nof her eyes and the earnest passion of her face became more vivid as his\nmechanical interests faded. Her slender beauty came compellingly between\nhim and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion. But he did not\nsee her again until three full days were past.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGRAHAM REMEMBERS\n\n\nShe came upon him at last in a little gallery that ran from the Wind-Vane\nOffices toward his state apartments. The gallery was long and narrow,\nwith a series of recesses, each with an arched fenestration that looked\nupon a court of palms. He came upon her suddenly in one of these\nrecesses. She was seated. She turned her head at the sound of his\nfootsteps and started at the sight of him. Every touch of colour vanished\nfrom her face. She rose instantly, made a step toward him as if to\naddress him, and hesitated. He stopped and stood still, expectant. Then\nhe perceived that a nervous tumult silenced her, perceived, too, that she\nmust have sought speech with him to be waiting for him in this place.\n\nHe felt a regal impulse to assist her. \"I have wanted to see you,\" he\nsaid. \"A few days ago you wanted to tell me something--you wanted to tell\nme of the people. What was it you had to tell me?\"\n\nShe looked at him with troubled eyes.\n\n\"You said the people were unhappy?\"\n\nFor a moment she was silent still.\n\n\"It must have seemed strange to you,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"It did. And yet--\"\n\n\"It was an impulse.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a face of hesitation. She spoke with an effort.\n\"You forget,\" she said, drawing a deep breath.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The people--\"\n\n\"Do you mean--?\"\n\n\"You forget the people.\"\n\nHe looked interrogative.\n\n\"Yes. I know you are surprised. For you do not understand what you are.\nYou do not know the things that are happening.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You do not understand.\"\n\n\"Not clearly, perhaps. But--tell me.\"\n\nShe turned to him with sudden resolution. \"It is so hard to explain. I\nhave meant to, I have wanted to. And now--I cannot. I am not ready with\nwords. But about you--there is something. It is wonder. Your sleep--your\nawakening. These things are miracles. To me at least--and to all the\ncommon people. You who lived and suffered and died, you who were a\ncommon citizen, wake again, live again, to find yourself Master almost\nof the earth.\"\n\n\"Master of the earth,\" he said. \"So they tell me. But try and imagine how\nlittle I know of it.\"\n\n\"Cities--Trusts--the Labour Department--\"\n\n\"Principalities, powers, dominions--the power and the glory. Yes, I have\nheard them shout. I know. I am Master. King, if you wish. With Ostrog,\nthe Boss--\"\n\nHe paused.\n\nShe turned upon him and surveyed his face with a curious scrutiny.\n\"Well?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"To take the responsibility.\"\n\n\"That is what we have begun to fear.\" For a moment she said no more.\n\"No,\" she said slowly. \"_You_ will take the responsibility. You will take\nthe responsibility. The people look to you.\"\n\nShe spoke softly. \"Listen! For at least half the years of your sleep--in\nevery generation--multitudes of people, in every generation greater\nmultitudes of people, have prayed that you might awake--_prayed_.\"\n\nGraham moved to speak and did not.\n\nShe hesitated, and a faint colour crept back to her cheek. \"Do you know\nthat you have been to myriads--King Arthur, Barbarossa--the King who\nwould come in his own good time and put the world right for them?\"\n\n\"I suppose the imagination of the people--\"\n\n\"Have you not heard our proverb, 'When the Sleeper wakes'? While you lay\ninsensible and motionless there--thousands came. Thousands. Every first\nof the month you lay in state with a white robe upon you and the people\nfiled by you. When I was a little girl I saw you like that, with your\nface white and calm.\"\n\nShe turned her face from him and looked steadfastly at the painted\nwall before her. Her voice fell. \"When I was a little girl I used to\nlook at your face.... It seemed to me fixed and waiting, like the\npatience of God.\"\n\n\"That is what we thought of you,\" she said. \"That is how you\nseemed to us.\"\n\nShe turned shining eyes to him, her voice was clear and strong. \"In the\ncity, in the earth, a myriad myriad men and women are waiting to see what\nyou will do, full of strange incredible expectations.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Ostrog--no one--can take that responsibility.\"\n\nGraham looked at her in surprise, at her face lit with emotion. She\nseemed at first to have spoken with an effort, and to have fired herself\nby speaking.\n\n\"Do you think,\" she said, \"that you who have lived that little life so\nfar away in the past, you who have fallen into and risen out of this\nmiracle of sleep--do you think that the wonder and reverence and hope of\nhalf the world has gathered about you only that you may live another\nlittle life?... That you may shift the responsibility to any other man?\"\n\n\"I know how great this kingship of mine is,\" he said haltingly. \"I know\nhow great it seems. But is it real? It is incredible--dreamlike. Is it\nreal, or is it only a great delusion?\"\n\n\"It is real,\" she said; \"if you dare.\"\n\n\"After all, like all kingship, my kingship is Belief. It is an illusion\nin the minds of men.\"\n\n\"If you dare!\" she said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Countless men,\" she said, \"and while it is in their minds--they\nwill obey.\"\n\n\"But I know nothing. That is what I had in mind. I know nothing. And\nthese others--the Councillors, Ostrog. They are wiser, cooler, they know\nso much, every detail. And, indeed, what are these miseries of which you\nspeak? What am I to know? Do you mean--\"\n\nHe stopped blankly.\n\n\"I am still hardly more than a girl,\" she said. \"But to me the world\nseems full of wretchedness. The world has altered since your day, altered\nvery strangely. I have prayed that I might see you and tell you these\nthings. The world has changed. As if a canker had seized it--and robbed\nlife of--everything worth having.\"\n\nShe turned a flushed face upon him, moving suddenly. \"Your days were the\ndays of freedom. Yes--I have thought. I have been made to think, for my\nlife--has not been happy. Men are no longer free--no greater, no better\nthan the men of your time. That is not all. This city--is a prison. Every\ncity now is a prison. Mammon grips the key in his hand. Myriads,\ncountless myriads, toil from the cradle to the grave. Is that right? Is\nthat to be--for ever? Yes, far worse than in your time. All about us,\nbeneath us, sorrow and pain. All the shallow delight of such life as you\nfind about you, is separated by just a little from a life of wretchedness\nbeyond any telling. Yes, the poor know it--they know they suffer. These\ncountless multitudes who faced death for you two nights since--! You owe\nyour life to them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Graham, slowly. \"Yes. I owe my life to them.\"\n\n\"You come,\" she said, \"from the days when this new tyranny of the cities\nwas scarcely beginning. It is a tyranny--a tyranny. In your days the\nfeudal war lords had gone, and the new lordship of wealth had still to\ncome. Half the men in the world still lived out upon the free\ncountryside. The cities had still to devour them. I have heard the\nstories out of the old books--there was nobility! Common men led lives of\nlove and faithfulness then--they did a thousand things. And you--you come\nfrom that time.\"\n\n\"It was not--. But never mind. How is it now--?\"\n\n\"Gain and the Pleasure Cities! Or slavery--unthanked, unhonoured,\nslavery.\"\n\n\"Slavery!\" he said.\n\n\"Slavery.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that human beings are chattels.\"\n\n\"Worse. That is what I want you to know, what I want you to see. I know\nyou do not know. They will keep things from you, they will take you\npresently to a Pleasure City. But you have noticed men and women and\nchildren in pale blue canvas, with thin yellow faces and dull eyes?\"\n\n\"Everywhere.\"\n\n\"Speaking a horrible dialect, coarse and weak.\"\n\n\"I have heard it.\"\n\n\"They are the slaves--your slaves. They are the slaves of the Labour\nDepartment you own.\"\n\n\"The Labour Department! In some way--that is familiar. Ah! now I\nremember. I saw it when I was wandering about the city, after the\nlights returned, great fronts of buildings coloured pale blue. Do you\nreally mean--?\"\n\n\"Yes. How can I explain it to you? Of course the blue uniform struck you.\nNearly a third of our people wear it--more assume it now every day. This\nLabour Department has grown imperceptibly.\"\n\n\"What _is_ this Labour Department?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"In the old times, how did you manage with starving people?\"\n\n\"There was the workhouse--which the parishes maintained.\"\n\n\"Workhouse! Yes--there was something. In our history lessons. I remember\nnow. The Labour Department ousted the workhouse. It grew--partly--out of\nsomething--you, perhaps, may remember it--an emotional religious\norganisation called the Salvation Army--that became a business company.\nIn the first place it was almost a charity. To save people from workhouse\nrigours. There had been a great agitation against the workhouse. Now I\ncome to think of it, it was one of the earliest properties your Trustees\nacquired. They bought the Salvation Army and reconstructed it as this.\nThe idea in the first place was to organise the labour of starving\nhomeless people.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Nowadays there are no workhouses, no refuges and charities, nothing but\nthat Department. Its offices are everywhere. That blue is its colour. And\nany man, woman or child who comes to be hungry and weary and with neither\nhome nor friend nor resort, must go to the Department in the end--or seek\nsome way of death. The Euthanasy is beyond their means--for the poor\nthere is no easy death. And at any hour in the day or night there is\nfood, shelter and a blue uniform for all comers--that is the first\ncondition of the Department's incorporation--and in return for a day's\nshelter the Department extracts a day's work, and then returns the\nvisitor's proper clothing and sends him or her out again.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you. In your time men starved\nin your streets. That was bad. But they died--_men_. These people in\nblue--. The proverb runs: 'Blue canvas once and ever.' The Department\ntrades in their labour, and it has taken care to assure itself of the\nsupply. People come to it starving and helpless--they eat and sleep for a\nnight and day, they work for a day, and at the end of the day they go\nout again. If they have worked well they have a penny or so--enough for a\ntheatre or a cheap dancing place, or a kinematograph story, or a dinner\nor a bet. They wander about after that is spent. Begging is prevented by\nthe police of the ways. Besides, no one gives. They come back again the\nnext day or the day after--brought back by the same incapacity that\nbrought them first. At last their proper clothing wears out, or their\nrags get so shabby that they are ashamed. Then they must work for months\nto get fresh. If they want fresh. A great number of children are born\nunder the Department's care. The mother owes them a month thereafter--the\nchildren they cherish and educate until they are fourteen, and they pay\ntwo years' service. You may be sure these children are educated for the\nblue canvas. And so it is the Department works.\"\n\n\"And none are destitute in the city?\"\n\n\"None. They are either in blue canvas or in prison. We have abolished\ndestitution. It is engraved upon the Department's checks.\"\n\n\"If they will not work?\"\n\n\"Most people will work at that pitch, and the Department has powers.\nThere are stages of unpleasantness in the work--stoppage of food--and a\nman or woman who has refused to work once is known by a thumb-marking\nsystem in the Department's offices all over the world. Besides, who can\nleave the city poor? To go to Paris costs two Lions. And for\ninsubordination there are the prisons--dark and miserable--out of sight\nbelow. There are prisons now for many things.\"\n\n\"And a third of the people wear this blue canvas?\"\n\n\"More than a third. Toilers, living without pride or delight or hope,\nwith the stories of Pleasure Cities ringing in their ears, mocking their\nshameful lives, their privations and hardships. Too poor even for the\nEuthanasy, the rich man's refuge from life. Dumb, crippled millions,\ncountless millions, all the world about, ignorant of anything but\nlimitations and unsatisfied desires. They are born, they are thwarted and\nthey die. That is the state to which we have come.\"\n\nFor a space Graham sat downcast.\n\n\"But there has been a revolution,\" he said. \"All these things will be\nchanged. Ostrog--\"\n\n\"That is our hope. That is the hope of the world. But Ostrog will not do\nit. He is a politician. To him it seems things must be like this. He\ndoes not mind. He takes it for granted. All the rich, all the\ninfluential, all who are happy, come at last to take these miseries for\ngranted. They use the people in their politics, they live in ease by\ntheir degradation. But you--you who come from a happier age--it is to\nyou the people look. To you.\"\n\nHe looked at her face. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears. He felt\na rush of emotion. For a moment he forgot this city, he forgot the\nrace, and all those vague remote voices, in the immediate humanity of\nher beauty.\n\n\"But what am I to do?\" he said with his eyes upon her.\n\n\"Rule,\" she answered, bending towards him and speaking in a low tone.\n\"Rule the world as it has never been ruled, for the good and happiness of\nmen. For you might rule it--you could rule it.\n\n\"The people are stirring. All over the world the people are stirring. It\nwants but a word--but a word from you--to bring them all together. Even\nthe middle sort of people are restless--unhappy.\n\n\"They are not telling you the things that are happening. The people will\nnot go back to their drudgery--they refuse to be disarmed. Ostrog has\nawakened something greater than he dreamt of--he has awakened hopes.\"\n\nHis heart was beating fast. He tried to seem judicial, to weigh\nconsiderations.\n\n\"They only want their leader,\" she said.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"You could do what you would;--the world is yours.\"\n\nHe sat, no longer regarding her. Presently he spoke. \"The old dreams, and\nthe thing I have dreamt, liberty, happiness. Are they dreams? Could one\nman--_one man_--?\" His voice sank and ceased.\n\n\"Not one man, but all men--give them only a leader to speak the desire of\ntheir hearts.\"\n\nHe shook his head, and for a time there was silence.\n\nHe looked up suddenly, and their eyes met. \"I have not your faith,\" he\nsaid, \"I have not your youth. I am here with power that mocks me. No--let\nme speak. I want to do--not right--I have not the strength for that--but\nsomething rather right than wrong. It will bring no millennium, but I am\nresolved now, that I will rule. What you have said has awakened me... You\nare right. Ostrog must know his place. And I will learn--.... One thing I\npromise you. This Labour slavery shall end.\"\n\n\"And you will rule?\"\n\n\"Yes. Provided--. There is one thing.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"That you will help me.\"\n\n\"_I_--a girl!\"\n\n\"Yes. Does it not occur to you I am absolutely alone?\"\n\nShe started and for an instant her eyes had pity. \"Need you ask whether I\nwill help you?\" she said.\n\nThere came a tense silence, and then the beating of a clock striking the\nhour. Graham rose.\n\n\"Even now,\" he said, \"Ostrog will be waiting.\" He hesitated, facing her.\n\"When I have asked him certain questions--. There is much I do not know.\nIt may be, that I will go to see with my own eyes the things of which you\nhave spoken. And when I return--?\"\n\n\"I shall know of your going and coming. I will wait for you here again.\"\n\nThey regarded one another steadfastly, questioningly, and then he turned\nfrom her towards the Wind-Vane office.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOSTROG'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\nGraham found Ostrog waiting to give a formal account of his day's\nstewardship. On previous occasions he had passed over this ceremony as\nspeedily as possible, in order to resume his aerial experiences, but now\nhe began to ask quick short questions. He was very anxious to take up his\nempire forthwith. Ostrog brought flattering reports of the development of\naffairs abroad. In Paris and Berlin, Graham perceived that he was saying,\nthere had been trouble, not organised resistance indeed, but\ninsubordinate proceedings. \"After all these years,\" said Ostrog, when\nGraham pressed enquiries; \"the Commune has lifted its head again. That is\nthe real nature of the struggle, to be explicit.\" But order had been\nrestored in these cities. Graham, the more deliberately judicial for the\nstirring emotions he felt, asked if there had been any fighting. \"A\nlittle,\" said Ostrog. \"In one quarter only. But the Senegalese division\nof our African agricultural police--the Consolidated African Companies\nhave a very well drilled police--was ready, and so were the aeroplanes.\nWe expected a little trouble in the continental cities, and in America.\nBut things are very quiet in America. They are satisfied with the\noverthrow of the Council. For the time.\"\n\n\"Why should you expect trouble?\" asked Graham abruptly.\n\n\"There is a lot of discontent--social discontent.\"\n\n\"The Labour Department?\"\n\n\"You are learning,\" said Ostrog with a touch of surprise. \"Yes. It is\nchiefly the discontent with the Labour Department. It was that discontent\nsupplied the motive force of this overthrow--that and your awakening.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nOstrog smiled. He became explicit. \"We had to stir up their discontent,\nwe had to revive the old ideals of universal happiness--all men\nequal--all men happy--no luxury that everyone may not share--ideas that\nhave slumbered for two hundred years. You know that? We had to revive\nthese ideals, impossible as they are--in order to overthrow the Council.\nAnd now--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Our revolution is accomplished, and the Council is overthrown, and\npeople whom we have stirred up--remain surging. There was scarcely enough\nfighting.... We made promises, of course. It is extraordinary how\nviolently and rapidly this vague out-of-date humanitarianism has revived\nand spread. We who sowed the seed even, have been astonished. In Paris,\nas I say--we have had to call in a little external help.\"\n\n\"And here?\"\n\n\"There is trouble. Multitudes will not go back to work. There is a\ngeneral strike. Half the factories are empty and the people are swarming\nin the ways. They are talking of a Commune. Men in silk and satin have\nbeen insulted in the streets. The blue canvas is expecting all sorts of\nthings from you.... Of course there is no need for you to trouble. We are\nsetting the Babble Machines to work with counter suggestions in the\ncause of law and order. We must keep the grip tight; that is all.\"\n\nGraham thought. He perceived a way of asserting himself. But he spoke\nwith restraint.\n\n\"Even to the pitch of bringing a negro police,\" he said.\n\n\"They are useful,\" said Ostrog. \"They are fine loyal brutes, with no wash\nof ideas in their heads--such as our rabble has. The Council should have\nhad them as police of the ways, and things might have been different. Of\ncourse, there is nothing to fear except rioting and wreckage. You can\nmanage your own wings now, and you can soar away to Capri if there is any\nsmoke or fuss. We have the pull of all the great things; the aeronauts\nare privileged and rich, the closest trades union in the world, and so\nare the engineers of the wind-vanes. We have the air, and the mastery of\nthe air is the mastery of the earth. No one of any ability is organising\nagainst us. They have no leaders--only the sectional leaders of the\nsecret society we organised before your very opportune awakening. Mere\nbusybodies and sentimentalists they are and bitterly jealous of each\nother. None of them is man enough for a central figure. The only trouble\nwill be a disorganised upheaval. To be frank--that may happen. But it\nwon't interrupt your aeronautics. The days when the People could make\nrevolutions are past.\"\n\n\"I suppose they are,\" said Graham. \"I suppose they are.\" He mused. \"This\nworld of yours has been full of surprises to me. In the old days we\ndreamt of a wonderful democratic life, of a time when all men would be\nequal and happy.\"\n\nOstrog looked at him steadfastly. \"The day of democracy is past,\" he\nsaid. \"Past for ever. That day began with the bowmen of Cre\u00e7y, it ended\nwhen marching infantry, when common men in masses ceased to win the\nbattles of the world, when costly cannon, great ironclads, and strategic\nrailways became the means of power. To-day is the day of wealth. Wealth\nnow is power as it never was power before--it commands earth and sea and\nsky. All power is for those who can handle wealth. On your behalf.... You\nmust accept facts, and these are facts. The world for the Crowd! The\nCrowd as Ruler! Even in your days that creed had been tried and\ncondemned. To-day it has only one believer--a multiplex, silly one--the\nman in the Crowd.\"\n\nGraham did not answer immediately. He stood lost in sombre\npreoccupations.\n\n\"No,\" said Ostrog. \"The day of the common man is past. On the open\ncountryside one man is as good as another, or nearly as good. The earlier\naristocracy had a precarious tenure of strength and audacity. They were\ntempered--tempered. There were insurrections, duels, riots. The first\nreal aristocracy, the first permanent aristocracy, came in with castles\nand armour, and vanished before the musket and bow. But this is the\nsecond aristocracy. The real one. Those days of gunpowder and democracy\nwere only an eddy in the stream. The common man now is a helpless unit.\nIn these days we have this great machine of the city, and an organisation\ncomplex beyond his understanding.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" said Graham, \"there is something resists, something you are\nholding down--something that stirs and presses.\"\n\n\"You will see,\" said Ostrog, with a forced smile that would brush these\ndifficult questions aside. \"I have not roused the force to destroy\nmyself--trust me.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham.\n\nOstrog stared.\n\n\"_Must_ the world go this way?\" said Graham with his emotions at the\nspeaking point. \"Must it indeed go in this way? Have all our hopes\nbeen vain?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Ostrog. \"Hopes?\"\n\n\"I come from a democratic age. And I find an aristocratic tyranny!\"\n\n\"Well,--but you are the chief tyrant.\"\n\nGraham shook his head.\n\n\"Well,\" said Ostrog, \"take the general question. It is the way that\nchange has always travelled. Aristocracy, the prevalence of the best--the\nsuffering and extinction of the unfit, and so to better things.\"\n\n\"But aristocracy! those people I met--\"\n\n\"Oh! not _those_!\" said Ostrog. \"But for the most part they go to their\ndeath. Vice and pleasure! They have no children. That sort of stuff will\ndie out. If the world keeps to one road, that is, if there is no turning\nback. An easy road to excess, convenient Euthanasia for the pleasure\nseekers singed in the flame, that is the way to improve the race!\"\n\n\"Pleasant extinction,\" said Graham. \"Yet--.\" He thought for an instant.\n\"There is that other thing--the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will\nthat die out? That will not die out. And it suffers, its suffering is a\nforce that even you--\"\n\nOstrog moved impatiently, and when he spoke, he spoke rather less evenly\nthan before.\n\n\"Don't trouble about these things,\" he said. \"Everything will be\nsettled in a few days now. The Crowd is a huge foolish beast. What if\nit does not die out? Even if it does not die, it can still be tamed and\ndriven. I have no sympathy with servile men. You heard those people\nshouting and singing two nights ago. They were _taught_ that song. If\nyou had taken any man there in cold blood and asked why he shouted, he\ncould not have told you. They think they are shouting for you, that\nthey are loyal and devoted to you. Just then they were ready to\nslaughter the Council. To-day--they are already murmuring against those\nwho have overthrown the Council.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Graham. \"They shouted because their lives were dreary,\nwithout joy or pride, and because in me--in me--they hoped.\"\n\n\"And what was their hope? What is their hope? What right have they to\nhope? They work ill and they want the reward of those who work well. The\nhope of mankind--what is it? That some day the Over-man may come, that\nsome day the inferior, the weak and the bestial may be subdued or\neliminated. Subdued if not eliminated. The world is no place for the bad,\nthe stupid, the enervated. Their duty--it's a fine duty too!--is to die.\nThe death of the failure! That is the path by which the beast rose to\nmanhood, by which man goes on to higher things.\"\n\nOstrog took a pace, seemed to think, and turned on Graham. \"I can imagine\nhow this great world state of ours seems to a Victorian Englishman. You\nregret all the old forms of representative government--their spectres\nstill haunt the world, the voting councils, and parliaments and all that\neighteenth century tomfoolery. You feel moved against our Pleasure\nCities. I might have thought of that,--had I not been busy. But you will\nlearn better. The people are mad with envy--they would be in sympathy\nwith you. Even in the streets now, they clamour to destroy the Pleasure\nCities. But the Pleasure Cities are the excretory organs of the State,\nattractive places that year after year draw together all that is weak and\nvicious, all that is lascivious and lazy, all the easy roguery of the\nworld, to a graceful destruction. They go there, they have their time,\nthey die childless, all the pretty silly lascivious women die childless,\nand mankind is the better. If the people were sane they would not envy\nthe rich their way of death. And you would emancipate the silly brainless\nworkers that we have enslaved, and try to make their lives easy and\npleasant again. Just as they have sunk to what they are fit for.\" He\nsmiled a smile that irritated Graham oddly. \"You will learn better. I\nknow those ideas; in my boyhood I read your Shelley and dreamt of\nLiberty. There is no liberty, save wisdom and self-control. Liberty is\nwithin--not without. It is each man's own affair. Suppose--which is\nimpossible--that these swarming yelping fools in blue get the upper hand\nof us, what then? They will only fall to other masters. So long as there\nare sheep Nature will insist on beasts of prey. It would mean but a few\nhundred years' delay. The coming of the aristocrat is fatal and assured.\nThe end will be the Over-man--for all the mad protests of humanity. Let\nthem revolt, let them win and kill me and my like. Others will\narise--other masters. The end will be the same.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Graham doggedly.\n\nFor a moment he stood downcast.\n\n\"But I must see these things for myself,\" he said, suddenly assuming a\ntone of confident mastery. \"Only by seeing can I understand. I must\nlearn. That is what I want to tell you, Ostrog. I do not want to be King\nin a Pleasure City; that is not my pleasure. I have spent enough time\nwith aeronautics--and those other things. I must learn how people live\nnow, how the common life has developed. Then I shall understand these\nthings better. I must learn how common people live--the labour people\nmore especially--how they work, marry, bear children, die--\"\n\n\"You get that from our realistic novelists,\" suggested Ostrog, suddenly\npreoccupied.\n\n\"I want reality,\" said Graham.\n\n\"There are difficulties,\" said Ostrog, and thought. \"On the whole--\"\n\n\"I did not expect--\"\n\n\"I had thought--. And yet perhaps--. You say you want to go through the\nways of the city and see the common people.\"\n\nSuddenly he came to some conclusion. \"You would need to go disguised,\" he\nsaid. \"The city is intensely excited, and the discovery of your presence\namong them might create a fearful tumult. Still this wish of yours to go\ninto this city--this idea of yours--. Yes, now I think the thing over, it\nseems to me not altogether--. It can be contrived. If you would really\nfind an interest in that! You are, of course, Master. You can go soon if\nyou like. A disguise Asano will be able to manage. He would go with you.\nAfter all it is not a bad idea of yours.\"\n\n\"You will not want to consult me in any matter?\" asked Graham suddenly,\nstruck by an odd suspicion.\n\n\"Oh, dear no! No! I think you may trust affairs to me for a time, at any\nrate,\" said Ostrog, smiling. \"Even if we differ--\"\n\nGraham glanced at him sharply.\n\n\"There is no fighting likely to happen soon?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about these negroes. I don't believe the people\nintend any hostility to me, and, after all, I am the Master. I do not\nwant any negroes brought to London. It is an archaic prejudice perhaps,\nbut I have peculiar feelings about Europeans and the subject races. Even\nabout Paris--\"\n\nOstrog stood watching him from under his drooping brows. \"I am not\nbringing negroes to London,\" he said slowly. \"But if--\"\n\n\"You are not to bring armed negroes to London, whatever happens,\" said\nGraham. \"In that matter I am quite decided.\"\n\nOstrog resolved not to speak, and bowed deferentially.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nIN THE CITY WAYS\n\n\nAnd that night, unknown and unsuspected, Graham, dressed in the costume\nof an inferior wind-vane official keeping holiday, and accompanied by\nAsano in Labour Department canvas, surveyed the city through which he had\nwandered when it was veiled in darkness. But now he saw it lit and\nwaking, a whirlpool of life. In spite of the surging and swaying of the\nforces of revolution, in spite of the unusual discontent, the mutterings\nof the greater struggle of which the first revolt was but the prelude,\nthe myriad streams of commerce still flowed wide and strong. He knew now\nsomething of the dimensions and quality of the new age, but he was not\nprepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed view, for the torrent\nof colour and vivid impressions that poured past him.\n\nThis was his first real contact with the people of these latter days. He\nrealised that all that had gone before, saving his glimpses of the public\ntheatres and markets, had had its element of seclusion, had been a\nmovement within the comparatively narrow political quarter, that all his\nprevious experiences had revolved immediately about the question of his\nown position. But here was the city at the busiest hours of night, the\npeople to a large extent returned to their own immediate interests, the\nresumption of the real informal life, the common habits of the new time.\n\nThey emerged at first into a street whose opposite ways were crowded\nwith the blue canvas liveries. This swarm Graham saw was a portion of a\nprocession--it was odd to see a procession parading the city _seated_.\nThey carried banners of coarse black stuff with red letters. \"No\ndisarmament,\" said the banners, for the most part in crudely daubed\nletters and with variant spelling, and \"Why should we disarm?\" \"No\ndisarming.\" \"No disarming.\" Banner after banner went by, a stream of\nbanners flowing past, and at last at the end, the song of the revolt and\na noisy band of strange instruments. \"They all ought to be at work,\" said\nAsano. \"They have had no food these two days, or they have stolen it.\"\n\nPresently Asano made a detour to avoid the congested crowd that gaped\nupon the occasional passage of dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary,\nthe gleanings after death's harvest of the first revolt.\n\nThat night few people were sleeping, everyone was abroad. A vast\nexcitement, perpetual crowds perpetually changing, surrounded Graham; his\nmind was confused and darkened by an incessant tumult, by the cries and\nenigmatical fragments of the social struggle that was as yet only\nbeginning. Everywhere festoons and banners of black and strange\ndecorations, intensified the quality of his popularity. Everywhere he\ncaught snatches of that crude thick dialect that served the illiterate\nclass, the class, that is, beyond the reach of phonograph culture, in\ntheir commonplace intercourse. Everywhere this trouble of disarmament was\nin the air, with a quality of immediate stress of which he had no inkling\nduring his seclusion in the Wind-Vane quarter. He perceived that as soon\nas he returned he must discuss this with Ostrog, this and the greater\nissues of which it was the expression, in a far more conclusive way than\nhe had so far done. Perpetually that night, even in the earlier hours of\ntheir wanderings about the city, the spirit of unrest and revolt swamped\nhis attention, to the exclusion of countless strange things he might\notherwise have observed.\n\nThis preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary. Yet amidst so much\nthat was strange and vivid, no subject, however personal and insistent,\ncould exert undivided sway. There were spaces when the revolutionary\nmovement passed clean out of his mind, was drawn aside like a curtain\nfrom before some startling new aspect of the time. Helen had swayed his\nmind to this intense earnestness of enquiry, but there came times when\nshe, even, receded beyond his conscious thoughts. At one moment, for\nexample, he found they were traversing the religious quarter, for the\neasy transit about the city afforded by the moving ways rendered sporadic\nchurches and chapels no longer necessary--and his attention was vividly\narrested by the fa\u00e7ade of one of the Christian sects.\n\nThey were travelling seated on one of the swift upper ways, the place\nleapt upon them at a bend and advanced rapidly towards them. It was\ncovered with inscriptions from top to base, in vivid white and blue, save\nwhere a vast and glaring kinematograph transparency presented a realistic\nNew Testament scene, and where a vast festoon of black to show that the\npopular religion followed the popular politics, hung across the\nlettering. Graham had already become familiar with the phonotype writing\nand these inscriptions arrested him, being to his sense for the most part\nalmost incredible blasphemy. Among the less offensive were \"Salvation on\nthe First Floor and turn to the Right.\" \"Put your Money on your Maker.\"\n\"The Sharpest Conversion in London, Expert Operators! Look Slippy!\" \"What\nChrist would say to the Sleeper;--Join the Up-to-date Saints!\" \"Be a\nChristian--without hindrance to your present Occupation.\" \"All the\nBrightest Bishops on the Bench to-night and Prices as Usual.\" \"Brisk\nBlessings for Busy Business Men.\"\n\n\"But this is appalling!\" said Graham, as that deafening scream of\nmercantile piety towered above them.\n\n\"What is appalling?\" asked his little officer, apparently seeking vainly\nfor anything unusual in this shrieking enamel.\n\n\"_This_! Surely the essence of religion is reverence.\"\n\n\"Oh _that_!\" Asano looked at Graham. \"Does it shock you?\" he said in the\ntone of one who makes a discovery. \"I suppose it would, of course. I had\nforgotten. Nowadays the competition for attention is so keen, and people\nsimply haven't the leisure to attend to their souls, you know, as they\nused to do.\" He smiled. \"In the old days you had quiet Sabbaths and the\ncountryside. Though somewhere I've read of Sunday afternoons that--\"\n\n\"But _that_,\" said Graham, glancing back at the receding blue and white.\n\"That is surely not the only--\"\n\n\"There are hundreds of different ways. But, of course, if a sect doesn't\n_tell_ it doesn't pay. Worship has moved with the times. There are high\nclass sects with quieter ways--costly incense and personal attentions\nand all that. These people are extremely popular and prosperous. They\npay several dozen lions for those apartments to the Council--to you, I\nshould say.\"\n\nGraham still felt a difficulty with the coinage, and this mention of a\ndozen lions brought him abruptly to that matter. In a moment the\nscreaming temples and their swarming touts were forgotten in this new\ninterest. A turn of a phrase suggested, and an answer confirmed the idea\nthat gold and silver were both demonetised, that stamped gold which had\nbegun its reign amidst the merchants of Phoenicia was at last dethroned.\nThe change had been graduated but swift, brought about by an extension of\nthe system of cheques that had even in his previous life already\npractically superseded gold in all the larger business transactions. The\ncommon traffic of the city, the common currency indeed of all the world,\nwas conducted by means of the little brown, green and pink council\ncheques for small amounts, printed with a blank payee. Asano had several\nwith him, and at the first opportunity he supplied the gaps in his set.\nThey were printed not on tearable paper, but on a semi-transparent fabric\nof silken flexibility, interwoven with silk. Across them all sprawled a\nfacsimile of Graham's signature, his first encounter with the curves and\nturns of that familiar autograph for two hundred and three years.\n\nSome intermediary experiences made no impression sufficiently vivid to\nprevent the matter of the disarmament claiming his thoughts again; a\nblurred picture of a Theosophist temple that promised MIRACLES in\nenormous letters of unsteady fire was least submerged perhaps, but then\ncame the view of the dining hall in Northumberland Avenue. That\ninterested him very greatly.\n\nBy the energy and thought of Asano he was able to view this place from a\nlittle screened gallery reserved for the attendants of the tables. The\nbuilding was pervaded by a distant muffled hooting, piping and bawling,\nof which he did not at first understand the import, but which recalled a\ncertain mysterious leathery voice he had heard after the resumption of\nthe lights on the night of his solitary wandering.\n\nHe had grown accustomed to vastness and great numbers of people,\nnevertheless this spectacle held him for a long time. It was as he\nwatched the table service more immediately beneath, and interspersed\nwith many questions and answers concerning details, that the\nrealisation of the full significance of the feast of several thousand\npeople came to him.\n\nIt was his constant surprise to find that points that one might have\nexpected to strike vividly at the very outset never occurred to him until\nsome trivial detail suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the\nobvious thing he had overlooked. He discovered only now that this\ncontinuity of the city, this exclusion of weather, these vast halls and\nways, involved the disappearance of the household; that the typical\nVictorian \"Home,\" the little brick cell containing kitchen and scullery,\nliving rooms and bedrooms, had, save for the ruins that diversified the\ncountryside, vanished as surely as the wattle hut. But now he saw what\nhad indeed been manifest from the first, that London, regarded as a\nliving place, was no longer an aggregation of houses but a prodigious\nhotel, an hotel with a thousand classes of accommodation, thousands of\ndining halls, chapels, theatres, markets and places of assembly, a\nsynthesis of enterprises, of which he chiefly was the owner. People had\ntheir sleeping rooms, with, it might be, antechambers, rooms that were\nalways sanitary at least whatever the degree of comfort and privacy, and\nfor the rest they lived much as many people had lived in the new-made\ngiant hotels of the Victorian days, eating, reading, thinking, playing,\nconversing, all in places of public resort, going to their work in the\nindustrial quarters of the city or doing business in their offices in the\ntrading section.\n\nHe perceived at once how necessarily this state of affairs had developed\nfrom the Victorian city. The fundamental reason for the modern city had\never been the economy of co-operation. The chief thing to prevent the\nmerging of the separate households in his own generation was simply the\nstill imperfect civilisation of the people, the strong barbaric pride,\npassions, and prejudices, the jealousies, rivalries, and violence of the\nmiddle and lower classes, which had necessitated the entire separation of\ncontiguous households. But the change, the taming of the people, had been\nin rapid progress even then. In his brief thirty years of previous life\nhe had seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming meals from\nhome, the casually patronised horse-box coffee-house had given place to\nthe open and crowded Aerated Bread Shop for instance, women's clubs had\nhad their beginning, and an immense development of reading rooms, lounges\nand libraries had witnessed to the growth of social confidence. These\npromises had by this time attained to their complete fulfilment. The\nlocked and barred household had passed away.\n\nThese people below him belonged, he learnt, to the lower middle class,\nthe class just above the blue labourers, a class so accustomed in the\nVictorian period to feed with every precaution of privacy that its\nmembers, when occasion confronted them with a public meal, would usually\nhide their embarrassment under horseplay or a markedly militant\ndemeanour. But these gaily, if lightly dressed people below, albeit\nvivacious, hurried and uncommunicative, were dexterously mannered and\ncertainly quite at their ease with regard to one another.\n\nHe noted a slight significant thing; the table, as far as he could see,\nwas and remained delightfully neat, there was nothing to parallel the\nconfusion, the broadcast crumbs, the splashes of viand and condiment, the\noverturned drink and displaced ornaments, which would have marked the\nstormy progress of the Victorian meal. The table furniture was very\ndifferent. There were no ornaments, no flowers, and the table was without\na cloth, being made, he learnt, of a solid substance having the texture\nand appearance of damask. He discerned that this damask substance was\npatterned with gracefully designed trade advertisements.\n\nIn a sort of recess before each diner was a complex apparatus of\nporcelain and metal. There was one plate of white porcelain, and by means\nof taps for hot and cold volatile fluids the diner washed this himself\nbetween the courses; he also washed his elegant white metal knife and\nfork and spoon as occasion required.\n\nSoup and the chemical wine that was the common drink were delivered by\nsimilar taps, and the remaining covers travelled automatically in\ntastefully arranged dishes down the table along silver rails. The diner\nstopped these and helped himself at his discretion. They appeared at a\nlittle door at one end of the table, and vanished at the other. That turn\nof democratic sentiment in decay, that ugly pride of menial souls, which\nrenders equals loth to wait on one another, was very strong he found\namong these people. He was so preoccupied with these details that it was\nonly as he was leaving the place that he remarked the huge advertisement\ndioramas that marched majestically along the upper walls and proclaimed\nthe most remarkable commodities.\n\nBeyond this place they came into a crowded hall, and he discovered the\ncause of the noise that had perplexed him. They paused at a turnstile at\nwhich a payment was made.\n\nGraham's attention was immediately arrested by a violent, loud hoot,\nfollowed by a vast leathery voice. \"The Master is sleeping peacefully,\"\nit vociferated. \"He is in excellent health. He is going to devote the\nrest of his life to aeronautics. He says women are more beautiful than\never. Galloop! Wow! Our wonderful civilisation astonishes him beyond\nmeasure. Beyond all measure. Galloop. He puts great trust in Boss\nOstrog, absolute confidence in Boss Ostrog. Ostrog is to be his chief\nminister; is authorised to remove or reinstate public officers--all\npatronage will be in his hands. All patronage in the hands of Boss\nOstrog! The Councillors have been sent back to their own prison above\nthe Council House.\"\n\nGraham stopped at the first sentence, and, looking up, beheld a foolish\ntrumpet face from which this was brayed. This was the General\nIntelligence Machine. For a space it seemed to be gathering breath, and a\nregular throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible. Then it\ntrumpeted \"Galloop, Galloop,\" and broke out again.\n\n\"Paris is now pacified. All resistance is over. Galloop! The black police\nhold every position of importance in the city. They fought with great\nbravery, singing songs written in praise of their ancestors by the poet\nKipling. Once or twice they got out of hand, and tortured and mutilated\nwounded and captured insurgents, men and women. Moral--don't go\nrebelling. Haha! Galloop, Galloop! They are lively fellows. Lively brave\nfellows. Let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog of this city.\nYah! Banderlog! Filth of the earth! Galloop, Galloop!\"\n\nThe voice ceased. There was a confused murmur of disapproval among the\ncrowd. \"Damned niggers.\" A man began to harangue near them. \"Is this the\nMaster's doing, brothers? Is this the Master's doing?\"\n\n\"Black police!\" said Graham. \"What is that? You don't mean--\"\n\nAsano touched his arm and gave him a warning look, and forthwith another\nof these mechanisms screamed deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill\nvoice. \"Yahaha, Yahah, Yap! Hear a live paper yelp! Live paper. Yaha!\nShocking outrage in Paris. Yahahah! The Parisians exasperated by the\nblack police to the pitch of assassination. Dreadful reprisals. Savage\ntimes come again. Blood! Blood! Yaha!\" The nearer Babble Machine hooted\nstupendously, \"Galloop, Galloop,\" drowned the end of the sentence, and\nproceeded in a rather flatter note than before with novel comments on the\nhorrors of disorder. \"Law and order must be maintained,\" said the nearer\nBabble Machine.\n\n\"But,\" began Graham.\n\n\"Don't ask questions here,\" said Asano, \"or you will be involved in an\nargument.\"\n\n\"Then let us go on,\" said Graham, \"for I want to know more of this.\"\n\nAs he and his companion pushed their way through the excited crowd that\nswarmed beneath these voices, towards the exit, Graham conceived more\nclearly the proportion and features of this room. Altogether, great and\nsmall, there must have been nearly a thousand of these erections,\npiping, hooting, bawling and gabbling in that great space, each with its\ncrowd of excited listeners, the majority of them men dressed in blue\ncanvas. There were all sizes of machines, from the little gossiping\nmechanisms that chuckled out mechanical sarcasm in odd corners, through\na number of grades to such fifty-foot giants as that which had first\nhooted over Graham.\n\nThis place was unusually crowded, because of the intense public interest\nin the course of affairs in Paris. Evidently the struggle had been much\nmore savage than Ostrog had represented it. All the mechanisms were\ndiscoursing upon that topic, and the repetition of the people made the\nhuge hive buzz with such phrases as \"Lynched policemen,\" \"Women burnt\nalive,\" \"Fuzzy Wuzzy.\" \"But does the Master allow such things?\" asked a\nman near him. \"Is _this_ the beginning of the Master's rule?\"\n\nIs _this_ the beginning of the Master's rule? For a long time after he\nhad left the place, the hooting, whistling and braying of the machines\npursued him; \"Galloop, Galloop,\" \"Yahahah, Yaha, Yap! Yaha!\" Is _this_\nthe beginning of the Master's rule?\n\nDirectly they were out upon the ways he began to question Asano closely\non the nature of the Parisian struggle. \"This disarmament! What was their\ntrouble? What does it all mean?\" Asano seemed chiefly anxious to reassure\nhim that it was \"all right.\"\n\n\"But these outrages!\"\n\n\"You cannot have an omelette,\" said Asano, \"without breaking eggs. It is\nonly the rough people. Only in one part of the city. All the rest is all\nright. The Parisian labourers are the wildest in the world, except ours.\"\n\n\"What! the Londoners?\"\n\n\"No, the Japanese. They have to be kept in order.\"\n\n\"But burning women alive!\"\n\n\"A Commune!\" said Asano. \"They would rob you of your property. They would\ndo away with property and give the world over to mob rule. You are\nMaster, the world is yours. But there will be no Commune here. There is\nno need for black police here.\n\n\"And every consideration has been shown. It is their own negroes--French\nspeaking negroes. Senegal regiments, and Niger and Timbuctoo.\"\n\n\"Regiments?\" said Graham, \"I thought there was only one--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Asano, and glanced at him. \"There is more than one.\"\n\nGraham felt unpleasantly helpless.\n\n\"I did not think,\" he began and stopped abruptly. He went off at a\ntangent to ask for information about these Babble Machines. For the most\npart, the crowd present had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed, and\nGraham learnt that so far as the more prosperous classes were concerned,\nin all the more comfortable private apartments of the city were fixed\nBabble Machines that would speak directly a lever was pulled. The tenant\nof the apartment could connect this with the cables of any of the great\nNews Syndicates that he preferred. When he learnt this presently, he\ndemanded the reason of their absence from his own suite of apartments.\nAsano was embarrassed. \"I never thought,\" he said. \"Ostrog must have had\nthem removed.\"\n\nGraham stared. \"How was I to know?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Perhaps he thought they would annoy you,\" said Asano.\n\n\"They must be replaced directly I return,\" said Graham after an interval.\n\nHe found a difficulty in understanding that this news room and the dining\nhall were not great central places, that such establishments were\nrepeated almost beyond counting all over the city. But ever and again\nduring the night's expedition his ears would pick out from the tumult of\nthe ways the peculiar hooting of the organ of Boss Ostrog, \"Galloop,\nGalloop!\" or the shrill \"Yahaha, Yaha Yap!--Hear a live paper yelp!\" of\nits chief rival.\n\nRepeated, too, everywhere, were such _cr\u00e8ches_ as the one he now entered.\nIt was reached by a lift, and by a glass bridge that flung across the\ndining hall and traversed the ways at a slight upward angle. To enter the\nfirst section of the place necessitated the use of his solvent signature\nunder Asano's direction. They were immediately attended to by a man in a\nviolet robe and gold clasp, the insignia of practising medical men. He\nperceived from this man's manner that his identity was known, and\nproceeded to ask questions on the strange arrangements of the place\nwithout reserve.\n\nOn either side of the passage, which was silent and padded, as if to\ndeaden the footfall, were narrow little doors, their size and arrangement\nsuggestive of the cells of a Victorian prison. But the upper portion of\neach door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that had enclosed\nhim at his awakening, and within, dimly seen, lay, in every case, a very\nyoung baby in a little nest of wadding. Elaborate apparatus watched the\natmosphere and rang a bell far away in the central office at the\nslightest departure from the optimum of temperature and moisture. A\nsystem of such _cr\u00e8ches_ had almost entirely replaced the hazardous\nadventures of the old-world nursing. The attendant presently called\nGraham's attention to the wet nurses, a vista of mechanical figures, with\narms, shoulders, and breasts of astonishingly realistic modelling,\narticulation, and texture, but mere brass tripods below, and having in\nthe place of features a flat disc bearing advertisements likely to be of\ninterest to mothers.\n\nOf all the strange things that Graham came upon that night, none jarred\nmore upon his habits of thought than this place. The spectacle of the\nlittle pink creatures, their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague\nfirst movements, left alone, without embrace or endearment, was wholly\nrepugnant to him. The attendant doctor was of a different opinion. His\nstatistical evidence showed beyond dispute that in the Victorian times\nthe most dangerous passage of life was the arms of the mother, that there\nhuman mortality had ever been most terrible. On the other hand this\n_cr\u00e8che_ company, the International Cr\u00e8che Syndicate, lost not one-half\nper cent, of the million babies or so that formed its peculiar care. But\nGraham's prejudice was too strong even for those figures.\n\nAlong one of the many passages of the place they presently came upon a\nyoung couple in the usual blue canvas peering through the transparency\nand laughing hysterically at the bald head of their first-born. Graham's\nface must have showed his estimate of them, for their merriment ceased\nand they looked abashed. But this little incident accentuated his sudden\nrealisation of the gulf between his habits of thought and the ways of the\nnew age. He passed on to the crawling rooms and the Kindergarten,\nperplexed and distressed. He found the endless long playrooms were empty!\nthe latter-day children at least still spent their nights in sleep. As\nthey went through these, the little officer pointed out the nature of the\ntoys, developments of those devised by that inspired sentimentalist\nFroebel. There were nurses here, but much was done by machines that sang\nand danced and dandled.\n\nGraham was still not clear upon many points. \"But so many orphans,\" he\nsaid perplexed, reverting to a first misconception, and learnt again that\nthey were not orphans.\n\nSo soon as they had left the _cr\u00e8che_ he began to speak of the horror the\nbabies in their incubating cases had caused him. \"Is motherhood gone?\" he\nsaid. \"Was it a cant? Surely it was an instinct. This seems so\nunnatural--abominable almost.\"\n\n\"Along here we shall come to the dancing place,\" said Asano by way of\nreply. \"It is sure to be crowded. In spite of all the political unrest it\nwill be crowded. The women take no great interest in politics--except a\nfew here and there. You will see the mothers--most young women in London\nare mothers. In that class it is considered a creditable thing to have\none child--a proof of animation. Few middle class people have more than\none. With the Labour Department it is different. As for motherhood! They\nstill take an immense pride in the children. They come here to look at\nthem quite often.\"\n\n\"Then do you mean that the population of the World--?\"\n\n\"Is falling? Yes. Except among the people under the Labour Department. In\nspite of scientific discipline they are reckless--\"\n\nThe air was suddenly dancing with music, and down a way they approached\nobliquely, set with gorgeous pillars as it seemed of clear amethyst,\nflowed a concourse of gay people and a tumult of merry cries and\nlaughter. He saw curled heads, wreathed brows, and a happy intricate\nflutter of gamboge pass triumphant across the picture.\n\n\"You will see,\" said Asano with a faint smile. \"The world has changed. In\na moment you will see the mothers of the new age. Come this way. We shall\nsee those yonder again very soon.\"\n\nThey ascended a certain height in a swift lift, and changed to a slower\none. As they went on the music grew upon them, until it was near and full\nand splendid, and, moving with its glorious intricacies they could\ndistinguish the beat of innumerable dancing feet. They made a payment at\na turnstile, and emerged upon the wide gallery that overlooked the\ndancing place, and upon the full enchantment of sound and sight.\n\n\"Here,\" said Asano, \"are the fathers and mothers of the little\nones you saw.\"\n\nThe hall was not so richly decorated as that of the Atlas, but saving\nthat, it was, for its size, the most splendid Graham had seen. The\nbeautiful white-limbed figures that supported the galleries reminded him\nonce more of the restored magnificence of sculpture; they seemed to\nwrithe in engaging attitudes, their faces laughed. The source of the\nmusic that filled the place was hidden, and the whole vast shining floor\nwas thick with dancing couples. \"Look at them,\" said the little officer,\n\"see how much they show of motherhood.\"\n\nThe gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge of a huge screen\nthat cut the dancing hall on one side from a sort of outer hall that\nshowed through broad arches the incessant onward rush of the city ways.\nIn this outer hall was a great crowd of less brilliantly dressed people,\nas numerous almost as those who danced within, the great majority wearing\nthe blue uniform of the Labour Department that was now so familiar to\nGraham. Too poor to pass the turnstiles to the festival, they were yet\nunable to keep away from the sound of its seductions. Some of them even\nhad cleared spaces, and were dancing also, fluttering their rags in the\nair. Some shouted as they danced, jests and odd allusions Graham did not\nunderstand. Once someone began whistling the refrain of the revolutionary\nsong, but it seemed as though that beginning was promptly suppressed. The\ncorner was dark and Graham could not see. He turned to the hall again.\nAbove the caryatids were marble busts of men whom that age esteemed great\nmoral emancipators and pioneers; for the most part their names were\nstrange to Graham, though he recognised Grant Allen, Le Gallienne,\nNietzsche, Shelley and Goodwin. Great black festoons and eloquent\nsentiments reinforced the huge inscription that partially defaced the\nupper end of the dancing place, and asserted that \"The Festival of the\nAwakening\" was in progress.\n\n\"Myriads are taking holiday or staying from work because of that, quite\napart from the labourers who refuse to go back,\" said Asano. \"These\npeople are always ready for holidays.\"\n\nGraham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over, looking down at the\ndancers. Save for two or three remote whispering couples, who had stolen\napart, he and his guide had the gallery to themselves. A warm breath of\nscent and vitality came up to him. Both men and women below were lightly\nclad, bare-armed, open-necked, as the universal warmth of the city\npermitted. The hair of the men was often a mass of effeminate curls,\ntheir chins were always shaven, and many of them had flushed or coloured\ncheeks. Many of the women were very pretty, and all were dressed with\nelaborate coquetry. As they swept by beneath, he saw ecstatic faces with\neyes half closed in pleasure.\n\n\"What sort of people are these?\" he asked abruptly.\n\n\"Workers--prosperous workers. What you would have called the middle\nclass. Independent tradesmen with little separate businesses have\nvanished long ago, but there are store servers, managers, engineers of a\nhundred sorts. To-night is a holiday of course, and every dancing place\nin the city will be crowded, and every place of worship.\"\n\n\"But--the women?\"\n\n\"The same. There's a thousand forms of work for women now. But you had\nthe beginning of the independent working-woman in your days. Most women\nare independent now. Most of these are married more or less--there are a\nnumber of methods of contract--and that gives them more money, and\nenables them to enjoy themselves.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Graham, looking at the flushed faces, the flash and swirl\nof movement, and still thinking of that nightmare of pink helpless limbs.\n\"And these are--mothers.\"\n\n\"Most of them.\"\n\n\"The more I see of these things the more complex I find your problems.\nThis, for instance, is a surprise. That news from Paris was a surprise.\"\n\nIn a little while he spoke again:\n\n\"These are mothers. Presently, I suppose, I shall get into the modern way\nof seeing things. I have old habits of mind clinging about me--habits\nbased, I suppose, on needs that are over and done with. Of course, in our\ntime, a woman was supposed not only to bear children, but to cherish\nthem, to devote herself to them, to educate them--all the essentials of\nmoral and mental education a child owed its mother. Or went without.\nQuite a number, I admit, went without. Nowadays, clearly, there is no\nmore need for such care than if they were butterflies. I see that! Only\nthere was an ideal--that figure of a grave, patient woman, silently and\nserenely mistress of a home, mother and maker of men--to love her was a\nsort of worship--\"\n\nHe stopped and repeated, \"A sort of worship.\"\n\n\"Ideals change,\" said the little man, \"as needs change.\"\n\nGraham awoke from an instant reverie and Asano repeated his words.\nGraham's mind returned to the thing at hand.\n\n\"Of course I see the perfect reasonableness of this. Restraint,\nsoberness, the matured thought, the unselfish act, they are necessities\nof the barbarous state, the life of dangers. Dourness is man's tribute to\nunconquered nature. But man has conquered nature now for all practical\npurposes--his political affairs are managed by Bosses with a black\npolice--and life is joyous.\"\n\nHe looked at the dancers again. \"Joyous,\" he said.\n\n\"There are weary moments,\" said the little officer, reflectively.\n\n\"They all look young. Down there I should be visibly the oldest man. And\nin my own time I should have passed as middle-aged.\"\n\n\"They are young. There are few old people in this class in the\nwork cities.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Old people's lives are not so pleasant as they used to be, unless they\nare rich to hire lovers and helpers. And we have an institution called\nEuthanasy.\"\n\n\"Ah! that Euthanasy!\" said Graham. \"The easy death?\"\n\n\"The easy death. It is the last pleasure. The Euthanasy Company does it\nwell. People will pay the sum--it is a costly thing--long beforehand, go\noff to some pleasure city and return impoverished and weary, very weary.\"\n\n\"There is a lot left for me to understand,\" said Graham after a pause.\n\"Yet I see the logic of it all. Our array of angry virtues and sour\nrestraints was the consequence of danger and insecurity. The Stoic, the\nPuritan, even in my time, were vanishing types. In the old days man was\narmed against Pain, now he is eager for Pleasure. There lies the\ndifference. Civilisation has driven pain and danger so far off--for\nwell-to-do people. And only well-to-do people matter now. I have been\nasleep two hundred years.\"\n\nFor a minute they leant on the balustrading, following the intricate\nevolution of the dance. Indeed the scene was very beautiful.\n\n\"Before God,\" said Graham, suddenly, \"I would rather be a wounded\nsentinel freezing in the snow than one of these painted fools!\"\n\n\"In the snow,\" said Asano, \"one might think differently.\"\n\n\"I am uncivilised,\" said Graham, not heeding him. \"That is the trouble. I\nam primitive--Paleolithic. _Their_ fountain of rage and fear and anger is\nsealed and closed, the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and easy\nand delightful. You must bear with my nineteenth century shocks and\ndisgusts. These people, you say, are skilled workers and so forth. And\nwhile these dance, men are fighting--men are dying in Paris to keep the\nworld--that they may dance.\"\n\nAsano smiled faintly. \"For that matter, men are dying in London,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Where do these sleep?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"Above and below--an intricate warren.\"\n\n\"And where do they work? This is--the domestic life.\"\n\n\"You will see little work to-night. Half the workers are out or under\narms. Half these people are keeping holiday. But we will go to the work\nplaces if you wish it.\"\n\nFor a time Graham watched the dancers, then suddenly turned away. \"I want\nto see the workers. I have seen enough of these,\" he said.\n\nAsano led the way along the gallery across the dancing hall. Presently\nthey came to a transverse passage that brought a breath of fresher,\ncolder air.\n\nAsano glanced at this passage as they went past, stopped, went back to\nit, and turned to Graham with a smile. \"Here, Sire,\" he said, \"is\nsomething--will be familiar to you at least--and yet--. But I will not\ntell you. Come!\"\n\nHe led the way along a closed passage that presently became cold. The\nreverberation of their feet told that this passage was a bridge. They\ncame into a circular gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather,\nand so reached a circular chamber which seemed familiar, though Graham\ncould not recall distinctly when he had entered it before. In this was a\nladder--the first ladder he had seen since his awakening--up which they\nwent, and came into a high, dark, cold place in which was another almost\nvertical ladder. This they ascended, Graham still perplexed.\n\nBut at the top he understood, and recognised the metallic bars to which\nhe clung. He was in the cage under the ball of St. Paul's. The dome rose\nbut a little way above the general contour of the city, into the still\ntwilight, and sloped away, shining greasily under a few distant lights,\ninto a circumambient ditch of darkness.\n\nOut between the bars he looked upon the wind-clear northern sky and saw\nthe starry constellations all unchanged. Capella hung in the west, Vega\nwas rising, and the seven glittering points of the Great Bear swept\noverhead in their stately circle about the Pole.\n\nHe saw these stars in a clear gap of sky. To the east and south the great\ncircular shapes of complaining wind-wheels blotted out the heavens, so\nthat the glare about the Council House was hidden. To the southwest hung\nOrion, showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery of iron-work and\ninterlacing shapes above a dazzling coruscation of lights. A bellowing\nand siren screaming that came from the flying stages warned the world\nthat one of the aeroplanes was ready to start. He remained for a space\ngazing towards the glaring stage. Then his eyes went back to the\nnorthward constellations.\n\nFor a long time he was silent. \"This,\" he said at last, smiling in the\nshadow, \"seems the strangest thing of all. To stand in the dome of St.\nPaul's and look once more upon these familiar, silent stars!\"\n\nThence Graham was taken by Asano along devious ways to the great gambling\nand business quarters where the bulk of the fortunes in the city were\nlost and made. It impressed him as a well-nigh interminable series of\nvery high halls, surrounded by tiers upon tiers of galleries into which\nopened thousands of offices, and traversed by a complicated multitude of\nbridges, footways, aerial motor rails, and trapeze and cable leaps. And\nhere more than anywhere the note of vehement vitality, of uncontrollable,\nhasty activity, rose high. Everywhere was violent advertisement, until\nhis brain swam at the tumult of light and colour. And Babble Machines of\na peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filled the air with strenuous\nsquealing and an idiotic slang. \"Skin your eyes and slide,\" \"Gewhoop,\nBonanza,\" \"Gollipers come and hark!\"\n\nThe place seemed to him to be dense with people either profoundly\nagitated or swelling with obscure cunning, yet he learnt that the place\nwas comparatively empty, that the great political convulsion of the last\nfew days had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum. In one\nhuge place were long avenues of roulette tables, each with an excited,\nundignified crowd about it; in another a yelping Babel of white-faced\nwomen and red-necked leathery-lunged men bought and sold the shares of an\nabsolutely fictitious business undertaking which, every five minutes,\npaid a dividend of ten per cent, and cancelled a certain proportion of\nits shares by means of a lottery wheel.\n\nThese business activities were prosecuted with an energy that readily\npassed into violence, and Graham approaching a dense crowd found at its\ncentre a couple of prominent merchants in violent controversy with teeth\nand nails on some delicate point of business etiquette. Something still\nremained in life to be fought for. Further he had a shock at a vehement\nannouncement in phonetic letters of scarlet flame, each twice the height\nof a man, that \"WE ASSURE THE PROPRAIET'R. WE ASSURE THE PROPRAIET'R.\"\n\n\"Who's the proprietor?\" he asked.\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"But what do they assure me?\" he asked. \"What do they assure me?\"\n\n\"Didn't you have assurance?\"\n\nGraham thought. \"Insurance?\"\n\n\"Yes--Insurance. I remember that was the older word. They are insuring\nyour life. Dozands of people are taking out policies, myriads of lions\nare being put on you. And further on other people are buying annuities.\nThey do that on everybody who is at all prominent. Look there!\"\n\nA crowd of people surged and roared, and Graham saw a vast black screen\nsuddenly illuminated in still larger letters of burning purple. \"Anuetes\non the Propraiet'r--x 5 pr. G.\" The people began to boo and shout at\nthis, a number of hard breathing, wild-eyed men came running past,\nclawing with hooked fingers at the air. There was a furious crush about a\nlittle doorway.\n\nAsano did a brief, inaccurate calculation. \"Seventeen per cent, per\nannum is their annuity on you. They would not pay so much per cent, if\nthey could see you now, Sire. But they do not know. Your own annuities\nused to be a very safe investment, but now you are sheer gambling, of\ncourse. This is probably a desperate bid. I doubt if people will get\ntheir money.\"\n\nThe crowd of would-be annuitants grew so thick about them that for some\ntime they could move neither forward nor backward. Graham noticed what\nappeared to him to be a high proportion of women among the speculators,\nand was reminded again of the economic independence of their sex. They\nseemed remarkably well able to take care of themselves in the crowd,\nusing their elbows with particular skill, as he learnt to his cost. One\ncurly-headed person caught in the pressure for a space, looked\nsteadfastly at him several times, almost as if she recognised him, and\nthen, edging deliberately towards him, touched his hand with her arm in a\nscarcely accidental manner, and made it plain by a look as ancient as\nChaldea that he had found favour in her eyes. And then a lank,\ngrey-bearded man, perspiring copiously in a noble passion of self-help,\nblind to all earthly things save that glaring bait, thrust between them\nin a cataclysmal rush towards that alluring \"X 5 pr. G.\"\n\n\"I want to get out of this,\" said Graham to Asano. \"This is not what I\ncame to see. Show me the workers. I want to see the people in blue. These\nparasitic lunatics--\"\n\nHe found himself wedged into a straggling mass of people.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE UNDER-SIDE\n\n\nFrom the Business Quarter they presently passed by the running ways into\na remote quarter of the city, where the bulk of the manufactures was\ndone. On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in\na broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from\nthe North. In both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid.\nThe river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water, overarched by\nbuildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with\nreceding lights. A string of black barges passed seaward, manned by\nblue-clad men. The road was a long and very broad and high tunnel, along\nwhich big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly. Here, too, the\ndistinctive blue of the Labour Department was in abundance. The\nsmoothness of the double tracks, the largeness and the lightness of the\nbig pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body, struck Graham\nmost vividly. One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic\nrods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his\nattention unduly. Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out\nthe picture.\n\nPresently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a\npassage that sloped downward, and so came to a descending lift again. The\nappearance of things changed. Even the pretence of architectural\nornament disappeared, the lights diminished in number and size, the\narchitecture became more and more massive in proportion to the spaces as\nthe factory quarters were reached. And in the dusty biscuit-making place\nof the potters, among the felspar mills, in the furnace rooms of the\nmetal workers, among the incandescent lakes of crude Eadhamite, the blue\ncanvas clothing was on man, woman and child.\n\nMany of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery,\nendless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary\ndislocation, but wherever there was work it was being done by slow-moving\nworkers in blue canvas. The only people not in blue canvas were the\noverlookers of the work-places and the orange-clad Labour Police. And\nfresh from the flushed faces of the dancing halls, the voluntary vigours\nof the business quarter, Graham could note the pinched faces, the feeble\nmuscles, and weary eyes of many of the latter-day workers. Such as he saw\nat work were noticeably inferior in physique to the few gaily dressed\nmanagers and forewomen who were directing their labours. The burly\nlabourers of the old Victorian times had followed that dray horse and all\nsuch living force producers, to extinction; the place of his costly\nmuscles was taken by some dexterous machine. The latter-day labourer,\nmale as well as female, was essentially a machine-minder and feeder, a\nservant and attendant, or an artist under direction.\n\nThe women, in comparison with those Graham remembered, were as a class\ndistinctly plain and flat-chested. Two hundred years of emancipation\nfrom the moral restraints of Puritanical religion, two hundred years of\ncity life, had done their work in eliminating the strain of feminine\nbeauty and vigour from the blue canvas myriads. To be brilliant\nphysically or mentally, to be in any way attractive or exceptional, had\nbeen and was still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line\nof escape to the Pleasure City and its splendours and delights, and at\nlast to the Euthanasy and peace. To be steadfast against such\ninducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls. In\nthe young cities of Graham's former life, the newly aggregated labouring\nmass had been a diverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of\npersonal honour and a high morality; now it was differentiating into an\ninstinct class, with a moral and physical difference of its own--even\nwith a dialect of its own.\n\nThey penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places.\nPresently they passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways,\nand saw its platforms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks of\nwhite lights between the transverse slits. The factories that were not\nworking were sparsely lighted; to Graham they and their shrouded aisles\nof giant machines seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was going\non the illumination was far less brilliant than upon the public ways.\n\nBeyond the blazing lakes of Eadhamite he came to the warren of the\njewellers, and, with some difficulty and by using his signature, obtained\nadmission to these galleries. They were high and dark, and rather cold.\nIn the first a few men were making ornaments of gold filigree, each man\nat a little bench by himself, and with a little shaded light. The long\nvista of light patches, with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving\namong the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent face like the face of a\nghost, in each shadow, had the oddest effect.\n\nThe work was beautifully executed, but without any strength of modelling\nor drawing, for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the\nchanges on a geometrical _motif_. These workers wore a peculiar white\nuniform without pockets or sleeves. They assumed this on coming to work,\nbut at night they were stripped and examined before they left the\npremises of the Department. In spite of every precaution, the Labour\npoliceman told them in a depressed tone, the Department was not\ninfrequently robbed.\n\nBeyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of\nartificial ruby, and next these were men and women working together upon\nthe slabs of copper net that formed the basis of _cloisonn\u00e9_ tiles. Many\nof these workers had lips and nostrils a livid white, due to a disease\ncaused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced to be much in fashion.\nAsano apologised to Graham for this offensive sight, but excused himself\non the score of the convenience of this route. \"This is what I wanted to\nsee,\" said Graham; \"this is what I wanted to see,\" trying to avoid a\nstart at a particularly striking disfigurement.\n\n\"She might have done better with herself than that,\" said Asano.\n\nGraham made some indignant comments.\n\n\"But, Sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple,\"\nsaid Asano. \"In your days people could stand such crudities, they were\nnearer the barbaric by two hundred years.\"\n\nThey continued along one of the lower galleries of this _cloisonn\u00e9_\nfactory, and came to a little bridge that spanned a vault. Looking over\nthe parapet, Graham saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more\ntremendous archings than any he had seen. Three barges, smothered in\nfloury dust, were being unloaded of their cargoes of powdered felspar by\na multitude of coughing men, each guiding a little truck; the dust filled\nthe place with a choking mist, and turned the electric glare yellow. The\nvague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their feet, and rushed\nto and fro against a long stretch of white-washed wall. Every now and\nthen one would stop to cough.\n\nA shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water, brought to\nGraham's mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and\nlifts that rose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky. The\nmen worked in silence under the supervision of two of the Labour Police;\ntheir feet made a hollow thunder on the planks along which they went to\nand fro. And as he looked at this scene, some hidden voice in the\ndarkness began to sing.\n\n\"Stop that!\" shouted one of the policemen, but the order was disobeyed,\nand first one and then all the white-stained men who were working there\nhad taken up the beating refrain, singing it defiantly--the Song of the\nRevolt. The feet upon the planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song,\ntramp, tramp, tramp. The policeman who had shouted glanced at his fellow,\nand Graham saw him shrug his shoulders. He made no further effort to stop\nthe singing.\n\nAnd so they went through these factories and places of toil, seeing many\npainful and grim things. That walk left on Graham's mind a maze of\nmemories, fluctuating pictures of swathed halls, and crowded vaults seen\nthrough clouds of dust, of intricate machines, the racing threads of\nlooms, the heavy beat of stamping machinery, the roar and rattle of belt\nand armature, of ill-lit subterranean aisles of sleeping places,\nillimitable vistas of pin-point lights. Here was the smell of tanning,\nand here the reek of a brewery, and here unprecedented reeks. Everywhere\nwere pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as Graham had never\nbefore seen, thick Titans of greasy, shining brickwork crushed beneath\nthe vast weight of that complex city world, even as these anemic millions\nwere crushed by its complexity. And everywhere were pale features, lean\nlimbs, disfigurement and degradation.\n\nOnce and again, and again a third time, Graham heard the song of the\nrevolt during his long, unpleasant research in these places, and once he\nsaw a confused struggle down a passage, and learnt that a number of these\nserfs had seized their bread before their work was done. Graham was\nascending towards the ways again when he saw a number of blue-clad\nchildren running down a transverse passage, and presently perceived the\nreason of their panic in a company of the Labour Police armed with clubs,\ntrotting towards some unknown disturbance. And then came a remote\ndisorder. But for the most part this remnant that worked, worked\nhopelessly. All the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above in\nthe streets that night, calling for the Master, and valiantly and noisily\nkeeping its arms.\n\nThey emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light\nof the middle passage of the platforms again. They became aware of the\nremote hooting and yelping of the machines of one of the General\nIntelligence Offices, and suddenly came men running, and along the\nplatforms and about the ways everywhere was a shouting and crying. Then a\nwoman with a face of mute white terror, and another who gasped and\nshrieked as she ran.\n\n\"What has happened now?\" said Graham, puzzled, for he could not\nunderstand their thick speech. Then he heard it in English and perceived\nthat the thing that everyone was shouting, that men yelled to one\nanother, that women took up screaming, that was passing like the first\nbreeze of a thunderstorm, chill and sudden through the city, was this:\n\"Ostrog has ordered the Black Police to London. The Black Police are\ncoming from South Africa.... The Black Police. The Black Police.\"\n\nAsano's face was white and astonished; he hesitated, looked at Graham's\nface, and told him the thing he already knew. \"But how can they know?\"\nasked Asano.\n\nGraham heard someone shouting. \"Stop all work. Stop all work,\" and a\nswarthy hunchback, ridiculously gay in green and gold, came leaping down\nthe platforms toward him, bawling again and again in good English, \"This\nis Ostrog's doing, Ostrog the Knave! The Master is betrayed.\" His voice\nwas hoarse and a thin foam dropped from his ugly shouting mouth. He\nyelled an unspeakable horror that the Black Police had done in Paris, and\nso passed shrieking, \"Ostrog the Knave!\"\n\nFor a moment Graham stood still, for it had come upon him again that\nthese things were a dream. He looked up at the great cliff of buildings\non either side, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and\ndown to the roaring tiers of platforms, and the shouting, running people\nwho were gesticulating past. \"The Master is betrayed!\" they cried. \"The\nMaster is betrayed!\"\n\nSuddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent. His\nheart began to beat fast and strong.\n\n\"It has come,\" he said. \"I might have known. The hour has come.\"\n\nHe thought swiftly. \"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"Go back to the Council House,\" said Asano.\n\n\"Why should I not appeal--? The people are here.\"\n\n\"You will lose time. They will doubt if it is you. But they will mass\nabout the Council House. There you will find their leaders. Your strength\nis there--with them.\"\n\n\"Suppose this is only a rumour?\"\n\n\"It sounds true,\" said Asano.\n\n\"Let us have the facts,\" said Graham.\n\nAsano shrugged his shoulders. \"We had better get towards the Council\nHouse,\" he cried. \"That is where they will swarm. Even now the ruins may\nbe impassable.\"\n\nGraham regarded him doubtfully and followed him.\n\nThey went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one, and there Asano\naccosted a labourer. The answers to his questions were in the thick,\nvulgar speech.\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"He knows little, but he told me that the Black Police would have arrived\nhere before the people knew--had not someone in the Wind-Vane Offices\nlearnt. He said a girl.\"\n\n\"A girl? Not--?\"\n\n\"He said a girl--he did not know who she was. Who came out from the\nCouncil House crying aloud, and told the men at work among the ruins.\"\n\nAnd then another thing was shouted, something that turned an aimless\ntumult into determinate movements, it came like a wind along the\nstreet. \"To your wards, to your wards. Every man get arms. Every man to\nhis ward!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE STRUGGLE IN THE COUNCIL HOUSE\n\n\nAs Asano and Graham hurried along to the ruins about the Council House,\nthey saw everywhere the excitement of the people rising. \"To your wards!\nTo your wards!\" Everywhere men and women in blue were hurrying from\nunknown subterranean employments, up the staircases of the middle path;\nat one place Graham saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee\nbesieged by a crowd of shouting men, at another a couple of men in the\nhated yellow uniform of the Labour Police, pursued by a gathering crowd,\nfled precipitately along the swift way that went in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nThe cries of \"To your wards!\" became at last a continuous shouting as\nthey drew near the Government quarter. Many of the shouts were\nunintelligible. \"Ostrog has betrayed us,\" one man bawled in a hoarse\nvoice, again and again, dinning that refrain into Graham's ear until it\nhaunted him. This person stayed close beside Graham and Asano on the\nswift way, shouting to the people who swarmed on the lower platforms as\nhe rushed past them. His cry about Ostrog alternated with some\nincomprehensible orders. Presently he went leaping down and disappeared.\n\nGraham's mind was filled with the din. His plans were vague and unformed.\nHe had one picture of some commanding position from which he could\naddress the multitudes, another of meeting Ostrog face to face. He was\nfull of rage, of tense muscular excitement, his hands gripped, his lips\nwere pressed together.\n\nThe way to the Council House across the ruins was impassable, but Asano\nmet that difficulty and took Graham into the premises of the central\npost-office. The post-office was nominally at work, but the blue-clothed\nporters moved sluggishly or had stopped to stare through the arches of\ntheir galleries at the shouting men who were going by outside. \"Every man\nto his ward! Every man to his ward!\" Here, by Asano's advice, Graham\nrevealed his identity.\n\nThey crossed to the Council House by a cable cradle. Already in the brief\ninterval since the capitulation of the Councillors a great change had\nbeen wrought in the appearance of the ruins. The spurting cascades of the\nruptured sea-water mains had been captured and tamed, and huge temporary\npipes ran overhead along a flimsy looking fabric of girders. The sky was\nlaced with restored cables and wires that served the Council House, and a\nmass of new fabric with cranes and other building machines going to and\nfro upon it projected to the left of the white pile.\n\nThe moving ways that ran across this area had been restored, albeit for\nonce running under the open sky. These were the ways that Graham had seen\nfrom the little balcony in the hour of his awakening, not nine days\nsince, and the hall of his Trance had been on the further side, where now\nshapeless piles of smashed and shattered masonry were heaped together.\n\nIt was already high day and the sun was shining brightly. Out of their\ntall caverns of blue electric light came the swift ways crowded with\nmultitudes of people, who poured off them and gathered ever denser over\nthe wreckage and confusion of the ruins. The air was full of their\nshouting, and they were pressing and swaying towards the central\nbuilding. For the most part that shouting mass consisted of shapeless\nswarms, but here and there Graham could see that a rude discipline\nstruggled to establish itself. And every voice clamoured for order in the\nchaos. \"To your wards! Every man to his ward!\"\n\nThe cable carried them into a hall which Graham recognised as the\nante-chamber to the Hall of the Atlas, about the gallery of which he had\nwalked days ago with Howard to show himself to the Vanished Council, an\nhour from his awakening. Now the place was empty except for two cable\nattendants. These men seemed hugely astonished to recognise the Sleeper\nin the man who swung down from the cross seat.\n\n\"Where is Ostrog?\" he demanded. \"I must see Ostrog forthwith. He has\ndisobeyed me. I have come back to take things out of his hands.\" Without\nwaiting for Asano, he went straight across the place, ascended the steps\nat the further end, and, pulling the curtain aside, found himself facing\nthe perpetually labouring Titan.\n\nThe hall was empty. Its appearance had changed very greatly since his\nfirst sight of it. It had suffered serious injury in the violent\nstruggle of the first outbreak. On the right hand side of the great\nfigure the upper half of the wall had been torn away for nearly two\nhundred feet of its length, and a sheet of the same glassy film that had\nenclosed Graham at his awakening had been drawn across the gap. This\ndeadened, but did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside.\n\"Wards! Wards! Wards!\" they seemed to be saying. Through it there were\nvisible the beams and supports of metal scaffoldings that rose and fell\naccording to the requirements of a great crowd of workmen. An idle\nbuilding machine, with lank arms of red painted metal stretched gauntly\nacross this green tinted picture. On it were still a number of workmen\nstaring at the crowd below. For a moment he stood regarding these\nthings, and Asano overtook him.\n\n\"Ostrog,\" said Asano, \"will be in the small offices beyond there.\" The\nlittle man looked livid now and his eyes searched Graham's face.\n\nThey had scarcely advanced ten paces from the curtain before a little\npanel to the left of the Atlas rolled up, and Ostrog, accompanied by\nLincoln and followed by two black and yellow clad negroes, appeared\ncrossing the remote corner of the hall, towards a second panel that was\nraised and open. \"Ostrog,\" shouted Graham, and at the sound of his voice\nthe little party turned astonished.\n\nOstrog said something to Lincoln and advanced alone.\n\nGraham was the first to speak. His voice was loud and dictatorial. \"What\nis this I hear?\" he asked. \"Are you bringing negroes here--to keep the\npeople down?\"\n\n\"It is none too soon,\" said Ostrog. \"They have been getting out of hand\nmore and more, since the revolt. I under-estimated--\"\n\n\"Do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the way?\"\n\n\"On the way. As it is, you have seen the people--outside?\"\n\n\"No wonder! But--after what was said. You have taken too much on\nyourself, Ostrog.\"\n\nOstrog said nothing, but drew nearer.\n\n\"These negroes must not come to London,\" said Graham. \"I am Master and\nthey shall not come.\"\n\nOstrog glanced at Lincoln, who at once came towards them with his two\nattendants close behind him. \"Why not?\" asked Ostrog.\n\n\"White men must be mastered by white men. Besides--\"\n\n\"The negroes are only an instrument.\"\n\n\"But that is not the question. I am the Master. I mean to be the Master.\nAnd I tell you these negroes shall not come.\"\n\n\"The people--\"\n\n\"I believe in the people.\"\n\n\"Because you are an anachronism. You are a man out of the Past--an\naccident. You are Owner perhaps of the world. Nominally--legally. But you\nare not Master. You do not know enough to be Master.\"\n\nHe glanced at Lincoln again. \"I know now what you think--I can guess\nsomething of what you mean to do. Even now it is not too late to warn\nyou. You dream of human equality--of some sort of socialistic order--you\nhave all those worn-out dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and vivid\nin your mind, and you would rule this age that you do not understand.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Graham. \"You can hear it--a sound like the sea. Not\nvoices--but a voice. Do _you_ altogether understand?\"\n\n\"We taught them that,\" said Ostrog.\n\n\"Perhaps. Can you teach them to forget it? But enough of this! These\nnegroes must not come.\"\n\nThere was a pause and Ostrog looked him in the eyes.\n\n\"They will,\" he said.\n\n\"I forbid it,\" said Graham.\n\n\"They have started.\"\n\n\"I will not have it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ostrog. \"Sorry as I am to follow the method of the\nCouncil--. For your own good--you must not side with--Disorder. And now\nthat you are here--. It was kind of you to come here.\"\n\nLincoln laid his hand on Graham's shoulder. Abruptly Graham realised the\nenormity of his blunder in coming to the Council House. He turned\ntowards the curtains that separated the hall from the ante-chamber. The\nclutching hand of Asano intervened. In another moment Lincoln had\ngrasped Graham's cloak.\n\nHe turned and struck at Lincoln's face, and incontinently a negro had him\nby collar and arm. He wrenched himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and\nhe stumbled back, to be tripped by the other attendant. Then he struck\nthe ground heavily and he was staring at the distant ceiling of the hall.\n\nHe shouted, rolled over, struggling fiercely, clutched an attendant's leg\nand threw him headlong, and struggled to his feet.\n\nLincoln appeared before him, went down heavily again with a blow under\nthe point of the jaw and lay still. Graham made two strides, stumbled.\nAnd then Ostrog's arm was round his neck, he was pulled over backward,\nfell heavily, and his arms were pinned to the ground. After a few violent\nefforts he ceased to struggle and lay staring at Ostrog's heaving throat.\n\n\"You--are--a prisoner,\" panted Ostrog, exulting. \"You--were rather a\nfool--to come back.\"\n\nGraham turned his head about and perceived through the irregular green\nwindow in the walls of the hall the men who had been working the building\ncranes gesticulating excitedly to the people below them. They had seen!\n\nOstrog followed his eyes and started. He shouted something to Lincoln,\nbut Lincoln did not move. A bullet smashed among the mouldings above the\nAtlas. The two sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched\nacross this gap were rent, the edges of the torn aperture darkened,\ncurved, ran rapidly towards the framework, and in a moment the Council\nchamber stood open to the air. A chilly gust blew in by the gap, bringing\nwith it a war of voices from the ruinous spaces without, an elvish\nbabblement, \"Save the Master!\" \"What are they doing to the Master?\" \"The\nMaster is betrayed!\"\n\nAnd then he realised that Ostrog's attention was distracted, that\nOstrog's grip had relaxed, and, wrenching his arms free, he struggled to\nhis knees. In another moment he had thrust Ostrog back, and he was on one\nfoot, his hand gripping Ostrog's throat, and Ostrog's hands clutching the\nsilk about his neck.\n\nBut now men were coming towards them from the dais--men whose intentions\nhe misunderstood. He had a glimpse of someone running in the distance\ntowards the curtains of the antechamber, and then Ostrog had slipped from\nhim and these newcomers were upon him. To his infinite astonishment, they\nseized him. They obeyed the shouts of Ostrog.\n\nHe was lugged a dozen yards before he realised that they were not\nfriends--that they were dragging him towards the open panel. When he saw\nthis he pulled back, he tried to fling himself down, he shouted for help\nwith all his strength. And this time there were answering cries.\n\nThe grip upon his neck relaxed, and behold! in the lower corner of the\nrent upon the wall, first one and then a number of little black figures\nappeared shouting and waving arms. They came leaping down from the gap\ninto the light gallery that had led to the Silent Rooms. They ran along\nit, so near were they that Graham could see the weapons in their hands.\nThen Ostrog was shouting in his ear to the men who held him, and once\nmore he was struggling with all his strength against their endeavours to\nthrust him towards the opening that yawned to receive him. \"They can't\ncome down,\" panted Ostrog. \"They daren't fire. It's all right. We'll save\nhim from them yet.\"\n\nFor long minutes as it seemed to Graham that inglorious struggle\ncontinued. His clothes were rent in a dozen places, he was covered in\ndust, one hand had been trodden upon. He could hear the shouts of his\nsupporters, and once he heard shots. He could feel his strength giving\nway, feel his efforts wild and aimless. But no help came, and surely,\nirresistibly, that black, yawning opening came nearer.\n\nThe pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up. He saw Ostrog's grey\nhead receding and perceived that he was no longer held. He turned about\nand came full into a man in black. One of the green weapons cracked close\nto him, a drift of pungent smoke came into his face, and a steel blade\nflashed. The huge chamber span about him.\n\nHe saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black and yellow attendants\nnot three yards from his face. Then hands were upon him again.\n\nHe was being pulled in two directions now. It seemed as though people\nwere shouting to him. He wanted to understand and could not. Someone was\nclutching about his thighs, he was being hoisted in spite of his vigorous\nefforts. He understood suddenly, he ceased to struggle. He was lifted up\non men's shoulders and carried away from that devouring panel. Ten\nthousand throats were cheering.\n\nHe saw men in blue and black hurrying after the retreating Ostrogites\nand firing. Lifted up, he saw now across the whole expanse of the hall\nbeneath the Atlas image, saw that he was being carried towards the\nraised platform in the centre of the place. The far end of the hall was\nalready full of people running towards him. They were looking at him\nand cheering.\n\nHe became aware that a bodyguard surrounded him. Active men about him\nshouted vague orders. He saw close at hand the black moustached man in\nyellow who had been among those who had greeted him in the public\ntheatre, shouting directions. The hall was already densely packed with\nswaying people, the little metal gallery sagged with a shouting load, the\ncurtains at the end had been torn away, and the antechamber was revealed\ndensely crowded. He could scarcely make the man near him hear for the\ntumult about them. \"Where has Ostrog gone?\" he asked.\n\nThe man he questioned pointed over the heads towards the lower panels\nabout the hall on the side opposite the gap. They stood open, and armed\nmen, blue clad with black sashes, were running through them and vanishing\ninto the chambers and passages beyond. It seemed to Graham that a sound\nof firing drifted through the riot. He was carried in a staggering curve\nacross the great hall towards an opening beneath the gap.\n\nHe perceived men working with a sort of rude discipline to keep the crowd\noff him, to make a space clear about him. He passed out of the hall, and\nsaw a crude, new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue sky. He\nwas swung down to his feet; someone gripped his arm and guided him. He\nfound the man in yellow close at hand. They were taking him up a narrow\nstairway of brick, and close at hand rose the great red painted masses,\nthe cranes and levers and the still engines of the big building machine.\n\nHe was at the top of the steps. He was hurried across a narrow railed\nfootway, and suddenly with a vast shouting the amphitheatre of ruins\nopened again before him. \"The Master is with us! The Master! The Master!\"\nThe shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave, broke against the\ndistant cliff of ruins, and came back in a welter of cries. \"The Master\nis on our side!\"\n\nGraham perceived that he was no longer encompassed by people, that he was\nstanding upon a little temporary platform of white metal, part of a\nflimsy seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of the Council\nHouse. Over all the huge expanse of the ruins swayed and eddied the\nshouting people; and here and there the black banners of the\nrevolutionary societies ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of\norganisation in the chaos. Up the steep stairs of wall and scaffolding by\nwhich his rescuers had reached the opening in the Atlas Chamber clung a\nsolid crowd, and little energetic black figures clinging to pillars and\nprojections were strenuous to induce these congested, masses to stir.\nBehind him, at a higher point on the scaffolding, a number of men\nstruggled upwards with the flapping folds of a huge black standard.\nThrough the yawning gap in the walls below him he could look down upon\nthe packed attentive multitudes in the Hall of the Atlas. The distant\nflying stages to the south came out bright and vivid, brought nearer as\nit seemed by an unusual translucency of the air. A solitary monoplane\nbeat up from the central stage as if to meet the coming aeroplanes.\n\n\"What has become of Ostrog?\" asked Graham, and even as he spoke he saw\nthat all eyes were turned from him towards the crest of the Council House\nbuilding. He looked also in this direction of universal attention. For a\nmoment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of a wall, hard and clear\nagainst the sky. Then in the shadow he perceived the interior of a room\nand recognised with a start the green and white decorations of his former\nprison. And coming quickly across this opened room and up to the very\nverge of the cliff of the ruins came a little white clad figure followed\nby two other smaller seeming figures in black and yellow. He heard the\nman beside him exclaim \"Ostrog,\" and turned to ask a question. But he\nnever did, because of the startled exclamation of another of those who\nwere with him and a lank finger suddenly pointing. He looked, and behold!\nthe monoplane that had been rising from the flying stage when last he had\nlooked in that direction, was driving towards them. The swift steady\nflight was still novel enough to hold his attention.\n\nNearer it came, growing rapidly larger and larger, until it had swept\nover the further edge of the ruins and into view of the dense multitudes\nbelow. It drooped across the space and rose and passed overhead, rising\nto clear the mass of the Council House, a filmy translucent shape with\nthe solitary aeronaut peering down through its ribs. It vanished beyond\nthe skyline of the ruins.\n\nGraham transferred his attention to Ostrog. He was signalling with his\nhands, and his attendants were busy breaking down the wall beside him. In\nanother moment the monoplane came into view again, a little thing far\naway, coming round in a wide curve and going slower.\n\nThen suddenly the man in yellow shouted: \"What are they doing? What are\nthe people doing? Why is Ostrog left there? Why is he not captured? They\nwill lift him--the monoplane will lift him! Ah!\"\n\nThe exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins. The rattling sound\nof the green weapons drifted across the intervening gulf to Graham, and,\nlooking down, he saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running along\none of the galleries that lay open to the air below the promontory upon\nwhich Ostrog stood. They fired as they ran at men unseen, and then\nemerged a number of pale blue figures in pursuit. These minute fighting\nfigures had the oddest effect; they seemed as they ran like little model\nsoldiers in a toy. This queer appearance of a house cut open gave that\nstruggle amidst furniture and passages a quality of unreality. It was\nperhaps two hundred yards away from him, and very nearly fifty above the\nheads in the ruins below. The black and yellow men ran into an open\narchway, and turned and fired a volley. One of the blue pursuers striding\nforward close to the edge, flung up his arms, staggered sideways, seemed\nto Graham's sense to hang over the edge for several seconds, and fell\nheadlong down. Graham saw him strike a projecting corner, fly out, head\nover heels, head over heels, and vanish behind the red arm of the\nbuilding machine.\n\nAnd then a shadow came between Graham and the sun. He looked up and the\nsky was clear, but he knew the little monoplane had passed. Ostrog had\nvanished. The man in yellow thrust before him, zealous and perspiring,\npointing and blatant.\n\n\"They are grounding!\" cried the man in yellow. \"They are grounding. Tell\nthe people to fire at him. Tell them to fire at him!\"\n\nGraham could not understand. He heard loud voices repeating these\nenigmatical orders.\n\nSuddenly he saw the prow of the monoplane come gliding over the edge of\nthe ruins and stop with a jerk. In a moment Graham understood that the\nthing had grounded in order that Ostrog might escape by it. He saw a blue\nhaze climbing out of the gulf, perceived that the people below him were\nnow firing up at the projecting stem.\n\nA man beside him cheered hoarsely, and he saw that the blue rebels had\ngained the archway that had been contested by the men in black and\nyellow a moment before, and were running in a continual stream along the\nopen passage.\n\nAnd suddenly the monoplane slipped over the edge of the Council House and\nfell like a diving swallow. It dropped, tilting at an angle of forty-five\ndegrees, so steeply that it seemed to Graham, it seemed perhaps to most\nof those below, that it could not possibly rise again.\n\nIt fell so closely past him that he could see Ostrog clutching the guides\nof the seat, with his grey hair streaming; see the white-faced aeronaut\nwrenching over the lever that turned the machine upward. He heard the\napprehensive vague cry of innumerable men below.\n\nGraham clutched the railing before him and gasped. The second seemed an\nage. The lower vane of the monoplane passed within an ace of touching the\npeople, who yelled and screamed and trampled one another below.\n\nAnd then it rose.\n\nFor a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear the opposite\ncliff, and then that it could not possibly clear the wind-wheel that\nrotated beyond.\n\nAnd behold! it was clear and soaring, still heeling sideways, upward,\nupward into the wind-swept sky.\n\nThe suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of exasperation as the\nswarming people realised that Ostrog had escaped them. With belated\nactivity they renewed their fire, until the rattling wove into a roar,\nuntil the whole area became dim and blue and the air pungent with the\nthin smoke of their weapons.\n\nToo late! The flying machine dwindled smaller and smaller, and curved\nabout and swept gracefully downward to the flying stage from which it had\nso lately risen. Ostrog had escaped.\n\nFor a while a confused babblement arose from the ruins, and then the\nuniversal attention came back to Graham, perched high among the\nscaffolding. He saw the faces of the people turned towards him, heard\ntheir shouts at his rescue. From the throat of the ways came the song of\nthe revolt spreading like a breeze across that swaying sea of men.\n\nThe little group of men about him shouted congratulations on his escape.\nThe man in yellow was close to him, with a set face and shining eyes. And\nthe song was rising, louder and louder; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.\n\nSlowly the realisation came of the full meaning of these things to him,\nthe perception of the swift change in his position. Ostrog, who had stood\nbeside him whenever he had faced that shouting multitude before, was\nbeyond there--the antagonist. There was no one to rule for him any\nlonger. Even the people about him, the leaders and organisers of the\nmultitude, looked to see what he would do, looked to him to act, awaited\nhis orders. He was king indeed. His puppet reign was at an end.\n\nHe was very intent to do the thing that was expected of him. His nerves\nand muscles were quivering, his mind was perhaps a little confused, but\nhe felt neither fear nor anger. His hand that had been trodden upon\nthrobbed and was hot. He was a little nervous about his bearing. He knew\nhe was not afraid, but he was anxious not to seem afraid. In his former\nlife he had often been more excited in playing games of skill. He was\ndesirous of immediate action, he knew he must not think too much in\ndetail of the huge complexity of the struggle about him lest be should be\nparalysed by the sense of its intricacy.\n\nOver there those square blue shapes, the flying stages, meant Ostrog;\nagainst Ostrog, who was so clear and definite and decisive, he who was so\nvague and undecided, was fighting for the whole future of the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nGRAHAM SPEAKS HIS WORD\n\n\nFor a time the Master of the Earth was not even master of his own mind.\nEven his will seemed a will not his own, his own acts surprised him and\nwere but a part of the confusion of strange experiences that poured\nacross his being. These things were definite, the negroes were coming,\nHelen Wotton had warned the people of their coming, and he was Master of\nthe Earth. Each of these facts seemed struggling for complete possession\nof his thoughts. They protruded from a background of swarming halls,\nelevated passages, rooms jammed with ward leaders in council,\nkinematograph and telephone rooms, and windows looking out on a seething\nsea of marching men. The men in yellow, and men whom he fancied were\ncalled Ward Leaders, were either propelling him forward or following him\nobediently; it was hard to tell. Perhaps they were doing a little of\nboth. Perhaps some power unseen and unsuspected propelled them all. He\nwas aware that he was going to make a proclamation to the People of the\nEarth, aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind as the\nthing he meant to say. Many little things happened, and then he found\nhimself with the man in yellow entering a little room where this\nproclamation of his was to be made.\n\nThis room was grotesquely latter-day in its appointments. In the centre\nwas a bright oval lit by shaded electric lights from above. The rest was\nin shadow, and the double finely fitting doors through which he came from\nthe swarming Hall of the Atlas made the place very still. The dead thud\nof these as they closed behind him, the sudden cessation of the tumult in\nwhich he had been living for hours, the quivering circle of light, the\nwhispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely visible attendants in\nthe shadows, had a strange effect upon Graham. The huge ears of a\nphonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words, the black eyes\nof great photographic cameras awaited his beginning, beyond metal rods\nand coils glittered dimly, and something whirled about with a droning\nhum. He walked into the centre of the light, and his shadow drew together\nblack and sharp to a little blot at his feet.\n\nThe vague shape of the thing he meant to say was already in his mind. But\nthis silence, this isolation, the withdrawal from that contagious crowd,\nthis audience of gaping, glaring machines, had not been in his\nanticipation. All his supports seemed withdrawn together; he seemed to\nhave dropped into this suddenly, suddenly to have discovered himself. In\na moment he was changed. He found that he now feared to be inadequate, he\nfeared to be theatrical, he feared the quality of his voice, the quality\nof his wit; astonished, he turned to the man in yellow with a\npropitiatory gesture. \"For a moment,\" he said, \"I must wait. I did not\nthink it would be like this. I must think of the thing I have to say.\"\n\nWhile he was still hesitating there came an agitated messenger with news\nthat the foremost aeroplanes were passing over Madrid.\n\n\"What news of the flying stages?\" he asked.\n\n\"The people of the south-west wards are ready.\"\n\n\"Ready!\"\n\nHe turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses again.\n\n\"I suppose it must be a sort of speech. Would to God I knew certainly the\nthing that should be said! Aeroplanes at Madrid! They must have started\nbefore the main fleet.\n\n\"Oh! what can it matter whether I speak well or ill?\" he said, and felt\nthe light grow brighter.\n\nHe had framed some vague sentence of democratic sentiment when suddenly\ndoubts overwhelmed him. His belief in his heroic quality and calling he\nfound had altogether lost its assured conviction. The picture of a\nlittle strutting futility in a windy waste of incomprehensible\ndestinies replaced it. Abruptly it was perfectly clear to him that this\nrevolt against Ostrog was premature, foredoomed to failure, the impulse\nof passionate inadequacy against inevitable things. He thought of that\nswift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop of Fate towards him. He was\nastonished that he could have seen things in any other light. In that\nfinal emergency he debated, thrust debate resolutely aside, determined\nat all costs to go through with the thing he had undertaken. And he\ncould find no word to begin. Even as he stood, awkward, hesitating,\nwith an indiscreet apology for his inability trembling on his lips,\ncame the noise of many people crying out, the running to and fro of\nfeet. \"Wait,\" cried someone, and a door opened. Graham turned, and the\nwatching lights waned.\n\nThrough the open doorway he saw a slight girlish figure approaching. His\nheart leapt. It was Helen Wotton. The man in yellow came out of the\nnearer shadows into the circle of light.\n\n\"This is the girl who told us what Ostrog had done,\" he said.\n\nShe came in very quietly, and stood still, as if she did not want to\ninterrupt Graham's eloquence.... But his doubts and questionings fled\nbefore her presence. He remembered the things that he had meant to say.\nHe faced the cameras again and the light about him grew brighter. He\nturned back to her.\n\n\"You have helped me,\" he said lamely--\"helped me very much.... This is\nvery difficult.\"\n\nHe paused. He addressed himself to the unseen multitudes who stared upon\nhim through those grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly.\n\n\"Men and women of the new age,\" he said; \"you have arisen to do battle\nfor the race!... There is no easy victory before us.\"\n\nHe stopped to gather words. He wished passionately for the gift of\nmoving speech.\n\n\"This night is a beginning,\" he said. \"This battle that is coming, this\nbattle that rushes upon us to-night, is only a beginning. All your lives,\nit may be, you must fight. Take no thought though I am beaten, though I\nam utterly overthrown. I think I may be overthrown.\"\n\nHe found the thing in his mind too vague for words. He paused\nmomentarily, and broke into vague exhortations, and then a rush of speech\ncame upon him. Much that he said was but the humanitarian commonplace of\na vanished age, but the conviction of his voice touched it to vitality.\nHe stated the case of the old days to the people of the new age, to the\ngirl at his side.\n\n\"I come out of the past to you,\" he said, \"with the memory of an age\nthat hoped. My age was an age of dreams--of beginnings, an age of noble\nhopes; throughout the world we had made an end of slavery; throughout the\nworld we had spread the desire and anticipation that wars might cease,\nthat all men and women might live nobly, in freedom and peace.... So we\nhoped in the days that are past. And what of those hopes? How is it with\nman after two hundred years?\n\n\"Great cities, vast powers, a collective greatness beyond our dreams. For\nthat we did not work, and that has come. But how is it with the little\nlives that make up this greater life? How is it with the common lives? As\nit has ever been--sorrow and labour, lives cramped and unfulfilled, lives\ntempted by power, tempted by wealth, and gone to waste and folly. The old\nfaiths have faded and changed, the new faith--. Is there a new faith?\n\n\"Charity and mercy,\" he floundered; \"beauty and the love of beautiful\nthings--effort and devotion! Give yourselves as I would give myself--as\nChrist gave Himself upon the Cross. It does not matter if you understand.\nIt does not matter if you seem to fail. You _know_--in the core of your\nhearts you _know_. There is no promise, there is no security--nothing to\ngo upon but Faith. There is no faith but faith--faith which is\ncourage....\"\n\nThings that he had long wished to believe, he found that he believed. He\nspoke gustily, in broken incomplete sentences, but with all his heart and\nstrength, of this new faith within him. He spoke of the greatness of\nself-abnegation, of his belief in an immortal life of Humanity in which\nwe live and move and have our being. His voice rose and fell, and the\nrecording appliances hummed as he spoke, dim attendants watched him out\nof the shadow....\n\nHis sense of that silent spectator beside him sustained his sincerity.\nFor a few glorious moments he was carried away; he felt no doubt of his\nheroic quality, no doubt of his heroic words, he had it all straight and\nplain. His eloquence limped no longer. And at last he made an end to\nspeaking. \"Here and now,\" he cried, \"I make my will. All that is mine in\nthe world I give to the people of the world. All that is mine in the\nworld I give to the people of the world. To all of you. I give it to you,\nand myself I give to you. And as God wills to-night, I will live for you,\nor I will die.\"\n\nHe ended. He found the light of his present exaltation reflected in the\nface of the girl. Their eyes met; her eyes were swimming with tears of\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"I knew,\" she whispered. \"Oh! Father of the World--_Sire_! I knew you\nwould say these things....\"\n\n\"I have said what I could,\" he answered lamely and grasped and clung to\nher outstretched hands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nWHILE THE AEROPLANES WERE COMING\n\n\nThe man in yellow was beside them. Neither had noted his coming. He was\nsaying that the south-west wards were marching. \"I never expected it so\nsoon,\" he cried. \"They have done wonders. You must send them a word to\nhelp them on their way.\"\n\nGraham stared at him absent-mindedly. Then with a start he returned to\nhis previous preoccupation about the flying stages.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That is good, that is good.\" He weighed a message. \"Tell\nthem;--well done South West.\"\n\nHe turned his eyes to Helen Wotton again. His face expressed his struggle\nbetween conflicting ideas. \"We must capture the flying stages,\" he\nexplained. \"Unless we can do that they will land negroes. At all costs we\nmust prevent that.\"\n\nHe felt even as he spoke that this was not what had been in his mind\nbefore the interruption. He saw a touch of surprise in her eyes. She\nseemed about to speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice.\n\nIt occurred to Graham that she expected him to lead these marching\npeople, that that was the thing he had to do. He made the offer abruptly.\nHe addressed the man in yellow, but he spoke to her. He saw her face\nrespond. \"Here I am doing nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"It is impossible,\" protested the man in yellow. \"It is a fight in a\nwarren. Your place is here.\"\n\nHe explained elaborately. He motioned towards the room where Graham must\nwait, he insisted no other course was possible. \"We must know where you\nare,\" he said. \"At any moment a crisis may arise needing your presence\nand decision.\"\n\nA picture had drifted through his mind of such a vast dramatic struggle\nas the masses in the ruins had suggested. But here was no spectacular\nbattle-field such as he imagined. Instead was seclusion--and suspense. It\nwas only as the afternoon wore on that he pieced together a truer picture\nof the fight that was raging, inaudibly and invisibly, within four miles\nof him, beneath the Roehampton stage. A strange and unprecedented contest\nit was, a battle that was a hundred thousand little battles, a battle in\na sponge of ways and channels, fought out of sight of sky or sun under\nthe electric glare, fought out in a vast confusion by multitudes\nuntrained in arms, led chiefly by acclamation, multitudes dulled by\nmindless labour and enervated by the tradition of two hundred years of\nservile security against multitudes demoralised by lives of venial\nprivilege and sensual indulgence. They had no artillery, no\ndifferentiation into this force or that; the only weapon on either side\nwas the little green metal carbine, whose secret manufacture and sudden\ndistribution in enormous quantities had been one of Ostrog's culminating\nmoves against the Council. Few had had any experience with this weapon,\nmany had never discharged one, many who carried it came unprovided with\nammunition; never was wilder firing in the history of warfare. It was a\nbattle of amateurs, a hideous experimental warfare, armed rioters\nfighting armed rioters, armed rioters swept forward by the words and fury\nof a song, by the tramping sympathy of their numbers, pouring in\ncountless myriads towards the smaller ways, the disabled lifts, the\ngalleries slippery with blood, the halls and passages choked with smoke,\nbeneath the flying stages, to learn there when retreat was hopeless the\nancient mysteries of warfare. And overhead save for a few sharpshooters\nupon the roof spaces and for a few bands and threads of vapour that\nmultiplied and darkened towards the evening, the day was a clear\nserenity. Ostrog it seems had no bombs at command and in all the earlier\nphases of the battle the flying machines played no part. Not the smallest\ncloud was there to break the empty brilliance of the sky. It seemed as\nthough it held itself vacant until the aeroplanes should come.\n\nEver and again there was news of these, drawing nearer, from this Spanish\ntown and then that, and presently from France. But of the new guns that\nOstrog had made and which were known to be in the city came no news in\nspite of Graham's urgency, nor any report of successes from the dense\nfelt of fighting strands about the flying stages. Section after section\nof the Labour-Societies reported itself assembled, reported itself\nmarching, and vanished from knowledge into the labyrinth of that warfare.\nWhat was happening there? Even the busy ward leaders did not know. In\nspite of the opening and closing of doors, the hasty messengers, the\nringing of bells and the perpetual clitter-clack of recording implements,\nGraham felt isolated, strangely inactive, inoperative.\n\nHis isolation seemed at times the strangest, the most unexpected of all\nthe things that had happened since his awakening. It had something of\nthe quality of that inactivity that comes in dreams. A tumult, the\nstupendous realisation of a world struggle between Ostrog and himself,\nand then this confined quiet little room with its mouthpieces and bells\nand broken mirror!\n\nNow the door would be closed and Graham and Helen were alone together;\nthey seemed sharply marked off then from all the unprecedented world\nstorm that rushed together without, vividly aware of one another, only\nconcerned with one another. Then the door would open again, messengers\nwould enter, or a sharp bell would stab their quiet privacy, and it was\nlike a window in a well built brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a\nhurricane. The dark hurry and tumult, the stress and vehemence of the\nbattle rushed in and overwhelmed them. They were no longer persons but\nmere spectators, mere impressions of a tremendous convulsion. They became\nunreal even to themselves, miniatures of personality, indescribably\nsmall, and the two antagonistic realities, the only realities in being\nwere first the city, that throbbed and roared yonder in a belated frenzy\nof defence and secondly the aeroplanes hurling inexorably towards them\nover the round shoulder of the world.\n\nThere came a sudden stir outside, a running to and fro, and cries. The\ngirl stood up, speechless, incredulous.\n\nMetallic voices were shouting \"Victory!\" Yes it was \"Victory!\"\n\nBursting through the curtains appeared the man in yellow, startled and\ndishevelled with excitement, \"Victory,\" he cried, \"victory! The people\nare winning. Ostrog's people have collapsed.\"\n\nShe rose. \"Victory?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Graham. \"Tell me! _What_?\"\n\n\"We have driven them out of the under galleries at Norwood, Streatham is\nafire and burning wildly, and Roehampton is ours. _Ours_!--and we have\ntaken the monoplane that lay thereon.\"\n\nA shrill bell rang. An agitated grey-headed man appeared from the room of\nthe Ward Leaders. \"It is all over,\" he cried.\n\n\"What matters it now that we have Roehampton? The aeroplanes have been\nsighted at Boulogne!\"\n\n\"The Channel!\" said the man in yellow. He calculated swiftly.\n\"Half an hour.\"\n\n\"They still have three of the flying stages,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Those guns?\" cried Graham.\n\n\"We cannot mount them--in half an hour.\"\n\n\"Do you mean they are found?\"\n\n\"Too late,\" said the old man.\n\n\"If we could stop them another hour!\" cried the man in yellow.\n\n\"Nothing can stop them now,\" said the old man. \"They have near a hundred\naeroplanes in the first fleet.\"\n\n\"Another hour?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"To be so near!\" said the Ward Leader. \"Now that we have found\nthose guns. To be so near--. If once we could get them out upon the\nroof spaces.\"\n\n\"How long would that take?\" asked Graham suddenly.\n\n\"An hour--certainly.\"\n\n\"Too late,\" cried the Ward Leader, \"too late.\"\n\n\"_Is_ it too late?\" said Graham. \"Even now--. An hour!\"\n\nHe had suddenly perceived a possibility. He tried to speak calmly, but\nhis face was white. \"There is are chance. You said there was a\nmonoplane--?\"\n\n\"On the Roehampton stage, Sire.\"\n\n\"Smashed?\"\n\n\"No. It is lying crossways to the carrier. It might be got upon the\nguides--easily. But there is no aeronaut--.\"\n\nGraham glanced at the two men and then at Helen. He spoke after a long\npause. \"_We_ have no aeronauts?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\nHe turned suddenly to Helen. His decision was made. \"I must do it.\"\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Go to this flying stage--to this machine.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I am an aeronaut. After all--. Those days for which you reproached me\nwere not altogether wasted.\"\n\nHe turned to the old man in yellow. \"Tell them to put it upon the\nguides.\"\n\nThe man in yellow hesitated.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" cried Helen.\n\n\"This monoplane--it is a chance--.\"\n\n\"You don't mean--?\"\n\n\"To fight--yes. To fight in the air. I have thought before--. A big\naeroplane is a clumsy thing. A resolute man--!\"\n\n\"But--never since flying began--\" cried the man in yellow.\n\n\"There has been no need. But now the time has come. Tell them now--send\nthem my message--to put it upon the guides. I see now something to do. I\nsee now why I am here!\"\n\nThe old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow nodded, and\nhurried out.\n\nHelen made a step towards Graham. Her face was white. \"But, Sire!--How\ncan one fight? You will be killed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Yet, not to do it--or to let some one else attempt it--.\"\n\n\"You will be killed,\" she repeated.\n\n\"I've said my word. Do you not see? It may save--London!\"\n\nHe stopped, he could speak no more, he swept the alternative aside by a\ngesture, and they stood looking at one another.\n\nThey were both clear that he must go. There was no step back from these\ntowering heroisms.\n\nHer eyes brimmed with tears. She came towards him with a curious movement\nof her hands, as though she felt her way and could not see; she seized\nhis hand and kissed it.\n\n\"To wake,\" she cried, \"for this!\"\n\nHe held her clumsily for a moment, and kissed the hair of her bowed head,\nand then thrust her away, and turned towards the man in yellow.\n\nHe could not speak. The gesture of his arm said \"Onward.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE COMING OF THE AEROPLANES\n\n\nTwo men in pale blue were lying in the irregular line that stretched\nalong the edge of the captured Roehampton stage from end to end, grasping\ntheir carbines and peering into the shadows of the stage called Wimbledon\nPark. Now and then they spoke to one another. They spoke the mutilated\nEnglish of their class and period. The fire of the Ostrogites had\ndwindled and ceased, and few of the enemy had been seen for some time.\nBut the echoes of the fight that was going on now far below in the lower\ngalleries of that stage, came every now and then between the staccato of\nshots from the popular side. One of these men was describing to the other\nhow he had seen a man down below there dodge behind a girder, and had\naimed at a guess and hit him cleanly as he dodged too far. \"He's down\nthere still,\" said the marksman. \"See that little patch. Yes. Between\nthose bars.\"\n\nA few yards behind them lay a dead stranger, face upward to the sky, with\nthe blue canvas of his jacket smouldering in a circle about the neat\nbullet hole on his chest. Close beside him a wounded man, with a leg\nswathed about, sat with an expressionless face and watched the progress\nof that burning. Behind them, athwart the carrier lay the captured\nmonoplane.\n\n\"I can't see him _now_,\" said the second man in a tone of provocation.\n\nThe marksman became foul-mouthed and high-voiced in his earnest\nendeavour to make things plain. And suddenly, interrupting him, came a\nnoisy shouting from the substage.\n\n\"What's going on now?\" he said, and raised himself on one arm to survey\nthe stairheads in the central groove of the stage. A number of blue\nfigures were coming up these, and swarming across the stage.\n\n\"We don't want all these fools,\" said his friend. \"They only crowd up and\nspoil shots. What are they after?\"\n\n\"Ssh!--they're shouting something.\"\n\nThe two men listened. The new-comers had crowded densely about the\nmachine. Three Ward Leaders, conspicuous by their black mantles and\nbadges, clambered into the body and appeared above it. The rank and file\nflung themselves upon the vans, gripping hold of the edges, until the\nentire outline of the thing was manned, in some places three deep. One of\nthe marksmen knelt up. \"They're putting it on the carrier--that's what\nthey're after.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, his friend rose also. \"What's the good?\" said his\nfriend. \"We've got no aeronauts.\"\n\n\"That's what they're doing anyhow.\" He looked at his rifle, looked at the\nstruggling crowd, and suddenly turned to the wounded man. \"Mind these,\nmate,\" he said, handing his carbine and cartridge belt; and in a moment\nhe was running towards the monoplane. For a quarter of an hour he was\nlugging, thrusting, shouting and heeding shouts, and then the thing was\ndone, and he stood with a multitude of others cheering their own\nachievement. By this time he knew, what indeed everyone in the city knew,\nthat the Master, raw learner though he was, intended to fly this machine\nhimself, was coming even now to take control of it, would let no other\nman attempt it.\n\n\"He who takes the greatest danger, he who bears the heaviest burden,\nthat man is King,\" so the Master was reported to have spoken. And even as\nthis man cheered, and while the beads of sweat still chased one another\nfrom the disorder of his hair, he heard the thunder of a greater tumult,\nand in fitful snatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song. He\nsaw through a gap in the people that a thick stream of heads still poured\nup the stairway. \"The Master is coming,\" shouted voices, \"the Master is\ncoming,\" and the crowd about him grew denser and denser. He began to\nthrust himself towards the central groove. \"The Master is coming!\" \"The\nSleeper, the Master!\" \"God and the Master!\" roared the voices.\n\nAnd suddenly quite close to him were the black uniforms of the\nrevolutionary guard, and for the first and last time in his life he saw\nGraham, saw him quite nearly. A tall, dark man in a flowing black robe he\nwas, with a white, resolute face and eyes fixed steadfastly before him; a\nman who for all the little things about him had neither ears nor eyes nor\nthoughts....\n\nFor all his days that man remembered the passing of Graham's bloodless\nface. In a moment it had gone and he was fighting in the swaying crowd. A\nlad weeping with terror thrust against him, pressing towards the\nstairways, yelling \"Clear for the start, you fools!\" The bell that\ncleared the flying stage became a loud unmelodious clanging.\n\nWith that clanging in his ears Graham drew near the monoplane, marched\ninto the shadow of its tilting wing. He became aware that a number of\npeople about him were offering to accompany him, and waved their offers\naside. He wanted to think how one started the engine. The bell clanged\nfaster and faster, and the feet of the retreating people roared faster\nand louder. The man in yellow was assisting him to mount through the ribs\nof the body. He clambered into the aeronaut's place, fixing himself very\ncarefully and deliberately. What was it? The man in yellow was pointing\nto two small flying machines driving upward in the southern sky. No doubt\nthey were looking for the coming aeroplanes. That--presently--the thing\nto do now was to start. Things were being shouted at him, questions,\nwarnings. They bothered him. He wanted to think about the machine, to\nrecall every item of his previous experience. He waved the people from\nhim, saw the man in yellow dropping off through the ribs, saw the crowd\ncleft down the line of the girders by his gesture.\n\nFor a moment he was motionless, staring at the levers, the wheel by which\nthe engine shifted, and all the delicate appliances of which he knew so\nlittle. His eye caught a spirit level with the bubble towards him, and he\nremembered something, spent a dozen seconds in swinging the engine\nforward until the bubble floated in the centre of the tube. He noted that\nthe people were not shouting, knew they watched his deliberation. A\nbullet smashed on the bar above his head. Who fired? Was the line clear\nof people? He stood up to see and sat down again.\n\nIn another second the propeller was spinning and he was rushing down the\nguides. He gripped the wheel and swung the engine back to lift the stem.\nThen it was the people shouted. In a moment he was throbbing with the\nquiver of the engine, and the shouts dwindled swiftly behind, rushed down\nto silence. The wind whistled over the edges of the screen, and the world\nsank away from him very swiftly.\n\nThrob, throb, throb--throb, throb, throb; up he drove. He fancied\nhimself free of all excitement, felt cool and deliberate. He lifted the\nstem still more, opened one valve on his left wing and swept round and\nup. He looked down with a steady head, and up. One of the Ostrogite\nmonoplanes was driving across his course, so that he drove obliquely\ntowards it and would pass below it at a steep angle. Its little\naeronauts were peering down at him. What did they mean to do? His mind\nbecame active. One, he saw held a weapon pointing, seemed prepared to\nfire. What did they think he meant to do? In a moment he understood\ntheir tactics, and his resolution was taken. His momentary lethargy was\npast. He opened two more valves to his left, swung round, end on to this\nhostile machine, closed his valves, and shot straight at it, stem and\nwind-screen shielding him from the shot. They tilted a little as if to\nclear him. He flung up his stem.\n\nThrob, throb, throb--pause--throb, throb--he set his teeth, his face into\nan involuntary grimace, and crash! He struck it! He struck upward beneath\nthe nearer wing.\n\nVery slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to broaden as the impetus\nof his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then it slid\ndownward out of his sight.\n\nHe felt his stem going down, his hands tightened on the levers, whirled\nand rammed the engine back. He felt the jerk of a clearance, the nose of\nthe machine jerked upward steeply, and for a moment he seemed to be\nlying on his back. The machine was reeling and staggering, it seemed to\nbe dancing on its screw. He made a huge effort, hung for a moment on the\nlevers, and slowly the engine came forward again. He was driving upward\nbut no longer so steeply. He gasped for a moment and flung himself at the\nlevers again. The wind whistled about him. One further effort and he was\nalmost level. He could breathe. He turned his head for the first time to\nsee what had become of his antagonists. Turned back to the levers for a\nmoment and looked again. For a moment he could have believed they were\nannihilated. And then he saw between the two stages to the east was a\nchasm, and down this something, a slender edge, fell swiftly and\nvanished, as a sixpence falls down a crack.\n\nAt first he did not understand, and then a wild joy possessed him. He\nshouted at the top of his voice, an inarticulate shout, and drove higher\nand higher up the sky. Throb, throb, throb, pause, throb, throb, throb.\n\"Where was the other?\" he thought. \"They too--.\" As he looked round the\nempty heavens he had a momentary fear that this second machine had risen\nabove him, and then he saw it alighting on the Norwood stage. They had\nmeant shooting. To risk being rammed headlong two thousand feet in the\nair was beyond their latter-day courage....\n\nFor a little while he circled, then swooped in a steep descent towards\nthe westward stage. Throb throb throb, throb throb throb. The twilight\nwas creeping on apace, the smoke from the Streatham stage that had been\nso dense and dark, was now a pillar of fire, and all the laced curves of\nthe moving ways and the translucent roofs and domes and the chasms\nbetween the buildings were glowing softly now, lit by the tempered\nradiance of the electric light that the glare of the day overpowered. The\nthree efficient stages that the Ostrogites held--for Wimbledon Park was\nuseless because of the fire from Roehampton, and Streatham was a\nfurnace--were glowing with guide lights for the coming aeroplanes. As he\nswept over the Roehampton stage he saw the dark masses of the people\nthereon. He heard a clap of frantic cheering, heard a bullet from the\nWimbledon Park stage tweet through the air, and went beating up above the\nSurrey wastes. He felt a breath of wind from the southwest, and lifted\nhis westward wing as he had learnt to do, and so drove upward heeling\ninto the rare swift upper air. Whirr, whirr, whirr.\n\nUp he drove and up, to that pulsating rhythm, until the country beneath\nwas blue and indistinct, and London spread like a little map traced in\nlight, like the mere model of a city near the brim of the horizon. The\nsouthwest was a sky of sapphire over the shadowy rim of the world, and\never as he drove upward the multitude of stars increased.\n\nAnd behold! In the southward, low down and glittering swiftly nearer,\nwere two little patches of nebulous light. And then two more, and then a\nglow of swiftly driving shapes. Presently he could count them. There were\nfour and twenty. The first fleet of aeroplanes had come! Beyond appeared\na yet greater glow.\n\nHe swept round in a half circle, staring at this advancing fleet. It flew\nin a wedge-like shape, a triangular flight of gigantic phosphorescent\nshapes sweeping nearer through the lower air. He made a swift calculation\nof their pace, and spun the little wheel that brought the engine forward.\nHe touched a lever and the throbbing effort of the engine ceased. He\nbegan to fall, fell swifter and swifter. He aimed at the apex of the\nwedge. He dropped like a stone through the whistling air. It seemed\nscarce a second from that soaring moment before he struck the foremost\naeroplane.\n\nNo man of all that black multitude saw the coming of his fate, no man\namong them dreamt of the hawk that struck downward upon him out of the\nsky. Those who were not limp in the agonies of air-sickness, were craning\ntheir black necks and staring to see the filmy city that was rising out\nof the haze, the rich and splendid city to which \"Massa Boss\" had brought\ntheir obedient muscles. Bright teeth gleamed and the glossy faces shone.\nThey had heard of Paris. They knew they were to have lordly times among\nthe poor white trash.\n\nSuddenly Graham hit them.\n\nHe had aimed at the body of the aeroplane, but at the very last instant a\nbetter idea had flashed into his mind. He twisted about and struck near\nthe edge of the starboard wing with all his accumulated weight. He was\njerked back as he struck. His prow went gliding across its smooth expanse\ntowards the rim. He felt the forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him\nand his monoplane along with it, and for a moment that seemed an age he\ncould not tell what was happening. He heard a thousand throats yelling,\nand perceived that his machine was balanced on the edge of the gigantic\nfloat, and driving down, down; glanced over his shoulder and saw the\nbackbone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up. He had a\nvision through the ribs of sliding chairs, staring faces, and hands\nclutching at the tilting guide bars. The fenestrations in the further\nfloat flashed open as the aeronaut tried to right her. Beyond, he saw a\nsecond aeroplane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling\nfellow. The broad area of swaying wings seemed to jerk upward. He felt he\nhad dropped clear, that the monstrous fabric, clean overturned, hung like\na sloping wall above him.\n\nHe did not clearly understand that he had struck the side float of the\naeroplane and slipped off, but he perceived that he was flying free on\nthe down glide and rapidly nearing earth. What had he done? His heart\nthrobbed like a noisy engine in his throat and for a perilous instant he\ncould not move his levers because of the paralysis of his hands. He\nwrenched the levers to throw his engine back, fought for two seconds\nagainst the weight of it, felt himself righting, driving horizontally,\nset the engine beating again.\n\nHe looked upward and saw two aeroplanes glide shouting far overhead,\nlooked back, and saw the main body of the fleet opening out and rushing\nupward and outward; saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on and strike\nlike a gigantic knife-blade along the wind-wheels below it.\n\nHe put down his stern and looked again. He drove up heedless of his\ndirection as he watched. He saw the wind-vanes give, saw the huge fabric\nstrike the earth, saw its downward vanes crumple with the weight of its\ndescent, and then the whole mass turned over and smashed, upside down,\nupon the sloping wheels. Then from the heaving wreckage a thin tongue of\nwhite fire licked up towards the zenith. He was aware of a huge mass\nflying through the air towards him, and turned upwards just in time to\nescape the charge--if it was a charge--of a second aeroplane. It whirled\nby below, sucked him down a fathom, and nearly turned him over in the\ngust of its close passage.\n\nHe became aware of three others rushing towards him, aware of the urgent\nnecessity of beating above them. Aeroplanes were all about him, circling\nwildly to avoid him, as it seemed. They drove past him, above, below,\neastward and westward. Far away to the westward was the sound of a\ncollision, and two falling flares. Far away to the southward a second\nsquadron was coming. Steadily he beat upward. Presently all the\naeroplanes were below him, but for a moment he doubted the height he had\nof them, and did not swoop again. And then he came down upon a second\nvictim and all its load of soldiers saw him coming. The big machine\nheeled and swayed as the fear-maddened men scrambled to the stern for\ntheir weapons. A score of bullets sung through the air, and there flashed\na star in the thick glass wind-screen that protected him. The aeroplane\nslowed and dropped to foil his stroke, and dropped too low. Just in time\nhe saw the wind-wheels of Bromley hill rushing up towards him, and spun\nabout and up as the aeroplane he had chased crashed among them. All its\nvoices wove into a felt of yelling. The great fabric seemed to be\nstanding on end for a second among the heeling and splintering vans, and\nthen it flew to pieces. Huge splinters came flying through the air, its\nengines burst like shells. A hot rush of flame shot overhead into the\ndarkling sky.\n\n\"_Two_!\" he cried, with a bomb from overhead bursting as it fell, and\nforthwith he was beating up again. A glorious exhilaration possessed him\nnow, a giant activity. His troubles about humanity, about his inadequacy,\nwere gone for ever. He was a man in battle rejoicing in his power.\nAeroplanes seemed radiating from him in every direction, intent only upon\navoiding him, the yelling of their packed passengers came in short gusts\nas they swept by. He chose his third quarry, struck hastily and did but\nturn it on edge. It escaped him, to smash against the tall cliff of\nLondon wall. Flying from that impact he skimmed the darkling ground so\nnearly he could see a frightened rabbit bolting up a slope. He jerked up\nsteeply, and found himself driving over south London with the air about\nhim vacant. To the right of him a wild riot of signal rockets from the\nOstrogites banged tumultuously in the sky. To the south the wreckage of\nhalf a dozen air ships flamed, and east and west and north they fled\nbefore him. They drove away to the east and north, and went about in the\nsouth, for they could not pause in the air. In their present confusion\nany attempt at evolution would have meant disastrous collisions.\n\nHe passed two hundred feet or so above the Roehampton stage. It was black\nwith people and noisy with their frantic shouting. But why was the\nWimbledon Park stage black and cheering, too? The smoke and flame of\nStreatham now hid the three further stages. He curved about and rose to\nsee them and the northern quarters. First came the square masses of\nShooter's Hill into sight, from behind the smoke, lit and orderly with\nthe aeroplane that had landed and its disembarking negroes. Then came\nBlackheath, and then under the corner of the reek the Norwood stage. On\nBlackheath no aeroplane had landed. Norwood was covered by a swarm of\nlittle figures running to and fro in a passionate confusion. Why?\nAbruptly he understood. The stubborn defence of the flying stages was\nover, the people were pouring into the under-ways of these last\nstrongholds of Ostrog's usurpation. And then, from far away on the\nnorthern border of the city, full of glorious import to him, came a\nsound, a signal, a note of triumph, the leaden thud of a gun. His lips\nfell apart, his face was disturbed with emotion.\n\nHe drew an immense breath. \"They win,\" he shouted to the empty air; \"the\npeople win!\" The sound of a second gun came like an answer. And then he\nsaw the monoplane on Blackheath was running down its guides to launch. It\nlifted clean and rose. It shot up into the air, driving straight\nsouthward and away from him.\n\nIn an instant it came to him what this meant. It must needs be Ostrog\nin flight. He shouted and dropped towards it. He had the momentum of\nhis elevation and fell slanting down the air and very swiftly. It rose\nsteeply at his approach. He allowed for its velocity and drove\nstraight upon it.\n\nIt suddenly became a mere flat edge, and behold! he was past it, and\ndriving headlong down with all the force of his futile blow.\n\nHe was furiously angry. He reeled the engine back along its shaft and\nwent circling up. He saw Ostrog's machine beating up a spiral before\nhim. He rose straight towards it, won above it by virtue of the impetus\nof his swoop and by the advantage and weight of a man. He dropped\nheadlong--dropped and missed again! As he rushed past he saw the face of\nOstrog's aeronaut confident and cool and in Ostrog's attitude a wincing\nresolution. Ostrog was looking steadfastly away from him--to the south.\nHe realized with a gleam of wrath how bungling his flight must be. Below\nhe saw the Croydon hills. He jerked upward and once more he gained on\nhis enemy.\n\nHe glanced over his shoulder and his attention was arrested. The\neastward stage, the one on Shooter's Hill, appeared to lift; a flash\nchanging to a tall grey shape, a cowled figure of smoke and dust, jerked\ninto the air. For a moment this cowled figure stood motionless, dropping\nhuge masses of metal from its shoulders, and then it began to uncoil a\ndense head of smoke. The people had blown it up, aeroplane and all! As\nsuddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang up from the Norwood stage.\nAnd even as he stared at this came a dead report; and the air wave of the\nfirst explosion struck him. He was flung up and sideways.\n\nFor a moment his monoplane fell nearly edgewise with her nose down, and\nseemed to hesitate whether to overset altogether. He stood on his\nwind-shield, wrenching the wheel that swayed up over his head. And then\nthe shock of the second explosion took his machine sideways.\n\nHe found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his machine, and the\nair was blowing past him and _upward_. He seemed to be hanging quite\nstill in the air, with the wind blowing up past him. It occurred to him\nthat he was falling. Then he was sure that he was falling. He could not\nlook down.\n\nHe found himself recapitulating with incredible swiftness all that had\nhappened since his awakening, the days of doubt, the days of Empire, and\nat last the tumultuous discovery of Ostrog's calculated treachery.\n\nThe vision had a quality of utter unreality. Who was he? Why was he\nholding so tightly with his hands? Why could he not let go? In such\na fall as this countless dreams have ended. But in a moment he\nwould wake....\n\nHis thoughts ran swifter and swifter. He wondered if he should see Helen\nagain. It seemed so unreasonable that he should not see her again. It\n_must_ be a dream! Yet surely he would meet her. She at least was real.\nShe was real. He would wake and meet her.\n\nAlthough he could not look at it, he was suddenly aware that the earth\nwas very near.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Sleeper Awakes, by H.G.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n"}
