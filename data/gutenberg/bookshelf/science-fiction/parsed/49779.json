You're--\"\n\n\"Sheddap!\" Molock said to Wilkerson. He turned again to the Venusian,\nShad Brisbee. \"You heard what I said. If you want to try to start\ncarving on me with one of those frog stickers you've got stuck in your\nbelt, hop right to it. But remember, by Harry, while you're doing your\ncarving, I'm going to be doing a little light whittling myself.\"\n\nExcept for the needle pistol in his pocket, Molock was unarmed. Lifting\nhands as big as hams, he looked Shad Brisbee square in all of the\nVenusian's eyes that happened to be turned toward him at the moment.\nMolock had the full attention of all six of those eyes. The expression\non Shad Brisbee's face indicated that if he had had six more eyes, he\nwould have been concentrating all of them on the antics of this mad\nhuman.\n\nShad Brisbee was seven feet tall, he must have weighed close to 300\npounds. Molock's six feet, 185 pound frame was a pygmy beside the\nVenusian. Shad Brisbee fingered the knives in his belt as if he was\nconsidering accepting Molock's invitation, then suddenly spread his\nhands. Protesting sound bellowed out of him.\n\n\"But you 'ave landed right in the middle of our dancing ground!\"\n\n\"Then by Harry! dance somewhere else!\" Molock shouted.\n\nI thought at first that Shad Brisbee was going to explode. He puffed\nhimself up until he looked to be eight feet tall. Indignation turned\nhim green. Each of his six eyes turned yellow and he glared at Molock\nout of all of them.\n\n\"Molock, his dancing ground is sacred!\" Wilkerson croaked.\n\n\"And to me, staying alive is sacred,\" Molock answered. \"Which is the\nsacredest, my staying alive or his dancing ground?\"\n\n\"But the way you're acting now, you're going to get us all killed!\"\nWilkerson screamed.\n\n\"Am I?\" Molock answered. \"Watch this!\" He turned again to Shad Brisbee.\n\"Listen, you six-eyed baboon. We landed in the middle of your dancing\nground by accident but we're going to stay right where we are as long\nas we damn well please. Get it? _We're going to stay here as long as we\ndamn well please._ And neither you nor any other of your six-eyed tribe\nis going to do anything about it.\"\n\nI was holding my breath. Wilkerson looked as if he was about to faint.\nOnly Rita seemed to be enjoying this scene. Perhaps she had illusions\nthat two brawny giants were battling for her, which was a big mistake\non her part. Shad Brisbee wouldn't have had her, or any other human\nwoman, in his harem as a gift. If she was inspiring Molock to put on\nhis act, then maybe he was battling for her sake. I had the impression\nthat if Wilkerson had thought that she was inspiring Molock to this\nact, the captain would have drowned her in the nearest mudhole,\npublicity department or no publicity department. And I would have\nhelped him.\n\nShad Brisbee puffed himself up until he looked as if he weighed 400\npounds. He fingered his knives in his belt, shifted his weight on his\nbare splayed feet. He extended two of his eyes and looked backward at\nthe jungle behind him as if he was desperately hoping that some of his\ntribe would turn up to help him dispose of this brash human. The other\nfour eyes continued to glare at Molock.\n\n\"There's none of your tribe around to help you,\" Molock stated, waving\nhis fists. \"It's just you and me.\"\n\nShad Brisbee shifted uncomfortably. He didn't know quite what to make\nof us. We were humans. Since he was a \"tame\" Venusian, he knew quite\na lot about humans. We had landed right in the middle of the huge\ncleared space that his tribe used as a dancing ground. This in itself\nwas sufficient reason for him to destroy us utterly. Each of his six\neyes revealed quite clearly that he longed to destroy us and that only\nMolock was keeping him from doing it.\n\n\"Well?\" Molock said, waving his fists. \"If you're ready to start\ngetting that square meal, I'm ready to start eating my lunch.\"\n\nShad Brisbee took a deep breath. Somewhere inside of him he made up his\nmind.\n\n\"It is all right for you to land on our dancing ground,\" he said. The\nway he spoke, the words hurt him.\n\nWilkerson, Rita, Molock, and I all beamed.\n\n\"But you must be gone in one zonar!\" Shad Brisbee snarled. \"Or I will\ntear you all to pieces with my own bare hands.\" Saying these words\ndidn't hurt him. He enjoyed every one of them. Judging from the way\nhis hands worked as he spoke, he would enjoy even more translating his\nwords into action. \"Be gone in one zonar--or else!\" Turning, he stalked\ninto the jungle.\n\nI quit breathing again. The smile went from Wilkerson's face. Rita\nlooked a little perturbed. Only Molock was unconcerned even though he\nknew that a zonar was less than an hour and he wouldn't be gone from\nthis place in two weeks, and then only if we were lucky.\n\n\"Did you see me out-bluff him?\" Molock said, grinning. \"Did you see me\nrun a sandy on that six-eyed idiot?\"\n\n\"You were marvelous, simply marvelous,\" Rita murmured.\n\n\"Oh, hell!\" Wilkerson shouted. If there had been a stone wall handy for\nhim to butt his head against, I'm sure he would have felt much better.\n\"Yaas, you bluffed him. You bluffed him so goddamned good that we'll\nall be dead before we get out of this place. Remember, this is his\ncountry, this is his tribal dancing ground--\"\n\n\"Captain, I'm sure you are taking much too negative a view,\" Rita\ninterrupted.\n\nSince she was a woman, Wilkerson couldn't slug her. But woman or not,\nhe looked as if he was about to do it.\n\n\"I'm not taking nearly as negative a view as Shad Brisbee will take\nwhen he comes back and wants his dancing ground,\" Wilkerson said,\nbitterly.\n\nFor a moment, Molock looked worried.\n\n\"You were yelling for a light lunch,\" Wilkerson said. \"You may find you\nhave bitten off more than you can chew. Now I'm going into that ship\nand get headquarters on the radio and see if I can get some help out\nhere in time to save our necks. In the meantime, by thunder, you get\nready to take care of Shad Brisbee.\"\n\nTurning, Wilkerson stalked toward the ship. Indignation bristled in\nevery step he took. We followed him with reluctance.\n\nBeneath my breath I cursed Trans-Space, Inc., its publicity department,\nand George Cooper. Cooper was head of the publicity department. It was\nhis brilliant idea that had landed us here in the middle of Venus,\nwhere Shad Brisbee was giving us one zonar to get off of his dancing\nground--or else.\n\nOf course, you know that Trans-Space, Inc., has a monopoly on carrying\npassengers and freight to and from Venus, but what you probably don't\nknow is that from the financial end, things have been a little tough\nfor the company. Now don't go getting your sympathy aroused about this\npoor suffering corporation being down to its last billion credits. Let\nTrans-Space sympathize with itself, it's quite capable of doing the job\nvery competently. It is also capable of hiring boys like George Cooper\nto help it sympathize with itself. Cooper had dreamed up the idea\nthat the way to help the financial situation was to encourage human\ncolonizing on Venus. If they could get several thriving human colonies\nsettled on the Veiled Planet, the line would not only pick up revenue\nfrom transporting the colonists to Venus but it would also pick up some\nprofitable freight business. In the long run, they foresaw a very happy\nincrease in traffic.\n\nOne joker they ran into right from the start was that nobody but a\ndamned fool wanted to go to Venus and argue with six-eyed apes like\nShad Brisbee over the rights to their dancing grounds. Also, nobody\nwanted to put up with the fog flies and the flying snakes and the\nwhat-nots.\n\nCooper knew how to change all that. \"We'll make films, write books,\npublish pamphlets--all of them emphasizing the good points of Venus.\nWe'll make this planet look and sound like a seed catalogue. We'll soon\nhave thousands, maybe millions of people, coming here. Build Venus up.\nMake people see Venus maybe not quite as good as heaven but at least as\nwonderful as Eden!\"\n\nThis was where Wilkerson and Molock and Rita Morgan and yours truly,\nSam Crane got into the act. Rita, who was the apple of Cooper's eye,\ngot the assignment of taking the three dimensional movies in full color\nand full sound that would make Venus attractive. Of course, on the\nsound side we had Cooper's permission to dub out the screams of any\nVenusian getting swallowed by a forty-foot boa constrictor. Wilkerson,\nMolock, and I were included to fly the ship and help Rita.\n\nIn other words, it was our job to dig up the raw material that the\npublicity department could use to sell a bill of goods to suckers back\non Earth who could be flim-flammed into making the big hop to Venus.\n\nIn getting these pictures of Eden in the Sky, we had hunted up the\ntamest of all tame Venusians, Shad Brisbee. We knew him, he knew us.\nTo my mind, the fact that he knew us was not to our advantage. In\nsome ways, I would have preferred taking our pictures among some of\nthe wilder tribes, who didn't know us. But Know-All George Cooper had\ndecided that the tame Shad Brisbee was just the lad for us. He had\nloaded the ship with trade goods and had told us where to go. All of\nthis might have worked out fine, if we had not damaged the drive and\nhad to make a forced landing right in the middle of Shad Brisbee's\ntribal dancing ground.\n\nYou may not know it, but these Venusians are funny about dancing. They\ndon't go in for cultural amusements, there isn't a ball park or a\nlibrary on the planet, a pin ball machine, a golf course, or anything\nelse that might make life more cultivated. But every Venusian has his\nprivate dancing ground and every tribe has a big one. For amusement,\nthe Venusians dance. They dance in the morning and in the afternoon.\nThey dance to celebrate the beginning of a spell of wet weather and\nthe end of it. The male Venusians dance as their squaws go out in the\nmorning to gather fruits and vegetables, they dance in the afternoon\nwhen the squaws come home. At night, the squaws join in and everybody,\nbig and little, old and young, dances.\n\nThey hold elaborate contests to determine who is the best tribal\ndancer. He's the chief, the big shot, the boss. They hold contests\nbetween tribes, everybody gets drunk, everybody dances. Personally,\nI'll say one thing for the Venusians, it always seemed to me that\ndancing contests were a better way to settle personal and tribal\nproblems than war, but the Venusians are just benighted, ignorant\nnatives with no knowledge of the finer things of life. This doesn't\nmean they can't and won't fight--they fight alligators and flying\nsnakes and blue tigers--but they just don't fight each other. Any\npersonal or private quarrels they settle by dancing it out.\n\nI've heard learned professors from Earth lecture on the vast\nsatisfaction to be derived from expressing the kinesthetic sense, the\nrapture that goes with movements of the body, the sweet pure flame\nof mood expressed by body movement and gesture. All of this may mean\nsomething, to the professors. So far as I'm concerned, the Venusians\njust like to dance.\n\nIf you want to start a ruckus--and but good--just suggest to one of the\nmales that things would be a lot better around the home place if he\nspent more of his time working and less dancing. If you want to start a\nreal fracas, just come between a Venusian and his dancing. Hell hath no\nfury--\n\nI know, this is not the way it is written up in the books. The authors\nusually speak of the \"quaint\" Venusian dancing customs, but this is the\nway it is.\n\nShad Brisbee might be a tame Venusian to the publicity department, but\nwhen we landed right in the middle of his tribe's dancing ground, you\ncould guarantee he would revert to the wild state.\n\nWith Wilkerson stamping the ground ahead of us, we moved toward the\nship.\n\n_Whuuuuuup!_\n\nAn arrow eight feet long came out of the jungle behind us, passed\nbetween us, whammed into the open lock of the ship ahead of us.\n\nIt beat us to our destination, but it didn't beat us much. I don't know\nwho led the way but it was my opinion that Wilkerson damned near beat\nthat arrow into the ship. Jumping into the ship, we slammed the lock.\n\n\"Whew!\" Wilkerson said, mopping sweat from his face.\n\n\"Just an arrow,\" Molock said. \"Heck, they're nothing. Shad Brisbee and\nhis boys will never get anywhere with arrows. And they haven't got any\nweapons except spears, clubs, knives.\" He sounded very comfortable\nabout the situation.\n\n\"But we haven't even got a gun, except for your spring pistol!\"\nWilkerson said. For several minutes, he spoke freely and movingly\nabout George Cooper. It had been Cooper's idea that we go unarmed.\n\"Treat these natives with friendliness and they'll treat you with\nfriendliness. No guns!\" Cooper had decreed.\n\n\"Wait until I get that damned Cooper on the radio!\" Wilkerson said,\nstalking into the control cabin.\n\n\"There won't be anything to this,\" Molock said. \"Cooper will send out a\ncouple of ships and blow these idiots to hell and gone. Or scare 'em to\ndeath. Let's go into the galley and have a beer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were starting on our second can of beer when Wilkerson stumbled into\nthe galley. He had a glazed look in his eyes and he was waving his\nhands and sort of frothing at the mouth. Snatching up the can of beer\nMolock had just opened, he drained it.\n\n\"When will the ships be here?\" Molock asked.\n\nWilkerson blew foam from his lips. \"They won't!\" he said.\n\n\"What?\" Molock gasped. \"Do you mean those dirty dogs are going to leave\nus here to be murdered by a bunch of six-eyed apes?\"\n\n\"Cooper was mad as hell because we had crash landed. He wanted to know\nwhat the hell I meant by damaging company property. From the way he\nsounded, the cost of the repairs was coming out of his lunch money.\"\n\n\"I'll kill that Cooper!\" Molock screamed. \"Doesn't he know our lives\nare in danger?\"\n\n\"He seemed to think that maintaining peaceful relations with the\nVenusians was more important than our necks,\" Wilkerson explained. \"He\nsaid that if Shad Brisbee wanted to knife us for landing on his dancing\nground, it was all right with Trans-Space and with him.\"\n\n\"But Rita is here!\" Molock raged. \"Doesn't he see he's risking the\nlife of a woman?\"\n\n\"He said that Trans-Space doesn't discriminate between its employees\nbecause of sex,\" Wilkerson answered. \"Open me another can of beer,\nsomebody. I feel faint.\"\n\n\"Let me at that radio!\" Molock screamed. \"I want to talk to that\nCooper.\"\n\nHe slammed out of the galley. While he was gone we drank beer\nvigorously. When he returned his face was ash-colored. \"What did Cooper\nsay?\" Wilkerson asked.\n\n\"He said that good publicity was more important than our necks, that if\nwe are going to bring colonists here, we have to be able to prove to\nthem how peaceful Venus is.\"\n\n\"Um,\" Wilkerson said. \"What else did the good man say?\"\n\n\"He fired me!\" Molock sounded as if he was strangling. \"He told me to\ncome in and get my pay. When I asked him how I was to get there, he\nsaid I was to walk.\"\n\n\"Um,\" Wilkerson said. \"Well, go right ahead and start walking. You\nbluffed Shad Brisbee once. You can do it again.\"\n\n\"You're as bad as Cooper!\" Molock screamed. \"Shad Brisbee would murder\nme if he caught me outside this ship. I'm not a damned Venusian, I'm\nfair game to him.\"\n\n\"Nah, he wouldn't hurt you,\" Wilkerson said, \"Hell, he's just an\nignorant native. All he's got are knives and clubs and spears and bows\nand arrows--just a native. He's easy to bluff. Hell, you're a human\nbeing. He probably looks on you as a sort of a god. At least some\nof the literature I saw one of the trained seals pounding out in the\npublicity department said the natives regarded humans as minor gods who\ncan do no wrong.\"\n\n_Whaaam!_ An arrow smashed against the plastite hull window bounced\noff. One point was definitely to our advantage. No weapon possessed by\nthe Venusians could get through the steel hull or the plastite view\nports of the ship. We were as safe as sardines in a can--unless the\nVenusians found a can opener.\n\nWe sat in the galley and morosely drank beer and considered how best to\ndraw our wills.\n\n\"Hey, look!\" Molock gasped, painting toward the plastite window.\n\nAt first glance it seemed to me that the whole Venusian race had put in\nits appearance. There were hundreds of Venusians, thousands of them,\ncoming from all directions. Shad Brisbee had called in his pals from\nmiles around and they were all heading our way.\n\nWilkerson's face went white. \"This looks like the end, boys,\" he said.\n\n\"Nah!\" Molock answered. \"They'll never get through the hull. I'll\nfigure out something.\"\n\n\"You had better get your slide rule into action. Uh! What was that?\"\n\n_That_ was the ship lurching as if it was about to turn over. From the\nports, we could see what was happening. Venusians were on both sides of\nthe ship. Those on one side were pushing while those on the other side\nwere pulling. When the ship settled back, the ones on the second side\npushed like hell, setting up a rhythmic rocking motion that was rapidly\nthreatening to turn the ship over.\n\n\"You could turn over a mountain like this!\" Wilkerson whispered, as the\nship lurched. \"My God! They're going to try to roll the whole damned\nship into the swamp.\"\n\nOn one side of Shad Brisbee's dancing ground was jungle. On the other\nside was a deep pool of muddy water. Staring at it, Wilkerson seemed to\ntalk out of a trance. \"Drowned, like rats in a trap, in my own ship!\"\nHe took a deep breath, turned to Molock. \"Go out and bluff Shad Brisbee\nnow!\"\n\nMolock also took a deep breath and rose to his feet. \"I'll just go do\nthat,\" he said, moving toward the lock.\n\nAll of us were too stunned to try to stop him.\n\nWhen he opened the outer door of the lock, the noise that came in was\nlike the howling of a forest full of baboons. But the rocking of the\nship stopped as soon as he appeared. I don't know why the Venusians\ndidn't kill him before he had a chance to open his mouth, but probably\nthey were too surprised at his appearance to take immediate action.\n\n\"I want to talk to Shad Brisbee!\" he yelled at the top of his voice.\n\nShad appeared in the throng. He looked more than seven feet tall and I\nwould have sworn he had more than six eyes. The throng grew so quiet\nyou could hear these tame Venusians slobbering as they thirsted for\nhuman blood.\n\n\"I'll dance you ... for the right ... to keep our ship ... on your\ndancing ground ... until it is repaired ...\" Molock said.\n\n\"The hopeless fool!\" Wilkerson gasped. \"The utter idiot ...\"\n\n\"You will dance _me_?\" You could have heard Shad Brisbee scream for\nmiles around. The idea appalled him, because it was a direct challenge,\nand it also appealed to him because he was absolutely certain that he,\nor any other Venusian could out-dance any human who had ever put foot\non the Veiled Planet. \"I'll do it!\" Shad Brisbee roared. \"Make room for\nthe dancers!\" His voice was a howl that shook wondering echoes out of\nthe jungle.\n\nMolock came back into the galley. \"You can't do it,\" Wilkerson gasped.\n\"These dances are endurance contests. That big baboon has done nothing\nbut dance all his life. He can dance straight into next week ...\"\n\n\"I'm stalling for time,\" Molock said. \"I want you to get on that radio\nagain and convince that damned Cooper he's got to get here and help\nus. All he has to do is swoop low in a ship over this place and these\nbaboons will take to the jungle or the swamp to dodge the rocket blast.\nTell him.\"\n\n\"I'll tell him,\" Wilkerson said grimly. \"The question is--will he act\non what I tell him.\"\n\nMolock's eyes went to Rita. \"Honey, I want you to get those cameras\ngoing and keep them going. I want this recorded for posterity, if for\nnobody else.\"\n\nRita was shaken and scared. But there was good stuff down inside that\ngirl. \"Will do,\" she whispered. She got to her feet and headed for the\nobservation dome in the top of the ship where the cameras were located.\n\nMolock turned to me. \"I've got a little job for you, Sam.\" Out of his\npocket, he slipped the little needle gun. \"I'm going to have to dance\nagainst that six-eyed baboon. When he gets to dancing real good and\neverybody is all excited, I want you to shoot him in the butt with one\nof these needles.\"\n\n\"But--\" I whispered.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Molock said. \"It won't kill him, but a couple of these\nneedles will slow him down considerably.\"\n\nI regarded the weapon with horror. \"But that means I'll have to go out\nthere where all those Venusians are!\" Maybe this wasn't a heroic thing\nto say but the thought just popped out of my mind. Anyhow, I wasn't\nfeeling very heroic.\n\n\"Yah!\" Molock said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I'll be out there,\" Molock said. \"I'll be out there dancing. All\nyou've got to do is squat on the ground.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. The word cost me a desperate effort but I said it.\n\nWe went out together....\n\nThe Venusians had already cleared a circle fifty yards in diameter.\nThey clustered around this circle like hungry dogs waiting for the\nkill. Shad Brisbee, stark naked, grinning out of all of his six\neyes, looking nine feet tall and fit to dance all month, grinned as\nhe waited. In Shad Brisbee's mind, here was a lamb being led to the\nslaughter.\n\nShad Brisbee and I had one thing in common--we both agreed on this lamb\nled to the slaughter idea.\n\nI squatted on the ground at the edge of the circle and tried to lose\nmyself between the legs of the Venusians towering over me.\n\nHave you ever seen a Venusian dance? If you haven't, you have missed\none of the weirdest sights in the solar system. They do everything in\nthe books on ballets, ball room dancing, tap dancing, they also turn\nflip-flops and walk on their hands. They do things that no human being\nwill ever believe until he sees it.\n\nAs big and as ponderous as he was, Shad Brisbee went into his act by\nturning three quick back flips.\n\nI'll give Molock credit, he could do tricks I had never guessed he\ncould do. He kept even with Shad. But within thirty minutes he was\nbeginning to pant. Going round the circle, dancing every step of the\nway, he found wind to yell at Wilkerson, who was peering from the lock.\n\n\"Any news ... from that damned Cooper?\"\n\n\"Operations contacted him ... in a bar!\" Wilkerson yelled. \"Cooper said\nyou could dance your own way out of this ...\"\n\n\"The dirty dog!\" Molock screamed.\n\nThe next time he came around the circle, waving his hands and bending\ndouble as he imitated one of Shad Brisbee's more intricate steps, he\nwhispered to me, \"Bunt him....\"\n\nKeeping the little spring gun out of sight in my hand, I waited until\nthe Venusian's back was turned to me, and pressed the trigger. The\nspring clicked softly. I caught a glint of the needle as it went home\nin Shad's backside.\n\nHe went right on dancing as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe next time he came around the circle, Molock whispered, \"Let him\nhave another one....\"\n\nAs I started to pull the trigger, the sky seemed to fall down on top of\nme. A ham-sized Venusian hand smashed me downward.\n\n\"No tricks!\" a Venusian voice snarled into my ear.\n\nThe gun was jerked away from me. About twenty-four eyes in my vicinity\nwere concentrated on me, each one glaring in its own individual way. I\nwas given to understand that if I attempted to take any further part in\nthe proceedings, I would be fed to the nearest alligator.\n\n\"What happened?\" Molock yelled, as he danced by again.\n\n\"They caught me. You'll have to out-dance him honestly.\"\n\n\"But I can't go much farther--\" He was covered with sweat and his chest\nwas heaving.\n\nI felt like the lowest kind of a dog for having let him down. Molock\nmight be an utter damned fool, but when the chips were down, he was in\nthere trying for all of us. He had built all his hopes on this trick\nwith the needle gun.\n\nCircling the dancing ground, he suddenly stopped, stood with his hands\non his hips, chest heaving.\n\n\"You give up?\" Shad Brisbee shouted. \"You quit?\"\n\n\"I do not--give up!\" Molock wheezed.\n\n\"But you have stop dancing.\"\n\n\"I have danced your way--for two zonars. Turn about is fair play. Now\nyou dance--my way.\"\n\n\"Your way?\" Astonishment showed in all of Shad Brisbee's six eyes. \"You\nhumans don't dance, you don't know how.\"\n\n\"That's where you're wrong!\" Molock answered. \"We know how to dance in\na new way--a way you stupid Venusians have never heard of.\"\n\nI didn't know whether Shad Brisbee and the others were more excited\nover the insult or the thought of a new way to dance. Dancing was the\nblood of life to them.\n\n\"No way Venusians not know!\" Shad Brisbee shouted. \"We know\n_everything_ about dancing, all steps, all--\"\n\n\"Hell, you don't know this way,\" Molock interrupted. \"I doubt if you\ncould do it even if I taught it to you.\"\n\nHe was stalling for time but as he was stalling he was getting his\nstrength back. Personally, it was my opinion that all he knew about\ndancing he had learned in a dime-a-dance hall in some space port on\nEarth, but if he wanted to teach this to the Venusians, it was all\nright with me.\n\n\"Show him to me!\" Shad Brisbee screamed. \"I can do him.\"\n\n\"All right. Watch this.\" Weaving forward with his hands up, Molock\nslugged Shad Brisbee on the jaw.\n\nThe startled Venusian almost turned a somersault as he went over\nbackward. A cry of rage arose, both from Shad and the onlookers.\n\n\"Kill the human--\"\n\n\"Slaughter him--\"\n\n\"Now you try to hit me!\" Molock ignored the cries for his blood. He\nweaved away with his fists up.\n\n\"That's not dancing!\" Shad Brisbee roared.\n\n\"It's _our_ kind of dancing, the human way to dance,\" Molock answered.\n\"Yah, you big yellow-belly, you can't do it!\"\n\nI held my breath. The hopeless idiot--or maybe genius--was trying to\nturn a dancing contest into a boxing match. And he did. Screaming, Shad\nBrisbee charged, swung a tremendous hay-maker at Molock's jaw. Dodging,\nMolock slugged him behind the ear.\n\nFor the next fifteen minutes, to my awed and thunderously appreciative\ndelight, I watched a Venusian get carved to pieces. Molock hit Shad\nBrisbee with everything up to and including his elbows and knees. He\nhit the Venusian in the gullet, the stomach, all over the head, and he\nknocked at least three eyes out of commission.\n\nIt took him exactly fifteen minutes to reduce a seven foot Venusian\ngiant to the status of a whimpering child.\n\n\"I give ... I give ...\" Shad Brisbee gasped. \"You better dancer than\nme....\"\n\n\"You will allow us to stay here unmolested, until we can get our ship\nrepaired?\" Molock demanded.\n\n\"Sure ... Sure ... I do that for you ... if you do one thing for me....\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Here, I whisper to you....\" Leaning forward, Shad whispered something\nin Molock's ear. The human looked a little surprised and startled.\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"It's a deal.\" Then, as if some secret thought was\npleasing him tremendously, he began to grin.\n\n\"I'll say it's a deal,\" he said.\n\n\"Boys, we go home now!\" Shad Brisbee shouted.\n\nWith awed and appreciative looks at the greatest dancer they had ever\nseen, they went streaming away from Shad Brisbee's dancing ground.\n\nAn equally awed and appreciative Wilkerson met us in the lock. Rita was\nthere too, but Rita wasn't awed. She climbed right up into Molock's\narms. \"Did you get the pics?\" he asked her.\n\n\"I got them, darling.\"\n\n\"Then we've got the world by the tail, honey. We've got the world by\nthe tail.\"\n\nIt took two weeks to get our ship repaired. During this time, Molock\nwas a mighty busy man, both taking pictures of his own selection and\nspending hours each day with Shad Brisbee. In spite of the fact that he\nhad been licked, Shad harbored no animosity. He and Molock struck up a\nbeautiful friendship.\n\nWhen we finally got the ship repaired and was about ready to take off,\na ship arrived from headquarters, carrying a most important visitor, a\nMr. George Cooper, head of publicity. Wearing beautiful clothes, his\nfingers manicured, delicately perfumed--for he was a sensitive man--he\ndescended from the lock.\n\nMolock and Shad Brisbee greeted him.\n\nCooper smiled urbanely at them.\n\n\"He wants to dance, Shad,\" Molock said. \"Try out your new step on him,\nthe one I've been teaching you.\"\n\nWith one single forearm jab, Shad Brisbee knocked Mr. Cooper clear back\ninto the ship the publicity man had just left. Then Shad turned eagerly\nto Molock.\n\n\"Tell me ... do I dance him good...?\"\n\n\"Shad,\" Molock said, beaming. \"You dance him beautiful.\"\n\nThe smile on Molock's face was a heavenly thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWell, that's about it, except for the pics, the ones Rita took of the\ndance and other carefully selected horror shots of some of the less\nbeautiful aspects of this Eden in the Sky.\n\nI understand these pics are terrific box office on Earth. All we know\nis that they're kicking credits in to us so fast that we're all getting\nrich, Wilkerson, Molock, Mrs. Molock, and me.\n\nOf course, we're not exactly trying to double-cross the publicity\ndepartment of Trans-Space, Inc., but if you are thinking of coming to\nVenus, it might be wise to see our picture first. It will give you a\nlittle more rounded view of a place that is a little short of\nHeaven ... about a couple of billion miles short of it.\n\nAnd, if you are thinking of coming to Venus, you had better take one\nother thing into consideration--the promise Molock made to Shad Brisbee\nbefore the Venusian would concede defeat in dancing. Shad made Molock\npromise to teach him this new and wonderful form of dancing that humans\nknew.\n\nMolock spent two weeks doing exactly that, which accounts for the\nenthusiastic greeting Mr. Cooper got from one of the tame Venusians.\n\nI understand this form of \"dancing\" is spreading like wild fire over\nthe Veiled Planet.\n\nIf you are thinking of going to Venus, you had better take in\nconsideration not only the fog flies, the forty foot boa constrictors,\nthe blue tigers, but the fact that every blasted Venusian native now\nconsiders himself an expert at \"human dancing\" and spends most of his\nspare time looking for humans to practice with.\n\nUnless you're fully prepared to \"dance\" with these Venusians, you had\nbetter think twice before deciding to settle on this Eden in the Sky.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Publicity Stunt, by Robert Moore Williams\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PUBLICITY STUNT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 49779.txt or 49779.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/9/7/7/49779/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
