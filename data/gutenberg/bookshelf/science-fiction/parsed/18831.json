And it's not to be expected that\n     a man would get a second chance at life. But an atomic might\n     accomplish both--_\n\n\nBlinded by the bomb-flash and numbed by the narcotic injection, he could\nnot estimate the extent of his injuries, but he knew that he was dying.\nAround him, in the darkness, voices sounded as through a thick wall.\n\n\"They mighta left mosta these Joes where they was. Half of them won't\neven last till the truck comes.\"\n\n\"No matter; so long as they're alive, they must be treated,\" another\nvoice, crisp and cultivated, rebuked. \"Better start taking names, while\nwe're waiting.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Fingers fumbled at his identity badge. \"Hartley, Allan;\nCaptain, G5, Chem. Research AN/73/D. Serial, SO-23869403J.\"\n\n\"Allan Hartley!\" The medic officer spoke in shocked surprise. \"Why, he's\nthe man who wrote 'Children of the Mist', 'Rose of Death', and\n'Conqueror's Road'!\"\n\nHe tried to speak, and must have stirred; the corpsman's voice\nsharpened.\n\n\"Major, I think he's part conscious. Mebbe I better give him 'nother\nshot.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; by all means, sergeant.\"\n\nSomething jabbed Allan Hartley in the back of the neck. Soft billows of\noblivion closed in upon him, and all that remained to him was a tiny\nspark of awareness, glowing alone and lost in a great darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Spark grew brighter. He was more than a something that merely knew\nthat it existed. He was a man, and he had a name, and a military rank,\nand memories. Memories of the searing blue-green flash, and of what he\nhad been doing outside the shelter the moment before, and memories of\nthe month-long siege, and of the retreat from the north, and memories of\nthe days before the War, back to the time when he had been little Allan\nHartley, a schoolboy, the son of a successful lawyer, in Williamsport,\nPennsylvania.\n\nHis mother he could not remember; there was only a vague impression of\nthe house full of people who had tried to comfort him for something he\ncould not understand. But he remembered the old German woman who had\nkept house for his father, afterward, and he remembered his bedroom,\nwith its chintz-covered chairs, and the warm-colored patch quilt on the\nold cherry bed, and the tan curtains at the windows, edged with dusky\nred, and the morning sun shining through them. He could almost see them,\nnow.\n\nHe blinked. He _could_ see them!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long time, he lay staring at them unbelievingly, and then he\ndeliberately closed his eyes and counted ten seconds, and as he counted,\nterror gripped him. He was afraid to open them again, lest he find\nhimself blind, or gazing at the filth and wreckage of a blasted city,\nbut when he reached ten, he forced himself to look, and gave a sigh of\nrelief. The sunlit curtains and the sun-gilded mist outside were still\nthere.\n\nHe reached out to check one sense against another, feeling the rough\nmonk's cloth and the edging of maroon silk thread. They were tangible as\nwell as visible. Then he saw that the back of his hand was unscarred.\nThere should have been a scar, souvenir of a rough-and-tumble brawl of\nhis cub reporter days. He examined both hands closely. An instant later,\nhe had sat up in bed and thrown off the covers, partially removing his\npajamas and inspecting as much of his body as was visible.\n\nIt was the smooth body of a little boy.\n\nThat was ridiculous. He was a man of forty-three; an army officer, a\nchemist, once a best-selling novelist. He had been married, and divorced\nten years ago. He looked again at his body. It was only twelve years\nold. Fourteen, at the very oldest. His eyes swept the room, wide with\nwonder. Every detail was familiar: the flower-splashed chair covers; the\ntable that served as desk and catch-all for his possessions; the\ndresser, with its mirror stuck full of pictures of aircraft. It was the\nbedroom of his childhood home. He swung his legs over the edge of the\nbed. They were six inches too short to reach the floor.\n\nFor an instant, the room spun dizzily; and he was in the grip of utter\npanic, all confidence in the evidence of his senses lost. Was he insane?\nOr delirious? Or had the bomb really killed him; was this what death was\nlike? What was that thing, about \"ye become as little children\"? He\nstarted to laugh, and his juvenile larynx made giggling sounds. They\nseemed funny, too, and aggravated his mirth. For a little while, he was\non the edge of hysteria and then, when he managed to control his\nlaughter, he felt calmer. If he were dead, then he must be a discarnate\nentity, and would be able to penetrate matter. To his relief, he was\nunable to push his hand through the bed. So he was alive; he was also\nfully awake, and, he hoped, rational. He rose to his feet and prowled\nabout the room, taking stock of its contents.\n\nThere was no calendar in sight, and he could find no newspapers or dated\nperiodicals, but he knew that it was prior to July 18, 1946. On that\nday, his fourteenth birthday, his father had given him a light .22\nrifle, and it had been hung on a pair of rustic forks on the wall. It\nwas not there now, nor ever had been. On the table, he saw a boys' book\nof military aircraft, with a clean, new dustjacket; the flyleaf was\ninscribed: _To Allan Hartley, from his father, on his thirteenth\nbirthday, 7/18 '45._ Glancing out the window at the foliage on the\ntrees, he estimated the date at late July or early August, 1945; that\nwould make him just thirteen.\n\nHis clothes were draped on a chair beside the bed. Stripping off his\npajamas, he donned shorts, then sat down and picked up a pair of\nlemon-colored socks, which he regarded with disfavor. As he pulled one\non, a church bell began to clang. St. Boniface, up on the hill, ringing\nfor early Mass; so this was Sunday. He paused, the second sock in his\nhand.\n\nThere was no question that his present environment was actual. Yet, on\nthe other hand, he possessed a set of memories completely at variance\nwith it. Now, suppose, since his environment were not an illusion,\neverything else were? Suppose all these troublesome memories were no\nmore than a dream? Why, he was just little Allan Hartley, safe in his\nroom on a Sunday morning, badly scared by a nightmare! Too much science\nfiction, Allan; too many comic books!\n\nThat was a wonderfully comforting thought, and he hugged it to him\ncontentedly. It lasted all the while he was buttoning up his shirt and\npulling on his pants, but when he reached for his shoes, it evaporated.\nEver since he had wakened, he realized, he had been occupied with\nthoughts utterly incomprehensible to any thirteen-year-old; even\nthinking in words that would have been so much Sanscrit to himself at\nthirteen. He shook his head regretfully. The just-a-dream hypothesis\nwent by the deep six.\n\nHe picked up the second shoe and glared at it as though it were\nresponsible for his predicament. He was going to have to be careful. An\nunexpected display of adult characteristics might give rise to some\nquestions he would find hard to answer credibly. Fortunately, he was an\nonly child; there would be no brothers or sisters to trip him up. Old\nMrs. Stauber, the housekeeper, wouldn't be much of a problem; even in\nhis normal childhood, he had bulked like an intellectual giant in\ncomparison to her. But his father--\n\nNow, there the going would be tough. He knew that shrewd attorney's\nmind, whetted keen on a generation of lying and reluctant witnesses.\nSooner or later, he would forget for an instant and betray himself. Then\nhe smiled, remembering the books he had discovered, in his late 'teens,\non his father's shelves and recalling the character of the openminded\nagnostic lawyer. If he could only avoid the inevitable unmasking until\nhe had a plausible explanatory theory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlake Hartley was leaving the bathroom as Allan Hartley opened his door\nand stepped into the hall. The lawyer was bare-armed and in slippers; at\nforty-eight, there was only a faint powdering of gray in his dark hair,\nand not a gray thread in his clipped mustache. The old Merry Widower,\nhimself, Allan thought, grinning as he remembered the white-haired but\nstill vigorous man from whom he'd parted at the outbreak of the War.\n\n\"'Morning, Dad,\" he greeted.\n\n\"'Morning, son. You're up early. Going to Sunday school?\"\n\nNow there was the advantage of a father who'd cut his first intellectual\ntooth on Tom Paine and Bob Ingersoll; attendance at divine services was\non a strictly voluntary basis.\n\n\"Why, I don't think so; I want to do some reading, this morning.\"\n\n\"That's always a good thing to do,\" Blake Hartley approved. \"After\nbreakfast, suppose you take a walk down to the station and get me a\n_Times_.\" He dug in his trouser pocket and came out with a half dollar.\n\"Get anything you want for yourself, while you're at it.\"\n\nAllan thanked his father and pocketed the coin.\n\n\"Mrs. Stauber'll still be at Mass,\" he suggested. \"Say I get the paper\nnow; breakfast won't be ready till she gets here.\"\n\n\"Good idea.\" Blake Hartley nodded, pleased. \"You'll have three-quarters\nof an hour, at least.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo far, he congratulated himself, everything had gone smoothly.\nFinishing his toilet, he went downstairs and onto the street, turning\nleft at Brandon to Campbell, and left again in the direction of the\nstation. Before he reached the underpass, a dozen half-forgotten\nmemories had revived. Here was a house that would, in a few years, be\ngutted by fire. Here were four dwellings standing where he had last seen\na five-story apartment building. A gasoline station and a weed-grown lot\nwould shortly be replaced by a supermarket. The environs of the station\nitself were a complete puzzle to him, until he oriented himself.\n\nHe bought a New York _Times_, glancing first of all at the date line.\nSunday, August 5, 1945; he'd estimated pretty closely. The battle of\nOkinawa had been won. The Potsdam Conference had just ended. There were\nstill pictures of the B-25 crash against the Empire State Building, a\nweek ago Saturday. And Japan was still being pounded by bombs from the\nair and shells from off-shore naval guns. Why, tomorrow, Hiroshima was\ndue for the Big Job! It amused him to reflect that he was probably the\nonly person in Williamsport who knew that.\n\nOn the way home, a boy, sitting on the top step of a front porch, hailed\nhim. Allan replied cordially, trying to remember who it was. Of course;\nLarry Morton! He and Allan had been buddies. They probably had been\nswimming, or playing Commandos and Germans, the afternoon before. Larry\nhad gone to Cornell the same year that Allan had gone to Penn State;\nthey had both graduated in 1954. Larry had gotten into some Government\nbureau, and then he had married a Pittsburgh girl, and had become\ntwelfth vice-president of her father's firm. He had been killed, in\n1968, in a plane crash.\n\n\"You gonna Sunday school?\" Larry asked, mercifully unaware of the fate\nAllan foresaw for him.\n\n\"Why, no. I have some things I want to do at home.\" He'd have to watch\nhimself. Larry would spot a difference quicker than any adult. \"Heck\nwith it,\" he added.\n\n\"Golly, I wisht I c'ld stay home from Sunday school whenever I wanted\nto,\" Larry envied. \"How about us goin' swimmin', at the Canoe Club,\n'safter?\"\n\nAllan thought fast. \"Gee, I wisht I c'ld,\" he replied, lowering his\ngrammatical sights. \"I gotta stay home, 'safter. We're expectin'\ncomp'ny; coupla aunts of mine. Dad wants me to stay home when they\ncome.\"\n\nThat went over all right. Anybody knew that there was no rational\naccounting for the vagaries of the adult mind, and no appeal from adult\ndemands. The prospect of company at the Hartley home would keep Larry\naway, that afternoon. He showed his disappointment.\n\n\"Aw, jeepers creepers!\" he blasphemed euphemistically.\n\n\"Mebbe t'morrow,\" Allan said. \"If I c'n make it. I gotta go, now; ain't\nhad breakfast yet.\" He scuffed his feet boyishly, exchanged so-longs\nwith his friend, and continued homeward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he had hoped, the Sunday paper kept his father occupied at breakfast,\nto the exclusion of any dangerous table talk. Blake Hartley was still\ndeep in the financial section when Allan left the table and went to the\nlibrary. There should be two books there to which he wanted badly to\nrefer. For a while, he was afraid that his father had not acquired them\nprior to 1945, but he finally found them, and carried them onto the\nfront porch, along with a pencil and a ruled yellow scratch pad. In his\nexperienced future--or his past-to-come--Allan Hartley had been\naccustomed to doing his thinking with a pencil. As reporter, as novelist\nplotting his work, as amateur chemist in his home laboratory, as\nscientific warfare research officer, his ideas had always been clarified\nby making notes. He pushed a chair to the table and built up the seat\nwith cushions, wondering how soon he would become used to the\nproportional disparity between himself and the furniture. As he opened\nthe books and took his pencil in his hand, there was one thing missing.\nIf he could only smoke a pipe, now!\n\nHis father came out and stretched in a wicker chair with the _Times_\nbook-review section. The morning hours passed. Allan Hartley leafed\nthrough one book and then the other. His pencil moved rapidly at times;\nat others, he doodled absently. There was no question, any more, in his\nmind, as to what or who he was. He was Allan Hartley, a man of\nforty-three, marooned in his own thirteen-year-old body, thirty years\nback in his own past. That was, of course, against all common sense, but\nhe was easily able to ignore that objection. It had been made before:\nagainst the astronomy of Copernicus, and the geography of Columbus, and\nthe biology of Darwin, and the industrial technology of Samuel Colt, and\nthe military doctrines of Charles de Gaulle. Today's common sense had a\nhabit of turning into tomorrow's utter nonsense. What he needed, right\nnow, but bad, was a theory that would explain what had happened to him.\n\nUnderstanding was beginning to dawn when Mrs. Stauber came out to\nannounce midday dinner.\n\n\"I hope you von't mind haffin' it so early,\" she apologized. \"Mein\nsister, Jennie, offer in Nippenose, she iss sick; I vant to go see her,\ndis afternoon, yet. I'll be back in blenty time to get supper, Mr.\nHartley.\"\n\n\"Hey, Dad!\" Allan spoke up. \"Why can't we get our own supper, and have a\npicnic, like? That'd be fun, and Mrs. Stauber could stay as long as she\nwanted to.\"\n\nHis father looked at him. Such consideration for others was a most\ngratifying deviation from the juvenile norm; dawn of altruism, or\nsomething. He gave hearty assent:\n\n\"Why, of course, Mrs. Stauber. Allan and I can shift for ourselves, this\nevening; can't we, Allan? You needn't come back till tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"_Ach_, t'ank you! T'ank you so mooch, Mr. Hartley.\"\n\nAt dinner, Allan got out from under the burden of conversation by\nquestioning his father about the War and luring him into a lengthy\ndissertation on the difficulties of the forthcoming invasion of Japan.\nIn view of what he remembered of the next twenty-four hours, Allan was\nsecretly amused. His father was sure that the War would run on to\nmid-1946.\n\nAfter dinner, they returned to the porch, Hartley _p\u00e8re_ smoking a cigar\nand carrying out several law books. He only glanced at these\noccasionally; for the most part, he sat and blew smoke rings, and\nwatched them float away. Some thrice-guilty felon was about to be\ntriumphantly acquitted by a weeping jury; Allan could recognize a\ncourtroom masterpiece in the process of incubation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was several hours later that the crunch of feet on the walk caused\nfather and son to look up simultaneously. The approaching visitor was a\ntall man in a rumpled black suit; he had knobby wrists and big, awkward\nhands; black hair flecked with gray, and a harsh, bigoted face. Allan\nremembered him. Frank Gutchall. Lived on Campbell Street; a religious\nfanatic, and some sort of lay preacher. Maybe he needed legal advice;\nAllan could vaguely remember some incident--\n\n\"Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Gutchall. Lovely day, isn't it?\" Blake Hartley\nsaid.\n\nGutchall cleared his throat. \"Mr. Hartley, I wonder if you could lend me\na gun and some bullets,\" he began, embarrassedly. \"My little dog's been\nhurt, and it's suffering something terrible. I want a gun, to put the\npoor thing out of its pain.\"\n\n\"Why, yes; of course. How would a 20-gauge shotgun do?\" Blake Hartley\nasked. \"You wouldn't want anything heavy.\"\n\nGutchall fidgeted. \"Why, er, I was hoping you'd let me have a little\ngun.\" He held his hands about six inches apart. \"A pistol, that I could\nput in my pocket. It wouldn't look right, to carry a hunting gun on the\nLord's day; people wouldn't understand that it was for a work of mercy.\"\n\nThe lawyer nodded. In view of Gutchall's religious beliefs, the\nobjection made sense.\n\n\"Well, I have a Colt .38-special,\" he said, \"but you know, I belong to\nthis Auxiliary Police outfit. If I were called out for duty, this\nevening, I'd need it. How soon could you bring it back?\"\n\nSomething clicked in Allan Hartley's mind. He remembered, now, what that\nincident had been. He knew, too, what he had to do.\n\n\"Dad, aren't there some cartridges left for the Luger?\" he asked.\n\nBlake Hartley snapped his fingers. \"By George, yes! I have a German\nautomatic I can let you have, but I wish you'd bring it back as soon as\npossible. I'll get it for you.\"\n\nBefore he could rise, Allan was on his feet.\n\n\"Sit still, Dad; I'll get it. I know where the cartridges are.\" With\nthat, he darted into the house and upstairs.\n\nThe Luger hung on the wall over his father's bed. Getting it down, he\ndismounted it, working with rapid precision. He used the blade of his\npocketknife to unlock the endpiece of the breechblock, slipping out the\nfiring pin and buttoning it into his shirt pocket. Then he reassembled\nthe harmless pistol, and filled the clip with 9-millimeter cartridges\nfrom the bureau drawer.\n\nThere was an extension telephone beside the bed. Finding Gutchall's\naddress in the directory, he lifted the telephone, and stretched his\nhandkerchief over the mouthpiece. Then he dialed Police Headquarters.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is Blake Hartley,\" he lied, deepening his voice and copying his\nfather's tone. \"Frank Gutchall, who lives at...take this down\"--he gave\nGutchall's address--\"has just borrowed a pistol from me, ostensibly to\nshoot a dog. He has no dog. He intends shooting his wife. Don't argue\nabout how I know; there isn't time. Just take it for granted that I do.\nI disabled the pistol--took out the firing pin--but if he finds out what\nI did, he may get some other weapon. He's on his way home, but he's on\nfoot. If you hurry, you may get a man there before he arrives, and grab\nhim before he finds out the pistol won't shoot.\"\n\n\"O. K., Mr. Hartley. We'll take care of it. Thanks.\"\n\n\"And I wish you'd get my pistol back, as soon as you can. It's something\nI brought home from the other War, and I shouldn't like to lose it.\"\n\n\"We'll take care of that, too. Thank you, Mr. Hartley.\"\n\nHe hung up, and carried the Luger and the loaded clip down to the porch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Look, Mr. Gutchall; here's how it works,\" he said, showing it to the\nvisitor. Then he slapped in the clip and yanked up on the toggle loading\nthe chamber. \"It's ready to shoot, now; this is the safety.\" He pushed\nit on. \"When you're ready to shoot, just shove it forward and up, and\nthen pull the trigger. You have to pull the trigger each time; it's\nloaded for eight shots. And be sure to put the safety back when you're\nthrough shooting.\"\n\n\"Did you load the chamber?\" Blake Hartley demanded.\n\n\"Sure. It's on safe, now.\"\n\n\"Let me see.\" His father took the pistol, being careful to keep his\nfinger out of the trigger guard, and looked at it. \"Yes, that's all\nright.\" He repeated the instructions Allan had given, stressing the\nimportance of putting the safety on after using. \"Understand how it\nworks, now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, I understand how it works. Thank you, Mr. Hartley. Thank you, too,\nyoung man.\"\n\nGutchall put the Luger in his hip pocket, made sure it wouldn't fall\nout, and took his departure.\n\n\"You shouldn't have loaded it,\" Hartley _p\u00e8re_ reproved, when he was\ngone.\n\nAllan sighed. This was it; the masquerade was over.\n\n\"I had to, to keep you from fooling with it,\" he said. \"I didn't want\nyou finding out that I'd taken out the firing pin.\"\n\n\"You what?\"\n\n\"Gutchall didn't want that gun to shoot a dog. He has no dog. He meant\nto shoot his wife with it. He's a religious maniac; sees visions, hears\nvoices, receives revelations, talks with the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost\nprobably put him up to this caper. I'll submit that any man who holds\nlong conversations with the Deity isn't to be trusted with a gun, and\nneither is any man who lies about why he wants one. And while I was at\nit, I called the police, on the upstairs phone. I had to use your name;\nI deepened my voice and talked through a handkerchief.\"\n\n\"You--\" Blake Hartley jumped as though bee-stung. \"Why did you have to\ndo that?\"\n\n\"You know why. I couldn't have told them, 'This is little Allan Hartley,\njust thirteen years old; please, Mr. Policeman, go and arrest Frank\nGutchall before he goes root-toot-toot at his wife with my pappa's\nLuger.' That would have gone over big, now, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"And suppose he really wants to shoot a dog; what sort of a mess will I\nbe in?\"\n\n\"No mess at all. If I'm wrong--which I'm not--I'll take the thump for\nit, myself. It'll pass for a dumb kid trick, and nothing'll be done. But\nif I'm right, you'll have to front for me. They'll keep your name out of\nit, but they'd give me a lot of cheap boy-hero publicity, which I don't\nwant.\" He picked up his pencil again. \"We should have the complete\nreturns in about twenty minutes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat was a ten-minute under-estimate, and it was another quarter-hour\nbefore the detective-sergeant who returned the Luger had finished\ncongratulating Blake Hartley and giving him the thanks of the\nDepartment. After he had gone, the lawyer picked up the Luger, withdrew\nthe clip, and ejected the round in the chamber.\n\n\"Well,\" he told his son, \"you were right. You saved that woman's life.\"\nHe looked at the automatic, and then handed it across the table. \"Now,\nlet's see you put that firing pin back.\"\n\nAllan Hartley dismantled the weapon, inserted the missing part, and put\nit together again, then snapped it experimentally and returned it to his\nfather. Blake Hartley looked at it again, and laid it on the table.\n\n\"Now, son, suppose we have a little talk,\" he said softly.\n\n\"But I explained everything.\" Allan objected innocently.\n\n\"You did not,\" his father retorted. \"Yesterday you'd never have thought\nof a trick like this; why, you wouldn't even have known how to take this\npistol apart. And at dinner, I caught you using language and expressing\nideas that were entirely outside anything you'd ever known before. Now,\nI want to know--and I mean this literally.\"\n\nAllan chuckled. \"I hope you're not toying with the rather medieval\nnotion of possession,\" he said.\n\nBlake Hartley started. Something very like that must have been flitting\nthrough his mind. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it\nabruptly.\n\n\"The trouble is, I'm not sure you aren't right,\" his son continued. \"You\nsay you find me--changed. When did you first notice a difference?\"\n\n\"Last night, you were still my little boy. This morning--\" Blake Hartley\nwas talking more to himself than to Allan. \"I don't know. You were\nunusually silent at breakfast. And come to think of it, there was\nsomething ... something strange ... about you when I saw you in the\nhall, upstairs.... Allan!\" he burst out, vehemently. \"What has happened\nto you?\"\n\nAllan Hartley felt a twinge of pain. What his father was going through\nwas almost what he, himself, had endured, in the first few minutes after\nwaking.\n\n\"I wish I could be sure, myself, Dad,\" he said. \"You see, when I woke,\nthis morning, I hadn't the least recollection of anything I'd done\nyesterday. August 4, 1945, that is,\" he specified. \"I was positively\nconvinced that I was a man of forty-three, and my last memory was of\nlying on a stretcher, injured by a bomb explosion. And I was equally\nconvinced that this had happened in 1975.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" His father straightened. \"Did you say nineteen _seventy_-five?\"\nHe thought for a moment. \"That's right; in 1975, you will be\nforty-three. A bomb, you say?\"\n\nAllan nodded. \"During the siege of Buffalo, in the Third World War,\" he\nsaid, \"I was a captain in G5--Scientific Warfare, General Staff. There'd\nbeen a transpolar air invasion of Canada, and I'd been sent to the front\nto check on service failures of a new lubricating oil for combat\nequipment. A week after I got there, Ottawa fell, and the retreat\nstarted. We made a stand at Buffalo, and that was where I copped it. I\nremember being picked up, and getting a narcotic injection. The next\nthing I knew, I was in bed, upstairs, and it was 1945 again, and I was\nback in my own little thirteen-year-old body.\"\n\n\"Oh, Allan, you just had a nightmare to end nightmares!\" his father\nassured him, laughing a trifle too heartily. \"That's all!\"\n\n\"That was one of the first things I thought of. I had to reject it; it\njust wouldn't fit the facts. Look; a normal dream is part of the\ndreamer's own physical brain, isn't it? Well, here is a part about two\nthousand per cent greater than the whole from which it was taken. Which\nis absurd.\"\n\n\"You mean all this Battle of Buffalo stuff? That's easy. All the radio\ncommentators have been harping on the horrors of World War III, and you\ncouldn't have avoided hearing some of it. You just have an undigested\nchunk of H. V. Kaltenborn raising hell in your subconscious.\"\n\n\"It wasn't just World War III; it was everything. My four years at high\nschool, and my four years at Penn State, and my seven years as a\nreporter on the Philadelphia Record. And my novels: '_Children of the\nMist_,' '_Rose of Death_,' '_Conqueror's Road_.' They were no kid stuff.\nWhy, yesterday I'd never even have thought of some of the ideas I used\nin my detective stories, that I published under a _nom-de-plume_. And my\nhobby, chemistry; I was pretty good at that. Patented a couple of\nprocesses that made me as much money as my writing. You think a\nthirteen-year-old just dreamed all that up? Or, here; you speak French,\ndon't you?\" He switched languages and spoke at some length in good\nconversational slang-spiced Parisian. \"Too bad you don't speak Spanish,\ntoo,\" he added, reverting to English. \"Except for a Mexican accent you\ncould cut with a machete, I'm even better there than in French. And I\nknow some German, and a little Russian.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlake Hartley was staring at his son, stunned. It was some time before\nhe could make himself speak.\n\n\"I could barely keep up with you, in French,\" he admitted. \"I can swear\nthat in the last thirteen years of your life, you had absolutely no\nchance to learn it. All right; you lived till 1975, you say. Then, all\nof a sudden, you found yourself back here, thirteen years old, in 1945.\nI suppose you remember everything in between?\" he asked. \"Did you ever\nread James Branch Cabell? Remember Florian de Puysange, in 'The High\nPlace'?\"\n\n\"Yes. You find the same idea in 'Jurgen' too,\" Allan said. \"You know,\nI'm beginning to wonder if Cabell mightn't have known something he\ndidn't want to write.\"\n\n\"But it's impossible!\" Blake Hartley hit the table with his hand, so\nhard that the heavy pistol bounced. The loose round he had ejected from\nthe chamber toppled over and started to roll, falling off the edge. He\nstooped and picked it up. \"How can you go back, against time? And the\ntime you claim you came from doesn't exist, now; it hasn't happened\nyet.\" He reached for the pistol magazine, to insert the cartridge, and\nas he did, he saw the books in front of his son. \"Dunne's 'Experiment\nwith Time,'\" he commented. \"And J. N. M. Tyrrell's 'Science and\nPsychical Phenomena.' Are you trying to work out a theory?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It encouraged Allan to see that his father had unconsciously\nadopted an adult-to-adult manner. \"I think I'm getting somewhere, too.\nYou've read these books? Well, look, Dad; what's your attitude on\nprecognition? The ability of the human mind to exhibit real knowledge,\napart from logical inference, of future events? You think Dunne is\ntelling the truth about his experiences? Or that the cases in Tyrrell's\nbook are properly verified, and can't be explained away on the basis of\nchance?\"\n\nBlake Hartley frowned. \"I don't know,\" he confessed. \"The evidence is\nthe sort that any court in the world would accept, if it concerned\nordinary, normal events. Especially the cases investigated by the\nSociety for Psychical Research: they _have_ been verified. But how can\nanybody know of something that hasn't happened yet? If it hasn't\nhappened yet, it doesn't exist, and you can't have real knowledge of\nsomething that has no real existence.\"\n\n\"Tyrrell discusses that dilemma, and doesn't dispose of it. I think I\ncan. If somebody has real knowledge of the future, then the future must\nbe available to the present mind. And if any moment other than the bare\npresent exists, then all time must be totally present; every moment must\nbe perpetually coexistent with every other moment,\" Allan said.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes. I think I see what you mean. That was Dunne's idea, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"No. Dunne postulated an infinite series of time dimensions, the entire\nextent of each being the bare present moment of the next. What I'm\npostulating is the perpetual coexistence of every moment of time in this\ndimension, just as every graduation on a yardstick exists equally with\nevery other graduation, but each at a different point in space.\"\n\n\"Well, as far as duration and sequence go, that's all right,\" the father\nagreed. \"But how about the 'Passage of Time'?\"\n\n\"Well, time _does_ appear to pass. So does the landscape you see from a\nmoving car window. I'll suggest that both are illusions of the same\nkind. We imagine time to be dynamic, because we've never viewed it from\na fixed point, but if it is totally present, then it must be static, and\nin that case, we're moving through time.\"\n\n\"That seems all right. But what's your car window?\"\n\n\"If all time is totally present, then you must exist simultaneously at\nevery moment along your individual life span,\" Allan said. \"Your\nphysical body, and your mind, and all the thoughts contained in your\nmind, each at its appropriate moment in sequence. But what is it that\nexists only at the bare moment we think of as _now_?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBlake Hartley grinned. Already, he was accepting his small son as an\nintellectual equal.\n\n\"Please, teacher; what?\"\n\n\"Your consciousness. And don't say, 'What's that?' Teacher doesn't know.\nBut we're only conscious of one moment; the illusory now. This is 'now,'\nand it was 'now' when you asked that question, and it'll be 'now' when I\nstop talking, but each is a different moment. We imagine that all those\nnows are rushing past us. Really, they're standing still, and our\nconsciousness is whizzing past them.\"\n\nHis father thought that over for some time. Then he sat up. \"Hey!\" he\ncried, suddenly. \"If some part of our ego is time-free and passes from\nmoment to moment, it must be extraphysical, because the physical body\nexists at every moment through which the consciousness passes. And if\nit's extraphysical, there's no reason whatever for assuming that it\npasses out of existence when it reaches the moment of the death of the\nbody. Why, there's logical evidence for survival, independent of any\nalleged spirit communication! You can toss out Patience Worth, and Mrs.\nOsborne Leonard's Feda, and Sir Oliver Lodge's son, and Wilfred Brandon,\nand all the other spirit-communicators, and you still have evidence.\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that,\" Allan confessed. \"I think you're right.\nWell, let's put that at the bottom of the agenda and get on with this\ntime business. You 'lose consciousness' as in sleep; where does your\nconsciousness go? I think it simply detaches from the moment at which\nyou go to sleep, and moves backward or forward along the line of\nmoment-sequence, to some prior or subsequent moment, attaching there.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't we know anything about that?\" Blake Hartley asked. \"It\nnever seems to happen. We go to sleep tonight, and it's always tomorrow\nmorning when we wake; never day-before-yesterday, or last month, or next\nyear.\"\n\n\"It never ... or almost never ... _seems_ to happen; you're right there.\nKnow why? Because if the consciousness goes forward, it attaches at a\nmoment when the physical brain contains memories of the previous,\nconsciously unexperienced, moment. You wake, remembering the evening\nbefore, because that's the memory contained in your mind at that moment,\nand back of it are memories of all the events in the interim. See?\"\n\n\"Yes. But how about backward movement, like this experience of yours?\"\n\n\"This experience of mine may not be unique, but I never heard of another\ncase like it. What usually happens is that the memories carried back by\nthe consciousness are buried in the subconscious mind. You know how\nthick the wall between the subconscious and the conscious mind is. These\ndreams of Dunne's, and the cases in Tyrrell's book, are leakage. That's\nwhy precognitions are usually incomplete and distorted, and generally\ntrivial. The wonder isn't that good cases are so few; it's surprising\nthat there are any at all.\" Allan looked at the papers in front of him.\n\"I haven't begun to theorize about how I managed to remember everything.\nIt may have been the radiations from the bomb, or the effect of the\nnarcotic, or both together, or something at this end, or a combination\nof all three. But the fact remains that my subconscious barrier didn't\nfunction, and everything got through. So, you see, I am obsessed--by my\nown future identity.\"\n\n\"And I'd been afraid that you'd been, well, taken-over by some ... some\noutsider.\" Blake Hartley grinned weakly. \"I don't mind admitting, Allan,\nthat what's happened has been a shock. But that other ... I just\ncouldn't have taken that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No. Not and stayed sane. But really, I am your son; the same entity I\nwas yesterday. I've just had what you might call an educational short\ncut.\"\n\n\"I'll say you have!\" His father laughed in real amusement. He discovered\nthat his cigar had gone out, and re-lit it. \"Here; if you can remember\nthe next thirty years, suppose you tell me when the War's going to end.\nThis one, I mean.\"\n\n\"The Japanese surrender will be announced at exactly 1901--7:01 P. M.\npresent style--on August 14. A week from Tuesday. Better make sure we\nhave plenty of grub in the house by then. Everything will be closed up\ntight till Thursday morning; even the restaurants. I remember, we had\nnothing to eat in the house but some scraps.\"\n\n\"Well! It is handy, having a prophet in the family! I'll see to it Mrs.\nStauber gets plenty of groceries in.... Tuesday a week? That's pretty\nsudden, isn't it?\"\n\n\"The Japs are going to think so,\" Allan replied. He went on to describe\nwhat was going to happen.\n\nHis father swore softly. \"You know, I've heard talk about atomic energy,\nbut I thought it was just Buck Rogers stuff. Was that the sort of bomb\nthat got you?\"\n\n\"That was a firecracker to the bomb that got me. That thing exploded a\ngood ten miles away.\"\n\nBlake Hartley whistled softly. \"And that's going to happen in thirty\nyears! You know, son, if I were you, I wouldn't like to have to know\nabout a thing like that.\" He looked at Allan for a moment. \"Please, if\nyou know, don't ever tell me when I'm going to die.\"\n\nAllan smiled. \"I can't. I had a letter from you just before I left for\nthe front. You were seventy-eight, then, and you were still hunting, and\nfishing, and flying your own plane. But I'm not going to get killed in\nany Battle of Buffalo, this time, and if I can prevent it, and I think I\ncan, there won't be any World War III.\"\n\n\"But--You say all time exists, perpetually coexistent and totally\npresent,\" his father said. \"Then it's right there in front of you, and\nyou're getting closer to it, every watch tick.\"\n\nAllan Hartley shook his head. \"You know what I remembered, when Frank\nGutchall came to borrow a gun?\" he asked. \"Well, the other time, I\nhadn't been home: I'd been swimming at the Canoe Club, with Larry\nMorton. When I got home, about half an hour from now, I found the house\nfull of cops. Gutchall talked the .38 officers' model out of you, and\ngone home; he'd shot his wife four times through the body, finished her\noff with another one back of the ear, and then used his sixth shot to\nblast his brains out. The cops traced the gun; they took a very poor\nview of your lending it to him. You never got it back.\"\n\n\"Trust that gang to keep a good gun,\" the lawyer said.\n\n\"I didn't want us to lose it, this time, and I didn't want to see you\nlose face around City Hall. Gutchalls, of course, are expendable,\" Allan\nsaid. \"But my main reason for fixing Frank Gutchall up with a padded\ncell was that I wanted to know whether or not the future could be\naltered. I have it on experimental authority that it can be. There must\nbe additional dimensions of time; lines of alternate probabilities.\nSomething like William Seabrook's witch-doctor friend's Fan-Shaped\n_Destiny_. When I brought memories of the future back to the present, I\nadded certain factors to the causal chain. That set up an entirely new\nline of probabilities. On no notice at all, I stopped a murder and a\nsuicide. With thirty years to work, I can stop a world war. I'll have\nthe means to do it, too.\"\n\n\"The means?\"\n\n\"Unlimited wealth and influence. Here.\" Allan picked up a sheet and\nhanded it to his father. \"Used properly, we can make two or three\nmillion on that, alone. A list of all the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and\nBelmont winners to 1970. That'll furnish us primary capital. Then,\nremember, I was something of a chemist. I took it up, originally, to get\nbackground material for one of my detective stories; it fascinated me,\nand I made it a hobby, and then a source of income. I'm thirty years\nahead of any chemist in the world, now. You remember _I. G.\nFarbenindustrie_? Ten years from now, we'll make them look like pikers.\"\n\nHis father looked at the yellow sheet. \"Assault, at eight to one,\" he\nsaid. \"I can scrape up about five thousand for that--Yes; in ten\nyears--Any other little operations you have in mind?\" he asked.\n\n\"About 1950, we start building a political organization, here in\nPennsylvania. In 1960, I think we can elect you President. The world\nsituation will be crucial, by that time, and we had a good-natured\nnonentity in the White House then, who let things go till war became\ninevitable. I think President Hartley can be trusted to take a strong\nline of policy. In the meantime, you can read Machiavelli.\"\n\n\"That's my little boy, talking!\"\n\nBlake Hartley said softly. \"All right, son; I'll do just what you tell\nme, and when you grow up, I'll be president.... Let's go get supper,\nnow.\"\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Time and Time Again, by Henry Beam Piper\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TIME AND TIME AGAIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18831-8.txt or 18831-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/8/3/18831/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
