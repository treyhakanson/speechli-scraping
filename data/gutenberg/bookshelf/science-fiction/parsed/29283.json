Walking awkwardly\nin the magnetic boots that held him to the black mass of meteoric\niron, he mounted a projection and stood motionless, staring moodily\naway through the vision panels of his bulky helmet into the dark\nmystery of the void.\n\nHis welding arc dangled at his belt, the electrode still glowing red.\nHe had just finished securing to this slowly-accumulated mass of iron\nhis most recent find, a meteorite the size of his head.\n\nFive perilous weeks he had labored, to collect this rugged lump of\nmetal--a jagged mass, some ten feet in diameter, composed of hundreds\nof fragments, that he had captured and welded together. His luck had\nnot been good. His findings had been heart-breakingly small; the\nspectro-flash analysis had revealed that the content of the precious\nmetals was disappointingly minute.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: The meteor or asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars\nand Jupiter, is \"mined\" by such adventurers as Thad Allen for the\nplatinum, iridium and osmium that all meteoric irons contain in small\nquantities. The meteor swarms are supposed by some astronomers to be\nfragments of a disrupted planet, which, according to Bode's Law,\nshould occupy this space.]\n\nOn the other side of this tiny sphere of hard-won treasure, his Millen\natomic rocket was sputtering, spurts of hot blue flame jetting from\nits exhaust. A simple mechanism, bolted to the first sizable fragment\nhe had captured, it drove the iron ball through space like a ship.\n\nThrough the magnetic soles of his insulated boots, Thad could feel the\nvibration of the iron mass, beneath the rocket's regular thrust. The\nmagazine of uranite fuel capsules was nearly empty, now, he reflected.\nHe would soon have to turn back toward Mars.\n\nTurn back. But how could he, with so slender a reward for his efforts?\nMeteor mining is expensive. There was his bill at Millen and Helion,\nMars, for uranite and supplies. And the unpaid last instalment on his\nOsprey suit. How could he outfit himself again, if he returned with no\nmore metal than this? There were men who averaged a thousand tons of\niron a month. Why couldn't fortune smile on him?\n\nHe knew men who had made fabulous strikes, who had captured whole\nplanetoids of rich metal, and he knew weary, white-haired men who had\nbraved the perils of vacuum and absolute cold and bullet-swift meteors\nfor hard years, who still hoped.\n\nBut sometime fortune had to smile, and then....\n\nThe picture came to him. A tower of white metal, among the low red\nhills near Helion. A slim, graceful tower of argent, rising in a\nfragrant garden of flowering Martian shrubs, purple and saffron. And a\ngirl waiting, at the silver door--a trim, slender girl in white, with\nblue eyes and hair richly brown.\n\nThad had seen the white tower many times, on his holiday tramps\nthrough the hills about Helion. He had even dared to ask if it could\nbe bought, to find that its price was an amount that he might not\namass in many years at his perilous profession. But the girl in white\nwas yet only a glorious dream....\n\n[Illustration: Gigantic claws seemed to reach out of empty air.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe strangeness of interplanetary space, and the somber mystery of it,\npressed upon him like an illimitable and deserted ocean. The sun was a\ntiny white disk on his right, hanging between rosy coronal wings; his\nnative Earth, a bright greenish point suspended in the dark gulf below\nit; Mars, nearer, smaller, a little ocher speck above the shrunken\nsun. Above him, below him, in all directions was vastness, blackness,\nemptiness. Ebon infinity, sprinkled with far, cold stars.\n\nThad was alone. Utterly alone. No man was visible, in all the supernal\nvastness of space. And no work of man--save the few tools of his\ndaring trade, and the glittering little rocket bolted to the black\niron behind him. It was terrible to think that the nearest human being\nmust be tens of millions of miles away.\n\nOn his first trips, the loneliness had been terrible, unendurable. Now\nhe was becoming accustomed to it. At least, he no longer feared that\nhe was going mad. But sometimes....\n\nThad shook himself and spoke aloud, his voice ringing hollow in his\nhuge metal helmet:\n\n\"Brace up, old top. In good company, when you're by yourself, as Dad\nused to say. Be back in Helion in a week or so, anyhow. Look up Dan\nand 'Chuck' and the rest of the crowd again, at Comet's place. What\nprice a friendly boxing match with Mason, or an evening at the\nteleview theater?\n\n\"Fresh air instead of this stale synthetic stuff! Real food, in place\nof these tasteless concentrates! A hot bath, instead of greasing\nyourself!\n\n\"Too dull out here. Life--\" He broke off, set his jaw.\n\nNo use thinking about such things. Only made it worse. Besides, how\ndid he know that a whirring meteor wasn't going to flash him out\nbefore he got back?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe drew his right arm out of the bulging sleeve of the suit, into its\nample interior, found a cigarette in an inside pocket, and lighted it.\nThe smoke swirled about in the helmet, drawn swiftly into the air\nfilters.\n\n\"Darn clever, these suits,\" he murmured. \"Food, smokes, water\ngenerator, all where you can reach them. And darned expensive, too.\nI'd better be looking for pay metal!\"\n\nHe clambered to a better position; stood peering out into space,\nsearching for the tiny gleam of sunlight on a meteoric fragment that\nmight be worth capturing for its content of precious metals. For an\nhour he scanned the black, star-strewn gulf, as the sputtering rocket\ncontinued to drive him forward.\n\n\"There she glows!\" he cried suddenly, and grinned.\n\nBefore him was a tiny, glowing fleck, that moved among the unchanging\nstars. He stared at it intensely, breathing faster in the helmet.\n\nAlways he thrilled to see such a moving gleam. What treasure it\npromised! At first sight, it was impossible to determine size or\ndistance or rate of motion. It might be ten thousand tons of rich\nmetal. A fortune! It would more probably prove to be a tiny, stony\nmass, not worth capturing. It might even be large and valuable, but\nmoving so rapidly that he could not overtake it with the power of the\ndiminutive Millen rocket.\n\nHe studied the tiny speck intently, with practised eye, as the minutes\npassed--an untrained eye would never have seen it at all, among the\nflaming hosts of stars. Skilfully he judged, from its apparent rate of\nmotion and its slow increase in brilliance, its size and distance\nfrom him.\n\n\"Must be--must be fair size,\" he spoke aloud, at length. \"A hundred\ntons, I'll bet my helmet! But scooting along pretty fast. Stretch the\nlittle old rocket to run it down.\"\n\nHe clambered back to the rocket, changed the angle of the flaming\nexhaust, to drive him directly across the path of the object ahead,\nfilled the magazine again with the little pellets of uranite, which\nwere fed automatically into the combustion chamber, and increased the\nfiring rate.\n\nThe trailing blue flame reached farther backward from the incandescent\norifice of the exhaust. The vibration of the metal sphere increased.\nThad left the sputtering rocket and went back where he could see the\nobject before him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was nearer now, rushing obliquely across his path. Would he be in\ntime to capture it as it passed, or would it hurtle by ahead of him,\nand vanish in the limitless darkness of space before his feeble rocket\ncould check the momentum of his ball of metal?\n\nHe peered at it, as it drew closer.\n\nIts surface seemed oddly bright, silvery. Not the dull black of\nmeteoric iron. And it was larger, more distant, than he had thought at\nfirst. In form, too, it seemed curiously regular, ellipsoid. It was no\njagged mass of metal.\n\nHis hopes sank, rose again immediately. Even if it were not the mass\nof rich metal for which he had prayed, it might be something as\nvaluable--and more interesting.\n\nHe returned to the rocket, adjusted the angle of the nozzle again, and\nadvanced the firing time slightly, even at the risk of a ruinous\nexplosion.\n\nWhen he returned to where he could see the hurtling object before him,\nhe saw that it was a ship. A tapering silver-green rocket-flier.\n\nOnce more his dreams were dashed. The officers of interplanetary\nliners lose no love upon the meteor miners, claiming that their\ncollected masses of metal, almost helpless, always underpowered, are\nmenaces to navigation. Thad could expect nothing from the ship save a\nheliographed warning to keep clear.\n\nBut how came a rocket-flier here, in the perilous swarms of the meteor\nbelt? Many a vessel had been destroyed by collision with an asteroid,\nin the days before charted lanes were cleared of drifting metal.\n\nThe lanes more frequently used, between Earth, Mars, Venus and\nMercury, were of course far inside the orbits of the asteroids. And\nthe few ships running to Jupiter's moons avoided them by crossing\nmillions of miles above their plane.\n\nCould it be that legendary green ship, said once to have mysteriously\nappeared, sliced up and drawn within her hull several of the primitive\nships of that day, and then disappeared forever after in the remote\nwastes of space? Absurd, of course: he dismissed the idle fancy and\nexamined the ship still more closely.\n\nThen he saw that it was turning, end over end, very slowly. That meant\nthat its gyros were stopped; that it was helpless, drifting, disabled,\npowerless to avoid hurtling meteoric stones. Had it blundered unawares\ninto the belt of swarms--been struck before the danger was realized?\nWas it a derelict, with all dead upon it?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEither the ship's machinery was completely wrecked, Thad knew, or\nthere was no one on watch. For the controls of a modern rocket-flier\nare so simple and so nearly automatic that a single man at the bridge\ncan keep a vessel upon her course.\n\nIt might be, he thought, that a meteorite had ripped open the hull,\nallowing the air to escape so quickly that the entire crew had been\nasphyxiated before any repairs could be made. But that seemed\nunlikely, since the ship must have been divided into several\ncompartments by air-tight bulkheads.\n\nCould the vessel have been deserted for some reason? The crew might\nhave mutinied, and left her in the life-tubes. She might have been\nrobbed by pirates, and set adrift. But with the space lanes policed as\nthey were, piracy and successful mutiny were rare.\n\nThad saw that the flier's navigation lights were out.\n\nHe found the heliograph signal mirror at his side, sighted it upon the\nship, and worked the mirror rapidly. He waited, repeated the call.\nThere was no response.\n\nThe vessel was plainly a derelict. Could he board her, and take her to\nMars? By law, it was his duty to attempt to aid any helpless ship, or\nat least to try to save any endangered lives upon her. And the salvage\naward, if the ship should be deserted and he could bring her safe to\nport, would be half her value.\n\nNo mean prize, that. Half the value of ship and cargo! More than he\nwas apt to earn in years of mining the meteor-belt.\n\nWith new anxiety, he measured the relative motion of the gleaming\nship. It was going to pass ahead of him. And very soon. No more time\nfor speculation. It was still uncertain whether it would come near\nenough so that he could get a line to it.\n\nRapidly he unslung from his belt the apparatus he used to capture\nmeteors. A powerful electromagnet, with a thin, strong wire fastened\nto it, to be hurled from a helix-gun. He set the drum on which the\nwire was wound upon the metal at his feet, fastened it with its\nmagnetic anchor, wondering if it would stand the terrific strain when\nthe wire tightened.\n\nRaising the helix to his shoulder, he trained it upon a point well\nahead of the rushing flier, and stood waiting for the exact moment to\npress the lever. The slender spindle of the ship was only a mile away\nnow, bright in the sunlight. He could see no break in her polished\nhull, save for the dark rows of circular ports. She was not, by any\nmeans, completely wrecked.\n\nHe read the black letters of her name.\n\n_Red Dragon._\n\nThe name of her home port, below, was in smaller letters. But in a\nmoment he made them out. San Francisco. The ship then came from the\nEarth! From the very city where Thad was born!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gleaming hull was near now. Only a few hundred yards away.\nPassing. Aiming well ahead of her, to allow for her motion, Thad\npressed the key that hurled the magnet from the helix. It flung away\nfrom him, the wire screaming from the reel behind it.\n\nThad's mass of metal swung on past the ship, as he returned to the\nrocket and stopped its clattering explosions. He watched the tiny\nblack speck of the magnet. It vanished from sight in the darkness of\nspace, appeared again against the white, burnished hull of the rocket\nship.\n\nFor a painful instant he thought he had missed. Then he saw that the\nmagnet was fast to the side of the flier, near the stern. The line\ntightened. Soon the strain would come upon it, as it checked the\nmomentum of the mass of iron. He set the friction brake.\n\nThad flung himself flat, grasped the wire above the reel. Even if the\nmass of iron tore itself free, he could hold to the wire, and himself\nreach the ship.\n\nHe flung past the deserted vessel, behind it, his lump of iron swung\nlike a pebble in a sling. A cloud of smoke burst from the burned\nlining of the friction brake, in the reel. Then the wire was all out;\nthere was a sudden jerk.\n\nAnd the hard-gathered sphere of metal was gone--snapped off into\nspace. Thad clung desperately to the wire, muscles cracking, tortured\narms almost drawn from their sockets. Fear flashed over his mind; what\nif the wire broke, and left him floating helpless in space?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt held, though, to his relief. He was trailing behind the ship.\nEagerly he seized the handle of the reel; began to wind up the mile of\nthin wire. Half an hour later, Thad's suited figure bumped gently\nagainst the shining hull of the rocket. He got to his feet, and gazed\nbackward into the starry gulf, where his sphere of iron had long since\nvanished.\n\n\"Somebody is going to find himself a nice chunk of metal, all welded\ntogether and equipped for rocket navigation,\" he murmured. \"As for\nme--well, I've simply _got_ to run this tub to Mars!\"\n\nHe walked over the smooth, refulgent hull, held to it by magnetic\nsoles. Nowhere was it broken, though he found scars where small\nmeteoric particles had scratched the brilliant polish. So no meteor\nhad wrecked the ship. What, then, was the matter? Soon he would know.\n\nThe _Red Dragon_ was not large. A hundred and thirty feet long, Thad\nestimated, with a beam of twenty-five feet. But her trim lines bespoke\ndesign recent and good; the double ring of black projecting rockets at\nthe stern told of unusual speed.\n\nA pretty piece of salvage, he reflected, if he could land her on\nMars. Half the value of such a ship, unharmed and safe in port, would\nbe a larger sum than he dared put in figures. And he must take her in,\nnow that he had lost his own rocket!\n\nHe found the life-tubes, six of them, slender, silvery cylinders,\nlying secure in their niches, three along each side of the flier. None\nwas missing. So the crew had not willingly deserted the ship.\n\nHe approached the main air-lock, at the center of the hull, behind the\nprojecting dome of the bridge. It was closed. A glance at the dials\ntold him there was full air pressure within it. It had, then, last\nbeen used to enter the rocket, not to leave it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThad opened the exhaust valve, let the air hiss from the chamber of\nthe lock. The huge door swung open in response to his hand upon the\nwheel, and he entered the cylindrical chamber. In a moment the door\nwas closed behind him, air was hissing into the lock again.\n\nHe started to open the face-plate of his helmet, longing for a breath\nof air that did not smell of sweat and stale tobacco smoke, as that in\nhis suit always did, despite the best chemical purifiers. Then he\nhesitated. Perhaps some deadly gas, from the combustion chambers....\n\nThad opened the inner valve, and came upon the upper deck of the\nvessel. A floor ran the full length of the ship, broken with hatches\nand companionways that gave to the rocket rooms, cargo holds, and\nquarters for crew and passengers below. There was an enclosed ladder\nthat led to bridge and navigating room in the dome above. The hull\nformed an arched roof over it.\n\nThe deck was deserted, lit only by three dim blue globes, hanging from\nthe curved roof. All seemed in order--the fire-fighting equipment\nhanging on the walls, and the huge metal patches and welding equipment\nfor repairing breaks in the hull. Everything was clean, bright with\npolish or new paint.\n\nAnd all was very still. The silence held a vague, brooding threat that\nfrightened Thad, made him wish for a moment that he was back upon his\nrugged ball of metal. But he banished his fear, and strode down the\ndeck.\n\nMidway of it he found a dark stain upon the clean metal. The black of\nlong-dried blood. A few tattered scraps of cloth beside it. No more\nthan bloody rags. And a heavy meat cleaver, half hidden beneath a bit\nof darkened fabric.\n\nMute record of tragedy! Thad strove to read it. Had a man fought here\nand been killed? It must have been a struggle of peculiar violence, to\njudge by the dark spattered stains, and the indescribable condition of\nthe remnants of clothing. But what had he fought? Another man, or some\nthing? And what had become of victor and vanquished?\n\nHe walked on down the deck.\n\nThe torturing silence was broken by the abrupt patter of quick little\nfootsteps behind him. He turned quickly, nervously, with a hand going\ninstinctively to his welding arc, which, he knew, would make a fairly\neffective weapon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was merely a dog. A little dog, yellow, nondescript, pathetically\ndelighted. With a sharp, eager bark, it leaped up at Thad, pawing at\nhis armor and licking it, standing on its hind legs and reaching\ntoward the visor of his helmet.\n\nIt was very thin, as if from long starvation. Both ears were ragged\nand bloody, and there was a long, unhealed scratch across the\nshoulder, somewhat inflamed, but not a serious wound.\n\nThe bright, eager eyes were alight with joy. But Thad thought he saw\nfear in them. And even through the stiff fabric of the Osprey suit, he\nfelt that the dog was trembling.\n\nSuddenly, with a low whine, it shrank close to his side. And another\nsound reached Thad's ears.\n\nA cry, weird and harrowing beyond telling. A scream so thin and so\nhigh that it roughened his skin, so keenly shrill that it tortured his\nnerves; a sound of that peculiar frequency that is more agonizing than\nany bodily pain.\n\nWhen silence came again, Thad was standing with his back against the\nwall, the welding arc in his hand. His face was cold with sweat, and a\nqueer chill prickled up and down his spine. The yellow dog crouched\nwhimpering against his legs.\n\nOminous, threatening stillness filled the ship again, disturbed only\nby the whimpers and frightened growls of the dog. Trying to calm his\noverwrought nerves, Thad listened--strained his ears. He could hear\nnothing. And he had no idea from which direction the terrifying sound\nhad come.\n\nA strange cry. Thad knew it had been born in no human throat. Nor in\nthe throat of any animal he knew. It had carried an alien note that\novercame him with instinctive fear and horror. What had voiced it? Was\nthe ship haunted by some dread entity?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor many minutes Thad stood upon the deck, waiting, tensely grasping\nthe welding tool. But the nerve-shattering scream did not come again.\nNor any other sound. The yellow dog seemed half to forget its fear. It\nleaped up at his face again, with another short little bark.\n\nThe air must be good, he thought, if the dog could live in it.\n\nHe unscrewed the face-plate of his helmet, and lifted it. The air\nthat struck his face was cool and clean. He breathed deeply,\ngratefully. And at first he did not notice the strange odor upon it: a\ncurious, unpleasant scent, earthly, almost fetid, unfamiliar.\n\nThe dog kept leaping up, whining.\n\n\"Hungry, boy?\" Thad whispered.\n\nHe fumbled in the bulky inside pockets of his suit, found a slab of\nconcentrated food, and tossed it out through the opened panel. The dog\nsprang upon it, wolfed it eagerly, and came back to his side.\n\nThad set at once about exploring the ship.\n\nFirst he ascended the ladder to the bridge. A metal dome covered it,\nstudded with transparent ports. Charts and instruments were in order.\nAnd the room was vacant, heavy with the fatal silence of the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThad had no expert's knowledge of the flier's mechanism. But he had\nstudied interplanetary navigation, to qualify for his license to carry\nmasses of metal under rocket power through the space lanes and into\nplanetary atmospheres. He was sure he could manage the ship if its\nmechanism were in good order, though he was uncertain of his ability\nto make any considerable repairs.\n\nTo his relief, a scrutiny of the dials revealed nothing wrong.\n\nHe started the gyro motors, got the great wheels to spinning, and thus\nstopped the slow, end-over-end turning of the flier. Then he went to\nthe rocket controls, warmed three of the tubes, and set them to\nfiring. The vessel answered readily to her helm. In a few minutes he\nhad the red fleck of Mars over the bow.\n\n\"Yes, I can run her, all right,\" he announced to the dog, which had\nfollowed him up the steps, keeping close to his feet. \"Don't worry,\nold boy. We'll be eating a juicy beefsteak together, in a week. At\nComet's place in Helion, down by the canal. Not much style--but the\neats!\n\n\"And now we're going to do a little detective work, and find out what\nmade that disagreeable noise. And what happened to all your\nfellow-astronauts. Better find out, before it happens to us!\"\n\nHe shut off the rockets, and climbed down from the bridge again.\n\nWhen Thad started down the companionway to the officers' quarters, in\nthe central one of the five main compartments of the ship, the dog\nkept close to his legs, growling, trembling, hackles lifted. Sensing\nthe animal's terror, pitying it for the naked fear in its eyes, Thad\nwondered what dramas of horror it might have seen.\n\nThe cabins of the navigator, calculator, chief technician, and first\nofficer were empty, and forbidding with the ominous silence of the\nship. They were neatly in order, and the berths had been made since\nthey were used. But there was a large bloodstain, black and circular,\non the floor of the calculator's room.\n\nThe captain's cabin held evidence of a violent struggle. The door had\nbeen broken in. Its fragments, with pieces of broken furniture, books,\ncovers from the berth, and three service pistols, were scattered about\nin indescribable confusion, all stained with blood. Among the\nfrightful debris, Thad found several scraps of clothing, of dissimilar\nfabrics. The guns were empty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAttempting to reconstruct the action of the tragedy from those grim\nclues, he imagined that the five officers, aware of some peril, had\ngathered here, fought, and died.\n\nThe dog refused to enter the room. It stood at the door, looking\nanxiously after him, trembling and whimpering pitifully. Several times\nit sniffed the air and drew back, snarling. Thad thought that the\nunpleasant earthy odor he had noticed upon opening the face-plate of\nhis helmet was stronger here.\n\nAfter a few minutes of searching through the wildly disordered room,\nhe found the ship's log--or its remains. Many pages had been torn from\nthe book, and the remainder, soaked with blood, formed a stiff black\nmass.\n\nOnly one legible entry did he find, that on a page torn from the book,\nwhich somehow had escaped destruction. Dated five months before, it\ngave the position of the vessel and her bearings--she was then just\noutside Jupiter's orbit, Earthward bound--and concluded with a remark\nof sinister implications:\n\n     \"Another man gone this morning. Simms, assistant technician.\n     A fine workman. O'Deen swears he heard something moving on\n     the deck. Cook thinks some of the doctor's stuffed\n     monstrosities have come to life. Ridiculous, of course. But\n     what is one to think?\"\n\nPondering the significance of those few lines, Thad climbed back to\nthe deck. Was the ship haunted by some weird death, that had seized\nthe crew man by man, mysteriously? That was the obvious implication.\nAnd if the flier had been still outside Jupiter's orbit when those\nwords were written, it must have been weeks before the end. A lurking,\ninvisible death! The scream he had heard....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe descended into the forecastle, and came upon another such silent\nrecord of frightful carnage as he had found in the captain's cabin.\nDried blood, scraps of cloth, knives and other weapons. A fearful\nquestion was beginning to obsess him. What had become of the bodies of\nthose who must have died in these conflicts? He dared not think the\nanswer.\n\nGripping the welding arc, Thad approached the after hatch, giving to\nthe cargo hold. Trepidation almost overpowered him, but he was\ndetermined to find the sinister menace of the ship, before it found\nhim. The dog whimpered, hung back, and finally deserted him,\ncontributing nothing to his peace of mind.\n\nThe hold proved to be dark. An indefinite black space, oppressive with\nthe terrible silence of the flier. The air within it bore still more\nstrongly the unpleasant fetor.\n\nThad hesitated on the steps. The hold was not inviting. But at the\nthought that he must sleep, unguarded, while taking the flier to Mars,\nhis resolution returned. The uncertainty, the constant fear, would be\nunendurable.\n\nHe climbed on down, feeling for the light button. He found it, as his\nfeet touched the floor. Blue light flooded the hold.\n\nIt was filled with monstrous things, colossal creatures, such as\nnothing that ever lived upon the Earth; like nothing known in the\njungles of Venus or the deserts of Mars, or anything that has been\nfound upon Jupiter's moons.\n\nThey were monsters remotely resembling insects or crustaceans, but as\nlarge as horses or elephants; creatures upreared upon strange limbs,\narmed with hideously fanged jaws, cruel talons, frightful, saw-toothed\nsnouts, and glittering scales, red and yellow and green. They leered\nat him with phosphorescent eyes, yellow and purple.\n\nThey cast grotesquely gigantic shadows in the blue light....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA cold shock of horror started along Thad's spine, at sight of those\nincredible nightmare things. Automatically be flung up the welding\ntool, flicking over the lever with his thumb, so that violet electric\nflame played about the electrode.\n\nThen he saw that the crowding, hideous things were motionless, that\nthey stood upon wooden pedestals, that many of them were supported\nupon metal bars. They were dead. Mounted. Collected specimens of some\nalien life.\n\nGrinning wanly, and conscious of a weakness in the knees, he muttered:\n\"They sure will fill the museum, if everybody gets the kick out of\nthem that I did. A little too realistic, I'd say. Guess these are the\n'stuffed monstrosities' mentioned in the page out of the log. No\nwonder the cook was afraid of them. Some of then do look hellishly\nalive!\"\n\nHe started across the hold, shrinking involuntarily from the armored\nenormities that seemed crouched to spring at him, motionless eyes\nstaring.\n\nSo, at the end of the long space, he found the treasure.\n\nGlittering in the blue light, it looked unreal. Incredible. A dazzling\ndream. He stopped among the fearful things that seemed gathered as if\nto guard it, and stared with wide eyes through the opened face-plate\nof his helmet.\n\nHe saw neat stacks of gold ingots, new, freshly smelted; bars of\nsilver-white iridium, of argent platinum, of blue-white osmium. Many\nof them. Thousands of pounds, Thad knew. He trembled at thought of\ntheir value. Almost beyond calculation.\n\nThen he saw the coffer, lying beyond the piled, gleaming ingots--a\nhuge box, eight feet long; made of some crystal that glittered with\nsnowy whiteness, filled with sparkling, iridescent gleams, and inlaid\nwith strange designs, apparently in vermilion enamel.\n\nWith a little cry, he ran toward the chest, moving awkwardly in the\nloose, deflated fabric of the Osprey suit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeside the coffer, on the floor of the hold, was literally a mountain\nof flame--blazing gems, heaped as if they had been carelessly dumped\nfrom it; cut diamonds, incredibly gigantic; monster emeralds,\nsapphires, rubies; and strange stones, that Thad did not recognize.\n\nAnd Thad gasped with horror, when he looked at the designs of the\nvermilion inlay, in the white, gleaming crystal. Weird forms. Shapes\nof creatures somewhat like gigantic spiders, and more unlike them.\nDemoniac things, wickedly fanged, jaws slavering. Executed with\nmasterly skill, that made them seem living, menacing, secretly\ngloating!\n\nThad stared at them for long minutes, fascinated almost hypnotically.\nThree times he approached the chest, to lift the lid and find what it\nheld. And three times the unutterable horror of those crimson images\nthrust him back, shuddering.\n\n\"Nothing but pictures,\" he muttered hoarsely.\n\nA fourth time he advanced, trembling, and seized the lid of the\ncoffer. Heavy, massive, it was fashioned also of glistening white\ncrystal, and inlaid in crimson with weirdly hideous figures. Great\nhinges of white platinum held it on the farther side; it was fastened\nwith a simple, heavy hasp of the precious metal.\n\nHands quivering, Thad snapped back the hasp, lifted the lid.\n\nNew treasure in the chest would not have surprised him. He was\nprepared to meet dazzling wonders of gems or priceless metal. Nor\nwould he have been astonished at some weird creature such as one of\nthose whose likenesses were inlaid in the crystal.\n\nBut what he saw made him drop the massive lid.\n\nA woman lay in the chest--motionless, in white.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment he raised the lid again; examined the still form more\nclosely. The woman had been young. The features were regular, good to\nlook upon. The eyes were closed; the white face appeared very\npeaceful.\n\nSave for the extreme, cadaverous pallor, there was no mark of death.\nWith a fancy that the body might be miraculously living, sleeping,\nThad thrust an arm out through the opened panel of his suit, and\ntouched a slender, bare white arm. It was stiff, very cold.\n\nThe still, pallid face was framed in fine brown hair. The fair, small\nhands were crossed upon the breast, over the simple white garment.\n\nA queer ache came into his heart. Something made him think of a white\ntower in the red hills near Helion, and a girl waiting in its fragrant\ngarden of saffron and purple--a girl like this.\n\nThe body lay upon a bed of blazing jewels.\n\nIt appeared, Thad thought, as if the pile of gems upon the floor had\nbeen hastily scraped from the coffer, to make room for the quiet form.\nHe wondered how long it had lain there. It looked as if it might have\nbeen living but minutes before. Some preservative....\n\nHis thought was broken by a sound that rang from the open hatchway on\nthe deck above--the furious barking and yelping of the dog. Abruptly\nthat was silent, and in its place came the uncanny and terrifying\nscream that Thad had heard once before, on this flier of mystery. A\nshriek so keen and shrill that it seemed to tear out his nerves by\ntheir roots. The voice of the haunter of the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Thad came back upon the deck, the dog was still barking\nnervously. He saw the animal forward, almost at the bow. Hackles\nraised, tail between its legs, it was slinking backward, barking\nsharply as if to call for aid.\n\nApparently it was retreating from something between Thad and itself.\nBut Thad, searching the dimly-lit deck, could see no source of alarm.\nNor could the structures upon it have shut any large object from his\nview.\n\n\"It's all right!\" Thad called, intending to reassure the frightened\nanimal, but finding his voice queerly dry. \"Coming on the double, old\nman. Don't worry.\"\n\nThe dog had reached the end of the deck. It stopped yelping, but\nsnarled and whined as if in terror. It began darting back and forth,\nmoving exactly as if something were slowly closing in upon it,\ntrapping it in the corner. But Thad could see nothing.\n\nThen it made a wild dash back toward Thad, darting along by the wall,\nas if trying to run past an unseen enemy.\n\nThad thought he heard quick, rasping footsteps, then, that were not\nthose of the dog. And something seemed to catch the dog in mid-air, as\nit leaped. It was hurled howling to the deck. For a moment it\nstruggled furiously, as if an invisible claw had pinned it down. Then\nit escaped, and fled whimpering to Thad's side.\n\nHe saw a new wound across its hips. Three long, parallel scratches,\nfrom which fresh red blood was trickling.\n\nRegular scraping sounds came from the end of the deck, where no moving\nthing was to be seen--sounds such as might be made by the walking of\nfeet with unsheathed claws. Something was coming back toward Thad.\nSomething that was _invisible_!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTerror seized him, with the knowledge. He had nerved himself to face\ndesperate men, or a savage animal. But an invisible being, that could\ncreep upon him and strike unseen! It was incredible ... yet he had\nseen the dog knocked down, and the bleeding wound it had received.\n\nHis heart paused, then beat very quickly. For the moment he thought\nonly blindly, of escape. He knew only an overpowering desire to hide,\nto conceal himself from the invisible thing. Had it been possible, he\nmight have tried to leave the flier.\n\nBeside him was one of the companionways amidships, giving access to a\ncompartment of the vessel that he had not explored. He turned, leaped\ndown the steps, with the terrified dog at his heels.\n\nBelow, he found himself in a short hall, dimly lighted. Several metal\ndoors opened from it. He tried one at random. It gave. He sprang\nthrough, let the dog follow, closed and locked it.\n\nTrying to listen, he leaned weakly against the door. The rushing of\nhis breath, swift and regular. The loud hammer of his thudding heart.\nThe dog's low whines. Then--unmistakable scraping sounds, outside.\n\nThe scratching of claws, Thad knew. Invisible claws!\n\nHe stood there, bracing the door with the weight of his body, holding\nthe welding arc ready in his hand. Several times the hinges creaked,\nand he felt a heavy pressure against the panels. But at last the\nscratching sounds ceased. He relaxed. The monster had withdrawn, at\nleast for a time.\n\nWhen he had time to think, the invisibility of the thing was not so\nincredible. The mounted creatures he had seen in the hold were\nevidence that the flier had visited some unknown planet, where weird\nlife reigned. It was not beyond reason that such a planet should be\ninhabited by beings invisible to human sight.\n\nHuman vision, as he knew, utilizes only a tiny fraction of the\nspectrum. The creature must be largely transparent to visible light,\nas human flesh is radiolucent to hard X-rays. Quite possibly it could\nbe seen by infra-red or ultra-violet light--evidently it was visible\nenough to the dog's eyes, with their different range of sensitivity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPushing the subject from his mind, he turned to survey the room into\nwhich he had burst. It had apparently been occupied by a woman. A\nfrail blue silk dress and more intimate items of feminine wearing\napparel were hanging above the berth. Two pairs of delicate black\nslippers stood neatly below it.\n\nAcross from him was a dressing table, with a large mirror above it.\nCombs, pins, jars of cosmetic cluttered it. And Thad saw upon it a\nlittle leather-bound book, locked, stamped on the back \"Diary.\"\n\nHe crossed the room and picked up the little book, which smelled\nfaintly of jasmine. Momentary shame overcame him at thus stealing the\nsecrets of an unknown girl. Necessity, however, left him no choice but\nto seize any chance of learning more of this ship of mystery and her\ninvisible haunter. He broke the flimsy fastening.\n\nLinda Cross was the name written on the fly-leaf, in a firm, clear\nfeminine hand. On the next page was the photograph, in color, of a\ngirl, the brown-haired girl whose body Thad had discovered in the\ncrystal coffer in the hold. Her eyes, he saw, had been blue. He\nthought she looked very lovely--like the waiting girl in his old dream\nof the silver tower in the red hills by Helion.\n\nThe diary, it appeared, had not been kept very devotedly. Most of the\npages were blank.\n\nOne of the first entries, dated a year and a half before, told of a\nparty that Linda had attended in San Francisco, and of her refusal to\ndance with a certain man, referred to as \"Benny,\" because he had been\nunpleasantly insistent about wanting to marry her. It ended:\n\n     \"Dad said to-night that we're going off in the _Dragon_\n     again. All the way to Uranus, if the new fuel works as he\n     expects. What a lark, to explore a few new worlds of our\n     own! Dad says one of Uranus' moons is as large as Mercury.\n     And Benny won't be proposing again soon!\"\n\nTurning on, Thad found other scattered entries, some of them dealing\nwith the preparation for the voyage, the start from San Francisco--and\na huge bunch of flowers from \"Benny,\" the long months of the trip\nthrough space, out past the orbit of Mars, above the meteor belt,\nacross Jupiter's orbit, beyond the track of Saturn, which was the\nfarthest point that rocket explorers had previously reached, and on to\nUranus, where they could not land because of the unstable surface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe remainder of the entries Thad found less frequent, shorter,\nbearing the mark of excitement: landing upon Titania, the third and\nlargest satellite of Uranus; unearthly forests, sheltering strange and\nmonstrous life; the hunting of weird creatures, and mounting them for\nmuseum specimens.\n\nThen the discovery of a ruined city, whose remains indicated that it\nhad been built by a lost race of intelligent, spiderlike things; the\nfinding of a temple whose walls were of precious metals, containing a\ncrystal chest filled with wondrous gems; the smelting of the metal\ninto convenient ingots, and the transfer of the treasure to the hold.\n\nThe first sinister note there entered the diary:\n\n     \"Some of the men say we shouldn't have disturbed the temple.\n     Think it will bring us bad luck. Rubbish, of course. But one\n     man did vanish while they were smelting the gold. Poor Mr.\n     Tom James. I suppose he ventured away from the rest, and\n     something caught him.\"\n\nThe few entries that followed were shorter, and showed increasing\nnervous tension. They recorded the departure from Titania, made almost\nas soon as the treasure was loaded. The last was made several weeks\nlater. A dozen men had vanished from the crew, leaving only gouts of\nblood to hint the manner of their going. The last entry ran:\n\n     \"Dad says I'm to stay in here to-day. Old dear, he's afraid\n     the thing will get me--whatever it is. It's really serious.\n     Two men taken from their berths last night. And not a trace.\n     Some of them think it's a curse on the treasure. One of them\n     swears he saw Dad's stuffed specimens moving about in the\n     hold.\n\n     \"Some terrible thing must have slipped aboard the flier, out\n     of the jungle. That's what Dad and the captain think. Queer\n     they can't find it. They've searched all over. Well....\"\n\nMusing and regretful, Thad turned back for another look at the smiling\ngirl in the photograph.\n\nWhat a tragedy her death had been! Reading the diary had made him like\nher. Her balance and humor. Her quiet affection for \"Dad.\" The calm\ncourage with which she seemed to have faced the creeping, lurking\ndeath that darkened the ship with its unescapable shadow.\n\nHow had her body come to be in the coffer, he wondered, when all the\nothers were--gone? It had shown no marks of violence. She must have\ndied of fear. No, her face had seemed too calm and peaceful for that.\nHad she chosen easy death by some poison, rather than that other\ndreadful fate? Had her body been put in the chest to protect it, and\nthe poison arrested decomposition?\n\nThad was still studying the picture, thoughtfully and sadly, when the\ndog, which had been silent, suddenly growled again, and retreated from\nthe door, toward the corner of the room.\n\nThe invisible monster had returned. Thad heard its claws scratching\nacross the door again. And he heard another dreadful sound--not the\nlong, shrill scream that had so grated on his nerves before, but a\nshort, sharp coughing or barking, a series of shrill, indescribable\nnotes that could have been made by no beast he knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe decision to open the door cost a huge effort of Thad's will.\n\nFor hours he had waited, thinking desperately. And the thing outside\nthe door had waited as patiently, scratching upon it from time to\ntime, uttering those dreadful, shrill coughing cries.\n\nSooner or later, he would have to face the monster. Even if he could\nescape from the room and avoid it for a time, he would have to meet it\nin the end. And it might creep upon him while he slept.\n\nTo be sure, the issue of the combat was extremely doubtful. The\nmonster, apparently, had succeeded in killing every man upon the\nflier, even though some of them had been armed. It must be large and\nvery ferocious.\n\nBut Thad was not without hope. He still wore his Osprey-suit. The\nheavy fabric, made of metal wires impregnated with a tough, elastic\ncomposition, should afford considerable protection against the thing.\n\nThe welding arc, intended to fuse refractive meteoric iron, would be\nno mean weapon, at close quarters. And the quarters would be close.\n\nIf only he could find some way to make the thing visible!\n\nPaint, or something of the kind, would stick to its skin.... His eyes,\nsearching the room, caught the jar of face powder on the dressing\ntable. Dash that over it! It ought to stick enough to make the outline\nvisible.\n\nSo, at last, holding the powder ready in one hand, he waited until a\ntime when the pressure upon the door had just relaxed, and he knew the\nmonster was waiting outside. Swiftly, he opened the door....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThad had partially overcome the instinctive horror that the unseen\nbeing had first aroused in him. But it returned in a sickening wave\nwhen he heard the short, shrill, coughing cries, hideously eager, that\ngreeted the opening of the door. And the quick rasping of naked claws\nupon the floor. _Sounds from nothingness!_\n\nHe flung the powder at the sound.\n\nA form of weird horror materialized before him, still half invisible,\nhalf outlined with the white film of adhering powder: gigantic and\nhideous claws, that seemed to reach out of empty air, the side of a\nhuge, scaly body, a yawning, dripping jaw. For a moment Thad could see\ngreat, hooked fangs in that jaw. Then they vanished, as if an unseen\ntongue had licked the powder from them, dissolving it in fluids which\nmade it invisible.\n\nThat unearthly, half-seen shape leaped at him.\n\nHe was carried backward into the room, hurled to the floor. Claws were\nrasping upon the tough fabric of his suit. His arm was seized\ncrushingly in half-visible jaws.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDesperately he clung to the welding tool. The heated electrode was\ndriven toward his body. He fought to keep it away; he knew that it\nwould burn through even the insulated fabric of his suit.\n\nA claw ripped savagely at his side. He heard the sharp, rending sound,\nas the tough fabric of his suit was torn, and felt a thin pencil of\npain drawn along his body, where a claw cut his skin.\n\nSuddenly the suit was full of the earthy fetor of the monster's body,\nnauseatingly intense. Thad gasped, tried to hold his breath, and\nthrust upward hard with the incandescent electrode. He felt warm blood\ntrickling from the wound.\n\nA numbing blow struck his arm. The welding tool was carried from his\nhand. Flung to the side of the room, it clattered to the floor; and\nthen a heavy weight came upon his chest, forcing the breath from his\nlungs. The monster stood upon his body and clawed at him.\n\nThad squirmed furiously. He kicked out with his feet, encountering a\ngreat, hard body. Futilely he beat and thrust with his arms against\nthe pillarlike limb.\n\nHis body was being mauled, bruised beneath the thick fabric. He heard\nit tear again, along his right thigh. But he felt no pain, and thought\nthe claws had not reached the skin.\n\nIt was the yellow dog that gave him the chance to recover the weapon.\nThe animal had been running back and forth in the opposite end of the\nroom, fairly howling in excitement and terror. Now, with the mad\ncourage of desperation, it leaped recklessly at the monster.\n\nA mighty, dimly seen claw caught it, hurled it back across the room.\nIt lay still, broken, whimpering.\n\nFor a moment the thing had lifted its weight from Thad's body. And\nThad slipped quickly from beneath it, flung himself across the room,\nsnatched up the welding tool.\n\nIn an instant the creature was upon him again. But he met it with the\nincandescent electrode. He was crouched in a corner, now, where it\ncould come at him from only one direction. Its claws still slashed at\nhim ferociously. But he was able to cling to the weapon, and meet each\nonslaught with hot metal.\n\nGradually its mad attacks weakened. Then one of his blind, thrusting\nblows seemed to burn into a vital organ. A terrible choking,\nstrangling sound came from the air. And he heard the thrashing\nstruggles of wild convulsions. At last all was quiet. He prodded the\nthing again and again with the hot electrode, and it did not move. It\nwas dead.\n\nThe creature's body was so heavy that Thad had to return to the\nbridge, and shut off the current in the gravity plates along the keel,\nbefore he could move it. He dragged it to the lock through which he\nhad entered the flier, and consigned it to space....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive days later Thad brought the _Red Dragon_ into the atmosphere of\nMars. A puzzled pilot came aboard, in response to his signals, and\ndocked the flier safely at Helion. Thad went down into the hold again,\nwith the astonished port authorities who had come aboard to inspect\nthe vessel.\n\nAgain he passed among the grotesque and outrageous monsters in the\nhold, leading the gasping officers. While they marveled at the\ntreasure, he lifted the weirdly embellished lid of the coffer of white\ncrystal, and looked once more upon the still form of the girl within\nit.\n\nPity stirred him. An ache came in his throat.\n\nLinda Cross, so quiet and cold and white, and yet so lovely. How\nterrible her last days of life must have been, with doom shadowing the\nvessel, and the men vanishing mysteriously, one by one!\nTerrible--until she had sought the security of death.\n\nStrangely, Thad felt no great elation at the thought that half the\nincalculable treasure about him was now safely his own, as the award\nof salvage. If only the girl were still living.... He felt a\npoignantly keen desire to hear her voice.\n\nThad found the note when they started to lift her from the chest. A\nhasty scrawl, it lay beneath her head, among glittering gems.\n\n     \"This woman is not dead. Please have her given skilled\n     medical attention as soon as possible. She lies in a state\n     of suspended animation, induced by the injection of fifty\n     minims of zeronel.\n\n     \"She is my daughter, Linda Cross, and my sole heir.\n\n     \"I entreat the finders of this to have care given her, and\n     to keep in trust for her such part of the treasure on this\n     ship as may remain after the payment of salvage or other\n     claims.\n\n     \"Sometime she will wake. Perhaps in a year, perhaps in a\n     hundred. The purity of my drugs is uncertain, and the\n     injection was made hastily, so I do not know the exact time\n     that must elapse.\n\n     \"If this is found, it will be because the lurking thing upon\n     the ship has destroyed me and all my men.\n\n     \"Please do not fail me.\n\n                                    Levington Cross.\"\n\nThad bought the white tower of his dreams, slim and graceful in its\nMartian garden of saffron and purple, among the low ocher hills beside\nHelion. He carried the sleeping girl through the silver door where the\ngirl of his dreams had waited, and set the coffer in a great, vaulted\nchamber. Many times each day he came into the room where she lay, to\nlook into her pallid face, and feel her cold wrist. He kept a nurse in\nattendance, and had a physician call daily.\n\nA long Martian year went by.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLooking in his mirror one day, Thad saw little wrinkles about his\neyes. He realized that the nervous strain and anxiety of waiting was\naging him. And it might be a hundred years, he remembered, before\nLinda Cross came from beneath the drug's influence.\n\nHe wondered if he should grow old and infirm, while Linda lay still\nyoung and beautiful and unchanged in her sleep; if she might awake,\nafter long years, and see in him only a feeble old man. And he knew\nthat he would not be sorry he had waited, even if he should die before\nshe revived.\n\nOn the next day, the nurse called him into the room where Linda lay.\nHe was bending over her when she opened her eyes. They were blue,\nglorious.\n\nA long time she looked up at him, first in fearful wonder, then with\nconfidence, and dawning understanding. And at last she smiled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Salvage in Space, by John Stewart Williamson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SALVAGE IN SPACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29283.txt or 29283.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/2/8/29283/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
