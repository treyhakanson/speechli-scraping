Then there's the case\n       of the first space pilot to Mars who developed the itch--\n\n\nBill Adams was halfway back from Mars when he noticed the red rash on\nhis hands. He'd been reaching for one of the few remaining tissues to\ncover a sneeze, while scratching vigorously at the base of his neck.\nThen he saw the red spot, and his hand halted, while all desire to\nsneeze gasped out of him.\n\nHe sat there, five feet seven inches of lean muscle and bronzed skin,\nsweating and staring, while the blond hair on the back of his neck\nseemed to stand on end. Finally he dropped his hand and pulled himself\ncarefully erect. The cabin in the spaceship was big enough to permit\nturning around, but not much more, and with the ship cruising without\npower, there was almost no gravity to keep him from overshooting his\ngoal.\n\nHe found the polished plate that served as a mirror and studied\nhimself. His eyes were puffy, his nose was red, and there were other\nred splotches and marks on his face.\n\nWhatever it was, he had it bad!\n\nPictures went through his head, all unpleasant. He'd been only a kid\nwhen the men came back from the South Pacific in the last war; but an\nuncle had spent years dying of some weird disease that the doctors\ncouldn't identify. That had been from something caught on Earth. What\nwould happen when the disease was from another planet?\n\nIt was ridiculous. Mars had no animal life, and even the thin\nlichenlike plants were sparse and tiny. A man couldn't catch a disease\nfrom a plant. Even horses didn't communicate their ills to men. Then\nBill remembered gangrene and cancer, which could attack any life,\napparently.\n\nHe went back to the tiny Geiger-Muller counter, but there was no sign\nof radiation from the big atomic motor that powered the ship. He\nstripped his clothes off, spotting more of the red marks breaking out,\nbut finding no sign of parasites. He hadn't really believed it, anyhow.\nThat wouldn't account for the sneezing and sniffles, or the puffed eyes\nand burning inside his nose and throat.\n\nDust, maybe? Mars had been dusty, a waste of reddish sand and desert\nsilt that made the Sahara seem like paradise, and it had settled on\nhis spacesuit, to come in through the airlocks with him. But if it\ncontained some irritant, it should have been worse on Mars than now. He\ncould remember nothing annoying, and he'd turned on the tiny, compact\nlittle static dust traps, in any case, before leaving, to clear the air.\n\nHe went back to one of the traps now, and ripped the cover off it.\n\nThe little motor purred briskly. The plastic rods turned against fur\nbrushes, while a wiper cleared off any dust they picked up. There was\nno dust he could see; the traps had done their work.\n\nSome plant irritant, like poison ivy? No, he'd always worn his\nsuit--Mars had an atmosphere, but it wasn't anything a man could\nbreathe long. The suit was put on and off with automatic machine\ngrapples, so he couldn't have touched it.\n\nThe rash seemed to get worse on his body as he looked at it. This\ntime, he tore one of the tissues in quarters as he sneezed. The little\nsupply was almost gone; there was never space enough for much beyond\nessentials in a spaceship, even with the new atomic drive. As he looked\nfor spots, the burning in his nose seemed to increase.\n\nHe dropped back to the pilot seat, cursing. Two months of being cramped\nup in this cubicle, sweating out the trip to Mars without knowing how\nthe new engine would last; three weeks on Mars, mapping frantically to\ncover all the territory he could, and planting little flags a hundred\nmiles apart; now a week on the trip back at high acceleration most of\nthe way--and this! He'd expected adventure of some kind. Mars, though,\nhad proved as interesting as a sandpile, and even the \"canals\" had\nproved to be only mineral striations, invisible from the ground.\n\nHe looked for something to do, but found nothing. He'd developed his\nfilms the day before, after carefully cleaning the static traps and\nmaking sure the air was dust-free. He'd written up the accounts. And\nhe'd been coasting along on the hope of getting home to a bath, a beer,\nand a few bull sessions, before he began to capitalize on being the\nfirst man to reach another planet beyond the Moon.\n\nHe cut on full acceleration again, more certain of his motors than\nof himself. He'd begun to notice the itching yesterday; today he was\nbreaking out in the rash. How long would whatever was coming take? Good\nGod, he might die--from something as humiliating and undramatic as this!\n\nIt hadn't hit him before, fully. There was no knowing about diseases\nfrom other planets. Men had developed immunity to the germs found on\nEarth; but just as smallpox had proved so fatal to the Indians and\nsyphilis to Europe when they first hit, there was no telling how wildly\nthis might progress. It might go away in a day, or it might kill him\njust as quickly.\n\nHe was figuring his new orbit on a tiny calculator. In two days at this\nacceleration, he could reach radar-distance of Earth; in four, he could\nland. The tubes might burn out in continuous firing. But the other way,\nhe'd be two weeks making a landing, and most diseases he could remember\nseemed faster than that.\n\nBill wiped the sweat off his forehead, scratched at other places that\nwere itching, and stared down at the small disk of Earth. There were\ndoctors there--and, brother, he'd need them fast!\n\nThings were a little worse when the first squeals came from the radar\ntwo days later. He'd run out of tissues, and his nose was a continual\ndrip, while breathing seemed almost impossible. He was running some\nfever, too, though he had no way of knowing how much.\n\nHe cut his receiver in, punched out the code on his key. The receiver\npipped again at him, bits of message getting through, but unclearly.\nThere was no response to his signals. He checked his chronometer and\nflipped over the micropages of his _Ephemeris_; the big radar at\nWashington was still out of line with him, and the signals had to cut\nthrough too much air to come clearly. It should be good in another hour.\n\nBut right now, an hour seemed longer than a normal year. He checked the\ndust tray again, tried figuring out other orbits, managed to locate\nthe Moon, and scratched. Fifteen minutes. There was no room for pacing\nup and down. He pushed the back down from the pilot seat, lowered the\ntable, and pulled out his bunk; he remade it, making sure all the\ncorners were perfect. Then he folded it back and lifted the table and\nseat. That took less than five minutes.\n\nHis hands were shaking worse when the automatic radar signals began\nto come through more clearly. It wasn't an hour, but he could wait\nno longer. He opened the key and began to send. It would take fifteen\nseconds for the signal to reach Earth, and another quarter minute for\nan answer, even if an operator was on duty.\n\nHalf a minute later, he found one was. \"Earth to Mars Rocket I. Thank\nGod, you're ahead of schedule. If your tubes hold out, crowd them. Two\nother nations have ships out now. The U. N. has ruled that whoever\ncomes back first with mapping surveys can claim the territory mapped.\nWe're rushing the construction, but we need the ship for the second run\nif we're to claim our fair territory. Aw, hell--congratulations!\"\n\nHe'd started hammering at his key before they finished, giving the\nfacts on the tubes, which were standing up beyond all expectations.\n\"And get a doctor ready--a bunch of them,\" he finished. \"I seem to have\npicked up something like a disease.\"\n\nThere was a long delay before an answer came this time--more than five\nminutes. The hand on the key was obviously different, slower and not as\nsteady. \"What symptoms, Adams? Give all details!\"\n\nHe began, giving all the information he had, from the first itching\nthrough the rash and the fever. Again, longer this time, the main\nstation hesitated.\n\n\"Anything I can do about it now?\" Bill asked, finally. \"And how about\nhaving those doctors ready?\"\n\n\"We're checking with Medical,\" the signals answered. \"We're.... Here's\ntheir report. Not enough data--could be anything. Dozens of diseases\nlike that. Nothing you can do, except try salt water gargle and spray;\nyou've got stuff for that. Wash off rash with soap and hot water,\nfollowed by some of your hypo. We'll get a medical kit up to the Moon\nfor you.\"\n\nHe let that sink in, then clicked back: \"The _Moon_?\"\n\n\"You think you can land here with whatever you've got, man? There's no\nway of knowing how contagious it is. And keep an hourly check with us.\nIf you pass out, we'll try to get someone out in a Moon rocket to pick\nyou up. But we can't risk danger of infecting the whole planet. You're\nquarantined on the Moon--we'll send up landing instructions later--not\neven for Luna Base, but where there will be no chance of contamination\nfor others. You didn't really expect to come back here, did you, Adams?\"\n\nHe should have thought of it. He knew that. And he knew that the words\nfrom Earth weren't as callous as they sounded. Down there, men would\nbe sweating with him, going crazy trying to do something. But they were\nright. Earth had to be protected first; Bill Adams was only one out of\ntwo and a half billions, even if he had reached a planet before any\nother man.\n\nYeah, it was fine to be a hero. But heroes shouldn't menace the rest of\nthe world.\n\nLogically, he knew they were right. That helped him get his emotions\nunder control. \"Where do you want me to put down?\"\n\n\"Tycho. It isn't hard to spot for radar-controlled delivery of\nsupplies to you, but it's a good seven hundred miles from Lunar Base.\nAnd look--we'll try to get a doctor to you. But keep us informed if\nanything slips. We need those maps, if we can find a way to sterilize\n'em.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he acknowledged. \"And tell the cartographers there are no\ncraters, no intelligence, and only plants about half an inch high. Mars\nstinks.\"\n\nThey'd already been busy, he saw, as he teetered down on his jets for a\nlanding on Tycho. Holding control was the hardest job he'd ever done.\nA series of itchings cropped out just as the work got tricky, when he\ncould no longer see the surface, and had to go by feel. But somehow he\nmade it. Then he relaxed and began an orgy of scratching.\n\nAnd he'd thought there was something romantic about being a hero!\n\nThe supplies that had already been sent up by the superfast unmanned\nmissiles would give him something to do, at least. He moved back the\ntwo feet needed to reach his developing tanks and went through the\nprocess of spraying and gargling. It was soothing enough while it went\non, but it offered only momentary help.\n\nThen his stomach began showing distress signs. He fought against it,\ntightening up. It did no good. His hasty breakfast of just black coffee\nwanted to come up--and did, giving him barely time to make the little\nbooth.\n\nHe washed his mouth out and grabbed for the radar key, banging out a\nreport on this. The doctors must have been standing by down at the big\nstation, because there was only a slight delay before the answering\nsignal came: \"Any blood?\"\n\nAnother knot added itself to his intestines. \"I don't know--don't think\nso, but I didn't look.\"\n\n\"Look, next time. We're trying to get this related to some of the\nfamiliar diseases. It must have some relation--there are only so many\nways a man can be sick. We've got a doctor coming over, Adams. None\non the Moon, but we're shipping him through. He'll set down in about\nnine hours. And there's some stuff to take on the supply missiles. May\nnot help, but we're trying a mixture of the antibiotics. Also some ACS\nand anodynes for the itching and rash. Hope they work. Let us know any\nreaction.\"\n\nBill cut off. He'd have to try. They were as much in the dark about\nthis as he was, but they had a better background for guessing and trial\nand error. And if the bugs in him happened to like tachiomycetin, he\nwouldn't be too much worse off. Damn it, _had_ there been blood?\n\nHe forced his mind off it, climbed into his clothes and then into the\nspacesuit that hung from the grapples. It moved automatically into\nposition, the two halves sliding shut and sealing from outside. The big\ngloves on his hands were too clumsy for such operations.\n\nThen he went bounding across the Moon. Halfway to the supplies he felt\nthe itching come back, and he slithered and wriggled around, trying\nto scratch his skin against his clothing. It didn't help much. He was\nsweating harder, and his eyes were watering. He manipulated the little\nvisor-cleaning gadget, trying to poke his face forward to brush the\nfrustration tears from his eyes. He couldn't quite reach it.\n\nThere were three supply missiles, each holding about two hundred\npounds, Earth weight. He tied them together and slung them over his\nback, heading toward his ship. Here they weighed only a hundred pounds,\nand with his own weight and the suit added, the whole load came to\nlittle more than his normal weight on Earth.\n\nHe tried shifting the supplies around on his back, getting them to\npress against the spots of torment as he walked. It simply unbalanced\nhim, without really relieving the itching. Fortunately, though, his\neyes were clearing a little. He gritted his teeth and fought back\nthrough the powdery pumice surface, kicking up clouds of dust that\nsettled slowly but completely--though the gravity was low, there was no\nair to hold them up.\n\nNothing had ever looked better than the airlock of the ship. He let the\ngrapples hook the suit off him as soon as the outer seal was shut and\nwent into a whirling dervish act. Aches and pains could be stood--but\n_itching_!\n\nApparently, though, the spray and gargle had helped a little, since\nhis nose felt somewhat clearer and his eyes were definitely better. He\nrepeated them, and then found the medical supplies, with a long list of\ninstructions.\n\nThey were really shooting the pharmacy at him. He injected himself,\nswallowed things, rubbed himself down with others, and waited. Whatever\nthey'd given him didn't offer any immediate help. He began to feel\nworse. But on contacting Earth by radar, he was assured that that might\nbe expected.\n\n\"We've got another missile coming, with metal foil for the maps and\nphotos--plus a small copying camera. You can print them right on the\nmetal, seal that in a can, and leave it for the rocket that's bringing\nthe doctor. The pilot will blast over it--that should sterilize it--and\npick it up when it cools.\"\n\nBill swore, but he was in his suit when the missile landed, heading out\nacross the pumice-covered wastes toward it. The salves had helped the\nitching a little, but not much. And his nose had grown worse again.\n\nHe jockeyed the big supply can out of the torpedo-shaped missile,\npacked it on his back, and headed for his ship. The itching was acting\nup as he sweated--this made a real load, about like packing a hundred\nbulky pounds over his normal Earth weight through the soft drift of the\npumice. But his nose was clearing again; it was apparently becoming\ncyclic. He'd have to relay that information back to the medics. And\nwhere were they getting a doctor crazy enough to take a chance with him?\n\nHe climbed out of the suit and went through the ritual of scratching,\nnoticing that his fever had gone up, and that his muscles were shaking.\nHis head seemed light, as if he were in for a spell of dizziness.\nThey'd be interested in that, back on Earth, though it wouldn't do much\ngood. He couldn't work up a clinical attitude about himself. All he\nwanted was a chance to get over this disease before it killed him.\n\nHe dragged out the photo and copying equipment, under a red light.\nIt filled what little space was left in his cubbyhole cabin. Then he\nswore, gulping down more of the pills where they were waiting for him.\nThe metal sheets were fine. They were excellent. The only thing wrong\nwas that they wouldn't fit his developing trays--and they were tough\nenough to give him no way of cutting them to size.\n\nHe stuffed them back in their container and shoved it into the\nairlock. Then his stomach kicked up again. He couldn't see any blood in\nthe result, but he couldn't be sure--the color of the pills might hide\ntraces. He flushed it down, his head turning in circles, and went to\nthe radar. This time he didn't even wait for a reply; let them worry\nabout their damned maps. They could send cutting equipment with the\ndoctor and pick up the things later. They could pick up his corpse and\ncremate it at the same time, for all he cared right now.\n\nHe yanked out his bunk and slumped into it, curling up as much as the\nitching would permit. And finally, for the first time in over fifty\nhours, he managed to doze off, though his sleep was full of nightmares.\n\nIt was the sound of the bull-throated chemical rocket that brought him\nout of it--the sound traveling along the surface through the\nrocks and up through the metal ship, even without air to carry it.\n\nHe could feel the rumble of its takeoff later, but he waited long after\nthat for the doctor. There was no knock on the port. Finally he pulled\nhimself up from the bunk, sweating and shaken, and looked out.\n\nThe doctor was there--or at least a man in a spacesuit was. But\nsomebody had been in a hurry for volunteers, and given the man no\nbasic training at all. The figure would pull itself erect, make a few\nstrides that were all bounce and no progress, and then slide down into\nthe pumice. Moon-walking was tricky until you learned how.\n\nBill sighed, scratching unconsciously, and made his way somehow out to\nhis suit, climbing into it. He paused for a final good scratch, and\nthen the grapples took over. This time, he stumbled also as he made his\nway across the powdery rubble. But the other man was making no real\nprogress at all.\n\nBill reached him, and touched helmets long enough to issue simple\ninstructions through metal sound conduction. Then he managed to guide\nthe other's steps; there had been accounts of the days of learning\nspent by the first men on the Moon, but it wasn't that bad with an\ninstructor to help. The doctor picked up as they went along. Bill's\nlegs were buckling under him by then, and the itches were past\nendurance. At the end, the doctor was helping him. But somehow they\nmade the ship, and were getting out of the suits--Bill first, then the\ndoctor, using the grapples under Bill's guidance.\n\nThe doctor was young, and obviously scared, but fighting his fear. He'd\nbeen picked for his smallness to lighten the load on the chemical\nrocket, and his little face was intent. But he managed a weak grin.\n\n\"Thanks, Adams. I'm Doctor Ames--Ted to you. Get onto that cot. You're\nabout out on your feet.\"\n\nThe test he made didn't take long, but his head was shaking at the\nconclusion.\n\n\"Your symptoms make no sense,\" he summarized. \"I've got a feeling some\nare due to one thing, some to another. Maybe we'll have to wait until I\ncome down with it and compare notes.\"\n\nHis grin was wry, but Bill was vaguely glad that he wasn't trying\nany bedside manner. There wasn't much use in thanking the man for\nvolunteering--Ames had known what he was up against, and he might be\nscared, but his courage was above thanks.\n\n\"What about the maps?\" Bill asked. \"They tell you?\"\n\n\"They've left cutters outside. I started to bring them. Then the pumice\ngot me--I couldn't stand upright in it. They'll pick up the maps later,\nbut they're important. The competing ships will claim our territory if\nwe don't file first.\"\n\nHe knocked the dust off his instrument, and wiped his hands. Bill\nlooked down at the bed to see a fine film of Moon silt there. They'd\nbeen bringing in too much on the suits--it was too fine, and the traps\nweren't getting it fast enough.\n\nHe got up shakily, moving toward the dust trap that had been running\nsteadily. But now it was out of order, obviously, with the fur brushes\nworn down until they could generate almost no static against the rod.\nHe groped into the supplies, hoping there would be replacements.\n\nAmes caught his arm. \"Cut it out, Adams. You're in no shape for this.\nHey, how long since you've eaten?\"\n\nBill thought it over, his head thick. \"I had coffee before I landed.\"\n\nDoctor Ames nodded quickly. \"Vomiting, dizziness, tremors, excess\nsweating--what did you expect, man? You put yourself under this strain,\nnot knowing what comes next, having to land with an empty stomach,\nskipping meals and loading your stomach with pills--and probably no\nsleep! Those symptoms are perfectly normal.\"\n\nHe was at the tiny galley equipment, fixing quick food as he spoke. But\nhis face was still sober. He was probably thinking of the same thing\nthat worried Bill--an empty stomach didn't make the itching rash, the\nrunny nose and eyes, and the general misery that had begun the whole\nthing.\n\nHe sorted through the stock of replacement parts, a few field-sistors,\nsuit wadding, spare gloves, cellophane-wrapped gadgets. Then he had it.\nAmes was over, urging him toward the cot, but he shook him off.\n\n\"Got to get the dust out of here--dust'll make the itching worse.\nMoon dust is sharp, Doc. Just install new brushes.... Where are those\ninstructions? Yeah, insert the cat's fur brushes under the.... _Cat_'s\nfur? Is _that_ what they use, Doc?\"\n\n\"Sure. It's cheap and generates static electricity. Do you expect\nsable?\"\n\nBill took the can of soup and sipped it without tasting or thinking,\nhis hand going toward a fresh place that itched. His nose began\nrunning, but he disregarded it. He still felt lousy, but strength was\nflowing through him, and life was almost good again.\n\nHe tossed the bunk back into its slot, lifted the pilot's stool, and\nmotioned Ames forward. \"You operate a key--hell, I _am_ getting slow.\nYou can contact Luna Base by phone, have them relay. There. Now tell\n'em I'm blasting off pronto for Earth, and I'll be down in four hours\nwith their plans.\"\n\n\"You're crazy.\" The words were flat, but there was desperation on the\nlittle doctor's face. He glanced about hastily, taking the microphone\nwoodenly. \"Adams, they'll have an atomic bomb up to blast you out\nbefore you're near Earth. They've got to protect themselves. You\ncan't....\"\n\nBill scratched, but there was the beginning of a grin on his face.\n\"Nope, I'm not delirious now, though I damn near cracked up. You\nfigured out half the symptoms. Take a look at those brushes--cat's fur\nbrushes--and figure what they'll do to a man who was breathing the air\nand who is allergic to cats! All I ever had was some jerk in Planning\nwho didn't check my medical record with trip logistics! I never had\nthese symptoms until I unzipped the traps and turned 'em on. It got\nbetter whenever I was in the suit, breathing canned air. We should have\nknown a man can't catch a disease from plants.\"\n\nThe doctor looked at him, and at the fur pieces he'd thrown into a\nwastebin, and the whiteness ran from his face. He was seeing his own\nsalvation, and the chuckle began weakly, gathering strength as he\nturned to the microphone.\n\n\"Cat asthma--simple allergy. Who'd figure you'd get that in deep space?\nBut you're right, Bill. It figures.\"\n\nBill Adams nodded as he reached for the controls, and the tubes began\nfiring, ready to take them back to Earth. Then he caught himself and\nswung to the doctor.\n\n\"Doc,\" he said quickly, \"just be sure and tell them this isn't to get\nout. If they'll keep still about it, so will I.\"\n\nHe'd make a hell of a hero on Earth if people heard of it, and he could\nuse a little of a hero's reward.\n\nNo catcalls, thanks.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Operation Distress, by Lester del Rey\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OPERATION DISTRESS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51168.txt or 51168.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/6/51168/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
