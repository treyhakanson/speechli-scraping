The Zid raged into their communal rest\ncell, smashed them down from their gimbaled sleeping perches and, with\nthe ravening blood-hunger of its kind, devoured them before they could\nwake enough to teleport to safety.\n\nChafis Three and Four, on psi shift in the forward control cubicle,\nmight have fallen as easily if the mental screamings of their fellows\nhad not warned them in time. As it was, they had barely time to teleport\nthemselves to the after hold, as far as possible from immediate danger,\nand to consider the issue while the Zid lunged about the ship in search\nof them with malignant cries and a great shrieking of claws on metal.\n\nTheir case was the more desperate because the Chafis were professional\nfreighters with little experience of emergency. Hauling a Zid from\nCanthorian jungles to a Ciriimian zoo was a prosaic enough assignment so\nlong as the cage held, but with the raging brute swiftly smelling them\nout, they were helpless to catch and restrain it.\n\nWhen the Zid found them, they had no other course but to teleport back\nto the control cubicle and wait until the beast should snuff them down\nagain. The Zid learned quickly, so quickly that it was soon clear that\nits physical strength would far outlast their considerable but limited\ntelekinetic ability.\n\nStill they possessed their share of owlish Ciriimian logic and hit soon\nenough upon the one practical course--to jettison the Zid on the nearest\nworld demonstrably free of intelligent life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey worked hurriedly, between jumps fore and aft. Chafi Three, while\nthey were still in the control cubicle, threw the ship out of hyperdrive\nwithin scant miles of the neighboring sun's single planet. Chafi Four,\non the next jump, scanned the ship's charts and identified the system\nthrough which they traveled.\n\nLuck was with them. The system had been catalogued some four Ciriimian\ngenerations before and tagged: _Planet undeveloped. Tranquil marine\nintelligences only._\n\nThe discovery relieved them greatly for the reason that no Ciriimian,\neven to save his own feathered skin, would have set down such a monster\nas the Zid among rational but vulnerable entities.\n\nThe planet was a water world, bare of continents and only sparsely\nsprinkled with minor archipelagoes. The islands suited the Chafis'\npurpose admirably.\n\n\"The Zid does not swim,\" Chafi Four radiated. \"Marooned, it can do no\nharm to marine intelligences.\"\n\n\"Also,\" Chafi Three pointed out as they dodged to the control cubicle\nagain just ahead of the slavering Zid, \"we may return later with a\nCanthorian hunting party and recover our investment.\"\n\nClosing their perception against the Zid's distracting ragings, they set\nto work with perfect coordination.\n\nChafi Three set down the ship on an island that was only one of a\nfreckling chain of similar islands. Chafi Four projected himself first\nto the opened port; then, when the Zid charged after him, to the\nherbivore-cropped sward of tropical setting outside.\n\nThe Zid lunged out. Chafi Four teleported inside again. Chafi Three\nclosed the port. Together they relaxed their perception shields in\nrelief--\n\nUnaware in their consternation that they committed the barbarous lapse\nof vocalizing, they twittered aloud when they realized the extent of\ntheir error.\n\nAbove the far, murmurous whisper of expected marine cerebration there\nrose an uncoordinated mishmash of thought from at least two strong and\nrelatively complex intelligences.\n\n\"Gas-breathing!\" Chafi Four said unbelievingly. \"Warm-blooded,\nland-dwelling, mammalian!\"\n\n\"A Class Five culture,\" Chafi agreed shakenly. His aura quivered with\nthe shock of betrayal. \"The catalogue was _wrong_.\"\n\nIronically, their problem was more pressing now than before. Unless\nchecked, the Zid would rapidly depopulate the island--and, to check it,\nthey must break a prime rule of Galactic protocol in asking the help of\na new and untested species.\n\nBut they had no choice. They teleported at once into the presence of the\ntwo nearby natives--and met with frustration beyond Ciriimian\nexperience.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff Aubray glimpsed the Ciriimian ship's landing because the morning\nwas a Oneday, and on Onedays his mission to the island demanded that he\nbe up and about at sunrise.\n\nFor two reasons: On Onedays, through some unfailing miracle of Calaxian\nseamanship, old Charlie Mack sailed down in his ancient _Island Queen_\nfrom the township that represented colonial Terran civilization in\nProcynian Archipelago 147, bringing supplies and gossip to last Jeff\nthrough the following Tenday. The _Queen_ would dock at Jeff's little\npier at dawn; she was never late.\n\nAlso on Onedays, necessarily before Charlie Mack's visit, Jeff must\nassemble his smuggled communicator--kept dismantled and hidden from\nsuspicious local eyes--and report to Earth Interests Consulate his\nprogress during the cycle just ended. The ungodly hour of transmission,\nnaturally, was set to coincide with the closing of the Consul's field\noffice halfway around the planet.\n\nSo the nacreous glory of Procyon's rising was just tinting the windows\nof Jeff's cottage when he aligned and activated his little communicator\non his breakfast table. Its three-inch screen lighted to signal and a\ndour and disappointed Consul Satterfield looked at him. Behind\nSatterfield, foreshortened to gnomishness by the pickup, lurked Dr.\nHermann, Earth Interests' resident zoologist.\n\n\"No progress,\" Jeff reported, \"except that the few islanders I've met\nseem to be accepting me at last. A little more time and they might let\nme into the Township, where I can learn something. If Homeside--\"\n\n\"You've had seven Tendays,\" Satterfield said. \"Homeside won't wait\nlonger, Aubray. They need those calm-crystals too badly.\"\n\n\"They'll use force?\" Jeff had considered the possibility, but its\nimmediacy appalled him. \"Sir, these colonists had been autonomous for\nover two hundred years, ever since the Fourth War cut them off from us.\nWill Homeside deny their independence?\"\n\nHis sense of loss at Satterfield's grim nod stemmed from something\ndeeper than sympathy for the islanders. It found roots in his daily\nrambles over the little island granted him by the Township for the\npainting he had begun as a blind to his assignment, and in the gossip of\nold Charlie Mack and the few others he had met. He had learned to\nappreciate the easy life of the islands well enough to be dismayed now\nby what must happen under EI pressure to old Charlie and his handful of\nsun-browned fisherfolk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnexpectedly, because Jeff had not considered that it might matter, he\nwas disturbed by the realization that he wouldn't be seeing Jennifer,\nold Charlie Mack's red-haired niece, once occupation began. Jennifer,\nwho sailed with her uncle and did a crewman's work as a matter of\ncourse, would despise the sight of him.\n\nThe Consul's pessimism jolted Jeff back to the moment at hand.\n\n\"Homeside will deny their autonomy, Aubray. I've had a warp-beam message\ntoday ordering me to move in.\"\n\nThe situation was desperate enough at home, Jeff had to admit. Calaxian\ncalm-crystals did what no refinement of Terran therapeutics had been\nable to manage. They erased the fears of the neurotic and calmed the\nquiverings of the hypertensive--both in alarming majority in the\nshattering aftermath of the Fourth War--with no adverse effects at all.\nPermanent benefit was slow but cumulative, offering for the first time a\nreal step toward ultimate stability. The medical, psychiatric and\npolitical fields cried out for crystals and more crystals.\n\n\"If the islanders would tell us their source and let us help develop\nit,\" Satterfield said peevishly, \"instead of doling out a handful of\ncrystals every Tenday, there wouldn't be any need of action. Homeside\nfeels they're just letting us have some of the surplus.\"\n\n\"Not likely,\" Jeff said. \"They don't use the crystals themselves.\"\n\nOld Dr. Hermann put his chin almost on the Consul's shoulder to present\nhis wizened face to the scanner.\n\n\"Of course they don't,\" he said. \"On an uncomplicated, even\nsimple-minded world like this, who would need crystals? But maybe they\nfear glutting the market or the domination of outside capital coming in\nto develop the source. When people backslide, there's no telling what's\non their minds and we have no time to waste negotiating or convincing\nthem. In any case, how could they stop us from moving in?\" Abruptly he\nswitched to his own interest. \"Aubray, have you learned anything new\nabout the Scoops?\"\n\n\"Nothing beyond the fact that the islanders don't talk about them,\" Jeff\nsaid. \"I've seen perhaps a dozen offshore during the seven cycles I've\nbeen here. One usually surfaces outside my harbor at about the time old\nCharlie Mack's supply boat comes in.\"\n\nThinking of Charlie Mack brought a forced end to his report. \"Charlie's\ndue now. I'll call back later.\"\n\nHe cut the circuit, hurrying to have his communicator stowed away before\nold Charlie's arrival--not, he thought bitterly, that being found out\nnow would make any great difference.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStepping out into the brief Calaxian dawn, he caught his glimpse of the\nCiriimian ship's landing before the island forest of palm-ferns cut it\noff from sight. Homeside hadn't been bluffing, he thought, assuming as a\nmatter of course that this was the task force Satterfield had been\nordered to send.\n\n\"They didn't waste any time,\" Jeff growled. \"Damn them.\"\n\nHe ignored the inevitable glory of morning rainbow that just preceded\nProcyon's rising and strode irritably down to his miniature dock. He was\nstill scowling over what he should tell Charlie Mack when the _Island\nQueen_ hove into view.\n\nShe was a pretty sight. There was an artist's perception in Jeff in\nspite of his drab years of EI patrol duty; the white puff of sail on\ndark-green sea, gliding across calm water banded with lighter and darker\nstriae where submerged shoals lay, struck something responsive in him.\nThe comparison it forced between Calaxia and Earth, whose yawning Fourth\nWar scars and heritage of anxieties made calm-crystals so desperately\nnecessary, oppressed him. Calaxia was wholly unscarred, her people\nwithout need of the calm-crystals they traded.\n\nSomething odd in the set of the _Queen's_ sails puzzled him until he\nidentified the abnormality. In spite of distance and the swift approach\nof the old fishing boat, he could have sworn that her sails bellied not\nwith the wind, but against.\n\nThey fell slack, however, when the _Queen_ reached his channel and\nflapped lazily, reversing to catch the wind and nose her cautiously into\nthe shallows. Jeff dismissed it impatiently--a change of wind or some\ncrafty maneuver of old Charlie Mack's to take advantage of the current.\n\nJeff had just set foot on his dock when it happened. Solid as the\nplanking itself, and all but blocking off his view of the nearing\n_Island Queen_, stood a six-foot owl.\n\nIt was wingless and covered smoothly with pastel-blue feathers. It stood\nsolidly on carefully manicured yellow feet and stared at him out of\nsquare violet eyes.\n\nInvoluntarily he took a backward step, caught his heel on a sun-warped\nboard and sat down heavily.\n\n\"Well, what the devil!\" he said inanely.\n\nThe owl winced and disappeared without a sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJeff got up shakily and stumbled to the dock's edge. A chill conviction\nof insanity gripped him when he looked down on water lapping smooth and\nundisturbed below.\n\n\"I've gone mad,\" he said aloud.\n\nOut on the bay, another catastrophe just as improbable was in progress.\n\nOld Charlie Mack's _Island Queen_ had veered sharply off course, left\nthe darker-green stripe of safe channel and plunged into water too\nshallow for her draft. The boat heeled on shoal sand, listed and hung\naground with wind-filled sails holding her fast.\n\nThe Scoop that had surfaced just behind her was so close that Jeff\nwondered if its species' legendary good nature had been misrepresented.\nIt floated like a glistening plum-colored island, flat dorsal flippers\nundulating gently on the water and its great filmy eyes all but closed\nagainst the slanting glare of morning sun.\n\nIt was more than vast. The thing must weigh, Jeff thought dizzily,\nthousands or maybe millions of tons.\n\nHe thought he understood the _Queen's_ grounding when he saw the\nswimmer stroking urgently toward his dock. Old Charlie had abandoned his\nboat and was swimming in to escape the Scoop.\n\nBut it wasn't Charlie. It was Jennifer, Charlie's niece.\n\nJeff took the brown hand she put up and drew her to the dock beside her,\nsteadying her while she shook out her dripping red hair and regained her\nbreath. Sea water had plastered Jennifer's white blouse and knee-length\ndungarees to her body like a second skin, and the effect bordered on the\nspectacular.\n\n\"Did you see it?\" she demanded.\n\nJeff wrestled his eyes away to the Scoop that floated like a purple\nisland in the bay.\n\n\"A proper monster,\" he said. \"You got out just in time.\"\n\nShe looked at once startled and impatient. \"Not the Scoop, you idiot.\nThe owl.\"\n\nIt was Jeff's turn to stare. \"Owl? There was one on the dock, but I\nthought--\"\n\n\"So did I.\" She sounded relieved. \"But if you saw one, too.... All of a\nsudden, it was standing there on deck beside me, right out of nowhere. I\nlost my head and grounded the _Queen_, and it vanished. The owl, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"So did mine,\" Jeff said.\n\nWhile they stood marveling, the owls came back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChafis Three and Four were horribly shaken by the initial attempt at\ncommunication with the natives. Nothing in Ciriimian experience had\nprepared them for creatures intelligent but illogical, individually\nperceptive yet isolated from each other.\n\n\"Communication by audible symbol,\" Chafi Three said. He ruffled his\nfeathers in a shudder. \"Barbarous!\"\n\n\"Atavistic,\" agreed Chafi Four. \"They could even _lie_ to each other.\"\n\nBut their dilemma remained. They must warn the natives before the\nprowling Zid found them, else there would be no natives.\n\n\"We must try again,\" Three concluded, \"searching out and using the\nproper symbols for explanation.\"\n\n\"Vocally,\" said Chafi Four.\n\nThey shuddered and teleported.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe sudden reappearance of his hallucination--doubled--startled Jeff no\nmore than the fact that he seemed to be holding Jennifer Mack tightly.\nAmazingly, his immediate problem was not the possibility of harm from\nthe owls, but whether he should reassure Jennifer before or after\nreleasing her.\n\nHe compromised by leaving the choice to her. \"They can't be dangerous,\"\nhe said. \"There are no land-dwelling predators on Calaxia. I read that\nin--\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Nothing like _that_ ever hatched out on Calaxia,\" said Jennifer. She\npulled free of him. \"If they're real, they came from somewhere else.\"\n\nThe implication drew a cold finger down Jeff's spine. \"That would mean\nother cultures out here. And in all our years of planet-hunting, we\nhaven't found one.\"\n\nMemory chilled him further.\n\n\"A ship landed inland a few minutes ago,\" he said. \"I took it for an EI\nconsulate craft, but it could have been--\"\n\nThe Ciriimians caught his mental image of the landing and intervened\nwhile common ground offered.\n\n\"The ship was ours,\" said Chafi Three. He had not vocalized since\nfledgling days and his voice had a jarring croak of disuse. \"Our Zid\nescaped its cage and destroyed two of us, forcing us to maroon it here\nfor our own safety. Unfortunately, we trusted our star manual's\nstatement that the planet is unpopulated.\"\n\nThe Terrans drew together again.\n\n\"Zid?\" Jeff echoed.\n\nChafi Four relieved his fellow of the strain by trying his own rusty\ncroak. \"A vicious Canthorian predator, combing the island at this moment\nfor prey. You must help us to recapture it.\"\n\n\"So that you may identify it,\" Chafi Three finished helpfully, \"the Zid\nhas this appearance.\"\n\nHis psi projection of the Zid appeared on the dock before them with\ndemoniac abruptness--crouched to leap, twin tails lashing and its\nten-foot length bristling with glassy magenta bristles. It had a lethal\npair of extra limbs that sprang from the shoulders to end in taloned\nseizing-hands, and its slanted red eyes burned malevolently from a\nsnouted, razor-fanged face.\n\nIt was too real to bear. Jeff stepped back on suddenly unreliable legs.\nJennifer fainted against him and the unexpected weight of her sent them\nboth sprawling to the dock.\n\n\"We lean on weak reeds,\" Chafi Three said. \"Creatures who collapse with\nterror at the mere projection of a Zid can be of little assistance in\nrecapturing one.\"\n\nChafi Four agreed reluctantly. \"Then we must seek aid elsewhere.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Jeff Aubray pulled himself up from the planking, the apparitions\nwere gone. His knees shook and perspiration crawled cold on his face,\nbut he managed to haul Jennifer up with him.\n\n\"Come out of it, will you?\" he yelled ungallantly in her ear. \"If a\nthing like that is loose on the island, we've got to get help!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJennifer did not respond and he slapped her, until her eyes fluttered\nangrily.\n\n\"There's an EI communicator in my cabin,\" Jeff said. \"Let's go.\"\n\nMemory lent Jennifer a sudden vitality that nearly left Jeff behind in\ntheir dash for the cottage up the beach.\n\n\"The door,\" Jeff panted, inside. \"Fasten the hurricane bolt. Hurry.\"\n\nWhile she secured the flimsy door, he ripped through his belongings,\naligning his EI communicator again on his breakfast table. Finding out\nwhere the islanders got their calm-crystals had become suddenly\nunimportant; just then, he wanted nothing so much as to see a well-armed\npatrol ship nosing down out of the Calaxian sunrise.\n\nHe was activating the screen when Jennifer, in a magnificent rage in\nspite of soaked blouse and dungarees, advanced on him.\n\n\"You're an Earth Interests spy after all,\" she accused. \"They said in\nthe Township you are no artist, but Uncle Charlie and I--\"\n\nJeff made a pushing motion. \"Keep away from me. Do you want that devil\ntearing the cabin down around us?\"\n\nShe fell quiet, remembering the Zid, and he made his call. \"Aubray,\nChain 147. Come in, Consulate!\"\n\nThere was a sound of stealthy movement outside the cabin and he flicked\nsweat out of his eyes with a hand that shook.\n\n\"EI, for God's sake, come in! I'm in trouble here!\"\n\nThe image on his three-inch screen was not Consul Satterfield's but the\nstartled consulate operator's. \"Trouble?\"\n\nJeff forced stumbling words into line. The EI operator shook his head\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"Consul's gone for the day, Aubray. I'll see if I can reach him.\"\n\n\"He was about to send out an EI patrol ship to take over here in the\nislands,\" Jeff said. \"Tell him to hurry it!\"\n\nHe knew when he put down the microphone that the ship would be too late.\nEI might still drag the secret of the calm-crystal source out of the\nislanders, but Jeff Aubray and Jennifer Mack wouldn't be on hand to\nwitness their sorry triumph. The flimsy cabin could not stand for long\nagainst the sort of brute the owls had shown him, and there was no sort\nof weapon at hand. They couldn't even run.\n\n\"There's something outside,\" Jennifer said in a small voice.\n\nHer voice seemed to trigger the attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Zid lunged against the door with a force that cracked the wooden\nhurricane bolt across and opened a three-inch slit between leading edge\nand lintel. Jeff had a glimpse of slanted red eyes and white-fanged\nsnout before reflex sent him headlong to shoulder the door shut again.\n\n\"The bunk,\" he panted at Jennifer. \"Shove it over.\"\n\nBetween them, they wedged the bunk against the door and held it in\nplace. Then they stood looking palely at each other and waiting for the\nnext attack.\n\nIt came from a different quarter--the wide double windows that\noverlooked the bay. The Zid, rearing upright, smashed away the flimsy\nrattan blinds with a taloned seizing-hand and looked redly in at them.\n\nLike a man in a dream, Jeff caught up his communicator from the table\nand hurled it. The Zid caught it deftly, sank glistening teeth into the\nunit and demolished it with a single snap.\n\nCrushed, the rig's powerful little battery discharged with a muffled\nsputtering and flashing of sparks. The Zid howled piercingly and dropped\naway from the window.\n\nThat gave Jeff time enough to reach the storm shutters and secure\nthem--only to rush again with Jennifer to their bunk barricade as the\nZid promptly renewed its ferocious attack on the door.\n\nHe flinched when Jennifer, to be heard above the Zid's ragings, shouted\nin his ear: \"My Scoop should have the _Queen_ afloat by now. Can we\nreach her?\"\n\n\"Scoop?\" The Zid's avid cries discouraged curiosity before it was well\nborn. \"We'd never make it. We couldn't possibly outrun that beast.\"\n\nThe Zid crashed against the door and drove it inches ajar, driving back\ntheir barricade. One taloned paw slid in and slashed viciously at\nrandom. Jeff ducked and strained his weight against the bunk,\nmomentarily pinning the Zid's threshing forelimb.\n\nChafi Three chose that moment to reappear, nearly causing Jeff to let go\nthe bunk and admit the Zid.\n\n\"Your female's suggestion is right,\" the Ciriimian croaked. \"The Zid\ndoes not swim. Four and I are arranging escape on that premise.\"\n\nThe Zid's talons ripped through the door, leaving parallel rows of\nsplintered breaks. Both slanted red eyes glared in briefly.\n\n\"Then you'd damn well better hurry,\" Jeff panted. The door, he\nestimated, might--or might not--hold for two minutes more.\n\nThe Ciriimian vanished. There was a slithering sound in the distance\nthat sounded like a mountain in motion, and with it a stertorous\ngrunting that all but drowned out the Zid's cries. Something nudged the\ncottage with a force that all but knocked it flat.\n\n\"_My Scoop!_\" Jennifer exclaimed. She let go the barricade and ran to\nthe window to throw open the storm shutters. \"Never mind the door. This\nway, quick!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe scrambled to the window sill and jumped. Numbly, Jeff saw her\nsuspended there, feet only inches below the sill, apparently on empty\nair. Then the door sagged again under the Zid's lungings and he left the\nbunk to follow Jennifer.\n\nHe landed on something tough and warm and slippery, a monstrous tail\nfluke that stretched down the beach to merge into a flat purplish\nacreage of back, forested with endless rows of fins and spines and\nenigmatic tendrils. The Scoop, he saw, and only half believed it, had\nwallowed into the shallows alongside his dock. It had reversed its\nunbelievable length to keep the head submerged, and at the same time had\nbacked out of the water until its leviathan tail spanned the hundred-odd\nyards of sloping beach from surf to cabin.\n\nJust ahead of him, Jennifer caught an erect fin-spine and clung with\nboth arms. \"Hang on! We're going--\"\n\nThe Scoop contracted itself with a suddenness that yanked them yards\nfrom the cottage and all but dislodged Jeff. Beyond the surf, the\nshallows boiled whitely where the Scoop fought for traction to draw its\ngrounded bulk into the water.\n\nJeff looked back once to see the Zid close the distance between and\nspring upward to the tail fluke behind him. He had an instant conviction\nthat the brute's second spring would see him torn to bits, but the Scoop\nat the moment found water deep enough to move in earnest. The Zid could\nonly sink in all six taloned limbs and hold fast.\n\nThe hundred-odd yards from cabin to beach passed in a blur of speed. The\nScoop reached deeper water and submerged, throwing a mountainous billow\nthat sent the _Island Queen_ reeling and all but foundered her.\n\nJeff was dislodged instantly and sank like a stone.\n\nHe came up, spouting water and fighting for breath, to find himself a\nperilous twenty feet from the Zid. The Zid, utterly out of its element,\nscreamed hideously and threshed water to froth, all its earlier ferocity\nvanished under the imminent and unfamiliar threat of drowning. Jeff sank\nagain and churned desperately to put distance between them.\n\nHe came up again, nearly strangled, to find that either he or the Zid\nhad halved the distance between them. They were all but eye to eye when\nJennifer caught him and towed him away toward the doubtful safety of the\n_Island Queen_.\n\nChafis Three and Four appeared from nowhere and stood solemnly by while\nthe Zid weakened and sank with a final gout of bubbles.\n\n\"We must have your friend's help,\" Chafi Three said to Jennifer then,\n\"to recover our investment.\"\n\nJeff wheeled on him incredulously. \"_Me_ go down there after that\nmonster? Not on your--\"\n\n\"He means the Scoop,\" Jennifer said. \"They brought it ashore to help us\nout of the cabin. Why shouldn't it help them now?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Scoop came up out of the water so smoothly that the _Island Queen_\nhardly rocked, dangling the limp form of the Zid from its great rubbery\nlips like a drowned kitten.\n\n\"Here,\" Jennifer said.\n\nThe Scoop touched its vast face to the _Queen's_ rail and dropped the\nunconscious body to the deck. The Zid twitched weakly and coughed up\nfroth and water.\n\nJeff backed away warily. \"Damn it, are we going through all that again?\nOnce it gets its wind back--\"\n\nChafi Three interrupted him this time. \"The crystal now. We must have it\nto quiet the Zid until it is safely caged again.\"\n\nJennifer turned suddenly firm. \"No. I won't let this EI informer know\nabout that.\"\n\nThe Ciriimians were firmer.\n\n\"It will not matter now. Galactic Adjustment will extend aid to both\nCalaxia and Terra, furnishing substitutes for the crystals you deal in.\nThere will be no loss to either faction.\"\n\n\"No loss?\" Jennifer repeated indignantly. \"But then there won't be any\ndemand for our crystals! We'll lose everything we've gained.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" Chafi Three assured her. \"Galactic will offer satisfactory\nitems in exchange, as well as a solution to Terra's problems.\"\n\nThe Scoop, sensing Jennifer's surrender, slid its ponderous bulk nearer\nand opened its mouth, leaving half an acre of lower jaw resting flush\nwith the _Island Queen's_ deck. Without hesitation, Jennifer stepped\nover the rail and vanished into the yawning pinkish cavern beyond.\n\nAppalled, Jeff rushed after her. \"Jennifer! Have you lost your mind?\"\n\n\"There is no danger,\" Chafi Three assured him. \"Scoops are benevolent as\nwell as intelligent, and arrived long ago at a working agreement with\nthe islanders. This one has produced a crystal and is ready to be\nrelieved of it, else it would not have attached itself to a convenient\nhuman.\"\n\nJeff said dizzily, \"The Scoops make the crystals?\"\n\n\"There is a nidus just back of a fleshy process in its throat,\ncorresponding to your own tonsils, which produces a crystal much as your\nTerran oyster secretes a pearl. The irritation distracts the Scoops from\ntheir meditations--they are a philosophical species, though not\nmechanically progressive--and prompts them to barter their strength for\na time to be rid of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJennifer reappeared with a walnut-sized crystal in her hand and vaulted\nacross the rail.\n\n\"There goes another Scoop,\" she said resignedly. \"The _Queen_ will have\nto tack with the wind for a while until another one shows up.\"\n\n\"So that's why your sails bellied backward when you came in to harbor,\"\nsaid Jeff. \"The thing was _towing_ you.\"\n\nA thin, high streak of vapor-trail needling down toward them from the\nsunrise rainbow turned the channel of his thought.\n\n\"That will be Satterfield and his task force,\" Jeff told the Chafis. \"I\nthink you're going to find yourselves in an argument over that matter of\nsqueezing Terra out of the crystal trade.\"\n\nThey reassured him solemnly.\n\n\"Terra has no real need of the crystals. We can offer a tested genetics\nprogram that will eliminate racial anxiety within a few generations, and\nsupply neural therapy equipment--on a trade basis, of course--that will\nserve the crystals' purpose during the interim.\"\n\nThere should be a flaw somewhere, Jeff felt, but he failed to see one.\nHe gave up trying when he found Jennifer eying him with uncharacteristic\nuncertainty.\n\n\"You'll be glad to get back to your patrol work,\" she said. It had an\noddly tentative sound.\n\nSomehow the predictable monotony of consulate work had never seemed less\ninviting. The prospect of ending his Calaxian tour and going back to a\nhalf-barren and jittery Earth appealed to Jeff even less.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'd like to stay.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to do but fish and sail around looking for Scoops ready\nto shed their crystals,\" Jennifer reminded him. \"Still, Uncle Charlie\nhas talked about settling in the Township and standing for Council\nelection. Can you fish and sail, Jeff Aubray?\"\n\nThe consulate rocket landed ashore, but Jeff ignored it.\n\n\"I can learn,\" he said.\n\n                                                           --ROGER DEE\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy_ February 1958.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
