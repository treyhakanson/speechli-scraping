My name is George Randolph. I was,\nthat momentous afternoon, assistant chemist for the Ajax International\nDye Company, with main offices in New York City.\n\nIt was twelve-twenty when the local exchange call-sorter announced\nAlan's connection from Quebec.\n\n\"Hello, George? Look here, you've got to come up here at once. Chateau\nFrontenac, Quebec. Will you come?\"\n\nI could see his face imaged in the little mirror on my desk; the\nanxiety, tenseness in his voice, was duplicated in his expression.\n\n\"Well--\" I began.\n\n\"You must, George. Babs and I need you. See here....\"\n\nHe tried at first to make it sound like an invitation for a New Year's\nEve holiday. But I knew it was not that. Alan and Barbara were my best\nfriends. They were twins, eighteen years old. I felt that Alan would\nalways be my best friend; but for Babs, my hopes, longings, went far\ndeeper, though as yet I had never brought myself to the point of telling\nher so.\n\n\"I'd like to come, Alan. But--\"\n\n\"You've got to George! I can't tell you everything over the public air.\nBut I've seen _him_: He's diabolical. I know it now!\"\n\n_Him_! It could only mean, of all the world, one person!\n\n\"He's here!\" he went on. \"Near here. We saw him today! I didn't want to\ntell you, but that's why we came. It seemed a long chance, but it's he,\nI'm positive!\"\n\nI was staring at the image of Alan's eyes; there was horror in them. And\nhis voice too. \"God, George, it's weird! Weird, I tell you. His\nlooks--he--oh I can't tell you now! Only, come!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was busy at the office in spite of the holiday season, but I dropped\neverything and went. By one o'clock that afternoon I was wheeling my\nlittle sport Midge from its cage on the roof of the Metropole building,\nand went into the air.\n\nIt was a cold gray afternoon with the feel of coming snow. I made a good\ntwo hundred and fifty miles at first, taking the northbound\nthrough-traffic lane which today the meteorological conditions had\nplaced at an altitude of 6,200 feet.\n\nFlying is largely automatic. There was not enough traffic to bother me.\nThe details of leaving the office so hastily had been too engrossing for\nthought of Alan and Babs. But now, in my little pit at the controls, my\nmind flung ahead. They had located him. That meant Franz Polter, for\nwhom we had been searching nearly four years. And my memory went back\ninto the past with vivid vision....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Kents, four years ago, were living on Long Island. Alan and Babs\nwere fourteen at the time, and I was seventeen. Even then Babs was\nsomething kind of special to me. I lived in a neighboring house that\nsummer and saw them every day.\n\nTo my adolescent mind a thrilling mystery hung upon the Kent family. The\nmother was dead. Dr. Kent, father of Alan and Babs, maintained a\nluxurious home, with only a housekeeper and no other servant. Dr. Kent\nwas a retired chemist. He had, in his home, a laboratory in which he was\nworking upon some mysterious problem. His children did not know what it\nwas, nor, of course, did I. And none of us had ever been in the\nlaboratory, except that when occasion offered we stole surreptitious\npeeps.\n\nI recall Dr. Kent as a kindly, iron-gray haired gentleman. He was stern\nwith the discipline of his children; but he loved them, and was\nindulgent in many ways. They loved him; and I, an orphan, began looking\nupon him almost as a father. I was interested in chemistry. He knew it,\nand did his best to help and encourage me in my studies.\n\nThere came an afternoon in the summer of 1966, when arriving at the Kent\nhome, I ran upon a startling scene. The only other member of the\nhousehold was a young fellow of twenty-five, named Franz Polter. He was\na foreigner, born, I understood, in one of the Balkan Protectorates; he\nwas here, employed by Dr. Kent as laboratory assistant.\n\nHe had been with the Kents, at this time, two years. Alan and Babs\ndidn't like him, nor did I. He must have been a clever, skillful\nchemist. No doubt he was. But he was, to us, repulsive. A hunchback,\nwith a short, thick body; dangling arms that suggested a gorilla; barrel\nchest; a lump set askew on his left shoulder, and his massive head\nplanted down with almost no neck. His face was rugged in feature; a wide\nmouth, a high-bridged heavy nose; and above the face a great shock of\nwavy black hair. It was an intelligent face; in itself, not repulsive.\n\nBut I think we all three feared Franz Polter. There was always something\nsinister about him, that had nothing to do with his deformity.\n\nWhen I came, that afternoon, Babs and Polter were under a tree on the\nKent lawn. Babs, at fourteen, with long black braids down her back,\nbare-legged and short-skirted in a summer sport costume, was standing\nagainst the tree with Polter facing her. They were about the same\nheight. To my youthful imaginative mind rose the fleeting picture of a\nyoung girl in a forest menaced by a gorilla.\n\nI came upon them suddenly. I heard Polter say:\n\n\"But I lof you. And you are almos' a woman. Some day you lof me.\"\n\nHe put out his thick hand and gripped her shoulder. She tried to twist\naway. She was frightened, but she laughed.\n\n\"You--you're crazy!\"\n\nHe was suddenly holding her in his arms, and she was fighting him. I\ndashed forward. Babs was always a spunky sort of girl. In spite of her\nfear now, she kept on struggling, and she shouted:\n\n\"You--let me go, you--you hunchback!\"\n\nHe did let her go; but in a frenzy of rage he hauled back his hand and\nstruck her in the face. I was upon him the next second. I had him down\non the lawn, punching him; but though at seventeen I was a reasonably\nhusky lad, the hunchback with his thick, hairy gorilla arms proved much\nstronger. He heaved me off. The commotion had brought Alan and without\nwaiting to find out what the trouble was, he jumped on Polter. Between\nus, I think we would have beaten him pretty badly. But the housekeeper\nsummoned Dr. Kent and the fight was over.\n\nPolter left for good within an hour. He did not speak to any of us. But\nI saw him as he put his luggage into the taxi which Dr. Kent had\nsummoned. I was standing silently nearby with Babs and Alan. The look he\nflung us as he drove away carried an unmistakable menace--the promise of\nvengeance. And I think now that in his warped and twisted mind he was\ntelling himself that he would some day make Babs regret that she had\nrepulsed his love.\n\nWhat happened that night none of us ever knew. Dr. Kent worked late in\nhis laboratory; he was there when Alan and Babs and the housekeeper went\nto bed. He had written a note to Alan; it was found on his desk in a\ncorner of the laboratory next morning, addressed in care of the family\nlawyer to be given Alan in the event of his death. It said very little.\nDescribed a tiny fragment of gold quartz rock the size of a walnut which\nwould be found under the giant microscope in the laboratory; and told\nAlan to give it to the American Scientific Society to be guarded and\nwatched very carefully.\n\nThis note was found, but Dr. Kent had vanished! There had been a\nmidnight marauder. The laboratory was on the lower floor of the house.\nThrough one of its open windows, so the police said, an intruder had\nentered. There was evidence of a struggle, but it must have been short,\nbecause neither Babs, Alan, the housekeeper, nor any of the neighbors\nhad heard anything. And the fragment of golden quartz was gone!\n\nThe police investigation came to nothing. Polter was found in New York.\nHe withstood the police questions. There was nothing except suspicion\nupon which he could be held, and he was finally released. Immediately\nthereafter, he disappeared.\n\nNeither Alan, Babs nor I saw Polter again. Dr. Kent had never been heard\nfrom to this day, four years later when I flew to join the twins in\nQuebec. And now Alan told me that Polter was up there! We had never\nceased to believe that Dr. Kent was alive, and that Polter was the\nmidnight marauder. As we grew older, we began to search for Polter. It\nseemed to us, that if we could once get our hands on him, we could drag\nfrom him the truth which the police had failed to get.\n\nThe call of a traffic director in mid-Vermont brought me back from these\nmemories. My buzzer was clanging; a peremptory halting signal day-beam\ncame darting up at me from below. It caught me and clung. I shouted down\nat it.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I gave my name and number and all the details in\none breath. Above everything I had no wish to be halted now. \"What's the\nmatter? I haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"The hell you haven't,\" the director roared. \"Come down to three\nthousand. That lane's barred.\"\n\nI dove obediently and his beam followed me. \"Once more, like that, young\nfellow--\" But he went busy with somebody else and I didn't hear the end\nof his threat.\n\nI crossed into Maine in mid-afternoon. It was already twilight. The sky\nwas solid lead and the landscape all up through here was gray-white with\nsnow in the gathering darkness. I passed the City of Jackman, crossing\nfull over it to take no chances of annoying the border officials; and a\nfew miles further, I dropped to the glaring lights of International\nInspection Field. The formalities were soon finished. I was ready to\ntake-off when Alan rushed at me.\n\n\"George! I thought I could connect here.\" He gripped me. He was\nwild-eyed, incoherent. He waved his taxiplane away. \"I'm going with you,\nGeorge. I'm almost out of my mind. I can't--I don't know what's happened\nto her. She's gone, now--\"\n\n\"Who's gone? Babs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He pushed me into my plane and climbed in after me. \"Don't talk.\nGet us up! I'll tell you then. I shouldn't have left.\"\n\nWhen we were up in the air, I swung on him. \"What are you talking about?\nBabs gone?\"\n\nI could feel myself shuddering with a nameless horror.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm talking about, George. I'm about crazy. The\nQuebec police think I am, anyway. I've been raising hell with them for\nan hour. Babs is gone! I can't find her. I don't know where she is.\"\n\nHe finally calmed down enough to tell me what happened. Shortly after\nhis radiophone to me in New York, he had missed Babs. They had had lunch\nin the huge hotel and then walked on the Dufferin Terrace--the famous\npromenade outside looking down over the Lower City, the great sweep of\nthe St. Lawrence River and the gray-white distant Laurentian mountains.\n\n\"I was to meet her inside. I went in ahead of her. But she didn't come.\nI went back to the Terrace but she was gone. She wasn't in our rooms.\nNor the library, the lobby--anywhere.\"\n\nBut it was afternoon, in the public place of a civilized city. In the\ndaylight of the Dufferin Terrace, beside the long ice toboggan slide,\nunder the gaze of skaters on the ice-rink and several hundred holiday\nmerrymakers, a young girl could hardly be murdered, or kidnapped,\nwithout attracting attention! The Quebec police thought the young\nAmerican unduly excited about his sister, who was missing only an hour.\nThey would do what they could, if by dark she had not rejoined him. They\nsuggested that doubtless the young lady had gone shopping.\n\n\"Maybe she did,\" I agreed. But in my heart, I felt differently. \"She'll\nbe waiting for us in the Hotel when we get there, Alan.\"\n\n\"But I'm telling you we saw Polter this morning. He lives here--not\nthirty miles from Quebec. We saw him on the Terrace after breakfast.\nRecognized him immediately of course.\"\n\n\"Did he see you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was lost in the crowd in a minute. But I asked a\nyoung French fellow if he knew him. He did know him, as Frank Rascor.\nThat must be the name he wears now. He's a famous man up here--well\nknown, immensely rich. I didn't know if he saw us or not. What a fool I\nwas to leave Babs alone, even for a minute.\"\n\nWe were speeding over a white-clad valley with a little frozen river\nwinding down its middle. Night had almost come. The leaden sky was low\nabove us. It began snowing. The lights of the small villages along the\nriver were barely visible.\n\n\"Can you land us, Alan?\"\n\n\"Yes, surely. At the Municipal Field just beyond the Citadel. We can get\nto the Hotel in five minutes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a flight of only half an hour. During it, Alan told me about\nPolter. The hunchback, known now as Frank Rascor, owned a mine in the\nLaurentians, some thirty miles from Quebec City--a fabulously productive\nmine of gold. It was an anomaly that gold should be produced in this\nregion. No vein of gold-bearing rock had been found, except the one on\nPolter's property. Alan had seen a newspaper account of the strangeness\nof it; and on a hunch had come to Quebec, being intrigued by the\ndescription of the mine owner. He had seen Frank Rascor on the Dufferin\nTerrace, and recognized him as Polter.\n\nAgain my thoughts went back into the past. Had Polter stolen that\nmissing fragment of golden quartz the size of a walnut which had been\nbeneath Dr. Kent's microscope? We always thought so. Dr. Kent had some\nsecret, some great problem upon which he was working. Polter, his\nassistant, had evidently known, or partially known, its details. And\nnow, four years later, Polter was immensely rich, with a \"gold mine\" in\nmountains where there was no other evidence of gold!\n\nI seemed to see some connection. Alan, I knew, was groping with a dim\nidea, so strange he hardly dared voice it.\n\n\"I tell you, it's weird, George. The sight of him. Polter--heavens, one\ncouldn't mistake that build--and his face, his features, just the same\nas when we knew him.\"\n\n\"Then what's so weird?\" I demanded.\n\n\"His age.\" There was a queer solemn hush in Alan's voice. \"George, when\nwe knew Polter, he was about twenty-five, wasn't he? Well, that was four\nyears ago. But he isn't twenty-nine now. I swear it is the same man, but\nhe isn't around thirty. Don't ask me what I'm talking about. I don't\nknow. But he isn't thirty. He's nearer fifty! Unnatural! Weird! I felt\nit, and so did Babs, just that brief look we had of him.\"\n\nI didn't answer. My attention was on managing the plane. The lights of\nLevis were under us. Beyond the City cliffs, the St. Lawrence lay in its\ndeep valley; the Quebec lights, the light-dotted ramparts with the\nTerrace and the great fortresslike Hotel showed across the river.\n\n\"Better take the stick, Alan. I don't know where the field is. And don't\nyou worry about Babs. She'll be back by now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut she was not. We went to the two connecting rooms in the tower of the\nHotel which Alan and Babs had engaged. We inquired with half a dozen\nphone calls. No one had seen or heard from her. The Quebec police were\nsending a man up to talk with Alan.\n\n\"Well, we won't be here,\" Alan called to me. He was standing by the\nwindow in Babs' room; he was trembling too much to use the phone. I hung\nup the receiver and went though the connecting door to join him.\n\nBabs' room! It sent a pang through me. A few of her garments were lying\naround. A negligee was laid out on the large bed. A velvet boudoir\ndoll--she had always loved them--stood on the dresser. Upon this Hotel\nroom, in one day, she had impressed her personality. Her perfume was in\nthe air. And now she was gone.\n\n\"We won't be here,\" Alan was repeating. He gripped me at the window.\n\"Look.\" In his hand was an ugly-looking, smokeless, soundless automatic\nof the Essen type. \"And I've got another one for you. Brought them with\nme.\"\n\nHis face was white and drawn, but his hands had steadied. The tremble\nwas gone out of his voice.\n\n\"I'm going after him, George! Now! Understand that? Now? His place is\nonly thirty miles from here, out there in the mountains. You can see it\nin the daylight--a wall around his property and a stone castle which he\nbuilt in the middle of it. A gold mine? Hell!\"\n\nThere was nothing to be seen now out of the window but the snow-filled\ndarkness, the blurred lights of Lower Quebec and the line of dock lights\nfive hundred feet below us.\n\n\"Will you fly me, George?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nI was the one trembling now; the cool feel of the automatic which Alan\nthrust into my hand seemed suddenly to crystallize Babs' peril. I was\nhere in her room, with the scent of her perfume around me, and this\ndeadly weapon was needed! But the trembling was gone in a moment.\n\n\"Yes, of course, Alan. No use talking to the police. I gave them all the\ninformation--a description of her, what you said she was wearing. No\nsense dragging Polter's name into it, with nothing tangible to go on.\nThe police won't ransack the castle of a rich man just because you can't\nfind your sister. Come on. You can tell me what this place is like as we\ngo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBundled in our flying suits we hurried from the Hotel, climbed the\nCitadel slope and in ten minutes were in the air. The wind sucked at us.\nThe snow now was falling with thick, huge flakes. Directed by Alan, I\nheaded out over this ice-filled St. Lawrence, past the frozen Ile\nd'Orleans, toward Polter's mysterious mountain castle.\n\nSuddenly Alan burst out, \"I know what father's secret was! I can piece\nit together now, from little things that were meaningless when I was a\nkid. He invented the electro-microscope. You know that. The infinitely\nsmall fascinated him. I remember he once said that if we could see far\nenough down into smallness, we would come upon human life!\"\n\nAlan's low, tense voice was more vehement than I had ever heard it\nbefore. \"It's clear to me now, George. That little fragment of golden\nquartz which he wanted me to be so careful of contained a world with\nhuman inhabitants! Father knew it, or suspected it. And I think the\nchemical problem on which he was working aimed for some drug. I know it\nwas a drug they were compounding, Polter said so once, a radioactive\ndrug; I remember listening at the door. A drug, George, capable of\nmaking a human being infinitely small!\"\n\nI did not answer when momentarily Alan paused. So strange a thing. My\nmind whirled with it; struggled to encompass it. And like the\nmeaningless individual pieces of a puzzle, dropping so easily into place\nwhen the key piece is fitted, I saw Polter stealing that fragment of\ngold; abducting Dr. Kent--perhaps because Polter himself was not fully\nacquainted with the secret. And now, Polter up here with a fabulously\nrich \"gold mine.\" And Babs, abducted by him, to be taken--where?\n\nIt set me shuddering.\n\n\"That's what it was,\" Alan reiterated. \"And Polter, here now with what\nhe calls a 'mine.' It isn't a mine, it's a laboratory! He's got father\ntoo, hidden God knows where! And now Babs. We've got to get them,\nGeorge! The police can't help us! It's just you and me, to fight this\nthing. And it's diabolical!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWe soared over the divided channel of the St. Lawrence, between Orleans\nand the mainland. Montmorency Falls in a moment showed dimly white\nthrough the murk to our left, a great hanging veil of ice higher than\nNiagara. Further ahead, the lights of the little village of St. Anne de\nBeaupr\u00e9 were visible with the gray-black towering hills behind them.\n\n\"Swing left, George. Over the mainland. That's St. Anne. We pass this\nside of it. Put the mufflers on. This damn thing roars like a tower\nsiren.\"\n\nI cut in the muffler and switched off our wing-lights. It was illegal\nbut we were past all thought of that. We were both desperate; the slow\nprudent process of acting within the law had nothing to do with this\naffair. We both knew it.\n\nOur little plane was dark, and amid the sounds of this night blizzard\nour muffled engine couldn't be heard.\n\nAlan touched me. \"There are his lights; see them?\"\n\nWe had passed St. Anne. The hills lay ahead--a wild mountainous country\nstretching northward to the foot of Hudson Bay. The blizzard was roaring\nout of the North and we were heading into it. I saw, on what seemed like\na dome-shaped hill perhaps a thousand feet above the river level, a\nsmall cluster of lights which marked Polter's property.\n\n\"Fly over it once, George,\" Alan said. \"Low--we can chance it. And find\na place to land near the walls.\"\n\nWe presently had it under us. I held the plane at five hundred feet, and\ncut our speed to the minimum of twenty miles an hour facing the gale,\nthough it was sixty or seventy when we turned. There were a score or two\nof hooded ground lights. But there was little reflection aloft, and in\nthe murk of the snowfall I felt we could escape notice.\n\nWe crossed, turned and went back in an arc following Polter's curved\nouter wall. We had a good view of it. A weird enough looking place, here\non its lonely hilltop. No wonder the wealthy \"Frank Rascor\" had attained\nlocal prominence!\n\nThe whole property was irregularly circular, perhaps a mile in diameter\ncovering the almost flat dome of the hilltop. Around it, completely\nenclosing it, Polter had built a stone and brick wall. A miniature of\nthe Great Wall in China! We could see that it was fully thirty feet high\nwith what evidently were naked high-voltage wires protecting its top.\nThere were half a dozen little gates, securely barred, with doubtless a\nguard at each of them.\n\nWithin the walls there were several buildings: a few small stone houses\nsuggesting workmen's dwellings; an oblong stone structure with smoke\nfunnels which looked like a smelter; a huge domelike spread of\ntranslucent glass over what might have been the top of a mineshaft. It\nlooked more like the dome of an observatory--an inverted bowl fully a\nhundred feet wide and equally as high, set upon the ground. What did it\ncover?\n\nAnd there was Polter's residence--a castlelike brick and stone building\nwith a tower not unlike a miniature of the Chateau Frontenac. We saw a\nstone corridor on the ground connecting the lower floor of the castle\nwith the dome, which lay about a hundred feet to one side.\n\nCould we chance landing inside the wall? There was a dark, level expanse\nof snow where we could have done it, but our descending plane doubtless\nwould have been discovered. But the mile-wide inner area was dark in\nmany places. Spots of light were at the little wall-gates. There was a\nglow all along the top of the wall. Lights were on in Polter's house;\nthey slanted out in yellow shafts to the nearby white ground. But for\nthe rest, the whole place was dark, save a dim glow from under the dome.\n\nI shook my head at Alan's suggestion that we land inside the walls. We\nhad circled back and were a mile or so off toward the river. \"The\ntrees--and you saw guards down there. But that low stretch outside the\ngate on this side....\"\n\nA plan was coming to me. Heaven knows it was desperate enough, but we\nhad no alternative. We would land and accost one of the gate guards.\nForce our way in. Once inside the wall, on foot in the darkness of this\nblizzard, we could hide; slip up to that dome. Beyond that my\nimagination could not go.\n\nWe landed in the snow a quarter of a mile from one of the gates. We left\nthe plane and plunged into the darkness.\n\nIt was a steady upward slope. A packed snowfield was underfoot, firm\nenough to hold our weight, with a foot or so of loose, soft snow on its\ntop. The falling flakes whirled around us. The darkness was solid. Our\nhelmeted leather-furred flying suits were soon shapeless with a\ngathering white shroud. We carried our Essens in our gloved hands. The\nnight was cold, around zero I imagine, though with that biting wind it\nfelt far colder.\n\nFrom the gloom a tiny spot of light loomed up.\n\n\"There it is, Alan. Easy now! Let me go first.\" The wind tore away my\nwords. We could see the narrow rectangle of bars at the gate, with a\nglow of light behind them.\n\n\"Hide your gun, Alan.\" I gripped him. \"Do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let me go first. I'll do the talking. When he opens the gate, let me\nhandle him. You--if there are two of them--you take the other.\"\n\nWe emerged from the darkness, into the glow of light by the gate. I had\nthe horrible feeling that a shot would greet us. A challenge came, at\nfirst in French and then in English.\n\n\"Stop! What do you want?\"\n\n\"To see Mr. Rascor.\"\n\nWe were up to the bars now, shapeless hooded bundles of snow and frost.\nA man stood in the doorway of a lighted little cubby behind the bars. A\nblack muzzle in his hand was leveled at us.\n\n\"He sees no one. Who are you?\"\n\nAlan was pressing at me from behind. I shoved him back, and took a step\nforward. I touched the bars.\n\n\"My name is Fred Davis. Newspaperman from Montreal I must see Mr.\nRascor.\"\n\n\"You cannot. You may send in your call. The mouthpiece is there--out\nthere to the left. Bare your face; he talks to no one without the face\nimage.\"\n\nThe guard had drawn back into his cubby; there was only his extended\nhand and the muzzle of his weapon left visible.\n\nI took a step forward. \"I don't want to talk by phone. Won't you open\nthe gate? It's cold out here. We have important business. We'll wait\nwith you.\"\n\nAbruptly the gate lattice slid aside. Beyond the cubby doorway was the\nopen darkness within the wall. A scuffed path leading inward from the\ngate showed for a few feet.\n\nI walked over the threshold, with Alan crowding me. The Essen in my coat\npocket was leveled. But from the cubby doorway, I saw that the guard was\ngone! Then I saw him crouching behind a metal shield. His voice rang\nout.\n\n\"Stand!\"\n\nA light struck my face--a thin beam from a television sender beside me.\nIt all happened in an instant, so quickly Alan and I had barely time to\nmake a move. I realized my image was now doubtless being presented to\nPolter. He would recognize me!\n\nI ducked my head, yelling, \"Don't do that!\"\n\nIt was too late! The guard had received a signal. I heard its buzz.\n\nFrom the shield a tiny jet of fluid leapt at me. It struck my hood.\nThere was a heavy sickening-sweet smell. It seemed like chloroform. I\nfelt my senses going. The cubby room was turning dark, was roaring.\n\nI think I fired at the shield. And Alan leapt aside. I heard the faint\nhiss of his Essen, and his choked, horrified voice:\n\n\"George, run! Don't fall!\"\n\nI crumpled; slid into blackness. And it seemed, as I went down, that\nAlan's inert body was falling on top of me....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI recovered after a nameless interval, a phantasmagoria of wild, drugged\ndreams. My senses came slowly. At first, there were dim muffled voices\nand the tread of footsteps. Then I knew that I was lying on the ground,\nand that I was indoors. It was warm. My overcoat was off. Then I\nrealized that I was bound and gagged.\n\nI opened my eyes. Alan was lying inert beside me, roped and with a black\ngag around his face and in his mouth. We were in a huge dim open space.\nPresently, as my vision cleared, I saw that the dome was overhead. This\nwas a circular, hundred-foot-wide room. It was dimly lighted. The\nfigures of men were moving about, their great misshapen shadows shifting\nwith them. Twenty feet from me there was a pile of golden rock--chunks\nof gold the size of a man's fist, or his head, and larger, heaped\nloosely into a mound ten feet high.\n\nBeyond this pile of ore, near the center of the room, twenty feet above\nthe concrete floor, there was a large hanging electrolier. It cast a\ncircular glow downward. Under it I saw a low platform raised a foot or\ntwo above the ground. A giant electro-microscope was hung with its\ntwenty foot cylinder above the platform. Its intensification tubes were\nglowing in a dim phosphorescent row on a nearby bracket. A man sat in a\nchair on the platform at the microscope's eyepiece.\n\nI saw all this with a brief glance, then my attention went to a white\nstone slab under the giant lense. It rested on the platform floor, a\ntwo-foot square surface of smooth white marble. A little roped railing a\nfew inches high fenced it. And in its center lay a fragment of golden\nquartz the size of a walnut!\n\nThere was a movement across my line of vision. Two figures advanced. I\nrecognized both of them. And I strained at my bonds; mouthed the gag\nwith futile, frenzied effort. I could no more than writhe; and I\ncouldn't make a sound. I lay, after a moment exhausted, and stared with\nhorror.\n\nThe familiar hunched figure of Polter advanced toward the microscope.\nAnd with him, his huge hand holding her wrists, was Babs. They were\nnearly fifty feet from me, but with the light over them I could see them\nclearly. Babs' slim figure was clad in a long skirted dress--pale blue,\nnow, with the light on it. Her long black hair had fallen disheveled to\nher shoulders. I couldn't see her face. She did not cry out. Polter was\nhalf dragging her as she resisted him; and then abruptly she ceased\nstruggling.\n\nI heard his guttural voice. \"That iss better.\"\n\nThey mounted the platform. They were very small and seemed to be far\naway. I blinked. Horror surged over me. Their figures were dwindling as\nthey stood there. Polter was saying something to the man at the\nmicroscope. Other men were nearby, watching. All were normal, save\nPolter and Babs. A moment passed. Polter was standing by the chair in\nwhich the man at the microscope was sitting. And Polter's head barely\nreached its seat! Babs was clinging to him now. Another moment and they\nwere both tiny figures down by the chair-leg. Then they began walking\nwith swaying steps toward the miniature railing of the white slab. The\nwhite reflection from the slab plainly illumined them. Polter's arm was\naround Babs. I had not realized how small they were until I saw Polter\nlift the rope of the little four-inch fence, and he and Babs stooped and\nwalked under it. The fragment of quartz lay a foot from them in the\ncenter of the white surface. They walked unsteadily toward it. But soon\nthey were running.\n\nMy horrified senses whirled. Then abruptly I felt something touch my\nface! Alan and I were lying in shadow. No one had noticed my writhing\nmovements, and Alan was still in drugged unconsciousness. Something tiny\nand light and soundless as a butterfly wing brushed my face! I jerked my\nhead aside. On the floor, within six inches of my eyes, I saw the tiny\nfigure of a girl an inch high! She stood, with a warning gesture to her\nlips--a human girl in a filmy flowing robe. Long, pale golden tresses\nlay on her white shoulders; her face, small as my little fingernail,\ncolorful as a miniature painted on ivory, was so close to my eyes that I\ncould see her expression--warning me not to move.\n\nThere was a faint glow of light on the floor where she stood, but in a\nmoment she moved out of it. Then I felt her brush against the back of my\nhead. My ear was near the ground. A tiny warm hand touched my ear lobe;\nclung to it. A tiny voice sounded in my ear.\n\n\"Please do not move your head. You might kill me!\"\n\nThere was a pause. I held myself rigid. Then the tiny voice came again.\n\n\"I am Glora, a friend. I have the drug! I will help you!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nIt seemed that Alan was stirring. I felt the tiny hand leave my ear. I\nthought that I could hear faint little footfalls as the girl scampered\naway, fearful that a sudden movement by Alan would crush her. I turned\ncautiously after a moment and saw Alan's eyes upon me. He too had seen,\nwith a blurred returning consciousness, the dwindling figures of Babs\nand Polter. I followed his gaze. The while slab with the golden quartz\nunder the microscope seemed empty. The several men in this huge circular\ndome-room were dispersing to their affairs; three of them sat whispering\nby what I now saw was a pile of gold ingots stacked crosswise. But the\nfellow at the microscope held his place, his eyes glued to its aperture\nas he watched the vanishing figures of Polter and Babs on the\nrock-fragment.\n\nAlan was trying to convey something to me. He could only gaze and jerk\nhis head. I saw behind his head the figures of the tiny girl on the\nfloor behind him. She wanted evidently to approach his head, but didn't\ndare. When for an instant he was quiet, she ran forward, but at once\nscampered back.\n\nFrom the group by the ingots, one of the men rose and came toward us.\nAlan held still, watching. And the girl, Glora, seized the opportunity\nto come nearer. We both heard her tiny voice:\n\n\"Do not move! Close your eyes! Make him think you are still\nunconscious.\"\n\nThen she was gone, like a mouse hiding in the shadows near us.\n\nAmazement swept Alan's face; he twisted, mouthed at his gag. But he saw\nmy eager nod and took his cue from me.\n\nI closed my eyes and lay stiff, breathing slowly. Footsteps approached.\nA man bent over Alan and me.\n\n\"Are you no conscious yet?\" It was the voice of a foreigner, with a\nqueer, indescribable intonation. A foot prodded us. \"Wake up!\"\n\nThen the footsteps retreated, and when I dared to look, the man was\nrejoining his fellows. It was a strange looking trio. They were\nheavy-set men in leather jackets and short, wide knee-length trousers.\nOne wore tight, high boots, and the others a sort of white buckskin,\nwith ankle straps. All were bare-headed--round, bullet heads of\nclose-clipped black hair.\n\nI suddenly had another startling realization. These men were not of\nnormal size as I had assumed! They were eight or ten feet tall at the\nvery least! And they and the pile of ingots, instead of being close to\nme, were more distant than I had thought.\n\nAlan was trying to signal me. The tiny girl was again at his ear,\nwhispering to him. And then she came to me.\n\n\"I have a knife. See?\" She backed away. I caught the pinpoint gleam of\nwhat might have been a knife in her hand. \"I will get a little larger. I\nam too small to cut your ropes. You lie still, even after I have cut\nthem.\"\n\nI nodded. The movement frightened her so that she leaped backward; but\nshe came again, smiling. The three men were talking earnestly by the\ningots. No one else was near us.\n\nGlora's tiny voice was louder, so that we both could hear it at once.\n\n\"When I free you, do not move or they may see that you are loose. I get\nlarger now--a little larger--and return.\"\n\nShe darted away and vanished. Alan and I lay listening to the voices of\nthe three men. Two were talking in a strange tongue. One called to the\nman at the microscope, and he responded. The third man said suddenly:\n\n\"Say, talk English. You know damn well I can't understand that lingo.\"\n\n\"We say, McGuire, the two prisoners soon wake up.\"\n\n\"What we oughta do is kill 'em. Polter's a fool.\"\n\n\"The doctor say, wait for him return. Not long, what you call three,\nfour hours.\"\n\n\"And have the Quebec police up here lookin' for 'em? An' that damn girl\nhe stole off the Terrace. What did he call her, Barbara Kent?\"\n\n\"These two who are drugged, their bodies can be thrown in a gully down\nbehind St. Anne. That what the doctor plan to do, I think. Then the\npolice find them--days maybe from now--and their smashed airship with\nthem.\"\n\nGruesome suggestion!\n\nThe man at the microscope called, \"They are almost gone I can hardly see\nthem any more.\" He left the platform and joined the others. And I saw\nthat he was much smaller than they--about my own size possibly.\n\nThere seemed six men here altogether. Four now, by the ingots, and two\nothers far across the room where I saw the dark entrance of the\ncorridor-tunnel which led to Polter's castle.\n\nAgain I felt a warning hand touch my face, and saw the figure of Glora\nstanding by my head. She was larger now--about a foot tall. She moved\npast my eyes; stood by my mouth; bent down over my gag. I felt the\ncautious slide of a tiny knife-blade inserted under the fabric of the\ngag. She hacked, tugged at it, and in a moment ripped it through.\n\nShe stood panting from the effort. My heart was pounding with fear that\nshe would be seen; but the man had turned the central light off when he\nleft the microscope, and it was far darker here now than before.\n\nI moistened my dry mouth. My tongue was thick, but I could talk.\n\n\"Thank you, Glora.\"\n\n\"Quiet!\"\n\nI felt her hacking at the ropes around my wrists. And then at my ankles.\nIt took her a long time, but at last I was free! I rubbed my arms and\nlegs; felt the returning circulation in them.\n\nAnd presently Alan was free. \"George, what--\" he began.\n\n\"Wait,\" I whispered. \"Easy! Let her tell us what to do.\"\n\nWe were unarmed. Two, against these six, three of whom were giants.\n\nGlora whispered, \"Do not move! I have the drugs. But I can not give them\nto you when I am still so small. I have not enough. I will hide--there.\"\nHer little arm gestured to where, near us, half a dozen boxes were\npiled. \"When I am large as you, I come back. Be ready, quickly to act. I\nmay be seen. I give you then the drug.\"\n\n\"But wait,\" Alan whispered. \"Tell us--\"\n\n\"The drug to make you large. Large enough to fight these men. I had\nplanned to do that myself, until I saw you held captive. That girl of\nyour world the doctor just now steal, she is friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Yes! But--\" A thousand questions were springing in my mind, but this\nwas no time to ask them. I amended, \"Go on! Hurry! Give us the drug when\nyou can.\"\n\nThe little figure moved away from us and disappeared. Alan and I lay as\nwe had before. But now we could whisper. We tried to anticipate what\nwould happen; tried to plan, but that was futile. The thing was too\nstrange, too astoundingly fantastic.\n\nHow long Glora was gone I don't know. I think, not over three or four\nminutes. She came from her hiding place, crouching this time, and joined\nus. She was, probably, of normal Earth size--a small, frail-looking girl\nsomething over five feet tall. We saw now that she was quite young,\nstill in her teens. We lay staring at her, amazed at her beauty. Her\nsmall oval face was pale, with the flush of pink upon her cheeks--a face\nqueerly, transcendingly beautiful. It was wholly human, yet somehow\nunearthly, as though unmarked by even the heritage of our Earthly\nstrifes.\n\n\"Now! I am ready.\" She was fumbling at her robe. \"I will give you each\nthe same.\"\n\nHer gestures were rapid. She flung a quick glance at the distant men.\nAlan and I were tense. We could easily be discovered now, but we had to\nchance it. We were sitting erect. Alan murmured:\n\n\"But what do we do? What happens? What--\"\n\nOn the palm of her hand were two pink-white pellets. \"Take these--one\nfor each of you. Quickly!\"\n\nInvoluntarily we drew back. The thing abruptly was gruesome,\nfrightening. Horribly frightening.\n\n\"Quickly,\" she urged. \"The drug is what you call highly radioactive. And\nvolatile. Exposed to the air, it is gone very soon. You are afraid? No,\nI assure you it is not harmful.\"\n\nWith a muttered curse at his own reluctance, Alan seized the small\npellet. I stopped him.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\nThe men momentarily were engaged in a low-voiced, earnest discussion. I\ndared to hesitate a moment longer.\n\n\"Glora, where will you be?\"\n\n\"Here. Right here. I will hide.\"\n\n\"We want to go after Mr. Polter,\" I gestured. \"Into the little piece of\ngolden rock. That's where he went with the Earth girl, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. My world is there--within an atom there in that rock.\"\n\n\"Will you take us?\"\n\n\"Yes! But later.\"\n\nAlan whispered vehemently, \"Why not now? We could get smaller, now.\"\n\nBut she shook her head. \"That is not possible. We would be seen as we\nclimbed the platform and crossed the white slab.\"\n\n\"No,\" I protested, \"not if we get very small, hiding here first.\"\n\nShe was smiling, but urgently fearful of this delay. \"Should we get that\nsmall, then it would be, from here\"--she gestured toward the\nmicroscope--\"to there, a journey of very many miles. Don't you\nunderstand?\"\n\nThis thing so strange!\n\nAlan was plucking at me. \"Ready, George?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI put the pellet on my tongue. It tasted slightly sweet, but seemed to\nmelt quickly and I swallowed it hastily. My heart, was pounding, but\nthat was apprehension, not the drug. A thrill of heat ran through my\nveins as though my blood were on fire.\n\nAlan was clinging to me as we sat together. Glora again had vanished. In\nthe background of my whirling consciousness the sudden thought hovered\nthat she had tricked us; done to us something diabolical. But the\nthought was swept away in the confused flood of impressions upon me.\n\nI turned dizzily. \"You all right, Alan?\"\n\n\"Yes, I--I guess so.\"\n\nMy ears were roaring, the room seemed whirling, but in a moment that\npassed. I felt a sudden growing sense of lightness. A humming was within\nme--a soundless tingle. The drug had gone to every tiny microscopic cell\nin my body. The myriad pores of my skin seemed thrilling with activity.\nI know now that it was the exuding volatile gas of this disintegrating\ndrug. Like an aura it enveloped me, acted upon my garments.\n\nI learned later much of the principles of this and its companion drug\nbut I had no thought for such things now. The huge dimly illumined room\nunder the dome was swaying. Then abruptly it steadied. The strange\nsensations within me were lessening, or I forgot them, and I became\naware of externals.\n\nThe room was shrinking! As I stared, not with horror now, but with\namazement and a coming triumph, I saw everywhere a slow, steady,\ncrawling movement. The whole place was dwindling. The platform, the\nmicroscope, were nearer than before, and smaller. The pile of ingots,\nand men near there, were shifting toward me.\n\n\"George! My God--this is weird!\"\n\nI saw Alan's white face as I turned toward him. He was growing at the\nsame rate as myself evidently, for in all the scene he only was\nunchanged.\n\nWe could feel the movement. The floor under us was shifting, crawling\nslowly. From all directions it contracted as though it was being\nsqueezed beneath us. In reality our expanding bodies were pushing\noutward.\n\nThe pile of boxes which had been a few feet away, were thrusting\nthemselves at me. I moved incautiously and knocked them over. They\nseemed small now, perhaps half their former size. Glora was standing\nbehind them. I was sitting and she was standing, but across the litter\nour faces were level.\n\n\"Stand up!\" she murmured. \"You all right now. I hide!\"\n\nI struggled to my feet, drawing Alan up with me. Now! The time for\naction was upon us! We had already been discovered. The men were\nshouting, clambering to their feet. Alan and I stood swaying. The\ndome-room had contracted to half its former size. Near us was a little\nplatform, chair and microscope. Small figures of men were rushing at us.\n\nI shouted, \"Alan! Watch yourself!\"\n\nWe were unarmed. These men might have automatic weapons. But evidently\nthey did not. Only knives were in their hands. The whole place was\nringing with shouts. And then a shrill siren alarm from outside started\nclanging.\n\nThe first of the men--a few moments before he had seemed a giant--flung\nhimself upon me. His head was lower than my shoulders. I met him with a\nblow of my fist in his face. He toppled backward; but from one side\nanother figure came at me. A knife-blade bit into the flesh of my thigh.\n\nThe pain seemed to fire my brain. A madness descended upon me. It was\nthe madness of abnormality. I saw Alan with two dwarfed figures clinging\nto him. But he threw them off, and they turned and ran.\n\nThe man at my thigh stabbed again, but I caught his wrist and, as though\nhe were a child, whirled him around me and flung him away. He landed\nwith a crash against the shrunken pile of gold nuggets and lay still.\n\nThe place was in a turmoil. Other men were appearing from outside. But\nthey now stood well away from us. Alan backed against me. His laugh rang\nout, half hysterical with the madness upon him as it was upon me.\n\n\"God! George, look at them! So small!\"\n\nThey were now hardly the height of our knees. This was now a small\ncircular room, under a lowering concave dome. A shot came from the group\nof Pygmy figures. I saw the small stab of flame, heard the zing of the\nbullet.\n\nWe rushed, with the full frenzy of madness upon us--enraged giants. What\nactually happened I cannot recount. I recall scattering the little\nfigures; seizing them; flinging them headlong. A bullet, tiny now, stung\nthe calf of my leg. Little chairs and tables under my feet were\ncrashing. Alan was lunging back and forth; stamping; flinging his tiny\nadversaries away.\n\nThere were twenty or thirty of the figures here now. I feared that they\nmight produce more up-to-date weapons. But my fears were unfounded: soon\nI saw these figures making their escape.\n\nThe room was littered with wreckage. I saw that by some miracle of\nchance the microscope was still standing, and I had a moment of sanity.\n\n\"Alan! Watch out! The microscope--the platform! Don't smash them! And\nGlora be careful not to hurt her!\"\n\nI suddenly became aware that my head and my shoulders had struck the\ndome roof. Why, this was a tiny room! Alan and I found ourselves backed\ntogether, panting in the small confines of a circular cubby with an\narching dome close over us. At our feet the platform with the microscope\nover it hardly reached our boot tops. There was a sudden silence, broken\nonly by our heavy breathing. The tiny forms of humans strewn around us\nwere all motionless. The others had fled.\n\nThen we heard a small voice. \"Here! Take this! Quickly! You are too\nlarge. Quickly!\"\n\nAlan took a step. And sudden panic was on us both. Glora was here at our\nfeet. We did not dare turn; hardly dared to move. To change position\nmight have crushed her now that she had left her hiding place. My leg\nhit the top of the microscope cylinder. It rocked but did not fall.\n\nWhere was Glora? In the gloom we could not see her. We were in a panic.\n\nAlan began, \"George, I--\"\n\nThe contracting inner curve of the dome bumped gently against my head.\nOur panic and confusion turned into cold fear. The room was closing in\nto crush us.\n\nI muttered, \"Alan! I'm going out!\" I braced myself and heaved against\nthe side and top curve of the dome. Its metal ribs and heavy\ntranslucent, reinforced glass plates resisted me. There was an instant\nwhen Alan and I were desperately frightened. We were trapped, to be\ncrushed in here by our own horrible growth. Then the dome yielded under\nour smashing blows. The ribs bent; the plates cracked.\n\nWe straightened, pushed upward and emerged through the broken dome, with\nhead and shoulders towering into the outside darkness and the wind and\nsnow of the blizzard howling around us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\n\"Glora--that was horrible!\"\n\nWe stood, again in normal size, with the wrecked dome-laboratory around\nus. The dome had a great jagged hole halfway up one of its sides,\nthrough which the snow was falling. The broken bodies strewn around were\ngruesome.\n\nAlan repeated, \"Horrible, Glora. The power of this drug is diabolical.\"\n\nGlora had grown large after us and had given us the companion drug. I\nneed not detail the strange sensations of our dwindling. We were so soon\nto experience them again!\n\nWe had searched, when still large, all of Polter's grounds. Some of his\nmen undoubtedly escaped, made off into the blizzard. How many, we never\nknew. None of them ever made themselves known again.\n\nWe were ready to start into the atom. The fragment of golden quartz\nstill lay under the microscope on the white square of stone slab. We had\nhurried with our last preparations. The room was chilling. We were all\ninadequately dressed for such cold.\n\nI left a note scribbled on a square of paper by the microscope. With\ndaylight Polter's wrecked place would be discovered and the police would\nsurely come.\n\n_Guard this piece of golden quartz. Take it at once, very carefully, to\nthe Royal Canadian Scientific Society. Have it watched day and night. We\nwill return._\n\nI signed it George Randolph. And as I did so, the extra ordinary aspect\nof these events swept me anew. Here in Polter's weird place I had been\nliving in some strange fantastic realm. But this was the Province of\nQuebec, in civilized Canada. These were the Quebec authorities I was\naddressing.\n\nI flung the thoughts away. \"Ready, Glora?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen doubts assailed me. None of Polter's men had gotten large enough to\nfight us. Evidently he did not trust them with the drug. We could well\nbelieve that, for the thing misused, was diabolical beyond human\nconception. A single giant, a criminal, a madman, by the power of giant\nsize alone, could menace and destroy beyond belief. The drug lost, or\ncarelessly handled, could get loose. Animals, insects eating it, could\nroam the Earth, gigantic monsters. Vegetation nourished with the drug,\nmight in a day overrun a big city, burying it with jungle growth!\n\nHow terrible a thing, if the realm of smallness were suddenly to emerge,\nconsume this awe inspiring drug! Monsters of the sea, marine organisms,\ncould expand until even the ocean was too small for them. Microbes of\ndisease, feeding upon it--\n\nAlan was prodding me. \"We're ready, George.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's go.\"\n\nThis was not the largeness we were facing now, but smallness. I thought\nof Babs, down there with Polter, beyond the vanishing point in the realm\nof infinitely small. They had been gone an hour at least. Every moment\nlost now was adding to Babs' danger.\n\nGlora sat with us on the platform. Strange little creature! She was\nwholly calm now; methodical with her last directions. There had been no\ntime for her to tell us anything about herself. Alan had asked her why\nshe had come here and how she had gotten the drugs. She waved him away.\n\n\"On the way down. Plenty of time then.\"\n\n\"How long will it take us?\" Alan demanded.\n\n\"Not too long if we are careful with managing the trip. About ten\nhours.\"\n\nAnd now we were ready to start. She told us calmly:\n\n\"I will give you each your share of the drugs, but then you take only as\nI tell you.\"\n\nShe produced from her robe several small vials a few inches long. They\nwere tightly stoppered. The feel of them was cool and sleek; they seemed\nto be made of some strange, polished metal. Some of them were tinted\nblack while the others glowed opalescent. She gave each of us one vial\nof each kind.\n\n\"The light ones are for diminishing,\" she said. \"We take them very\ncarefully, one small pellet only at first.\"\n\nAlan was opening one of his, but she checked him.\n\n\"Wait! The drug evaporates very quickly. I have more to say. First we\nsit here together. Then you follow me to the white slab. We climb upon\nthe little rock.\"\n\nShe laid her hands on my arms. Her blue eyes regarded us earnestly. Her\nmanner was naive; childlike. But I could not mistake her intelligence or\nthe force of character stamped on her face for all its dainty, ethereal\nbeauty.\n\n\"Alan--\" She smiled at him, and tossed back a straying lock of her hair\nwhich was annoying her. \"You pay attention, Alan. You are very young,\nreckless. You listen. We must not be separated. You understand that,\nboth of you? We will be always in that little piece of rock. But there\nwill be miles of distance. And to be lost in size--\"\n\nWhat a strange journey upon which we were now starting! Lost in size?\n\n\"You understand me? Lost in size. If that happens, we might never find\neach other. And if we come upon the Doctor Polter and the girl he holds\ncaptive--if we can overtake them--\"\n\n\"We must!\" I exclaimed. \"And we must get started.\"\n\nShe showed us which pellet to select. They were of several sizes, I\nfound. And as she afterward told us, the larger ones were not only\nlarger but of an intensified strength. We took the smallest. It was\nbarely a thousandth part of the strength of the largest. In unison we\nplaced the pellets on our tongues, and hastily swallowed.\n\nThe first sensations were as before. And, familiar now, they caused no\nmore than a fleeting discomfort. But I think I could never get used to\nthe outward strangeness!\n\nThe room in a moment was expanding. I could feel the platform floor\ncrawling outward beneath me, so that I had to hitch and change my\nposition as it pulled. We were seated together, Alan and I on each side\nof Glora. My fingers were on her arm. It did not change size, but it\nslowly drew away with a space opening between us. Overhead, the dome\nroof, the great jagged hole there, was receding, lifting, moving upward\nand away.\n\nGlora pulled us to our feet. \"We had better start now. The distance\ngrows very far, so quickly.\"\n\nWe had been sitting within five feet of the stone slab with its four\ninch high railing around it. A chair was by the microscope eyepiece. As\nwe stood swaying I saw that the chair was huge, and its seat level with\nmy head. The great barrel-cylinder of the microscope slanted sixty feet\nupward. The dome roof was a distant spread three hundred feet up in the\ndimness. The dome-room was a vast arena now.\n\nAlan and I must have hesitated, confused by the expanding scene--a slow,\nsteady movement everywhere. Everything was drawing away from us. Even as\nwe stood together, the creeping platform floor was separating us.\n\nA moment passed. Glora was urging us on vehemently:\n\n\"Come! You must not stand there!\"\n\nWe started walking. The railing around the slab was knee-high. The slab\nitself was a broad, square surface. The fragment of golden quartz lay in\nits center. It was now a jagged lump nearly a foot in diameter.\n\nThe platform seemed to shift as we walked; the railing hardly came\ncloser as we advanced toward it. Then suddenly I realized that it was\nreceding. Thirty feet away? No, now it was more than that--a great,\nthick rope, waist-high, with a huge spread of white surface behind it.\n\n\"Faster!\" urged Glora. We ran, and reached the railing. It was higher\nthan our heads. We ran under it, and cut out upon the white slab--a\nlevel surface, larger now than the whole dome-room had been.\n\nGlora, like a fawn, ran in advance of us, her robe flying in the wind.\nShe turned to look back.\n\n\"Faster! Faster, or it will be too hard a climb!\"\n\nAhead lay a golden mound of rock. It was widening; raising its top\nsteadily higher. Beyond it and over it was a vast dim distance. We\nreached the rock, breathless, winded. It was a jagged mound like a great\nfifty-foot butte. We plunged upon it and began climbing.\n\nThe ascent was steep; precipitous in places. There were little gullies,\nwhich expanded as we climbed up them. It seemed as if we would never\nreach the top, but at last we were there. I was aware that the drug had\nceased its action. The yellow, rocky ground was no longer expanding.\n\nWe came to the summit and stood to get back our breath. Alan and I gazed\nwith awe upon the top of a rocky hill. Little buttes and strewn boulders\nlay everywhere. It was all naked rock, ridged and pitted, and everywhere\nyellow-tinged.\n\nOverhead was distance. I could not call it a sky. A blur was\nthere--something almost but not quite distinguishable. Then I thought\nthat I could make out a more solid blur which might be the lower lens of\nthe microscope above us. And there were blurred, very distant spots of\nlight, like huge suns masked by a haze, and I knew that they were the\nhooded lights of the laboratory room.\n\nBefore us, over the brink of a five hundred-foot drop, a great\nglistening plain stretched into the distance. I seemed to see where it\nended in a murky blur. And far higher than our hilltop level a\nhorizontal streak marked the rope railing of the slab.\n\n\"Well,\" said Alan. \"We're here.\" He gazed behind us, back across the\nrocky summit which seemed several hundred feet across to its opposite\nbrink. He was smiling, but the smile faded. \"Now what, Glora? Another\npellet?\"\n\n\"No. Not yet. There is a place where we go down. It is marked in my\nmind.\"\n\nI had a sudden ominous sense that we three were not alone up here.\nGlora led us back from the cliff. As we picked our way among the naked\ncrags, it seemed behind each of them an enemy might be lurking.\n\n\"Glora, do you know if any of Dr. Polter's men might have the drug? I\nmean, do they come in and out of here?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I think not. He lets no one have the drug. He\ntrusts not anyone. I stole it. I will tell you later. Much I have to\ntell you before we arrive.\"\n\nAlan made a sudden, sidewise leap, and dashed around a rock. He came\nback to us, smiling ruefully.\n\n\"Gets on your nerves, all of this. I had the same idea you had, George.\nMight be someone around here. But I guess not.\" He took Glora's hand and\nthey walked in advance of me. \"We haven't thanked you yet, Glora,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"Not needed. I came for help from your world. I followed the Dr. Polter\nwhen he came outward. He has made my world and my people, his slaves. I\ncame for help. And because I have helped you, needs no thanks.\"\n\n\"But we do thank you, Glora.\" Alan turned his flushed, earnest face back\nto me. I thought I had never seen him so handsome, with his boyish,\nrugged features and shock of tousled brown hair. The grimness of\nadventure was upon him, but in his eyes there was something else. It was\nnot for me to see it. That was for Glora; and I think that even then its\npresence and its meaning did not escape her.\n\nWe reached a little gully near the center of the hilltop. It was some\ntwenty feet deep.\n\nGlora paused. \"We descend here.\"\n\nThe gully was an unmistakable landmark--open at one end, forty feet\nlong, with the other end terminating in a blind wall which now loomed\nabove us.\n\n\"A pit is here--a hole. I cannot tell just how large it will look when\nwe are in this size.\"\n\nWe found it and stood over it--a foot-wide circular hole extending\ndownward. Alan knelt and shoved his hand and arm into it, but Glora\nsprang at him.\n\n\"Don't do that!\"\n\n\"Why not? How deep is it?\"\n\nShe retorted sharply, \"The Doctor Polter is ahead of us. How far away in\nsize, who knows? Do you want to crush him, and crush that young girl\nwith him?\"\n\nAlan's jaw dropped. \"Good Lord!\"\n\nWe stood with the little pit before us, and another of the pellets\nready.\n\n\"Now!\" said Glora.\n\nAgain we took the drug, a somewhat larger pellet this time. The familiar\nsensations began. Everywhere the rocks were creeping with a slow\ninexorable movement, the landscape expanding around us. The gully walls\ndrew back and upward. In a moment they were cliff walls and we were in a\nbroad valley.\n\nWe had been standing close together. We had not moved, except to shift\nour feet as the expanding ground drew them apart. I became aware that\nAlan and Glora were a distance from me. Glora called:\n\n\"Come, George! We're going down--quickly now.\"\n\nWe ran to the pit. It had expanded to a great round hole some six feet\nwide and equally as deep. Glora let herself down, peered anxiously\nbeneath her, and dropped. Alan and I followed. We jammed the pit; but as\nwe stood there, the walls were receding and lifting.\n\nI had remarked Glora's downward glance, and shuddered. Suppose, in some\nslightly smaller size, Babs had been among these rocks!\n\nThe pit widened steadily. The movement was far swifter now. We stood\npresently in a great circular valley. It seemed fully a mile in\ndiameter, with huge encircling walls like a crater rim towering\nthousands of feet into the air. We ran along the base of one expanding\nwall, following Glora.\n\nI noticed now that overhead the turgid murk had turned into the blue of\ndistance. A sky. It was faintly sky-blue, and seemed hazy, almost as\nthough clouds were forming. It had been cold when we started. The\nexertion had kept us fairly comfortable; But now I realized that it was\nfar warmer. This was different air, more humid, and I thought the smell\nof moist earth was in it. Rocks and boulders were strewn here on the\nfloor of this giant valley, and I saw occasional pools of water. There\nhad been rain recently!\n\nThe realization came with a shock of surprise. This was a new world! A\nfaint, luminous twilight was around us. And then I noticed that the\nlight was not altogether coming from overhead. It seemed inherent to the\nrocks themselves. They glowed, very faintly luminous, as though\nphosphorescent.\n\nWe were now well embarked upon this strange journey. We seldom spoke.\nGlora was intent upon guiding us. She was trying to make the best\npossible speed. I realized that it was a case of judgment, as well as\nphysical haste. We had dropped into that six-foot pit. Had we waited a\nfew moments longer, the depth would have been a hundred feet, two\nhundred, a thousand! It would have involved hours of arduous descent--if\nwe had lingered until we were a trifle smaller!\n\nWe took other pellets. We traveled perhaps an hour more. There were many\ninstances of Glora's skill. We squeezed into a gully and waited until it\nwidened; we leapt over expanding caverns; we slid down a smooth\nyellowish slide of rocks, and saw it behind and over us, rising to\nbecome a great spreading ramp extending upward into the blue of the sky.\nNow, up there, little sailing white clouds were visible. And down where\nwe stood it was deep twilight, queerly silvery with the dim light from\nthe luminous rocks, as though some hidden moon were shining.\n\nStrange, new world! I suddenly envisaged the full strangeness of it.\nAround me were spreading miles of barren, naked landscape. I gazed off\nto where, across the rugged plateau we were traversing, there was a\nrange of hills. Behind and above them were mountains; serrated tiers;\nhigher and more distant. An infinite spread of landscape! And, as we\ndwindled, still other vast reaches opened before us. I gazed overhead.\nWas it--compared to my stature now--a thousand miles, perhaps even a\nmillion miles up to where we had been two or three hours ago? I thought\nso.\n\nThen suddenly I caught the other viewpoint. This was all only an inch of\ngolden quartz--if one were large enough to see it that way!\n\nAlan had been trying to memorize the main topographical features of our\nroute. It was not as difficult as it seemed at first. We were always far\nlarger than normal in comparison to our environment, and the main\ndistinguishing characteristics of the landscape were obvious--the blind\ngully, with the round pit, for instance, or the ramp slide.\n\nWe had been traveling some three or four hours when Glora suggested a\nrest. We were at the edge of a broad canyon. The wall towered several\nhundred feet above us; but a few moments before, we had jumped down it\nwith a single leap!\n\nThe last pellet we had taken had ceased its action. We sat down to rest.\nIt was a wild, mountainous scene around us, deep with luminous gloom. We\ncould barely see across the canyon to its distant cliff wall. The wall\nbeside us had been smooth, but now it was broken and ridged. There were\nravines in it, and dark holes resembling cave-mouths. One was near us.\nAlan gazed at it apprehensively.\n\n\"I say, Glora, I don't like sitting here.\"\n\nI had been telling her all we knew of Polter. She listened quietly,\nseldom interrupting me. Then she said:\n\n\"I understand. I tell you now about Polter as I have seen him.\"\n\nShe talked for five or ten minutes. I listened, amazed, awed by what she\nsaid.\n\nBut Alan's insistence interrupted her. \"Come on, let's get out of here.\nThat tunnel-mouth, or cave, or whatever it is--\"\n\n\"But we go in there,\" she protested. \"A little tunnel. That is our way\nto travel. We are not far from my city now.\"\n\nPerhaps Alan felt what once was called a hunch, a premonition, the\npresage of evil which I think comes strangely to us more often than we\nrealize. Whatever it was, we had no time to act upon it. The\ntunnel-mouth which had caused Alan's apprehension was about a hundred\nfeet away. It was a ten-foot, yawning hole in the cliff. Perhaps Alan\nsensed a movement in there. As I turned to look at it a great, hairy\nhuman arm came out of the opening! Then a shoulder! A head!\n\nThe giant figure of a man came squeezing through the hole on his hands\nand knees! He gathered himself, and as he stood erect, I saw that he was\ngrowing in size! Already he was twenty feet tall compared to us--a\nthick-set fellow, dressed in leather garments, his legs and arms heavily\nmatted with black hair. He stood swaying, gazing around him. I stared up\nat his round bullet head, his villainous face.\n\nHe saw us! Stupid amazement struck him, then comprehension.\n\nHe let out a roar and came at us!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nGlora shouted, \"Into the tunnel! This way!\" She held her wits and darted\nto one side, with Alan and me after her. We ran through a narrow passage\nbetween two fifty-foot boulders which lay close together. Momentarily\nthe giant was out of sight, but we could hear his heavy tread and\npanting breath. We emerged having passed him. He was taller now. He\nseemed confused at our sudden scampering activity. He checked his\nforward rush, and ran around the twin boulders. But we had squeezed into\na narrow ravine. He could not follow. He threw a rock. To us it was a\nboulder. It crashed behind us. To him, we were like scampering insects;\nhe could not tell which way we were about to dart.\n\nAlan panted, \"Glora, does this lead out?\"\n\nThe little ravine seemed to open fifty feet ahead of us. Alan stopped,\nseized a chunk of rock, flung it up. I saw the giant's face above us. He\nwas kneeling to reach in. The rock hit him on the forehead--a pebble,\nbut it stung him. His face rose away.\n\nAgain we emerged. The tunnel-mouth was near us. We reached it and flung\nourselves into its ten-foot width just as the giant came lunging up. He\nwas far larger than before. Looking back, I could see only the lower\npart of his legs blocked against the outer light.\n\n\"Glora! Alan, where are you?\"\n\nFor a moment I did not see them. It was darker in this tunnel of broken\nrocky walls, and jagged arching roof than outside.\n\nThen I heard Alan's voice: \"George! Over here!\"\n\nThey came running to me. For a moment we stood, undecided. My eyes were\nbecoming accustomed to the gloom. The tunnel was illumined by a dim\nphosphorescence from the rocks. I saw Alan fumbling for his vials, but\nGlora stopped him.\n\n\"No. We are the right size.\"\n\nWe were about a hundred feet back from the opening. The giant's legs\ndisappeared. But in a moment the round, light hole of the exit was\nobscured again. His head and shoulders! He was lying prone. His great\narms came in. He hitched forward. The width of his expanding shoulders\nwedged.\n\nI think that he expected to reach us with a single snatch of his\ntremendous arms. Or perhaps he was confused, or forgot his growth. He\ndid not reach us. His shoulders stuck. Then suddenly he was trying to\nback out, but could not!\n\nIt was only a moment. We stood in the radiant gloom of the tunnel,\nconfused and frightened. The giant's voice roared, reverberating around\nus. Anger. A note of fear. Finally stark terror. He heaved, but the\nrocks of the opening held solid. Then there was a crack, a gruesome\nrattling, splintering--his shoulder bones breaking. His whole gigantic\nbody gave a last convulsive lunge, and he emitted a deafening shrill\nscream of agony.\n\nI was aware of the tunnel-mouth breaking upward. Falling rocks--an\navalanche, a cataclysm around us. Then light overhead.\n\nThe giant's crushed body lay motionless. A pile of boulders, rocks and\nloose metallic earth was strewn upon his head and torso, illumined by\nthe outer light through a jagged rent where the cliff-face had fallen\ndown.\n\nWe were unhurt, crouching back from the avalanche. The giant's mangled\nbody was still expanding; shoving at the litter of loose rocks. In a\nmoment it would again be too small for the broken cliff opening.\n\nI found my wits. \"Alan, we've got to get out of here. God--don't you see\nwhat's happening?\"\n\nBut Glora restrained us. She realized that the effect of the drug the\ngiant had taken was about at its end. The growth presently stopped. That\nhuge noisome mass of pulp which once had been human shoulders no longer\nexpanded.\n\nI shoved Glora away. \"Don't look!\" I was shaking; my head was reeling.\nAlan's face, painted by the phosphorescence, was ghastly.\n\nGlora pulled at us. \"This way! The tunnel is not too long. We go.\"\n\nBut the giant had drugs, and perhaps weapons. \"Wait!\" I urged. \"You two\nwait here. I'll climb over him.\"\n\nI told them why, and ran. I can only leave to the imagination that brief\nexploratory climb. The broken body seemed at least a hundred feet long;\nthe mangled shoulders and chest filled the great torn hole in the cliff.\nI climbed over the litter. Indescribable, horrible scene! A river of\nwarm blood was flowing down the declivity outward....\n\nI came back to Glora and Alan. Under my arm was a huge cylinder vial. It\nwas black, the enlarging drug. I set it down. They stared at me in my\nbloodstained garments.\n\n\"George! You're--\"\n\n\"His blood, not mine.\" I tried to smile. \"Here's the drug he carried.\nEvidently Polter was only sending him out because I found just the one\ndrug.\"\n\n\"What'll we do with it?\" Alan demanded. \"Look at the size of it!\"\n\n\"Destroy it,\" said Glora. \"See, that is not difficult.\" She tugged at\nthe huge stopper, and exposed a few of the pellets--to us as large as\napples. \"The air will soon spoil it.\"\n\nWe left it in the tunnel. I also had with me a great roll of paper which\nhad been folded in the giant's belt, with the drug cylinder. We unrolled\nit, and hauled its folds to a spread some ten feet long. It was covered\nwith a scrawled handwriting in pencil, but its giant characters seemed\nthick blurred strokes of charcoal. We could not read it; we were too\nclose. Alan and Glora held it up against the tunnel wall. From a\ndistance I could make it out. It was a note written in English, signed\n\"Polter,\" evidently to one of his men.\n\nIt read:\n\n_The two prisoners, kill them at once. That is better. It will be too\ndangerous to wait for my return. Put their bodies with their airplane.\nCrash it a mile from my gate._\n\nFull directions for our death followed. And Polter said he would return\nby dawn or soon after.\n\nThat gave me a start. By dawn! We had been traveling four or five hours.\nIt was already dawn up there now!\n\n\"No,\" Glora explained, \"the time in here is different. A different\ntime-rate. I do not know how much difference. My world speeds faster;\nyours is very slow. It is not the dawn up there quite yet.\"\n\nAgain my mind strove to encompass these things--so strange. A faster\ntime-rate prevailed in here? Then our lives were passing more quickly.\nWe were living, experiencing things, compressed into a shorter interval.\nIt was not apparent: there was nothing to which comparison could be\nmade. I recalled Alan's description of Polter--not thirty years old as\nhe should have been, but nearer fifty. I could understand that, now. A\nday in here was equal to only a few hours on our gigantic world outside.\n\nWe walked the length of the tunnel. I suppose it was a quarter of a\nmile, to us in this size. It wound through the cliff with a steady\ndownward slope. And suddenly I realized that we had turned downward\nnearly half the diameter of a circle! We had turned over--or at least it\nseemed so. But the gravity was the same. I had noticed from the\nbeginning very little change.\n\nThe realization of this tunnel brought a mental confusion. I lost all\nsense of direction. The outer world of Earth was under my feet, instead\nof overhead. Then we went level. I forgot the confusion: this was\nnormality here. We turned upward a little. Cross tunnels intersected\nours at intervals. I saw caverns, open, widened tunnels, as though this\nmountain were honeycombed.\n\n\"Look!\" said Glora. \"There is the way out. All these passages lead the\nsame way.\"\n\nThere was a glow of light ahead. I recall that I was at that moment\nfumbling at my belt in two small compartments in which I was carrying\nthe two vials of the drugs which Glora had given me. Alan wore the same\nsort of belt. We had found them in the wrecked dome-room. I heard a\nclick on the ground at my feet. I was about to stoop to see what I had\nkicked--only a loose stone, perhaps--but Glora's words distracted me. I\ndid not stoop. If only I had, how different events might have been!\n\nThe glow of light ahead of us widened as we approached, and presently we\nstood at the end of the tunnel. A spread of open distance was outside.\nWe were on a ledge of a steep rocky wall some fifty feet above a wide\nlevel landscape. Vegetation! I saw trees--a forest off to the left. A\nrange of naked hills lay behind it. A mile away, in front and to the\nright, a little town nestled on the shore of shining water. There was\nstarlight on the water! And over it a vast blue-purple sky was studded\nwith stars.\n\nI gazed, with that first sudden shock of emotion, into the infinite\ndepths of interplanetary space! Light years of distance. Gigantic\nworlds, blazing suns off there shrunken by distance now to little points\nof light. A universe was here!\n\nBut this was an inch of golden quartz!\n\nAbove my head were stars which, compared to my bodily size now, were\nvast worlds ten thousand light-years away! Yet, from the other\nviewpoint, I had only descended perhaps an eighth, or a quarter of an\ninch, beneath the broken pitted surface of a little fragment of golden\nquartz the size of a walnut--into just one of its myriads of golden\natoms!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\n\"My world,\" Glora was saying. \"You like it? See the starlight on the\nlake? I have heard that your world looks like this at night, in summer.\nOurs is always like this. No day, no night. Just like this--starlight.\"\nHer hand went to Alan's shoulder. \"You like it? My world?\"\n\n\"Yes, Glora. It's very beautiful.\"\n\nThere was a sheen on everything, a soft, glowing sheen of\nphosphorescence from the rocks rising to meet the pale wan starlight.\nThe night air was soft, with a gentle breeze that rippled the distant\nlake into a great spread of gold and silver light.\n\nThe city was called Orena. I saw at once that we were about normal size\nin relation to its houses and people. There were fields beneath our\nledge, with farm implements lying in them; no workers, for this was the\ntime for sleep. Ribbons of roads wound over the country, pale streamers\nin the starlight.\n\nGlora gestured, \"The giants are on their island. Everyone sleeps now.\nYou see the island off there?\"\n\nBeyond the city, over the low stone roofs of its flat-topped dwellings,\nthe silver spread of lake showed a green-clad island some three miles\noff shore. The distance made its white stone houses seem small. But as\nI gazed, I realized that they were large compared to their environment,\nall far larger than those of the little town. The island was perhaps a\nmile in length. Between it and the mainland a boat was coming toward us.\nIt was a dark blob of hull on the shining water, and above it a queerly\nshaped circular sail was puffed out, like a balloon parachute, by the\nwind.\n\n\"The giants live there?\" said Alan. \"You mean Polter's men?\"\n\n\"And women. Yes.\"\n\n\"Are there many giants?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How many?\" I put in. \"How large are they? In relation to us now, I\nmean. And to your normal size?\"\n\n\"You ask so many questions so fast, George. There are two hundred or\nmore of the giants. And there are more than that many thousands of our\npeople, here. Slaves, because the giants are four times as large. This\nlittle city, these fields, these hills of stone and metal, all this was\nours to have in peace and happiness until your Polter came.\"\n\nShe gestured. \"Everywhere is a great reach of desert and forest. There\nare insects, but no wild beasts--nothing to harm us. Nature is kind\nhere. The weather is always like this. We were happy, until Polter\ncame.\"\n\n\"And only a few thousand people,\" Alan said. \"No other cities?\"\n\n\"What lies off in the great distance, we do not know. Our nation is ten\ntimes what is here. We have a few other cities, and some of our people\nlive in the forests.\"\n\nShe broke off. \"That boat is coming for Polter. He is in the city no\ndoubt of that. The boat will take him and that girl you call Babs, to\nthe giant's island. His castle is there.\"\n\nI turned to Alan. \"They must have arrived only recently. Before we go\nany further we have to decide what size to be. We can't be gigantic\nbecause I'm sure he'd kill Babs if he sees us. We've got to plan!\"\n\nIf we could get on that boat and go with him to the island--But in what\nsize? Very small? But then, if we were very small it would take us hours\nto get from here to the boat. Glora pointed out where it would\nland--just beyond the village where the houses were set in a sparse\nfringe. It would be there, apparently, in ten or fifteen minutes. Polter\nprobably was there now with Babs, waiting for it.\n\nIn our present size we could not get there in time. It was two or three\nmiles at least. But a trifle larger--the size of one of Polter's\ngiants--we would be able to make it. We would be seen, but in the pale\nstarlight, keeping away from the city as much as possible, we might only\nbe mistaken for Polter's people. And when we got closer we would\ndiminish our size, creep into the boat, get near Babs and Polter and\nthen plan what to do.\n\nWe climbed down from the ledge and stood at the base of the towering\ncliff which reared its jagged wall against the stars. A field and a road\nwere near us. The road seemed of normal size. A man was in the field. He\nwas apparently about my height. He presently discarded his work, walked\naway from us and vanished.\n\n\"Hurry, Glora.\" Alan and I stood beside her while she took pellets from\nher vials. We wanted our stature now to be four times what it was. Glora\ngave us pellets of both drugs, one of which was slightly more intense\nthan the other.\n\n\"Polter made them this way,\" she said. \"The two taken at once give just\nthe growth to take us from this normal size to the stature of the\ngiants.\"\n\nAlan and I did not touch our own vials. We had used none of our\nenlarging drug upon the journey, and the supply she had given us of the\nother was almost gone.\n\nAs I took these pellets which Glora now gave us, standing there by the\nside of that road, I recall that I was struck with the realization that\nnever once upon this journey had I conceived myself to be other than\nnormal stature. I am normally about six feet tall. I still felt--there\nin that golden atom--the same height. This landscape seemed of normal\nsize. There were trees nearby--spreading, fantastic-looking growths with\ngreat strings of pods hanging from them. But still--as I looked up to\nsee one arching over me with its blue-brown leaves and an air-vine\ncarrying vivid yellow blossoms--whatever the size of the tree, I could\nonly conceive of myself as a normal man of six-foot stature standing\nbeneath it. The human ego always supreme! Around each man's\nconsciousness of himself the entire universe revolves.\n\nWe crouched on the ground when this growth now began; it would not do to\nbe observed changing size. Polter's giants never did that. Years before,\nhe had made them large--his few hundred men and women. They were, Glora\nsaid, people both of this realm and from our great world\nabove--dissolute criminal characters who had now set themselves up here\nas the nucleus of a ruling race.\n\nIn a moment now, we were the size of these giants. Twenty to twenty-five\nfeet tall, in relation to the environment. But I did not feel so. As I\nstood up--still feeling myself in normal stature--I saw around me a\nshrunken little landscape. The trees, as though in a Japanese garden,\nwere about my own height; the road was a smooth, level path; the little\nfield near us had a toy fence around it. On another road nearby a man\nwas walking. In height he would barely have reached my knees. He saw us\nrise beside the trees. He darted off in alarm, and disappeared.\n\nI have taken longer to tell all this than the actual time which passed.\nWe could see the boat coming from the island, and it was still a fair\ndistance off shore. We ran along the road, skirting the edge of the\nlittle town. None of its houses were taller than ourselves. The windows\nand doorways were ovals into which we could only have inserted a head or\nan arm. Most of them were dark. Little people occasionally stared out,\nsaw us run past, and ducked back, thankful that we did not stop to\nharass them.\n\n\"This way,\" said Glora. She ran like a faun, hardly winded, with Alan\nand me heavily panting behind her. \"There are trees--thick trees--quite\nnear where the boat lands. We can get in them and hide and change our\nsize to smallness. But hurry, for we shall need a great deal of time\nwhen we are small!\"\n\nThe little spread of town and the shining lake remained always to our\nright. In five minutes we were past most of the houses. A patch of\nwoods, with thick, interlacing treetops about our own height, lay ahead.\nIt extended a few hundred feet over to the lake shore. The sailboat was\nheading in close. There was a broad starlit roadway at the edge of the\nlake, and a dock at which the boat was preparing to land.\n\nWould we be in time? I suddenly feared not. To get small now, with\ndistance lengthening between us and the boat, would be disastrous. And\nwhere was Polter?\n\nAbruptly we saw him. There had been only little people visible to us:\nnone of our own height. The lake roadway by the dock was brightly\nstarlit. As we approached the intervening patch of woods it seemed that\na crowd of little people were near the dock. Polter must have been\nsitting. But now he rose up. We could not mistake his thick hunched\nfigure, the lump on his shoulders clear in the starlight with the\ngleaming lake as a background. The crowd of little figures were milling\naround his knees. In the silence of the night the murmur of their voices\nfloated over to us.\n\n\"There he is!\" Alan gasped. We all three checked our running; we were at\nthe edge of the patch of woods. \"By God, there he is! Let's get larger\nand rush him! He's only a few hundred feet away!\"\n\nBut Babs? Where was Babs?\n\n\"Alan, get down!\" I crouched, pulling Alan and Glora with me. \"Don't let\nhim see us! We can't rush him Alan, 'til we find Babs. He'd see us\ncoming and kill her.\"\n\nOf all the strange events that had been flung at us, I think this sudden\ncrisis now most confused Alan and me.... To get larger, or smaller?\nWhich? Yet something had to be done at once.\n\nGlora said, \"We can get through the woods best in this size. We won't be\nseen and will be closer to the landing.\"\n\nWe crouched so that the treetops were always well over us. The patch of\nwoods was dark. A soil of black loam was under us, a thick soft\nunderbrush reached our knees, and lacy, flexible leaves and branches\nwere about shoulder height. We pushed them aside, forcing our way softly\nforward. It was not far. The little murmuring voices of the crowd grew\nlouder.\n\nPresently we were crouching at the other edge of the woods. I softly\nshoved the tree branches aside until we could all three get a clear view\nof the strange scene now directly before us.\n\nAnd I saw a toy dock, at which a twenty-foot, bargelike open sailboat\nwas landing; a narrow starlit roadway, crowded with a milling throng of\npeople all no more than a foot and a half in height. The crowd milled\nalmost to where we were crouching, unseen in the shrubbery.\n\nAcross the road by the dock, Polter stood with the crowd down around his\nknees. In height he seemed the old familiar Polter. Bareheaded, with his\nshaggy black hair shot with white. He was dressed in Earth fashion:\nnarrow black evening trousers and a white shirt and collar with flowing\nblack tie. I saw at once what Alan had noticed--the change in him. An\nabnormality of age. I would have called him now forty, or older. Beyond\neven that there was an abnormality. A man old before his time; or\nyounger than he should have been for the years he had lived. An\nindescribable mingling of something of the two worlds, perhaps. It\nmarked him with a look at once unnatural and sinister.\n\nThese were instant impressions. Glora was plucking at me. \"On the white\nchest of his shirt, something is there.\"\n\nPolter was coatless, with snowy white shirt and cuffs to his thick\nwrists. He was no more than fifty feet from us. On his shirt bosom\nsomething golden in color was hanging like a large bauble, an ornament,\nan insignia. It was strapped tightly there with a band about his chest,\na cord, like a necklace chain, up to his thick hunched neck, and other\nchains down to his belt.\n\nI stared at it. An ornament, like a cube held flat against his shirt\nfront--a little golden cube, ornate with tiny bars.\n\nI heard Alan murmuring, \"A cage! Why George, it's--\"\n\nAnd then, simultaneously, realization struck me. It was a golden cage\nstrapped there. And I seemed to see that there was something in it. A\ntiny figure? Babs!\n\n\"I think he has her there,\" Glora murmured. \"You see the little box with\nbars? The girl, Babs, is a prisoner in there.\" She spoke swiftly,\nvehemently. \"He will take the boat to the island.\"\n\nShe gripped us. \"You think it really best to go? I do what you say. I\nhad the wish to get to my father with these drugs.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Alan. \"We must keep close to Polter!\"\n\nWe were ready with our pellets. But a sudden activity in the road made\nus pause. The crowd of little people were hostile to Polter. A sullen\nhostility. They milled about him as he stood there, gazing down at them\nsardonically.\n\nAnd abruptly he shouted at them in English. \"You speak my language, some\nof you. Then listen!\"\n\nThe crowd fell silent.\n\n\"Listen. This iss your future Queen. Can you see her? She iss small now.\nBut she has the magic power. Soon she will be large, like me.\"\n\nThe crowd was shouting again. It surged forward, but it lacked a leader,\nand those in advance shoved backward in fear.\n\nPolter spoke again. \"This girl from my world, you will like her. She iss\nkind and very beautiful. When she iss large, you will see how\nbeautiful.\"\n\nA small stone suddenly came up from the throng of little people and\nstruck Polter on the shoulder. Then another. The crowd, emboldened, made\na rush: surged against his legs.\n\nHe shouted, \"You do that? Why, how dare you? I show you what giants do\nwhen you make dem angry!\"\n\nFrom down by his knees he plucked the small figure of a man. The crowd\nscattered with shouts of terror. Polter had the struggling eighteen-inch\nfigure by the wrist. He whirled it around his head like a ninepin and\nflung it over the canopy of the dock far out into the shimmering lake!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe trees around us expanded to towering forest giants. The underbrush\nrose up over our heads. We had taken a taste of the diminishing drug.\nGlora showed us how to touch it to our tongue several times, to adjust\nour size as we became smaller. It took us no more than a minute to\ndiminish. We could hear the roar of the crowd, and Polter's voice\nshouting. We ran forward through the great forest. It was a fair\ndistance out to the starlit road. We saw it as a wide shining esplanade.\nThe people now were giants twice our height! Polter, himself towering\nwith a seeming fifty-foot stature, was standing by the gigantic canopy\nof the dock. He had dispersed the crowd. There was an open space on the\nesplanade--a run for us of about a hundred feet.\n\n\"We've got to chance it,\" I murmured. \"Make a run for it--now.\"\n\nWe darted across. In the confusion, with all eyes centered on Polter, we\nescaped discovery. It was dim under the dock canopy. Polter had backed\nfrom the road and was walking to the barge. It lay like the length of an\nocean liner, its sail looming an enormous spread above it. The gunwale\nwas level with the dock. A dozen or more fifty-foot men were greeting\nPolter. They were amidships.\n\nI realize now that in those moments as we scurried aboard like wharf\nrats, we took wild chances. We made for the stern which momentarily was\nunoccupied. To Polter and his men we were eight or nine inches tall. We\ndropped over the gunwale, slid down the thirty or forty-foot incline of\nthe interior and landed on the bottom of the boat.\n\nThere were many places where we could safely hide. A litter of gigantic\nrope-strands was around us. We could see the bottom of a crossbench\nlooming over head, and the great curving sides of the vessel with the\ngunwales outlined against the starlight.\n\nThe boat left the dock in a moment; the sail bellied out, enormous over\nus. Ten feet forward from us the towering figure of a man sat on a bench\nwith the steering mechanism before him. Further on, the other men were\ndispersed, with one or two in the distant bow. Polter reclined on a\ncushioned couch amidships. Looking along the dark widely level bottom\nof the boat there were only the feet and legs of men visible.\n\nAlan whispered, \"Let's get closer.\"\n\nWe were insects soundlessly scuttling unnoticed in the dimness. It was\nnoisy down here--the clank of the steering mechanism; the swish and\nsurge of the water against the hull; the voices of the men.\n\nWe passed the boots of the seated helmsmen, and found another hiding\nplace nearer Polter. We could see his giant length plainly. None of the\nother men were near him. He was reclining on an elbow, stretched at ease\non a cushion. And at the moment, he was fumbling with the chains that\nfastened the little golden cage to his chest. The cage was double its\nformer size to us now. A shaft of pale light came down, reflected from\nthe great sail surface overhead. It struck the bars of the cage. We\ncould see a small figure in there.\n\nThen we heard Polter's voice. \"I will let you out, Babs. You come out,\nsit on my hand and talk with me. That will be nice? We haf a little\ntime.\"\n\nHe unfastened the cage and put it on the cushion beside him. He was\nstill propped up on one elbow.\n\n\"I let you out, now. Be careful, Babs.\"\n\nMy heart was almost smothering me. \"Alan! We've got to get still closer!\nTry something! Get large, shall we?\"\n\nAlan whispered tensely, \"I don't know! I don't know what to do.\"\n\n\"We can get closer,\" Glora whispered. \"But never larger--not here. They\nwould discover us too soon.\"\n\nWe crept forward. We reached the edge of the cushion. Its top surface\nwas a trifle lower than our heads--a billowing, wrinkled mass of fabric.\nBut I saw that the folds of it were rough enough to afford a footing. I\nthought that I could climb it. We stood erect. There was a deep shadow\nalong here, but it was brighter on the cushion top. We could see over\nits edge; an undulating spread of surface with the giant length of\nPolter stretched over it. The cage was near us. Polter's great fingers\nfumbled with it; a door in the lattice bars flipped open.\n\n\"Careful, my Babs!\" His voice was a throaty, rumbling roar above us.\n\"Careful! I do not want you to be hurt.\"\n\nFrom the little doorway came the figure of Babs! The starlight glowed on\nher blue dress; her black hair was tumbling over her shoulders; her face\nwas pale but she was unharmed.\n\nI think that I had never loved her so much as at that moment. Nor ever\nseen her so beautiful as in miniature, standing at the door of her\ngolden cage, bravely facing the monstrous misshapen figure of her\ncaptor.\n\nWe heard her small voice.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Stand quiet. Now I put my hand for you.\"\n\nHis monstrous hand bristled with a thatch of heavy black hair. He slid\nit carefully along the cushion. Babs was barely the length of one of its\nfinger joints. She climbed upon its palm.\n\n\"That iss right, Babs. Now I bring you--hold tight to my finger. Here, I\ncrook the little one. Fling your arms around it.\"\n\nWith a swoop his hand took her aloft and away. Then we saw her, twenty\nfeet or so in the air, still on his hand as he held it near his face.\n\n\"Now we haf a little talk, Babs. When we get to the island, I put you\nback in your cage.\"\n\nI had a sudden flash of realization. There was something I could do. I\nknow now my judgment was bad. I recall it struck me that Alan would want\nto do it also. And, perhaps, even Glora. But that wouldn't work. My\nchances, however desperate, were better alone. Glora and Alan--in our\npresent size--could doubtless disembark safely. Glora knew the layout\nof the island. And she could follow Polter.\n\nAlan and Glora were standing beside me peering over that billowing\ncushion spread toward the distant giant palm with Babs standing upon it.\nI gripped Alan's shoulder.\n\n\"See here, Alan,\" I whispered vehemently: \"What ever happens, we must\nfollow Polter. Glora knows the way. Some opportunity will come to get\nlarge without being discovered. Then we'll rush Polter!\"\n\nAlan's white face turned to me. \"Yes, that's what we're planning. But\nGeorge, here on this boat--\"\n\n\"Of course not. Can't do it here. Tell Glora, to be sure to follow\nPolter. Whatever happens, you'll think of nothing else: you won't will\nyou?\"\n\n\"George, what--\"\n\n\"We've got to make some opportunity.\" I was trembling inside, fearful\nthat Alan would be suspicious of me. Yet I had to make sure that he and\nGlora would stay as close to Polter as possible.\n\n\"All right,\" Alan agreed. \"Listen to them.\"\n\nPolter was talking to Babs. But I didn't hear the words I moved a trifle\naway. Rash decision! I hardly decided anything. There was only the\nvision of Babs before me and my love for her. My desperate need of doing\nsomething; getting to her, seeing her, being with her. I wanted her near\nmy own size again as though the blessed normality of that would\nrationalize and lessen her danger. If only I had been less rash! If only\nback there in that tunnel I had stopped to see what it was my foot\nkicked against!\n\nI slid away. Alan and Glora did not notice it; they were whispering\ntogether and gazing over the cushion at Babs. In the shadow of the\ncushion I moved some ten feet. On the undulating top of the cushion the\nlittle golden cage stood with its lattice door open. It was a few feet\nfrom my face.\n\nI fumbled at my belt for the diminishing vial. I found one pellet left.\nWell, that would be enough. I was hurried. Alan might discover me.\nPolter might put Babs back in the cage and close its door. We might be\nnear the island already, and the confusion, the activity of disembarking\nwould defeat me. A thousand things might happen.\n\nI touched the pellet to my tongue. In a few seconds the drug action had\ncome and passed. The cushion top loomed well over my head. The side was\na ridged, indescribably unnatural vista of cliff wall. The fabric was\ncoarse with hairy strands, dented into little ravines and crevices. I\nclimbed and I came panting to the pillow surface. The golden cage was\nsix or eight feet away and was now two feet high.\n\nAgain I touched the drug to my tongue; held it an instant. The cage drew\naway; grew to a normal six-foot height; then larger, until in a moment\nit stopped. I stood peering at it, trying to gauge its size in relation\nto me. I wanted so intensely now to appear normal in Babs' eyes. The\ncage seemed about ten feet high. A little less, possibly. I barely\ntasted the pellet, and replaced it carefully in the vial. I could only\nhope its efficacy would be preserved.\n\nI had to chance that I wouldn't be seen while crossing this billowy\nexpanse. I ran. The rope strands of the fabric now had spaces between\ntheir curving surfaces. The cage was a shining golden house, set on this\nwide rolling area. Far in the distance there was a blur--Polter's\nreclining body.\n\nI reached the cage. It was a room about ten feet square and equally as\nhigh. Walled solid, top and bottom, and on three sides. The front was a\nlattice of bars, with a narrow six-foot doorway, standing open now.\n\nI dashed in. The interior was not wholly bare. There was a metal-wrought\ncouch fastened to the wall, with a railing around it and handles. It\nsuggested a ship's bunk. There was a railing at convenient height all\naround the wall.\n\nI sought a hiding place. I saw just one--under the couch. It was\nsecluded enough. There was a grillelike lattice extending down from the\nseat to the floor. I squeezed under one end, and lay wedged behind the\ngrille.\n\nHow much time passed I don't know. My thoughts were racing. Babs would\nbe coming.\n\nI heard the distant approaching rumble of Polter's voice. Through the\ngrille I could see across the floor of the ten foot cage to the front\nlattice bars. Outside, there appeared a huge, pink-white, mottled\nblob--Polter's hand, a ridged and pitted surface with great, bristling\nblack stalks of hair.\n\nThe figure of Babs came through the cage doorway. Blessed normality! The\nsame slim little Babs who always stood, since we were both matured, with\nher head about level with my shoulders.\n\nThe latticed door swung shut with a reverberating metallic clank. Babs\nstood tense, clinging to the wall railing. I heard the blurred rumble of\nPolter's voice.\n\n\"Hold tightly, my little Babs!\"\n\nThe room lurched; went upward and sidewise with a wild dizzying swoop.\nBabs clung to the rail and I was wedged prone under the couch. Then the\nmovement stopped; there was a jolting, rocking, and outside I heard the\nclank of metal. Polter was fastening the chains of the cage to his\nchest.\n\nA white glow now came through the bars. It was starlight reflecting from\nPolter's shirt bosom. An abyss of distance was outside. I could see\nnothing but the white glow.\n\nMomentarily there was very little movement in the room. Only the\nrhythmic sway of Polter's breathing and an occasional jolt as he shifted\nhis position. The floor was tilted at a sharp angle. Babs came toward\nthe couch, pulling herself along the wall railing.\n\nI called softly, \"Babs!\"\n\nShe stopped. I called again, \"Babs! Don't cry out! It's George!\nHere--stand still!\"\n\nShe gave a little cry. \"George--where are you? I don't--\"\n\nI slid out from my concealment and stood up, holding to the railing.\n\nBlessed normality of size! She cried again, \"George! You! How did you\nget here?\"\n\nShe edged along the railing, a step or two down the tilting floor, then\nreleased her hold and flung herself into my waiting arms.\n\n\"I think we are landing. Hold on to the railing, George. When the room\nmoves it goes with a rush.\"\n\nBabs laughed softly. It must have seemed to her, after being alone in\nhere, that now our plight was far less desperate. She had told me how\nshe was captured. A man accosted her on the Terrace, saying he wanted to\nspeak to her about Alan. Then a weapon threatened her. Amid all those\npeople she was held up in old-fashioned style, hurried to a taxicar and\nwhirled away.\n\nShe was saying now, \"When Polter moves, it is dizzying. You'll see.\"\n\n\"I have already, Babs. Heavens, what a swoop!\"\n\nThe room was more level now. We carefully drew ourselves to the front\nlattice. Polter was standing, and we had the white sheen from his shirt\nfront. A sheer drop was outside the bars, but looking down I could see\nthe outlines of his body with the huge spread of the boat's cockpit\nunderneath us.\n\nA confusion of rumbling voices sounded. Blurred giant shapes were\noutside. The room jolted and swayed as the boat landed and Polter\ndisembarked.\n\nBabs stood clinging to me. We, at least, were normal in this metal\nbarred room, Babs and I. But outside was the abnormality of largeness. I\nthink that in relation to us, the men were of over two hundred-foot\nstature, and the hunched Polter a trifle less. It seemed as he walked\nthat we were lurching at least a hundred and fifty feet above ground.\n\n\"You had better hide,\" Babs urged. \"He might stop and speak to someone.\nIf anyone looked in here you would be seen; no chance then, even to get\nacross the room.\"\n\nIt was true. But for a few moments I lingered. I could distinguish\nvegetation on their flat roof-tops, as though flower gardens were laid\nthere.\n\nWe passed a house with its hundred-foot oval windows all aglow with\nlight. Music floated out--a distant blare of sounds, and the ribald\nlaughter of giant voices. I had seen no women among these giants of the\nisland. But now a huge face was at one of the ovals. A dissolute,\npainted woman of Earth, staring out at Polter as he passed. It was like\nthe enormous close-up image on a large motion picture screen. She\nshouted ribald jest as he went by.\n\n\"George, please go back. Suppose she had seen you?\"\n\nWe were ascending a hill. A distance ahead a great oblong building\nloomed like a giant's palace, which indeed it was. We headed for it,\npassed through a vast arching doorway into the greater dimness of an\nechoing interior. I scurried back across the lurching room and again\nwedged myself under the couch. Babs stood at the lattice ten feet away.\nWe dared to talk in low tones; the rumbling voices and footsteps outside\nwould make our tiny voices inaudible to Polter.\n\nI was tense with my plans. I had told them to Babs. With the one\nremaining partially used pellet of the diminishing drug we could make\nourselves small enough to walk out through the bars. Then my black vial\nof the enlarging drug, as yet unused, would take us up, out to our own\nworld. We could not use the drugs now. But the chance might come when\nPolter would set the cage on the ground, or somewhere so that we might\nclimb down from it, with a chance to hide and get large before we were\ndiscovered. I would fight our way upward; all I needed was a fair start\nin size.\n\nBut I lay now with doubts assailing me. This was the first moment I had\nhad for calm thoughts, though in truth they were far from calm! Were\nAlan and Glora following us now? I could only hope so. Once out of this,\nBabs and I would have to rejoin them. But how? Panic swept me. I\nshouldn't have left them. Or at least I should have told them what I was\ntrying to do, and given Alan a chance to plan.\n\nThe panic grew, the premonition of disaster. From my belt I took the\nopalescent vial with its one partially used pellet. I dumped the pellet\nout. It was spoiling! The exposure to the air and the moisture of my\ntongue, had ruined it! I realized the catastrophe, as I held its\ncrumbling, deliquescing fragments on my palm it melted into vapor and\nwas gone!\n\nWe couldn't make ourselves smaller! Now we'd have to wait until Polter\nopened the cage. But once outside, the enlarging drug would give us our\nchance to fight our way upward. My trembling fingers sought the black\nvial in my belt. It wasn't there! My mind flung back: in that tunnel,\nsomething had dropped and I had kicked it! Accursed chance! My accursed,\nheedless stupidity!\n\nI had lost the black vial! We were helpless! Caged! Marooned here in a\nsize microscopic!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nI lay concealed and Babs stood at the lattice of our cage room. I was\naware that Polter had entered some vast apartment of this giant palace.\nThe light outside was brighter; I heard voices--Polter's and another\nman's. I could see the distant monster shape of one. He was at first so\nfar away that all his outline was visible. A seated man in a huge white\nroom. I thought there were great shelves with enormous bottles. The\nspread of table tops passed under our cage as Polter walked by them.\nThey held a litter of apparatus, and there was the smell of chemicals in\nthe air. This seemed to be a laboratory.\n\nThe man stood up to greet Polter. I had a glimpse of his head and\nshoulders. He wore a white linen coat, open, soft collar and black tie.\nHe seemed an old man, queerly old, with snow-white hair.\n\nI had an instant of whirling impressions. Something was familiar about\nhis face. It was wrinkled and seamed with lines of age and care. There\nwere gentle blue eyes.\n\nThen all I could see was the vast spread of his white shirt and coat, a\nblack splotch of his tie outside our bars as Polter faced him.\n\nBabs gave a low cry. \"Why--why--dear God--\"\n\nAnd then I knew! And Polter's words were not needed, though I heard\ntheir rumble.\n\n\"I am back again, Kent. Are you still rebellious? You haf still\ndetermined to compound no more of our drugs? You would rather I killed\nyou? Then see what I haf here. This little cage, someone--\"\n\nIt was Dr. Kent whom he addressed. He must have been here all these\nyears!\n\nBabs turned her white face toward me. \"George, it's father! He's alive!\"\n\n\"Quiet, Babs! Don't let him know I'm here. Remember!\"\n\nThe old man recognized her. \"Babs!\" It was an agonized cry. The blur of\nhim was gone as he sank down into his chair.\n\nPolter continued standing, I could envisage his sardonic grin.\n\nFrom over us came Polter's rumble. \"She iss glad to see you, Kent. I haf\nher here, safe. You always knew I would nefer be satisfied until I had\nmy little Babs? Well, now I haf her. Can you hear me?\"\n\nA sudden desperate calmness fell on Babs. She called evenly. \"Yes, I\nhear you. Father, don't anger him. Do what he says. Dr. Polter, will you\nlet me be with my father? After all these years, let me be with him,\njust for a little while. In his size--normal.\"\n\n\"Hah! My Babs iss scheming.\"\n\n\"No, I want to talk to him, after all these years when I thought he was\ndead.\"\n\n\"Scheming? You think, my little Babs, that he has the drugs? I am not so\nmuch a fool. He makes them. He can do that. And that last secret\nreaction, only he can perform. He iss stubborn. Never would he tell me\nthat one reaction. But he makes no drugs complete, only when I am here.\"\n\n\"No, Dr. Polter! I want only to be with him.\"\n\nThe old man's broken voice floated up to us. \"You won't harm her,\nPolter?\"\n\n\"No. Fear nothing. But you no longer rebel?\"\n\n\"I'll do what you tell me.\" The tones carried hopeless resignation,\nyears of being beaten down, rebelling--but now this last blow vanquished\nhim. Then he spoke again, with a sudden strange fire.\n\n\"Even for the life of my daughter, I will not make your drugs, Polter,\nif you mean to harm our Earth.\"\n\nThe golden cage room swooped as Polter sat down. \"Hah! Now we bargain.\nWhat do you care what I do to your world? You never will see it again. I\ncan lie to you. My plans--\"\n\n\"I _do_ care.\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you, Kent. I am good-natured now. Why should I not\nbe with my dear little Babs? I tell you, I am done with the Earth world.\nIt iss much nicer here. My friends, they haf a good time always. We like\nthis little atom realm. I am going out once more. I must hide the little\npiece of golden quartz so no harm will come to it.\"\n\nPolter was evidently in a high good humor. His voice fell to an intimate\ntone of comradeship; but still I could not mistake the irony in it.\n\n\"You listen to me, Kent. There was a time, years ago, when we were good\nfriends. You liked your young assistant, the hunchback Polter. Iss it\nnot so? Then why should we quarrel now? I am gifing up the Earth world.\nI wanted of it only the little Babs.... You look at me so strange! You\ndo not speak.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to say,\" retorted Dr. Kent wearily.\n\n\"Then you listen. I haf much gold above in Quebec. You know that. So\nvery simple to take it out of our atom, grow large with it to what we\ncall up there the size of a hundred feet. I haf a place, a room,\nsecluded from prying eyes under a dome roof. I become very tall, holding\na piece of gold. It is large when I am a hundred feet tall. So I haf\ncollected much gold. They think I own a mine. I haf a smelter and my\ngold quartz I make into ingots, refined to the standard purity. So\nsimple, and I am a rich man.\n\n\"But gold does not bring happiness, my friend Kent.\" He chuckled\nironically at his use of the platitude. \"There iss more in life than the\nownership of gold. You ask my plans. I haf Babs, now. I am gifing up the\nEarth world. The mysterious man they know as Frank Rascor will vanish. I\nwill hide our little fragment of quartz. No one up there will even try\nto find it. Then I come down here, with Babs, and we will haf so nice a\nlittle government and rule this world. No more of the drugs then will be\nneeded, Kent. When you die, let the secret die with you.\"\n\nAgain Polter's voice became ingratiating, even more so than before. \"We\nwill be friends, Kent. Our little Babs will lof me; why should she not?\nYou will tell her--advise her--and we will all three be very happy.\"\n\nDr. Kent said abruptly, \"Then leave her with me now. That was her\nrequest, a moment ago. If you expect to treat her kindly, then why\nnot--\"\n\n\"I do! I do! But not now. I cannot spare her now. I am very busy, but I\nmust take her with me.\"\n\nBabs had been silent, clinging to the bars of our cage. She called;\n\"Why? I ask you to put this cage down.\"\n\n\"Not now, little bird.\"\n\n\"Let me be with my father.\"\n\nIt struck a pang through me. Babs was scheming but not the way Polter\nthought. She wanted the cage put on the floor, herself out, and a chance\nfor me to escape. I had not yet told her of my miserable stupidity in\nlosing the vial.\n\nPolter was repeating, \"No, little bird. Presently; not now. I will take\nyou with me on my last trip out. I want to talk with you in normal size\nwhen I haf time.\"\n\nOur room swooped as he stood up. \"You think over what I haf said, Kent.\nYou get ready now to make the fresh drugs I will need to bring down all\nmy men from the outer world. They will all be glad to come, or, if\nnot--well, we can easily kill those who refuse. You make the drugs. I\nneed plenty. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That iss good. I come back soon and gif you the catalyst for that last\nreaction. Will you be ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe blur outside our bars swung with a dizzying whirl as Polter turned\nand left the room, locking its door after him with a reverberating\nclank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeft alone in his laboratory, Dr. Kent began his preparations for\nmaking a fresh supply of the drugs. This room, with two smaller ones\nadjoining, was at once his workshop and his prison. He stood at his\nshelves, selecting the basic chemicals. He could not complete the final\ncompounds. The catalyst which was necessary for the final reaction would\nbe brought to him by Polter.\n\nHow long he worked there with his thoughts in a whirl at seeing Babs, he\ndid not know. His movements were automatic; he had done all this so many\ntimes before. His mind was confused, and he was trembling from head to\nfoot--an old, queerly, unnaturally old man now--unnerved. His fingers\ncould hardly hold the test tubes.\n\nHis thoughts were flying. Babs was here, come down from the world above.\nIt was disaster--the thing he had feared all these years.\n\nHe suddenly heard a voice.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\nAnd again: \"Father!\" A tiny voice, down by his shoe tops. Two small\nfigures were there on the floor beside him. They were both panting,\nwinded by running. They were enlarging.\n\nIt was Alan and Glora, who had followed Polter from the boat, then\ndiminished again and had come running through the tiny crack under the\nmetal door of the laboratory.\n\nThey grew to a foot in size, down by Dr. Kent's legs. He was too\nunnerved to stand; he sat in a chair while Alan swiftly told him what\nhad happened. Babs was in the golden cage. Dr. Kent knew that; but none\nof them knew what had happened to me.\n\n\"We must make you small, Father. We have the drugs, here with us.\"\n\n\"Yes! How much have you? Show me. Oh, my boy, that you are here--and\nBabs--\"\n\n\"Don't you worry. We'll get away from him.\"\n\nGlora and Alan had almost reached Dr. Kent's size before their excited\nfingers could get out the vials. They took some of the diminishing drug\nto check their growth. Alan handed his father a black vial.\n\n\"Yes, lad--\"\n\n\"No! Wait, that's the wrong drug. This other--\"\n\nDr. Kent had opened the vial. His trembling hand spilled some of the\npellets, but none of them noticed it.\n\n\"Father, this one.\" Alan held an opalescent vial. \"Take this one.\"\n\nGlora said abruptly, \"Listen! Is that someone coming?\"\n\nThey thought they heard approaching footsteps. A moment passed but no\none came into the room.\n\n\"Hurry,\" urged Glora. \"That was nothing. We're waiting too long.\"\n\n\"My boy--Alan, after all these years--\"\n\nAs they were about to take the diminishing drug a very queer sound came\nfrom across the room. A scuttling, scratching, and the drone of wings.\n\n\"God, Father--look!\"\n\nOver by the wall, a giant fly was running across the floor. The fly had\neaten some of the sweetish powder.\n\nThe enlarging drug was loose!\n\nA few drops of water lay mingled with the drug on the floor. And from\nthe water nameless hideous things were rising!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nTo Alan the first moments that followed the escape of the drug were the\nmost horrible of his life. The discovery struck old Dr. Kent, Glora and\nAlan into a numb, blank confusion. They stood transfixed, staring with\ncold terror at the fly which was scurrying along the floor close to the\nwall. It was already as large as Alan's hand. It ran into the corner,\nhit the wall in its confused alarm, and turned back. Its wings were\ndroning with an audible hum. It reared itself on its hairy legs, lifted\nand sailed across the room.\n\nAs though drawn by a magnet, Alan turned to watch it. It landed on the\nwall. Alan was aware of Dr. Kent rushing with trembling steps to a shelf\nwhere bottles stood. Glora was stricken into immobility, the blood\ndraining from her face.\n\nThe fly flew again. It passed directly over Alan. Its body, with a\nmembrane sac of eggs, was now as large as his head; its widespread\ntransparent wings were beating with a reverberating drone.\n\nAlan flung a bottle which was on the table beside him. It missed the\nfly, crashed against the ceiling, came down with splintering glass and\nspilling liquid. Fumes spread chokingly over the room.\n\nThe fly landed again on the floor. Larger now! Expanding with a horribly\nrapid growth. Glora flung something--a little wooden rack with a few\nempty test tubes in it. The rack struck the monstrous fly, but did not\nhurt it. The fly stood with hairy legs braced under its bulging body.\nIts multiple eyes were staring at the humans. And with its size must\nhave come a sense of power, for it seemed to Alan that the monstrous\ninsect was abnormally alert as it stood measuring its adversaries,\ngathering itself to attack them.\n\nOnly a few seconds had passed. Confused thoughts swept Alan. This fly\nwith its growth would soon fill this room. Burst it; burst upward\nthrough a wrecked palace; soar out, and by the power of its size alone\ndevastate this world.\n\nHe heard himself shouting, \"Father, get back! It's too large! I've _got_\nto kill it!\"\n\nCould he wrestle with it and hope to win? Alan edged around the center\ntable. He was bathed in cold sweat. This thing was horrifying! The fly\nwas already half the length of his own body. In a moment it might be\ntwice that! He was aware of Glora pulling at him, and his father rushing\npast him with a bottle of liquid, shouting:\n\n\"Alan! Run! You and the girl, get out of here! Into the other room--\"\n\nThen Alan saw the things on the floor! His foot crushed one with a\nslippery squash! Nameless, hideous, noisome things grown monstrous,\nrisen from their lurking invisibility in the drops of water! Sodden,\ngray-black and green-slimed monsters of the deep; palpitating masses of\npulp! One lay rocking, already as large as a football with streamers of\nooze hanging from it, and squirting a black inky fluid. Others were rods\nof red jelly-pulp, already as large as lead pencils, quivering,\ntwitching. Disease germs, these ghastly things, enlarging from the\ninvisibility of a drop of water!\n\nThe fly landed with a thud on the center table. The fumes of the\nshattered bottle of chemicals were choking Alan. He flung himself toward\nthe monster fly, but Glora held him.\n\n\"No! Escape to the other room!\"\n\nDr. Kent was stamping the things upon the floor; pouring acids upon\nthem. Some eluded him. The air in the room was unbreathable....\n\nAlan and Glora reached the bedroom. The laboratory was a hideous chaos.\nThey were aware of its outer door opening, disclosing the figure of\nPolter who, undoubtedly, had been attracted by the noise. He shouted a\nstartled oath. Alan heard it above the beating wings of the monstrous\nfly. Things lurched at the opened door; Polter banged it upon them and\nrushed away, shouting the alarm through the palace.\n\nDr. Kent was stammering, \"Not the enlarging drug, Glora, child, the\nother! Hurry!\"\n\nAlan helped Glora with the opalescent vial. Things were lurching toward\nthis room, from the laboratory. Alan, with averted face, choked by the\nincoming fumes, slammed the door upon the gruesome turmoil.\n\nThey took the diminishing drug. The bedroom expanded. The hideous sounds\nfrom the laboratory, and the whole palace now ringing with a wild alarm,\nsoon faded into blessed remoteness of distance....\n\n\"I think this is the way, Alan. Off there--a doorway from my bedroom.\nPolter always kept it locked, but it leads into a corridor. We must get\nout of here. A crack under the door--is that it, off there?\" Dr. Kent\npointed into the gloomy blur of distance. \"We're horribly small--it's so\nfar to run--and I've lost my sense of direction.\"\n\nThe drug had ceased its action. The wooden floor of the room had\nexpanded to a spread of cellular surface, ridged with broken, tubelike\ntunnels; pits and jagged cave-mouths. A knothole yawned like a crater a\nhundred feet away.\n\n\"We are too small,\" Glora protested hurriedly. \"The door is where you\nsay, Dr. Kent, but miles away.\"\n\nWith the other drug, the room contracted. The floor surface shrank and\nsmoothed a little. The door was distinguishable--a square panel several\nhundred feet in width and towering into the upper haze. The black line\nof the crack was visible along its bottom.\n\nThey ran to it. The top of the crack was ten feet above their heads.\nThey ran under, across the wide intervening darkness toward a glow of\nlight. Then they came from under the door into a corridor--and shrank\nagainst a cliff wall as with a rush of wind and pounding tread the\nblurred shapes of a man's huge feet and legs rushed past. The upper air\nwas filled with rumbling shouts.\n\n\"We must chance it!\" exclaimed Dr. Kent. \"It's too far in this size. We\nmust get larger--and if they see us, we'll fight our way out!\"\n\nIn the turmoil of the doomed palace no one noticed them. They cast aside\nall restraint. It was too dangerous to wait. The excessive dose they\ntook of the drug made the corridor shrink with dizzying speed. They\nrushed along its length. Alan hurled a little man aside who was in their\npath. They were already larger than Polter's people.\n\nThey squeezed out of a shrinking doorway. The dwindling island was a\nturmoil. Little figures were pouring from the palace. At the edge of the\nwater. Alan, Glora and Dr. Kent stood for an instant looking behind\nthem. The palace was rocking. Its roof heaved upward and then smashed\nand fell aside with the clatter of tumbling masonry. The monstrous fly,\nits hideous face mashed and oozing, reared itself up and, with broken\ntorn wings, tried to soar away. But it could not. It slipped back. The\ndrone and buzz of its fright sounded over the chaos of noise. Other\nthings came lurching and twisting upward, slithering out....\n\nThe expanding body of the fly was pushing the palace walls outward. In a\nmoment it collapsed and the fly emerged.\n\nTo Alan and his companions the scene was all shrinking into a miniature\nchaos of horror at their shoe tops. A diminuendo of screams mingled down\nthere. Overhead were the stars, shining peacefully remote. Nearby lay a\nrapidly narrowing channel of shining water. A tiny city was across it.\nLights were moving. The panic had spread from the island to Orena.\nBeyond the tiny city, was a range of mountains, a cliff, gleaming in the\nstarlight, and tunnel-mouths.\n\nSuddenly against the stars off there, Alan saw the enlarging figure of\nPolter, his hunched shape unmistakable. He was facing the other way. He\nlunged and scrambled into a yawning black hole in the mountains. Polter\nwas escaping! None of these people except himself had the drugs. He was\nescaping with the golden cage, out of this doomed atomic world to the\nEarth above.\n\nGlora murmured, \"There is our way out. Your way. And that is Polter\ngoing. I do not think he saw us. So much is growing gigantic here.\"\n\nDr. Kent muttered, \"We will wait a moment--wade across--or leap over,\nand follow him out. Babs is with him--dear God I hope so! This is a\ndoomed realm!\"\n\nAlan held Glora close. And suddenly he was laughing--a madness, half\nhysterical. \"Why, this, all this--why look, Glora, it's funny! This\nlittle world all excited, an ant-hill, outraged! Look! There's our giant\nsailboat!\"\n\nDown near their feet the inch-long sailboat stood at its dock. Tiny\nhuman figures were rushing for it; others, floundering in the water,\nwere trying to climb upon it. Dr. Kent had stepped a foot or two from\nthe shore, and tiny, lashing white rollers rocked the boat, almost\nengulfing it.\n\nAlan's laugh rang out. \"God! It's funny, isn't it? All those little\ncreatures so excited!\"\n\n\"Steady, lad!\" Dr. Kent touched him. \"Don't let yourself laugh! A moment\nnow, then we'll wade across. Polter won't have much start on us. We\nmustn't get too close to him in size, but try and attack him unawares.\nWe've got to get Babs away from him.\"\n\nThe narrowing passage rose hardly to their knees. They stepped ashore,\nwell to one side of the toy city. Their growth had almost stopped. But\nsuddenly Alan realized that Glora was diminishing! She had taken the\nother drug.\n\n\"Glora! What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I must go back, Alan. This is my world, doomed perhaps, but I cannot\nforsake it now. I must give the enlarging drug to my father. And others\nwho can rise and fight these monsters.\"\n\n\"Glora!\"\n\nDr. Kent said hurriedly, \"She's right, Alan. There is a chance they can\nsave their city. For her to leave them would be dastardly.\"\n\nShe cried, \"You go on up, Alan. You have enough of the drugs. I am going\nback!\"\n\n\"No,\" he protested. \"You can't! If you do, I'm coming with you!\"\n\nShe clung to him. He felt her body diminishing within his encircling\narms. His love for her swept him--this girl who had cajoled Polter, or\ntricked him and stolen several of the vials from him, heavens knows how,\nand followed him up to the other world. This girl whom Alan had come to\nlove, was leaving him, perhaps forever.\n\nAs he stood there, with the miniature landscape at his feet in the wan\nstarlight--the panic-stricken tiny city, the island with its monsters\nrising to overwhelm this tiny world--it seemed to Alan that if he let\nher go it was the end for him of all life's promised happiness.\n\n\"Alan, lad, come.\" His father was pulling him along. So horrible a\nchoice! Alan thought that I was back on that island. But Babs, a\nprisoner in the golden cage, was with Polter, plunging upward in size.\nAnd his father was beside him, pleading.\n\n\"Alan--come--I can't get out alone, or save Babs. And Polter, with the\npower of this drug, can conquer and enslave our Earth as he has enslaved\nOrena--just one little city of one tiny golden atom! Believe me, lad,\nyour duty lies above.\"\n\nGlora's head was now down at Alan's waist. He stooped and kissed her\nwhite forehead; his fingers, just for an instant, smoothed her glossy\nhair.\n\n\"Good-bye, Glora.\"\n\nShe plunged away, and her tread as she dwindled mashed the forest behind\nthe city. Alan and his father ran for the cliff. They were too large to\nsqueeze into the little hole. But in a moment they made themselves\nsmaller. They climbed as they dwindled; checked the drug action and\nrushed into the tunnel-mouth.\n\nAlan stopped just for an instant to gaze out over the starlit scene. It\nwas almost the same viewpoint from which he had his first sight of\nGlora's world only an hour or two before. The distant island beyond the\ncity showed plainly with the shining water around it. The vegetation\nthere was growing! And there were dark, horribly formless blobs lurching\noutward and rising with monstrous bulk against the background of the\nstars!\n\n\"Alan! Come, lad!\"\n\nWith a prayer for Glora trembling on his lips, Alan plunged into the dim\nphosphorescent gloom of the tunnel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nTo Babs and me the ride in the golden cage strapped to Polter's chest as\nhe made his escape outward into largeness was an experience awesome and\nfrightening almost beyond description. We heard the alarm in the palace\non the island. Polter rushed to Dr. Kent's laboratory door, looked in,\nand in a moment banged it shut. Babs and I saw very little. We knew only\nthat something terrible had happened; we could see only a blur with\nformless things in the void beneath our bars; and there were the\nchoking fumes of chemicals surging at us.\n\nPolter rushed through the castle corridor. We heard rumbling distant\nshouts.\n\n\"The drug is loose! The drug is loose! Monsters! Death for everyone!\"\n\nThe room swayed with horrible dizzying lurches as Polter ran. We clung\nto the lattice bars, our legs and arms entwined. There were moments when\nPolter leaped, or suddenly stooped, and our reeling senses all but\nfaded.\n\n\"Babs! Don't let go! Don't lose consciousness!\"\n\nIf she should be limp, here in this lurching room, her body to be flung\nback and forth across its confines--that would be death in a moment. I\ndidn't think I could hold her, but I managed to get an arm about her\nwaist.\n\n\"Babs, are you all right?\"\n\n\"I'm--all right, George. I can stand it. We're--he is enlarging.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI saw water far beneath us, lashed into a turmoil of foam with Polter's\nwading steps. There was a brief swaying vista of a toy city; starlight\noverhead; a lurching swaying miniature of landscape as Polter ran for\nthe towering cliffs. Then he climbed and scrambled into the\ntunnel-mouth. Had he turned at that instant doubtless he would have seen\nthe rising distant figures of Glora, Alan and Dr. Kent. But evidently he\ndidn't see them. Nor did we.\n\nPolter spoke only very occasionally to Babs. \"Hold tightly!\" It was a\nrumbling voice from above us. He made no move to touch the cage, except\nthat a few times the great blur of his hand came up to adjust its angle.\n\nThe lurching and jolting was less violent in the tunnel. Polter's frenzy\nto escape was subsiding into calmness. He traversed the tunnel with a\nmethodical stride. We were aware of him climbing over the noisome\nlitter of the dead giant's body which blocked the tunnel's further end.\nWe heard his astonished exclamations. But evidently he did not suspect\nwhat had happened, thinking only that the stupid messenger had\nmiscalculated his growth and had been crushed.\n\nWe emerged into a less dim area. Polter did not stop at the fallen\ngiant. Nothing mattered now to him, quite evidently, save his own exit\nwith Babs from this atomic realm. His movements seemed calm, yet\nhurried.\n\nWe realized now how different an outward journey was from the trip\ncoming in. This was all only an inch of golden quartz! The stages upward\nwere frequently only a matter of growth in size; the distances in this\nvast desert realm of golden rock always were shrinking. Polter many\ntimes stood almost motionless until the closing, dwindling walls made\nhim scramble upward into the greater space above.\n\nIt may have been an hour, or less. Babs and I, from our smaller\nviewpoint, with the landscape so frequently blurred by distance and\nPolter's movements, seldom recognized where we were. But I realized\ngoing out was far easier in every way than coming in. Easier to\ndetermine the route, since usually the diminishing caverns and gullies\nmade the upward step obvious.... We knew when Polter scrambled up the\nincline ramp.\n\nIt seemed impossible for us to plan anything. Would Polter make the\nentire trip without a stop? It seemed so. We had no drugs, and our cage\nwas barred beyond possibility of our getting out. But even if we had had\nthe drugs, or had our door been open, there was no escape. An abyss of\ndistance was always yawning beyond our lattice--the sheer precipice of\nPolter's body from his chest to the ground.\n\n\"Babs, we must make him stop. It he sits down to rest you might get him\nto take you out. I must reach his drugs.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll try it, George.\"\n\nPolter was momentarily standing motionless as though gazing around him,\njudging what to do next. His size seemed stationary. Beyond our bars we\ncould see the distant circular walls as though this were some giant\ncrater-pit in which Polter was standing. Then I thought I recognized\nit--the round, nearly vertical pit into which Alan had plunged his hand\nand arm. Above us then was a gully, blind at one end. And above that,\nthe outer surface, the summit of the fragment of golden quartz.\n\n\"Babs, I know where we are! If he takes you out, keep his attention.\nI'll try and get one of his black vials. Make him hold you near the\nground. If I see you there, in position where you can jump, I'll startle\nhim. Babs it's desperately dangerous but I can't think of anything else.\nJump. Get away from him. I'll keep his attention on me. Then I'll join\nyou if I can--with the drug.\"\n\nPolter was moving. We had no time to say more.\n\n\"I'll try it, George.\" For just an instant she clung to me with her soft\narms about my neck. Our love was sweeping us in this desperate moment,\nand it seemed that above us was a remote Earth world holding the promise\nof all our dreams. Or were we cross-starred, doomed like the realm of\nthe atom? Was this swift embrace now marking the end of everything for\nus?\n\nBabs called, \"Dr. Polter?\"\n\nWe could feel his movements stopping.\n\n\"Yes? You are all right, Babs?\"\n\nShe laughed--a ripple of silvery laughter--but there was tragic fear in\nher eyes as she gazed at me. \"Yes, Dr. Polter, but breathless. Almost\ndead, but not quite. What happened? I want to come out and talk to you.\"\n\n\"Not now, little bird.\"\n\n\"But I want to.\" To me it was a miracle that she could call so lightly\nand hold that note of lugubrious laughter in her voice. \"I'm hungry.\nDidn't you think of that? And frightened. Take me out.\"\n\nHe was sitting down! \"You remind me that I am tired, Babs. And hungry,\nalso. I haf a little food. You shall come out for just a short time.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Take me carefully.\"\n\nOur tilted cage was near the ground as he seated himself. But it was\nstill too far for me to jump.\n\nI murmured, \"Babs it's not close enough to the ground.\"\n\n\"Wait, George, I'll fix that. You hide! If he looks in he'll see you.\"\n\nI scrambled back to my hiding place. Polter's huge fingers were fumbling\nat our bars. The little door sprang open.\n\n\"Come, Babs.\"\n\nHe held the cupped bowl of his hand to the doorway. \"Come out.\"\n\n\"No!\" she called. \"It is too far down!\"\n\n\"Come. That iss foolish.\"\n\n\"No! I'm afraid. Put the cage on the ground.\"\n\n\"Babs!\" His finger and thumb came reaching in to seize her, but she\navoided them.\n\n\"Dr. Polter! Don't! You'll crush me!\"\n\n\"Then come out on my hand.\"\n\nHe seemed annoyed. I had scrambled back to the doorway; I knew he\ncouldn't see me so long as the cage remained strapped to his shirt\nfront.\n\nI whispered, \"I can make it, Babs!\"\n\nPolter was apparently on one elbow now, half turned to one side. From\nour cage, the sloping gleaming white surface of his stiff glossy shirt\nbosom went down a steep incline. His belt was down there, and the\noutward bulging curve of his lap--a spreading surface where I could land\nlike a scuttling insect, unobserved, if only Babs could hold his\nattention.\n\nI whispered vehemently, \"Try it! Go out! Leave me--keep talking to him!\"\n\nShe called instantly, \"All right, then. Bring your hand! Closer!\nCarefully! It seems so high up here!\"\n\nShe swung herself into his palm, and flung her arms about the great\npillar of his crooked finger. The bowl of his hand moved slowly away. I\nheard her faint voice, and his overhead rumble.\n\nI chanced it! I didn't know his exact position or which way he was\nlooking.\n\nAgain I heard Bab's voice. \"Careful, Dr. Polter. Don't let me fall!\"\n\n\"Yes, little bird.\"\n\nI let myself down from the tilted doorway, hung by my hand and dropped.\nI struck the ramp-like yielding surface of his shirt bosom. I slid,\ntumbling, scrambling, and landed softly in the huge folds of his trouser\nfabric. I was unhurt. The width of his belt, high as my body, was near\nme. I shrank against it. I found I could cling to its upper edge.\n\nMy hold came just in time. He shifted and sat up. I was lifted with a\nswoop of movement. When it steadied I saw above me the top of his knee.\nHis left leg was crooked, the foot drawn close to him. Babs was perched\nup there on the knee summit. His right leg was outstretched. I was at\nthe right side of his belt. I could dart off along that curving expanse\nof his leg and leap to the ground. If he would hold this position! One\nof the pouches of his belt was near me. The vial in it was black. The\nenlarging drug! I moved toward it.\n\nBut Babs was too high to jump from that summit of his crooked knee! I\nthink she saw me at his belt. I heard her voice.\n\n\"I cannot eat up here. It is too high. Oh, please be careful how you\nmove! I am so dizzy, so frightened! You move with such great jerks!\"\n\nHe had what seemed a huge surface of bread and meat. He was breaking off\ncrumbs to put before her. I reached the pouch of his belt. The vial was\nas long as my body. I tugged to try and lift it out.\n\nAll the giant contours of Polter's body shifted as he cautiously moved.\nI clung. I saw that Babs was being held gently between his thumb and\nforefinger. He lowered her to the ground, and she stood beside the bread\nand the meat he had placed there.\n\nAnd she had the courage to laugh! \"Why this--this is an enormous\nsandwich! You will have to break it.\"\n\nHe was leaning over her, half turned on his side. The vial came free. I\nshoved it; but I could not control its weight. I pushed desperately. It\nslid over the round brink of his right hip, and fell behind him. I heard\nthe tinkling thud of it down on the rocks.\n\nThere was no alarm. I could not chance leaping from his hip. I scurried\nalong the convex top of his outstretched leg, and beyond his knee I\njumped.\n\nI landed safely. I could see the black vial back across the broken rock\nsurface, with the bulge of Polter's hip above it. I ran back and reached\nthe vial, tugged at its huge stopper. The cork began to yield under my\npanting, desperate efforts. In a moment I would have a pellet of the\nenlarging drug; make away with it and startle Polter so that Babs might\ndart off and escape.\n\nThe huge stopper of the vial was larger than my head. It came suddenly\nout. I flung it away, plunged in my hand, and seized an enormous round\npellet.\n\nThen abruptly the alarm came, and I had not caused it! Polter ripped out\na startled, rumbling curse and sat upright. Under the curve of his leg\nI saw Babs had been momentarily neglected. She was running.\n\nAcross the boulder-strewn plain, two tiny men had appeared. Polter had\nseen them.\n\nThey were the enlarging figures of Dr. Kent and Alan!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nThe astounded Polter was taken wholly by surprise. He had no idea that\nanyone was following him. He thought he was alone with tiny Babs in this\nrock-strewn metal desert. What he saw as he scrambled to his feet were\nfour insect-size humans, two of them at a distance, and two within reach\nof him, and all of them scampering in different directions. The ground\nwas littered with crags and boulders; it was ridged and pitted,\npock-marked, with tiny crater-holes and caves. The four scuttling\nfigures almost instantly had disappeared from his sight.\n\nI did not see where Babs went. I turned from the black vial of Polter's\nenlarging drug, and with the huge pellet under my arm I ran leaping over\nthe rough ground and flung myself into a gully. I lay prone, flattened\nagainst a rock. In the murky distance of a pseudo-sky overhead, the\nmonstrous head and shoulders of Polter were visible. I could see down to\njust below his waist. The empty cage with its door flapping open hung\nagainst his shirt-front. He had stooped to try and recover Babs. And\ninstinctively his hands went to his belt to seize his enlarging drug.\n\nThey were fumbling there now. He hauled out an opalescent vial of the\ndiminishing element. But his black vial was gone. His annoyance turned\ninto fear as he searched for it in the other compartments of his belt. I\nhad thought that he had more than one black vial, but now it seemed not.\nHis huge face was swept with the panic of terror. He glanced wildly\naround him.\n\nThrough the open end of my gully I saw in the distance, miles away, the\nenlarging figure of Alan rising up. Then it ducked in back of a distant\nrising peak. Polter undoubtedly saw it. He was fumbling with his\nopalescent vial. In his confused panic he made the mistake of taking the\ndiminishing drug and instantly seemed to regret it. His curse rumbled\nabove me. His glance went down to the rocks at his feet, and there he\nsaw his black vial lying with its stopper out. His body already was\nbeginning to dwindle. He stooped, seized the vial, and took the\nenlarging drug. The shock of it mode him stagger; momentarily he\ndisappeared from my line of vision but I could hear his panting breath\nand the unsteady pound of his footsteps.\n\nI still held that huge round ball of the drug. I seized a loose stone\nand frantically knocked off a chunk-heaven knows how much. I shoved it\ninto my mouth, chewed and hastily swallowed it. And with the lurching,\nswaying, shrinking gully closing in upon me, I ran to get out of its\ndistant end.\n\nI was heading toward where Alan and his father were hiding. I came from\nthe gully into the open, just as the walls closed behind me. The whole\nscene was a dizzying, blurred sway of contracting movement. I saw that I\nwas in a circular valley now some five miles in diameter, with its\njagged enclosing walls rising sheerly perpendicular out of sight in the\nhaze overhead.\n\nPolter had staggered backward. I saw him a mile or so away. His back at\nthat instant was turned to me. He was now no more than three or four\ntimes my own height. He scrambled against the valley cliff wall as\nthough trying to find a foothold to climb up it. He went a little way,\nbut fell back.\n\nNear me, Alan and old Dr. Kent suddenly appeared. I was larger than\nthey. Alan gasped with surprise.\n\n\"You, George! You got Babs--\"\n\n\"Yes--Babs is around somewhere! Stay down here! Don't lose her in size!\nStay small! Search and--\"\n\n\"But, George--\"\n\n\"I'll tackle Polter. I've taken--God, I don't know how much I've taken\nof the drug!\"\n\nThey were shrinking down by my boot tops. Alan shouted suddenly,\n\"There's Babs! Thank God, she's all right.\"\n\nShe was so small that I couldn't see her, or even hear her, though she\nmust have been calling to them. Alan again screamed up at me with his\nlittle voice:\n\n\"She's here, George! You--go on and get Polter! I can't overtake\nyou--haven't enough of the drug!\" His tiny voice was fading away. \"Go\nand get him, George! This time--get him--\"\n\nI swung with a staggering step around to face the open valley. It had by\nnow shrunk to nearly half a mile in width. Its smooth walls rose some\ntwo or three thousand feet to an upper circular horizon with murky\ndistance overhead. Polter stood across from me. He had tried to climb\nout but could not. He saw me and came lurching. We were a quarter of a\nmile from each other. I ran forward through a shifting scene of\nshrinking rock walls and crawling, contracting ground. Quarter of a\nmile? It seemed hardly more than a score of running strides before\nPolter loomed close ahead of me. He was still nearly twice my size. I\nstooped, seized a loose boulder, and flung it. I missed his face, but,\nas his hand went up carrying a bare knife, by fortunate chance, the\nstone struck his wrist. The knife dropped to the rocks. He stooped to\nrecover it, but I was upon him. As I felt his huge arms go about me,\nhalf lifting me, my foot struck the knife. But in an instant it was\nswept down into smallness beneath us as we expanded above it.\n\nBoth of us now were unarmed in this combat of size. I was an immature\nyouth in Polter's first grip upon me. I heard his panting words, grimly\ntriumphant:\n\n\"This--George Randolph, I haf been--waiting for so many years! The\nhunchback--takes his revenge--now--\"\n\nHe lifted me. His great arms were unbelievably powerful, but I could\nfeel them dwindling. I was enlarging faster. Just a few moments--if I\ncould last a few moments.... My feet were off the ground, my chest\npressed close against the little cage between us. He had a hand shoving\nback my head; his fingers sought my throat. I wound my legs around him,\nand then he tried to throw me down and fall upon me. But he had twisted\nand my back was against the cliff. The rocks were shoving at us,\ninsistently pushing with almost a living movement. Polter staggered with\nme. His grip on my throat tightened, shutting off my breath. My senses\nwhirled. His grim sardonic face over me became blurred. I tore futilely\nat my throat to break his choking grip. All the world was a roaring\nchaos to my fading senses. Then in the blur I saw horror sweep his\nexpression. His fingers involuntarily loosened. I got a breath of\nblessed air, gasping, and my sight cleared.\n\nWalls were closing around us! We were in a pit barely ten feet wide,\nwith the top a few feet above Polter's head. The nearer wall shoved us\nagain. Our bodies almost filled the shrinking pit! Polter lurched and\ncast me off. I half fell, striking my shoulder against the opposite\nwall, and I saw Polter leap at the dwindling brink and scramble out.\n\nI was nearly wedged. As I rose, the top of the pit only reached my\nwaist. Polter had fallen on the upper ground, and was on hands and\nknees. Instead of standing up, he lurched at me trying to shove me back.\nBut I was out; I clutched at him. We were almost of a size now. We\nrolled on the ground, locked together; rolled to the brink of the pit\nand over it, as it shrank to a little round hole unnoticed beneath our\nthreshing bodies!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the side of the circular valley Alan and Dr. Kent crouched with the\nsmaller figure of Babs between them. They saw Polter and me as two\nswaying gigantic forms locked in a death struggle, towering against the\nsky. Tremendous expanded bodies! They saw us come to grips; saw the\ngreat hunched Polter bend me backward, choking me.\n\nOur bodies lurched. Our huge legs with a single step brought us to the\ncenter of the valley. It was a shrinking valley to Alan, Babs and Dr.\nKent, for they too, were enlarging. But the fighting giant figures were\ngrowing faster. In only a moment their shoulders were up there in the\nsky, pressing against the narrowing cliff walls.\n\nAlan gasped, \"But George will be crushed! Look at him!\"\n\nHorror swept them as they crouched, watching. The enormous pillars of\nPolter's legs towered straight up from near at hand. Alan was aware of\nhimself screaming:\n\n\"George, get out! You're too large! Too large for in here!\"\n\nAs though his microscopic voice could reach me--my head a hundred feet\nabove him. But he screamed it again. This was all in a few horrible\nmoments, though it seemed to the three watchers an eternity. Alan was\nhelpless to aid me; they had taken all of the enlarging drug they had.\n\nThen they saw Polter cast me off. I lurched and struck, with my\nshoulders wedged against the cliff directly over where they crouched.\nThe overhead sky was darkened as Polter scrambled upward.\n\nAlan was still screaming futilely.\n\nBabs huddled with white horrified face, staring. Then I went out after\nPolter. My disappearing legs were great dark blurs in the sky. Alan saw\nthe valley now contracted to a thousand feet of width, with its cliffs\nequally as high. Then everything was smaller.... The sky overhead went\ndark again from cliff to cliff as a segment of rolling bodies\nmomentarily spanned the opening.\n\nPresently Alan realized that the valley had narrowed to a pit. He stood\nup. \"Hurry! Now we can go after them. Up there!\"\n\nThe opening above was empty. Polter and I were fighting some distance\naway....\n\nDr. Kent was soon large enough to scramble out of the pit. Alan handed\nthe little Babs up to him and followed. Alan saw that they were now in a\nlong gully, blind at one end with a five hundred foot perpendicular\ncliff. Against the wall, the Titanic form of Polter stood at bay. And I\nwas confronting him. The summit of the cliff was lower than our waists.\nTriumph swept Alan; he saw that I was the larger! As Polter bored into\nme my backward step crossed the full width of the gully. Alan shouted:\n\n\"Down! Babs--Father!\"\n\nThey had barely time to flatten themselves in a narrow crevice between\nupstanding rocks before my foot crashed down. For an instant the sole of\nmy foot formed a flat black ceiling as it spanned the rocks. Then it\nlifted and was gone with a blurred swoop. They saw the white blur of my\nhand come down and snatch a tremendous boulder, raising it with a great\nsweep of movement into the sky. They saw me crash it against Polter; but\nit only struck his shoulder. He roared with anger. The whole sky was\nroaring and rumbling with our shouts and our panting breathing, and the\nground was clattering, pounding with our giant tread. Huge loose\nboulders were tumbled in an avalanche everywhere.\n\nAgain it seemed to Alan that our lurching, heedlessly surging bodies\nmust be crushed within these contracting walls. Only our locked,\nintertwined legs were visible; our bodies were lost in the sky. Then it\nseemed to Alan that I had heaved Polter upward. And followed him. We\ndisappeared. There was a distant overhead rumble, and the murky sky,\nwith vague patches of far-distant illumination in it, became empty of\nmovement....\n\nThe walls presently were again closing upon Alan and his companions.\nThey ran out of the open end of the shrinking little gully and came to a\nnew upward vista....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found myself a full head and shoulders taller than Polter. And he was\ntiring, panting heavily. His face was cut and bleeding from the blows of\nmy fist. The rock I heaved struck his shoulder. He roared, head down,\nand bored into me. He was heavier than I. His weight flung me back. My\nfoot slid on the loose stones of the gully floor. I did not know that\nBabs, Alan and their father were huddled under those stones!\n\nMy back struck the opposite wall. Polter's upflung knee caught me in the\nstomach, all but knocking the breath out of me. He was desperate,\noblivious to the closing walls. And as he flung his arms with a grip\nabout my neck, hanging, trying to bear down, I saw in his blazing dark\neyes what seemed the light of suicide. I think that then, with a sudden\nfrenzied madness he realized that he was beaten, and tried to pull us to\nthe ground and let the walls crush us.\n\nI summoned all my remaining strength and heaved us forward. I broke his\nhold. His body was jammed back against a lowering wall. Its top seemed\nalmost at our knees. I shoved frantically. He fell backward and I jumped\nafter him.\n\nWe were on a great rocky plateau. But it was shrinking, crawling into\nitself. Spots of light were in the murk overhead: there seemed a\ndistant circular horizon of emptiness around us.\n\nPolter was lying in a heap. But it was trickery, for as I incautiously\nbent over him his hand crashed a rock against my head. I reeled, with\nall the world turning black, but didn't fall. There was a terrible\ninstant when my senses were going, but I fought to hold them. Blood from\na wound on my forehead was streaming in my eyes. I was staggering. Then\nI realized that I was grimly tossing my head, shaking the blood away;\nand little by little my sight came back.\n\nPolter was on his feet, rushing me. His fist came with an upward swing\nat my chin, but I ducked.\n\nAnd suddenly, fighting up there in the open, my mind envisioned how\ngigantic we were! This was a great upland plateau, rounded with miles of\ndistance and shadowy dimly radiant abyss beyond its circular horizon.\nAnd I was a thousand feet or more tall! A Titan, looming here in the\nsky!\n\nMy fist quite unexpectedly caught Polter's jaw. His simultaneous swing\nwent wild, as I leapt backward from it. He staggered, and his arms\ndropped to his sides. I was crouched forward, guarded, watching him\nwhile I gasped for breath. There was the briefest of instant when an\nexpression of vague surprise swept his face. But I had not knocked him\nout.\n\nIt was death overtaking him. His heart was yielding, overtaxed from the\nstrain; and I think that there, at the last, he realized it. The blood\ndrained suddenly from his face and lips, leaving them livid. I saw fear,\nthen a wild horror in his eyes. He stood swaying. Then his knees gave\nway and he toppled. He fell from his height in the air where I stood\ngazing at him--fell forward on his face, his Titanic length spread all\nacross the top of this rocky landscape!\n\nFor a moment I did not move. My head was reeling, my ears roaring.\nBlood streamed into my eyes. I wiped it away with a torn sleeve and\nstood panting, gazing at the glowing distance around me.\n\nI was a Titan, standing there. The body of Polter was shrinking at my\nfeet. The circular abyss of emptiness came nearer as this rocky eminence\ncontracted.\n\nSuddenly my attention went to the sky overhead. Vague distant lights\nwere there. Then a broad flat blur seemed spread over me. Light\neverywhere was growing. Beyond the nearby brink of the abyss was a white\nreflected radiance from beneath. Abruptly I realized there was a level,\nflat white plain running far off there in the distance.\n\nOverhead a radiance contracted into a spot of light. A shape in the sky\nmoved! I heard a faraway rumble--a human voice!\n\nThe body of Polter lay at my feet. It was hardly the length of my\nforearm. I stood, a Titan.\n\nAnd then, with a shock of realization, I saw how tiny I was! This was\nthe broken top of that fragment of golden quartz the size of a walnut! I\nwas standing there, under the lens of the giant microscope in Polter's\ndome-room laboratory, with half a dozen astounded Quebec police\nofficials peering down at me!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nI need not detail the aftermath of our emergence from the atom. Dr. Kent\nand Babs followed me out within a few moments. But Alan was not with\nthem! He had seen Polter fall. His father and Babs were safe. The\nsacrifice he had made in leaving Glora was no longer needed.\n\nDown there on the rocky plateau, Dr. Kent suddenly realized that Alan\nwas dwindling.\n\n\"Father, I have to! Don't you understand? Glora's world is menaced. I\ncan't leave her like this. My duty to you and Babs is ended. I did my\nbest. You two are safe now.\"\n\n\"Alan! You can't go!\"\n\nHe was already down at Dr. Kent's waist, Babs' size. He held up his\nhand. \"Dad, don't try to stop me. Good-bye.\" His rugged youthful face\nwas flushed, his voice choked. \"You--you've been a mighty good father to\nme. Always.\"\n\nBabs flung her arms about him. \"Alan. Don't!\"\n\n\"But I must.\" He smiled whimsically as he kissed her. \"You wouldn't want\nto leave George, would you? Never see him again? I'm not asking you to\ndo that, am I?\"\n\n\"But, Alan--\"\n\n\"You've been a great little pal, Babs. But I have to go.\"\n\n\"Alan! You talk as though you were never coming back!\"\n\n\"Do I? But of course I'm coming back!\" He cast her off. \"Babs, listen.\nFather's upset. That's natural. You tell him not to worry. I'll be\ncareful, and do what I can to save that little city. I must find Glora\nand--\"\n\nBabs was suddenly trembling with eagerness for him. \"Yes! Of course you\nmust, Alan!\"\n\n\"I'll find her and bring her out here! I'll do it! Don't you worry.\" He\nwas dwindling fast. Dr. Kent had collapsed to a rock, staring down with\nhorror-stricken eyes. Alan called up to Babs:\n\n\"Listen! Have George watch the chunk of gold quartz. Have it guarded and\nwatched day and night. Handle it carefully, Babs!\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! How long will you be gone, Alan?\"\n\n\"How do I know? But I'll come back--don't worry. Maybe in only a day or\ntwo of your time.\"\n\n\"Right! Good-bye, Alan!\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" his tiny voice echoed up.\n\nBabs could see his miniature face smiling up at her. She smiled back and\nwaved her arm as he vanished into the pebbles at her feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt has broken Dr. Kent. A month now has passed. He seldom mentions Alan\nto Babs and me. But when he does, he tries to smile and say that Alan\nsoon will return. He has been very ill this last week, though he is\nbetter now. He did not tell us that he was working to compound another\nsupply of the drugs, but we knew it very well.\n\nAnd his emotion, the strain of it, made him break. He was in bed a week.\nWe are living in New York, quite near the Museum of the American Society\nfor Scientific Research. In a room of the biological department there,\nthe precious fragment of golden quartz lies guarded. A microscope is\nover it, and there is never a moment of the day or night without an\nalert, keen-eyed watcher peering down.\n\nBut nothing has appeared. Neither friend or foe--nothing. I cannot say\nso to Babs, but often I fear that Dr. Kent will suddenly die, and the\nsecret of his drugs die with him. I hinted that I would make a trip into\nthe atom if he would let me, but it excited him so greatly I had to\nlaugh it off with the assurance that of course Alan would soon return\nsafely to us. Dr. Kent is an old man now, unnaturally old, with, it\nseems, the full weight of eighty years pressing upon him. He cannot\nstand this emotion. I think he is despairingly summoning strength to\nwork upon his drugs, fearful that at any moment, he will not be equal to\nit. Yet more fearful to disclose the secret and unloose such a diabolic\npower.\n\nThere are nights when with Dr. Kent asleep, Babs and I slip away and go\nto the Museum. We dismiss the guard for a time, and in that private room\nwe sit by the microscope to watch. The fragment of golden quartz lies on\nits clean white slab with a brilliant light upon it.\n\nMysterious little golden rock! What secrets are there, down beyond the\nvanishing point in the realm of the infinitely small? Our human longings\ngo to Alan and Glora.\n\nBut sometimes we are swept by the greater viewpoint. Awed by the\nmysteries of nature, we realize how very small and unimportant we are in\nthe vast scheme of things. We envisage the infinite reaches of\nastronomical space overhead. Realms of largeness unfathomable. And at\nour feet, everywhere, a myriad entrances into the infinitely small. With\nourselves in between--with our fatuous human consciousness that we are\nof some importance to it all!\n\nTruly there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in\nour philosophy!\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis etext was first published in _Astounding Stories_ March 1931.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
