I had to get in touch with\nsomebody about this because if there is something to it, then somebody,\neverybody, is going to point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, \"Why\ndidn't you warn us?\"\n\nI could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to\nme because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums. Also they\nmight think I was on booze, too, or maybe the hops, and get my license\nrevoked. I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests\nmight be down on their luck now and then.\n\nWhat really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of\ntwo of my guests. They both took a powder last Wednesday morning.\n\nNow get this. In one room, that of Joe Binkle, which maybe is an alias,\nI find nothing but a suit of clothes, some butts and the letters I\ninclude here in same package. Binkle had only one suit. That I know.\nAnd this was it laying right in the middle of the room. Inside the\ncoat was the vest, inside the vest the shirt, inside the shirt the\nunderwear. The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also\nthe underwear. All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of\nit and dripped through a crack in the floor. In a bureau drawer were\nthe letters I told you about.\n\nNow. In the room right under Binkle's lived another stew bum that\nchecked in Thursday ... name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. This guy was a\nreal case. He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame.\nAirloom, he says. He pays a week in advance, staggers up the stairs to\nhis room with the mirror and that's the last I see of him.\n\nIn Smith's room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes, the same\nsuit he wore when he came in. In the coat the vest, in the vest the\nshirt, in the shirt the underwear. Also in the pants. Also all in the\nmiddle of the floor. Against the far wall stands the frame of the\nmirror. Only the frame!\n\nWhat a spot to be in! Now it might have been a gag. Sometimes these\nguys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff. But then I read\nthe letters. This knocks me for a loop. They are all in different\nhandwritings. All from different places. Stamps all legit, my kid says.\nIndia, China, England, everywhere.\n\nMy kid, he reads. He says it's no joke. He wants to call the cops or\nmaybe some doctor. But I say no. He reads your magazine so he says\nwrite to you, send you the letters. You know what to do. Now you have\nthem. Maybe you print. Whatever you do, Mr. Editor, remember my place,\nthe Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don't drink. I never\ntouch junk, not even aspirin.\n\n    Yours very truly,\n    Ivan Smernda\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Bombay, India\n    June 8\n\n    Mr. Joe Binkle\n    Plaza Ritz Arms\n    New York City\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nGreetings, greetings, greetings. Hold firm in your wretched projection,\nfor tomorrow you will not be alone in the not-world. In two days I,\nGlmpauszn, will be born.\n\nToday I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirror\ngateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such\ntremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus\nwithin the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am static\nand for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe\nwith fear and trepidation.\n\nAs soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got\nno response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate\nwave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and\nreturning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing\nand surrounded with an impregnable chimera.\n\nQuickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the\nnot-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what\nthe not-world calls \"mail\" till we meet. For this purpose I must\nutilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose\ninadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.\nEach time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.\n\nI, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary\nreports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury\nof facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free\nof the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in\nyour task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we\nreturn again.\n\nThe hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of\nBombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.\nTomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact\nlocation, for the not-people might have access to the information.\n\nI must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it\nis alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from\nthe pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational\nlikeness.\n\nI have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among\nthem. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway\nlies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in\norder that I might destroy the not-people completely.\n\nAll is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too\nfast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.\nGezsltrysk, what a task!\n\nFarewell till later.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Wichita, Kansas\n    June 13\n\nDear Joe:\n\n\nMnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you,\nI see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are\nno terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in\nnot-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my\nbirth.\n\nNow I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited\nequipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor\ncame in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation\nreigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What\ndifference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.\nAs they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,\nsince I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother\n(Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up\ntheir hands and left.\n\nI learned the following day that the opposite component of my\nnot-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance\nduring my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a\nbender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.\n\nWhen I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I\nmade a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36\nnot-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was\nstanding by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.\nHe stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of\nspeech.\n\nDredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I\nproduced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.\n\n\"Poppa,\" I said.\n\nThis was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that\nare now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded\nlow-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have\njarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the\nroom.\n\nThey apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something\nabout my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at\nthe doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,\nshe fell down heavily. She made a distinct _thump_ on the floor.\n\nThis brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window\nand retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,\nbut I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!\n\nI reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the\ncleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply\nfrom Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise\nindeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.\nBut you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself\nand it's his nature never to flatter anyone.\n\nFrom now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the\nqualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this\nalleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive\nmythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people\nrefer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we\nlearned otherwise, while they never have.\n\nNew sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the\ninevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of\nthe not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand your\nnot replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What could\nhave happened to your vibrations?\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Albuquerque, New Mexico\n    June 15\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nI had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time.\nMy process--original with myself, by the way--is to send out feeler\nvibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I\nestablish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his\nknowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my\nletter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he\nhas done.\n\nMy first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an\nindividual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but\nI fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell\nyou about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have\naccomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.\n\nIn simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of\nsleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out.\nAnyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.\n\nAs I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ...\nmy brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard\ntime classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire\nthe stuff needed for the destruction of these people.\n\nSunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the\nimpressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning\nfor me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient\nmechanism I inhabit.\n\nI gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions.\nIt was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried\nimmediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up\nand all about me at the beauty.\n\nSoon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I\nsimply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was\nto realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not\nlet yourself believe they do.\n\nThis individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here.\nHer hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She\nwore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was\ndiverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.\n\nThe woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from\nnearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with\nan attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told\nmyself. But they were.\n\nI became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you\nunfortunately do not have--invisibility. I lay there and listened.\n\n\"He was stark naked,\" the girl with the sneakers said.\n\nA figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.\n\n\"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of\nthis area.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,\" the officer ordered. \"No more speeches\nin the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now\nwhere is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.\"\n\nThat was it--I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this\noversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions\nthat assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty,\npain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I\nmust feel each, become accustomed to it.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I\nhave been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe.\nWhat will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is\nimpaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write\nyou with more enlightenment.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Moscow, Idaho\n    June 17\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nI received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greet\nme in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,\npride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five\nbucks!\n\nIt took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with\nthe correct variant of the slang term \"buck.\" Is it possible that you\nare powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in\nthis inferior world?\n\nA reminder, please. You and I--I in particular--are now engaged in\na struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions\nof this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived\na semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world\nripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual\nfluctuations make up our sentient population.\n\nEven our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized\nby these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets\nas you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the\ngreatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides\nare joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational\nplane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world\nof higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.\nWhile we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,\nmore stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.\n\nThey even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves\ninto ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force\nsome of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,\ncausing them much agony and fright.\n\nThe latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call\nmediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one\nof them at the first opportunity to see for myself.\n\nMeanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked\nthem up while examining the \"slang\" portion of my information catalog\nwhich you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate\ncause--in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace\nof our world--shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,\nget hep.\n\nAs far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Des Moines, Iowa\n    June 19\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nYour letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages\nin my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.\nBiological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here\n\"revolting\" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are\nall being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most\nimportant part of my journey--completion of the weapon against the\nnot-worlders--I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that\nday, I assure you.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Boise, Idaho\n    July 15\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nA great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last.\nSystematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in\nour catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed\nbending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent\nindeed. Ah! You'll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known\nquaintly in this tongue as a \"hooker of red-eye.\" Ha! I've mastered\neven the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me\nagain. I feel much better now.\n\nYou see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that\nconstantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to\nreact exactly as our information catalog instructed me to.\n\nNow it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am\nburned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,\nI experience a tickle.\n\nThis morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group\nof symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me\nagain. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely\nenough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world\ncame most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing\nhere, both among those who haven't got it and those who have.\n\nI went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and\ncarried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money\nto a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best\nhotel here in--no, sorry--and stared at it for hours.\n\nNothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the other\nabout it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for\nthe love of it.\n\nAnyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or\nfifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare\nrooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I have\nfailed. This alcohol is taking effect now.\n\nBlgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports!\nI've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've been\nstudying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of\nthese people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these\npeople as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there\ndo homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.\n\nLove. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.\n\nBy the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won't\ncost me anything. It'll come out of the pocket of the idiot who's\nwriting this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?\n\nI'm going out and look at that money again. I think I'm at last\nlearning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, one\nsimply must persevere, I always say.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Penobscot, Maine\n    July 20\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nNow you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it\nin any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across\nto this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a\nquart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel\nwonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.\n\nThere are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this\nbody and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now\nI can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today\noutlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must\nfinally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments\nyet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of\nthe inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his\nvibrations.\n\nI went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a\nblonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was\nattracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is\nperfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.\n\nI didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember\ndistinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I\nhad dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.\nWe went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you\nbelieve it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the\nmoney in her bare feet! Then we kissed.\n\nConcealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve\nends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these\nimpulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the\nadrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the\nentire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.\n\nI sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the\ntingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself\nquickly.\n\nNow in all the motion pictures--true representations of life and love\nin this world--the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl\nand tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.\nThis pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,\nwanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would\nhave a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?\n\nI kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.\nWell, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I\nhad not found love.\n\nI became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell\nasleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin\nand didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.\n\nI am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don't\nI wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?\nI'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a\ngin mixture.\n\nI think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'll\ntake him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting up\nan atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do\nis activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.\n\nBoy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe,\nyou old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off the\nfat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Sacramento, Calif.\n    July 25\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nAll is lost unless we work swiftly. I received your revealing letter\nthe morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a\nlot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance\nthings.\n\nSomewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got\nto the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and\ncontinued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again\nbecause she said yes immediately.\n\nThe nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the\nmost frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these\npeople really are to our world.\n\nThe medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong\npsychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I\nwas too busy with the redhead to notice.\n\nAnyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal\ngrandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He\nconcentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in\nthe room. The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white,\nshapeless cascade of light.\n\nMrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, \"Grandma Lucy!\" Then I\nreally took notice.\n\nGrandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury\npartially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in\nthe fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku\nwas open and his btgrimms were down.\n\nWorst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable\npattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the\nredhead.\n\nThen comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a\nresult of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these\nnot-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality\nof not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now. The day is only\nhalf over and I have consumed a quart and a half. And it is dulling all\nmy powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can't even become\ninvisible any more.\n\nI must find the formula that will wipe out the not-world men quickly.\n\nQuickly!\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Florence, Italy\n    September 10\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nThis telepathic control becomes more difficult every time. I must pick\ncloser points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but\nfailure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula\nthat is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were\nfilled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n\nI had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\nrealized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\nthat inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\nimmediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\naware of the nature of my activities.\n\nI moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\nstuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\ninto the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\nI was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\ncustomer.\n\n\"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n\nI was baffled. What could I tell him?\n\n\"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n\n\"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're--they're--\"\n\n\"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\"They're not safe.\"\n\n\"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\n\nAt this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\n\n\"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n\nHe stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\nAnother day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like\nthe not-men, curse them.\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Rochester, New York\n    September 25\n\n\nDear Joe:\n\nI have it! It is done! In spite of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury's\nniggling criticism, I have succeeded. I now have developed a form\nof mold, somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world, that,\ntransmitted to the human organism, will cause a disease whose end will\nbe swift and fatal.\n\nFirst the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart.\nNothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose.\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\nWe must use care. Stock in as much gin as you are able. I will bring\nwith me all that I can. Meanwhile I must return to my original place of\nbirth into this world of horrors. There I will secure the gateway, a\nlarge mirror, the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowly\nclimb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful, now secure\nworld. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators.\n\nYou say you eat little and drink as much as you can. The same with\nme. Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight. My not-world senses\nfalter. This is the last letter. Tomorrow I come with the gateway. When\nthe gin is gone, we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live.\n\nIn only a single gleeb it will begin to work. The men of this queer\nworld will be no more. But we can't say we didn't have some fun, can\nwe, Joe?\n\nAnd just let Blgftury make one crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll have\nhgutry before the ghjdksla!\n\nGlmpauszn\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDear Editor:\n\nThese guys might be queer drunk hopheads. But if not? If soon brain\ndissolve, body fall apart, how long have we got?

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
