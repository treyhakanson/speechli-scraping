Inc._\n\n\n\n\nA Strange Awakening\n\n\nMy first sensation was one of sudden and intense cold--a chill that shot\nthrough my body and engulfed it like a charge of electricity. For a\nmoment I was conscious of nothing else. Then I knew that I was sinking\nin cold water, and that I was fighting instinctively against the need to\ngasp and breathe fresh air. I kicked weakly and convulsively. I opened\nmy eyes, and squeezed them as the bright green water stung them. Then I\nhung for an instant as if suspended over the depths, and began to rise.\nIt seemed hours before I shot up into the open air again, and was\ndrinking it deeply and thankfully into my tortured lungs. The sun\ntouched my head warmly like the hand of a benign god.\n\nFloating gently, I lay there for a long while before I even looked about\nme. There was a vague confusion in my head, as if I had just awakened\nfrom a long sleep. Some memory seemed to be fading away, something I\ncould still feel but couldn't understand. Then it was gone, and I was\nalone and empty, riding on the water.\n\nI glanced about, puzzled. Only a few yards away rose the gray stone side\nof the embankment, with its low parapet, and behind that the Drive.\nThere was no one in sight--not even a car--and the open windows of the\napartment houses across the Drive seemed very quiet. People slept behind\nthem.\n\nIt was only a little after dawn. The sun, blazing and tinted with pink,\nhad hardly risen from the horizon. The lake was still lined with dark\nshadows behind glittering ridges of morning sunlight, and a cool breeze\nplayed across my face, coming in from the east. Over the city, the sound\nof a street car rumbling into motion, rising and dying away, was like\nthe crowing of a rooster in the country.\n\nI shivered, and began to swim. A few strokes brought me to the\nembankment, and I clambered up, almost freezing as I left the water. I\nwas fully clothed, but without a hat. Perhaps I had lost it in the lake.\nI stood there, dripping and chill, and suddenly I realized that I had\njust waked up in the water. I had no recollection of falling in, nor\neven of being there. I could remember nothing of the previous night.\n\nA glance along the Drive told me where I was, at the corner of\nFifty-third street. My apartment was only a few blocks away. Had I been\nwalking in my sleep? My mind was a blank, with turbulent, dim\nimpressions moving confusedly under the surface.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTrembling in the chill air, I started up the Drive. I must go home and\nchange at once. Something came back to me--a memory of talking to some\nfriends at the Club. But was that last night? Or months ago? It was as\nthough I had slept for months. We had had a few drinks--could I have\nbeen drunk, and fallen into the lake on my way home? But I never took\nmore than two or three drinks. Something had happened.\n\nThen I remembered the stranger. We had all been sitting about the\nlounge, talking of something. What had we been discussing? Franklin had\nmentioned Einstein's new theory--we had played with that for a while,\nnone of us with the least idea what it was about. Then the conversation\nhad shifted slowly from one topic to another, all having to do with\nscientific discoveries.\n\nSomewhere in the midst of it, Barclay had come in. He brought with him a\nguest--a straight, fine-looking man with a military carriage, about\nfifty years old. Barclay had introduced him as Mr. Melbourne. He spoke\nwith a slight southern accent.\n\nIn some way Melbourne and I gravitated into a corner. We went on with\nthe conversation while the others left it. They drifted into politics,\ndrawing together about the table where the whisky stood, leaving us\nalone.\n\nMelbourne had been a fascinating man to talk to. He discussed topics\nranging from theories of matter to the early Cretan culture, and related\nthem all to one dominant scientific thread. He spoke like a man of wide\nknowledge and experience.... As I walked up the Drive, bits of his\nconversation came disjointedly back to me with the clarity and\nsignificance of sentences from Spengler.\n\nAn early-morning taxi went by slowly as I crossed the Drive to my\napartment. The driver stopped a moment, and looked at me in\nastonishment.\n\n\"What's the matter, buddy,\" he said, \"you look all wet. Fall in the\nlake?\" I smiled, embarrassed.\n\n\"Looks that way, doesn't it?\" I answered.\n\n\"Can I take you anywhere?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I live here.\" He grinned, and started off again.\n\n\"Wish I'd been in on that party!\" he called back, as he drove away.\n\nI frowned, once more with that puzzled feeling, and went in.\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne's Story\n\n\nGlimpses of last night came back to me and pieced themselves together\nslowly while I undressed and drew the water for my bath.\n\nMelbourne had been interested to know that I worked for Bausch, the\nmotion picture producer.\n\n\"Perhaps you could be of aid to me some time,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\n\"In what way, Mr. Melbourne?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I can talk to you about that later,\" he replied cryptically. \"Tell me\nabout your work.\"\n\nSo I told him the conception I had of the motion pictures to be made in\nthe future. He listened with keen interest.\n\n\"I visualize a production going beyond anything done today,\" I said,\n\"and yet one that would be possible now, if there were someone capable\nof creating it. A picture with sound and color, reproducing faithfully\nthe ordinary life about us, its tints and voices, even the noises of the\ncity--or traffic passing in the street and newsboys crying the scores of\nthe afternoon games--vividly and naturally. My picture would be so\ncarefully constructed that the projector could be stopped at any moment\nand the screen would show a scene as harmonious in design and\ncomposition and coloring, and as powerful in feeling, as a painting by\nRockwell Kent.\" After a pause I added, \"And I'd give almost anything if\nI could do it myself.\"\n\nMelbourne looked at me sympathetically, reflectively.\n\n\"It might be possible,\" he said after a time.\n\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Melbourne?\" He puffed at a cigar, and considered.\n\n\"It's not something I could explain to you off-hand,\" he said. \"It's\nstrange and it's new. It needs preparation.\"\n\n\"I'm ready to listen,\" I said with eager interest. He smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better tell you a little of my life.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I answered briefly.\n\n\"I had ideas much like yours when I was a boy,\" he began his story. \"In\nhigh school and college I had believed myself an artist. I was a good\nmusician, and I dabbled with painting and literature. I wanted to come\nback for post-graduate work, though, and something attracted me to\nscience. I had put off studying mathematics until my graduating year,\nonly to find that it fascinated me. And I was curious about physics.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"While I was studying for my Master's degree and my Doctorate, I felt\nthe need of some interest to merge all the divergent sides of my nature.\nSomething that would give me a chance to be both the artist and the man\nof science. That was a quarter of a century ago. The motion picture and\nthe phonograph were just coming into the public eye. They seemed to\nsupply just the field for which I felt a need.\n\n\"I had much the same idea as yourself, except that there were no\ndiscoveries to back it--no color photography, no method for harmonizing\nsound and sight. Indeed, neither the screen nor the phonograph had come\nto be regarded yet as essentially more than a toy. But, like yourself,\nI had vision. And enthusiasm. And an intense desire to create.\n\n\"After I had taken my degrees, I went to work with almost abnormal\nintensity. With sufficient income to live as I desired, I fitted up my\nlaboratory and concentrated on the thing I wanted to do. I spent years\nat it. I gave my youth--or, at least, the best of my youth--to that\nlabor. Long before sound and color pictures were perfected commercially,\nI had developed similar processes for myself. But they were not what I\nwanted. The real thing was beyond my grasp, and I couldn't see how to\nattain it.\n\n\"I worked feverishly. I think I must have worked myself into a sort of\nfrenzy, a sort of madness. I never mingled with people, and I became\nbitter and despondent. One day my nerves broke down. I smashed\neverything in my laboratory, all my models, all my apparatus, and I\nburned the plans and papers I had labored over for years.\n\n\"My physician told me that I must rest and recuperate. He told me I must\ninterest myself again in daily life, in people and inanimate things. So\nI went away. For the next few years I traveled. I tore myself away from\neverything scientific and plunged into the business of living. Almost\novernight I became an adventurer, tasting sensations with the same\nardor I had once given to my work. I went back to art, to painting and\nliterature and music. I was a connoisseur of wines and of foods and of\nwomen. I was an experimenter with life.\n\n\"Little by little, though, the zest of that passed away. I grew tired of\nmy dilettantism. And eventually I found that, even while I had been\nmoving about the world and experiencing its curious values, my mind had\nbeen grappling quietly, subconsciously, with my old problem. The change\nin my life had given me the wider outlook, the keener understanding\nnecessary to the accomplishment of my task. In the end, I went back to\nit again with renewed vigor. With greater power, too, and greater\nsanity.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMelbourne paused here. Sensing his need, I brought him a highball, and\none for myself. He tasted it with a quizzical expression.\n\n\"They call this whisky nowadays!\" he observed absently, with quiet\nirony. I wanted to hear the rest of his account.\n\n\"Go on with your story, sir,\" I begged him.\n\n\"The rest is simple enough--but it's the meat of the narrative. You see,\nI had to revise the way I was going about my work, and I went at it at a\nnew angle. By this time wireless telegraphy was being widely developed,\nand there were many features of it that appealed to me. With the\nknowledge I had gained during my first feverish years of experiment,\nhowever, I was able to go far beyond what has been done in recent times\nwith radio.\n\n\"I used a system differing in many respects from that of the commercial\nradio. We haven't time now to go into all that--I can tell you later,\nand it involves much that is highly technical and still secret. It is\nsufficient if I explain that my object was to evolve and fuse methods\nfor doing with each of the senses what radio does with sound.\nTelephotography was the simplest problem--the others required an almost\nsuperhuman amount of labor.\n\n\"But my biggest job was to combine them. And, to do that, I had to use\nknowledge I had gained not only in the laboratory but in my wanderings\nabout the earth--not only in the colleges and salons of Europe and\nAmerica, but in the bazaars and temples of India, Egypt, China. I had to\nunite the lore of ancient and modern civilizations, and I created a new\nfactor in electrical science. I suppose the simplest and most\nintelligible name for it would be mental telepathy. But it is more than\nthat, and basically it is as simple and material as your own motion\npictures.\"\n\nI think Melbourne would have gone on and told me more about his\ndiscoveries. At that moment, however, he paused to reflect, and we\nlooked up to find the others leaving. The bottle of Scotch was empty.\n\n\"Ready, Melbourne?\" Barclay called. We rose.\n\n\"I didn't realize it was so late,\" Melbourne answered. \"Mr. Barrett and\nI have found each other most interesting.\"\n\nWe all found our hats and went out. Melbourne and Barclay, each\napologizing for having neglected the other, said good-bye. Barclay was\ntired and wanted to go to bed. He went off with the others, but\nMelbourne turned my way.\n\n\"If you're not too weary of my company,\" he said, \"I'll go with you a\nlittle way.\"\n\n\"You know I'm not,\" I answered. \"I've never been so interested in\nanything before. It sounds like a chapter from Wells, or Jules Verne.\"\n\nHe smiled, with a little shake of his head, and we walked on for awhile\nin silence toward the lake....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll this came back to me swiftly and with an effect of incoherence, much\nas a dream moves, during the few moments when I was getting ready for my\nbath. I laid out my shaving things, and put a record on the Victrola. I\nhave never quite conquered my need for music while I bathe and dress. I\nthink the record was a Grieg nocturne--something cool and quiet, with a\ntouch of acutely sweet pain and melancholy.\n\nThen I happened to glance at a mirror for the first time. I stood amazed\nand transfixed. Overnight I had grown a beard such as wanderers bring\nback with them from the wilderness. Under the beard, my face seemed to\nhave altered somehow, to have changed in some peculiar way. Physically\nit appeared younger, with an expression of calm and repose such as I had\nnever before seen on a man's face. But the eyes were wise and old, as\nif--overnight!--the mind behind them had learned the knowledge of all\ntime.\n\nOr was it overnight? I could not lose that feeling that time had passed\nby since my last contact with ordinary life. It was as though, somewhere\nand somehow, I had lived for weeks or months in some new plane, and\nforgotten it. I felt richer and older than I had once felt, and the\nthings I had been remembering seemed remote.\n\nAt that moment, a chance strain from the machine in my living room\nbrought back a whole new group of vivid impressions, strange and yet in\na sense more familiar than my memories of Melbourne. They opened up to\nme a different life in which I seemed to have participated by chance,\nand a life which had, at first sight, no point of contact with the\nreality to which I had returned....\n\n\n\n\nA Chance Strain from Grieg\n\n\nI recalled waking up in another place, on a long slope of green hill\nthat overlooked a valley. It was dawn again. The sun was just rising\nover the crest of the hill behind me, and it threw long shadows across\nthe grass from the tall, slender trees along the summit. Down in the\nvalley a broad, clean river of clear water followed the curve of the\nhill until it disappeared from sight. There were other hills beyond the\nriver, all with the same long, simple slope of grass; and, beyond the\nhills, there were the tops of blue mountains, swathed in white morning\nmist.\n\nIt was a strange place. Its strangeness consisted in a subtle appearance\nof order and care, as though a gardener or an army of gardeners had\narranged and tended the whole vast sweep of landscape for years. It was\nuncultivated and deserted as waste land, but as well trimmed, in spite\nof its spaciousness, as a lawn.\n\nThe morning was very warm. I was not conscious of any chill in the air.\nI was clothed only in short trousers, such as athletes wear, and a short\nbelted tunic without sleeves and loose--both of them indescribably soft\nand comfortable.\n\nI was aware of the strangeness of my awakening, but I seemed to have no\ndefinite recollection of falling asleep. I felt that I had come there\nduring my sleep under unusual circumstances and from a very different\nlife, but the thought didn't disturb me or trouble my mind in any way.\nMy chief emotion was a curious feeling of expectancy. I knew that I was\nabout to have some new and curious experience, something not trivial,\nand I was eager to meet it.\n\nI lay there for awhile, drinking in the beauty of the morning, and\nbreathing an air of miraculous purity and freshness. Finally I stood up,\nlight and conscious of a sudden grace, aware for the first time, in its\ndeparture, of the awkwardness and weight which ordinarily attend our\nmovements on earth. It was as if some of the earth's gravity had been\nlost.\n\nFor a while I examined the valley, but I saw no sign of life there. Then\nI turned and went slowly up the hill, the sunlight falling warmly on my\nbody, and my feet sinking sensuously in the deep grass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I came to the crest and looked over, I saw another valley before\nme, deeper than the first. The hill rolled away, down and down for\nmiles, to a long, wide plain. More hills rose from the plain on every\nside, as simply as if they had been built there by the hand of some\ngigantic child playing in a wilderness of sand. And the river, coming\naround the base of the hill on which I was standing, but several miles\naway, swept out upon a great aqueduct of stone, hundreds of feet high,\nwhich crossed the plain through its very center, a straight line of\nbreath-taking beauty, and disappeared far away into the pass between two\nmountains. The whole scene was too perfect to be wholly natural.\n\nAt the center of the plain stood a tall, white building. Even in the\ndistance from which I viewed it, it looked massive--larger than any\nskyscraper I had ever seen. But it was delicately and intricately\ndesigned, terraced much as most modern office buildings in New York are\nterraced, but more elaborately. Its base stood about the aqueduct, which\npassed through it, and it swept up magnificently to a slender peak\nalmost level with the crest of the hill where I was standing. It was the\nonly building in sight.\n\nI don't know how long I stood there, admiring the clean sweep and\nvastness of the scene, before I saw something rise sharply, with a\nflashing of bright wings, from some hidden courtyard or terrace of the\nbuilding. It was followed closely by another and then another, like a\nflight of birds. They shot up swiftly, circled once or twice, and moved\naway in different directions, straight and purposeful. One of them came\ntoward my hill.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was only a few moments before the thing sped up to me and swooped\ndown as I waved my arms. It was, of course, a machine, slender and long,\nwith wide arching wings. It seemed almost light enough to float. It had\na deck, shielded from the wind by a shimmering transparent thing like a\nthin wire screen, and under the deck a cabin made, it seemed, of glass.\nA man and a woman stood on the deck, the woman handling the controls.\nThey were both dressed much like myself.\n\nThe machine came to rest on the hill near me. I stepped forward, and the\nman leaped down to meet me. His first greeting was curious.\n\n\"So you _are_ here,\" he said. His voice was small but cool, penetrating\nand metallic. I thought of fine steel wires. And, when I replied, my own\nvoice had something of the same quality.\n\n\"Were you expecting me?\" I said. He nodded, shaking my hand briefly and\nquietly.\n\n\"We know all about you,\" he answered. I was pleased--it made things\nsimpler--but I wanted to ask him who I was. I didn't remember anything\nup to the moment of my awakening on the other side of the hill. Instead,\nI asked him:\n\n\"Shall I go aboard?\" He nodded again, and waved his hand toward the\nladder. I went aboard lithely, and he followed. The girl and I glanced\nat each other; I was surprised and rather disturbed by her beauty and\ncleanness of body. I turned to the man, a little embarrassed, as she\nmanipulated some controls and set the ship in motion again.\n\n\"You'll have to forgive me,\" I said. \"Something has happened, and I\ndon't know things. I've completely lost my memory.\"\n\nThey understood at once.\n\n\"Your name is Baret.\" He pronounced it oddly. \"I am Edvar, and this girl\nis Selda.\" We all looked at each other intently, and I went on\nhesitantly.\n\n\"I don't know where I am. Can you tell me something about myself?\" Edvar\nshook his head.\n\n\"Only this,\" he said, \"that we were notified of your presence and your\nname. This city is Richmond.\" I glanced about quickly.\n\n\"Richmond!\" I exclaimed. \"Virginia?\" But he shook his head.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" he replied.\n\nI went on, with a puzzled frown. \"It has changed....\" Both of them\nlooked at me curiously.\n\n\"How has it changed, Baret?\" the girl, Selda, asked me. I glanced at her\nabsently and closed my eyes.\n\n\"Why ... I don't know,\" I stammered, \"I don't remember.\" For a few\nmoments there was silence, except for the shouting of the wind past our\nship. Then Selda asked me another question.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I shook my head helplessly, and answered again, \"I\ndon't know--I don't remember.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA moment later we dipped into the shadow of the building, which they\ncalled Richmond. We slipped by a succession of vast and intricate\nfa\u00e7ades until we came to a court-like terrace, hundreds of feet above\nthe ground and sheltered on three sides by walls that leaped up toward\nthe sky for hundreds of feet more. The effect of height was dizzying and\nmagnificent.\n\nSelda brought the ship to a quick and graceful landing. I found that we\nwere in a large paved court like a public square, facing the east and\nthe sun, which bathed it in cool bright light. It was still early in the\nmorning. Innumerable windows looked down upon us, and a number of\ndoorways led into the building on all sides. From one of these a girl\nstepped forward. Edvar spoke to her, evidently reporting himself and\nSelda. The girl pushed several buttons on a small cabinet which hung\nfrom her shoulder. It rang, low and silvery, twice. Then she pointed to\nme.\n\n\"Who is that?\" she asked.\n\n\"His name is Baret,\" Edvar told her. \"I was sent to meet him.\"\n\n\"But where is he from? He is not registered.\"\n\n\"We don't know. It's an unusual circumstance,\" he explained, while the\ngirl examined us all carefully. \"Very well,\" she said finally, \"you must\nattend him until he is registered. I'll notify Odom.\" Edvar nodded, and\nwe turned away.\n\nGlancing back as we crossed the court, I saw the ship descending\nnoiselessly, on the square of pavement where it had landed, into the\ndepths of the building, while the girl made other gestures with her\nlittle cabinet. Then we passed through a doorway into the subdued glow\nof artificial lighting.\n\n\"Why was she so worried?\" I asked Edvar. \"I don't understand anything,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"You were not registered,\" he said. \"We are all registered, of course,\nin our own cities. The authorities know where to find us at any moment\nof the day during our routine. If we leave the city, or depart from our\nusual program, naturally we note down where we are going, registering\nourselves upon our departure and upon our return. If we visit another\ncity, our arrival there is expected and reported here, as well as our\ndeparture.\"\n\n\"Is all that necessary?\" I asked him. \"Is there a war, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"it's customary. It prevents confusion. Everything we do\nis recorded. This conversation, for instance, is being recorded in the\ntelepathic laboratory at this moment--each of us has a record there.\nThey are open to the public at any time. It makes dishonor impossible.\"\n\nWe paused at a doorway, and Edvar spoke a word. It opened noiselessly\nand we went into his apartment.\n\n\"We are assigned to you this morning,\" Edvar said. \"We are at your\nservice.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe apartment was hardly very different from what I had unconsciously\nexpected. It seemed to have two rooms and a bath. The room we entered\nwas a sort of study. It was hung with drapes closely woven from some\nlight metal, with cold designs that were suggestive of mechanical,\nmathematic conceptions, but inspiring in much the way that the lines of\nthe building were inspiring. There were no pictures and no mirrors. All\nthe furniture was made in straight lines, of metal, and somewhat\nfuturistic in design. The chairs, however, were deep and comfortable,\nalthough the yielding upholstery appeared at first sight hard and\nbrittle as metal sheets. The room was perfectly bare, and the color\nscheme a dull silver and black. To me it seemed extremely somber, but it\npleased Edvar and his companion.\n\nThe first thing I noted when we sat down was the absence of any small\narticles--books or papers or lamps--and I remarked on this, somewhat\nrudely perhaps, to Edvar.\n\n\"Whatever you wish is accessible,\" he explained with a smile. He rose\nand went to the draped wall. Drawing back the folds of the curtains in\nseveral places, he showed the metal wall covered with dials and\napparatus. I noted especially a small screen, like a motion picture\nscreen. Later I was to find that it served not only for amusement,\nshowing sound-pictures projected automatically from a central office,\nbut also for news and for communication, like a telephone.\n\n\"Would you care for breakfast?\" Edvar asked me. I accepted eagerly, and\nhe manipulated some dials on the wall. A moment or two later a small\nsection of the wall opened, and a tray appeared. Edvar placed it on the\ntable by my chair.\n\n\"We have had our breakfast,\" he explained, and I began to eat with a\nkeener appetite than I thought I had. It was a simple meal with a\nslightly exotic flavor, but without any strange dishes. During the\ncourse of it, I asked Edvar questions.\n\n\"Your life is amazingly centralized,\" I said. \"Apparently all the things\nyou need are supplied at your rooms on a moment's notice.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he smiled, \"it makes life simpler. We have very few needs. Many\nof them are satisfied while we sleep, such as cleansing and, if we like,\nnourishment. We can study while we sleep, acquiring facts that we may\nwant to use later from an instrument which acts upon the subconscious\nmind. These dials you see are mainly to give us pleasure. If we care to\nhave our meals served in the old-fashioned way, as you are having yours,\nwe can do so, but we reserve those meals for the occasions when we feel\nthe need of eating as a pure sensation. We can have music at any time--\"\nHe paused. \"Would you care for some music?\"\n\n\"There's nothing I'd like better,\" I told him. He went to the wall and\nturned the dials again. In a moment the room was filled with the subdued\nsound of a cool, melancholy music--Grieg, or some other composer, with\nwhom I was unfamiliar, exotic and reminiscent in mood, cool, and quiet\nwith a touch of acutely sweet pain. I listened to it in silence for a\nwhile. It was so subtle and pervasive, however, that it seemed to play\ndirectly upon the subconscious mind, so that the listener could go on\nthinking and talking uninterruptedly without losing any of the feeling\nof the melody.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Have you no private possessions?\" I asked. \"Things that you share with\nno one? Your own books, your own music, your own jewelry, perhaps?\"\n\n\"We have no need of them,\" he replied. After a moment's thought, he\nadded, \"We have our own emotions, and our own work--that's all. We do\nnot care for jewels, or for decoration for its own sake. The things we\nuse and see daily are beautiful in themselves, through their perfect\nutility and their outward symbolism of utility and creation. Our tools\nand our furniture are beautiful according to our own conceptions of\nbeauty--as you can see.\" He made a gesture about the room.\n\n\"And who serves you with those meals, and the music, and the knowledge\nyou learn in your sleep? Who does the work?\"\n\n\"We all do the work. Each of us has his own work. Each of us is a\ncraftsman and a creative artist. The real work is done by machine--our\nmachines are the basic structure of our life. But we have men, highly\ntrained and fitted temperamentally for their professions, who watch and\ndirect the machines. It is a matter of a few hours a day, devoted to\nfine problems in mechanics or building or invention. The rest of our\ntime is our own, and the machines go on moving automatically as we have\ndirected them to move. If every man on earth should die this morning, it\nwould be perhaps fifty years or a century before the last machine\nstopped turning.\"\n\n\"And the rest of the time?\"\n\nIt was Selda who answered this time. \"We live. We devote ourselves to\nlearning and creative thought. We study human relations, or we wander\nthrough the forests and the mountains, increasing the breadth and\nsignificance of our minds and emotions.\" Selda's voice, rising suddenly\nafter her long silence, startled me, and I looked at her, disturbed\nagain by some subtle attraction exercised over me by her body. We were\nsilent a while, then I relapsed into my inner questionings, and turned\nto Edvar.\n\n\"You must live under a sort of socialistic system,\" I said thoughtfully.\n\"Even a sort of communism?\"\n\n\"In a sense. Rather it is an automatic life. The soul of the machine\npervades us all, and the machines are beautiful. Our lives are logically\nand inevitably directed by environment and heredity just as the\nmachines are inevitably directed by their functions and capabilities.\nWhen a child is born, we know already what he will do throughout his\nlife, how long he will live, what sort of children he will have, the\nwoman he will marry. The Bureau could tell you at this moment when my\ngreat-grandson will be born, when he will die, and what his life will do\nfor the State. There are never any accidents in our lives.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But how did you develop so highly technical a civilization?\" I asked.\n\n\"We came to it gradually from the last government system. It was called\nthe _phrenarchic system_--the rule of the mind. It was neither democracy\nnor monarchy nor dictatorship. We found that we could tell the\ntemperament and characteristics of a child from his early years, and we\ntrained certain children for government. They were given power according\nto the qualities of their minds and according to the tasks for which\nthey were fitted. We even bred them for governing. Later, when the\nmachine began to usurp the place of labor all over the world and gave\nmen freedom and peace and beauty, the task of government dwindled away\nlittle by little, and the phrenarchs turned gradually to other\noccupations.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI learned innumerable details of that life from Edvar, and occasionally\nSelda would add some fact. They are not important now. It is the\nnarrative which I must tell, not the details of a social system which,\nas I would discover later, was purely hypothetical.\n\nThe three of us spent the morning in conversation there, until the\nentrance of another man I had not seen before. He came in without\nknocking, but Edvar and Selda did not seem to be surprised. He was the\nrepresentative of the Bureau.\n\n\"You are Baret?\" he said, looking at me keenly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\n\"I have been directed to tell you that your visit here is temporary, and\nthat you will be returned to your previous life at the end of a certain\nperiod of time which we have not yet calculated precisely. You have been\nregistered with the Bureau, and you are free to come and go as you see\nfit, but you are not to interfere with anything you see. You are an\nobserver. You will be expected to comply with our methods of living as\nEdvar or Selda will explain them to you.\"\n\nWith a slight bow, he turned to go. But I detained him.\n\n\"Wait,\" I said. \"Can you tell me who I am, and where I've come from?\"\n\n\"We are not yet certain. Our knowledge of you has come to us in an\nunusual manner, through a series of new experiments now being conducted\nat the Bureau. If possible, we will explain them to you later. In any\ncase you may be assured that your absence from your usual life will not\ncause you any harm, and that you will return after a definite time. Rest\nhere, and keep your mind at peace. You will be safe.\"\n\nThen he turned and left. I was puzzled for a while, but I forgot that\nshortly in the strangeness and wonder of the life I was living in a\nstrange world....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the lake? Melbourne?\n\nThe Grieg nocturne came to an end. I frowned as I set down my razor, and\nwent into the living room to change the record. Conflicting memories ...\nwhere did they meet? On the one hand was the awakening in the cold\nwaters of the lake--only an hour or less than an hour ago. And there was\nMelbourne, and the strange conversation at the Club. Finally there was\nthis amazing and isolated recollection, like a passage from a dream.\n\nSuddenly, as I went back to my bath and plunged into the cool water, my\nmind returned to Melbourne. I had been walking home with him that night\nfrom the Club--perhaps last night. We had gone on a while in silence,\nboth of us thinking. Then we had come to the Drive. At that moment\nMelbourne had said something--what was it?\n\nHe had said, \"Tell me, Mr. Barrett, would you care to see that dream of\nyours come true?\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Chamber of Life\n\n\nI didn't know what Melbourne meant, and I looked at him inquiringly.\n\nHe explained: \"I have in my home a model--or rather a complete\ntest-apparatus. It was finished only a few days ago. I have been\npostponing my trial of it from day to day, afraid that it might be a\nfailure--although, of course, it can't be. I have verified my work\ndozens of times, step by step.\n\n\"If you care to see it, I should be glad to have you come with me. Now\nthat I have reached the end of my search, I need someone to share my\ntriumph with me.\" I glanced at him eagerly, but hardly understanding\nthat his offer was serious.\n\n\"But, Mr. Melbourne,\" I said, \"why have you chosen me--a man you've only\nmet this evening?\" He smiled.\n\n\"I am a lonely man, almost a recluse, Mr. Barrett,\" he answered. \"I have\nmany friends in many countries--but no intimates. It is the penalty of a\nman's devotion to one single and absorbing task. And, too, I think you\nshare a little of my interest in this particular task.\"\n\n\"I do, sir! It has fascinated me,\" I said.\n\n\"Then come along. I shall soon be an old man, and I will need someone to\ncarry on this work as I should carry it on. Perhaps you will be that\nman.\"\n\nA taxi was coming up the Drive at that moment. Melbourne hailed it, and\nheld the door for me to enter. Then he gave the driver an address which\nI didn't hear, and climbed in after me.\n\n\"This will be quicker,\" he said. \"After all, I am more excited about it\nmyself than I should care to admit.\"\n\nAs we turned and went on up the Drive, he told me more about his\ninvention.\n\n\"I call it the Chamber of Life,\" he said. \"It's a fantastic name, but it\ndesignates precisely what my instrument is.\n\n\"You see, it's like living another life to experience an hour or two in\nthe Chamber. You cannot possibly realize yet just what it's like. I have\ncreated a means of reproducing all the sensations that a man would have\nin actual living; all the sounds, the odors, the little feelings that\nare half-realized in daily life--everything. The Chamber takes\npossession of you and lives for you. You forget your name, your very\nexistence in this world, and you are taken bodily into a fictitious\nland. It is like actually living the books you would read today, or the\nmotion pictures and plays you would watch and hear.\n\n\"It is as real as life, but it moves swiftly as a dream. You seem to\npass through certain things slowly and completely, in the _tempo_ of\nlife. Then, when the transitional moment comes, between the scenes, your\nsensations pass with unbelievable rapidity. The Chamber has possession\nof your mind. It tells you that you are doing such and such a thing, it\ngives you all the feeling of doing that thing, and you actually believe\nyou are doing it. And when it snatches you away from one day and takes\nyou into the next, it has only to make you feel that a day has passed,\nand it is as though you had lived through that day. You could live a\nlifetime in this way, in the Chamber, without spending actually more\nthan a few hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe taxi turned a corner, leaving the Drive, and plunged into a maze of\nside streets. I didn't notice particularly where we were going, because\nI was utterly absorbed in everything Melbourne said. The city, along the\nupper part of the Drive, is filled with streets that twist and turn\ncrookedly, like New York's Greenwich Village. It has always puzzled me\nto know how the residents ever find their way home at night--especially\nwhen they are returning from parties. I suppose they manage it\nsomehow--perhaps by signs cut in the trees, like primitive Indians.\n\n\"Even after I had worked out the machine,\" Melbourne continued, \"it was\na year's job to put together a record for a thorough trial. That was a\nmatter of synchronization like your talking pictures, except that\neverything had to be synchronized--taste touch as well as sound and\nvision. And thought-processes had to be included. I had this advantage,\nhowever--that I could record everything by a process of pure\nimagination, as I shall explain later, just as everything is received\ndirectly through the mind. And I worked out a way of going back and\ncutting out the extraneous impressions. Even so, it was all amazingly\ncomplicated.\n\n\"I've gotten around the difficulties of this, my first record, by\navoiding a story of ordinary life. Indeed, what I have made is hardly a\nstory at all. You can readily see how hard it would have been to use the\nmedley of noises in traffic, or the infinite variety of subtle\ncountry-sounds. Instead, I made a story of an ideal life as I have\nvisioned it--the future, if you like, or the life on another planet.\"\n\nAt this moment we turned into a dark driveway and skirted a large lawn\nfor several hundred yards, up to Melbourne's home. It was a large\nhouse, dark at the moment, like the colonial houses you see in\nVirginia--the real ones, not the recent imitations that consist of\nlittle except the spotless white columns, which Jefferson adopted from\nthe Greeks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe went up some steps to a wide porch as the taxi drove away, and\nMelbourne unlocked the door. The hall inside was a hint of quiet, fine\nfurnishings, with the note of simplicity that marks real taste.\nMelbourne himself took my hat, and put it away meticulously with his own\nin a cloak-room at the end of the hall. Then he led me up the stairs,\ndeeply carpeted, to his study. I glanced around the study with interest,\nbut I saw nothing that could, conceivably, have been what he called the\nChamber of Life.\n\n\"It's not here, Mr. Barrett,\" he said, noticing my eagerness with a\nsmile, \"we'll go to it in a moment. I thought you might care for a\nhighball first.\" From a closet he selected a bottle of Scotch, some\nsoda, and glasses. Before he poured the whisky, he removed a small box\nfrom a cabinet, opened it, and extracted two small capsules. He dropped\none of them into each glass.\n\n\"This is a harmless drug,\" he explained. \"It will paralyze some of the\nnerves of your body so that you won't feel the chair you'll be sitting\nin nor any extraneous sensation that might interfere with the\nimpressions you must get from the instrument. It's a sort of local\nanesthetic.\" He handed me my glass.\n\nWe drank the highballs rather hastily, and rose. Melbourne went to a\ndoor at one end of the room and opened it, switching on a light.\nFollowing him, I looked past the doorway into a small room something\nlike the conception I had of the control-room in a submarine. It was a\nsmall chamber with metal walls. It had no windows, and only the one door\nthrough which we entered.\n\nAround the walls were a series of cabinets with innumerable dials,\nswitches, wires, and tiny radio tubes. It was like a glorified radio,\nbut there were no loud speakers and no ear-phones. Two very deep and\ncomfortable chairs stood side by side in the center of the room.\n\n\"The experience will be very simple,\" Melbourne said softly. \"I'm not\ngoing into any detail about this instrument until we see how it works. I\nmay as well explain, though, that the room is absolutely sound-proof, so\nthat no trace of noises outside can enter it. Furthermore, I maintain it\nat an even body temperature. These precautions are to prevent\ninterference with the sound impressions and the heat and cold stimuli\nof the instrument. That is the only reason we have to be confined here\nin this room, because it is especially adapted to the reception of these\nimpressions.\n\n\"The instrument, you see, like a radio, is operative at a distance. I am\ngoing to test you in a moment for your wavelength. When I have that, and\nset the instrument, you could receive the story, so far as I know,\nanywhere in the world. No receiving set is necessary, for it acts\ndirectly upon the brain. But you must have these ideal conditions for\npure reception.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI seated myself in one of the chairs, yawning a little. Melbourne,\nworking at the dials, noticed my yawn and observed approvingly.\n\n\"That's good. The more deadened your body is to real sensations--the\nnearer it is to sleep--the better and more vivid will be your\nimpressions.\" He pressed several buttons, and twisted a dial with\nsensitive fingers.\n\n\"Now, concentrate for a moment on the word _Venus_,\" he directed. I did\nso, and shortly I heard a faint humming which rose within the\ninstrument. Then Melbourne turned a switch with a nod of satisfaction,\nand the humming ceased.\n\n\"That gave me your wavelength,\" he explained. \"I have set it for my own\nas well--I can broadcast at one time two or more different lengths. I\ncan broadcast more than one part in the drama, too. Whereas you, for\ninstance, will be the man waking up in a strange world in the record we\nare going to receive, I have connected my wavelength to receive the\nemotions and the sensations of the girl, Selda.\"\n\nHe came forward to the other chair, and sat down.\n\n\"Everything is in readiness now,\" he said. \"When I press this button on\nthe arm of my chair, the lights will go out. A moment later we shall be\nunder the stimulus of the machine. I don't think anything can happen.\"\nHe smiled. \"If anything does, and you are conscious enough to know it,\nyou can call my butler by means of an electrical device I have perfected\nsimply by speaking his name, Peter, in an ordinary conversational voice.\nBut I don't see how anything can go wrong.\"\n\nWe reached for each other's hands, and shook them quietly.\n\n\"Good luck,\" I said. \"The outcome of this means almost as much to me as\nit does to you.\" With another smile, Melbourne answered:\n\n\"Good luck to you, then, too.\"\n\nAt that moment the lights went off, and we sat there a few moments in\ntotal darkness....\n\nRemembering this scene, as I bathed that morning when I came out of the\nlake, I began to understand more clearly what had happened to me.\nEvidently, then, it _had_ been last night that I saw Melbourne, and the\nstrange other-life I had been recalling earlier had been the experience\nin the Chamber of Life.\n\nBut there was more yet. My mind raced back to the awakening on the hill,\nand to the landing in the city of Richmond. I remembered the\nconversation with Edvar in his apartment, the place where I had left off\nand gone back to my recollections of Melbourne.\n\nNow, as I stepped out of the tub and dried myself and dressed, I\nreturned mentally to the curious, mythical adventure in the mythical\ncity. It was still impossible for me to feel that it was unreal, it had\nbeen so vivid, so clear.\n\n\n\n\nBaret and Selda\n\n\nI remember that I lived nearly two months--or so it seemed--in that\nother world. I was assigned an apartment near to Edvar's--Selda was\nbetween us. Edvar instructed me in the details of the life I was to\nlead. But he was a rather cold sort: his interests were ancient history\nand archeology, and he would spend his mornings at work in the Library\nof History or in his study, the rest of his time flying about the world\non curious expeditions of discovery--examining the soil, I suppose, and\ninvestigating the customs and records of other cities.\n\nSelda devoted most of her time to me. It was she who took me from place\nto place, showing me the natural beauties of that world. There were, you\nsee, not only gentle slopes and hill-tops. There were mountainous crags\nas high and as wild as the Alps, forests as impenetrably deep and still\nas the jungles of the Amazon, and rivers that rushed and tumbled over\nrocks, or fell for thousands of feet from mountain cliffs.\n\nThe first time I went with her, she took me to a gigantic peak that\noverlooked the sea. There was, of course, a small level place for the\nairship to land. We left it there, and climbed on foot the last hundred\nyards or so. Our way lay through the heavy snow, but it was not too cold\nto be more than gloriously bracing, exhilarating. We wore our usual\ncostume of trunks and tunic.\n\nWe stood at the top and looked out over the grandest horizon I had ever\nseen. To the east there lay the sea, deep and very blue in the sunlight.\nThe shore was just a dark line far away and below us. There was a long\nstrip of grass and field bordering the sea for miles, and behind that\nthe forest. Toward the north, the mountains crept out from under the\nforest and moved down to the sea, rising until they became a vast\nwilderness of cliffs and rocks, and hid the sea, with peak after peak\nrising as far as the eye could reach into the snow and the mist. Then\nthe hills sloped down westward into a series of wooded valleys, through\nwhich ran the wide river I had seen at my awakening, coming down from\nthe mountains and through the valleys until it flattened broadly out\ninto the low plains in the south and moved eastward to the sea.\nEverywhere in the valleys and over the plains, I knew that cities were\nscattered, lonely and tall like the one they called Richmond. But we\nwere so high in the mountains that they were invisible to us--perhaps a\nkeen eye could have found them, tiny white dots crouching upon the\nearth.\n\nI turned to Selda--and caught my breath. The wind, swooping up from the\nsea, whipped her thin covering against her body and fluttered it like\nthe swift wings of a butterfly behind her. Her short, dark hair, too,\nwas lifted and blown back from her forehead, revealing the clean, soft\nprofile of her face. I had never seen a girl who stood so clean, so\nstraight. I watched her until she turned, too, and met my eyes. In them\nI thought I detected something startled and unfathomable.\n\n\"My God!\" I cried across the wind, \"you are beautiful!\" She frowned a\nlittle, but her eyes still looked searchingly into mine. I stepped\nforward, facing her. But I didn't touch her. I was afraid to touch\nanything so clean.\n\n\"You belong here, Selda,\" I added. \"The wind is a part of you, and the\nmountains, and the sea. You shouldn't have to live in the midst of all\nthose people in the city. You belong here.\" She smiled faintly, looking\nup at me.\n\n\"You belong here more than I do, Baret,\" she said. \"You came to us, not\nfrom the city, but from the hills.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe stood there, examining each other's eyes, for a long while. I wanted\nto take her in my arms, but I didn't. I looked away at last, back at the\nsea, puzzled and disturbed. I had never been aware of anything so fine\nas this before, nor of anything so painful. Suddenly I found myself\nwanting to be something, to do something--not for myself, but for her.\nIt was strange.\n\n\"Come,\" she said at last, \"we had better go back.\"\n\n\"I'd like to stay here forever,\" I answered moodily, glancing around a\nlast time at the versatile horizon.\n\n\"So would I,\" she admitted. Then, in a low voice, she added, \"But one\ncan't. One has to follow one's program.\"\n\nWe returned to the airship, raid rose into the cool, thin air. I stood\nbehind her on the way back, watching her slender body as she guided the\nplane. Once in a while she would turn her head and look up at me over\nher shoulder, then quickly look away again.\n\n\"Why is it,\" I asked her as we passed over the valleys and the river on\nour way home, \"why is it that these hills have such a cultivated\nlook--as though they had been laid out?\" She glanced back, and smiled.\n\n\"They _have_ been laid out,\" she said. \"The hills, and the rivers, and\nthe tallest mountains have all been constructed by our landscape artists\nin order to achieve their various effects. Even the line of the sea has\nbeen determined and arranged by the artists.\"\n\n\"But why?\" I said. \"Wasn't it a frightful waste of energy?\"\n\n\"It didn't seem so to us,\" she answered. \"We had no further need to\ncultivate the land except in small patches, when we learned the secret\nof artificial food. And we wanted to have perfect beauty about us. So we\nremodeled the outlines of the earth, and eliminated the insects and the\nharmful animals and the weeds. We made the land clean and fine as it had\nnever been before.\"\n\n\"It must have been a terrific labor.\"\n\n\"It pleased us. Our instinct is to arrange and remodel things, to order\nour life so that we know what it is and what it will always be.\" She\npaused for a moment, and added in a low voice, \"One is necessarily a\ndeterminist here.\"\n\nWe said no more until our arrival in Richmond.\n\nIt is not my purpose to detail here all that happened during the time I\nspent on that world. Most of it had to do with Selda, and our daily\nexpeditions about the world. This is not, after all, a love story, but\nthe account of a very strange experience; and, too, none of it was real.\n\nDuring my last week, a series of strange moods and happenings\ncomplicated my life. One day, after a visit to the sea with Selda, we\nwere walking back to our plane across the sand. Without any warning,\nsurrounded by the brilliant morning sunlight and the miles of sea and\nbeach, I struck my knee against something hard and immovable, and,\nflinging out my hand to catch myself from falling, I clung to a hard\nsurface like an iron railing. For a moment I was stunned and confused.\nThe sunlight seemed to fade, and there was a vague hint of darkness all\nabout me, with black walls looming up on all sides. It was as though I\nstood in two worlds at once, transfixed between night and day. Then the\ndarkness went away, the sunlight brightened. I looked around, and found\nSelda watching me curiously, a little alarmed.\n\n\"What happened, Baret?\" she asked, puzzled. I shook my head in\nbewilderment.\n\n\"I seemed to stumble--\" I said. There was nothing underfoot but the soft\nsand, and where I had flung my hand against a sort of railing, there was\nnothing either. We went back to the airship in silence, both of us\nconfused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that, with increasing frequency, there would come interruptions,\nlike iron bars striking dark, jagged holes in the tissue of life. From\ntime to time I heard inexplicable noises--the whirring of motors, the\nskid-skid of tires on invisible streets, the rumble of carts around\ncorners of a world where there were no carts. Again and again those\nmoments of confusion would come over me, when I seemed to be looking\ninto two worlds at once, one superimposed upon the other, one bright,\nthe other dark with faint points of light in the distance. Once, walking\nalong the corridor beyond my room in Richmond, I collided with a man.\nFor a moment the corridor faded completely. I stood on a street with\ndark houses about me. Overhead was the glow of a street-lamp, and a\nmilk-cart was just rattling away around a corner. A man with a\nfrightened face stood before me, his hat on the pavement, his eyes\nstaring. We looked at each other in astonishment. I started to speak.\nThen he reached for his hat quickly, and brushed by me, muttering close\nto my ear.\n\n\"For God's sake, look where you're going....\"\n\nI stood in the corridor again, staring. Down the corridor, coming toward\nme, was a single figure--Selda. Behind me there was nobody. I went to\nmeet Selda, dazed and uneasy. I could still hear, close to my ear, an\necho of that muffled, hoarse voice that I had never heard before.\n\nThat was two days before the end. We were leaving the city on that final\nbright morning, when a representative of the Bureau stopped us. I looked\nat him inquiringly.\n\n\"I have come to tell you, Baret,\" he said, \"that your departure is\nscheduled for this evening.\" I drew back, startled, and looked at Selda.\n\n\"My departure?\" I repeated in a low voice, hardly understanding. \"So\nsoon?\" I had forgotten that one day I should have to leave.\n\n\"It has been arranged,\" he said impersonally.\n\nWe bowed slightly to each other, and he went away. Selda and I stepped\naboard our ship in silence.\n\nThat time we flew up the river until we came to the foothills of the\nmountains in the north. We landed in a little clearing by the river at\nthe foot of a waterfall hundreds of feet high, towering over us. The\nforest stood about us on all sides, coming down to the river's brim on\nthe opposite bank and meeting it not far from us on the near bank. The\nprecipice, covered with moss and small bushes, stood above us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe sat a long while in silence, before I said bitterly:\n\n\"So I must go.\"\n\nShe didn't look at me, but answered quietly, \"Yes, you must go.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go,\" I cried, \"I want to stay here!\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked me, averting her face.\n\n\"Don't you know?\" I said swiftly. \"Haven't you understood long ago that\nI love you?\" She shook her head.\n\n\"Love is something that we don't know here--not until we have been\nmarried and lived with our men. Sometimes not then.\" But she looked at\nme, and I thought there were tears in her eyes. Suddenly the impulse I\nhad been resisting ever since the morning on the mountain became\ninsupportable, and I caught her in my arms almost roughly. Her face was\nclose to mine, and she closed her eyes. I kissed her, forgetting\neverything but the knowledge that I had stumbled upon the sort of love\nthat doesn't pass away, no matter how long a man lives.\n\nAfter a while, though, she drew away as if she resisted not my desire,\nbut her own.\n\n\"No--\" she said in a low voice, \"no....\"\n\n\"But Selda!\" I stammered, \"I love you--I want to marry you.\" She shook\nher head.\n\n\"No,\" she said again, \"didn't you understand? I am scheduled to marry\nEdvar.\"\n\nAt first I didn't know what she meant.\n\n\"Scheduled?\" I repeated dully. \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"It has been arranged for years. Don't you remember what Edvar told you\nabout our marriages here, the very first day you came? I was destined to\nmarry Edvar long before any of us were born, before our parents, even,\nwere born. It's the way they order our lives.\"\n\n\"But I love you,\" I cried in amazement. \"And you love me, too. I know\nyou love me.\"\n\n\"That means nothing here,\" she said. \"It happens sometimes. One has to\naccept it. Nothing can be done. We live according to the machinery of\nthe world. Everything is known and predetermined.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, in the midst of what she was saying, close behind me there\nsounded even above the roaring of the waterfall a raucous noise like the\nhooting of a taxi horn. It was followed by a shrieking of brakes, and a\nhoarse voice near by shouted something angry and profane. A rush of air\nswept by me, and I heard faintly the sound of a motor moving away, with\na grinding of gears. I looked at Selda.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\"\n\nShe nodded, with wide, frightened eyes. \"Yes. It's not the first time.\"\nSuddenly she rose, frowning, as if with pain. \"Come,\" she added, \"now we\nmust go back.\"\n\nThere was nothing else to do. We went back silently to the airship, and\nturned its nose toward the city.\n\nBut when I left her at her apartment, promising to see her later, I had\none last hope in my mind. I went to the Bureau.\n\nThe Bureau was a vast system of halls and offices, occupying two floors\nof the great building. I was sent from one automatic device to\nanother--there were no human clerks--in search of the representative who\nhad spoken to me before. Finally I found him in his apartment, down the\ncorridor only a hundred feet or so from my own. He was pouring over a\nmetal sheet on his table, where innumerable shifting figures were thrown\nby some hidden machine, and he was calculating with a set of hundreds of\nbuttons along its edges. He spoke to me without pausing or looking up,\nand throughout my interview he continued with his figuring as if it had\nbeen entirely automatic--as perhaps it was.\n\n\"What is it, Baret?\" he said I felt like a small child before the\nprincipal of the school.\n\n\"I have come to ask you whether it is necessary for me to go,\" I\nanswered. He nodded slightly, never looking up.\n\n\"It is necessary,\" he said. \"Your visit was pre-arranged and definite.\"\nI made a gesture of remonstrance.\n\n\"But I don't want to go,\" I insisted. \"I like this place, and I am\nwilling to fall into its life if I can remain under any conditions.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" he objected angrily.\n\n\"I have never been told why or how I came here. You said you would tell\nme that.\"\n\n\"I have never been told myself. It is a matter known to the men who\nhandled it.\"\n\n\"If I went to them, surely they could find some way to let me stay?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said coldly, \"the thing was as definite as every event that\ntakes place here. We do not let things happen haphazardly. We do not\nalter what has been arranged. And even if it were possible to let you\nstay--which I am inclined to doubt--they would not permit it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked dully.\n\n\"Because there is no place for you. Our social system has been planned\nfor hundreds of years ahead. Every individual of today and every\nindividual of the next six generations has his definite place, his\nprogram, his work to do. There is no place for you. It is impossible to\nfit you in, for you have no work, no training, no need that you can\nfill. You have no woman, and there are no women for your children or\nyour children's children. You are unnecessary. To fit you in, one would\nhave to disrupt the whole system for generations ahead. It is\nimpossible.\"\n\nI thought a moment, hopelessly.\n\n\"If I made a place?\" I suggested. \"Suppose I took someone else's place?\"\nHe smiled, a faint, cold smile.\n\n\"Murder? It is impossible. You are always under the control of the\nBureau in some way, whether you are aware of it or not.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI turned away, a little dazed. The whole thing was inevitable and clear\nas he put it. I knew there was nothing to be done.\n\nI left his apartment, and went down the corridor to the landing stage.\nNo one interfered with my movements, and my commands were not\nquestioned. I ordered a plane, and gave my name to the girl in charge.\n\n\"Your destination?\" she asked.\n\nI said, \"I am only going for pleasure.\"\n\n\"Your return?\"\n\n\"Expect me in an hour.\"\n\nI had watched Selda pilot the planes for so many weeks that I was\nfamiliar with the controls. I rose swiftly, circled the building, and\nheaded north toward the mountains. I hadn't the courage to see Selda\nagain. It was only a little while before I came to the place by the\nriver where we had spent the morning. I slowed down, and flew over it,\njust above the waterfall.\n\nThere was a landing-spot by the river just beyond the top of the fall. I\ncame to rest there, and left the machine.\n\nI stood looking at the river for a moment. I don't remember that any\nthoughts or emotions came to my mind. I simply stood there, a little\ndazed, and very quiet, with a vague picture of Selda before my eyes. It\nwas a dream-like moment.\n\nThen I slipped over the river's bank, into the water, and the swift\ncurrent, catching me up and whirling me around dizzily, carried me\ntoward the edge of the waterfall.\n\n\n\n\nAnd So to Work\n\n\nI glanced at the clock on the mantel. It was five minutes to eight: time\nto leave, if I was to get a decent breakfast before I went to the\noffice. I found an old hat in the closet and put it on. It would do\nuntil I had time to buy another.\n\nLast night--and this morning. Last night, after supper, I had dropped by\nthe Club for a drink. And met Melbourne. This morning I woke in the\nwater of the lake, and came home, and dressed. And went to work. Twelve\nhours--and in that time I had lived two months. I had fallen in love,\nand died. Now I must go to work.\n\nAs I left the apartment, and turned west away from the Drive, toward the\nstreet cars, I was whistling over and over a brief snatch of music. Was\nit Grieg? Or some composer never heard on earth?\n\nThere were people on the street now. They went by with frowning, intent\nfaces--on their way to work. And cars rolling by, pausing at the cross\nstreets with little squealings of brakes.\n\nEverything was so simple now. I went over it all as I waited for the\nstreet car, and as I rode down town. It was strange that Melbourne had\nnever foreseen that one possibility among so many.\n\nWe had sat down in our chairs, and then the adventure had begun. I\nhad felt the sensation of moving about, of going from place to place.\nWhen I was a child I used to have dreams of walking about the\nhouse and about the streets. I would wake up on the stairs, or at the\ndoor--sleep-walking. Reflexes did it. I had left the chair, under the\ninfluence of the story in the Chamber of Life, and gone out of the room.\nI remembered now all those brief moments, when I had seemed poised on\nthe brink of the real world--the stumbling against some hard object, the\nface under the street-lamp, the taxi, the voices. I had been going\nthrough the dark streets, with closed eyes, going toward the\nDrive--sleep-walking. And when I slipped over the bank of the river, in\nthe dream, and down into the water--in reality I had gone over the side\nof the Drive, and down into the cold lake.\n\nIt had been dawn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI left the car, and walked down the street, lost in the midst of the\ncrowds hurrying about me. It was all over, gone like one of those old\ndreams of my childhood. I could never forget it--never forget Selda--but\nit was gone. It had never existed. It had been cruel of Melbourne, cruel\nand ironic, to put Selda in the dream. But perhaps he had never realized\nthat it would last over into reality.\n\nI had no hope of seeing her again, even in the Chamber. I knew I could\nnever find Melbourne's home: I had paid no attention to the way the\ntaxi-driver took. And I wasn't very much interested now. It was only a\ndream. I had lost the only girl I had ever loved, in a dream.\n\nI pushed open the door of the Norfolk Lunch. It was late--I had only a\nlittle while for breakfast. I sat down at one of the tables, and spoke\nto the waiter in much the usual manner.\n\n\"Hello, Joe. I'm in a hurry--bring me bacon and eggs, as usual.\"\n\n\"Coffee, Mr. Barrett?\"\n\n\"Yes, coffee too. And hurry it up.\"\n\nIt wouldn't do to be late at the office, where I, too, was a maker of\nsometimes cruel dreams.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Chamber of Life, by Green Peyton Wertenbaker\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHAMBER OF LIFE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25862-8.txt or 25862-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/8/6/25862/\n\nProduced by Robert Cicconetti, Annie McGuire and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
