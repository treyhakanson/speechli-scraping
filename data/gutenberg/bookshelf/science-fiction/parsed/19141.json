Serviss\n\n\n1898\n\n\n\n\nChapter I.\n\n\nIt is impossible that the stupendous events which followed the disastrous\ninvasion of the earth by the Martians should go without record, and\ncircumstances having placed the facts at my disposal, I deem it a duty,\nboth to posterity and to those who were witnesses of and participants\nin the avenging counterstroke that the earth dealt back at its ruthless\nenemy in the heavens, to write down the story in a connected form.\n\nThe Martians had nearly all perished, not through our puny efforts, but\nin consequence of disease, and the few survivors fled in one of their\nprojectile cars, inflicting their cruelest blow in the act of departure.\n\n\nTheir Mysterious Explosive.\n\nThey possessed a mysterious explosive, of unimaginable puissance, with\nwhose aid they set their car in motion for Mars from a point in Bergen\nCounty, N. J., just back of the Palisades.\n\nThe force of the explosion may be imagined when it is recollected that\nthey had to give the car a velocity of more than seven miles per second\nin order to overcome the attraction of the earth and the resistance of\nthe atmosphere.\n\nThe shock destroyed all of New York that had not already fallen a prey,\nand all the buildings yet standing in the surrounding towns and cities\nfell in one far-circling ruin.\n\nThe Palisades tumbled in vast sheets, starting a tidal wave in the Hudson\nthat drowned the opposite shore.\n\n\nThousands of Victims.\n\nThe victims of this ferocious explosion were numbered by tens of\nthousands, and the shock, transmitted through the rocky frame of the\nglobe, was recorded by seismographic pendulums in England and on the\nContinent of Europe.\n\nThe terrible results achieved by the invaders had produced everywhere a\nmingled feeling of consternation and hopelessness. The devastation was\nwidespread. The death-dealing engines which the Martians had brought with\nthem had proved irresistible and the inhabitants of the earth possessed\nnothing capable of contending against them. There had been no protection\nfor the great cities; no protection even for the open country. Everything\nhad gone down before the savage onslaught of those merciless invaders from\nspace. Savage ruins covered the sites of many formerly flourishing towns\nand villages, and the broken walls of great cities stared at the heavens\nlike the exhumed skeletons of Pompeii. The awful agencies had extirpated\npastures and meadows and dried up the very springs of fertility in the\nearth where they had touched it. In some parts of the devastated lands\npestilence broke out; elsewhere there was famine. Despondency black as\nnight brooded over some of the fairest portions of the globe.\n\n\nAll Not Yet Destroyed.\n\nYet all had not been destroyed, because all had not been reached by\nthe withering hand of the destroyer. The Martians had not had time to\ncomplete their work before they themselves fell a prey to the diseases\nthat carried them off at the very culmination of their triumph.\n\nFrom those lands which had, fortunately, escaped invasion, relief was\nsent to the sufferers. The outburst of pity and of charity exceeded\nanything that the world had known. Differences of race and religion\nwere swallowed up in the universal sympathy which was felt for those\nwho had suffered so terribly from an evil that was as unexpected as it\nwas unimaginable in its enormity.\n\nBut the worst was not yet. More dreadful than the actual suffering and the\nscenes of death and devastation which overspread the afflicted lands was\nthe profound mental and moral depression that followed. This was shared\neven by those who had not seen the Martians and had not witnessed the\ndestructive effects of the frightful engines of war that they had imported\nfor the conquest of the earth. All mankind was sunk deep in this universal\ndespair, and it became tenfold blacker when the astronomers announced\nfrom their observatories that strange lights were visible, moving and\nflashing upon the red surface of the Planet of War. These mysterious\nappearances could only be interpreted in the light of past experience to\nmean that the Martians were preparing for another invasion of the earth,\nand who could doubt that with the invincible powers of destruction at\ntheir command they would this time make their work complete and final?\n\n\nA Startling Announcement.\n\nThis startling announcement was the more pitiable in its effects because\nit served to unnerve and discourage those few of stouter hearts and more\nhopeful temperaments who had already begun the labor of restoration and\nreconstruction amid the embers of their desolated homes. In New York\nthis feeling of hope and confidence, this determination to rise against\ndisaster and to wipe out the evidences of its dreadful presence as quickly\nas possible, had especially manifested itself. Already a company had been\nformed and a large amount of capital subscribed for the reconstruction\nof the destroyed bridges over the East River. Already architects were\nbusily at work planning new twenty-story hotels and apartment houses;\nnew churches and new cathedrals on a grander scale than before.\n\n\nThe Martians Returning.\n\nAmid this stir of renewed life came the fatal news that Mars was\nundoubtedly preparing to deal us a death blow. The sudden revulsion of\nfeeling flitted like the shadow of an eclipse over the earth. The scenes\nthat followed were indescribable. Men lost their reason. The faint-hearted\nended the suspense with self-destruction, the stout-hearted remained\nsteadfast, but without hope and knowing not what to do.\n\nBut there was a gleam of hope of which the general public as yet knew\nnothing. It was due to a few dauntless men of science, conspicuous\namong whom were Lord Kelvin, the great English savant; Herr Roentgen,\nthe discoverer of the famous X ray, and especially Thomas A. Edison, the\nAmerican genius of science. These men and a few others had examined with\nthe utmost care the engines of war, the flying machines, the generators\nof mysterious destructive forces that the Martians had produced, with\nthe object of discovering, if possible, the sources of their power.\n\nSuddenly from Mr. Edison's laboratory at Orange flashed the startling\nintelligence that he had not only discovered the manner in which the\ninvaders had been able to produce the mighty energies which they employed\nwith such terrible effect, but that, going further, he had found a way\nto overcome them.\n\nThe glad news was quickly circulated throughout the civilized\nworld. Luckily the Atlantic cables had not been destroyed by the Martians,\nso that communication between the Eastern and Western continents was\nuninterrupted. It was a proud day for America. Even while the Martians\nhad been upon the earth, carrying everything before them, demonstrating\nto the confusion of the most optimistic that there was no possibility\nof standing against them, a feeling--a confidence had manifested itself\nin France, to a minor extent in England, and particularly in Russia,\nthat the Americans might discover means to meet and master the invaders.\n\nNow, it seemed, this hope and expectation were to be realized. Too\nlate, it is true, in a certain sense, but not too late to meet the new\ninvasion which the astronomers had announced was impending. The effect\nwas as wonderful and indescribable as that of the despondency which but\na little while before had overspread the world. One could almost hear\nthe universal sigh of relief which went up from humanity. To relief\nsucceeded confidence--so quickly does the human spirit recover like an\nelastic spring, when pressure is released.\n\n\n\"We Are Ready for Them!\"\n\n\"Let them come,\" was the almost joyous cry. \"We shall be ready for\nthem now. The Americans have solved the problem. Edison has placed\nthe means of victory within our power.\"\n\nLooking back upon that time now, I recall, with a thrill, the pride that\nstirred me at the thought that, after all, the inhabitants of the Earth\nwere a match for those terrible men from Mars, despite all the advantage\nwhich they had gained from their millions of years of prior civilization\nand science.\n\nAs good fortunes, like bad, never come singly, the news of Mr. Edison's\ndiscovery was quickly followed by additional glad tidings from that\nlaboratory of marvels in the lap of the Orange mountains. During their\ncareer of conquest the Martians had astonished the inhabitants of the\nearth no less with their flying machines--which navigated our atmosphere\nas easily as they had that of their native planet--than with their more\ndestructive inventions. These flying machines in themselves had given\nthem an enormous advantage in the contest. High above the desolation\nthat they had caused to reign on the surface of the earth, and, out of\nthe range of our guns, they had hung safe in the upper air. From the\nclouds they had dropped death upon the earth.\n\n\nEdison's Flying Machine.\n\nNow, rumor declared that Mr. Edison had invented and perfected a flying\nmachine much more complete and manageable than those of the Martians\nhad been. Wonderful stories quickly found their way into the newspapers\nconcerning what Mr. Edison had already accomplished with the aid of his\nmodel electrical balloon. His laboratory was carefully guarded against\nthe invasion of the curious, because he rightly felt that a premature\nannouncement, which should promise more than could be actually fulfilled,\nwould, at this critical juncture, plunge mankind back again into the\ngulf of despair, out of which it had just begun to emerge.\n\nNevertheless, inklings of the truth leaked out. The flying machine had\nbeen seen by many persons hovering by night high above the Orange hills\nand disappearing in the faint starlight as if it had gone away into the\ndepths of space, out of which it would re-emerge before the morning light\nhad streaked the east, and be seen settling down again within the walls\nthat surrounded the laboratory of the great inventor. At length the\nrumor, gradually deepening into a conviction, spread that Edison himself,\naccompanied by a few scientific friends, had made an experimental trip\nto the moon. At a time when the spirit of mankind was less profoundly\nstirred, such a story would have been received with complete incredulity,\nbut now, rising on the wings of the new hope that was buoying up the\nearth, this extraordinary rumor became a day star of truth to the nations.\n\n\nA Trip to the Moon.\n\nAnd it was true. I had myself been one of the occupants of the car of\nthe flying Ship of Space on that night when it silently left the earth,\nand rising out of the great shadow of the globe, sped on to the moon. We\nhad landed upon the scarred and desolate face of the earth's satellite,\nand but that there are greater and more interesting events, the telling of\nwhich must not be delayed, I should undertake to describe the particulars\nof this first visit of men to another world.\n\nBut, as I have already intimated, this was only an experimental trip. By\nvisiting this little nearby island in the ocean of space, Mr. Edison\nsimply wished to demonstrate the practicability of his invention, and\nto convince, first of all, himself and his scientific friends that it\nwas possible for men--mortal men--to quit and to revisit the earth at\ntheir will. That aim this experimental trip triumphantly attained.\n\nIt would carry me into technical details that would hardly interest the\nreader to describe the mechanism of Mr. Edison's flying machine. Let\nit suffice to say that it depended upon the principal of electrical\nattraction and repulsion. By means of a most ingenious and complicated\nconstruction he had mastered the problem of how to produce, in a limited\nspace, electricity of any desired potential and of any polarity, and\nthat without danger to the experimenter or to the material experimented\nupon. It is gravitation, as everybody knows, that makes man a prisoner\non the earth. If he could overcome, or neutralize, gravitation he could\nfloat away a free creature of interstellar space. Mr. Edison in his\ninvention had pitted electricity against gravitation. Nature, in fact,\nhad done the same thing long before. Every astronomer knew it, but none\nhad been able to imitate or to reproduce this miracle of nature. When a\ncomet approaches the sun, the orbit in which it travels indicates that it\nis moving under the impulse of the sun's gravitation. It is in reality\nfalling in a great parabolic or elliptical curve through space. But,\nwhile a comet approaches the sun it begins to display--stretching out\nfor millions, and sometimes hundreds of millions of miles on the side\naway from the sun--an immense luminous train called its tail. This train\nextends back into that part of space from which the comet is moving. Thus\nthe sun at one and the same time is drawing the comet toward itself and\ndriving off from the comet in an opposite direction minute particles or\natoms which, instead of obeying the gravitational force, are plainly\ncompelled to disobey it. That this energy, which the sun exercises\nagainst its own gravitation, is electrical in its nature, hardly anybody\nwill doubt. The head of the comet being comparatively heavy and massive,\nfalls on toward the sun, despite the electrical repulsion. But the atoms\nwhich form the tail, being almost without weight, yield to the electrical\nrather than to the gravitational influence, and so fly away from the sun.\n\n\nGravity Overcome.\n\nNow, what Mr. Edison had done was, in effect, to create an electrified\nparticle which might be compared to one of the atoms composing the tail of\na comet, although in reality it was a kind of car, of metal, weighing some\nhundreds of pounds and capable of bearing some thousands of pounds with\nit in its flight. By producing, with the aid of the electrical generator\ncontained in this car, an enormous charge of electricity, Mr. Edison\nwas able to counterbalance, and a trifle more than counterbalance,\nthe attraction of the earth, and thus cause the car to fly off from the\nearth as an electrified pith ball flies from the prime conductor.\n\nAs we sat in the brilliantly lighted chamber that formed the interior of\nthe car, and where stores of compressed air had been provided together\nwith chemical apparatus, by means of which fresh supplies of oxygen\nand nitrogen might be obtained for our consumption during the flight\nthrough space, Mr. Edison touched a polished button, thus causing the\ngeneration of the required electrical charge on the exterior of the car,\nand immediately we began to rise.\n\nThe moment and direction of our flight had been so timed and prearranged,\nthat the original impulse would carry us straight toward the moon.\n\n\nA Triumphant Test.\n\nWhen we fell within the sphere of attraction of that orb it only became\nnecessary to so manipulate the electrical charge upon our car as nearly,\nbut not quite, to counterbalance the effect of the moon's attraction\nin order that we might gradually approach it and with an easy motion,\nsettle, without shock, upon its surface.\n\nWe did not remain to examine the wonders of the moon, although we could\nnot fail to observe many curious things therein. Having demonstrated\nthe fact that we could not only leave the earth, but could journey\nthrough space and safely land upon the surface of another planet, Mr.\nEdison's immediate purpose was fulfilled, and we hastened back to the\nearth, employing in leaving the moon and landing again upon our own planet\nthe same means of control over the electrical attraction and repulsion\nbetween the respective planets and our car which I have already described.\n\n\nTelegraphing the News.\n\nWhen actual experiment had thus demonstrated the practicability of\nthe invention, Mr. Edison no longer withheld the news of what he had\nbeen doing from the world. The telegraph lines and the ocean cables\nlabored with the messages that in endless succession, and burdened with\nan infinity of detail, were sent all over the earth. Everywhere the\nutmost enthusiasm was aroused.\n\n\"Let the Martians come,\" was the cry. \"If necessary, we can quit the\nearth as the Athenians fled from Athens before the advancing host of\nXerxes, and like them, take refuge upon our ships--these new ships of\nspace, with which American inventiveness has furnished us.\"\n\nAnd then, like a flash, some genius struck out an idea that fired\nthe world.\n\n\"Why should we wait? Why should we run the risk of having our cities\ndestroyed and our lands desolated a second time? Let us go to Mars. We\nhave the means. Let us beard the lion in his den. Let us ourselves\nturn conquerors and take possession of that detestable planet, and if\nnecessary, destroy it in order to relieve the earth of this perpetual\nthreat which now hangs over us like the sword of Damocles.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter II.\n\n\nThis enthusiasm would have had but little justification had Mr. Edison\ndone nothing more than invent a machine which could navigate the\natmosphere and the regions of interplanetary space.\n\nHe had, however, and this fact was generally known, although the details\nhad not yet leaked out--invented also machines of war intended to meet\nthe utmost that the Martians could do for either offence or defence in\nthe struggle which was now about to ensue.\n\n\nA Wonderful Instrument.\n\nActing upon the hint which had been conveyed from various investigations\nin the domain of physics, and concentrating upon the problem all those\nunmatched powers of intellect which distinguished him, the great inventor\nhad succeeded in producing a little implement which one could carry in\nhis hand, but which was more powerful than any battleship that ever\nfloated. The details of its mechanism could not be easily explained,\nwithout the use of tedious technicalities and the employment of terms,\ndiagrams and mathematical statements, all of which would lie outside\nthe scope of this narrative. But the principle of the thing was simple\nenough. It was upon the great scientific doctrine, which we have since\nseen so completely and brilliantly developed, of the law of harmonic\nvibrations, extending from atoms and molecules at one end of the series up\nto worlds and suns at the other end, that Mr. Edison based his invention.\n\nEvery kind of substance has its own vibratory rhythm. That of iron\ndiffers from that of pine wood. The atoms of gold do not vibrate in the\nsame time or through the same range as those of lead, and so on for all\nknown substances, and all the chemical elements. So, on a larger scale,\nevery massive body has its period of vibration. A great suspension\nbridge vibrates, under the impulse of forces that are applied to it,\nin long periods. No company of soldiers ever crosses such a bridge\nwithout breaking step. If they tramped together, and were followed by\nother companies keeping the same time with their feet, after a while the\nvibrations of the bridge would become so great and destructive that it\nwould fall in pieces. So any structure, if its vibration rate is known,\ncould easily be destroyed by a force applied to it in such a way that\nit should simply increase the swing of those vibrations up to the point\nof destruction.\n\nNow Mr. Edison had been able to ascertain the vibratory swing of many\nwell-known substances, and to produce, by means of the instrument which\nhe had contrived, pulsations in the ether which were completely under his\ncontrol, and which could be made long or short, quick or slow, at his\nwill. He could run through the whole gamut from the slow vibrations of\nsound in air up to the four hundred and twenty-five millions of millions\nof vibrations per second of the ultra red rays.\n\nHaving obtained an instrument of such power, it only remained to\nconcentrate its energy upon a given object in order that the atoms\ncomposing that object should be set into violent undulation, sufficient\nto burst it asunder and to scatter its molecules broadcast. This the\ninventor effected by the simplest means in the world--simply a parabolic\nreflector by which the destructive waves could be sent like a beam of\nlight, but invisible, in any direction and focused upon any desired point.\n\n\nTesting the \"Disintegrator.\"\n\nI had the good fortune to be present when this powerful engine of\ndestruction was submitted to its first test. We had gone upon the roof\nof Mr. Edison's laboratory and the inventor held the little instrument,\nwith its attached mirror, in his hand. We looked about for some object\non which to try its powers. On a bare limb of a tree not far away,\nfor it was late in the Fall, sat a disconsolate crow.\n\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Edison, \"that will do.\" He touched a button at the\nside of the instrument and a soft, whirring noise was heard.\n\n\"Feathers,\" said Mr. Edison, \"have a vibration period of three hundred\nand eighty-six million per second.\"\n\nHe adjusted the index as he spoke. Then, through a sighting tube, he\naimed at the bird.\n\n\"Now watch,\" he said.\n\n\nThe Crow's Fate.\n\nAnother soft whirr in the instrument, a momentary flash of light close\naround it, and, behold, the crow had turned from black to white!\n\n\"Its feathers are gone,\" said the inventor; \"they have been dissipated\ninto their constituent atoms. Now, we will finish the crow.\"\n\nInstantly there was another adjustment of the index, another outshooting\nof vibratory force, a rapid up and down motion of the index to include\na certain range of vibrations, and the crow itself was gone--vanished\nin empty space! There was the bare twig on which a moment before it had\nstood. Behind, in the sky, was the white cloud against which its black\nform had been sharply outlined, but there was no more crow.\n\n\nBad for the Martians.\n\n\"That looks bad for the Martians, doesn't it?\" said the Wizard. \"I have\nascertained the vibration rate of all the materials of which their war\nengines whose remains we have collected together are composed. They can\nbe shattered into nothingness in the fraction of a second. Even if the\nvibration period were not known, it could quickly be hit upon by simply\nrunning through the gamut.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried one of the onlookers. \"We have met the Martians and\nthey are ours.\"\n\nSuch in brief was the first of the contrivances which Mr. Edison invented\nfor the approaching war with Mars.\n\nAnd these facts had become widely known. Additional experiments had\ncompleted the demonstration of the inventor's ability, with the aid of\nhis wonderful instrument, to destroy any given object, or any part of\nan object, provided that that part differed in its atomic constitution,\nand consequently in its vibratory period, from the other parts.\n\nA most impressive public exhibition of the powers of the little\ndisintegrator was given amid the ruins of New York. On lower Broadway\na part of the walls of one of the gigantic buildings, which had been\ndestroyed by the Martians, impended in such a manner that it threatened at\nany moment to fall upon the heads of the passers-by. The Fire Department\ndid not dare touch it. To blow it up seemed a dangerous expedient,\nbecause already new buildings had been erected in its neighborhood,\nand their safety would be imperiled by the flying fragments. The fact\nhappened to come to my knowledge.\n\n\"Here is an opportunity,\" I said to Mr. Edison, \"to try the powers of\nyour machine on a large scale.\"\n\n\"Capital!\" he instantly replied. \"I shall go at once.\"\n\n\nDisintegrating a Building.\n\nFor the work now in hand it was necessary to employ a battery of\ndisintegrators, since the field of destruction covered by each was\ncomparatively limited. All of the impending portions of the wall must be\ndestroyed at once and together, for otherwise the danger would rather\nbe accentuated than annihilated. The disintegrators were placed upon\nthe roof of a neighboring building, so adjusted that their fields of\ndestruction overlapped one another upon the wall. Their indexes were\nall set to correspond with the vibration period of the peculiar kind\nof brick of which the wall consisted. Then the energy was turned on,\nand a shout of wonder arose from the multitudes which had assembled at\na safe distance to witness the experiment.\n\n\nOnly a Cloud Remained.\n\nThe wall did not fall; it did not break asunder; no fragments shot this\nway and that and high in the air; there was no explosion; no shock or\nnoise disturbed the still atmosphere--only a soft whirr, that seemed\nto pervade everything and to tingle in the nerves of the spectators;\nand--what had been was not! The wall was gone! But high above and all\naround the place where it had hung over the street with its threat of\ndeath there appeared, swiftly billowing outward in every direction,\na faint, bluish cloud. It was the scattered atoms of the destroyed wall.\n\nAnd now the cry \"On to Mars!\" was heard on all sides. But for such an\nenterprise funds were needed--millions upon millions. Yet some of the\nfairest and richest portions of the earth had been impoverished by the\nfrightful ravages of those enemies who had dropped down upon them from\nthe skies. Still, the money must be had. The salvation of the planet,\nas everybody was now convinced, depended upon the successful negotiation\nof a gigantic war fund, in comparison with which all the expenditures in\nall of the wars that had been waged by the nations for 2,000 years would\nbe insignificant. The electrical ships and the vibration engines must be\nconstructed by scores and thousands. Only Mr. Edison's immense resources\nand unrivaled equipment had enabled him to make the models whose powers\nhad been so satisfactorily shown. But to multiply these upon a war scale\nwas not only beyond the resources of any individual--hardly a nation on\nthe globe in the period of its greatest prosperity could have undertaken\nsuch a work. All the nations, then, must now conjoin. They must unite\ntheir resources, and, if necessary, exhaust all their hoards, in order\nto raise the needed sum.\n\n\nThe Yankees Lead.\n\nNegotiations were at once begun. The United States naturally took the\nlead, and their leadership was never for a moment questioned abroad.\n\nWashington was selected as the place of meeting for a great congress\nof the nations. Washington, luckily, had been one of the places which\nhad not been touched by the Martians. But if Washington had been a\ncity composed of hotels alone, and every hotel so great as to be a\nlittle city in itself, it would have been utterly insufficient for the\naccommodation of the innumerable throngs which now flocked to the banks\nof the Potomac. But when was American enterprise unequal to a crisis?\nThe necessary hotels, lodging houses and restaurants were constructed\nwith astounding rapidity. One could see the city growing and expanding\nday by day and week after week. It flowed over Georgetown Heights; it\nleaped the Potomac; it spread east and west, south and north; square mile\nafter square mile of territory was buried under the advancing buildings,\nuntil the gigantic city, which had thus grown up like a mushroom in a\nnight, was fully capable of accommodating all its expected guests.\n\nAt first it had been intended that the heads of the various governments\nshould in person attend this universal congress, but as the enterprise\nwent on, as the enthusiasm spread, as the necessity for haste became\nmore apparent through the warning notes which were constantly sounded\nfrom the observatories where the astronomers were nightly beholding new\nevidences of threatening preparations in Mars, the kings and queens\nof the old world felt that they could not remain at home; that their\nproper place was at the new focus and centre of the whole world--the\ncity of Washington. Without concerted action, without interchange of\nsuggestion, this impulse seemed to seize all the old world monarchs\nat once. Suddenly cablegrams flashed to the Government at Washington,\nannouncing that Queen Victoria, the Emperor William, the Czar Nicholas,\nAlphonso of Spain, with his mother, Maria Christina; the old Emperor\nFrancis Joseph and the Empress Elizabeth, of Austria; King Oscar and Queen\nSophia, of Sweden and Norway; King Humbert and Queen Margherita, of Italy;\nKing George and Queen Olga, of Greece; Abdul Hamid, of Turkey; Tsait'ien,\nEmperor of China; Mutsuhito, the Japanese Mikado, with his beautiful\nPrincess Haruko; the President of France, the President of Switzerland,\nthe First Syndic of the little republic of Andorra, perched on the crest\nof the Pyrenees, and the heads of all the Central and South American\nrepublics, were coming to Washington to take part in the deliberations,\nwhich, it was felt, were to settle the fate of earth and Mars.\n\nOne day, after this announcement had been received, and the additional\nnews had come that nearly all the visiting monarchs had set out,\nattended by brilliant suites and convoyed by fleets of warships, for\ntheir destination, some coming across the Atlantic to the port of New\nYork, others across the Pacific to San Francisco, Mr. Edison said to me:\n\n\"This will be a fine spectacle. Would you like to watch it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied.\n\n\nA Grand Spectacle.\n\nThe Ship of Space was immediately at our disposal. I think I have not\nyet mentioned the fact that the inventor's control over the electrical\ngenerator carried in the car was so perfect that by varying the potential\nor changing the polarity he could cause it slowly or swiftly, as might\nbe desired, to approach or recede from any object. The only practical\ndifficulty was presented when the polarity of the electrical charge upon\nan object in the neighborhood of the car was unknown to those in the\ncar, and happened to be opposite to that of the charge which the car, at\nthat particular moment, was bearing. In such a case, of course, the car\nwould fly toward the object, whatever it might be, like a pith ball or\na feather, attracted to the knob of an electrical machine. In this way,\nconsiderable danger was occasionally encountered, and a few accidents\ncould not be avoided. Fortunately, however, such cases were rare. It was\nonly now and then that, owing to some local cause, electrical polarities\nunknown to or unexpected by the navigators, endangered the safety of\nthe car. As I shall have occasion to relate, however, in the course of\nthe narrative, this danger became more acute and assumed at times a most\nformidable phase, when we had ventured outside the sphere of the earth\nand were moving through the unexplored regions beyond.\n\nOn this occasion, having embarked, we rose rapidly to a height of some\nthousands of feet and directed our course over the Atlantic. When half\nway to Ireland, we beheld, in the distance, steaming westward, the smoke\nof several fleets. As we drew nearer a marvellous spectacle unfolded\nitself to our eyes. From the northeast, their great guns flashing in\nthe sunlight and their huge funnels belching black volumes that rested\nlike thunder clouds upon the sea, came the mighty warships of England,\nwith her meteor flag streaming red in the breeze, while the royal\ninsignia, indicating the presence of the ruler of the British Empire,\nwas conspicuously displayed upon the flagship of the squadron.\n\nFollowing a course more directly westward appeared, under another black\ncloud of smoke, the hulls and guns and burgeons of another great fleet,\ncarrying the tri-color of France, and bearing in its midst the head of\nthe magnificent republic of western Europe.\n\nFurther south, beating up against the northerly winds, came a third fleet\nwith the gold and red of Spain fluttering from its masthead. This, too,\nwas carrying its King westward, where now, indeed, the star of empire\nhad taken its way.\n\n\nUniversal Brotherhood.\n\nRising a little higher, so as to extend our horizon, we saw coming\ndown the English channel, behind the British fleet, the black ships of\nRussia. Side by side, or following one another's lead, these war\nfleets were on a peaceful voyage that belied their threatening\nappearance. There had been no thought of danger to or from the forts\nand ports of rival nations which they had passed. There was no enmity,\nand no fear between them when the throats of their ponderous guns\nyawned at one another across the waves. They were now, in spirit, all\none fleet, having one object, bearing against one enemy, ready to\ndefend but one country, and that country was the entire earth.\n\nIt was some time before we caught sight of the Emperor William's fleet. It\nseems that the Kaiser, although at first consenting to the arrangement\nby which Washington had been selected as the assembling place for the\nnations, afterwards objected to it.\n\n\nKaiser Wilhelm's Jealousy.\n\n\"I ought to do this thing myself,\" he had said. \"My glorious ancestors\nwould never have consented to allow these upstart Republicans to lead in\na warlike enterprise of this kind. What would my grandfather have said to\nit? I suspect that it is some scheme aimed at the divine right of kings.\"\n\nBut the good sense of the German people would not suffer their ruler to\nplace them in a position so false and so untenable. And swept along\nby their enthusiasm the Kaiser had at last consented to embark on his\nflagship at Kiel, and now he was following the other fleets on their\ngreat mission to the Western Continent.\n\nWhy did they bring their warships when their intentions were peaceable,\ndo you ask? Well, it was partly the effect of ancient habit, and partly\ndue to the fact that such multitudes of officials and members of ruling\nfamilies wished to embark for Washington that the ordinary means of\nocean communications would have been utterly inadequate to convey them.\n\nAfter we had feasted our eyes on this strange sight, Mr. Edison suddenly\nexclaimed: \"Now let us see the fellows from the rising sun.\"\n\n\nOver the Mississippi.\n\nThe car was immediately directed toward the west. We rapidly approached\nthe American coast, and as we sailed over the Alleghany Mountains and the\nbroad plains of the Ohio and the Mississippi, we saw crawling beneath\nus from west, south and north, an endless succession of railway trains\nbearing their multitudes on to Washington. With marvellous speed we\nrushed westward, rising high to skim over the snow-topped peaks of the\nRocky Mountains and then the glittering rim of the Pacific was before\nus. Half way between the American coast and Hawaii we met the fleets\ncoming from China and Japan. Side by side they were ploughing the main,\nhaving forgotten, or laid aside, all the animosities of their former wars.\n\nI well remember how my heart was stirred at this impressive exhibition\nof the boundless influence which my country had come to exercise over\nall the people of the world, and I turned to look at the man to whose\ngenius this uprising of the earth was due. But Mr. Edison, after his\nwont, appeared totally unconscious of the fact that he was personally\nresponsible for what was going on. His mind, seemingly, was entirely\nabsorbed in considering problems, the solution of which might be essential\nto our success in the terrific struggle which was soon to begin.\n\n\nBack to Washington.\n\n\"Well, have you seen enough?\" he asked. \"Then let us go back to\nWashington.\"\n\nAs we speeded back across the continent we beheld beneath us again\nthe burdened express trains rushing toward the Atlantic, and hundreds\nof thousands of upturned eyes watched our swift progress, and volleys\nof cheers reached our ears, for every one knew that this was Edison's\nelectrical warship, on which the hope of the nation, and the hopes of\nall the nations, depended. These scenes were repeated again and again\nuntil the car hovered over the still expanding capital on the Potomac,\nwhere the unceasing ring of hammers rose to the clouds.\n\n\n\n\nChapter III.\n\n\nThe day appointed for the assembling of the nations in Washington opened\nbright and beautiful. Arrangements had been made for the reception of\nthe distinguished guests at the Capitol. No time was to be wasted, and,\nhaving assembled in the Senate Chamber, the business that had called\nthem together was to be immediately begun. The scene in Pennsylvania\navenue, when the procession of dignitaries and royalties passed up\ntoward the Capitol, was one never to be forgotten. Bands were playing,\nmagnificent equipages flashed in the morning sunlight, the flags of\nevery nation on the earth fluttered in the breeze. Queen Victoria,\nwith the Prince of Wales escorting her, and riding in an open carriage,\nwas greeted with roars of cheers; the Emperor William, following in\nanother carriage with Empress Victoria at his side, condescended to\nbow and smile in response to the greetings of a free people. Each of\nthe other monarchs was received in a similar manner. The Czar of Russia\nproved to be an especial favorite with the multitude on account of the\nancient friendship of his house for America. But the greatest applause\nof all came when the President of France, followed by the President\nof Switzerland and the First Syndic of the little Republic of Andorra,\nmade their appearance. Equally warm were the greetings extended to the\nrepresentatives of Mexico and the South American States.\n\n\nThe Sultan of Turkey.\n\nThe crowd apparently hardly knew at first how to receive the Sultan of\nTurkey, but the universal good feeling was in his favor, and finally\nrounds of hand clapping and cheers greeted his progress along the\nsplendid avenue.\n\nA happy idea had apparently occurred to the Emperor of China and the\nMikado of Japan, for, attended by their intermingled suites, they\nrode together in a single carriage. This object lesson in the unity of\ninternational feeling immensely pleased the spectators.\n\n\nAn Unparallelled Scene.\n\nThe scene in the Senate Chamber stirred every one profoundly. That\nit was brilliant and magnificent goes without saying, but there was a\nseriousness, an intense feeling of expectancy, pervading both those who\nlooked on and those who were to do the work for which these magnates of\nthe earth had assembled, which produced an ineradicable impression. The\nPresident of the United States, of course, presided. Representatives\nof the greater powers occupied the front seats, and some of them were\nhonored with special chairs near the President.\n\nNo time was wasted in preliminaries. The President made a brief speech.\n\n\"We have come together,\" he said, \"to consider a question that equally\ninterests the whole earth. I need not remind you that unexpectedly and\nwithout provocation on our part the people--the monsters, I should\nrather say--of Mars, recently came down upon the earth, attacked us\nin our homes and spread desolation around them. Having the advantage\nof ages of evolution, which for us are yet in the future, they brought\nwith them engines of death and of destruction against which we found it\nimpossible to contend. It is within the memory of every one in reach\nof my voice that it was through the entirely unexpected succor which\nProvidence sent us that we were suddenly and effectually freed from the\ninvaders. By our own efforts we could have done nothing.\"\n\n\nMcKinley's Tribute.\n\n\"But, as you all know, the first feeling of relief which followed the\ndeath of our foes was quickly succeeded by the fearful news which came to\nus from the observatories, that the Martians were undoubtedly preparing\nfor a second invasion of our planet. Against this we should have had no\nrecourse and no hope but for the genius of one of my countrymen, who,\nas you are all aware, has perfected means which may enable us not only\nto withstand the attack of those awful enemies, but to meet them, and,\nlet us hope, to conquer them on their own ground.\"\n\n\"Mr. Edison is here to explain to you what those means are. But we have\nalso another object. Whether we send a fleet of interplanetary ships\nto invade Mars or whether we simply confine our attention to works of\ndefence, in either case it will be necessary to raise a very large sum\nof money. None of us has yet recovered from the effects of the recent\ninvasion. The earth is poor to-day compared to its position a few years\nago; yet we cannot allow our poverty to stand in the way. The money,\nthe means, must be had. It will be part of our business here to raise\na gigantic war fund by the aid of which we can construct the equipment\nand machinery that we shall require. This, I think, is all I need to\nsay. Let us proceed to business.\"\n\n\"Where is Mr. Edison?\" cried a voice.\n\n\"Will Mr. Edison please step forward?\" said the President.\n\nThere was a stir in the assembly, and the iron-gray head of the great\ninventor was seen moving through the crowd. In his hand he carried one of\nhis marvellous disintegrators. He was requested to explain and illustrate\nits operation. Mr. Edison smiled.\n\n\nEdison to the Rescue.\n\n\"I can explain its details,\" he said, \"to Lord Kelvin, for instance,\nbut if Their Majesties will excuse me, I doubt whether I can make it\nplain to the crowned heads.\"\n\nThe Emperor William smiled superciliously. Apparently he thought that\nanother assault had been committed upon the divine right of kings. But\nthe Czar Nicholas appeared to be amused, and the Emperor of China, who\nhad been studying English, laughed in his sleeve, as if he suspected\nthat a joke had been perpetrated.\n\n\"I think,\" said one of the deputies, \"that a simple exhibition of the\npowers of the instrument, without a technical explanation of its method\nof working, will suffice for our purpose.\"\n\nThis suggestion was immediately approved. In response to it, Mr. Edison,\nby a few simple experiments, showed how he could quickly and certainly\nshatter into its constituent atoms any object upon which the vibratory\nforce of the disintegrator should be directed. In this manner he caused an\ninkstand to disappear under the very nose of the Emperor William without a\nspot of ink being scattered upon his sacred person, but evidently the odor\nof the disunited atoms was not agreeable to the nostrils of the Kaiser.\n\nMr. Edison also explained in general terms the principle on which the\ninstrument worked. He was greeted with round after round of applause,\nand the spirit of the assembly rose high.\n\nNext the workings of the electrical ship were explained, and it was\nannounced that after the meeting had adjourned an exhibition of the\nflying powers of the ship would be given in the open air.\n\nThese experiments, together with the accompanying explanations, added\nto what had already been disseminated through the public press, were\nquite sufficient to convince all the representatives who had assembled\nin Washington that the problem of how to conquer the Martians had\nbeen solved. The means were plainly at hand. It only remained to apply\nthem. For this purpose, as the President had pointed out, it would be\nnecessary to raise a very large sum of money.\n\n\"How much will be needed?\" asked one of the English representatives.\n\n\"At least ten thousand millions of dollars,\" replied the President.\n\n\"It would be safer,\" said a Senator from the Pacific Coast, \"to make it\ntwenty-five thousand millions.\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" said the King of Italy, \"that the nations be called in\nalphabetical order, and that the representatives of each name a sum\nwhich it is ready and able to contribute.\"\n\n\"We want the cash or its equivalent,\" shouted the Pacific Coast Senator.\n\n\"I shall not follow the alphabet strictly,\" said the President, \"but shall\nbegin with the larger nations first. Perhaps, under the circumstances,\nit is proper that the United States should lead the way. Mr. Secretary,\"\nhe continued, turning to the Secretary of the Treasury, \"how much can\nwe stand?\"\n\n\nAn Enormous Sum.\n\n\"At least a thousand millions,\" replied the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nA roar of applause that shook the room burst from the assembly. Even\nsome of the monarchs threw up their hats. The Emperor Tsait'ten smiled\nfrom ear to ear. One of the Roko Tuis, or native chiefs, from Fiji,\nsprang up and brandished a war club.\n\nThe President then proceeded to call the other nations, beginning with\nAustria-Hungary and ending with Zanzibar, whose Sultan, Hamoud bin\nMahomed, had come to the congress in the escort of Queen Victoria. Each\ncontributed liberally.\n\nGermany coming in alphabetical order just before Great Britain, had named,\nthrough its Chancellor, the sum of $500,000,000, but when the First Lord\nof the British Treasury, not wishing to be behind the United States,\nnamed double that sum as the contribution of the British Empire, the\nEmperor William looked displeased. He spoke a word in the ear of the\nChancellor, who immediately raised his hand.\n\n\nA Thousand Million Dollars.\n\n\"We will give a thousand million dollars,\" said the Chancellor.\n\nQueen Victoria seemed surprised, though not displeased. The First Lord\nof the Treasury met her eye, and then, rising in his place, said:\n\n\"Make it fifteen hundred million for Great Britain.\"\n\nEmperor William consulted again with his Chancellor, but evidently\nconcluded not to increase his bid.\n\nBut, at any rate, the fund had benefited to the amount of a thousand\nmillions by this little outburst of imperial rivalry.\n\nThe greatest surprise of all, however, came when the King of Siam was\ncalled upon for his contribution. He had not been given a foremost place\nin the Congress, but when the name of his country was pronounced he rose\nby his chair, dressed in a gorgeous specimen of the peculiar attire of\nhis country, then slowly pushed his way to the front, stepped up to the\nPresident's desk and deposited upon it a small box.\n\n\"This is our contribution,\" he said, in broken English.\n\nThe cover was lifted, and there darted, shimmering in the half gloom of\nthe Chamber, a burst of iridescence from the box.\n\n\nThe Long Lost Treasure.\n\n\"My friends of the Western world,\" continued the King of Siam, \"will be\ninterested in seeing this gem. Only once before has the eye of a European\nbeen blessed with the sight of it. Your books will tell you that in the\nseventeenth century a traveler, Tavernier, saw in India an unmatched\ndiamond which afterward disappeared like a meteor, and was thought to\nhave been lost from the earth. You all know the name of that diamond and\nits history. It is the Great Mogul, and it lies before you. How it came\ninto my possession I shall not explain. At any rate, it is honestly mine,\nand I freely contribute it here to aid in protecting my native planet\nagainst those enemies who appear determined to destroy it.\"\n\nWhen the excitement which the appearance of this long lost treasure, that\nhad been the subject of so many romances and of such long and fruitless\nsearch, had subsided, the President continued calling the list, until\nhe had completed it.\n\nUpon taking the sum of the contributions (the Great Mogul was reckoned\nat three millions) it was found to be still one thousand millions short\nof the required amount.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury was instantly on his feet.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said, \"I think we can stand that addition. Let it\nbe added to the contribution of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhen the cheers that greeted the conclusion of the business were over,\nthe President announced that the next affair of the Congress was to\nselect a director who should have entire charge of the preparations for\nthe war. It was the universal sentiment that no man could be so well\nsuited for this post as Mr. Edison himself. He was accordingly selected\nby the unanimous and enthusiastic choice of the great assembly.\n\n\"How long a time do you require to put everything in readiness?\" asked\nthe President.\n\n\"Give me carte blanche,\" replied Mr. Edison, \"and I believe I can have\na hundred electric ships and three thousand disintegrators ready within\nsix months.\"\n\nA tremendous cheer greeted this announcement.\n\n\"Your powers are unlimited,\" said the President, \"draw on the fund for\nas much money as you need,\" whereupon the Treasurer of the United States\nwas made the disbursing officer of the fund, and the meeting adjourned.\n\nNot less than 5,000,000 people had assembled at Washington from all\nparts of the world. Every one of this immense multitude had been able to\nlisten to the speeches and the cheers in the Senate chamber, although\nnot personally present there. Wires had been run all over the city,\nand hundreds of improved telephonic receivers provided, so that every\none could hear. Even those who were unable to visit Washington, people\nliving in Baltimore, New York, Boston, and as far away as New Orleans,\nSt. Louis and Chicago, had also listened to the proceedings with the aid\nof these receivers. Upon the whole, probably not less than 50,000,000\npeople had heard the deliberations of the great congress of the nations.\n\n\nThe Excitement in Washington.\n\nThe telegraph and the cable had sent the news across the oceans to all\nthe capitols of the earth. The exultation was so great that the people\nseemed mad with joy.\n\nThe promised exhibition of the electrical ship took place the next\nday. Enormous multitudes witnessed the experiment, and there was a\nstruggle for places in the car. Even Queen Victoria, accompanied by\nthe Prince of Wales, ventured to take a ride in it, and they enjoyed it\nso much that Mr. Edison prolonged the journey as far as Boston and the\nBunker Hill monument.\n\nMost of the other monarchs also took a high ride, but when the turn of\nthe Emperor of China came he repeated a fable which he said had come\ndown from the time of Confucius:\n\n\nA Chinese Legend.\n\n\"Once upon a time there was a Chinaman living in the valley of the\nHoang-Ho River, who was accustomed frequently to lie on his back, gazing\nat, and envying, the birds that he saw flying away in the sky. One day he\nsaw a black speck which rapidly grew larger and larger, until as it got\nnear he perceived that it was an enormous bird, which overshadowed the\nearth with its wings. It was the elephant of birds, the roc. 'Come with\nme,' said the roc, 'and I will show you the wonders of the kingdom of the\nbirds.' The man caught hold of its claw and nestled among its feathers,\nand they rapidly rose high in the air, and sailed away to the Kuen-Lun\nMountains. Here, as they passed near the top of the peaks, another roc\nmade its appearance. The wings of the two great birds brushed together,\nand immediately they fell to fighting. In the midst of the melee the\nman lost his hold and tumbled into the top of a tree, where his pigtail\ncaught on a branch, and he remained suspended. There the unfortunate man\nhung helpless, until a rat, which had its home in the rocks at the foot\nof the tree, took compassion upon him, and, climbing up, gnawed off the\nbranch. As the man slowly and painfully wended his weary way homeward,\nhe said: 'This teaches me that creatures to whom nature has given neither\nfeathers nor wings should leave the kingdom of the birds to those who\nare fitted to inhabit it.'\"\n\nHaving told this story, Tsait'ien turned his back on the electrical ship.\n\n\nThe Grand Ball.\n\nAfter the exhibition was finished, and amid the fresh outburst of\nenthusiasm that followed, it was suggested that a proper way to wind up\nthe Congress and give suitable expression to the festive mood which now\npossessed mankind would be to have a grand ball. This suggestion met\nwith immediate and universal approval.\n\nBut for so gigantic an affair it was, of course, necessary to make special\npreparations. A convenient place was selected on the Virginia side of the\nPotomac; a space of ten acres was carefully levelled and covered with a\npolished floor, rows of columns one hundred feet apart were run across\nit in every direction, and these were decorated with electric lights,\ndisplaying every color of the spectrum.\n\n\nUnsurpassed Fireworks.\n\nAbove this immense space, rising in the centre to a height of more than\na thousand feet, was anchored a vast number of balloons, all aglow\nwith lights, and forming a tremendous dome, in which brilliant lamps\nwere arranged in such a manner as to exhibit, in an endless succession\nof combinations, all the national colors, ensigns and insignia of the\nvarious countries represented at the Congress. Blazing eagles, lions,\nunicorns, dragons and other imaginary creatures that the different nations\nhad chosen for their symbols appeared to hover high above the dancers,\nshedding a brilliant light upon the scene.\n\nCircles of magnificent thrones were placed upon the floor in convenient\nlocations for seeing. A thousand bands of music played, and tens of\nthousands of couples, gayly dressed and flashing with gems, whirled\ntogether upon the polished floor.\n\n\nQueen Victoria Dances.\n\nThe Queen of England led the dance, on the arm of the President of the\nUnited States.\n\nThe Prince of Wales led forth the fair daughter of the President,\nuniversally admired as the most beautiful woman upon the great ballroom\nfloor.\n\nThe Emperor William, in his military dress, danced with the beauteous\nPrincess Masaco, the daughter of the Mikado, who wore for the occasion\nthe ancient costume of the women of her country, sparkling with jewels,\nand glowing with quaint combinations of color like a gorgeous butterfly.\n\nThe Chinese Emperor, with his pigtail flying high as he spun, danced\nwith the Empress of Russia.\n\nThe King of Siam essayed a waltz with the Queen Ranavalona, of Madagascar,\nwhile the Sultan of Turkey basked in the smiles of a Chicago heiress to\na hundred millions.\n\nThe Czar choose for his partner a dark-eyed beauty from Peru, but\nKing Malietoa, of Samoa, was suspicious of civilized charmers and,\navoiding all of their allurements, expressed his joy and gave vent to\nhis enthusiasm in a pas seul. In this he was quickly joined by a band\nof Sioux Indian chiefs, whose whoops and yells so startled the leader of\na German band on their part of the floor that he dropped his baton and,\nfollowed by the musicians, took to his heels.\n\nThis incident amused the good-natured Emperor of China more than anything\nelse that had occurred.\n\n\"Make muchee noisee,\" he said, indicating the fleeing musicians with\nhis thumb. \"Allee same muchee flaid noisee,\" and then his round face\ndimpled into another laugh.\n\nThe scene from the outside was even more imposing than that which greeted\nthe eye within the brilliantly lighted enclosure. Far away in the night,\nrising high among the stars, the vast dome of illuminated balloons\nseemed like some supernatural creation, too grand and glorious to have\nbeen constructed by the inhabitants of the earth.\n\nAll around it, and from some of the balloons themselves, rose jets\nand fountains of fire, ceaselessly playing, and blotting out the\nconstellations of the heavens by their splendor.\n\n\nThe Prince of Wales's Toast.\n\nThe dance was followed by a grand banquet, at which the Prince of Wales\nproposed a toast to Mr. Edison:\n\n\"It gives me much pleasure,\" he said, \"to offer, in the name of the\nnations of the Old World, this tribute of our admiration for, and our\nconfidence in, the genius of the New World. Perhaps on such an occasion\nas this, when all racial differences and prejudices ought to be, and are,\nburied and forgotten, I should not recall anything that might revive\nthem; yet I cannot refrain from expressing my happiness in knowing that\nthe champion who is to achieve the salvation of the earth has come forth\nfrom the bosom of the Anglo-Saxon race.\"\n\nSeveral of the great potentates looked grave upon hearing the Prince of\nWales's words, and the Czar and the Kaiser exchanged glances; but there\nwas no interruption to the cheers that followed. Mr. Edison, whose modesty\nand dislike to display and to speechmaking were well known, simply said:\n\n\"I think we have got the machine that can whip them. But we ought not\nto be wasting any time. Probably they are not dancing on Mars, but are\ngetting ready to make us dance.\"\n\n\nHaste to Embark.\n\nThese words instantly turned the current of feeling in the vast\nassembly. There was no longer any disposition to expend time in vain\nboastings and rejoicings. Everywhere the cry now became, \"Let us make\nhaste! Let us get ready at once! Who knows but the Martians have already\nembarked, and are now on their way to destroy us?\"\n\nUnder the impulse of this new feeling, which, it must be admitted,\nwas very largely inspired by terror, the vast ballroom was quickly\ndeserted. The lights were suddenly put out in the great dome of balloons,\nfor someone had whispered:\n\n\"Suppose they should see that from Mars? Would they not guess what we\nwere about, and redouble their preparations to finish us?\"\n\nUpon the suggestion of the President of the United States, an executive\ncommittee, representing all the principal nations, was appointed, and\nwithout delay a meeting of this committee was assembled at the White\nHouse. Mr. Edison was summoned before it, and asked to sketch briefly\nthe plan upon which he proposed to work.\n\n\nThousands of Men for Mars.\n\nI need not enter into the details of what was done at this meeting. Let it\nsuffice to say that when it broke up, in the small hours of the morning,\nit had been unanimously resolved that as many thousands of men as\nMr. Edison might require should be immediately placed at his disposal;\nthat as far as possible all the great manufacturing establishments\nof the country should be instantly transformed into factories where\nelectrical ships and disintegrators could be built, and upon the\nsuggestion of Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, the celebrated English\nelectrical expert, seconded by Lord Kelvin, it was resolved that all\nthe leading men of science in the world should place their services at\nthe disposal of Mr. Edison in any capacity in which, in his judgment,\nthey might be useful to him.\n\nThe members of this committee were disposed to congratulate one another\non the good work which they had so promptly accomplished, when at the\nmoment of their adjournment, a telegraphic dispatch was handed to the\nPresident from Professor George E. Hale, the director of the great Yerkes\nObservatory, in Wisconsin. The telegram read:\n\n\nWhat's Happening on Mars?\n\n\"Professor Barnard, watching Mars to-night with the forty-inch telescope,\nsaw a sudden outburst of reddish light, which we think indicates that\nsomething has been shot from the planet. Spectroscopic observations of\nthis moving light indicated that it was coming earthward, while visible,\nat the rate of not less than one hundred miles a second.\"\n\nHardly had the excitement caused by the reading of this dispatch subsided,\nwhen others of a similar import came from the Lick Observatory, in\nCalifornia; from the branch of the Harvard Observatory at Arequipa,\nin Peru, and from the Royal Observatory, at Potsdam.\n\nWhen the telegram from this last-named place was read the Emperor William\nturned to his Chancellor and said:\n\n\"I want to go home. If I am to die I prefer to leave my bones among those\nof my Imperial ancestors, and not in this vulgar country, where no king\nhas ever ruled. I don't like this atmosphere. It makes me feel limp.\"\n\nAnd now, whipped on by the lash of alternate hope and fear, the earth\nsprang to its work of preparation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV.\n\n\nIt is not necessary for me to describe the manner in which Mr. Edison\nperformed his tremendous task. He was as good as his word, and within six\nmonths from the first stroke of the hammer, a hundred electrical ships,\neach provided with a full battery of disintegrators, were floating in\nthe air above the harbor and the partially rebuilt city of New York.\n\nIt was a wonderful scene. The polished sides of the huge floating cars\nsparkled in the sunlight, and, as they slowly rose and fell, and swung\nthis way and that, upon the tides of the air, as if held by invisible\ncables, the brilliant pennons streaming from their peaks waved up and\ndown like the wings of an assemblage of gigantic humming birds.\n\nNot knowing whether the atmosphere of Mars would prove suitable to be\nbreathed by inhabitants of the earth, Mr. Edison had made provision, by\nmeans of an abundance of glass-protected openings, to permit the inmates\nof the electrical ships to survey their surroundings without quitting the\ninterior. It was possible by properly selecting the rate of undulation,\nto pass the vibratory impulse from the disintegrators through the glass\nwindows of a car, without damage to the glass itself. The windows were so\narranged that the disintegrators could sweep around the car on all sides,\nand could also be directed above or below, as necessity might dictate.\n\nTo overcome the destructive forces employed by the Martians no\nsatisfactory plan had yet been devised, because there was no means to\nexperiment with them. The production of those forces was still the secret\nof our enemies. But Mr. Edison had no doubt that if we could not resist\ntheir effects we might at least be able to avoid them by the rapidity of\nour motions. As he pointed out, the war machines which the Martians had\nemployed in their invasion of the earth, were really very awkward and\nunmanageable affairs. Mr. Edison's electrical ships, on the other hand,\nwere marvels of speed and of manageability. They could dart about, turn,\nreverse their course, rise, fall, with the quickness and ease of a fish\nin the water. Mr. Edison calculated that even if mysterious bolts should\nfall upon our ships we could diminish their power to cause injury by\nour rapid evolutions.\n\nWe might be deceived in our expectations, and might have overestimated\nour powers, but at any rate we must take our chances and try.\n\n\nWatching the Martians.\n\nA multitude, exceeding even that which had assembled during the great\ncongress at Washington, now thronged New York and its neighborhood\nto witness the mustering and the departure of the ships bound for\nMars. Nothing further had been heard of the mysterious phenomenon\nreported from the observatories six months before, and which at the time\nwas believed to indicate the departure of another expedition from Mars\nfor the invasion of the earth. If the Martians had set out to attack\nus they had evidently gone astray; or, perhaps, it was some other world\nthat they were aiming at this time.\n\nThe expedition had, of course, profoundly stirred the interest of the\nscientific world, and representatives of every branch of science,\nfrom all the civilized nations, urged their claims to places in\nthe ships. Mr. Edison was compelled, from lack of room, to refuse\ntransportation to more than one in a thousand of those who now, on the\nplea that they might be able to bring back something of advantage to\nscience, wished to embark for Mars.\n\n\nAs the Great Napoleon Did.\n\nOn the model of the celebrated corps of literary and scientific men\nwhich Napoleon carried with him in his invasion of Egypt, Mr. Edison\nselected a company of the foremost astronomers, archaeologists,\nanthropologists, botanists, bacteriologists, chemists, physicists,\nmathematicians, mechanicians, meteorologists and experts in mining,\nmetallurgy and every other branch of practical science, as well as\nartists and photographers. It was but reasonable to believe that in\nanother world, and a world so much older than the earth as Mars was,\nthese men would be able to gather materials in comparison with which\nthe discoveries made among the ruins of ancient empires in Egypt and\nBabylonia would be insignificant indeed.\n\n\nTo Conquer Another World.\n\nIt was a wonderful undertaking and a strange spectacle. There was a\nfeeling of uncertainty which awed the vast multitude whose eyes were\nupturned to the ships. The expedition was not large, considering the\ngigantic character of the undertaking. Each of the electrical ships\ncarried about twenty men, together with an abundant supply of compressed\nprovisions, compressed air, scientific apparatus and so on. In all,\nthere were about 2,000 men, who were going to conquer, if they could,\nanother world!\n\nBut though few in numbers, they represented the flower of the earth,\nthe culmination of the genius of the planet. The greatest leaders\nin science, both theoretical and practical, were there. It was the\nevolution of the earth against the evolution of Mars. It was a planet in\nthe heyday of its strength matched against an aged and decrepit world\nwhich, nevertheless, in consequence of its long ages of existence,\nhad acquired an experience which made it a most dangerous foe. On both\nsides there was desperation. The earth was desperate because it foresaw\ndestruction unless it could first destroy its enemy. Mars was desperate\nbecause nature was gradually depriving it of the means of supporting\nlife, and its teeming population was compelled to swarm like the inmates\nof an overcrowded hive of bees, and find new homes elsewhere. In this\nrespect the situation on Mars, as we were well aware, resembled what had\nalready been known upon the earth, where the older nations overflowing\nwith population had sought new lands in which to settle, and for that\npurpose had driven out the native inhabitants, whenever those natives\nhad proven unable to resist the invasion.\n\nNo man could foresee the issue of what we were about to undertake,\nbut the tremendous powers which the disintegrators had exhibited and\nthe marvellous efficiency of the electrical ships bred almost universal\nconfidence that we should be successful.\n\n\nMaster Minds of the World.\n\nThe car in which Mr. Edison travelled was, of course, the flagship\nof the squadron, and I had the good fortune to be included among\nits inmates. Here, besides several leading men of science from our\nown country, were Lord Kelvin, Lord Rayleigh, Professor Roentgen,\nDr. Moissan--the man who first made artificial diamonds--and several\nothers whose fame had encircled the world. Each of these men cherished\nhopes of wonderful discoveries, along his line of investigation, to be\nmade in Mars.\n\nAn elaborate system of signals had, of course, to be devised for the\ncontrol of the squadron. These signals consisted of brilliant electric\nlights displayed at night and so controlled that by their means long\nsentences and directions could be easily and quickly transmitted.\n\n\nA Novel Signal System.\n\nThe day signals consisted partly of brightly colored pennons and flags,\nwhich were to serve only when, shadowed by clouds or other obstructions,\nthe full sunlight should not fall upon the ships. This could naturally\nonly occur near the surface of the earth or of another planet.\n\nOnce out of the shadow of the earth we should have no more clouds and\nno more night until we arrived at Mars. In open space the sun would be\ncontinually shining. It would be perpetual day for us, except as, by\nartificial means, we furnished ourselves with darkness for the purpose\nof promoting sleep. In this region of perpetual day, then, the signals\nwere also to be transmitted by flashes of light from mirrors reflecting\nthe rays of the sun.\n\n\nPerpetual Night!\n\nYet this perpetual day would be also, in one sense, a perpetual\nnight. There would be no more blue sky for us, because without an\natmosphere the sunlight could not be diffused. Objects would be\nilluminated only on the side toward the sun. Anything that screened\noff the direct rays of sunlight would produce absolute darkness behind\nit. There would be no graduation of shadow. The sky would be as black\nas ink on all sides.\n\nWhile it was the intention to remain as much as possible within the cars,\nyet since it was probable that necessity would arise for occasionally\nquitting the interior of the electrical ships, Mr. Edison had provided for\nthis emergency by inventing an air-tight dress constructed somewhat after\nthe manner of a diver's suit, but of much lighter material. Each ship was\nprovided with several of these suits, by wearing which one could venture\noutside the car even when it was beyond the atmosphere of the earth.\n\n\nTerrific Cold Anticipated.\n\nProvision had been made to meet the terrific cold which we knew would\nbe encountered the moment we had passed beyond the atmosphere--that\nawful absolute zero which men had measured by anticipation, but never\nyet experienced--by a simple system of producing within the air-tight\nsuits a temperature sufficiently elevated to counteract the effects of\nthe frigidity without. By means of long, flexible tubes, air could be\ncontinually supplied to the wearers of the suits, and by an ingenious\ncontrivance a store of compressed air sufficient to last for several hours\nwas provided for each suit, so that in case of necessity the wearer could\nthrow off the tubes connecting him with the air tanks in the car. Another\nobject which had been kept in view in the preparation of these suits\nwas the possible exploration of an airless planet, such as the moon.\n\nThe necessity of some contrivance by means of which we should be enabled\nto converse with one another when on the outside of the cars in open\nspace, or when in an airless world, like the moon, where there would be\nno medium by which the waves of sound could be conveyed as they are in\nthe atmosphere of the earth, had been foreseen by our great inventor,\nand he had not found it difficult to contrive suitable devices for\nmeeting the emergency.\n\nInside the headpiece of each of the electrical suits was the mouthpiece\nof a telephone. This was connected with a wire which, when not in use,\ncould be conveniently coiled upon the arm of the wearer. Near the ears,\nsimilarly connected with wires, were telephonic receivers.\n\n\nAn Aerial Telegraph.\n\nWhen two persons wearing the air-tight dresses wished to converse with\none another it was only necessary for them to connect themselves by the\nwires, and conversation could then be easily carried on.\n\nCareful calculations of the precise distance of Mars from the earth at the\ntime when the expedition was to start had been made by a large number of\nexperts in mathematical astronomy. But it was not Mr. Edison's intention\nto go direct to Mars. With the exception of the first electrical ship,\nwhich he had completed, none had yet been tried in a long voyage. It\nwas desirable that the qualities of each of the ships should first\nbe carefully tested, and for this reason the leader of the expedition\ndetermined that the moon should be the first port of space at which the\nsquadron would call.\n\nIt chanced that the moon was so situated at this time as to be nearly\nin a line between the earth and Mars, which latter was in opposition\nto the sun, and consequently as favorably situated as possible for\nthe purposes of the voyage. What would be, then, for 99 out of the 100\nships of the squadron, a trial trip would at the same time be a step of\na quarter of a million of miles gained in the direction of our journey,\nand so no time would be wasted.\n\nThe departure from the earth was arranged to occur precisely at\nmidnight. The moon near the full was hanging high over head, and a\nmarvellous spectacle was presented to the eyes of those below as the\ngreat squadron of floating ships, with their signal lights ablaze,\ncast loose and began slowly to move away on their adventurous and\nunprecedented expedition into the great unknown. A tremendous cheer,\nbillowing up from the throats of millions of excited men and women,\nseemed to rend the curtain of the night, and made the airships tremble\nwith the atmospheric vibrations that were set in motion.\n\n\nMagnificent Fireworks.\n\nInstantly magnificent fireworks were displayed in honor of our\ndeparture. Rockets by hundreds of thousands shot heaven-ward, and then\nburst in constellations of fiery drops. The sudden illumination thus\nproduced, overspreading hundreds of square miles of the surface of the\nearth with a light almost like that of day, must certainly have been\nvisible to the inhabitants of Mars, if they were watching us at the\ntime. They might, or might not, correctly interpret its significance;\nbut, at any rate, we did not care. We were off, and were confident that\nwe could meet our enemy on his own ground before he could attack us again.\n\n\nAnd the Earth Was Like a Globe.\n\nAnd now, as we slowly rose higher, a marvellous scene was disclosed. At\nfirst the earth beneath us, buried as it was in night, resembled\nthe hollow of a vast cup of ebony blackness, in the centre of which,\nlike the molten lava run together at the bottom of a volcanic crater,\nshone the light of the illuminations around New York. But when we got\nbeyond the atmosphere, and the earth still continued to recede below us,\nits aspect changed. The cup-shaped appearance was gone, and it began to\nround out beneath our eyes in the form of a vast globe--an enormous ball\nmysteriously suspended under us, glimmering over most of its surface,\nwith the faint illumination of the moon, and showing toward its eastern\nedge the oncoming light of the rising sun.\n\nWhen we were still further away, having slightly varied our course so\nthat the sun was once more entirely hidden behind the centre of the\nearth, we saw its atmosphere completely illuminated, all around it,\nwith prismatic lights, like a gigantic rainbow in the form of a ring.\n\nAnother shift in our course rapidly carried us out of the shadow of\nthe earth and into the all pervading sunshine. Then the great planet\nbeneath us hung unspeakable in its beauty. The outlines of several of\nthe continents were clearly discernible on its surface, streaked and\nspotted with delicate shades of varying color, and the sunlight flashed\nand glowed in long lanes across the convex surface of the oceans. Parallel\nwith the Equator and along the regions of the ever blowing trade winds,\nwere vast belts of clouds, gorgeous with crimson and purple as the\nsunlight fell upon them. Immense expanses of snow and ice lay like a\nglittering garment upon both land and sea around the North Pole.\n\n\nFarewell To This Terrestrial Sphere.\n\nAs we gazed upon this magnificent spectacle, our hearts bounded within\nus. This was our earth--this was the planet we were going to defend--our\nhome in the trackless wilderness of space. And it seemed to us indeed a\nhome for which we might gladly expend our last breath. A new determination\nto conquer or die sprung up in our hearts, and I saw Lord Kelvin, after\ngazing at the beauteous scene which the earth presented through his\neyeglass, turn about and peer in the direction in which we knew that Mars\nlay, with a sudden frown that caused the glass to lose its grip and fall\ndangling from its string upon his breast. Even Mr. Edison seemed moved.\n\n\"I am glad I thought of the disintegrator,\" he said. \"I shouldn't like\nto see that world down there laid waste again.\"\n\n\"And it won't be,\" said Professor Sylvanus P. Thompson, gripping the\nhandle of an electric machine, \"not if we can help it.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter V.\n\n\nTo prevent accidents, it had been arranged that the ships should keep a\nconsiderable distance apart. Some of them gradually drifted away, until,\non account of the neutral tint of their sides, they were swallowed up\nin the abyss of space. Still it was possible to know where every member\nof the squadron was through the constant interchange of signals. These,\nas I have explained, were effected by means of mirrors flashing back\nthe light of the sun.\n\nBut, although it was now unceasing day for us, yet, there being no\natmosphere to diffuse the sun's light, the stars were visible to us just\nas at night upon the earth, and they shone with extraordinary splendor\nagainst the intense black background of the firmament. The lights of\nsome of the more distant ships of our squadron were not brighter than\nthe stars in whose neighborhood they seemed to be. In some cases it was\nonly possible to distinguish between the light of a ship and that of\na star by the fact that the former was continually flashing while the\nstar was steady in its radiance.\n\n\nAn Uncanny Effect.\n\nThe most uncanny effect was produced by the absence of atmosphere around\nus. Inside the car, where there was air, the sunlight, streaming through\none or more of the windows, was diffused and produced ordinary daylight.\n\nBut when we ventured outside we could only see things by halves. The\nside of the car that the sun's rays touched was visible, the other side\nwas invisible, the light from the stars not making it bright enough to\naffect the eye in contrast with the sun-illumined half.\n\nAs I held up my arm before my eyes, half of it seemed to be shaved\noff lengthwise; a companion on the deck of the ship looked like half\na man. So the other electrical ships near us appeared as half ships,\nonly the illuminated sides being visible.\n\nWe had now got so far away that the earth had taken on the appearance\nof a heavenly body like the moon. Its colors had become all blended\ninto a golden-reddish hue, which overspread nearly its entire surface,\nexcept at the poles, where there were broad patches of white. It was\nmarvellous to look at this huge orb behind us, while far beyond it shone\nthe blazing sun like an enormous star in the blackest of nights. In the\nopposite direction appeared the silver orb of the moon, and scattered\nall around were millions of brilliant stars, amid which, like fireflies,\nflashed and sparkled the signal lights of the squadron.\n\n\nDanger Manifests Itself.\n\nA danger that might easily have been anticipated, that perhaps had been\nanticipated, but against which it would have been difficult, if not\nimpossible, to provide, presently manifested itself.\n\nLooking out of a window toward the right, I suddenly noticed the\nlights of a distant ship darting about in a curious curve. Instantly\nafterward another member of the squadron, nearer by, behaved in the same\ninexplicable manner. Then two or three of the floating cars seemed to be\nviolently drawn from their courses and hurried rapidly in the direction\nof the flagship. Immediately I perceived a small object, luridly flaming,\nwhich seemed to move with immense speed in our direction.\n\nThe truth instantly flashed upon my mind, and I shouted to the other\noccupants of the car:\n\n\nStruck By A Meteor!\n\n\"A meteor!\"\n\nAnd such indeed it was. We had met this mysterious wanderer in space\nat a moment when we were moving in a direction at right angles to the\npath it was pursuing around the sun. Small as it was, and its diameter\nprobably did not exceed a single foot, it was yet an independent little\nworld, and as such a member of the solar system. Its distance from\nthe sun being so near that of the earth, I knew that its velocity,\nassuming it to be travelling in a nearly circular orbit, must be about\neighteen miles in a second. With this velocity, then, it plunged like a\nprojectile shot by some mysterious enemy in space directly through our\nsquadron. It had come and was gone before one could utter a sentence\nof three words. Its appearance, and the effect it had produced upon the\nships in whose neighborhood it passed, indicated that it bore an intense\nand tremendous charge of electricity. How it had become thus charged\nI cannot pretend to say. I simply record the fact. And this charge,\nit was evident, was opposite in polarity to that which the ships of the\nsquadron bore. It therefore exerted an attractive influence upon them\nand thus drew them after it.\n\nI had just time to think how lucky it was that the meteor did not\nstrike any of us, when, glancing at a ship just ahead, I perceived that\nan accident had occurred. The ship swayed violently from its course,\ndazzling flashes played around it, and two or three of the men forming\nits crew appeared for an instant on its exterior, wildly gesticulating,\nbut almost instantly falling prone.\n\nIt was evident at a glance that the car had been struck by the meteor. How\nserious the damage might be we could not instantly determine. The course\nof our ship was immediately altered, the electric polarity was changed,\nand we rapidly approached the disabled car.\n\nThe men who had fallen lay upon its surface. One of the heavy circular\nglasses covering a window had been smashed to atoms. Through this the\nmeteor had passed, killing two or three men who stood in its course. Then\nit had crashed through the opposite side of the car, and, passing on,\ndisappeared into space. The store of air contained in the car had\nimmediately rushed out through the openings, and when two or three of\nus, having donned our air-tight suits as quickly as possible, entered\nthe wrecked car we found all its inmates stretched upon the floor in\na condition of asphyxiation. They, as well as those who lay upon the\nexterior, were immediately removed to the flagship, restoratives were\napplied, and, fortunately, our aid had come so promptly that the lives\nof all of them were saved. But life had fled from the mangled bodies of\nthose who had stood directly in the path of the fearful projectile.\n\nThis strange accident had been witnessed by several of the members\nof the fleet, and they quickly drew together, in order to inquire for\nthe particulars. As the flagship was now overcrowded by the addition\nof so many men to its crew, Mr. Edison had them distributed among the\nother cars. Fortunately it happened that the disintegrators contained\nin the wrecked car were not injured. Mr. Edison thought that it would\nbe possible to repair the car itself, and for that purpose he had it\nattached to the flagship in order that it might be carried on as far as\nthe moon. The bodies of the dead were transported with it, as it was\ndetermined, instead of committing them to the fearful deep of space,\nwhere they would have wandered forever, or else have fallen like meteors\nupon the earth, to give them interment in the lunar soil.\n\n\nNearing the Moon.\n\nAs we now rapidly approached the moon the change which the appearance of\nits surface underwent was no less wonderful than that which the surface of\nthe earth had presented in the reverse order while we were receding from\nit. From a pale silver orb, shining with comparative faintness among the\nstars, it slowly assumed the appearance of a vast mountainous desert. As\nwe drew nearer its colors became more pronounced; the great flat regions\nappeared darker; the mountain peaks shone more brilliantly. The huge\nchasms seemed bottomless and blacker than midnight. Gradually separate\nmountains appeared. What seemed like expanses of snow and immense\nglaciers streaming down their sides sparkled with great brilliancy in the\nperpendicular rays of the sun. Our motion had now assumed the aspect of\nfalling. We seemed to be dropping from an immeasurable height and with\nan inconceivable velocity, straight down upon those giant peaks.\n\n\nThe Mountains of Luna.\n\nHere and there curious lights glowed upon the mysterious surface of the\nmoon. Where the edge of the moon cut the sky behind it, it was broken and\njagged with mountain masses. Vast crater rings overspread its surface,\nand in some of these I imagined I could perceive a lurid illumination\ncoming out of their deepest cavities, and the curling of mephitic vapors\naround their terrible jaws.\n\nWe were approaching that part of the moon which is known to astronomers as\nthe Bay of Rainbows. Here a huge semi-circular region, as smooth almost\nas the surface of a prairie, lay beneath our eyes, stretching southward\ninto a vast ocean-like expanse, while on the north it was enclosed by an\nenormous range of mountain cliffs, rising perpendicularly to a height\nof many thousands of feet, and rent and gashed in every direction by\nforces which seemed at some remote period to have labored at tearing\nthis little world in pieces.\n\n\nA Dead And Mangled World.\n\nThe Moon's Strange and Ghastly Surface in Full View of Man.\n\nIt was a fearful spectacle; a dead and mangled world, too dreadful to\nlook upon. The idea of the death of the moon was, of course, not a new\none to many of us. We had long been aware that the earth's satellite\nwas a body which had passed beyond the stage of life, if indeed it had\never been a life supporting globe; but none of us were prepared for the\nterrible spectacle which now smote our eyes.\n\nAt each end of the semi-circular ridge that encloses the Bay of Rainbows\nthere is a lofty promontory. That at the north-western extremity had\nlong been known to astronomers under the name of Cape Laplace. The other\npromontory, at the southeastern termination, is called Cape Heraclides. It\nwas toward the latter that we were approaching, and by interchange of\nsignals all the members of the squadron had been informed that Cape\nHeraclides was to be our rendezvous upon the moon.\n\nI may say that I had been somewhat familiar with the scenery of this\npart of the lunar world, for I had often studied it from the earth with a\ntelescope, and I had thought that if there was any part of the moon where\none might, with fair expectation of success, look for inhabitants, or if\nnot for inhabitants, at least for relics of life no longer existent there,\nthis would surely be the place. It was, therefore, with no small degree\nof curiosity, notwithstanding the unexpectedly frightful and repulsive\nappearance that the surface of the moon presented, that I now saw myself\nrapidly approaching the region concerning whose secrets my imagination\nhad so often busied itself. When Mr. Edison and I had paid our previous\nvisit to the moon on the first experimental trip of the electrical ship,\nwe had landed at a point on its surface remote from this, and, as I have\nbefore explained, we then made no effort to investigate its secrets. But\nnow it was to be different, and we were at length to see something of\nthe wonders of the moon.\n\n\nLike a Human Face.\n\nI had often on the earth drawn a smile from my friends by showing them\nCape Heraclides with a telescope, and calling their attention to the\nfact that the outline of the peak terminating the cape was such as\nto present a remarkable resemblance to a human face, unmistakably a\nfeminine countenance, seen in profile, and possessing no small degree of\nbeauty. To my astonishment, this curious human semblance still remained\nwhen we had approached so close to the moon that the mountains forming\nthe cape filled nearly the whole field of view of the window from which\nI was watching it. The resemblance, indeed, was most startling.\n\n\nThe Resemblance Disappears.\n\n\"Can this indeed be Diana herself?\" I said half aloud, but instantly\nafterward I was laughing at my fancy, for Mr. Edison had overheard me\nand exclaimed, \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Diana.\"\n\n\"Why, there,\" I said, pointing to the moon. But lo! the appearance was\ngone even while I spoke. A swift change had taken place in the line\nof sight by which we were viewing it, and the likeness had disappeared\nin consequence.\n\nA few moments later my astonishment was revived, but the cause this\ntime was a very different one. We had been dropping rapidly toward the\nmountains, and the electrician in charge of the car was swiftly and\nconstantly changing his potential, and, like a pilot who feels his way\ninto an unknown harbor, endeavoring to approach the moon in such a manner\nthat no hidden peril should surprise us. As we thus approached I suddenly\nperceived, crowning the very apex of the lofty peak near the termination\nof the cape, the ruins of what appeared to be an ancient watch tower. It\nwas evidently composed of Cyclopean blocks larger than any that I had\never seen even among the ruins of Greece, Egypt and Asia Minor.\n\n\nThe Moon Was Inhabited.\n\nHere, then, was visible proof that the moon had been inhabited, although\nprobably it was not inhabited now. I cannot describe the exultant feeling\nwhich took possession of me at this discovery. It settled so much that\nlearned men had been disputing about for centuries.\n\n\"What will they say,\" I exclaimed, \"when I show them a photograph\nof that?\"\n\nBelow the peak, stretching far to right and left, lay a barren beach\nwhich had evidently once been washed by sea waves, because it was marked\nby long curved ridges such as the advancing and retiring tide leaves\nupon the shore of the ocean.\n\nThis beach sloped rapidly outward and downward toward a profound abyss,\nwhich had once, evidently, been the bed of a sea, but which now appeared\nto us simply as the empty, yawning shell of an ocean that had long\nvanished.\n\nIt was with no small difficulty, and only after the expenditure of\nconsiderable time, that all the floating ships of the squadron were\ngradually brought to rest on this lone mountain top of the moon. In\naccordance with my request, Mr. Edison had the flagship moored in the\ninterior of the great ruined watch tower that I have described. The\nother ships rested upon the slope of the mountain around us.\n\nAlthough time pressed, for we knew that the safety of the earth depended\nupon our promptness in attacking Mars, yet it was determined to remain\nhere at least two or three days in order that the wrecked car might be\nrepaired. It was found also that the passage of the highly electrified\nmeteor had disarranged the electrical machinery in some of the other\ncars, so that there were many repairs to be made besides those needed\nto restore the wreck.\n\nBurying the Dead.\n\nMoreover, we must bury our unfortunate companions who had been killed by\nthe meteor. This, in fact, was the first work that we performed. Strange\nwas the sight, and stranger our feelings, as here on the surface of a\nworld distant from the earth, and on soil which had never before been\npressed by the foot of man, we performed that last ceremony of respect\nwhich mortals pay to mortality. In the ancient beach at the foot of the\npeak we made a deep opening, and there covered forever the faces of our\nfriends, leaving them to sleep among the ruins of empires, and among\nthe graves of races which had vanished probably ages before Adam and\nEve appeared in Paradise.\n\nWhile the repairs were being made several scientific expeditions were\nsent out in various directions across the moon. One went westward to\ninvestigate the great ring plain of Plato, and the lunar Alps. Another\ncrossed the ancient Sea of Showers toward the lunar Apennines.\n\nOne started to explore the immense crater of Copernicus, which, yawning\nfifty miles across, presents a wonderful appearance even from the distance\nof the earth. The ship in which I, myself, had the good fortune to embark,\nwas bound for the mysterious lunar mountain Aristarchus.\n\nBefore these expeditions started, a careful exploration had been made in\nthe neighborhood of Cape Heraclides. But, except that the broken walls\nof the watch tower on the peak, composed of blocks of enormous size,\nhad evidently been the work of creatures endowed with human intelligence,\nno remains were found indicating the former presence of inhabitants upon\nthis part of the moon.\n\n\nA Gigantic Human Footprint.\n\nBut along the shore of the old sea, just where the so-called Bay of\nRainbows separates itself from the abyss of the Sea of Showers, there\nwere found some stratified rocks in which the fascinated eyes of the\nexplorer beheld the clear imprint of a gigantic human foot, measuring\nfive feet in length from toe to heel.\n\n\nDetailing the Marvellous Adventures of the Earth's Warriors in\nUnknown Worlds.\n\nThe most minute search failed to reveal another trace of the presence\nof the ancient giant, who had left the impress of his foot in the wet\nsands of the beach here so many millions of years ago that even the\nimagination of the geologists shrank from the task of attempting to fix\nthe precise period.\n\n\nThe Great Footprint.\n\nAround this gigantic footprint gathered most of the scientific members\nof the expedition, wearing their oddly shaped air-tight suits, connected\nwith telephonic wires, and the spectacle, but for the impressiveness of\nthe discovery, would have been laughable in the extreme. Bending over\nthe mark in the rock, nodding their heads together, pointing with their\nawkwardly accoutred arms, they looked like an assemblage of antediluvian\nmonsters collected around their prey. Their disappointment over the\nfact that no other marks of anything resembling human habitation could\nbe discovered was very great.\n\nStill this footprint in itself was quite sufficient, as they all declared,\nto settle the question of the former inhabitation of the moon, and it\nwould serve for the production of many a learned volume after their\nreturn to the earth, even if no further discoveries should be made in\nother parts of the lunar world.\n\n\nExpeditions Over the Moon.\n\nIt was the hope of making such other discoveries that led to the dispatch\nof the other various expeditions which I have already named. I had chosen\nto accompany the car that was going to Aristarchus, because, as every one\nwho had viewed the moon from the earth was aware, there was something very\nmysterious about that mountain. I knew that it was a crater nearly thirty\nmiles in diameter and very deep, although its floor was plainly visible.\n\n\nThe Glowing Mountains.\n\nWhat rendered it remarkable was the fact that the floor and the walls of\nthe crater, particularly on the inner side, glowed with a marvellous\nbrightness which rendered them almost blinding when viewed with a\npowerful telescope.\n\nSo bright were they, indeed, that the eye was unable to see many of the\ndetails which the telescope would have made visible but for the flood\nof light which poured from the mountains. Sir William Herschel had been\nso completely misled by this appearance that he supposed he was watching\na lunar volcano in eruption.\n\nIt had always been a difficult question what caused the extraordinary\nluminosity of Aristarchus. No end of hypotheses had been invented to\naccount for it. Now I was to assist in settling these questions forever.\n\nFrom Cape Heraclides to Aristarchus the distance in an air line was\nsomething over 300 miles. Our course lay across the north-eastern part\nof the Sea of Showers, with enormous cliffs, mountain masses and peaks\nshining on the right, while in the other direction the view was bounded by\nthe distant range of the lunar Apennines, some of whose towering peaks,\nwhen viewed from our immense elevation, appeared as sharp as the Swiss\nMatterhorn.\n\nWhen we had arrived within about a hundred miles of our destination\nwe found ourselves floating directly over the so-called Harbinger\nMountains. The serrated peaks of Aristarchus then appeared ahead of us,\nfairly blazing in the sunshine.\n\n\nA Gigantic String Of Diamonds.\n\nIt seemed as if a gigantic string of diamonds, every one as great as\na mountain peak, had been cast down upon the barren surface of the\nmoon and left to waste their brilliance upon the desert air of this\nabandoned world.\n\nAs we rapidly approached, the dazzling splendor of the mountain became\nalmost unbearable to our eyes, and we were compelled to resort to the\ndevice, practiced by all climbers of lofty mountains, where the glare\nof sunlight upon snow surfaces is liable to cause temporary blindness,\nof protecting our eyes with neutral-tinted glasses.\n\nProfessor Moissan, the great French chemist and maker of artificial\ndiamonds, fairly danced with delight.\n\n\"Voila! Voila! Voila!\" was all that he could say.\n\n\nA Mountain of Crystals.\n\nWhen we were comparatively near, the mountain no longer seemed to glow\nwith a uniform radiance, evenly distributed over its entire surface,\nbut now innumerable points of light, all as bright as so many little\nsuns, blazed away at us. It was evident that we had before us a mountain\ncomposed of, or at least covered with, crystals.\n\nWithout stopping to alight on the outer slopes of the great ring-shaped\nrange of peaks which composed Aristarchus, we sailed over their rim and\nlooked down into the interior. Here the splendor of the crystals was\ngreater than on the outer slopes, and the broad floor of the crater,\nthousands of feet beneath us, shone and sparkled with overwhelming\nradiance, as if it were an immense bin of diamonds, while a peak in the\ncentre flamed like a stupendous tiara incrusted with selected gems.\n\nEager to see what these crystals were, the car was now allowed rapidly\nto drop into the interior of the crater. With great caution we brought\nit to rest upon the blazing ground, for the sharp edges of the crystals\nwould certainly have torn the metallic sides of the car if it had come\ninto violent contact with them.\n\nDonning our air-tight suits and stepping carefully out upon this\nwonderful footing we attempted to detach some of the crystals. Many of\nthem were firmly fastened, but a few--some of astonishing size--were\nreadily loosened.\n\n\nA Wealth of Gems.\n\nA moment's inspection showed that we had stumbled upon the most\nmarvellous work of the forces of crystallization that human eyes had\never rested upon. Some time in the past history of the moon there had\nbeen an enormous outflow of molten material from the crater. This had\noverspread the walls and partially filled up the interior, and later its\nsurface had flowered into gems, as thick as blossoms in a bed of pansies.\n\nThe whole mass flashed prismatic rays of indescribable beauty and\nintensity. We gazed at first speechless with amazement.\n\n\"It cannot be, surely it cannot be,\" said Professor Moissan at length.\n\n\"But it is,\" said another member of the party.\n\n\"Are these diamonds?\" asked a third.\n\n\"I cannot yet tell,\" replied the Professor. \"They have the brilliancy\nof diamonds, but they may be something else.\"\n\n\"Moon jewels,\" suggested a third.\n\n\"And worth untold millions, whatever they are,\" remarked another.\n\n\nJewels from the Moon.\n\nThese magnificent crystals, some of which appeared to be almost flawless,\nvaried in size from the dimensions of a hazelnut to geometrical solids\nseveral inches in diameter. We carefully selected as many as it was\nconvenient to carry and placed them in the car for future examination. We\nhad solved another long standing lunar problem and had, perhaps, opened\nup an inexhaustible mine of wealth which might eventually go far toward\nreimbursing the earth for the damage which it had suffered from the\ninvasion of the Martians.\n\nOn returning to Cape Heraclides we found that the other expeditions\nhad arrived at the rendezvous ahead of us. Their members had wonderful\nstories to tell of what they had seen, but nothing caused quite so much\nastonishment as that which we had to tell and to show.\n\nThe party which had gone to visit Plato and the lunar Alps brought back,\nhowever, information which, in a scientific sense, was no less interesting\nthan what we had been able to gather.\n\nThey had found within this curious ring of Plato, which is a circle of\nmountains sixty miles in diameter, enclosing a level plain remarkably\nsmooth over most of its surface, unmistakable evidences of former\ninhabitation. A gigantic city had evidently at one time existed near\nthe centre of this great plain. The outlines of its walls and the\nfoundation marks of some of its immense buildings were plainly made out,\nand elaborate plans of this vanished capital of the moon were prepared\nby several members of the party.\n\n\nMore Evidences of Habitation.\n\nOne of them was fortunate enough to discover an even more precious\nrelic of the ancient lunarians. It was a piece of petrified skullbone,\nrepresenting but a small portion of the head to which it had belonged,\nbut yet sufficient to enable the anthropologists, who immediately fell\nto examining it, to draw ideal representations of the head as it must\nhave been in life--the head of a giant of enormous size, which, if it\nhad possessed a highly organized brain, of proportionate magnitude,\nmust have given to its possessor intellectual powers immensely greater\nthan any of the descendants of Adam have ever been endowed with.\n\n\nGiants in Size.\n\nIndeed, one of the professors was certain that some little concretions\nfound on the interior of the piece of skull were petrified portions\nof the brain matter itself, and he set to work with the microscope to\nexamine its organic quality.\n\nIn the mean time, the repairs to the electrical ships had been completed,\nand, although these discoveries upon the moon had created a most profound\nsensation among the members of the expedition, and aroused an almost\nirresistible desire to continue the explorations thus happily begun,\nyet everybody knew that these things were aside from the main purpose in\nview, and that we should be false to our duty in wasting a moment more\nupon the moon than was absolutely necessary to put the ships in proper\ncondition to proceed on their warlike voyage.\n\n\nDeparting from the Moon.\n\nEverything being prepared then, we left the moon with great regret, just\nforty-eight hours after we had landed upon its surface, carrying with us\na determination to revisit it and to learn more of its wonderful secrets\nin case we should survive the dangers which we were now going to face.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI.\n\n\nA day or two after leaving the moon we had another adventure with a\nwandering inhabitant of space which brought us into far greater peril\nthan had our encounter with the meteor.\n\nThe airships had been partitioned off so that a portion of the interior\ncould be darkened in order to serve as a sleeping chamber, wherein,\naccording to the regulations prescribed by the commander of the squadron\neach member of the expedition in his turn passed eight out of every\ntwenty-four hours--sleeping if he could, if not, meditating, in a more\nor less dazed way, upon the wonderful things that he was seeing and\ndoing--things far more incredible than the creations of a dream.\n\nOne morning, if I may call by the name morning the time of my periodical\nemergence from the darkened chamber, glancing from one of the windows,\nI was startled to see in the black sky a brilliant comet.\n\n\nThe Adventure With The Comet.\n\nA Thrilling Story of an Encounter that Nearly Ended the Great\nExpedition.\n\nNo periodical comet, as I knew, was at this time approaching the\nneighborhood of the sun, and no stranger of that kind had been\ndetected from the observatories making its way sunward before we left\nthe earth. Here, however, was unmistakably a comet rushing toward the\nsun, flinging out a great gleaming tail behind it and so close to us\nthat I wondered to see it remaining almost motionless in the sky. This\nphenomenon was soon explained to me, and the explanation was of a most\ndisquieting character.\n\nThe stranger had already been perceived, not only from the flagship, but\nfrom the other members of the squadron, and, as I now learned, efforts\nhad been made to get out of the neighborhood, but for some reason the\nelectrical apparatus did not work perfectly--some mysterious disturbing\nforce acting upon it--and so it had been found impossible to avoid an\nencounter with the comet, not an actual coming into contact with it,\nbut a falling into the sphere of its influence.\n\n\nIn the Wake of the Comet.\n\nIn fact, I was informed that for several hours the squadron had been\ndragging along in the wake of a comet, very much as boats are sometimes\ntowed off by a wounded whale. Every effort had been made to so adjust\nthe electric charge upon the ships that they would be repelled from the\ncometic mass, but, owing apparently to eccentric changes continually\ngoing on in the electric charge affecting the clashing mass of meteoric\nbodies which constituted the head of the comet, we found it impossible\nto escape from its influence.\n\nAt one instant the ships would be repelled; immediately afterward they\nwould be attracted again, and thus they were dragged hither and thither,\nbut never able to break from the invisible leash which the comet had\ncast upon them. The latter was moving with enormous velocity toward\nthe sun, and, consequently, we were being carried back again, away from\nthe object of our expedition, with a fair prospect of being dissipated\nin blazing vapors when the comet had dragged us, unwilling prisoners,\ninto the immediate neighborhood of the solar furnace.\n\nEven the most cool-headed lost his self-control in this terrible\nemergency. Every kind of device that experience or the imagination\ncould suggest was tried, but nothing would do. Still on we rushed with\nthe electrified atoms composing the tail of the comet sweeping to and\nfro over the members of the squadron, as they shifted their position,\nlike the plume of smoke from a gigantic steamer, drifting over the sea\nbirds that follow in its course.\n\n\nIs This the End?\n\nWas this to end it all, then? Was this the fate that Providence had\nin store for us? Were the hopes of the earth thus to perish? Was the\nexpedition to be wrecked and its fate to remain forever unknown to the\nplanet from which it had set forth? And was our beloved globe, which had\nseemed so fair to us when we last looked upon it near by, and in whose\ndefence we had resolved to spend our last breath, to be left helpless\nand at the mercy of its implacable foe in the sky?\n\nAt length we gave ourselves up for lost. There seemed to be no possible\nway to free ourselves from the baleful grip of this terrible and\nunlooked-for enemy.\n\n\nGiving Up All Hope.\n\nAs the comet approached the sun its electric energy rapidly increased,\nand watching it with telescopes, for we could not withdraw our fascinated\neyes from it, we could clearly behold the fearful things that went on\nin its nucleus.\n\nThis consisted of an immense number of separate meteors of no very great\nsize individually, but which were in constant motion among one another,\ndarting to and fro, clashing and smashing together, while fountains of\nblazing metallic particles and hot mineral vapors poured out in every\ndirection.\n\n\nA Flying Hell.\n\nAs I watched it, unable to withdraw my eyes, I saw imaginary forms\nrevealing themselves amid the flaming meteors. They seemed like creatures\nin agony, tossing their arms, bewailing in their attitudes the awful fate\nthat had overtaken them, and fairly chilling my blood with the pantomime\nof torture which they exhibited. I thought of an old superstition which\nI had often heard about the earth, and exclaimed: \"Yes, surely, this is\na flying hell!\"\n\nAs the electric activity of the comet increased, its continued changes\nof potential and polarity became more frequent, and the electrical ships\ndarted about with even greater confusion than before. Occasionally one\nof them, seized with a sudden impulse, would spring forward toward the\nnucleus of the comet with a sudden access of velocity that would fling\nevery one of its crew from his feet, and all would lie sprawling on\nthe floor of the car while it rushed, as it seemed, to inevitable and\ninstant destruction.\n\n\nSaved on Ruin's Brink.\n\nThen, either through the frantic efforts of the electrician struggling\nwith the controller or through another change in the polarity of the\ncomet, the ship would be saved on the very brink of ruin and stagger\naway out of immediate danger.\n\nThus the captured squadron was swept, swaying and darting hither and\nthither, but never able to get sufficiently far from the comet to break\nthe bond of its fatal attraction.\n\n\nThe Earth Again!\n\nSo great was our excitement and so complete our absorption in the fearful\nperil that we had not noticed the precise direction in which the comet\nwas carrying us. It was enough to know that the goal of the journey was\nthe furnace of the sun. But presently someone in the flagship recalled\nus to a more accurate sense of our situation in space by exclaiming:\n\n\"Why, there is the earth!\"\n\n\nThrilling Adventures Crowd Each Other In the Great War Upon Mars.\n\nAnd there, indeed, it was, its great globe rolling under our eyes, with\nthe contrasted colors of the continents and clouds and the watery gleam\nof the ocean spread beneath us.\n\n\"We are going to strike it!\" exclaimed somebody. \"The comet is going to\ndash into the earth.\"\n\nSuch a collision at first seemed inevitable, but presently it was noticed\nthat the direction of the comet's motion was such that while it might\ngraze the earth it would not actually strike it.\n\nAnd so, like a swarm of giant insects circling about an electric light\nfrom whose magic influence they cannot escape, our ships went on, to be\nwhipped against the earth in passing and then to continue their swift\njourney to destruction.\n\n\nUnexpected Aid.\n\n\"Thank God, this saves us,\" suddenly cried Mr. Edison.\n\n\"What--what?\"\n\n\"Why, the earth, of course. Do you not see that as the comet sweeps\nclose to the great planet the superior attraction of the latter will\nsnatch us from its grasp, and that thus we shall be able to escape?\"\n\nAnd it was indeed as Mr. Edison had predicted. In a blaze of falling\nmeteors the comet swept the outer limits of the earth's atmosphere and\npassed on, while the swaying ships, having been instructed by signals\nwhat to do, desperately applied their electrical machinery to reverse\nthe attraction and threw themselves into the arms of their mother earth.\n\n\nOver the Atlantic.\n\nIn another instant we were all free, settling down through the quiet\natmosphere with the Atlantic Ocean sparkling in the morning sun far below.\n\nWe looked at one another in amazement. So this was the end of our\nvoyage! This was the completion of our warlike enterprise. We had started\nout to conquer a world, and we had come back ignominiously dragged in\nthe train of a comet.\n\nThe earth which we were going to defend and protect had herself turned\nprotector, and reaching out her strong arm had snatched her foolish\nchildren from the destruction which they had invited.\n\nIt would be impossible to describe the chagrin of every member of the\nexpedition.\n\n\nA Feeling of Shame.\n\nThe electric ships rapidly assembled and hovered high in the air,\nwhile their commanders consulted about what should be done. A universal\nfeeling of shame almost drove them to a decision not to land upon the\nsurface of the planet, and if possible not to let its inhabitants know\nwhat had occurred.\n\nBut it was too late for that. Looking carefully beneath us, we saw\nthat fate had brought us back to our very starting point, and signals\ndisplayed in the neighborhood of New York indicated that we had already\nbeen recognized. There was nothing for us then but to drop down and\nexplain the situation.\n\nI shall not delay my narrative by undertaking to describe the astonishment\nand the disappointment of the inhabitants of the earth when, within a\nfortnight from our departure, they saw us back again, with no laurels\nof victory crowning our brows.\n\nAt first they had hoped that we were returning in triumph, and we were\noverwhelmed with questions the moment we had dropped within speaking\ndistance.\n\n\"Have you whipped them?\"\n\n\"How many are lost?\"\n\n\"Is there any more danger?\"\n\n\"Faix, have ye got one of thim men from Mars?\"\n\nBut their rejoicings and their facetiousness were turned into wailing\nwhen the truth was imparted.\n\n\nA Short Stay on the Earth.\n\nWe made a short story of it, for we had not the heart to go into\ndetails. We told of our unfortunate comrades whom we had buried on the\nmoon, and there was one gleam of satisfaction when we exhibited the\nwonderful crystals we had collected in the crater of Aristarchus.\n\nMr. Edison determined to stop only long enough to test the electrical\nmachinery of the cars, which had been more or less seriously deranged\nduring our wild chase after the comet, and then to start straight back\nfor Mars--this time on a through trip.\n\n\nMysterious Lights on Mars.\n\nThe astronomers, who had been watching Mars, since our departure, with\ntheir telescopes, reported that mysterious lights continued to be visible,\nbut that nothing indicating the starting of another expedition for the\nearth had been seen.\n\nWithin twenty-four hours we were ready for our second start.\n\nThe moon was now no longer in a position to help us on our way. It had\nmoved out of the line between Mars and the earth.\n\nHigh above us, in the centre of the heavens, glowed the red planet which\nwas the goal of our journey.\n\nThe needed computations of velocity and direction of flight having\nbeen repeated, and the ships being all in readiness, we started direct\nfor Mars.\n\n\nGreater Preparations Made.\n\nAn enormous charge of electricity was imparted to each member of the\nsquadron, in order that as soon as we had reached the upper limits of\nthe atmosphere, where the ships could move swiftly, without danger of\nbeing consumed by the heat developed by the friction of their passage\nthrough the air, a very great initial velocity could be imparted.\n\nOnce started off by this tremendous electrical kick, and with no\natmosphere to resist our motion, we should be able to retain the same\nvelocity, barring incidental encounters, until we arrived near the\nsurface of Mars.\n\nWhen we were free of the atmosphere, and the ships were moving away\nfrom the earth, with the highest velocity which we were able to impart\nto them, observations on the stars were made in order to determine the\nrate of our speed.\n\n\nTen Miles A Second!\n\nThis was found to be ten miles in a second, or 864,000 miles in a day, a\nvery much greater speed than that with which we had travelled on starting\nto touch at the moon. Supposing this velocity to remain uniform, and, with\nno known resistance, it might reasonably be expected to do so, we should\narrive at Mars in a little less than forty-two days, the distance of the\nplanet from the earth being, at this time, about thirty-six million miles.\n\nNothing occurred for many days to interrupt our journey. We became\naccustomed to our strange surroundings, and many entertainments were\nprovided to while away the time. The astronomers in the expedition found\nplenty of occupation in studying the aspects of the stars and the other\nheavenly bodies from their new point of view.\n\n\nDrawing Near to Mars.\n\nAt the expiration of about thirty-five days we had drawn so near to Mars\nthat with our telescopes, which, though small, were of immense power,\nwe could discern upon its surface features and details which no one had\nbeen able to glimpse from the earth.\n\nAs the surface of this world, that we were approaching as a tiger hunter\ndraws near the jungle, gradually unfolded itself to our inspection,\nthere was hardly one of us willing to devote to sleep or idleness the\nprescribed eight hours that had been fixed as the time during which each\nmember of the expedition must remain in the darkened chamber. We were\ntoo eager to watch for every new revelation upon Mars.\n\nBut something was in store that we had not expected. We were to meet\nthe Martians before arriving at the world they dwelt in.\n\nAmong the stars which shone in that quarter of the heavens where Mars\nappeared as the master orb, there was one, lying directly in our path,\nwhich, to our astonishment, as we continued on, altered from the aspect\nof a star, underwent a gradual magnification, and soon presented itself\nin the form of a little planet.\n\n\nThe Asteroid.\n\n\"It is an asteroid,\" said somebody.\n\n\"Yes, evidently; but how does it come inside the orbit of Mars?\"\n\n\"Oh, there are several asteroids,\" said one of the astronomers, \"which\ntravel inside the orbit of Mars, along a part of their course, and,\nfor aught we can tell, there may be many which have not yet been caught\nsight of from the earth, that are nearer to the sun than Mars is.\"\n\n\"This must be one of them.\"\n\n\"Manifestly so.\"\n\nAs we drew nearer the mysterious little planet revealed itself to us as\na perfectly formed globe not more than five miles in diameter.\n\n\"What is that upon it?\" asked Lord Kelvin, squinting intently at the\nlittle world through his glass. \"As I live, it moves.\"\n\n\nA Martian Appears!\n\nThe First Glimpse of the Horrible Inhabitants of the Red Planet.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" exclaimed several others, \"there are inhabitants upon it,\nbut what giants!\"\n\n\"What monsters!\"\n\n\"Don't you see?\" exclaimed an excited savant. \"They are the Martians!\"\n\nThe startling truth burst upon the minds of all. Here upon this little\nplanetoid were several of the gigantic inhabitants of the world that we\nwere going to attack. There was more than one man in the flagship who\nrecognized them well, and who shuddered at the recognition, instinctively\nrecalling the recent terrible experience of the earth.\n\nWas this an outpost of the warlike Mars?\n\nAround these monstrous enemies we saw several of their engines of\nwar. Some of these appeared to have been wrecked, but at least one,\nas far as we could see, was still in a proper condition for use.\n\nHow had these creatures got there?\n\n\"Why, that is easy enough to account for,\" I said, as a sudden\nrecollection flashed into my mind. \"Don't you remember the report of\nthe astronomers more than six months ago, at the end of the conference\nin Washington, that something would seem to indicate the departure of a\nnew expedition from Mars had been noticed by them? We have heard nothing\nof that expedition since. We know that it did not reach the earth. It\nmust have fallen foul of this asteroid, run upon this rock in the ocean\nof space and been wrecked here.\"\n\n\"We've got 'em, then,\" shouted our electric steersman, who had been\na workman in Mr. Edison's laboratory and had unlimited confidence in\nhis chief.\n\n\nPreparing to Land.\n\nThe electrical ships were immediately instructed by signal to slow down,\nan operation that was easily affected through the electrical repulsion\nof the asteroid.\n\nThe nearer we got the more terrifying was the appearance of the gigantic\ncreatures who were riding upon the little world before us like castaway\nsailors upon a block of ice. Like men, and yet not like men, combining\nthe human and the beast in their appearance, it required a steady nerve\nto look at them. If we had not known their malignity and their power to\nwork evil, it would have been different, but in our eyes their moral\ncharacter shone through their physical aspect and thus rendered them\nmore terrible than they would otherwise have been.\n\n\nThe Martians Recognize Us.\n\nWhen we first saw them their appearance was most forlorn, and their\nattitudes indicated only despair and desperation, but as they caught sight\nof us their malign power of intellect instantly penetrated the mystery,\nand they recognized us for what we were.\n\nTheir despair immediately gave place to reawakened malevolence. On the\ninstant they were astir, with such heart-chilling movements as those\nthat characterize a venomous serpent preparing to strike.\n\nNot imagining that they would be in a position to make serious resistance,\nwe had been somewhat incautious in approaching.\n\n\nThe Awful Heat Ray.\n\nSuddenly there was a quicker movement than usual among the Martians,\na swift adjustment of that one of their engines of war which, as already\nnoticed, seemed to be practically uninjured, and then there darted from it\nand alighted upon one of the foremost ships a dazzling lightning stroke\na mile in length, at whose touch the metallic sides of the car curled\nand withered and, licked for a moment by what seemed lambent flames,\ncollapsed into a mere cinder.\n\n\nAnother Ship Destroyed.\n\nThe Death-Dealing Martians Strike a Fearful Blow at the Earth's\nWarriors.\n\nFor an instant not a word was spoken, so sudden and unexpected was\nthe blow.\n\nWe knew that every soul in the stricken car had perished.\n\n\"Back! Back!\" was the signal instantaneously flashed from the flagship,\nand reversing their polarities the members of the squadron sprang\naway from the little planet as rapidly as the electrical impulse could\ndrive them.\n\nBut before we were out of reach a second flaming tongue of death shot\nfrom the fearful engine, and another of our ships, with all its crew,\nwas destroyed.\n\n\nA Discouraging Beginning.\n\nIt was an inauspicious beginning for us. Two of our electrical ships,\nwith their entire crews, had been wiped out of existence, and this\nappalling blow had been dealt by a few stranded and disabled enemies\nfloating on an asteroid.\n\nWhat hope would there be for us when we came to encounter the millions\nof Mars itself on their own ground and prepared for war?\n\nHowever, it would not do to despond. We had been incautious, and we\nshould take good care not to commit the same fault again.\n\n\nVengeance the First Thing!\n\nThe first thing to do was to avenge the death of our comrades. The\nquestion whether we were able to meet these Martians and overcome them\nmight as well be settled right here and now. They had proved what they\ncould do, even when disabled and at a disadvantage. Now it was our turn.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII.\n\n\nThe squadron had been rapidly withdrawn to a very considerable distance\nfrom the asteroid. The range of the mysterious artillery employed by\nthe Martians was unknown to us. We did not even know the limit of the\neffective range of our own disintegrators. If it should prove that the\nMartians were able to deal their strokes at a distance greater than any\nwe could reach, then they would of course have an insuperable advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, if it should turn out that our range was greater\nthan theirs, the advantage would be on our side. Or--which was perhaps\nmost probable--there might be practically no difference in the effective\nrange of the engines.\n\nAnyhow, we were going to find out how the case stood, and that without\ndelay.\n\n\nReady with the Disintegrator.\n\nEverything being in readiness, the disintegrators all in working order,\nand the men who were able to handle them, most of whom were experienced\nmarksmen, chosen from among the officers of the regular army of the\nUnited States, and accustomed to the straight shooting and the sure hits\nof the West, standing at their posts, the squadron again advanced.\n\nIn order to distract the attention of the Martians, the electrical ships\nhad been distributed over a wide space. Some dropped straight down toward\nthe asteroid; others approached it by flank attack, from this side and\nthat. The flagship moved straight in toward the point where the first\ndisaster occurred. Its intrepid commander felt that his post should be\nthat of the greatest danger, and where the severest blows would be given\nand received.\n\n\nA Strategic Advance.\n\nThe approach of the ships was made with great caution. Watching\nthe Martians with our telescopes we could clearly see that they were\ndisconcerted by the scattered order of our attack. Even if all of their\nengines of war had been in proper condition for use it would have been\nimpossible for them to meet the simultaneous assault of so many enemies\ndropping down upon them from the sky.\n\nBut they were made of fighting metal, as we knew from old experience. It\nwas no question of surrender. They did not know how to surrender, and we\ndid not know how to demand a surrender. Besides, the destruction of the\ntwo electrical ships with the forty men, many of whom bore names widely\nknown upon the earth, had excited a kind of fury among the members of\nthe squadron which called for vengeance.\n\n\nAnother Attack.\n\nSuddenly a repetition of the quick movement by the Martians, which had\nbeen the forerunner of the former coup, was observed; again a blinding\nflash burst from their war engine and instantaneously a shiver ran through\nthe frame of the flagship; the air within quivered with strange pulsations\nand seemed suddenly to have assumed the temperature of a blast furnace.\n\nWe all gasped for breath. Our throats and lungs seemed scorched in the\nact of breathing. Some fell unconscious upon the floor. The marksmen,\ncarrying the disintegrators ready for use, staggered, and one of them\ndropped his instrument.\n\nBut we had not been destroyed like our comrades before us. In a moment the\nwave of heat passed; those who had fallen recovered from their momentary\nstupor and staggered to their feet.\n\nThe electrical steersman stood hesitating at his post.\n\n\"Move on,\" said Mr. Edison sternly, his features set with determination\nand his eyes afire. \"We are still beyond their effective range. Let us\nget closer in order to make sure work when we strike.\"\n\nThe ship moved on. One could hear the heartbeats of its inmates. The\nother members of the squadron, thinking for the moment that disaster\nhad overtaken the flagship, had paused and seemed to be meditating flight.\n\n\"Signal them to move on,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\n\nThe Battle Commences.\n\nThe signal was given, and the circle of electrical ships closed in upon\nthe asteroid.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Edison had been donning his air-tight suit. Before\nwe could clearly comprehend his intention he had passed through the\ndouble-trapped door which gave access to the exterior of the car without\npermitting the loss of air, and was standing upon what served as the\ndeck of the ship.\n\nIn his hand he carried a disintegrator. With a quick motion he sighted it.\n\nAs quickly as possible I sprang to his side. I was just in time to note\nthe familiar blue gleam about the instrument, which indicated that its\nterrific energies were at work. The whirring sound was absent, because\nhere, in open space, where there was no atmosphere, there could be\nno sound.\n\n\nThe Disintegrator's Power.\n\nMy eyes were fixed upon the Martians' engine, which had just dealt us a\nstaggering, but not fatal, blow, and particularly I noticed a polished\nknob projecting from it, which seemed to have been the focus from which\nits destructive bolt emanated.\n\nA moment later the knob disappeared. The irresistible vibrations\ndarted from the electrical disintegrator and had fallen upon it and\ninstantaneously shattered it into atoms.\n\n\"That fixes them,\" said Mr. Edison, turning to me with a smile.\n\nAnd indeed it did fix them. We had most effectually spiked their gun. It\nwould deal no more death blows.\n\nThe doings of the flagship had been closely watched throughout the\nsquadron. The effect of its blow had been evident to all, and a moment\nlater we saw, on some of the nearer ships, men dressed in their air suits,\nappearing upon the deck, swinging their arms and sending forth noiseless\ncheers into empty space.\n\n\nA Telling Stroke.\n\nThe stroke that we had dealt was taken by several of the electrical\nships as a signal for a common assault, and we saw two of the Martians\nfall beside the ruin of their engine, their heads having been blown from\ntheir bodies.\n\n\"Signal them to stop firing,\" commanded Mr. Edison. \"We have got them\ndown, and we are not going to murder them without necessity.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"I want to capture some of them alive.\"\n\nThe signal was given as he had ordered. The flagship then alone dropped\nslowly toward the place on the asteroid where the prostrate Martians were.\n\n\nA Terrible Scene.\n\nAs we got near them a terrible scene unfolded itself to our eyes. There\nhad evidently been not more than half a dozen of the monsters in the\nbeginning. Two of these were stretched headless upon the ground. Three\nothers had suffered horrible injuries where the invisible vibratory\nbeams from the disintegrators had grazed them, and they could not long\nsurvive. One only remained apparently uninjured.\n\n\nThe Gigantic Martian.\n\nIt is impossible for me to describe the appearance of this creature\nin terms that would be readily understood. Was he like a man? Yes and\nno. He possessed many human characteristics, but they were exaggerated and\nmonstrous in scale and in detail. His head was of enormous size, and his\nhuge projecting eyes gleamed with a strange fire of intelligence. His face\nwas like a caricature, but not one to make the beholder laugh. Drawing\nhimself up, he towered to a height of at least fifteen feet.\n\nBut let the reader not suppose from this inadequate description that the\nMartians stirred in the beholder precisely the sensation that would be\ncaused by the sight of a gorilla, or other repulsive inhabitant of one\nof our terrestrial jungles, suddenly confronting him in its native wilds.\n\nWith all his horrible characteristics, and all his suggestions of beast\nand monster, nevertheless the Martian produced the impression of being\na person and not a mere animal.\n\n\nHis Frightened Aspect.\n\nI have already referred to the enormous size of his head, and to the\nfact that his countenance bore considerable resemblance to that of a\nman. There was something in this face that sent a shiver through the\nsoul of the beholder. One could feel in looking upon it that here was\nintellect, intelligence developed to the highest degree, but in the\ndirection of evil instead of good.\n\nThe sensations of one who had stood face to face with Satan, when he\nwas driven from the battlements of heaven by the swords of his fellow\narchangels, and had beheld him transformed from Lucifer, the Son of the\nMorning, into the Prince of Night and Hell, might not have been unlike\nthose which we now experienced as we gazed upon this dreadful personage,\nwho seemed to combine the intellectual powers of a man, raised to their\nhighest pitch, with some of the physical features of a beast, and all\nthe moral depravity of a fiend.\n\n\nThe Martian's Rage.\n\nThe appearance of the Martian was indeed so threatening and repellent\nthat we paused at the height of fifty feet above the ground, hesitating\nto approach nearer. A grin of rage and hate overspread his face. If he\nhad been a man I should say he shook his fist at us. What he did was\nto express in even more telling pantomime his hatred and defiance, and\nhis determination to grind us to shreds if he could once get us within\nhis clutches.\n\nMr. Edison and I still stood upon the deck of the ship, where several\nothers had gathered around us. The atmosphere of the little asteroid\nwas so rare that it practically amounted to nothing, and we could not\npossibly have survived if we had not continued to wear our air-tight\nsuits. How the Martians contrived to live here was a mystery to us. It\nwas another of their secrets which we were yet to learn.\n\nMr. Edison retained his disintegrator in his hand.\n\n\"Kill him,\" said someone. \"He is too horrible to live.\"\n\n\"If we do not kill him we shall never be able to land upon the asteroid,\"\nsaid another.\n\n\nShall We Kill Him?\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison, \"I shall not kill him. We have got another use\nfor him. Tom,\" he continued, turning to one of his assistants, whom he\nhad brought from his laboratory, \"bring me the anaesthetizer.\"\n\nThis was something entirely new to nearly all the members of the\nexpedition. Mr. Edison, however, had confided to me before we left\nthe earth the fact that he had invented a little instrument by means of\nwhich a bubble, strongly charged with a powerful anaesthetic agent, could\nbe driven to a considerable distance into the face of an enemy, where,\nexploding without other damage, it would instantly put him to sleep.\n\nWhen Tom had placed the instrument in his hands Mr. Edison ordered the\nelectrical ship to forge slightly ahead and drop a little lower toward\nthe Martian, who, with watchful eyes and threatening gestures, noted\nour approach in the attitude of a wild beast on the spring. Suddenly\nMr. Edison discharged from the instrument in his hand a little gaseous\nglobe, which glittered like a ball of tangled rainbows in the sunshine,\nand darted with astonishing velocity straight into the upturned face of\nthe Martian. It burst as it touched and the monster fell back senseless\nupon the ground.\n\n\nOne of the Bellicose Martians Falls Into the Hands of the\nWorldians.\n\n\"You have killed him!\" exclaimed all.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison, \"he is not dead, only asleep. Now we shall drop\ndown and bind him tight before he can awake.\"\n\nWhen we came to bind our prisoner with strong ropes we were more than\never impressed with his gigantic stature and strength. Evidently in single\ncombat with equal weapons he would have been a match for twenty of us.\n\nAll that I had read of giants had failed to produce upon my mind the\nimpression of enormous size and tremendous physical energy which the\nsleeping body of this immense Martian produced. He had fallen on his\nback, and was in a most profound slumber. All his features were relaxed,\nand yet even in that condition there was a devilishness about him that\nmade the beholders instinctively shudder.\n\n\nThe Unconscious Martian.\n\nSo powerful was the effect of the anaesthetic which Mr. Edison had\ndischarged into his face that he remained perfectly unconscious while\nwe turned him half over in order the more securely to bind his muscular\nlimbs.\n\nIn the meantime the other electrical ships approached, and several of\nthem made a landing upon the asteroid. Everybody was eager to see this\nwonderful little world, which, as I have already remarked, was only five\nmiles in diameter.\n\n\nExploring the Planet.\n\nSeveral of us from the flagship started out hastily to explore the\nminiature planet. And now our attention was recalled to an intensely\ninteresting phenomenon which had engaged our thoughts not only when we\nwere upon the moon, but during our flight through space. This was the\nalmost entire absence of weight.\n\nOn the moon, where the force of gravitation is one-sixth as great as upon\nthe earth, we had found ourselves astonishingly light. Five-sixths of our\nown weight, and of the weight of the air-tight suits in which we were\nincased, had magically dropped from us. It was therefore comparatively\neasy for us, encumbered as we were, to make our way about on the moon.\n\nBut when we were far from both the earth and the moon, the loss of\nweight was more astonishing still--not astonishing because we had not\nknown that it would be so, but nevertheless a surprising phenomenon in\ncontrast with our lifelong experience on the earth.\n\n\nMen Without Weight.\n\nIn open space we were practically without weight. Only the mass of\nthe electrical car in which we were enclosed attracted us, and inside\nthat we could place ourselves in any position without falling. We could\nfloat in the air. There were no up and no down, no top and no bottom for\nus. Stepping outside the car, it would have been easy for us to spring\naway from it and leave it forever.\n\nOne of the most startling experiences that I have ever had was one\nday when we were navigating space about half way between the earth\nand Mars. I had stepped outside the car with Lord Kelvin, both of us,\nof course, wearing our air-tight suits. We were perfectly well aware\nwhat would be the consequence of detaching ourselves from the car as\nwe moved along. We should still retain the forward motion of the car,\nand of course accompany it in its flight. There would be no falling one\nway or the other. The car would have a tendency to draw us back again by\nits attraction, but this tendency would be very slight, and practically\ninappreciable at a distance.\n\n\nStepping Into Space.\n\n\"I am going to step off,\" I suddenly said to Lord Kelvin. \"Of course\nI shall keep right along with the car, and step aboard again when I\nam ready.\"\n\n\"Quite right on general principles, young man,\" replied the great savant,\n\"but beware in what manner you step off. Remember, if you give your body\nan impulse sufficient to carry it away from the car to any considerable\ndistance, you will be unable to get back again, unless we can catch you\nwith a boathook or a fishline. Out there in empty space you will have\nnothing to kick against, and you will be unable to propel yourself in\nthe direction of the car, and its attraction is so feeble that we should\nprobably arrive at Mars before it had drawn you back again.\"\n\nAll this was, of course, perfectly self-evident, yet I believe that\nbut for the warning word of Lord Kelvin, I should have been rash enough\nto step out into empty space with sufficient force to have separated\nmyself hopelessly from the electrical ship.\n\n\nA Reckless Experiment.\n\nAs it was, I took good care to retain a hold upon a projecting portion\nof the car. Occasionally cautiously releasing my grip, I experienced for\na few minutes the delicious, indescribable pleasure of being a little\nplanet swinging through space, with nothing to hold me up and nothing\nto interfere with my motion.\n\nMr. Edison, happening to come upon the deck of the ship at this time,\nand seeing what we were about, at once said:\n\n\"I must provide against this danger. If I do not, there is a chance that\nwe shall arrive at Mars with the ships half empty and the crews floating\nhelplessly around us.\"\n\n\nEdison Always Prepared.\n\nMr. Edison's way of guarding against the danger was by contriving a\nlittle apparatus, modeled after that which was the governing force of the\nelectrical ships themselves, and which, being enclosed in the air-tight\nsuits, enabled their wearers to manipulate the electrical charge upon\nthem in such a way that they could make excursions from the cars into open\nspace like steam launches from a ship, going and returning at their will.\n\nThese little machines being rapidly manufactured, for Mr. Edison had a\nminiature laboratory aboard, were distributed about the squadron, and\nhenceforth we had the pleasure of paying and receiving visits among the\nvarious members of the fleet.\n\nBut to return from this digression to our experience of the asteroid. The\nlatter being a body of some mass was, of course, able to impart to us\na measurable degree of weight. Being five miles in diameter, on the\nassumption that its mean density was the same as that of the earth,\nthe weight of bodies on its surface should have borne the same ratio to\ntheir weight upon the earth that the radius of the asteroid bore to the\nradius of the earth; in other words, as 1 to 1,600.\n\nHaving made this mental calculation, I knew that my weight, being 150\npounds on the earth, should on this asteroid be an ounce and a half.\n\nCurious to see whether fact would bear out theory, I had myself weighed\nwith a spring balance. Mr. Edison, Lord Kelvin and the other distinguished\nscientists stood by watching the operation with great interest.\n\nTo our complete surprise, my weight, instead of coming out an ounce and\na half, as it should have done, on the supposition that the mean density\nof the asteroid resembled that of the earth--a very liberal supposition\non the side of the asteroid, by the way--actually came out five ounces\nand a quarter!\n\n\"What in the world makes me so heavy?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, what an elephant you have become,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\nLord Kelvin screwed his eyeglass in his eye, and carefully inspected\nthe balance.\n\n\nWeight, Five and a Quarter Ounces.\n\n\"It's quite right,\" he said. \"You do indeed weigh five ounces and a\nquarter. Too much; altogether too much,\" he added. \"You shouldn't do it,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the fault is in the asteroid,\" suggested Professor Sylvanus\nP. Thompson.\n\n\"Quite so,\" exclaimed Lord Kelvin, a look of sudden comprehension\noverspreading his features. \"No doubt it is the internal constitution\nof the asteroid which is the cause of the anomaly. We must look into\nthat. Let me see? This gentleman's weight is three and one-half times\nas great as it ought to be. What element is there whose density exceeds\nthe mean density of the earth in about that proportion?\"\n\n\"Gold,\" exclaimed one of the party.\n\n\nThe Golden Asteroid!\n\nFor a moment we were startled beyond expression. The truth had flashed\nupon us.\n\nThis must be a golden planet--this little asteroid. If it were not\ncomposed internally of gold it could never have made me weigh three\ntimes more than I ought to weigh.\n\n\"But where is the gold?\" cried one.\n\n\"Covered up, of course,\" said Lord Kelvin. \"Buried in star dust. This\nasteroid could not have continued to travel for millions of years through\nregions of space strewn with meteoric particles without becoming covered\nwith the inevitable dust and grime of such a journey. We must dig down,\nand then doubtless we shall find the metal.\"\n\nThis hint was instantly acted upon. Something that would serve for a\nspade was seized by one of the men, and in a few minutes a hole had been\ndug in the comparatively light soil of the asteroid.\n\n\nThe Precious Metal Discovered.\n\nI shall never forget the sight, nor the exclamations of wonder that\nbroke forth from all of us standing around, when the yellow gleam of the\nprecious metal appeared under the \"star dust.\" Collected in huge masses\nit reflected the light of the sun from its hiding place.\n\nEvidently the planet was not a solid ball of gold, formed like a bullet\nrun in a mould, but was composed of nuggets of various sizes, which\nhad come together here under the influence of their mutual gravitation,\nand formed a little metallic planet.\n\nJudging by the test of weight which we had already tried, and which had\nled to the discovery of the gold, the composition of the asteroid must\nbe the same to its very centre.\n\n\nAn Incredible Phenomenon.\n\nIn an assemblage of famous scientific men such as this the discovery of\ncourse immediately led to questions as to the origin of this incredible\nphenomenon.\n\nHow did these masses of gold come together? How did it chance that,\nwith the exception of the thin crust of the asteroid, nearly all its\nsubstance was composed of the precious metal?\n\nOne asserted that it was quite impossible that there should be so much\ngold at so great a distance from the sun.\n\n\"It is the general law,\" he said, \"that the planets increase in density\ntoward the sun. There is every reason to think that the inner planets\npossess the greater amount of dense elements, while the outer ones are\ncomparatively light.\"\n\n\nWhence Came the Treasure?\n\nBut another referred to the old theory that there was once in this\npart of the solar system a planet which had been burst in pieces by\nsome mysterious explosion, the fragments forming what we know as\nthe asteroids. In his opinion, this planet might have contained a\nlarge quantity of gold, and in the course of ages the gold, having,\nin consequence of its superior atomic weight, not being so widely\nscattered by the explosion as some of the other elements of the planet,\nhad collected itself together in this body.\n\nBut I observed that Lord Kelvin and the other more distinguished men\nof science said nothing during this discussion. The truly learned man\nis the truly wise man. They were not going to set up theories without\nsufficient facts to sustain them. The one fact that the gold was here\nwas all they had at present. Until they could learn more they were not\nprepared to theorize as to how the gold got there.\n\nAnd in truth, it must be confessed, the greater number of us really\ncared less for the explanation of the wonderful fact than we did for\nthe fact itself.\n\nGold is a thing which may make its appearance anywhere and at any time\nwithout offering any excuses or explanations.\n\n\nVisions of Mighty Fortunes.\n\n\"Phew! Won't we be rich?\" exclaimed a voice.\n\n\"How are we going to dig it and get it back to earth?\" asked another.\n\n\"Carry it in your pockets,\" said one.\n\n\"No need of staking claims here,\" remarked another. \"There is enough\nfor everybody.\"\n\nMr. Edison suddenly turned the current of talk.\n\n\"What do you suppose those Martians were doing here?\"\n\n\"Why, they were wrecked here.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Mr. Edison. \"According to your own showing they\ncould not have been wrecked here. This planet hasn't gravitation enough\nto wreck them by a fall, and besides I have been looking at their machines\nand I know there has been a fight.\"\n\n\"A fight?\" exclaimed several, pricking up their ears.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Edison; \"those machines bear the marks of the lightning of\nthe Martians. They have been disabled, but they are made of some metal or\nsome alloy of metals unknown to me, and consequently they have withstood\nthe destructive force applied to them, as our electric ships were unable\nto withstand it. It is perfectly plain to me that they have been disabled\nin a battle. The Martians must have been fighting among themselves.\"\n\n\nA Martian Civil War!\n\n\"About the gold!\" exclaimed one.\n\n\"Of course. What else was there to fight about?\"\n\nAt this instant one of our men came running from a considerable distance,\nwaving his arms excitedly, but unable to give voice to his story, in the\ninappreciable atmosphere of the asteroid, until he had come up and made\ntelephonic connection with us.\n\n\"There is a lot of dead Martians over there,\" he said. \"They've been\ncleaning one another out.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Mr. Edison. \"I knew it when I saw the condition of\nthose machines.\"\n\n\"Then this is not a wrecked expedition, directed against the earth?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"This must be the great gold mine of Mars,\" said the president of\nan Australian mining company, opening both his eyes and his mouth as\nhe spoke.\n\n\"Yes, evidently that's it. Here's where they come to get their wealth.\"\n\n\"And this,\" I said, \"must be their harvest time. You notice that this\nasteroid, being several million miles nearer to the sun than Mars is,\nmust have an appreciably shorter period of revolution. When it is in\nconjunction with Mars, or nearly so, as it is at present, the distance\nbetween the two is not very great, whereas when it is in the opposite\npart of its orbit they are separated by an enormous gap of space and\nthe sun is between them.\"\n\n\"Manifestly in the latter case it would be perilous if not entirely\nimpossible for the Martians to visit the golden asteroid, but when it\nis near Mars, as it is at present, and as it must be periodically for\nseveral years at a time, then is their opportunity.\"\n\n\"With their projectile cars sent forth with the aid of the mysterious\nexplosives which they possess, it is easy for them under such\ncircumstances, to make visits to the asteroid.\"\n\n\"Having obtained all the gold they need, or all that they can carry,\na comparatively slight impulse given to their car, the direction of\nwhich is carefully calculated, will carry them back again to Mars.\"\n\n\"If that's so,\" exclaimed a voice, \"we had better look out for\nourselves! We have got into a very hornet's nest! If this is the place\nwhere the Martians come to dig gold, and if this is the height of\ntheir season, as you say, they are not likely to leave us here long\nundisturbed.\"\n\n\"These fellows must have been pirates that they had the fight with,\"\nsaid another.\n\n\"But what's become of the regulars, then?\"\n\n\"Gone back to Mars for help, probably, and they'll be here again pretty\nquick, I am afraid!\"\n\nConsiderable alarm was caused by this view of the case, and orders were\nsent to several of the electrical ships to cruise out to a safe distance\nin the direction of Mars and keep a sharp outlook for the approach\nof enemies.\n\n\nDiscovery That the Asteroid is a Solid Mass of Gold.\n\nMeanwhile our prisoner awoke. He turned his eyes upon those standing\nabout him, without any appearance of fear, but rather with a look of\ncontempt, like that which Gulliver must have felt for the Lilliputians\nwho had bound him under similar circumstances.\n\nThere were both hatred and defiance in his glance. He attempted to free\nhimself, and the ropes strained with the tremendous pressure that he\nput upon them, but he could not break loose.\n\n\nThe Martian Safely Bound.\n\nSatisfied that the Martian was safely bound, we left him where he\nlay, and, while awaiting news from the ships which had been sent to\nreconnoitre, continued the exploration of the little planet.\n\nAt a point nearly opposite to that where we had landed we came upon\nthe mine which the Martians had been working. They had removed the thin\ncoating of soil, laying bare the rich stores of gold beneath, and large\nquantities of the latter had been removed. Some of it was so solidly\npacked that the strokes of the instruments by means of which they had\ndetached it were visible like the streaks left by a knife cutting cheese.\n\n\nReason for Astonishment.\n\nThe more we saw of this golden planet the greater became our\nastonishment. What the Martians had removed was a mere nothing in\ncomparison with the entire bulk of the asteroid. Had the celestial mine\nbeen easier to reach, perhaps they would have removed more, or, possibly,\ntheir political economists perfectly understood the necessity of properly\ncontrolling the amount of precious metal in circulation. Very likely,\nwe thought, the mining operations were under government control in Mars\nand it might be that the majority of the people there knew nothing of\nthis store of wealth floating in the firmament. That would account for\nthe battle with the supposed pirates, who, no doubt, had organized a\nsecret expedition to the asteroid and been caught red-handed at the mine.\n\n\nRicher Than the Klondike.\n\nThere were many detached masses of gold scattered about, and some of the\nmen, on picking them up, exclaimed with astonishment at their lack of\nweight, forgetting for the moment that the same law which caused their\nown bodies to weigh so little must necessarily affect everything else\nin like degree.\n\nA mass of gold that on the earth no man would have been able to lift\ncould here be tossed about like a hollow rubber ball.\n\nWhile we were examining the mine, one of the men left to guard the\nMartian came running to inform us that the latter evidently wished to\nmake some communication. Mr. Edison and others hurried to the side of the\nprisoner. He still lay on his back, from which position he was not able\nto move, notwithstanding all his efforts. But by the motion of his eyes,\naided by a pantomime with his fingers, he made us understand that there\nwas something in a metallic box fastened at his side which he wished\nto reach.\n\n\nThe Martian's Treasure Box.\n\nWith some difficulty we succeeded in opening the box and in it there\nappeared a number of bright red pellets, as large as an ordinary egg.\n\nWhen the Martian saw these in our hands he gave us to understand by\nthe motion of his lips that he wished to swallow one of them. A pellet\nwas accordingly placed in his mouth, and he instantly and with great\neagerness swallowed it.\n\n\nThe Mysterious Pellets.\n\nWhile trying to communicate his wishes to us, the prisoner had seemed\nto be in no little distress. He exhibited spasmodic movements which\nled some of the bystanders to think that he was on the point of dying,\nbut within a few seconds after he had swallowed the pellet he appeared\nto be completely restored. All evidences of distress vanished, and a\nlook of content came over his ugly face.\n\n\"It must be a powerful medicine,\" said one of the bystanders. \"I wonder\nwhat it is.\"\n\n\"I will explain to you my notion,\" said Professor Moissan, the great\nFrench chemist. \"I think it was a pill of the air, which he has taken.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\nArtificial Atmosphere.\n\n\"My meaning is,\" said Professor Moissan, \"that the Martian must have, for\nthat he may live, the nitrogen and the oxygen. These can he not obtain\nhere, where there is not the atmosphere. Therefore must he get them in\nsome other manner. This has he managed to do by combining in these pills\nthe oxygen and the nitrogen in the proportions which make atmospheric\nair. Doubtless upon Mars there are the very great chemists. They have\ndiscovered how this may be done. When the Martian has swallowed his\nlittle pill, the oxygen and the nitrogen are rendered to his blood as\nif he had breathed them, and so he can live with that air which has been\ndistributed to him with the aid of his stomach in the place of his lungs.\"\n\nIf Monsieur Moissan's explanation was not correct, at any rate it\nseemed the only one that would fit the facts before us. Certainly the\nMartian could not breathe where there was practically no air, yet just\nas certainly after he had swallowed his pill he seemed as comfortable\nas any of us.\n\n\nSignals from a Ship.\n\nSuddenly, while we were gathered around the prisoner, and interested\nin this fresh evidence of the wonderful ingenuity of the Martians, and\nof their control over the processes of nature, one of the electrical\nships that had been sent off in the direction of Mars was seen rapidly\nreturning and displaying signals.\n\n\nThe Martians Are Coming.\n\nIt reported that the Martians were coming!\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII.\n\n\nThe alarm was spread instantly among those upon the planet and through\nthe remainder of the fleet.\n\nOne of the men from the returning electrical ship dropped down upon the\nasteroid and gave a more detailed account of what they had seen.\n\nHis ship had been the one which had gone to the greatest distance in the\ndirection of Mars. While cruising there, with all eyes intent, they had\nsuddenly perceived a glittering object moving from the direction of the\nruddy planet, and manifestly approaching them. A little inspection with\nthe telescope had shown that it was one of the projectile cars used by\nthe Martians.\n\nOur ship had ventured so far from the asteroid that for a moment it seemed\ndoubtful whether it would be able to return in time to give warning,\nbecause the electrical influence of the asteroid was comparatively\nslight at such a distance, and, after they had reversed their polarity,\nand applied their intensifier, so as to make that influence effective,\ntheir motion was at first exceedingly slow.\n\nFortunately after a time they got under way with sufficient velocity to\nbring them back to us before the approaching Martians could overtake them.\n\nThe latter were not moving with great velocity, having evidently projected\nthemselves from Mars with only just sufficient force to throw them within\nthe feeble sphere of gravitation of the asteroid, so that they should\nvery gently land upon its surface.\n\nIndeed, looking out behind the electrical ship which had brought us the\nwarning, we immediately saw the projectile of the Martians approaching. It\nsparkled like a star in the black sky as the sunlight fell upon it.\n\n\nReady for the Enemy.\n\nThe ships of the squadron whose crews had not landed upon the planet were\nsignalled to prepare for action, while those who were upon the asteroid\nmade ready for battle there. A number of disintegrators were trained\nupon the approaching Martians, but Mr. Edison gave strict orders that\nno attempt should be made to discharge the vibratory force at random.\n\n\"They do not know that we are here,\" he said, \"and I am convinced that\nthey are unable to control their motions as we can do with our electrical\nships. They depend simply upon the force of gravitation. Having passed\nthe limit of the attraction of Mars, they have now fallen within the\nattraction of the asteroid, and they must slowly sink to its surface.\"\n\n\nThe Martians Cannot Stop.\n\n\"Having, as I am convinced, no means of producing or controlling\nelectrical attraction and repulsion, they cannot stop themselves, but must\ncome down upon the asteroid. Having got here they could never get away\nagain, except as we know the survivors got away from earth, by propelling\ntheir projectile against gravitation with the aid of an explosive.\"\n\n\"Therefore, to a certain extent they will be at our mercy. Let us allow\nthem quietly to land upon the planet, and then I think, if it becomes\nnecessary, we can master them.\"\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Edison's reassuring words and manner, the company upon\nthe asteroid experienced a dreadful suspense while the projectile which\nseemed very formidable as it drew near, sank with a slow and graceful\nmotion toward the surface of the ground. Evidently it was about to land\nvery near the spot where we stood awaiting it.\n\nIts inmates had apparently just caught sight of us. They evinced signs\nof astonishment, and seemed at a loss exactly what to do. We could see\nprojecting from the fore part of their car at least two of the polished\nknobs, whose fearful use and power we well comprehended.\n\nSeveral of our men cried out to Mr. Edison in an extremity of terror:\n\n\"Why do you not destroy them? Be quick, or we shall all perish.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Edison, \"there is no danger. You can see that they are\nnot prepared. They will not attempt to attack us until they have made\ntheir landing.\"\n\n\nThe Martians Land.\n\nAnd Mr. Edison was right. With gradually accelerated velocity, and yet\nvery, very slowly in comparison with the speed they would have exhibited\nin falling upon such a planet as the earth, the Martians and their car\ncame down to the ground.\n\nWe stood at a distance of perhaps three hundred feet from the point where\nthey touched the asteroid. Instantly a dozen of the giants sprang from\nthe car and gazed about for a moment with a look of intense surprise. At\nfirst it was doubtful whether they meant to attack us at all.\n\nWe stood on our guard, several carrying disintegrators in our hands,\nwhile a score more of these terrible engines were turned upon the Martians\nfrom the electrical ships which hovered near.\n\n\nA Speech from Their Leader.\n\nSuddenly he who seemed to be the leader of the Martians began to speak\nto them in pantomime, using his fingers after the manner in which they\nare used for conversation by deaf and dumb people.\n\nOf course, we did not know what he was saying, but his meaning became\nperfectly evident a minute later. Clearly they did not comprehend\nthe powers of the insignificant-looking strangers with whom they had\nto deal. Instead of turning their destructive engines upon us, they\nadvanced on a run, with the evident purpose of making us prisoners or\ncrushing us by main force.\n\n\nAwed by the Disintegrator.\n\nThe soft whirr of the disintegrator in the hands of Mr. Edison standing\nnear me came to my ears through the telephonic wire. He quickly swept\nthe concentrating mirror a little up and down, and instantly the foremost\nMartian vanished! Part of some metallic dress that he wore fell upon the\nground where he had stood, its vibratory rate not having been included\nin the range imparted to the disintegrator.\n\nHis followers paused for a moment, amazed, stared about as if looking for\ntheir leader, and then hurried back to their projectile and disappeared\nwithin it.\n\n\"Now we've got business on our hands,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Look out for\nyourselves.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I saw the death-dealing knob of the war engine contained\nin the car of the Martians moving around toward us. In another instant\nit would have launched its destroying bolt.\n\nBefore that could occur, however, it had been dissipated into space by\na vibratory stream from a disintegrator.\n\nBut we were not to get the victory quite so easily. There was another\nof the war engines in the car, and before we could concentrate our fire\nupon it, its awful flash shot forth, and a dozen of our comrades perished\nbefore our eyes.\n\n\"Quick! Quick!\" shouted Mr. Edison to one of his electrical experts\nstanding near. \"There is something the matter with this disintegrator,\nand I cannot make it work. Aim at the knob, and don't miss it.\"\n\n\nMartians and Terrestrians Fight a Terrible Battle.\n\nBut the aim was not well taken, and the vibratory force fell upon a\nportion of the car at a considerable distance from the knob, making a\ngreat breach, but leaving the engine uninjured.\n\nA section of the side of the car had been destroyed, and the vibratory\nenergy had spread no further. To have attempted to sweep the car from\nend to end would have been futile, because the period of action of the\ndisintegrators during each discharge did not exceed one second, and\ndistributing the energy over so great a space would have seriously\nweakened its power to shatter apart the atoms of the resisting\nsubstance. The disintegrators were like firearms, in that after each\ndischarge they must be readjusted before they could be used again.\n\n\nThe Martians Are Desperate.\n\nThrough the breach we saw the Martians inside making desperate efforts\nto train their engine upon us, for after their first disastrous stroke\nwe had rapidly shifted our position. Swiftly the polished knob, which\ngleamed like an evil eye, moved round to sweep over us. Instinctively,\nthough incautiously, we had collected in a group.\n\nA single discharge would sweep us all into eternity.\n\n\nA Ticklish Position.\n\n\"Will no one fire upon them?\" exclaimed Mr. Edison, struggling with the\ndisintegrator in his hands, which still refused to work.\n\nAt this fearful moment I glanced around upon our company, and was\nastonished at the spectacle. In the presence of the danger many of them\nhad lost all self-command. A half dozen had dropped their disintegrators\nupon the ground. Others stood as if frozen fast in their tracks. The\nexpert electrician, whose poor aim had had such disastrous results,\nheld in his hand an instrument which was in perfect condition, yet with\nmouth agape, he stood trembling like a captured bird.\n\n\nThe Electricians Lose Their Heads.\n\nIt was a disgraceful exhibition. Mr. Edison, however, had not lost\nhis head. Again and again he sighted at the dreadful knob with his\ndisintegrator, but the vibratory force refused to respond.\n\nThe means of safety were in our hands, and yet through a combination of\nill luck and paralyzing terror we seemed unable to use them.\n\nIn a second more it would be all over with us.\n\nThe suspense in reality lasted only during the twinkling of an eye,\nthough it seemed ages long.\n\nUnable to endure it, I sharply struck the shoulder of the paralyzed\nelectrician. To have attempted to seize the disintegrator from his hands\nwould have been a fatal waste of time. Luckily the blow either roused\nhim from his stupor or caused an instinctive movement of his hand that\nset the little engine in operation.\n\nI am sure he took no aim, but providentially the vibratory force fell\nupon the desired point, and the knob disappeared.\n\n\nSaved!\n\nWe were saved!\n\nInstantly half a dozen rushed toward the car of the Martians. We bitterly\nrepented their haste; they did not live to repent.\n\nUnknown to us the Martians carried hand engines, capable of launching\nbolts of death of the same character as those which emanated from the\nknobs of their larger machines. With these they fired, so to speak,\nthrough the breach in their car, and four of our men who were rushing\nupon them fell in heaps of cinders. The effect of the terrible fire\nwas like that which the most powerful strokes of lightning occasionally\nproduce on earth.\n\nThe destruction of the threatening knob had instantaneously relieved\nthe pressure upon the terror-stricken nerves of our company, and they\nhad all regained their composure and self-command. But this new and\nunexpected disaster, following so close upon the fear which had recently\noverpowered them, produced a second panic, the effect of which was not\nto stiffen them in their tracks as before, but to send them scurrying\nin every direction in search of hiding places.\n\n\nA Curious Effect.\n\nAnd now a most curious effect of the smallness of the planet we were on\nbegan to play a conspicuous part in our adventures. Standing on a globe\nonly five miles in diameter was like being on the summit of a mountain\nwhose sides sloped rapidly off in every direction, disappearing in the\nblack sky on all sides, as if it were some stupendous peak rising out\nof an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn consequence of the quick rounding off of the sides of this globe, the\nline of the horizon was close at hand, and by running a distance of less\nthan 250 yards the fugitives disappeared down the sides of the asteroid,\nand behind the horizon, even from the elevation of about fifteen feet\nfrom which the Martians were able to watch them. From our sight they\ndisappeared much sooner.\n\nThe slight attraction of the planet and their consequent almost entire\nlack of weight enabled the men to run with immense speed. The result,\nas I subsequently learned, was that after they had disappeared from our\nview they quitted the planet entirely, the force being sufficient to\npartially free them from its gravitation, so that they sailed out into\nspace, whirling helplessly end over end, until the elliptical orbits in\nwhich they travelled eventually brought them back again to the planet\non the side nearly opposite to that from which they had departed.\n\n\nHunting for the Enemy.\n\nBut several of us, with Mr. Edison, stood fast, watching\nfor an opportunity to get the Martians within range of the\ndisintegrators. Luckily we were enabled, by shifting our position a\nlittle to the left, to get out of the line of sight of our enemies\nconcealed in the car.\n\n\"If we cannot catch sight of them,\" said Mr. Edison, \"we shall have to\nriddle the car on the chance of hitting them.\"\n\n\"It will be like firing into a bush to kill a hidden bear,\" said one of\nthe party.\n\nBut help came from a quarter which was unexpected to us, although it\nshould not have been so. Several of the electric ships had been hovering\nabove us during the fight, their commanders being apparently uncertain\nhow to act--fearful, perhaps, of injuring us in the attempt to smite\nour enemy.\n\nBut now the situation apparently lightened for them. They saw that we\nwere at an immense disadvantage, and several of them immediately turned\ntheir batteries upon the car of the Martians.\n\nThey riddled it far more quickly and effectively than we could have\ndone. Every stroke of the vibratory emanation made a gap in the side\nof the car, and we could perceive from the commotion within that our\nenemies were being rapidly massacred in their fortification.\n\nSo overwhelming was the force and the advantage of the ships that in a\nlittle while it was all over. Mr. Edison signalled them to stop firing\nbecause it was plain that all resistance had ceased and probably not\none of the Martians remained alive.\n\nWe now approached the car, which had been transpierced in every direction,\nand whose remaining portions were glowing with heat in consequence of the\nspreading of the atomic vibrations. Immediately we discovered that all\nour anticipations were correct and that all of our enemies had perished.\n\nThe effect of the disintegrators upon them had been awful--too repulsive,\nindeed, to be described in detail. Some of the bodies had evidently\nentirely vanished; only certain metal articles which they had worn\nremaining, as in the case of the first Martian killed, to indicate that\nsuch beings had ever existed. The nature of the metal composing these\narticles was unknown to us. Evidently its vibratory rhythm did not\ncorrespond with any included in the ordinary range of the disintegrators.\n\n\nThe Disintegrators' Awful Effect.\n\nSome of the giants had been only partially destroyed, the vibratory\ncurrent having grazed them, in such a manner that the shattering\nundulations had not acted upon the entire body.\n\nOne thing that lends a peculiar horror to a terrestrial battlefield was\nabsent; there was no bloodshed. The vibratory energy, not only completely\ndestroyed whatever it fell upon but it seared the veins and arteries\nof the dismembered bodies so that there was no sanguinary exhibition\nconnected with its murderous work.\n\nAll this time the shackled Martian had lain on his back where we had\nleft him bound. What his feeling must have been may be imagined. At\ntimes, I caught a glimpse of his eyes, wildly rolling and exhibiting,\nwhen he saw that the victory was in our hands, the first indications of\nfear and terror shaking his soul that had yet appeared.\n\n\"That fellow is afraid at last,\" I said to Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Well, I should think he ought to be afraid,\" was the reply.\n\n\"So he ought, but if I am not mistaken this fear of his may be the\nbeginning of a new discovery for us.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Mr. Edison.\n\n\"In this way. When once he fears our power, and perceives that there\nwould be no hope of contending against us, even if he were at liberty,\nhe will respect us. This change in his mental attitude may tend to make\nhim communicative. I do not see why we should despair of learning his\nlanguage from him, and having done that, he will serve as our guide and\ninterpreter, and will be of incalculable advantage to us when we have\narrived at Mars.\"\n\n\"Capital! Capital!\" said Mr. Edison. \"We must concentrate the linguistic\ngenius of our company upon that problem at once.\"\n\n\nThe Deserter's Return.\n\nIn the meantime some of the skulkers whose flight I have referred to\nbegan to return, chapfallen, but rejoicing in the disappearance of the\ndanger. Several of them, I am ashamed to say, had been army officers. Yet\npossibly some excuse could be made for the terror by which they had\nbeen overcome. No man has a right to hold his fellow beings to account\nfor the line of conduct they may pursue under circumstances which are\nnot only entirely unexampled in their experience, but almost beyond the\npower of the imagination to picture.\n\nParalyzing terror had evidently seized them with the sudden comprehension\nof the unprecedented singularity of their situation. Millions of miles\naway from the earth, confronted on an asteroid by these diabolical\nmonsters from a maleficient planet, who were on the point of destroying\nthem with a strange torment of death--perhaps it was really more than\nhuman nature, deprived of the support of human surroundings, could have\nbeen expected to bear.\n\nThose who, as already described, had run with so great a speed that they\nwere projected, all unwilling, into space, rising in elliptical orbits\nfrom the surface of the planet, describing great curves in what might\nbe denominated its sky, and then coming back again to the little globe\non another side, were so filled with the wonders of their remarkable\nadventure that they had almost forgotten the terror which had inspired it.\n\nThere was nothing surprising in what had occurred to them the moment one\nconsidered the laws of gravitation on the asteroid, but their stories\naroused an intense interest among all who listened to them.\n\nLord Kelvin was particularly interested, and while Mr. Edison was\nhastening preparations to quit the asteroid and resume our voyage to Mars,\nLord Kelvin and a number of other scientific men instituted a series of\nremarkable experiments.\n\n\nJumping Into Empty Space.\n\nIt was one of the most laughable things imaginable to see Lord Kelvin,\ndressed in his air-tight suit, making tremendous jumps into empty\nspace. It reminded me forcibly of what Lord Kelvin, then plain William\nThompson, and Professor Blackburn had done when spending a Summer\nvacation at the seaside, while they were undergraduates of Cambridge\nUniversity. They had spent all their time, to the surprise of onlookers,\nin spinning rounded stones on the beach, their object being to obtain\na practical solution of the mathematical problem of \"precession.\"\n\nImmediately Lord Kelvin was imitated by a dozen others. With what seemed\nvery slight effort they projected themselves straight upward, rising\nto a height of four hundred feet or more, and then slowly settling back\nagain to the surface of the asteroid. The time of rise and fall combined\nwas between three and four minutes.\n\nOn this little planet the acceleration of gravity or the velocity\nacquired by a falling body in one second was only four-fifths of an\ninch. A body required an entire minute to fall a distance of only 120\nfeet. Consequently, it was more like gradually settling than falling. The\nfigures of these men of science, rising and sinking in this manner,\nappeared like so many gigantic marionettes bobbing up and down in a\npneumatic bottle.\n\n\"Let us try that,\" said Mr. Edison, very much interested in the\nexperiments.\n\n\nA Delightful Experience.\n\nBoth of us jumped together. At first, with great swiftness, but gradually\nlosing speed, we rose to an immense height straight from the ground. When\nwe had reached the utmost limit of our flight we seemed to come to rest\nfor a moment, and then began slowly, but with accelerated velocity,\nto sink back again to the planet. It was not only a peculiar but a\ndelicious sensation, and but for strict orders which were issued that\nthe electrical ships should be immediately prepared for departure, our\nentire company might have remained for an indefinite period enjoying\nthis new kind of athletic exercise in a world where gravitation had\nbecome so humble that it could be trifled with.\n\nWhile the final preparations for departure were being made, Lord\nKelvin instituted other experiments that were no less unique in their\nresults. The experience of those who had taken unpremeditated flights in\nelliptical orbits when they had run from the vicinity of the Martians\nsuggested the throwing of solid objects in various directions from the\nsurface of the planet in order to determine the distance that they would\ngo and the curves they would describe in returning.\n\n\nMars, the Death-Dealing Planet, at Length at Hand!\n\nFor these experiments there was nothing more convenient or abundant\nthan chunks of gold from the Martians' mine. These, accordingly, were\nhurled in various directions, and with every degree of velocity. A little\ncalculation had shown that an initial velocity of thirty feet per second\nimparted to one of these chunks, moving at right angles to the radius\nof the asteroid, would, if the resistance of an almost inappreciable\natmosphere were neglected, suffice to turn the piece of gold into\na little satellite that would describe an orbit around the asteroid,\nand continue to do so forever, or at least until the slight atmospheric\nresistance should eventually bring it down to the surface.\n\nBut a less velocity than thirty feet per second would cause the golden\nmissile to fly only part way around, while a greater velocity would give\nit an elliptical instead of a circular orbit, and in this ellipse it would\ncontinue to revolve around the asteroid in the character of a satellite.\n\nIf the direction of the original impulse were at more than a right angle\nto the radius of the asteroid, then the flying body would pass out to\na greater or less distance in space in an elliptical orbit, eventually\ncoming back again and falling upon the asteroid, but not at the same\nspot from which it had departed.\n\n\nInteresting Experiments.\n\nSo many took part in these singular experiments, which assumed rather\nthe appearance of outdoor sports than of scientific demonstrations, that\nin a short time we had provided the asteroid with a very large number\nof little moons, or satellites, of gold, which revolved around it in\norbits of various degrees of ellipticity, taking, on the average, about\nthree-quarters of an hour to complete a circuit. Since, on completing\na revolution, they must necessarily pass through the point from which\nthey started, they kept us constantly on the qui vive to avoid being\nknocked over by them as they swept around in their orbits.\n\nFinally the signal was given for all to embark, and with great regret\nthe savants quitted their scientific games and prepared to return to\nthe electric ships.\n\nJust on the moment of departure, the fact was announced by one, who had\nbeen making a little calculation on a bit of paper, that the velocity with\nwhich a body must be thrown in order to escape forever the attraction of\nthe asteroid, and to pass on to an infinite distance in any direction,\nwas only about forty-two feet in a second.\n\nManifestly it would be quite easy to impart such a speed as that to the\nchunks of gold that we held in our hands.\n\n\nA Message to the Earth.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" exclaimed one. \"Let's send some of this back to the earth.\"\n\n\"Where is the earth?\" asked another.\n\nBeing appealed to, several astronomers turned their eyes in the direction\nof the sun, where the black firmament was ablaze with stars, and in a\nmoment recognized the earth-star shining there, with the moon attending\nclose at hand.\n\n\"There,\" said one, \"is the earth. Can you throw straight enough to\nhit it?\"\n\n\"We'll try,\" was the reply, and immediately several threw huge golden\nnuggets in the direction of our far-away world, endeavoring to impart\nto them at least the required velocity of forty-two feet in a second,\nwhich would insure their passing beyond the attraction of the asteroid,\nand if there should be no disturbance on the way, and the aim were\naccurate, their eventual arrival upon the earth.\n\n\"Here's for you, Old Earth,\" said one of the throwers, \"good luck,\nand more gold to you!\"\n\nIf these precious missiles ever reached the earth we knew that they\nwould plunge into the atmosphere like meteors and that probably the heat\ndeveloped by their passage would melt and dissipate them in golden vapors\nbefore they could touch the ground.\n\nYet, there was a chance that some of them--if the aim were true--might\nsurvive the fiery passage through the atmosphere and fall upon the\nsurface of our planet where, perhaps, they would afterward be picked up\nby a prospector and lead him to believe that he had struck a new bonanza.\n\nBut until we returned to the earth it would be impossible for us to tell\nwhat had become of the golden gifts which we had launched into space\nfor our mother planet.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX.\n\n\nAll Aboard for Mars!\n\n\"All aboard!\" was the signal, and the squadron having assembled under\nthe lead of the flagship, we started again for Mars.\n\nThis time, as it proved, there was to be no further interruption, and\nwhen next we paused it was in the presence of the world inhabited by\nour enemies, and facing their frowning batteries.\n\n\nDifficulty in Starting.\n\nWe did not find it so easy to start from the asteroid as it had been to\nstart from the earth; that is to say, we could not so readily generate\na very high velocity.\n\nIn consequence of the comparatively small size of the asteroid, its\nelectric influence was very much less than that of the earth, and\nnotwithstanding the appliances which we possessed for intensifying the\nelectrical effect, it was not possible to produce a sufficient repulsion\nto start us off for Mars with anything like the impulse which we had\nreceived from the earth on our original departure.\n\nThe utmost velocity that we could generate did not exceed three miles\nin a second, and to get this required our utmost efforts. In fact, it\nhad not seemed possible that we should attain even so great a speed as\nthat. It was far more than we could have expected, and even Mr. Edison\nwas surprised, as well as greatly gratified, when he found that we were\nmoving with the velocity that I have named.\n\n\nMars 6,000,000 Miles Away.\n\nWe were still about 6,000,000 miles from Mars, so that, travelling three\nmiles in a second, we should require at least twenty-three days to reach\nthe immediate neighborhood of the planet.\n\nMeanwhile we had a plenty of occupation to make the time pass quickly. Our\nprisoner was transported along with us, and we now began our attempts to\nascertain what his language was, and, if possible, to master it ourselves.\n\nBefore quitting the asteroid we had found that it was necessary for\nhim to swallow one of his \"air pills,\" as Prof. Moissan called them, at\nleast three times in the course of every twenty-four hours. One of us\nsupplied him regularly and I thought that I could detect evidences of\na certain degree of gratitude in his expression. This was encouraging,\nbecause it gave additional promise of the possibility of our being able to\ncommunicate with him in some more effective way than by mere signs. But\nonce inside the car, where we had a supply of air kept at the ordinary\npressure experienced on the earth, he could breathe like the rest of us.\n\n\nLearning the Martians' Language.\n\nThe best linguists in the expedition, as Mr. Edison had suggested,\nwere now assembled in the flagship, where the prisoner was, and they\nset to work to devise some means of ascertaining the manner in which he\nwas accustomed to express his thoughts.\n\nWe had not heard him speak, because until we carried him into our car\nthere was no atmosphere capable of conveying any sounds he might attempt\nto utter.\n\nIt seemed a fair assumption that the language of the Martians would be\nscientific in its structure. We had so much evidence of the practical\nbent of their minds, and of the immense progress which they had made\nin the direction of the scientific conquest of nature, that it was not\nto be supposed their medium of communication with one another would be\nlacking in clearness, or would possess any of the puzzling and unnecessary\nambiguities that characterized the languages spoken on the earth.\n\n\"We shall not find them making he's and she's of stones, sticks and\nother inanimate objects,\" said one of the American linguists. \"They must\ncertainly have gotten rid of all that nonsense long ago.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said a French professor from the Sorbonne, one of the makers of\nthe never-to-be-finished dictionary. \"It will be like the language of\nmy country. Transparent, similar to the diamond, and sparkling as is\nthe fountain.\"\n\n\nThe Volapuk of Mars.\n\n\"I think,\" said a German enthusiast, \"that it will be a universal\nlanguage, the Volapuk of Mars, spoken by all the inhabitants of that\nplanet.\"\n\n\"But all these speculations,\" broke in Mr. Edison, \"do not help you\nmuch. Why not begin in a practical manner by finding out what the Martian\ncalls himself, for instance.\"\n\nThis seemed a good suggestion, and accordingly several of the bystanders\nbegan an expressive pantomime, intended to indicate to the giant, who was\nfollowing all their motions with his eyes, that they wished to know by\nwhat name he called himself. Pointing their fingers to their own breasts\nthey repeated, one after the other, the word \"man.\"\n\nIf our prisoner had been a stupid savage, of course any such attempt\nas this to make him understand would have been idle. But it must be\nremembered that we were dealing with a personage who had presumably\ninherited from hundreds of generations the results of a civilization,\nand an intellectual advance, measured by the constant progress of millions\nof years.\n\nAccordingly we were not very much astonished, when, after a few\nrepetitions of the experiment, the Martian--one of whose arms had been\npartially released from its bonds in order to give him a little freedom\nof motion--imitated the action of his interrogators by pressing his\nfinger over his heart.\n\n\nThe Martian Speaks.\n\nThen, opening his mouth, he gave utterance to a sound which shook the air\nof the car like the hoarse roar of a lion. He seemed himself surprised\nby the noise he made, for he had not been used to speak in so dense\nan atmosphere.\n\nOur ears were deafened and confused, and we recoiled in astonishment,\nnot to say, half in terror.\n\nWith an ugly grin distorting his face as if he enjoyed our discomfiture,\nthe Martian repeated the motion and the sound.\n\n\"R-r-r-r-r-r-h!\"\n\nIt was not articulate to our ears, and not to be represented by any\ncombination of letters.\n\n\"Faith,\" exclaimed a Dublin University professor, \"if that's what they\ncall themselves, how shall we ever translate their names when we come\nto write the history of the conquest?\"\n\n\"Whist, mon,\" replied a professor from the University of Aberdeen,\n\"let us whip the gillravaging villains first, and then we can describe\nthan by any intitulation that may suit our deesposition.\"\n\nThe beginning of our linguistic conquest was certainly not promising,\nat least if measured by our acquirement of words, but from another point\nof view it was very gratifying, inasmuch as it was plain that the Martian\nunderstood what we were trying to do, and was, for the present, at least,\ndisposed to aid us.\n\nThese efforts to learn the language of Mars were renewed and repeated\nevery few hours, all the experience, learning and genius of the squadron\nbeing concentrated upon the work, and the result was that in the course\nof a few days we had actually succeeded in learning a dozen or more\nof the Martian's words and were able to make him understand us when we\npronounced them, as well as to understand him when our ears had become\naccustomed to the growling of his voice.\n\nFinally, one day the prisoner, who seemed to be in an unusually cheerful\nframe of mind, indicated that he carried in his breast some object which\nhe wished us to see.\n\n\nThe Martian's Book.\n\nWith our assistance he pulled out a book!\n\nActually, it was a book, not very unlike the books which we have upon\nthe earth, but printed, of course, in characters that were entirely\nstrange and unknown to us. Yet these characters evidently gave expression\nto a highly intellectual language. All those who were standing by at\nthe moment uttered a shout of wonder and of delight, and the cry of\n\"A book! a book!\" ran around the circle, and the good news was even\npromptly communicated to some of the neighboring electric ships of the\nsquadron. Several other learned men were summoned in haste from them to\nexamine our new treasure.\n\nThe Martian, whose good nature had manifestly been growing day after day,\nwatched our inspection of his book with evidences of great interest, not\nunmingled with amusement. Finally he beckoned the holder of the book to\nhis side, and placing his broad finger upon one of the huge letters--if\nletters they were, for they more nearly resembled the characters employed\nby the Chinese printer--he uttered a sound which we, of course, took to\nbe a word, but which was different from any we had yet heard. Then he\npointed to one after another of us standing around.\n\n\"Ah,\" explained everybody, the truth being apparent, \"that is the word\nby which the Martians designate us. They have a name, then, for the\ninhabitants of the earth.\"\n\n\"Or, perhaps, it is rather the name for the earth itself,\" said one.\n\nBut this could not, of course, be at once determined. Anyhow, the\nword, whatever its precise meaning might be, had now been added to\nour vocabulary, although as yet our organs of speech proved unable to\nreproduce it in a recognizable form.\n\nThis promising and unexpected discovery of the Martian's book lent added\nenthusiasm to those who were engaged in the work of trying to master\nthe language of our prisoner, and the progress that they made in the\ncourse of the next few days was truly astonishing. If the prisoner had\nbeen unwilling to aid them, of course, it would have been impossible\nto proceed, but, fortunately for us, he seemed more and more to enter\ninto the spirit of the undertaking, and actually to enjoy it himself. So\nbright and quick was his understanding that he was even able to indicate\nto us methods of mastering his language that would otherwise, probably,\nnever have occurred to our minds.\n\n\nThe Prisoner Teaches.\n\nIn fact, in a very short time he had turned teacher and all these learned\nmen, pressing around him with eager attention, had become his pupils.\n\nI cannot undertake to say precisely how much of the Martian language\nhad been acquired by the chief linguists of the expedition before the\ntime when we arrived so near to Mars that it became necessary for most\nof us to abandon our studies in order to make ready for the more serious\nbusiness which now confronted us.\n\nBut, at any rate, the acquisition was so considerable as to allow of\nthe interchange of ordinary ideas with our prisoner, and there was no\nlonger any doubt that he would be able to give us much information when\nwe landed on his native planet.\n\nAt the end of twenty-three days as measured by terrestrial time, since\nour departure from the asteroid, we arrived in the sky of Mars.\n\nFor a long time the ruddy planet had been growing larger and more\nformidable, gradually turning from a huge star into a great red moon,\nand then expanding more and more until it began to shut out from sight\nthe constellations behind it. The curious markings on its surface, which\nfrom the earth can only be dimly glimpsed with a powerful telescope,\nbegan to reveal themselves clearly to our naked eyes.\n\nI have related how even before we had reached the asteroid, Mars began to\npresent a most imposing appearance as we saw it with our telescopes. Now,\nhowever, that it was close at hand, the naked eye view of the planet\nwas more wonderful than anything we had been able to see with telescopes\nwhen at a greater distance.\n\n\nMars in Sight.\n\nWe were approaching the southern hemisphere of Mars in about latitude\n45 degrees south. It was near the time of the vernal equinox in that\nhemisphere of the planet, and under the stimulating influence of the\nSpring sun, rising higher and higher every day, some such awakening of\nlife and activity upon its surface as occurs on the earth under similar\ncircumstances was evidently going on.\n\nAround the South Pole were spread immense fields of snow and ice, gleaming\nwith great brilliance. Cutting deep into the borders of these ice fields,\nwe could see broad channels of open water, indicating the rapid breaking\nof the grip of the frost.\n\nAlmost directly beneath us was a broad oval region, light red in color,\nto which terrestrial astronomers had given the name of Hellas. Toward\nthe south, between Hellas and the borders of the polar ice, was a great\nbelt of darkness that astronomers had always been inclined to regard\nas a sea. Looking toward the north, we could perceive the immense red\nexpanses of the continents of Mars, with the long curved line of the\nSyrtis Major, or \"The Hour Glass Sea,\" sweeping through the midst of\nthem toward the north until it disappeared under the horizon.\n\nCrossing and recrossing the red continents, in every direction, were\nthe canals of Schiaparelli.\n\n\nMars Reached at Last--Thrilling Adventures.\n\nPlentifully sprinkled over the surface we could see brilliant points,\nsome of dazzling brightness, outshining the daylight. There was also\nan astonishing variety in the colors of the broad expanses beneath\nus. Activity, vivacity and beauty, such as we were utterly unprepared\nto behold, expressed their presence on all sides.\n\nThe excitement on the flagship and among the other members of the squadron\nwas immense. It was certainly a thrilling scene. Here, right under our\nfeet, lay the world we had come to do battle with. Its appearances, while\nrecalling in some of their broader aspects those which it had presented\nwhen viewed from our observatories, were far more strange, complex and\nwonderful than any astronomer had ever dreamed of. Suppose all of our\nanticipations about Mars should prove to have been wrong, after all?\n\nThere could be no longer any question that it was a world which, if\nnot absolutely teeming with inhabitants, like a gigantic ant-hill, at\nany rate bore on every side the marks of their presence and of their\nincredible undertakings and achievements.\n\nHere and there clouds of smoke arose and spread slowly through the\natmosphere beneath us. Floating higher above the surface of the planet\nwere clouds of vapor, assuming the familiar forms of stratus and cumulus\nwith which we were acquainted upon the earth.\n\n\nDense Clouds Appear.\n\nThese clouds, however, seemed upon the whole to be much less dense than\nthose to which we were accustomed at home. They had, too, a peculiar\niridescent beauty as if there was something in their composition or their\ntexture which split up the chromatic elements of the sunlight and thus\nproduced internal rainbow effects that caused some of the heavier cloud\nmasses to resemble immense collections of opals, alive with the play of\never-changing colors and magically suspended above the planet.\n\nAs we continued to study the phenomena that was gradually unfolded\nbeneath us we thought that we could detect in many places evidences of\nthe existence of strong fortifications. The planet of war appeared to be\nprepared for the attacks of enemies. Since, as our own experience had\nshown, it sometimes waged war with distant planets, it was but natural\nthat it should be found prepared to resist foes who might be disposed\nto revenge themselves for injuries suffered at its hands.\n\nAs had been expected, our prisoner now proved to be of very great\nassistance to us. Apparently he took a certain pride in exhibiting to\nstrangers from a distant world the beauties and wonders of his own planet.\n\n\nThe Martian Is Understood.\n\nWe could not understand by any means all that he said, but we could\nreadily comprehend, from his gestures, and from the manner in which his\nfeatures lighted up at the recognition of familiar scenes and objects,\nwhat his sentiments in regard to them were, and, in a general way,\nwhat part they played in the life of the planet.\n\nHe confirmed our opinion that certain of the works which we saw beneath\nus were fortifications, intended for the protection of the planet against\ninvaders from outer space. A cunning and almost diabolical look came\ninto his eyes as he pointed to one of these strongholds.\n\n\nCause for Anxiety.\n\nHis confidence and his mocking looks were not reassuring to us. He\nknew what his planet was capable of, and we did not. He had seen, on\nthe asteroid, the extent of our power, and while its display served to\nintimidate him there, yet now that he and we together were facing the\nworld of his birth, his fear had evidently fallen from him, and he had\nthe manner of one who feels that the shield of an all-powerful protector\nhad been extended over him.\n\nBut it could not be long now before we should ascertain, by the\nirrevocable test of actual experience, whether the Martians possessed\nthe power to annihilate us or not.\n\nHow shall I describe our feelings as we gazed at the scene spread beneath\nus? They were not quite the same as those of the discoverer of new\nlands upon the earth. This was a whole new world that we had discovered,\nand it was filled, as we could see, with inhabitants.\n\nBut that was not all. We had not come with peaceful intentions.\n\nWe were to make war on this new world.\n\nDeducting our losses we had not more than 940 men left. With these we\nwere to undertake the conquest of a world containing we could not say\nhow many millions!\n\n\nA Hard Task Ahead.\n\nOur enemies, instead of being below us in the scale of intelligence were,\nwe had every reason to believe, greatly our superiors. They had proved\nthat they possessed a command over the powers of nature such as we, up\nto the time when Mr. Edison made his inventions, had not even dreamed\nthat it was possible for us to obtain.\n\nIt was true that at present we appeared to have the advantage, both in\nour electrical ships and in our means of offence. The disintegrator was\nat least as powerful an engine of destruction as any that the Martians\nhad yet shown that they possessed. It did not seem that in that respect\nthey could possibly excel us.\n\nDuring the brief war with the Martians upon the earth it had been\ngunpowder against a mysterious force as much stronger than gunpowder as\nthe latter was superior to the bows and arrows that preceded it.\n\nThere had been no comparison whatever between the offensive means employed\nby the two parties in the struggle on the earth.\n\nBut the genius of one man had suddenly put us on the level of our enemies\nin regard to fighting capacity.\n\nThen, too, our electrical ships were far more effective for their purpose\nthan the projectile cars used by the Martians. In fact, the principle\nupon which they were based was, at bottom, so simple that it seemed\nastonishing the Martians had not hit upon it.\n\nMr. Edison himself was never tired of saying in reference to this matter:\n\n\nThe Martians a Mystery.\n\n\"I cannot understand why the Martians did not invent these things. They\nhave given ample proof that they understand electricity better than\nwe do. Why should they have resorted to the comparatively awkward and\nbungling means of getting from one planet to another that they have\nemployed when they might have ridden through the solar system in such\nconveyances as ours with perfect ease?\"\n\n\"And besides,\" Mr. Edison would add, \"I cannot understand why they did\nnot employ the principle of harmonic vibrations in the construction of\ntheir engines of war. The lightning-like strokes that they deal from\ntheir machines are no doubt equally powerful, but I think the range of\ndestruction covered by the disintegrators is greater.\"\n\nHowever, these questions must remain open until we could effect a landing\non Mars, and learn something of the condition of things there.\n\nThe thing that gave us the most uneasiness was the fact that we did\nnot yet know what powers the Martians might have in reserve. It was but\nnatural to suppose that here, on their own ground, they would possess\nmeans of defence even more effective than the offensive engines they\nhad employed in attacking enemies so many millions of miles from home.\n\nIt was important that we should waste no time, and it was equally\nimportant that we should select the most vulnerable point for attack. It\nwas self-evident, therefore, that our first duty would be to reconnoitre\nthe surface of the planet and determine its weakest point of defence.\n\nAt first Mr. Edison contemplated sending the various ships in different\ndirections around the planet in order that the work of exploration might\nbe quickly accomplished. But upon second thought it seemed wiser to keep\nthe squadron together, thus diminishing the chance of disaster.\n\nBesides, the commander wished to see with his own eyes the exact situation\nof the various parts of the planet, where it might appear advisable for\nus to begin our assault.\n\nThus far we had remained suspended at so great a height above the planet\nthat we had hardly entered into the perceptible limits of its atmosphere\nand there was no evidence that we had been seen by the inhabitants of\nMars; but before starting on our voyage of exploration it was determined\nto drop down closer to the surface in order that we might the more\ncertainly identify the localities over which we passed.\n\nThis manoeuvre nearly got us into serious trouble.\n\n\nA Huge Airship.\n\nWhen we had arrived within a distance of three miles from the surface of\nMars we suddenly perceived approaching from the eastward a large airship\nwhich was navigating the Martian atmosphere at a height of perhaps half\na mile above the ground.\n\n\nMore Stirring Adventures of Our Warriors Against Mars.\n\nThis airship moved rapidly on to a point nearly beneath us, when it\nsuddenly paused, reversed its course, and evidently made signals, the\npurpose of which was not at first evident to us.\n\nBut in a short time their meaning became perfectly plain, when we found\nourselves surrounded by at least twenty similar aerostats approaching\nswiftly from different sides.\n\nIt was a great mystery to us where so many airships had been concealed\nprevious to their sudden appearance in answer to the signals.\n\nBut the mystery was quickly solved when we saw detaching itself from the\nsurface of the planet beneath us, where, while it remained immovable,\nits color had blended with that of the soil so as to render it invisible,\nanother of the mysterious ships.\n\nThen our startled eyes beheld on all sides these formidable-looking\nenemies rising from the ground beneath us like so many gigantic insects,\ndisturbed by a sudden alarm.\n\nIn a short time the atmosphere a mile or two below us, and to a\ndistance of perhaps twenty miles around in every direction, was alive\nwith airships of various sizes, and some of most extraordinary forms,\nexchanging signals, rushing to and fro, but all finally concentrating\nbeneath the place where our squadron was suspended.\n\nWe had poked the hornet's nest with a vengeance!\n\nAs yet there had been no sting, but we might quickly expect to feel it\nif we did not get out of range.\n\n\nEscaping Danger.\n\nQuickly instructions were flashed throughout the squadron to instantly\nreverse polarities and rise as swiftly as possible to a great height.\n\nIt was evident that this manoeuvre would save us from danger if it were\nquickly effected, because the airships of the Martians were simply\nairships and nothing more. They could only float in the atmosphere,\nand had no means of rising above it, or of navigating empty space.\n\nTo have turned our disintegrators upon them, and to have begun a battle\nthen and there, would have been folly.\n\nThey overwhelmingly outnumbered us, the majority of them were yet at a\nconsiderable distance and we could not have done battle, even with our\nentire squadron acting together, with more than one-quarter of them\nsimultaneously. In the meantime the others would have surrounded and\nmight have destroyed us. We must first get some idea of the planet's\nmeans of defence before we ventured to assail it.\n\nHaving risen rapidly to a height of twenty-five or thirty miles, so that\nwe could feel confident that our ships had vanished at least from the\nnaked eye view of our enemies beneath, a brief consultation was held.\n\nIt was determined to adhere to our original programme and to\ncircumnavigate Mars in every direction before proceeding to open the war.\n\n\nIntimidated by the Enemy.\n\nThe overwhelming forces shown by the enemy had intimidated even some of\nthe most courageous of our men, but still it was universally felt that\nit would not do to retreat without a blow struck.\n\nThe more we saw of the power of the Martians, the more we became\nconvinced that there would be no hope for the earth, if these enemies\never again effected a landing upon its surface, the more especially\nsince our squadron contained nearly all of the earth's force that would\nbe effective in such a contest.\n\nWith Mr. Edison and the other men of science away, they would not be\nable at home to construct such engines as we possessed, or to manage\nthem even if they were constructed.\n\nOur planet had staked everything on a single throw.\n\nThese considerations again steeled our hearts, and made us bear up as\nbravely as possible in the face of the terrible odds that confronted us.\n\nTurning the noses of our electrical ships toward the west, we began\nour circumnavigation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter X.\n\n\nAt first we rose to a still greater height, in order more effectually\nto escape the watchful eyes of our enemies, and then, after having\nmoved rapidly several hundred miles toward the west, we dropped down\nagain within easy eyeshot of the surface of the planet, and commenced\nour inspection.\n\nWhen we originally reached Mars, as I have related, it was at a point in\nits southern hemisphere, in latitude 45 degrees south, and longitude 75\ndegrees east, that we first closely approached its surface. Underneath\nus was the land called \"Hellas,\" and it was over this land of Hellas\nthat the Martian air fleet had suddenly made its appearance.\n\nOur westward motion, while at a great height above the planet, had\nbrought us over another oval-shaped land called \"Noachia,\" surrounded by\nthe dark ocean, the \"Mare Erytraeum.\" Now approaching nearer the surface\nour course was changed so as to carry us toward the equator of Mars.\n\nWe passed over the curious, half-drowned continent known to terrestrial\nastronomers as the Region of Deucalion, then across another sea, or gulf,\nuntil we found ourselves floating, at a height of perhaps five miles,\nabove a great continental land, at least three thousand miles broad\nfrom east to west, and which I immediately recognized as that to which\nastronomers had given the various names of \"Aeria,\" \"Edom,\" \"Arabia,\"\nand \"Eden.\"\n\nHere the spectacle became of breathless interest.\n\n\"Wonderful! Wonderful!\"\n\n\"Who could have believed it!\"\n\nSuch were the exclamations heard on all sides.\n\nWhen at first we were suspended above Hellas, looking toward the north,\nthe northeast and the northwest, we had seen at a distance some of these\ngreat red regions, and had perceived the curious network of canals by\nwhich they were intersected. But that was a far-off and imperfect view.\n\nNow, when we were near at hand and straight above one of these singular\nlands, the magnificence of the panorama surpassed belief.\n\nFrom the earth about a dozen of the principal canals crossing the\ncontinent beneath us had been perceived, but we saw hundreds, nay,\nthousands of them!\n\nIt was a double system, intended both for irrigation and for protection,\nand far more marvellous in its completeness than the boldest speculative\nminds among our astronomers had ever dared to imagine.\n\n\"Ha! that's what I always said,\" exclaimed a veteran from one of our great\nobservatories. \"Mars is red because its soil and vegetation are red.\"\n\nAnd certainly appearances indicated that he was right.\n\nThere were no green trees, and there was no green grass. Both were red,\nnot of a uniform red tint, but presenting an immense variety of shades\nwhich produced a most brilliant effect, fairly dazzling our eyes.\n\nBut what trees! And what grass! And what flowers!\n\n\nGigantic Vegetation.\n\nOur telescopes showed that even the smaller trees must be 200 or 300\nfeet in height, and there were forests of giants, whose average height\nwas evidently at least 1,000 feet.\n\n\"That's all right,\" exclaimed the enthusiast I have just quoted. \"I knew\nit would be so. The trees are big, for the same reason that the men are,\nbecause the planet is small, and they can grow big without becoming too\nheavy to stand.\"\n\nFlashing in the sun on all sides were the roofs of metallic buildings,\nwhich were evidently the only kind of edifices that Mars possessed. At\nany rate, if stone or wood were employed in their construction both were\ncompletely covered with metallic plates.\n\nThis added immensely to the warlike aspect of the planet. For warlike\nit was. Everywhere we recognized fortified stations, glittering with an\narray of the polished knobs of the lightning machines, such as we had\nseen in the land of Hellas.\n\nFrom the land of Edom, directly over the equator of the planet, we turned\nour faces westward, and, skirting the Mare Erytraeum, arrived above the\nplace where the broad canal known as the Indus empties into the sea.\n\nBefore us, and stretching away toward the northwest, now lay the continent\nof Chryse, a vast red land, oval in outline, and surrounded and crossed\nby innumerable canals. Chryse was not less than 1,600 miles across,\nand it, too, evidently swarmed with giant inhabitants.\n\nBut the shadow of night lay upon the greater portion of the land of\nChryse. In our rapid motion westward we had out-stripped the sun and\nhad now arrived at a point where day and night met upon the surface of\nthe planet beneath us.\n\nBehind all was brilliant with sunshine, but before us the face of Mars\ngradually disappeared in the deepening gloom. Through the darkness,\nfar away, we could behold magnificent beams of electric light darting\nacross the curtain of night, and evidently serving to illuminate towns\nand cities that lay beneath.\n\nWe pushed on into the night for two or three hundred miles over that part\nof the continent of Chryse whose inhabitants were doubtless enjoying\nthe deep sleep that accompanies the dark hours immediately preceding\nthe dawn. Still everywhere splendid clusters of light lay like fallen\nconstellations upon the ground, indicating the sites of great towns,\nwhich, like those of the earth, never sleep.\n\nBut this scene, although weird and beautiful, could give us little of\nthe kind of information we were in search of.\n\nAccordingly it was resolved to turn back eastward until we had arrived\nin the twilight space separating day and night, and then hover over\nthe planet at that point, allowing it to turn beneath us so that, as\nwe looked down, we should see in succession the entire circuit of the\nglobe of Mars while it rolled under our eyes.\n\nThe rotation of Mars on its axis is performed in a period very little\nlonger than that of the earth's rotation, so that the length of the day\nand night in the world of Mars is only some forty minutes longer than\ntheir length upon the earth.\n\nIn thus remaining suspended over the planet, on the line of daybreak, so\nto speak, we believed that we should be peculiarly safe from detection\nby the eyes of the inhabitants. Even astronomers are not likely to be\nwide awake just at the peep of dawn. Almost all of the inhabitants,\nwe confidently believed, would still be sound asleep upon that part of\nthe planet passing directly beneath us, and those who were awake would\nnot be likely to watch for unexpected appearances in the sky.\n\nBesides, our height was so great that notwithstanding the numbers of the\nsquadron, we could not easily be seen from the surface of the planet,\nand if seen at all we might be mistaken for high-flying birds.\n\n\nMars Passes Below Us.\n\nHere we remained then through the entire course of twenty-four hours and\nsaw in succession as they passed from night into day beneath our feet\nthe land of Chryse, the great continent of Tharsis, the curious region of\nintersecting canals which puzzled astronomers on the earth had named the\n\"Gordian Knot,\" the continental lands of Memnonia, Amazonia and Aeolia,\nthe mysterious centre where hundreds of vast canals came together from\nevery direction, called the Trivium Charontis; the vast circle of Elysium,\na thousand miles across, and completely surrounded by a broad green canal;\nthe continent of Libya, which, as I remembered, had been half covered\nby a tremendous inundation whose effects were visible from the earth\nin the year 1889, and finally the long, dark sea of the Syrtis Major,\nlying directly south of the land of Hellas.\n\nThe excitement and interest which we all experienced were so great that\nnot one of us took a wink of sleep during the entire twenty-four hours\nof our marvellous watch.\n\nThere are one or two things of special interest amid the multitude of\nwonderful observations that we made which I must mention here on account\nof their connection with the important events that followed soon after.\n\nJust west of the land of Chryse we saw the smaller land of Ophir,\nin the midst of which is a singular spot called the Juventae Fons,\nand this Fountain of Youth, as our astronomers, by a sort of prophetic\ninspiration, had named it, proved later to be one of the most incredible\nmarvels on the planet Mars.\n\nFurther to the west, and north from the great continent of Tharsis, we\nbeheld the immense oval-shaped land of Thaumasia containing in its centre\nthe celebrated \"Lake of the Sun,\" a circular body of water not less than\n500 miles in diameter, with dozens of great canals running away from it\nlike the spokes of a wheel in every direction, thus connecting it with\nthe ocean which surrounds it on the south and east, and with the still\nlarger canals that encircle it toward the north and west.\n\nThis Lake of the Sun came to play a great part in our subsequent\nadventures. It was evident to us from the beginning that it was the\nchief centre of population on the planet. It lies in latitude 25 degrees\nSouth and longitude about 90 degrees west.\n\n\nCompleting the Circuit.\n\nHaving completed the circuit of the Martian globe, we were moved by\nthe same feeling which every discoverer of new lands experiences, and\nimmediately returned to our original place above the land of Hellas,\nbecause since that was the first part of Mars that we had seen, we felt\na greater degree of familiarity with it than with any other portion of\nthe planet, and there, in a certain sense, we felt \"at home.\"\n\nBut, as it proved, our enemies were on the watch for us there. We had\nalmost forgotten them, so absorbed were we by the great spectacles that\nhad been unrolling themselves beneath our feet.\n\nWe ought, of course, to have been a little more cautious in approaching\nthe place where they first caught sight of us, since we might have known\nthat they would remain on the watch near that spot.\n\nBut at any rate they had seen us, and it was now too late to think of\ntaking them again by surprise.\n\nThey on their part had a surprise in store for us, which was greater\nthan any we had yet experienced.\n\nWe saw their ships assembling once more far down in the atmosphere beneath\nus, and we thought we could detect evidences of something unusual going\non upon the surface of the planet.\n\nSuddenly from the ships, and from various points on the ground beneath,\nthere rose high in the air, and carried by invisible currents in every\ndirection, immense volumes of black smoke, or vapor, which blotted out\nof sight everything below them!\n\nSouth, north, west and east, the curtain of blackness rapidly spread,\nuntil the whole face of the planet as far as our eyes could reach,\nand the airships thronging under us, were all concealed from sight!\n\nMars had played the game of the cuttlefish, which, when pursued by its\nenemies, darkens the water behind it by a sudden outgush of inky fluid,\nand thus escapes the eye of its foe.\n\n\nThe Great Smoke Cloud.\n\nOur Warriors Find the Martians to Be Foes Worth Fearing.\n\nThe eyes of man had never beheld such a spectacle!\n\nWhere a few minutes before the sunny face of a beautiful and populous\nplanet had been shining beneath us, there was now to be seen nothing but\nblack, billowing clouds, swelling up everywhere like the mouse-colored\nsmoke that pours from a great transatlantic liner when fresh coal has\njust been heaped upon her fires.\n\nIn some places the smoke spouted upward in huge jets to the height of\nseveral miles; elsewhere it eddied in vast whirlpools of inky blackness.\n\nNot a glimpse of the hidden world beneath was anywhere to be seen.\n\n\nMars Wears Its War Mask.\n\nMars had put on its war mask, and fearful indeed was the aspect of it!\n\nAfter the first pause of surprise the squadron quickly backed away\ninto the sky, rising rapidly, because, from one of the swirling eddies\nbeneath us the smoke began suddenly to pile itself up in an enormous\naerial mountain, whose peaks shot higher and higher, with apparently\nincreasing velocity, until they seemed about to engulf us with their\ntumbling ebon masses.\n\nUnaware what the nature of this mysterious smoke might be, and fearing it\nwas something more than a shield for the planet, and might be destructive\nto life, we fled before it, as before the onward sweep of a pestilence.\n\nDirectly underneath the flagship, one of the aspiring smoke peaks grew\nwith most portentous swiftness, and, notwithstanding all our efforts,\nin a little while it had enveloped us.\n\n\nThe Stifling Smoke.\n\nSeveral of us were standing on the deck of the electrical ship. We were\nalmost stifled by the smoke, and were compelled to take refuge within\nthe car, where, until the electric lights had been turned on, darkness\nso black that it oppressed the strained eyeballs prevailed.\n\nBut in this brief experience, terrifying though it was, we had learned\none thing. The smoke would kill by strangulation, but evidently there\nwas nothing especially poisonous in its nature. This fact might be of\nuse to us in our subsequent proceedings.\n\n\"This spoils our plans,\" said the commander. \"There is no use of\nremaining here for the present; let us see how far this thing extends.\"\n\nAt first we rose straight away to a height of 200 or 300 miles, thus\npassing entirely beyond the sensible limits of the atmosphere, and far\nabove the highest point that the smoke could reach.\n\nFrom this commanding point of view our line of sight extended to an\nimmense distance over the surface of Mars in all directions. Everywhere\nthe same appearance; the whole planet was evidently covered with the\nsmoke.\n\n\nA Wonderful System.\n\nA complete telegraphic system evidently connected all the strategic points\nupon Mars, so that, at a signal from the central station, the wonderful\ncurtain could be instantaneously drawn over the entire face of the planet.\n\nIn order to make certain that no part of Mars remained uncovered,\nwe dropped down again nearer to the upper level of the smoke clouds,\nand then completely circumnavigated the planet. It was thought possible\nthat on the night side no smoke would be found and that it would be\npracticable for us to make a descent there.\n\nBut when we had arrived on that side of Mars which was turned away from\nthe sun, we no longer saw beneath us, as we had done on our previous visit\nto the night hemisphere of the planet, brilliant groups and clusters of\nelectric lights beneath us. All was dark.\n\nIn fact, so completely did the great shell of smoke conceal the planet\nthat the place occupied by the latter seemed to be simply a vast black\nhole in the firmament.\n\nThe sun was hidden behind it, and so dense was the smoke that even the\nsolar rays were unable to penetrate it, and consequently there was no\natmospheric halo visible around the concealed planet.\n\nAll the sky around was filled with stars, but their countless host\nsuddenly disappeared when our eyes turned in the direction of Mars. The\ngreat black globe blotted them out without being visible itself.\n\n\nAttempts to Attack Baffled.\n\n\"Apparently we can do nothing here,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Let us return to\nthe daylight side.\"\n\nWhen we had arrived near the point where we had been when the wonderful\nphenomenon first made its appearance, we paused, and then, at the\nsuggestion of one of the chemists, dropped close to the surface of the\nsmoke curtain which had now settled down into comparative quiescence,\nin order that we might examine it a little more critically.\n\nThe flagship was driven into the smoke cloud so deeply that for a minute\nwe were again enveloped in night. A quantity of the smoke was entrapped\nin a glass jar.\n\n\nExamining the Smoke.\n\nRising again into the sunlight, the chemists began an examination of\nthe constitution of the smoke. They were unable to determine its precise\ncharacter, but they found that its density was astonishingly slight. This\naccounted for the rapidity with which it had risen, and the great height\nwhich it had attained in the comparatively light atmosphere of Mars.\n\n\"It is evident,\" said one of the chemists, \"that this smoke does not\nextend down to the surface of the planet. From what the astronomers\nsay as to the density of the air on Mars, it is probable that a clear\nspace of at least a mile in height exists between the surface of Mars\nand the lower limit of the smoke curtain. Just how deep the latter is\nwe can only determine by experiment, but it would not be surprising if\nthe thickness of this great blanket which Mars has thrown around itself\nshould prove to be a quarter or half a mile.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said one of the United States army officers, \"they have dodged\nout of sight, and I don't see why we should not dodge in and get at\nthem. If there is clear air under the smoke, as you think, why couldn't\nthe ships dart down through the curtain and come to a close tackle with\nthe Martians?\"\n\n\"It would not do at all,\" said the commander. \"We might simply run\nourselves into an ambush. No; we must stay outside, and if possible\nfight them from here.\"\n\n\nStrategic Measures Employed.\n\n\"They can't keep this thing up forever,\" said the officer. \"Perhaps the\nsmoke will clear off after a while, and then we will have a chance.\"\n\n\"Not much hope of that, I am afraid,\" said the chemist who had originally\nspoken. \"This smoke could remain floating in the atmosphere for weeks,\nand the only wonder to me is how they ever expect to get rid of it, when\nthey think their enemies have gone and they want some sunshine again.\"\n\n\"All that is mere speculation,\" said Mr. Edison; \"let us get at something\npractical. We must do one of two things: either attack them shielded\nas they are, or wait until the smoke has cleared away. The only other\nalternative, that of plunging blindly down through the curtain, is at\npresent not to be thought of.\"\n\n\"I am afraid we couldn't stand a very long siege ourselves,\" suddenly\nremarked the chief commissary of the expedition, who was one of the\nmembers of the flagship's company.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Mr. Edison sharply, turning to him.\n\n\"Well, sir, you see,\" said the commissary, stammering, \"our provisions\nwouldn't hold out.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't hold out?\" exclaimed Mr. Edison, in astonishment, \"why, we\nhave compressed and prepared provisions enough to last this squadron\nfor three years.\"\n\n\"We had, sir, when we left the earth,\" said the commissary, in apparent\ndistress, \"but I am sorry to say that something has happened.\"\n\n\"Something has happened! Explain yourself!\"\n\n\nAccident to the Stores.\n\n\"I don't know what it is, but on inspecting some of the compressed stores,\na short time ago, I found that a large number of them were destroyed,\nwhether through leakage of air, or what, I am unable to say. I sent\nto inquire as to the condition of the stores in the other ships in the\nsquadron and I found that a similar condition of things prevailed there.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" continued the commissary, \"we have only provisions enough,\nin proper condition, for about ten days' consumption.\"\n\n\"After that we shall have to forage on the country, then,\" said the\narmy officer.\n\n\"Why did you not report this before?\" demanded Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Because, sir,\" was the reply, \"the discovery was not made until after we\narrived close to Mars, and since then there has been so much excitement\nthat I have hardly had time to make an investigation and find out what\nthe precise condition of affairs is; besides, I thought we should land\nupon the planet and then we would be able to renew our supplies.\"\n\nI closely watched Mr. Edison's expression in order to see how this\nmost alarming news would affect him. Although he fully comprehended its\nfearful significance, he did not lose his self-command.\n\n\nWe Must Act Quickly.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"then it will become necessary for us to act\nquickly. Evidently we cannot wait for the smoke to clear off, even\nif there were any hope of its clearing. We must get down on Mars now,\nhaving conquered it first if possible, but anyway we must get down there,\nin order to avoid starvation.\"\n\n\"It is very lucky,\" he continued, \"that we have ten days' supply left. A\ngreat deal can be done in ten days.\"\n\nA few hours after this the commander called me aside, and said:\n\n\"I have thought it all out. I am going to reconstruct some of our\ndisintegrators, so as to increase their range and their power. Then I\nam going to have some of the astronomers of the expedition locate for\nme the most vulnerable points upon the planet, where the population is\ndensest and a hard blow would have the most effect, and I am going to\npound away at them, through the smoke, and see whether we cannot draw\nthem out of their shell.\"\n\n\nA Plan Arranged.\n\nWith his expert assistants Mr. Edison set to work at once to transform\na number of the disintegrators into still more formidable engines of\nthe same description. One of these new weapons having been distributed\nto each of the members of the squadron, the next problem was to decide\nwhere to strike.\n\nWhen we first examined the surface of the planet it will be remembered\nthat we had regarded the Lake of the Sun and its environs as being\nthe very focus of the planet. While it might also be a strong point\nof defence, yet an effective blow struck there would go to the enemy's\nheart and be more likely to bring the Martians promptly to terms than\nanything else.\n\nThe first thing, then, was to locate the Lake of the Sun on the\nsmoke-hidden surface of the planet beneath us. This was a problem that\nthe astronomers could readily solve.\n\nFortunately, in the flagship itself there was one of the star-gazing\ngentlemen who had made a specialty of the study of Mars. That planet, as I\nhave already explained, was now in opposition to the earth. The astronomer\nhad records in his pocket which enabled him, by a brief calculation,\nto say just when the Lake of the Sun would be on the meridian of Mars\nas seen from the earth. Our chronometers still kept terrestrial time;\nwe knew the exact number of days and hours that had elapsed since we had\ndeparted, and so it was possible by placing ourselves in a line between\nthe earth and Mars to be practically in the situation of an astronomer\nin his observatory at home.\n\nThen it was only necessary to wait for the hour when the Lake of the Sun\nwould be upon the meridian of Mars in order to be certain what the true\ndirection of the latter from the flagship was.\n\nHaving thus located the heart of our foe behind its shield of darkness,\nwe prepared to strike.\n\n\nThe Smoke Must Be Shattered.\n\n\"I have ascertained,\" said Mr. Edison, \"the vibration period of the smoke,\nso that it will be easy for us to shatter it into invisible atoms. You\nwill see that every stroke of the disintegrators will open a hole through\nthe black curtain. If their field of destruction could be made wide\nenough, we might in that manner clear away the entire covering of smoke,\nbut all that we shall really be able to do will be to puncture it with\nholes, which will, perhaps, enable us to catch glimpses of the surface\nbeneath. In that manner we may be able more effectually to concentrate\nour fire upon the most vulnerable points.\"\n\n\nThe Blow--And Its Effect.\n\nEverything being prepared, and the entire squadron having assembled\nto watch the effect of the opening blow and be ready to follow it up,\nMr. Edison himself poised one of the new disintegrators, which was too\nlarge to be carried in the hand, and, following the direction indicated\nby the calculations of the astronomers, launched the vibratory discharge\ninto the ocean of blackness beneath.\n\n\nA Terrible Encounter.\n\nThe Martians and Our Warriors Fight a Battle to the Death.\n\nInstantly there opened beneath us a huge well-shaped hole, from which\nthe black clouds rolled violently back in every direction.\n\nThrough this opening we saw the gleam of brilliant lights beneath.\n\nWe had made a hit.\n\n\"It is the Lake of the Sun!\" shouted the astronomer who furnished the\ncalculation by means of which its position had been discovered.\n\nAnd, indeed, it was the Lake of the Sun. While the opening in the clouds\nmade by the discharge was not wide, yet it sufficed to give us a view\nof a portion of the curving shore of the lake, which was ablaze with\nelectric lights.\n\nWhether our shot had done any damage, beyond making the circular opening\nin the cloud curtain, we could not tell, for almost immediately the\nsurrounding black smoke masses billowed in to fill up the hole.\n\nBut in the brief glimpse we had caught sight of two or three large air\nships hovering in space above that part of the Lake of the Sun and its\nbordering city which we had beheld. It seemed to me in the brief glance\nI had that one ship had been touched by the discharge and was wandering\nin an erratic manner. But the clouds closed in so rapidly that I not\nbe certain.\n\n\nPenetrating the Cloud.\n\nAnyhow, we had demonstrated one thing, and that was that we could\npenetrate the cloud shield and reach the Martians in their hiding place.\n\nIt had been prearranged that the first discharge from the flagship\nshould be a signal for the concentration of the fire of all the other\nships upon the same spot.\n\nA little hesitation, however, occurred, and a half a minute had elapsed\nbefore the disintegrators from the other members of the squadron were\ngot into play.\n\n\nThe Martians' Artificial Day.\n\nThen, suddenly we saw an immense commotion in the cloud beneath us. It\nseemed to be beaten and hurled in every direction and punctured like\na sieve with nearly a hundred great circular holes. Through these gaps\nwe could see clearly a large region of the planet's surface, with many\nairships floating above it, and the blaze of innumerable electric lights\nilluminating it. The Martians had created an artificial day under the\ncurtain.\n\nThis time there was no question that the blow had been effective. Four\nor five of the airships, partially destroyed, tumbled headlong toward\nthe ground, while even from our great distance there was unmistakable\nevidence that fearful execution had been done among the crowded structures\nalong the shore of the Lake.\n\nAs each of our ships possessed but one of the new disintegrators, and\nsince a minute or so was required to adjust them for a fresh discharge, we\nremained for a little while inactive after delivering the blow. Meanwhile\nthe cloud curtain, though rent to shreds by the concentrated discharge\nof the disintegrators, quickly became a uniform black sheet again,\nhiding everything.\n\nWe had just had time to congratulate ourselves on the successful opening\nof our bombardment, and the disintegrator of the flagship was poised\nfor another discharge, when suddenly out of the black expanse beneath,\nquivered immense electric beams, clear cut and straight as bars of steel,\nbut dazzling our eyes with unendurable brilliance.\n\nIt was the reply of the Martians to our attack.\n\n\nDevastating Our Army.\n\nThree or four of the electrical ships were seriously damaged, and one,\nclose beside the flagship, changed color, withered and collapsed, with the\nsame sickening phenomena that had made our hearts shudder when the first\ndisaster of this kind occurred during our brief battle over the asteroid.\n\nAnother score of our comrades were gone, and yet we had hardly begun\nthe fight.\n\nGlancing at the other ships, which had been injured, I saw that the\ndamage to them was not so serious, although they were evidently hors de\ncombat for the present.\n\nOur fighting blood was now boiling and we did not stop long to count\nour losses.\n\n\"Into the smoke!\" was the signal, and the ninety and more electric ships\nwhich still remained in condition for action immediately shot downward.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI.\n\n\nA Dash Into the Smoke.\n\nIt was a wild plunge. We kept off the decks while rushing through the\nblinding smoke, but the instant we emerged below, where we found ourselves\nstill a mile above the ground, we were out again, ready to strike.\n\nI have simply a confused recollection of flashing lights beneath, and a\ngreat, dark arch of clouds above, out of which our ships seemed dropping\non all sides, and then the fray burst upon and around us, and no man\ncould see or notice anything except by half-comprehended glances.\n\nAlmost in an instant, it seemed, a swarm of airships surrounded us,\nwhile from what, for lack of a more descriptive name, I shall call\nthe forts about the Lake of the Sun, leaped tongues of electric fire,\nbefore which some of our ships were driven like bits of flaming paper\nin a high wind, gleaming for a moment, then curling up and gone forever!\n\n\nNever Was Such a Conflict.\n\nIt was an awful sight; but the battle fever was raging in us, and we,\non our part, were not idle.\n\nEvery man carried a disintegrator, and these hand instruments, together\nwith those of heavier calibre on the ships poured their resistless\nvibrations in every direction through the quivering air.\n\nThe airships of the Martians were destroyed by the score, but yet they\nflocked upon us thicker and faster.\n\nWe dropped lower and our blows fell upon the forts, and upon the\nwidespread city bordering the Lake of the Sun. We almost entirely\nsilenced the fire of one of the forts; but there were forty more in full\naction within reach of our eyes!\n\nSome of the metallic buildings were partly unroofed by the disintegrators\nand some had their walls riddled and fell with thundering crashes, whose\nsound rose to our ears above the hellish din of battle. I caught glimpses\nof giant forms struggling in the ruins and rushing wildly through the\nstreets, but there was no time to see anything clearly.\n\n\nThe Flagship Charmed!\n\nOur flagship seemed charmed. A crowd of airships hung upon it like a\nswarm of angry bees, and, at times, one could not see for the lightning\nstrokes--yet we escaped destruction, while ourselves dealing death on\nevery hand.\n\nIt was a glorious fight, but it was not war; no, it was not war. We really\nhad no more chance of ultimate success amid that multitude of enemies\nthan a prisoner running the gauntlet in a crowd of savages has of escape.\n\nA conviction of the hopelessness of the contest finally forced itself\nupon our minds, and the shattered squadron, which had kept well together\namid the storm of death, was signalled to retreat.\n\nShaking off their pursuers, as a hunted bear shakes off the dogs, sixty\nof the electrical ships rose up through the clouds where more than ninety\nhad gone down!\n\nMadly we rushed upward through the vast curtain and continued our flight\nto a great elevation, far beyond the reach of the awful artillery of\nthe enemy.\n\n\nForced to Retreat.\n\nLooking back it seemed the very mouth of hell that we had escaped from.\n\nThe Martians did not for an instant cease their fire, even when we\nwere far beyond their reach. With furious persistence they blazed away\nthrough the cloud curtains, and the vivid spikes of lightning shuddered\nso swiftly on one another's track that they were like a flaming halo of\nelectric lances around the frowning helmet of the War Planet.\n\nBut after a while they stopped their terrific sparring, and once more\nthe immense globe assumed the appearance of a vast ball of black smoke,\nstill wildly agitated by the recent disturbance, but exhibiting no\nopening through which we could discern what was going on beneath.\n\nEvidently the Martians believed they had finished us.\n\n\nDespair Seizes Us.\n\nAt no time since the beginning of our adventure had it appeared to me\nquite so hopeless, reckless and mad as it seemed at present.\n\nWe had suffered fearful losses, and yet what had we accomplished? We had\nwon two fights on the asteroid, it is true, but then we had overwhelming\nnumbers on our side.\n\nNow we were facing millions on their own ground, and our very first\nassault had resulted in a disastrous repulse, with the loss of at least\nthirty electric ships and 600 men!\n\nEvidently we could not endure this sort of thing. We must find some\nother means of assailing Mars or else give up the attempt.\n\nBut the latter was not to be thought of. It was no mere question of\nself-pride, however, and no consideration of the tremendous interests\nat stake, which would compel us to continue our apparently vain attempt.\n\n\nNo Hope in Sight.\n\nOur provisions could last only a few days longer. The supply would not\ncarry us one-quarter of the way back to the earth, and we must therefore\nremain here and literally conquer or die.\n\nIn this extremity a consultation of the principal officers was called\nupon the deck of the flagship.\n\nHere the suggestion was made that we should attempt to effect by strategy\nwhat we had failed to do by force.\n\nAn old army officer who had served in many wars against the cunning\nIndians of the West, Colonel Alonzo Jefferson Smith, was the author of\nthis suggestion.\n\n\"Let us circumvent them,\" he said. \"We can do it in this way. The chances\nare that all of the available fighting force of the planet Mars is now\nconcentrated on this side and in the neighborhood of the Lake of the Sun.\"\n\n\nFormulating a \"Last Hope.\"\n\n\"Possibly, by some kind of X-ray business, they can only see us dimly\nthrough the clouds, and if we get a little further away they will not\nbe able to see us at all.\"\n\n\"Now, I suggest that a certain number of the electrical ships be withdrawn\nfrom the squadron to a great distance, while the remainder stay here;\nor, better still, approach to a point just beyond the reach of those\nstreaks of lightning, and begin a bombardment of the clouds without\npaying any attention to whether the strokes reach through the clouds\nand do any damage or not.\"\n\n\"This will induce the Martians to believe that we are determined to\npress our attack at this point.\"\n\n\"In the meantime, while these ships are raising a hullabaloo on this\nside of the planet, and drawing their fire, as much as possible, without\nrunning into any actual danger, let the others which have been selected\nfor the purpose, sail rapidly around to the other side of Mars and take\nthem in the rear.\"\n\nIt was not perfectly clear what Colonel Smith intended to do after the\nlanding had been effected in the rear of the Martians, but still there\nseemed a good deal to be said for his suggestion, and it would, at any\nrate, if carried out, enable us to learn something about the condition\nof things on the planet, and perhaps furnish us with a hint as to how\nwe could best proceed in the further prosecution of the siege.\n\nAccordingly it was resolved that about twenty ships should be told off\nfor this movement, and Colonel Smith himself was placed in command.\n\nAt my desire I accompanied the new commander in his flagship.\n\n\nFlank Movements.\n\nRising to a considerable elevation in order that there might be no risk\nof being seen, we began our flank movement while the remaining ships,\nin accordance with the understanding, dropped nearer the curtain of\ncloud and commenced a bombardment with the disintegrators, which caused\na tremendous commotion in the clouds, opening vast gaps in them, and\noccasionally revealing a glimpse of the electric lights on the planet,\nalthough it was evident that the vibratory currents did not reach the\nground. The Martians immediately replied to this renewed attack, and\nagain the cloud-covered globe bristled with lightning, which flashed so\nfiercely out of the blackness below that the stoutest hearts among us\nquailed, although we were situated well beyond the danger.\n\nBut this sublime spectacle rapidly vanished from our eyes when, having\nattained a proper elevation, we began our course toward the opposite\nhemisphere of the planet.\n\nWe guided our flight by the stars, and from our knowledge of the rotation\nperiod of Mars, and the position which the principal points on its\nsurface must occupy at certain hours, we were able to tell what part of\nthe planet lay beneath us.\n\nHaving completed our semi-circuit, we found ourselves on the night side\nof Mars, and determined to lose no time in executing our coup. But it\nwas deemed best that an exploration should first be made by a single\nelectrical ship, and Colonel Smith naturally wished to undertake the\nadventure with his own vessel.\n\n\nDropping to the Planet.\n\nWe dropped rapidly through the black cloud curtain, which proved to be at\nleast half a mile in thickness, and then suddenly emerged, as if suspended\nat the apex of an enormous dome, arching above the surface of the planet\na mile beneath us, which sparkled on all sides with innumerable lights.\n\nThese lights were so numerous and so brilliant as to produce a faint\nimitation of daylight, even at our immense height above the ground,\nand the dome of cloud out of which we had emerged assumed a soft fawn\ncolor that produced an indescribably beautiful effect.\n\nFor a moment we recoiled from our undertaking, and arrested the motion\nof the electric ship.\n\nBut on closely examining the surface beneath us we found that there\nwas a broad region, where comparatively few bright lights were to be\nseen. From my knowledge of the geography of Mars I knew that this was a\npart of the Land of Ausonia, situated a few hundred miles northeast of\nHellas, where we had first seen the planet.\n\nEvidently it was not so thickly populated as some of the other parts of\nMars, and its comparative darkness was an attraction to us. We determined\nto approach within a few hundred feet of the ground with the electric\nship, and then, in case no enemies appeared, to visit the soil itself.\n\n\"Perhaps we shall see or hear something that will be of use to us,\"\nsaid Colonel Smith, \"and for the purposes of this first reconnaissance\nit is better that we should be few in number. The other ships will await\nour return, and at any rate we shall not be gone long.\"\n\nAs our car approached the ground we found ourselves near the tops of\nsome lofty trees.\n\n\"This will do,\" said Colonel Smith, to the electrical steersman. \"Stay\nright here.\"\n\nHe and I then lowered ourselves into the branches of the trees, each\ncarrying a small disintegrator, and cautiously clambered down to the\nground.\n\n\nLanding On Mars.\n\nWe believed we were the first of the descendants of Adam to set foot on\nthe planet of Mars.\n\n\nAn Experience On Mars.\n\nThe Great Planet Exhibits Its Wonders to Our Warriors.\n\nAt first we suffered somewhat from the effects of the rare atmosphere. It\nwas so lacking in density that it resembled the air on the summits of\nthe loftiest terrestrial mountains.\n\nHaving reached the foot of the tree in safety, we lay down for a moment\non the ground to recover ourselves and to become accustomed to our new\nsurroundings.\n\nA thrill, born half of wonder, half of incredulity, ran through me at the\ntouch of the soil of Mars. Here was I, actually on that planet, which\nhad seemed so far away, so inaccessible, and so full of mysteries when\nviewed from the earth. And yet, surrounding me, were things--gigantic,\nit is true--but still resembling and recalling the familiar sights of\nmy own world.\n\nAfter a little while our lungs became accustomed to the rarity of the\natmosphere and we experienced a certain stimulation in breathing.\n\n\nStarting on our Travels.\n\nWe then got upon our feet and stepped out from under the shadow of the\ngigantic tree. High above we could faintly see our electrical ship,\ngently swaying in the air close to the treetop.\n\nThere were no electric lights in our immediate neighborhood, but we\nnoticed that the whole surface of the planet around us was gleaming\nwith them, producing an effect like the glow of a great city seen from\na distance at night. The glare was faintly reflected from the vast dome\nof clouds above, producing the general impression of a moonlight night\nupon the earth.\n\nIt was a wonderfully quiet and beautiful spot where we had come down. The\nair had a delicate feel and a bracing temperature, while a soft breeze\nsoughed through the leaves of the tree above our heads.\n\nNot far away was the bank of a canal, bordered by a magnificent avenue\nshaded by a double row of immense umbrageous trees.\n\nWe approached the canal, and, getting upon the road, turned to the left\nto make an exploration in that direction. The shadow of the trees falling\nupon the roadway produced a dense gloom, in the midst of which we felt\nthat we should be safe, unless the Martians had eyes like those of cats.\n\n\nAn Alarming Encounter.\n\nAs we pushed along, our hearts, I confess, beating a little quickly,\na shadow stirred in front of us.\n\nSomething darker than the night itself approached.\n\nAs it drew near it assumed the appearance of an enormous dog, as tall\nas an ox, which ran swiftly our way with a threatening motion of its\nhead. But before it could even utter a snarl the whirr of Colonel Smith's\ndisintegrator was heard and the creature vanished in the shadow.\n\n\"Gracious, did you ever see such a beast?\" said the Colonel. \"Why,\nhe was as big as a grizzly.\"\n\n\"The people he belonged to must be near by,\" I said. \"Very likely he\nwas a watch on guard.\"\n\n\"But I see no signs of a habitation.\"\n\n\"True, but you observe there is a thick hedge on the side of the road\nopposite the canal. If we get through that perhaps we shall catch sight\nof something.\"\n\n\nA Palace in View.\n\nCautiously we pushed our way through the hedge, which was composed\nof shrubs as large as small trees, and very thick at the bottom, and,\nhaving traversed it, found ourselves in a great meadow-like expanse which\nmight have been a lawn. At a considerable distance, in the midst of a\nclump of trees, a large building towered skyward, its walls of some red\nmetal, gleaming like polished copper in the soft light that fell from\nthe cloud dome.\n\nThere were no lights around the building itself, and we saw nothing\ncorresponding to windows on that side which faced us, but toward the\nright a door was evidently open, and out of this streamed a brilliant\nshaft of illumination, which lay bright upon the lawn, then crossed the\nhighway through an opening in the hedge, and gleamed on the water of\nthe canal beyond.\n\nWhere we stood the ground had evidently been recently cleared, and there\nwas no obstruction, but as we crept closer to the house--for our curiosity\nhad now become irresistible--we found ourselves crawling through grass so\ntall that if we had stood erect it would have risen well above our heads.\n\n\nTaking Precautions.\n\n\"This affords good protection,\" said Colonel Smith, recalling his\nadventures on the Western plains. \"We can get close in to the Indians--I\nbeg pardon, I mean the Martians--without being seen.\"\n\nHeavens, what an adventure was this! To be crawling about in the night\non the face of another world and venturing, perhaps, into the jaws of\na danger which human experience could not measure!\n\nBut on we went, and in a little while we had emerged from the tall grass\nand were somewhat startled by the discovery that we had got close to\nthe wall of the building.\n\nCarefully we crept around toward the open door.\n\nAs we neared it we suddenly stopped as if we had been stricken with\ninstantaneous paralysis.\n\nOut of the door floated, on the soft night air, the sweetest music I\nhave ever listened to.\n\n\nA Monstrous Surprise.\n\nIt carried me back in an instant to my own world. It was the music of\nthe earth. It was the melodious expression of a human soul. It thrilled\nus both to the heart's core.\n\n\"My God!\" exclaimed Colonel Smith. \"What can that be? Are we dreaming,\nor where in heaven's name are we?\"\n\nStill the enchanting harmony floated out upon the air.\n\nWhat the instrument was I could not tell; but the sound seemed more nearly\nto resemble that of a violin than of anything else I could think of.\n\n\nMagnificent Music.\n\nWhen we first heard it the strains were gentle, sweet, caressing and\nfull of an infinite depth of feeling, but in a little while its tone\nchanged, and it became a magnificent march, throbbing upon the air in\nstirring notes that set our hearts beating in unison with its stride\nand inspiring in us a courage that we had not felt before.\n\nThen it drifted into a wild fantasia, still inexpressibly sweet, and from\nthat changed again into a requiem or lament, whose mellifluous tide of\nharmony swept our thoughts back again to the earth.\n\n\"I can endure this no longer,\" I said. \"I must see who it is that makes\nthat music. It is the product of a human heart and must come from the\ntouch of human fingers.\"\n\nWe carefully shifted our position until we stood in the blaze of light\nthat poured out of the door.\n\nThe doorway was an immense arched opening, magnificently ornamented,\nrising to a height of, I should say, not less than twenty or twenty-five\nfeet and broad in proportion. The door itself stood widely open and it,\ntogether with all of its fittings and surroundings, was composed of the\nsame beautiful red metal.\n\n\nA Beautiful Girl!\n\nStepping out a little way into the light I could see within the door\nan immense apartment, glittering on all sides with metallic ornaments\nand gems and lighted from the centre by a great chandelier of electric\ncandles.\n\nIn the middle of the great floor, holding the instrument delicately\npoised, and still awaking its ravishing voice, stood a figure, the sight\nof which almost stopped my breath.\n\nIt was a slender sylph of a girl!\n\nA girl of my own race: a human being here upon the planet Mars!\n\nHer hair was loosely coiled and she was attired in graceful white drapery.\n\n\"By ----!\" cried Colonel Smith, \"she's human!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII.\n\n\nStill the bewildering strains of the music came to our ears, and yet we\nstood there unperceived, though in the full glare of the chandelier.\n\nThe girl's face was presented in profile. It was exquisite in beauty,\npale, delicate with a certain pleading sadness which stirred us to\nthe heart.\n\nAn element of romance and a touch of personal interest such as we had\nnot looked for suddenly entered into our adventure.\n\nColonel Smith's mind still ran back to the perils of the plains.\n\n\nA Human Prisoner.\n\n\"She is a prisoner,\" he said, \"and by the Seven Devils of Dona Ana we'll\nnot leave her here. But where are the hellhounds themselves?\"\n\nOur attention had been so absorbed by the sight of the girl that we had\nscarcely thought of looking to see if there was any one else in the room.\n\nGlancing beyond her, I now perceived sitting in richly decorated chairs\nthree or four gigantic Martians. They were listening to the music as\nif charmed.\n\nThe whole story told itself. This girl, if not their slave, was at any\nrate under their control, and she was furnishing entertainment for them\nby her musical skill. The fact that they could find pleasure in music\nso beautiful was, perhaps, an indication that they were not really as\nsavage as they seemed.\n\nYet our hearts went out to the girl, and were turned against them with\nan uncontrollable hatred.\n\nThey were of the same remorseless race with those who so lately had lain\nwaste our fair earth and who would have completed its destruction had\nnot Providence interfered in our behalf.\n\nSingularly enough, although we stood full in the light, they had not\nyet seen us.\n\n\nMartians Guarding Her.\n\nSuddenly the girl, moved by what impulse I know not, turned her face in\nour direction. Her eyes fell upon us. She paused abruptly in her playing,\nand her instrument dropped to the floor. Then she uttered a cry, and\nwith extended arms ran toward us.\n\nBut when she was near she stopped abruptly, the glad look fading from\nher face, and started back with terror-stricken eyes, as if, after all,\nshe had found us not what she expected.\n\nThen for an instant she looked more intently at us, her countenance\ncleared once more, and, overcome by some strange emotion, her eyes filled\nwith tears, and, drawing a little nearer, she stretched forth her hands\nto us appealingly.\n\nMeanwhile the Martians had started to their feet. They looked down upon\nus in astonishment. We were like pigmies to them; like little gnomes\nwhich had sprung out of the ground at their feet.\n\nOne of the giants seized some kind of a weapon and started forward with\na threatening gesture.\n\n\nThe Girl Appeals to Us.\n\nThe girl sprang to my side and grasped my arm with a cry of fear.\n\nThis seemed to throw the Martian into a sudden frenzy, and he raised\nhis arms to strike.\n\nBut the disintegrator was in my hand.\n\nMy rage was equal to his.\n\nI felt the concentrated vengeance of the earth quivering through me as\nI pressed the button of the disintegrator and, sweeping it rapidly up\nand down, saw the gigantic form that confronted me melt into nothingness.\n\nThere were three other giants in the room, and they had been on the point\nof following up the attack of their comrade. But when he disappeared\nfrom before their eyes, they paused, staring in amazement at the place\nwhere, but a moment before, he had stood, but where now only the metal\nweapon he had wielded lay on the floor.\n\nAt first they started back, and seemed on the point of fleeing; then,\nwith a second glance, perceiving again how small and insignificant we\nwere, all three together advanced upon us.\n\nThe girl sank trembling on her knees.\n\nIn the meantime I had readjusted my disintegrator for another discharge,\nand Colonel Smith stood by me with the light of battle upon his face.\n\n\"Sweep the discharge across the three,\" I exclaimed. \"Otherwise there\nwill be one left and before we can fire again he will crush us.\"\n\n\nThe Martians Are Killed.\n\nThe whirr of the two instruments sounded simultaneously, and with a quick,\nhorizontal motion we swept the lines of force around in such a manner\nthat all three of the Martians were caught by the vibratory streams and\nactually cut in two.\n\nLong gaps were opened in the wall of the room behind them, where the\ndestroying currents had passed, for with wrathful fierceness, we had\nrun the vibrations through half a gamut on the index.\n\nThe victory was ours. There were no other enemies, that we could see,\nin the house.\n\nYet at any moment others might make their appearance, and what more we\ndid must be done quickly.\n\nThe girl evidently was as much amazed as the Martians had been by the\neffects which we had produced. Still she was not terrified, and continued\nto cling to us and to glance beseechingly into our faces, expressing in\nher every look and gesture the fact that she knew we were of her own race.\n\nBut clearly she could not speak our tongue, for the words she uttered\nwere unintelligible.\n\nColonel Smith, whose long experience in Indian warfare had made him\nintensely practical, did not lose his military instincts, even in the\nmidst of events so strange.\n\n\"It occurs to me,\" he said, \"that we have got a chance at the enemies'\nsupplies. Suppose we begin foraging right here. Let's see if this girl\ncan't show us the commissary department.\"\n\nHe immediately began to make signs to the girl to indicate that he\nwas hungry.\n\n\nThe Girl Understands Us.\n\nA look of comprehension flitted over her features, and, seizing our\nhands, she led us into an adjoining apartment and pointed to a number\nof metallic boxes. One of these she opened, taking out of it a kind\nof cake, which she placed between her teeth, breaking off a very small\nportion and then handing it to us, motioning that we should eat, but at\nthe same time showing us that we ought to take only a small quantity.\n\n\"Thank God! It's compressed food,\" said Colonel Smith. \"I thought these\nMartians with their wonderful civilization would be up to that. And\nit's mighty lucky for us, because, without overburdening ourselves,\nif we can find one or two more caches like this we shall be able to\nreprovision the entire fleet. But we must get reinforcements before we\ncan take possession of the fodder.\"\n\n\nThe Prisoner Is Rescued.\n\nAccordingly we hurried out into the night, passed into the roadway, and,\ntaking the girl with us, ran as rapidly as possible to the foot of the\ntree where we had made our descent. Then we signalled to the electric\nship to drop down to the level of the ground.\n\nThis was quickly done, the girl was taken aboard, and a dozen men, under\nour guidance, hastened back to the house, where we loaded ourselves with\nthe compressed provisions and conveyed them to the ship.\n\n\nBeautiful Girl Prisoner.\n\nEstablishing the Identity of the Martians' Captive.\n\nOn this second trip to the mysterious house we had discovered another\napartment containing a very large number of the metallic boxes, filled\nwith compressed food.\n\n\"By Jove, it is a store house,\" said Colonel Smith. \"We must get more\nforce and carry it all off. Gracious, but this is a lucky night. We can\nreprovision the whole fleet from this room.\"\n\n\"I thought it singular,\" I said, \"that with the exception of the girl\nwhom we have rescued no women were seen in the house. Evidently the\nlights over yonder indicate the location of a considerable town, and it\nis quite probable that this building, without windows, and so strongly\nconstructed, is the common storehouse, where the provisions for the town\nare kept. The fellows we killed must have been the watchmen in charge\nof the storehouse, and they were treating themselves to a little music\nfrom the slave girl when we happened to come upon them.\"\n\n\nA New Food Supply.\n\nWith the utmost haste several of the other electrical ships, waiting\nabove the cloud curtain, were summoned to descend, and, with more than a\nhundred men, we returned to the building, and this time almost entirely\nexhausted its stores, each man carrying as much as he could stagger under.\n\nFortunately our proceedings had been conducted without much noise,\nand the storehouse being situated at a considerable distance from other\nbuildings, none of the Martians, except those who would never tell the\nstory, had known of our arrival or of our doings on the planet.\n\n\"Now, we'll return and surprise Edison with the news,\" said Colonel Smith.\n\nOur ship was the last to pass up through the clouds, and it was a strange\nsight to watch the others as one after another they rose toward the\ngreat dome, entered it, though from below it resembled a solid vault of\ngrayish-pink marble, and disappeared.\n\n\nSunshine Again.\n\nWe quickly followed them, and having penetrated the enormous curtain,\nwere considerably surprised on emerging at the upper side to find that\nthe sun was shining brilliantly upon us. It will be remembered that it\nwas night on this side of Mars when we went down, but our adventure had\noccupied several hours, and now Mars had so far turned upon its axis\nthat the portion of its surface over which we were had come around into\nthe sunlight.\n\nWe knew that the squadron which we had left besieging the Lake of the Sun\nmust also have been carried around in a similar manner, passing into the\nnight while the side of the planet where we were was emerging into day.\n\nOur shortest way back would be by travelling westward, because then\nwe should be moving in a direction opposite to that in which the\nplanet rotated, and the main squadron, sharing that rotation, would be\ncontinually moving in our direction.\n\nBut to travel westward was to penetrate once more into the night side\nof the planet.\n\nThe prows, if I may so call them, of our ships were accordingly turned\nin the direction of the vast shadow which Mars was invisibly projecting\ninto space behind it, and on entering that shadow the sun disappeared\nfrom our eyes, and once more the huge hidden globe beneath us became a\nblack chasm among the stars.\n\nNow that we were in the neighborhood of a globe capable of imparting\nconsiderable weight to all things under the influence of its attraction\nthat peculiar condition which I have before described as existing in\nthe midst of space, where there was neither up nor down for us, had\nceased. Here where we had weight \"up\" and \"down\" had resumed their old\nmeanings. \"Down\" was toward the centre of Mars, and \"up\" was away from\nthat centre.\n\n\nThe Two Moons of Mars.\n\nStanding on the deck, and looking overhead as we swiftly ploughed our\nsmooth way at a great height through the now imperceptible atmosphere\nof the planet, I saw the two moons of Mars meeting in the sky exactly\nabove us.\n\nBefore our arrival at Mars, there had been considerable discussion among\nthe learned men as to the advisability of touching at one of their moons,\nand when the discovery was made that our provisions were nearly exhausted,\nit had been suggested that the Martian satellites might furnish us with\nan additional supply.\n\nBut it had appeared a sufficient reply to this suggestion that the moons\nof Mars are both insignificant bodies, not much larger than the asteroid\nwe had fallen in with, and that there could not possibly be any form of\nvegetation or other edible products upon them.\n\nThis view having prevailed, we had ceased to take an interest in the\nsatellites, further than to regard them as objects of great curiosity\non account of their motions.\n\nThe nearer of these moons, Phobos, is only 3,700 miles from the surface\nof Mars, and we watched it travelling around the planet three times in\nthe course of every day. The more distant one, Deimos, 12,500 miles away,\nrequired considerably more than one day to make its circuit.\n\nIt now happened that the two had come into conjunction, as I have said,\njust over our heads, and, throwing myself down on my back on the deck\nof the electrical ship, for a long time I watched the race between the\ntwo satellites, until Phobos, rapidly gaining upon the other, had left\nits rival far behind.\n\nSuddenly Colonel Smith, who took very little interest in these\nastronomical curiosities, touched me, and pointing ahead, said:\n\n\"There they are.\"\n\n\nRejoining the Fleet.\n\nI looked, and sure enough there were the signal lights of the principal\nsquadron, and as we gazed we occasionally saw, darting up from the vast\ncloud mass beneath, an electric bayonet, fiercely thrust into the sky,\nwhich showed that the siege was still actively going on, and that the\nMartians were jabbing away at their invisible enemies outside the curtain.\n\nIn a short time the two fleets had joined, and Colonel Smith and I\nimmediately transferred ourselves to the flagship.\n\n\"Well, what have you done?\" asked Mr. Edison, while others crowded around\nwith eager attention.\n\n\"If we have not captured their provision train,\" said Colonel Smith, \"we\nhave done something just about as good. We have foraged on the country,\nand have collected a supply that I reckon will last this fleet for at\nleast a month.\"\n\n\"What's that? What's that?\"\n\n\"It's just what I say,\" and Colonel Smith brought out of his pocket one\nof the square cakes of compressed food. \"Set your teeth in that, and see\nwhat you think of it, but don't take too much, for it's powerful strong.\"\n\n\"I say,\" he continued, \"we have got enough of that stuff to last us all\nfor a month, but we've done more than that; we have got a surprise for\nyou that will make you open your eyes. Just wait a minute.\"\n\n\nCaring for the Rescued Girl.\n\nColonel Smith made a signal to the electrical ship which we had just\nquitted to draw near. It came alongside, so that one could step from\nits deck onto the flagship. Colonel Smith disappeared for a minute in\nthe interior of his ship, then re-emerged, leading the girl whom we had\nfound upon the planet.\n\n\"Take her inside, quick,\" he said, \"for she is not used to this thin air.\"\n\nIn fact, we were at so great an elevation that the rarity of the\natmosphere now compelled us all to wear our air-tight suits, and the girl,\nnot being thus attired, would have fallen unconscious on the deck if we\nhad not instantly removed her to the interior of the car.\n\nThere she quickly recovered from the effects of the deprivation of air\nand looked about her, pale, astonished, but yet apparently without fear.\n\nEvery motion of this girl convinced me that she not only recognized\nus as members of her own race, but that she felt that her only hope\nlay in our aid. Therefore, strange as we were to her in many respects,\nnevertheless she did not think that she was in danger while among us.\n\nThe circumstances under which we had found her were quickly explained. Her\nbeauty, her strange fate and the impenetrable mystery which surrounded\nher excited universal admiration and wonder.\n\n\nHow Came She on Mars?\n\n\"How did she get on Mars?\" was the question that everybody asked, and\nthat nobody could answer.\n\nBut while all were crowding around and overwhelming the poor girl with\ntheir staring, suddenly she burst into tears, and then, with arms\noutstretched in the same appealing manner which had so stirred our\nsympathies when we first saw her in the house of the Martians, she broke\nforth in a wild recitation, which was half a song and half a wail.\n\nAs she went on I noticed that a learned professor of languages\nfrom the University of Heidelberg was listening to her with intense\nattention. Several times he appeared to be on the point of breaking in\nwith an exclamation. I could plainly see that he was becoming more and\nmore excited as the words poured from the girl's lips. Occasionally\nhe nodded and muttered, smiling to himself. Her song finished, the\ngirl sank half-exhausted upon the floor. She was lifted and placed in\na reclining position at the side of the car.\n\nThen the Heidelberg professor stepped to the centre of the car, in the\nsight of all, and in a most impressive manner said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, our sister.\"\n\n\"I have her tongue recognized! The language that she speaks, the roots\nof the great Indo-European, or Aryan stock, contains.\"\n\n\"This girl, gentlemen, to the oldest family of the human race\nbelongs. Her language every tongue that now upon the earth is spoken\nantedates. Convinced am I that it that great original speech is from\nwhich have all the languages of the civilized world sprung.\"\n\n\"How she here came, so many millions of miles from the earth, a great\nmystery is. But it shall be penetrated, and it is from her own lips that\nwe the truth shall learn, because not difficult to us shall it be the\nlanguage that she speaks to acquire since to our own it is akin.\"\n\n\nThe Professor's Astonishing Statement.\n\nThis announcement of the Heidelberg professor stirred us all most\nprofoundly. It not only deepened our interest in the beautiful girl\nwhom we had rescued, but, in a dim way, it gave us reason to hope that\nwe should yet discover some means of mastering the Martians by dealing\nthem a blow from within.\n\nIt had been expected, the reader will remember, that the Martian whom we\nhad made prisoner on the asteroid, might be of use to us in a similar way,\nand for that reason great efforts had been made to acquire his language,\nand considerable progress had been effected in that direction.\n\nBut from the moment of our arrival at Mars itself, and especially after\nthe battles began, the prisoner had resumed his savage and uncommunicative\ndisposition, and had seemed continually to be expecting that we would\nfall victims to the prowess of his fellow beings, and that he would\nbe released. How an outlaw, such as he evidently was, who had been\ncaught in the act of robbing the Martian gold mines, could expect to\nescape punishment on returning to his native planet it was difficult\nto see. Nevertheless, so strong are the ties of race we could plainly\nperceive that all his sympathies were for his own people.\n\nIn fact, in consequence of his surly manner, and his attempts to escape,\nhe had been more strictly bound than before and to get him out of the\nway had been removed from the flagship, which was already overcrowded,\nand placed in one of the other electric ships, and this ship--as it\nhappened--was one of those which were lost in the great battle beneath\nthe clouds. So after all, the Martian had perished, by a vengeful stroke\nlaunched from his native globe.\n\nBut Providence had placed in our hands a far better interpreter than he\ncould ever have been. This girl of our own race would need no urging,\nor coercion, on our part in order to induce her to reveal any secrets\nof the Martians that might be useful in our further proceedings.\n\nBut one thing was first necessary to be done.\n\nWe must learn to talk with her.\n\n\nLearning Her Language.\n\nBut for the discovery of the store of provisions it would have been\nimpossible for us to spare the time needed to acquire the language of\nthe girl, but now that we had been saved from the danger of starvation,\nwe could prolong the siege for several weeks, employing the intervening\ntime to the best advantage.\n\nThe terrible disaster which we had suffered in the great battle above\nthe Lake of the Sun, wherein we had lost nearly a third of our entire\nforce, had been quite sufficient to convince us that our only hope of\nvictory lay in dealing the Martians some paralyzing stroke that at one\nblow would deprive them of the power of resistance. A victory that cost\nus the loss of a single ship would be too dearly purchased now.\n\nHow to deal that blow, and first of all, how to discover the means of\ndealing it, were at present the uppermost problems in our minds.\n\nThe only hope for us lay in the girl.\n\nIf, as there was every reason to believe, she was familiar with the\nways and secrets of the Martians, then she might be able to direct our\nefforts in such a manner as to render them effective.\n\n\"We can spare two weeks for this,\" said Mr. Edison. \"Can you fellows of\nmany tongues learn to talk with the girl in that time?\"\n\n\"We'll try it,\" said several.\n\n\"It shall we do,\" cried the Heidelberg professor more confidently.\n\n\"Then there is no use of staying here,\" continued the commander. \"If we\nwithdraw the Martians will think that we have either given up the contest\nor been destroyed. Perhaps they will then pull off their blanket and\nlet us see their face once more. That will give us a better opportunity\nto strike effectively when we are again ready.\"\n\n\nPreparing a Rendezvous.\n\n\"Why not rendezvous at one of the moons?\" said an astronomer. \"Neither\nof the two moons is of much consequence, as far as size goes, but still\nit would serve as a sort of anchorage ground, and while there, if we were\ncareful to keep on the side away from Mars, we should escape detection.\"\n\nThis suggestion was immediately accepted, and the squadron having been\nsignalled to assemble quickly bore off in the direction of the more\ndistant moon of Mars, Deimos. We knew that it was slightly smaller than\nPhobos but its greater distance gave promise that it would better serve\nour purpose of temporary concealment. The moons of Mars, like the earth's\nmoon, always keep the same face toward their master. By hiding behind\nDeimos we should escape the prying eyes of the Martians, even when they\nemployed telescopes, and thus be able to remain comparatively close at\nhand, ready to pounce down upon them again after we had obtained, as we\nnow had good hope of doing, information that would make us masters of\nthe situation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII.\n\n\nOn One of Mars' Moons.\n\nDeimos proved to be, as we had expected, about six miles in diameter. Its\nmean density is not very great so that the acceleration of gravity did\nnot exceed one two-thousandths of the earth's. Consequently the weight\nof a man turning the scales at 150 pounds at home was here only about\none ounce.\n\nThe result was that we could move about with greater ease than on the\ngolden asteroid, and some of the scientific men eagerly resumed their\ninterrupted experiments.\n\nBut the attraction of this little satellite was so slight that we had to\nbe very careful not to move too swiftly in going about lest we should\ninvoluntarily leave the ground and sail out into space, as, it will be\nremembered, happened to the fugitives during the fight on the asteroid.\n\nNot only would such an adventure have been an uncomfortable experience,\nbut it might have endangered the success of our scheme. Our present\ndistance from the surface of Mars did not exceed 12,500 miles, and we had\nreason to believe that Martians possessed telescopes powerful enough to\nenable them not merely to see the electrical ships at such a distance,\nbut to also catch sight of us individually. Although the cloud curtain\nstill rested on the planet it was probable that the Martians would send\nsome of their airships up to its surface in order to determine what\nour fate had been. From that point of vantage, with their exceedingly\npowerful glasses, we feared that they might be able to detect anything\nunusual upon or in the neighborhood of Deimos.\n\n\nThe Ships are Moored.\n\nAccordingly strict orders were given, not only that the ships should be\nmoored on that side of the satellite which is perpetually turned away\nfrom Mars, but that, without orders, no one should venture around on\nthe other side of the little globe, or even on the edge of it, where he\nmight be seen in profile against the sky.\n\nStill, of course, it was essential that we, on our part, should keep a\nclose watch, and so a number of sentinels were selected, whose duty it\nwas to place themselves at the edge of Deimos, where they could peep over\nthe horizon, so to speak, and catch sight of the globe of our enemies.\n\nThe distance of Mars from us was only about three times its own diameter,\nconsequently it shut off a large part of the sky, as viewed from our\nposition.\n\nBut in order to see its whole surface it was necessary to go a little\nbeyond the edge of the satellite, on that side which faced Mars. At the\nsuggestion of Colonel Smith, who had so frequently stalked Indians that\ndevices of this kind readily occurred to his mind, the sentinels all\nwore garments corresponding in color to that of the soil of the asteroid,\nwhich was of a dark, reddish brown hue. This would tend to conceal them\nfrom the prying eyes of the Martians.\n\nThe commander himself frequently went around the edge of the planet in\norder to take a look at Mars, and I often accompanied him.\n\n\nMarvellous Discoveries.\n\nThe Martians Were the Builders of the Great Sphinx and the\nPyramids.\n\nI shall never forget one occasion, when, lying flat on the ground,\nand cautiously worming our way around on the side toward Mars, we had\njust begun to observe it with our telescopes, when I perceived, against\nthe vast curtain of smoke, a small, glinting object, which I instantly\nsuspected to be an airship.\n\nI called Mr. Edison's attention to it, and we both agreed that it was,\nundoubtedly, one of the Martians' aerial vessels, probably on the lookout\nfor us.\n\nA short time afterward a large number of airships made their appearance\nat the upper surface of the clouds, moving to and fro, and although,\nwith our glasses, we could only make out the general form of the ships,\nwithout being able to discern the Martians upon them, yet we had not the\nleast doubt but they were sweeping the sky in every direction in order\nto determine whether we had been completely destroyed or had retreated\nto a distance from the planet.\n\nEven when that side of Mars on which we were looking had passed into\nnight, we could still see the guardships circling above the clouds,\ntheir presence being betrayed by the faint twinkling of the electric\nlights that they bore.\n\nFinally, after about a week had passed, the Martians evidently made up\ntheir minds that they had annihilated us, and that there was no longer\ndanger to be feared. Convincing evidence that they believed we should\nnot be heard from again was furnished when the withdrawal of the great\ncurtain of cloud began.\n\n\nA Great Phenomenon.\n\nThis phenomenon first manifested itself by a gradual thinning of the\nvaporous shield, until, at length, we began to perceive the red surface\nof the planet dimly shining through it. Thinner and rarer it became, and,\nafter the lapse of about eighteen hours, it had completely disappeared,\nand the huge globe shone out again, reflecting the light of the sun\nfrom its continents and oceans with a brightness that, in contrast with\nthe all-enveloping night to which we had so long been subjected, seemed\nunbearable to our eyes.\n\nIndeed, so brilliant was the illumination which fell upon the surface of\nDeimos that the number of persons who had been permitted to pass around\nupon the exposed side of the satellite was carefully restricted. In\nthe blaze of light which had been suddenly poured upon us we felt\nsomewhat like malefactors unexpectedly enveloped in the illumination of\na policeman's dark lantern.\n\nMeanwhile, the object which we had in view in retreating to the satellite\nwas not lost sight of, and the services of the chief linguists of the\nexpedition were again called into use for the purpose of acquiring a\nnew language. The experiment was conducted in the flagship. The fact\nthat this time it was not a monster belonging to an utterly alien race\nupon whom we were to experiment, but a beautiful daughter of our common\nMother Eve, added zest and interest as well as the most confident hopes\nof success to the efforts of those who were striving to understand the\naccents of her tongue.\n\n\nLingual Difficulties Ahead.\n\nStill the difficulty was very great, notwithstanding the conviction\nof the professors that her language would turn out to be a form of the\ngreat Indo-European speech from which the many tongues of civilized men\nupon the earth had been derived.\n\nThe learned men, to tell the truth, gave the poor girl no rest. For hours\nat a time they would ply her with interrogations by voice and by gesture,\nuntil, at length, wearied beyond endurance, she would fall asleep before\ntheir faces.\n\nThen she would be left undisturbed for a little while, but the moment her\neyes opened again the merciless professors flocked about her once more,\nand resumed the tedious iteration of their experiments.\n\nOur Heidelberg professor was the chief inquisitor, and he revealed\nhimself to us in a new and entirely unexpected light. No one could have\nanticipated the depth and variety of his resources. He placed himself\nin front of the girl and gestured and gesticulated, bowed, nodded,\nshrugged his shoulders, screwed his face into an infinite variety of\nexpressions, smiled, laughed, scowled and accompanied all these dumb\nshows with posturings, exclamations, queries, only half expressed in\nwords, and cadences which, by some ingenious manipulation of the tones\nof the voice, he managed to make as marvellous expressive of his desires.\n\nHe was a universal actor--comedian, tragedian, buffoon--all in one. There\nwas no shade of human emotion which he did not seem capable of giving\nexpression to.\n\n\nThe Professor Does His Best.\n\nHis every attitude was a symbol, and all his features became in quick\nsuccession types of thought and exponents of hidden feelings, while his\ninquisitive nose stood forth in the midst of their ceaseless play like\na perpetual interrogation point that would have electrified the Sphinx\ninto life, and set its stone lips gabbling answers and explanations.\n\nThe girl looked on, partly astonished, partly amused, and partly\ncomprehending. Sometimes she smiled, and then the beauty of her face\nbecame most captivating. Occasionally she burst into a cheery laugh\nwhen the professor was executing some of his extraordinary gyrations\nbefore her.\n\nIt was a marvellous exhibition of what the human intellect, when all its\npowers are concentrated upon a single object, is capable of achieving. It\nseemed to me, as I looked at the performance, that if all the races of\nmen, who had been stricken asunder at the foot of the Tower of Babel by\nthe miracle which made the tongues of each to speak a language unknown\nto the others, could be brought together again at the foot of the same\ntower, with all the advantages which thousands of years of education\nhad in the meantime imparted to them, they would be able, without any\nmiracle, to make themselves mutually understood.\n\nAnd it was evident that an understanding was actually growing between\nthe girl and the professor. Their minds were plainly meeting, and when\nboth had become focused upon the same point, it was perfectly certain\nthat the object of the experiment would be attained.\n\nWhenever the professor got from the girl an intelligent reply to his\npantomimic inquiries, or whenever he believed that he got such a reply,\nit was immediately jotted down in the ever open notebook which he\ncarried in his hand.\n\nAnd then he would turn to us standing by, and with one hand on his heart,\nand the other sweeping grandly through the air, would make a profound\nbow and say:\n\n\"The young lady and I great progress make already. I have her words\ncomprehended. We shall wondrous mysteries solve. Jawohl! Wunderlich!\nMake yourselves gentlemen easy. Of the human race the ancestral stem\nhave I here discovered.\"\n\nOnce I glanced over a page of his notebook, and there I read this:\n\n\"Mars--Zahmor.\"\n\n\"Copper--Hayez.\"\n\n\"Sword--Anz.\"\n\n\"I jump--Altesna.\"\n\n\"I slay--Amoutha.\"\n\n\"I cut off a head--Ksutaskofa.\"\n\n\"I sleep--Zlcha.\"\n\n\"I love--Levza.\"\n\n\nAha, Professor Heidelberg!\n\nWhen I saw this last entry I looked suspiciously at the professor.\n\nWas he trying to make love without our knowing it to the beautiful\ncaptive from Mars?\n\nIf so, I felt certain that he would get himself into difficulty. She\nhad made a deep impression upon every man in the flagship, and I knew\nthat there was more than one of the younger men who would have promptly\ncalled him to account if they had suspected him of trying to learn from\nthose beautiful lips the words, \"I love.\"\n\nI pictured to myself the state of mind of Colonel Alonzo Jefferson\nSmith if, in my place, he had glanced over the notebook and read what\nI had read.\n\nAnd then I thought of another handsome young fellow in the\nflagship--Sidney Phillips--who, if mere actions and looks could make\nhim so, had become exceedingly devoted to this long lost and happily\nrecovered daughter of Eve.\n\nIn fact, I had already questioned within my own mind whether the peace\nwould be strictly kept between Colonel Smith and Mr. Phillips, for the\nformer had, to my knowledge, noticed the young fellow's adoring glances,\nand had begun to regard him out of the corners of his eyes as if he\nconsidered him no better than an Apache or a Mexican greaser.\n\n\nJealousy Crops Out.\n\n\"But what,\" I asked myself, \"would be the vengeance that Colonel Smith\nwould take upon this skinny professor from Heidelberg if he thought that\nhe, taking advantage of his linguistic powers, had stepped in between\nhim and the damsel whom he had rescued?\"\n\nHowever, when I took a second look at the professor, I became convinced\nthat he was innocent of any such amorous intention, and that he had\nlearned, or believed he had learned, the word for \"love\" simply in\npursuance of the method by which he meant to acquire the language of\nthe girl.\n\nThere was one thing which gave some of us considerable misgiving, and\nthat was the question whether, after all, the language the professor was\nacquiring was really the girl's own tongue or one that she had learned\nfrom the Martians.\n\nBut the professor bade us rest easy on that point. He assured us, in the\nfirst place, that this girl could not be the only human being living upon\nMars, but that she must have friends and relatives there. That being so,\nthey unquestionably had a language of their own, which they spoke when\nthey were among themselves. Here finding herself among beings belonging\nto her own race, she would naturally speak her own tongue and not that\nwhich she had acquired from the Martians.\n\n\"Moreover, gentlemen,\" he added, \"I have in her speech many roots of\nthe great Aryan tongue already recognized.\"\n\nWe were greatly relieved by this explanation, which seemed to all of us\nperfectly satisfactory.\n\nYet, really, there was no reason why one language should be any better\nthan the other for our present purpose. In fact, it might be more useful\nto us to know the language of the Martians themselves. Still, we all\nfelt that we should prefer to know her language rather than that of the\nmonsters among whom she had lived.\n\nColonel Smith expressed what was in all our minds when, after listening\nto the reasoning of the Professor, he blurted out:\n\n\"Thank God, she doesn't speak any of their blamed lingo! By Jove, it\nwould soil her pretty lips.\"\n\n\"But also that she speaks, too,\" said the man from Heidelberg, turning\nto Colonel Smith with a grin. \"We shall both of them eventually learn.\"\n\n\nA Tedious Language Lesson.\n\nThree entire weeks were passed in this manner. After the first week\nthe girl herself materially assisted the linguists in their efforts to\nacquire her speech.\n\nAt length the task was so far advanced that we could, in a certain sense,\nregard it as practically completed. The Heidelberg Professor declared\nthat he had mastered the tongue of the ancient Aryans. His delight was\nunbounded. With prodigious industry he set to work, scarcely stopping\nto eat or sleep, to form a grammar of the language.\n\n\"You shall see,\" he said, \"it will the speculations of my countrymen\nvindicate.\"\n\nNo doubt the Professor had an exaggerated opinion of the extent of his\nacquirements, but the fact remained that enough had been learned of\nthe girl's language to enable him and several others to converse with\nher quite as readily as a person of good capacity who has studied under\nthe instructions of a native teacher during a period of six months can\nconverse in a foreign tongue.\n\nImmediately almost every man in the squadron set vigorously at work to\nlearn the language of this fair creature for himself. Colonel Smith and\nSidney Phillips were neck and neck in the linguistic race.\n\nOne of the first bits of information which the Professor had given out\nwas the name of the girl.\n\n\nWe Learn Her Name.\n\nIt was Aina (pronounced Ah-ee-na).\n\nThis news was flashed throughout the squadron, and the name of our\nbeautiful captive was on the lips of all.\n\nAfter that came her story. It was a marvellous narrative. Translated\ninto our tongue it ran as follows:\n\n\"The traditions of my fathers, handed down for generations so many that\nno one can number them, declare that the planet of Mars was not the\nplace of our origin.\"\n\n\"Ages and ages ago our forefathers dwelt on another and distant world\nthat was nearer to the sun than this one is, and enjoyed brighter daylight\nthan we have here.\"\n\n\"They dwelt--as I have often heard the story from my father, who had\nlearned it by heart from his father, and he from his--in a beautiful\nvalley that was surrounded by enormous mountains towering into the clouds\nand white about their tops with snow that never melted. In the valley\nwere lakes, around which clustered the dwellings of our race.\"\n\n\"It was, the traditions say, a land wonderful for its fertility, filled\nwith all things that the heart could desire, splendid with flowers and\nrich with luscious fruits.\"\n\n\"It was a land of music, and the people who dwelt in it were very happy.\"\n\nWhile the girl was telling this part of her story the Heidelberg Professor\nbecame visibly more and more excited. Presently he could keep quiet no\nlonger, and suddenly exclaimed, turning to us who were listening, as the\nwords of the girl were interpreted for us by one of the other linguists:\n\n\"Gentlemen, it is the Vale of Cashmere! Has not my great countryman,\nAdelung, so declared? Has he not said that the Valley of Cashmere was\nthe cradle of the human race already?\"\n\n\"From the Valley of Cashmere to the planet Mars--what a\nromance!\" exclaimed one of the bystanders.\n\nColonel Smith appeared to be particularly moved, and I heard him humming\nunder his breath, greatly to my astonishment, for this rough soldier\nwas not much given to poetry or music:\n\n\"Who has not heard of the Vale of Cashmere,\n  With its roses the brightest that earth ever gave;\nIts temples, its grottoes, its fountains as clear,\n  As the love-lighted eyes that hang over the wave.\"\n\nMr. Sidney Phillips, standing by, and also catching the murmur of Colonel\nSmith's words, showed in his handsome countenance some indications of\ndistress, as if he wished he had thought of those lines himself.\n\n\nAina Tells Her Story.\n\nThe girl resumed her narrative:\n\n\"Suddenly there dropped down out of the sky strange gigantic enemies,\narmed with mysterious weapons, and began to slay and burn and make\ndesolate. Our forefathers could not withstand them. They seemed like\ndemons, who had been sent from the abodes of evil to destroy our race.\"\n\n\"Some of the wise men said that this thing had come upon our people\nbecause they had been very wicked, and the gods in Heaven were angry. Some\nsaid they came from the moon, and some from the far-away stars. But of\nthese things my forefathers knew nothing for a certainty.\"\n\n\"The destroyers showed no mercy to the inhabitants of the beautiful\nvalley. Not content with making it a desert, they swept over other parts\nof the earth.\"\n\n\"The tradition says that they carried off from the valley, which was\nour native land, a large number of our people, taking them first into\na strange country, where there were oceans of sand, but where a great\nriver, flowing through the midst of the sands, created a narrow land of\nfertility. Here, after having slain and driven out the native inhabitants,\nthey remained for many years, keeping our people, whom they had carried\ninto captivity, as slaves.\"\n\n\"And in this Land of Sand, it is said, they did many wonderful works.\"\n\n\"They had been astonished at the sight of the great mountains which\nsurrounded our valley, for on Mars there are no mountains, and after\nthey came into the Land of Sand they built there with huge blocks of\nstone mountains in imitation of what they had seen, and used them for\npurposes that our people did not understand.\"\n\n\"Then, too, it is said they left there at the foot of these mountains\nthat they had made a gigantic image of the great chief who led them in\ntheir conquest of our world.\"\n\nAt this point in the story the Heidelberg Professor again broke in,\nfairly trembling with excitement:\n\n\nThe Wonders of the Martians!\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" he cried, \"is it that you do not understand? This\nLand of Sand and of a wonderful fertilizing river--what can it\nbe? Gentlemen, it is Egypt! These mountains of rock that the Martians\nhave erected, what are they? Gentlemen, they are the great mystery of the\nland of the Nile, the Pyramids. The gigantic statue of their leader that\nthey at the foot of their artificial mountains have set up--gentlemen,\nwhat is that? It is the Sphinx!\"\n\nThe Professor's agitation was so great that he could go no further. And\nindeed there was not one of us who did not fully share his excitement. To\nthink that we should have come to the planet Mars to solve one of the\nstanding mysteries of the earth, which had puzzled mankind and defied\nall their efforts at solution for so many centuries! Here, then, was\nthe explanation of how those gigantic blocks that constitute the great\nPyramid of Cheops had been swung to their lofty elevation. It was not the\nwork of puny man, as many an engineer had declared that it could not be,\nbut the work of these giants of Mars.\n\n\nAina's Wonderful Story.\n\nThe Martians' Beautiful Prisoner Recounts Her Marvellous\nAdventures.\n\nAina resumed her story.\n\n\"At length, our traditions say, a great pestilence broke out in the Land\nof Sand, and a partial vengeance was granted to us in the destruction\nof the larger number of our enemies. At last the giants who remained,\nfleeing before this scourge of the gods, used the mysterious means at\ntheir command, and, carrying our ancestors with them, returned to their\nown world, in which we have ever since lived.\"\n\n\"Then there are more of your people in Mars?\" said one of the professors.\n\n\"Alas, no,\" replied Aina, her eyes filling with tears, \"I alone am left.\"\n\nFor a few minutes she was unable to speak. Then she continued:\n\n\nAn Ancient Martian Conquest.\n\n\"What fury possessed them I do not know, but not long ago an expedition\ndeparted from the planet, the purpose of which, as it was noised about\nover Mars, was the conquest of a distant world. After a time a few\nsurvivors of that expedition returned. The story they told caused great\nexcitement among our masters. They had been successful in their battles\nwith the inhabitants of the world they had invaded, but as in the days\nof our forefathers, in the Land of Sand, a pestilence smote them, and\nbut few survivors escaped.\"\n\n\"Not long after that, you, with your mysterious ships, appeared in the\nsky of Mars. Our masters studied you with their telescopes, and those\nwho had returned from the unfortunate expedition declared that you\nwere inhabitants of the world which they had invaded, come, doubtless,\nto take vengeance upon them.\"\n\n\"Some of my people who were permitted to look through the telescopes of\nthe Martians, saw you also, and recognized you as members of their own\nrace. There were several thousand of us, altogether, and we were kept by\nthe Martians to serve them as slaves, and particularly to delight their\nears with music, for our people have always been especially skilful in\nthe playing of musical instruments, and in songs, and while the Martians\nhave but little musical skill themselves, they are exceedingly fond of\nthese things.\"\n\n\nAwaiting a Rescue.\n\n\"Although Mars had completed not less than five thousand circuits about\nthe sun since our ancestors were brought as prisoners to its surface, yet\nthe memory of our distant home had never perished from the hearts of our\nrace, and when we recognized you, as we believed, our own brothers, come\nto rescue us from long imprisonment, there was great rejoicing. The news\nspread from mouth to mouth, wherever we were in the houses and families\nof our masters. We seemed to be powerless to aid you or to communicate\nwith you in any manner. Yet our hearts went out to you, as in your ships\nyou hung above the planet, and preparations were secretly made by all the\nmembers of our race for your reception when, as we believed, would occur,\nyou should effect a landing upon the planet and destroy our enemies.\"\n\n\"But in some manner the fact that we had recognized you, and were\npreparing to welcome you, came to the ears of the Martians.\"\n\nAt this point the girl suddenly covered her eyes with her hands,\nshuddering and falling back in her seat.\n\n\"Oh, you do not know them as I do!\" at length she exclaimed. \"The\nmonsters! Their vengeance was too terrible! Instantly the order went forth\nthat we should all be butchered, and that awful command was executed!\"\n\n\"How, then, did you escape?\" asked the Heidelberg Professor.\n\nAina seemed unable to speak for a while. Finally mastering her emotion,\nshe replied:\n\n\nHer Fortunate Escape.\n\n\"One of the chief officers of the Martians wished me to remain alive. He,\nwith his aides, carried me to one of the military depot of supplies,\nwhere I was found and rescued,\" and as she said this she turned toward\nColonel Smith with a smile that reflected on his ruddy face and made it\nglow like a Chinese lantern.\n\n\"By ----!\" muttered Colonel Smith, \"that was the fellow we blew into\nnothing! Blast him, he got off too easy!\"\n\nThe remainder of Aina's story may be briefly told.\n\nWhen Colonel Smith and I entered the mysterious building which, as it\nnow proved, was not a storehouse belonging to a village, as we had\nsupposed, but one of the military depots of the Martians, the girl,\non catching sight of us, immediately recognized us as belonging to the\nstrange squadron in the sky. As such she felt that we must be her friends,\nand saw in us her only possible hope of escape. For that reason she had\ninstantly thrown herself under our protection. This accounted for the\nsingular confidence which she had manifested in us from the beginning.\n\nHer wonderful story had so captivated our imaginations that for a long\ntime after it was finished we could not recover from the spell. It was\ntold over and over again from mouth to mouth, and repeated from ship to\nship, everywhere exciting the utmost astonishment.\n\nDestiny seemed to have sent us on this expedition into space for the\npurpose of clearing off mysteries that had long puzzled the minds\nof men. When on the moon we had unexpectedly to ourselves settled the\nquestion that had been debated from the beginning of astronomical history\nof the former habitability of that globe.\n\n\nA Question Settled.\n\nNow, on Mars, we had put to rest no less mysterious questions relating to\nthe past history of our own planet. Adelung, as the Heidelberg Professor\nasserted, had named the Vale of Cashmere as the probable site of the\nGarden of Eden, and the place of origin of the human race, but later\ninvestigators had taken issue with this opinion, and the question where\nthe Aryans originated upon the earth had long been one of the most\npuzzling that science presented.\n\nThis question seemed now to have been settled.\n\nAina had said that Mars had completed 5,000 circuits about the sun since\nher people were brought to it as captives. One circuit of Mars occupies\n687 days. More than 9,000 years had therefore elapsed since the first\ninvasion of the earth by the Martians.\n\nAnother great mystery--that of the origin of those gigantic and\ninexplicable monuments, the great pyramids and the Sphinx, on the banks of\nthe Nile, had also apparently been solved by us, although these Egyptian\nwonders had been the furthest things from our thoughts when we set out\nfor the planet Mars.\n\nWe had travelled more than thirty millions of miles in order to get\nanswers to questions which could not be solved at home.\n\nBut from these speculations and retrospects we were recalled by the\ncommander of the expedition.\n\n\nDoes Aina Hold the Secret?\n\n\"This is all very interesting and very romantic, gentlemen,\" he said,\n\"but now let us get at the practical side of it. We have learned Aina's\nlanguage and have heard her story. Let us next ascertain whether\nshe cannot place in our hands some key which will place Mars at our\nmercy. Remember what we came here for, and remember that the earth\nexpects every man of us to do his duty.\"\n\nThis Nelson-like summons again changed the current of our thoughts,\nand we instantly set to work to learn from Aina if Mars, like Achilles,\nhad not some vulnerable point where a blow would be mortal.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV.\n\n\nIt was a curious scene when the momentous interview which was to\ndetermine our fate and that of Mars began. Aina had been warned of what\nwas coming. We in the flagship had all learned to speak her language with\nmore or less ease, but it was deemed best that the Heidelberg Professor,\nassisted by one of his colleagues, should act as interpreter.\n\nThe girl, flushed with excitement of the novel situation, fully\nappreciating the importance of what was about to occur, and looking\nmore charming than before, stood at one side of the principal\napartment. Directly facing her were the interpreters, and the rest of\nus, all with ears intent and eyes focused upon Aina, stood in a double\nrow behind them.\n\nAs heretofore, I am setting down her words translated into our own tongue,\nhaving taken only so much liberty as to connect the sentences into a\nstricter sequence than they had when falling from her lips in reply to\nthe questions that were showered upon her.\n\n\nShe Has a Plan.\n\n\"You will never be victorious,\" she said, \"if you attack them openly as\nyou have been doing. They are too strong and too numerous. They are well\nprepared for such attacks, because they have had to resist them before.\"\n\n\"They have waged war with the inhabitants of the asteroid Ceres, whose\npeople are giants greater than themselves. Their enemies from Ceres have\nattacked them here. Hence these fortifications, with weapons pointing\nskyward, and the great air fleets which you have encountered.\"\n\n\"But there must be some point,\" said Mr. Edison, \"where we can.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" interrupted the girl quickly, \"there is one blow you can\ndeal them which they could not withstand.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" eagerly inquired the commander.\n\n\"You can drown them out.\"\n\n\"How? With the canals?\"\n\n\nWe Must Drown Them Out.\n\n\"Yes, I will explain to you. I have already told you, and, in fact,\nyou must have seen it for yourselves, that there are almost no mountains\non Mars. A very learned man of my race used to say that the reason was\nbecause Mars is so very old a world that the mountains it once had have\nbeen almost completely levelled, and the entire surface of the planet had\nbecome a great plain. There are depressions, however, most of which are\noccupied by the seas. The greater part of the land lies below the level\nof the oceans. In order at the same time to irrigate the soil and make it\nfruitful, and to protect themselves from overflows by the ocean breaking\nin upon them, the Martians have constructed the immense and innumerable\ncanals which you see running in all directions over the continents.\"\n\n\"There is one period in the year, and that period has now arrived, when\nthere is special danger of a great deluge. Most of the oceans of Mars\nlie in the southern hemisphere. When it is Summer in that hemisphere,\nthe great masses of ice and snow collected around the south pole melt\nrapidly away.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is so,\" broke in one of our astronomers, who was listening\nattentively. \"Many a time I have seen the vast snow fields around the\nsouthern pole of Mars completely disappear as the Summer sun rose high\nupon them.\"\n\n\"With the melting of these snows,\" continued Aina, \"a rapid rise in the\nlevel of the water in the southern oceans occurs. On the side facing\nthese oceans the continents of Mars are sufficiently elevated to prevent\nan overflow, but nearer the equator the level of the land sinks lower.\"\n\n\"With your telescopes you have no doubt noticed that there is a great\nbending sea connecting the oceans of the south with those of the north\nand running through the midst of the continents.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said the astronomer who had spoken before, \"we call it the\nSyrtis Major.\"\n\n\"That long narrow sea,\" Aina went on, \"forms a great channel through\nwhich the flood of waters caused by the melting of the southern polar\nsnows flows swiftly toward the equator and then on toward the north until\nit reaches the sea basins which exist there. At that point it is rapidly\nturned into ice and snow, because, of course, while it is Summer in the\nsouthern hemisphere it is Winter in the northern.\"\n\n\nMars Will Be Ours.\n\n\"The Syrtis Major (I am giving our name to the channel of communication in\nplace of that by which the girl called it) is like a great safety valve,\nwhich, by permitting the waters to flow northward, saves the continents\nfrom inundation.\"\n\n\"But when mid-Summer arrives, the snows around the pole having been\ncompletely melted away, the flood ceases and the water begins to\nrecede. At this time, but for a device which the Martians have employed,\nthe canals connected with the oceans would run dry, and the vegetation,\nleft without moisture under the Summer sun, would quickly perish.\"\n\n\"To prevent this they have built a series of enormous gates extending\ncompletely across the Syrtis Major at its narrowest point (latitude 25\ndegrees south). These gates are all controlled by machinery collected\nat a single point on the shore of the strait. As soon as the flood in\nthe Syrtis Major begins to recede, the gates are closed, and, the water\nbeing thus restrained, the irrigating canals are kept full long enough\nto mature the harvests.\"\n\n\"The clew! The clew at last!\" exclaimed Mr. Edison. \"That is the place\nwhere we shall nip them. If we can close those gates now at the moment\nof high tide we shall flood the country. Did you say,\" he continued,\nturning to Aina, \"that the movement of the gates was all controlled from\na single point?\"\n\n\nThe Great Power House.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl. \"There is a great building (power house) full of\ntremendous machinery which I once entered when my father was taken there\nby his master, and where I saw one Martian, by turning a little handle,\ncause the great line of gates, stretching a hundred miles across the sea,\nto slowly shut in, edge to edge, until the flow of the water toward the\nnorth had been stopped.\"\n\n\"How is the building protected?\"\n\n\"So completely,\" replied Aina, \"that my only fear is that you may not be\nable to reach it. On account of the danger from their enemies on Ceres,\nthe Martians have fortified it strongly on all sides, and have even\nsurrounded it and covered it overhead with a great electrical network,\nto touch which would be instant death.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Edison, \"they have got an electric shield, have they? Well,\nI think we shall be able to manage that.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he continued, \"we have got to get into that power house, and we\nhave got to close those gates, and we must not lose much time in making\nup our minds how it is to be done. Evidently this is our only chance. We\nhave not force enough to contend in open battle with the Martians, but\nif we can flood them out, and thereby render the engines contained in\ntheir fortifications useless, perhaps we shall be able to deal with the\nairships, which will be all the means of defence that will then remain\nto them.\"\n\nThis idea commended itself to all the leaders of the expedition. It was\ndetermined to make a reconnaissance at once.\n\nBut it would not do for us to approach the planet too hastily, and we\ncertainly could not think of landing upon it in broad daylight. Still,\nas long as we were yet at a considerable distance from Mars, we felt that\nwe should be safe from observation, because so much time had elapsed\nwhile we were hidden behind Deimos that the Martians had undoubtedly\nconcluded that we were no longer in existence.\n\nSo we boldly quitted the little satellite with our entire squadron and\nonce more rapidly approached the red planet of war. This time it was\nto be a death grapple and our chances of victory still seemed good.\n\n\nReady for a Death Grapple.\n\nAs soon as we arrived so near the planet that there was danger of our\nbeing actually seen, we took pains to keep continually in the shadow\nof Mars, and the more surely to conceal our presence all lights upon\nthe ships were extinguished. The precaution of the commander even went\nso far as to have the smooth metallic sides of the cars blackened over\nso that they should not reflect light, and thus become visible to the\nMartians as shining specks, moving suspiciously among the stars.\n\nThe precise location of the great power house on the shores of the Syrtis\nMajor having been carefully ascertained, the squadron dropped down one\nnight into the upper limits of the Martian atmosphere, directly over\nthe gulf.\n\nThen a consultation was called on the flagship and a plan of campaign\nwas quickly devised.\n\nIt was deemed wise that the attempt should be made with a single\nelectrical ship, but that the others should be kept hovering near, ready\nto respond on the instant to any signal for aid which might come from\nbelow. It was thought that, notwithstanding the wonderful defences,\nwhich, according to Aina's account surrounded the building, a small\nparty would have a better chance of success than a large one.\n\nMr. Edison was certain that the electrical network which was described\nas covering the power house would not prove a serious obstruction to\nus, because by carefully sweeping the space where we intended to pass\nwith the disintegrators before quitting the ship, the netting could be\nsufficiently cleared away to give us uninterrupted passage.\n\nAt first the intention was to have twenty men, each armed with two\ndisintegrators (that being the largest number that one person could carry\nto advantage) descend from the electrical ship and make the venture. But,\nafter further discussion, this number was reduced; first to a dozen,\nand finally, to only four. These four consisted of Mr. Edison, Colonel\nSmith, Mr. Sidney Phillips and myself.\n\nBoth by her own request and because we could not help feeling that her\nknowledge of the locality would be indispensable to us, Aina was also\nincluded in our party, but not, of course, as a fighting member of it.\n\nIt was about an hour after midnight when the ship in which we were to\nmake the venture parted from the remainder of the squadron and dropped\ncautiously down. The blaze of electric lights running away in various\ndirections indicated the lines of innumerable canals with habitations\ncrowded along their banks, which came to a focus at a point on the\ncontinent of Aeria, westward from the Syrtis Major.\n\n\nDestroying The Martians.\n\nWith Aina's Aid Our Warriors Prepare an Awful Revenge on the Enemy.\n\nWe stopped the electrical ship at an elevation of perhaps three hundred\nfeet above the vast roof of a structure which Aina assured us was the\nbuilding we were in search of.\n\nHere we remained for a few minutes, cautiously reconnoitring. On that\nside of the power house which was opposite to the shore of the Syrtis\nMajor there was a thick grove of trees, lighted beneath, as was apparent\nfrom the illumination which here and there streamed up through the cover\nof leaves, but, nevertheless, dark and gloomy above the tree tops.\n\n\"The electric network extends over the grove as well as over the\nbuilding,\" said Aina.\n\nThis was lucky for us, because we wished to descend among the trees,\nand, by destroying part of the network over the tree tops, we could\nreach the shelter we desired and at the same time pass within the line\nof electric defences.\n\nWith increased caution, and almost holding our breath lest we should\nmake some noise that might reach the ears of the sentinels beneath, we\ncaused the car to settle gently down until we caught sight of a metallic\nnet stretched in the air between us and the trees.\n\nAfter our first encounter with the Martians on the asteroid, where, as\nI have related, some metal which was included in their dress resisted\nthe action of the disintegrators, Mr. Edison had readjusted the range\nof vibrations covered by the instruments, and since then we had found\nnothing that did not yield to them. Consequently, we had no fear that\nthe metal of the network would not be destroyed.\n\nThere was danger, however, of arousing attention by shattering\nholes through the tree tops. This could be avoided by first carefully\nascertaining how far away the network was, and then with the adjustable\nmirrors attached to the disintegrators focusing the vibratory discharge\nat that distance.\n\n\nOvercoming Their Precautions.\n\nSo successful were we that we opened a considerable gap in the network\nwithout doing any perceptible damage to the trees beneath.\n\nThe ship was cautiously lowered through the opening and brought to rest\namong the upper branches of one of the tallest trees. Colonel Smith,\nMr. Phillips, Mr. Edison and myself at once clambered out upon a strong\nlimb.\n\nFor a moment I feared our arrival had been betrayed on account of the\naltogether too noisy contest that arose between Colonel Smith and\nMr. Phillips as to which of them should assist Aina. To settle the\ndispute I took charge of her myself.\n\nAt length we were all safely in the tree.\n\nThen followed the still more dangerous undertaking of descending from\nthis great height to the ground. Fortunately, the branches were very\nclose together and they extended down within a short distance of the\nsoil. So the actual difficulties of the descent were not very great\nafter all. The one thing that we had particularly to bear in mind was\nthe absolute necessity of making no noise.\n\nAt length the descent was successfully accomplished, and we all five\nstood together in the shadow at the foot of the great tree. The grove\nwas so thick around that while there was an abundance of electric lights\namong the trees, their illumination did not fall upon us where we stood.\n\nPeering cautiously through the vistas in various directions, we\nascertained our location with respect to the wall of the building. Like\nall the structures that we had seen on Mars, it was composed of polished\nred metal.\n\n\nLooking for an Entrance.\n\n\"Where is the entrance?\" inquired Mr. Edison, in a whisper.\n\n\"Come softly this way, and look out for the sentinel,\" replied Aina.\n\nGripping our disintegrators firmly, and screwing up our courage, with\nnoiseless steps we followed the girl among the shadows of the trees.\n\nWe had one very great advantage. The Martians had evidently placed so\nmuch confidence in the electric network which surrounded the power house\nthat they never dreamed of enemies being able to penetrate it--at least,\nwithout giving warning of their coming.\n\nBut the hole which we had blown in this network with the disintegrators\nhad been made noiselessly, and Mr. Edison believed, since no enemies\nhad appeared, that our operations had not been betrayed by any automatic\nsignal to watchers inside the building.\n\nConsequently, we had every reason to think that we now stood within\nthe line of defence, in which they reposed the greatest confidence,\nwithout their having the least suspicion of our presence.\n\nAina assured us that on the occasion of her former visit to the power\nhouse there had been but two sentinels on guard at the entrance. At the\ninner end of a long passage leading to the interior, she said, there\nwere two more. Besides these there were three or four Martian engineers\nwatching the machinery in the interior of the building. A number of air\nships were supposed to be on guard around the structure, but possibly\ntheir vigilance had been relaxed, because not long ago the Martians had\nsent an expedition against Ceres which had been so successful that the\npower of that planet to make an attack upon Mars had for the present\nbeen destroyed.\n\nSupposing us to have been annihilated in the recent battle among the\nclouds, they would have no fear or cause for vigilance on our account.\n\nThe entrance to the great structure was low--at least, when measured by\nthe stature of the Martians. Evidently the intention was that only one\nperson at a time should find room to pass through it.\n\nDrawing cautiously near, we discerned the outlines of two gigantic forms,\nstanding in the darkness, one on either side of the door. Colonel Smith\nwhispered to me:\n\n\nThe Disintegrator Again.\n\n\"If you will take the fellow on the right, I will attend to the other\none.\"\n\nAdjusting our aim as carefully as was possible in the gloom, Colonel\nSmith and I simultaneously discharged our disintegrators, sweeping\nthem rapidly up and down in the manner which had become familiar to us\nwhen endeavoring to destroy one of the gigantic Martians with a single\nstroke. And so successful were we that the two sentinels disappeared as\nif they had been ghosts of the night.\n\nInstantly we all hurried forward and entered the door. Before us extended\na long, straight passage, brightly illuminated by a number of electric\ncandles. Its polished sides gleamed with blood-red reflections, and\nthe gallery terminated, at a distance of two or three hundred feet,\nwith an opening into a large chamber beyond, on the further side of\nwhich we could see part of a gigantic and complicated mass of machinery.\n\nMaking as little noise as possible, we pushed ahead along the passage,\nbut when we had arrived within a distance of a dozen paces from the\ninner end, we stopped, and Colonel Smith, getting down upon his knees,\ncrept forward until he had reached the inner end of the passage. There\nhe peered cautiously around the edge into the chamber, and, turning his\nhead a moment later, beckoned us to come forward. We crept to his side,\nand, looking out into the vast apartment, could perceive no enemies.\n\nWhat had become of the sentinels supposed to stand at the inner end of the\npassage we could not imagine. At any rate, they were not at their posts.\n\n\nIn the Great Power House.\n\nThe chamber was an immense square room at least a hundred feet in height\nand 400 feet on a side, and almost filling the wall opposite to us was\nan intricate display of machinery, wheels, levers, rods and polished\nplates. This we had no doubt was one end of the great engine which opened\nand shut the great gates that could dam an ocean.\n\n\"There is no one in sight,\" said Colonel Smith.\n\n\"Then we must act quickly,\" said Mr. Edison.\n\n\"Where,\" he said, turning to Aina, \"is the handle by turning which you\nsaw the Martian close the gates?\"\n\nAina looked about in bewilderment. The mechanism before us was so\ncomplicated that even an expert mechanician would have been excusable\nfor finding himself unable to understand it. There were scores of knobs\nand handles, all glistening in the electric light, any one of which,\nso far as the uninstructed could tell, might have been the master key\nthat controlled the whole complex apparatus.\n\n\nThe Magic Lever!\n\n\"Quick,\" said Mr. Edison, \"where is it?\"\n\nThe girl in her confusion ran this way and that, gazing hopelessly upon\nthe machinery, but evidently utterly unable to help us.\n\nTo remain here inactive was not merely to invite destruction for\nourselves, but was sure to bring certain failure upon the purpose of\nthe expedition. All of us began instantly to look about in search of\nthe proper handle, seizing every crank and wheel in sight and striving\nto turn it.\n\n\"Stop that!\" shouted Mr. Edison, \"you may set the whole thing wrong. Don't\ntouch anything until we have found the right lever.\"\n\nBut to find that seemed to most of us now utterly beyond the power of man.\n\nIt was at this critical moment that the wonderful depth and reach of\nMr. Edison's mechanical genius displayed itself. He stepped back, ran\nhis eye quickly over the whole immense mass of wheels, handles, bolts,\nbars and levers, paused for an instant, as if making up his mind, then\nsaid decidedly, \"There it is,\" and, stepping quickly forward, selected a\nsmall wheel amid a dozen others, all furnished at the circumference with\nhandles like those of a pilot's wheel, and, giving it a quick wrench,\nturned it half way around.\n\n\nSurprised by the Enemy.\n\nAt this instant, a startling shout fell upon our ears. There was\na thunderous clatter behind us, and, turning, we saw three gigantic\nMartians rushing forward.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV.\n\n\n\"Sweep them! Sweep them!\" cried Colonel Smith, as he brought his\ndisintegrator to bear. Mr. Phillips and I instantly followed his example,\nand thus we swept the Martians into eternity, while Mr. Edison coolly\ncontinued his manipulations of the wheel.\n\nThe effect of what he was doing became apparent in less than half a\nminute. A shiver ran through the mass of machinery and shook the entire\nbuilding.\n\n\"Look! look!\" cried Sidney Phillips, who had stepped a little apart from\nthe others.\n\n\nThe Grand Canal.\n\nWe all ran to his side and found ourselves in front of a great window\nwhich opened through the side of the engine, giving a view of what lay\nin front of it. There, gleaming in the electric lights, we saw the\nSyrtis Major, its waters washing high against the walls of the vast\npower house. Running directly out from the shore, there was an immense\nmetallic gate at least 400 yards in length and rising 300 feet above\nthe present level of the water.\n\nThis great gate was slowly swinging upon an invisible hinge in such a\nmanner that in a few minutes it would evidently stand across the current\nof the Syrtis Major at right angles.\n\nBeyond was a second gate, which was moving in the same manner. Further\non was a third gate, and then another, and another, as far as the eye\ncould reach, evidently extending in an unbroken series completely across\nthe great strait.\n\nAs the gates, with accelerated motion when the current caught them,\nclanged together, we beheld a spectacle that almost stopped the beating\nof our hearts.\n\n\nA Great Rush of Waters.\n\nThe great Syrtis seemed to gather itself for a moment, and then it leaped\nupon the obstruction and hurled its waters into one vast foaming geyser\nthat seemed to shoot a thousand feet skyward.\n\nBut the metal gates withstood the shock, though buried from our sight\nin the seething white mass, and the baffled waters instantly swirled\nround in ten thousand gigantic eddies, rising to the level of our window\nand beginning to inundate the power house before we fairly comprehended\nour peril.\n\n\"We have done the work,\" said Mr. Edison, smiling grimly. \"Now we had\nbetter get out of this before the flood bursts upon us.\"\n\nThe warning came none too soon. It was necessary to act upon it at once\nif we would save our lives. Even before we could reach the entrance to\nthe long passage through which we had come into the great engine room, the\nwater had risen half way to our knees. Colonel Smith, catching Aina under\nhis arm, led the way. The roar of the maddened torrent behind deafened us.\n\nAs we ran through the passage, the water followed us, with a wicked\nswishing sound, and within five seconds it was above our knees; in ten\nseconds up to our waists.\n\nThe great danger now was that we should be swept from our feet, and once\ndown in that torrent there would have been little chance of our ever\ngetting our heads above its level. Supporting ourselves as best we could\nwith the aid of the walls, we partly ran, and were partly swept along,\nuntil, when we reached the outer end of the passage and emerged into\nthe open air, the flood was swirling about our shoulders.\n\n\nEscaping the Water.\n\nHere there was an opportunity to clutch some of the ornamental work\nsurrounding the doorway, and thus we managed to stay our mad progress,\nand gradually to work out of the current until we found that the water,\nhaving now an abundance of room to spread, had fallen again as low as\nour knees.\n\nBut suddenly we heard the thunder of the banks tumbling behind us, and\nto the right and left, and the savage growl of the released water as it\nsprang through the breaches.\n\nTo my dying day, I think, I shall not forget the sight of a great fluid\ncolumn that burst through the dyke at the edge of the grove of trees, and,\nby the tremendous impetus of its rush, seemed turned into a solid thing.\n\nLike an enormous ram, it plowed the soil to a depth of twenty feet,\nuprooting acres of the immense trees like stubble turned over by the\nplowshare.\n\nThe uproar was so awful that for an instant the coolest of us lost our\nself-control. Yet we knew that we had not the fraction of a second to\nwaste. The breaking of the banks had caused the water again rapidly to\nrise about us. In a little while it was once more as high as our waists.\n\nIn the excitement and confusion, deafened by the noise and blinded by\nthe flying foam, we were in danger of becoming separated in the flood. We\nno longer knew certainly in what direction was the tree by whose aid we\nhad ascended from the electrical ship. We pushed first one way and then\nanother, staggering through the rushing waters in search of it. Finally\nwe succeeded in locating it, and with all our strength hurried toward it.\n\nThen there came a noise as if the globe of Mars had been split asunder,\nand another great head of water hurled itself down upon the soil before\nus, and, without taking time to spread, bored a vast cavity in the ground,\nand scooped out the whole of the grove before our eyes as easily as a\ngardener lifts a sod with his spade.\n\n\nAre We, Too, Destroyed?\n\nOur last hope was gone. For a moment the level of the water around us\nsank again, as it poured into the immense excavation where the grove had\nstood, but in an instant it was reinforced from all sides and began once\nmore rapidly to rise.\n\nWe gave ourselves up for lost, and, indeed, there did not seem any\npossible hope of salvation.\n\nEven in the extremity I saw Colonel Smith lifting the form of Aina, who\nhad fainted, above the surface of the surging water, while Sidney Phillips\nstood by his side and aided him in supporting the unconscious girl.\n\n\"We stayed a little too long,\" was the only sound I heard from Mr. Edison.\n\nThe huge bulk of the power house partially protected us against the force\nof the current, and the water spun around us in great eddies. These swept\nus this way and that, but yet we managed to cling together, determined\nnot to be separated in death if we could avoid it.\n\nSuddenly a cry rang out directly above our heads:\n\n\"Jump for your lives, and be quick!\"\n\nAt the same instant the ends of several ropes splashed into the water.\n\nWe glanced upward, and there, within three or four yards of our heads,\nhung the electrical ship, which we had left moored at the top of the tree.\n\nTom, the expert electrician from Mr. Edison's shop, who had remained in\ncharge of the ship, had never once dreamed of such a thing as deserting\nus. The moment he saw the water bursting over the dam, and evidently\nflooding the building which we had entered, he cast off his moorings,\nas we subsequently learned, and hovered over the entrance to the power\nhouse, getting as low down as possible and keeping a sharp watch for us.\n\nBut most of the electric lights in the vicinity had been carried down by\nthe first rush of water, and in the darkness he did not see us when we\nemerged from the entrance. It was only after the sweeping away of the\ngrove of trees had allowed a flood of light to stream upon the scene\nfrom a cluster of electric lamps on a distant portion of the bank on\nthe Syrtis that had not yet given way that he caught sight of us.\n\n\nMars Is Ruined!\n\nImmediately he began to shout to attract our attention, but in the awful\nuproar we could not hear him. Getting together all the ropes that he\ncould lay his hands on, he steered the ship to a point directly over us,\nand then dropped down within a few yards of the boiling flood.\n\nNow as he hung over our heads, and saw the water up to our very necks\nand still swiftly rising, he shouted again:\n\n\"Catch hold, for God's sake!\"\n\nThe three men who were with him in the ship seconded his cries.\n\nBut by the time we had fairly grasped the ropes, so rapidly was the flood\nrising, we were already afloat. With the assistance of Tom and his men we\nwere rapidly drawn up, and immediately Tom reversed the electric polarity,\nand the ship began to rise.\n\nAt that same instant, with a crash that shivered the air, the immense\nmetallic power house gave way and was swept tumbling, like a hill torn\nloose from its base, over the very spot where a moment before we had\nstood. One second's hesitation on the part of Tom, and the electrical\nship would have been battered into a shapeless wad of metal by the\ncareening mass.\n\n\nThe Deluge On Mars.\n\nHow the Martians Met Their Doom Through Aina's Plans.\n\nWhen we had attained a considerable height, so that we could see to a\ngreat distance on either side, the spectacle became even more fearful\nthan it was when we were close to the surface.\n\nOn all sides banks and dykes were going down; trees were being uprooted;\nbuildings were tumbling, and the ocean was achieving that victory over\nthe land which had long been its due, but which the ingenuity of the\ninhabitants of Mars had postponed for ages.\n\nFar away we could see the front of the advancing wave crested with foam\nthat sparkled in the electric lights, and as it swept on it changed the\nentire aspect of the planet--in front of it all life, behind it all death.\n\nEastward our view extended across the Syrtis Major toward the land of\nLibya and the region of Isidis. On that side also the dykes were giving\nway under the tremendous pressure, and the floods were rushing toward\nthe sunrise, which had just begun to streak the eastern sky.\n\nThe continents that were being overwhelmed on the western side of the\nSyrtis were Meroe, Aeria, Arabia, Edom and Eden.\n\nThe water beneath us continually deepened. The current from the melting\nsnows around the southern pole was at its strongest, and one could\nhardly have believed that any obstruction put in its path would have\nbeen able to arrest it and turn it into these two all-swallowing deluges,\nsweeping east and west. But, as we now perceived, the level of the land\nover a large part of its surface was hundreds of feet below the ocean,\nso that the latter, when once the barriers were broken, rushed into\ndepressions that yawned to receive it.\n\n\nWaiting for the Flood.\n\nThe point where we had dealt our blow was far removed from the great\ncapital of Mars, around the Lake of the Sun, and we knew that we should\nhave to wait for the floods to reach that point before the desired effect\ncould be produced. By the nearest way, the water had at least 5,000\nmiles to travel. We estimated that its speed where we hung above it was\nas much as a hundred miles an hour. Even if that speed were maintained,\nmore than two days and nights would be required for the floods to reach\nthe Lake of the Sun.\n\nBut as the water rushed on it would break the banks of all the canals\nintersecting the country, and these, being also elevated above the\nsurface, would add the impetus of their escaping waters to hasten the\nadvance of the flood. We calculated, therefore, that about two days\nwould suffice to place the planet at our mercy.\n\nHalf way from the Syrtis Major to the Lake of the Sun another great\nconnecting link between the Southern and Northern ocean basins, called\non our maps of Mars the Indus, existed, and through this channel we\nknew that another great current must be setting from the south toward\nthe north. The flood that we had started would reach and break the banks\nof the Indus within one day.\n\n\nFlooding Hundreds of Canals.\n\nThe flood travelling in the other direction, towards the east, would\nhave considerably further to go before reaching the neighborhood of\nthe Lake of the Sun. It, too, would involve hundreds of great canals\nas it advanced and would come plunging upon the Lake of the Sun and its\nsurrounding forts and cities, probably about half a day later than the\narrival of the deluge that travelled towards the west.\n\nNow that we had let the awful destroyer loose we almost shrank from the\nthought of the consequences which we had produced. How many millions\nwould perish as the result of our deed we could not even guess. Many\nof the victims, so far as we knew, might be entirely innocent of enmity\ntoward us, or of the evil which had been done to our native planet. But\nthis was a case in which the good--if they existed--must suffer with\nthe bad on account of the wicked deeds of the latter.\n\nI have already remarked that the continents of Mars were higher on their\nnorthern and southern borders where they faced the great oceans. These\nnatural barriers bore to the main mass of the land somewhat the relation\nof the edge of a shallow dish to its bottom. Their rise on the land\nside was too gradual to give them the appearance of hills, but on the\nside toward the sea they broke down in steep banks and cliffs several\nhundred feet in height. We guessed that it would be in the direction\nof these elevations that the inhabitants would flee, and those who had\ntimely warning might thus be able to escape in case the flood did not--as\nit seemed possible it might in its first mad rush--overtop the highest\nelevations on Mars.\n\n\nA Dreadful Scene.\n\nAs day broke and the sun slowly rose upon the dreadful scene beneath\nus, we began to catch sight of some of the fleeing inhabitants. We\nhad shifted the position of the fleet toward the south, and were now\nsuspended above the southeastern corner of Aeria. Here a high bank of\nreddish rock confronted the sea, whose waters ran lashing and roaring\nalong the bluffs to supply the rapid draught produced by the emptying\nof the Syrtis Major. Along the shore there was a narrow line of land,\nhundreds of miles in length, but less than a quarter of a mile broad,\nwhich still rose slightly above the surface of the water, and this land\nof refuge was absolutely packed with the monstrous inhabitants of the\nplanet who had fled hither on the first warning that the water was coming.\n\nIn some places it was so crowded that the later comers could not find\nstanding ground on dry land, but were continually slipping back and\nfalling into the water. It was an awful sight to look at them. It\nreminded me of pictures that I had seen of the deluge in the days of\nNoah, when the waters had risen to the mountain tops, and men, women\nand children were fighting for a foothold upon the last dry spots that\nthe earth contained.\n\nWe were all moved by a desire to help our enemies, for we were overwhelmed\nwith feelings of pity and remorse, but to aid them was now utterly\nbeyond our power. The mighty floods were out, and the end was in the\nhands of God.\n\nFortunately, we had little time for these thoughts, because no sooner\nhad the day begun to dawn around us than the airships of the Martians\nappeared. Evidently the people in them were dazed by the disaster and\nuncertain what to do. It is doubtful whether at first they comprehended\nthe fact that we were the agents who had produced the cataclysm.\n\n\nThe Flocking of the Airships.\n\nBut as the morning advanced the airships came flocking in greater and\ngreater numbers from every direction, many swooping down close to the\nflood in order to rescue those who were drowning. Hundreds gathered along\nthe slip of land which was crowded as I have described, with refugees,\nwhile other hundreds rapidly assembled about us, evidently preparing\nfor an attack.\n\nWe had learned in our previous contests with the airships of the Martians\nthat our electrical ships had a great advantage over them, not merely in\nrapidity and facility of movement, but in the fact that our disintegrators\ncould sweep in every direction, while it was only with much difficulty\nthat the Martian airships could discharge their electrical strokes at\nan enemy poised directly above their heads.\n\nAccordingly, orders were instantly flashed to all the squadron to rise\nvertically to an elevation so great that the rarity of the atmosphere\nwould prevent the airships from attaining the same level.\n\n\nOutwitting the Enemy.\n\nThis manoeuvre was executed so quickly that the Martians were unable\nto deal us a blow before we were poised above them in such a position\nthat they could not easily reach us. Still they did not mean to give up\nthe conflict.\n\nPresently we saw one of the largest of their ships manoeuvring in a very\npeculiar manner, the purpose of which we did not at first comprehend. Its\nforward portion commenced slowly to rise, until it pointed upward like\nthe nose of a fish approaching the surface of the water. The moment it\nwas in this position, an electrical bolt was darted from its prow, and\none of our ships received a shock which, although it did not prove fatal\nto the vessel itself, killed two or three men aboard it, disarranged\nits apparatus, and rendered it for the time being useless.\n\n\"Ah, that's their trick, is it?\" said Mr. Edison. \"We must look out for\nthat. Whenever you see one of the airships beginning to stick its nose\nup after that fashion blaze away at it.\"\n\nAn order to this effect was transmitted throughout the squadron. At the\nsame time several of the most powerful disintegrators were directed upon\nthe ship which had executed the stratagem and, reduced to a wreck, it\ndropped, whirling like a broken kite until it fell into the flood beneath.\n\n\nA Thousand Martian Ships.\n\nStill the Martians' ships came flocking in ever greater numbers from all\ndirections. They made desperate attempts to attain the level at which we\nhung above them. This was impossible, but many, getting an impetus by a\nswift run in the denser portion of the atmosphere beneath, succeeded in\nrising so high that they could discharge their electric artillery with\nconsiderable effect. Others, with more or less success, repeated the\nmanoeuvre of the ship which had first attacked us, and thus the battle\nbecame gradually more general and more fierce, until, in the course of an\nhour or two, our squadron found itself engaged with probably a thousand\nairships, which blazed with incessant lightning strokes, and were able,\nall too frequently, to do us serious damage.\n\nBut on our part the battle was waged with a cool determination and a\nconsciousness of insuperable advantage which boded ill for the enemy. Only\nthree or four of our sixty electrical ships were seriously damaged,\nwhile the work of the disintegrators upon the crowded fleet that floated\nbeneath us was terrible to look upon.\n\n\nThey Battle on in Earnest.\n\nOur strokes fell thick and fast on all sides. It was like firing into\na flock of birds that could not get away. Notwithstanding all their\nefforts they were practically at our mercy. Shattered into unrecognizable\nfragments, hundreds of the airships continually dropped from their great\nheight to be swallowed up in the boiling waters.\n\nYet they were game to the last. They made every effort to get at us, and\nin their frenzy they seemed to discharge their bolts without much regard\nto whether friends or foes were injured. Our eyes were nearly blinded\nby the ceaseless glare beneath us, and the uproar was indescribable.\n\nAt length, after this fearful contest had lasted for at least three\nhours, it became evident that the strength of the enemy was rapidly\nweakening. Nearly the whole of their immense fleet of airships had been\ndestroyed, or so far damaged that they were barely able to float. Just\nso long, however, as they showed signs of resistance we continued to\npour our merciless fire upon them, and the signal to cease was not given\nuntil the airships which had escaped serious damage began to flee in\nevery direction.\n\n\nVictory Is Ours!\n\n\"Thank God, the thing is over,\" said Mr. Edison. \"We have got the victory\nat last, but how we shall make use of it is something that at present\nI do not see.\"\n\n\"But will they not renew the attack,\" asked someone.\n\n\"I do not think they can,\" was the reply. \"We have destroyed the very\nflower of their fleet.\"\n\n\"And better than that,\" said Colonel Smith, \"we have destroyed their elan;\nwe have made them afraid. Their discipline is gone.\"\n\nBut this was only the beginning of our victory. The floods below were\nachieving a still greater triumph, and now that we had conquered the\nairships we dropped within a few hundred feet of the surface of the water\nand then turned our faces westward in order to follow the advance of the\ndeluge and see whether, as we had hoped, it would overwhelm our enemies\nin the very centre of their power.\n\n\nThe Flood Advances.\n\nIn a little while we had overtaken the front wave, which was still\ndevouring everything. We saw it bursting the banks of the canals, sweeping\naway forests of gigantic trees, and swallowing cities and villages,\nleaving nothing but a broad expanse of swirling and eddying waters,\nwhich, in consequence of the prevailing red hue of the vegetation and\nthe soil, looked, as shuddering we gazed down upon it, like an ocean\nof blood flecked with foam and steaming with the escaping life of the\nplanet from whose veins it gushed.\n\nAs we skirted the southern borders of the continent the same\ndreadful scenes which we had beheld on the coast of Aeria presented\nthemselves. Crowds of refugees thronged the high border of the land\nand struggled with one another for a foothold against the continually\nrising flood.\n\n\nWatching the Destruction.\n\nWe saw, too, flitting in every direction, but rapidly fleeing before our\napproach, many airships, evidently crowded with Martians, but not armed\neither for offence or defence. These, of course, we did not disturb, for\nmerciless as our proceedings seemed even to ourselves, we had no intention\nof making war upon the innocent, or upon those who had no means to resist.\nWhat we had done it had seemed to us necessary to do, but henceforth we\nwere resolved to take no more lives if it could be avoided.\n\nThus, during the remainder of that day, all of the following night and\nall of the next day, we continued upon the heels of the advancing flood.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI.\n\n\nThe second night we could perceive ahead of us the electric lights\ncovering the land of Thaumasia, in the midst of which lay the Lake of\nthe Sun. The flood would be upon it by daybreak, and, assuming that the\ndemoralization produced by the news of the coming of the waters, which\nwe were aware had hours before been flashed to the capital of Mars, would\nprevent the Martians from effectively manning their forts, we thought it\nsafe to hasten on with the flagship, and one or two others, in advance of\nthe water, and to hover over the Lake of the Sun in the darkness, in order\nthat we might watch the deluge perform its awful work in the morning.\n\n\nThe Giant Woman Drowned.\n\nShe, Like the Rest, a Prey to the Devouring Flood of the Canals.\n\nThaumasia, as I have before remarked, was a broad, oval land, about 1,800\nmiles across, having the Lake of the Sun exactly in its centre. From\nthis lake, which was four or five hundred miles in diameter, and circular\nin outline, many canals radiated, as straight as the spokes of a wheel,\nin every direction, and connected it with the surrounding seas.\n\nLike all the other Martian continents, Thaumasia lay below the level of\nthe sea, except toward the south, where it fronted the ocean.\n\nCompletely surrounding the lake was a great ring of cities constituting\nthe capital of Mars. Here the genius of the Martians had displayed\nitself to the full. The surrounding country was irrigated until it fairly\nbloomed with gigantic vegetation and flowers; the canals were carefully\nregulated with locks so that the supply of water was under complete\ncontrol; the display of magnificent metallic buildings of all kinds and\nsizes produced a most dazzling effect, and the protection against enemies\nafforded by the innumerable fortifications surrounding the ringed city,\nand guarding the neighboring lands, seemed complete.\n\n\nWaiting for the Flood.\n\nSuspended at a height of perhaps two miles from the surface, near the\nsouthern edge of the lake, we waited for the oncoming flood. With the\ndawn of day we began to perceive more clearly the effects which the news\nof the drowning of the planet had produced. It was evident that many of\nthe inhabitants of the cities had already fled. Airships on which the\nfugitives hung as thick as swarms of bees were seen, elevated but a short\ndistance above the ground, and making their way rapidly toward the south.\n\nThe Martians knew that their only hope of escape lay in reaching the\nhigh southern border of the land before the floods were upon them. But\nthey must have known also that that narrow beach would not suffice to\ncontain one in ten of those who sought refuge there. The density of the\npopulation around the Lake of the Sun seemed to us incredible. Again\nour hearts sank within us at the sight of the fearful destruction of\nlife for which we were responsible. Yet we comforted ourselves with the\nreflection that it was unavoidable. As Colonel Smith put it:\n\n\"You couldn't trust these coyotes. The only thing to do was to drown\nthem out. I am sorry for them, but I guess there will be as many left\nas will be good for us, anyhow.\"\n\n\nThe Crest of the Waters.\n\nWe had not long to wait for the flood. As the dawn began to streak the\neast we saw its awful crest moving out of the darkness, bursting across\nthe canals and plowing its way in the direction of the crowded shores of\nthe Lake of the Sun. The supply of water behind that great wave seemed\ninexhaustible. Five thousand miles it had travelled, and yet its power\nwas as great as when it started from the Syrtis Major.\n\nWe caught sight of the oncoming water before it was visible to the\nMartians beneath us. But while it was yet many miles away, the roar of it\nreached them, and then arose a chorus of terrified cries, the effect of\nwhich, coming to our ears out of the half gloom of the morning, was most\nuncanny and horrible. Thousands upon thousands of the Martians still\nremained here to become the victims of the deluge. Some, perhaps, had\ndoubted the truth of the reports that the banks were down and the floods\nwere out; others, for one reason or another had been unable to get away;\nothers, like the inhabitants of Pompeii, had lingered too long, or had\nreturned after beginning their flight to secure abandoned treasures,\nand now it was too late to get away.\n\n\nEngulfing the City.\n\nWith a roar that shook the planet the white wall rushed upon the great\ncity beneath our feet, and in an instant it had been engulfed. On went\nthe flood, swallowing up the Lake of the Sun itself, and in a little\nwhile, as far as our eyes could range, the land of Thaumasia had been\nturned into a raging sea.\n\nWe now turned our ships toward the southern border of the land, following\nthe direction of the airships carrying the fugitives, a few of which were\nstill navigating the atmosphere a mile beneath us. In their excitement and\nterror the Martians paid little attention to us, although, as the morning\nbrightened, they must have been aware of our presence over their heads.\nBut, apparently, they no longer thought of resistance; their only object\nwas escape from the immediate and appalling danger.\n\nWhen we had progressed to a point about half way from the Lake of the Sun\nto the border of the sea, having dropped down within a few hundred feet of\nthe surface, there suddenly appeared, in the midst of the raging waters,\na sight so remarkable that at first I rubbed my eyes in astonishment,\nnot crediting their report of what they beheld.\n\n\nA Woman Forty Feet High!\n\nStanding on the apex of a sandy elevation, which still rose a few feet\nabove the gathering flood, was the figure of a woman, as perfect in form\nand in classic beauty of feature as the Venus of Milo--a magnified human\nbeing not less than forty feet in height!\n\nBut for her swaying and the wild motions of her arms, we should have\nmistaken her for a marble statue.\n\nAina, who happened to be looking, instantly exclaimed:\n\n\"It is the woman from Ceres. She was taken prisoner by the Martians\nduring their last invasion of that world, and since then has been a\nslave in the palace of the Emperor.\"\n\n\nOvertaken by the Flood.\n\nApparently her great stature had enabled her to escape, while her\nmasters had been drowned. She had fled like the others, toward the south,\nbut being finally surrounded by the rising waters, had taken refuge on\nthe hillock of sand, where we saw her. This was fast giving way under\nthe assault of the waves, and even while we watched the water rose to\nher knees.\n\n\"Drop lower,\" was the order of the electrical steersman of the flagship,\nand as quickly as possible we approached the place where the towering\nfigure stood.\n\nShe had realized the hopelessness of her situation, and quickly ceased\nthose appalling and despairing gestures, which at first served to convince\nus that it was indeed a living being on whom we were looking.\n\n\nSave the Woman from Ceres!\n\nThere she stood, with a light, white garment thrown about her, erect,\nhalf-defiant, half yielding to her fear, more graceful than any Greek\nstatue, her arms outstretched, yet motionless, and her eyes upcast,\nas if praying to her God to protect her. Her hair, which shone like\ngold in the increasing light of day, streamed over her shoulders, and\nher great eyes were astare between terror and supplication. So wildly\nbeautiful a sight not one of us had ever beheld. For a moment sympathy\nwas absorbed in admiration. Then:\n\n\"Save her! Save her!\" was the cry that arose throughout the ship.\n\nRopes were instantly thrown out, and one or two men prepared to let\nthemselves down in order better to aid her.\n\nBut when we were almost within reach, and so close that we could see\nthe very expression of her eyes, which appeared to take no note of us,\nbut to be fixed, with a far-away look upon something beyond human ken,\nsuddenly the undermined bank on which she stood gave way, the blood-red\nflood swirled in from right to left, and then:\n\n\"The waters closed above her face\nWith many a ring.\"\n\n\nShe, Like the Rest, Is Gone.\n\n\"If but for that woman's sake, I am sorry we drowned the planet,\"\nexclaimed Sidney Phillips. But a moment afterward I saw that he regretted\nwhat he had said, for Aina's eyes were fixed upon him. Perhaps, however,\nshe did not understand his remark, and perhaps if she did it gave her\nno offence.\n\nAfter this episode we pursued our way rapidly until we arrived at the\nshore of the Southern Ocean. There, as we had expected, was to be seen\na narrow strip of land with the ocean on one side and the raging flood\nseeking to destroy it on the other. In some places it had been already\nbroken through, so that the ocean was flowing in to assist in the drowning\nof Thaumasia.\n\nBut some parts of the coast were evidently so elevated that no matter\nhow high the flood might rise it would not completely cover them. Here\nthe fugitives had gathered in dense throngs and above them hovered most\nof the airships, loaded down with others who were unable to find room\nupon the dry land.\n\n\nThe Martians Not Discouraged.\n\nOn one of the loftiest and broadest of these elevations we noticed\nindications of military order in the alignment of the crowds and the shore\nall around was guarded by gigantic pickets, who mercilessly shoved back\ninto the flood all the later comers, and thus prevented too great crowding\nupon the land. In the centre of this elevation rose a palatial structure\nof red metal which Aina informed us was one of the residences of the\nEmperor, and we concluded that the monarch himself was now present there.\n\nThe absence of any signs of resistance on the part of the airships,\nand the complete drowning of all of the formidable fortifications on\nthe surface of the planet, convinced us that all we now had to do in\norder to complete our conquest was to get possession of the person of\nthe chief ruler.\n\nThe fleet was, accordingly, concentrated, and we rapidly approached the\ngreat Martian palace. As we came down within a hundred feet of them and\nboldly made our way among their airships, which retreated at our approach,\nthe Martians gazed at us with mingled fear and astonishment.\n\nWe were their conquerors and they knew it. We were coming to demand their\nsurrender, and they evidently understood that also. As we approached the\npalace signals were made from it with brilliant colored banners which\nAina informed us were intended as a token of truce.\n\n\"We shall have to go down and have a confab with them, I suppose,\"\nsaid Mr. Edison. \"We can't kill them off now that they are helpless,\nbut we must manage somehow to make them understand that unconditional\nsurrender is their only chance.\"\n\n\nA Parley with the Enemy.\n\n\"Let us take Aina with us,\" I suggested, \"and since she can speak the\nlanguage of the Martians we shall probably have no difficulty in arriving\nat an understanding.\"\n\nAccordingly the flagship was carefully brought further down in front\nof the entrance to the palace, which had been kept clear by the Martian\nguards, and while the remainder of the squadron assembled within a few\nfeet directly over our heads with the disintegrators turned upon the\npalace and the crowd below. Mr. Edison and myself, accompanied by Aina,\nstepped out upon the ground.\n\nThere was a forward movement in the immense crowd, but the guards sternly\nkept everybody back. A party of a dozen giants, preceded by one who\nseemed to be their commander, gorgeously attired in jewelled garments,\nadvanced from the entrance of the palace to meet us. Aina addressed a\nfew words to the leader, who replied sternly, and then, beckoning us to\nfollow, retraced his steps into the palace.\n\nNotwithstanding our confidence that all resistance had ceased, we did\nnot deem it wise actually to venture into the lion's den without having\ntaken every precaution against a surprise. Accordingly, before following\nthe Martian into the palace, we had twenty of the electrical ships moored\naround it in such a position that they commanded not only the entrance\nbut all of the principal windows, and then a party of forty picked men,\neach doubly armed with powerful disintegrators, were selected to attend\nus into the building. This party was placed under the command of Colonel\nSmith, and Sidney Phillips insisted on being a member of it.\n\n\nA Nearer Sight of the Martians.\n\nIn the meantime the Martian with his attendants who had first invited us\nto enter, finding that we did not follow him, had returned to the front\nof the palace. He saw the disposition that we had made of our forces,\nand instantly comprehended its significance, for his manner changed\nsomewhat, and he seemed more desirous than before to conciliate us.\n\nWhen he again beckoned us to enter, we unhesitatingly followed him,\nand, passing through the magnificent entrance, found ourselves in a\nvast ante-chamber, adorned after the manner of the Martians in the most\nexpensive manner. Thence we passed into a great circular apartment, with\na dome painted in imitation of the sky, and so lofty that to our eyes it\nseemed like the firmament itself. Here we found ourselves approaching an\nelevated throne situated in the centre of the apartment, while long rows\nof brilliantly armored guards flanked us on either side, and, grouped\naround the throne, some standing and others reclining upon the flights of\nsteps which appeared to be of solid gold, was an array of Martian woman,\nbeautifully and becomingly attired, all of whom greatly astonished us\nby the singular charm of their faces and bearing, so different from the\naspect of most of the Martians, whom we had already encountered.\n\n\nThe Martians' Beautiful Women.\n\nDespite their stature--for these women averaged twelve or thirteen feet\nin height--the beauty of their complexions--of a dark, olive tint--was\nno less brilliant than that of the women of Italy or Spain.\n\nAt the top of the steps on a magnificent golden throne, sat the Emperor\nhimself. There are some busts of Caracalla which I have seen that are\nalmost as ugly as the face of the Martian ruler. He was of gigantic\nstature, larger than the majority of his subjects, and as near as I\ncould judge must have been between fifteen and sixteen feet in height.\n\nAs I looked at him I understood a remark which had been made by\nAina to the effect that the Martians were not all alike, and that the\npeculiarities of their minds were imprinted on their faces and expressed\nin their forms in a very wonderful, and sometimes terrible manner.\n\nI had also learned from her that Mars was under a military government,\nand that the military class had absolute control of the planet. I\nwas somewhat startled, then, in looking at the head and centre of the\ngreat military system of Mars, to find in his appearance a striking\nconfirmation of the speculations of our terrestrial phrenologists.\nHis broad, mis-shapen head bulged in those parts where they had placed\nthe so-called organs of combativeness, destructiveness, etc.\n\n\nSomething Learned About Them.\n\nPlainly, this was an effect of his training and education. His very\nbrain had become a military engine; and the aspect of his face, the\npitiless lines of his mouth and chin, the evil glare of his eyes, the\nattitude and carriage of his muscular body, all tended to complete the\nwarlike ensemble.\n\nHe was magnificently dressed in some vesture that had the lustre of a\npolished plate of gold, with the suppleness of velvet. As we approached\nhe fixed his immense, deep-set eyes sternly upon our faces.\n\nThe contrast between his truly terrible countenance and the Eve-like\nfeatures of the women who surrounded his throne was as great as if Satan\nafter his fall had here re-enthroned himself in the midst of angels.\n\nMr. Edison, Colonel Smith, Sidney Phillips, Aina and myself advanced at\nthe head of the procession, our guard following in close order behind\nus. It had been evident from the moment that we entered the palace that\nAina was regarded with aversion by all of the Martians. Even the women\nabout the throne gazed scowlingly at her as we drew near. Apparently,\nthe bitterness of feeling which had led to the awful massacre of all her\nrace had not yet vanished. And, indeed, since the fact that she remained\nalive could have been known only to the Martian who had abducted her and\nto his immediate companions, her reappearance with us must have been a\ngreat surprise to all those who now looked upon her.\n\n\nThe Enemy Vanquished.\n\nThe Martians Succumb at Last, and Are at Our Mercy.\n\nIt was clear to me that the feeling aroused by her appearance was every\nmoment becoming more intense. Still, the thought of a violent outbreak\ndid not occur to me, because our recent triumph had seemed so complete\nthat I believed the Martians would be awed by our presence, and would\nnot undertake actually to injure the girl.\n\nI think we all had the same impression, but as the event proved, we\nwere mistaken.\n\nSuddenly one of the gigantic guards, as if actuated by a fit of\nungovernable hatred, lifted his foot and kicked Aina. With a loud shriek,\nshe fell to the floor.\n\n\nAina Attacked by a Martian.\n\nThe blow was so unexpected that for a second we all remained riveted to\nthe spot. Then I saw Colonel Smith's face turn livid, and at the same\ninstant heard the whirr of his disintegrator, while Sidney Phillips,\nforgetting the deadly instrument that he carried in his hand, sprung madly\ntoward the brute who had kicked Aina, as if he intended to throttle him,\ncolossus as he was.\n\nBut Colonel Smith's aim, though instantaneously taken, as he had been\naccustomed to shoot on the plains, was true, and Phillips, plunging madly\nforward, seemed wreathed in a faint blue mist--all that the disintegrator\nhad left of the gigantic Martian.\n\n\nSwift Vengeance.\n\nWho could adequately describe the scene that followed?\n\nI remember that the Martian Emperor sprang to his feet, looking tenfold\nmore terrible than before. I remember that there instantly burst from\nthe line of guards on either side crinkling beams of death-fire that\nseemed to sear the eyeballs. I saw a half a dozen of our men fall in\nheaps of ashes, and even at that terrible moment I had time to wonder\nthat a single one of us remained alive.\n\nRather by instinct than in consequence of any order given, we formed\nourselves in a hollow square, with Aina lying apparently lifeless in\nthe centre, and then with gritted teeth we did our work.\n\nThe lines of guards melted before the disintegrators like rows of snow\nmen before a licking flame.\n\n\nA Terrible Battle.\n\nThe discharge of the lightning engines in the hands of the Martians in\nthat confined space made an uproar so tremendous that it seemed to pass\nthe bounds of human sense.\n\nMore of our men fell before their awful fire, and for the second time\nsince our arrival on this dreadful planet of war our annihilation seemed\ninevitable.\n\nBut in a moment the whole scene changed. Suddenly there was a discharge\ninto the room which I knew came from one of the disintegrators of the\nelectrical ships. It swept through the crowded throng like a destroying\nblast. Instantly from another side swished a second discharge, no less\ndestructive, and this was quickly followed by a third. Our ships were\nfiring through the windows.\n\n\nThe Power of the Disintegrator.\n\nAlmost at the same moment I saw the flagship, which had been moored in the\nair close to the entrance and floating only three or four feet above the\nground, pushing its way through the gigantic doorway from the ante-room,\nwith its great disintegrators pointed upon the crowd like the muzzles\nof a cruiser's guns.\n\nAnd now the Martians saw that the contest was hopeless for them, and\ntheir mad struggle to get out of the range of the disintegrators and\nto escape from the death chamber was more appalling to look upon than\nanything that had yet occurred.\n\nIt was a panic of giants. They trod one another under foot; they yelled\nand screamed in their terror; they tore each other with their clawlike\nfingers. They no longer thought of resistance. The battle spirit had\nbeen blown out of them by a breath of terror that shivered their marrow.\n\n\nNo Pity for Our Foes.\n\nStill the pitiless disintegrators played upon them until Mr. Edison,\nmaking himself heard, now that the thunder of their engines had ceased\nto reverberate through the chamber, commanded that our fire should cease.\n\nIn the meantime the armed Martians outside the palace, hearing the\nuproar within, seeing our men pouring their fire through the windows,\nand supposing that we were guilty at once of treachery and assassination,\nhad attempted an attack upon the electrical ships stationed round the\nbuilding. But fortunately they had none of their larger engines at hand,\nand with their hand arms alone they had not been able to stand up against\nthe disintegrators. They were blown away before the withering fire of\nthe ships by the hundred until, fleeing from destruction, they rushed\nmadly, driving their unarmed companions before them into the seething\nwaters of the flood close at hand.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII.\n\n\nThe Emperor Survives.\n\nThrough all this terrible contest the emperor of the Martians had remained\nstanding upon his throne, gazing at the awful spectacle, and not moving\nfrom the spot. Neither he nor the frightened woman gathered upon the steps\nof the throne had been injured by the disintegrators. Their immunity\nwas due to the fact that the position and elevation of the throne were\nsuch that it was not within the range of fire of the electrical ships\nwhich had poured their vibratory discharges through the windows, and we\ninside had only directed our fire toward the warriors who had attacked us.\n\nNow that the struggle was over we turned our attention to\nAina. Fortunately the girl had not been seriously injured and she was\nquickly restored to consciousness. Had she been killed, we would have\nbeen practically helpless in attempting further negotiations, because\nthe knowledge which we had acquired of the language of the Martians from\nthe prisoner captured on the golden asteroid, was not sufficient to meet\nthe requirements of the occasion.\n\n\nThe Emperor Our Prisoner.\n\nWhen the Martian monarch saw that we had ceased the work of death, he\nsank upon his throne. There he remained, leaning his chin upon his two\nhands and staring straight before him like that terrible doomed creature\nwho fascinates the eyes of every beholder standing in the Sistine Chapel\nand gazing at Michael Angelo's dreadful painting of \"The Last Judgement.\"\n\nThis wicked Martian also felt that he was in the grasp of pitiless and\nirresistible fate, and that a punishment too well deserved, and from\nwhich there was no possible escape, now confronted him.\n\nThere he remained in a hopelessness which almost compelled our sympathy,\nuntil Aina had so far recovered that she was once more able to act\nas our interpreter. Then we made short work of the negotiations.\nSpeaking through Aina, the commander said:\n\n\"You know who we are. We have come from the earth, which, by your command,\nwas laid waste. Our commission was not revenge, but self-protection. What\nwe have done has been accomplished with that in view. You have just\nwitnessed an example of our power, the exercise of which was not dictated\nby our wish, but compelled by the attack wantonly made upon a helpless\nmember of our own race under our protection.\"\n\n\nWe Dictate Terms.\n\n\"We have laid waste your planet, but it is simply a just retribution\nfor what you did with ours. We are prepared to complete the destruction,\nleaving not a living being in this world of yours, or to grant you peace,\nat your choice. Our condition of peace is simply this: 'All resistance\nmust cease absolutely.'\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" broke in Colonel Smith; \"let the scorpion pull out his\nsting or we'll do it for him.\"\n\n\"Nothing that we could now do,\" continued the commander, \"would in my\nopinion save you from ultimate destruction. The forces of nature which\nwe have been compelled to let loose upon you will complete their own\nvictory. But we do not wish, unnecessarily, to stain our hands further\nwith your blood. We shall leave you in possession of your lives. Preserve\nthem if you can. But, in case the flood recedes before you have all\nperished from starvation, remember that you here take an oath, solemnly\nbinding yourself and your descendants forever never again to make war\nupon the earth.\"\n\n\nWe Show Mercy.\n\n\"That's really the best we can do,\" said Mr. Edison, turning to us. \"We\ncan't possibly murder these people in cold blood. The probability is\nthat the flood has hopelessly ruined all their engines of war. I do not\nbelieve that there is one chance in ten that the waters will drain off\nin time to enable them to get at their stores of provisions before they\nhave perished from starvation.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion,\" said Lord Kelvin, who had joined us (his pair of\ndisintegrators hanging by his side, attached to a strap running over\nthe back of his neck, very much as a farmer sometimes carries his big\nmittens), \"it is my opinion that the flood will recede more rapidly than\nyou think, and that the majority of these people will survive. But I\nquite agree with your merciful view of the matter. We must be guilty of\nno wanton destruction. Probably more than nine-tenths of the inhabitants\nof Mars have perished in the deluge. Even if all the others survived\nages would elapse before they could regain the power to injure us.\"\n\n\nThe Martians Submit.\n\nI need not describe in detail how our propositions were received by the\nMartian monarch. He knew, and his advisers, some of whom he had called\nin consultation, also knew, that everything was in our hands to do as we\npleased. They readily agreed, therefore, that they would make no more\nresistance and that we and our electrical ships should be undisturbed\nwhile we remained upon Mars. The monarch took the oath prescribed after\nthe manner of his race: thus the business was completed. But through\nit all there had been the shadow of a sneer on the emperor's face which\nI did not like. But I said nothing.\n\nAnd now we began to think of our return home, and of the pleasure we\nshould have in recounting our adventures to our friends on the earth,\nwho were doubtless eagerly waiting for news from us. We knew they had\nbeen watching Mars with powerful telescopes, and we were also eager to\nlearn how much they had seen and how much they had been able to guess\nof our proceedings.\n\nBut a day or two at least would be required to overhaul the electrical\nships and to examine the state of our provisions. Those which we had\nbrought from the earth, it will be remembered, had been spoiled and we\nhad been compelled to replace them from the compressed provisions found\nin the Martians' storehouse. This compressed food had proved not only\nexceedingly agreeable to the taste, but very nourishing, and all of us\nhad grown extremely fond of it. A new supply, however, would be needed\nin order to carry us back to the earth. At least sixty days would be\nrequired for the homeward journey, because we could hardly expect to\nstart from Mars with the same initial velocity which we had been able\nto generate on leaving home.\n\nIn considering the matter of provisioning the fleet it finally became\nnecessary to take an account of our losses. This was a thing that we had\nall shrunk from, because they had seemed to us almost too terrible to be\nborne. But now the facts had to be faced. Out of the 100 ships, carrying\nsomething more than two thousand souls, with which we had quitted the\nearth, there remained only fifty-five ships and 1,085 men! All the\nothers had been lost in our terrific encounters with the Martians,\nand particularly in our first disastrous battle beneath the clouds.\n\n\nPreparing to Return.\n\nAmong the lost were many men whose names were famous upon the earth, and\nwhose death would be widely deplored when the news of it was received\nupon their native planet. Fortunately this number did not include any\nof those whom I have had occasion to mention in the course of this\nnarrative. The venerable Lord Kelvin, who, notwithstanding his age, and\nhis pacific disposition, proper to a man of science, had behaved with the\ncourage and coolness of a veteran in every crisis; Monsieur Moissan, the\neminent chemist; Prof. Sylvanus P. Thompson, and the Heidelberg Professor,\nto whom we all felt under special obligations because he had opened to\nour comprehension the charming lips of Aina--all these had survived,\nand were about to return with us to the earth.\n\nIt seemed to some of us almost heartless to deprive the Martians who\nstill remained alive of any of the provisions which they themselves\nwould require to tide them over the long period which must elapse before\nthe recession of the flood should enable them to discover the sites of\ntheir ruined homes, and to find the means of sustenance. But necessity\nwas now our only law. We learned from Aina that there must be stores\nof provisions in the neighborhood of the palace, because it was the\ncustom of the Martians to lay up such stores during the harvest time\nin each Martian year in order to provide against the contingency of an\nextraordinary drought.\n\nIt was not with very good grace that the Martian Emperor acceded to our\ndemands that one of the storehouses should be opened, but resistance\nwas useless, and of course we had our way.\n\nThe supplies of water which we brought from the earth, owing to a peculiar\nprocess invented by Monsieur Moissan, had been kept in exceedingly good\ncondition, but they were now running low and it became necessary to\nreplenish them also. This was easily done from the Southern Ocean, for\non Mars, since the levelling of the continental elevations, brought about\nmany years ago, there is comparatively little salinity in the sea waters.\n\nWhile these preparations were going on Lord Kelvin and the other men\nof science entered with the utmost eagerness upon those studies, the\nprosecution of which had been the principal inducement leading them\nto embark on the expedition. But, almost all of the face of the planet\nbeing covered with the flood, there was comparatively little that they\ncould do. Much, however, could be learned with the aid of Aina from the\nMartians, now crowded on the land about the palace.\n\nThe results of these discoveries will in due time appear, fully\nelaborated in learned and authoritative treatises prepared by these\nsavants themselves. I shall only call attention to one, which seemed\nto me very remarkable. I have already said that there were astonishing\ndifferences in the personal appearance of the Martians, evidently\narising from differences of character and education, which had impressed\nthemselves in the physical aspect of the individuals.\n\nWe now learned that these differences were more completely the result\nof education than we had at first supposed.\n\nLooking about among the Martians by whom we were surrounded, it soon\nbecame easy for us to tell who were the soldiers and who were the\ncivilians, simply by the appearance of their bodies, and particularly of\ntheir heads. All members of the military class resembled, to a greater\nor less extent, the monarch himself, in that those parts of their skulls\nwhich our phrenologists had designated as the bumps of destructiveness,\ncombativeness and so on were enormously and disproportionately developed.\n\nAnd all this, as we were assured, was completely under the control of the\nMartians themselves. They had learned, or invented, methods by which the\nbrain itself could be manipulated, so to speak, and any desired portions\nof it could be specially developed, while the other parts of it were left\nto their normal growth. The consequence was that in the Martian schools\nand colleges there was no teaching in our sense of the word. It was all\nbrain culture.\n\nA Martian youth selected to be a soldier had his fighting faculties\nespecially developed, together with those parts of the brain which impart\ncourage and steadiness of nerve. He who was intended for scientific\ninvestigation had his brain developed into a mathematical machine, or\nan instrument of observation. Poets and literary men had their heads\nbulging with the imaginative faculties. The heads of inventors were\ndeveloped into a still different shape.\n\n\"And so,\" said Aina, translating for us the words of a professor in\nthe Imperial University of Mars, from whom we derived the greater part\nof our information on this subject, \"the Martian boys do not study\na subject; they do not have to learn it, but, when their brains have\nbeen sufficiently developed in the proper direction, they comprehend it\ninstantly, by a kind of divine instinct.\"\n\nBut among the women of Mars, we saw none of these curious, and to our\neyes monstrous, differences of development. While the men received,\nin addition to their special education, a broad general culture also,\nwith the women there was no special education. It was all general in\nits character, yet thorough enough in that way. The consequence was\nthat only female brains upon Mars were entirely well balanced. This was\nthe reason why we invariably found the Martian women to be remarkably\ncharming creatures, with none of those physical exaggerations and uncouth\ndevelopments which disfigured their masculine companions.\n\nAll the books of the Martians, we ascertained, were books of history and\nof poetry. For scientific treatises they had no need, because, as I have\nexplained, when the brains of those intended for scientific pursuits had\nbeen developed in the proper way the knowledge of nature's laws came to\nthem without effort, as a spring bubbles from the rocks.\n\nOne word of explanation may be needed concerning the failure of the\nMartians, with all their marvellous powers, to invent electrical ships\nlike those of Mr. Edison and engines of destruction comparable with our\ndisintegrators. This failure was simply due to the fact that on Mars\nthere did not exist the peculiar metals by the combination of which\nMr. Edison had been able to effect his wonders. The theory involved in\nour inventions was perfectly understood by them, and had they possessed\nthe means, doubtless they would have been able to carry it into practice\neven more effectively than we had done.\n\nAfter two or three days all the preparations having been completed,\nthe signal was given for our departure. The men of science were still\nunwilling to leave this strange world, but Mr. Edison decided that we\ncould linger no longer.\n\nAt the moment of starting a most tragic event occurred. Our fleet was\nassembled around the palace, and the signal was given to rise slowly to a\nconsiderable height before imparting a great velocity to the electrical\nships. As we slowly rose we saw the immense crowd of giants beneath us,\nwith upturned faces, watching our departure. The Martian monarch and all\nhis suite had come out upon the terrace of the palace to look at us. At\na moment when he probably supposed himself to be unwatched he shook his\nfist at the retreating fleet. My eyes and those of several others in\nthe flagship chanced to be fixed upon him. Just as he made the gesture\none of the women of his suite, in her eagerness to watch us, apparently\nlost her balance and stumbled against him. Without a moment's hesitation,\nwith a tremendous blow, he felled her like an ox at his feet.\n\nA fearful oath broke from the lips of Colonel Smith, who was one of those\nlooking on. It chanced that he stood near the principal disintegrator\nof the flagship. Before anybody could interfere he had sighted and\ndischarged it. The entire force of the terrible engine, almost capable\nof destroying a fort, fell upon the Martian Emperor, and not merely blew\nhim into a cloud of atoms, but opened a great cavity in the ground on\nthe spot where he had stood.\n\nA shout arose from the Martians, but they were too much astounded at\nwhat had occurred to make any hostile demonstrations, and, anyhow,\nthey knew well that they were completely at our mercy.\n\nMr. Edison was on the point of rebuking Colonel Smith for what he had\ndone, but Aina interposed.\n\n\"I am glad it was done,\" said she, \"for now only can you be safe. That\nmonster was more directly responsible than any other inhabitant of Mars\nfor all the wickedness of which they have been guilty.\"\n\n\"The expedition against the earth was inspired solely by him. There is\na tradition among the Martians--which my people, however, could never\ncredit--that he possessed a kind of immortality. They declared that it\nwas he who led the former expedition against the earth when my ancestors\nwere brought away prisoners from their happy home, and that it was his\nimage which they had set up in stone in the midst of the Land of Sand. He\nprolonged his existence, according to this legend, by drinking the waters\nof a wonderful fountain, the secret of whose precise location was known\nto him alone, but which was situated at that point where in your maps of\nMars the name of the Fons Juventae occurs. He was personified wickedness,\nthat I know; and he never would have kept his oath if power had returned\nto him again to injure the earth. In destroying him, you have made your\nvictory secure.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII.\n\n\nWhen at length we once more saw our native planet, with its\nwell-remembered features of land and sea, rolling beneath our eyes,\nthe feeling of joy that came over us transcended all powers of expression.\n\nIn order that all the nations which had united in sending out the\nexpedition should have visual evidence of its triumphant return, it\nwas decided to make the entire circuit of the earth before seeking our\nstarting point and disembarking. Brief accounts in all known languages,\ntelling the story of what we had done were accordingly prepared, and then\nwe dropped down through the air until again we saw the well-loved blue\ndome over our heads, and found ourselves suspended directly above the\nwhite-topped cone of Fujiyama, the sacred mountain of Japan. Shifting our\nplace toward the northeast, we hung above the city of Tokio and dropped\ndown into the crowds that had assembled to watch us, the prepared accounts\nof our journey, which, the moment they had been read and comprehended,\nled to such an outburst of rejoicing as it would be quite impossible\nto describe.\n\nOne of the ships containing the Japanese members of the expedition\ndropped to the ground, and we left them in the midst of their rejoicing\ncountrymen. Before we started--and we remained but a short time suspended\nabove the Japanese capital--millions had assembled to greet us with\ntheir cheers.\n\nWe now repeated what we had done during our first examination of the\nsurface of Mars. We simply remained suspended in the atmosphere, allowing\nthe earth to turn beneath us. As Japan receded in the distance we found\nChina beginning to appear. Shifting our position a little toward the\nsouth we again came to rest over the city of Pekin, where once more we\nparted with some of our companions, and where the outburst of universal\nrejoicing was repeated.\n\nFrom Asia, crossing the Caspian Sea, we passed over Russia, visiting in\nturn Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nStill the great globe rolled steadily beneath, and still we kept the\nsun with us. Now Germany appeared, and now Italy, and then France,\nand England, as we shifted our position, first North then South, in\norder to give all the world the opportunity to see that its warriors\nhad returned victorious from their far conquest. And in each country as\nit passed beneath our feet, we left some of the comrades who had shared\nour perils and our adventures.\n\nAt length the Atlantic had rolled away under us, and we saw the spires\nof the new New York.\n\nThe news of our coming had been flashed ahead from Europe, and our\ncountrymen were prepared to welcome us. We had originally started, it\nwill be remembered, at midnight, and now again as we approached the new\ncapital of the world the curtain of night was just beginning to be drawn\nover it. But our signal lights were ablaze, and through these they were\naware of our approach.\n\nAgain the air was filled with bursting rockets and shaken with the roar\nof cannon, and with volleying cheers, poured from millions of throats,\nas we came to rest directly above the city.\n\nThree days after the landing of the fleet, and when the first enthusiasm\nof our reception had a little passed, I received a beautifully engraved\ncard inviting me to be present in Trinity Church at the wedding of Aina\nand Sidney Phillips.\n\nWhen I arrived at the church, which had been splendidly decorated, I\nfound there Mr. Edison, Lord Kelvin, and all the other members of the\ncrew of the flagship, and, considerably to my surprise, Colonel Smith,\nappropriately attired, and with a grace for the possession of which I\nhad not given him credit, gave away the beautiful bride.\n\nBut Alonzo Jefferson Smith was a man and a soldier, every inch of him.\n\n\"I asked her for myself,\" he whispered to me after the ceremony,\nswallowing a great lump in his throat, \"but she has had the desire of\nher heart. I am going back to the plains. I can get a command again,\nand I still know how to fight.\"\n\nAnd thus was united, for all future time, the first stem of the Aryan\nrace, which had been long lost, but not destroyed, with the latest\noffspring of that great family, and the link which had served to bring\nthem together was the far-away planet of Mars.\n\n(The End.)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Edison's Conquest of Mars, by\nGarrett Putman Serviss\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EDISON'S CONQUEST OF MARS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19141.txt or 19141.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/1/4/19141/\n\nProduced by Jason Isbell, Greg Weeks, Renald Levesque, and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
