They have been ruled by benevolent\n    dictatorships and pure democracies, every form of government from\n    extreme right to absolute left. Unique among these is the easy-going\n    semi-anarchistic society ruled by THE SYNDIC.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n     \"It was not until February 14th that the Government declared a\n     state of unlimited emergency. The precipitating incident was the\n     aerial bombardment and destruction of B Company, 27th Armored\n     Regiment, on Fort George Hill in New York City. Local Syndic\n     leaders had occupied and fortified George Washington High School,\n     with the enthusiastic co-operation of students, faculty and\n     neighborhood. Chief among them was Thomas 'Numbers' Cleveland,\n     displaying the same coolness and organizational genius which had\n     brought him to pre-eminence in the metropolitan policy-wheel\n     organization by his thirty-fifth year.\n\n     \"At 5:15 A.M. the first battalion of the 27th Armored took up\n     positions in the area as follows: A Company at 190th Street and St.\n     Nicholas Avenue, with the mission of preventing reinforcement of\n     the school from the I.R.T. subway station there; Companies B, C,\n     and D hill down from the school on the slope of Fort George Hill\n     poised for an attack. At 5:25 the sixteen Patton tanks of B Company\n     revved up and moved on the school, C and D Companies remaining in\n     reserve. The plan was for the tanks of B Company to surround the\n     school on three sides--the fourth is a precipice--and open fire if\n     a telephone parley with Cleveland did not result in an\n     unconditional surrender. There was no surrender and the tanks\n     attacked.\n\n     \"Cleveland's observation post was in the tower room of the school.\n     Seeing the radio mast of the lead tank top the rise of the hill, he\n     snapped out a telephone order to contact pilots waiting for the\n     word at a Syndic field floating outside the seven mile limit. The\n     pilots, trained to split-second precision in their years of public\n     service, were airborn by 5:26, but this time their cargo was not\n     liquor, cigarettes or luggage. In three minutes, they were whipping\n     rocket bombs into the tanks of Company B; Cleveland's runners\n     charged the company command post; the trial by fire had begun.\n\n     \"Before it ended North America was to see deeds as gallant and\n     strategy as inspired as any in the history of war: Cleveland's\n     historic announcement--'It's a great day for the race!'--his death\n     at the head of his runners in a charge on the Fort Totten garrison,\n     the firm hand of Amadeo Falcaro taking up the scattered reins of\n     leadership, parley, peace, betrayal and execution of hostages, the\n     Treaty of Las Vegas and a united Mob-Syndic front against\n     Government, O'Toole's betrayal of the Continental Press wire room\n     and the bloody battle to recapture that crucial nerve center, the\n     decisive march on Baltimore....\"\n\n     B. Arrowsmith Hynde,\n\n     _The Syndic--a Short History_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     \"No accurate history of the future has ever been written--a fact\n     which I think disposes of history's claim to rank as a science.\n     Astronomers quail at the three-body problem and throw up their\n     hands in surrender before the four-body problem. Any given moment\n     in history is a problem of at least two billion bodies. Attempts at\n     orderly abstraction of manipulable symbols from the realities of\n     history seem to me doomed from the start. I can juggle mean\n     rain-falls, car-loading curves, birth-rates and patent\n     applications, but I cannot for the life of me fit the recurring\n     facial carbuncles of Karl Marx into my manipulations--not even,\n     though we know, well after the fact, that agonizing staphylococcus\n     aureus infections behind that famous beard helped shape\n     twentieth-century totalitarianism. In pathology alone the list\n     could be prolonged indefinitely: Julius Caesar's epilepsy,\n     Napoleon's gastritis, Wilson's paralysis, Grant's alcoholism,\n     Wilhelm II's withered arm, Catherine's nymphomania, George III's\n     paresis, Edison's deafness, Euler's blindness, Burke's stammer, and\n     so on. Is there anybody silly enough to maintain that the world\n     today would be what it is if Marx, Caesar, Napoleon, Wilson, Grant,\n     Wilhelm, Catherine, George, Edison, Euler and Burke--to take only\n     these eleven--were anything but what they were? Yet that is the\n     assumption behind theories of history which exclude the carbuncles\n     of Marx from their referents--that is to say, every theory of\n     history with which I am familiar....\n\n     \"Am I then saying that history, past and future, is unknowable;\n     that we must blunder ahead in the dark without planning because no\n     plan can possibly be accurate in prediction and useful in\n     application? I am not. I am expressing my distaste for holders of\n     extreme positions, for possessors of eternal truths, for keepers of\n     the flame. Keepers of the flame have no trouble with the questions\n     of ends and means which plague the rest of us. They are quite\n     certain that their ends are good and that therefore choice of means\n     is a trivial matter. The rest of us, far from certain that we have\n     a general solution of the two-billion body problem that is\n     history, are much more likely to ponder on our means....\"\n\n     F. W. Taylor,\n\n     _Organization, Symbolism and Morale_\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nCharles Orsino was learning the business from the ground up--even though\n\"up\" would never be very high. He had in his veins only a drop or two of\nFalcaro blood: enough so that room had to be made for him; not enough\nfor it to be a great dearth of room. Counting heavily on the good will\nof F. W. Taylor, who had taken a fancy to him when he lost his parents\nin the Brookhaven Reactor explosion of '83, he might rise to a rather\nresponsible position in Alky, Horsewire, Callgirl, recruitment and\nRetirement or whatever line he showed an aptitude for. But at 22 one\nspring day, he was merely serving a tour of duty as bagman attached to\nthe 101st New York Police Precinct. A junior member of the Syndic\ncustomarily handled that job; you couldn't trust the cops not to squeeze\ntheir customers and pocket the difference.\n\nHe walked absently through the not-unpleasant routine of the shakedown.\nHis mind was on his early-morning practice session of polo, in which he\nhad almost disgraced himself.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Orsino; a pleasure to see you again. Would you like\na cold glass of beer while I get the loot?\"\n\n\"No, but thanks very much, Mr. Lefko--I'm in training, you know. Wish I\ncould take you up on it. Seven phones, isn't it, at ten dollars a\nphone?\"\n\n\"That's right, Mr. Orsino, and I'll be with you as soon as I lay off the\nseventh at Hialeah; all the ladies went for a plater named Hearthmouse\nbecause they thought the name was cute and left me with a dutch book. I\nwon't be a minute.\"\n\nLefko scuttled to a phone and dickered with another bookie somewhere\nwhile Charles absently studied the crowd of chattering, laughing\nhorseplayers. (\"Mister Orsino, did you come out to make a monkey of\nyourself and waste my time? Confound it, sir, you have just fifty round\nto a chukker and you must make them count!\" He grinned unhappily. Old\nGilby, the pro, could be abrasive when a bone-head play disfigured the\ngame he loved. Charles had been sure Benny Grashkin's jeep would conk\nout in a minute--it had been sputtering badly enough--and that he would\nhave had a dirt-cheap scoring shot while Benny changed mounts. But\nGilby blew the whistle and wasn't interested in your fine-spun logic.\n\"Confound it, sir, when will you young rufflers learn that you must\ncrawl before you walk? Now let me see a team rush for the goal--and I\nmean _team_, Mr. Orsino!\")\n\n\"_Here_ we are, Mr. Orsino, and just in time. There goes the seventh.\"\n\nCharles shook hands and left amid screams of \"Hearthmouse! Hearthmouse!\"\nfrom the lady bettors watching the screen.\n\nHigh up in the Syndic Building, F. W. Taylor--Uncle Frank to\nCharles--was giving a terrific tongue-lashing to a big, stooped old man.\nThornberry, president of the Chase National Bank, had pulled a butch and\nF. W. Taylor was blazing mad about it.\n\nHe snarled: \"One more like this, Thornberry, and you are out on your\npadded can. When a respectable member of the Syndic chooses to come to\nyou for a line of credit, you will in the future give it without any\ntom-fool quibbling about security. You bankers seem to think this is the\nmiddle ages and that your bits of paper still have their old black\nmagic.\n\n\"Disabuse yourself of the notion. Nobody except you believes in it. The\nInexorable Laws of Economics are as dead as Dagon and Ishtar, and for\nthe same reason. No more worshippers. You bankers can't shove anybody\naround any more. You're just a convenience, like the non-playing banker\nin a card game.\n\n\"What's real now is the Syndic. What's real about the Syndic is its own\nmorale and the public's faith in it. Is that _clear_?\"\n\nThornberry brokenly mumbled something about supply and demand.\n\nTaylor sneered. \"Supply and demand. Urim and Thummim. Show me a supply,\nThornberry, show me a--oh, hell. I haven't time to waste re-educating\nyou. Remember what I told you and don't argue. Unlimited credit to\nSyndic members. If they overdo it, _we'll_ rectify the situation. Now,\nget out.\" And Thornberry did, with senile tears in his eyes.\n\nAt Mother Maginnis' Ould Sod Pub, Mother Maginnis pulled a long face\nwhen Charles Orsino came in. \"It's always a pleasure to see you, Mr.\nOrsino, but I'm afraid this week it'll be no pleasure for you to see\nme.\"\n\nShe was always roundabout. \"Why, what do you mean, Mrs. M.? I'm always\nhappy to say hello to a customer.\"\n\n\"It's the business, Mr. Orsino. It's the business. You'll pardon me if I\nsay that I can't see how to spare twenty-five dollars from the till, not\nif my life depended on it. I can go to fifteen, but so help me--\"\n\nCharles looked grave--graver than he felt. It happened every day. \"You\nrealize, Mrs. Maginnis, that you're letting the Syndic down. What would\nthe people in Syndic Territory do for protection if everybody took your\nattitude?\"\n\nShe looked sly. \"I was thinking, Mr. Orsino, that a young man like you\nmust have a way with the girls--\" By a mighty unsubtle maneuver, Mrs.\nMaginnis' daughter emerged from the back room at that point and began\ndemurely mopping the bar. \"And,\" she continued, \"sure, any young lady\nwould consider it an honor to spend the evening with a young gentleman\nfrom the Syndic--\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Charles said, rapidly thinking it over. He would infinitely\nrather spend the evening with a girl than at a Shakespeare revival as he\nhad planned, but there were drawbacks. In the first place, it would be\nbribery. In the second place, he might fall for the girl and wake up\nwith Mrs. Maginnis for his mother-in-law--a fate too nauseating to\ncontemplate for more than a moment. In the third place, he had already\nbought the tickets for himself and bodyguard.\n\n\"About the shakedown,\" he said decisively. \"Call it fifteen this week.\nIf you're still doing badly next week, I'll have to ask for a look at\nyour books--to see whether a regular reduction is in order.\"\n\nShe got the hint, and colored. Putting down fifteen dollars, she said:\n\"Sure, that won't be necessary. I'm expecting business to take a turn\nfor the better. It's sure to pick up.\"\n\n\"Good, then.\" To show there were no hard feelings, he stayed for a\nmoment to ask: \"How are your husbands?\"\n\n\"So-so. Alfie's on the road this week and Dinnie's got the rheumatism\nagain but he can tend bar late, when it's slow.\"\n\n\"Tell him to drop around to the Medical Center and mention my name, Mrs.\nMaginnis. Maybe they can do something for him.\"\n\nShe glowed with thanks and he left.\n\nIt was pleasant to be able to do things for nice people; it was pleasant\nto stroll along the sunny street acknowledging tipped hats and friendly\nwords. (That team rush for the goal had been a sorry mess, but not his\nfault--quite. Vladek had loosed a premature burst from his fifty caliber\nat the ball, and sent it hurling off to the right; they had braked and\nbacked with much grinding of gears to form V again behind it, when\nGilby blew the whistle again.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA nervous youngster in the National Press Service New York drop was\nfacing his first crisis on the job. Trouble lights had flashed\nsimultaneously on the Kansas City-New York, Hialeah-New York and\nBoston-New York trunks. He stood, paralyzed.\n\nHis supervisor took it in in a flash and banged open the circuit to\nService. To the genial face that appeared on the screen, he snapped:\n\"Trace Hialeah, Boston and Kansas City--in that order, Micky.\"\n\nMicky said: \"Okay, pal,\" and vanished.\n\nThe supervisor turned to the youngster. \"Didn't know what to do?\" he\nasked genially. \"Don't let it worry you. Next time you'll know. You\nnoticed the order of priority?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the boy gulped.\n\n\"It wasn't an accident that I gave it to him that way. First, Hialeah\nbecause it was the most important. We get the bulk of our revenue from\nserving the horse rooms--in fact, I understand we started as a horse\nwire exclusively. Naturally the horse-room customers pay for it in the\nlong run, but they pay without pain. Nobody's forcing them to improve\nthe breed, right?\n\n\"Second, Boston-New York trunk. That's common-carrier while the Fair\nGrounds isn't running up there. We don't make any profit on\ncommon-carrier service, the rates are too low, but we owe it to the\npublic that supports us.\n\n\"Third, Kansas City-New York. That's common carrier too, but with one\nterminal in Mob Territory. No reason why we should knock ourselves out\nfor Regan and his boys, but after the other two are traced and closed,\nwe'll get around to them. Think you got it straight now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the youngster said.\n\n\"Good. Just take it easy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe supervisor moved away to do a job of billing that didn't need\nimmediate doing; he wanted to avoid the very appearance of nagging the\nboy. He wondered too, if he'd really put it over, and decided he hadn't.\nWho could, after all. It took years on the wires to get the feel. Slowly\nyour motivation changed. You started by wanting to make a place for\nyourself and earn some dough. After years you realized, not with a\nblinding flash, but gradually, that you were working for quite another\nreason. Nice gang here that treats you right. Don't let the Syndic down.\nThe customers pay for their fun and by God, you see that they get it or\nbust a gut trying.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn his way to the 101st Precinct station house, the ears of Charles\nOrsino burned as he thought of the withering lecture that had followed\nthe blast on Gilby's whistle. \"_Mister_ Orsino, is it or is it not your\nresponsibility as team captain to demand that a dangerous ball be taken\nout of play? And did or did not that last burst from Mister Vladek beat\nthe ball out of round, thus giving rise to a distinct possibility of\ndangerous ricochets?\" The old man was right of course, but it had been a\npocked and battered practice ball to start with; in practice sessions,\nyou couldn't afford to be fussy--not with regulation 18 inch armor steel\nballs selling for thirty dollars each at the pro shop.\n\nHe walked between the two green lamps of the precinct station and dumped\nhis bag on the sergeant's desk. Immediately the sergeant started a tale\nof woe: \"Mr. Orsino, I don't like to bother you with the men's personal\ntroubles, but I wonder if you could come through with a hundred dollar\npresent for a very deserving young fellow here. It's Patrolman Gibney,\nseven years in the old 101st and not a black mark against him. One\ncitation for shooting it out with a burglar and another for nabbing a\npast-post crook at Lefko's horse room. Gibney's been married for five\nyears and has two of the cutest kids you ever saw, and you know that\ntakes money. Now he wants to get married again, he's crazy in love with\nthe girl and his first wife don't mind, she says she can use a helping\nhand around the house, and he wants to do it right with a big wedding.\n\n\"If he can do it on a hundred, he's welcome to it,\" Charles said,\ngrinning. \"Give him my best wishes.\" He divided the pile of bills into\ntwo orderly stacks, transferred a hundred dollars to one and pocketed\nthe other.\n\nHe dropped it off at the Syndic Building, had an uninteresting dinner in\none of its cafeterias and went to his furnished room downtown. He read a\nchapter in F. W. Taylor's--Uncle Frank's--latest book, _Organization,\nSymbolism and Morale_, couldn't understand a word he read, bathed and\ngot out his evening clothes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thin and attractive girl entered a preposterously-furnished room in\nthe Syndic Building, arguing bitterly with a white-bearded, hawk-nosed\nold man.\n\n\"My dear ancestor,\" she began, with exaggerated patience.\n\n\"God-damn it, Lee, don't call me an ancestor! Makes me feel as if I was\ndead already.\"\n\n\"You might as well be for all the sense you're talking.\"\n\n\"All right, Lee.\" He looked wounded and brave.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Edward--\" She studied his face\nwith suddenly-narrowed eyes and her tone changed. \"Listen, you old\ndevil, you're not fooling me for a minute. I couldn't hurt your feelings\nwith the blunt edge of an axe. You're not talking me into anything. It'd\njust be sending somebody to his death. Besides, they were both\naccidents.\" She turned and began to fiddle with a semi-circular screen\nwhose focus was a large and complicated chair. Three synchronized\nprojectors bore on the screen.\n\nThe old man said very softly: \"And what if they weren't? Tom McGurn and\nBob were good men. None better. If the damn Government's knocking us off\none by one, something ought to be done. And you seem to be the only\nperson in a position to do it.\"\n\n\"Start a war,\" she said bitterly. \"Sweep them from the seas. Wasn't Dick\nReiner chanting that when I was in diapers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the old man brooded. \"And he's still chanting it now that you're\nin--whatever young ladies wear nowadays. Promise me something, Lee. If\nthere's another try, will you help us out?\"\n\n\"I am so sure there won't be,\" she said, \"that I'll promise. And God\nhelp you, Edward, if you try to fake one. I've told you before and I\ntell you now that it's almost certain death.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharles Orsino studied himself in a three-way mirror.\n\nThe evening suit was new; he wished the gunbelt was. The holster rode\nawkwardly on his hip; he hadn't got a new outfit since his eighteenth\nbirthday and his chest had filled out to the last hole of the\ncross-strap's buckle since then. Well, it would have to wait; the\nevening would cost him enough as it was. Five bodyguards! He winced at\nthe thought. But you had to be seen at these things and you had to do it\nright or it didn't count.\n\nHe fell into a brief reverie of meeting a beautiful, beautiful girl at\nthe theater, a girl who would think he was interesting and handsome and\na wonderful polo player, a girl who would happily turn out to be in the\ndirect Falcaro line with all sorts of powerful relations to speak up for\nhim....\n\nSomeone said on his room annunciator: \"The limousine is here, Mr.\nOrsino. I'm Halloran, your chief bodyguard.\"\n\n\"Very well, Halloran,\" he said casually, just as he'd practiced it in\nthe bathroom that morning and rode down.\n\nThe limousine was a beauty and the guards were faultlessly turned out.\nOne was democratic with one's chief guard and a little less so with the\nothers. As Halloran drove, Charles chatted with him about the play,\nwhich was Julius Caesar in modern dress. Halloran said he'd heard it was\nvery good.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir arrival in the lobby of the Costello created no sensation. Five\nbodyguards wasn't a lot of bodyguards, even though there seemed to be no\nother Syndic people there. So much for the beautiful Falcaro girl.\nCharles chatted with a television director he knew slightly. The\ndirector explained to him that the theater was sick, very sick, that\nHarry Tremaine,--he played Brutus--made a magnificent stage picture but\ncouldn't read lines.\n\nBy then Halloran was whispering in his ear that it was time to take\ntheir seats. Halloran was sweating like a pig and Charles didn't get\naround to asking him why. Charles took an aisle seat, Halloran was\nacross the aisle and the others sat to his side, front and rear.\n\nThe curtain rose on \"New York--A Street.\"\n\nThe first scene, a timekiller designed to let fidgeters subside and\ncoughers finish their coughing, was a 3-D projection of Times Square,\nwith a stylized suggestion of a public relations consultant's office\n\"down in one\" on the apron.\n\nWhen Caesar entered Orsino started, and there was a gratified murmur\naround the auditorium. He was made up as French Letour, one of the\nMobsters from the old days--technically a hero, but one who had sailed\nmighty close to the wind. This promised to be interesting.\n\n\"Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.\"\n\nAnd so to the apron where the soothsayer--public relations\nconsultant--delivered the warning contemptuously ignored by\nLetour-Caesar, and the spotlight shifted to Cassius and Brutus for their\nlong, foreboding dialogue. Brutus' back was to the audience when it\nstarted; he gradually turned--\n\n\"What means this shouting? I do fear the people will choose Caesar for\ntheir king!\"\n\nAnd you saw that Brutus was Falcaro--old Amadeo Falcaro himself, with\nthe beard and hawk nose and eyebrows.\n\nWell, let's see now. It must be some kind of tortured analogy with the\nTreaty of Las Vegas when Letour made a strong bid to unite Mob and\nSyndic and Falcaro had fought against anything but a short-term,\nstrictly military alliance. Charles felt kind of sore about Falcaro not\ngetting the title role, but he had to admit that Tremaine played Falcaro\nas the gutsy magnifico he had been. When Caesar re-entered, the contrast\nbecame clear; Caesar-Letour was a fidgety, fear-ridden man. The rest of\nthe conspirators brought on through Act One turned out to be good\nfellows all, fresh and hearty; Charles guessed everything was all right\nand he wished he could grab a nap. But Cassius was saying:\n\n\"Him and his worth and our great need of him--\"\n\nAll very loyal, Charles thought, smothering a yawn. A life for the\nSyndic and all that, but a high-brow version. Polite and dignified, like\na pavanne at Roseland. Sometimes--after, say, a near miss on the polo\nfield--he would wonder how polite and dignified the great old days\nactually had been. Amadeo Falcaro's Third Year Purge must have been an\naffair of blood and guts. Two thousand shot in three days, the history\nbooks said, adding hastily that the purged were unreconstructed,\nunreconstructable thugs whose usefulness was past, who couldn't realize\nthat the job ahead was construction and organization.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Halloran was touching Charles on the shoulder. \"Intermission in a\nsecond, sir.\"\n\nThey marched up the aisle as the curtain fell to applause and the rest\nof the audience began to rise. Then the impossible happened.\n\nHalloran had gone first; Charles was behind him, with the four other\nguards hemming him in. As Halloran reached the door to the lobby at the\ntop of the aisle, he turned to face Charles and performed an\ninexplicable pantomime. It was quite one second before Charles realized\nthat Halloran was tugging at his gun, stuck in the holster.\n\nThe guard to the left of Charles softly said: \"Jesus!\" and threw himself\nat Halloran as the chief guard's gun came loose. There was a .45 caliber\nroar, muffled. There was another that crashed, unmuffled, a yard from\nCharles' right ear. The two figures at the head of the aisle collapsed\nlimply and the audience began to shriek. Somebody with a very loud voice\nroared: \"Keep calm! It's all part of the play! Don't get panicky! It's\npart of the play!\"\n\nThe man who was roaring moved up to the aisle door, fell silent, saw\nand smelled the blood and fainted.\n\nA woman began to pound the guard on Charles' right with her fists,\nyelling: \"What did you do to my husband? You shot my husband!\" She meant\nthe man who had fainted; Charles peeled her off the bodyguard.\n\nSomehow they got into the lobby, followed by most of the audience. The\nthree bodyguards held them at bay. Charles found he was deaf in his\nright ear and supposed it was temporary. Least of his worries. Halloran\nhad taken a shot at him. The guard named Weltfisch had intercepted it.\nThe guard named Donnel had shot Halloran down.\n\nHe said to Donnel: \"You know Halloran long?\"\n\nDonnel, not taking his eyes from the crowd, said: \"Couple of years, sir.\nHe was just a guy in the bodyguard pool.\"\n\n\"Get me out of here,\" Orsino said. \"To the Syndic Building.\"\n\nIn the big black car, he could almost forget the horror; he could hope\nthat time would erase it completely. It wasn't like polo. That shot had\nbeen _aimed_.\n\nThe limousine purred to a halt before the titanic bulk of the Syndic\nBuilding, was checked and rolled on into the Unrestricted Entrance. An\nelevator silently lifted the car and passengers past floors devoted to\nAlcohol Clerical, Alcohol Research, and Testing, Transport, Collections\nAudit and Control, Cleaning and Dying, Female Recruitment and\nRetirement, up, up, up, past sections and sub-sections Charles had never\nentered, Syndic member though he was, to an automatic stop at a floor\nwhose indicator said: _enforcement and public relations_.\n\nIt was only 9:45 P.M.; F. W. Taylor would be in and working. Charles\nsaid: \"Wait here, boys,\" and muttered the code phrase to the door. It\nsprang open.\n\nF. W. Taylor was dictating, machine-gun fashion, to a mike. He looked\ndog-tired. His face turned up with a frown as Charles entered and then\nthe frown became a beam of pleasure.\n\n\"Charles, my boy! Sit down!\" He snapped off the machine.\n\n\"Uncle--\" Charles began.\n\n\"It was so kind of you to drop in. I thought you'd be at the theater.\"\n\n\"I was, Uncle, but--\"\n\n\"I'm working on a revision for the next edition of _Organization,\nSymbolism and Morale_. You'd never guess who inspired it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I wouldn't, Uncle. Uncle--\"\n\n\"Old Thornberry, President of the Chase National. He had the infernal\ngall to refuse a line of credit to young McGurn. _Bankers!_ You won't\nbelieve it, but people used to _beg_ them to take over their property,\ntie up their incomes, virtually enslave them. People _demanded_ it. The\nsame way they demanded inexpensive liquor, tobacco and consumer goods,\nclean women and a chance to win a fortune and our ancestors obliged\nthem. Our ancestors were sneered at in their day, you know. They were\ncalled criminals when they distributed goods and services at a price\npeople could afford to pay.\"\n\n\"Uncle!\"\n\n\"Hush, boy, I know what you're going to say. You can't fool the people\nforever! When they'd had enough hounding and restriction, they rose in\ntheir might.\n\n\"The people demanded freedom of choice, Falcaro and the rest rose to\nlead them in the Syndic and the Mob and they drove the Government into\nthe sea.\"\n\n\"Uncle Frank--\"\n\n\"From which it still occasionally ventures to annoy our coastal cities,\"\nF. W. Taylor commented. He warmed to his subject. \"You should have seen\nthe old boy blubber. The last of the old-time bankers, and they deserved\neverything they got. They brought it on themselves. They had what they\ncalled laissez-faire, and it worked for awhile until they got to\ntinkering with it. They demanded things called protective tariffs, tax\nremissions, subsidies--regulation, regulation, regulation, always of the\nother fellow. But there were enough bankers on all sides for everybody\nto be somebody else's other fellow. Coercion snowballed and the\nGovernment lost public acceptance. They had a thing called the public\ndebt which I can't begin to explain to you except to say that it was\nsomething written on paper and that it raised the cost of everything\ntremendously. Well, believe me or not, they _didn't_ just throw away the\npiece of paper or scratch out the writing on it. They let it ride until\nordinary people couldn't afford the pleasant things in life.\"\n\n\"Uncle--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA cautious periscope broke the choppy water off Sea Island, Georgia. At\nthe other end of the periscope were Captain Van Dellen of the North\nAmerican Navy, lean as a hound, and fat little Commander Grinnel.\n\n\"You might take her in a little closer, Van,\" said Grinnel mildly.\n\n\"The exercise won't do you any lasting damage,\" Van Dellen said. Grinnel\nwas very, very, near to a couple of admirals and normally Van Dellen\ngave him the kid-glove treatment in spite of ranking him. But this was\n_his_ ship and no cloak and dagger artist from an O.N.I. desk was\ntelling him how to con it.\n\nGrinnel smiled genially at the little joke. \"I could call it a\ndisguise,\" he said patting his paunch, \"but you know me too well.\"\n\n\"You'll have no trouble with a sea like this,\" Van Dellen said, strictly\nbusiness. He tried to think of some appropriate phrase to recognize the\ndanger Grinnel was plunging into with no resources except quick wits, a\ntrick ring and a pair of guns. But all that bubbled up to the top of his\nhead was; thank God I'm getting rid of this bastardly little Sociocrat.\nHe'll kill me some day if he gets a clean shot and the chance of\ndetection is zero. Thank God I'm a Constitutionist. We don't go in for\nthings like that--or do we? Nobody ever tells me anything. A hack of a\npigboat driver. And this little bastard's going to be an admiral some\nday. But that boy of mine'll be an admiral. He's brainy, like his\nmother.\n\nGrinnel smiled and said: \"Well, this would be it, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Van Dellen asked. \"Oh. I see what you mean. Chuck!\" he called a\nsailor. \"Break out the Commander's capsules. Pass the word to stand by\nfor ejection.\"\n\nThe Commander was fitted, puffing, into the capsule. He growled at the\nstorekeeper: \"You sure this was just unsealed? It feels sticky already.\"\n\nA brash jayee said: \"I saw it unsealed myself three minutes ago,\nCommander. It'll get stickier if we spend any more time talking. You\nhave\"--he glanced at his chronometer--\"seventeen minutes now. Let me\nsnap you in.\"\n\nThe Commander huddled down after a searching glance at the jayee's face\nwhich photographed it forever in his memory. The top snapped down. Some\nday--some happy day--that squirt would very much regret telling him off.\nHe gave an okay sign to Van Dellen who waved back meagerly and managed a\nsmile. Three crewmen fitted the capsule into its lock.\n\nFoomf!\n\nIt was through the hatch and bobbing on the surface. Its color matched\nthe water's automatically. Grinnel waggled the lever that aimed it\ninshore and began to turn the propellor crank. He turned fast; the\ncapsule--rudders, crank, flywheel, shaft and all--would dissolve in\napproximately fifteen minutes. It was his job to be ashore when that\nhappened.\n\nAnd ashore he'd be practically a free agent with the loosest sort of\nroving commission, until January 15th. Then his orders became most\nspecific.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nCharles Orsino squirmed in the chair. \"Uncle--\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Yes,\" F. W. Taylor chuckled, \"Old Amadeo and his colleagues were called\ncriminals. They were called bootleggers when they got liquor to people\nwithout worrying about the public debt or excise taxes. They were called\nsmugglers when they sold cheap butter in the south and cheap margerine\nin the north. They were called counterfeiters when they sold cheap\ncigarettes and transportation tickets. They were called high-jackers\nwhen they wrested goods from the normal inflation-ridden chain of\nmiddlemen and delivered them at a reasonable price to the consumers.\n\n\"They were criminals. Bankers were pillars of society.\n\n\"Yet these bankers who dominated society, who were considered the voice\nof eternal truth when they spoke, who thought it was insanity to\nchallenge their beliefs, started somewhere and perhaps they were the\nbest thing for their day and age that could be worked out....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFather Ambrosius gnawed at a bit of salt herring, wiped his hands, dug\nthrough the litter in his chest and found a goose quill and a page of\nparchment. He scrubbed vigorously with a vinegar-soaked sponge, at the\nwriting on the parchment and was pleased to see that it came off nicely,\nleaving him a clean surface to scribble his sermon notes on. He cut the\nquill and slit it while waiting for the parchment to dry, wondering idly\nwhat he had erased. (It happened to be the last surviving copy of\nTacitus' _Annals_, VII. i-v.)\n\nTo work then. The sermon was to be preached on Sexagesima Sunday, a\nprelude to the solemn season of Lent. Father Ambrosius' mind wandered in\nsearch of a text. Lent ... salt herring ... penitence ... the capital\nsins ... avarice ... usury ... delinquent pew rent ... fat-headed young\nSir Baldwin in his tumbledown castle on the hill ... salt herring now\nand _per saeculae saeculorum_ unless Sir Baldwin paid up his delinquent\npew rent.\n\nAt the moment, Sir Baldwin came swaggering into the cell. Father\nAmbrosius rose courteously and said, with some insincerity: \"_Pax\nvobiscum._\"\n\n\"Eh?\" asked Sir Baldwin, his silly blue eyes popping as he looked over\nhis shoulder. \"Oh, you meant me, padre. It don't do a bit of good to\nchatter at me in Latin, you know. The king's Norman is what I speak. I\nmean to say, if it's good enough for his majesty Richard, it's good\nenough for me, what? Now, what can I do for you, padre?\"\n\nFather Ambrosius reminded him faintly: \"You came to see me, Sir\nBaldwin.\"\n\n\"Eh? Oh. So I did. I was huntin' stag, padre, and I lost him after\nchasin' the whole morning, and what I want to know is, who's the right\nsaint chap to ask for help in a pickle like that? I mean to say, I\nwanted to show the chaps some good sport and we started this beast and\nhe got clean away. Don't misunderstand me, padre, they were good chaps\nand they didn't rot me about it, but that kind of talk gets about and\ndoesn't do one a bit of good, what? So you tell me like a good fellow\nwho's the right saint chap to put the matter in the best light for me?\"\n\nFather Ambrosius repressed an urge to grind his teeth, took thought and\nsaid: \"St. Hubert, I believe, is interested in the stag hunt.\"\n\n\"Right-oh, padre! St. Hubert it is. Hubert, Hubert. I shan't forget it\nbecause I've a cousin named Hubert. Haven't seen him for years, poor old\nchap. He had the fistula--lived on slops and couldn't sit his horse for\na day's huntin'. Poor old chap. Well, I'm off--no, there's another thing\nI wanted. Suppose this Sunday you preach a howlin' strong sermon against\nusury, what? That chap in the village, the goldsmith fellow, has the\ninfernal gall to tell me I've got to give him Fallowfield! Forty acres,\nand he has the infernal gall to tell me they aren't mine any more. Be a\ngood chap, padre, and sort of glare at him from the pulpit a few times\nto show him who you mean, what?\"\n\n\"Usury _is_ a sin,\" Father Ambrosius said cautiously, \"but how does\nFallowfield enter into it?\"\n\nSir Baldwin twiddled the drooping ends of his limp, blond mustache with\na trace of embarrassment. \"Fact is, I told the chap when I borrowed the\ntwenty marks that Fallowfield would stand as security. I ask you, padre,\nis it my fault that my tenants are a pack of lazy, thieving Saxon swine\nand I couldn't raise the money?\"\n\nThe parish priest bristled unnoticeably. He was pure Saxon himself. \"I\nshall do what I can,\" he said. \"And Sir Baldwin, before you go--\"\n\nThe young man stopped in the doorway and turned.\n\n\"Before you go, may I ask when we'll see your pew rent, to say nothing\nof the tithe?\"\n\nSir Baldwin dismissed it with an airish wave of the hand. \"I thought I\njust told you, padre. I haven't a farthing to my name and here's this\nchap in the village telling me to clear out of Fallowfield that I got\nfrom my father and his father before him. So how the devil--excuse\nme--can I pay rent and tithes and Peters pence and all the other things\nyou priest chaps expect from a man, what?\" He held up his gauntleted\nhand as Father Ambrosius started to speak. \"No, padre, not another word\nabout it. I know you'd love to tell me I won't go to heaven if I act\nthis way. I don't doubt you're learned and all that, but I can still\ntell you a thing or two, what? The fact is, I _will_ go to Heaven. You\nsee, padre, God's a gentleman and he wouldn't bar another gentleman over\na trifle of money trouble that could happen to any gentleman, now would\nhe?\"\n\nThe fatuous beam was more than Father Ambrosius could bear; his eyes\nfell.\n\n\"Right-oh,\" Sir Baldwin chirped. \"And that saint chap's name was St.\nHubert. I didn't forget, see? Not quite the fool some people think I\nam.\" And he was gone, whistling a recheat.\n\nFather Ambrosius sat down again and glared at the parchment. Preach a\nsermon on usury for that popinjay. Well, usury _was_ a sin. Christians\nwere supposed to lend to one another in need and not count the cost or\nthe days. But who had ever heard of Sir Baldwin ever lending anything?\nOf course, he was lord of the manor and protected you against invasion,\nbut there didn't seem to be any invasions anymore....\n\nWearily, the parish priest dipped his pen and scratched on the\nparchment: RON. XIII ii, viii, XV i. \"Whosoever resisteth the power\nresisteth the ordinance of God ... owe no man any thing ... we that are\nstrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak....\" A triple-plated\ntext, which, reinforced by a brow of thunder from the pulpit should make\nthe village goldsmith think twice before pressing his demand on Sir\nBaldwin. Usury _was_ a sin.\n\nThere was a different knock on the door frame.\n\nThe goldsmith, a leather-aproned fellow named John, stood there twisting\nhis cap in his big, burn scarred hands.\n\n\"Yes, my son? Come in.\" But he scowled at the fellow involuntarily. He\nshould know better than to succumb to the capital sin of avarice. \"Well,\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\"Father,\" the fellow said, \"I've come to give you this.\" He passed a\nsoft leather purse to the priest. It clinked.\n\nFather Ambrosius emptied it on his desk and stirred the broad silver\ncoins wonderingly with his finger. Five marks and eleven silver pennies.\nNo more salt herring until Lent! Silver forwarded to his bishop in an\namount that would do credit to the parish! A gilding job for the image\nof the Blessed Virgin! Perhaps glass panes in one or two of the church\nwindows!\n\nAnd then he stiffened and swept the money back into the purse. \"You got\nthis by sin,\" he said flatly. \"The sin of avarice worked in your heart\nand you practiced the sin of usury on your fellow Christians. Don't give\nthis money to the Church; give it back to your victims.\"\n\n\"Father,\" the fellow said, nearly blubbering, \"excuse me but you don't\nunderstand! They come to me and come to me. They say it's all right with\nthem, that they're hiring the money the way you'd hire a horse. Doesn't\nthat make sense? Do you think I _wanted_ to become a moneylender? No! I\nwas an honest goldsmith and an honest goldsmith can't help himself. All\nthe money in the village drifts somehow into his hands. One leaves a\nmark with you for safekeeping and pays you a penny the year to guard it.\nAnother brings you silver coins to make into a basin, and you get to\nkeep whatever coins are left over. And then others come to you and say\n'Let me have soandso's mark to use for a year and then I'll pay it back\nand with it another mark'. Father, they beg me! They say they'll be\nruined if I don't lend to them, their old parents will die if they can't\nfee the leech, or their dead will roast forever unless they can pay for\nmasses and what's a man to _do_?\"\n\n\"Sin no more,\" the priest answered simply. It was no problem.\n\nThe fellow was getting angry. \"Very well for you to sit there and say\nso, father. But what do you think paid for the masses you said for the\nrepose of Goodie Howat's soul? And how did Tom the Thatcher buy his\nwagon so he could sell his beer in Glastonbury at a better price? And\nhow did Farmer Major hire the men from Wealing to get in his hay before\nthe great storm could ruin it? And a hundred things more. I tell you,\nthis parish would be a worse place without John Goldsmith and he doesn't\npropose to be pointed at any longer as a black sinner! I didn't want to\nfall into usury but I did, and _when_ I did, I found out that those who\nhoist their noses highest at the moneylender when they pass him in the\nroad are the same ones who beg the hardest when they come to his shop\nfor a loan!\"\n\nThe priest was stunned by the outburst. John seemed honest, the facts\nwere the facts--can good come out of evil? And there were stories that\nHis Holiness the Pope himself had certain dealings with the\nLongobards--benchers, or bankers or whatever they called themselves....\n\n\"I must think on this, my son,\" he said. \"Perhaps I was over hasty.\nPerhaps in the days of St. Paul usury was another thing entirely.\nPerhaps what you practice is not _really_ usury but merely something\nthat resembles it. You may leave this silver with me.\"\n\nWhen John left, Father Ambrosius squeezed his eyes tight shut and\npressed the knuckles of both hands to his forehead. Things _did_ change.\nUnder the dispensation of the Old Testament, men had more wives than\none. That was sinful now, but surely Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were in\nheaven? Paul wrote his epistles to little islands of Christians\nsurrounded by seas of pagans. Surely in those days it was necessary for\nChristians to be bound closely together against the common enemy,\nwhereas in these modern times, the ties could be safely relaxed a\ntrifle? How could sinning have paid for the repose of Goodie Howat's\nsoul, got a better price for brewer Thatcher's ale and saved the village\nhay crop? The Devil was tricky, but not _that_ tricky, surely. A few\nmore such tricks and the parish would resemble the paradise terrestrial!\n\nFather Ambrosius dashed from his study to the altar of the little stone\nchurch and began furiously to turn the pages of the huge metal-bound\nlectern Bible.\n\n\"_For the love of money is the root of all evil--_\"\n\nIt burst on Father Ambrosius with a great light that the words of Paul\nwere in reference not to _John Goldsmith's_ love of money but to _Sir\nBaldwin's_ love of money.\n\nHe dashed back to his study and his pen began to squeak over the\nparchment, obliterating the last dim trace of Tacitus' _Annals_, VIII\ni.v. The sermon would be a scorcher, all right, but it wouldn't scorch\nJohn Goldsmith. It would scorch Sir Baldwin for ruthlessly and against\nthe laws of God and man refusing to turn Fallowfield over to the\nmoneylender. There would be growls of approval in the church that\nSunday, and many black looks directed against Sir Baldwin for his\nattempt to bilk the parish's friend and benefactor, the moneylender.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And that,\" F. W. Taylor concluded, chuckling, \"is how power passes from\none pair of hands to another, and how public acceptance of the change\nfollows on its heels. A strange thing--people always think that each\nexchange of power is the last that will ever take place.\"\n\nHe seemed to be finished.\n\n\"Uncle,\" Orsino said, \"somebody tried to kill me.\"\n\nTaylor stared at him for a long minute, speechless. \"What happened?\" he\nfinally asked.\n\n\"I went formal to the theater, with five bodyguards. The chief guard,\nname of Halloran, took a shot at me. One of my boys got in the way. He\nwas killed.\"\n\nTaylor's fingers began to play a tattoo on his annunciator board. Faces\nleaped into existence on its various screens as he fired orders.\n\"Charles Orsino's chief bodyguard for tonight--Halloran. Trace him. The\nworks. He tried to kill Orsino.\"\n\nHe clicked off the board switches and turned grimly to Orsino. \"Now\nyou,\" he said. \"What have _you_ been up to?\"\n\n\"Just doing my job, uncle,\" Orsino said uneasily.\n\n\"Still bagman at the 101st?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Fooling with any women?\"\n\n\"Nothing special, uncle. Nothing intense.\"\n\n\"Disciplined or downgraded anybody lately?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. The precinct runs like a watch. I'll match their morale\nagainst any outfit east of the Mississippi. Why are you taking this so\nheavy?\"\n\n\"Because you're the third. The other two--your cousin Thomas McGurn and\nyour uncle Robert Orsino--didn't have guards to get in the way. One\nother question.\"\n\n\"Yes, uncle.\"\n\n\"My boy, _why_ didn't you tell me about this when you first came in?\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nA family council was called the next day. Orsino, very much a junior,\nhad never been admitted to one before. He knew why the exception was\nbeing made, and didn't like the reason.\n\nEdward Falcaro wagged his formidable white beard at the thirty-odd\nSyndic chiefs around the table and growled: \"I think we'll dispense with\nreviewing production and so on. I want to talk about this damn gunplay.\nDick, bring us up to date.\"\n\nHe lit a vile cigar and leaned back.\n\nRichard W. Reiner rose.\n\n\"Thomas McGurn,\" he said, \"killed April 15th by a burst of eight machine\ngun bullets in his private dining room at the Astor. Elsie Warshofsky,\nhis waitress, must be considered the principal suspect, but--\"\n\nEdward Falcaro snapped: \"Suspect, hell! She killed him, didn't she?\"\n\n\"_I was about to say_, but the evidence so far is merely cumulative.\nMrs. Warshofsky jumped--fell--or was pushed--from the dining room\nwindow. The machine gun was found beside the window.\n\n\"There are no known witnesses. Mrs. Warshofsky's history presents no\nunusual features. An acquaintance submitted a statement--based, she\nfrankly admitted, on nothing definite--that Mrs. Warshofsky sometimes\ntalked in a way that led her to wonder if she might not be a member of\nthe secret terrorist organization known as the D.A.R. In this\nconnection, it should be noted that Mrs. Warshofsky's maiden name was\nAdams.\n\n\"Robert Orsino, killed April 21st by a thermite bomb concealed in his\npillow and fuzed with a pressure-sensitive switch. His valet, Edward\nBlythe, disappeared from view. He was picked up April 23rd by a posse on\nthe beach of Montauk Point, but died before he could be questioned.\nExamination of his stomach contents showed a lethal quantity of sodium\nfluoride. It is presumed that the poison was self-administered.\"\n\n\"Presumed!\" the old man snorted, and puffed out a lethal quantity of\ncigar smoke.\n\n\"Blythe's history,\" Reiner went on blandly, \"presents no unusual\nfeatures. It should be noted that a commerce-raider of the so-called\nUnited States Government Navy was reported off Montauk Point during the\nnight of April 23rd-24th by local residents.\n\n\"Charles Orsino, attacked April 30th by his bodyguard James Halloran in\nthe lobby of the Costello Memorial Theater. Halloran fired one shot\nwhich killed another bodyguard and was then himself killed. Halloran's\nhistory presents no unusual features except that he had a considerable\ninterest in--uh--history. He collected and presumably read obsolete\nbooks dealing with pre-Syndic Pre-Mob America. Investigators found by\nhis bedside the first volume of a work published in 1942 called _The\nGrowth of The American Republic_ by Morison and Commager. It was opened\nto Chapter Ten, The War of Independence!\"\n\nReiner took his seat.\n\nF. W. Taylor said dryly: \"Dick, did you forget to mention that\nWarshofsky, Blythe and Halloran are known officers of the U. S. Navy?\"\n\nReiner said: \"You are being facetious. Are you implying that I have\nomitted pertinent facts?\"\n\n\"I'm implying that you artistically stacked the deck. With a rumor, a\ndubious commerce-raider report and a note on a man's hobby, you want us\nto sweep the bastards from the sea, don't you--just the way you always\nhave?\"\n\n\"I am not ashamed of my expressed attitude on the question of the\nso-called United States Government and will defend it at any proper time\nand place.\"\n\n\"Shut the hell up, you two,\" Edward Falcaro growled. \"I'm trying to\nthink.\" He thought for perhaps half a minute and then looked up,\nbaffled. \"Has anybody got any ideas?\"\n\nCharles Orsino cleared his throat, amazed at his own temerity. The old\nman's eyebrows shot up, but he grudgingly said: \"I guess you can say\nsomething, since they thought you were important enough to shoot.\"\n\nOrsino said: \"Maybe it's some outfit over in Europe or Asia?\"\n\nEdward Falcaro asked: \"Anybody know anything about Europe or Asia?\nJimmy, you flew over once, didn't you? To see about Anatolian poppies\nwhen the Mob had trouble with Mex labor?\"\n\nJimmy Falcaro said creakily: \"Yeah. It was a waste of time. They have\nthese little dirt farmers scratching out just enough food for the family\nand maybe raising a quarter-acre of poppy. That's _all_ there is from\nthe China Sea to the Mediterranean. In England--Frank, you tell 'em. You\nexplained it to me once.\"\n\nTaylor rose. \"The forest's come back to England. When finance there lost\nits morale and couldn't hack its way out of the paradoxes that was the\nend. When that happens you've got to have a large, virile criminal class\nready to take over and do the work of distribution and production. Maybe\nsome of you know how the English were. The poor beggars had civilized\nall the illegality out of the stock. They couldn't do anything that\nwasn't respectable. From sketchy reports, I gather that England is now\nforest and a few hundred starving people. One fellow says the men still\nwear derbies and stagger to their offices in the city.\n\n\"France is peasants, drunk three-quarters of the time.\n\n\"Russia is peasants, drunk _all_ the time.\n\n\"Germany--well, there the criminal class was _too_ big and _too_ virile.\nThe place is a cemetery.\"\n\nHe shrugged: \"Say it, somebody. The Mob's gunning for us.\"\n\nReiner jumped to his feet. \"I will _never_ support such a hypothesis!\"\nhe shrilled. \"It is _mischievous_ to imply that a century of peace has\nbeen ended, that our three-thousand-mile border with our friend to the\nWest--\"\n\nTaylor intoned satirically: \"_Un_-blemished, my friends, by a _single_\nfor-ti-fi-_ca_-tion--\"\n\nEdward Falcaro yelled: \"Stop your damn foolishness, Frank Taylor! This\nis no laughing matter.\"\n\nTaylor snapped: \"Have you been in Mob Territory lately?\"\n\n\"I have,\" the old man said. He scowled.\n\n\"How'd you like it?\"\n\nEdward Falcaro shrugged irritably. \"They have their ways, we have ours.\nThe Regan line is running thin, but we're not going to forget that Jimmy\nRegan stood shoulder to shoulder with Amadeo Falcaro in the old days.\nThere's such a thing as loyalty.\"\n\nF. W. Taylor said: \"There's such a thing as blindness.\"\n\nHe had gone too far. Edward Falcaro rose from his chair and leaned\nforward, bracing himself on the table. He said flatly: \"This is a\nstatement, gentlemen. I won't pretend I'm happy about the way things are\nin Mob Territory. I won't pretend I think old man Regan is a balanced,\ndependable person. I won't pretend I think the Mob clients are enjoying\nanywhere near the service that Syndic clients enjoy. I'm perfectly aware\nthat on our visits of state to Mob Territory we see pretty much what our\nhosts want us to see. But I cannot believe that any group which is\nrooted on the principles of freedom and service can have gone very\nwrong.\n\n\"Maybe I'm mistaken, gentlemen. But I cannot believe that a descendant\nof Jimmy Regan would order a descendant of Amadeo Falcaro murdered. We\nwill consider every other possibility first. Frank, is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"All right,\" Edward Falcaro grunted. \"Now let's go about this thing\nsystematically. Dick, you go right down the line with the charge that\nthe Government's responsible for these atrocities. I hate to think that\nmyself. If they are, we're going to have to spend a lot of time and\ntrouble hunting them down and doing something about it. As long as they\nstick to a little commerce-raiding and a few coastal attacks, I can't\nsay I'm really unhappy about them. They don't do much harm, and they\nkeep us on our toes and--maybe this one is most important--they keep our\nclient's memories of the bad old days that we delivered them from alive.\nThat's a great deal to surrender for the doubtful pleasures of a long,\nexpensive campaign. If assassination's in the picture I suppose we'll\nhave to knock them off--but we've got to be _sure_.\"\n\n\"May I speak?\" Reiner asked icily.\n\nThe old man nodded and re-lit his cigar.\n\n\"I have been called--behind my back, naturally--a fanatic,\" Reiner\nsaid. He pointedly did not look anywhere near F. W. Taylor as he spoke\nthe word. \"Perhaps this is correct and perhaps fanaticism is what's\nneeded at a time like this. Let me point out what the so-called\nGovernment stands for: brutal 'taxation,' extirpation of gambling,\ndenial of life's simple pleasures to the poor and severe limitation of\nthem to all but the wealthy, sexual prudery viciously enforced by penal\nlaws of appalling barbarity, endless regulation and coercion governing\nevery waking minute of the day. That was its record during the days of\nits power and that would be its record if it returned to power. I fail\nto see how this menace to our liberty can be condoned by certain\nmarginal benefits which are claimed to accrue from its continued\nexistence.\" He faltered for a moment as his face twisted with an\nunpleasant memory. In a lower, unhappier voice, he went on: \"I--I was\nalarmed the other day by something I overheard. Two small children were\nlaying bets at the Kiddy Counter of the horse room I frequent, and I\nstopped on my way to the hundred-dollar window for a moment to hear\ntheir childish prattle. They were doping the forms for the sixth at\nHialeah, I believe, when one of them digressed to say: 'My Mommy doesn't\nplay the horses. She thinks all the horse rooms should be closed.'\n\n\"It wrung my heart, gentlemen, to hear that. I wanted to take that\nlittle boy aside and tell him: 'Son, your Mommy doesn't have to play the\nhorses. Nobody has to play the horses unless he wants to. But as long as\none single person wants to lay a bet on a horse and another person is\nwilling to take it, nobody has the right to say the horse rooms should\nbe closed.' Naturally I did not take the little boy aside and tell him\nthat. It would have been an impractical approach to the problem. The\n_practical_ approach is the one I have always advocated and still do.\nStrike at the heart of the infection! Destroy the remnants of Government\nand cauterize the wound so that it will never re-infect again. Nor is my\nlanguage too strong. When I realize that the mind of an innocent child\nhas been corrupted so that he will prattle that the liberties of his\nbrothers must be infringed on, that their harmless pleasures must be\ncurtailed, my blood runs cold and I call it what it is: _treason_.\"\n\nOrsino had listened raptly to the words and joined in a burst of\nspontaneous applause that swept around the table. He had never had a\nbrush with Government himself and he hardly believed in the existence of\nthe shadowy, terrorist D.A.R., but Reiner had made it sound so near and\nmenacing!\n\nBut Uncle Frank was on his feet. \"We seem to have strayed from the\npoint,\" he said dryly. \"For anybody who needs his memory refreshed, I'll\nstate that the point is two assassinations and one near miss. I fail to\nsee the connection, if any with Dick Reiner's paranoid delusions of\npersecution. I especially fail to see the relevance of the word\n'treason.' Treason to what--us? The Syndic is not a government. It must\nnot become enmeshed in the symbols and folklore of a government or it\nwill be first chained and then strangled by them. The Syndic is an\norganization of high morale and easy-going, hedonistic personality. The\nfact that it succeeded the Government occurred because the Government\nhad become an organization of low morale and inflexible, puritanic,\nsado-masochistic personality. I have no illusions about the Syndic\nlasting forever, and I hope nobody else here has. Naturally I want it to\nlast our lifetime, my children's lifetime, and as long after that as I\ncan visualize my descendants, but don't think I have any burning\naffection for my unborn great-great grandchildren. Now, if there is\nanybody here who doesn't want it to last that long, I suggest to him\nthat the quickest way to demoralize the Syndic is to adopt Dick Reiner's\nproposal of a holy war for a starter. From there we can proceed to an\ninternal heresy hunt, a census, excise taxes, income taxes and wars of\naggression. Now, what about getting back to the assassinations?\"\n\nOrsino shook his head, thoroughly confused by now. But the confusion\nvanished as a girl entered the room, whispered something in the ear of\nEdward Falcaro and sat down calmly by his side. He wasn't the only one\nwho noticed her. Most of the faces there registered surprise and some\nindignation. The Syndic had a very strong tradition of masculinity.\n\nEdward Falcaro ignored the surprise and indignation. He said placidly:\n\"That was very interesting, Frank, what I understood of it. But it's\nalways interesting when I go ahead and do something because it's the\nsmart thing to do, and then listen to you explain my reasons--including\nfifty or sixty that I'm more than positive never crossed my mind.\"\n\nThere was a laugh around the table that Charles Orsino thought was\nunfair. He knew, Edward Falcaro knew, and everybody knew that Taylor\ncredited Falcaro with sound intuitive judgment rather than analytic\npower. He supposed the old man--intuitively--had decided a laugh was\nneeded to clear the air of the quarrel and irrelevance.\n\nFalcaro went on: \"The way things stand now, gentlemen, we don't know\nvery much, do we?\" He bit a fresh cigar and lighted it meditatively.\nFrom a cloud of rank smoke he said: \"So the thing to do is find out\nmore, isn't it?\" In spite of the beard and the cigar, there was\nsomething of a sly, teasing child about him. \"So what do you say to\nslipping one of our own people into the Government to find out whether\nthey're dealing in assassination or not?\"\n\nCharles Orsino alone was naive enough to speak; the rest knew that the\nold man had something up his sleeve. Charles said: \"You can't do it,\nsir! They have lie-detectors and drugs and all sorts of things--\" His\nvoice died down miserably under Falcaro's too-benign smile and the looks\nof irritation verging on disgust from the rest. The enigmatic girl\nscowled. _Goddam them all!_ Charles thought, sinking into his chair and\nwishing he could sink into the earth.\n\n\"The young man,\" Falcaro said blandly, \"speaks the truth--no less true\nfor being somewhat familiar to us all. But what if we have a way to get\naround the drugs and lie-detectors, gentlemen? Which of you bold fellows\nwould march into the jaws of death by joining the Government, spying on\nthem and trying to report back?\"\n\nCharles stood up, prudence and timidity washed away by a burning need to\nmake up for his embarrassment with a grandstand play. \"I'll go, sir,\" he\nsaid very calmly. _And if I get killed that'll show 'em; then they'll be\nsorry._\n\n\"Good boy,\" Edward Falcaro said briskly, with a well-that's that air.\n\"The young lady here will take care of you.\"\n\nCharles steadily walked down the long room to the head of the table,\nthinking that he must be cutting a rather fine figure. Uncle Frank\nruined his exit by catching his sleeve and halting him as he passed his\nseat. \"Good luck, Charles,\" Uncle Frank whispered. \"And for Heaven's\nsake, keep a better guard up. Can't you see the old devil planned it\nthis way from the beginning?\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Uncle Frank,\" Charles said, suddenly feeling quite sick as he\nwalked on. The young lady rose and opened the door for him. She was\ngraceful as a cat, and a conviction overcame Charles Orsino that he was\nthe canary.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nMax Wyman shoved his way through such a roar of voices and such a crush\nof bodies as he had never known before. Scratch Sheet Square was bright\nas day--brighter. Atomic lamps, mounted on hundred-story buildings hosed\nand squirted the happy mob with blue-white glare. The Scratch Sheet's\nmoving sign was saying in fiery letters seventy-five feet tall: \"_11:58\nPM EST ... December 31st ... Cops say two million jam NYC streets to\ngreet New Year ... 11:59 PM EST ... December 31st ... Falcaro jokes on\nTV 'Never thought we'd make it' ... 12:00 midnight January 1st ... Happy\nNew Year ..._\"\n\nThe roar of voices had become insane. Max Wyman held his head, hating\nit, hating them all, trying to shut them out. Half a dozen young men\nagainst whom he was jammed were tearing the clothes off a girl. They\nwere laughing and she was too, making only a pretense of defending\nherself. It was one of New York's mild winter nights. Wyman looked at\nthe white skin not knowing that his eyes gloated. He yelled curses at\nher, and the young men. But nobody heard his whiskey-hoarsened young\nvoice.\n\nSomebody thrust a bottle at him and made mouths, trying to yell: \"Happy\nNew Year!\" He grabbed feverishly at the bottle and held it to his mouth,\nletting the liquor gurgle once, twice, three times. Then the bottle was\nsnatched away, not by the man who had passed it to him. A hilarious fat\nwoman plastered herself against Wyman and kissed him clingingly on the\nmouth, to his horror and disgust. She was torn away from him by a\nlaughing, white-haired man and turned willingly to kissing him instead.\n\nTwo strapping girls jockeyed Wyman between them and began to tear _his_\nclothes off, laughing at their switcheroo on the year's big gag. He\nclawed out at them hysterically and they stopped, the laughter dying on\ntheir lips as they saw his look of terrified rage. A sudden current in\nthe crowd parted Wyman from them; another bottle bobbed on the sea of\nhumanity. He clutched at it and this time did not drink. He stuffed it\nhurriedly under the waistband of his shorts and kept a hand on it as the\neddy of humanity bore him on to the fringes of the roaring mob.\n\n\"_Syndic leaders hail New Year ... Taylor praises Century of Freedom ...\n12:05 AM EST January 1st ..._\"\n\nWyman was mashed up against a girl who first smiled at his young face\ninvitingly ... and then looked again. \"Get away from me!\" she shrieked,\npounding on his chest with her small fists. You could hear individual\nvoices now, but the crowd was still dense. She kept screaming at him and\nhitting him until suddenly Scratch Sheet Square Upramp loomed and the\ncrowd fizzed onto it like uncorked champagne, Wyman and the screaming\ngirl carried along the moving plates underfoot. The crowd boiled onto\nthe northbound strip, relieving the crush; the girl vanished,\nwhimpering, into the mob.\n\nWyman, rubbing his ear mechanically, shuffled with downcast eyes to the\nEastbound ramp and collapsed onto a bench gliding by at five miles per\nhour. He looked stupidly at the ten-mile and fifteen-mile strips, but\ndid not dare step onto them. He had been drinking steadily for a month.\nHe would fall and the bottle would break.\n\nHe lurched off the five-mile strip at Riverside Downramp. Nobody got off\nwith him. Riverside was a tangle of freightways over, under and on the\nsurface. He worked there.\n\nWyman picked his way past throbbing conveyors roofed against pilferage,\nunder gurgling fuel and water and waste pipes, around vast metal\nwarehouses and storage tanks. It was not dark or idle in Riverside.\nTwenty-four hours was little enough time to bring Manhattan its daily\nneeds and carry off its daily waste and manufactures. Under daylight\natomics the transport engineers in their glass perches read the dials\nand turned the switches. Breakdown crews scurried out from emergency\nstations as bells clanged to replace a sagging plate, remag a failing\nehrenhafter, unplug a jam of nylon bales at a too-sharp corner.\n\nHe found Breakdown Station 26, hitched his jacket over the bottle and\nswayed in, drunk enough to think he could pretend he was sober. \"Hi,\" he\nsaid hoarsely to the shift foreman. \"Got jammed up in the celebration.\"\n\n\"We heard it clear over here,\" the foreman said, looking at him closely.\n\"Are you all right, Max?\"\n\nThe question enraged him. \"'Smatter?\" he yelled. \"Had a couple, sure.\nThink 'm drunk? Tha' wha' ya think?\"\n\n\"Gee,\" the foreman said wearily. \"Look, Max, I can't send you out\ntonight. You might get killed. I'm trying to be reasonable and I wish\nyou'd do as much for me. What's biting you, boy? Nobody has anything\nagainst a few drinks and a few laughs. I went on a bender last month\nmyself. But you get so Goddammed _mean_ I can't stand you and neither\ncan anybody else.\"\n\nWyman spewed obscenity at him and tried to swing on him. He was\nsurprised and filled with self-pity when somebody caught his arm and\nsomebody else caught his other arm. It was Dooley and Weintraub, his\nshift-mates, looking unhappy and concerned.\n\n\"Lousy rats!\" Wyman choked out. \"Leas' a man's buddies c'd do is back'm\nup....\" He began to cry, hating them, and then fell asleep on his feet.\nDooley and Weintraub eased him down onto the floor.\n\nThe foreman mopped his head and appealed to Dooley: \"He always like\nthis?\" He had been transferred to Station 26 only two weeks before.\n\nDooley shrugged. \"You might say so. He showed up about three months ago.\nSaid he used to be a breakdown man in Buffalo, on the yards. He knew the\nwork all right. But I never saw such a mean kid. Never a good word for\nanybody. Never any fun. Booze, booze, booze. This time he really let\ngo.\"\n\nWeintraub said unexpectedly: \"I think he's what they used to call an\nalcoholic.\"\n\n\"What the hell's that?\" the foreman demanded.\n\n\"I read about it. It's something they used to have before the Syndic. I\nread about it. Things were a lot different then. People picking on you\nall the time, everybody mad all the time. The girls were scared to give\nit away and the boys were scared to take it--but they did anyway and it\nwas kind of like fighting with yourself _inside_ yourself. The fighting\nwore some people out so much they just couldn't take it any more.\nInstead of going on benders for a change of pace like sensible people,\nthey boozed _all_ the time--and they had a fight inside themselves\nabout _that_ so they boozed harder.\" He looked defensive at their\nskeptical faces. \"I _read_ it,\" he insisted.\n\n\"Well,\" the foreman said inconclusively, \"I heard things used to be\npretty bad. Did these alcoholers get over it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Weintraub admitted. \"I didn't read that far.\"\n\n\"Hm. I think I'd better can him.\" The foreman was studying their faces\ncovertly, hoping to read a reaction. He did. Both the men looked\nrelieved. \"Yeh. I think I'd better can him. He can go to the Syndic for\nrelief if he has to. He doesn't do us much good here. Put some soup on\nand get it down him when he wakes up.\" The foreman, an average kindly\nman, hoped the soup would help.\n\nBut at about three-thirty, after two trouble calls in succession, they\nnoticed that Wyman had left leaving no word.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fat little man struggled out of the New Year's eve throng; he had\nbeen caught by accident. Commander Grinnel did not go in for\ncelebrations. When he realized that January fifteenth was now fifteen\ndays away, he doubted that he would ever celebrate again. It was a\ntwo-man job he had to do on the fifteenth, and so far he had not found\nthe other man.\n\nHe rode the slidewalk to Columbus Square. He had been supplied with a\nminimum list of contacts. One had moved, and in the crazily\nundisciplined Syndic Territory it was impossible to trace anybody.\nAnother had died--of too much morphine. Another had beaten her husband\nalmost to death with a chair leg and was in custody awaiting trial. The\nCommander wondered briefly and querulously: why do we always have such\nunstable people here? Or does that louse Emory deliberately saddle me\nwith them when I'm on a mission? Wouldn't put it past him.\n\nThe final contact on the list was a woman. She'd be worthless for the\nbusiness of January fifteenth; that called for some physical strength,\nsome technical knowledge, and a residual usefulness to the Government.\nProfessor Speiser had done some good work here on industrial sabotage,\nbut taken away from the scene of possible operations, she'd just be a\nmillstone. He had his record to think of.\n\nSabotage--\n\nIf a giggling threesome hadn't been looking his way from a bench across\nthe slidewalk, he would have ground his teeth. In recent weeks, he had\ndone what he estimated as an easy three million dollars worth of damage\nto Mob Territory industry. And the stupid fools hadn't _noticed_ it!\nRepair crews had rebuilt the fallen walls, mechanics had tut-tutted over\nthe wrecked engines and replaced them, troubleshooters had troubleshot\nthe scores of severed communications lines and fuel mains.\n\nHe had hung around.\n\n\"Sam, you see this? Melted through, like with a little thermite bomb.\nHow in the hell did a thing like that happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I wasn't here. Let's get it fixed kid.\"\n\n\"Okay ... you think we ought to report this to somebody?\"\n\n\"If you want to. I'll mention it to Larry. But I don't see what he can\ndo about it. Must've been some kids. You gotta put it down as fair wear\nand tear. But boys will be boys.\"\n\nRemembering, he did grind his teeth. But they were at Columbus Square.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Speiser lived in one of the old plastic brick faculty houses.\nHer horsy face, under a curling net, looked out of the annunciator\nplate. \"Yes? What is it?\"\n\n\"Professor Speiser, I believe you know my daughter, Miss _Freeman_. She\nasked me to look you up while I was in New York. Have I come much too\nlate?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear. Why, no. I suppose not. Come in, Mr.--Mr. Freeman.\"\n\nIn her parlor, she faced him apprehensively. When she spoke she rolled\nout her sentences like the lecturer she was. \"Mr. Freeman--as I suppose\nyou'd prefer me to call you--you asked a moment ago whether you'd come\ntoo late. I realize that the question was window-dressing, but my answer\nis quite serious. You have come too late. I have decided to dissociate\nmyself from--let us say, from your daughter, Miss Freeman.\"\n\nThe Commander asked only: \"Is that irrevocable?\"\n\n\"Quite. It wouldn't be fair of me to ask you to leave without an\nexplanation. I am perfectly willing to give one. I realize now that my\nfriendship with Miss Freeman and the work I did for her stemmed from,\nlet us say a certain vacancy in my life.\"\n\nHe looked at a picture on her desk of a bald, pleasant-faced fellow with\na pipe.\n\nShe followed his eyes and said with a sort of shy pride: \"That is Dr.\nMordecai, of the University's Faculty of Dentistry. Like myself, a\nlong-time celibate. We plan to marry.\"\n\nThe Commander said: \"Do you feel that Dr. Mordecai might like to meet my\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"No. I do not. We expect to have very little time for outside\nactivities, between our professional careers and our personal lives.\nPlease don't misunderstand, Mr. Freeman. I am still your daughter's\nfriend. I always shall be. But somehow I no longer find in myself an\nurgency to express the friendship. It seems like a beautiful dream--and\na quite futile one. I have come to realize that one can live a full life\nwithout Miss Freeman. Now, it's getting quite late--\"\n\nHe smiled ruefully and rose. \"May I wish you every happiness, Professor\nSpeiser?\" he said, extending his hand.\n\nShe beamed with relief. \"I was so afraid you'd--\"\n\nHer face went limp and she stood swaying drunkenly as the needle in the\nring popped her skin.\n\nThe Commander, his face as dead as hers, disconnected his hand and\nsheathed the needle carefully again. He drew one of his guns, shot her\nthrough the heart and walked out of the apartment.\n\nOld fool! She should have known better.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMax Wyman stumbled through the tangle of Riveredge, his head a pot of\nmolten lead and his legs twitching under him as he fled from his shame.\n\nDimly, as if with new eyes, he saw that he was not alone. Riveredge was\ntechnically uninhabited. Then what voices called guardedly to him from\nthe shadows: \"Buddy--buddy--wait up a minute, buddy--did you score? Did\nyou score?\"\n\nHe lurched on and the voices became bolder. The snaking conveyors and\nramps sliced out sectors of space. Storage tanks merged with inflow\nmains to form sheltered spots where they met. No spot was without its\nwhining, appealing voice. He stood at last, quivering, leaning against a\ngigantic I-beam that supported a heavy-casting freightway. A scrap sheet\nof corrugated iron rested against the bay of the I-beam, and the sheet\nquivered and fell outward. An old man's voice said: \"You're beat, son.\nCome on in.\"\n\nHe staggered a step forward and collapsed on a pallet of rags as\nsomebody carefully leaned the sheet back into place again.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nMax Wyman woke raving with the chuck horrors. There was somebody there\nto hand him candy bars, sweet lemonade, lump sugar. There was somebody\nto shove him easily back into the pallet of rags when he tried to\nstumble forth in a hunt for booze. On the second day he realized that\nit was an old man whose face looked gray and paralyzed. His name was T.\nG. Pendelton, he said.\n\nAfter a week, he let Max Wyman take little walks about their part of\nRiverside--but not by night. \"We've got some savage people here,\" he\nsaid. \"They'd murder you for a pint. The women are worse. If one calls\nto you, don't go. You'll wind up dumped through a manhole into the\nHudson. Poor folk.\"\n\n\"You're _sorry_ for them?\" Wyman asked, startled. It was a new idea to\nhim. Since Buffalo, he had never been sorry for anybody. Something awful\nhad happened there, some terrible betrayal ... he passed his bony hand\nacross his forehead. He didn't want to think about it.\n\n\"Would I live here if I weren't?\" T. G. asked him. \"Sometimes I can help\nthem. There's nobody else to help them. They're old and sick and they\ndon't fit anywhere. That's why they're savage. You're young--the only\nyoung man I've ever seen in Riveredge. There's so much outside for the\nyoung. But when you get old it sometimes throws you.\"\n\n\"The Goddammed Syndic,\" Wyman snarled, full of hate.\n\nT. G. shrugged. \"Maybe it's too easy for sick old people to get booze.\nThey lose somebody they spent a life with and it throws them. People\nharden into a pattern. They always had fun, they think they always will.\nThen half of the pattern's gone and they can't stand it, some of them.\nYou got it early. What was the ringing bell?\"\n\nWyman collapsed into the bay of the I-beam as if he'd been kicked in the\nstomach. A wave of intolerable memory swept over him. A ringing bell, a\nwobbling pendulum, a flashing light, the fair face of his betrayer, the\nhateful one of Hogan, stirred together in a hell brew. \"Nothing,\" he\nsaid hoarsely, thinking that he'd give his life for enough booze to\nblack him out. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You kept talking about it,\" T. G. said. \"Was it real?\"\n\n\"It couldn't have been,\" Wyman muttered. \"There aren't such things. No.\nThere was her and that Syndic and that louse Hogan. I don't want to talk\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\"\n\nHe did talk about it later, curiously clouded though it was. The years\nin Buffalo. The violent love affair with Inge. The catastrophic scene\nwhen he found her with Regan, king-pin mobster. The way he felt turned\ninside-out, the lifetime of faith in the Syndic behind him and the\nlifetime of a faith in Inge ahead of him, both wrecked, the booze, the\nflight from Buffalo to Erie, to Pittsburgh, to Tampa, to New York. And\nsomehow, insistently, the ringing bell, the wobbling pendulum and the\nflashing light that kept intruding between episodes of reality.\n\nT. G. listened patiently, fed him, hid him when infrequent patrols went\nby. T. G. never told him his own story, but a bloated woman who lived\nwith a yellow-toothed man in an abandoned storage tank did one day, her\nvoice echoing from the curving, windowless walls of corrugated plastic.\nShe said T. G. had been an alky chemist, reasonably prosperous,\nreasonably happy, reasonably married. His wife was the faithful kind and\nhe was not. With unbelievable slyness she had dulled the pain for years\nwith booze and he had never suspected. They say she had killed herself\nafter one frightful week-long debauche in Riveredge. T. G. came down to\nRiveredge for the body and returned after giving it burial and drawing\nhis savings from the bank. He had never left Riveredge since.\n\n\"Worsh'p the grun' that man walks on,\" the bloated woman mumbled. \"Nev'\ngets mad, nev' calls you hard names. Give y'a bottle if y' need it. Talk\nto y' if y' blue. Worsh'p that man.\"\n\nMax Wyman walked from the storage tank, sickened. T. G.'s charity\ncovered that creature and him.\n\nIt was the day he told T. G.: \"I'm getting out of here.\"\n\nThe gray, paralyzed-looking face almost smiled. \"See a man first?\"\n\n\"Friend of yours?\"\n\n\"Somebody who heard about you. Maybe he can do something for you. He\nfeels the way you do about the Syndic.\"\n\nWyman clenched his teeth. The pain still came at the thought. Syndic,\nHogan, Inge and betrayal. God, to be able to hit back at them!\n\nThe red ride ebbed. Suddenly he stared at T. G. and demanded: \"Why? Why\nshould you put me in touch? What is this?\"\n\nT. G. shrugged. \"I don't worry about the Syndic. I worry about people.\nI've been worrying about you. You're a little insane, Max, like all of\nus here.\"\n\n\"God damn you!\"\n\n\"He has....\"\n\nMax Wyman paused a long time and said: \"Go on, will you?\" He realized\nthat anybody else would have apologized. But he couldn't and he knew\nthat T. G. knew he couldn't.\n\nThe old man said: \"A little insane. Bottled-up hatred. It's better out\nof you than in. It's better to sock the man you hate and stand a chance\nof having him sock you back than it is just to hate him and let the\nhate gnaw you like a grave-worm.\"\n\n\"What've you got against the Syndic?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Max. Nothing against it and nothing for it. What I'm for is\npeople. The Syndic is people. You're people. Slug 'em if you want and\nthey'll have a chance to slug you back. Maybe you'll pull down the\nSyndic like Samson in the temple; more likely it'll crush you. But\nyou'll be _doing_ something about it. That's the great thing. That's the\nthing people have to learn--or they wind up in Riveredge.\"\n\n\"You're crazy.\"\n\n\"I told you I was, or I wouldn't be here.\"\n\nThe man came at sunset. He was short and pudgy, with a halo of wispy\nhair and the coldest, grimmest eyes that Wyman had ever seen. He shook\nhands with Wyman, and the young man noted simultaneously a sharp pain in\nhis finger and that the stranger wore an elaborate gold ring. Then the\nworld got hazy and confused. He had a sense that he was being asked\nquestions, that he was answering them, that it went on for hours and\nhours.\n\nWhen things quite suddenly came into focus again, the pudgy man was\nsaying: \"I can introduce myself now. Commander Grinnel, of the North\nAmerican Navy. My assignment is recruiting. The preliminary examination\nhas satisfied me that you are no plant and would be a desirable citizen\nof the N. A. Government. I invite you to join us.\"\n\n\"What would I do?\" Wyman asked steadily.\n\n\"That depends on your aptitudes. What do you think you would like to\ndo?\"\n\nWyman said: \"Kill me some Syndics.\"\n\nThe commander stared at him with those cold eyes. He said at last: \"It\ncan probably be arranged. Come with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went by train to Cape Cod. At midnight on January 15th, the\ncommander and Wyman left their hotel room and strolled about the\nstreets. The commander taped small packets to the four legs of the\nmicrowave relay tower that connected Cape Cod with the Continental Press\ncommon carrier circuits and taped other packets to the police station's\nmotor pool gate.\n\nAt 1:00 A.M., the tower exploded and the motor pool gate fused into an\nimpassible puddle of blue-hot molten metal. Simultaneously, fifty men in\nturtle-neck sweaters and caps appeared from nowhere on Center Street.\nHalf of them barricaded the street, firing on citizens and cops who came\ntoo close. The others systematically looted every store between the\nbarricade and the beach.\n\nBlinking a flashlight in code, the commander approached the deadline\nunmolested and was let through with Wyman at his heels. The goods, the\nraiders, the commander and Wyman were aboard a submarine by 2:35 and\nunder way ten minutes later.\n\nAfter Commander Grinnel had exchanged congratulations with the sub\ncommander, he presented Wyman.\n\n\"A recruit. Normally I wouldn't have bothered, but he had a rather\nspecial motivation. He could be very useful.\"\n\nThe sub commander studied Wyman impersonally. \"If he's not a plant.\"\n\n\"I've used my ring. If you want to get it over with, we can test him and\nswear him in now.\"\n\nThey strapped him into a device that recorded pulse, perspiration,\nrespiration, muscle-tension and brainwaves. A sweatered specialist came\nand mildly asked Wyman matter-of-fact questions about his surroundings\nwhile he calibrated the polygraph.\n\nThen came the pay-off. Wyman did not fail to note that the sub commander\nloosened his gun in his holster when the questioning began.\n\n\"Name, age and origin?\"\n\n\"Max Wyman. Twenty-two. Buffalo Syndic Territory.\"\n\n\"Do you like the Syndic?\"\n\n\"I hate them.\"\n\n\"What are your feelings toward the North American Government?\"\n\n\"If it's against the Syndic, I'm for it.\"\n\n\"Would you rob for the North American Government?\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"Would you kill for it?\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"Have you any reservations yet unstated in your answers?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nIt went on for an hour. The questions were re-phrased continuously;\nafter each of Wyman's firm answers, the sweatered technician gave a\nsatisfied little nod. At last it ended and he was unstrapped from the\ndevice.\n\nMax was tired.\n\nThe sub commander seemed a little awed as he got a small book and read\nfrom it: \"Do you, Max Wyman, solemnly renounce all allegiances\npreviously held by you and pledge your allegiance to the North American\nGovernment?\"\n\n\"I do,\" the young man said fiercely.\n\nIn a remote corner of his mind, for the first time in months, the bell\nceased to ring, the pendulum to beat and the light to flash.\n\nCharles Orsino knew again who he was and what was his mission.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nIt had begun when the girl led him through the conference room door.\nNaturally one had misgivings; naturally one didn't speak up. But the\nvault-like door far downstairs was terrifying when it yawned before you\nand even more so when it closed behind you.\n\n\"What is this place?\" he demanded at last. \"Who are you?\"\n\nShe said: \"Psychology lab.\"\n\nIt produced on him the same effect that \"alchemy section\" or \"Division\nof astrology\" would have on a well-informed young man in 1950. He\nrepeated flatly: \"Psychology lab. If you don't want to tell me, very\nwell. I volunteered without strings.\" Which should remind her that he\nwas a sort of hero and should be treated with a certain amount of\ndignity and that she could save her corny jokes.\n\n\"I meant it,\" she said, fiddling busily with the locks of yet another\nvault-like door. \"I'm a psychologist. I'm also by the way, Lee\nFalcaro--since you asked.\"\n\n\"The old man--Edward Falcaro's line?\" he asked.\n\n\"Simon pure. He's my father's brother. Father's down in Miami, handling\nthe tracks and gaming in general.\"\n\nThe second big door opened on a brain-gray room whose air had a\ncuriously dead feel to it. \"Sit down,\" she said, indicating a very\nunorthodox chair. He did, and found that the chair was the most\ncomfortable piece of furniture he had ever known. Its contact with his\nbody was so complete that it pressed nowhere, it poked nowhere. The girl\nstudied dials in its back nevertheless and muttered something about\nadjusting it. He protested.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she said decisively. She sat down herself in an ordinary\nseat. Charles shifted uneasily in his chair to find that it moved with\nhim. Still no pressure, still no poking.\n\n\"You're wondering,\" she began, \"about the word 'psychology'. It has a\nbad history and people have given it up as a bad job. It's true that\nthere isn't pressure nowadays to study the human mind. People get along.\nIn general what they want they get, without crippling effort. In your\nuncle Frank Taylor's language, the Syndic is an appropriately-structured\norganization of high morale and wide public acceptance. In my language\nthe Syndic is a father-image which does a good job of fathering. In good\ntimes, people aren't introspective.\n\n\"There is, literally, no reason why my line of the family should have\nkept up a tradition of experimental psychology. Way, way back, old\nAmadeo Falcaro often consulted Professor Oscar Sternweiss of the\nColumbia University psychology faculty--he wasn't as much of a dashing\nimprovisor as the history books make him out to be. Eventually one of\nhis daughters married one of Sternweiss' sons and inherited the\nSternweiss notebooks and library and apparatus. It became an irrational\ncustom to keep it alive. When each academic school of psychology managed\nto prove that every other school of psychology was dead wrong and\npsychology collapsed as a science, the family tradition was unaffected;\nit stood outside the wrangling.\n\n\"Now, you're wondering what this has to do with trying to slip you into\nthe Government.\"\n\n\"I am,\" Charles said fervently. If she'd been a doll outside the Syndic,\nhe would minutes ago have protested that all this was foolish and walked\nout. Since she was not only in the Syndic, but in the Falcaro line, he\nhad no choice except to hear her babble and _then_ walk out. It was all\nrot, psychology. Id, oversoul, mind-vectors, counseling,\npsychosomatics--rot from sick-minded old men. Everybody knew--\n\n\"The Government, we know, uses deinhibiting drugs as a first screening\nof its recruits. As an infallible second screening, they use a\nphysiological lie-detector based on the fact that telling a lie causes\ntensions in the liar's body. We shall get around this by slipping you in\nas a young man who hates the Syndic for some valid reason--\"\n\n\"Confound it, you were just telling me that they can't be fooled!\"\n\n\"We won't fool them. You'll _be_ a young man who hates the Syndic. We'll\ntear down your present personality a gray cell at a time. We'll pump you\nfull of Seconal every day for a quarter of a year.... We'll obliterate\nyour personality under a new one. We'll bury Charles Orsino under a\nmountain of suggestions, compulsions and obsessions shoveled at you\nsixteen hours a day while you're too groggy to resist. Naturally the\nsupplanting personality will be neurotic, but that works in with the\nmission.\"\n\nHe struggled with a metaphysical concept, for the first time in his\nlife. \"But--but--how will I know I'm _me_?\"\n\n\"We think we can put a trigger on it. When you take the Government oath\nof allegiance, you should bounce back.\"\n\nHe did not fail to note a little twin groove between her brows that\nappeared when she said _think_ and _should_. He knew that in a sense he\nwas nearer death now than when Halloran's bullet had been intercepted.\n\n\"Are you staying with it?\" she asked simply.\n\nVarious factors entered into it. _A life for the Syndic_, as in the\nchildren's history books. That one didn't loom very large. But multiply\nit by _it sounds like more fun than hot-rod polo_, and that by _this is\ngoing to raise my stock sky-high with the family_ and you had something.\nSomehow, under Lee Falcaro's interested gaze, he neglected to divide it\nby _if it works_.\n\n\"I'm staying with it,\" he said.\n\nShe grinned. \"It won't be too hard,\" she said. \"In the old days there\nwould have been voting record, social security numbers, military\nservice, addresses they could check on--hundreds of things. Now about\nall we have to fit you with is a name and a subjective life.\"\n\nIt began that spring day and went on into late fall.\n\nThe ringing bell.\n\nThe flashing light.\n\nThe wobbling pendulum.\n\nYou are Max Wyman of Buffalo Syndic Territory.

Orsino had been assigned a bunk and, to\nhis surprise, had fallen asleep almost at once. At eight in the morning,\nhe was shaken awake by one of the men in caps.\n\n\"Shift change,\" the man explained laconically.\n\nOrsino started to say something polite and sleepy. The man grabbed his\nshoulder and rolled him onto the deck, snarling: \"You going to _argue_?\"\n\nOrsino's reactions were geared to hot-rod polo--doing the split-second\nright thing after instinctively evaluating the roll of the ball, the\nricochet of bullets, the probable tactics and strategy of the opposing\nfour. They were not geared to a human being who behaved with the blind\nferocity of an inanimate object. He just gawked at him from the deck,\nnoting that the man had one hand on a sheath knife.\n\n\"All right, buster,\" the man said contemptuously, apparently deciding\nthat Orsino would stay put. \"Just don't mess with the Guard.\" He rolled\ninto the bunk and gave a good imitation of a man asleep until Orsino\nworked his way through the crowded compartment and up a ladder to the\ndeck.\n\nThere was a heavy, gray over-cast. The submarine seemed to be planing\nthe water; salt spray washed the shining deck. A gun crew was forward,\ndrilling with a five-incher. The rasp of a petty-officer singing out the\nnumbers mingled with the hiss and gurgle of the spray. Orsino leaned\nagainst the conning tower and tried to comb his thoughts out clean and\nstraight.\n\nIt wasn't easy.\n\nHe was Charles Orsino, very junior Syndic member, with all memories\npertaining thereto.\n\nHe was also, more dimly, Max Wyman with _his_ memories. Now, able to\nstand outside of Wyman, he could recall how those memories had been\nimplanted--down to the last stab of the last needle. He thought some\nvery bitter thoughts about Lee Falcaro--and dropped them, snapping to\nattention as Commander Grinnel pulled himself through the hatch. \"Good\nmorning, sir,\" he said.\n\nThe cold eyes drilled him. \"Rest,\" the commander said. \"We don't play it\nthat way on a pigboat. I hear you had some trouble about your bunk.\"\n\nOrsino shrugged uncomfortably.\n\n\"Somebody should have told you,\" the commander said. \"The boat's full of\nGuardsmen. They have a very high opinion of themselves--which is\ncorrect. They carried off the raid in good style. You don't mess with\nGuards.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" Orsino asked.\n\nGrinnel shrugged. \"The usual elite,\" he said. \"Loman's gang.\" He noted\nOrsino's blank look and smiled coldly. \"Loman's President of North\nAmerica,\" he said.\n\n\"On shore,\" Orsino hazarded, \"we used to hear about somebody named Ben\nMiller.\"\n\n\"Obsolete information. Miller had the Marines behind him. Loman was\nSecretary of Defense. He beached the Marines and broke them up into\nguard detachments. Took away their heavy weapons. Meanwhile, he built up\nthe Guard, very quietly--which, with the Secretary of Information behind\nhim, he could do. About two years ago, he struck. The Marines who didn't\njoin the Guard were massacred. Miller had the sense to kill himself. The\nVeep and the Secretary of State resigned, but it didn't save their\nnecks. Loman assumed the Presidency automatically, of course, and had\nthem shot. They were corrupt as hell anyway. They were owned body and\nsoul by the southern bloc.\"\n\nTwo seamen appeared with a folding cot, followed by the sub commander.\nHe was red-eyed with lack of sleep. \"Set it there,\" he told them, and\nsat heavily on the sagging canvas. \"Morning, Grinnel,\" he said with an\neffort. \"Believe I'm getting too old for the pigboats. I want sun and\nair. Think you can use your influence at court to get me a corvette?\" He\nbared his teeth to show it was a joke.\n\nGrinnel said, with a minimum smile: \"If I had any influence, would I\ncatch the cloak-and-dagger crap they sling at me?\"\n\nThe sub commander rolled back onto the cot and was instantly asleep, a\nmuscle twitching the left side of his face every few seconds.\n\nGrinnel drew Orsino to the lee of the conning tower. \"We'll let him\nsleep,\" he said. \"Go tell that gun crew Commander Grinnel says they\nshould lay below.\"\n\nOrsino did. The petty officer said something exasperated about the\ngunnery training bill and Orsino repeated his piece. They secured the\ngun and went below.\n\nGrinnel said, with apparent irrelevance: \"You're a rare bird, Wyman.\nYou're capable--and you're uncommitted. Let's go below. Stick with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe followed the fat little commander into the conning tower. Grinnel\ntold an officer of some sort: \"I'll take the con, mister. Wyman here\nwill take the radar watch.\" He gave Orsino a look that choked off his\nprotests. Presumably, Grinnel knew that he was ignorant of radar.\n\nThe officer, looking baffled, said: \"Yes, Commander.\" A seaman pulled\nhis head out of a face-fitting box and told Wyman: \"It's all yours,\nstranger.\" Wyman cautiously put his face into the box and was confronted\nby meaningless blobs of green, numerals in the dark, and a couple of\narrows to make confusion complete.\n\nHe heard Grinnel say to the helmsman: \"Get me a mug of joe, sailor. I'll\ntake the wheel.\"\n\n\"I'll pass the word, sir.\"\n\n\"Nuts you'll pass the word, sailor. Go get the coffee--and I want it now\nand not when some steward's mate decides he's ready to bring it.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir.\" Orsino heard him clatter down the ladder. Then his arm\nwas gripped and Grinnel's voice muttered in his ear: \"When you hear me\nbitch about the coffee, sing out: 'Aircraft 265, DX 3,000'. Good and\nloud. No, don't stop looking. Repeat it.\"\n\nOrsino said, his eyes crossing on double images of the meaningless,\nluminous blobs: \"Aircraft 265, DX 3,000. Good and loud. When you bitch\nabout the coffee.\"\n\n\"Right. Don't forget it.\"\n\nHe heard the feet on the ladder again. \"Coffee, sir.\"\n\n\"Thanks, sailor.\" A long sip and then another. \"I always said the\npigboats drink the lousiest joe in the Navy.\"\n\n\"Aircraft 265, DX 3,000!\" Orsino yelled.\n\nA thunderous alarm began to sound. \"Take her down!\" yelled Commander\nGrinnel.\n\n\"Take her down, sir!\" the helmsman echoed. \"But sir, the skipper--\"\n\nOrsino remembered him too then, dead asleep in his cot on the deck, the\nmuscle twitching the left side of his face every few seconds.\n\n\"God-damn it, those were aircraft! _Take her down!_\"\n\nThe luminous blobs and numbers and arrows swirled before Orsino's eyes\nas the trim of the ship changed, hatches clanged to and water thundered\ninto the ballast tanks. He staggered and caught himself as the deck\nangled sharply underfoot.\n\nHe knew what Grinnel had meant by saying he was uncommitted, and he knew\nnow that it was no longer true.\n\nHe thought for a moment that he might be sick into the face-fitting box,\nbut it passed.\n\nMinutes later, Grinnel was on the mike, his voice sounding metallically\nthrough the ship: \"To all hands. To all hands. This is Commander\nGrinnel. We lost the skipper in that emergency dive--but you and I know\nthat that's the way he would have wanted it. As senior line officer\naboard, I'm assuming command for the rest of the voyage. We will remain\nsubmerged until dark. Division officers report to the wardroom. That's\nall.\"\n\nHe tapped Orsino on the shoulder. \"Take off,\" he said. Orsino realized\nthat the green blobs--clouds, were they?--no longer showed, and recalled\nthat radar didn't work through water.\n\nHe wasn't in on the wardroom meeting, and wandered rather forlornly\nthrough the ship, incredibly jammed as it was with sleeping men,\ncoffee-drinking men and booty. Half a dozen times he had to turn away\nclose questioning about his radar experience and the appearance of the\naircraft on the radar scope. Each time he managed it, with the feeling\nthat one more question would have cooked his goose.\n\nThe men weren't sentimental about the skipper they had lost. Mostly they\nwondered how much of a cut Grinnel would allot them from the booty of\nCape Cod.\n\nAt last the word passed for \"Wyman\" to report to the captain's cabin. He\ndid, sweating after a fifteen-minute chat with a radar technician.\n\nGrinnel closed the door of the minute cabin and smirked at him. \"You\nhave trouble, Wyman?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You'd have worse trouble if they found out for sure that you don't know\nradar. I'd be in the clear. I could tell them you claimed to be a\nqualified radar man. That would make me out to be pretty gullible, but\nit would make you out to be a murderer. Who's backing you, Wyman? Who\ntold you to get rid of the skipper?\"\n\n\"Quite right, sir,\" Orsino said. \"You've really got me there.\"\n\n\"Glad you realize it, Wyman. I've got you and I can use you. It was a\ngreat bit of luck, the skipper corking off on deck. But I've always had\na talent for improvisation. If you're determined to be a leader, Wyman,\nnothing is more valuable. Do you know, I can relax with you? It's a rare\nfeeling. For once I can be certain that the man I'm talking to isn't one\nof Loman's stooges, or one of Clinch's N.A.B.I. ferrets or anything else\nbut what he says he is--\n\n\"But that's beside the point. I have something else to tell you. There\nare two sides to working for me, Wyman. One of them's punishment if you\nget off the track. That's been made clear to you. The other is reward if\nyou stay on. I have plans, Wyman, that are large-scale. They simply\neclipse the wildest hopes of Loman, Clinch, Baggot and the rest. And\nyet, they're not wild. How'd you like to be on the inside when the North\nAmerican Government returns to the mainland?\"\n\nOrsino uttered an authentic gasp and Commander Grinnel looked satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe submarine docked at an indescribably lovely bay in the south of\nIreland. Orsino asked Grinnel whether the Irish didn't object to this,\nand was met with a blank stare. It developed that the Irish consisted of\na few hundred wild men in the woods--maybe a few thousand. The stupid\nshore-bound personnel couldn't seem to clean them out. Grinnel didn't\nknow anything about them, and he cared less.\n\nIreland appeared to be the naval base. The government proper was located\non Iceland, vernal again after a long, climatic swing. The Canaries and\nAscencion were outposts.\n\nOrsino had learned enough on the voyage to recognize the Government for\nwhat it was. It had happened before in history; Uncle Frank had pointed\nit out. Big-time Caribbean piracy had grown from very respectable\norigins. Gentlemen-skippers had been granted letters of marque and\nreprisal by warring governments, which made them a sort of contract\nnavy. Periods of peace had found these privateers unwilling to give up\ntheir hard earned complicated profession and their investments in it.\nWhen they could no longer hoist the flag of England or France or Spain,\nthey simply hoisted the Jolly Roger and went it alone.\n\nConfusing? Hell, yes! The famous Captain Kidd thought he was a gallant\nprivateer and sailed trustingly into New York. Somewhere he had failed\nto touch third base; they shipped him to London for trial and hanged him\nas a pirate. The famous Henry Morgan had never been anything but a\npirate and a super-pirate; as admiral of a private fleet he executed a\nbrilliant amphibious operation and sacked the city of Panama. He was\nknighted, made governor of a fair-sized English island in the West\nIndies and died loved and respected by all.\n\nCharles Orsino found himself a member of a pirate band that called\nitself the North American Government.\n\nMore difficult to learn were the ins and outs of pirate politics, which\nwere hampered with an archaic, structurally-inappropriate nomenclature\nand body of tradition. Commander Grinnel was a Sociocrat, which meant\nthat he was in the same gang as President Loman. The late sub commander\nhad been a Constitutionist, which meant that he was allied with the\ncurrently-out \"southern bloc.\" The southern bloc did not consist of\nsoutherners at this stage of the North American Government's history but\nof a clique that tended to include the engineers and maintenance men of\nthe Government. That had been the reason for the sub commander's\nerasure.\n\nThe Constitutionists traditionally commanded pigboats and aircraft while\nsurface vessels and the shore establishments were in the hands of the\nSociocrats--the fruit of some long-forgotten compromise.\n\nCommander Grinnel cheerfully explained to Charles that there was a\ncrypto-Sociocrat naval officer primed and waiting to be appointed to the\ncommand of the sub. The Constitutionist gang would back him to the hilt\nand the Sociocrats would growl and finally assent. If, thereafter, the\nConstitutionists ever counted on the sub in a coup, they would be\nquickly disillusioned.\n\nThere wasn't much voting. Forty years before there had been a bad\ndeadlock following the death by natural causes of President Powell after\nseventeen years in office. An ad hoc bipartisan conference called a\nsession of the Senate and the Senate elected a new president.\n\nIt was little information to be equipped with when you walked out into\nthe brawling streets of New Portsmouth on shore leave.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe town had an improvised look which was strange to Orsino. There was a\nsanitation reactor every hundred yards or so, but he mistrusted the look\nof the ground-level mains that led to it from, the houses. There were\nhouse flies from which he shied violently. Every other shack on the\nwaterfront was a bar or a notch joint. He sampled the goods at one of\nthe former and was shocked by the quality and price. He rolled out, his\nears still ringing from the belt of raw booze; as half a dozen sweatered\nGuards rolled in, singing some esoteric song about their high morale and\neven higher venereal rate. A couple of them looked at him appraisingly,\nas though they wondered what kind of a noise he'd make if they jumped on\nhis stomach real hard, and he hurried away from them.\n\nThe other entertainment facilities of the waterfront were flatly ruled\nout by a quick inspection of the wares. He didn't know what to make of\nthem. Joints back in Syndic Territory if you were a man, made sense. You\nwent to learn the ropes, or because you were afraid of getting mixed up\nin something intense when you didn't want to, or because you wanted a\nchange, or because you were too busy, lazy or shy to chase skirts on\nyour own. If you were a woman and not too particular, a couple of years\nin a joint left you with a considerable amount of money and some\ninteresting memories which you were under no obligation to discuss with\nyour husbands or husband.\n\nBut the sloppy beasts who called to him from the windows of the joints\nhere on the waterfront, left him puzzled and disgusted. He reflected,\nstrolling up Washington Street with eyes straight ahead, that women must\nbe in short supply if they could make a living--or that the male\ncitizens of the Government had no taste.\n\nA whiff from one of those questionable sewer mains sent him reeling. He\nducked into another saloon in self-defense and leaned groggily against\nthe bar. A pretty brunette demanded: \"What'll you have?\"\n\n\"Gin, please.\" He peeled a ten off the roll Grinnel had given him. When\nthe girl poured his gin he looked at her and found her fair. In all\ninnocence, he asked her a question, as he might have asked a barmaid\nback home. She could have answered, \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Maybe,\" or \"What's in\nit for me?\"\n\nInstead she called him a lousy bastard, picked up a beer mug and was\nabout to shatter it on his head when a hand caught her and a voice\nwarned: \"Hold it, Mabel! This guy's off my ship.\n\n\"He's just out of the States; he doesn't know any better. You know what\nit's like over there.\"\n\nMabel snarled: \"You better wise him up, then, friend. He can't go around\ntalking like that to decent women.\" She slapped down another glass,\npoured gin and flounced down the bar.\n\nCharles gulped his gin and turned shakily to his deliverer, a little\nreactor specialist he had seen on the sub once or twice. \"Thanks,\" he\nsaid feeling inadequate. \"Maybe you better wise me up. All I said was,\n'Darling, do you--'\"\n\nThe reactor man held up his hand. \"That's enough,\" he said. \"You don't\ntalk that way over here unless you want your scalp parted.\"\n\nCharles, buzzing a little with the gin, protested hotly: \"But what's the\nharm? All she had to say was no; I wasn't going to throw her down on the\nfloor!\"\n\nIt was all very confusing.\n\nA shrug. \"I heard about things in the States--Wyman, isn't it? I guess I\ndidn't really believe it. You mean I could go up to any woman and just\nask her how's about it?\"\n\n\"Within reason, yes.\"\n\n\"And _do_ they?\"\n\n\"Some do, some don't--like here.\"\n\n\"Like hell, like here! Last liberty--\" and the reactor man told him a\nlong, confusing story about how he had picked up this pig, how she had\ndangled it in front of him for one solid week while he managed to spend\nthree hundred and eighty-six dollars on her, and how finally she had\nbawled that she couldn't, she just hated herself but she couldn't do\nanything like _that_ and bang went the door in his face, leaving him to\nfinish out the evening in a notch joint.\n\n\"Good God!\" Charles said, appalled. \"Was she out of her mind?\"\n\n\"No,\" the reactor man said glumly, \"but I must have been. I should of\ngot her drunk and raped her the first night.\"\n\nCharles was fully conscious that values were different here. Choking\ndown something like nausea, he asked carefully: \"Is there much rape?\"\n\nThe little man signalled for another gin and downed it. \"I guess so.\nOnce when I was a kid a dame gave me this line about her cousin raped\nher when she was little so she was frigid. I had more ambition then, so\nI said: 'Then this won't be anything new to you, baby,' I popped her on\nthe button--\"\n\n\"I've got to go now,\" Charles said, walking straight out of the saloon.\nHe was beginning to understand the sloppy beasts in the windows of the\nnotch joint and why men could bring themselves to settle for nothing\nbetter. He was also overwhelmed by a great wave of home sickness.\n\nThe ugly pattern was beginning to emerge. Prudery, rape, frigidity,\nintrigue for power--and assassination? Beyond the one hint, Grinnel had\nsaid nothing that affected Syndic Territory.\n\nBut nothing would be more logical than for this band of brigands to lust\nafter the riches of the continent.\n\nBack of the waterfront were shipfitting shops and living quarters. Work\nwas being done by a puzzling combination of mechanization and\nmusclepower. In one open shed he saw a lathe-hand turning a gunbarrel\nout of a forging; the lathe was driven by one of those standard 18-inch\nehrenhaft rotors Max Wyman knew so well. But a vertical drillpress next\nto it--Orsino blinked. Two men, sweating and panting, were turning a\nstubborn vertical drum as tall as they were, and a belt drive from the\ndrum whirled the drill bit as it sank into a hunk of bronze. The men\nwere in rags, dirty rags. And it came to Orsino with a stunning shock\nwhen he realized what the dull, clanking things were that swung from\ntheir wrists. They were chained to the handles of the wheel.\n\nHe walked on, almost dazed, comprehending now some cryptic remarks that\nhad been passed aboard the sub.\n\n\"No Frog has staying power. Give a Limey his beef once a day and he'll\noutsweat a Frog.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you can't whip a Limey. They just go bad when you whip a\nLimey.\"\n\n\"They just get sullen for awhile. But let me tell you, friend, don't\never whip a Spig. You whip a Spig, he'll wait twenty years if he has to\nbut he'll _get_ you, right between the ribs.\"\n\n\"If a Spig wants to be boiled, I should worry.\"\n\nIt had been broken up in laughter.\n\n_Boiled!_ Could such things be?\n\nSixteen ragged, filth-crusted sub-humans were creeping down the road,\neach straining at a rope. An inch at a time, they were dragging a skid\nloaded with one huge turbine gear whose tiny herringbone teeth caught\nthe afternoon sun.\n\nThe Government had reactors, the Government had vehicles--why this? He\nslowly realized that the Government's metal and machinery and atomic\npower went into its warships; that there was none left over for\nconsumers, and the uses of peace. The Government had degenerated into a\ndawn-age monster, specialized all to teeth and claws and muscles to\ndrive them with. The Government was now, whatever it had been, a\ngraceless, humorless incarnate ferocity. Whatever lightness or joy\nsurvived was the meaningless vestigial twitching of an obsolete organ.\n\nSomewhere a child began to bawl and Charles was surprised to feel a\nprofound pity welling up in him. Like a sedentary man who after a\nworkout aches in muscles he never knew he owned, Charles was discovering\nthat he had emotions which had never been poignantly evoked by the bland\npassage of the hours in Syndic Territory.\n\nPoor little bastard, he thought, growing up in this hellhole. I don't\nknow what having slaves to kick around will do to you, but I don't see\nhow you can grow up a human being. I don't know what fear of love will\ndo to you--make you a cheat? Or a graceful rutting animal with a choice\nonly between graceless rutting violence and a stinking scuffle with a\nflabby and abstracted stranger in a strange unloved room? We have our\nguns to play with and they're good toys, but I don't know what kind of\nmonster you'll become when they give you a gun to live with and violence\nfor a god.\n\n_Reiner was right_, he thought unhappily. _We've got to do something\nabout this mess._\n\nA man and a woman were struggling in an alley as he passed. Old habit\nalmost made him walk on, but this wasn't the playful business of ripping\nclothes as practiced during hilarious moments in Mob Territory. It was a\ngrim and silent struggle--\n\nThe man wore the sweater of the Guards. Nevertheless, Charles walked\ninto the alley and tore him away from the woman; or rather, he yanked at\nthe man's rock-like arm and the man, in surprise, let go of the woman\nand spun to face him.\n\n\"Beat it,\" Charles said to the woman, not looking around. He saw from\nthe corner of his eye that she was staying right there.\n\nThe man's hand was on his sheath knife. He told Charles: \"Get lost. Now.\nYou don't mess with the Guards.\"\n\nCharles felt his knees quivering, which was good. He knew from many a\nchukker of polo that it meant that he was strung to the breaking point,\nready to explode into action. \"Pull that knife,\" he said, \"and the next\nthing you know you'll be eating it.\"\n\nThe man's face went dead calm and he pulled the knife and came in low,\nvery fast. The knife was supposed to catch Charles in the middle. If\nCharles stepped inside it, the man would grab him in a bear hug and\nknife him in the back.\n\nThere was only one answer.\n\nHe caught the thick wrist from above with his left hand as the knife\nflashed toward his middle and shoved out. He felt the point catch and\nslice his cuff. The Guardsman tried a furious and ill-advised kick at\nhis crotch; with his grip on the knife-hand, Charles toppled him into\nthe filthy alley as he stood one-legged and off balance. He fell on his\nback, floundering, and for a black moment, Charles thought his weight\nwas about to tear the wrist loose from his grip. The moment passed, and\nCharles put his right foot in the socket of the Guardsman's elbow,\nreinforced his tiring left hand with his right and leaned, doubling the\nman's forearm over the fulcrum of his boot. The man roared and dropped\nthe knife. It had taken perhaps five seconds.\n\nCharles said, panting: \"I don't want to break your arm or kick your head\nin or anything like that. I just want you to go away and leave the woman\nalone.\" He was conscious of her, vaguely hovering in the background. He\nthought angrily: _She might at least get his knife._\n\nThe Guardsman said thickly: \"You give me the boot and I swear to God\nI'll find you and cut you to ribbons if it takes me the rest of my\nlife.\"\n\n_Good_, Charles thought. _Now he can tell himself he scared me. Good._\nHe let go of the forearm, straightened and took his foot from the man's\nelbow, stepping back. The Guardsman got up stiffly, flexing his arm, and\nstooped to pick up and sheath his knife without taking his eyes off\nCharles. Then he spat in the dust at Charles' feet. \"Yellow crud,\" he\nsaid. \"If the goddam crow was worth it, I'd cut your heart out.\" He\nwalked off down the alley and Charles followed him with his eyes until\nhe turned the corner into the street.\n\nThen he turned, irritated that the woman had not spoken.\n\nShe was Lee Falcaro.\n\n\"Lee!\" he said, thunderstruck. \"What are you doing here?\" It was the\nsame face, feature for feature, and between her brows appeared the same\ndouble groove he had seen before. But she didn't know him.\n\n\"You know me?\" she asked blankly. \"Is that why you pulled that ape off\nme? I ought to thank you. But I can't place you at all. I don't know\nmany people here. I've been ill, you know.\"\n\nThere was a difference apparent now. The voice was a little querulous.\nAnd Charles would have staked his life that never could Lee Falcaro\nhave said in that slightly smug, slightly proprietary, slightly\naren't-I-interesting tone: \"I've been ill, you know.\"\n\n\"But what are you _doing_ here? Damn it, don't you know me? I'm Charles\nOrsino!\"\n\nHe realized then that he had made a horrible mistake.\n\n\"Orsino,\" she said. And then she spat: \"_Orsino!_ Of the _Syndic_!\"\nThere was black hatred in her eyes.\n\nShe turned and raced down the alley. He stood there stupidly, for almost\na minute, and then ran after her, as far as the alley's mouth. She was\ngone. You could run almost anywhere in New Portsmouth in almost a\nminute.\n\nA weedy little seaman wearing crossed quills on his cap was lounging\nagainst a building. He snickered at Charles. \"Don't chase that one,\nsailor,\" he said. \"She is the property of O.N.I.\"\n\n\"You know who she is?\"\n\nThe yeoman happily spilled his inside dope to the fleet gob: \"Lee\nBennet. Smuggled over here couple months ago by D.A.R. The hottest thing\nthat ever hit Naval Intelligence. Very small potato in the Syndic--knows\nall the families, who does what, who's a figurehead and who's a worker.\nTerrific! Inside stuff! Hates the Syndic. A gang of big-timers did her\ndirt.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Charles said, and wandered off down the street.\n\nIt wasn't surprising. He should have _expected_ it.\n\n_Noblesse oblige._\n\nPride of the Falcaro line. She wouldn't send anybody into deadly peril\nunless she were ready to go herself.\n\nOnly somehow the trigger that would have snapped neurotic, synthetic Lee\nBennet into Lee Falcaro hadn't worked.\n\nHe wandered on aimlessly, wondering whether it would be minutes or hours\nbefore he'd be picked up and executed as a spy.\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nIt took minutes only.\n\nHe had headed back to the waterfront, afraid to run, with some vague\nnotion of stealing a boat. Before he reached the row of saloons and\njoints, a smart-looking squad of eight tall men overtook him.\n\n\"Hold it, mister,\" a sergeant said. \"Are you Orsino?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said hopelessly. \"That crazy woman began to yell at me that I\nwas Orsino, but my name's Wyman. What's this about?\"\n\nThe other men fell in beside and behind him. \"We're stepping over to\nO.N.I.,\" the sergeant said.\n\n\"There's the son of a bitch!\" somebody bawled. Suddenly there were a\ndozen sweatered Guardsmen around them. Their leader was the thug Orsino\nhad beaten in a fair fight. He said silkily to the sergeant: \"We want\nthat boy, leatherneck. Blow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sergeant went pale. \"He's wanted for questioning by the O.N.I.,\" he\nsaid stolidly.\n\n\"Get the marine three-striper!\" the Guardsman chortled. He stuck his jaw\ninto the sergeant's face. \"Tell your squad to blow. You marines ought to\nknow by now that you don't mess with the Guard.\"\n\nA very junior officer appeared. \"What's going on here, you men?\" he\nshrilled. \"Atten-_shun_!\" He was ignored as Guardsman and marines\nmeasured one another with their eyes. \"I said _attention_! Dammit,\nsergeant, _report_!\" There was no reaction. The officer yelled: \"You men\nmay think you can get away with this but by God, you're wrong!\" He\nstrode away, his fists clenched and his face very red.\n\nOrsino saw him stride through a gate into a lot marked _Bupers Motor\nPool_. And he felt a sudden wave of communal understanding that there\nwere only seconds to go. The sergeant played for time: \"I'll be glad to\nsurrender the prisoner,\" he started, \"if you have anything to show in\nthe way of--\"\n\nThe Guardsman kicked for the pit of the sergeant's stomach. He was a\nsucker Orsino thought abstractedly as he saw the sergeant catch his\nfoot, dump him and pivot to block another Guardsman. Then he was\nfighting for his life himself, against three bellowing Guardsmen.\n\nA ripping, hammering noise filled the air suddenly. Like cold magic, it\nfroze the milling mob where it stood. Fifty-caliber noise.\n\nThe jaygee was back, this time in a jeep with a twin fifty. And he was\nglaring down its barrels into the crowd. People were beginning to stream\nfrom the saloons, joints and shipfitting shops.\n\nThe jaygee cocked his cap rakishly over one eye. \"_Fall in!_\" he rasped,\nand a haunting air of familiarity came over Orsino.\n\nThe waiting jeep, almost bucking in its eagerness to be let\nloose--Orsino on the ground, knees trembling with tension--a perfect\nchange of mount scene in a polo match. He reacted automatically.\n\nThere was a surrealist flash of the jaygee's face before he clipped him\ninto the back of the square little truck. There was another flash of\nspectators scrambling as he roared the jeep down the road.\n\nFrom then on it was just a question of hanging onto the wheel with one\nhand, trying to secure the free-traversing twin-fifty with the other,\nglancing back to see if the jaygee was still out, avoiding yapping dogs\nand pedestrians, staying on the rutted road, pushing all possible speed\nout of the jeep, noting landmarks, estimating the possibility of\ndangerous pursuit. For a two-goal polo player, a dull little practice\nsession.\n\nThe road, such as it was, wound five miles inland through scrubby\nwoodland and terminated at a lumber camp where chained men in rags were\ndragging logs.\n\nOrsino back tracked a quarter-mile from the camp and jolted overland in\na kidney-cracking hare and hounds course at fifty per.\n\nThe jeep took it for an hour in the fading afternoon light and then\nbucked to a halt. Orsino turned for an overdue check on the jaygee and\nfound him conscious, but greenly clinging to the sides of the vehicle.\nBut he saw Orsino staring and gamely struggled to his feet, standing in\nthe truck bed. \"You're under arrest, sailor,\" he said. \"Striking an\nofficer, abuse of government property, driving a government vehicle\nwithout a trip-ticket--\" His legs betrayed him and he sat down, hard.\n\nOrsino thought very briefly of letting him have a burst from the\ntwin-fifty, and abandoned the idea.\n\nHe seemed to have bitched up everything so far, but he was still on a\nmission. He had a commissioned officer of the Government approximately\nin his power. He snapped: \"Nonsense. _You're_ under arrest.\"\n\nThe jaygee seemed to be reviewing rapidly any transgressions he may have\ncommitted, and asked at last, cautiously: \"By what authority?\"\n\n\"I represent the Syndic.\"\n\nIt was a block-buster. The jaygee stammered: \"But you can't--But there\nisn't any way--But how--\"\n\n\"Never mind how.\"\n\n\"You're crazy. You must be, or you wouldn't stop here. I don't believe\nyou're from the continent and I don't believe the jeep's broken down.\"\nHe was beginning to sound just a little hysterical. \"It can't break down\nhere. We must be more than thirty miles inland.\"\n\n\"What's special about thirty miles inland?\"\n\n\"The natives, you fool!\"\n\nThe natives again. \"I'm not worried about natives. Not with a pair of\nfifties.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" the jaygee said, forcing calm into his voice.\n\"This is The Outback. They're in charge here. We can't do a thing with\nthem. They jump people in the dark and skewer them. Now fix this damn\njeep and let's get rolling!\"\n\n\"Into a firing squad? Don't be silly, lieutenant. I presume you won't\nslug me while I check the engine?\"\n\nThe jaygee was looking around him. \"My God, no,\" he said. \"You may be a\ngangster, but--\" He trailed off.\n\nOrsino stiffened. Gangster was semi-dirty talk. \"Listen, pirate,\" he\nsaid nastily, \"I don't believe--\"\n\n\"_Pirate?_\" the jaygee roared indignantly, and then shut his mouth with\na click, looking apprehensively about. The gesture wasn't faked; it\nalarmed Orsino.\n\n\"Tell me about your wildmen,\" he said.\n\n\"Go to hell,\" the jaygee said sulkily.\n\n\"Look, you called me a gangster first. What about these natives? You\nwere trying to trick me, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Kiss my royal North American eyeball, gangster.\"\n\n\"Don't be childish,\" Charles reproved him, feeling adult and superior.\n(The jaygee looked a couple of years younger than he.) He climbed out of\nhis seat and lifted the hood. The damage was trivial; a shear pin in the\ntransmission had given way. He reported mournfully: \"Cracked block. The\njeep's through forever. You can get on your way, lieutenant. I won't try\nto hold you.\"\n\nThe jaygee fumed: \"You couldn't hold me if you wanted to, gangster. If\nyou think I'm going to try and hoof back to the base alone in the dark,\nyou're crazy. We're sticking together. Two of us may be able to hold\nthem off for the night. In the morning, we'll see.\"\n\nWell, maybe the officer did _believe_ there were wildmen in the woods.\nThat didn't mean there _were_.\n\nThe jaygee got out and looked under the hood uncertainly. It was obvious\nthat in the first place he was no mechanic and in the second place he\ncouldn't conceive of anybody voluntarily risking the woods rather than\nthe naval base. \"Uh-huh,\" he said. \"Dismount that gun while I get a fire\nstarted.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Charles said sardonically, saluting. The jaygee absently\nreturned the salute and began to collect twigs.\n\nOrsino asked: \"How do these aborigines of yours operate?\"\n\n\"Sneak up in the dark. They have spears and a few stolen guns. Usually\nthey don't have cartridges for them but you can't count on that. But\nthey have ... witches.\"\n\nOrsino snorted. He was getting very hungry indeed. \"Do you know any of\nthe local plants we might eat?\"\n\nThe jaygee said confidently: \"I guess we can get by on roots until\nmorning.\"\n\nOrsino dubiously pulled up a shrub, dabbed clods off its root and tasted\nit. It tasted exactly like a root. He sighed and changed the subject.\n\"What do we do with the fifties when I get them both off the mount?\"\n\n\"The jeep mount breaks down some damn way or other into two low-mount\ntripods. See if you can figure it out while I get the fire going.\"\n\nThe jaygee had a small, smoky fire barely going in twenty minutes.\nOrsino was still struggling with the jeep gun mount. It came apart, but\nit couldn't go together again. The jaygee strolled over at last\ncontemptuously to lend a hand. He couldn't make it work either.\n\nTwo lost tempers and four split fingernails later it developed the\n\"elevating screw\" really held the two front legs on and that you\nelevated by adjusting the rear tripod leg. \"A hell of an officer you\nare,\" Orsino sulked.\n\nIt began to rain, putting the fire out with a hiss. They wound up prone\nunder the jeep, not on speaking terms, each tending a gun, each\npresumably responsible for 180 degrees of perimeter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharles was fairly dry, except for a trickle of icy water following a\ncontour that meandered to his left knee. After an hour of\neye-straining--nothing to be seen--and ear-straining--only the patter of\nrain--he heard a snore and kicked the jaygee.\n\nThe jaygee cursed wearily and said: \"I guess we'd better talk to keep\nawake.\"\n\n\"_I'm_ not having any trouble, pirate.\"\n\n\"Oh, knock it off--where do you get that pirate bit, gangster?\"\n\n\"You're outlaws, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Like hell we are. _You're_ the outlaws. You rebelled against the\nlawfully constituted North American Government. Just because you\nwon--for the time being--doesn't mean you were right.\"\n\n\"The fact that we won does mean that we were right. The fact that your\nso-called Government lives by raiding and scavenging off us means you\nwere wrong. God, the things I've seen since I joined up with you thugs!\"\n\n\"I'll bet. Respect for the home, sanctity of marriage, sexual morality,\nlaw and order--you never saw anything like that back home, did you\ngangster?\" He looked very smug.\n\nOrsino clenched his teeth. \"Somebody's been telling you a pack of lies,\"\nhe said. \"There's just as much home and family life and morality and\norder back in Syndic Territory as there is here. And probably a lot\nmore.\"\n\n\"Bull. I've seen intelligence reports; I know how you people live. Are\nyou telling me you don't have sexual promiscuity? Polygamy? Polyandry?\nOpen gambling? Uncontrolled liquor trade? Corruption and shakedowns?\"\n\nOrsino squinted along the barrel of the gun into the rain. \"Look,\" he\nsaid, \"take me as an average young man from Syndic Territory. I know\nmaybe a hundred people. I know just three women and two men who are what\nyou'd call promiscuous. I know one family with two wives and one\nhusband. I don't really know any people personally who go in for\npolyandry, but I've met three casually. And the rest are ordinary\nmiddle-aged couples.\"\n\n\"Ah-_hah_! Middle-aged! Do you mean to tell me you're just leaving out\nanybody under middle age when you talk about morality?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Charles said, baffled. \"Wouldn't you?\"\n\nThe only answer was a snort.\n\n\"What are bupers?\" Charles asked.\n\n\"Bu-Pers,\" the jaygee said distinctly. \"Bureau of Personnel, North\nAmerican Navy.\"\n\n\"What do you do there?\"\n\n\"What _would_ a personnel bureau do?\" the jaygee said patiently. \"We\nrecruit, classify, assign, promote and train personnel.\"\n\n\"Paperwork, huh? No wonder you don't know how to shoot or drive.\"\n\n\"If I didn't need you to cover my back, I'd shove this MG down your\nsilly throat. For your information, gangster, all officers do a tour of\nduty on paperwork before they're assigned to their permanent branch. I'm\ngoing into the pigboats.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Family. My father commands a sub. He's Captain Van Dellen.\"\n\n_Oh, God. Van Dellen._ The sub commander Grinnel--and he--had murdered.\nThe kid hadn't heard yet that his father had been \"lost\" in an emergency\ndive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rain ceased to fall; the pattering drizzle gave way to irregular,\nsplashing drops from leaves and branches.\n\n\"Van Dellen,\" Charles said. \"There's something you ought to know.\"\n\n\"It'll keep,\" the jaygee answered in a grim whisper. The bolt of his gun\nclicked. \"I hear them out there.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nShe felt the power of the goddess working in her, but feebly. Dark ...\nso dark ... and so tired ... how old was she? More than eight hundred\nmoons had waxed and waned above her head since birth. And she had run at\nthe head of her spearmen to the motor sounds. A motor meant the\nsmithymen from the sea, and you killed smithymen when you could.\n\nShe let out a short shrill chuckle in the dark. There was a rustling of\nbranches. One of the spearmen had turned to stare at the sound. She knew\nhis face was worried. \"Tend to business, you fool!\" she wheezed. \"Or by\nBridget--\" His breath went in with a hiss and she chuckled again. You\nhad to let them know who was the cook and who was the potatoes every now\nand then. Kill the fool? Not now; not when there were smithymen with\nguns waiting to be taken.\n\nThe power of the goddess worked stronger in her withered breast as her\nrage grew at their impudence. Coming into _her_ woods with their\nstinking metal!\n\nThere were two of them. A grin slit her face. She had not taken two\nsmithymen together for thirty moons. For all her wrinkles and creaks,\nwhat a fine vessel she was for the power, to be sure! Her worthless,\nslow-to-learn niece could run and jump and she had a certain air, but\nshe'd never be such a vessel. Her sister--the crone spat--these were\ndegenerate days. In the old days, the sister would have been spitted\nwhen she refused the ordeal in her youth. The little one now, whatever\nher name was, she would make a _fine_ vessel for the power when she was\ngathered to the goddess. If her sister or her niece didn't hold her head\nunder water too long, or have a spear shoved too deep into her gut or\nhit her on the head with too heavy a rock.\n\nThese were degenerate days. She had poisoned her own mother to become\nthe vessel of power.\n\nThe spearmen to her right and left shifted uneasily. She heard a faint\nmumble of the two smithymen talking. Let them talk! Doubtless they were\ncursing the goddess obscenely; doubtless that was what the smithymen all\ndid when their mouths were not stuffed with food.\n\nShe thought of the man called Kennedy who forged spearheads and\narrowpoints for her people--he was a strange one, touched by the\ngoddess, which proved her infinite power. She could touch and turn the\nhead of even a smithyman. He was a strange one. Well now, to get on with\nit. She wished the power were working stronger in her; she was tired and\ncould hardly see. But by the grace of the goddess there would be two new\nheads over her holy hut come dawn. She could hardly see, but the goddess\nwouldn't fail her....\n\nShe quavered like a screech-owl, and the spearmen began to slip forward\nthrough the brush. She was not allowed to eat honey lest its sweetness\nclash with the power in her, but the taste of power was sweeter than the\ntaste of honey.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith frightful suddenness there was an ear-splitting shriek and a\ntrampling rush of feet. By sheer reflex, Orsino clamped down on the\ntrigger of his fifty, and his brain rocked at its thunder. Shadowy\nfigures were blotted out by the orange muzzle-flash. You're supposed to\nfire neat, spaced bursts of eight he told himself. I wonder what old\nGilby would say if he could see his star pupil burning out a barrel and\nswinging his gun like a fire hose?\n\nThe gun stopped firing; end of the belt. Twenty, fifty or a hundred\nrounds? He didn't remember. He clawed for another belt and smoothly, in\nthe dark, loaded again and listened.\n\n\"You all right, gangster?\" the jaygee said behind him, making him jump.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Will they come back?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You filthy swine,\" an agonized voice wheezed from the darkness. \"Me\nback is broke, you stinking lice.\" The voice began to sob.\n\nThey listened to it in silence for perhaps a minute. At last he said to\nthe jaygee: \"If the rest are gone maybe we can at least--make him\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Too risky,\" the jaygee said after a long pause.\n\nThe sobbing went on. As the excitement of the attack drained from\nOrsino, he felt deathly tired, cramped and thirsty. The thirst he could\ndo something about. He scooped water from the muddy runnel by his knee\nand sucked it from his palms twice. The third time, he thought of the\nthirst that the sobbing creature out in the dark must be feeling, and\nhis hand wouldn't go to his mouth.\n\n\"I'm going to get him,\" he whispered to the jaygee.\n\n\"Stay where you are! That's an order!\"\n\nHe didn't answer, but began to work his cramped and aching body from\nunder the jeep. The jaygee, a couple of years younger and lither than\nhe, slid out first from his own side. Orsino sighed and relaxed as he\nheard his footsteps cautiously circle the jeep.\n\n\"Finish me off!\" the wounded man was sobbing. \"For the love of the\ngoddess, finish me off, you bitches' bastards! You've broke me\nback--_ah!_\" That was a cry of savage delight.\n\nThere was a strangled noise from the jaygee and then only a soft, deadly\nthrashing noise from the dark. Hell, Orsino thought bitterly. It was my\nidea. He snaked out from under the jeep and raced through wet brush.\n\nThe two of them were a tangled knot of darkness rolling on the ground. A\nnaked back came uppermost; Orsino fell on it and clawed at its head. He\nfelt a huge beard, took two hand-fulls of it and pulled as hard as he\ncould. There was a wild screech and a flailing of arms. The jaygee broke\naway and stood up, panting hoarsely. Charles heard a sharp crunch and a\nsnap, and the flailing sweaty figure, beneath him lay still.\n\n\"Back to the guns,\" the jaygee choked. He swayed, and Orsino took him by\nthe arm.... On the way back to the jeep, they stumbled over something\nthat was certainly a body.\n\nOrsino's flesh shrank from lying down again in the mud behind his gun,\nbut he did, shivering. He heard the jaygee thud wearily into position.\n\"What did you do to him?\" he asked. \"Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Kicked him,\" the jaygee choked. \"His head snapped back and there was\nthat crack. I guess he's dead. I never heard of that broken-wing trick\nbefore. I guess he wanted to take one more with him. They have a kind of\nreligion.\"\n\nThe jaygee sounded as though he was teetering on the edge of breakdown.\nMake him mad, intuition said to Orsino. He might go howling off among\nthe trees unless he snaps out of it.\n\n\"It's a hell of way to run an island,\" he said nastily. \"You beggars\nwere chased out of North America because you couldn't run it right and\nnow you can't even control a lousy little island for more than five\nmiles inland.\" He added with deliberate, superior amusement: \"Of course,\nthey've got witches.\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth, gangster--_I'm warning you._\" The note of hysteria was\nstill there. And then the jaygee said dully: \"I didn't mean that. I'm\nsorry. You did come out and help me after all.\"\n\n\"Surprised?\"\n\n\"Yes. Twice. First time when you wanted to go out yourself. I suppose\nyou can't help being born where you were. Maybe if you came over to us\nall the way, the Government would forgive and forget. But no--I suppose\nnot.\" He paused, obviously casting about for a change of subject. He\nstill seemed sublimely confident that they'd get back to the naval base\nwith him in charge of the detail. \"What ship did you cross in?\"\n\n\"Atom sub _Taft_,\" Orsino said. He could have bitten his tongue out.\n\n\"_Taft?_ That's my father's pigboat! Captain Van Dellen. How is he? I\nwas going down to the dock when--\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" Orsino said flatly. \"He was caught on deck during an\nemergency dive.\"\n\nThe jaygee said nothing for a while and then uttered an unconvincing\nlaugh of disbelief. \"You're lying,\" he said. \"His crew'd never let that\nhappen. They'd let the ship be blown to hell before they took her down\nwithout the skipper.\"\n\n\"Grinnel had the con. He ordered the dive and roared down the crew when\nthey wanted to get your father inboard. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Grinnel,\" the jaygee whispered. \"Grinnel. Yes, I know Commander\nGrinnel. He's--he's a good officer. He must have done it because he had\nto. Tell me about it, please.\"\n\nIt was more than Orsino could bear. \"Your father was murdered,\" he said\nharshly. \"I know because Grinnel put me on radar watch--and I don't know\na God-damned thing about reading a radarscope. He told me to sing out\n'enemy planes' and I did because I didn't know what the hell was going\non. He used that as an excuse to crash-dive while your father was\nsleeping on deck. Your good officer murdered him.\"\n\nHe heard the jaygee sobbing hoarsely. At last he asked Orsino in a dry,\nchoked voice: \"Politics?\"\n\n\"Politics,\" Orsino said.\n\nOrsino jumped wildly as the jaygee's machine gun began to roar a long\nburst of twenty, but he didn't fire himself. He knew that there was no\nenemy out there in the dark, and that the bullets were aimed only at an\nabsent phantom.\n\n\"We've got to get to Iceland,\" the jaygee said at last, soberly. \"It's\nour only chance.\"\n\n\"Iceland?\"\n\n\"This is one for the C.C. of the Constitutionists. The Central\nCommittee. It's a breach of the Freiberg Compromise. It means we call\nthe Sociocrats, and if they don't make full restitution--war.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, _we_?\"\n\n\"You and I. You're the source of the story; you're the one who'd be\nlie-tested.\"\n\nYou've got him, Orsino told himself, but don't be fool enough to count\non it. He's been light-headed from hunger and no sleep and the shock of\nhis father's death. You helped him in a death struggle and there's team\nspirit working on him. The guy covering my back, how can I fail to trust\nhim, how could I dare not to trust him? But don't be fool enough to\ncount on it after he's slept. Meanwhile, push it for all it's worth.\n\n\"What are your plans?\" he asked gravely.\n\n\"We've got to slip out of Ireland by sub or plane,\" the jaygee brooded.\n\"We can't go to the New Portsmouth or Com-Surf organizations; they're\nSociocrat, and Grinnel will have passed the word to the Sociocrats that\nyou're out of control.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Death,\" the jaygee said.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nCommander Grinnel, after reporting formally, had gone straight to a\njoint. It wasn't until midnight that he got The Word, from a friendly\nO.N.I. lieutenant who had dropped into the house.\n\n\"What?\" Grinnel roared. \"Who is this woman? Where is she? Take me to her\nat once!\"\n\n\"Commander!\" the lieutenant said aghast. \"I just got here!\"\n\n\"You heard me, mister! At once!\"\n\nWhile Grinnel dressed he demanded particulars. The lieutenant dutifully\nscoured his memory. \"Brought in on some cloak-and-dagger deal,\nCommander. The kind you usually run. Lieutenant-Commander Jacobi was in\nSyndic Territory on a recruiting, sabotage and reconnaissance mission\nand one of the D.A.R. passed the girl on him. A real Syndic member.\nPriceless. And, as I said, she identified this fellow as Charles Orsino,\nanother Syndic. Why are you so interested, if I may ask?\"\n\nThe Commander dearly wanted to give him a grim: \"You may not,\" but\ndidn't dare. Now was the time to be frank and open. One hint that he had\nanything to hide or cover up would put his throat to the knife. \"The\nman's my baby, lieutenant,\" he said. \"Either your girl's mistaken or Van\nDellen and his polygraph tech and I were taken in by a brand-new\ntechnique.\" _That_ was nice work, he congratulated himself. Got in Van\nDellen and the tech.... Maybe, come to think of it, the tech _was_\ncrooked? No; there was the way Wyman had responded perfectly under scop.\n\nO.N.I.'s building was two stories and an attic, wood-framed, beginning\nto rot already in the eternal Irish damp.\n\n\"We've got her on the third floor, Commander,\" the lieutenant said. \"You\nget there by a ladder.\"\n\n\"In God's name, why?\" They walked past the Charge of Quarters, who\nsnapped to a guilty and belated attention, and through the deserted\noffices of the first and second floors.\n\n\"Frankly, we've had a little trouble hanging on to her.\"\n\n\"She runs away?\"\n\n\"No, nothing like that--not yet, at least. Marine G-2 and Guard\nIntelligence School have both tried to snatch her from us. First with\nrequisitions, then with muscle. We hope to keep her until the word gets\nto Iceland. Then, naturally, _we'll_ be out in the cold.\"\n\nThe lieutenant laughed. Grinnel, puffing up the ladder, did not.\n\nThe door and lock on Lee Bennet's quarters were impressive. The\nlieutenant rapped. \"Are you awake, Lee? There's an officer here who\nwants to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" she said.\n\nThe lieutenant's hands flew over the lock and the door sprang open. The\ngirl was sitting in the dark.\n\n\"I'm Commander Grinnel, my dear,\" he said. After eight hours in the\njoint, he could feel authentically fatherly to her. \"If the time isn't\nquite convenient--\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" she said listlessly. \"What do you want to know?\"\n\n\"The man you identify as Orsino--it was quite a shock to me. Commander\nVan Dellen, who died a hero's death only days ago accepted him as\nauthentic and so, I must admit, did I. He passed both scop and\npolygraph.\"\n\n\"I can't help that,\" she said. \"He came right up to me and told me who\nhe was. I recognized him, of course. He's a polo player. I've seen him\nplay on Long Island often enough, the damned snob. He's not much in the\nSyndic, but he's close to F. W. Taylor. Orsino's an orphan. I don't know\nwhether Taylor's actually adopted him or not. I think not.\"\n\n\"No--possible--mistake?\"\n\n\"No possible mistake.\" She began to tremble. \"My God, Commander\nWhoever-You-Are, do you think I could forget one of those damned\nsneering faces. Or what those people did to me? Get the lie detector\nagain! Strap me into the lie detector! I insist on it! I won't be called\na liar! Do you hear me? Get the lie detector!\"\n\n\"Please,\" the Commander soothed. \"I do believe you, my dear. Nobody\ncould doubt your sincerity. Thank you for helping us, and good night.\"\nHe backed out of the room with the lieutenant. As the door closed he\nsnapped at him: \"Well, mister?\"\n\nThe lieutenant shrugged. \"The lie detector always bears her out. We've\nstopped using it on her. We're convinced that she's on our side. Almost\ndeserving of citizenship.\"\n\n\"Come, now,\" the Commander said. \"You know better than that.\"\n\nBehind the locked door, Lee Bennet had thrown herself on the bed,\ndry-eyed. She wished she could cry, but tears never came. Not since\nthose three roistering drunkards had demonstrated their virility as\nmales and their immunity as Syndics on her ... she couldn't cry any\nmore.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCharles Orsino--another one of them. She hoped they caught him and\nkilled him, slowly. She knew all this was true. Then why did she feel\nlike a murderess? Why did she think incessantly of suicide? Why, why,\nwhy?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn came imperceptibly. First Charles could discern the outline of\ntreetops against the sky and then a little of the terrain before him and\nat last two twisted shadows that slowly became sprawling half-naked\nbodies. One of them was a woman's, mangled by fifty-caliber slugs. The\nother was the body of a bearded giant--the one with whom they had\nstruggled in the dark.\n\nCharles crawled out stiffly. The woman was--had been--a stringy, white\nhaired crone. Some animal's skull was tied to her pate with sinews as a\nhead-dress, and she was tattooed with blue crescents. The jaygee joined\nhim standing over her and said: \"One of their witches. Part of the\nreligion, if you can call it that.\"\n\n\"A brand-new religion?\" Charles asked dubiously. \"Made up out of whole\ncloth?\"\n\n\"No,\" the jaygee said. \"I understand it's an _old_\nreligion--pre-Christian. It kept going underground until the Troubles.\nThen it flared up again all over Europe. A filthy business. Animal\nsacrifices every new moon. Human sacrifices twice a year. What can you\nexpect from people like that?\"\n\nCharles reminded himself that the jaygee's fellow-citizens boiled\nrecalcitrant slaves. \"I'll see what I can do about the jeep,\" he said.\n\nThe jaygee sat down on the wet grass. \"What the hell's the use?\" he\nmumbled wearily. \"Even if you get it running again. Even if we get back\nto the base. They'll be gunning for you. Maybe they'll be gunning for me\nif they killed my father.\" He tried to smile. \"You got any aces in the\nhole, gangster?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Orsino said slowly. \"What do you know about a woman named\nLee--Bennet? Works with O.N.I.?\"\n\n\"Smuggled over here by the D.A.R. A goldmine of information. She's a\nlittle nuts, too. What have you got on her?\"\n\n\"Does she swing any weight? _Is she a citizen?_\"\n\n\"No weight. They're just using her over at Intelligence to fill out the\npicture of the Syndic. And she couldn't be a citizen. A woman has to\nmarry a citizen to be naturalized. What have you got to do with her, for\nGod's sake? Did you know her on the other side? She's death to the\nSyndic; she can't do anything for you.\"\n\nCharles barely heard him. That had to be it. The trigger on Lee\nFalcaro's conditioning had to be the oath of citizenship as it was for\nhis. And it hadn't been tripped because this pirate gang didn't\nparticularly want or need women as first-class, all-privileges citizens.\nA small part of the Government's cultural complex--but one that could\ntrap Lee Falcaro forever in the shell of her synthetic substitute for a\npersonality. Lie-tests, yes. Scopolamine, yes. But for a woman, no\nsubsequent oath.\n\n\"I ran into her in New Portsmouth. She knew me from the other side. She\nturned me in....\" He knelt at a puddle and drank thirstily; the water\neased hunger cramps a little. \"I'll see what I can do with the jeep.\"\n\nHe lifted the hood and stole a look at the jaygee. Van Dellen was\ndropping off to sleep on the wet grass. Charles pried a shear pin from\nthe jeep's winch, punched out the shear pin that had given way in the\ntransmission and replaced it. It involved some hammering. Cracked block,\nhe thought contemptuously. An officer and he couldn't tell whether the\nblock was cracked or not. If I ever get out of this we'll sweep them\nfrom the face of the earth--or more likely just get rid of their\ntom-fool Sociocrats and Constitutionists. The rest are probably all\nright. Except maybe for those bastards of Guardsmen. A bad lot. Let's\nhope they get killed in the fighting.\n\nThe small of his back tickled; he reached around to scratch it and felt\ncold metal.\n\n\"Turn slowly or you'll be spitted like a pig,\" a bass voice growled.\n\nHe turned slowly. The cold metal now at his chest, was the leaf-shaped\nblade of a spear. It was wielded by a red-haired, red-bearded,\nbarrel-chested giant whose blue-green eyes were as cold as death.\n\n\"Tie that one,\" somebody said. Another half-naked man jerked his wrists\nbehind him and lashed them together with cords.\n\n\"Hobble his feet.\" It was a woman's voice. A length of cord or sinew was\nknotted to his ankles with a foot or two of play. He could walk but not\nrun. The giant lowered his spear and stepped aside.\n\nThe first thing Charles saw was that Lieutenant (j.g.) Van Dellen of the\nNorth American Navy had escaped forever from his doubts and confusions.\nThey had skewered him to the turf while he slept. Charles hoped he had\nnot felt the blow.\n\nThe second thing he saw was a supple and coltish girl of perhaps 20\ntenderly removing the animal skull from the head of the slain witch and\nknotting it to her own red-tressed head. Even to Orsino's numbed\nunderstanding, it was clearly an act of the highest significance. It\nsubtly changed the composition of the six-men group in the little glade.\nThey had been a small mob until she put on the skull, but the moment she\ndid they moved instinctively--one a step or two, the other merely\nturning a bit, perhaps--to orient on her. There was no doubt that she\nwas in charge.\n\nA witch, Orsino thought. \"It kept going underground until the Troubles.\"\n\"A filthy business--human sacrifices twice a year.\"\n\nShe approached him and, like the shifting of a kaleidoscope, the group\nfell into a new pattern of which she was still the focus. Charles\nthought he had never seen a face so humorlessly conscious of power. The\npetty ruler of a few barbarians, she carried herself as though she were\nempress of the universe. Nor did a large gray louse that crawled from\nher hairline across her forehead and back again affect her in the\nslightest. She wore a greasy animal hide as though it were royal purple.\nIt added up to either insanity or a limitless pretension to religious\nauthority. And her eyes were not mad.\n\n\"You,\" she said coldly. \"What about the jeep and the guns? Do they go?\"\n\nHe laughed suddenly and idiotically at these words from the mouth of a\nstone-age goddess. A raised spear sobered him instantly. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Show my men how,\" she said, and squatted regally on the turf.\n\n\"Please,\" he said, \"could I have something to eat first?\"\n\nShe nodded indifferently and one of the men loped off into the brush.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hands untied and his face greasy with venison fat, Charles spent the\ndaylight hours instructing six savages in the nomenclature, maintenance\nand operation of the jeep and the twin-fifty machine gun.\n\nThey absorbed it with utter lack of curiosity. They more or less learned\nto start and steer and stop the jeep. They more or less learned to load,\npoint and fire the gun.\n\nThrough the lessons the girl sat absolutely motionless, first in shadow,\nthen in noon and afternoon sun and then in shadow again. But she had\nbeen listening. She said at last: \"You are telling them nothing new now.\nIs there no more?\"\n\nCharles noted that a spear was poised at his ribs. \"A great deal more,\"\nhe said hastily. \"It takes months.\"\n\n\"They can work them now. What more is there to learn?\"\n\n\"Well, what to do if something goes wrong.\"\n\nShe said, as though speaking from vast experience: \"When something goes\nwrong, you start over again. That is all you can do. When I make\ndeath-wine for the spear blades and the death-wine does not kill, it is\nbecause something went wrong--a word or a sign or picking a plant at the\nwrong time. The only thing to do is make the poison again. As you grow\nin experience you make fewer mistakes. That is how it will be with my\nmen when they work the jeep and the guns.\"\n\nShe nodded ever so slightly at one of the men and he took a firmer grip\non his spear.\n\nDeath swooped low.\n\n\"No!\" Charles exploded. \"You don't understand! This isn't like anything\nyou do at all!\" He was sweating, even in the late afternoon chill.\n\"You've got to have somebody who knows how to repair the jeep and the\ngun. If they're busted they're busted and no amount of starting over\nagain will make them work!\"\n\nShe nodded and said: \"Tie his hands. We'll take him with us.\" Charles\nwas torn between relief and wonder at the way she spoke. He realized\nthat he had never, literally _never_, seen any person concede a point in\nquite that fashion. There had been no hesitation, there had been no\nreluctance in the voice, not a flicker of displeasure in the face.\nSimply, without forcing, she had said: \"We'll take him with us.\" It was\nas though--as though she had re-made the immediate past, un-making her\nopposition to the idea, nullifying it. She was a person who was not at\nwar with herself in any respect whatever, a person who knew exactly who\nshe was and what she was--\n\nThe girl rose in a single flowing motion, startling after her day spent\nin immobility. She led the way, flanked by two of the spearmen. The\nother four followed in the jeep, at a crawl. Last of all came Charles,\nand nobody had to urge him. In his portable trap his hours would be\nnumbered if he got separated from his captors.\n\nStick with them, he told himself, stumbling through the brush. Just stay\nalive and you can outsmart these savages. He fell, cursed, picked\nhimself up, stumbled on after the growl of the jeep.\n\nDawn brought them to a collection of mud-and-wattle huts, a corral\nenclosing a few dozen head of wretched diseased cattle, a few adults and\na few children. The girl was still clear-eyed and supple in her\nmovements. Her spearmen yawned and stretched stiffly. Charles was a\nwalking dead man, battered by countless trees and stumbles on the long\ntrek. With red and swollen eyes he watched while half-naked brats\nswarmed over the jeep and grownups made obeisances to the girl--all but\none.\n\nThis was an evil-faced harridan who said to her with cool insolence: \"I\nsee you claim the power of the goddess now, my dear. Has something\nhappened to my sister?\"\n\n\"The guns killed a certain person. I put on the skull. You know what I\nam; do not say 'claim to be.' I warn you once.\"\n\n\"Liar!\" shrieked the harridan. \"You killed her and stole the skull! St.\nPatrick and St. Bridget shrivel your guts! Abaddon and Lucifer pierce\nyour eyes!\"\n\nAn arena formed about them as the girl said coldly: \"I warn you the\nsecond time.\"\n\nThe harridan made signs with her fingers, glaring at her; there was a\nmoan from the watchers; some turned aside and a half-grown girl fainted\ndead away.\n\nThe girl with the skull on her pate said, as though speaking from a\nmillion years and a million miles away: \"This is the third warning;\nthere are no more. Now the worm is in your backbone gnawing. Now the\nmaggots are at your eyes, devouring them. Your bowels turn to water;\nyour heart pounds like the heart of a bird; soon it will not beat at\nall.\" As the eerie, space-filling whisper drilled on the watchers broke\nand ran, holding their hands over their ears, white-faced, but the\nharridan stood as if rooted to the earth. Charles listened dully as the\ncurse was droned, nor was he surprised when the harridan fell, blasted\nby it. Another sorceress, aided it is true by pentothal, had months ago\ndone the same to him.\n\nThe people trickled back, muttering and abject.\n\nJust stay alive and you can outsmart these savages, he repeated\nironically to himself. It had dawned on him that these savages lived by\nan obscure and complicated code harder to master than the intricacies of\nthe Syndic or the Government.\n\nA kick roused him to his feet. One of the spearmen grunted: \"I'm putting\nyou with Kennedy.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Charles groaned. \"You take these cords off me?\"\n\n\"Later.\" He prodded Charles to a minute, ugly block house of logs from\nwhich came smoke and an irregular metallic clanging. He cut the cords,\nrolled great boulders away from a crawl-hole and shoved him through.\n\nThe place was about six by nine feet, hemmed in by ten-inch logs. The\nlight was very bad and the smell was too. A few loopholes let in some\nair. There was a latrine pit and an open stone hearth and a naked brown\nman with wild hair and a beard.\n\nRubbing his wrists, Charles asked uncertainly: \"Are you Kennedy?\"\n\nThe man looked up and croaked: \"Are you from the Government?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Charles said, hope rekindling. \"Thank God they put us together.\nThere's a jeep. Also a twin-fifty. If we play this right the two of us\ncan bust out--\"\n\nHe stopped, disconcerted. Kennedy had turned to the hearth and the\nsmall, fierce fire glowing on it and began to pound a red-hot lump of\nmetal. There were spear heads and arrow heads about in various stages\nof completion, as well as files and a hone.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded. \"Aren't you interested?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm interested,\" Kennedy said. \"But we've got to begin at the\nbeginning. You're too _general_.\" His voice was mild, but reproving.\n\n\"You're right,\" Charles said. \"I guess you've made a try or two\nyourself. But now that there are two of us, what do you suggest? Can you\ndrive a jeep? Can you fire a twin-fifty?\"\n\nThe man poked the lump of metal into the heart of the fire again, picked\nup a black-scaled spear head and began to file an edge into it. \"Let's\nget down to essentials,\" he suggested apologetically. \"What is escape?\nGetting from an undesirable place to a desirable place, opposing and\nneutralizing things or persons adverse to the change of state in the\nprocess. But I'm not being specific, am I? Let's say, then, escape is\ngetting _us_ from a relatively undesirable place to a relatively\ndesirable place, opposing and neutralizing the aborigines.\" He put aside\nthe file and reached for the hone, sleeking it along the bright metal\nribbon of the new edge. He looked up with a pleased smile and asked:\n\"How's that for a plan?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Charles muttered. Kennedy beamed proudly as he repeated: \"Fine,\nfine,\" and sank to the ground, born down by the almost physical weight\nof his depression. His hoped-for ally was stark mad.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nKennedy turned out to have been an armorer-artificer of the North\nAmerican Navy, captured two years ago while deer-hunting too far from\nthe logging-camp road to New Portsmouth. Fed on scraps of gristle,\nisolated from his kind, beaten when he failed to make his daily task of\nspear heads and arrow points, he had shyly retreated into beautifully\ninterminable labyrinths of abstraction. Now and then, Charles Orsino got\na word or two of sense from him before the rosy clouds closed in. When\nattempted conversation with the lunatic palled, Charles could watch the\naborigines through chinks in the palisade. There were about fifty of\nthem. There would have been more if they hadn't been given to\ninfanticide--for what reason, Charles could not guess.\n\nHe had been there a week when the boulders were rolled away one morning\nand he was roughly called out. He said to Kennedy before stooping to\ncrawl through the hole: \"Take it easy, friend. I'll be back, I hope.\"\n\nKennedy looked up with a puzzled smile: \"That's such a _general_\nstatement, Charles. Exactly what are you implying--\"\n\nThe witch girl was there, flanked by spearmen. She said abruptly: \"I\nhave been listening to you. Why are you untrue to your brothers?\"\n\nHe gawked. The only thing that seemed to fit was: \"That's such a\n_general_ statement,\" but he didn't say it.\n\n\"Answer,\" one of the spearmen growled.\n\n\"I--I don't understand. I have no brothers.\"\n\n\"Your brothers in Portsmouth, on the sea. Whatever you call them, they\nare your brothers, all children of the mother called Government. Why are\nyou untrue to them?\"\n\nHe began to understand. \"They aren't my brothers. I'm not a child of the\ngovernment. I'm a child of another mother far away, called Syndic.\"\n\nShe looked puzzled--and almost human--for an instant. Then the visor\ndropped over her face again as she said: \"That is true. Now you must\nteach a certain person the jeep and the guns. Teach her well. See that\nshe gets her hands on the metal and into the grease.\" To a spearman she\nsaid: \"Bring Martha.\"\n\nThe spearman brought Martha, who was trying not to cry. She was a\nhalf-naked child of ten!\n\nThe witch girl abruptly left them. Her guards took Martha and bewildered\nCharles to the edge of the village where the jeep and its mounted guns\nstood behind a silly little museum exhibit rope of vine. Feathers and\nbones were knotted into the vine. The spearmen treated it as though it\nwere a high-tension transmission line.\n\n\"_You_ break it,\" one of them said to Charles. He did, and the spearmen\nsighed with relief. Martha stopped scowling and stared.\n\nThe spearman said to Charles: \"Go ahead and teach her. The firing pins\nare out of the guns, and if you try to start the jeep you get a spear\nthrough you. Now teach her.\" He and the rest squatted on the turf around\nthe jeep. The little girl shied violently as he took her hand, and tried\nto run away. One of the spearmen slung her back into the circle. She\nbrushed against the jeep and froze, white-faced.\n\n\"Martha,\" Charles said patiently, \"there's nothing to be afraid of. The\nguns won't go off and the jeep won't move. I'll teach you how to work\nthem so you can kill everybody you don't like with the guns and go\nfaster than a deer in the jeep--\"\n\nHe was talking into empty air as far as the child was concerned. She was\nmuttering, staring at the arm that had brushed the jeep: \"That did it, I\nguess. There goes the power. May the goddess blast her--no. The power's\nout of me now. I felt it go.\" She looked up at Charles, quite calmly,\nand said: \"Go on. Show me all about it. Do a good job.\"\n\n\"Martha, what are you talking about?\"\n\n\"She was afraid of me, my sister, so she's robbing me of the power.\nDon't you know? I guess not. The goddess hates iron and machines. I had\nthe power of the goddess in me, but it's gone now; I felt it go. Now\nnobody'll be afraid of me any more.\" Her face contorted and she said:\n\"Show me how you work the guns.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe taught her what he could while the circle of spearmen looked on and\ngrinned, cracking raw jokes about the child as anybody anywhere, would\nabout a tyrant deposed. She pretended to ignore them, grimly repeating\nnames after him and imitating his practiced movements in loading drill.\nShe was very bright, Charles realized. When he got a chance he muttered,\n\"I'm sorry about this, Martha. It isn't my idea.\"\n\nShe whispered bleakly: \"I know. I liked you. I was sorry when the other\noutsider took your dinner.\" She began to sob uncontrollably. \"I'll never\nsee anything again! Nobody'll ever be afraid of me again!\" She buried\nher face against Charles' shoulder.\n\nHe smoothed her tangled hair mechanically and said to the watching,\ngrinning circle: \"Look, hasn't this gone far enough? Haven't you got\nwhat you wanted?\"\n\nThe headman stretched and spat. \"Guess so,\" he said. \"Come on, girl.\" He\nyanked Martha from the seat and booted her toward the huts.\n\nCharles scrambled down just ahead of a spear. He let himself be led back\nto the smithy block house and shoved through the crawl hole.\n\n\"I was thinking about what you said the other day,\" Kennedy beamed,\nrasping a file over an arrowhead. \"When I said that to change one\nmolecule in the past you'd have to change _every_ molecule in the past,\nand you said, 'Maybe so.' I've figured that what you were driving at\nwas--\"\n\n\"Kennedy,\" Charles said, \"please shut up just this once. I've got to\nthink.\"\n\n\"In what sense do you mean that, Charles? Do you mean that you're a\nrational animal and therefore that your _being_ rather than _essense_\nis--\"\n\n\"_Shut up or I'll pick up a rock and bust your head in with it!_\"\nCharles roared. He more than half meant it. Kennedy hunched down before\nhis hearth looking offended and scared. Charles squatted with his head\nin his hands.\n\n_I have been listening to you._\n\nRepeated drives of the Government to wipe out the aborigines. Drives\nthat never succeeded.\n\n_I'll never see anything again._\n\nThe way the witch girl had blasted her rival--but that was suggestion.\nBut--\n\n_I have been listening to you. Why are you untrue to your brothers?_\n\nHe'd said nothing like that to anybody, not to her or poor Kennedy.\n\nHe thought vaguely of _psi_ force, a fragment in his memory. An old\nsuperstition, like the id-ego-superego triad of the sick-minded\npsychologists. Like vectors of the mind, exploded nonsense. But--\n\n_I have been listening to you. Why are you untrue to your brothers?_\n\nCharles smacked one fist against the sand floor in impotent rage. He was\ngoing as crazy as Kennedy. Did the witch girl--and Martha--have\nhereditary _psi_ power? He mocked himself savagely: that's such a\n_general_ question!\n\nNeurotic adolescent girls in kerosene-lit farmhouses, he thought\nvaguely. Things that go bump--and crash and blooie and _whoo-oo-oo!_ in\nthe night. Not in electric lit city apartments. Not around fleshed-up\nmiddle-aged men and women. You take a hyperthyroid virgin, isolate her\nfrom power machinery and electric fields, put on the pressures that make\nher feel alone and tense to the bursting point--and naturally enough,\nsomething bursts. A chamberpot sails from under the bed and shatters on\nthe skull of stepfather-tyrant. The wide-gilt-framed portrait of\nthundergod-grandfather falls with a crash. Sure, the nail crystallized\nand broke--_who crystallized it?_\n\nNeurotic adolescent girls speaking in tongues, reading face-down cards\nand closed books, screaming aloud when sister or mother dies in a\nrailroad wreck fifty miles away, of cancer a hundred miles away, in a\nbombing overseas.\n\nSometimes they made saints of them. Sometimes they burned them. Burned\nthem and _then_ made saints of them.\n\nA blood-raw hunk of venison came sailing through one of the loopholes\nand flopped on the sand.\n\n_I was sorry when the other outsider took your dinner._\n\nThree days ago he'd dozed off while Kennedy broiled the meat over the\nhearth. When he woke, Kennedy had gobbled it all and was whimpering with\napprehension. But he'd done nothing and said nothing; the man wasn't\nresponsible. He'd said nothing, and yet somehow the child knew about it.\n\nHis days were numbered; soon enough the jeep would be out of gas and the\nguns would be out of ammo or an unreplaceable part lost or broken. Then,\naccording to the serene logic that ruled the witch girl, he'd be\nsurplus.\n\nBut there was a key to it somehow.\n\nHe got up and slapped Kennedy's hand away from the venison. \"Naughty,\"\nhe said, and divided it equally with a broad spearblade.\n\n\"Naughty,\" Kennedy said morosely. \"The naught-class, the null-class. I'm\nthe null-class. I plus the universe equal one, the universe-class. If\nyou could transpose--but you can't transpose.\" Silently they toasted\ntheir venison over the fire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a moonless night with one great planet, Jupiter he supposed,\nreigning over the star-powdered sky. Kennedy slept muttering feebly in a\ncorner. The hearthfire was out. It had to be out by dark. The spearmen\ntook no chance of their trying to burn down the place. The village had\nlong since gone to sleep, campfires doused, skin flaps pulled to across\nthe door holes. From the corral one of the spavined, tick-ridden cows\nmooed uneasily and then fell silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharles then began the hardest job of his life. He tried to think,\nstraight and uninterrupted, of Martha, the little girl. Some of the\nthings that interrupted him were:\n\nThe remembered smell of fried onions; they didn't have onions here;\n\nSalt;\n\nI wonder how the old 101st Precinct's getting along;\n\nThat fellow who wanted to get married on a hundred dollars;\n\nLee Falcaro, damn her!\n\nThis, is damn foolishness; it can't possibly work;\n\nPoor old Kennedy;\n\nI'll starve before I eat another mouthful of that greasy deer-meat;\n\nThe Van Dellen kid, I wonder if I could have saved him;\n\nReiner's right; we've got to clean up the Government and then try to\ncivilize these people;\n\nThere must be something wrong with my head, I can't seem to\nconcentrate;\n\nThat terrific third-chukker play in the Finals, my picture all over\ntown;\n\nWould Uncle Frank laugh at this?\n\nIt was hopeless. He sat bolt upright, his eyes squeezed tensely\ntogether, trying to visualize the child and call her and it couldn't be\ndone. Skittering images of her zipped through his mind, only to be\nshoved aside. It was damn foolishness, anyway....\n\nHe unkinked himself, stretched and lay down on the sand floor thinking\nbitterly: why try? You'll be dead in a few days or a few weeks; kiss the\nworld good-bye. Back in Syndic Territory, fat, sloppy, happy Syndic\nTerritory, did they know how good they had it? He wished he could tell\nthem to cling to their good life. But Uncle Frank said it didn't do any\ngood to cling; it was a matter of tension and relaxation. When you\nstiffen up a way of life and try to fossilize it so it'll stay that way\nforever, then you find you've lost it.\n\nLittle Martha wouldn't understand it. Magic, ritual, the power of the\ngoddess, fear of iron, fear of the jeep's vine enclosure--cursed, no\ndoubt--what went on in such a mind? Could she throw things like a\npoltergeist-girl? They didn't have 'em any more; maybe it had something\nto do with electric fields or even iron. Or were they all phonies? An\nupset adolescent girl is a hell of a lot likelier to fake phenomena that\nproduce them. Little Martha hadn't been faking her despair, though. The\nwitch-girl--her sister, wasn't she?--didn't fake her icy calm and power.\nMartha'd be better off without such stuff--\n\n\"_Charles_,\" a whisper said.\n\nHe muttered stupidly: \"My God. She heard me,\" and crept to the palisade.\nThrough a chink between the logs she was just visible in the starlight.\n\nShe whispered: \"I thought I wasn't going to see anything or hear\nanything ever again but I sat up and I heard you calling and you said\nyou wanted to help me if I'd help you so I came as fast as I could\nwithout waking anybody up--you _did_ call me, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. Martha, do you want to get out of here? Go far away with\nme?\"\n\n\"You bet I do. _She's_ going to take the power of the goddess out of me\nand marry me to Dinny, he stinks like a goat and he has a cockeye, and\nthen she'll kill all our babies. Just tell me what to do and I'll do\nit.\" She sounded very grim and decided.\n\n\"Can you roll the boulders away from the hole there?\" He was thinking\nvaguely of teleportation; each boulder was a two-man job.\n\nShe said no.\n\nHe snarled: \"Then why did you bother to come here?\"\n\n\"Don't talk like that to me,\" the child said sharply--and he remembered\nwhat she thought she was.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said.\n\n\"What I came about,\" she said calmly, \"was the ex-plosion. Can you make\nan ex-plosion like you said? Back there at the jeep?\"\n\nWhat in God's name was she talking about?\n\n\"Back there,\" she said with exaggerated patience, \"you was thinking\nabout putting all the cartridges together and blowing up the whole damn\nshebang. Remember?\"\n\nHe did, vaguely. One of a hundred schemes that had drifted through his\nhead.\n\n\"I'd sure like to see that ex-plosion,\" she said. \"The way _she_ got\nthings figured, I'd almost just as soon get exploded myself as not.\"\n\n\"I might blow up the logs here and get out,\" he said slowly. \"I think\nyou'd be a mighty handy person to have along, too. Can you get me about\na hundred of the machine gun cartridges?\"\n\n\"They'll miss 'em.\"\n\n\"Sneak me a few at a time. I'll empty them, put them together again and\nyou sneak them back.\"\n\nShe said, slow and troubled: \"_She_ set the power of the goddess to\nguard them.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Martha,\" he said. \"I mean _listen_. You'll be doing it\nfor me and they told me the power of the goddess doesn't work on\noutsiders. Isn't that right?\"\n\nThere was a long pause, and she said at last with a sigh: \"I sure wish I\ncould see your eyes, Charles. I'll try it, but I'm damned if I would if\nDinny didn't stink so bad.\" She slipped away and Charles tried to follow\nher with his mind through the darkness, to the silly little rope of vine\nwith the feathers and bones knotted in it--but he couldn't. Too tense\nagain.\n\nKennedy stirred and muttered complainingly as an icy small breeze cut\nthrough the chinks of the palisade, whispering.\n\nHis eyes, tuned to the starlight, picked up Martha bent almost double,\ncreeping toward the smithy-prison. She wore a belt of fifty-caliber\ncartridges around her neck like a stole. Looked like about a dozen of\nthem. He hastily scooped out a bowl of clean sand and whispered: \"Any\ntrouble?\"\n\nHe couldn't see the grin on her face, but knew it was there. \"It was\neasy,\" she bragged. \"One bad minute and then I checked with you and it\nwas okay.\"\n\n\"Good kid. Pull the cartridges out of the links the way I showed you and\npass them through.\"\n\nShe did. It was a tight squeeze.\n\nHe fingered one of the cartridges. The bullet fitted nicely into the\nsocket of an arrowhead. He jammed the bullet in and wrenched at the\narrowhead with thumb and forefinger--all he could get onto it. The brass\nneck began to spread. He dumped the powder into his little basin in the\nsand and reseated the bullet.\n\nCharles shifted hands on the second cartridge. On the third he realized\nthat he could put the point of the bullet on a hearth-stone and press on\nthe neck with both thumbs. It went faster then; in perhaps an hour he\nwas passing the re-assembled cartridges back through the palisade.\n\n\"Time for another load?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nope,\" the girl said. \"Tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Good kid.\"\n\nShe giggled. \"It's going to be a hell of a big bang, ain't it, Charles?\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\n\"Leave the fire alone,\" Charles said sharply to Kennedy. The little man\nwas going to douse it for the night.\n\nThere was a flash of terrified sense: \"They beat you. If the fire's on\nafter dark they beat you. Fire and dark are equal and opposite.\" He\nbegan to smile. \"Fire is the negative of dark. You just change the sign,\nin effect rotate it through 180 degrees. But to rotate it through 180\ndegrees you have to first rotate it through one degree. And to rotate it\nthrough one degree you first have to rotate it through half a degree.\"\nHe was beaming now, having forgotten all about the fire. Charles banked\nit with utmost care, heaping a couple of flat stones for a chimney that\nwould preserve the life of one glowing coal invisibly.\n\nHe stretched out on the sand, one hand on the little heap beneath which\nfive pounds of smokeless powder was buried. Kennedy continued to drone\nout his power-series happily.\n\nThrough the chinks in the palisade a man's profile showed against the\ntwilight. \"Shut up,\" he said.\n\nKennedy shivering, rolled over and muttered to himself. The spearman\nlaughed and went on.\n\nCharles hardly saw him. His whole mind was concentrated on the spark\nbeneath the improvised chimney. He had left such a spark seven nights\nrunning. Only twice had it lived more than an hour. Tonight--tonight,\nit _had_ to last. Tonight was the last night of the witch-girl's monthly\ncourses, and during them she lost--or thought she lost, which was the\nsame thing--the power of the goddess.\n\nPrimitive aborigines, he jeered silently at himself. A life time wasn't\nlong enough to learn the intricacies of their culture--as occasional\nexecutions among them for violating magical law proved to the hilt. His\nfirst crude notion--blowing the palisade apart and running like\nhell--was replaced by a complex escape plan hammered out in detail\nbetween him and Martha.\n\nMartha assured him that the witch girl could track him through the dark\nby the power of the goddess except for four days a month--and he\nbelieved it. Martha herself laid a matter-of-fact claim to keener second\nsight than her sister because of her virginity. With Martha to guide him\nthrough the night and the witch-girl's power disabled, they'd get a\nday's head start. His hand strayed to a pebble under which jerked\nvenison was hidden and ready.\n\n\"But Martha. Are you sure you're not--not kidding yourself? Are you\n_sure_?\"\n\nHe felt her grin on the other side of the palisade. \"You're sure wishing\nUncle Frank was here so you could ask him about it, don't you, Charles?\"\n\nHe sure was. He wiped his brow, suddenly clammy.\n\nKennedy couldn't come along. One, he wasn't responsible. Two, he might\nhave to be Charles' cover-story. They weren't too dissimilar in build,\nage, or coloring. Charles had a beard by now that sufficiently obscured\nhis features, and two years absence should have softened recollections\nof Kennedy. Interrogated, Charles could take refuge in an imitation of\nKennedy's lunacy.\n\n\"Charles, the one thing I don't get is this Lee dame. She got a spell on\nher? You don't want to mess with that.\"\n\n\"Listen, Martha, we've _got_ to mess with her. It isn't a\nspell--exactly. Anyway I know how to take it off and then she'll be on\nour side.\"\n\n\"Can I set off the explosion? If you let me set off the explosion, I'll\nquit my bitching.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" he said.\n\nShe chuckled very faintly in the dark. \"Okay,\" she told him. \"If I\ncan't, I can't.\"\n\nHe thought of being married to a woman who could spot your smallest lie\nor reservation, and shuddered.\n\nKennedy was snoring by now and twilight was deepening into blackness.\nThere was a quarter-moon, obscured by over-cast. He hitched along the\nsand and peered through a chink at a tiny noise. It was the small\nscuffling feet of a woods-rat racing through the grass from one morsel\nof food to the next. It never reached it. There was a soft rush of wings\nas a great dark owl plummeted to earth and struck talons into the brown\nfur. The rat squealed its life away while the owl lofted silently to a\ntree branch where it stood on one leg, swaying drunkenly and staring\nwith huge yellow eyes.\n\nAs sudden as that, it'll be, Charles thought abruptly weighted with\ndespair. A half-crazy kid and yours truly trying to outsmart and\nout-Tarzan these wild men. If only the little dope would let me take the\njeep! But the jeep was out. She rationalized her retention of the power\neven after handling iron by persuading herself that she was only acting\nfor Charles; there was some obscure precedent in a long, memorized poem\nwhich served her as a text-book of magic. But riding in the jeep was\n_out_.\n\nBy now she should be stringing magic vines across some of the huts and\ntrails. \"They'll see 'em when they get torches and it'll scare 'em. Of\ncourse I don't know how to do it right, but they don't know that. It'll\nslow 'em down. If _she_ comes out of her house--and maybe she\nwon't--she'll know they don't matter and send the men after us. But\nwe'll be on our way. Charles, you _sure_ I can't set off the explosion?\nYeah, I guess you are. Maybe I can set off one when we get to New\nPortsmouth?\"\n\n\"If I can possibly arrange it.\"\n\nShe sighed: \"I guess that'll have to do.\"\n\nIt was too silent; he couldn't bear it. With feverish haste he uncovered\nthe caches of powder and meat. Under the sand was a fat clayey soil. He\ndug up hands-full of it, wet it with the only liquid available and\nworked it into paste. He felt his way to the logs decided on for\nblasting, dug out a hole at their bases in the clay. After five careful\ntrips from the powder cache to the hole, the mine was filled. He covered\nit with clay and laid on a roof of flat stones from the hearth. The\nspark of fire still glowed, and he nursed it with twigs.\n\nShe was there, whispering: \"Charles?\"\n\n\"Right here. Everything set?\"\n\n\"All set. Let's have that explosion.\"\n\nHe took the remaining powder and with minute care, laid a train across\nthe stockade to the mine. He crouched into a ball and flipped a burning\ntwig onto the black line that crossed the white sand floor.\n\nThe blast seemed to wake up the world. Kennedy charged out of sleep,\nscreaming, and a million birds woke with a squawk. Charles was conscious\nmore of the choking reek than the noise as he scooped up the jerked\nvenison and rushed through the ragged gap in the wall. A hand caught\nhis--a small hand.\n\n\"You're groggy,\" Martha's voice said, sounding far away. \"Come on--fast.\n_Man_, that was a great ex-plosion!\"\n\nShe towed him through the woods and underbrush--fast. As long as he hung\non to her he didn't stumble or run into a tree once. Irrationally\nembarrassed by his dependence on a child, he tried letting go for a\nshort time--very short--and was quickly battered into changing his mind.\nHe thought dizzily of the spearmen trying to follow through the dark and\ncould almost laugh again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir trek to the coast was marked by desperate speed. For twenty-four\nhours, they stopped only to gnaw at their rations or snatch a drink at a\nstream. Charles kept moving because it was unendurable to let a\nten-year-old girl exceed him in stamina. Both of them paid terribly for\nthe murderous pace they kept. The child's face became skull-like and her\neyes red; her lips dried and cracked. He gasped at her as they pulled\ntheir way up a bramble-covered 45-degree slope: \"How do you do it? Isn't\nthis ever going to end?\"\n\n\"Ends soon,\" she croaked at him. \"You know we dodged 'em three times?\"\n\nHe could only shake his head.\n\nShe stared at him with burning red eyes. \"This ain't hard,\" she croaked.\n\"You do this with a gut-full of poison, _that's_ hard.\"\n\n\"_Did_ you?\"\n\nShe grinned crookedly and chanted something he did not understand:\n\n    \"_Nine moons times thirteen is the daughter's age\n      When she drinks the death-cup.\n    Three leagues times three she must race and rage\n      Down hills and up_--\"\n\nShe added matter-of-factly: \"Last year. Prove I have the power of the\ngoddess. Run, climb, with your guts falling out. This year, starve for a\nweek and run down a deer of seven points.\"\n\nHe had lost track of days and nights when they stood on the brow of a\nhill at dawn and looked over the sea. The girl gasped: \"'Sall right now.\n_She_ wouldn't let them go on. She's a bitch, but she's no fool.\" The\nchild fell in her tracks. Charles, too tired for panic, slept too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharles woke with a wonderful smell in his nostrils. He followed it\nhungrily down the reverse slope of the hill to a grotto.\n\nMartha was crouched over a fire on which rocks were heating. Beside it\nwas a bark pot smeared with clay. As he watched, she lifted a red-hot\nrock with two green sticks and rolled it into the pot. It boiled up and\ncontinued to boil for an astonishing number of minutes. That was the\nsource of the smell.\n\n\"Breakfast?\" he asked unbelievingly.\n\n\"Rabbit stew,\" she said. \"Plenty of runways, plenty of bark, plenty of\ngreen branches. I made snares. Two tough old bucks cooking in there for\nan hour.\"\n\nThey chewed the meat from the bones in silence. She said at last: \"We\ncan't settle down here. Too near to the coast. And if we move further\ninland, there's _her_. And others. I been thinking.\" She spat a string\nof tough meat out. \"There's England. Work our way around the coast. Make\na raft or steal a canoe and cross the water. _Then_ we could settle\ndown. You can't have me for three times thirteen moons yet or I'd lose\nthe power. But I guess we can wait. I heard about England and the\nEnglish. They have no hearts left. We can take as many slaves as we\nwant. They cry a lot but they don't fight. And none of their women has\nthe power.\" She looked up anxiously. \"You wouldn't want one of their\nwomen, would you? Not if you could have somebody with the power just by\nwaiting for her?\"\n\nHe looked down the hill and said slowly: \"You know that's not what I had\nin mind, Martha. I have my own place with people far away. I want to get\nback there. I thought--I thought you'd like it too.\" Her face twisted.\nHe couldn't bear to go on, not in words. \"Look into my mind, Martha,\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe you'll see what it means to me.\"\n\nShe stared long and deep. At last she rose, her face inscrutable, and\nspat into the fire. \"Think I saved you for that?\" she asked. \"And for\n_her_? Not me. Save yourself from now on, mister. I'm going to beat my\nway south around the coast. England for me, and I don't want any part of\nyou.\"\n\nShe strode off down the hill, gaunt and ragged, but with arrogance in\nher swinging, space-eating gait. Charles sat looking after her,\nstupefied, until she had melted into the underbrush. \"Think I saved you\nfor that? And for _her_?\" She'd made some kind of mistake. He got up\nstiffly and ran after her, but he could not pick up an inch of her\nwoods-wise trail. Charles slowly climbed to the grotto again and sat in\nits shelter.\n\nHe spent the morning trying to concoct simple springs out of bark strips\nand whippy branches. He got nowhere. The branches broke or wouldn't bend\nfar enough. The bark shredded, or wouldn't hold a knot. Without metal,\nhe couldn't shape the trigger to fit the bow so that it would be both\nsensitive and reliable.\n\nAt noon he drank enormously from a spring and looked morosely for plants\nthat might be edible. He decided on something with a bulbous, onion-like\nroot. For a couple of hours after that he propped rocks on sticks here\nand there. When he stepped back and surveyed them, he decided that any\nrabbit he caught with them would be, even for a rabbit, feeble-minded.\nHe could think of nothing else to do.\n\nFirst he felt a slight intestinal qualm and then a far from slight\nnausea. Then the root he had eaten took over with drastic thoroughness.\nHe collapsed, retching, and only after the first spasms had passed was\nhe able to crawl to the grotto. The shelter it offered was mostly\npsychological, but he had need of that. Under the ancient, mossy stones,\nhe raved with delirium until dark.\n\nSometimes he was back in Syndic Territory, Charles Orsino of the\ntwo-goal handicap and the flashing smile. Sometimes he was back in the\nstinking blockhouse with Kennedy spinning interminable, excruciatingly\nboring strands of iridescent logic. Sometimes he was back in the\npsychology laboratory with the pendulum beating, the light blinking, the\nbell ringing and sense-impressions flooding him and drowning him with\nlies. Sometimes he raced in panic down the streets of New Portsmouth\nwith sweatered Guardsmen pounding after him, their knives flashing fire.\n\nBut at last he was in the grotto again, with Martha sponging his head\nand cursing him in a low, fluent undertone for being seven times seven\nkinds of fool.\n\nShe said tartly as recognition came into his eyes: \"Yes, for the fifth\ntime, I'm back. I should be making my way to England and a band of my\nown, but I'm back and I don't know why. I heard you in pain and I\nthought it served you right for not knowing deathroot when you see it,\nbut I turned around and came back.\"\n\n\"Don't go,\" he said hoarsely.\n\nShe held a bark cup to his lips and made him choke down some nauseating\nbrew. \"Don't worry,\" she told him bitterly. \"I won't go. I'll do\neverything you want, which shows that I'm as big a fool as you are, or\nbigger because I know better. I'll help you find her and take the spell\noff her. And may the goddess help me because I can't help myself.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"... things like sawed tree-trunks, shells you call them ... a pile of\nthem ... he looks at them and he thinks they're going bad and they ought\nto be used soon ... under a wooden roof they are ... a thin man with\ndeath on his face and hate in his heart ... he wears blue and gold ...\nhe sticks the gold, you call a coat's wrist the cuff, he sticks the cuff\nunder the nose of a fellow and yells his hate out and the fellow feels\nready to strangle on blood ... it's about a boat that sank ... this\nfellow, he's a fat little man and he kills and kills, he'd kill the man\nif he could....\"\n\nA picket boat steamed by the coast twice a day, north after dawn and\nsouth before sunset.

Her eyes didn't see Charles. He drew\nback one hand and slammed it across her cheek in a slap that\nreverberated like a pistol shot. Her head rocked to the blow and her\neyes snapped back from infinity-focus.\n\nShe never told Charles what they had done to the sick slave in the\nmachine shop, and he never asked her.\n\nWithout writing equipment, for crutches, Charles doubted profoundly that\nhe'd be able to hang onto any of the material she supplied. He\nsurprised himself; his memory developed with exercise.\n\nThe shadowy ranks of the New Portsmouth personnel became solider daily\nin his mind; the chronically-fatigued ordnance-man whose mainspring was\nto get by with the smallest possible effort; the sex-obsessed little man\nin Intelligence who lived only for the brothels where he selected older\nwomen--women who looked like his mother; the human weasel in BuShips who\nwas impotent in bed and a lacerating tyrant in the office; the admiral\nwho knew he was dying and hated his juniors proportionately to their\nyouth and health.\n\nAnd--\n\n\"... this woman of yours ... she ain't at home there ... she ain't\nat ... at home ... _anywhere_. ... the fat man, the one that kills,\nhe's talking to her but she isn't ... yes she is ... no she isn't--she's\nanswering him, talking about over-the-sea....\"\n\n\"Lee Falcaro,\" Charles whispered. \"Lee Bennet.\"\n\nThe trance-frozen face didn't change; the eerie whisper went on without\ninterruption: \"... Lee Bennet on her lips, Lee Falcaro down deep in her\nguts ... and the face of Charles Orsino down there too....\"\n\nAn unexpected pang went through him.\n\nHe sorted and classified endlessly what he had learned. He formed and\nrejected a dozen plans. At last there was one he could not reject.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nCommander Grinnel was officer of the day, and sore as a boil about it.\nO.N.I. wasn't supposed to catch the duty. You risked your life on\ncloak-and-dagger missions; let the shore-bound fancy dans do the\ndrudgery. But there he was, nevertheless, in the guard house office with\na .45 on his hip, the interminable night stretching before him, and the\nten-man main guard snoring away outside.\n\nHe eased his bad military conscience by reflecting that there wasn't\nanything to guard, that patrolling the shore establishment was just worn\nout tradition. The ships and boats had their own watch. At the very\nfurthest stretch of the imagination, a tarzan might sneak into town and\ntry to steal some ammo. Well, if he got caught he got caught. And if he\ndidn't, who'd know the difference with the accounting as sloppy as it\nwas here? They did things differently in Iceland.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey crept through the midnight dark of New Portsmouth's outskirts. As\nbefore, she led with her small hand. Lights flared on a wharf where,\nperhaps, a boat was being serviced. A slave screamed somewhere under the\nlash or worse.\n\n\"Here's the doss house,\" Martha whispered. It was smack between\npaydays--part of the plan--and the house was dark except for the\nhopefully-lit parlor. They ducked down the alley that skirted it and\naround the back of Bachelor Officer Quarters. The sentry, if he were\ngoing his rounds at all, would be at the other end of his post when they\npassed--part of the plan.\n\nLee Falcaro was quartered alone in a locked room of the O.N.I. building.\nMartha had, from seventy miles away, frequently watched the lock being\nopened and closed.\n\nThey dove under the building's crumbling porch two minutes before a late\ncrowd of drinkers roared down the street and emerged when they were\nsafely gone. There was a charge of quarters, a little yeoman, snoozing\nunder a dim light in the O.N.I. building's lobby.\n\n\"Anybody else?\" Charles whispered edgily.\n\n\"No. Just her. She's asleep. Dreaming about--never mind. Come on\nCharles. He's out.\"\n\nThe little yeoman didn't stir as they passed him and crept up the\nstairs. Lee Falcaro's room was part of the third-floor attic, finished\noff specially. You reached it by a ladder from a second-floor one-man\noffice.\n\nThe lock was an eight-button piccolo--very rare in New Portsmouth and\npresumably loot from the mainland. Charles' fingers flew over it:\n1-7-5-4-, 2-2-7-3-, 8-2-6-6- and it flipped open silently.\n\nBut the door squeaked.\n\n\"She's waking up!\" Martha hissed in the dark. \"She'll yell!\"\n\nCharles reached the bed in two strides and clamped his hand over Lee\nFalcaro-Bennet's mouth. Only a feeble \"mmm!\" came out, but the girl\nthrashed violently in his grip.\n\n\"Shut up, lady!\" Martha whispered. \"Nobody's going to rape you.\"\n\nThere was an astonished \"mmm?\" and she subsided, trembling.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Martha told him. \"She won't yell.\"\n\nHe took his hand away nervously. \"We've come to administer the oath of\ncitizenship,\" he said.\n\nThe girl answered in the querulous voice that was hardly hers: \"You\npicked a strange time for it. Who are you? What's all the whispering\nfor?\"\n\nHe improvised. \"I'm Commander Lister. Just in from Iceland aboard atom\nsub _Taft_. They didn't tell you in case it got turned down, but I was\nsent for authorization to give you citizenship. You know how unusual it\nis for a woman.\"\n\n\"Who's this child? And why did you get me up in the dead of night?\"\n\nHe dipped deeply into Martha's probings of the past week.\n\"Citizenship'll make the Guard Intelligence gang think twice before they\ntry to grab you again. Naturally they'd try to block us if we\nadministered the oath in public. Ready?\"\n\n\"Dramatic,\" she sneered. \"Oh, I suppose so. Get it over with.\"\n\n\"Do you, Lee Bennet, solemnly renounce all allegiances previously held\nby you and pledge your allegiance to the North American Government?\"\n\n\"I do,\" she said.\n\nThere was a choked little cry from Martha. \"Hell's fire,\" she said.\n\"Like breaking a leg!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, little girl?\" Lee asked, coldly alert.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Charles said wearily. \"Don't you know my voice? I'm\nOrsino. You turned me in back there because they don't give, citizenship\nto women and so your de-conditioning didn't get triggered off. I managed\nto break for the woods. A bunch of natives got me. I busted loose with\nthe help of Martha here. Among her other talents, the kid's a mind\nreader. I remember the triggering shocked me out of a year's growth; how\ndo you feel?\"\n\nLee was silent, but Martha answered in a voice half puzzled and half\ncontemptuous: \"She feels fine, but she's crying.\"\n\n\"Am not,\" Lee Falcaro gulped.\n\nCharles turned from her, embarrassed. In a voice that strove to be\nnormal, he whispered to Martha: \"What about the boat?\"\n\n\"Still there,\" she said.\n\nLee Falcaro said tremulously: \"Wh-wh-what boat?\"\n\n\"Martha's staked out a reactor-driven patrol speedboat at a wharf. One\nguard aboard. She--watched it in operation and I have some small-boat\ntime. I really think we can grab it. If we get a good head-start, they\ndon't have anything based here that'll catch up with it. If we get a\nbreak on the weather, their planes won't be able to pick us up.\"\n\nLee Falcaro stood up, dashing tears from her eyes. \"Then let's go,\" she\nsaid evenly.\n\n\"How's the C.Q.--that man downstairs, Martha?\"\n\n\"Still sleepin'. The way's as clear now as it'll ever be.\"\n\nThey closed the door behind them and Charles worked the lock. The Charge\nof Quarters looked as though he couldn't be roused by anything less\nthan an earthquake as they passed--but Martha stumbled on one of the\nrotting steps after they were outside the building.\n\n\"Patrick and Bridget rot my clumsy feet off!\" she whispered. \"He's\nawake.\"\n\n\"Under the porch,\" Charles said. They crawled into the dank space\nbetween porch floor and ground. Martha kept up a scarcely-audible\nvolleyfire of maledictions aimed at herself.\n\nWhen they stopped abruptly Charles knew it was bad.\n\nMartha held up her hand for silence, and Charles imagined in the dark\nthat he could see the strained and eerie look of her face. After a pause\nshe whispered: \"He's using the--what do you call it? You talk and\nsomebody hears you far away? A prowler he says to them. A wild man from\nthe woods. The bitches bastard must have seen you in your handsome suit\nof skin and dirt, Charles. Oh, we're _for_ it! May my toe that stumbled\ngrow the size of a boulder! May my cursed eyes that didn't see the step\nfall out!\"\n\nThey huddled down in the darkness and Charles took Lee Falcaro's hand\nreassuringly. It was cold. A moment later his other hand was taken, with\ngrim possessiveness, by the child.\n\nMartha whispered: \"The fat little man. The man who kills, Charles.\"\n\nHe nodded. He thought he had recognized Grinnel from her picture.\n\n\"And ten men waking up. Charles, do you remember the way to the wharf?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"But we're net going to get separated.\"\n\n\"They're mean, mad men,\" she said. \"Bloody-minded. And the little man is\nthe worst.\"\n\nThey heard the stomping feet and a babble of voices, and Commander\nGrinnel's clear, fat-man's tenor: \"Keep it quiet, men. He may still be\nin the area.\" The feet thundered over their heads on the porch.\n\nIn the barest of whispers Martha said: \"The man that slept tells them\nthere was only one, and he didn't see what he was like except for the\nbare skin and the long hair. And the fat man says they'll find him\nand--and--and says they'll find him.\" Her hand clutched Charles'\ndesperately and then dropped it as the feet thudded overhead again.\n\nGrinnel was saying: \"Half of you head up the street and half down. Check\nthe alleys, check open window--hell, I don't have to tell you. If we\ndon't find the bastard on the first run we'll have to wake up the whole\nGuard Battalion and patrol the whole base with them all the goddam\nnight, so keep your eyes open. Take off.\"\n\n\"Remember the way to the wharf, Charles,\" Martha said. \"Good-bye lady.\nTake care of him. Take good care of him.\" She wrenched her hand away and\ndarted out from under the porch.\n\nLee muttered some agonized monosyllable. Charles started out after the\nchild instinctively and then collapsed weakly back onto the dirt. They\nheard the rest.\n\n\"Hey, you--it's him, by God! Get him! Get him!\"\n\n\"Here he is, down here! Head him off!\"\n\n\"Over there!\" Grinnel yelled. \"Head him off! Head him--good work!\"\n\n\"For God's sake. It's a girl.\"\n\n\"Those goddam yeomen and their goddam prowlers.\"\n\nGrinnel: \"Where are you from, kid?\"\n\n\"That's no kid from the base, commander. Look at her!\"\n\n\"I just was, sarge. Looks good to me, don't it to you?\"\n\nGrinnel, tolerant, fatherly, amused: \"Now, men, have your fun but keep\nit quiet.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid, kid--\" There was an animal howl from Martha's throat\nthat made Lee Falcaro shake hysterically and Charles grind his\nfingernails into his palms.\n\nGrinnel: \"Sergeant, you'd better tie your shirt around her head and take\nher into the O.N.I. building.\"\n\n\"Why, commander! And let that lousy little yeoman in on it?\"\n\nGrinnel, amused, a good Joe, a man's man: \"That's up to you, men. Just\nkeep it quiet.\"\n\n\"Why, commander, sometimes I like to make a little noise--\"\n\n\"Ow!\" a man yelled. There was a scuffle of feet and babbling voices.\n\"Get her, you damn fool!\" \"She bit my hand--\" \"There she goes--\" and a\nsingle emphatic shot.\n\nGrinnel's voice said into the silence that followed: \"That's that, men.\"\n\n\"Did you _have_ to shoot, Commander?\" an aggrieved Guardsman said.\n\n\"Don't blame me, fellow. Blame the guy that let her go.\"\n\n\"God-dammit, she bit me--\"\n\nSomebody said as though he didn't mean it: \"We ought to take her\nsomeplace.\"\n\n\"The hell with that. Let 'em get her in the morning.\"\n\n\"Them as wants her.\" A cackle of harsh laughter.\n\nGrinnel, tolerantly: \"Back to the guardhouse, men. And keep it quiet.\"\n\nThey scuffled off and there was silence again for long minutes. Charles\nsaid at last: \"We'll go down to the wharf.\" They crawled out and looked\nfor a moment from the shelter of the building at the bundle lying in the\nroad.\n\nLee muttered: \"Grinnel.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Charles said. He led her down deserted alleys and around\nempty corners, strictly according to plan.\n\nThe speedboat was a twenty-foot craft at Wharf Eighteen, bobbing on the\nwater safely removed from other moored boats and ships. Lee Falcaro let\nout a small, smothered shriek when she saw a uniformed sailor sitting in\nthe cockpit, apparently staring directly at them.\n\n\"It's all right,\" Charles said. \"He's a drunk. He's always out cold by\nthis time of night.\" Smoothly Charles found the rope locker, cut lengths\nwith the sailor's own knife and bound and gagged him. The man's eyes\nopened, weary, glazed and red while this was going on and closed again.\n\"Help me lug him ashore,\" Charles said. Lee Falcaro took the sailor's\nlegs and they eased him onto the wharf.\n\nThey went back into the cockpit. \"This is deep water,\" Charles said, \"so\nyou'll have no trouble with pilotage. You can read a compass and charts.\nThere's an automatic dead reckoner. My advice is just to pull the\nmoderator rods out quarter-speed, point the thing west, pull the rods\nout as far as they'll go--and relax. Either they'll overtake you or they\nwon't.\"\n\nShe was beginning to get the drift. She said nervously: \"You're talking\nas though you're not coming along.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" he said, playing the lock of the arms rack. The bar fell\naside and he pulled a .45 pistol from its clamp. He thought back and\nremembered where the boat's diminutive magazine was located, broke the\nfeeble lock and found a box of short, fat, heavy little cartridges. He\nbegan to snap them into the pistol's magazine.\n\n\"What do you think you're up to?\" Lee Falcaro demanded.\n\n\"Appointment with Commander Grinnel,\" he said. He slid the heavy\nmagazine into the pistol's grip and worked the slide to jack a cartridge\ninto the chamber.\n\n\"Shall I cast off for you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" she said. \"You sound like a revival of a Mickey\nSpillane comedy. You can't bring her back to life and you've got a job\nto do for the Syndic.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" he said, and snapped another of the blunt, fat, little\ncartridges into the magazine.\n\nShe cast off, reached for the moderator-rod control and pulled it hard.\n\n\"Gee,\" he gasped, \"you'll sink us!\" and dashed for the controls. You had\nseconds before the worm-gears turned, the cadmium rods withdrew from\ntheir slots, the reactor seethed and sent boiling metal cycling through\nthe turbine--\n\nHe slammed down manual levers that threw off the fore and aft mooring\nlines, spun the wheel, bracing himself, and saw Lee Falcaro go down to\nthe deck in a tangle, the .45 flying from her hand and skidding across\nthe knurled plastic planking. But by then the turbine was screaming an\nalarm to the whole base and they were cutting white water through the\nbuoy-marked gap in the harbor net.\n\nLee Falcaro got to her feet. \"I'm not proud of myself,\" she said to him.\n\"But she told me to take care of you.\"\n\nHe said grimly: \"We could have gone straight to the wharf without that\nlittle layover to pick you up. Take the wheel.\"\n\n\"Charles, I--\"\n\nHe snarled at her.\n\n\"_Take the wheel._\"\n\nShe did, and he went aft to stare through the darkness. The harbor\nlights were twinkling pin-points; then his eyes misted so he could not\nsee them at all. He didn't give a damn if a dozen corvettes were already\nslicing the bay in pursuit. He had failed.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nIt was a dank fog-shrouded morning. Sometime during the night the quill\nof the dead reckoner had traced its fine red line over the 30th\nmeridian. Roughly half-way, Charles Orsino thought, rubbing the sleep\nfrom his eyes. But the line was straight as a string for the last four\nhours of their run. The damn girl must have fallen asleep on watch. He\nglared at her in the bow and broke open a ration. Blandly oblivious to\nthe glare, she said: \"Good morning.\"\n\nCharles swallowed a mouthful of chocolate, half-chewed, and choked on\nit. He reached hastily for water and found the tall plastic column of\nthe ion-exchange apparatus empty. \"Damn it,\" he snarled, \"why didn't you\nrefill this thing when you emptied it? And why didn't you zig-zag\novernight? You're utterly irresponsible.\" He hurled the bucket overside,\nhauled it up and slopped seawater into the apparatus. Now there'd be a\ngood twenty minutes before a man-sized drink accumulated.\n\n\"Just a minute,\" she told him steadily. \"Let's straighten this out. I\nhaven't had any water on the night watch so I didn't have any occasion\nto refill the tube. You must have taken the last of the water with your\ndinner. And as for the zig-zag, you said we should run a straightaway\nnow and then to mix it up. I decided that last night was as good a time\nas any.\"\n\nHe took a minute drink from the reservoir, stalling. There was\nsomething--yes; he had _meant_ to refill the apparatus after his dinner\nration. And he _had_ told her to give it a few hours of straightaway\nsome night....\n\nHe said formally: \"You're quite right on both counts. I apologize.\" He\nbit into a ration.\n\n\"That's not good enough,\" she said. \"I'm not going to have you tell me\nyou're sorry and then go scowling and sulking about the boat. In fact I\ndon't like your behavior at all.\"\n\nHe said, enormously angry: \"_Oh, you don't do you?_\" and hated her, the\nworld and himself for the stupid inadequacy of the comeback.\n\n\"No. I don't. I'm seriously worried. I'm afraid the conditioning you got\ndidn't fall away completely when they swore you in. You've been acting\nirrationally and inconsistently.\"\n\n\"What about you?\" he snapped. \"You got conditioned too.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"That's another reason why you're worrying me.\nI find impulses in myself that have no business there. I simply seem to\ndo a better job of controlling them than you're doing. For instance:\nwe've been quarreling and at cross-purposes ever since you and Martha\npicked me up. That couldn't be unless I were contributing to the\nfriction.\"\n\nThe wheel was fixed; she took a step or two aft and said professorially:\n\"I've never had trouble getting along with people. I've had differences,\nof course, and at times I've allowed myself displays of temper when it\nwas necessary to assert myself. But I find that you upset me; that for\nsome reason or other your opinion on a matter is important to me, that\nif it differs with mine there should be a reconciliation.\"\n\nHe put down the ration and said wonderingly: \"Do you know, that's the\nway I feel about you? And you think it's the conditioning or--or\nsomething?\" He took a couple of steps forward, hesitantly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said in a rather tremulous voice. \"The conditioning or\nsomething. For instance, you're inhibited. You haven't made an indecent\nproposition to me, not even as a matter of courtesy. Not that I care, of\ncourse, but--\" In stepping aft, she tripped over the water bucket and\nwent down to the deck with a faint scream.\n\nHe said: \"Here, let me help you.\" He picked her up and didn't let go.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she said faintly. \"The conditioning technique can't be called\nfaulty, but it has inherent limitations....\" She trailed off and he\nkissed her. She kissed back and said more faintly still: \"Or it might be\nthe drugs we used.... Oh, Charles, what _took_ you so long?\"\n\nHe said, brooding: \"You're way out of my class, you know. I'm just a\nbagman for the New York police. I wouldn't even be that if it weren't\nfor Uncle Frank, and you're a Falcaro. It's just barely thinkable that I\ncould make a pass at you. I guess that held me off and I didn't want to\nadmit it so I got mad at you instead. Hell, I could have swum back to\nthe base and made a damned fool of myself trying to find Grinnel, but\ndown inside I knew better. The kid's _gone_.\"\n\n\"We'll make a psychologist of you yet,\" she said.\n\n\"Psychologist? Why? You're joking.\"\n\n\"No. It's not a joke. You'll _like_ psychology, darling. You can't go on\nplaying polo forever, you know.\"\n\nDarling! What was he getting into? Old man Gilby was four-goal at sixty,\nwasn't he? Good God, was he hooked into marriage at twenty-three? Was\nshe married already? Did she know or care whether he was? Had she been\npromiscuous? Would she continue to be? He'd never know; that was the one\nthing you never asked; your only comfort, if you needed comfort, was\nthat she could never dream of asking you. What went on here? Let me out!\n\nIt went through his mind in a single panicky flash and then he said:\n\"The hell with it,\" and kissed her again.\n\nShe wanted to know: \"The hell with what, darling?\"\n\n\"Everything. Tell me about psychology. I can't go on playing polo\nforever.\"\n\nIt was an hour before she got around to telling him about psychology:\n\"The neglect has been criminal--and inexplicable. For about a century\nit's been _assumed_ that psychology is a dead fallacy. Why?\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said amiably, playing with a lock of her hair. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Lieberman,\" she said. \"Lieberman of Johns-Hopkins. He was one of the\nold-line topological psychology men--don't let the lingo throw you,\nCharles; it's just the name of a system. He wrote an attack on\nthe _mengenlehre_ psychology school--point-sets of emotions,\nclass-inclusions of reactions and so on. He blasted them to bits by\nproving that their constructs didn't correspond to the emotions and\nreactions of random-sampled populations. And then came the pay-off: he\ntried the same acid test on his _own_ school's constructs and found out\nthat they didn't correspond either. It didn't frighten him; he was a\nscientist. He published, and then the jig was up. Everybody, from full\nprofessors to undergraduate students went down the roster of the schools\nof psychology and wrecked them so comprehensively that the field was as\ndead as palmistry in twenty years. The miracle is that it hadn't\nhappened before. The flaws were so glaring! Textbooks of the older kind\nsolemnly described syndromes, psychoses, neuroses that simply couldn't\nbe found in the real world! And that's the way it was all the way down\nthe line.\"\n\n\"So where does that leave us?\" Charles demanded. \"Is it or isn't it a\nscience?\"\n\n\"It is,\" she said simply. \"Lieberman and his followers went too far. It\nbecame a kind of hysteria. The experimenters must have been too eager.\nThey misread results, they misinterpreted statistics, they misunderstood\nthe claims of a school and knocked down not its true claims but\nstraw-man claims they had set up themselves.\"\n\n\"But--_psychology_!\" Charles protested, obscurely embarrassed at the\nthought that man's mind was subject to scientific study--not because he\nknew the first thing about it, but because _everybody_ knew psychology\nwas phony.\n\nShe shrugged. \"I can't help it. We were doing physiology of the sensory\norgans, trying to settle the oldie about focusing the eye, and I got to\ngrubbing around the pre-Lieberman texts looking for light in the\ndarkness. Some of it sounded so--not sensible, but _positive_ that I ran\noff one of Lieberman's population checks. And the old boy had been dead\nwrong. _Mengenlehre_ constructs correspond quite nicely to the actual\nway people's minds work. I kept checking and the schools that were\ndestroyed as hopelessly fallacious a century ago checked out, some\nclosely and some not so closely, as good descriptions of the way the\nmind works. Some have predictive value. I used _mengenlehre_ psychology\nalgorithms to compute the conditioning on you and me, including the\ntrigger release. It worked. You see, Charles? We're on the rim of\nsomething tremendous!\"\n\n\"When did this Lieberman flourish?\"\n\n\"I don't have the exact dates in my head. The breakup of the schools\ncorresponded roughly with the lifetime of John G. Falcaro.\"\n\nThat pin-pointed it rather well. John G. succeeded Rafael, who succeeded\nAmadeo Falcaro, first leader of the Syndic in revolt. Under John G., the\nhard-won freedom was enjoyed, the bulging store-houses were joyously\nemptied, craft union rules went joyously out the window and builders\n_worked_, the dollar went to an all-time high and there was an all-time\nnumber of dollars in circulation. It had been an exhuberant time still\nfondly remembered; just the time for over-enthusiastic rebels against a\nfusty scholasticism to joyously smash old ways of thought without too\nmuch exercise of the conscience. It all checked out.\n\nShe started and he got to his feet. A hardly-noticed discomfort was\nbecoming acute; the speedboat was pitching and rolling quite seriously,\nfor the first time since their escape. \"Dirty weather coming up,\" he\nsaid. \"We've been too damned lucky so far.\" He thought, but didn't\nremark, that there was much to worry about in the fact that there seemed\nto have been no pursuit. The meager resources of the North American Navy\nwouldn't be spent on chasing a single minor craft--not if the weather\ncould be counted on to finish her off.\n\n\"I thought we were unsinkable?\"\n\n\"In a way. Seal the boat and she's unsinkable the way a corked bottle\nis. But the boat's made up of a lot of bits and pieces that go together\njust so. Pound her for a few hours with waves and the bits and pieces\ngive way. She doesn't sink, but she doesn't steam or steer either. I\nwish the Syndic had a fleet on the Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said. \"The nearest fleet I know of is Mob ore boats on the\ngreat lakes and they aren't likely to pick us up.\"\n\nThe sea-search radar pinged and they flew to the screen. \"_Something_ at\n273 degrees, about eight miles,\" he said. \"It can't be pursuit. They\ncouldn't have any reason at all to circle around us and come at us from\nahead.\" He strained his eyes into the west and thought he could see a\nblack speck on the gray.\n\nLee Falcaro tried a pair of binoculars and complained: \"These things\nwon't work.\"\n\n\"Not on a rolling, pitching platform they won't--not with an optical\nlever eight miles long. I don't suppose this boat would have a\ngyro-stabilized signal glass.\" He spun the wheel to 180; they staggered\nand clung as the bow whipped about, searched and steadied on the new\ncourse. The mounting waves slammed them broadside-to and the rolling\nincreased. They hardly noticed; their eyes were on the radarscope.\nFogged as it was with sea return, they nevertheless could be sure after\nseveral minutes that the object had changed course to 135. Charles made\na flying guess at her speed, read their own speed off and scribbled for\na moment.\n\nHe said nothing, but spun the wheel to 225 and went back to the\nradarscope. The object changed course to 145. Charles scribbled again\nand said at last, flatly: \"They're running collision courses on us.\nAutomatically computed, I suppose, from a radar. We're through.\"\n\nHe spun the wheel to 180 again, and studied the crawling green spark on\nthe radarscope. \"This way we give 'em the longest run for their money\nand can pray for a miracle. The only way we can use our speed to outrun\nthem is to turn around and head back into Government Territory--which\nisn't what we want. Relax, Lee. Maybe if the weather thickens they'll\nlose us--no; not with radar.\"\n\nThey sat together on a bunk, wordlessly, for hours while the spray\ndashed higher and the boat shivered to hammering waves. Briefly they saw\nthe pursuer, three miles off, low, black and ugly, before fog closed in\nagain.\n\nAt nightfall there was the close, triumphant roar of a big reaction\nturbine and a light stabbed through the fog, flooding the boat with\nblue-white radiance. A cliff-like black hull loomed alongside as a\nbull-horn roared at them: \"Cut your engines and come about into the\nwind.\"\n\nLee Falcaro read white-painted letters on the black hull: \"_Hon. James\nJ. Regan, Chicago_.\" She turned to Charles and said wonderingly: \"It's\nan ore boat. From the Mob great lakes fleet.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\n\"Here?\" Charles demanded. \"_Here?_\"\n\n\"No possible mistake,\" she said, stunned. \"When you're a Falcaro you\ntravel. I've seen 'em in Duluth, I've seen 'em in Quebec, I've seen 'em\nin Buffalo.\"\n\nThe bull-horn voice roared again, dead in the shroud of fog; \"Come into\nthe wind and cut your engines or we'll put a shell into you.\"\n\nCharles turned the wheel and wound in the moderator rod; the boat\npitched like a splinter on the waves. There was a muffled double\nexplosion and two grapnels crunched into the plastic hull, bow and\nstern. As the boat steadied, sharing the inertia of the ore ship, a dark\nfigure leaped from the blue-white eye of the searchlight to their deck.\nAnd another. And another.\n\n\"Hello, Jim,\" Lee Falcaro said almost inaudibly. \"Haven't met since Las\nVegas, have we?\"\n\nThe first boarder studied her cooly. He was built for football or any\nother form of mayhem. He ignored Charles completely. \"Lee Falcaro as\nadvised. Do you still think twenty reds means a black is bound to come\nup? You always were a fool, Lee. And now you're in real trouble.\"\n\n\"What's going on, mister?\" Charles snapped. \"We're Syndics and I presume\nyou're Mobsters. Don't you recognize the treaty?\"\n\nThe boarder turned to Charles inquiringly. \"Some confusion,\" he said.\n\"Max Wyman? Charles Orsino? Or just some wild man from outback?\"\n\n\"Orsino,\" Charles said formally. \"Second cousin of Edward Falcaro, under\nthe guardianship of Francis W. Taylor.\"\n\nThe boarder bowed slightly. \"James Regan IV,\" he said. \"No need to list\nmy connections. It would take too long and I feel no need to justify\nmyself to a small-time dago chisler. Watch him gentlemen!\"\n\nCharles found his arms pinned by Regan's two companions. There was a gun\nmuzzle in his ribs.\n\nRegan shouted to the ship and a ladder was let down. Lee Falcaro and\nCharles climbed it with guns at their backs. He said to her: \"Who is\nthat lunatic?\" It did not even occur to him that the young man was who\nhe claimed to be--the son of the Mob Territory opposite number of Edward\nFalcaro.\n\n\"He's Regan,\" she said. \"And I don't know who's the lunatic, him or me.\nCharles, I'm sorry, terribly sorry, I got you into this.\"\n\nHe managed to smile. \"I volunteered,\" he said.\n\n\"Enough talk,\" Regan said, following them onto the deck. Dull-eyed\nsailors watched them incuriously, and there were a couple of anvil-jawed\nmen with a stance and swagger Charles had come to know. Guardsmen--he\nwould have staked his life on it. Guardsmen of the North American\nGovernment Navy--aboard a Mob Territory ship and acting as if they were\npassengers or high-rated crewmen.\n\nRegan smirked: \"I'm on the horns of a dilemma. There are no\naccomodations that are quite right for you. There are storage\ncompartments which are worse than you deserve and there are passenger\nquarters which are too good for you. I'm afraid it will have to be one\nof the compartments. Your consolation will be that it's only a short run\nto Chicago.\"\n\nChicago--headquarters for Mob Territory. The ore ship had been on a\nreturn trip to Chicago when alerted somehow by the Navy to intercept the\nfugitives. _Why?_\n\n\"Down there,\" one of the men gestured briskly with a gun. They climbed\ndown a ladder into a dark, oily cavern fitfully lit by a flash in\nRegan's hand.\n\n\"Make yourselves comfortable,\" Regan told them. \"If you get a headache,\ndon't worry. We were carrying some avgas on the outward run.\" The flash\nwinked out and a door clanged on them.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Charles said. \"That's a top Mob man? Couldn't you\nbe mistaken?\" He groped in the dark and found her. The place did reek of\ngasoline.\n\nShe clung to him and said: \"Hold me, Charles.... Yes that's Jimmy Regan.\n\n\"That's what will become top man in the Mob. Jimmy's a charmer at a Las\nVegas Hotel. Jimmy's a gourmet when he orders at the Pump Room and he's\ntrying to overawe you. Jimmy plays polo too, but he's crippled three of\nhis own team-mates because he's not very good at it. I kept telling\nmyself whenever I ran into him that he was just an accident, the Mob\ncould survive him. But his father acts--funny. There's something with\nthem, there's some--\n\n\"They roll out the carpet when you show up but the people around them\nare afraid of them. There's a story I never believed--but I believe it\nnow. What would happen if my uncle pulled out a pistol and began\nscreaming and shot a waiter: Jimmy's father did it, they tell me. And\nnothing happened except that the waiter was dragged away and everybody\nsaid it was a good thing Mr. Regan saw him reach for his gun and shot\nhim first. Only the waiter didn't have any gun.\n\n\"I saw Jimmy last three years ago. I haven't been in Mob Territory\nsince. I didn't like it there. Now I know why. Give Mob Territory enough\ntime and it'll be like New Portsmouth. Something went wrong with them.\nWe have the Treaty of Las Vegas and a hundred years of peace and there\naren't many people going back and forth between Syndic and Mob except\nfor a few high-ups like me who have to circulate. Manners. So you pay\nduty calls and shut your eyes to what they're really like.\n\n\"_This_ is what they're like. This dark, damp stinking compartment. And\nmy uncle--and all the Falcaros--and you--and I--we aren't like them. Are\nwe? _Are we?_\" Her fingers bit into his arms. She was shaking.\n\n\"Easy,\" he soothed her. \"Easy, easy. We're all right. We'll be all\nright. I think I've got it figured out. This must be some private\ngun-running Jimmy's gone in for. Loaded an ore boat with avgas and ammo\nand ran it up the Seaway. If anybody in Syndic Territory gave a damn\nthey thought it was a load of ore for New Orleans via the Atlantic and\nthe Gulf. But Jimmy ran his load to Ireland or Iceland, H.Q. A little\nprivate flier of his. He wouldn't dare harm us. There's the Treaty and\nyou're a Falcaro.\"\n\n\"Treaty,\" she said. \"I tell you they're all in it. Now that I've seen\nthe Government in action I understand what I saw in Mob Territory.\nThey've gone rotten, that's all. They've gone rotten. The way he treated\nyou, because he thought you didn't have his rank! Sometimes my uncle's\nhigh-handed, sometimes he tells a person off, sometimes he lets him know\nhe's top man in the Syndic and doesn't propose to let anybody teach him\nhow to suck eggs. But the spirit's different. In the Syndic it's parent\nto child. In the Mob it's master to slave. Not based on age, not based\non achievement, but based on the accident of birth. You tell me 'You're\na Falcaro' and that packs weight. Why? Not because I was born a Falcaro\nbut because they let me stay a Falcaro. If I hadn't been brainy and\nquick, they'd have adopted me out before I was ten. They don't do that\nin Mob Territory. Whatever chance sends a Regan is a Regan then and\nforever. Even if it's a paranoid constitutional inferior like Jimmy's\nfather. Even if it's a giggling pervert like Jimmy.\n\n\"God, Charles, I'm scared.\n\n\"At last I know these people and I'm scared. You'd have to see Chicago\nto know why. The lakefront palaces, finer than anything in New York.\nRegan Memorial Plaza, finer than Scratch Sheet Square--great gilded\nmarble figures, a hundred running yards of heroic frieze. But the hovels\nyou see only by chance! Gray brick towers dating from the Third Fire!\nThe children with faces like weasels, the men with faces like hogs, the\nwomen with figures like beer barrels and all of them glaring at you when\nyou drive past as if they could cut your throat with joy. I never\nunderstood the look in their eyes until now, and you'll never begin to\nunderstand what I'm talking about until you see their eyes....\"\n\nCharles revolted against the idea. It was too gross to go down. It\ndidn't square with his acquired picture of life in North America and\ntherefore Lee Falcaro must be somehow mistaken or hysterical. \"There,\"\nhe murmured, stroking her hair. \"We'll be all right. We'll be all\nright.\" He tried to soothe her.\n\nShe twisted out of his arms and raged: \"I _won't_ be humored. They're\nmad, I tell you. Dick Reiner was right. We've got to wipe out the\nGovernment. But Frank Taylor was right too. We've got to blast the Mob\nbefore they blast us. They've died and decayed into something too\nhorrible to bear. If we let them stay on the continent, with us their\nstink will infect us and poison us to death. We've got to do something.\nWe've got to do something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nIt stopped her cold. After a minute she uttered a shaky laugh. \"The fat,\nsloppy, happy Syndic,\" she said, \"sitting around while the wolves\noverseas and the maniacs across the Mississippi are waiting to jump.\nYes--do what?\"\n\nCharles Orsino was not good at arguments or indeed at any abstract\nthinking. He knew it. He knew the virtues that had commended him to F.\nW. Taylor were his energy and an off-hand talent for getting along with\npeople. But something rang terribly false in Lee's words.\n\n\"That kind of thinking doesn't get you anywhere, Lee,\" he said slowly.\n\"I didn't absorb much from Uncle Frank, but I did absorb this: you run\ninto trouble if you make up stories about the world and then act as if\nthey're true. The Syndic isn't somebody sitting around. The Government\nisn't wolves. The Mobsters aren't maniacs. And they aren't waiting to\njump on the Syndic. The Syndic isn't anything that's jumpable. It's some\npeople and their morale and credit.\"\n\n\"Faith is a beautiful thing,\" Lee Falcaro said bitterly. \"Where'd you\nget yours?\"\n\n\"From the people I knew and worked with. Numbers-runners, bookies,\nsluts. Decent citizens.\"\n\n\"And what about the scared and unhappy ones in Riveredge? That sow of a\nwoman in the D.A.R. who smuggled me aboard a coast raider? The neurotics\nand psychotics I found more and more of when I invalidated the Lieberman\nfindings? Charles, the North American Government didn't scare me\nespecially. But the thought that they're lined up with a continental\npower does. It scares me damnably because it'll be three against one.\nAgainst the Syndic, the Mob, the Government--and our own unbalanced\ncitizens.\"\n\nUncle Frank never let that word \"citizens\" pass without a tirade. \"We\nare not a government!\" he always yelled. \"We are not a government! We\nmust not think like a government! We must not think in terms of duties\nand receipts and disbursements. We must think in terms of the old\nloyalties that bound the Syndic together!\" Uncle Frank was sedentary,\nbut he had roused himself once to the point of wrecking a bright young\nman's newly installed bookkeeping system for the Medical Center. He had\nused a cane, most enthusiastically, and then bellowed: \"The next wise\nguy who tries to sneak punch-cards into this joint will get them down\nhis throat! What the hell do we need punch-cards for? Either there's\nroom enough and doctors enough for the patients or there isn't. If there\nis, we take care of them. If there isn't, we put 'em in an ambulance and\ntake them someplace else. And if I hear one goddammed word about\n'efficiency'--\" he glared the rest and strode out, puffing and leaning\non Charles' arm. \"Efficiency,\" he growled in the corridor. \"Every so\noften a wise guy comes to me whimpering that people are getting away\nwith murder, collections are ten per cent below what they ought to be,\nthe Falcaro Fund's being milked because fifteen per cent of the dough\ngoes to people who aren't in need at all, eight per cent of the people\ngetting old-age pensions aren't really past sixty. Get efficient, these\npeople tell me. Save money by triple-checking collections. Save money by\ntightening up the Fund rules. Save money by a nice big vital-statistics\nsystem so we can check on pensioners. Yeah! Have people who might be\n_working_ check on collections instead, and make enemies to boot\nwhenever we catch somebody short. Make the Fund a grudging Scrooge\ninstead of an open-handed sugar-daddy--and let people _worry_ about\ntheir chances of making the Fund instead of _knowing_ it'll take care of\nthem if they're caught short. Set up a vital statistics system from\nbirth to death, with numbers and finger-prints and house registration\nand maybe the gas-chamber if you forget to report a change of address.\nYou know what's wrong with the wise guys, Charles? Constipation. And\nthey want to constipate the universe.\" Charles remembered his uncle\nrestored to chuckling good humor by the time he had finished\nembroidering his spur-of-the-moment theory with elaborate scatological\ndetails.\n\n\"The Syndic will stand,\" he said to Lee Falcaro, thinking of his uncle\nwho knew what he was doing, thinking of Edward Falcaro who did the right\nthing without knowing why, thinking of his good friends in the 101st\nPrecinct, the roaring happy crowds in Scratch Sheet Square, the\ngood-hearted men of Riveredge Breakdown Station 26 who had borne with\nhis sullenness and intolerance simply because that was the way things\nwere and that was the way you acted. \"I don't know what the Mob's up to,\nand I got a shock from the Government, and I don't deny that we have a\nfew miserable people who can't seem to be helped. But you've seen too\nmuch of the Mob and Government and our abnormals. Maybe you don't know\nas much as you should about our ordinary people. Anyway, all we can do\nis wait.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"All we can do is wait. Until Chicago we have each\nother.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThey were too sick with gasoline fumes to count the passing hours or\ndays. Food was brought to them from time to time, but it tasted like\navgas. They could not think for the sick headaches that pounded\nincessantly behind their eyes. When Lee developed vomiting spasms that\nwould not stop, Charles Orsino pounded on the bulkhead with his fists\nand yelled, his voice thunderous in the metal compartment, for an hour.\n\nSomebody came at last--Regan. The light stabbed Charles' eyes when he\nopened the door. \"Trouble?\" Regan asked, smirking.\n\n\"Miss Falcaro may be dying,\" Charles said. His own throat felt as though\nit had been gone over with a cobbler's rasp. \"I don't have to tell you\nyour life won't be worth a dime if she dies and it gets back to Syndic\nTerritory. She's got to be moved and she's got to have medical\nattention.\"\n\n\"Death threat from the dago?\" Regan was amused. \"I have it on your own\ntestimony that the Syndic is merely morale and people and credit--not a\nformidable organization. Yes, there was a mike in here. One reason for\nyour discomfort. You'll be gratified to learn that I thought most of\nyour conversation decidedly dull. However, the lady will be of no use to\nus dead and we're now in the Seaway entering Lake Michigan. I suppose it\ncan't do any harm to move you two. Pick her up, will you? I'll let you\nlead the way--and I'll remind you that I may not, as the lady said, be a\nfour-goal polo player but I am a high expert with the handgun. Get\nmoving.\"\n\nCharles did not think he could pick his own feet up, but the thought of\npleading weakness to Regan was unbearable. He could try. Staggering, he\ngot Lee Falcaro over his shoulder and through the door. Regan\ncourteously stood aside and murmured: \"Straight ahead and up the ramp.\nI'm giving you my own cabin. We'll be docking soon enough; I'll make\nout.\"\n\nCharles dropped her onto a sybaritic bed in a small but\nlavishly-appointed cabin. Regan whistled up a deckhand and a ship's\nofficer of some sort, who arrived with a medicine chest. \"Do what you\ncan for her, mister,\" he told the officer. And to the deckhand: \"Just\nwatch them. They aren't to touch anything. If they give you trouble,\nyou're free to punch them around a bit.\" He left, whistling.\n\nThe officer fussed unhappily over the medicine chest and stalled by\nsponging off Lee Falcaro's face and throat. The deckhand watched\nimpassively. He was a six-footer, and he hadn't spent days inhaling\ncasing-head fumes. The trip-hammer pounding behind Charles's eyes seemed\nto be worsening with the fresher air. He collapsed into a seat and\ncroaked, with shut eyes: \"While you're trying to figure out the\nvomiting, can I have a handful of aspirins?\"\n\n\"Eh? Nothing was said about you. You were in Number Three with her? I\nsuppose it'll be all right. Here.\" He poured a dozen tablets into\nCharles' hand. \"Get him some water, you.\" The deckhand brought a glass\nof water from the adjoining lavatory and Charles washed down some of the\ntablets. The officer was reading a booklet, worry written on his face.\n\"Do you know any medicine?\" he finally asked.\n\nThe hard-outlined, kidney-shaped ache was beginning to diffuse through\nCharles' head, more general now and less excruciating. He felt\ndeliciously sleepy, but roused himself to answer: \"Some athletic trainer\nstuff. I don't know--morphine? Curare?\"\n\nThe officer ruffled through the booklet. \"Nothing about vomiting,\" he\nsaid. \"But it says curare for muscular cramp and I guess that's what's\ngoing on. A lipoid suspension to release it slowly into the bloodstream\nand give the irritation time to subside. Anyway, I can't kill her if I\nwatch the dose....\"\n\nCharles, through half-opened eyes, saw Lee Falcaro's arm reach behind\nthe officer's back to his medicine chest. The deckhand's eyes were\nturning to the bed--Charles heaved himself to his feet, skyrockets going\noff again through his head, and started for the lavatory. The deckhand\ngrabbed his arm. \"Rest, mister! Where do you think you're going?\"\n\n\"Another glass of water--\"\n\n\"_I'll_ get it. You heard my orders.\"\n\nCharles subsided. When he dared to look again, Lee's arm lay alongside\nher body and the officer was triple-checking dosages in his booklet\nagainst a pressurized hypodermic spray. The officer sighed and addressed\nLee: \"You won't even feel this. Relax.\" He read his setting on the spray\nagain, checked it again against the booklet. He touched the syringe to\nthe skin of Lee's arm and thumbed open the valve. It hissed for a moment\nand Charles knew submicroscopic particles of the medication had been\nblasted under Lee's skin too fast for nerves to register the shock.\n\nHis glass of water came and he gulped it greedily. The officer packed\nthe pressurized syringe away, folded the chest and said to both of them,\nrather vaguely: \"That should do it. If, uh, if anything happens--or if\nit doesn't work--call me and I'll try something else. Morphine, maybe.\"\n\nHe left and Charles slumped in the chair, the pain ebbing and sleep\nbeginning to flow over him. Not yet, he told himself. She hooked\nsomething from the chest. He said to the deckhand: \"Can I clean the lady\nand myself up?\"\n\n\"Go ahead, mister. You can use it. Just don't try anything.\"\n\nThe man lounged in the door-frame of the lavatory alternately studying\nCharles at the wash-basin and Lee on the bed. Charles took off a heavy\nlayer of oily grease from himself and then took washing tissues to the\nbed. Lee Falcaro's spasms were tapering off. As he washed her, she\nmanaged a smile and an unmistakable wink.\n\n\"You folks married?\" the deckhand asked.\n\n\"No,\" Charles said. Weakly she held up her right arm for the washing\ntissue. As he scrubbed the hand, he felt a small cylinder smoothly\ntransferred from her palm to his. He slid it into a pocket and finished\nthe job.\n\nThe officer popped in again with a carton of milk. \"Any better, miss?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Good. Try to drink this.\" Immensely set up by his success in treatment,\nhe hovered over her for a quarter of an hour getting the milk down a sip\nat a time. It stayed down. He left trailing a favorable prognosis.\nMeanwhile, Charles had covertly examined Lee's booty: a pressurized\nsyringe labeled _morphine sulfate sol_. It was full and ready. He\ncracked off the protective cap and waited his chance.\n\nIt came when Lee grimaced at him and called the deckhand in a feeble\nmurmur. She continued to murmur so indistinctly that he bent over trying\nto catch the words. Charles leaned forward and emptied the syringe at\none inch range into the taut seat of the deckhand's pants. He scratched\nabsently and said to Lee: \"You'll have to talk up, lady.\" Then he\ngiggled, looked bewildered and collapsed on the floor, staring, coked to\nthe eyebrows.\n\nLee painfully sat up on the bed. \"Porthole,\" she said.\n\nCharles went to it and struggled with the locking lugs. It opened--and\nan alarm bell began to clang through the ship. _Now_ he saw the\nhair-fine, broken wire. An alarm trip-wire.\n\nFeet thundered outside and the glutinous voice of Jimmy Regan was heard:\n\"Wait, you damn fools! You in there--is everything all right? Did they\ntry to pull something?\"\n\nCharles kept silent and shook his head at the girl. He picked up a chair\nand stood by the door. The glutinous voice again, in a mumble that\ndidn't carry through--and the door sprang open. Charles brought the\nchair down in a murderous chop, conscious only that it seemed curiously\nlight. There was an impact and the head fell.\n\nIt was Regan, with a drawn gun. It had been Regan. His skull was smashed\nbefore he knew it. Charles felt as though he had all the time in the\nworld. He picked up the gun to a confused roar like a slowed-down sound\ntrack and emptied it into the corridor. It had been a full automatic,\nbut the fifteen shots seemed as well-spaced as a ceremonial salute.\nRegan, in his vanity, wore two guns. Charles scooped up the other and\nsaid to Lee: \"Come on.\"\n\nHe knew she was following as he raced down the cleared corridor and down\nthe ramp, back to the compartment in which they had been locked. Red\ndanger lights burned on the walls. Charles flipped the pistol to\nsemi-automatic as they passed a red-painted bulkhead with valves and\ngages sprouting from it. He turned and fired three deliberate shots into\nit. The last was drowned out by a dull roar as gasoline fumes exploded.\nPipe fittings and fragments of plate whizzed about them like bullets as\nthey raced on.\n\nSomebody ahead loomed, yelling querulously: \"What the hell was that,\nMac? What blew?\"\n\n\"Where's the reactor room?\" Charles demanded, jamming the pistol into\nhis chest. The man gulped and pointed.\n\n\"Take me there. Fast.\"\n\n\"Now _look_, Mac--\"\n\nCharles told him in a few incisive details where and how he was going to\nbe shot. The man went white and led them down the corridor and into the\nreactor room. Three white-coated men with the aloof look of reactor\nspecialists stared at them as they bulled into the spotless chamber.\n\nThe oldest sniffed: \"And what, may I ask, are you crewmen doing in--\"\n\nLee slammed the door behind them and said: \"Sound the radiation alarm.\"\n\n\"Certainly not! You must be the couple we--\"\n\n\"_Sound the radiation alarm._\" She picked up a pair of dividers from the\nplot board and approached the technician with murder on her face. He\ngaped until she poised the needle points before his eyes and repeated:\n\"_Sound the radiation alarm._\" Nobody in the room, including Charles,\nhad the slightest doubt that the points would sink into the technician's\neyeballs if he refused.\n\n\"Do what she says, Will,\" he mumbled, his eyes crossing on the dividers.\n\"For God's sake, do what she says. She's crazy.\"\n\nOne of the men moved, very cautiously, watching Charles and the gun, to\na red handle and pulled it down. A ferro-concrete barrier rose to wall\noff the chamber and the sine-curve wail of a standard radioactivity\nwarning began to howl mournfully through the ship.\n\n\"Dump the reactor metal,\" Charles said. His eyes searched for the exit,\nand found it--a red-painted breakaway panel, standard for a hot lab.\n\nA technician wailed: \"We _can't_ do that! We can't _do_ that! A million\nbucks of thorium with a hundred years of life in it--have a heart,\nmister! They'll crucify us!\"\n\n\"They can dredge for it,\" Charles said. \"Dump the metal.\"\n\n\"Dump the metal,\" Lee said. She hadn't moved.\n\nThe senior technician's eyes were still on the bright needle points. He\nwas crying silently. \"Dump it,\" he said.\n\n\"Okay, chief. Your responsibility, remember.\"\n\n\"Dump it!\" wailed the senior.\n\nThe technician did something technical at the control board. After a\nmoment the steady rumbling of the turbines ceased and the ship's deck\nbegan to wallow underfoot.\n\n\"Hit the panel, Lee,\" Charles said. She did, running. He followed her\nthrough the oval port. It was like an open-bottomed diving bell welded\nto the hull. There were large, luminous cleats for pulling yourself\ndown through the water, under the rim of the bell. He dropped the pistol\ninto the water, breathed deeply a couple of times and began to climb\ndown. There was no sign of Lee.\n\nHe kicked up through the dark water on a long slant away from the ship.\nIt might be worse. With a fire and a hot-lab alarm and a dead chief\naboard, the crew would have things on their mind besides looking for\nbobbing heads.\n\nHe broke the surface and treaded water to make a minimum target. He did\nnot turn to the ship. His dark hair would be less visible than his white\nface. And if he was going to get a burst of machine-gun bullets through\neither, he didn't want to know about it. Ahead he saw Lee's blonde hair\nspread on the water for a moment and then it vanished. He breathed\nhugely, ducked and swam under water toward it.\n\nWhen he rose next a sheet of flame was lightening the sky and the oily\nreek of burning hydrocarbons tainted the air. He dove again, and this\ntime caught up with Lee. Her face was bone-white and her eyes blank.\nWhere she was drawing her strength from he could not guess. Behind them\nthe ship sent up an oily plume and the sine-curve wail of the\nradioactivity warning could be faintly heard. Before them a dim shore\nstretched.\n\nHe gripped her naked arm, roughened by the March waters of Lake\nMichigan, bent it around his neck and struck off for the shore. His\nlungs were bursting in his chest and the world was turning gray-black\nbefore his burning eyes. He heaved his tired arm through the water as\nthough each stroke would be his last, but the last stroke, by some\nmiracle, never was the last.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nIt hadn't been easy to get time off from the oil-painting factory. Ken\nOliver was a little late when he slid into the aseptic-smelling waiting\nroom of the Michigan City Medical Center. A parabolic mike in the\nceiling trained itself on the heat he radiated and followed him across\nthe floor to a chair. A canned voice said: \"State your business,\nplease.\"\n\nHe started a little and said in the general direction of the mike: \"I'm\nKen Oliver. A figure man in the Blue Department, Picasso Oils and\nEtching Corporation. Dr. Latham sent me here for--what do you call\nit?--a biopsy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, please be seated.\"\n\nHe smiled because he was seated already and picked up a magazine, the\ncurrent copy of the _Illinois Sporting News_, familiarly known as the\nGreen Sheet. Everybody in Mob Territory read it. The fingers of the\nblind spelled out its optimism and its selections at Hawthorne in\nBraille. If you were not only blind but fingerless, there was a talking\nedition that read itself aloud to you from tape.\n\nHe riffled through the past performances and selections to the articles.\nThis month's lead was--_Thank God I am Dying of Throat Cancer_.\n\nHe leaned back in the chair dizzily, the waiting room becoming gray mist\naround him. _No_, he thought. _No._ It couldn't be that. All it could be\nwas a little sore on the back of his throat--no more than that. Just a\nlittle sore on the back of his throat. He'd been a fool to go to Latham.\nThe fees were outrageous and he was behind, always a little behind, on\nhis bills. But cancer--so much of it around--and the drugs didn't seem\nto _help_ any more.... But Latham had almost promised him it was\nnon-malignant.\n\n\"Mr. Oliver,\" the loudspeaker said, \"please go to Dr. Riordan's office,\nNumber Ten.\"\n\nRiordan was younger than he. That was supposed to be bad in a\ngeneral practitioner, good in a specialist. And Riordan was a\nspecialist--pathology. A sour-faced young specialist.\n\n\"Good morning. Sit here. Open your mouth. Wider than that, and relax.\n_Relax_; your glottis is locked.\"\n\nOliver couldn't protest around the plastic-and-alcohol taste of the\ntongue depressor. There was a sudden coldness and a metallic _snick_\nthat startled him greatly; then Riordan took the splint out of his mouth\nand ignored him as he summoned somebody over his desk set. A young man,\neven younger than Riordan, came in. \"Freeze, section and stain this\nright away,\" the pathologist said, handing him a forceps from which a\nsmall blob dangled. \"Have them send up the Rotino charts, three hundred\nto nine hundred inclusive.\"\n\nHe began to fill out charts, still ignoring Oliver, who sat and sweated\nbullets for ten minutes. Then he left and was back in five minutes more.\n\n\"You've got it,\" he said shortly. \"It's operable and you won't lose much\ntissue.\" He scribbled on a sheet of paper and handed it to Oliver. The\npainter numbly read: \"... anterior ... epithelioma ... metastases ...\ngiant cells....\"\n\nRiordan was talking again: \"Give this to Latham. It's my report. Have\nhim line up a surgeon. As to the operation, I say the sooner the better\nunless you care to lose your larynx. That will be fifty dollars.\"\n\n\"Fifty dollars,\" the painter said blankly. \"But Dr. Latham told me--\" He\ntrailed off and got out his check book. Only thirty-two in the account,\nbut he would deposit his paycheck today which would bring it up. It was\nafter three so his check wouldn't go in today--he wrote out the slip\nslowly and carefully.\n\nRiordan took it, read it suspiciously, put it away and said: \"Good day,\nMr. Oliver.\"\n\nOliver wandered from the Medical Center into the business heart of the\nart colony. The Van Gogh Works on the left must have snagged the big\norder from Mexico--their chimneys were going full blast and the reek of\nlinseed oil and turps was strong in the air. But the poor beggars on the\nline at Rembrandts Ltd. across the square were out of luck. They'd been\nlaid off for a month now, with no sign of a work call yet. Somebody\njostled him off the sidewalk, somebody in a great hurry. Oliver sighed.\nThe place was getting more like Chicago every day. He sometimes thought\nhe had made art his line not because he had any special talent but\nbecause artists were relatively easy-going people, not so quick to pop\nyou in the nose, not such aggressive drunks when they _were_ drunks.\n\nQuit the stalling, a thin, cold voice inside him said. Get over to\nLatham. The man said \"The sooner the better.\"\n\nHe went over to Latham whose waiting room was crowded with irascible\nwomen. After an hour, he got to see the old man and hand him the slip.\n\nLatham said: \"Don't worry about a thing. Riordan's a good man. If he\nsays it's operable, it's operable. Now we want Finsen to do the\nwhittling. With Finsen operating, you won't have to worry about a thing.\nHe's a good man. His fee's fifteen hundred.\"\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" Oliver gulped.\n\n\"What's the matter--haven't you got it?\"\n\nTo his surprise and terror, Oliver found himself giving Dr. Latham a\nhysterical stump speech about how he didn't have it and who did have it\nand how could anybody get ahead with the way prices were shooting up and\neverybody gouged you every time you turned around and yes, that went for\ndoctors too and if you did get a couple of bucks in your pocket the\nsalesmen heard about it and battered at you until you put down an\ninstallment on some piece of junk you didn't want to get them out of\nyour hair and what the hell kind of world was this anyway.\n\nLatham listened, smiling and nodding, with, as Oliver finally realized,\nhis hearing aid turned off. His voice ran down and Latham said briskly:\n\"All right, then. You just come around when you've arranged the\nfinancial details and I'll contact Finsen. He's a good man; you won't\nhave to worry about a thing. And remember: the sooner, the better.\"\n\nOliver slumped out of the office and went straight to the Mob Building,\noffice of the Regan Benevolent Fund. An acid-voiced woman there turned\nhim down indignantly: \"You should be ashamed of yourself trying to draw\non the Fund when there are people in actual want who can't be\naccommodated! No, I don't want to hear any more about it if you please.\nThere are others waiting.\"\n\nWaiting for what? The same treatment?\n\nOliver realized with a shock that he hadn't phoned his foreman as\npromised, and it was four minutes to five. He did a dance of agonized\nimpatience outside a telephone booth occupied by a fat woman. She\nnoticed him, pursed her lips, hung up--and stayed in the booth. She\nbegan a slow search of her hand-bag, found coins and slowly dialed a new\nnumber. She gave him a malevolent grin as he walked away, crushed. He\nhad a good job record, but that was no way to keep it good. One black\nmark, another black mark, and one day--bingo.\n\nGeneral Advances was open, of course. Through its window you could see\nhandsome young men and sleek young women just waiting to help you,\nwhatever the fiscal jam. He went in and was whisked to a booth where a\nbig-bosomed honey-voiced blonde oozed sympathy over him. He walked out\nwith a check for fifteen hundred dollars after signing countless papers,\nwith the creamy hand of the girl on his to help guide the pen. What was\nprinted on the papers, God and General Advances alone knew. There were\nmen on the line who told him with resignation that they had been paying\noff to G.A. for the better part of their lives. There were men who said\nbitterly that G.A. was owned by the Regan Benevolent Fund, which must be\na lie.\n\nThe street was full of people--strangers who didn't look like your\nrun-of-the-mill artist. Muscle men, with the Chicago style and if\nanybody got one in the gut, too goddamned bad about it. They were\npeering into faces as they passed.\n\nHe was frightened. He stepped onto the slidewalk and hurried home,\nhoping for temporary peace there. But there was no peace for his frayed\nnerves. The apartment house door opened obediently when he told it:\n\"Regan,\" but the elevator stood stupidly still when he said: \"Seventh\nFloor.\" He spat bitterly and precisely: \"_Sev-enth Floor._\" The doors\nclosed on him with a faintly derisive, pneumatic moan and he was whisked\nup to the eighth floor. He walked down wearily and said: \"Cobalt blue\"\nto his own door after a furtive look up and down the hall. It worked and\nhe went to his phone to flash Latham, but didn't. Oliver sank instead\ninto a dun-colored pneumatic chair, his 250-dollar Hawthorne Electric\nStepsaver door mike following him with its mindless snout. He punched a\nbutton on the chair and the 600-dollar hi-fi selected a random tape. A\nlong, pure melodic trumpet line filled the room. It died for two beats\nand than the strings and woodwinds picked it up and tossed it--\n\nOliver snapped off the music, sweat starting from his brow. It was the\nGershwin _Lost Symphony_, and he remembered how Gershwin had died. There\nhad been a little nodule in his brain as there was a little nodule in\nOliver's throat.\n\nTime, the Great Kidder. The years drifted by. Suddenly you were\nmiddle-aged, running to the medics for this and that. Suddenly they told\nyou to have your throat whittled out or die disgustingly. And what did\nyou have to show for it? A number, a travel pass, a payment book from\nGeneral Advance, a bunch of junk you never wanted, a job that was a\nheavier ball and chain than any convict ever wore in the barbarous days\nof Government. Was this what Regan and Falcaro had bled for?\n\nHe defrosted some hamburger, fried it and ate it and then went\nmechanically down to the tavern. He didn't like to drink every night,\nbut you had to be one of the boys, or word would get back to the plant\nand you might be on your way to another black mark. They were racing\nunder the lights at Hawthorne too, and he'd be expected to put a couple\nof bucks down. He never seemed to win. Nobody he knew ever seemed to\nwin. Not at the horses, not at the craps table, not at the numbers.\n\nHe stood outside the neon-bright saloon for a long moment, and then\nturned and walked into the darkness away from town, possessed by\nimpulses he did not understand or want to understand. He had only a\nvague hope that standing on the Dunes and looking out across the dark\nlake might somehow soothe him.\n\nIn half an hour he had reached the deciduous forest, then the pine,\nthen the scrubby brushes, then the grasses, then the bare white sand.\nAnd lying in it he found two people: a man so hard and dark he seemed to\nbe carved from oak and a woman so white and gaunt she seemed to be\ncarved from ivory.\n\nHe turned shyly from the woman.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked the man. \"Is there anything I can do?\"\n\nThe man opened red-rimmed eyes. \"Better leave us alone,\" he said. \"We'd\nonly get you into trouble.\"\n\nOliver laughed hysterically. \"Trouble?\" he said. \"Don't think of it.\"\n\nThe man seemed to be measuring him with his eyes, and said at last:\n\"You'd better go and not talk about us. We're enemies of the Mob.\"\n\nOliver said after a pause: \"So am I. Don't go away. I'll be back with\nsome clothes and food for you and the lady. Then I can help you to my\nplace. I'm an enemy of the Mob too. I just never knew it until now.\"\n\nHe started off and then turned. \"You won't go away? I mean it. I want to\nhelp you. I can't seem to help myself, but perhaps there's something--\"\n\nThe man said tiredly: \"We won't go away.\"\n\nOliver hurried off. There was something mingled with the scent of the\npine forest tonight. He was half-way home before he identified it: oil\nsmoke.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nLee swore and said: \"I can get up if I want to.\"\n\n\"You'll stay in bed whether you want to or not,\" Charles told her.\n\"You're a sick woman.\"\n\n\"I'm a very bad-tempered woman and that means I'm convalescent. Ask\nanybody.\"\n\n\"I'll go right out into the street and do that, darling.\"\n\nShe got out of bed and wrapped Oliver's dressing gown around her. \"I'm\nhungry again,\" she said.\n\n\"He'll be back soon. You've left nothing but some frozen--worms, looks\nlike. Shall I defrost them?\"\n\n\"Please don't trouble. I can wait.\"\n\n\"Window!\" he snapped.\n\nShe ducked back and swore again, this time at herself. \"Sorry,\" she\nsaid. \"Which will do us a whole hell of a lot of good if somebody saw me\nand started wondering.\"\n\nOliver came in with packages. Lee kissed him and he grinned shyly.\n\"Trout,\" he whispered. She grabbed the packages and flew to the\nkitchenette.\n\n\"The way to Lee Falcaro's heart,\" Charles mused. \"How's your throat,\nKen?\"\n\n\"No pain, today,\" Oliver whispered. \"Latham says I can talk as much as I\nlike. And I've got things to talk about.\" He opened his coat and hauled\nout a flat package that had been stuffed under his belt. \"Stolen from\nthe factory. Brushes, pens, tubes of ink, drawing instruments. My\nfriends, you are going to return to Syndic Territory in style, with\npasses and permits galore.\"\n\nLee returned. \"Trout's frying,\" she said. \"I heard that about the\npasses. Are you _sure_ you can fake them?\"\n\nHis face fell. \"Eight years at the Chicago Art Institute,\" he whispered.\n\"Three years at Original Reproductions, Inc. Eleven years at Picasso\nOils and Etchings, where I am now third figure man in the Blue\nDepartment. I really think I deserve your confidence.\"\n\n\"Ken, we trust and love you. If it weren't for the difference in your\nages I'd marry you _and_ Charles. Now what about the Chicagoans? Hold\nit--the fish!\"\n\nDinner was served and cleared away before they could get more out of\nOliver. His throat wasn't ready for more than one job at a time. He told\nthem at last: \"Things are quieting down. There are still some strangers\nin town and the road patrols are still acting very hard-boiled. But\nnobody's been pulled in today. Somebody told me on the line that the\nwhole business is a lot of foolishness. He said the ship must have been\ndamaged by somebody's stupidity and Regan must have been killed in a\nbrawl--everybody knows he was half crazy, like his father. So my friend\nfigures they made up the story about two wild Europeans to cover up a\nmess. I said I thought there was a lot in what he said.\" Oliver laughed\nsilently.\n\n\"Good man!\" Charles tried not to act over-eager. \"When do you think you\ncan start on the passes, Ken?\"\n\nOliver's face dropped a little. \"Tonight,\" he whispered. \"I don't\nsuppose the first couple of tries will be any good so--let's go.\"\n\nLee put her hand on his shoulder. \"We'll miss you too,\" she said. \"But\ndon't ever forget this: we're coming back. Hell won't stop us. We're\ncoming back.\"\n\nOliver was arranging stolen instruments on the table. \"You have a big\norder,\" he whispered sadly. \"I guess you aren't afraid of it because\nyou've always been rich and strong. Anything you want to do you think\nyou can do. But those Government people? And after them the Mob? Maybe\nit would be better if you just let things take their course, Lee. I've\nfound out a person can be happy even here.\"\n\n\"We're coming back,\" Lee said.\n\nOliver took out his own Michigan City-Chicago travel permit. As always,\nthe sight of it made Charles wince. Americans under such a yoke! Oliver\nwhispered: \"I got a good long look today at a Michigan City Buffalo\npermit. The foreman's. He buys turps from Carolina at Buffalo. I\nsketched it from memory as soon as I got by myself. I don't swear to it,\nnot yet, but I have the sketch to practice from and I can get a few more\nlooks later.\"\n\nHe pinned down the drawing paper, licked a ruling pen and filled it, and\nbegan to copy the border of his own pass. \"I don't suppose there's\nanything I can do?\" Lee asked.\n\n\"You can turn on the audio,\" Oliver whispered. \"They have it going all\nthe time at the shop. I don't feel right working unless there's some\nmusic driving me out of my mind.\"\n\nLee turned on the big Hawthorne Electric set with a wave of her hand;\nimbecillic music filled the air and Oliver grunted and settled down.\n\nLee and Charles listened, fingers entwined, to half an hour of slushy\nballads while Oliver worked. The news period announcer came on with some\nanesthetic trial verdicts, sports results and society notes about which\nRegan had gone where. Then--\n\n\"The local Mobsters of Michigan City, Indiana, today welcomed Maurice\nRegan to their town. Mr. Regan will assume direction of efforts to\napprehend the two European savages who murdered James Regan IV last\nmonth aboard the ore boat _Hon. John Regan_ in waters off Michigan City.\nYou probably remember that the Europeans did some damage to the vessel's\nreactor room before they fled from the ship. How they boarded the ship\nand their present whereabouts are mysteries--but they probably won't be\nmysteries long. Maurice Regan is little-known to the public, but he has\nbuilt an enviable record in the administration of the Chicago Police\nDepartment. Mr. Regan on taking charge of the case, said this: 'We know\nby traces found on the Dunes that they got away. We know from the logs\nof highway patrols that they didn't get out of the Michigan City area.\nThe only way to close the books on this matter fast is to cover the city\nwith a fine-tooth comb. Naturally and unfortunately this will mean\ninconvenience to many citizens. I hope they will bear with the\ninconveniences gladly for the sake of confining those two savages in a\nplace where they can no longer be a menace. I have methods of my own and\nthere may be complaints. Reasonable suggestions will be needed, but with\ncrackpots I have no patience.'\"\n\nThe radio began to spew more sports results. Oliver turned and waved at\nit to be silent. \"I don't like that,\" he whispered. \"I never heard of\nthis Regan in the Chicago Police.\"\n\n\"They said he wasn't in the public eye.\"\n\n\"I wasn't the public. I did some posters for the police and I knew who\nwas who. And that bit at the end. I've heard things like it before. The\nMob doesn't often admit it's in the wrong, you know. When they try to\ndisarm criticism in advance ... this Regan must be a rough fellow.\"\n\nCharles and Lee Falcaro looked at each other in sudden fear. \"We don't\nwant to hurry you, Ken,\" she said. \"But it looks as though you'd better\ndo a rush job.\"\n\nNodding, Oliver bent over the table. \"Maybe a week,\" he said hopefully.\nWith the finest pen he traced the curlicues an engraving lathe had\nevolved to make the passes foolproof. Odd, he thought--the lives of\nthese two hanging by such a weak thing as the twisted thread of color\nthat feeds from pen to paper. And, as an afterthought--I suppose mine\ndoes too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOliver came back the next day to work with concentrated fury, barely\nstopping to eat and not stopping to talk. Lee got it out of him, but not\neasily. After being trapped in a half dozen contradictions about feeling\nwell and having a headache, about his throat being sore and the pain\nhaving gone, he put down his pen and whispered steadily: \"I didn't want\nyou to worry friends. But it looks bad. There is a new crowd in town.\nTwenty couples have been pulled in by them--_couples_ to prove who they\nwere. Maybe fifty people have been pulled in for questioning--what do\nyou know about this, what do you know about that. And they've begun\nhouse searches. Anybody you don't like, you tell the new Regan about\nhim. Say he's sheltering Europeans. And his people pull them in. Why,\neverybody wants to know, are they pulling in couples who are obviously\nAmerican if they're looking for Europeans? And, everybody says, they've\nnever seen anything like it. Now--I think I'd better get back to work.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lee said. \"I think you had.\"\n\nCharles was at the window, peering around the drawn blind. \"Look at\nthat,\" he said to Lee. She came over. A big man on the street below was\nwalking, very methodically down the street.\n\n\"I will bet you,\" Charles said, \"that he'll be back this way in ten\nminutes or so--and so on through the night.\"\n\n\"I won't take the bet,\" she said. \"He's a sentry, all right. The Mob's\nlearning from their friends across the water. Learning too damned much.\nThey must be all over town.\"\n\nThey watched at the window and the sentry was back in ten minutes. On\nhis fifth tour he stopped a young couple going down the street studied\ntheir faces, drew a gun on them and blew a whistle. A patrol came and\ntook them away; the girl was hysterical. At two in the morning, the\nsentry was relieved by another, just as big and just as dangerous\nlooking. At two in the morning they were still watching and Oliver was\nstill hunched over the table tracing exquisite filigree of color.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn five days, virtually without sleep, Oliver finished two Michigan\nCity-Buffalo travel permits. The apartment house next door was hit by\nraiders while the ink dried; Charles and Lee Falcaro stood waiting\ngrotesquely armed with kitchen knives. But it must have been a tip\nrather than part of the search plan crawling nearer to their end of\ntown. The raiders did not hit their building.\n\nOliver had bought clothes according to Lee's instructions--including two\nmen's suits, Oliver's size. One she let out for Charles; the other she\ntook in for herself. She instructed Charles minutely in how he was to\nbehave, on the outside. First he roared with incredulous laughter; Lee,\nwise, in psychology assured him that she was perfectly serious. Oliver,\npuzzled by his naivete, assured him that such things were not\nuncommon--not at least in Mob Territory. Charles then roared with\nindignation and Lee roared him down. His last broken protest was: \"But\nwhat'll I do if somebody takes me up on it?\"\n\nShe shrugged, washing her hands of the matter, and went on trimming and\ndying her hair.\n\nIt was morning when she kissed Oliver good-bye, said to Charles: \"See\nyou at the station. Don't say good-bye,\" and walked from the apartment,\na dark-haired boy with a slight limp. Charles watched her down the\nstreet. A cop turned to look after her and then went on his way.\n\nHalf an hour later Charles shook hands with Oliver and went out.\n\nOliver didn't go to work that day. He sat all day at the table, drawing\nendless slow sketches of Lee Falcaro's head.\n\nTime the Great Kidder, he thought. He opens the door that shows you in\nthe next room tables of goodies, colorful and tasty, men and women\naround the tables pleasantly surprised to see you, beckoning to you to\njoin the feast. We have roast beef if you're serious, we have caviar if\nyou're experimental, we have baked alaska if you're frivolous--join the\nfeast; try a little bit of everything. So you start toward the door.\n\nTime, the Great Kidder, pulls the rug from under your feet and slams the\ndoor while the guests at the feast laugh their heads off at your painful\nbut superficial injuries.\n\nOliver slowly drew Lee's head for the fifteenth time and wished he dared\nto turn on the audio for the news. Perhaps he thought, the next voice\nyou hear will be the cops at the door.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nCharles walked down the street and ran immediately into a challenge from\na police sergeant.\n\n\"Where you from, mister?\" the cop demanded, balanced and ready to draw.\n\nCharles gulped and let Lee Falcaro's drilling take over. \"Oh, around,\nsergeant. I'm from around here.\"\n\n\"What're you so nervous about?\"\n\n\"Why, sergeant, you're such an exciting type, really. Did anybody ever\ntell you you look well in uniform?\"\n\nThe cop glared at him and said: \"If I wasn't in uniform, I'd hang one on\nyou sister. And if the force wasn't all out hunting the lunatics, that\nkilled Mr. Regan I'd pull you in for spitting on the sidewalk. Get to\nhell off my beat and stay off. I'm not forgetting your face.\"\n\nCharles scurried on. It had worked.\n\nIt worked once more with a uniformed policeman. One of the Chicago\nplain-clothes imports was the third and last. He socked Charles in the\njaw and sent him on his way with a kick in the rear. He had been\nthoroughly warned that it would probably happen: \"Count on them to\nover-react. That's the key to it. You'll make them so eager to assert\ntheir own virility, that it'll temporarily bury their primary mission.\nIt's quite likely that one or more pokes will be taken at you. All you\ncan do is take them. If you get--_when_ you get through, they'll be\ncheap at the price.\"\n\nThe sock in the jaw hadn't been very expert. The kick in the pants was\nnegligible, considering the fact that it had propelled him through the\ngate of the Michigan City Transport Terminal.\n\nBy the big terminal clock the Chicago-Buffalo Express was due in fifteen\nminutes. Its gleaming single rail, as tall as a man crossed the far end\nof the concourse. Most of the fifty-odd people in the station were\nprobably Buffalo-bound ... safe geldings who could be trusted to visit\nSyndic Territory, off the leash and return obediently. Well-dressed, of\ncourse, and many past middle-age, with a stake in the Mob Territory\nstronger than hope of freedom. One youngster, though--oh. It was Lee,\nleaning, slack-jawed, against a pillar and reading the Green Sheet.\n\nWho were the cops in the crowd? The thickset man with restless eyes, of\ncourse. The saintly-looking guy who kept moving and glancing into faces.\n\nCharles went to the newsstand and put a coin in the slot for _The Mob--A\nShort History_, by the same Arrowsmith Hunde who had brightened and\nmisinformed his youth.\n\nNothing to it, he thought. Train comes in, put your money in the\nturnstile, show your permit to the turnstile's eye, get aboard and\nthat-is-that. Unless the money is phony, or the pass is phony in which\ncase the turnstile locks and all hell breaks loose. His money was just\ndandy, but the permit now--there hadn't been any way to test it against\na turnstile's template, or time to do it if there had been a way. Was\nthe probability of boarding two to one?\n\nThe probability abruptly dropped to zero as a round little man flanked\nby two huge men entered the station.\n\n_Commander Grinnel._\n\nThe picture puzzle fell into a whole as the two plainclothesmen\ncirculating in the station eyed Grinnel and nodded to him. The big one\nabsent-mindedly made a gesture that was the start of a police salute.\n\nGrinnel was Maurice Regan--the Maurice Regan mysteriously unknown to\nOliver, who knew the Chicago police. Grinnel was a bit of a lend-lease\nfrom the North American Navy, called in because of his unique knowledge\nof Charles Orsino and Lee Falcaro, their faces, voices and behavior.\nGrinnel was the expert in combing the city without any nonsense about\nrights and mouthpieces. Grinnel was the expert who could set up a\nmilitary interior guard of the city. Grinnel was the specialist\ntemporarily invested with the rank of a Regan so he could do his job.\n\nThe round little man with the halo of hair walked briskly to the\nturnstile and there stood at a military parade rest with a look of\nresignation on his face.\n\nHow hard on me it is, he seemed to be saying, that I have such dull damn\nduty. How hard that an officer of my brilliance must do sentry-go for\nevery train to Syndic Territory.\n\nThe slack-jawed youth who was Lee Falcaro looked at him over her Green\nSheet and nodded before dipping into the Tia Juana past performances\nagain. She knew.\n\nPassengers were beginning to line up at the turnstile, smoothing out\ntheir money and fiddling with their permits. In a minute he and Lee\nFalcaro would have to join the line or stand conspicuously on the\nemptying floor. The thing was dead for twenty-four hours now, until the\nnext train--and then Grinnel headed across the floor looking very\nimpersonal. The look of a man going to the men's room. The station cops\nand Grinnel's two bruisers drifted together at the turnstile and began\nto chat.\n\nCharles followed Grinnel, wearing the same impersonal look, and entered\nthe room almost on his heels.\n\nGrinnel saw him in a wash-bowl mirror; simultaneously he half turned,\nopened his mouth to yell and whipped his hand into his coat. A single\nround-house right from Charles crunched into the soft side of his neck.\nHe fell with his head twisted at an odd angle. Blood began to run from\nthe corner of his mouth onto his shirt.\n\n\"Remember Martha?\" Charles whispered down at the body. \"That was for\nmurder.\" He looked around the tiled room. There was a mop closet with\nthe door ajar, and Grinnel's flabby body fitted in it.\n\nCharles walked from the washroom to the line of passengers across the\nfloor. It seemed to go on for miles. Lee Falcaro was no longer lounging\nagainst the past. He spotted her in line, still slack-jawed, still\ngaping over the magazine. The monorail began to sing shrilly with the\nvibration of the train braking a mile away, and the turnstile \"unlocked\"\nlight went on.\n\nThere was the usual number of fumblers, the usual number of \"please\nunfold your currency\" flashes. Lee carried through to the end with her\nslovenly pose. For her the sign said: \"incorrect denominations.\" Behind\nher a man snarled: \"for Christ's sake, kid, we're all waiting on you!\"\nThe cops only half noticed; they were talking. When Charles got to the\nturnstile one of the cops was saying: \"Maybe it's something he ate.\nHow'd _you_ like somebody to barge in--\"\n\nThe rest was lost in the clicking of the turnstile that let him through.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe settled in a very pneumatic chair as the train accelerated evenly to\na speed of three hundred and fifty miles per hour. A sign in the car\nsaid that the next stop was Buffalo. And there was Lee, lurching up the\naisle against the acceleration. She spotted him, tossed the Green Sheet\nin the Air and fell into his lap.\n\n\"Disgusting!\" snarled a man across the aisle. \"Simply disgusting!\"\n\n\"You haven't seen anything yet,\" Lee told him, and kissed Charles on the\nmouth.\n\nThe man choked: \"I shall certainly report this to the authorities when\nwe arrive in Buffalo!\"\n\n\"Mmm,\" said Lee, preoccupied. \"Do that, mister. Do that.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\n\"I didn't like his reaction,\" Charles told her in the anteroom of F. W.\nTaylor's office. \"I didn't talk to him long on the phone, but I don't\nlike his reaction at all. He seemed to think I was exaggerating. Or all\nwet. Or a punk kid.\"\n\n\"I can assure him you're not that,\" Lee Falcaro said warmly. \"Call on me\nany time.\"\n\nHe gave her a worried smile. The door opened then and they went in.\n\nUncle Frank looked up. \"We'd just about written you two off,\" he said.\n\"What's it like?\"\n\n\"Bad,\" Charles said. \"Worse than anything you've imagined. There's an\nunderground, all right, and they are practicing assassination.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" the old man said. \"We'll have to shake up the bodyguard\norganization. Make 'em de rigeur at all hours, screen 'em and see that\nthey really know how to shoot. I hate to meddle, but we can't have the\nGovernment knocking our people off.\"\n\n\"It's worse than that,\" Lee said. \"There's a tie-up between the\nGovernment and the Mob. We got away from Ireland aboard a speed boat and\nwe were picked up by a Mob lakes ore ship. It had been running gasoline\nand ammunition to the Government. Jimmy Regan was in charge of the deal.\nWe jumped into Lake Michigan and made our way back here. We were in Mob\nTerritory--down among the small-timers--long enough to establish that\nthe Mob and Government are hand in glove. One of these day's they're\ngoing to jump us.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Taylor said softly. \"I've thought so for a long time.\"\n\nCharles burst out: \"Then for God's sake, Uncle Frank, why haven't you\n_done_ anything? You don't know what it's like out there. The\nGovernment's a nightmare. They have slaves. And the Mob's not much\nbetter. Numbers! Restrictions! Permits! Passes! And they don't call it\nthat, but they have taxes!\"\n\n\"They're mad,\" Lee said. \"Quite mad. And I'm talking technically.\nNeurotics and psychotics swarm in the streets of Mob Territory. The\nGovernment, naturally--but the Mob was a shock. We've got to get ready,\nMr. Taylor. Every psychotic or severe neurotic in Syndic Territory is a\npotential agent of theirs.\"\n\n\"Don't just check off the Government, darling,\" Charles said tensely.\n\"They've got to be smashed. They're no good to themselves or anybody\nelse. Life's a burden there if only they knew it. And they're holding\ndown the natives by horrible cruelty.\"\n\nTaylor leaned back and asked: \"What do you recommend?\"\n\nCharles said: \"A fighting fleet and an army.\"\n\nLee said: \"Mass diagnosis of the unstable. Screening of severe cases and\ntreatment where it's indicated. Riveredge must be a plague-spot of\nagents.\"\n\nTaylor shook his head and told them: \"It won't do.\"\n\nCharles was aghast. \"It won't _do_? Uncle Frank, what the hell do you\nmean, it won't do? Didn't we make it clear? They want to invade us and\nloot us and subject us!\"\n\n\"It won't do,\" Taylor said. \"I choose the devil we know. A fighting\nfleet is out. We'll arm our merchant vessels and hope for the best. A\nfull-time army is out. We'll get together some-kind of militia. And a\nroundup of the unstable is out.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Lee demanded. \"My people have worked out perfectly effective\ntechniques--\"\n\n\"Let me talk, please. I have a feeling that it won't be any good, but\nhear me out.\n\n\"I'll take your black art first, Lee. As you know, I have played with\nhistory. To a historian, your work has been very interesting. The\nsequence was this: study of abnormal psychology collapsed under\nLieberman's findings, study of abnormal psychology revived by you when\nyou invalidated Lieberman's findings. I suggest that Lieberman and his\nfollowers were correct--and that you were correct. I suggest that what\nchanged was the makeup of the population. That would mean that before\nLieberman there were plenty of neurotics and psychotics to study, that\nin Lieberman's time there were so few that earlier generalizations were\ninvalidated, and that now--in our time, Lee--neurotics and psychotics\nare among us again in increasingly ample numbers.\"\n\nThe girl opened her mouth, shut it again and thoughtfully studied her\nnails.\n\n\"I will not tolerate,\" Taylor went on, \"a roundup or a registration, or\nmass treatment or any such violation of the Syndic's spirit.\"\n\nCharles exploded: \"Damn it, this is a matter of life or death to the\nSyndic!\"\n\n\"No, Charles. Nothing can be a matter of life or death to the Syndic.\nWhen anything becomes a matter of life or death to the Syndic, the\nSyndic is already dead, its morale, is already disintegrated, its credit\nalready gone. What is left is not the Syndic but the Syndic's dead\nshell. I am not placed so that I can say objectively now whether the\nSyndic is dead or alive. I fear it is dying. The rising tide of\nneurotics is a symptom. The suggestion from you two, who should be\nimbued with the old happy-go-lucky, we-can't-miss esprit of the Syndic\nthat we cower behind mercenaries instead of trusting the people who made\nus--that's another symptom. Dick Reiner's rise to influence on a policy\nof driving the Government from the seas is another symptom.\n\n\"I mentioned the devil we know as my choice. That's the status quo, even\nthough I have reason to fear it's crumbling beneath our feet. If it is,\nit may last out our time. We'll shore it up with armed merchantmen and a\nmilitia. If the people are with us now as they always have been, that'll\ndo it. The devil we don't know is what we'll become if we radically\ndislocate Syndic life and attitudes.\n\n\"I can't back a fighting fleet. I can't back a regular army. I can't\nback any restrictive measure on the freedom of anybody but an\napprehended criminal. Read history. It has taught me not to meddle, it\nhas taught me that no man should think himself clever enough or good\nenough to dare it. _That_ is the lesson history teaches us.\n\n\"Who can know what he's doing when he doesn't even know why he does it?\nBless the bright Cromagnon for inventing the bow and damn him for\ninventing missile warfare. Bless the stubby little Sumerians for\nmiracles in gold and lapis lazuli and damn them for burying a dead\nqueen's hand-maidens living in her tomb. Bless Shih Hwang-Ti for\nbuilding the Great Wall between northern barbarism and southern culture,\nand damn him for burning every book in China. Bless King Minos for the\nease of Cnossian flush toilets and damn him for his yearly tribute of\nGreek sacrificial victims. Bless Pharaoh for peace and damn him for\nslavery. Bless the Greeks for restricting population so the well-fed few\ncould kindle a watch-tower in the west, and damn the prostitution and\nsodomy and wars of colonization by which they did it. Bless the Romans\nfor their strength to smash down every wall that hemmed their building\ngenius, and damn them for their weakness that never broke the bloody\ngrip of Etruscan savagery on their minds. Bless the Jews who discovered\nthe fatherhood of God and damn them who limited it to the survivors of a\nsurgical operation. Bless the Christians who abolished the surgical\npreliminaries and damn them who substituted a thousand cerebral\nquibbles. Bless Justinian for the Code of Law and damn him for his\ncountless treacheries that were the prototype of the wretched Byzantine\nmillenium. Bless the churchmen for teaching and preaching, and damn,\nthem for drawing a line beyond which they could only teach and preach in\nperil of the stake.\n\n\"Bless the navigators who, opened the new world to famine-ridden Europe,\nand damn them for syphillis. Bless the red-skins who bred maize, the\ngreat preserver of life and damn them for breeding maize the great\ndestroyer of topsoil. Bless the Virginia planters for the solace of\ntobacco and damn them for the red gullies they left where forests had\nstood. Bless the obstetricians with forceps who eased the agony of labor\nand damn them for bringing countless monsters into the world to\nreproduce their kind. Bless the Point Four boys who slew the malaria\nmosquitoes of Ceylon and damn them for letting more Sinhalese be born\nthen five Ceylons could feed.\n\n\"Who knows what he is doing, why he does it or what the consequences\nwill be?\n\n\"Let the social scientists play with their theories if they like; I'm\nfond of poetry myself. The fact is that they have not so far solved what\nI call the two-billion-body problem. With brilliant hindsight some of\nthem tell us that more than a dozen civilizations have gone down into\nthe darkness before us. I see no reason why ours should not go down into\nthe darkness with them, nor do I see any reason why we should not\nmeanwhile enjoy ourselves collecting sense-impressions to be remembered\nwith pleasure in old age. No; I will not agitate for extermination of\nthe Government and hegemony over the Mob. Such a policy would\nautomatically, inevitably and immediately entail many, many violent\ndeaths and painful wounds. The wrong kind of sense-impressions. I shall,\nwith fear and trembling, recommend the raising of a militia--a purely\ndefensive, extremely sloppy militia--and pray that it will not Involve\nus in a war of aggression.\"\n\nHe looked at the two of them and shrugged. \"Lee, so stern, Charles so\ngrim,\" he said. \"I suppose you're dedicated now.\" He looked at the desk.\n\nHe thought: _I have a faint desire to take the pistol from my desk and\nshoot you both. I have a nervous feeling that you're about to embark on\na crusade to awaken Syndic Territory to its perils. You think the fate\nof civilization hinges on you. You're right, of course. The fate of\ncivilization hinges on every one of us at any given moment. We are all\ncomponents in the two-billion-body problem. Somehow for a century we've\nachieved in Syndic Territory for almost everybody the civil liberties,\npeace of mind and living standards that were enjoyed by the middle\nclasses before 1914--plus longer life, better health, a more generous\nmorality, increased command over nature; minus the servant problem and\ncertain superstitions. A handful of wonderfully pleasant decades. When\nyou look back over history you wonder who in his right mind could ask\nfor more. And you wonder who would dare to presume to tamper with it._\n\nHe studied the earnest young faces. There was so much that he might\nsay--but he shrugged again.\n\n\"Bless you,\" he said. \"Gather ye sense impression while ye may. Some\nlike pointer readings, some like friction on the mucous membranes. Now\ngo about your business; I have work to do.\"\n\nHe didn't really. When he was alone he leaned back and laughed and\nlaughed.\n\nWin, lose or draw, those two would go far and enjoy themselves mightily\nalong the way. Which was what counted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Transcriber's Note: No Chapter II header in original.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
