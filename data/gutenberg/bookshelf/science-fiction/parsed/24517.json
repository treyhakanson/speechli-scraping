All the way up the half-mile precipice it fingered and\nwrenched away at groaning ice-slabs. It screamed over the top, whirled\nsnow in a dervish dance around the hollow there, piled snow into the\nlong furrow plowed ruler-straight through streamlined hummocks of snow.\n\nThe sun glinted on black rock glazed by ice, chasms and ridges and\nbridges of ice. It lit the snow slope to a frozen glare, penciled black\nshadow down the long furrow, and flashed at the furrow's end on a thing\nof metal and plastics, an artifact thrown down in the dead wilderness.\n\nNothing grew, nothing flew, nothing walked, nothing talked. But the\nthing in the hollow was stirring in stiff jerks like a snake with its\nback broken or a clockwork toy running down. When the movements stopped,\nthere was a click and a strange sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible\nmore than a yard away, weary but still cocky, there leaked from the\nshape in the hollow the sound of a human voice.\n\n\"I've tried my hands and arms and they seem to work,\" it began. \"I've\nwiggled my toes with entire success. It's well on the cards that I'm all\nin one piece and not broken up at all, though I don't see how it could\nhappen. Right now I don't feel like struggling up and finding out. I'm\nfine where I am. I'll just lie here for a while and relax, and get some\nof the story on tape. This suit's got a built-in recorder, I might as\nwell use it. That way even if I'm not as well as I feel, I'll leave a\nmessage. You probably know we're back and wonder what went wrong.\n\n\"I suppose I'm in a state of shock. That's why I can't seem to get up.\nWho wouldn't be shocked after luck like that?\n\n\"I've always been lucky, I guess. Luck got me a place in the _Whale_.\nSure I'm a good astronomer but so are lots of other guys. If I were ten\nyears older, it would have been an honor, being picked for the first\nlong jump in the first starship ever. At my age it was luck.\n\n\"You'll want to know if the ship worked. Well, she did. Went like a\nbomb. We got lined up between Earth and Mars, you'll remember, and James\npushed the button marked 'Jump'. Took his finger off the button and\nthere we were: _Alpha Centauri_. Two months later your time, one second\nlater by us. We covered our whole survey assignment like that, smooth as\na pint of old and mild which right now I could certainly use. Better yet\nwould be a pint of hot black coffee with sugar in. Failing that, I could\neven go for a long drink of cold water. There was never anything wrong\nwith the _Whale_ till right at the end and even then I doubt if it was\nthe ship itself that fouled things up.\n\n\"That was some survey assignment. We astronomers really lived. Wait till\nyou see--but of course you won't. I could weep when I think of those\nmiles of lovely color film, all gone up in smoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm shocked all right. I never said who I was. Matt Hennessy, from\nFarside Observatory, back of the Moon, just back from a proving flight\n_cum_ astronomical survey in the starship _Whale_. Whoever you are who\nfinds this tape, you're made. Take it to any radio station or newspaper\noffice. You'll find you can name your price and don't take any wooden\nnickels.\n\n\"Where had I got to? I'd told you how we happened to find Chang, hadn't\nI? That's what the natives called it. Walking, talking natives on a blue\nsky planet with 1.1 g gravity and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere at\nfifteen p.s.i. The odds against finding Chang on a six-sun survey on the\nfirst star jump ever must be up in the googols. We certainly were lucky.\n\n\"The Chang natives aren't very technical--haven't got space travel for\ninstance. They're good astronomers, though. We were able to show them\nour sun, in their telescopes. In their way, they're a highly civilized\npeople. Look more like cats than people, but they're people all right.\nIf you doubt it, chew these facts over.\n\n\"One, they learned our language in four weeks. When I say they, I mean a\nten-man team of them.\n\n\"Two, they brew a near-beer that's a lot nearer than the canned stuff we\nhad aboard the _Whale_.\n\n\"Three, they've a great sense of humor. Ran rather to silly practical\njokes, but still. Can't say I care for that hot-foot and belly-laugh\nstuff myself, but tastes differ.\n\n\"Four, the ten-man language team also learned chess and table tennis.\n\n\"But why go on? People who talk English, drink beer, like jokes and beat\nme at chess or table-tennis are people for my money, even if they look\nlike tigers in trousers.\n\n\"It was funny the way they won all the time at table tennis. They\ncertainly weren't so hot at it. Maybe that ten per cent extra gravity\nput us off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov was our champion. He won\nsometimes. The rest of us seemed to lose whichever Chingsi we played.\nThere again it wasn't so much that they were good. How could they be, in\nthe time? It was more that we all seemed to make silly mistakes when we\nplayed them and that's fatal in chess. Of course it's a screwy\nsituation, playing chess with something that grows its own fur coat, has\nyellow eyes an inch and a half long and long white whiskers. Could _you_\nhave kept your mind on the game?\n\n\"And don't think I fell victim to their feline charm. The children were\npets, but you didn't feel like patting the adults on their big grinning\nheads. Personally I didn't like the one I knew best. He was\ncalled--well, we called him Charley, and he was the ethnologist,\nambassador, contact man, or whatever you like to call him, who came back\nwith us. Why I disliked him was because he was always trying to get the\nedge on you. All the time he had to be top. Great sense of humor, of\ncourse. I nearly broke my neck on that butter-slide he fixed up in the\nmetal alleyway to the _Whale's_ engine room. Charley laughed fit to\nbust, everyone laughed, I even laughed myself though doing it hurt\nme more than the tumble had. Yes, life and soul of the party, old\nCharley ...\n\n\"My last sight of the _Minnow_ was a cabin full of dead and dying men,\nthe sweetish stink of burned flesh and the choking reek of scorching\ninsulation, the boat jolting and shuddering and beginning to break up,\nand in the middle of the flames, still unhurt, was Charley. He was\nlaughing ...\n\n\"My God, it's dark out here. Wonder how high I am. Must be all of fifty\nmiles, and doing eight hundred miles an hour at least. I'll be doing\nmore than that when I land. What's final velocity for a fifty-mile fall?\nSame as a fifty thousand mile fall, I suppose; same as escape;\ntwenty-four thousand miles an hour. I'll make a mess ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's better. Why didn't I close my eyes before? Those star streaks\nmade me dizzy. I'll make a nice shooting star when I hit air. Come to\nthink of it, I must be deep in air now. Let's take a look.\n\n\"It's getting lighter. Look at those peaks down there! Like great\nknives. I don't seem to be falling as fast as I expected though. Almost\nseem to be floating. Let's switch on the radio and tell the world hello.\nHello, earth ... hello, again ... and good-by ...\n\n\"Sorry about that. I passed out. I don't know what I said, if anything,\nand the suit recorder has no playback or eraser. What must have happened\nis that the suit ran out of oxygen, and I lost consciousness due to\nanoxia. I dreamed I switched on the radio, but I actually switched on\nthe emergency tank, thank the Lord, and that brought me round.\n\n\"Come to think of it, why not crack the suit and breath fresh air\ninstead of bottled?\n\n\"No. I'd have to get up to do that. I think I'll just lie here a little\nbit longer and get properly rested up before I try anything big like\nstanding up.\n\n\"I was telling about the return journey, wasn't I? The long jump back\nhome, which should have dumped us between the orbits of Earth and Mars.\nInstead of which, when James took his finger off the button, the\nmass-detector showed nothing except the noise-level of the universe.\n\n\"We were out in that no place for a day. We astronomers had to establish\nour exact position relative to the solar system. The crew had to find\nout exactly what went wrong. The physicists had to make mystic passes in\nfront of meters and mutter about residual folds in stress-free space.\nOur task was easy, because we were about half a light-year from the sun.\nThe crew's job was also easy: they found what went wrong in less than\nhalf an hour.\n\n\"It still seems incredible. To program the ship for a star-jump, you\nmerely told it where you were and where you wanted to go. In practical\nterms, that entailed first a series of exact measurements which had to\nbe translated into the somewhat abstruse co-ordinate system we used\nbased on the topological order of mass-points in the galaxy. Then you\ncut a tape on the computer and hit the button. Nothing was wrong with\nthe computer. Nothing was wrong with the engines. We'd hit the right\nbutton and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed for. All we'd done was aim\nfor the wrong place. It hurts me to tell you this and I'm just attached\npersonnel with no space-flight tradition. In practical terms, one highly\ntrained crew member had punched a wrong pattern of holes on the tape.\nAnother equally skilled had failed to notice this when reading back. A\nchildish error, highly improbable; twice repeated, thus squaring the\nimprobability. Incredible, but that's what happened.\n\n\"Anyway, we took good care with the next lot of measurements. That's why\nwe were out there so long. They were cross-checked about five times. I\ngot sick so I climbed into a spacesuit and went outside and took some\nphotographs of the Sun which I hoped would help to determine hydrogen\ndensity in the outer regions. When I got back everything was ready. We\ndisposed ourselves about the control room and relaxed for all we were\nworth. We were all praying that this time nothing would go wrong, and\nall looking forward to seeing Earth again after four months subjective\ntime away, except for Charley, who was still chuckling and shaking his\nhead, and Captain James who was glaring at Charley and obviously wishing\nhuman dignity permitted him to tear Charley limb from limb. Then James\npressed the button.\n\n\"Everything twanged like a bowstring. I felt myself turned inside out,\npassed through a small sieve, and poured back into shape. The entire bow\nwall-screen was full of Earth. Something was wrong all right, and this\ntime it was much, much worse. We'd come out of the jump about two\nhundred miles above the Pacific, pointed straight down, traveling at a\nrelative speed of about two thousand miles an hour.\n\n\"It was a fantastic situation. Here was the _Whale_, the most powerful\nship ever built, which could cover fifty light-years in a subjective\ntime of one second, and it was helpless. For, as of course you know, the\nstar-drive couldn't be used again for at least two hours.\n\n\"The _Whale_ also had ion rockets of course, the standard\ndeuterium-fusion thing with direct conversion. As again you know, this\nis good for interplanetary flight because you can run it continuously\nand it has extremely high exhaust velocity. But in our situation it was\nno good because it has rather a low thrust. It would have taken more\ntime than we had to deflect us enough to avoid a smash. We had five\nminutes to abandon ship.\n\n\"James got us all into the _Minnow_ at a dead run. There was no time to\ntake anything at all except the clothes we stood in. The _Minnow_ was\nmeant for short heavy hops to planets or asteroids. In addition to the\nion drive it had emergency atomic rockets, using steam for reaction\nmass. We thanked God for that when Cazamian canceled our downwards\nvelocity with them in a few seconds. We curved away up over China and\nfrom about fifty miles high we saw the _Whale_ hit the Pacific. Six\nhundred tons of mass at well over two thousand miles an hour make an\nalmighty splash. By now you'll have divers down, but I doubt they'll\nsalvage much you can use.\n\n\"I wonder why James went down with the ship, as the saying is? Not that\nit made any difference. It must have broken his heart to know that his\nlovely ship was getting the chopper. Or did he suspect another human\nerror?\n\n\"We didn't have time to think about that, or even to get the radio\nworking. The steam rockets blew up. Poor Cazamian was burnt to a crisp.\nOnly thing that saved me was the spacesuit I was still wearing. I\nsnapped the face plate down because the cabin was filling with fumes. I\nsaw Charley coming out of the toilet--that's how he'd escaped--and I saw\nhim beginning to laugh. Then the port side collapsed and I fell out.\n\n\"I saw the launch spinning away, glowing red against a purplish black\nsky. I tumbled head over heels towards the huge curved shield of earth\nfifty miles below. I shut my eyes and that's about all I remember. I\ndon't see how any of us could have survived. I think we're all dead.\n\n\"I'll have to get up and crack this suit and let some air in. But I\ncan't. I fell fifty miles without a parachute. I'm dead so I can't stand\nup.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was silence for a while except for the vicious howl of the wind.\nThen snow began to shift on the ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and\ncame shakily to his feet. He moved slowly around for some time. After\nabout two hours he returned to the hollow, squatted down and switched on\nthe recorder. The voice began again, considerably wearier.\n\n\"Hello there. I'm in the bleakest wilderness I've ever seen. This place\nmakes the moon look cozy. There's precipice around me every way but one\nand that's up. So it's up I'll have to go till I find a way to go down.\nI've been chewing snow to quench my thirst but I could eat a horse. I\npicked up a short-wave broadcast on my suit but couldn't understand a\nword. Not English, not French, and there I stick. Listened to it for\nfifteen minutes just to hear a human voice again. I haven't much hope of\nreaching anyone with my five milliwatt suit transmitter but I'll keep\ntrying.\n\n\"Just before I start the climb there are two things I want to get on\ntape. The first is how I got here. I've remembered something from my\nmilitary training, when I did some parachute jumps. Terminal velocity\nfor a human body falling through air is about one hundred twenty m.p.h.\nFalling fifty miles is no worse than falling five hundred feet. You'd be\nlucky to live through a five hundred foot fall, true, but I've been\nlucky. The suit is bulky but light and probably slowed my fall. I hit a\nsixty mile an hour updraft this side of the mountain, skidded downhill\nthrough about half a mile of snow and fetched up in a drift. The suit is\npart worn but still operational. I'm fine.\n\n\"The second thing I want to say is about the Chingsi, and here it is:\nwatch out for them. Those jokers are dangerous. I'm not telling how\nbecause I've got a scientific reputation to watch. You'll have to figure\nit out for yourselves. Here are the clues:\n\n (1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but after all they aren't human. On an\n     alien world a hundred light-years away, why shouldn't alien\n     talents develop? A talent that's so uncertain and rudimentary here\n     that most people don't believe it, might be highly developed out\n     there.\n\n (2) The _Whale_ expedition did fine till it found Chang. Then it hit a\n     seam of bad luck. Real stinking bad luck that went on and on till\n     it looks fishy. We lost the ship, we lost the launch, all but one\n     of us lost our lives. We couldn't even win a game of ping-pong.\n\n\"So what is luck, good or bad? Scientifically speaking, future chance\nevents are by definition chance. They can turn out favorable or not.\nWhen a preponderance of chance events has occurred unfavorably, you've\ngot bad luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of chance results that didn't\ngo your way. But the gambler defines it differently. For him, luck\nrefers to the future, and you've got bad luck when future chance events\nwon't go your way. Scientific investigations into this have been\ninconclusive, but everyone knows that some people are lucky and others\naren't. All we've got are hints and glimmers, the fumbling touch of a\nrudimentary talent. There's the evil eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck\nbringers. Superstition? Maybe; but ask the insurance companies about\naccident prones. What's in a name? Call a man unlucky and you're\nsuperstitious. Call him accident prone and that's sound business sense.\nI've said enough.\n\n\"All the same, search the space-flight records, talk to the actuaries.\nWhen a ship is working perfectly and is operated by a hand-picked crew\nof highly trained men in perfect condition, how often is it wrecked by a\nseries of silly errors happening one after another in defiance of\nprobability?\n\n\"I'll sign off with two thoughts, one depressing and one cheering. A\nsingle Chingsi wrecked our ship and our launch. What could a whole\nplanetful of them do?\n\n\"On the other hand, a talent that manipulates chance events is bound to\nbe chancy. No matter how highly developed it can't be surefire. The\nproof is that I've survived to tell the tale.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt twenty below zero and fifty miles an hour the wind ravaged the\nmountain. Peering through his polarized vizor at the white waste and the\nsnow-filled air howling over it, sliding and stumbling with every step\non a slope that got gradually steeper and seemed to go on forever, Matt\nHennessy began to inch his way up the north face of Mount Everest.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ February\n    1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
