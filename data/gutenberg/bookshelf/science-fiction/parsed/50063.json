Someone or something was also\nwriting--unseen but at his elbow. It was perhaps fifteen minutes before\nhe noticed. Conspicuous at the center of the next blank sheet of paper\nhe reached for, part of a word was already inscribed:\n\n\"_Nippe ..._\"\n\nThe writing was faint and wavering but in the same shade of blue ink as\nthat in his own pen.\n\nEd Dukas said \"Hey?\" to himself, mildly.\n\nThe frown creases between his hazel eyes deepened. They were evidence\nof strain that was not new. The stubby forefinger and thumb of his\nright hand rubbed their calloused whorls together. Surprise on his\nsquare face gave way to a cool watchfulness that, in the last ten years\nof guarded living, had been grimed into his nature. Ed Dukas was now\ntwenty-two. This era was hurtling and troubled. Since his childhood,\nEd had become acquainted with wonder, beauty, hate, opportunity and\ndisaster on a cosmic level, luxury, adventure, love. Sometimes he had\neven found peace of mind.\n\nHe put down his pen, leaving the letter he had been writing suspended\nin mid-sentence:\n\n... _Pardon the preaching, Les. Human nature and everything else seems\nbooby-trapped. They drummed the idea of courage and careful thinking\ninto us at school. Because so much that is new and changing is a big\nthing to handle. Still, we'll have to stick to a course of action._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow Ed sat with his elbows on his table, that other, no longer quite\nblank, sheet of paper held lightly in his hands. He sat there, a stocky\nyoung man, his hair cut short like a hedge, the clues of his existence\naround him: student banners on the walls; a stereoptic picture of his\ntrack team--in color of course; ditto for his astrophysics class; his\nbookcase; his tiny sensipsych set; and the delicate instruments that\nany guy who hoped to reach the next human goal, the nearer stars, had\nto learn about.\n\nHis girl's picture, part of any youth's pattern of life for the last\nthree centuries, smiled from beside him on the table. Dark. Strong as\ngirls were apt to be, these days. Beautiful in a rough-hewn way. But\neven with all that strength to rely on, he was worried about her more\nthan ever now. Times were strange. He glanced at her likeness once.\nThen his gaze bounced back to the paper in his hands.\n\nHis nerves tingled at the eerie thing that was happening there. He\ndidn't know whether to feel afraid of it or hopeful. Man was stumbling\ntoward ultimate mastery of his own flesh and the forces of the\nuniverse. But the distance remained enormous, though technical science\nwas moving forward, perhaps too swiftly, on all fronts. Part of Ed's\nfear before the unknown was like the stage fright of an inexperienced\nactor. You never quite knew what was ahead or how to judge anything\nstrange that you saw.\n\n\"_Nippe...._\"\n\nAt the end of the line which made the \"e\" there was a tiny speck of\nblue ink. Almost imperceptibly, like the minute hand of a clock, it\ncrept on, curving and looping to form another letter.\n\n\"_Nipper_\" the word was now.\n\nThis could be somebody's funny gag, Ed thought. Somebody with a gadget.\nThe world is full of gadgets these days. Maybe too full.\n\nIt occurred to him that a pal might be playing a joke with some simple\ndevice bought in a novelty store. But probability leaned toward\nsomething deeper and more costly. Who knew? Someone might have invented\na way to make a man invisible. You didn't deny that anything could be,\nany more.\n\n\"Speak up!\" he ordered softly.\n\nBut no answer came, and his wondering gaze found nothing unusual in the\nroom around him. He froze. \"_Nipper._\" It could be part of a message,\nan honest attempt to convey vitally important information. Or it could\nbe the forerunner of violence aimed in his direction. Through no fault\nof his own, he had had enemies for ten years. Tonight they might\nreally act. To die was still possible. In spite of vitaplasm. Or the\nmore tedious method that employed natural flesh. Or the tiny cylinders\nhidden away in vaults. Lives were now in danger again. Human, and\nalmost human....\n\nFor a moment Ed wanted to give a warning and to call others into\nconsultation. He wanted to shout, \"Dad! Mom! Come here!\"\n\nHe didn't do so. Between him and the precise, benign personality that\nhe called Dad there was a gradually growing barrier. And for his\nmother, beautiful and young by art and science, he had that feeling of\nmale protectiveness that takes the form of keeping possible dangers\nhidden.\n\nEd decided to work on his own. Being essentially careful and slow\nmoving when it came to delicate processes, he had not touched that\ncreeping droplet of ink. Its secret might thus be destroyed. No, he'd\nnever do a thing so foolish.\n\nSwiftly he folded the paper and fastened the writing under his\nmicroscope. The ink speck was almost dry now, and nothing was hidden in\nit. The line of the writing itself was odd under magnification. Here\nand there it showed tiny, irregular dots at spaced intervals, connected\nby fine, dragging marks. That was all.\n\nOf course he realized that _Nipper_ might be only the first cryptic\nword of a message and that he had only to wait and see what would\nfollow.\n\nUntil he began to wait, however, the significance of the word itself\neluded him. A child's nickname was all that it suggested.\n\nBut now his mind bore down on it. And he had the answer almost at\nonce. A small boy climbing the wall of a pretty garden. And his casual\nchristening by a pleasant stranger who met him thus for the first time.\nAmong more vivid and significant details, the memory of the name itself\nhad been mislaid. But Ed Dukas knew that in his boyhood one person had\nalways called him Nipper: Uncle Mitch Prell, and nobody else. Now it\nseemed like a secret sign.\n\nEd gulped, his reaction suspended somewhere between shocked pleasure\nand a frosty sense of eeriness. To have a friend, whom he had loved\nas a child, vanish into space and into apparent nonexistence after\nbecoming a fugitive, and then to have what _seemed_ to be this\nfriend try to communicate again after ten years, and in this weird\nmanner--well--how would you say it? Ghosts, of course, were pure\nsuperstition. But in this age one could still react as if to the\nsupernatural--with tingling hide and quickened heartbeats. In fact,\nwith the vast growth of technology, more than ever was such a feeling\npossible.\n\n\"Uncle Mitch!\" Ed Dukas called quietly.\n\nAgain there was no reply. The name on the paper still could be somebody\nelse's trick. Granger's, maybe. There were ways for him to have learned\na nickname. Many people might admire Granger as much as others despised\nhim. And it was hard to say what he might do, or when. Or how, for that\nmatter. He was clever. And wrong.\n\nThere was still another thing to remember. Ed did not altogether love\nthe memory of his uncle, Dr. Mitchell Prell. For this famous scientist\nwas marked with the stigma of responsibility for a terrific mishap. No,\nPrell did not bear the burden alone. There were other scientists, it\nwas said, who had poked too roughly, and with too sharp a stick, into\nNature's deepest lair. Nature had snarled back. Ed had grown up with\nthe public hate that had resulted. He had fought against it, yet he had\nfelt it, until sometimes he did not know where he himself stood.\n\nNow he waited for more writing to be traced on the paper under the\nmicroscope. A minute passed, but there was nothing more. He did notice,\nhowever, that the letters of that one word matched roughly the austere\nhandwriting of his uncle.\n\nOnce he glanced toward the window with some nervousness. Outside, the\nnight was glorious. Never again would nights be hideous as they once\nhad been. He saw lush gardens under silver light. If any devilish\nthing not known until recent months slithered through the shadows, it\nkept hidden. Ed saw other neighboring houses. New trees had grown to\nfair size in ten years. Older and larger trees remained lopsided and\ngnarled. But their burn scars had healed.\n\nOtherwise there was nothing left to monument the past--except, perhaps,\nthe sullen mutter of voices in nearby streets.\n\nBut Ed Dukas's mind, triggered by the name _Nipper_ and by awareness\nof Mitchell Prell, slipped briefly away from the present. He had\noften explored memory to find understanding. At school, after the\ncatastrophe, psychiatrists had made every kid do that. So that neuroses\nmight be broken or lessened or avoided. So that animal terror would not\ndraw a curtain over a mental record of an interlude. So that memory\nmight not be lodged, like a red coal of hysteria, in the subconscious.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a trained dog leaping through a flaming hoop, Ed Dukas's thoughts\nplunged back to that zone where his earliest memories faded into the\nmists of infancy:\n\nA birthday cake with two candles. A fountain splashing in the patio of\nthis same house. A dachshund, Schnitz, which a little boy put in almost\nthe same category as the flat, rubber-tired robots that cleaned the\nrooms. Where was the distinction between machines and animals?\n\nFlowers, hummingbirds, and butterflies in the garden. The echoes of\nfootsteps on stone floors. Toy space ships and star ships at Christmas.\nThe star ships were things yet to become real.... There was endless\ninterest in life then. But even in those days there were signs of\ncautious and puzzled guidance.\n\nThere was the sensipsych, of course. It was a wonderful box of dark\nwood in the living room. A soft couch folded down from it. There you\nlay, and for a moment strange golden light flickered into your eyes.\nYou went to sleep, but you did not really go to sleep. For you became\nsomeone else. Maybe a cartoon character in a world where everything\nlooked different. Funny things happened to you that frightened you at\nfirst; but then you laughed when you found that there was no harm in\nthem.\n\nOr, instead of being in such a crazy fairyland, you might be a real\nboy in space armor jumping across the surface of a huge chunk of rock\ncalled an asteroid, while stars and a blazing white sun stared at you\nfrom blackness. You were very busy helping others to roof the asteroid\nwith crystal, and to put air underneath, and to build houses and\nfactories where people might live and work. Always more and more people\nspreading out and out to populate the empty worlds of space.\n\nBut you were never on that sensipsych couch for very long, or too\noften. You would wake up, and there was Mom saying, \"Enough, fella.\nA little of that sort of thing goes a great way, even when the\nexperiences are rugged and educational and not just whimsical nonsense.\"\n\nEd Dukas would be angry and puzzled. For it had seemed that those\nvisions, going on without end, could bring joy forever.\n\n\"You'll understand sometime, Eddie,\" his mother would say, consoling\nhim. \"What happens to you by sensipsych is just make-believe. What we\ncall recorded sensory experience. Some of it really happened to other\npeople. Some of it is just made up. It can teach you things. But too\nmuch is very bad. Not so long ago folks found out.\"\n\nThere was something tender and hard and even scared in his mother's\nwords.\n\nEd's dad also had his comments. Dad was something called a minerals\nexpert.\n\n\"Come on, Eddie, let's rassle,\" he'd say. \"Stick your chin out, boy.\nLet's see how tough you can look. No, not mean-tough.... That's better.\nWe've got to lick the times we live in. And something in ourselves.\nWith machines doing so much for us, life can be soft. And sensipsych\ndreams are soft. Everything in moderation. Dreams can make you feel as\nhelpless as an oyster. Until you despise yourself and the whole race.\nYes, people found out. They were always meant to feel strong and proud,\nand they must have tasks equal to their increasing powers. Otherwise\nthere's spiritual rot. We've got to be ready for anything, feel our\nway, try to be ready to keep our balance for whatever comes. Because\nlife could be terrible, too, if the wonderful forces we control got out\nof hand. We've got to go on progressing--moving out to the planets, and\nthen maybe the stars. Got to go either ahead or backward. Can't stand\nstill. And it's easy to go backward nowadays. Got to fight that, Eddie,\nor else there might be a kind of death.\"\n\n\"What is death, Dad?\"\n\nEd's father would answer his son's serious expression with a gay grin.\n\"A kind of myth, now, boy. Just going to sleep and never waking up. We\nhope it's mostly finished, for everybody. Even the disease of old age\nturned out to be something like rust gathering in a pipe. Simple. It\ncan be fixed up. Some people even let themselves get old. But they can\nbe made young again. Always.\"\n\nEddie had other questions.\n\n\"You were born in the old way, Eddie,\" his mother said. \"But _so many_\npeople are needed now to populate the solar system. So everybody can't\nbe born from his mother's body. There's another way; almost the same,\nreally. Babies are born--they're made, really--in a laboratory. Then\nthey live in a youth center, like the one on the hill.\"\n\nEddie saw its great white spire looming among the trees. Often he could\nhear voices in the gardens and playgrounds on the terraced setbacks of\nits many levels. The voices seemed mysterious somehow.\n\nEven then Eddie sensed the groping and confusion that was in his\nparents' minds. Sometimes his mother would speak fervently to his\nfather: \"Jack, I'd never choose to live in another age. I love it.\nBecause it's rich, endlessly varied, exciting. Is that why I'm often\nscared out of my wits? Even disgusted often enough with my selfish self\nand all the automatic devices? I love my work, the planning of pleasant\ninteriors. I'm so busy there doesn't even seem to be time for another\nchild. Yet maybe there are centuries ahead, Jack. How does one fill\ncenturies without getting fed up? And are we supposed to be something\nsuperhuman in the end? Or do we wind up like the ancient Martians and\nthe beings of the Asteroid Planet, before it was blown to millions of\npieces? Wiped out in super-conflict, before they could progress very\nmuch further than we are now?\"\n\nMost of this went over Eddie's head. But it left a smoky tension to\nlurk in his mind behind the peaceful presence of sun and trees. People\nhad made their world more beautiful for their own relaxed enjoyment.\nYet even in those days Eddie sensed the turbulent undercurrent deep\ninside them.\n\nOnce his father expressed a vagrant thought: \"Maybe we should go out\nto Venus sometime, Eileen. Start life over more simply in an uncrowded\nplanet that's being conditioned to receive our ancient race. Maybe\nwe'll do it in just a few years.\" He grinned.\n\n\"Yes,\" Eddie's mother replied. \"If being indefinitely young and alive\ndoesn't fool us before then. If our complicated civilization doesn't\ncrack open and spit fire, and vaporize everybody. Death by violence is\nstill definitely possible. You know, lots of our friends are getting\ntheir bodies and minds recorded so that they can be restored in case\nof serious injury. Maybe we should have done it long ago.\"\n\nJack Dukas met her concern with a light tease: \"A woman's worry\nmatched against the stubbornness of a man--eh, Eileen? There's\nsomething unnatural about being recorded that I rebel against. Don't\nbe too troubled, though. The centuries won't slip from our fingers so\nimmediately. I hardly ever touch a dangerous thing in my work. Besides,\nsafety devices are almost perfect.\"\n\nSuch serious, troubled thoughts did not dim the optimism and eagerness\nof young Ed Dukas. His private dreams soared into the thrills of\nSomeday. His small hands were impatient to grasp the shadowy shapes\nof the future, more legendary than the not-distant past with its\nstill-living heroes: Roland, who was largely responsible for the\nrejuvenation process; Schaeffer, who developed the sensipsych, brought\non the dream-world period of decay, and in the end helped Harwell\ndefeat the trap of emasculating visions by urging mankind back toward a\nvigorous grip on reality; and the hundreds of others who had taken part.\n\nBut the first visit of Mitchell Prell, when Ed Dukas was five, was,\nto the boy, like acquaintance with a legend. \"Hi, Nipper!\" were the\nfirst words his uncle had spoken to Eddie. Dr. Mitchell Prell was his\nmother's brother. He was a much smaller man than Eddie's dad, and dark\ninstead of blond. He was famous. And he brought gifts.\n\n\"A piece of the Moon, Nipper,\" he said. \"An opal imbedded naturally\nin gold. For your mom. And this case of instruments dug up in Martian\nruins, for your dad. Fifty million years old but better than anything\ndesigned by human beings for locating ores far underground. And this\nfor you--also from Mars. I haven't been there for a long time. But I\ngot an old friend to send me the stuff--to the labs on the Moon.\"\n\nMaybe Eddie's gift had once been a toy for the off-spring of extinct\nMartian monsters. It was triangular like a kite, metallic, with a\nfaint lavender sheen. When you whistled a certain way, a jet of air\nmade it rise high in the sky. But it always came back. Atomic power was\nin it somewhere. For it never ran out of energy.\n\nUncle Mitch never seemed to say much. He didn't get deep into\nphilosophy. He set up queer apparatus in his room, and a kid could look\nat it if he didn't touch. And to one of Dad's questions he answered\nbriefly, \"Yes, we're making headway in the labs on the Moon. There'll\nbe a motor for star ships. If, in our experiments, hyperspace itself\ndoesn't burst at the seams under that level of power. No, we're not yet\ntrying for speeds of more than a fraction of that of light. A trip to a\nstar will take a long time.\"\n\nIt soon came out that Uncle Mitch had another interest. He kept in a\nglass tube something that squirmed and wriggled, and felt like warm\nflesh though its natural form, when at rest, was a slender cylinder of\npencil size.\n\nAbout that he would only say, \"Call it alive if you want to. But not\nlike us. Invented and artificial, and far more rugged than our flesh.\nFor the rest, wait and see if anything comes of it. Maybe it'll become\nthe clay of the superman. Schaeffer, here on Earth, is working on it,\ntoo.\"\n\nUncle Mitch stayed for a week. Then he was gone, rocketing out to the\nlabs, isolated for safety at the center of a _mare_ on the always\nhidden hemisphere of the Moon.\n\n\"Mitch knows what he wants and is direct about it,\" was Jack Dukas's\ncomment. \"Simple. No conflicts. The scientist's approach. Wise or\nstupid? Who knows?\"\n\nEddie was six, and then seven. The years moved slowly, but he grew\nand hardened with them. By the time he was twelve, sports and study\nand awareness of realities had toughened his body and matured his\nsoul considerably. That was fortunate, for this was his and mankind's\nfateful year. The day came when the household robots were fixing up the\nguestroom specially for Uncle Mitch again. Dad was afield, a hundred\nmiles away, to look over a vein of quartz crystal that was to be\nshipped to the lunar laboratories. At 9:00 P.M. Eddie's father\nhad not yet returned.\n\nEddie was sprawled on his bed looking lazily at the translucent blue\nfont of the lamp beside it. The color was rich and beautiful, the\ncarvings snaky and odd. Here was another gift, ordered by Uncle Mitch\nfrom a friend in the region of the Asteroids. The font was an artifact\nof a race contemporary with the Martians who had also lost their fight\nto master nature and themselves through knowledge. The font had been\nfound floating free in space, among the wreckage of a planet blown to\npieces ages back.\n\nEddie was thinking of such things. He was also thinking of neighborhood\npals, to whom he had bragged about his uncle and his expected arrival.\n\nAs for what happened at that moment: there _was_ transpatial warning,\nradioed out fifteen seconds ahead, telling of forces gone hopelessly\nout of control in the lunar laboratories. But Eddie's set was not\nfunctioning, and he did not hear it.\n\nBeyond the windows of his room there was just calm, pale moonlight. The\nMoon looked little different than it always looked, except for the blue\nspots of the atmosphere domes of the great mining centers.\n\nBut then came the intolerable blue-white light. Perhaps, somewhere,\nexposed instruments measured its intensity. On the roofs of\nmeteorological stations, maybe. Say conservatively that, for the space\nof a few seconds, it was five hundred times as strong as full sunshine.\n\nNight was broken off. But there was no day like this. For one fragment\nof a second Eddie glanced at the window. Shadows seemed gone, utterly.\nEven dark things like tree trunks reflected so much light that they\nall but vanished in the shimmering glare. As yet, it was a soundless\nphenomenon.\n\nEddie shut his eyes and buried his face in his pillow. This reflex\naction, partly as natural as terror and partly the result of training\nfor emergencies at school, saved his vision. He might have screamed,\nhad he been able to find his voice. Distantly, he heard human sounds\nthat increased the sickness in his stomach. A gentle scene and mood,\nproduct of science, had been utterly shattered by forces of the same\norigin.\n\nHe did not see the fuzzy blob of incandescence that bloomed in the sky\nand expanded slowly for many seconds. In fact, no one saw it; only\ncameras, fitted with special dark filters, would have been able to do\nso. For living eyes would have been charred by that splendor.\n\nHe heard his mother calling his name. Keeping his eyelids tightly\nclosed and an elbow bent over them, he fumbled his way to the hall, and\nto her. They dropped to the floor and huddled there.\n\nOutside, voices died away. By then the devilish glory in the sky was\nfading a little, too, at the edges. Only the heart of the great blob\nstill blazed supernally, with its millions of degrees of heat. Around\nit was a cooling fog of dust and gases that masked the hell within it.\n\nThe world grew still for a few moments, as it does at the center of\na typhoon. Then there was a great, soft roaring. The shock wave of\nexpanded, rarefied gases, speeding at many hundreds of miles per\nsecond, striking the upper terrestrial atmosphere, and pressing down.\nEddie could feel the pressure of it, transmitted by the air--a light\nbut definite punching inward of his flesh, from all sides.\n\nThen there was a distant sighing of wind--air, super-heated and\ncompressed, being forced outward. Next came the resurgence of human\nsounds, if they were truly that any more.\n\nSomeone was yelling, \"Oh, God ... Oh, God ... Oh, God....\" There was a\ncrackle and smell of fire. Something blew up far off.\n\nThen the earthquakes began. With a sharp snap, rock strata far\nunderground broke. Then came a jolt. Eddie Dukas and his mother,\nhuddled on the floor, were engulfed in a swaying sensation, smooth and\nvibrationless. Then the ground quivered softly. After that, there\nwas a pause, as of something hanging precariously for a moment at the\njagged lip of a chasm. Suddenly the pathetic hold seemed to be broken,\nand the whole world was seized by a tooth-cracking chatter. A pause....\nThen it began again.\n\nFor a second Eddie's mother almost lost her control. She tried to rise.\n\"The house!\" she stammered. \"It'll fall on us.\"\n\nPanic and reason fought inside Eddie. \"No, Mom,\" he gasped. \"The house\nhas a steel frame. It'll probably hold together. Outside, we don't know\nwhat would happen to us.\"\n\nThey both braced themselves for the next seismic burst. They were\nboth creatures of luxury, science-made. But planning, training,\npsychology--science it all was, too--had given them ruggedness and\ncourage, a reserve of strength against hysteria--while the earth\nrattled again and again.\n\nEddie's mom kept saying things, and it was all something like a formula\nthat had been learned, a rote, a parroted incantation: \"You're right,\nEddie. We've got to think before we do anything. They always tell us\nthat life is an adventure. We've got to meet a bigger future or be\ndestroyed, Eddie. Everything takes nerve.\"\n\nAt last the earthquake shocks lessened both in intensity and frequency.\nMaybe the worst was over.\n\nEddie risked an eye, and then nudged his mother.\n\nBeyond the undamaged flexoglass of the windows night had returned,\nred-lit from both sky and ground. The firmament was smeared with\na ruddy glow extending in a great curve, beaded with more intense\nblobs at several points. Dust of the Moon, it had to be. Of its rock\nand pumice shell. And of its core of meteoric iron. But that sullen\neffulgence was fading now, as matter cooled and began simply to reflect\nsolar light back to this dark side of Earth.\n\nYet everywhere outside there was fire. The towering glow in the\neast--that would be the City, fifty miles away. Destruction and\nconfusion there would be unimaginable. Nearer at hand, trees were\naflame--leaves and branches that minutes ago had been cool with\ngreenness now blazed wildly. Mixed with the tumult of voices was the\nclang of robot fire units.\n\nEddie rushed to the radio and turned it on, as he had been taught to\ndo in emergencies. You listened; you obeyed directions. \"... lunar\nblowup,\" someone was saying. \"Follow the usual precautions and measures\nfor radioactive contamination and flesh burns. Rescue and relief units\nare already in action. Fortunately most of our buildings are not made\nof combustible materials....\"\n\nFor minutes Eddie was furiously busy, rubbing special salves and\nlotions into the skin of his entire body. Then, dressed in fresh\nclothes, he and his mother just stared out of the windows for a while.\nOutside, metal shapes were at work. Science and civilization were\nworking efficiently to recapture their balance after an upset that\nmight have been the end.\n\nEddie and his mother explored the house and found it mostly intact.\nThen incident piled on incident in quick succession. The first of these\nbegan with a whimper at the door. Masked with respirators against\npossible radioactive taints in the outside air, they opened it. A\nblackened thing without eyes dragged itself inside, quivered once, and\nlay still. It was death among supposed immortals. The passing of a\ndachshund called Schnitz.\n\nEddie was dazed. Child-grief or man-grief had no chance to come to him\nthen. Events moved too fast. There was too much to be done.\n\nA half-dozen people in radiation armor came into the house. At once\nit was converted into a first-aid station. Hard law and hard drills,\nblueprinted long before for disaster, came into play. Eddie's mother\njoined the crew. Nor was he left out of it. There was coffee for him to\nprepare in the kitchen, and rugs and furniture to be cleared away, and\nequipment to be set up.\n\nHe saw blood and death, and hysteria-twisted faces. He saw glinting,\ncomplex instruments and apparatus, as the therapeutic methods of the\nage were applied. There were blood pumps that could serve as hearts\nand machines to duplicate the functions of kidneys and lungs. There\nwere devices to teleport scattered body cells from a dozen healthy\nindividuals, converting them briefly into mobile energy, and then back\ninto living tissue in the body of an injured person.\n\nMostly the maimed and burned remained stolid and calm. Luxury had\nnot weakened them. They, too, had known their era and had had some\npreparation.\n\nEddie recognized a child of his own age among those who came into\nhis own house: a neighbor boy named Les Payten, the son of a noted\nbiologist. He had big ears and a freckled nose. He wasn't hurt badly.\nHis eyes were inflamed. He hadn't shut them quite quickly enough. He\nhad turned sullen, and his lip trembled a bit. Otherwise he was still\nfull of pepper.\n\n\"Braggin' about your Uncle Mitch _now_, Eddie?\" he taunted. \"Great\nstuff, that guy! He and his pal scientists nearly got us all. Better\nluck next time, huh?\"\n\nYoung Ed Dukas might have growled back but he did not. As if he too\ncarried a burden of responsibility, his jaw hardened and his cheeks\nhollowed. His back stiffened, as if to bear the load. He returned to\nthe kitchen. He had not yet noticed any other signs of blame. It was\ntoo soon. The shock of cosmic catastrophe had deadened minds. Sometimes\nprejudice and hatred need a certain leisurely brooding to build them up.\n\nBut another raw realization had come to Eddie. As soon as there was a\nmoment to speak to his mother he said, \"Uncle Mitch was supposed to\nland in the City spaceport tonight. It's a six-hour run from the Moon.\nBut now he'll never get here.\"\n\nShe shook her head. And in her expression there was fury mixed with her\nsadness.\n\nHe didn't think about that very long as he helped carry a stretcher.\nHis mind was on Mitchell Prell--grinning, setting up a lab in the room\nupstairs, even modeling wax with his swift fingers. He had once molded\nlittle heads of Mom and Dad. A lump gathered in Eddie's throat for\nsomeone who would never be back. Mitchell Prell. Even the name sounded\nnice.\n\nThen slowly another question came into his mind. _Where was Dad?_ He'd\ngone out to that quartz lode and hadn't come back! Funny, thought\nEddie, I hadn't even thought about that. Well, it came from taking Dad\nfor granted. Someone never to worry about. Someone always around, like\nthe hills. Eddie clenched his fists to steady himself. No use worrying\nyet.\n\nNow the torrential rains began. Steam had been boiled out of the ground\nby heat. Now it was condensing. Helping, maybe, as the radio said, to\nwash away the poison of the radioactive meteorites and dust that were\nfalling to Earth--wreckage that hours before had been part of the Moon.\n\nSomewhere out in the moaning storm a bell chimed out ten o'clock very\ncalmly. It must have been about then that what was left of Jack Dukas\nwas brought home in a truck. Eddie didn't see this happen. He was\nhelping again with the injured. And later, when Les Payten told him,\nMom wouldn't let him go into the locked room where his dad had been\ntaken. He almost told her that he had a right. But he did not want to\ndisturb her further.\n\nEddie was up till 4:00 A.M. By then the rescue crew had left\nthe house and a tentative calm had been restored in the world. The\ninjured were in hospitals, rigged in tents and public buildings. But\nthere were far more dead. Anyone caught more than a step from shelter\nwhen the catastrophe had occurred was apt to belong to that endless\nlist. Half a planet had been scorched by heat and radiation.\n\nWhile the guard-robots rumbled through the rain on their caterpillar\ntreads, Eddie simply passed out from weariness on the floor of the\nliving room. His mother managed to arouse him a little but not enough\nto send him to bed. Rather, she folded down the twin couches from the\nsensipsych set. She made her husky young son climb up onto one of them\nand took the other for herself.\n\nHe slept, and his body was refreshed. And he had dreams--not dreams\nin which he was an imaginary cartoon character; nor was he toiling to\nmake dead asteroids habitable; nor was he enjoying an adventure on\nsome imaginary planet among the stars. No, for the present he had had\nenough of strain. Instead he lay in grass by a little lake. The sun\nwas bright. There were boats with colored sails, and blue flamingos\nflying, and odd, elfin music. The sensipsych was not an opiate to fill\nthe emptiness of soft lives now. It was rest; it was honest, relieving\ntherapy.\n\nYoung Ed Dukas didn't see the mud-spattered truck arrive, to be parked\nsome distance from the house. He did not see the figure moving in the\ndense shadows. It knocked cautiously at the front door, waited for a\nreasonable time, and then went around to the porch in the rear. There\nskillful fingers worked carefully to release the lock. Massive luggage\nwas lifted without sound inside the door.\n\nEddie awoke with a small, hard hand shaking his shoulder. His mother\nwas already awake. The light was on. At first only with simple\nunbelief, they beheld a slight, disheveled figure.\n\nUncle Mitch's cheek was scraped. His hands were filthy. His recently\nneat business suit was torn. An old jauntiness about his eyes fought\nwith worry, regret and wariness.\n\n\"Hello, Eileen,\" he said. \"Hi, Nipper.\"\n\nHe received no answer. Somehow even Eddie felt compelled to silence. So\nhis uncle shifted to what was a rarity with him--a kind of historical\nor philosophical summary.\n\n\"Progress,\" he said with a forced laugh. \"The world government\nanswering the threat of atomic war, years ago. Then the greatest\nboon of the human race: eternal youth, and death's defeat except by\nviolence, producing the problem of overpopulation, to be relieved by\nthe colonization of the solar system. Then peace and boredom and the\nsensipsych dreams leading to decadence, loss of pride in self and even\nrebellious violence; then the solution of vigorous, realistic action,\nmore and more people to enjoy life, more and more colonies. Then, as we\nreach out for the stars, this. Life. The great adventure that can't be\nstopped. The rise from barbarism. Is it even well begun?\"\n\nHis words, half appropriate and half in supremely bad taste now, as\nMitchell Prell well knew--though he had to say them because of the need\nto say something--still fell into a void of silence and echoed through\nthe house like a cheap speech.\n\nSighing raggedly, he tried again: \"Yes, I'm alive, Eileen. The ship\nfrom the Moon was in space before the blowup happened. We rode ahead of\nthe main shock wave at high speed. So we won through. From the final\nwarning message from the Moon, I gather that trouble started in the\nwarp chambers. The heat and pressure were restrained by the tight space\nwarp for a while, until inter-dimensional barriers ripped wide open.\nThe whole mass of the Moon was in the way. By old standards it couldn't\nhappen; but a lot of lunar atoms went all to pieces in a flare of high\nenergy. The tough part is that we achieved a workable motor principle\nfor stellar ships weeks ago. The blowup came from side line testing.\"\n\nOnce more no words answered Mitchell Prell when he stopped talking. He\nwaited, but his sister's eyes remained cold.\n\n\"All right, Eileen,\" he went on at last. \"You're thinking that I am one\nof the specialists who is responsible for this. Surely I'm the only\nsurvivor among those research men who were on the Moon. But remember\nthis: we weren't working on our own. We were hired, under a democratic\nsystem, and told what to hunt for. It was the best that could be\ndone, except that the lab should have been put farther away, on some\nlonely asteroid. Logically, then, we are not solely to blame for what\nhas happened. But it doesn't work that way, Eileen. Under grief and\nhysteria logic still collapses, even in our time. In a real crisis\nthere continue to be many people who need scapegoats. A collective\nmishap, the result of a mass desire for more knowledge, then becomes a\npersonal guilt. So I'm a fugitive, Eileen.\"\n\nIt was a strange, bitter thing for Eddie Dukas to watch--his mother and\nuncle facing each other, not friends, his mother's face a hard mask of\ncoldness.\n\nThen, all at once, her icy poise crumbled. \"Jack isn't alive any more,\"\nshe said. \"My husband. That's the fact that I know best. You with your\nglib talk, my brother, are one person directly in the chain of events\nthat caused Jack's death. I don't accuse you, Mitch. I just say that I\ncan't look on you now with any pleasure. That's all.\"\n\nThen, sitting there on the sensipsych couch, she began to cry. It was\npainful for Eddie to watch. He had never seen her do that before.\n\nBut Mitchell Prell chuckled. He sat beside his sister and put his arm\naround her. \"Are things so bad?\" he chided. \"Look, Eileen. People used\nto consider biological life the deepest secret of nature. Because\nhe was at the top of his local life scale, man would not have been\nflattered to know that the vital force in him wasn't the greatest,\nthe most indecipherable of enigmas. But it's true, Eileen. Year after\nyear we've learned more about cell function, genes, chromosomes, the\nnatural molding of living things, and the final process in protoplasm,\nwhich is the spark itself. Men like Schaeffer have been making simple\nlife for years, while they traced out more complex riddles. For a long\ntime they've been replacing diseased or damaged organs from scattered\ncells drawn from the bodies of many donors. Now they've gone further\nand have grown such organs in a culture fluid, from a microscopic bit\nof tissue. It is already theoretically possible to re-create an entire\nman, provided there is a pattern. It was for repair purposes, after\npossible accidents, that everyone was urged to have his body structure\nrecorded--especially that of his brain. All you have to do, Eileen,\nis have Jack's record turned over to the same laboratories that do\nrejuvenation. In two or three years he'll come back to you just as he\nwas. Soon there might even be a simpler, better way.\"\n\nEileen Dukas's laugh was brittle and bitter. \"A roll of fine,\nsensitized wire,\" she said. \"Kept in a box no bigger than the first\njoint of a finger. Supposed to be safe in a vault. The pattern of a\nhuman being. Well, Mitch, there just isn't any such box for Jack. Or\nfor Eddie or me either, for that matter. We just didn't get around to\nit. Jack was somehow half against it.\"\n\nAgain there was a silence. For Eddie it seemed to have the quiet of\nforever in it. No whistling of Dad's tunes. No sly winks, or play at\nbeing tough. Just memory.\n\n\"All bodies that are being picked up are being sent through the\nrecorder,\" Uncle Mitch offered at last. \"Refined radar does the trick.\nThe finest variations of even brain structure--the mold of mind,\npersonality, and memory--are found and recorded. Wasn't that done for\nJack?\"\n\nEddie's mother nodded. \"Only,\" she stammered, \"the whole top of his head\nwas charred. There wasn't enough of him left. Oh, you and your damned\nscience, Mitch.\"\n\nShe was weeping again. Mitchell Prell became either cruel or perhaps he\nspoke in self-defense.\n\n\"The people that used to neglect things like insurance,\" he remarked,\n\"are still plentiful, aren't they? Oh, well, maybe there's still a sort\nof way. A makeshift. People are bound to think of it. Let it go for\nnow. I've got lots to worry about, sister of mine.\"\n\n\"Your own skin, for instance?\" she challenged him. \"Why did you come\nhere at all, Mitch? The scapegoat-seekers will certainly look for you\nhere first.\"\n\n\"My own skin,\" Mitchell Prell agreed. \"Maybe yours, since you are a\nrelative of mine, responsible for my sins. That is an ancient defect of\nlogic among certain types of people still in existence, I'm afraid--if\nthe provocation becomes great enough. The skins of the three of us, my\nmost prized treasures.\"\n\nHe smiled slightly then, and his blue eyes were gentle. \"Don't worry\ntoo much, though,\" he went on. \"I'll be gone sooner than most people\nwill even think of looking for me. I'll keep out of sight, not even\nleaving the house, except after dark. I have some things to deliver to\nSchaeffer. Then I've got to get away. Because life goes on, in spite of\neverything. I'm still curious about nature, the stars and some other\nthings. I remain eager for some vast freedom, Eileen--for you and\nyour son, and the rest of the cussed race, whose errant qualities and\nusually good intentions I share. I see no good in becoming the offering\nof expiation for an accident that came out of a general human urge to\nlearn that can't and won't be downed.\"\n\nSomething like a truce came then. Eddie Dukas could feel it. Family\nloyalty was in it and a little of understanding and contrition.\n\n\"All right, Mitch,\" was all that Eddie's mother said. She kissed his\nuncle's cheek. Eddie knew that it was a woman's gesture of armistice.\n\nFires had died down. Dawn was beginning to show in the patio. The rain\nhad stopped long ago. For no reason Eddie's eyes sought out a pool of\nmuddy water in a crack in the flagging. The water was clay colored, as\nit might have been after any shower. A robin, which had somehow escaped\ndeath, was scolding angrily.\n\nBreakfast was eaten listlessly. There were radio reports and orders.\n\"Able persons must report to their municipal centers....\"\n\n\"That's for you, Eddie,\" Mitchell Prell said ruefully. \"And your\nmother. While I play hiding rat.\"\n\nEddie didn't know whether to hate his uncle or not. There was an inner\nbigness about that slightly built man that matched some obscure drive\nthat was Eddie's own--in spite of his grief.\n\n\"Watch yourself, sir,\" he growled stiffly.\n\nThe day was a day of searching for corpses, of cleanup, of tentative\nrestoration. At least there would be no smells of death. Pruning\nmachines were already busy on charred treetops. The world was being\nput back into order, like a disturbed anthill. Grass and leaves would\nsprout again. The scared faces of younger children--many from the Youth\nCenter were given small tasks to help in the cleanup, since it was not\nthe custom now to hide reality from the young--would smile again. On\nthat day of sweeping the streets with a broom, Eddie Dukas made and\nlost many a brief friendship. Hello.... Goodbye....\n\nFortunately the poison of radioactivity had not been transmitted to any\ngreat extent from across space by radiation alone. Gases and fragments\nof the Moon that were still falling as meteors bore a taint to the\natmosphere; but it was now below the danger level.\n\nOverhead, arching the sky like the Rings of Saturn turned ragged, was\nwhat was left of Luna: rock and dust. For an hour its texture veiled\nthe sun, until, near noon, there was almost twilight, like that of an\neclipse. That arch was a permanent monument to a night that would be\nremembered.\n\nThere still were hysterical people around. Eddie saw Mrs. Payten, his\nfriend's mother. She passed in the street, muttering, \"Oh, Ronald, you\nwere a beast of a man, but I loved you. Why were you a fool, too?... No\nrecord.... None....\"\n\nIt had been a subject of neighborhood gossip that Ronald Payten, a\nlarge, passive lug, had been a very much hen-pecked husband. His\nneglect of having a record made of himself might have seemed strange\nfor so noted a biologist. Maybe it was absent-mindedness, professional\ndifference of opinion, or even some backhanded defiance of his wife.\n\nThere were moments when the wild taint in young blood and the\nmagnificence of disaster gave Eddie and others almost an outing mood.\nBut toil, sweat and horror soon turned things grim as he worked with\nthe men. His hands were blackened and scratched. But maybe tiredness\nwas balm for delayed shock. Maybe it was thus that he stood at the\nbrief funeral services--for his father, too--with less hurt. The great\ntrench was closed over the corpses, and the thing was done.\n\nLater, back in the house, he struggled with himself somewhat, and said,\n\"I know it wasn't your fault, Uncle Mitch.\"\n\nEddie had seen stern faces that day, topping trim gray uniforms:\nregional police. In him was the thought: Harboring a fugitive. One who\nshouldn't be called that. But who is--now. Because people have taken a\nbeating like never before. Even laws can be changed. Ideas of justice\nwon't stay quite the same.\n\n\"Have you outgrown my calling you Nipper?\" Mitchell Prell asked him\nseriously. \"Perhaps.... But I still want to show you something.\"\n\nYoung Ed Dukas was no sucker for easy come-ons. But his polite wariness\nsoon dissolved, when, in the room where Mitchell Prell was holed up, he\nsaw that the man who turned to face him was not his uncle. The nose and\nlips were much heavier. Only the eyes and grin remained much the same,\nthough their general effect was made different by the difference of\nsurrounding features. This man looked like a good-natured mechanic.\n\nEddie's spine chilled. But he gave a sullen snort as the man peeled his\nface away. Underneath it was Uncle Mitch.\n\n\"A mask, Eddie. A trick for kids, you'd say.\" His uncle laughed.\n\"I spent the day making it up, to help me get around more easily.\nThat's nothing. The important fact is that it is made of vitaplasm.\nRemember the bar of it that I once had? Crude stuff then. Better now.\nAlive in a way of its own. A synthetic and far tougher cousin to\nnatural protoplasm. Far less susceptible to damage by heat and cold.\nSelf-healing, like flesh. Sustained by food and oxygen. But capable of\ndrawing its energy from sunlight or radioactivity, too. And in some\nof its forms less dependent on a fluid base such as water. No, it's\nnot consistently the same substance, or combination. Like the flesh\nwe know, vitaplasm is in constant change. Here and now it's just an\namorphous mass, crudely molded. An unshaped building material. But,\nlike star ships, it belongs to the future. Here it's undeveloped\nprinciple, another phase of our advancing science everywhere. You could\ncall it the clay of the superman, Eddie. I want you to remember all\nthis. Because I may be back from where I'm going to try to go. Or I\nmight get in touch sometime. We might need each other's help.\"\n\nYoung Ed Dukas listened with intense interest. Perhaps his deepest\ndrive was toward the shadowy splendor of times yet to come. They\nseemed a part of his growing self. They must become real! And he must\ntake part in their fulfillment. Grief or hardship could not stop him.\nTherein he and Mitchell Prell traveled the same road.\n\n\"You didn't invent vitaplasm, Uncle Mitch,\" he stated. \"No one could\nhave--alone.\"\n\nHis sullenly serious gaze lingered on the mask. It was warm to his\ntouch. It even recoiled a little.\n\nMitchell Prell shook his head and chortled. \"No, Nipper. You know that\nresearch is now far too complex for that. I helped a little. Lots of\nmen did. Maybe I've added something to what is known. I've got to give\nmy data to specialists here before I leave.\"\n\nEddie thought of a man he'd sometimes seen on television. No bigger\nthan Uncle Mitch. And plain looking. But great. Dr. Schaeffer in his\nunderground laboratory in the City.\n\n\"You aren't going to try to reach a star, are you?\" young Ed asked.\n\nUncle Mitch shook his head. \"No. I won't wander so far off.\" He\nlaughed. \"But in a way I'll be going farther, I suppose. Though don't\nimagine that I mean time or hyper-dimensional travel. It's something\nsimpler. But it's to a place where no one can journey exactly as a\nhuman being. I can't tell you much more. Because I don't want other\npeople to try to dig too much out of you. But I want to look at things\nfrom a new angle. And from very close up, you might say. Maybe I'm\ntrying to hide from danger, Eddie. Some. But the bigger reason is that\nI want to go on learning and exploring. Maybe my being a small man\nmeans something, too.\"\n\nMitchell Prell ended with another light laugh. He put the mask in his\npocket and snapped a large suitcase shut. When he spoke again it was\non a slightly different tack: \"You probably won't see me for a while,\nEddie. About your father, words just aren't any good at all. Maybe I'll\nache over his end even harder than you. If anybody asks you questions\nabout me, tell all you know. Don't try to hide anything for my sake.\nThey'll pry it out of you anyway. And they'll only know what I want\nthem to know.\n\n\"Your mother may get a letter in a few days asking you both to\nreport to the City. If that letter comes, see that she conforms to\nits request. It will also mean that I've delivered the results of my\nexperiments with vitaplasm, as far as they've gone, into the proper\nhands and have probably succeeded in getting away into space. I hope\nthat you and I and everybody make it to the Big Future, Eddie. That's\nall I have to say. Unless you care to remember a word that may crop up\nagain--_android_.\"\n\nMitchell Prell grinned reassuringly at his nephew and moved to put on\nhis mask.\n\n\"You don't want to say goodbye to Mom,\" Eddie stated, half angrily.\n\nPrell's look of concern deepened. His thin face was touched by a\nfleeting tenderness and worry. Part of it was surely for his sister.\nThen, mostly to himself, he muttered, \"There's greater magnificence to\ncome--if we can grow past the infancy of man; if new knowledge and old\nwild impulses don't do us all to death first.\" He chuckled sheepishly.\n\"You say goodbye for me, Eddie,\" he urged. \"I hate things like that.\"\n\nMitchell Prell was gone then, out into the weird new night. Grimly,\nalready half a man, young Ed Dukas watched him go, bitterness and\ngrief, hatred and love, mixed up inside him. But the common denominator\nbetween himself and his uncle was the need for that future of stars and\nwonder and legendary betterment.\n\n\"It _will_ happen,\" he promised within himself. For a second his body\nwas taut with dread. He had already experienced the fury that knowledge\nmade possible, and he could sense the potential of long silence beyond\nsuch things--no one left, anywhere! He wondered if, because life could\ngo on and on now, it was more precious and death more terrible.\n\nFifteen minutes after his uncle's departure a spy beam was put into\noperation from a mile distance. It covered the rooms of the Dukas house\nand the grounds around it. The principle of the device was almost\nancient. The reflection of electro-magnetic waves. On a small screen\nin a distant room the plan of a house and its furnishings was outlined\nin a pale green glow. Shadowy blobs shifted with the movements of its\noccupants, robot and human. Only two people were there now.\n\nEddie Dukas guessed that the spy beam was there, though its irregularly\nchanging wave length would have made it almost impossible to identify,\namong the waves from many sources used for communication.\n\nEarly on the third morning after the lunar blowup the police came to\nthe house. They were very gentle. There was even a policewoman to ask\nthe questions.\n\nEddie's mother was cool and wary.\n\n\"Have you information as to the whereabouts of Dr. Mitchell Prell, Mrs.\nDukas?\" she was asked. \"We know that the last Moon rocket landed with\nhim aboard.\"\n\nBefore she could lie Eddie blurted, \"He was here all that day. He's\ngone now. He didn't make his destination very clear.\"\n\nEileen Dukas's eyes widened with panic and surprise. She had expected\nEddie to be more discreet.\n\n\"You have no right to question my son!\" she stated coldly.\n\n\"Mrs. Dukas,\" she was informed, \"when there is an investigation of the\ndeaths of two hundred million people, we have more than the right to\nquestion anybody.\"\n\nYoung Ed was scared. But he felt some of the hero-impulse. Or the\ndesire to follow faithfully the instructions of his idol, Uncle Mitch.\n\n\"If you psych my memory, what little I know will come clearer than if I\njust told it,\" he challenged.\n\nThis was done forthwith, out in the police car parked in the street.\nWhen the helmet of the apparatus was removed from Eddie's head, the\npolice had certain comments of Mitchell Prell's to study. Possibly they\ncould puzzle out some of their hidden meaning. But this couldn't have\nsatisfied them very much.\n\nThe next day the letter Prell had mentioned arrived. At least it\ncould be assumed that it was the one. Uncle Mitch had managed to make\none step of his purpose anyway! Under the heading of \"Vital Section,\nSchaeffer Laboratories,\" it said:\n\n     MRS. DUKAS:\n\n     _Will you kindly report at your earliest convenience to the\n     above section. This is of greatest importance. Please bring\n     your son._\n\n     _Sincerely_,\n\n     DR. M. BART\n\nEd was both cold with tension and hot with eagerness. The following\nday he and his mother were in the battered City. Fire had scarred it.\nA boiling tidal wave had washed over portions of it. But the great\nbuilding over the many subterranean levels of the Schaeffer Labs had\nstood firm. Quakes had not broken it down.\n\nAn elevator took them below, to that steel- and lead- and\nconcrete-shielded place which might have resisted for a while even a\nnoval outburst of the sun. They were requested to lie down on something\nlike sensipsych couches. A voice--maybe Dr. Bart's--spoke to them\nfrom a swift-gathering dream: \"Think about Jack Dukas. Your husband.\nYour father. Things he said. His manner of speech. His expressions,\ngestures, temperament, likes and dislikes, hobbies, jokes, skills.\nThe people that he knew. Their faces and mannerisms. As many of them\nas possible will be contacted and psyched like this, too. Think of\nhis memories told to you. Think of everything ... everything ...\neverything....\"\n\nFor Eileen Dukas it must have been much the same as for her son.\nPearly haze seemed to float inside Eddie's mind. Like a million bits\nof ancient news clippings always in motion, his recollections of his\nfather seemed to burst in a thousand ever-shifting fragments within his\nbrain. He felt an awful compulsion to recall. It sapped his strength\nuntil all consciousness faded away. Yet before this happened he knew\nthat the probing would go on and on.\n\nThe next thing he knew he was sitting groggily in a pneumatic tube\ntrain, with his mother, all but exhausted, too, leaning against\nhim. Almost as an afterthought, their own minds and bodies had been\n\"recorded\" there at the laboratory. They seldom exchanged questions or\nspeculations afterward about what had happened to them. It had been a\ndream. Let it be a dream.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nLife had become hard enough for Eileen Dukas and her son. While most\npeople treated them all right--from some they even received exaggerated\nkindness--there was, very often, a certain disturbing expression in\neyes that looked at them.\n\nLes Payten, Eddie's friend said once, \"I promise, Ed. No more talk\nabout your uncle from me. Finished, see? You've had enough.\"\n\nEddie suppressed the anger which sprang from loyalty to Mitchell Prell,\nfor he understood Les Payten's good intentions.\n\nAt regular intervals there were police visits at the house, and\nquestioning. \"It's partly for your protection, Mrs. Dukas,\" was one\nhonest comment from the detectives. But Eddie sensed that there was\nmore to it than that. Subtly, the interpretation of law had changed\nsince the lunar blowup. It went backward, as grief sought people to\nblame. Catastrophe had been too big for reason or fairness. And the\nscapegoat himself was not around to be mobbed.\n\nA freckle-faced brat from the Youth Center--her name, Barbara\nDay, had been drawn out of a hat, for of course she had no known\nparents--offered advice: \"You ought to go far away, Eddie, where folks\ndon't know you. It would be better.\"\n\nEd knew that this was good advice. Many people were saying and shouting\nand whispering that too much knowledge was a dangerous possession. And\nEd's uncle still represented such a thing. More than once Ed had to run\nfast, with some big lug chasing him. Black eyes he collected with great\nfrequency, and delivered some, too. Still, he ached inside. It was as\nif Uncle Mitch were part of him.\n\nThe world began to look normal and green again. But the undercurrents\nof memory were still there. And Ed Dukas began to answer hate with\nhate, though he didn't like to.\n\nThere was a crowd of young toughs with rocks to throw, in front of the\nhouse one night. \"This is the place,\" Eddie heard one of them say.\n\"Both my parents are gone. And the bums that live here were in on the\nreason.\"\n\nEd had seen the boy around before: Ash Parker. Now the rocks flew for a\nwhile, and Ed and his mother crouched behind locked doors. There might\nhave been a lynching, except that Les Payten found a neighbor with a\ntear-gas vial and some other neighbors with sharp tongues and courage.\n\nIt was the final straw, however. \"Will we have to leave, Eddie?\" his\nmother asked.\n\n\"It's best,\" he growled. \"But I'll be back!\"\n\nNext day the house was being boarded up. Packing began even before the\ncolonial travel permits were prepared.\n\nIt was goodbye to Les Payten and Barbara Day, and the newly ringed\nplanet, Earth, with its billions of inhabitants and its great shops\nthat still worked to give the whole solar system to mankind and maybe\na segment of the larger universe as well. The pattern of the future\nseemed set, and specialists still didn't think that there was any\nreal reason to make a change. In fact, they denied that any change\nwas possible. Nobody would give up the threshold of immortality, once\nit was gained. Nor would they relinquish other triumphs that could\nbring idleness and decay if they were not used to accomplish bigger\nand bigger tasks. So, even the fearful ones were caught in the rushing\ncurrent of the times.\n\nEd Dukas was soon on a crowded liner. Because she might need him, he\nkept close to his mother. Around them were other colonists--young\ngraduates from technical schools, newlyweds and people who were\nphysically young, too, though they were fresh from the rejuvenation\nvats. They were the aged, awed by another lifetime before them.\n\nThe liner blasted off. A week later it landed on an asteroid of\nmiddling size. The Dukases were assigned to one of a group of trim\ncottages that were not even all alike. Under the great glass roof,\nwhich kept in the synthetic air, the new gardens and fruit trees were\nalready growing. And in coiled tubes of clear plastic filled with\nwater, circulated green algae from which almost any kind of basic food\ncould be made.\n\nTo Eddie it was a satisfying dip into space that he had so much\nanticipated. Amid great heaps of steel and plastic and house parts and\natomic machines to maintain a normal temperature so far from the sun,\nlife went on. Eddie's mother worked in the office of a shop for robot\nmachines. He worked too--when and where he could--when he was not at\nschool.\n\nThere was a little more of peace, for a while anyway. There was the\nusual psychological treatment to subdue possible devils of the lunar\ncatastrophe which might remain in his mind. There were sports and an\nartificial lake to swim in with his companions. However, Ed Dukas was\nwary of making deep friendships.\n\nHe was then a sullen, overly matured youth of thirteen, earnest about\neverything he did--for he knew that the years ahead were grimly\nearnest. Carefully he kept up with the reports in scientific journals:\nabout the laying of the keel of the first star ship on a minute\nasteroid with only a number and no name. Harwell was in charge. The\npropellant would be pure radiant energy--the best of them all; energy\nso concentrated that it would be truly massive and hurled at the speed\nof light, which was not remarkable, since it _would_ be light, far more\nintense per unit area than the noval explosion of a star!\n\nThis was by no means the only major advance that had been accomplished\nand was reported. Technological progress was steady in all fields,\nacross the board, making a solid front. Others of its facets also\nhad a special appeal to Ed Dukas. Biological science, in its newest\ninterpretations, he knew to be the most important of these. Now it was\nno longer just simple rejuvenation--restoring rusty organs. It was a\nthing that could start from a single cell, in warm, sticky fluids,\ngiving rebirth to something that had already been. And it had a further\ndevelopment--bringing the same results but more swiftly and easily,\nand with different, far more rugged flesh. It was frightening and\nfascinating. Knowing was like feeling the shadow of a demon or an angel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd Dukas and his mother spent four years on their asteroid. Then one\nday a letter fluttered in her hand. And she seemed not to know whether\nto look happy or terrified. She did not show her son the letter.\n\n\"We've had enough of being here,\" she stated. \"We're going home.\"\n\nSo they went back across the millions of miles. They cleaned up the\nhouse, on which obscene insults had been scribbled in chalk. On two\nsuccessive days Eddie was jumped by gangs. He fought free and escaped.\nBut on the third evening he was cornered. This time Ash Parker was the\nringleader. Ed battled like a bobcat, but eight opponents were too\nmany. He was flat on his back, and they were kicking him. His own blood\nwas in his mouth. What might happen when he blacked out was anybody's\nguess. Once, before medical knowledge had advanced to where it was, it\nwould have been murder for sure.\n\nSomebody intervened--a big guy in a gray business suit who had come\nstriding along the block with an eager attention.\n\nHe didn't say anything at first. He just collared the toughs, two at a\ntime in swift succession, and thrust them away.\n\nEddie staggered up and faced his benefactor, intent on giving him\nsincere thanks. \"Mister ... I ...\"\n\n\"Hello, Eddie!\" the man said, chuckling. \"I see you turned out hardy.\nSeventeen you'd be now.\"\n\nYoung Ed Dukas heard the voice and looked at the face. He stiffened.\nThen he made a statement in a flat tone that sounded very formal and\nunemotional, which it was not: \"Sir, you're my father.\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"Just off the assembly line, pal. The same guy--because\nyou and your mother, and some other people, remembered what I was like.\nThere was no record of me or of my mind. So, okay, they made one,\nfella. From the memories of me left in other minds. Thanks, Eddie.\"\n\n\"Thanks?\" Ed Dukas said in a choked voice.\n\nBloody and dirty, he stepped forward. Father and son clung to each\nother. It was a moment of great triumph.\n\nEd's mind pictured filaments, as fragile at first as pink spiderweb\nbut already outlining a human shape, held suspended in a kind of\njelly--growing there, forming according to a record. Now even the\nrecord could be synthesized. It seemed like real freedom from death at\nlast.\n\nAsh Parker had not fled. Now he spoke, sounding awed, \"Jeez, Mr. Dukas.\nI didn't believe it. Maybe my folks can come back, too.\"\n\n\"Your parents _will_ come back,\" Jack Dukas affirmed. \"I am the first\n'memory man' to be resurrected. Among those killed who had had their\nbodies and minds recorded as was recommended, about a hundred thousand\nare alive again, as I think you know. Millions more are in process. One\nway or another, by record or by the memories of others, in flesh of the\nold kind or the new, almost everyone will return.\"\n\nEd felt his father's hand. As far as he could tell, it _was_ of flesh.\nYet it could be something else; Ed nearly trembled with excitement as\nhis eager wonder and primitive dread of the strange battled inside him.\nHe thought again of Mitchell Prell's first samples of vitaplasm.\n\n\"Of which flesh are you, Dad?\" Ed asked anxiously.\n\nHis father studied him there in the twilight of the day, while the\nsilvery ring of lunar wreckage brightened in the sky.\n\n\"The old kind, Eddie,\" he answered.\n\n\"I'm glad,\" Ed said, feeling greatly relieved, a reaction which he knew\nwas odd for one who loved the thought of coming miracles.\n\nJack Dukas sighed as if he had escaped a terrible fate. \"So am I glad,\npal,\" he said. \"I guess I was favored by family connections.\" Here he\npaused, but his wink meant Uncle Mitch. \"However,\" he continued, \"the\nold flesh takes so much longer. That's why in many cases it won't be\nused. There must be thousands of androids already among us, living like\neverybody else. Since personal concerns are involved, statistics are\nkept rather confidential. These synthetic people have organs the same\nas we have. And you can't recognize them just by looking. Only they're\nthirty per cent heavier, stronger, and they don't tire. There was a\nthought, once, that robots would make human beings obsolete and replace\nthem. Sorry, Eddie. Why be gruesome at a time like this? Let's patch\nyou up and then find your mother.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYoung Ed Dukas was happier than he had ever been before. For quite a\nwhile he found peace. Maybe that was true of most of humanity now--for\nthe past three or four years at least. There was no sharp delineation\nof an interval before the smokes of doubt began to come back.\n\nLes Payten was still around. And Barbara Day continued to live at the\nYouth Center on the hill. Often the three would meet. Their childhood\nwas behind them. Barbara Day's freckles had faded. Her dark hair had a\ncoppery glint. A promise of beauty had begun to blossom. And her talk\nexpressed many whimsical thoughts.\n\n\"We all know each other, Eddie,\" she once said. \"So don't be offended.\nI sometimes think that you wonder whether your father is really the\nsame person that he was--whether he ever could be more than a careful\nduplicate.\"\n\nLes Payten frowned. \"You're speaking to me, too, Babs,\" he pointed out.\n\"I also have a 'memory father.' He's good to me, and mostly I like him.\nBut sometimes I get scared, though I don't always know why.\"\n\nEd's skin tingled. \"Could I be myself now and still be myself\nin another body, years later? Could there ever be two of\nme--truly--constructed exactly the same? I don't deny such a thing. I\nsimply don't know.\"\n\nBut Ed Dukas continued to wonder about his father. There were several\noccasions when his dad was supposed to recognize certain people,\ncasually encountered in the street. For they knew him.\n\nEd was present on one of these occasions. \"Sorry, friend,\" Jack Dukas\napologized to a burly, jovial man. \"I guess they forgot to put a\npicture of you inside my head.\"\n\nLes Payten's father was also subtly different from his original--though\nin a somewhat different way. The change was even very dimly apparent\nin his face. He had once been a big, easy-going, timid soul, nagged by\nhis wife. Now his features bore a hint of brutality. He walked with a\nslight swagger. He did not roar, but the aura of power was there.\n\nEd's mother explained the change to his father: \"Memory seems not\nalways to match facts, Jack. Mrs. Payten fooled herself into believing\nthat Ronald Payten used to be a bully. So she even fooled Schaeffer's\nmind-machines. And lo! Ronald Payten _is_ a bully now, as far as she is\nconcerned. No, don't worry about her too much, Jack. She may even like\nbeing pushed around.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the months that passed, from out on an asteroid came the\nstep-by-step reports of the building of the first huge star ship. At\nhome, one by one, old acquaintances--or was it just their reasonable\nfacsimiles?--reappeared. Gradually most of the dead of the lunar blowup\nwere restored to life--except for certain scientists who remained\nunforgiven.\n\nBut a new type of population was creeping into the fabric of human\nsociety. Its humanness, in an old sense, could be debated. Its first\nquiet intrusion was marked by an awe that faded into a shrug; it began\nto be accepted casually and somewhat dully, as most past novelties had\nbeen accepted before. Foresight could extend into tomorrow, but its\npictures remained not quite real. The skills of cool, clear thinking,\nwhich education tried to impart in an era that needed it so much, fell\nshort again. No doubt it should have been remembered that the shift\nfrom inattention to unreasonable panic can often be swift.\n\nEven young Ed Dukas, though dedicated in his heart to New and Coming\nThings, sometimes lost sight of these deeper concerns because of his\nlighter interests. Without much help from art, Barbara Day turned out\nto be beautiful. She had a pair of suitors automatically. Ed could\nhave had his stocky frame lengthened. Les Payten could have had his\nbig ears trimmed. But young men often frown on the vanity of tampering\nwith one's appearance. Sometimes there is even a certain pride in minor\nugliness.\n\nThey all had their dates, their dancing, their canoe rides--traditional\npleasures, inherited from generations past. And they had the\nage-old problems of youth approaching adulthood. But now, for them\nand for their increasingly complex civilization, there was a new\nproblem--vitaplasm, which could be grown like flesh, though faster,\nimpressed with a shape, personality and memories. It was said that\n30 per cent of those who died in the explosion of the Moon lab were\nbrought back in this firmer, cheaper medium. But its use did not stop\nhere. For one thing, there were certain adventurous persons, alive and\nhealthy, who changed the character of their bodies willfully.\n\nOne fact some might forget: there were other dead from years before,\nbut remembered and still loved--parents, grandparents. Besides, there\nwere historical characters--Washington, Lincoln, Edison, Cleopatra.\n\nPossibly Joe Doakes could awaken from extinction, puzzled, wondering,\nfrightened, but finding himself at least superficially the same, eating\nmuch the same food, enjoying much the same things. Then something super\nin his body would dawn on him, scaring him more or making him exultant.\nBut it all seemed good at first glance, so a joyful world forgot its\ntimes of suspicion, even against the warnings of specialists, and\nreleased the new processes to almost any operator who could construct\nthe needed equipment.\n\nThe solar system was big; the universe, optimistically promised, seemed\nendless. There was plenty of room. And the task of bringing back just\nthose who had perished with the Moon was enormous and slow. So in\ncellars and out-of-the-way places countless biological technicians\ntried their skill. They could not have made the grade at all if they\nwere stupid, and their results, generally, were good.\n\nThe various Julius Caesars and Michelangelos really came into being\nas novelties, side-show pieces. All were reasonable likenesses,\nphysically. From existing minds such traits and skills as each was\nsupposed to possess could be copied more or less accurately. But\nnone of the pseudo-great amounted to very much. They enjoyed a brief\npopularity; then, assuming the costumes and customs of a changed world,\nthey sank into nonentity among the populace. Like most of those of the\nnew flesh, they kept this secret as if by intuitive prudence. The many\npeople restored in normal protoplasm were less reticent.\n\nThat there were androids around him, known, suspected and unrecognized\nas such, was a thrilling idea to Ed Dukas. It was part of the onward\nmarch to greater wonders--or so it seemed to him most of the time.\nEager to understand how they thought and felt, he sought them out\ncautiously, not wishing to offend. Usually his efforts were met with\ncoolness and evasion--which perhaps gave them away.\n\nBut then Ed met a very special memory man. He wasn't the copy of\nsomebody famous. He was just a humorous legend. Yet now perhaps he\nwas the right kind of personality striking against the right sort of\ncircumstances to produce the type of action and fire that could affect\nthe existing era.\n\nEd and his two friends, Les Payten and Barbara Day, found him in a\nlittle park feeding pigeons. Or, rather, _he_ found them. For in\nconformity with an ancient village belief that no one should be a\nstranger to anyone else, he grinned at them and said, \"Hello, there!\nNice young fellers. Nice girl! Sit and gab a while? I keep gettin'\nlonesome. Mixed up. Got to get straightened out. Or try, anyway. Put\nyourselves down? That's fine!\"\n\nAbashed and curious after that, Ed and Barbara and Les sat and mostly\njust listened.\n\n\"Been around these times three months. Scared stiff at first. Thought\nI was addled. Know somethin'? I can remember all the way back to\n1870. It's a fake, sure. No, they didn't make me look young, or\neven give me all my teeth. Afraid of spoiling 'verisimilitude,' my\ngreat-great-great-something-grandson-supposed-to-be said. I'm a family\nbrag. Look what I keep carrying around with me. One of the first\neditions of _Huck Finn_. They found this tintype of a feller inside\nit. Illinois farmer. And look at this here writing in the front of the\nbook. 'Property of Abel Freeman.' So I'm supposed to be him, slouch hat\nand all--funny, I can't get used to anything else. So I write just like\nthat. This tintype and the writing are the only solid clues about what\nthe original Abel Freeman was really like. Up to there, I'm him. The\nrest is mostly storybook stuff, and the idea the family has that their\nancestor was a kind of pixilated hellion--the sort some folks like to\ntell about. Some way for a man to be born, huh? Shucks, I can even\nremember the night I was supposed to have died. Drunk, and kicked in\nthe belly by my own mule, because he didn't like my smell. Hell, I bet\nin real life that mule would of plum enjoyed whisky!\"\n\nAbel Freeman stopped talking. He turned pale gray eyes set in a face\nthat looked like brown leather toward his audience with expectant\namusement, as if he understood the eerie impression he'd made on them\nand was curious about their reactions.\n\nBarbara took the lead. \"We're surely glad to know you, Mr. Freeman,\"\nshe said, shaking his big brown paw and unconsciously aping his manner\nof speech. \"I'm sure you could tell us plum more. What's the world ever\ncoming to?\"\n\nHis grip, for an instant, was almost literally like that of a vise. But\nwhen Barbara winced with pain, his hand relaxed, and his look became\nhonestly gentle and apologetic, though it retained a certain slyness of\ntricks being played or unprecedented power being demonstrated.\n\n\"Oh, excuse me, lady!\" he drawled. \"This first Abel Freeman--he was\nsupposed to be a very strong and vigorous man. Me--naturally I'm even a\nlot stronger. Sometimes I just forget. But I try to be right courtly.\nThere, I'll rub your fingers. Hope I didn't break no bones.\"\n\nBarbara laughed a bit nervously. \"No, Mr. Freeman--I'm fine,\" she\nassured him, nodding her dark head. \"Now, if you'll tell us--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--about what the world and everything is coming to,\" Abel\nFreeman went on, his tone more languid than his eyes. \"Well, matters\ncould get mighty rough. I've been studying up--thinking. When I first\ngot to these times, I didn't like them. Everything seemed addled.\nGuess I was homesick. I kind of resented being made the cheap way,\ntoo. But even way back in the years I remember, they used to say that\nmaybe there'd be flying machines or even balloons to the Moon. So I\nperked up and got acclimated, and said to myself, 'Abel, my boy, take\nwhat's given to you and don't whine, even though you weren't asked if\nyou wanted to come here. And with all that can be done now, why not\nbring your old woman and her chewing tobacco? And your four ornery\nsons? Nat was the worst. And Nancy, your daughter, who was an unholy\nterror? Of course this family that you recollect so good probably don't\nmatch historical fact so much, being just romanticized, mostly made-up\nmemories put into your head. But they're plum real to you. Guess when\nthey synthesized you, they should have left those recollections out.\nBecause you love that family of yours, ornery or not, and would be\nhappy to see its members again.' And I said to myself besides, 'Abel,\nbein' made the cheap way has got plenty of advantages. You're strong\nas a dozen regular men, and you won't need rejuvenation, because\nyou'll never get any older. You'll heal even if you're hurt something\nterrible. Trouble is, your kind'll be some mighty stiff competition for\nthe present holders of the land. Of course people want to get along\npeaceably--even your sort, Abel. But plenty of folks will wind up\ntrusting your sort no more than they'd trust a billygoat under a line\nof wash. Yep, I'm afraid there's gonna be some mighty interesting days\ncoming!'\"\n\nAbel Freeman ended his conversation almost dreamily. He'd hung his\nslouch hat on the corner of the bench back. In his iron-gray hair, the\nsun picked out reddish glints. His gaze, which might have been designed\nespecially for precision squirrel-shooting, wandered down a path that\ncurved along the park lake.\n\nEd Dukas found him a fascinating mixture of old romance and comedy,\nartfully concealing the most recent of wonders, the dark channels of\nwhich held the potentials of great centuries to come, or mindless\nsilence after destruction. The treachery was not in Abel Freeman\nhimself but in the fact of his being.\n\nEd's mouth was dry. \"You're honest, Mr. Freeman,\" he said.\n\nAbel Freeman answered this with a nod and a shrug. \"Funny,\" he drawled.\n\"Thought I saw a young feller I was sort of expecting. A congenial\nenemy, name of Tom Granger. Look, suppose you three sidekicks of mine\nget on your feet nice and easy, and walk the other way on that path. It\nwould be safer. Not too far. Just a piece.\"\n\nThis might have been an armed robber's command, but Ed sensed that it\nwas nothing like that. Without a word, he led Les and Barbara away.\n\nThere was a blinding, blue-white flash. The bench on which they had\nbeen sitting was gone--vaporized by fearful heat. Incandescent vapors\nrose from a big hole in the turf. When condensed and solidified, they\nwould show little flecks of gold transmuted from soil. These were the\neffects of the familiar Midas Touch pistol. It used lighter atoms to\nform heavier ones, while it converted a little of the total mass into\nenergy.\n\nFreeman must have leaped away at just the right instant to avoid\ndestruction. With astonishing agility, he was pursuing his intended\nmurderer. As Freeman sprang to the youth's shoulders, they both fell\nin a heap on the walk and slid to a stop. Freeman's hand flicked, and\nthe weapon flew into the bushes.\n\nBy then Ed and Barbara and Les were standing over the prone forms.\nFreeman was unruffled.\n\n\"Friends,\" he said, laughing, \"meet up with a young one with a sharp\nviewpoint and lots of guts in his own way. Yep, Tom Granger.\"\n\nGranger was panting heavily. His mass of black hair streamed down over\nhis thin face. He looked scarcely older than Ed or Les, but these\ndays that meant little. In repose, his large, dark eyes might have\nbeen limpid and idealistic; now they flashed fury. His shabbiness was\naffected. Certainly, in this era, there were no reasons for poverty.\n\nNow he began to struggle again, in Freeman's grasp. Futilely, of\ncourse. \"Yes, I have guts!\" he declared. \"I wanted to kill you,\nFreeman--with whatever means that are left that can still accomplish\nthat with things like you! I wanted the incident to get into the\nnewscast--yes, to give me public attention. And not for any stupid\nvanity, but for the best purpose there ever was. I wanted a chance to\nbe listened to, while I tell what everyone must have begun to sense by\nnow. Damn you, Freeman! Let me up!\"\n\nAbel Freeman smirked indulgently and obliged.\n\nGranger rose lamely but gamely. \"You seem to be impromptu acquaintances\nof this Abel Freeman,\" he said to Ed and his companions. \"He has\nfeelings, he thinks; he's even a good person. In some ways he's just\nan interesting rogue of the nineteenth century. But he's a device. And\nunless something is done, we'll be as obsolete as the dinosaur! Our\nscience serves us no longer. It serves other masters, nearer to its\nmeaning. Others than I have realized it. In every two houses this side\nof the world there is already an average of one of these creatures of\nvitaplasm. Is Earth to be kept for us, and for the joy of being human;\nor are we to become--basically, and no matter how humanized--mere\nsynthetic mechanisms, trading our birthright for a few mechanical\nadvantages?\"\n\nThe shot from the Midas Touch pistol was drawing a crowd. An\napproaching police siren wailed.\n\nSuddenly Granger fixed his eyes on Ed in surprise and recognition.\n\"Dukas,\" he said. \"Let me see--Edward Dukas. At a time when the world\nwas more reasonably watchful, your house was under surveillance. As a\npossible means of contacting one Mitchell Prell--who had his hand in\nwhat once happened to us, and perhaps in what is happening now. How\ndoes it feel, Dukas, to be so close to such a celebrity? Ah, maybe\nyou're shy!\"\n\nFlattening out Granger again would have been no useful answer to Ed's\nmemories of bitter wrongs. He smiled briefly at him.\n\n\"Come see me some evening when you don't feel so much like making a\nmonkey of someone, because someone has just made a monkey out of you,\"\nhe said.\n\nThen he hustled his companions away. \"There's no good in getting\ninvolved in public confusion,\" he told them. \"Anyhow not till we talk\nthings out and get them straight.\"\n\nTen minutes later they were in a quiet restaurant.\n\n\"Abel Freeman,\" Les Payten said. \"He was quite a surprise at that.\"\n\n\"Rather, more of a pointing out of facts we already knew,\" Barbara\nremarked.\n\n\"The old robot-peril come true,\" Less said pensively. \"Humanity\nthreatened to be replaced, not by clanking giants of metal, simple and\nmelodramatic, but by beings much more refined--though they are perhaps\nmuch the same thing. My own father is one of them.\"\n\n\"There's truth in what Granger said,\" Ed pointed out. \"There's that\ndread of being shouldered out of the way by something strange and\ntougher. I can feel it too. Granger can certainly make use of it,\npreaching. He's clever. But he's the worst kind of fool.\"\n\n\"Yeah, hammering on the detonator cap of the entire Earth,\" Les said,\nbreathing softly.\n\nThe three friends, sitting around a table under soft lights and in\npleasant surroundings, looked at one another. The food before them was\ngood, the music was quiet and soothing. But at eye level, in the air\nwhere their glances passed, seemed to hang all the elements of the\ncomplex civilization to which they belonged: its luxury and beauty, its\nclimbing technology that could conquer death and reach for other solar\nsystems, but by the same or related forces could dissolve worlds,\nespecially if mankind, at the top, lost control of itself.\n\n\"I thought things would go along smoothly and reasonably,\" Barbara\noffered. \"There's certainly plenty of room for both people and\nandroids. I took all of that more or less on faith. But I'm afraid I'm\nwrong. After all, how can human beings live beside beings that blend\nindistinguishably with the mass and yet are stronger, quicker?\"\n\nEd remembered signs of friction that he'd heard about. A minor riot\nhere or there. He remembered public statements by specialists like\nSchaeffer admitting that some confusion was on the way but declaring\nthat in the end everything should be better for everyone. Those\nspecialists had the calculators, the great electronic thought-machines,\ndigesting trends, making profound predictions. But then there was\nanother thought--had many of those scientists already converted their\nown bodies to a stronger medium?\n\nEd saw that Les Payten had a faint sweat of strain on his forehead,\nthough he knew that Les was no nervous coward. His sullen poise just\nafter the lunar explosion long ago had proved that.\n\n\"Maybe the worst of all,\" Les was saying, \"is the sense of being\ncarried along, swiftly and helplessly, by things that are too big\nand complicated. You wish you could find a ledge somewhere in the\ntime-stream and stop for a while to get your bearings. Sometimes you\nfeel that you are in a one-way tunnel where you have to keep moving.\nIs there light at the end of the tunnel? Maybe it's just a matter of\npersonal adjustment--a taking of whatever comes.\"\n\n\"I feel as though we're at the threshold of some terrible danger, Ed,\"\nBarbara said. \"What can we do about it?\"\n\nHe saw how strong and earnest she looked, and it reassured him. He\ntouched her hand briefly. \"I don't know exactly,\" he said. \"But\nI'm for holding course toward the bigger future that stirred me up\nwith big dreams of the planets, of the stars. And I'm in favor of\nbeing _reasonable_. I've seen too much hate and fear and unreason in\npeople. The way things are, it doesn't have to be a lot of people any\nmore--just a few gone a little crazy. The Moon blew up by accident.\nA world was gone. But what happened by accident can certainly happen\nby design or with the aid of fury. So, everywhere we go we can talk\nagainst fury and panic, and _for_ reason. To our friends, and in the\nstreets. Everywhere that we can, and to everyone. Small as that effort\nis, it might help.\"\n\nSolemnly the three friends shook hands and agreed to work out the\ndetails of a plan.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThat same night, at his home in the suburbs, Ed Dukas read an article\nthat had especially attracted his attention. Could vitaplasm be\ngrown into forms unknown before? Could it be shaped from a plan--a\nblueprint--like the metal and plastic forming a machine? Heart here,\nlungs there, nervous system arranged so? Scaly armor, long, creeping\nbody? Or wings that fluttered through the air? The author saw no reason\nwhy this could not happen. Monstrous things. Ed Dukas chuckled at the\nmelodramatic idea. But he suspected that it was far from impossible.\n\nYoung Dukas also had a caller that night.\n\n\"You said I should come to see you,\" Tom Granger told him when they\nwere alone in Ed's room. Ed was on guard at once.\n\nHis visitor's mood seemed to have changed since the afternoon.\n\n\"Sorry if I seemed out of line today,\" Granger said. \"My motives are\ngood. And I didn't want to insult you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Ed responded shortly. \"But you didn't come here just to tell\nme that. How does it happen that you're not in jail?\"\n\n\"Abel Freeman discreetly pressed no charges. I wish he had. But, like\nyou, he just disappeared. There was only that hole in the ground--made\nby the Midas Touch pistol--a feeble thing to admit for a publicity\nshowdown. So I kept still, and the police couldn't hold me. Fact is,\nmost of them seem sympathetic to what I stand for--the venerable human\nprivilege of walking on one's own green planet as a natural animal,\nloving one's wife and children in the ancient, simple manner.\"\n\nGranger was a good orator. Mysteriously, Ed was faintly moved. Perhaps\nthe gentle argument was too plain and clear. But Ed remained wary of\nthe traps of language and feeling, and of perhaps impractical dreams.\n\nHis anger sharpened. Then, knowing the possibly deadly quality of anger\nin these times and wishing to counteract that everywhere, he yearned\ndesperately to be a master psychologist, always calm and smiling and\nsupremely persuasive. But he could not be like that. He was too human\nand limited. Maybe too primitive.\n\n\"You still haven't told me why you came here, Granger,\" he said coldly.\n\"Why have you passed up a chance for public shouting to come and talk\nto me?\"\n\nGranger smiled. \"You're clever enough, Dukas, to know that to win\nthe nephew of Mitchell Prell over to my way of thinking could be to\nmy advantage before that public. Or that, if I can't make friends\nwith him, at least knowing him better might help. Even the latter\ncircumstance could be like having a finger on a whole set of\nadvantages when the showdown between human beings and androids finally\ncomes. Oh, I admire Prell! A great man--if he _was_ a man when last\nseen! But his kind of greatness is poison, Dukas--though millions with\nshort memories have foolishly forgiven him. But if he ever turns up\nagain, you'll know it, and so, perhaps, will I--before he can do any\nfurther damage. You surely must realize that he bears a double guilt:\nfor the blowup and for the development of vitaplasm!\"\n\nGranger's smile was savage and hopeful.\n\nEd laughed in his face. \"You think that secretly I might hate Mitchell\nPrell, eh, Granger? But he was the idol of my childhood, a whimsical,\nfriendly little man. So I'm stuck with loyalty. But even if I hated him\nblackly, I wouldn't come over to your side. I don't like the way you\nthink. Until the blowup happened, it was bravo for science and empire.\nAfterward, your hysterical soul was free from blame and white as snow,\nand he was guilty. Maybe I judge you wrongly. I hope I do. But the way\nI add it up, it's not the androids or any other new and inevitable\ndevelopment that is the big danger; it's people like you, though maybe\nyou don't realize it. Loudmouths who stir up confusion, animosity,\nhatred. Maybe I ought to kill you. Then there'd be one less spark in\nthe powder barrel!\"\n\n\"Why don't you?\" Granger mocked. \"There'd still be others. And I'd be\nbrought back.\"\n\nEd nodded. \"The benefits of our civilization,\" he said. \"How would you\nlike to be an android? Does the idea scare you? You know, Granger,\nsome people say that, regardless of how you're returned to the living,\nyou're not the same person you were but only a superficially exact\nduplicate.\"\n\n\"You know I'd always choose to be human, Dukas,\" Granger muttered,\nlooking almost terrified.\n\n\"Sure, Granger,\" Ed taunted. \"You're not afraid of death--the knowledge\nthat science can restore you gives you courage. You can take the\nbenefits of scientific advancement, can't you? But assuming its\nresponsibilities is another thing.\"\n\n\"I'm not dodging responsibility! I'm grabbing it, Dukas! I'm striking\nout for sane control. I've done things already! While I worked in the\nvaults, where personal recordings are kept, certain of those little\ncylinders disappeared. They won't be found again! Some men don't\ndeserve that much protection against mishap--among them your uncle! I'm\nproud of this, and I boast of it! No, don't accuse me! Even an official\ncomplaint would be challenged by many people and then buried in a heap\nof red tape. I can be a dirty fighter, Dukas; and I'll bite and kill\nand kick and holler my lungs out to keep this planet from going to the\nmachines!\"\n\nThe wild look in Granger's face was the thing that prompted Ed to\naction. The admission of the theft only emphasized the ghoulish\ndetermination that was there. The only hope seemed in smashing that ego\nout of existence--for a while at least.\n\nEd chuckled. \"So you'd take even the essence of people's selves,\" he\nsaid.\n\nGranger's gaze didn't waver. \"If every last thing I hold dear--and\nwhich I believe most real human beings hold dear in like manner--were\nin danger, I'd do anything.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" Ed said grimly.\n\nThen he struck and struck and struck again. Blood spurted from\nGranger's smashed lips and nose, as he crashed to the floor, struggled\nto his feet and fell again.\n\nThere was movement at the door of the room. From behind, Ed was gripped\nby a strength greater than his own. \"Stop it, Ed,\" he was commanded\nquietly. It was his father.\n\nThrough bloodied lips, Granger was explaining hurriedly, \"Your son\nand I disagree. He lost his temper. All I ask is that the good parts\nof science--medical and so forth--be kept and the rest banned. And\nthat life become simple. A thing of fields and flowers, and wholesome\nphysical work. And not a mechanized bedlam, full of constant danger and\ntension.\"\n\nGranger sounded very earnest, Ed thought. Maybe he was earnest. Maybe\nhe was a good actor.\n\n\"Ban this, ban that!\" Ed shouted. \"No one ever lived happily under\nthe kind of artificial bans you mean, Granger! And what will you do\nwith the billions of people who disagree with your pretty vision?\nSome of them will hate what you advocate as much as you hate existing\ncircumstances! And if modern weapons are once used....\"\n\n\"Quiet, Ed,\" his father said softly. \"You've assaulted your guest--one\nwho, as far as I can see, has the most reasonable of views. A beautiful\npicture. I agree with it myself--entirely.\"\n\n\"Look, Dad,\" Ed began. \"This Granger here is trying to solve today's\nand tomorrow's problems with yesterday's poor answers.\"\n\nEd stopped. He had an odd thought: his synthetic father had been\ncreated largely from his and his mother's memories, at a terrible\ntime of grief, when his mother's reactions had turned against the\ngroping toward the stars. Before that, Dad had been somewhat averse to\nmechanization. But now he was distinctly more so, as if that grief and\naversion had marked him.\n\nJack Dukas was now medicating Granger's face with antiseptics while\nGranger preached, as if from some deep font of a new wisdom: \"You see,\nMr. Dukas, again, as in the past, danger is creeping up on us without\nreceiving serious attention. Beings that are really robots are already\ncontrolling part of their own production. Their creation, everywhere,\nshould be banned or stamped out. Existing androids should be converted\nto flesh or destroyed.... I'll go now. Thank you for your help. But I\nthink I'll get in touch with your son occasionally. He needs guidance.\"\n\nEd nodded grimly. \"Perhaps I do,\" he said. \"Maybe everyone does. You\nwatch me and I'll watch you, eh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the succeeding months Ed did his best to spread his doctrine\nof calm and reason, working against the agitation which he knew was\nalready well under way. Les Payten and Barbara Day were with him in\nthis. All over the world there were others, mostly unknown to them,\nbut with the same ideas: \"Use your head.... Don't put fear before\nknowledge.... Do you _know_ an android? What is his name? Maybe Miller\nor Johnson? You must know a few. And do they think so differently from\nyourself? Yes, there are problems and no doubt prejudice. It may even\nbe justified. But the answers to our difficulties must be cool-minded.\nEveryone knows why.\"\n\nEd and his companions talked in this manner to their acquaintances,\nspoke on street corners, sent letters to newscast agencies. And they\nwon many people over. The trouble was that they, and others like them,\ncould not reach everybody.\n\nTheir Earth remained beautiful. There were hazy hills covered with\ntrees; there were soaring spires. The unrest was an undercurrent.\n\nThis was a time of choosing of sides, and of buildup, while there was\na sense of helpless slipping onward toward what few could truly want.\nVoices with another, harsher message were raised. Tom Granger was\nhardly alone there, either. Tracts were passed out as part of their\nmethod: _What Is Our Heritage?_; _The Right to Be Human_; _Technology\nVersus Wisdom_. Perhaps directly out of such a mixture of truth and\ncrude thinking the assassinations began. There were thousands in\nscattered places.\n\nOne day Ed Dukas pushed into a knot of curious onlookers and saw the\nbody of one of the first of these. There, in the same park where Ed had\nfirst met Abel Freeman, it had been found in the early morning. A Midas\nTouch blast had torn it in half.\n\n\"It's Howard Besser, a machinist who lives in the same building with\nme,\" a man in the crowd offered. \"He died once in the lunar explosion.\nNow it happened again. That's no joke, even though he can be brought\nback.\"\n\nEd saw the victim's torn flesh. It _looked_ like flesh. But broken\nbones had little metallic glints in them. Could you avoid remembering\nthat, mated to like, these beings of vitaplasm could even reproduce\ntheir kind, to help increase their number? Had persons like Tom Granger\nplanned even this dramatization of a difference? Bits of this flesh\nstill squirmed, hours after violence.\n\nGranger had made progress. Growing public attention had won him the\nprivilege of orating on the newscast. It was he who had first talked\nabout vampires and androids--together, and to a world-wide audience. He\nalso accomplished an important part in winning the legal suppression of\nlabs creating human forms in vitaplasm.\n\n\"It was desecration,\" he declared in his speech. \"It is a tragedy\nthat we could not clamp down the lid sooner. There are an estimated\nseventy million of these 'improvements on nature' now in existence.\nAnd there are many hidden establishments still producing more. Can we\never destroy them all? It is criminal to lock a human soul in such\nsubstance. If, of course, the soul truly remains human, as it was meant\nto be....\"\n\nGranger's voice was always gentle. Yet to his listeners it suggested\ndark, lonesome places where there is danger. Which was true. For now\nother killings had started. Familiar human blood was spilled.\n\nOn a pavement Ed saw a grim legend smeared in red beside a corpse:\n\"WHO WILL INHERIT THE UNIVERSE? RETRIBUTION. ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES\nANOTHER.\"\n\nScattered throughout the Americas, Europe and the Westernized Orient\nwere millions more of such murders. The result was a trading of grim\ngoods, with the far hardier android winning in the tally. And that\nwinning was a threat. It could seem a promise to man of the end of his\nera. So here was another spur to hysteria, always mounting higher.\n\nEd Dukas and his friends stayed on at the University. They studied\nwith the efficient help of the sensipsych machine and its vividly real\nvisions, which could demonstrate as real experiences almost any skill,\nfrom the playing of an antique Viennese zither to the probing of the\ninner structure of a star. They also put in scattered hours of work\nin the factories, whose products still aimed at empire in the spatial\ndistance. But above all they kept on with their appeals for reason.\nTheir success was great. In the main, people were reasonable and\nclearheaded. But a total winning-over was far from possible.\n\nNoted men such as Schaeffer were shouting on the newscast. Shouting for\ncalm--increasing the tinny babble of the choosing of sides.\n\nMore and more, Ed Dukas began to lose faith in the Big Future.\n\n\"Maybe we should have kept still,\" he said to Les Payten and Barbara\nDay. \"We only added our small faggot to the fire.\"\n\nHis friends laughed with him--ruefully--as they walked together across\nthe campus.\n\nSome minutes later Les Payten nodded to them, and, with a half smile,\nsaid, \"So long for now. Don't lose any sleep--not over worries, anyhow.\"\n\nHe sauntered off. In matters of love, Les was a good loser.\n\nBarbara Day had taken a little apartment on a tree-lined street. It\nwas nice to walk there in the twilight. Not far from the apartment\na half-acre of ground had been allowed to grow wild with trees and\nbushes, for contrast to the surrounding sleek neatness.\n\nThere, in the thick shadows, Ed Dukas saw sinuous movement. He had\na fleeting glimpse of something long and winding, and perhaps half\nas thick as his body. Then he saw it again--saw its weird glow, saw\nthe interlocking hexagonal plates that covered it everywhere. But it\ndid not suggest a gigantic snake at all. For one thing, its mode of\nlocomotion was different--a rippling movement of thousands of little\nprongs on its undersides seemed to be involved in its principle.\nIt hurried quietly now for cover. Rhododendron bushes parted. It\ndisappeared behind a great oak.\n\nBarbara and Ed rushed forward. The grass bore no marks. Prudently, they\ndid not venture into the dark undergrowth.\n\nEd's skin prickled all over and felt too small for him. \"This is it,\"\nhe said in a flat tone.\n\n\"_What_, Ed?\"\n\n\"Life plotted on the engineer's drawing board. Vitaplasm. The days when\nnature designed all animals are over, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"What would it be for, Ed?\"\n\n\"How would I really know? Want to guess?\"\n\n\"To create more terror maybe?\" Barbara said. \"What else? To go around\nat night--to stir people up with a horror that they've never known\nbefore. They'll realize it's vitaplasm, the stuff of the androids too.\nThey'll link hatreds. Maybe it's another trick--a propaganda stunt\nto force the fight to the finish. A stunt invented by somebody like\nGranger.\"\n\n\"It seems to fit the pattern,\" Ed said hoarsely. \"You're probably\nright. But this thing could have been made by the other side, too. The\nandroid side. As a means of reprisal. I've admired them. But I don't\nespecially trust _their_ judgment, either.\"\n\nEd Dukas felt sick. He wondered now how much longer anything on Earth\ncould last.\n\nBarbara touched his arm gently. \"Ed, we should notify the police. For\nthe safety of the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Of course. And you won't stay out here alone tonight. You'll put up at\na hotel, or I'll bunk on your floor.\"\n\nBarbara managed to laugh. \"The building is stout. My window is high.\nThere are plenty of tenants. I'm not dangerously stupid and I don't\nswoon. But I rather like the idea of having you close by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEd Dukas had no trouble convincing the police that he had seen\nsomething extraordinary--which was proof enough that there had been\nother calls, previously. Ed slept a few hours on a divan, listening,\nwhile, outside, armed men patrolled the streets and watched the backs\nof buildings, which were kept brilliantly illuminated. Floodlights\nlighted up that shaggy wood lot like day. Low, flat robot vehicles\nplowed through it.\n\nNothing was found.\n\nBut miles away, nearer the city, there were a dozen dead--all of them\nof the old order of life. They were crushed. Not a bone in their bodies\nwas intact. They had been dragged from their beds while they slept.\n\nHorror swept through the city. The monster or monsters had been seen.\nThey were of the same substance as the androids. Therefore, this was an\nandroid attack, clear and simple--to minds blurred by fear and fury.\n\nScared, angry faces surrounded Ed Dukas in the streets the next\nmorning. The coldness in him was like a stone behind his heart. He\nseemed to be hurled along by time, helpless to change its course. Even\nBarbara looked sullen and confused, though, walking beside him, she\ntried to sound cheerfully rational.\n\n\"You know, we could all be changed over into androids. I wonder if you\nor I would ever want that? I think that even you are not especially\nsympathetic to them, except as something new and potentially great.\nDamn! I wish my wits were clearer. An android is a refined machine, you\nmight say. But to be a human being is to be a thing of soul--is that\nit? A creature of tradition and pride, of sentiment.\"\n\nEd Dukas shrugged. He felt bone and brain weary.\n\nThat same day there were bloody riots in scattered localities--much\nworse trouble than before. It seemed like the start of an avalanche.\n\nThat afternoon another incident happened. Les Payten came to meet his\nfriends again in their favorite restaurant. They sat chatting glumly\nand listening to the newscast. The androids--\"The Phonies,\" they were\nalready being called--were slipping away to the hills, for safety and\nalso no doubt to gather their own not inconsiderable numbers, and to\nentrench themselves.\n\nLes Payten was called to the phone. He came back after a minute, saying\nwith a puzzled expression, and almost a cynical smile, \"My father\ncommitted suicide. He left a note: 'Eternity is a joke. And I'm sick of\nbeing a robot. But what's the good of being a man, either--now?' Burned\nhimself wide open with a Midas Touch pistol. I guess the ultimate\ncruelty would be to bring him back.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night there were three times as many crushed bodies as the night\nbefore. But there were far more deaths caused by other violent means.\nTwo weeks passed, each day worse than the preceding. Neighbors started\nhurling imprecations at neighbors: \"Test-tube monkey!... Obsolete\nimbecile!...\"\n\nOnce there was a news report: \"Equipment found--a power generator of\na type and output similar to that for a star ship, but obviously for\nanother purpose: meant, it seems, to power high-energy weapons of the\nbeam type. Is this an android or a human assembly? The equipment was\nordered dismantled. It was found in a large basement in the City.\"\n\nAnd Tom Granger began his broadcasts again: \"Androids--your numbers\nare relatively few. You could not win against us. And we would take\nyou back--kindly--to become people again. Most of you once were human\nbeings. You were meant to be that...\" Granger's tone was softer; it was\ncondescending.\n\nEd Dukas phoned Granger at the newscast studio. After a long wait, he\nmanaged to contact him. That Granger agreed to speak to him at all was\nno doubt due to Ed's relationship to Mitchell Prell.\n\n\"Granger,\" he said, \"I'm pleading. Please, forget that you know how to\nsay anything. No, I don't want to offend you--but it's just no good.\nI'm not guessing--I've seen. To some you may be a great leader. To\nothers--well--you're a lot less. So do us a favor--again, please! Go\naway, disappear. Take a long, silent rest in a place unknown.\"\n\nEd Dukas was desperate, grasping at straws. For a fleeting moment his\nhope almost convinced him that his mixture of begging and ridicule\nmight work.\n\n\"Do I know you? Oh, yes, Dukas!\" Granger mocked. \"We should converse\nagain when we both have the time. You still need instruction, I see.\nYou are an incorrigible lover of fantastic novelty, Edward Dukas! Now\nyou're frightened.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am frightened!\" Ed replied, calmly now. \"If you weren't a fool\nand a fanatic, you could guess that millions of androids--supermen,\nsome call them--could not be weak.\"\n\n\"Goodbye for the present, Dukas.\" Granger broke the connection.\n\nEd rubbed his face with his hands. He thought of the sinuous thing\nhe had once seen, and of the killing that it--and other things not\nnecessarily of the same shape but of the same substance--had done.\nCould Granger be one of those who sought to stir up more dread and fury\nwith lab-created monsters of vitaplasm? Should he try first to find out\nwho was using and directing them?\n\nIt would be slow work. So, that same afternoon, he chose another path\nwhich might lead to quicker results. He went looking for old Abel\nFreeman, who he guessed was of the sort to be a leader among his kind.\nBy asking around, he located the house where Freeman was said to live.\nBut the picturesque android had long since vacated his lodgings.\n\nEd gathered Les Payten and Barbara.\n\n\"Freeman will be in the hills somewhere,\" Barbara pointed out. \"With\nothers like him. What if, for a lark, we rent a helicopter, and see if\nwe can find him? What can we lose?\"\n\n\"We're near the end of our rope,\" Les said. \"I'm willing to try\nanything.\"\n\nIt was a crazy stunt, but they agreed on it. Ed had picked up some\ninformation about where Freeman might be found, plus a few facts of his\nrecent history. Naturally, Freeman had a bad reputation.\n\nArriving over the wooded mountain country where Freeman had often been\nseen in the past, Ed let his craft settle into various forest glades,\none after another. At first they saw no one, although certainly many\nandroids had now retreated into this wilderness.\n\nHowever, after they had made a dozen tries in as many places, Freeman\nhimself suddenly appeared, dirty, covered with burrs, but dressed now\nin coveralls of modern vintage. A Midas Touch pistol was in his belt.\n\n\"Hello!\" he greeted. \"Yes, I know you three young ones! Are you lost?\"\n\n\"We're here for neighborly conversation,\" Ed began.\n\n\"That's mighty nice,\" Freeman mocked with a twinkle in his hard blue\neyes. \"Could be you're here just to snoop. Could be me and the boys\nshould do you in.\"\n\n\"Could be we _are_ here to snoop--to learn a little better what's going\non, that is,\" Ed replied. \"And we're also here in the hope of finding\nsomebody with good sense and wits and influence enough to keep this\nplanet from becoming another Asteroid Belt.\"\n\nAbel Freeman's glance held a certain sparkle of admiration when he\nglanced at Ed; then it turned grim.\n\n\"You couldn't mean me,\" he said. \"Figured on going around, minding\nmy own business, without being crowded. Got crowded plenty, though,\ncloser to the City. Gettin' crowded here, too. Had to smash up quite\na few people. Don't figure on taking it for good. Lucky we were made\ncheap. Couldn't stand it, otherwise. Hiding in the brush. Eating\nsticks. Hardly ever sleeping. Lucky we can't catch pneumonia. We could\nstand conditions far worse than this--but it gets awful tiresome. Seen\nGranger lately?\"\n\n\"You can smell him most everywhere,\" Ed answered bitterly.\n\nThere was a loud explosion a hundred yards to the left. A Midas Touch\nblast. Ed felt the shock-pressure of it and held his breath until the\nradiation-tainted vapors cooled and blew away.\n\n\"That's Nat, the hellcat of my boys,\" Abel Freeman remarked casually.\nThen he shouted, \"Nat--you damnfool--don't you know there's company?\"\n\nThen Ed and his companions saw them--a beetle-browed foursome peering\nfrom the brush. The Freeman boys. They looked like a quartet of\nNeanderthals. But in a way they were less human than Neanderthal\nmen. For they were the crystallization, via science and vitaplasm,\nof someone's romanticized and comic conception of the vigor of his\nancestors.\n\nBehind them now appeared a girl with pale golden skin and eyes whose\nslant suggested the beauty of a leopard. This would be Freeman's\ndaughter, the inestimable Nancy. There was also a leathery crone,\nmother of the pack, and wife of Abel.\n\nNat Freeman fired the Midas Touch again. Obviously he wasn't trying for\naccuracy. In fact, he must have miscalculated some. For the wind blew\nthe radioactive vapors against Les Payten, standing a little to one\nside. He screamed once, writhing in their hot clutch, and collapsed.\n\nAbel Freeman, the android renegade, rushed unharmed through those\nvapors. Only his clothes charred. \"Nat, you stop playin'!\" he ordered.\n\"And as for you three young ones--you haven't got the sense you talk\nabout! Coming here? You're enemies. And you're weak as daisies! No, I\ndon't figure I'd ever want to be your kind, even without the raw deal I\ngot! Lots better to be a devil in the woods until we can come out--if\nthere's anything left to come out of, or to! Now get out of here\nfast--before my family gets annoyed.\"\n\nAbel Freeman lifted Les Payten's hideously burned body into the\nhelicopter and then held the door open for Ed and Barbara. \"You better\ntake care of this fellow right away,\" Freeman said. \"Now get on your\nway!\"\n\nEd guided the craft toward the City, where Les would certainly spend\nseveral weeks in a lab tank before his injured flesh was back to\nnormal. Les kept muttering in semi-delirium, \"Damned robots. Freeman,\ntoo. And damned, ornery people. Got to pick between them, don't we?\nSo maybe zero will cancel zero. Can't stay on the fence all the time.\nSorry, when the going gets rough, I'm for the people. Peaceful common\nsense? There just isn't any.\"\n\nLes's voice sounded like a dirge for two races.\n\nBarbara said, \"Maybe he's right. There isn't any sense left. Only a\npicking of sides for battle. Our efforts went to waste.\"\n\nShe sounded remote, almost unfriendly. Ed suddenly felt that he was\nlosing her, too.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThat was a bad evening for Ed Dukas. He left Barbara at her house,\nwhich was now guarded. But he did not get home easily. For that was the\nevening trouble became general. John Jones of old-time flesh and blood,\nand George Smith of vitaplasm forgot all their politeness and let their\nsmoldering thoughts come to the surface:\n\n\"So now you brew up monsters like yourselves, to attack us. I wouldn't\nbe like you if it was the last way to be alive.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, brother? Those creatures must be yours. What makes you so\ngood? Born with your own hide, eh? The elite. With jelly for insides,\nand a mean nature.\"\n\nTalk swiftly led to flying fists. But who could hurt an android\nwith a human fist? Before their hardened knuckles a human jaw could\nbecome mush. Still, there were heavier primitive weapons. Then, by\nprogression, weapons that were not so primitive.\n\nEd didn't try any more to quell the trouble. He watched it, walked\naround it and away from it. The wise and careful thinking that he had\nbeen taught to believe in seemed to have deserted his kind. The stars\nwere only a remote fancy, lost in the chaos of local emotion. Feeling\nbeaten, Ed finally got home.\n\nThis was the evening when he told himself that anything could happen\nat any moment--that morning might not even come. On the newscast, he\nheard the report that the first star ship--to be aimed perhaps at\nProxima Centauri or Sirius--was within weeks of completion out there\non its asteroid. There were infinite heights to this era of his. And\nterrifying depths.\n\nThis was the evening when, fearing that the spoken word could no longer\nbe heard through the din of clashing hatreds, Ed Dukas decided to write\nletters.\n\nHe meant to begin with a letter to Les and then write to his father,\nwhose eyes had turned backward toward archaic simplicities. He wanted\nto write to Granger, asking again for calm. But he had only completed a\nfew paragraphs to Les when that kid nickname of his appeared on a blank\nsheet of his paper. From nowhere:\n\n\"_Nipper._\"\n\nOnly Mitchell Prell, unheard from for ten years, had ever called him\nthat. His uncle. A likable little man, tainted by accusations, but\npart of the once thrilling thoughts of the future. Mitchell Prell\nhad belonged to the onward surging and reaching of science--and its\nstumbling. The lunar blowup had come as a forerunner of the first leap\nto the stars. And the human-and-android animosity had resulted from the\nmastery of the forces of life. Wonder becoming horror. White turning\nblack. Till you hardly knew what to believe in, except that, being\nalive, you had to go on trying to make things right.\n\nFor an hour Ed Dukas sat in his room. Nothing more appeared on the\npaper which he had clamped under his microscope. \"_Nipper._\" That\nwas all. Silly name of his childhood. Often he looked around him,\nas though expecting someone to appear. Several times he said softly,\n\"Uncle Mitch, you must be here, someplace....\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nThe muttering tumult in the streets--the shouts, the occasional rush of\nfeet, the curses and yells--masked the arrival of Tom Granger. Ed was\nstartled from his preoccupation to find Granger almost at his elbow.\nWith him was a man who looked like a plain-clothes police official. In\nthe background, grim and frightened, was Ed's mother.\n\n\"Eddie,\" she said. \"If you know anything, tell. Mitch just isn't worth\nany more trouble to us.\"\n\n\"Tell what?\" Ed demanded, rising.\n\n\"About where Mitchell Prell is,\" Granger told him. \"You said things\nwhich hinted that he might be around.\"\n\nEd's throat tightened. It was still a minor shock to remember that the\nprobe beam had probably been used on this house sporadically for years.\nThe refined radar of the probe beam could, if minutely focused, make\nfair pictures of distant things inside walls. But Ed didn't think that\nit could make the small print on a sheet of letter paper readable.\nBut there were instruments that could pick up faint sounds from miles\naway--a voice, for instance--and amplify them to audibility. Ed was\nstill sure that, over distance, his mind itself remained inviolable.\n\nEd felt cornered by the brute forces that always take over whenever\nreason is broken down by fear. Once his uncle had been a scapegoat\nto blame for disaster. Then, poor memories and triumphant years had\nhalf forgiven him. But now, during trouble, he was guilty again. And\naccording to savage concepts of justice so were his relatives.\n\nThe confusion of half blaming his uncle left Ed and was replaced\nby stubborn loyalty. He summoned all his self-control and grinned\ncarefully. He wondered if the fright in Granger's large eyes reflected\nrealization at last of the angry hands, gone completely untrustworthy,\nthat now touched the controls of modern science. Was he getting\nintelligent so late? Or was he afraid of something simpler?\n\nEd forced a laugh. \"You picked up my muttering, Granger,\" he accused.\n\"I wonder what _you_ mutter about, these days? Grant me the same\nprivilege of nervousness under strain which you could do a lot to\nrelieve, everywhere, as I have been begging you to see. No, I don't\nknow where Mitchell Prell is, though I wish I did.\"\n\nThe plain-clothes man had moved over to the table. Now he peered into\nthe microscope. Soon he motioned to Granger to do likewise. Ed felt the\nroots of his hair puckering.\n\n\"What does '_Nipper_' signify to you, Dukas?\" Granger asked at last,\nlevelly.\n\n\"Suppose it's my pet name for you, Granger?\" Ed answered. \"Your friend\ncan take the paper along. The police laboratories might make something\nelse of it. Maybe I doodle with a bum pen and absent-mindedly stick\nthe doodle under a microscope--and right away somebody wants to make a\nstory of it. You want to psyche me? I've humored that kind of whim from\nthe police before. This time, for cussedness, I'll stand on my rights\nand demand that they get a court order before they meddle with my most\nprivate possession, my memory. Especially since hotheads and hysterics\nseem to have taken over. But wait, Granger. I'm sure that sensible\npeople are still in the majority. They haven't reacted very much, yet.\nBut they will--with matters as bad as they are now. Maybe they haven't\nany answers to our problems, except calm and the hope of working\nsomething out. But that's a lot. We were schooled to cautious thinking,\nGranger, and that means something, even though you and plenty of others\ncan lose their wits. Maybe the sensible people will finally shut you\nup!\"\n\n\"We'll take the paper along all right,\" the plain-clothes man said.\n\"And you, too. We already have the court order you mention.\"\n\n\"Dukas,\" Granger said with a show of great patience, \"will you ever\nrealize? We're facing a soulless horror. We must be harsh if need be.\nBut you should be glad to give your absolute co-operation. It's your\nduty. We have always felt that Prell is alive, somewhere. Twice he has\nbeen part of disaster, even if unintentionally. We must stop him before\nhe can bring us greater, unknown dangers.\"\n\nEd eyed this thin, wily man who had managed to assume a certain\nunofficial power in the world. And again Ed had trouble judging him.\nPerhaps he was entirely insincere. Yet he had, too, the marks of\nthe rabid crusader following obsolete themes that needed revision;\nfollowing them blindly, with both a kind of courage and the crassest\nstupidity.\n\n\"Tell me something, Granger,\" Ed said. \"I'm curious. And I know I have\na duty, however different from what you mean. Did you have a hand in\nthe creation of the monsters of vitaplasm? I mean the real monsters,\nnot just the androids, the Phonies. The use of terror is old in war and\npolitics. Stirring up fury, with the blame carefully implied elsewhere.\"\n\nGranger's features stiffened, as if he had been insulted, or perhaps\nhe was just acting. \"I would not dirty my hands with things from hell,\nDukas!\" he snapped. \"Unwise as you are, you must know that! Now I think\nthe police want to take you away.\"\n\nEd's mother stood in the doorway of his room without saying a word. She\nlooked strong, yet bitter and scared. He knew that her loyalty was with\nhim, though her views differed somewhat from his.\n\nHis father must have been out of the house when Granger and the other\nman arrived, Ed thought. Did his going out on this chaotic evening mean\nanything special? Wanting to be loyal, and at least half sure that the\nwish was returned, Ed didn't care to complete the thought.\n\nHe was concerned about his mother, yet he said, \"Try not to worry, Mom.\nGo to bed. They'll have to guard the house. I can still insist on it.\nAnd I don't think I can be held very long, even now.\"\n\n\"Your father will come to you as soon as he knows, Eddie,\" she said.\n\nSo Edward Dukas was carted off to the local bastille. A helmet was\nput on his head. But what was learned from him about the whereabouts\nof Mitchell Prell must have been both confusing and disappointing.\nCertainly, though, it must have intrigued the police, as did that\nsingle name on the paper, which told them nothing under the most\ncareful scrutiny.\n\nBronson, the portly local police chief, introduced Ed to a man named\nCarter Loman, a bullishly handsome character with a mouth like a trap,\na smile to match, and a gimlet scrutiny. A big wheel of some sort, Ed\nassumed. Was there something familiar about him?\n\n\"You'll have to spend the night here, Dukas,\" Loman rumbled.\n\nEd put out the light in his cell, but as he crept into his cot, he held\na bit of paper from his coat pocket in one hand. He left his fountain\npen open, on top of his clothes. For maybe an hour he lay quietly in\nthe dark, listening to the scattered noises of the troubled night. Then\nhe slept.\n\nHe awoke as dawn grayed the east and glanced at once at the paper in\nhis hand, which he had kept outside the blanket. Ed's heart leaped.\nA message had been written. Perhaps it had taken all night to toil\nit out at a creeping pace: \"_Nipper--argue police--you go Port\nSmitty--Mars--at once_.\"\n\nThe final _e_ of _once_ was already written, except that a line of it\nwas still being extended. A little dot of wet ink was still laboring\nacross the paper.\n\nEd had no microscope or pocket lens, but he risked turning on the\nlight. He peered hard. He was not at all sure that he saw anything\nspecial. But imbedded in the dark liquid he thought for an instant that\nhe beheld a suggestion of form--impossible or entirely fantastic. Then\nthe tiny minuscule of ink quivered, and the hint was gone.\n\nEd whispered, so low that he himself could not hear, \"Uncle Mitch. I\nknow that you're around--in some form. I wish I understood what you're\nup to.\"\n\nEd tore the message from the sheet of paper, chewed it to a pulp, and\nspat it on the floor. At least he was destroying concrete evidence that\nmight provoke greater attention than his psyched memories. Of course\nthey would psych him again--that was why they had held him, hoping that\nhe would learn more. But he had learned very little.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe psyching was done. Chief Bronson and Carter Loman knew all that\nhe knew. Now Ed offered his proposition: \"Suppose I got to Mars, as\nMitchell Prell suggests? I seem to be the only man to contact him.\nYou are aware that I myself haven't more than a wild glimmer of where\nthe trail leads. But you know that I'm badly worried about what a\nhuman-and-android conflict can mean, and that I want to break the\ndanger somehow. If you want to find Prell, track me by the best means\nthat you know.\"\n\nChief Bronson nodded, musingly.\n\n\"Hmm-m--very good!\" Carter Loman grunted. \"Of course you would prefer\nto act alone, Dukas, because you are fond of Prell. You offer to\ncombine forces with us only because it is the only way that you can do\nwhat you want to do at all. All right, we agree.\"\n\n\"Tickets and passport will be arranged for immediately,\" Bronson said.\n\"And now there is someone here to see you.\"\n\nIt was Ed's father, angry with him but more angry with the restraint\nunder which his son had been put.\n\n\"Damn it, Eddie, I tried to get to you last night, and they sent me\naway!\" he stormed. \"And what have you been up to? What's this nonsense\nabout a message from Prell? Damn, has everything gone completely crazy?\nI was for this man Granger and his return to rustic simplicities; but\nhe's gone wild, too! Isn't there any way to handle what's happening?\nPhonies, and things from a witch's caldron, but grown to elephant size.\nAnd more of them all the time! Where does it stop?... Well, it helps a\nlittle that lots of people went out last night breaking up fights. Even\nsome Phonies did that, they say; but should we believe it? Scientists\nwere on the run everywhere, as maybe they should be for inventing so\nmuch new trouble. The Schaeffer lab is barricaded. I'm glad for your\nsensible people, Ed, but can they hold the peace for more than a little\nwhile? And would it do any final good if they could?\"\n\nJack Dukas, the \"memory man\" of old-time flesh, was more like a dad\nto Ed again, and Ed was almost as glad for that as he was for the\nawakening of the forces of calm and order.\n\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" Ed said with a cryptic meaning of his own. \"It's a small\nlessening of danger, anyway. It's a fact, though, that the situation,\nat the moment, is an explosive magazine which one well-placed idiot\ncould set off. And it's hard to see how there could ever be less than\nmany. Say that our population is split three ways. Android, human\nand that mixed group which is trying to keep them from each other's\nthroats. It's hard to see how the latter can succeed for very long.\"\n\nFor a moment Ed and Jack Dukas were almost close, in spite of\ndifferences. Ed was a little reassured.\n\n\"I'm going out to Mars, Dad,\" he said. \"With police co-operation. Maybe\nto find my uncle. And--who knows?--maybe even to find some useful\nanswers.\"\n\nJack Dukas shrugged. \"More science, no doubt,\" he said. \"Well, anyway,\ngood luck.\"\n\nThe brief spell of companionship was broken.\n\nFor a moment Ed was tense with the thought of precious time possibly\nwasted, chasing off to the Red Planet, when perhaps he should be\ntrying to hunt down the perpetrators of offenses to a new biology--in\nvitaplasm. He knew that time remained still desperately short, with\nnuclear hell building up. But a choice had been made, and he sensed\nthat it was the best one.\n\nEd and Barbara went to see Les Payten that morning. He lay in a bed,\nhis body encased in an armor of plastic, under which fluids circulated.\nHe had mended enough to listen and speak. Ed partly explained his\nintentions. About them, Les showed a mixture of a sick man's insight\nand weariness: \"I hope we'll see each other again, Ed. And that\nthe world will still be around. And that you won't be changed too\nmuch--strong, weak, big or little. Because I've got things figured out\n_for me_ at last, Ed. Granger is right, as far as I am concerned. I was\na romantic kid, but now I've had enough! The stars are still farther\nout of reach than we realize. Got to fight the murdering Phonies and\nall of the vitaplasm menace, no matter what. Because there never was a\nmenace like it--not to me.\" Les grinned wanly. \"So long, pals.\"\n\nIn a park, some hours later, Barbara and Ed walked in the beautiful\ndusk, while the arch of silvery murk that had been Luna masked a few\nof the first stars. Something with long webbed wings was visible in\nsilhouette against it for an instant--another creature that never\nexisted before. It added a chill to their low mood. Ed was thinking\nthat he must say goodbye to Barbara, too, very soon, and to all the\nchaotic wonder and charm that was Earth. Earth maybe in its last days.\n\nBarbara said, \"I wish I were going along, Eddie.\"\n\n\"So do I. Babs, go out to the asteroids. Like my mother. It's safer\nthere.\"\n\n\"I _meant_ my wish, Ed,\" Barbara protested earnestly. \"Of course, a\ngirl is still sometimes rated as a nuisance that a man has to take\nextra pains to look after--no companion for one to concentrate on the\ndangers ahead. Maybe it's true.\"\n\nHe looked at her sharply and gulped hard. But gay little bells seemed\nto tinkle in his head. \"Maybe a lot of things,\" he commented. \"But I\nthink you, as much as anybody, know what we're up against. Possible\ndeath, of course, which could be permanent. Or some fantastic loss or\nchange of identity. How can we guess just what? If you can take all\nthat mystery and hardship, too--well, I won't say no. Maybe if you were\nMrs. Ed Dukas we could have Bronson provide your tickets to Mars.\"\n\nHer smile came out, like the sun. \"You're heartlessly matter-of-fact\nand unromantic, Ed,\" she told him.\n\nHe drew her into the shadow of a tree. A couple of minutes later, when\nhe released her, they both looked dazed--as though, crazy as life was,\nit still could be heaven. She was beautiful. He'd never seen anyone so\nbeautiful.\n\nFifteen hours later they were aboard the _Moon Dust_.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nAs the ship rose on its column of fire some of the old love of distance\nand enigma came back to Ed. There was also a sense of adventurous\nescape, like that of city workers of centuries ago, when, chucking\nbusiness and office routines, they had rushed to the country on\nweekends to regain a little of primitive nature while they scorched a\nsteak over a smoky fire in the woods.\n\nOn the _Moon Dust_ there were more women and children than men:\nrefugees from danger. But would old Mars be much safer? Didn't it now\nbelong to the same human civilization, with its dark undercurrents?\n\nThe Dukases were smoothly hurled across the vast trajectory to Mars.\nThey landed at a high south-temperate latitude, not far below the\nfarthest extent limit of the polar cap; though now, in summer, it had\ndwindled to a mere cake of deep hoarfrost a few hundred miles across\nand on high ground. Around this remnant stretched a yellow plain made\nup of crusting mud, swiftly drying lakes scummed with the Martian\nequivalent of green algae, and white patches of ancient-sea salt and\nalkali.\n\nBut Port Smitty itself was in a wide, shallow valley, or \"canal,\" a bit\nfarther north. Its many airdomes, necessary to maintain an atmosphere\ndense enough and sufficiently oxygenated to sustain human life, loomed\namong vast greenhouses and thickets of tattered, dry-leaved plants. The\ncentral dome was topped by a statue of old Porter Smith, this region's\nfirst human inhabitant; he was still alive but long gone from the Mars\nhe had loved. For he had associated himself with the building of star\nships.\n\nPort Smitty already boasted a population of half a million. And there\nwere other cities of almost equal size. On Mars, many of the first\nrejuvenated had settled. And many colonists of every sort had come\nthere since.\n\nOn the rusty bluff overlooking the city were the remains of a far\nolder metropolis--towers, domes and strange nameless structures for\nwhich anything manlike could have no use. Fifty million years ago the\nMartians, like the people of the Asteroid Planet, had been wiped out in\nwar.\n\nEd Dukas and his bride rode by tube train from the flame-blasted\nspaceport to the city. Their hotel room overlooked a courtyard lush\nwith earthly palms and flowers. Birds twittered and flitted from branch\nto poppy bloom. From somewhere in the hotel came dance music.\n\nTheir room was supposed to be energy-shielded, but Ed remained\ncautious. He merely left his penpoint bared in his coat pocket, with\nthe envelope of an old letter. He had already told Barbara all he knew\nabout Uncle Mitch's message and had added some wild guesses. So now she\ngave her husband a smile of understanding as he hung his coat carefully\non a chair. Then she came into his arms.\n\nLater that evening, dancing, they covered their wariness carefully.\nThey might be under observation in any of a hundred different ways: by\nprobe beams, hidden cameras, or by individuals, android or human, whom\nthey did not know. In spite of old loyalty, Ed Dukas was not entirely\nat ease with the thought of contacting Mitchell Prell. Yet, he wished\nto avoid being trailed so that he could act alone and separate from\nthe dictatorial and often panic-stricken opinions of others.\n\nOn Mars there had been considerable violence, too, though there had\nbeen no gliding, sinuous things that brought nocturnal terror. But\nhere, too, there was a mingling of android and human being, with no\nvisible marks to distinguish the one from the other, though to many the\ndifference was as great as that between man and werewolf.\n\nBarbara seemed to grow sleepy in Ed's arms as they danced. Ed yawned\nslightly. So they drifted from the room and back to their own quarters.\n\nEd pulled the old envelope from the pocket of the coat on the chair.\nAs he had hoped, a message was traced waveringly on it: \"_Go Port\nKarnak--then E.S.E. into desert._\"\n\nBoth Ed and his wife knew that Martian deserts surpassed all earthly\nconceptions of desolation. They looked at each other. The challenge was\nstill in Barbara's eyes. The fact that she could carry a pack was a\nmatter that had been settled long ago.\n\nNow Ed risked speaking--in the lowest of audible whispers: \"So,\ninstead of going to bed, as people in our position should, we start\ntraveling--fast.\"\n\nHe felt the safety pouch under his belt. Personal recordings were in\nit: tiny cylinders, a pair for each of them. A precaution. In the\nvaults on Earth there should still be others. But one could not always\nbe sure of those. Some had disappeared.\n\nAs memory of what he thought he had seen in a tiny ink drop still\nclutched rather frighteningly at Ed Dukas's brain. It was a hint of\nhow Mitchell Prell wrote his messages--in an utterly simple and heroic\nway, but with fantastic, dream-shot implications. Could it be part of\nandroid flexibility? Well, probably his fancy had tricked him, because\nthings couldn't be that odd. Still....\n\nOften Ed had felt bitter over the confusions created by the advance of\nscience. But now enigmas led him on as thrillingly as ever. There had\nto be wonders ahead, for thinking of Mitchell Prell without thinking of\nnew science was impossible.\n\n\"Let's go, Babs,\" he whispered.\n\nCasually, like ordinary guests checking out, they put two light valises\ninto the conveyer and dropped to the main floor by elevator. The rest\nof their stuff they left behind. They paid their bill and took an auto\ncab to the central tube station. In the washrooms they changed from\nleisure clothes to the rough gear used in the Martian wilderness:\nlight-weight vacuum armor and oxygen helmets equipped with air\npurifiers and small radios--all fitted over light trousers and shirts.\nThe remaining contents of their discarded valises they transferred to\nrucksacks.\n\nIn the station they mingled with farmers, miners and homesteaders.\nCouples such as themselves were common on Mars; they were going out to\nmake their fortunes.\n\nThey bought their tickets to Port Karnak. Ed and Barbara looked around\nthem. A half-dozen men among the waiting passengers wore no oxygen\nhelmets. True, this underground depot was pressurized, but the outer\nthinness and oxygen-poverty of the Martian air had to be prepared for.\nThe absence of helmets, then, almost had to be the mark of the android.\nTo keep its vital processes going, the versatile vigor of vitaplasm\nmerely disintegrated a tiny bit of its atomic substance, to make up for\nthe shortage of chemical energy.\n\nEd and Barbara boarded the train with the crowd. Much of this\nunderground system of transportation had merely been converted to human\nbeings' use from that which had remained from the ancient culture\nof Mars. Behind the projectilelike coaches, close fitting in the\ntubes, air-pressure built up. Acceleration was swift. Covering the\nthousand-mile distance to Port Karnak took twenty minutes.\n\nOnce arrived, Ed bought the additional equipment they needed; then in\na small restaurant they ate a last civilized meal. They took an auto\nbus out along a glassed-in, pressurized causeway and descended at the\nfinal stop, beside a few scattered greenhouses, the outermost of which\nprovided the city with fresh, earthly vegetables.\n\nHere the desert was at hand, utterly frigid at night, under the\nsplinters of stars. Deimos, the farther moon, hung almost stationary\nin the north. Irregular in shape, it looked like a speck of broken\nchinaware, just big enough to make its form discernible. Probably it\nwas a small asteroid which the gravity of Mars had captured.\n\nThe Dukases began to plod. The desert came under their boots, and the\nsolidity of the ground gave way, gradually, to a difficult fluffiness,\nlike that of dry flour. It was millions of square miles of dust the\ncolor of rusted iron, which, in part, it was. Dust, ground to ultimate\nfineness by eons of thin, swift wind. Under the dim light of the sky,\ncolors dropped in tone to a monotonous grayness that only faintly\nrevealed the nearest dunes, and showed plumes of soil moving on the\nwind like ghosts. The dust made a constant, sleepy soughing against\ntheir helmets, like an invitation to death.\n\nBarbara pressed Ed's gloved hand, as if in reassurance, and he pressed\nhers in return. Maybe they had eluded all pursuit or probe-beam\ntracking. Certainly the blowing dust itself would be an effective\nscreen against the most refined radar device. Yet to vanish from the\nview of men could mean another kind of danger. It came to Ed that even\nwhen Mars had teemed with millions of its own inhabitants, perhaps no\none had trod within a mile of where he and his wife were now walking.\n\nThe Dukases marched on for an hour without saying anything. But during\na momentary rest Barbara gripped Ed's arm, thus establishing a firm\nsonic channel, so that they could talk without using their helmet\nradios, which might betray them.\n\n\"I hope we're not too crazy, Ed,\" she said. \"Going out into a\nwilderness like this, on the basis of a couple of strange notes, and\nwith blind faith that somehow we'll be guided. I hope; I hope!\"\n\nHer tone was light and courageous, and he was more than ever glad.\n\n\"Think of our muddled home world, and make that a prayer,\" Ed said. \"We\nmight be doing something to help.\"\n\nSo they kept up their march through the night and into the weirdly\nbeautiful dawn. The desert was rusty dun. The sky was deep, hard blue.\nThe dunes were dust-plumed waves, in which a footprint was quickly\nlost. The rocks were wind-carven spires. Earth was the bluish morning\nstar. It looked very peaceful, denying the need for haste. Its ring was\na nebulous blur.\n\nBarbara and Ed sucked water into their mouths through the tubes which\nled back from their helmets to the large canteens in their rucksacks.\nThey swallowed anti-fatigue and food tablets. For a moment they even\nremoved their oxygen helmets. There was no great harm in that; only\nthe distention of blood vessels under swiftly lowered air pressure and\nan ache and ringing of eardrums, and of course the stinging dryness of\nthe Martian cold against their cheeks. Forty-eight degrees Fahrenheit,\nbelow zero, it was just then.\n\n\"No more clowning,\" Ed said as they replaced their helmets. \"We might\nget dazed by oxygen starvation and forget what we're doing.\"\n\nThey kept up their march, through the morning, past the almost warm\nMartian noon, and on into the frosty chill that came long before\nsunset. They were still plodding on when it was dawn once more. In\nspite of anti-fatigue capsules, they were getting pretty groggy.\n\nIn his breast pouch Ed had his pen and the envelope on which the latest\nmessage from Mitchell Prell had been inked. Now, surely, there had been\ntime enough. So he ventured to disturb the writing materials. There\nwere more words on the envelope: \"_True on course--keep moving_.\"\n\nSo they continued to follow the pointer of their small gyrocompass, set\nto stab precisely toward east-southeast. Ed no longer questioned an odd\nmiracle. It was simply there, and he was grateful.\n\nAn hour later Barbara glimpsed fluttering movement near by: a fleck\nof bright yellow. Then it was gone behind a large chip of stone. Then\nit appeared again. Ed saw it, too, for an instant. It fluttered, it\nchirped plaintively. It was an impossibility in the wastelands of Mars,\nor anywhere else on the Red Planet, outside of an air-conditioned cage.\nIt was a small, earthly bird. A canary.\n\nBarbara stared at it. Her blue eyes were bloodshot and scared. The\ntired droop of her cheeks deepened.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said rather lamely. \"I think that fatigue is about to\nget the better of us.\"\n\n\"Think again,\" Ed said.\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" she answered. \"Even without vitaplasm, it's\nnot much of a stunt to give a guided missile or a spy-robot the form\nof a little bird, with television eyes. And a Midas Touch weapon, or\nsomething equally unpleasant, built into it. At the hotel in Port\nSmitty, it was unrecognizable among the other caged canaries. Here,\nthough, it's unmistakably identified. Which means that whoever is\nguiding it--the police looking for your Uncle Mitch or friends of\nGranger's, or whoever else--don't care any more that we know what it\nis. We're helpless now--they think.\"\n\nA dull fury came to Ed Dukas. He might have guessed that all chances\nof their eluding surveillance would have been countered carefully.\nThis birdlike mechanism must have followed them all the way from Port\nSmitty, keeping just out of sight.\n\nThen a more hopeful idea hit him. But reason conquered it. \"No,\"\nhe said aloud, gripping Barbara's shoulder so that she could hear.\n\"If the pseudo-canary was Uncle Mitch's guide for us, it would have\nrevealed itself sooner, and the messages on paper would not have been\nnecessary.\"\n\nIn a flash Ed drew his own Midas Touch and fired it at the place among\nthe broken rocks where the canary had just vanished. At a little\ndistance there was the usual spurt of incandescence, fringed now with\nred dust. But from the projecting boulders near its base, a small\nyellow form spurted with a faint and musical twitter of mockery. Then\na heavy voice spoke--one which neither Ed nor Barbara recognized just\nthen:\n\n\"Better luck next time, robot lovers. Lead on!\"\n\nThereafter, the false canary was careful not to show itself. And Ed was\nleft with his frustrated anger, and with other uncertain thoughts. What\nif the written messages had not come from Mitchell Prell at all, but\nfrom someone else with an unknown purpose? Or, what if they were from\nUncle Mitch, but had been prepared long ago and left to be presented to\nhim, Ed Dukas, by means of some mechanical agent? What if--well--many\nthings.\n\nUsing his tiny portable radar unit to locate the bird drew only a\nblank. Perhaps the little mechanism with a radio speaker for a voice\nwas effectively shielded against such detection, even at short range.\n\nTo attempt evasive action would be a waste of time and waning energy.\nThere was nothing to do but go on, see what developed, and trust to\nluck. There was the certainty that real pursuit would come, but what\nshape it would take remained unknown.\n\nAs Ed and Barbara plodded on through the day, their minds became fuzzy\nwith weariness. Once, in a kind of retreat from present harsh facts,\nEd's thoughts touched a vivid daydream that he'd had before, of a\nplanet of some star. He looked down at imaginary dry ground under\nimaginary feet and saw that each pebble under the strange, brilliant\nsunshine had a little hole in it. And something shaped like a cross,\nwith four rough, brownish-gray arms that could bend in any direction,\nscrabbled away, flat against the soil, its equipment glinting. The\nthickets all around were stranger than those of Mars.\n\nYes, it was just a daydream, originating from within himself, like an\nold, half-buried hope of some distant exploration. He wondered if it\ncould ever still have any fulfillment, or if that even mattered any\nmore? Perhaps, for all he knew, his wife and he were now headed for an\neven stranger region.\n\nEd shook his head to clear it. He did not want to disturb the envelope\nin his pouch too often. To expose the ink to the dried-out Martian air,\nwhile the writing was in progress at hour-hand speed, might spoil a\nvital message. But at last he chanced it. It seemed that the writer was\nnot much troubled by the presence of the bird-thing or what it might\nmean.\n\nBarbara and Ed read avidly: \"_Base of capped granite rock before you.\nLab._\"\n\nBarbara nodded toward a formation which loomed a half mile ahead in\nthe freezing cold of late afternoon. The slab, balanced crosswise on a\nslender pinnacle, identified it beyond doubt, though there were other\nsimilar spires around it. It cast its shadow on the sunlit dunes. Or\nwas all of that dark, irregular patch shadow?\n\nEd Dukas and his bride had not enjoyed the luxury of natural sleep\nfor a long time. But summoning their flagging strength, they hurried\nforward. Ed felt that at last he was approaching the solution of\nten-year-old enigmas.\n\nThe darker area at one side of the capped rock was not all shadow.\nBut the Dukases had scant attention for the bluish masses of plushy\nstuff that grew in this aridity. At another time it might have been\nfascinating, for it was vegetation related to the android as moss is\nrelated to a man. It was a growth of vitaplasm--another of Mitchell\nPrell's experiments. But Ed and Barbara had no chance to ponder this.\n\nThey located an eighteen-inch cleft at the rock's base. Edging into it,\nthey found an irregular stone pivoted on steel hinges. To their touch,\nit closed behind them, and bolts clicked. From the outside now the\noutline of the door would seem merely a pattern of natural cracks in\nthe granite pinnacle.\n\nAtomic battery lamps lighted the passage, and there were more heavy\ndoors, some of them of steel, for Ed and Barbara to bolt behind them.\nThe place was like a small, secret fortress. At the bottom of a spiral\nstair, beyond a small airlock, was Mitchell Prell's latest and perhaps\nlast workshop.\n\nHe must have blasted it from the crust of Mars without help. It was\na series of a half-dozen rooms and was no larger than a fair-sized\napartment. Smallest of all was the combined sleeping room and\nkitchen; and there the evidence of months or perhaps years of absence\nwas plainest. The bunk was thick with dust, and food remnants were\nblackened on unwashed plates. The air, of earthy density, smelled of\ndecay and a strange pungence. The floors and walls were crusted with\npatches of the tough, bluish growths seen outside. It was suggestive\nat once of both fungus and moss but was really like neither. It had a\npretty color under the lamps, which had certainly been burning for a\nlong time.\n\nEd and Barbara removed their oxygen helmets and began a swift\nexploration of the premises. The rooms had all the marks of lone\nbachelor occupancy by a man too fearfully busy with his own\ndeep pursuits to waste time on more than the barest attempts at\nhousekeeping. Apparatus was everywhere. There were even recognizable\nparts of a helicopter--the one, no doubt, which had brought Prell and\nhis equipment to this refuge.\n\nAt first they thought that he might since have fallen victim to some\nviolence or accident. And then they found his body in a rectangular,\nplastic-covered tank, submerged in a cloudy, viscous fluid. It was a\nstandard sort of vat, much used in laboratories in repairing extensive\ninjury and restoring a destroyed body from a personal recording--either\nin protoplasm or vitaplasm. Near by, there were three similar vats,\nwhich, when opened, proved to contain only fluid.\n\nBarbara and Ed looked for a long moment at Mitchell Prell's forever\nyoung face. It was peaceful in death that was not quite death; for of\nthe latter you could never be sure any longer, unless it was the death\nof the species.\n\nIf there were guile behind that gentle face, it did not show. If there\nwere darkness of purpose, or stubborn unwillingness to recognize errors\nthat he had committed in a civilization that tottered as it reached\nfor greatness, it could not be seen. But in this refuge, one fact was\nplain: Mitchell Prell had gone on with his work in a super-biology.\n\nEd wandered over to a beautiful microscope of a standard make. Its\nattachments also started out from a familiar design. It was fitted with\ndozens of special screws and levers. When Ed, and then Barbara, peered\ninto its eye-piece, they found that each of these screws and levers\ncould manipulate a tiny tool, almost too small to see with the naked\neye. There were minute cutters, calipers and burnishing wheels. Set up\nunder the microscope there was even what seemed to be a tiny lathe. In\nfact, there was an entire machine shop on an ultra-miniature scale. And\nthere were tiny, tonglike grasping members, intended to serve--on such\na reduced scheme of things--as hands, where the human hand, working\ndirectly, would have been hopelessly mountainous.\n\nIn addition to this equipment, there were exact duplicates of the vats\nacross the room and their attendant apparatus, except that each entire\nassembly was less than a half-inch long. In one vat there was a human\nfigure much smaller than a doll, yet perfect.\n\nBarbara laughed nervously. Even in this century of wonders, the human\nmind had its limitations for making swift adjustments. The laugh was a\ndenial of what her eyes beheld.\n\nEd Dukas's wide face looked at once avid and haggard. Beside the tiny\nvats there was also another microscope, complete in every detail, yet\nof the same relative dimensions as the little figure in the vat. But\nthis lesser microscope was of the electron variety. It had to be. For\nat this reduced size light waves themselves were too coarse in texture\nto be effective for close-range work.\n\nEd turned slowly toward his young wife, whose eyes were alert and\nwonder-filled in spite of her weariness. He noticed the pleasant wave\nin her hair. He noted the charming curve of her brow, the tiny and\npleasing irregularity of her nose. And what was all this attention but\na clinging to an object of love when facing a strangeness so great that\nit scared him as he had never been scared before. Ed Dukas knew that\nhis face must have gone gray.\n\nNow his words came slowly and precisely: \"Babs, I've told you that I\nwatched part of Mitchell Prell's first message being written. That in\nthe moving speck of wet ink, for an instant something looked like a man\nthe size of a mote! I thought I'd imagined it. But is that what Uncle\nMitch is now? An android so small that the only way for him to write a\nnote to a person of usual dimensions is to surround his own body with a\ndroplet of ink and to drag himself across the paper, making the lines\nand loops of script?\"\n\nBarbara looked at him obliquely, doubting his seriousness.\n\n\"Aw, now, Eddie-boy, take it a little bit easy,\" she said. \"Please do.\"\n\nHe didn't answer her. He let his unchanging expression and many seconds\nof silence do the answering for him. His pulses drummed in his ears.\n\nAt last he said, \"No, darling, I mean it. There's no reason why an\nandroid no bigger than the smallest insects can't exist. And the signs\nof what Mitchell Prell did in this laboratory are plain enough.\n\n\"Working at first with the larger microscope and the miniature tools\nand machinery under it, he duplicated a now common kind of biological\napparatus in half-inch size. In its tank he caused to grow the\nsimulacrum of himself that you can see. Aside from the difference in\ndimensions, that much has been both possible and fairly common practice\nfor years. Its brain having been stamped with all phases of his\nmemory and personality, it became him when it awoke. His own body he\nleft inert and preserved in the large vat. But he was not finished.\nHe had made just one step toward the degree of smallness that he\nwanted to reach. So he started over from scratch, constructing first\nanother microscope and then relatively minute machinery and tools,\nfine beyond our sight. Under that tiny electron microscope I'll bet\nthere's another, smaller machine shop, and a smaller tank from which a\nmote-sized Mitchell Prell emerged. It must all have been quite a job.\nIt's not hard to see where those ten years went.\"\n\nBarbara was silent for a long time. Finally, she said, \"It sounds\nreasonable--superficially. But still, is it possible? Consider a brain.\nIt can come in many sizes, from an ant's to a human being's. But all\nare made of molecules of the same dimensions. And it has been pretty\nwell determined that a brain must be always about as big as a human\nbeing's to be truly intelligent. Trying to cram such intelligence\ninto a smaller lump of gray matter--composed of the familiar\nmolecules--would be like trying to weave fine cloth out of rope. How\ncan you get around that, Ed?\"\n\n\"Maybe I can guess,\" he said. \"With smaller units. How about the\nelectron, Babs? Far smaller than the molecule, certainly. And it's been\nthe soul of the best calculators--thought machines--for a couple of\ncenturies. There isn't any doubt that a brain of microscopic size could\nfunction by far finer electronic patterning. No, it probably wouldn't\nwork in natural protoplasm. But we already know the flexibility of\nvitaplasm: easy to redesign, capable of drawing its energy even from a\nnuclear source. Well, you figure it out. What have we here but other\nandroid advantages? I think my uncle once told me that he meant to go\nwhere no one could go exactly as a human being.\"\n\n\"All right, Eddie,\" she conceded. \"I guess I'm persuaded. Proud girl,\nme. I've got a smart boyfriend. And your uncle--he skips blithely\nfrom the bigness of the interstellar regions in his thoughts to\nthe smallness of dust! And he seems, _actually_, to have done the\nlatter--in person! Is that what we're supposed to accept as truth? If\nso, he must have been with you all the time, or at least for quite a\nwhile. On Earth, even. And he must have come out to Mars with us. He\nwas right in your pocket, riding with the paper and pen. To write, he\nmust have gunked himself up good with the ink inside the pen point.\nUgh--what a thought! And maybe he's still in your pocket right now.\nHe--or a tremendously shrunken equivalent of him. Does all this stack\nup right in your eyes, Ed?\" A pallor had crept through Barbara's tan.\n\n\"Pretty much so,\" Ed replied heavily.\n\n\"So what do we do now, Ed? Try to follow your uncle's path--down?\"\n\nEd's flesh tingled. To follow Mitchell Prell _down_--a course more\nweirdly remote than traveling to the stars. He did not answer Barbara.\nHe unzipped his pocket. He could not tell whether a minute android\nemerged or not. There were no further messages on the envelope.\n\nBut from a sound cone in a shadowy corner of this workshop, there\nsuddenly came tones that a decade had not rubbed from his memory:\n\n\"Nipper-hello! Or is it always Ed now? So we've come to Mars together.\nAnd you with Barbara! Well, maybe that is an agreeable complication!\nNow we can talk. Here I have the right amplifying apparatus. I need\nhelp, and you always seemed the best--and enough like me. I know\nyour doubts about science, and I don't blame you. But I'm still the\nsame--wanting to learn everything that I can, feeling that everything\nshould work out right.\"\n\nThe stillness closed in again. Ed and Barbara looked at each other.\nTechnology was full of tricks--the possibility of a thousand illusions.\nCould he even trust a voice, made so like Mitchell Prell's used to be?\nAnd could he trust the mind behind it? Even if it truly was his uncle's?\n\n\"Work out right!\" Ed growled mockingly. \"That sounds almost pious!\nIf you are what you say you are, you were on Earth and have seen\neverything. You know then how right things have been! I was around when\nthe Moon blew--remember? And no scared hotheads caused that. But there\nare plenty of them now. And from here on Mars, I've expected to see\nEarth momentarily puff up into a little nova.\"\n\nThere was a sigh from the sound cone. \"So I'm to blame--at least\npartly--for helping to give those fools something to be furiously\nright or mistaken about,\" Mitchell Prell's voice replied. \"Well, I was\nwhat I was, and I am what I am, Ed. I'm sorry about many things that\nhappened. But I can't erase them. I've urged you to come here to help\nme try to counteract them. I don't think you'll stay angry with me, Ed.\nCome where I am--you and Barbara. It can be done quite quickly now. I\nhave two forms prepared. They will take the lines and personalities\nof anyone. Just set the dials above two of the unoccupied vats at one\nhundred--full energy. Lower yourselves into the fluid. Clothes, or\nlack of them, won't matter. Your own bodies will sink into suspended\nanimation.\"\n\nAgain the voice from the sound cone faded out. Ed's and Barbara's\neyes met in a tense congress of thought. They were being asked to\nleave their natural, physical selves behind and to become beings of\nvitaplasm. To many, that was horror in itself, even without a radical\nchange in size. Then there was the fear of loss of identity. To be an\nexact duplicate in mind and memory might not necessarily mean to be\nthe same person. Here was a metaphysical problem elusive and hard to\nanswer. What others of experience might have told you could never quite\nsatisfy you. You had to learn for yourself.\n\nBeyond all that, there was that drop, down and down into tininess, to\nwhere physical laws themselves must seem warped by the relativity of\nsize levels, and to where nothing remained quite the same. Could one's\nmind even endure the difference?\n\nFor a moment Ed felt cornered and panicky. But something eager and\nquestioning came into him. For the first time he wished that Barbara\nhad not come with him.\n\nFinally he said, \"I've got to go down, Babs. There just isn't any other\nway.\"\n\n\"What's sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose, Ed,\" she said.\n\"With us, that was settled a while ago.\"\n\nHe didn't protest. She was resourceful. She'd be a help, not a trouble.\nAnd he knew that love of adventure was as strong in her as in himself.\nSo the decision was made.\n\nSuddenly they heard a distant clink and hammering. Metal against stone.\nThe canary had followed them to Mitchell Prell's underground fortress.\nAnd of course the little mechanism had been merely a scout for some\nlarger party farther to the rear.\n\nAgain the words came from the sound cone, but in a whisper, \"I\nwas pretty sure you'd be followed, Ed. But we should still have\nconsiderable time. It'll be hard for them to break into here--without\ndestroying everything. And I think they'll want to see what I've got.\"\n\nEd Dukas had never before considered his brilliant tireless uncle in\nany way impractical. But now he was sensing a certain inadequacy and\nfelt that Mitchell Prell truly needed him. If it was Mitchell Prell,\nof course--if the voice itself wasn't a trick. But now Ed was at least\nmore confident that he was not being fooled. What doubt remained had to\nbe part of many calculated risks.\n\n\"All right, Uncle Mitch,\" he said.\n\nBarbara smiled at him rather wanly, but her eyes held a glint. He\nkissed her.\n\n\"So here goes, eh, Eddie?\" she said.\n\n\"Be seein' yuh, sweetheart,\" he said, taking her in his arms.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nStripped of their boots and vacuum armor, they set the controls and\nlowered themselves into the gelatinous contents of the tanks. A warm,\ntingling numbness flowed into them at contact with the viscous,\nenergized fluid. Weariness stabbed into their muscles. Their knees\nbuckled, and they sank deeper into the gelatin.\n\n\"All okay, Babs?\" he asked.\n\n\"Okay, Ed.\"\n\nThen their faces went under that surface. Their minds numbed and were\nblotted out. They no longer needed to breathe.\n\nThe journey downward into a smaller, or, in a sense, a vaster region,\nwas made without their awareness, in a single step. There was no need\nto pause at middle size, represented by the tiny but easily visible\ndoll-like figure in the minute tank. Mitchell Prell's labors in two\nsize levels need not be done again, for that work was finished. The\ndirect path was prepared. There was a flow of impulses, like that of\nthe old-time transmission of photographs over wires. Gelatins already\nroughly of human form responded, swirled and moved tediously, and took\nsharper shape, in a still-smaller vat. And it was the same with the\nbrains meant to harbor mind, memory and personality. They also were\nrepeated in a finer medium, and by a different principle than their\noriginals--but nonetheless repeated. So, in slightly more than an hour,\nthe essences of two human beings were re-created in the dimensions of\nmotes of dust.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAwareness returned gradually to Ed. At first it was like a blur of\ndreams, out of which came realization of a successful transformation,\nand of where he must be. Panic followed, but briefly. He was struggling\nviolently in a thick, gluey substance. His entire body, even his face,\nwas imbedded in it. He was certain that he would smother--yet the\nimpulse to breathe was subdued.\n\nFighting the sticky stuff, he knew that he possessed great\nstrength--relatively. Some of this was the android power in him.\nPerhaps more of it was the increased relative toughness of everything,\nin lesser size. An ant was relatively stronger than a man--a phenomenon\nof smaller dimensions. And here, even a gelatinous fluid seemed like\nheavy glue, its molecular chains long and tough. Water itself, not\nlying flat, but beading into dewdrops, would have seemed almost as\nsticky.\n\nEd Dukas, or his tiny likeness, got clear of the vat and its contents,\nthough much of the latter still clung to him. On all fours he dragged\nit with him, leaving a trail of it in his wake on a rough, glassy\nsurface. He kept spiraling around and around until he rid himself of\nmost of the gelatin.\n\nWith avidness and wonder and dread, his mind scrambled through a moment\nof time to grasp the truths of his present state and to test them. Even\nthe act of _existing_ in the body he now inhabited was indescribably\ndifferent. His mouth was almost dry inside. He still could draw air\ninto his nostrils, but breathing became unnecessary before some source\nof energy that was probably nuclear. His hands and his nude body still\nlooked slender and brown to him. And he retained memories--of people\nhe knew, sights he had seen, and of things he had learned. Here he\nseemed to remain himself. Those memories were clear enough; but were\nthey already losing a little importance, were they too gigantic to be\nconcerned about in this place?\n\nThat thought, again, was panic at work--a sense of separation from\nall that he held familiar. For the ato lamp towering over him seemed\nas remote as the sun. The form of the less-than-miniature electron\nmicroscope seemed a metal-sheened tower. And in his mind there was\neven the certainty that his present form must be of a wholly different\ndesign inside to meet different conditions. He knew that he could\nfeel the thump of a heavier heart, circulating relatively more viscous\nfluids.\n\nAnd something about his vision had changed. Close by, everything was\nslightly blurred, as if he were far-sighted. Farther off, objects\nbecame hazed, as by countless drifting, speeding dots that weren't\nopaque but that seemed--each of them--to be surrounded by refractive\nrings that distorted the view of what lay beyond them. And because\nthere were so many tiny centers of distortion constantly in motion,\nvision at this middle-distance never quite cleared but remained\nashimmer. Were those translucent specks perhaps the auras of air\nmolecules themselves?\n\nAt a greater distance, clarity came again. For there the haze which\nwas not haze at all but which consisted merely of seeing too much\ndetail--in too coarse a grain, as under too much magnification--was\nlost. Light and dark, and familiar rich colors. And he saw the whole\nroom around him almost as he used to see it, except for its limitless\nvastness.\n\nFor a little while Ed wondered further about his new eyes. They were\nresponsive to familiar wave lengths of light. Those wave lengths were\nnot too coarse--at least when reflected from farther objects. For\nnearer things, he was not at all sure that he could see even as well as\nhe could by ordinary light. Was his vision, in this segment, perhaps\nelectronic, then? Did he see, close at hand, fringed hints of strange,\nbeautiful hues? Were these electronic colors? Or were there infinitely\nfiner natural wave lengths, far above the known spectrum, which\ntoo-massive instruments had been unable to detect?\n\nThis question was dropped quickly, because there was too much more.\nNow he looked again, very briefly, out into the depths of air, full\nof drifting debris--jagged stones that glinted, showing a crystalline\nstructure, twisted masses like the roots of trees, though they had the\nsheen of floss. All of it was dust of one kind or another. Ed could\neven hear the clink and rattle as bits of it collided. Everywhere\nthere were murmurings of sound, which made a constant, elfin ringing\nnever heard in the world he knew.\n\nGingerly now he crept across the rough glass surface, back toward\nthe vat from which he had emerged and its companion. Barbara was his\nfirst concern. There she was, in the second vat, imbedded in a bead of\ngelatin. Already she was trying to fight free. He reached both arms\ninto the stuff and tugged at her shoulders to help her. He lifted\nher out easily and helped scrape away the adhering gelatin, while he\nworried about how she might react to a tremendous change. To counteract\nthe shock of it, he kept up a running flow of talk, in a voice that\neven seemed a little as it used to be:\n\n\"... We made it, Babs. Down to rock bottom, you might say. I don't\nthink that any conscious human shape could be made much smaller. Or\nany machine, for that matter. Remember some old stories? Little men\nlost in weed jungles, fighting spiders and things? Strange, unheard-of\nadventure, in those days! Maybe we can even try it sometime. Except\nthat a spider, or even an aphid, wouldn't notice us. We're too small.\"\n\nA little pink nymph with a rather determined jaw, she seemed only half\nto listen as she stared around with large eyes.\n\nLater, like two savages, they were clothing themselves crudely in\nscraps of lint torn from what looked like a sleeping pallet. A fiber\nwas knotted across it in a way that reminded Ed of the safety straps by\nwhich passengers of planes and space ships attached themselves to their\nseats during take-offs and landings. Here, Prell, the tiny android,\nmust take his rare moments of rest. Some of the lint was far finer than\nspiderweb, but it was still coarse to Ed and his wife in their present\nstate, as they wound its strands around them.\n\n\"You look beautiful, darling,\" he said. \"You're just as you were.\"\n\nBarbara smiled slightly. \"Even here I'm vain enough to respond to\ncompliments, Eddie,\" she answered. \"Where's Prell?\"\n\nHer voice was a thin thread in the keening murmur of sounds. And it\nwas worried. Ed and Barbara both craved the reassuring presence of\nsomeone of experience here, where everything was changed--where minute\ngusts of air seemed bent on hurling you upward, so that you would float\nhelplessly, like a mote. You stood up gingerly, meaning to try walking\na step. But that mode of locomotion seemed not only unsafe here but\nimpractical. You could be swept away, and in the vastness all around,\nhow could one mote find another again? Too much of what you were used\nto was lost already. Even the habit of walking no longer functioned\nproperly. The air was a buoyant, resisting substance, a prickling\npresence of individually palpable molecular impacts, and there was\nlittle traction for one's feet. Perhaps, then, here you swam in the air.\n\nEd spoke at last: \"My uncle can't be far away. He'll come to us. It's\nbeen only a moment.\"\n\nBarbara clung to him, afraid. \"Eddie, am I me anymore? Can I even find\nold ways of talking, and old subjects to talk about? Here? Everything\nseems too different. Damn--I never could accept the idea of there being\ntwo of anyone! Us up in those other tanks--giants asleep. And yet us\nhere! Maybe we're different already--shaped by other surroundings! And\nremember how little we are and how helpless. Moving a couple of inches\nwould be like walking a mile. And we came here to see if we could find\na way to straighten out the giant affairs at home. We're _androids_\nnow, aren't we? A special kind. But we still have the capacity for the\nold emotions. Damn it again, Eddie, everything around us in this place\nis so strange. But it's beautiful, too.\"\n\nHe patted her shoulder and said nothing. But her thoughts paralleled\nhis own.\n\nSuddenly there was a rumble, like distant thunder. In a more familiar\nsize level, it would have been a clink and a thud, coming through many\nyards of granite. They both recognized it. Ed even chuckled.\n\n\"Whoever or whatever was following the canary machine,\" he said.\n\"Remember?\"\n\nJust then Mitchell Prell's simulacrum appeared, a comic, bearded\nfigure wrapped in a few strands of lint that suggested woven twigs.\nHe swam out of the depths of atmosphere--the fall-guy of an era that\nhad stumbled over its own achievements. And in several of those very\nachievements, he had taken refuge.\n\nHe alighted near Ed and Barbara and wrung their hands cordially. Then\nwords spilled out of him excitedly: \"Ed. Barbara. We've got to hurry.\nBut first we should put our minds straight about one another. I know\nthat back home you were on the side of responsibility and good sense.\nWell, so am I. There haven't been many new quirks added to my viewpoint\nsince you first knew me, Eddie. I want knowledge to blossom into all\nthat it can give us. I think you do, too. Now tell me how you feel.\"\n\nMitchell Prell could still inspire Ed Dukas. Even here, at this\nopposite, smaller end of the cosmos, he imagined again his splendid\ntowers of the future.\n\n\"There were moments when I felt pretty bitter,\" he said, in not too\nfriendly a fashion. \"But in the main I'm with what you just said--all\nthe way. I put my life on it as a pledge.\"\n\nBarbara nodded solemnly.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Prell answered, the breath that he'd drawn for speech\nsighing out of him. \"I'm more grateful than I can tell. You two may\nthink that we're too tiny--that our size makes us powerless. I don't\nbelieve that's true. I was on Earth as I am, you know. I went there and\nback--undetected--on space liners. But while on Earth I missed many\nopportunities to act against danger. Maybe I'd been here too long, down\nclose to the basic components of matter, studying them. And I went to\nEarth poorly equipped in both materials and experience. Well, I think\nyou can see how it was. Let it go for now. Visitors are at our door. I\nsuppose we've got to try to meet them in the manner that they deserve.\"\n\n\"Call the shots!\" Ed said impatiently.\n\nMitchell Prell smiled rather wistfully. \"The main part is done,\" he\nreplied. \"I set the small remote controls of the large vats for revival\nof the bodies in them--our larger selves. That was why I was delayed in\ngetting to you here. They are colossi. They cannot hide. And they must\nbe defended. I'm sorry, they are better able to defend themselves than\nwe are to defend them. At least they will have a better chance alive than\ninert. Revival takes a little time, but in a moment you will see.\"\n\nEd did not quite know what to think about this action on his uncle's\npart--whether to agree to it or to suspect that it was somehow\na mistake. Circumstances were too strange here, and he was too\ninexperienced. And the whole situation itself was fraught with\nconfusion for him. Two selves, both named Edward Dukas? It was not a\nnew circumstance in the ideas of the times. You knew that it could be.\nYet it remained a muddle of identities hard to straighten out. Barbara\nclung to him again, her feelings doubtless similar to his own.\n\n\"It's happening,\" she whispered.\n\nAnd it was. From their perch on the scored, glassy surface under a\nminiature electron microscope, they looked out past the minute tanks\nand the attendant cables, crystals and apparatus that had given them\nspecial being, and across the shimmering void of air, they saw those\nother vats, glassy, too, and tall as mountains.\n\nIt seemed then that the mountains opened, unfolded, grew taller,\ndisgorged Atlases that stepped dripping over a cliff wall. There was\nno connection of mind now--these three giants were other people,\nfor the link had been broken in the past. There was no blending of\nconsciousness.\n\nNow there were vibrations almost too heavy in this miniature region\nto be called sounds. They were more like earthquake shocks. But Ed\nrealized that they were just the noises of normal human movement--the\ngiants Ed, Barbara and Mitch putting on their boots, the grind of their\nfootsteps. Meanwhile they conversed, it seemed; but their voices were\nonly a quiver, a rattle, with a hint of worried inquiry. The giant\nMitchell Prell seemed to make suggestions.\n\nThe lesser Prell must still have understood what was being said. For\nnow he gripped a roughly made microphone and talked into it. His words\nwere amplified to a seismic temblor as they emerged from the sound cone\non the far wall; but to Ed and Barbara they were still directly audible\nfrom the speaker's own lips. \"You've come down to me successfully.\nNow we must see what will happen. Ed, if it is only the police at\nour gates, perhaps it would be best simply to present yourselves as\ncitizens. You and Barbara have rights. And you've fulfilled your pledge\nto them. They can't harm you. Beyond this, I must apologize to you\nboth. You have made a difficult journey to what must seem to you a\nfrustrating blank wall--without experiencing anything very new. That\nis a defect of being duplicated. And there is no time now to blend\ninto your minds the memories of the descent into smallness. I'm sorry.\nMitchell Sandhurst Prell--yes, you, my overgrown former identity--show\nthem what to do. But for heaven's sake, move this workshop of mine to a\nslightly less exposed place!\"\n\nBecause he was like his old self, the smaller Ed Dukas still thought\nas his original did. So, after all, there was that much contact. He\nunderstood the frustration that had just been mentioned, plus the\nconfusion of not having seen the reality of another size level. This\nfailure could even involve suspicion of his uncle's purposes. But there\nwas loyalty and belief, too. From the basis of parallel minds, the\nlesser Ed felt all these emotions personally.\n\nSo he moved quickly, closer to the tiny microphone, bent on giving\nreassurance. He shouted into it; and of course his words came out\nsounding somewhat mad: \"Ed, it's me! Ed! Honestly! And that was a real\nMitchell Prell speaking. Take care of yourself--and Babs--because\nyou're me--or still part of me. And we both love Barbara--in any form.\nHello, Barbara, darling.\"\n\nThere was no time to say any more, for now there began a steady, heavy\nvibration, growing gradually stronger. In a moment he guessed what\nit was. A huge, high-speed drill had been brought into play against\ngranite. Very soon now these caverns would be invaded.\n\nAnd more was happening. There were more seismic temblors. A colossus\nmoved nearer, bringing its shadow; its wet clothing seemed to be woven\nof cables instead of thread. The face, briefly glimpsed, was a huge,\npitted mask, bearded with a forest of dark and tangled trunks. A wind\ncame with him, caused by his motion. He was that other Prell.\n\n\"Hang on!\" his tiny android likeness yelled.\n\nEd of the dust-grain region drew his Barbara down. They flattened\ntogether and clutched part of the intricate but roughly made apparatus\nattached to the vats from which they had emerged, just as the glassy\nfloor under them tilted, and they were almost swept away by gusts of\nair. Wires had been disconnected, and now the whole assembly--large\nmicroscope with the miniature machine shop, middle-sized tank and\nmiddle-sized doll figure under it, and the lesser electron microscope\nwith its similar though reduced equipment--was being carried and\nhoisted.\n\nIt was set on a high shelf. And what must have been a translucent jar\nwas placed in front of it to hide it casually. Maybe there was no time\nfor anything else, for that rough vibration of the drill was becoming\nrapidly more pronounced.\n\n\"They ought to put on oxygen helmets!\" Barbara shouted in the quaking\ntumult. \"These vaults will be unsealed! And they aren't built to live\nin Martian air!\"\n\nMaybe the three giants even heard her, through the mike and sound cone.\nBut they would know, anyway.\n\nFrom the twilight of the jar's shadow, Ed could still see into the\nimmensity of the room. The colossi were donning their heavy gear.\n\nThe vibration had become a gigantic rattle with creaking, crackling\novertones, audible only to micro-ears. Ed felt almost shaken apart and\ndazed by it. Any instant now the drill would break through into the\nroom. But he didn't anticipate much real trouble. It wasn't reasonable.\nHe felt fairly sure that it was the police who had followed his larger\nself here. They had their duty to give protection, not harm. Their\npower might be warped by the fears and prejudices of the times, but not\nbeyond reason.\n\nHe knew that there would be a jolt when the drill came through. So he\nscrambled over to the pallet and pulled from it a long bit of floss,\nthicker to him than a rope. Quickly he bent one end around his waist\nand knotted it, and fastened the middle of it around Barbara. The far\nend he passed to his uncle.\n\n\"Tie on!\" he shouted. \"So we don't get separated. And hold tight to\nanything solid!\"\n\nThe break-through came, and it was not too bad. It felt like a monster\nram hitting the world one sharp, stinging blow; then the spinning\nmountain of the super-hardened drill bit--all of a yard across, it\nmust have been--braked quickly to stationary. There was no tumultuous\noutrush of air of earthly composition and pressure. The drill hole had\nevidently been capped.\n\nEd saw the colossi there in the room--the originals of himself, his\nwife and his uncle--grimly clad for Mars. They had taken up positions\na little behind this obstacle or that, not ready to trust entirely but\nmore or less sure. He knew how it was--particularly with his other\nidentity. There had to be this tense moment before someone, known or\nunknown, spoke. They were armed. At the hip that was still his own in\na way hung the Midas Touch pistol that he remembered, though it was\nexpanded seemingly a million fold.\n\nThe outcome was different from what he could have hoped or expected.\nThere was no voice of challenge or greeting from behind the drill. You\ncould not see beyond the dark space around its jagged rim. There was\nonly perhaps a small, intuitive warning before the neutrons of another\nMidas Touch struck, and a few of the atoms of metal and flesh and\nstone exploded in a narrow, sweeping curve, making a flash in which\nall visible details became lost and a volume of sound and quaking in a\nconfined space that, of itself, could have killed.\n\nThe little Ed Dukas could be proud of his forerunner, for he was quick\nenough to have half drawn his own Midas Touch, just as the blaze of\nlight came.\n\nIt didn't do any good. The lesser Ed's android consciousness was rugged\nenough not to be lost, even as he and his companions, tethered like\nbeads on a string, were sucked upward into the swirling dust of the\natmosphere. So he saw how the Midas Touch, discharged from behind the\ndrill, cut slantingly, like a sword blade, across the room, its narrow\nbeam slicing through the three giants almost simultaneously. Then,\nfor a moment, coherence of impression was lost in swirl and glare and\ntumbling motion. But when the tumult quieted slightly and he floated on\nchoppy air currents, he saw the crumpled, mountainous forms. Mitchell\nPrell--colossal version--had been chopped in two at the waist. The\nheads and shoulders of the other two giants had ceased to be.\n\nTo Ed Dukas's micro-cosmic nostrils, the smell of burned flesh remained\nunchanged. Nor was his capacity for horror any different. It came after\nthat small, numb pause of doubt of what he had just seen. He heard the\nlesser Prell and the lesser Barbara shout from beside him. They had not\nbeen torn loose from the joining strand--luckily.\n\nAt first he thought that the attack had come from someone other than\nthose who had trailed him. But then the drill point moved forward.\nFrom behind it stepped several men, wearing the trim vacuum armor of\nInterworld Security--usually honorable in the past but now sometimes\nmade shaky and corrupt by the doubts within its own ranks and among the\npeople about what, within the realm of human effort, was good or bad.\n\nThe group had a leader. Ed and his companions drifted idly in the air,\nnear the man's shoulders, but his helmeted head still loomed in the sky\nof their present world. Old personality hints were hard to translate\nfrom such magnitudes; but the cocky briskness and triumph showed. There\nwere rumblings and quakings of speech. Ed began to recognize repeated\npatterns in the rattle of it. Centuries ago, the deaf had had a way\nto \"hear\"--by sense of touch. And by feeling the heavy vibration, Ed\nknew that he was \"hearing\" syllables too heavy for his present auditory\norgans to detect as such: \"... Prell's lab ... Dukas led us....\"\n\nEd could still understand only scattered scraps; but the skill was\ncoming--now, with his body, he felt the stinging discord which must\nhave been a harsh laugh.\n\nNow a gust of wind from a vast swinging arm lifted the strand of floss\nand the three who were tied to it upward. Beyond the view window of the\nhelmet, Ed saw the tremendous face--rolling plains and hills, pitted\nwith pores and hair follicles, and scaled with skin, beneath which the\nindividual living cells were easily visible, the latter mysteriously\nhaloed around the edges with a faint luminosity. The mouth was a long,\nrilled valley, crescented into a hard grin. The nose was a crag. The\neyes were concave lakes set in rough country and islanded with iris and\npupil.\n\n\"You know him, don't you, Eddie?\" Barbara said.\n\nSize did not hide the bullish quality or the gimlet stare. Rather, it\nemphasized an ugliness of character.\n\n\"Of course,\" Ed answered. \"Carter Loman, who was with Chief Bronson and\nwho spoke to us before we left. An unidentified official with whom we\nmade the deal to come here. Nice guy. Feels that he can be the whole of\nthe law out here in the remote Martian desert.\"\n\nAgain Loman addressed his henchmen. Ed was getting better at\nunderstanding the vibrating words: \"We'll clear everything out for\nshipment back home. I've got to study this equipment! But before we\neven open a door we'll sterilize everything with a four per cent\nneutron stream. That'll kill even that damned vitaplasm! Fascinating,\ndevilish stuff! Too bad, in a way, to erase it here--because I think I\nknow what's still around, and I'd like to see. But we can't take the\nrisk. A snake I might give a chance, but not a robot or robot-lover!\"\n\nLoman paused, then spoke again, turning his head this way and that,\ndirecting his words toward the invisible: \"Prell, you're dead, but are\nyou still somehow here? What can't happen in the crazy age you helped\ncreate? On Earth we psyched your nephew. Don't think I didn't guess\nwhat you were doing. Now we've taken your carcass into the other room\nto psych your dead brain. In a few minutes we'll know. There'll be ways\nto stop your kind of folly!\"\n\nAs the great head continued to turn here and there questioningly, the\nstill-living Mitchell Prell shouted in derision: \"Here I am, crusader!\"\n\nBut there were no microphone and sound-cone in action now, and Loman\ndid not hear him.\n\nMaybe Barbara's present eyes were too minute to shed tears, but her\nface looked as though she were weeping. \"Loman is the worst kind\nof fanatic,\" she said. \"Sure that he's right, and blind about it.\nSadistic, energetic and, I suppose, clever.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you more about him,\" Mitchell Prell offered softly. \"His\nface gives a faint glow--a fine radiation that only our eyes can see.\nRadioactivity. It wouldn't be visible on Earth, where oxygen gives even\nan android bodily energy. But on Mars--or wherever else that oxygen\nis in short supply--vitaplasm adapts readily to other energy sources.\nIt would be silly for him to carry air purifiers in that helmet he's\nwearing.\"\n\nEd Dukas looked down at his own arms. Yes, they glowed, too, though\nhe'd hardly noticed it before in the light of the great ato lamps.\n\n\"Then Loman is an android who hates androids!\" Barbara breathed. \"Well,\nI guess that hating one's own kind has happened often enough before.\nBut an android in the Interworld Police? Under physical examination, he\ncould never hide what he is.\"\n\n\"Legally, they still have equal rights,\" Ed answered. \"That much I'm\nglad for. They couldn't be kept out of the Force. But there could be\nother twists, not so unprejudiced. A thief sent to catch a thief, would\nyou say? Something strong, and full of self-hatred, sent out to match\nstrength? Tom Granger, and thousands of others, might think like that.\"\n\nEd Dukas's anger broke through at last, slow and terrible. Maybe he\nhad been too startled before for exact meanings to register. The other\nBarbara, whom he loved, had been murdered, her body mangled. It was the\nsame with his own other self, and his uncle's. Those bodies had been\nthe one available route back to all familiar things and out of this\nweird place of expanded forms, warped physical laws, keening sounds and\ndistances multiplied a millionfold. But now those bodies were gone. And\neven if beings invisible in smallness could escape death in neutron\nstreams from Midas Touch pistols turned low, there would be little left\nthat they, in their tininess, could work with. They would be stranded\nhere in a microcosmos for as long as they could survive, helpless to\nmove even a pebble.\n\nThese thoughts were fringed with a homesickness that Ed had never\nbefore known. He wondered if a little dust-grain android could go mad.\nIt was Carter Loman's fault. No, the responsibility extended further\nthan that! To Tom Granger, the rabble-rouser, and those like him,\nand those who listened. And to a renegade android leader of mythical\norigin. Yes, it was Mitchell Prell's fault, too, and his own for coming\nhere and bringing Barbara.\n\nWith his two companions, Ed Dukas floated high in the air, supported\nby molecular impacts, near the helmeted head of an Atlas called Carter\nLoman, and felt his fury and the helpless contrast of dimensions.\nThis giant, aided by his henchmen, had all of the advantage, while Ed\nand his wife and uncle could be blown away merely by the wind of that\nmonster hand in motion.\n\nLoman was throwing words at Mitchell Prell again, his voice coming\neasily through the thin face plate of his helmet. It was not a true\nsound to micro-ears. Rather, it was a heavy quiver in the air, felt\nwith one's entire body. \"Prell, I'm sure you haven't stopped existing.\nDon't think that I can't understand how. And you did things to me.\nThere was your Moonblast, but that wasn't the worst. Everything you\nstand for must be stamped out. Even if we all go with it.\"\n\nMaybe it was then that Ed's thoughts became crystalized. His anger was\nturned cold and clear, as if by need. Although Ed was of vitaplasm\nhimself, he felt no loyalty to kind. In fact, he was still far from\nreconciled to the condition. But an enemy of reason was an enemy to all\nmen of whatever sort.\n\nHis wits were sharpened. Suddenly a realization of the power in\nsmallness came to him--combined with the hardiness and flexibility\nof flesh that made even such dimensions and powers possible. Android\npowers.\n\n\"I guess everybody must have a breaking point of fear and\nexasperation,\" he said softly. \"We were born to it. To be crowded from\nthe Earth can seem a terrible idea. But maybe even that is as it should\nbe, and good. I can't agree that pushing everything into extinction\nin an open fight can be any better. We've gained too much. There is\ntoo much wonder ahead. And maybe, small as we are, we can quiet the\nleaders. Under the right conditions, I think we could handle these\ngiants--even kill them if necessary. Quieting Loman and Granger might\nhelp a little.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mitchell Prell answered. \"I thought of it myself. Perhaps I\ndidn't have the nerve to carry the idea through. Maybe that was why I\nwanted you to come to me on Mars--where I had the apparatus to change\nyou. Microbes are smaller than we are, yet they used to kill men.\"\n\nEd Dukas saw his wife wince. But this couldn't make any difference now.\n\n\"Ed and Barbara, I'm sorry for all I've gotten you into,\" Prell added.\n\n\"Don't be,\" Ed told him. \"Who can regret a chance to try to do some\ngood in what seemed a hopeless conflict? Now, first, let's get out of\nhere, if we still can or ever could.\"\n\nEd felt some of the command switching to himself--strange, because his\nuncle knew far more about these regions than he did. But Mitchell Prell\nwas made more for study than for physical action. And he was somewhat\nfuddled by the effects of the miracles he had helped produce.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe colossi were piling Mitchell Prell's movable equipment into a\ncorner, where Midas Touch pistols, turned low, could play neutron\nstreams against it. Then they would no doubt scour walls, floors and\nceilings with the same corpuscular beams. The air itself would heat\nup considerably. Combustible floating dust, would burn to finer dust.\nDrafts would seem blasting hurricanes.\n\n\"There's a way out--if we hurry,\" Mitchell Prell said. \"Imitate my\nmovements.\"\n\nAnd so they swam in the atmosphere. But without other aid it would have\nbeen slow going indeed. But the motion of dust particles revealed the\ndirection of air currents that could be gotten into and used to cover\ndistance.\n\nStill, progress back to the shelf and the microscopes, and the tiny\nworkshop from which they had been blown but a few minutes before, was\nagonizingly slow. By luck and scanty concealment offered by the jar,\nthis paraphernalia had not yet been discovered or moved by Loman and\nhis men.\n\nEd and his companions came to rest at last on the rough glass surface\nwhere little machines were arranged around the vats and their apparatus.\n\n\"Tools that we can use,\" Ed said. \"And materials that we can work.\nWe've got to try to take some things along. To make weapons. Could we\ncontrive Midas Touch pistols that we could hold?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Prell answered. \"I hope so. Take this, and that--and that over\nthere. Hurry.\"\n\nCreatures of vitaplasm, with its complex combinations of silicon\ncompounds paralleling the hydrocarbons, and its internal metabolism\nthat could even involve transmutation and subatomic energy release,\nstill could die under sufficiently violent conditions.\n\nThe three tiny androids scrambled to gather supplies and to equip\nthemselves. Ed was awkward in the new conditions, where even the\natmosphere tried to tear him away from any firm foothold. But he loaded\nhimself down.\n\nBefore they were finished gathering all that they could use, the rattle\nand flare of Midas Touch weapons, turned low so as not to damage\nMitchell Prell's various apparatus, but strong enough to destroy any\nclinging speck of synthetic life that Carter Loman might suspect\nthe presence of, began behind them. Prell's experimental plant life\nwithered slowly.\n\n\"Lead on!\" Ed Dukas shouted.\n\nAnd so, though hurricanes had begun for them, they crept across the\nglazed surface beneath the barrel of the little electron microscope\nand dropped into the air at its edge. It was like leaping from a\ncliff. But it was different, too. For if they had not been so heavily\nburdened, they might not even have fallen. Being such small objects,\nthey had a greater exposed surface than large objects, in proportion to\ntheir bulk. This greater surface, like a sail presented to the wind,\noffered a larger area for speeding molecules to hit; hence, without the\nequipment, they would have been as buoyant as dust particles.\n\nStill lashed together by their joining strand of floss, the three\nfugitives drifted slowly down to the rear of the shelf.\n\n\"An inch more to go,\" Prell shouted, in grim humor. \"A rather long one,\nI'm afraid.\"\n\nAgain they crept. Rough stone of the cupboardlike compartment rose\naround them, seemingly taller than buildings they had known. And it\nglowed reddish-violet. Fluorescence, it must be, from the scattered\nradiations of the Midas Touch weapons. Tediously the three crawled\ntoward escape, as if through a night of fire and violence. Finally they\nreached a minute steel door in the corner of the cupboard, half hidden\nin the roughness of the stone.\n\nThey closed the door behind them and refastened its crude bolt. The\nspace around them now was narrower--more in proportion to their own\nsize. And there was a glow here--at least to their final eyesight.\nPerhaps there was a trace of radioactive ore in the rock causing the\nglow. The walls were as rough as a cave's.\n\n\"Just a chink in the stone,\" Barbara commented.\n\n\"Yes,\" Prell replied. \"A crevice leading out to the face of the rock\nformation. Feel the draft of Martian night air? It would smother\nand freeze you if you were as you were born. But our flesh not only\nresists cold, it can create plenty of warmth within itself. We will be\nperfectly comfortable here, and safe--I think. Do you want to rest?\"\n\n\"No,\" Barbara told him. \"We don't really need that, either, do we? So\nlet's begin what must be done. What are our plans, Ed?\"\n\n\"We'll make a few things, if we can,\" Ed replied. \"Then get to a\nspaceport somehow. I suppose that if we pick the right wind at the\nright time, it will blow us there--eh, Uncle Mitch? Then we'll do as\nyou did--drift into a space liner and get a free ride back home to\nEarth. There--well, we'll see. If we're very, very lucky, we might\neven get our old selves back.\"\n\nJust then that recovery seemed to be his greatest, most desperate\nyearning, with many, many obstacles in its way. Even their personal\nrecordings were in enemy hands now. Small though those cylinders were,\nthey were far too huge for them to move or to think of recapturing.\n\n\"Where can we start to work?\" Ed said to his uncle.\n\n\"Farther along the cleft,\" Prell told him. \"I've already cached some\nsupplies there. And there's a level space in a side cleft protected\nfrom these constant air currents.\"\n\nNow they leaped upward and let the draft carry them. The muted quivers\nof destruction in the chambers from which they had just escaped, they\nleft behind them. They arrived in the work area and got busy at once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNear dawn they felt the quiverings of unusual sounds. So they followed\nair currents, betrayed by drifting particles of fluorescent dust, to a\ncrack that showed starshot sky and the undulating desert. Thus they saw\nCarter Loman's caravan start back toward Port Karnak, with its booty\nof all that Mitchell Prell had made here: the fruit of a man's mind.\nBut to Loman it was also the worst of the world's inventions. Loman was\nan android and also, obviously, a central figure, a personage of some\nimportance, or he would not have been sent on this mission. But his\nmind remained that of a bigot.\n\nJust then Ed Dukas found a savage pleasure in shaking one of the\nsmallest fists ever to exist at the three retreating tractor vehicles.\n\"Loman, Granger and the rest of you,\" he said, \"there'll come a time.\nYou've been fools. You were born too late.\"\n\nThe work went on for days--more tediously than Ed could have imagined,\neven with only hand tools to use. The same old metals seemed\nunbelievably hard at this size level--and coarse in texture--as if the\natoms themselves had expanded. Barbara could scrub and scrub with a\nbit of abrasive mineral, achieving only what seemed a poor excuse for\na polish. Hammering did little good in shaping such metals, though Ed\nDukas and Mitchell Prell were relatively so much stronger than they had\nbeen. Only cutting and pressure tools were effective, when aided by\nthe softening heat of a forge--a tiny speck of nuclear incandescence\nmaintained by a neutron stream and carefully screened, though\nvitaplasm, being actively or latently radioactive itself, was far less\nendangered by radiation than protoplasm.\n\nBut at last they produced three rough, cylindrical devices and their\nfittings.\n\nEd Dukas began to adjust to littleness. But to see boulders with their\nstratified layers of mica floating lazily through the thin air never\nlost its wonder. Crazy beauty was all around: strange, rich colors;\nkeening musical notes--fine overtones of normal sounds. Sometimes, in\nthe daylight, near cracks open to the outdoors, you saw living things\nseldom bigger than yourself: Martian life; little pincushions of\ndeep, translucent purple veined with red and pronged with cilia of an\nindescribably warm hue. These were Martian microorganisms blown in by\nthe breeze.\n\nAnd once there was something else that Ed and Barbara both saw:\nsomething like the smallest of Earthly insects, but not that, either.\nA thing of steel-blue filaments and great eyes, and vibrating vanes as\nglossy as transparent plastic. Ed knew that he could shatter it with\nhis hands. It rested in the sunshine for a moment; then it was gone.\n\n\"I suppose that there are star worlds as odd as this,\" Barbara\ncommented.\n\nShe was strange herself--an elfin being that floated in the air, her\nform dimly aglow whenever there was shadow or darkness. To Ed, she\nwas part of his vast separation from Earth. In accustoming himself to\nan environment where even the simple act of walking was a memory, it\nseemed that Earth dimmed away, easily yet frighteningly, like a dream,\nuntil Ed knew that, degree by degree, his mind was becoming different\nthan it had been, and he not quite the same person. And it seemed more\nso with Babs.\n\n\"Bacon and eggs for breakfast, Eddie,\" she teased once, lightly. \"Walks\nunder old trees beside a river. The Youth Center. Teachers I used to\nknow. Yes, I remember. But the memory tries to get dim. And I want to\nhold on. Got to, because there are things to be done. But sometimes I\nwonder if I shouldn't regret the duty. I think of swimming in raindrops\nor floating high over trees--being as whimsical as children and poets\ncan imagine. We could do it! It's part of being super, isn't it? And I\nused to be scared of becoming an android!\"\n\nIt was fun, and relief from grimness, to hear her talk like that. And\nnow, too, he half agreed that being of synthetic substance was not so\nbad. Yet part of him still ached savagely for his old dimensions. And\nhere in smallness he sometimes felt that she was changing so much that\nhe was losing her--that she would let herself be blown away into the\nvastness, never to be seen again.\n\nThey ate a food-jelly, which Prell had prepared long ago for his\nsojourn here, and radioactive silicates. In it you could see the\nthready molecular chains and the beads of moisture between. Viscosity\ncomplicated etiquette. Everything tried to stick to you. You laughed\nand shook it off as best you could.\n\nBut even in fantastic moments grim facts didn't truly fade. Hard work\nhelped sustain them. Murder and loss were too new. The danger on Earth\nwas still too plain--perhaps poised on hours or weeks of time. Speed\nwas the keynote.\n\nOnly once the three micro-beings peeped back into the lab that had\nbelonged to Mitchell Prell, colossus. It was empty now, glowing with\nthe taint of radiation left by the Midas Touch pistols. No one had\ntroubled to neutralize it, as had surely been done with the removed\nequipment.\n\nMitchell Prell had built a radio, like one he had owned before. A flake\nof quartz dust, a few rough strands of metal, an insignificant power\nsupply. Simple, compact. Certain crystals were sensitive to radio\nwaves. And at these tremendously reduced dimensions, they could convert\ntiny induced electric currents almost directly into fine sound waves\nthat infinitely refined ears could hear.\n\nSo Ed Dukas heard the interplanetary newscast again: \"... Android\ngroups are still massing in large numbers to seek safety among\ntheir own kind and perhaps to carry out their own plans. There is a\nsuperficial calm. Fear of consequences so far seems to have kept both\nsides in check. We hope that it can hold.\"\n\nLater there was a broadcast from Port Smitty: \"... This information was\nwithheld but has now been released. The mystery of Mitchell Prell's\ndisappearance is believed solved after ten years. What is claimed to\nbe his body--much damaged, since he and his confederates, one of whom\nis supposed to be a close relative, resisted capture and had to be\nshot down--was brought in to Port Smitty and is now en route to Earth,\nalong with some mysterious equipment. The man who tracked Prell down\nis Carter Loman, a scientist in his own right, who has had a brief\nbut brilliant career in Interworld Security. Detailed information is\nunder seal, but Prell, a known advocate of 'improved mankind,' has been\nwanted for questioning and possible indictment for a long time. It has\nbeen suggested that his researches had gone further than most would\ndare to imagine.\"\n\nMitchell Prell, micro-being, chuckled. \"The funny part,\" he remarked,\n\"is that I never became a full-size android myself. My old carcass\nseemed good enough. Or I didn't get around to a change.\"\n\nBut Ed didn't smile at this. And he looked savage when one of Tom\nGranger's speeches was rebroadcast: \"Prell ended? Can we believe it?\nThere is an evil that could restore him in known ways. Now are there\nunknowns, too? Haven't we had enough? Some things from drunken visions\nare destroyed, but others come, to make our nights hideous. A creature\nwith a fifty-foot wingspread swoops down on a house, and people die.\nAre androids any different from what they create? But we are fortified,\narmed. If we must, we'll fight to the last.\"\n\nNo doubt there was truth behind the melodramatic oratory--at least as\nfar as the horror was concerned. Barbara smiled sadly.\n\n\"He's earnest, I think,\" she offered. \"So there's that much glory and\ncourage in him, if there isn't any control. And you keep wondering, Is\nhe half right?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ed answered with some contrition. \"But I'd rather have what\nhe considers a scientific hell than nothing. Well, we'll soon be en\nroute back to Earth--unseen. Then maybe we'll find out and accomplish\nsomething. Lack of sense, like Granger's, or the muddled way in which\nlaws are often interpreted now, will never work. That's one fact I'm\nsure of, even in a booby-trapped situation.\"\n\nEd was trying to be optimistic. In three weeks they had made equipment\nthat they thought they could use. The three cylinders were Midas Touch\npistols--neutron blast guns that could explode a few of the atoms of\nany solid or liquid that their beams touched. They also had a dozen\ngrenades of the same principle and tubes to carry scant rations. There\nwas a radio for each of the three--for reception, but also limitedly\nuseful as transmitters. And there were knapsacks and clothing made from\nlinten fiber pounded and divided as Prell had never bothered to do.\n\n\"We'll catch the first Earth-bound ship that we can,\" Prell said.\n\"Queer, isn't it? If we could truly walk, going a mile would seem\nimpossible. But the prevailing winds and a little jockeying will get us\nto Port Karnak. The tube train will take us to the space ships.\"\n\nPrell had spoken too soon. Within that same hour, listening to the\nnewscast, they learned: \"For security reasons, interplanetary traffic\nhas been indefinitely suspended.\"\n\nEd Dukas winced as if in pain. He and Barbara and Prell looked at one\nanother. In Ed's strange, small body, frustration and bitter anger\nfairly hummed.\n\n\"Security reasons.\" That could be a blanket excuse--minus\nexplanations--for almost anything. Loman, knowing of something inimical\nand microscopic, and guessing at an intended journey from Mars, could\nwell have had a hand in the suspension order. He was wary, and not sure\nthat he had destroyed his hidden enemies.\n\nThe three stared down at the equipment that they had toiled so hard\nto produce. But Ed, like many another man before him who had been\ncornered, couldn't have quit even if he had willed it. Stubborn spunk,\nfear, need to regain losses, self-preservation and the awareness of the\ndanger of millions of well-intentioned individuals, both android and\nhuman, all took part in the reason. And you could add the ancient and\nprimal lust for revenge.\n\nEd crouched with the others on the rough floor of their chink in\nthe rock. \"Wait,\" he said at last. \"Haven't small objects crossed\nspace naturally--at least in hypothesis? Yes! Spores--living dust,\ntheir vital functions suspended. The old Arrhenius Theory of the\npropagation of life from world to world and solar system to solar\nsystem--throughout the universe. A spore, drifting high in an\natmosphere, achieves escape velocity through molecular impacts and\nperhaps the pressure of solar light. It's driven into space, and\nonward. Uncle Mitch, couldn't the same thing happen to us far more\nreadily, since we're not inert and we have minds to help direct our\nmovements? Since we have beams of massive neutrons from the Midas Touch\nweapons? And aren't we more rugged than the first androids? Wouldn't we\nhave a middling chance to endure raw space itself?\"\n\nMitchell Prell eyed him quietly. Perhaps even his android cheeks\nblanched a trifle. \"Something like that occurred to me once--a long\ntime ago, Ed,\" he remarked at last, his voice very calm. \"I didn't\nthink it through. I guess it seemed just too out of the ordinary even\nfor me. And there wasn't any need to try it. Perhaps I was scared.\"\n\n\"There's need now,\" Ed said.\n\nBarbara's expression was a study of eagerness and half fear. \"Eddie,\nhave you maybe discovered something?\" she exclaimed. \"Uncle Mitch, if\nthere is any chance that it would work, I'm game to try it!\"\n\nAfter a moment the scientist nodded. \"I believe that there's a good\nchance it will work,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore the next sunup they were ready. Clothed in garments of linten\nfiber, they looked like savages from fifty thousand years before. Yet\ntheir present condition could have belonged to no primitive era. They\nwere united by a tough line of twisted strands, and their equipment was\nlashed to their backs. To human eyes they would have been as invisible\nas spirits. Were they to demonstrate, even unintentionally, android\nsuperiority in yet another field? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nFrom the outlet of the crevice in the rock, they flung themselves into\nthe atmosphere above the gray desert. Their great advantage at this\nstage was that, at the Martian dawn fringe, there were many updrafts,\nfor the air, chilled fearfully at night, was already warming. At\nonce they were sucked upward, as if by a vertical wind. Still, the\nfirst phase of their climb took many hours. They kept watching for\nupward-moving motes to guide them. Short, rocketlike bursts of heavy\nneutrons from their Midas Touch cylinders provided the reaction or kick\nto get them into the swiftest vertical currents.\n\nMars dropped far below, a dun plain marked here and there by the\nstraight, artificial valleys or \"canals.\" The relative vastness of a\nworld to beings of pinpoint dimensions was nullified by the distance of\naltitude, until it looked no more extensive than it would have to the\neyes that used to be theirs. Mars developed a visible curvature and a\nrim of haze, fired to redness by the rising sun. The sky above darkened\nfrom hard, deep blue toward the blackness of space, and the stars\nsharpened. The sun blazed whitely, and the frosty wings of its corona\nbegan to show. The thinning atmosphere seemed to develop a definite\nsurface far beneath the three voyagers.\n\nThey had spoken little in their ascent; but now the free movement of\nsound was smothered by the increasing vacuum, and there were only\ngestures and lip movements to convey meanings.\n\nBut there was not much that really needed to be said. The plan remained\nsimple: get into trains of upward-jetting molecules, marked by small\nblurs or warpings of light. Absorb some of that upward surge into\nyourselves. How often had this same thing happened, without conscious\ndesign? Molecules move fast in a high vacuum. Molecular velocity was\nheat, wasn't it? But here it could not burn. For heat is chained to\nmatter, and here there was just not enough matter to be hot.\n\nEd thought that they must be getting close to the Martian velocity of\nescape now. Only three-point-two miles per second. They might have\nattained it more simply by making greater use of their Midas Touch\ncylinders. There was scarcely any reactive thrust more efficient than\nthat of neutrons hurled at almost the speed of light. But there was a\npride in accomplishing it in a more difficult way. Besides, the energy\nsupply for the weapons must be conserved.\n\nBut now Prell signaled with his hand, and they began to use the\ncylinders in earnest, shifting their course little by little from the\nvertical and in the direction of the sun. For it was time to curve\ninward--earthward. Swiftly now, there was no molecular distortion\naround them at all. Sense of motion faded out. Their high velocity was\ndemonstrated only by the rapid shrinking of Mars behind them; unless,\nfrom sunward there came a minute, resisting thrust. Light pressure? But\nit would take a longer time in space than they meant to be to slow them\ndown at all.\n\n\"We've done this much!\" Ed said with his lips, but without a voice.\n\nBarbara nodded and tried to smile, and he reached out and pressed her\nhand. Prell looked awed and bemused.\n\nEd tried then to read part of their fortunes in the reactions of his\nstrange, minute body to the rigors of space. It was an atomic mechanism\nmore than it was a chemical one. Therefore, it needed no breath. And\nthe strong, radiant energy of the sun warmed it a little, so he did\nnot feel cold. Hard ultraviolet light seemed not to harm it. There was\nonly a sensation as of the shrinking of its hide--perhaps an adaptive\nreaction of its demoniac vitality--to protect the trace of moisture\nwithin it against the dryness of space. The fluid within vitaplasm\ncould be alcohol or liquid air--it was that adaptable. Prell had said\nthis recently. Such fluids did not freeze easily. But they evaporated.\nSo water remained the best body fluid in dry space. For in the full\nlight of the sun, and with a nuclear metabolism, freezing was not a\ngreat danger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeveral days out from Mars the three contacted a small meteor\nswarm--maybe a fragment of a comet moving sunward and earthward. They\nmoved with the swarm and landed on a chunk of whitish rock perhaps\neight inches through at its largest diameter. But to them it was an\nairless world into which they could burrow, blocking the entrance to\ntheir shelter with chalky dust--a fortunate thing, for in the open the\nsun's glare and aridity of space were drying out even their android\ntissues and blurring their minds.\n\nThe meteor proved not quite lifeless, for on it clear crystalline\nneedles crumbled and rose again. Call it silicon biology, proving that\none could never know where something might thrive. In a fall into any\natmosphere, such growth would surely be burned away without a trace.\n\nEd and Barbara and Prell learned to understand silent speech by\nwatching lip movements. The need for hurry still beat in their minds,\nbut drowsiness crept over them--perhaps another androidal adaptability\nwas functioning here, related to the hibernation of animals in winter.\nIt lessened loss of vitality when conditions were not too favorable.\nBut you could resist its compulsions if you applied your will.\n\nThe meteor moved on swiftly in the general direction of Earth. The\njourney would take weeks, and though Ed felt that never had there been\na crossing of distance as eerily strange as this one, still the passage\nof time, and the events it held, was always with him and his companions.\n\nThere was a way for them still to experience real sounds, even here.\nThe quartz-flake radio sets, pressed tight to their ears, transmitted\nvibrations through their own substance, when there was no air. They\nheard fragments of broadcasts coming from Earth. Pictures of what was\nhappening there came to mind:\n\nA score of monsters destroyed by hunting parties. A side issue, really.\nFor in guard post and sketchily fortified line, man faced the hardier\nlikeness that his knowledge had produced. When there were no clearly\ndefined geographical boundaries to separate the poised forces, you\nnever knew just where those lines would be.\n\nBut the scared, the pleading, the exhorting voices, faint in the\ndistance, gave the mood, if not the clear view. Tom Granger was there,\nand others like him. The latest claim was that vitaplasm gave off\npoisonous radioactive radiations--not very true on Earth, where its\nvital energy remained mainly chemical.\n\nThose with sense also tried to be heard. And there were other voices\ncalling for the retreat to simplicity and the doing of work by hand.\nSuch a pastoral of white clouds, green hills and sunshine could\nhave its appeal. But how could its philosophy and inefficiency feed\nbillions? Even if it were not just a bright vision seen before the last\nbattle?\n\nAnd in the midst of all this babble, there was another voice that was\nfaint thunder: \"... Got things of our own now, here in the woods! Even\nour own newscast station. Damn, we've taken enough! We Phonies won't go\nback no further! Time to be stubborn--even if we all die for it and\nnever come back! They say folks would like to hang me--which shows how\nmuch wits they've got! Even if they got the chance, it wouldn't work!\"\n\nWith a faint smile, Barbara's lips formed the name for her companions\nto read: \"Abel Freeman....\"\n\nEd nodded, watching his uncle's quizzical interest over an individual\nand a legend that he had only heard them tell about. And Ed had his own\nreactions, compounded of admiration, humor and icy mistrust that came\nclose to hatred. Whatever else he was, Abel Freeman was also a figure\nof power.\n\nBarbara's pixyish mouth--she was more than ever a pixy--shaped other\nwords as they crouched at the entrance of a tiny cave that they had\nexcavated into their meteor. Outside, the sunshine blazed.\n\n\"I've almost said it before, Ed,\" she remarked. \"All these things\nhappening on Earth are still important to me--never fear. But I'm\na little too different now to quite belong to it. It gets like a\ndream--kind of remote.\"\n\nEd had been feeling this himself--almost with panic, because he was\nenough the person he had been to ache inside with the importance and\ntension of what happened at home. Yet somehow part of him was drifting\naway on its own special course.\n\n\"Hold on, Babs, a little longer,\" he urged.\n\nThey fell into torpid sleep after they had devised a mechanism to\narouse them with an electric shock at an appointed time. It conserved\ntheir strength and allowed them to pass the long interval quickly.\n\nEd Dukas's slumber was not altogether dreamless. Like shadows,\npeople moved in his mind. His parents. His old friend Les Payten,\nwho perhaps had shown the white feather and had been lost to a small\nviewpoint. Schaeffer, one of the greatest scientists, barricaded in\nhis underground lab in the City. And Harwell, the efficient but daring\nadventurer--another legend of his boyhood, who sometime was supposed\nto command the first star ship. And perhaps most of all, there was that\nfantastic android bigot, Carter Loman, who aroused his black fury.\n\nPerhaps Ed slept lighter than the others and awoke more quickly to the\ntingling prickle of electricity, because he had to run the show. The\nmajor burden of responsibility was his.\n\nHe shook his wife and his uncle awake and pointed to the blue-green\nbead that was the Earth, still several million miles away. Lashing\ntheir equipment to their shoulders and tying onto one another's waists\nlike Alpine climbers, they leapt back into space one more, pushed by\nthe neutron thrust of their Midas Touch cylinders. They had to make the\nrest of their trip apart from their meteor, which would not pass any\nnearer to Earth.\n\nWhen the home planet was expanded by nearness to a great, mottled,\nfuzzy bubble, Ed tugged at the line for attention and spoke without\nsound in the stinging silence: \"We've talked everything over before,\"\nhe said. \"So we know generally what to do--though only generally. We'd\nlike to stick together. But there is just no way to do that and work\nfast--which may be a vital point. So we'll soon have to scatter. But\nwe'll listen on our receivers. At least one of us should be able to\nfind a way to communicate back. Failing that, we still know where to\nmeet. Remember--the oak by my old house. The valley made by the trunk\nand the lowest branch.\"\n\nPrell's brows knitted, his mind probably steeped in the swift, strange\naction to come. Barbara gave a soundless laugh.\n\n\"The crotch of an oak!\" her lips commented. \"What a trysting place! But\nit seems natural enough. Are we mad, or were we once just dull?\"\n\nWas her gaiety just bravado, or was she as cool as she seemed? Ed hoped\nthat she was cool. Tugging at the linten line that joined them, Ed drew\nhimself close to her.\n\n\"You don't have to speak, Eddie,\" she told him. \"I know what you're\nthinking. But why shouldn't I--and all of us--be all right?\"\n\nHer face had sobered. She looked strong. And so he was somewhat\nrelieved. He kissed her. Perhaps it was odd that dust-mote beings still\ncould do that.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nEd and Barbara and Prell came to the parting of the ways sooner than\nthey had intended. Without instruments, it was hard to judge velocity.\nThey did not use their Midas Touch cylinders quite long enough to check\nspeed sufficiently as they approached the great blue-green planet with\nits blurred ring. They hit the atmosphere, not really fast, but fast\nenough. Briefly, sound was reborn around them in a shrieking whistle,\nlike a vast, thin wind. They tumbled over and over, and the strand\nthat kept them together was broken. Tumultuous currents of the high\nionosphere separated and scattered them as they plummeted lower.\n\nEd was unhurt. And did he hear--more in his imagination than his ears,\nhere in the muffling semi-vacuum--a distant laugh and shout: \"It's\nall right, Eddie ...\"? The impression faded away, like the voice of\nsome gay sprite vanishing. He'd thought before of losing Barbara. Now\nthey were two specks, separated from each other in the infinity of the\nterrestrial atmosphere. Even with the logic of plan and method, there\nwas still some unbelief about how they would ever find each other again.\n\nUsing his radio, he tried to call. But there was no answer. The\nmicroscopic instrument could pick up messages from powerful stations\nmillions of miles away. But for transmission, its range and that of\nthose like it had to be ridiculously short: perhaps a score of yards--a\nfair distance in proportionate units.\n\nEd was drifting now, alone and high, as his wife and uncle must be,\ntoo. Well, they'd meant this to happen soon anyway. So there was no\nreal difference, was there? Get down to work quickly, down to the\nsurface, where the high clouds seemed to lie flat on the gray Atlantic\nand on the nearby greenery of the continent. Ed's cylinder flamed,\nforcing him lower toward the City. His first chosen task was to find\nCarter Loman, a key enemy. Prell's objective was Tom Granger; then he\nwould try to contact the androids, perhaps through Abel Freeman. And\nBarbara was to try to spike the trigger of violence by whatever means\nshe could. That, in fact, was the greatest purpose of them all.\n\nDowndrafts aided Ed's descent, while he listened to his quartz-chip\nradio. Was one who figured as prominently as Loman in the strained\nnews of the day ever difficult to find? Ed did not anticipate too\nmuch trouble in locating him. Many people would know where Loman was\nand mention of the place would be frequent. Crowds would follow him\neverywhere.\n\nAs Ed watched a wolfish patrol of armed spacecraft, flying low on their\natmospheric foils, the information came easily enough: \"... Carter\nLoman's quarters at the Three Worlds Hotel are constantly under guard.\"\n\nEd was far more proficient now in getting around swiftly in the region\nof smallness. Erratically but effectively, using currents of air and\nthe thrust of his Midas Touch blast, he descended toward a sky-piercing\ntower. He drifted into the doorway of the hotel's sumptuous lobby,\nmarred now by the grim additions of radiation shields. For a few\nminutes Ed perched on the reception desk; he was less noticeable there\nthan a fleck of cigarette ash.\n\nThere were constant inquiries for Loman, by telephone and in person,\nmade mostly by newscast men. The clerks fended them off briskly. But\nsoon there came whispered thunder, so low that it was almost audible to\nEd as sound and not merely sensible as a heavy vibration: \"More mail\nfor Mr. Loman....\"\n\nThe spark of Ed's propelling cylinder was almost too small to see as he\njetted to the heavy bundle of letters and rode up with the attendant,\npast the guards, and slid with a skittering envelope through a mail\nslot, and into Carter Loman's presence.\n\nHe was sprawled on a bed and was clad in full vacuum armor of a type\nheavier than would have been necessary even on a dead world. It was\npronged with special details as well: filaments, like parts of the\ninsides of a Midas Touch weapon. Hovering over the vast shape, Ed felt\nthe hard, stinging punch of a few scattered neutrons hitting his body\nbefore he ventured too close. Even though his own life was subatomic in\nprinciple, enough of those infinitesimal pellets could kill him. Loman\nhad evidently grown wary and nervous, guessing with shrewd imagination\nwhat dangers he might now face. In addition to his massive costume,\nthis android who hated his kind was wearing an aura of low-speed\nneutrons, constantly being projected from the filaments on his armor.\nJust then, the savagery inside Ed felt its bitter frustration. Loman\neven mistrusted the ban on space travel.\n\nThe enormous face beneath him, framed beyond the glaze of a helmet\nwindow, did not look at ease. Loman was muttering. He must have been at\nit, off and on, for a long time: \"I wouldn't be surprised if you were\naround, Prell. Or even you, Dukas. I was right! I know all about your\nlittle self, Prell. It was all in your dead brain. You think you'll\nplay a reverse David against Goliath, eh? If blasting out your lab\ndidn't kill you....\"\n\nNo, Ed Dukas was not so easily defeated. The aura of neutrons thrown\nout only by scattered filaments was probably not of continuous\nintensity. At certain points there might well be chinks in it, at which\ntime he could slip to close quarters without having his own nuclear\nmetabolism speeded up to the point of his destruction. But before he\ndid anything final, he had to find out where Prell's stolen equipment\nwas.\n\nEd felt the whir of the air-filtering apparatus in the room and smiled.\nAnd there was a television globe nearby. Ed could have found ways, now,\nto make his own tiny voice audible to his enemy and to challenge him.\nBut Ed decided against this for the present. He mustn't waste precious\ntime, yet he suspected that he could depend on the restlessness of a\nnervous foe not to wait here quietly very long.\n\nAgain he was right. Perched on a ledge made by an irregularity of the\nwall, Ed waited less than five minutes before Carter Loman jumped\nup from the bed, cursed, and dashed from the room. Ed's Midas Touch\ncylinder reddened in his hand as he jetted after him. Of firmer flesh\nthan other men, Loman hurried untiring, even in his massive armor and\nplastic helmet, down a back stairs, passing a hundred levels.\n\nThen he was in a small, powerful car racing along a civic speedway that\nEd remembered well. Clinging to plush that was like a dense forest\nunder him, Ed remained undislodged by the tornadoes of air that came\nfrom speed.\n\nAround him passed beauty that he used to know, expanded so enormously\nthat much of the familiar mood of it was lost; and he himself seemed\ncut off from it, like a ghost coming back. But there was other, perhaps\ngreater beauty, too--closer to the heart of what he was now. There'd\nbeen a controlled shower induced by the weather towers. Now the sun\nshone again, and the air sparkled, not with dust, but with countless\ntiny droplets of moisture--crystal globes, clear as lenses, but\nbreaking the sunshine into brilliant prismatic hues.\n\nEd's brief rambling of mind ended when Loman did an odd thing. He\nstopped in Ed's old neighborhood, after having passed a half-dozen road\nblocks where uniformed men had entrenched themselves, covering their\nugly vehicles with cut branches. Loman had only flashed his Interworld\nSecurity badge at each post, to receive respectful permission to go on.\n\nLoman stopped his car abruptly before a house adjacent to Ed's own--one\nEd knew well. But Ed had an odd feeling that this was not as strange as\nit seemed. This suburb, close to the City, harbored many of the noted\nand notorious. Besides, many recent turbulent events had been centered\nwithin these few hundred square miles. And Loman had been in the\nneighborhood before, in the company of Police Chief Bronson. Also, had\nthere always been something disturbingly familiar about Loman's manner?\n\nEd tingled at the unraveling of an enigma, as Loman hurried up the walk\nto the house. Loman found the door locked, but if this annoyed him, it\nstopped him not at all. An armored shoulder, backed up by the muscles\nof his kind--their power rarely demonstrated publicly--battered the\ndoor to splinters and Loman stepped through.\n\nEd followed him--as unobtrusive as part of the atmosphere--up a\nstairway and into a pleasant student room seen in colossal scale.\n\nIt was Les Payten's room which had thus been invaded without ceremony.\nNor was the intruding colossus the least abashed that the giant Les,\nsomewhat thinned down and pallid after his long convalescence from a\nvisit to Abel Freeman, was present.\n\nEd saw his old friend's startled expression, then felt the vibration of\nhis words: \"Chummy, aren't you, bursting in like this? The police, eh?\nWhat have _I_ done? My God, I've seen your picture! You're Loman!\"\n\nThe other giant's smirk was half gentle, half bullishly humorous.\n\"That's my name--if you prefer,\" he said. \"I've had you watched, Lester\nPayten, for various reasons. You've been ill. Then why do you stay so\nclose to what may become the battle lines? You're an odd guy, Lester.\nToo much fear, courage and conscience. Wanting to be a hero, but half\na martyr. Recently one of the 'reasonable' kind. Soon there won't\nbe any of those left. Not when a few more see those they love torn\nopen, crisped or perhaps crushed by created things more hideous than\nTyrannosaurus Rex. Such facts destroy the folly of thoughtfulness. And,\ngood! For in that way the showdown comes against another kind of slime\nthat desecrates the form of man! You're a mixed-up kid, Lester--maybe\neven thinking of some old companions. But in your heart you know that\nyou're all human. Me, I'm still sentimental, so I had to come to you at\nlast. You ought to be safe among the asteroids, like your timid mother.\"\n\nBeing an audience to these comments, Ed's first puzzlement changed\nslowly toward comprehension of a weird truth. Drifting with the air\nmolecules near the center of the room, he watched Les Payten sitting\nquietly at his desk, his look also showing that he was at the fringe\nof understanding. But maybe his mind half refused to plunge into the\nstarkness of fact beyond. Too much had become possible. Sometimes it\nmight be a land too strange for human wits.\n\nMaybe primitive terror prompted Les to sudden violence. Or it was the\nsickening cynicism in Loman's words. In a flash of movement Les tried\nto get a weapon from his desk. Confronted by a human being, he might\nhave succeeded. But Loman even dared, first, to shut off the neutronic\naura around his armor, so as not to burn or kill the one he had come to\nsee. Then quick fingers latched onto Les's wrists. Les fought with all\nhis might but was pushed down on the floor. Dazed, he looked up at his\nconqueror.\n\n\"Yes, your memory-man father killed himself,\" Loman said. \"But he\ncould always return by recording, couldn't he? Before that, it was\nall arranged--with many who sympathized with the human cause. The\nmind probe showed that my expressed views were truthful. Interworld\nSecurity could use someone who was clever, unknown, and supremely\nactive. Umhm-m--maybe I'm even harder than they hoped! Yes, I'm still\nan android, Les, because I have to be strong for battle. I hardly care\nwho learns of it now, because the fight is sure to come. But I'll be a\nman again, when and if I can. And, like a man, I love my son. Things\nwill become very difficult soon, Lester. So I want you with me.\"\n\nLoman's heavy growl might have sounded paternal to common ears. But he\ncapped it with a light tap to Les's jaw. Les crumpled. For a moment\nthis fantastic echo of his original sire, changed in face and form,\nstood over him, an armored demon by any standard.\n\nThe sun had set. From the twilight beyond the window came blue flashes,\nlight heat lightning, off toward the wooded hills. They glinted on\nLoman's plastic face window, which had muffled his words scarcely at\nall. Loman seemed to match those flickers: science misused; wisdom,\nonce reached for so carefully, fading; the collected armaments,\nimprovised quickly by a master technology hidden in tunnel and on\nmountain-top, by both sides. And the guts of a star ship engine\nperverted. Once, on a lost Moon, a thing like that had exploded, just\nby error or chance. There had been no wild speeches to bring it about.\nNor any panic. And there had been no Lomans to help in a more savage\nway.\n\nUnless driving impulses were checked, the end could come this very\nnight. Ed even wondered if he might waste valuable time sticking close\nto Loman any longer. Would it lead to more answers, as he had felt it\nmust? Well, he still was sure of that, and Loman also seemed driven by\nhaste. So Ed alighted on Les's shoulder and burrowed into the cloth.\nIt was the safest thing to do. For whatever weapon might be used, it\nprobably would not be directed at Les.\n\nLoman picked up the unconscious form and dashed out to his car. There\nfollowed a wild ride along winding roads through the woods. Distantly,\non a hilltop, Ed saw a metal framework slanting skyward. It held a\ncylinder whose neutron beam could level anything. But its power supply\ncould mean complete destruction in a last resort to madness, for\nrevenge--if someone lost control of himself, smashed the safety stops\non controls, pushed levers a little beyond them.\n\nThere were wrecks on the road. Horror had been exchanged already, as\nrefugees fled the City. Beside one broken car, half fused to a puddle\nof fire lay the body of a child, briefly glimpsed. And Ed detected\na man's cries and protests, flung wildly at the sky from among the\nshadowy trees. Or could it have come just as well from an android\nthroat?\n\nIf it was Jones of common human clay or Smith, an android, could it\nmake any difference? Yet it was an old thing--a reasonable man's\nanguish against wrong.\n\nStill, was it hard to see a sequel, when something snapped in the\nbrain? A kind of explosion. Then, before horror and rage, immortality\nor death could become equally meaningless. Good sense and kindness,\nonce clung to desperately, could then become zero, and Earth, sky\nand humanity empty phantoms. Then could you picture the wronged one\nawaiting someone of the other kind? Could you picture him aiming his\nown weapon at another car and holding its trigger down until his own\ncurses were lost in the roar of incandescence?\n\nEd Dukas rode on through the dusk in Loman's car, still clinging to\nthe fabric at the shoulder of his inert friend, Les Payten. The sky\nstill flickered--warning barrages, not yet aimed to kill. An aircraft\nswooped, its weapons shredding a high-flying horror that was not\nof metal. Some had been destroyed, but others always came--though\nthey never had been truly numerous. A few other cars sped along the\nroad--persons fleeing the dangerous congestion of the City.\n\nEd wondered if the steady _ping ping ping_ in his quartz-chip radio\nwas the ultra-sonic evidence of a spy beam in action, perhaps meant to\ntrace Loman's course? At last the forces of law might do that to their\nown, if some of them disagreed with Loman's zeal or suspected that it\nhad become too extreme. Chief Bronson, for one, had seemed a likable\nman. Besides, even after a mind probe, many would mistrust an android.\n\nEd reasoned that this must be a flight to a hide-out, which he had to\nsee.\n\nThe car careened for a mile along a narrow side road, where, behind\nhigh banks, the pinging stopped. Had Loman counted on their shielding\neffect? Deeper in the woods, a block of undergrowth folded upward on\na hinge, and the car rolled inside. Then the great trap door closed\nbehind it. Ed was not surprised even by so elaborate a retreat as\nthis. Now, with his neutronic aura cut off, Loman bore Les through a\nlow doorway, into a great, low chamber fused out of bedrock. Could\nLoman and Mitchell Prell be as alike as this in their choice of secret\nplaces? Queer--and yet not so queer. Both were scientists. Prell had\ninvaded the field of biology and Loman, in his original incarnation as\nRonald Payten, had been a biologist from the start.\n\nEd might have attacked, now that Loman's aura was inactive. But it\ncould be restored in an instant. Better to wait. A clearer chance might\nwell come. His enemy might even be trying to lure any small, unseen\nintruder close to the coils of the aura.\n\nBesides, in the soft artificial light, answers lay--answers that Ed\nhad only dimly suspected, in spite of Loman's background. Since he\nhad learned who Loman was, there hadn't been time enough for him to\nunderstand. But now the solution to a dreadful mystery came easily,\nbecause Ed could intrude here unseen.\n\nThere were vats here, too, vaster than any Ed had ever seen from any\nviewpoint and webbed with their attendant apparatus. Beneath the glossy\nsurface of the fluid, like smooth oceans in the floor, various shapes\nwere visible--all devilish but half transparent in their undeveloped\nstate, their smooth plates of vitaplasm muscle and scale showing, but\nalready alive and in slight, undulating motion. And no doubt these\nthings were only in the embryonic state. They could grow much huger\nafter being set free to hide and kill. Here, then, was the devil's\nbrewpot of creation. Here the first slithering synthetic monsters must\nhave been blueprinted and created. It was Ronald Payten's work--the\nproduct of his skill and his secret quirks. Madness in vitaplasm, to\nhelp build hate between android and man and bring the conflict to a\nclimax.\n\nAnd there was more. Against one wall was the plunder of Mitchell\nPrell's laboratory on Mars--or most of it. The tanks were empty.\nBut on a table stood the larger microscope, as if what could be seen\nthrough its eye-piece had been under examination. Perhaps the doll-like\nshape, the other vats, the machine shop and that tiny electron\nmicroscope were still there. And what lay at a still lower size level.\nAcross such a void of distance, Ed Dukas could not see such detail. But\nhe felt the mingling of hope and frustration. No path back to normal\ncircumstances was here, yet. And the time was certainly not ripe--if it\nwould ever come. Besides, did all of him really want to return, even if\npart of him fairly ached for it?\n\nCarter Loman, or Ronald Payten, bent close to Les, his pronged helmet\nand wide face, beyond the curve of plastic and radiation shielding,\nlike an ugly world in the sky. But if you had the mind to notice,\nperhaps Loman's expression was almost gentle just then. His voice came\nto Ed's senses as a subdued and modulated quake: \"Lester! Wake up! I\ndidn't hit you that hard.\"\n\nLes seemed to have been lowered onto a couch of some kind. Perhaps\nhe had already regained consciousness moments ago and had since been\nbent on quiet scrutiny of his surroundings, seeking out comprehension\nand the core of his own feelings. Ed could guess at some of this: an\nenigma revealed; Ronald Payten--creator of monsters; Les Payten's\npseudo-father. Then, for Les, horror, shame, fury.\n\nFor Ed, the world seemed to rock as Les leaped. Les was not strong now\nand was still in his convalescence. And maybe he had been wavering and\nunsure, or even wrong in his past choices. But at this moment he was\nnot at all in doubt, though the attack he made could have been pure,\nwild fright.\n\n\"Father, indeed! I'll kill you--_Phony!_\" he screamed. Then he was\ngrappling with Loman with all the strength that muscle and emotion\ncould muster.\n\nFor that moment at least, he was Ed Dukas's ally, willing or otherwise.\nFor he held Loman's attention diverted. And because of Les's attack\nLoman's neutronic aura remained turned off.\n\nEd leaped and jetted, his tiny Midas Touch a scarcely visible spark as\nit flamed. He landed on the fabric near the back of Loman's neck and at\nthe base of his helmet. Holding tight, Ed let his weapon flare again,\nthis time using it to blast a tiny hole. He braved the violent spurt\nof energy from the dissolving rubberized fabric and then the moment of\nexposure to radiation and heat as he crept through. Now he floated in\nLoman's private atmosphere, within the great oxygen helmet, as Loman's\nstruggle with Les went on.\n\nNow was the time to test a plan: the speck-sized man against a being\nof human dimensions--comparatively as huge as a mountain. And it was\nandroid against android, advantage against advantage.\n\nLoman's lungs, active now to give breath to a chuckle of triumph,\nbreathed Ed in deeply. With his full equipment still lashed to his\nshoulders, he tumbled down through moist and faintly ruddy gloom. When\nthe air currents quieted, he clung, a sharp splinter of obsidian rising\nand falling in his hand, as he cut through soft tissue.\n\nThus he reached a small artery and was borne along by the flow\nwithin it. It was a world of warm, buried rivers. Dim, rosy light\nsometimes found its way through the walls of flesh. Or was it, still\nthe radioactive glow that Loman's body, adapting to the shortage of\noxygen, had shown on Mars? But its physical structure, apart from its\nsubstance, remained human: the disklike red blood corpuscles pumped\nalong in the gloom.\n\nOnly wait now to be circulated to the right position. Ed knew when he\npassed the great thumping valves and chambers of Loman's heart. But,\nno, this was not the place for action. He could feel himself rising\nnow. Good! Was the darkness within the skull denser than elsewhere?\nEd forced his way into constantly narrowing channels. Around him he\nstill saw very dimly the living cells themselves. Here they had long,\ninterlocking filaments. They were the brain cells, beyond question.\n\nHe dared not use his Midas Touch here. The fluid at its very muzzle\nwould have exploded. But he had grenades of much the same function. Set\nthe fuse of one and leave it lodged here.\n\nBefore Ed was pumped back to the huge lungs, he felt the heavy\nconcussion. Then came the wild gyrations of the colossus. A spark of\natomic incandescence had exploded within its head, opening arteries to\nhemorrhage and destroying surrounding tissue with heat and radiation.\nA demoniac vitality of body might linger on, but a mind was dead. Had\ntotal death come quickly, all movement ceasing, Ed might have had to\ntunnel his way tediously from the gigantic corpse.\n\nBut his luck held out. He reached the lungs, and a great burst of air\nflung him forth into the oxygen helmet again.\n\nLoman's form still twitched on the floor. One enemy was erased from the\nimmediate future at least. Loman--or the pseudo Ronald Payten--had been\nremoved as an active force of history, but the fury he had helped stir\nup was by now self-sustaining. Ed gave him a brief, almost rancorless\nthought. A woman had lost her husband in the Moonblast. And he was\nher memory re-created. She had had reason to hate science. And he had\nbeen warped and marked by her view. He was a bitter product of his\ntimes--impossible in the centuries that came before. Ed knew that he\nhimself--as he was now, certainly--was also the child of his era. His\nuncle must always have been that. Babs--wherever she was now--was also\nof these years. And his dad, and countless others. Maybe, therein you\nhad to find a tiny spark of tolerance for Loman, though not much. And\nwould anyone ever want to bring him back to life, even if the world\nwent on existing?\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nEd's score stood at two points gained--Loman out of the way and the\nsource of the monsters revealed. But these were small victories\ncompared with what must be gained if there was to be any hope. Masses\nof human beings and androids faced each other, their emotions inflamed\nto the point of final folly. And the end of one troublemaker and the\nrevelation of his tools were small items beside all that.\n\nEd got out of Loman's oxygen helmet the way he had entered. Les Payten,\na dazed Atlas, was stumbling around. Ed felt cut off from his old\nfriend by a strange, great distance. But he could talk to him at least.\n\nEd floated to the radio in a corner of the workshop, found his way\nthrough a vent in its back, and touched a wire with the minute contact\npoints of a crude microphone as large as his hand. The infinitesimal\nelectric currents it bore were amplified and converted into sound. Ed's\nvoice came forth loud and clear: \"Les! It's me--Ed Dukas. I'm here,\njust as Prell came to me once. I'm an android just a few thousandths of\nan inch tall. I'm inside the radio, Les. First, I want to know how you\nfeel about all this. Yes, I killed Loman.\"\n\nThere were world tremors of footsteps approaching with slow caution.\nA panel of the set was opened. The giant stared inside. Ed was now\nsufficiently accustomed to the vibrations of human speech to interpret\nthe mood behind them.\n\nThere was a brief, hard chuckle, controlled and distant and unfriendly.\n\n\"Yes, Dukas, I'm quite sure it's as you say. It's odd, maybe, but I'm\nnot surprised at all. In our time, you have to accept too much. Thanks\nfor finishing Loman--not my father. Dad died on the lunar blowup, as\nyou know, a victim of technology or history, as we all will probably\nsoon be. I've told you before how I feel about everything. And what\nhas happened to me tonight can scarcely have made my view of the\nandroids any kinder. Once upon a time, in my callow youth, I thought\nI belonged to this crazy period. How wrong can you get? You take your\nstrength and durability. I wonder what finer flavors of life you've\nlost. So there's my standard, and I'll live and die by it, Dukas. It's\nsad to lose a pal, but as you are, I guess you'll have to be an enemy.\nIt's like an instinct, Dukas.\"\n\nLes had spoken calmly and firmly. But Ed sensed the bitterness and\nuncertainty that lurked beneath the words.\n\n\"I won't argue, Les,\" he answered. \"But when I'm thinking straight, the\ntruth to me is still as it was. In championing man above android, or\nvice versa, you can only come to zero. Only in fair play between them\nis there a chance. So, if the urge ever comes over you, you might still\ndo me a favor. Across this room is a microscope and attached equipment\nthat are vital to me and to Barbara, who is like me, somewhere. Guard\nit, Les. No place that you could reach is perhaps truly safe for it.\nBut I was thinking that if you could gamble again--as we all must--you\nmight take it to Abel Freeman. I know that you were almost killed in\nhis camp, Les. But I believe that the old reprobate is fundamentally\nsound and not as bitterly against such a device as some human beings\nmight be. Thanks if you consider it, Les.\"\n\nStill unseen by his one-time friend, Ed jetted to the vaulted ceiling\nand escaped through a ventilator pipe that emerged among concealing\nbushes. He rose above the trees, and a night wind pushed him on, while\nhe listened to the quartz chip he carried. His first impulse now was to\nlocate Tom Granger as his next candidate for silence.\n\nIt was not necessary. The news was on the air: \"Granger was stricken in\nhis quarters just before eight o'clock. The cause is not yet clear. He\nhad just begun to write his new speech: 'I am frightened. We are all\nfrightened. But this can change nothing of our purpose. In vitaplasm\nwe are confronted by a vampirish fact: an identity of face masking a\ndifference of spirit. A treachery. A slow, dreadful encroachment....'\"\n\nPrell had gotten to Granger, then. If this was murder, maybe it was\njustified--if Earth was one per cent less in danger with one exhorter\nquieted, for a while if not forever. But what had been accomplished so\nfar was small beside the threat that had been stirred up in many minds\nand machines across the countryside.\n\nThe sky was heavy with thickening clouds. Weather Control, working\nthrough its ionic towers had already been smashed. The night was\nalternately a Stygian hole or a glare-lit holocaust full of battering\nvibrations which might mean that real battle had already begun. So\nfar, only neutron streams were being used. Where a mountain peak was\nhit there would be a blaze of light that even an android had better\nnot look at. Then another mountain, looming over a different fortified\nline, would flare up and glow with moving lava. And the power that\nenergized the weapons was the same as that which could reach the stars.\n\nRising high and jetting forward with his Midas Touch, Ed went to work.\nHe thought of Abel Freeman's camp, which lay somewhere beyond the\ncarpet of flaming woods which flanked one slope. But that was not his\nimmediate destination now. He had dived for a power station house in a\ngreat trailer--and did it matter whether it belonged to the older race\nor the newer? He took great risks getting into its busy vitals. The\nconstricting pressure of space warps, creating a gravity pressure of\nbillions of tons to the square inch, eased gradually. A marble-sized\nbit of super-dense matter, crushed and compressed by the force and\nhidden by its opaqueness, began to expand to meter-wide size and to\nlose its blinding heat and fury as the processes within it stopped.\nSoon the power plant, turning out a flood of electricity out of all\nproportion to its small size, ceased to function. Scattered atoms of\nhydrogen and lithium became inert.\n\nThere was no easily visible cause for the breakdown, until puzzled\neyes found minute holes burned in vacuum tubes, allowing air to enter,\noxidizing grids and filaments and stopping their action.\n\nTwo great weapons died, their energy cut off. But the power stations\nthemselves were the far greater threat, for they harbored that\nsun-stuff within them. Now the controls of one, which some enraged\nperson might contrive to push too far in spite of the watchfulness of\nothers, were temporarily useless.\n\nWorking both sides of the line, Ed sabotaged another energy source, and\nanother. Then he lost count, not because of a high score, but because\nheat and radiation had fogged his mind somewhat. Yet he kept at his\nlabors because there was no other way. Within every square mile there\nwas enough potential power to end his planet.\n\nAround him, curses came vibrating from giants: \"Men, eh? Jelly for\ninsides!...\" \"Stinking Phonies--Hell-born or Prell-born!... Jim, I\nwas wondering, this fizz-out looks fishy. Do you suppose the bastards\n_have_ something?\"\n\nThe front had quieted. It could be that, as far as he had gone, Ed\nhad actually held the Earth together by spiking a few danger points.\nBut he could take no pride for himself out of this. The job could go\non and on, like a few buckets of water poured on a forest fire. It\nhelped briefly, yet if there had been a thousand like him, but truly\nindestructible, the situation might still be without promise. The mass\nof the populace was too enormous and scattered; the natural suspicion\nand the forces which had stirred it up were too deep. The ghosts of\nLoman and Granger still walked in memory and maybe now in martyrdom.\nAnd the technology was still there. So Ed knew that, unless there was\nanother way, he could only go on attempting to lessen a threat, until\nheat and radiation or its fulfillment zeroed him out.\n\nIt took him over an hour to stop one power station because his demoniac\nvitality was ebbing and because it had begun to rain heavily. The great\ndrops could not kill him, but like falling lakes, they could hammer\nhim into the mud, from which it might take days for him to extricate\nhimself. He waited in the shelter of a loose bit of bark on the trunk\nof a tree. There he felt the helpless side of his smallness.\n\nAs he waited, his mind rambled. Had several groups of weapons quit\nwithout his noticing, or was this only something that he wished were\nso? Where was Barbara now? Would he ever see her again?... Now he lost\nhimself in a fantasy. He saw them leaving Earth's atmosphere the way\nthey had come--she and he together; maybe finding beauty and peace\nout there. Perhaps there were even tiny worlds--meteors--inhabited by\ncrystalline things such as they had once seen but advanced to a state\nwhere they could think and build, and be friendly.\n\nAnd, almost wistfully, he thought of another idyl--his father's, and\neven Granger's, among millions of others. He could almost see the crude\ncharm of the houses, the gardens and the flocks. But how did one erect\na wall against science--with science? It seemed harder to do than\ndiking the water out of the deepest ocean and trying to live in the\nhole thus made.\n\nThe rain ended. Ed was air-borne again. He caused one more power\nstation to break down. But there were others. And some that he had\nspiked might already be repaired. And from his quartz chip he heard\nother exhorting voices--not Granger's, but like Granger's. The old and\nhuman traits that Granger had represented could go on without him,\nfighting maturer thoughts as if in a drive toward suicide. Who could be\neverywhere, to quiet such clamoring?\n\nIn the darkness before dawn, Ed felt desperate and hopeless. His mind\nwas on Abel Freeman again--the memory man, somebody's cockeyed family\nlegend. It was an instinctive thing to seek out the strong for advice,\nfor discussion and perhaps for a joining of forces.\n\nEd had only part of an energy cartridge left for his Midas Touch. But\nthis was more than enough to jet him across the mountains to the camp\nof the quaint android chieftain with whom he must now admit a kinship\nof flesh. Freeman was certainly a local leader now among those of\nthe same mark who had fled from the City, where the population was\npredominantly of the old kind. Technicians, craftsmen, specialists of\nevery sort, would be among Freeman's following.\n\nJust as first daylight began, Ed drifted over the vast, hodge-podge\nencampment hidden in the woods and the marshes. Part of the ground it\ncovered had been fused to hot, glassy consistency, perhaps by a small\naerial bomb. Maybe a hundred Phonies had died there--which fact added\nnothing to the cause of peace.\n\nAbel Freeman himself was not too hard to find, for he occupied a\ncentral, commanding position among various equipment housed in great\ntrailers carefully concealed from any observer in an aircraft. But\nAbel Freeman, true to his legend, was sitting inside a rude shelter of\nboughs, which effectively concealed the light of his ato lamp. Before\nhim was a sensipsych training device and a vast pile of books on many\nsubjects, ranging from military tactics to atomics, on which he was\nobviously endeavoring to get caught up. He was savagely intent upon\nbook learning, for which he had little aptitude. But Ed, seeing him\nin mountainous proportions, was perhaps better able than others to\nunderstand why androids in need of leadership flocked to his stamping\ngrounds. Abel Freeman looked like the essence of rough and ready\nability. Among android leaders, he was certainly the greatest.\n\nFreeman had a small radio receiver beside him. Ed Dukas did not try to\nread the meaning of its blaring vibrations, for he was aware of their\ngeneral tone. To him the instrument was chiefly a possible bridge of\ncommunication between himself and Freeman.\n\nBut Ed was not now given the chance to make such contact. For something\nelse happened. From the pages of an opened book in Abel Freeman's hands\ncoiled a thread of smoke, as charred words were written rapidly across\nthe paper. Ed was close enough in the air to read them, too: \"_I am\nMitchell Prell, who helped make your kind possible. I am one of you\nnow--though undersize. Help keep the peace. Make no moves to start\ntrouble._\"\n\nEd himself was startled. His uncle was here, then! They had arrived at\nalmost the same time. And Prell had chosen a more dramatic means of\ncommunication--not ink, not an amplified voice, but the spiderweb-thin\nbeam of his Midas Touch used as a long stylus, while he clung, perhaps,\nto a hair on the back of Freeman's hand!\n\nFor an instant, Abel Freeman was gripped by surprise. But then, with\nrattlesnake-swift movement, his own Midas Touch was in his hand. His\nwhole self seemed to take on the smooth flow of perfect alertness which\nnothing but an utterly refined machine could have equaled.\n\n\"Prell or a liar?\" he challenged. \"Or Prell with a conscience--for his\nown first people and against his brain children? Yes, I've heard how\nlittle you might be now.\"\n\nEd had only glimpsed his uncle far off among the scattered motes of the\nair--another mote among them--a foot away he must be, at least. But Ed\nhadn't waited for contact. Instead he darted quickly inside Freeman's\nradio, touched the contacts of his microphone to the proper surface,\nand spoke: \"Maybe you'll remember me, too, Freeman. I'm Dukas, Prell's\nnephew. You and I have talked before, man to man. Prell is no liar. And\nthe conscience is there--for everybody, android or otherwise. Yes, I'm\nwith him, the same size. And there's a problem, everybody's problem,\nthe toughest one that I've ever heard of. So where do we get any answer\nthat makes sense? Some of it has got to come quickly, I'm afraid,\nFreeman.\"\n\nAmplified, Ed's voice had boomed out till it was like an earthquake\nto him. Once again a plastic box was opened above him and a gigantic\nface was overhead. In the tinkling overtones of smallness, there was\nalmost a silence for a moment. Then came the rattle of Freeman's hard,\namused laugh, as he said, \"I'll be damned! Smaller than snuff and made\nthe cheap way. People. Something better. Yep, it must be so, even if\nI can't even see you. That puts us way ahead, I guess. And it ain't a\nwhisky vision. Well, I guess it still don't make any difference. The\nold-time kind of folks hate us, and they'll never stop while both of us\nand them are alive. And us Phonies have been crowded all we can take.\nThey've fired on us here, just barely trying to miss. Could be we've\ndone the same to them. It's a mighty ticklish proposition. In winktime\nthey could finish us all here, nice and clean and no grease left. So\ncould we burn them quicker than gunpowder. So who gets trigger crazy\nand does it first? We've fixed them: an answer, under the ground. Maybe\nthey can spoil our other weapons, like it seems they can, but not this\none. It's buried deep enough. Let 'em try to hit us hard, and it'll\nset everything off. Your old Moonblast will be beat a thousand times.\nUs Phonies are bullheaded. We were made on Earth, same as them. It's\nours as much as theirs. We came alive, and we can fade out again, young\nfella!\"\n\nThe vibrations of Freeman's tones rose and fell, with humor, fatalism\nand stubbornness. Two races, one born of the knowledge originated by\nthe other, seemed to have driven each other into corners of no return.\nAt some indefinite instant, the Big Zero would come.\n\nEd saw this garish picture more clearly than ever before. His strange\nlittle body fairly quivered with it. He looked at Mitchell Prell, who\nhad come beside him now, where the pieces of apparatus that made up the\ninterior of a small receiving set loomed, and he saw in his face the\npuzzled, tired fear of a scientist whose researches had always aimed at\ndoing good. Just then Ed Dukas, micro-android, was far from separated\nfrom the Big Earth as he used to know it. So now, in desperation, he\nclutched at a vision which had once seemed almost a fact.\n\n\"Freeman,\" he said, \"maybe men can't back down or co-operate with\nsupermen. Doing that can seem like embracing extinction. But hasn't\nthere always been an obvious thing for _us_ to do?\"\n\n\"Umhm-m--you mean _we_ should back down,\" Freeman replied softly.\n\"Set out for the wide-open spaces that we were meant for. Leave the\npoor clodhoppers behind. Young fella, could be that you and me see\nthings bigger. For others like us, it ought to be like that, only it\nain't--yet. Most of the new people are butcher, baker and candlestick\nmaker, Earth-born, and Earth-tied in their minds, like anybody. There's\na ship, sure. But the stars are still awful far off, and never touched,\nand you can go addled just thinkin' about them. Lots of our sort would\nleave in their own sweet time, same as regular folks, sure. It's in\ntheir blood. You might say they got wings. But who really knows how to\nuse 'em yet? And crowd our kinfolks off their home world? When they're\nspunky and sore like any human being? Nope. Sorry!\"\n\nEd's faint hope faded before the old android's realism. For years the\nmovement of migration had been farther and farther outward into space.\nIt was at once a fact, a dream and a philosophy, like getting nearer\nto the Eternal Unknown. But most of the worth-while solar system was\nalready owned by the original dominant species. Beyond was only the\ndistance, not a beaten path at all, an untried and fearsome novelty.\nOne star ship was about completed, yes. Fast it would be, but its speed\nwould still fall far short of the velocity of light. So the nearer\nstars were decades, centuries, millenniums away.\n\nAn idea so familiar that it seems almost an accomplished fact can\nlose some of its charm in the hard glare of real obstacles. Ed felt\nsomething like a chill inside him. Though he knew the strangeness of a\nmicro-cosmic viewpoint, others did not have this training and boldness\nfor the unknown. He saw the majority of them balking fatally. But he\nstill had to try _something_, to change as much of this as he could--if\nhe could change any of it at all.\n\n\"I don't know whether or not to blame you and the others for the\nrevenge you say is rigged here and elsewhere, Freeman,\" he said. \"I can\nsee why both sides felt driven to do it. But I'm going to borrow your\nnewscast facilities, Freeman. Or someone else's. Because rumor can be a\npowerful force. And I think I can give it a little push.\"\n\nMitchell Prell was still beside him. His grin was encouraging and sly.\n\"Best of luck in what you intend, Eddie,\" he remarked. \"Need a charge\nfor your Midas Touch?... Meanwhile, I might try drawing the teeth\nof some dragons, as you seem to have been doing. Got to be careful,\nthough, that both sides don't blame each other and get nervous.\nGranger, poor knothead, was easy. I hope that somehow circumstances\nwill be right so that he can come back and learn. About Loman and the\nthings he made, I can feel differently.\"\n\n\"You heard?\" Ed asked.\n\n\"It was on the air,\" Prell replied. \"Somebody phoned the news in from\nnear that lab. At least the overwise ones will know that they guessed\nwrong about which faction contrived a biological horror: a rabid\nold-race sympathizer, but an android, too! Can that make either side\nproud?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA minute later Ed landed on the roof of the trailer which housed\nFreeman's wireless equipment. He crept past an immense drop of rain\nwater that loomed like a rounded mesa beside him and entered a vent.\nSoon he touched the terminals of his microphone to the proper contacts.\nThe transmitter was active. During the first pause between the temblors\nof other words and signals and coded information, Ed spoke quickly,\nhalf like a mischievous sprite. \"This is no ghost voice. We hear that\nmany androids want to take all of their kind beyond the solar system.\"\n\nThe station did not stop sending at once. Blame that on the startled\nmonitor, who must have been listening. Ed took advantage of his\nopportunity. He was granted another moment to speak: \"It is only\nnatural that they should want to do that. Their kind of vigor matches\nthe stars. They don't need, or really want, the Earth. Their departure\nin peace could be a perfect answer to everything.\"\n\nThat much Ed got out before the transmitter clicked to silence. He knew\nhe hadn't said anything original and that he had pushed an argument\nintensely, like a high-pressure salesman without full belief. What he\nhad said was the way things should be, perhaps, but were not. Yet,\nagain, like a romantic kid, had he felt the glamorous impact of his own\nwords?\n\nHe was aware that androids would hear and millions of the old\nrace--intent on communications from an enemy station--as well. A\nmysterious, informal voice was always a thing to draw attention, and\nhis remarks had been rather startling. That they would be repeated and\ndiscussed a thousand times from other stations was probable. For they\nwere like a chink of hope in one of two granite walls of obstinate\nrighteousness and strength.\n\nBut Ed decided that he'd build no bright pictures of what his speech\nwould accomplish but would wait for hard facts. He wished desperately\nthat he'd had a moment more to speak on the transmitter, to call out\nBarbara's name.\n\nNow he drifted again in a morning sunshine. Luck had held out this\nfar at least. But over woods and crude shelters and hidden equipment\nand grimy grim-faced hordes that looked as human as refugees could,\nthere were interruptions that denied optimism. A patrolling rocket\nship sailed high; an intensified neutron beam turned a finger of air\nwhite hot behind it--very close. And mountaintops, already truncated\nand smoking, still would flare up dazzlingly. Android muscles and backs\nstrained and bent to build fortifications as nothing merely human\ncould. The toilers were both men and women. Could android children cry?\nYes, some did.\n\nAnother thing happened. Ed, floating unseen low in the air, felt the\nbuzz of shouts and cries. A man who seemed to be near collapse was\nbeing helped forward by a youth whose sidearms dangled near the knees\nof his torn dungarees. At a little distance, where size seemed more\nas it used to be, Ed saw that the exhausted man was Les Payten. He was\nmud from head to foot; his face and arms were bloodied by brambles, his\nsuit was a rag.\n\nHe was brought straight to Abel Freeman's shelter. There, supported by\nthe armed youth, he spoke his piece: \"I'm here again, Freeman, because\na friend of mine asked me to bring you something for him. Does that\nmake me a fool? I know it does. Because he's only my remembrance of a\nfriend now. Damn you all!\"\n\nLes Payten fainted. A package wrapped in a plastic sheath fell from\nhis hands, but Abel Freeman caught it. A couple of Abel's ornery sons\nlooked on, exchanging puzzled scowls. Freeman warned them away with a\nclenched fist, knotty as an oaken club, and then shouted, \"Nancy! Oh,\nNancy-y-y!\" But there was no time for Ed to observe Freeman's hellion\ndaughter functioning as a nurse. He went inside Freeman's radio again,\nand spoke, \"Freeman, this is Dukas. I came to you to give and receive\nhelp. That means that I've tried to guess right about you. I believe I\nhave. When your neo-biologists examine what Payten has brought, they\nwill be able to guess its value to me and mine. And I think that they\nwill be able to combine its uses with those of their own equipment for\nsomething I'd like to see done. But there are other matters. Some of\nyour power plants broke down, but so did others across the line. I did\nmost of that. Prell must be doing more of it right now. What I said\nover your wireless was meant to gain a little time.\"\n\nEd paused. Freeman did not open the radio case again. Ed couldn't see\nhim. He could only feel small thuds and clinkings--the android leader\nopening the package that Les Payten had brought. Ed wondered if he\ncould ever imagine what was going on in Freeman's head, the thousand\nproblems and feelings that must be seething there.\n\nFreeman might be no good at book learning. And his roots were in a\ncentury when even a flying machine was a wild thought. But he had to\nbe shrewd to match the legend behind him. And he had to take tough\nsituations with a light shrug for the same reason.\n\nFinally Ed felt the rumble of his chuckle. \"You mean I'm one of your\n'reasonable' variety,\" he said. \"Meantime you smash my stuff, eh,\nlittle bug in the air! I ought to get damn unreasonable! You might even\nfinish me off! I'm kind of curious about that! But I don't think you\nhave to bother. I know that the old-time folks are moving lots more\nhell machines up. And they're awful mad, because we got quite a few of\nthem in one place last night--sort of by miscalculation. What's this\ntalk about us androids matching the stars? Well, young fella, go 'head\nand talk some more. Yep, on our wireless rig. What's left to lose? And\nI'm still curious.\"\n\nOn the way to the radio trailer, Ed looked back to the ugly, humping\nshapes of weapons creeping up a high, blackened slope a few miles away.\nThis was fresh action by men of the old kind who had lost friends\nor family and who saw no future in a demoniac succession. They were\nexposed, an easy target. But if they were destroyed, others would\ncome. So they dared and defied, and the vicious spiral toward Big Zero\ncontinued to mount.\n\nEd tried to forget this for a moment. His first words by wireless were\na call for his wife: \"Babs, this is Ed, at Freeman's camp! Barbara,\ncome to us if you can. At least, try to communicate with us. You know\nhow. Barbara!...\"\n\nShe had her own quartz chip, active all the time, so she must hear! And\nif she did, she could send a message just as he did, from some other\nstation. But though Ed now had help, at Freeman's orders, no reply\nfrom his wife was sifted from the countless communications that were\nreceived.\n\nBut his previous attempt to spread a rumor had brought some expected\nresults. The morning air was full of conflicting comments: \"... A cruel\njoke ... Psychological warfare ... Perhaps, but what if the Phonies\nmean to leave? Some already deny it.... Who spoke? Let him speak\nagain.\"\n\nEd was glad to oblige, even revealing his name, his present dimensions\nand how a being of such size, equipped with a Midas Touch, might wreck\na power station. He explained this last item because he did not want a\nmisplaced blame to stir up more tension on both sides. Otherwise, he\naddressed himself mostly to the androids, aware that the old race would\nlisten, too.\n\n\"... We were made on Earth, but not _for_ Earth. We were meant to go\nmuch farther. Since we have so much, to be other than generous would be\nstupid. We have peace and the future, and most of what man ever hoped\nfor, in our hands. That, or oblivion for everyone.\"\n\nThough the ominous movement on the burned-out slope continued, the\nactual flash of weapons seemed suspended. The quiet was either\npromising or it was ominous.\n\nHe was lulled into enough confidence so that at noon he took a break.\nHe went back to Freeman's shelter and into the tiniest workshop that\nMitchell Prell had made and that Les Payten had rescued. He dropped\nfrom the air beside minute machines and the vats that had given Barbara\nand him their micro-android forms on Mars.\n\nThe whole piece--the greater microscope together with all the much\nlesser equipment--Abel Freeman had unwrapped hastily, so that entry\ninto the twilight within the plastic cover had been easy. Freeman\nhimself was not around.\n\nFor a moment Ed felt alone and wistful, clinging to the rough glass\nfloor of the shop. But then he saw a faintly luminous elfin figure.\n\n\"Barbara!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHer laughter tinkled. \"Think I wasn't come back, Eddie?\" she teased.\n\"That I couldn't share any interest in what happens to a big world?\"\nHer blitheness almost angered him. Her expression sobered at once, and\nhe saw that she looked worn. \"I know,\" she said. \"It's not funny. We\nmight have burned up with the Earth--far apart. But I kept busy. I\ntried to call you yesterday from a station in the City. But I wasn't\nsure I touched the proper contacts. And last night I had to be a good\nsaboteur. I got three weapon-feeding power houses--though I guess that\nthe fine equipment could be shielded against us easily enough. Later,\nI was lost--high up in the wind. With you along, it could have been\nwonderful. Of course, I heard news broadcasts. About Loman's lab. And\nfrom Freeman's station, a report of how Les arrived with a strange\ndevice. This morning I heard your call, but there was no way to answer.\nEddie, Freeman's experts could copy us in normal size quite easily and\nquickly, couldn't they? And in better vitaplasm. The methods have been\nimproved. Our personal recordings, perhaps lost, wouldn't be needed.\nShould we try to have it done? Then there'd be two of each of us, in\ndifferent sizes. Two....\"\n\nEd chuckled. \"Not a word about returning to the old flesh, eh?\" he\nsaid. \"So have we learned? Android freedom to go anywhere, to be almost\nanything. Yep, magic almost. I think you'd rather perch on thistledown\nor a sunset cloud, or be pushed by light pressure, like sleeping\nspores, to a thousand light-years away! Well, it _could_ still happen.\nPart of us has been changed enough by things like that to belong there.\nBut the older part seems much like it was and belongs to the size plane\nthat we first knew about.\"\n\nThey hugged each other and laughed. And they were reassured by the\ncomparative calm around them. But the forces were still there, only\nawaiting someone's ultimate madness. And what can a world's end be\nlike, coming in a split instant, to one's dissolving senses? Certainly\nit must be a quick, almost trivial experience.\n\nEd became aware of a bluish flicker. Then there was something like an\nawful thud; he could scarcely tell whether a crash of sound took part\nin it or not. Around him everything was dazzling whiteness, without\nshadow or form. Then there was nothing.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nConsciousness came back to him, bringing a cloudy surprise. Rough rocky\nwalls were around him. This was an artificial cavern crowded with\nneo-biological equipment, most of which he could recognize. He lay\nfirmly on a hard couch contrived of planks and a folded blanket, part\nof the latter covering him. A pair of dungarees and a mended shirt had\nbeen tossed casually across his bare torso.\n\nSomeone who looked like a young medico laughed near him.\n\n\"One week's time, Dukas--that's all we need now for a major\ntransformation,\" he said. \"You must have thought that we were all\ngoners; it would have seemed like that to you. But it was just a freak\nattempt at sniping from the hills, with a Midas Touch focused to a thin\nbeam. Whoever tried it must have been aiming at our chief's shelter.\nOnly he wasn't there! Still down in miniature, you were caught in the\nbacklash of the blast. But it only knocked you out and singed you a\nlittle. You kept holding onto some solid object. Your wife and the\nequipment were scarcely hurt at all. Then Prell showed up again. They\ntalked with our chief the way you did before. They engineered the\ntransformation. I thought you'd want to know all this quickly.\"\n\nThe youthful android looked good-humoredly awed. \"They just stepped\nout,\" he added. \"They'll be back in a minute.\"\n\nEd began to slide into his dungarees. He was grateful for his return\nto something like what he had been. His memories of an interlude when\npeople were mountain tall were clear, yet they didn't seem quite to\nbelong to himself.\n\nHe thought briefly of how he must have been brought back to normal\nsize--his micro-form in one of the vats of similar proportions acting\nas a pattern, electronic brain and all. In another vat, which Freeman's\nspecialists had connected, the gelatins must have filmed and solidified\nslowly, taking shape, while in brain cells and filaments--different\nfrom electronic swirls but capable of assuming the same connecting\narrangements--a personality was reproduced without destroying the\npattern. With Barbara and Prell it had been the same.\n\n\"The world goes on, I see,\" Ed remarked.\n\nThe android biologist smiled wryly. \"Some of that is your fault,\nDukas,\" he said. \"A matter of advertising. You made enough old-timers\nhalf believe that the Earth will go on being theirs. That cooled them\noff some. As for our kind, what you said started lots of them thinking\nagain along what ought to be a natural track. Certainly the prompt\ndeparture of almost all of us is the only answer that can _really_\nsolve anything. Yes, if that isn't far too large an order! Though I\nrather wish it _were_ possible.... Here come Prell and your lady. I'll\ndisappear.\"\n\nThey looked almost as they used to look--before anything about them\nwas changed. Blame the loss of some trifling birthmark or scar here\nand there on the simplification of details that had occurred during a\nstep down to smallness. Yet Mitchell Prell's china-blue eyes were as\ngood-humored as ever and Barbara's smile as bright and warm.\n\n\"So here we are, Eddie,\" she said gaily. \"And what we recently were\nare still around somewhere--alive and aware, and the same as we were,\nthough not quite us any more. Separate, but still helping, I'm sure.\nAnd if we all get through all right, well, their universe is as\nwonderful and even vaster than ours.\"\n\nPrell scowled for a moment, as if he envied his lesser likeness the\ncontinued chance to study the structure of matter, down where molecules\nthemselves seemed bigger and nearer. But then his shoulders jerked\nalmost angrily, as if to shake off the scientist's woolgathering. \"Come\non, Ed,\" he snapped. \"Abel Freeman has been pushing the idea you\nexpressed, talking it around the world to all the androids. He says\nthat, crazy though it is, he'll encourage it.\"\n\nThey emerged from the cavern into the afternoon sunshine of the camp.\nA sudden quiet had come over it. Eyes were staring up toward the east,\nwhile bodies tensed for a dive for whatever shelter was at hand.\nSomething moved there with seeming slowness, though its gray hue, like\na distant mountain peak, told that it was seen through all the murky\nheights of the atmosphere and was in free space beyond. Its motors\nwere inactive. High sunshine brought metallic glints from its prow.\nIt was certainly miles in length. Its presence could mean doomsday.\nBut it _was_ magnificent! If it could set human blood to coursing more\nswiftly, how must it affect an android?\n\n\"The star ship!\" someone shouted. Others took up the cry: \"The star\nship.... The star ship....\"\n\nNow Abel Freeman's voice boomed from a sound system: \"Yep, you're\nright. I sent a call for it to come in from the asteroids. Figured it\nwould be good for all our tough-gutted breed to look at! Uh-huh, tough\ngutted, I said, but might be I'll have to take that back. Anyhow, a man\nmade for a mule loves a mule on sight. So how about men and a ship made\nfor the stars? But might be you ain't that kind of folks--you only seem\nthat way. Might be you can only see the mud on the ground and not the\nsky. I dunno. Moving all of us fast would take an awful lot of insides.\nBut ain't she a beauty? I figure that the folks that brought her here\ndidn't like to disobey orders, but they figured that letting us see\nwas necessary. Maybe they're Phonies, too. I figure that Harwell, who\nbossed her construction, would be that now. Her kind of purpose demands\nit. But maybe you ain't up to what she's for. And you folks of the old\nkind, what do you say? What if we did leave you alone on Earth? What if\nyou gave us this first star ship and let us build more, out on a moon\nof Saturn where you don't go much? Let's hear some answers!\"\n\nObviously, Abel Freeman's words were also being broadcast. Meanwhile\nthe star ship glided into the sunset. Someone spoke briefly from her by\nradio. Harwell?\n\n\"I hope you convince everybody, Freeman. I believe it does make sense.\nNot a cinch, though, even for us.\"\n\nThat, too, came out of the address system, as the ship headed back\ntoward its base.\n\nIn his newer self, here on Earth, Ed breathed again, and his breathing\nwas rapid. Once more the unseen future was a thrill. Yet he must not\nlet glamour gild harsh uncertainties too much.\n\nHe looked at the faces around him. Some were stern, some grinned in\nbravado under Abel Freeman's challenging sarcasm, but in most of\nthem there was a special, eager light, almost avid. It looked as if\nFreeman's talk and the great craft that had come with it were turning\nthe trick. But these were trivial dramatics, too. The real source of\nsuccess--if it was that--was in a basic kinship of android vigor with\nthe stars. Awakened, it could relinquish the Earth without regret.\nThese people could feel a little like lesser gods now. Their strength\nand endurance matched the next step of progress. Now the fantastic gulf\nof distance didn't seem as wide as Freeman had once thought.\n\nFrom scattered android camps, messages came in, pointing generally\ntoward deeper space. Yes, doubts were expressed.\n\n\"Shall we leave our homes without even an argument? Are we complete\nfools?\"\n\n\"Yes, fools if we don't leave. We _can_ make a mass departure. And\nremember that this is the _only_ solution. Are they still too primitive\nfor us to live with? The same fault might be ours. I wonder what they\nwill say to our proposition?\"\n\nCommunications also flashed back and forth among the old race:\n\n\"... They look like us but aren't. Their disguise and their powers\nhold a warning. No wonder so many of us think of them as something\nlike medieval demons. Can we trust what they say? Or is it a trick to\ndisarm us? How can we know? Yet they intrigue us. Man has always sought\nto borrow strength and permanence from the rocks and hills. Are they\nthat achievement? And we ourselves have wanted the stars.\"\n\nCrouched over the small receiver in Freeman's restored shelter during\nthat still-ominous afternoon, Ed and Barbara listened and waited.\nAround them they found both humor and pathos. In another shelter, dug\ninto the rocks and soil, they located Les Payten, whose misfortunes\nwith the Phonies had been many. His bitter frankness had won him\ndislike here. He had been put under restraint. There was the bearish\ntenderness and nursing of the gorgeous and powerful Nancy, Freeman's\ndaughter, who stood beside him now, her big blue eyes expressing a\nmixture of soulful devotion and hunger about as rapacious as that of\na starved hound-dog six inches from a fat rabbit. Les didn't seem\nto appreciate it at all. But he still tried to be a friend to his\ncompanions of a lost youth. \"Babs! Ed!\" he exclaimed at sight of them.\n\"So you got back--to size, anyhow! But you could go back to where you\nbegan, as natural creatures! Damn, once we were young idiots, dazzled\nby a sense of wonder into too much tolerance. I don't want to be\nsomething synthetic! Can't you two realize the fundamental truth of\nthat--for yourselves? Good Glory! Wake up!\"\n\nEd's grin was one-sided. \"For one thing, I suspect that going back all\nthe way wouldn't quite work, Les,\" he said mildly. \"We are what we are\nnow, that's all. There's a cloudy sort of limit on switching bodies.\nThere can never truly be two of anyone. Besides, we like being what we\nare. And should I remind you that, in common with all animals, man is\na natural machine? As for being synthetic, I assure you that both love\nand poetry are there as well. So what do you imagine that we lack that\nthe old timers always had? A taste for turkey or cake? Just lead us to\nit! We're human, Les--our forms and ideals and feelings are as they\nalways were. We're not devils. We're not truly separated from the old\nrace in any part of sympathy. We're just people gone on--I hope!--a\nlittle further.\"\n\nEd spoke gently, as he must to a tired, confused friend. Or was it to\na whole, vast section of humanity, dumfounded by hurtling technology,\nproud and stubborn about what had seemed its eternal self, and dreading\nany change which could seem so darkly drastic?\n\nBarbara tried, too. \"Why don't _you_ join _us_, Les?\" she urged. \"If\nyou became like us, you would know! Besides, even if all the androids\nleave the Earth, the knowledge of how to mold vitaplasm won't be taken\naway with us. People here will continue to be destroyed in accidents,\nas has always happened. So that knowledge will be needed and used.\nBesides, some persons will change willingly. Some people may want to\nshut themselves away from such realities. But I don't think that they\ncan. They'll have to learn to accept facts.\"\n\nLes Payten looked at his old companions oddly, as if tempted by an old\nsoaring of the fancy. Then the light died in his eyes. \"Nice logic,\"\nhe said coldly. \"I could almost trust it if I didn't remind myself. A\nmechanical treachery. My Ed Dukas and Barbara Day are dead.\"\n\nHis tone was calm, yet there was a quiver in it--perhaps of revulsion\nfor these imponderable likenesses before him, whose hearts he thought\nhe could not--or did not--want to see.\n\nEd was exasperated before a stubbornness of thought habit which was\npartly fear, though Les Payten was no coward. Some human minds were\nquick to adjust, taking even the radical newness of the last half\ncentury in their stride. But there had always been many others who were\nslow. Perhaps it was a childish taint, a resisting of maturity. And how\ncould they keep pace now? But right there, Ed had to remind himself not\nto be too sure of himself. The next day or minute might trip him up.\n\nThere seemed no further way to argue with Les. Ed could only express\nhis sincere thanks for a favor, offer good wishes, and shrug lightly\nand in some mockery, for one who refused what seemed a simple truth. If\nthat shrug was superficially unkind, perhaps it was also a goad in the\nright direction. A favor to a pal.\n\nAn hour later, when Ed told Freeman of Les Payten's reactions, the\ncolorful android leader had a similar comment: \"There's maybe billions\nlike that--one reason why we got to leave. They'll change. But right\nnow, who cares to take the ornery kid brothers fishing? Give 'em time\nto grow up a little more, first. It won't be so long. Just now we got\nour own problems and jobs. They ain't small, and nothing's certain.\nThere's no hole to jump into that's as deep as deep space! I thought\nonce that it couldn't happen. But now it looks as if we're gonna get\nthe chance to try!\"\n\nAbel Freeman was right. That evening a message came from the World\nCapital: \"Let us meet and confer with android representatives and\nearnestly apply ourselves to a binding solution.\"\n\nThat was the beginning. It seemed that reason had won out after all.\nFreeman and Prell were flown to the Capital. Ed did not go, for he\nforesaw a bleak conference with the single purpose of getting an\narrangement made as soon as possible. This proved to be true. To the\nandroids went the first star ship, its asteroid base, provisions to be\ndelivered regularly over a ten-year period, supplies and equipment of\nall kinds, and the use of Titan, largest of distant Saturn's moons.\n\nTo the vast majority of the androids this was enough. To the few\ngrumblers there would be scant choice. Let them view themselves as\nexiles, borne along by the eager mass of their kind.\n\nWhen Freeman and Prell returned to camp after the signing of the\ntreaty, Les Payten had already left for the City. For a while Nancy\nFreeman would look wistful. She was strong and beautiful, and perhaps\nnot as wild as her personal legend. Briefly, Mitchell Prell's eyes\nrested on her. Then he chuckled.\n\n\"Sirius,\" he said. \"Nine light-years away. Not the nearest star, and\nnot perfect. But the best bet of the nearest. Alpha Centauri is a\nbinary, too. Bad for stable planetary orbits. But in the Sirian System,\nat least we know now that there _are_ many planets. Come on, Freeman.\nThere are more plans to straighten out.\"\n\nPreparations began, and the weeks passed. Once Ed even went shopping\nwith his wife--for the pretty things, symbols of the luxury and\nsophistication of Earth, that she wanted to take with her into the\nunknown. Was that the crassest kind of optimism before the harshness\nthat could be imagined?\n\nEd, Barbara and Prell would be among the many thousands to be packed\ninto the first star ship for the first long jump. They had earned the\nprivilege of choice. Abel Freeman had elected to stay behind, to help\ndirect operations on Titan.\n\nInterplanetary craft were moving out in a steady stream, transporting\nmigrants and the prefabricated parts needed to set up a vast glassed-in\ncamp that few of the old blood could ever have tried to build. The\nandroids might even have endured the cold poison of Titan's methane\natmosphere without protection. But they had inherited, and could not\neasily throw off, earthly conceptions of comfort. And they had their\nrights. The countless things needed to build other star ships would\nsoon begin to follow them.\n\nThe first group of interstellar migrants didn't have to go anywhere\nnear Titan. The star ship came to Earth again, to orbit around it.\nSmall rocket tenders were there to bring the passengers up to the\nboarding locks.\n\nAt the take-off platforms, Ed Dukas saw his parents for the last time.\nJack Dukas, who had chosen to remain on Earth with his wife, shook Ed's\nhand warmly. Let them try their simple life of thatched stone houses\non hillsides, Ed thought, let them defy what seemed a too involved\ncivilization. Perhaps after the android exodus, some few would even\nmake it work--on Venus, if not at home.\n\nEd hugged his mother. They had memories. Now Ed stretched optimism\nconsiderably. \"At last there can be a lot of time, Mom,\" he said.\n\"Enough so that we might even see each other again, someplace....\"\n\nSoon he and Barbara were up there in the great ship. To his touch, her\narm was as smooth and soft as ever. Her hair was dark and thick, her\neyes were bright with adventure, her skin a golden tan. And was it a\nloss that she could have bent crowbar with her bare hands, or have\nbraved a vacuum at near absolute-zero temperature without harm?\n\n\"You're insulting me in your mind, Ed,\" she joshed gaily. \"Not that I'm\nmuch bothered. So the robot stoops to conquer, eh? Of course we have no\nsouls, Eddie.\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" he responded in the same manner. \"All our hopes spring\nfrom human sources. Even our firmer flesh was a human dream. Yet you\ncan practically hear our mechanical joints creak. The old race was\ncreated perfect. Who could ever dare to make it any better?\"\n\nEd's sarcasm was honest. Yet he knew that before the unprobed distance,\neven the ruggedest of his kind were disposed to do a little whistling\nin the dark.\n\nAround them in the ship's huge assembly room, there were shouts,\ngreetings, jokes and laughter. A young couple chatted brightly. A child\nstudied a toy with serious petulance. A man consulted a notebook.\nPerhaps few here yet realized their range, power and freedom or just\nwhat they faced. Their environment had been narrow, like all earthly\nhistory. No doubt many were afraid of the strangeness and time and\ndistance ahead. They had reason to be. Out there in the black pit of\nthe galaxy, even giant stars could perish.\n\nMitchell Prell had not yet come aboard. Abel Freeman had already left\nfor Titan--without his willful daughter. Schaeffer, the scientist, had\ngone with him.\n\nUnder Harwell's commands, the colossal craft kept taking on migrants\nat top speed for thirty hours. They boarded in numbers out of all\nproportion to the available living space. Meanwhile there were needles\nto submit to. Vitaplasm could be more rugged and adaptable now than\nwhen it was first used. The fluids from hollow needles were the means\nof imparting the improvements.\n\nAt last the ship quivered slightly. In contact with the heat of fusion\nof hydrogen and lithium to form the gaseous stellar ash called helium,\nany material rocket chamber would have been scattered instantly\nas incandescent vapor. But space warps stood firm in their place,\nsqueezing with an atom-crushing pressure of their own, natural only\nat the centers of stars. And now there was no secondary arrangement\nfor the conversion of such power as was released into electricity.\nEven the helium became pure radiation that emerged in a stream. It\nwas a continuous, directed explosion of light, far stronger within\nits narrow limits than the outburst of a supernova. It had been known\nfor centuries that light had both mass and pressure, and here it\nwas concentrated matter--the ultimate in propulsive thrust--changed\ncompletely to energy. On the sullen Earth, neither man nor android\ndared watch that thin thread of fury, while slowly the ship began to\naccelerate toward a five-figure number of miles per second.\n\nIt was the start of the departure of fear from an ancient race. Or so\nit was meant to be. From Earth, curses no doubt followed the ship--and\nsighs of relief, and regrets, and good wishes. This setting forth\nshould have been a human triumph. Many would insist that it was not\nthat. Others knew that it was.\n\nBraced in a cubicle two meters long, one wide and half a meter high, Ed\nDukas held his wife's hand. Tiered rows of other cubicles were around\nthem. Mitchell Prell had been with them minutes ago, and he had simply\nsaid, \"Good night,\" half jokingly. Or was it more whistling in the dark?\n\n\"Just good night. That's how it'll be, sweet,\" Ed whispered now. \"The\nyears won't mean anything. In the old mythology, the demigods could\nsleep for a millennium.\"\n\nSo the small spark of dread flickered out in them, as they invoked a\npower which they had used before, in smaller android bodies, and for a\nmuch shorter interval. No drug was needed. Their sleep became suspended\nanimation.\n\nFine dust began to settle on them. But after forty years, measured by\nthe ship's chronometers--on the basis of a retarded time imparted to\nobjects moving at high velocity, a somewhat longer interval must have\npassed on Earth--Ed was awakened to help patrol the vessel.\n\nWith a few other silent men, he moved through its ghostly, dimly\nlighted corridors and compartments inhabited by the living dead. The\nstillness was all around, and outside only the stars burned in the\nvoid. The decades had been like the passing of a night of sleep;\nyet now awake, Ed was aware that the time had gone, building up an\nunimaginable distance. Here was the abyss. It was a cold awareness\nwhich made him neither confident nor happy. Sometimes he looked down at\nBarbara's quiet face, but he did not wish her to awaken now.\n\nAhead was Sirius, brighter than before. Beside it, visible at least\nto the unaided eye, was the dim speck of its companion star, a white\ndwarf, shrunken and old, little larger than the Earth, but incredibly\nmassive, the very atoms at its core compressed by its fearsome gravity\nand the weight of material above them. This dwarf's internal substance,\nlargely pure nuclear matter, would have weighed tons per cubic inch.\n\nInstruments, brought nearer to a destination, now showed more clearly,\nby the irregularities in the movements of this binary system, the\nexistence of planets pursuing changing paths in the complicated cross\ndrags of two stellar bodies revolving around a common center. Those\nworlds, known of on Earth for a quarter century, were still out of\ntelescopic view. Their seasons must be crazy--hot, cold, uncertain.\nYet other, nearer star systems had the same, and worse, drawbacks. And\nSirius was relatively near, too. Besides, need an android worry about\nthe fluctuations of mad climates so much?\n\nAfter a month, Ed Dukas relinquished his duties to others who were\naroused briefly. He slept again, for more decades, and on through the\nfirst contact with a Sirian world. His mind still slightly blurred, he\ncame down in a tender from the orbiting star ship, after others had\nlanded. Barbara was with him. Somewhere far ahead, among hills rapidly\nshedding their glacial coat under hot sunshine, was Mitchell Prell.\n\nThe sunshine came from Sirius itself, farther away than the distance\nfrom Earth to Uranus; hence its size and brilliance were counteracted.\nYet this world did not attend Sirius directly. It belonged to\nthe white-hot speck at zenith--the dwarf with an almost equal\nattraction--tiny, but much closer. The planet hurried like a moon\naround this miniature sun.\n\nEd looked up at thin fish-scale clouds that were rose-tinted. Before\nhim was a prairie covered with waving stalks bearing white plumes.\nMight you call them flowers blown by the wind?\n\nHigh up among the melting ice he saw a tower and maybe a roadway.\nLater he beheld two shapes, brown and rough, with four tapered,\nflexible limbs radiating from a central lump. Man, with his arms and\nlegs, also has vaguely the form of a cross. But these were different,\nthough sometimes they almost walked, and metal devices glinted in the\nequipment they wore. Had he dreamed all this somewhere years ago?...\nSometimes they rolled quickly like wheels, or they crept along, their\nlimbs coiling. Once they flew, with bright flashes and without wings.\nBut that was artificial. They moved off at last beside a shallow,\nsalt-rimmed sea.\n\n\"We can't stay here, Eddie,\" Barbara stated. \"It could be fascinating,\nbut it would be worse than on Earth.\"\n\n\"As everyone will realize,\" Ed Dukas answered.\n\nSo the explorers came back to the tender. Nearer to the dwarf sun they\nfound a world with a more stable orbit and less extremes of cold and\nheat. If it was nearer the dwarf with its almost negligible radiance,\nit also did not approach as close to Sirius, nor swing so far away. It\nwas a chilly little planet that had once been inhabited, too; but now\nthere were only shattered stone and glass and rusted steel. Much of it\nwas desert. But there were forests here and there, and high glaciers.\n\nHigh on a clifftop in the thin, cold atmosphere, the refugees built\ntheir first city. It began with houses of rough logs and stone. But as\ntime passed and the population increased, its metal-sheathed towers\nbegan to soar. In its glassed-in gardens, terrestrial flowers and trees\nthrived, while out of doors beautiful plants of a neo-biology easily\nsurpassed in vigor the hardy local growths. There were theaters, stores\nand libraries. There was feminine fashion. Thus, nostalgically, an old\nearthly way was copied, though Earth was lost. There was no method to\nspeak across the light-years. Earth might even belong to a somewhat\ndifferent branch of time. But all this did not include the major point\nof separation. That was expressed in the way these people climbed the\nhighest mountains without tiring and let the hoarfrost of fearsome cold\ngather on their bare faces without discomfort.\n\nSometimes, on blizzard nights, while they took the sleep that they did\nnot need for more than the pleasure of it, Barbara and Ed would leave\nthe windows open to the storm.\n\n\"Roofs, buildings--why do we even bother with them?\" Ed would say\njokingly.\n\nHis wife would look at him somewhat worriedly, as if he meant it. As\nif here there were a bitter strangeness that lowered all earthly art\nand charm and comfort and sense of home to a futility. But then she'd\nmanage to laugh lightly, though often she didn't quite feel that way.\n\"You know why we bother, Ed,\" she'd answer. \"Because we want to stay\nsomewhat as we once were. Didn't you always agree to that? Because it's\nhard to change old habits and limitations, and grasp the freedom you're\nthinking about, Eddie. Sometimes I even suspect that we try to hide\nfrom that freedom.\"\n\nEd would scowl, feeling all of these thoughts, too. They had all the\nfreedom that men had envisioned long ago: practical freedom from death,\nexcept from extreme violence; freedom from aging, freedom of mind,\nof action, of shape and size; the freedom of peace and plenty, and\nboundless energy. But beyond all this, like a goad, there often was,\nalready, much more than a ghost of that ancient human restlessness that\nalways had thrived on strength.\n\n\"Are you happy here, Babs?\" Ed asked once when there had been time to\ndoubt.\n\nBy then they already had two young sons, born of new flesh in an old\nway.\n\n\"Of course--reasonably,\" she chuckled. \"Though I have my moods. Then I\ndon't quite know.... But, Eddie, this is the great, marvelous future,\nisn't it--the one we looked forward to with longing and wonder? We\nought to appreciate it completely.\"\n\n\"It is that future. But now, sweetheart, it's also just the present.\"\n\nThere were incidents to match such restless talk and thinking. There\nwas Mitchell Prell, always groping for new things, shouting down from a\ncragtop, or from his laboratory, \"Hey, Ed! Barbara! Come here!\"\n\nMaybe he'd discovered a vein of ore that might be mined, or a strange\nspecimen of hitherto unnoticed local fauna or flora. He remained a\nscientist, while Ed had become a mere builder of buildings.\n\nMore than likely, the woman Prell had married would be with him--she\nhad been Nancy Freeman of a fantastic origin. That he had separated\nhimself enough from his studies to take a wife was a minor miracle.\nThat these so-different two should be together was certainly another.\nThat she had learned to be both tasteful and poised, though no less\nvigorous than ever, had perhaps been hoped for by the first romancing\nthought that had given her real being on Earth.\n\nTo live in peace, comfort and beauty, Ed now realized, was not a final\ngoal. The wild nomad, like Prell, shouting down from mountaintops,\nalways seeking the unknown and straining to be bigger than his\npowers--however great they might have become--still had to be served.\nOtherwise pride was insulted, the urge to learn and progress was\ndefeated; boredom set in, and centuries of life were not worth living.\n\nBesides, belatedly, after years, there were voices, speaking out of\nwireless equipment in a way that Ed and Barbara Dukas and Mitchell\nPrell had reason to remember. That this world was now haunted by beings\nthat floated with the dust in the air was a fact which in itself had an\neerie, nomadic charm. Three tiny beings. No, now there were four.\n\n\"Hello! Did you guess that we came with you on the star ship?... But\nwe stayed on that first planet. Then we visited others. Once we slept\nunder a glacier--we don't know how long. Now we have built another\nbiological workshop. So we will not be lonely. There will be many of\nus. I see you have done well. What comes next?\"\n\nEd had the odd and startling impression of having been spoken to\nby himself. But he and a tiny speck of the clay of the half-gods\nwere entirely distinct, even if their names were the same. The vast\ndifference in size, enforcing separate thought patterns to meet the\nproblems of different environment, had widened the gap further.\n\n\"It's us!\" Barbara said.\n\nMitchell Prell and Nancy were also present just then, in the Dukas\nhouse. Perhaps the visitors had waited for them to be there.\n\n\"I know who you mean,\" Nancy remarked. \"Your little folk, Mitch. Tell\nthem something. Or do they embarrass you by being so strange? Have you\nforgotten?\"\n\nPrell laughed somewhat unsteadily. Other interests had long ago taken\nhis attention away from the small regions that were within the reach of\nandroid powers.\n\n\"They're special friends,\" he said. \"We won't have any trouble talking\nto them. Hello yourselves!\"\n\nSo it was, for an hour. There was a mood of elfin charm, of expanded\ndimensions, of soft, rich colors; of physical laws wonderfully\ndifferent in effect. The memory was haunting. But the larger Ed and\nBarbara had no present wish to return to that fantastic land. It was\nnot their destiny.\n\n\"So long for now....\" The voices faded away playfully. But as Sirian\ntime built Terran years, they were occasionally heard again, bearing a\nnote of challenge.\n\nThe new city had grown huge. The surrounding country was becoming\npopulous. And the inevitable happened, like part of a plan implanted\nin the nature of man from the beginning--to grow, to reach out, to\nbe bigger in all things than he was before, though perhaps even to\nimagine the final goal itself was still beyond his intelligence and his\nexperience. Now a more rugged body only made the drives stronger and\nthe outcome more sure.\n\nStill orbiting around this first colonial world, outside the old solar\nsystem and linked to the history of Earth, was the star ship, kept\nalways in careful order. But on a small, jagged moon, a larger, better\ncraft was under construction. It would have thrilled ancient blood; it\ncould stir an android more.\n\nSomething sultry began to ache in Ed Dukas's mind at the thought of\nrestraint.\n\n\"Some of us will have to go on, Babs,\" he said one dwarf-lit\nhalf-night. \"Blame it on fundamental biological law--in me, and the\nboys, too. Call it building an empire too big for any government. Maybe\nit's an intended step--toward some other condition still out of sight.\nNo doubt we're far from the end of what we can become. I don't know.\nI don't really care. I'm just a man and glad of it. I only know how I\nfeel, and I suspect that, deep down, you feel the same!\"\n\nFor a moment Barbara was angry and sad. She still had a woman's wish\nfor permanence. She knew that Ed was thinking of other stars and their\nsystems--red giants, flickering variables, bursting novae--a whole\nuniverse of mystery beckoning to a new kind of human. Even the ugly\ncoal-sack clouds of cosmic dust could have their appeal. She herself\nwas not beyond being intrigued by such things.\n\nShe walked across her pleasant room, which had begun to bore her a\nlittle, as Ed knew. \"I'm game,\" she said mildly.\n\nInconceivably far off were other galaxies. Maybe Ed read her mind\na little, as she thought of the vast, tilted swirl of the one in\nAndromeda, almost as big as their native Milky Way. It was the nearest,\nbut so distant that all the light-years they had crossed could seem\na mile by comparison. As a child she used to look at a picture of it\nand think that everything she could imagine, and much more, was there:\nbooks, musical instruments, summer nights, dark horror.\n\nEd and she were like the pagan divinities dreamed up wistfully long\nago. Yet now she felt very humble.\n\n\"Ed--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering where God lives,\" she said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                           ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n\n_Ray Gallun's stories have appeared in virtually every science-fiction\nmagazine known to English-speaking man_--Galaxy, Astounding Science\nFiction, Amazing Stories, Marvel Tales, Startling Stories, _etc._,\n_etc._, _plus_ Collier's, Family Circle, Utopia (_Germany_), _and\nvarious anthologies_.\n\n_He was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, in 1910, attended the University\nof Wisconsin, and has since spent most of his time, when not writing,\ntraveling through the U.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
