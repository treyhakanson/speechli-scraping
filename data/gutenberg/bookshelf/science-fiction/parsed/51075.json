JONES\n\n                       Illustrated by JOHN BUNCH\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                 Galaxy Science Fiction December 1950.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n    Given: The future is probabilities merging into one certainty.\n        Proposition: Can the probabilities be made improbables\n               so that the certainty becomes impossible?\n\n\nFrom Frederick to Baltimore, the rolling Maryland countryside lay under\na fresh blanket of green. Wholly unaware of the summer glory, Dr.\nCurtis Johnson drove swiftly on the undulating highway, stirring clouds\nof dust and dried grasses.\n\nBeside him, his wife, Louise, held her blowing hair away from her face\nand laughed into the warm air. \"Dr. Dell isn't going to run away.\nBesides, you said we could call this a weekend vacation as well as a\nbusiness trip.\"\n\nCurt glanced at the speedometer and eased the pressure on the pedal. He\ngrinned. \"Wool-gathering again.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering who said it first--one of the fellows at Detrick,\nor that lieutenant at Bikini, or--\"\n\n\"Said _what_? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"That crack about the weapons after the next war. He--whoever it\nwas--said there may be some doubt about what the weapons of the next\nwar will be like, but there is absolutely no doubt about the weapons of\nWorld War IV. It will be fought with stones and spears. I guess any one\nof us could have said it.\"\n\nLouise's smile grew tight and thin. \"Don't any of you ever think of\nanything but the next war--_any_ of you?\"\n\n\"How can we? We're fighting it right now.\"\n\n\"You make it sound so hopeless.\"\n\n\"That's what Dell said in the days just before he quit. He said we\ndidn't _have_ to stay at Detrick producing the toxins and aerosols that\nwill destroy millions of lives. But he never showed us how we could\nquit--and be sure of staying alive. His own walking out was no more\nthan a futile gesture.\"\n\n\"I just can't understand him, Curt. I think he's right in a way, but\nwhat brought _him_ to that viewpoint?\"\n\n\"Hard to tell,\" Curt said, unconsciously speeding up again. \"After\nthe war, when the atomic scientists were publicly examining their\nconsciences, Dell told them to examine their own guts first. That\nwas typical of him then, but soon after, he swung just as strongly\npacifist and walked out of Detrick.\"\n\n\"It still seems strange that he abandoned his whole career. The world's\nforemost biochemist giving up the laboratory for a _truck farm_!\"\nLouise glanced down at the lunch basket between them. In it were\ntomatoes that Dr. Hamon Dell had sent along with his invitation to\nvisit him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor nearly a year Dr. Dell had been sending packages of choice fruit\nand vegetables to his former colleagues, not only at the biological\nwarfare center at Camp Detrick but at the universities and other\nresearch centers throughout the country.\n\n\"I wish we knew exactly why he asked us to come out,\" said Louise.\n\n\"Nobody claims to have figured him out. They laugh a little at him now.\nThey eat his gifts willingly enough, but consider him slightly off his\nrocker. He still has all his biological talents, though. I've never\nseen or tasted vegetables like the ones he grows.\"\n\n\"And the brass at Detrick doesn't think he's gone soft in the head,\neither,\" she added much too innocently. \"So they ordered you to take\nadvantage of his invitation and try to persuade him to come back.\"\n\nCurt turned his head so sharply that Louise laughed.\n\n\"No, I didn't read any secret, hush-hush papers,\" she said. \"But it's\npretty obvious, isn't it, the way you rushed right over to General\nHansen after you got the invitation?\"\n\n\"It _is_ hush-hush, top-secret stuff,\" said Curt, his eyes once more on\nthe road. \"The Army doesn't want it to leak, but they need Dell, need\nhim badly. Anyone knowing bio-war developments would understand. They\nwanted to send me before. Dell's invitation was the break we needed.\nI may be the one with sufficient influence to bring him back. I hope\nso. But keep it under your permanent and forget your guessing games.\nThere's more to it than you know.\"\n\nThe car passed through a cool, wooded section and Louise leaned back\nand drank in the beauty of it.\n\n\"Hush-hush, top secret stuff,\" she said. \"Grown men playing children's\ngames.\"\n\n\"Pretty deadly games for children, darling.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the late afternoon they by-passed the central part of Baltimore and\nheaded north beyond the suburb of Towson toward Dell's truck farm.\n\nHis sign was visible for a half mile:\n\n    YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT\n        Eat the Best\n    EAT DELL'S VEGETABLES\n\n\"Dr. Hamon Dell, world's foremost biochemist--and truck farmer,\" Curt\nmuttered as he swung the car off the highway.\n\nLouise stepped out when the tires ceased crunching on the gravel lane.\nShe scanned the fields and old woods beyond the ancient but preserved\nfarmhouse. \"It's so unearthly.\"\n\nCurt followed. The song of birds, which had been so noticeable before,\nseemed strangely muted. The land itself was an alien, faintly greenish\nhue, a color repulsive to more than just the eyes.\n\n\"It must be something in this particular soil,\" said Curt, \"something\nthat gives it that color and produces such wonderful crops. I'll have\nto remember to ask Dell about it.\"\n\n\"You want Dr. Dell?\"\n\nThey whirled at the sound of an unfamiliar voice. Louise uttered a\nstartled cry.\n\nThe gaunt figure behind them coughed asthmatically and pointed with an\narm that seemed composed only of bones and brownish skin, so thin as to\nbe almost translucent.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Curt shakenly. \"We're friends of his.\"\n\n\"Dell's in back. I'll tell him you're here.\"\n\nThe figure shambled away and Louise shook herself as if to rid her mind\nof the vision. \"If our grandchildren ever ask about zombies, I can\ntell them. Who in the world do you suppose he is?\"\n\n\"Hired man, I suppose. Sounds as if he should be in a lung sanitarium.\nFunny that Dell would keep him around in that condition.\"\n\nFrom somewhere behind the house came the sound of a truck engine. Curt\ntook Louise's arm and led her around the trim, graveled path.\n\nThe old farmhouse had been very carefully renovated. Everywhere was\nevidence of exquisite care, yet the cumulative atmosphere remained\nuninviting, almost oppressive. Curt told himself it was the utter\nsilence, made even more tense by the lonely chugging of the engine in\nback, and the incredible harsh color of the soil beneath their feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRounding the corner, they came in sight of a massive tank truck. From\nit a hose led to an underground storage tank and pulsed slowly under\nthe force of the liquid gushing through it. No one was in sight.\n\n\"What could that be for?\" asked Louise.\n\n\"You've got me. Could be gasoline, but Dell hasn't any reason for\nstoring that much here.\"\n\nThey advanced slowly and amazement crept over Curt as he comprehended\nthe massiveness of the machine. The tank was of elliptical cross\nsection, over ten feet on its major axis. Six double wheels supported\nthe rear; even the front ones were double. In spite of such wide weight\ndistribution, the tires were pressing down the utterly dry ground to a\ndepth of an inch or more.\n\n\"They must haul liquid lead in that thing,\" said Curt.\n\n\"It's getting cool. I wish Dell would show up.\" Louise glanced out\nover the twenty-acre expanse of truck farm. Thick rows of robust\nplants covered the area. Tomatoes, carrots, beets, lettuce, and other\nvegetables--a hundred or so fruit trees were at the far end. Between\nthem ran the road over which the massive truck had apparently entered\nthe farm from the rear.\n\nA heavy step sounded abruptly and Dell's shaggy head appeared from\naround the end of the truck. His face lighted with pleasure.\n\n\"Curt, my boy! And Louise! I thought you weren't going to show up at\nall.\"\n\nCurt's hand was almost lost in Dell's enormous grip, but it wasn't\nbecause of that that his grip was passive. It was his shocked reaction\nto Dell's haggard appearance. The fierce eyes looked merely old and\ntired now. The ageless, leathery hide of Dell's face seemed to have\ncollapsed before some overpowering decay, its bronze smoothness\nshattered by deep lines that were like tool marks of pain.\n\nCurt spoke in a subdued voice. \"It's hard to get away from Detrick.\nAlways one more experiment to try--\"\n\n\"--And the brass riding you as if they expected you to win another war\nfor them tomorrow afternoon,\" said Dell. \"I remember.\"\n\n\"We wondered about this truck,\" Louise commented brightly, trying to\nchange the subject. \"We finally gave up on it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that. It brings liquid fertilizer to pump into my irrigation\nwater, that's all. No mystery. Let's go on to the house. After you're\nsettled we can catch up on everything and I'll tell you about the\nthings I'm doing here.\"\n\n\"Who's the man we saw?\" asked Curt. \"He looks as if his health is\npretty precarious.\"\n\n\"That's Brown. He came with the place--farmed it for years for my uncle\nbefore I inherited it. He could grow a garden on a granite slab. In\nspite of appearances, he's well enough physically.\"\n\n\"How has your own health been? You have--changed--since you were at\nDetrick.\"\n\nDell raised a lock of steel-gray hair in his fingers and dismissed the\nquestion with a wan smile. \"We all wear out sometime,\" he said. \"My\nturn had to come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInside, some of the oppressiveness vanished as the evening passed. It\nwas cool enough for lighting the fireplace, and they settled before it\nafter dinner. While they watched the flickering light that whipped the\nbeamed ceiling, Dell entertained them with stories of his neighbors,\nwhose histories he knew clear back to Revolutionary times.\n\nEarly, however, Louise excused herself. She knew they would want\nprivacy to thresh out the purposes behind Dell's invitation--and Curt's\nacceptance.\n\nWhen she was gone, there was a moment's silence. The logs crackled with\nshocking pistol shots in the fireplace. The scientist moved to stir the\ncoals and then turned abruptly to Curt.\n\n\"When are you going to leave Detrick?\"\n\n\"When are _you_ coming back?\" Curt demanded instead of answering.\n\n\"So they still want me, even after the things I said when I left.\"\n\n\"You're needed badly. When I told Hansen I was coming down, he said it\nwould be worth five years of my own work to bring you back.\"\n\n\"They want me to produce even deadlier toxins than those I gave them,\"\nDell said viciously. \"They want some that can kill ten million people\nin four minutes instead of only one million--\"\n\n\"Any man would go insane if he looked at it that way. It would be the\nsame as gun-makers being tormented by the vision of torn men destroyed\nby their bullets, the sorrowing families--\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't the gun-makers be tormented?\" Dell's voice was\nlow with controlled hate. \"They are men like you and me who give the\n_war_-makers new tools for their trade.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dell, it's not as simple as that.\" Curt raised a hand and let it\nfall wearily. They had been over this so many times before. \"Weapon\ndesigners are no more responsible than any other agents of society.\nIt's pure neurosis to absorb the whole guilt of wars yet unfought\nmerely because you happened to have developed a potential weapon.\"\n\nDell touched the massive dome of his skull. \"Here within this brain of\nmine has been conceived a thing which will probably destroy a billion\nhuman lives in the coming years. D. triconus toxin in a suitable\naerosol requires only a countable number of molecules in the lungs of\na man to kill him. My brain and mine alone is responsible for that\nvicious, murderous discovery.\"\n\n\"Egotism! Any scientist's work is built upon the pyramid of past\nknowledge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The weapon I have described exists. If I had not created it, it would\nnot exist. It is as simple as that. No one shares my guilt and my\nresponsibility. And what more do they want of me now? What greater\ndream of mass slaughter and destruction have they dreamed?\"\n\n\"They want you,\" said Curt quietly, \"because they believe we are not\nthe only ones possessing the toxin. They need you to come back and help\nfind the antitoxin for D. triconus.\"\n\nDell shook his head. \"That's a blind hope. The action of D. triconus is\nlike a match set to a powder train. The instant its molecules contact\nprotoplasm, they start a chain reaction that rips apart the cell\nstructure. It spreads like fire from one cell to the next, and nothing\ncan stop it once it's started operating within a given organism.\"\n\n\"But doesn't this sense of guilt--unwarranted as it is--make you _want_\nto find an antitoxin?\"\n\n\"Suppose I succeeded? I would have canceled the weapon of an enemy.\nThe military would know he could nullify ours in time. Then they would\ncommand me to work out still another toxin. It's a vicious and insane\ncircle, which must be broken somewhere. The purpose of the entire\nremainder of my life is to break it.\"\n\n\"When you are fighting for your life and the enemy already has his\nhands about your throat,\" Curt argued, \"you reach for the biggest rock\nyou can get your hands on and beat his brains in. You don't try to\npersuade him that killing is unethical.\"\n\nFor an instant it seemed to Curt that a flicker of humor touched the\ncorners of Dell's mouth. Then the lines tightened down again.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he said. \"You reach for a rock and beat his brains in. You\ndon't wipe human life off the face of the Earth in order to reach that\nenemy. I asked you to come down here to help me break this circle of\nwhich I spoke. There has to be someone here--after I'm gone--\"\n\nDell's eyes shifted to the depths of shadows beyond the firelight and\nremained fixed on unseen images.\n\n\"Me? Help you?\" Curt asked incredulously. \"What could I do? Give up\nscience and become a truck gardener, too?\"\n\n\"You might say that we would be in the rock business,\" replied Dell.\n\"Fighting is no longer on the level of one man with his hands about\nanother's throat, but it _should_ be. Those who want power and\ndomination should have to fight for it personally. But it has been a\nlong time since they had to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Even in the old days, kings and emperors hired mercenaries to fight\ntheir wars. The militarists don't buy swords now. They buy brains.\nWe're the mercenaries of the new day, Curt, you and I. Once there was\nhonor in our profession. We searched for truth for its own sake, and\nbecause it was our way of life. Once we were the hope of the world\nbecause science was a universal language.\n\n\"What a horrible joke that turned out to be! Today we are the terror of\nthe world. The war-makers built us fine laboratories, shining palaces,\nand granted every whim--for a price. They took us up to the hills and\nshowed us the whole world and we sold our souls for it.\n\n\"Look what happened after the last war. Invading armies carried off\nprize Nazi brains like so much loot, set the scientists up in big new\nlaboratories, and these new mercenaries keep right on pouring out\nknowledge for other kings and emperors.\n\n\"Their loyalty is only to their science. But they can't experiment for\nknowledge any more, only weapons and counter-weapons. You'll say I'm\nanti-war, even, perhaps, anti-American or pro-Russian. I am not against\njust wars, but I am against unjust slaughter. And I love America too\nmuch to let her destroy herself along with the enemy.\"\n\n\"Then what are we to do?\" Curt demanded fiercely. \"What are we to do\nwhile enemy scientists prepare these same weapons to exterminate _us_?\nSure, it's one hell of a mess. Science is already dead. The kind you\ntalk about has been dead for twenty years. All our fine ideals are\nworthless until the politicians find a solution to their quarrels.\"\n\n\"Politicians? Since when did men of science have to wait upon\npoliticians for solutions of human problems?\" Dell passed a hand over\nhis brow, and suddenly his face contorted in pain.\n\n\"What is it?\" Curt exclaimed, rising.\n\n\"Nothing--nothing, my boy. Some minor trouble I've had lately. It will\npass in a moment.\"\n\nWith effort, he went on. \"I wanted to say that already you have come\nto think of science being divided into armed camps by the artificial\nboundaries of the politicians. Has it been so long ago that it was\nnot even in your lifetime, when scientists regarded themselves as one\ninternational brotherhood?\"\n\n\"I can't quarrel with your ideals,\" said Curt softly. \"But national\nboundary lines do, actually, divide the scientists of the world into\narmed camps.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Your premises are still incorrect. They do not deliberately war on\neach other. It is only that they have blindly sold themselves as\nmercenaries. And they can be called upon to redeem themselves. They can\nbreak their unholy contracts.\"\n\n\"There would have to be simultaneous agreement among the scientists of\nall nations. And they are men, influenced by national ideals. They are\nnot merely ivory-tower dabblers and searchers after truth.\"\n\n\"Do you remember me five years ago?\" Dell's face became more haggard,\nas if the memory shamed him. \"Do you remember when I told the atomic\nscientists to examine their guts instead of their consciences?\"\n\n\"Yes. You certainly _have_ changed.\"\n\n\"And so can other men. There is a way. I need your help desperately,\nCurt--\"\n\nThe face of the aging biochemist contorted again with unbearable pain.\nHis forehead beaded with sweat as he clenched his skull between his\nvein-knotted hands.\n\n\"Dell! What is it?\"\n\n\"It will pass,\" Dr. Dell breathed through clenched teeth. \"I have some\nmedicine--in my bedroom. I'm afraid I'll have to excuse myself tonight.\nThere's so much more I have to say to you, but we'll continue our talk\nin the morning, Curt. I'm sorry--\"\n\nHe stumbled out, refusing Curt's offer of aid with a grim headshake.\nThe fire crackled loudly within the otherwise silent room. Curt\nfelt cold at the descending chill of the night, his mind bewildered\nat Dell's barrage, some of it so reasonable, some of it so utterly\nconfused. And there was no clue to the identity of the powerful force\nthat had made so great a change in the once militant scientist.\n\nSlowly Curt mounted the staircase of the old house and went to the room\nDell had assigned them. Louise was in bed reading a murder mystery.\n\n\"Secret mission completed?\" she asked.\n\nCurt sat down on the edge of the bed. \"I'm afraid something terrible\nis wrong with Dell. Besides the neurotic guilt complex because of his\nwar work, he showed signs of a terrific and apparently habitual pain in\nhis head. If that should be brain tumor, it might explain his erratic\nnotions, his abandonment of his career.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope it's not that!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Curt that he had slept only minutes before he was roused\nby sounds in the night. He rolled over and switched on the light. His\nwatch said two o'clock. Louise raised up in sharp alarm.\n\n\"What is it?\" she whispered.\n\n\"I thought I heard something. There it is again!\"\n\n\"It sounds like someone in pain. It must be Dell!\"\n\nCurt leaped from the bed and wrestled into his bathrobe. As he hurried\ntoward Dell's room, there was another deep groan that ended in a\nshuddering sob of unbearable agony.\n\nHe burst into the scientist's room and switched on the light. Dell\nlooked up, eyes glazed with pain.\n\n\"Dr. Dell!\"\n\n\"Curt--I thought I had time left, but this is as far as I can go--Just\nremember all I said tonight. Don't forget a word of it.\" He sat up\nrigidly, hardly breathing in the effort of control. \"The responsibility\nfor the coming destruction of civilization lies at the doors of the\nscientist mercenaries. Don't allow it, Curt. Get them to abandon the\nlaboratories of the warriors. Get them to reclaim their honor--\"\n\nHe fell back upon the pillow, his face white with pain and shining with\nsweat. \"Brown--see Brown. He can tell you the--the rest.\"\n\n\"I'll go for a doctor,\" said Curt. \"Who have you had? Louise will stay\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Don't bring a doctor. There's no escaping this. I've known it for\nmonths. Wait here with me, Curt. I'll be gone soon.\"\n\nCurt stared with pity at the great scientist whose mind had so\ndisintegrated. \"You need a doctor. I'll call a hospital, Johns Hopkins,\nif you want.\"\n\n\"Wait, maybe you're right. I have no phone here. Get Dr. Wilson--the\nJudge Building, Towson--find his home address in a phone book.\"\n\n\"Fine. I'll only be a little while.\"\n\nHe stepped to the door.\n\n\"Curt! Take the lane down to the new road--behind the farm. Quicker--it\ncuts off a mile or so--go down through the orchard--\"\n\n\"All right. Take it easy now. I'll be right back.\"\n\nCurt frantically got dressed, ran down the stairs and out to the car.\nHe wondered absently what had become of the cadaverous Brown, who\nseemed to have vanished from the premises.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wheels spun gravel as he started the car and whipped it out of\nthe driveway. Then he was on the stretch of lane leading through the\ngrove. The moonless night was utterly dark, and the stream of light\nahead of the car seemed the only living thing upon the whole landscape.\nHe almost wished he had taken the more familiar road. To get lost now\nmight mean death for Dell.\n\nNo traffic flowed past him in either direction. There were no buildings\nshowing lights. Overwhelming desolation seemed to possess the\ncountryside and seep into his soul. It seemed impossible that this lay\nclose to the other highway with which he was familiar.\n\nHe strained his eyes into the darkness for signs of an all-night gas\nstation or store from which he could phone. Finally, he resigned\nhimself to going all the way to Towson. At that moment he glimpsed a\nspark of light far ahead.\n\nEncouraged, Curt stepped on the gas. In less than ten minutes he was at\nthe spot. He braked the car to a stop, and surveyed the building as he\ngot out. It seemed more like a power substation than anything else. But\nthere should be a telephone, at least.\n\nHe knocked on the door. Almost instantly, footsteps sounded within.\n\nThe door swung wide.\n\n\"I wonder if I could use your--\" Curt began. He gasped. \"Brown! Dell's\ndying--we've got to get a doctor for him--\"\n\nAs if unable to comprehend, the hired man stared dumbly for a long\nmoment. His hollow-cheeked face was almost skeletal in the light that\nflooded out from behind him.\n\nThen from somewhere within the building came a voice, sharp with\ntension. \"Brown! What the devil are you doing? Shut that door!\"\n\nThat brought the figure to life. He whipped out a gun and motioned Curt\ninward. \"Step inside. We'll have to decide what to do with you when\nCarlson finds you're here.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Curt asked, stupefied. \"Dell's dying. He\nneeds help.\"\n\n\"Get in here!\"\n\nCurt moved slowly forward. Brown closed the door behind him and\nmotioned toward a closed door at the other end of a short hall. They\nopened it and stepped into a dimly lighted room.\n\nCurt's eyes slowly adjusted and he saw what seemed to be a laboratory.\nIt was so packed with equipment that there was scarcely room for the\ngroup of twelve or fifteen men jammed closely about some object with\ntheir backs to Curt and Brown.\n\nBrown shambled forward like an agitated skeleton, breaking the circle.\nThen Curt saw that the object of the men's attention was a large\ncathode ray screen occupied by a single green line. There was a pip on\nit rising sharply near one side of the two-foot tube. The pip moved\nalmost imperceptibly toward a vertical red marker over the face of the\nscreen. The men stared as if hypnotized by it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe newcomers' arrival, however, disturbed their attention. One man\nturned with an irritable growl. \"Brown, for heaven's sake--\"\n\nHe was a bony creature, even more cadaverous than Brown. He caught\nsight of Curt's almost indecently robust face. He gasped and swore.\n\n\"Who is this? What's he doing here?\"\n\nThe entire montage of skull faces turned upon Curt. He heard a sharp\ncollective intake of breath, as if his presence were some unforeseen\ncalamity that had shaken the course of their incomprehensible lives.\n\n\"This is Curtis Johnson,\" said Brown. \"He got lost looking for a doctor\nfor Dell.\"\n\nA mummylike figure rose from a seat before the instrument. \"Your coming\nis tremendously unfortunate, but for the moment we can do nothing about\nit. Sit here beside me. My name is Tarron Sark.\"\n\nThe man indicated a chair.\n\n\"My friend, Dr. Dell, is dying,\" Curt snapped out, refusing to sit\ndown. \"I've got to get help. I saw your light and hoped you'd allow me\nto use your phone. I don't know who you are nor what Dell's hired man\nis doing here with you. But you've got to let me go for help!\"\n\n\"No.\" The man, Sark, shook his head. \"Dell is reconciled. He has to go.\nWe are awaiting precisely the event you would halt--his death.\"\n\nHe had known it, Curt thought, from the moment he entered that room.\nLike vultures sitting on cliffs waiting for the death of their prey,\nthese fantastic men let their glance slip back to the screen. The green\nline was a third of the way toward the red marker now, and moving more\nrapidly.\n\nIt was nightmare--meaningless--\n\n\"I'm not staying,\" Curt insisted. \"You can't prevent me from helping\nDell without assuming responsibility for his death. I demand you let me\ncall.\"\n\n\"You're not going to call,\" said Sark wearily. \"And we assumed\nresponsibility for Dell's death long ago. Sit down!\"\n\nSlowly Curt sank down upon the chair beside the stranger. There was\nnothing else to do. He was powerless against Brown's gun. But he'd\nbring them to justice somehow, he swore.\n\nHe didn't understand the meaning of the slowly moving pattern on the\n'scope face, yet, as his eyes followed that pip, he sensed tension in\nthe watching men that seemed sinister, almost murderous. How?\n\nWhat did the inexorably advancing pip signify?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo one spoke. The room was stifling hot and the breathing of the circle\nof men was a dull, rattling sound in Curt's ears.\n\nQuickly then, gathering sudden momentum, the pip accelerated. The\ncircle of men grew taut.\n\nThe pip crossed the red line--and vanished.\n\nOnly the smooth green trace remained, motionless and without meaning.\n\nWith hesitant shuffling of feet, the circle expanded. The men glanced\nuncertainly at one another.\n\nOne said, \"Well, that's the end of Dell. We'll soon know now if we're\non the right track, or if we've botched it. Carlson will call when he's\ncomputed it.\"\n\n\"The end of Dell?\" Curt repeated slowly, as if trying to convince\nhimself of what he knew had happened. \"The pip on the screen--that\nshowed his life leaving him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sark. \"He knew he had to go. And there are perhaps hundreds\nmore like him. But Dell couldn't have told you of that--\"\n\n\"What will we do with him?\" Brown asked abruptly.\n\n\"If Dell is dead, you murdered him!\" Curt shouted.\n\nA rising personal fear grew within him. They could not release him now,\neven though his story would make no sense to anybody. But they had\nsomehow killed Dell, or thought they had, and they wouldn't hesitate\nto kill Curt. He thought of Louise in the great house with the corpse\nof Haman Dell--if, of course, he was actually dead. But that was\nnonsense....\n\n\"Dell must have sent you to us!\" Sark said, as if a great mystery had\nsuddenly been lifted from his mind. \"He did not have time to tell you\neverything. Did he tell you to take the road behind the farm?\"\n\nCurt nodded bitterly. \"He told me it was the quickest way to get to a\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"He did? Then he knew even better than we did how rapidly he was\nslipping. Yes, this was the quickest way.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Curt demanded.\n\n\"Did Dell say anything at all about what he wanted of you?\"\n\n\"It was all wild. Something about helping with some crazy plans to\nretreat from the scientific world. He was going to finish talking in\nthe morning, but I guess it wouldn't have mattered. I realize now that\nhe was sick and irrational.\"\n\n\"Too sick to explain everything, but not irrational,\" Sark said\nthoughtfully. \"He left it to us to tell you, since you are to succeed\nhim.\"\n\n\"Succeed Dell? In what?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSark suddenly flipped a switch on a panel at his right. A screen\nlighted with some fuzzy image. It cleared with a slight dial\nadjustment, and Curt seemed to be looking at some oddly familiar\nmoonlit ruin.\n\n\"An American city,\" said Sark, hurrying his words now. \"Any city. They\nare all alike. Ruin. Death. This one died thirty years ago.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Curt complained, bewildered. \"Thirty years--\"\n\n\"At another point in the Time Continuum,\" said Sark. \"The future. Your\nfuture, you understand. Or, rather, _our_ present, the one you created\nfor us.\"\n\nCurt recoiled at the sudden venom in Sark's voice. \"The _future_?\" That\nwas what they had in common with Dell--psychosis, systematic delusions.\nHe had suspected danger before; now it was imminent and terrifying.\n\n\"Perhaps you are one of those who regard your accomplishments with\npride,\" Sark went on savagely, ignoring or unaware of Curt's fear and\nhorror. \"That the hydrogen bombs smashed the cities, and the aerosols\ndestroyed the remnants of humanity seems insignificant to you beside\nthe high technical achievement these things represent.\"\n\nCurt's throat was dry with panic. Irrelevantly, he recalled the\npain-fired eyes of Dell and the dying scientist's words: \"The\nresponsibility for the coming destruction of civilization lies at the\ndoors of the scientist mercenaries--\"\n\n\"Some of us _did_ manage to survive,\" said Sark, glaring at the scene\nof gaunt rubble. Curt could see the veins pounding beneath the thin\nflesh of his forehead. \"We lived for twenty years with the dream of\nrebuilding a world, the same dream that has followed all wars. But at\nlast we knew that the dream was truly vain this time. We survivors\nlived in hermetically sealed caverns, trying to exist and recover our\nlost science and technology.\n\n\"We could not emerge into the Earth's atmosphere. Its pollution with\nvirulent aerosols would persist for another hundred years. We could\nnot bear a new race out of these famished and rickety bodies of ours.\nUnless Man was to vanish completely from the face of the Earth, we had\nonly a single hope. That hope was to prevent the destruction from ever\noccurring!\"\n\nSark's eyes were burning now. \"Do you understand what that means? We\nhad to go _back_, not forward. We had to arm to fight a new war, a war\nto prevent the final war that destroyed Mankind.\"\n\n\"Back? How could you go back?\" Curt hesitated, grasping now the full\ninsanity of the scene about him. \"How have you _come_ back?\" He waited\ntautly for the answer. It would be gibberish, of course, like all the\nmad conversation before it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The undisturbed flow of time from the beginning to the end--neither of\nwhich we can experience--we call the Prime Continuum,\" Sark replied.\n\"Mathematically speaking, it is composed of billions of separate bands\nof probability running side by side. For analogy, you may liken it to a\ngreat river, whose many insignificant tributaries merge into a roaring,\nturbulent whole. That is the flow of time, the Prime Continuum.\n\n\"You may change one of these tributaries, dam it up, turn it aside,\nlet it reach the main stream at a different point. No matter how\ninsignificant the tributary, the stream will not be the same after\nthe change. That is what we are doing. We are controlling critical\ntributaries of the Prime Continuum, altering the hell that you\nscientists have so generously handed down to us.\n\n\"Dell was a critical tributary. You, Dr. Curtis Johnson, are another.\nChanging or destroying such key individuals snips off branches of\nknowledge before they come into fruit.\"\n\nIt was an ungraspable answer, but it had to be argued against because\nof its conclusion. \"The scientists are not bringing about the war,\"\nCurt said, looking from one fleshless face to another. \"Find the\npoliticians responsible, those willing to turn loose any horror to gain\npower. _They_ are the ones you want.\"\n\n\"That would mean destroying half the human race. In your day, nearly\nevery man is literally a politician.\"\n\n\"Talk sense!\" Curt said angrily.\n\n\"A politician, as we have come to define him, is simply one willing to\nsacrifice the common good for his own ends. It is a highly infectious\ndisease in a day when altruism is taken for cowardice or mere\nstupidity. No, we have not mistaken our goal, Dr. Johnson. We cannot\nhasten the maturity of the race. We can only hope to take the matches\naway so the children cannot burn the house down. Whatever you doubt, do\nnot doubt that we are from the future or that we caused Dell's death.\nHe is only one of many.\"\n\nCurt slumped. \"I did doubt it. I still do, yet not with conviction.\nWhy?\"\n\n\"Because your own sense of guilt tells you that you and Dell and others\nlike you are literally the matches which we have to remove. Because\nyour knowledge of science has overcome your desire not to believe.\nBecause you _know_ the shape of the future.\"\n\n\"The war after the Third World War--\" Curt murmured. \"Someone said it\nwould be fought with stones and spears, but your weapons are far from\nstones and spears.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not so far at that,\" said Sark, his face twisting wryly. He\nreached to a nearby table and picked up a tomato and a carrot. \"These\nare our weapons. As humble and primitive as the stones and spears of\ncavemen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You're joking,\" Curt replied, almost ready to grin.\n\n\"No. This is the ultimate development of biological warfare. Man is\nwhat he eats--\"\n\n\"That's what Dell's sign said.\"\n\n\"We operate hundreds of gardens and farms such as Dell's. We work\nthrough the fertilizing compounds we supply to these farms. These\ncompounds contain chemicals that eventually lodge in the cells of those\nwho eat the produce. They take up stations within the brain cells and\nchange the man--or destroy him.\n\n\"Certain cells of the brain are responsible for specific\ncharacteristics. Ways of altering these cells were found by introducing\nminute quantities of specific radioactive materials which could be\nincorporated into vegetable foods. During the Third War wholesale\ninsanity was produced in entire populations by similar methods. Here,\nwe are using it to accomplish humane purposes.\n\n\"We are simply restraining the scientists responsible for the\ndestroying weapons that produced our nightmare world. You saw the\nchange that took place in Dell. There is a good example of what we do.\"\n\n\"But he _did_ change,\" Curt pointed out. \"He _was_ carrying out your\nwork. Wasn't that enough for you? Why did you decide he had to die?\"\n\n\"Ordinarily, we don't want to kill if the change is produced. Sometimes\nthe brain cells are refractory and the characteristics too ingrained.\nThe cells develop tumorous activity as a result of the treatment. So\nit was with Dell. In his case, however, we would have been forced to\nkill him by other means if he had not died as he did. This, too, he\nunderstood very well. That was why he really wanted no doctor to help\nhim.\"\n\n\"You must have driven him insane first!\"\n\n\"Look at this and see if you still think so.\" Sark led the way to a\nsmall instrument and pointed to the eyepiece of it. \"Look in there.\"\n\nCurt bent over. Light sprang up at Sark's touch of a switch. Then a\nscene began to move before Curt's eyes.\n\n\"Dell!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe scene was of some vast and well-equipped biological laboratory,\nmuch like those of Camp Detrick. Silent, mask-faced technicians moved\nwith precision about their tasks. Dr. Dell was directing operations.\n\nBut there was something wrong. The figure was not the Dell that Curt\nknew.\n\nAs if Sark sensed Curt's comprehension of this, the scene advanced and\nswelled until the whole area of vision was filled with Dell's face.\nCurt gasped. The face was blank and hideous. The eyes stared. When\nthe scene retreated once more, Curt saw now that Dell moved as an\nautomaton, almost without volition of his own.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he moved away from the bench like a sleepwalker, there came briefly\ninto view the figure of an armed guard at the door. The figure of a\ncorporal, grim in battle dress.\n\nCurt looked up, sick as if some inner sense had divined the meaning of\nthat scene which he could not yet put into words.\n\n\"Had enough?\" asked Sark.\n\n\"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"That is Dell as he would have been. That is what he was willing to die\nto avoid.\"\n\n\"But what _is_ it?\"\n\n\"A military research laboratory twelve years into your future. You\nare aware that in your own time a good deal of research has come\nto a standstill because many first-string scientists have revolted\nagainst military domination. Unfortunately, there are plenty of\nsecond-stringers available and they are enough for most tasks--the\nyoungsters with new Ph.D.s who are awed by the glitter of golden\nlaboratories. But, lacking experience or imagination, they can't see\nthrough the glitter or have the insight for great work. Some will\neventually, too late, however, and they will be replaced by eager new\nyoungsters.\"\n\n\"This scene of Dell--\"\n\n\"Just twelve years from what you call now. Deadlier weapons will be\nneeded and so a bill will be passed to draft the reluctant first-line\nmen--against their will, if necessary.\"\n\n\"You can't force creative work,\" Curt objected.\n\nSark shrugged. \"There are drugs that do wonderful and terrible things\nto men's minds. They can force creation or mindless destruction,\nconfession or outrageous subterfuge. You saw your opponents make some\nuse of them. A cardinal, for example, and an engineer, among others.\nNow you have seen your friend, Dell, as he would have been. Not the\nsame drugs, of course, but the end result is the same.\"\n\nCurt's horror turned to stubborn disbelief. \"America wouldn't use such\nmethods,\" he said flatly.\n\n\"Today? No,\" agreed Sark. \"But when a country is committed to\ninhuman warfare--even though the goal may be honorable--where is\nthe line to stop at? Each brutality prepares the way for the next.\nEven concentration camps and extermination centers become logical\nnecessities. You have heard your opponents say that the end justifies\nthe means. You have seen for yourself--the means become the end.\"\n\n\"But Dell could have escaped,\" Curt protested. \"You could have helped\nhim to your own time or another. He was still valuable. He needn't have\ndied!\"\n\n\"There is no such thing as actual travel in time,\" explained Sark.\n\"Or at least in our day we have found none. There is possible only a\nbending back of a branch of the Prime Continuum so that we can witness,\nwarn, instruct, gain aid in saving the future. And there can be meeting\nonly in this narrow sector of unreality where the branch joins the\nmain stream. Our farms adjoin such sectors, but farther than that we\ncannot go, nor can one of you become a citizen of the world you have\ncreated for us.\n\n\"But I wish it were so!\" Sark bit out venomously. \"We'd kidnap you\nby the millions, force you to look upon the ruin and the horror, let\nyou breathe the atmosphere that no man can inhale and live, the only\natmosphere there is in that world. Yes, I wish you could become our\nguests there. Our problem would be easier. But it can't be done. This\nis the only way we can work.\n\n\"Dell had to go. There was no escape for him, no safety for us if he\nlived. He would have been tracked down, captured like a beast and set\nto work against his will. It was there in the Prime Continuum. Nothing\ncould cancel it except death, the death that saves a billion lives\nbecause he will not produce a toxin deadlier than D. triconus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vengeance in Sark's voice was almost tangible. Involuntarily Curt\nretreated a step before it. And--almost--he thought he understood these\nmen out of time.\n\n\"What is there--\" he began hoarsely and had to stop. \"What is there\nthat I can do?\"\n\n\"We need you to take over Dell's farm. It is of key importance. The\nlist of men he was treating was an extremely vital one. That work\ncannot be interrupted now.\"\n\n\"How can you accomplish anything by operating only here?\" Curt\nobjected. \"While you stifle our defenses, our enemies are arming to the\nteeth. When you've made us sufficiently helpless, they'll strike.\"\n\n\"Did I say we were so restricted?\" answered Sark, smiling for the first\ntime. \"You cannot imagine what a fresh vegetable means on a professor's\ntable in Moscow. In Atomgrad a ripe tomato is worth a pound of uranium.\nHow do I know? Because I walked the streets of Atomgrad with my\ngrandfather.\"\n\n\"Then you're a--\"\n\nSark's face grew hard and bitter in the half light of the room. \"Was,\"\nhe corrected. \"Or might have been. There are no nationalities where\nthere are no nations, no political parties where there are only hunger\nand death. The crime of the future is not any person's or country's. It\nis the whole of humanity's.\"\n\nAn alarm sounded abruptly.\n\n\"Carlson!\" someone tensely exclaimed.\n\nSark whirled to the panels and adjusted the controls. A small screen\nlighted, showing the image of a man with graying hair and imperious\nface. His sharp eyes seemed to burn directly into Curt's.\n\n\"How did it go?\" exclaimed Sark. \"Was the Prime Continuum shift as\nexpected?\"\n\n\"No! It still doesn't compute out. Nothing's right. The war is still\ngoing on. The Continuum is absolute hell.\"\n\n\"I should have known,\" said Sark in dismay. \"I should have called you.\"\n\n\"What is it? Do you know what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Johnson. Dr. Curtis Johnson. He's here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRage spread upon Carlson's face. An oath exploded from his lips.\n\"No wonder the situation doesn't compute with him out of the Prime\nContinuum. Why did he come there?\"\n\n\"Dell sent him. Dell died too quickly. He didn't have time to instruct\nJohnson. I have told him what we want of him.\"\n\n\"Do you understand?\" Carlson demanded of Curt with abruptness that was\nalmost anger.\n\nCurt looked slowly about the room and back to the face of his\nquestioner. Understand? If they sent him back, allowed him to go back,\ncould he ever be sure that he had not witnessed a thing of nightmare in\nthis shadowy dream world?\n\nYes, he could be sure. He had seen the blasted city, just the way he\nknew it could be--_would_ be unless someone prevented it. He had seen\nthe pattern on the scope, attuned to the tiny tributary of the Prime\nContinuum that was the life of Dr. Dell, had seen it run out, dying as\nDell had died.\n\nHe could believe, too, that there was a little farm near Atomgrad,\nwhere a tomato on a scientist's table was more potent than the bombs\nbuilding in the arsenal.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said. \"Shall I go back now?\"\n\nSark put a paper into his hands. \"Here is a list of new names. You will\nfind Dell's procedures and records in his desk at the farm. Do not\nunderestimate the importance of your work. You have seen the failure of\nthe Prime Continuum to compute properly with you out of it. You will\ncorrect that.\n\n\"Your only contact from now on will be through Brown, who will bring\nthe tank truck once a year. You know what to do. You are on your own.\"\n\nIt was like a surrealist painting as he left. The moon had risen, and\nin all the barrenness there was nothing but the gray cement cube of\nthe building. The light spilling through the open doorway touched the\nhalf dozen gaunt men who had followed him out to the car. Ahead was the\nnarrow band of roadway leading through some infinite nothingness that\nwould end in Dell's truck farm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started off. When he looked back a moment later, the building was no\nlonger there.\n\nHe glanced at the list of names Sark gave him, chilled by the\nimportance of those men. For some there would be death as there had\nbeen for Dell. For himself--\n\nHe had forgotten to ask. But perhaps they would not have told him. Not\nat this time, anyway. The chemically treated food produced tumors in\nrefractory, unresponsive cells. He had eaten Dell's vegetables, would\neat more.\n\nIt was too late to ask and it didn't matter. He had important things to\ndo. First would be the writing of his resignation to the officials of\nCamp Detrick.\n\nAs of tomorrow, he would be Dr. Curtis Johnson, truck farmer,\nspecialist in atomic-age produce, luscious table gifts for the innocent\nand not-so-innocent human matches that would, if he and his unknown\ncolleagues succeeded, be prevented from cremating the hopes of Mankind.\n\nLouise would help him hang the new sign:\n\n    YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT\n        Eat the Best\n        EAT JOHNSON'S\n         VEGETABLES\n\nOnly, of course, she wouldn't know why he had taken Dell's job, nor\ncould he ever explain.\n\nIt would probably be the death of Curt Johnson, but that was cheap\nenough if humanity survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Stone and a Spear, by Raymond F.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
