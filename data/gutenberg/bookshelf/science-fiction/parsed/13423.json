One says \"discovery\" advisedly, but let it not be\nimagined that communication with the planet Mars was established as a\nresult of any careful and systematic research, or that I possessed a\nsubtle genius for astronomical science that was destined to introduce\ninto society what must eventually revolutionize it. Nothing could be\nfurther from the facts. Into the daily grind of my absolutely uneventful\ncareer, burst the almost terrifying revelations with a suddenness that\nstunned me, while I was engaged in experiments of an entirely extraneous\nnature. Albeit one wonders that the Martian rays, which have swept our\nplanet with their searching gaze for so many centuries, were not\ndiscovered long ago. But this is anticipating my story.\n\nI had reached the age of thirty, when, in the Spring of 19--, I sailed\nout of New York harbor on board _La Provence_, en route for Paris. It\nwas not so much my purpose to seek pleasure as the determination to turn\nmy eight years of experience in the United States to some avenue of\nprofitable livelihood, that decided me to make the journey, although I\nlooked forward with no small degree of pleasant anticipation to meeting\nsome of my fellow students in the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris, where\nI had received five years of excellent training.\n\nMy trip across and my subsequent arrival in Paris were without any\nevents of particular interest, and one bright morning in the early\nsummer I found myself comfortably lodged in the house where I had\npreviously boarded while a student. Connected with my rooms, which were\nat the top of the house, was one of considerable size that I had\nformerly used as a laboratory, and this I now set about fitting up to\nserve the same purpose. The daylight found its way into the room through\na skylight, and though admirably suited for an artist's studio, it\nanswered my purpose equally as well.\n\nI had collected many new instruments and appliances by dint of days\nspent in shopping, and was anxious to begin work in earnest, when one\nevening, as I glanced through the columns of a newspaper, my attention\nwas arrested by an article of particular interest. This set forth the\ngreat and increasing demand for a substitute for glass, one which would\nanswer the purpose in every respect, and at the same time be\nindestructible and a good conductor of sound. The article concluded with\nan enumeration of the many uses for which such a substitute would be\ninvaluable, hinting at the enormous financial possibilities which would\nbe open to the inventor. The more I considered the matter, the more\ndesirous I became to test several theories which forthwith presented\nthemselves to my mind, and the next morning found me determined to begin\nmy experiments at once. In theory, I saw the solution of the problem in\nartificially producing increased atomic motion, and with that object in\nview I went to work.\n\nMy experiments involved me in weeks of hard work, and it was toward the\nend of the summer before I could admit having had any important results.\nI now had a substance resembling glass in appearance, though vastly\ndifferent in composition, which I made into a film, extremely thin and\nhighly sensitive to vibrations. Running through this film were slender\nwires made of various metals, about one inch apart, which served not\nonly to give rigidity to the film, but also to conduct a current of\nelectricity through it, engendering a high state of atomic agitation.\nThe current was controlled by a small switch placed in a heavy box-like\nframe, which bounded the film on its four sides and contained the\nbatteries, coils, etc. To this were attached four legs, supporting it\nabout the height of an ordinary table from the floor. The whole device\nmeasured about seven feet square.\n\nThis film substance contained certain elements which I had found to be\nnecessary to secure the desired intensity of agitation. It had taken me\nalmost a month to secure the fine quality I desired, and I looked\nforward to the test with the feeling that results would prove that I was\nnearing the goal, if I had not actually attained it.\n\nAt last the day arrived when my device was ready for the test. I had\nworked all the afternoon giving the finishing touches and it had grown\ndusk without my realizing it. But everything was now ready, and moving\nthe switch, I turned the current of electricity through the composition.\nJust as I was about to begin my test, I noticed what appeared to be a\nfaint shadow of a man move across the surface of the film. My first\nthought was that someone had entered the room without my knowledge, and\nhis figure had been reflected on the surface of the film, which was\nhighly glazed, but a glance around the room assured me that this\nexplanation was untenable. Moreover, I found, upon further\ninvestigation, that the film was lying in such a position that it would\nbe impossible to reflect any person in the room. I then examined the\nskylight, only to find that, owing to the sharp inclination of the roof,\nit would be an utter impossibility for anyone to reach it from the\noutside without the aid of a ladder. I investigated this source further,\nthinking to find the reflection on the film to be from some street in\nthe city below, but on account of the extent of the roof, no street was\nvisible from the skylight.\n\nCompletely baffled, I descended into the room again and turned on the\ncurrent. Immediately the shadow appeared on the film, and this time, in\nconsequence of the room now being quite dark, I noticed that it was\nsurrounded by a phosphorus-colored glow. The figure was certainly that\nof a man, although very faint, and it became evident to me, after\nwatching it for a while, that he was trying to signal with his arms.\n\nI now noticed that, in addition to the peculiar light on the film, the\nentire surface seemed to vibrate with frequent, but scarcely audible,\nhumming sounds. Upon turning off the current all disappeared, only to\nreappear when I switched it on again. It was evident then that the\nphenomenon was caused only when the instrument was charged with\nelectricity, and consequently was no ordinary reflection, as I had at\nfirst supposed.\n\nEverything pointed to its being the manifestation of some outside\nagency; possibly electrical waves which my apparatus received and in a\nmeasure responded to, coming through the open skylight from--where? The\nquestion reiterated itself in my mind, as I stood gazing perplexedly at\nthe phenomenon. I might have been satisfied with the supposition that,\nunknowingly, I had made an instrument which was capable of receiving\nwireless waves from another instrument of similar tone in or near Paris,\nif I had had only the humming sounds to contend with, but the shadow\nimpelled me to look for the reason further than this. I glanced upward,\neagerly seeking some explanation. One star was visible through the open\nskylight--Mars. Clear and bright it shone in the inky blackness framed\nby the window.\n\nOnce more I climbed to the skylight, feeling that I must seek the\nexplanation in that direction, when my attention was suddenly turned to\nthe apparatus below me. The glow was slowly passing off one side of the\nfilm. I hastily descended and examined the batteries, thinking I would\nfind the cause of this in a failing current, but all was apparently in\nperfect order. Still the glow and shadow moved steadily off, growing\nfainter every moment, until it disappeared completely.\n\nWith a sudden impulse, born of a weird and almost terrifying thought, I\nbent over until my eyes were on a level with the film, then I looked\nupward; the star was no longer visible from the position of the\ninstrument, it had risen above the frame of the window. At once I was\nseized with an intense excitement; could it be possible that my\napparatus was responding to waves mysteriously projected from Mars? If\nnot, why had the glow and shadow faded from the film at the same instant\nthat Mars disappeared above the window frame?\n\nHoping to test this further, I endeavored to move the apparatus to a\nposition where Mars would again be visible, but alas, I found it much\ntoo heavy. I felt keenly disappointed at the sudden termination of this\nstrange phenomenon, but, upon reflection, I realized that it was only\nthe simultaneous disappearance of Mars and the glow on the film that had\ncaused me to attribute waves to that far source. The more I pondered\nupon the matter, the more impossible it seemed, yet, strange to say, the\nmore convinced I became that the theory was correct. Light-waves, I\nargued, unlike the wireless waves in common use, could be received only\nwhen the two objects were in line of vision; but I realized that if they\nwere of Martian origin they were of remarkable magnification, projected\nthrough space by some unknown and powerful agent, thousands of times\nmore powerful than electricity as we know it upon Earth. That the shadow\non the film had been that of a Martian, I dared not hope. Though my mind\ncontinually reverted to this wild conjecture, I impatiently put it\naside, as the apparent impossibility of it all would force itself upon\nme.\n\nNothing further could be done that night, and as I had worked hard all\nday preparing for my experiment, without even stopping for meals, I now\nfelt the effect of the excitement I had undergone and resolved to take a\nwalk in the cool air, I wanted to think, and, if possible, to plan a\nline of action for the morrow which would bring me better results, if my\ntheory of light-waves should prove to be correct. Needless to say, I\ndetermined to cease my former experiments, and devote all my energy to\nascertaining whether my apparatus was actually responding to Martian\nlight-waves of remarkable integrity, and if such proved to be the case,\nto put every effort into improving the device with the hope of obtaining\ntheir import. I also determined to keep my discovery a secret, at least\nfor the present.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE MARTIAN.\n\n\nI returned to my rooms with a much clearer conception of the conditions\nwith which I had to cope, if the waves to which my apparatus responded\nshould prove to be Martian waves. My mind was fully made up to proceed\nas if this were an established fact, as, in order to give my best\nefforts to improving my apparatus, I felt that I must eliminate all\nscepticism. I clearly appreciated the advantage of moving my instrument\noutside, where I could command a view of Mars for a much longer time,\nbut the necessity of being in my laboratory while I was engaged in these\nimprovements, decided me against any immediate change.\n\nAccordingly I proceeded the next morning to make the changes I deemed\nnecessary, being goaded into a fever of haste by a feeling of\nsuppressed excitement. The composition I had used in the form of a film\nI now liquefied, having concluded that in the former condition, although\nnecessary in my original experiments, it now only retarded the vibration\nof the wires.\n\nThat this composition was essential there could be no doubt, as it was\nits elements that responded to the agent used on Mars to project the\nwaves. I therefore liquefied the film substance, being careful in so\ndoing not to alter its properties. I then procured wires, much thinner\nthan those I had previously used, and dipped them-into the liquid. After\nthey had become perfectly dry, I stretched them on the frame as close\ntogether as I could without their coming into contact with one another.\nAs light-waves are received in hundreds of different vibrations\nsimultaneously, according to the light or shade of the object projected,\nI concluded that each wire should be capable of individual vibration.\nThe device now resembled a large piece of mosquito netting with the\ncross wires removed, the coating of composition on each wire being so\nthin that it was hardly discernible. The batteries and coils I\nconnected as before, taking great care not to change their arrangement.\n\nMy preparations were now completed, and before me stood an instrument as\ndelicate and sensitive to wave vibrations as I could make it. Raising\none side of the frame a foot higher than the other, in order that the\nsurface of wires would be squarely facing the star when it appeared\nabove the casement, I waited impatiently for the moment which should\nprove the truth or falsity of my surmises.\n\nThe day had closed, and I spent the remaining time speculating upon the\nresults of my labors. But even the wildest flights of my imagination did\nnot picture, in the smallest degree, the wonderful transformation which\nmy new instrument would make in what had appeared before as a shadow on\nthe film. Little did I imagine to what an extent the unknown was to be\nrevealed to me.\n\nAs I stood by the side of the frame all in readiness, Mars appeared, but\nit still had a little farther to climb before it would be visible from\nthe level of the wires. Nevertheless, I turned on the current from the\nbatteries. All was darkness; never before had darkness seemed to me so\nprofound, so absolutely appalling. Minutes passed like hours, but still\nthat ominous darkness reigned. I felt the keen disappointment of\nfailure; I grew incredulous as the time passed, and found myself\nadmitting and rehearsing the absurdity of it all. I even blamed myself\nfor having been so easily deflected from my former experiments, by what\nnow seemed to be merely an idle fancy.\n\nSuddenly I bent over the frame and gazed eagerly at the surface of\nwires, for there, on the top edge, appeared a touch of the\nphosphorus-colored glow. My heart thumped with wild excitement. I\nstooped down until my eyes were on the level of the wires, and looking\nup toward the window I could just see the rim of Mars appearing above\nthe casement. A shout of joy burst from my lips at the sight of it, for\nit was now beyond all doubt that the phenomenon was attributable to\nMars. Brighter and brighter became the light as it covered the surface\nof wires, until all its resemblance to a phosphorus glow had gone, and\nit shone with such brilliancy that my eyes, accustomed as they were to\nthe darkness of the room, quailed before it. Turning away so that my\neyes might gradually become accustomed to the glare, I noticed that in\nspite of the brilliant white light on the surface of the wires, the room\nwas in perfect darkness--the light had no power of illumination!\nImpenetrable mystery enshrouded the agent which Mars was employing to\ncommunicate with Earth!\n\nA curious humming sound issuing from the frame, much louder than I had\nnoticed the night before, caused me to turn involuntarily, and as I did\nso I uttered a cry of wonder at the marvelous vision that met my eyes.\nThere lay before me, as bright as daylight, a picture that a thousand\ntimes surpassed my highest, wildest hope. The great secret of another\nplanet was revealed, and I stood motionless, beholding an inhabitant of\na star millions of miles away.\n\nAmong the vast multitude who for centuries have yearned for a glimpse\ninto the unknown worlds that surround us, I stood alone gazing upon the\nimage of a Martian. The thought stunned me; I was seized with a wild\nimpulse to rush out into the street and bring in the throng, that they\nmight look upon the form of this wonderful being on our sister planet.\nBut what proof was there to give them that this was so? I would\nundoubtedly be ridiculed and accused of trickery. The very fact that had\nbrought a cry of amazement to my lips--the remarkable brilliancy and\nclearness of the image, and the appearance of the Martian himself--would\nserve to bring discredit upon anything I might say. Personally I had\nample proof that the image was that of a Martian, but what instant proof\ncould I give a jeering crowd? I had expected to find in a Martian a\nstrange grotesque being in appearance, if not in mind, much after the\nweird and fierce character so many authors have portrayed him. Judge,\nthen, my astonishment when I beheld one who, in every particular of form\nand feature, resembled the people of Earth.\n\nHe appeared to be a man of about forty years of age, judging by our\nearthly standard of time, possessing clear-cut features and dark\ncomplexion. His face, which was clean-shaven, was remarkably handsome,\nand his piercing dark eyes, although they enhanced the smile that\ngreeted my appearance at the instrument, seemed to search into my very\nsoul and to hold me spellbound with mute challenge. Nor could I, upon\nafterthought, remember having shown the common courtesy of returning his\ngreeting.\n\nMy astonishment was so great that every faculty seemed to leave me, and\nI stood transfixed, staring at the image of the Martian without even the\npower of thought. Gradually recovering my senses, however, I took note\nof the man and his surroundings. He stood in a room of about the same\ndimensions as my laboratory, which seemed to be flooded with bright\ndaylight, though I could not see any windows on three sides of the room\nto admit the light, nor any shadows to indicate that the light came from\na window in the fourth. He held in his hands an instrument unknown to\nme, and seemed to be perfectly at his ease, showing neither surprise nor\ncuriosity. Evidently this was not the first time that he had seen an\ninhabitant of the Earth. So unconcerned was he and so natural did he\nappear, even in the smallest detail of dress, that it was hard to\nbelieve I was not looking at an image of some room and its occupant in\nParis. His close-fitting clothes seemed to be of a dark green material,\nand resembled, to some degree, the uniform of an army officer.\n\nBending over the instrument he held, he placed his mouth close to the\ntop of it, and immediately the humming sounds, which I had noticed\nbefore, emanated from the wires of my apparatus. The thought flashed\nthrough my mind that the Martian held in this instrument a means of\ncommunicating sound. If so, what were the words--what language? The\npossibility of what I heard being words, made me strain every nerve to\ncatch the slightest resemblance to such sounds, but alas, with no\nsuccess. That they were intended to convey a message, I became fully\nconvinced, but I could not rest in the belief that this jumble of sounds\nwas the Martian language. If the Martians themselves resembled, in so\nstriking a degree, the inhabitants of Earth, I argued, then it was in\nthe nature of things to expect a language that, in some way,\ncorresponded to one of our languages. The fault lay in my instrument, I\nwas sure of that, and in the keen disappointment of my failure to\nreceive his message and the excitement of the moment, I gave utterance\nto an exclamation of despair. Immediately a smile overspread the\nMartian's countenance, and, to my great astonishment, he put down the\ninstrument and clapped his hands by way of showing his approval.\n\nBefore I could recover from my surprise at this new evidence of Martian\nfamiliarity with the customs of Earth, the light suddenly grew dim and\nin a few seconds had disappeared completely, leaving the instrument\nplunged in darkness. Mars had risen above the frame of the skylight, and\nI was no longer in contact with the light-waves. I listened intently,\nthinking that if the sound-waves were of the nature of the\nelectrical-waves we employ in the wireless system, I would still be in\ntouch with my newly found friend, but I heard no further sound from the\ninstrument, thus proving that these waves also were projected by the\nmysterious agent known only to the Martians.\n\nI had so much to occupy my mind, with what I had just witnessed, and so\nmany thoughts rushed in upon me regarding the perfecting of my\ninstrument so that it might properly respond to the sound-waves, that I\ndid not experience the disappointment I had felt before at the short\nduration of our contact with each other. I was glad of the opportunity\nto think; I felt that it was necessary to do so before further action,\nif I ever hoped to attain the knowledge of Mars and its inhabitants that\nmy remarkable discovery had placed within my reach. I determined that on\nthe morrow, if I did not meet with better results in the sound\nvibrations, I would try to communicate with the Martian by writing some\nsimple sentence in a bold hand, and in as many languages as I could.\nThis I would expose in front of the instrument, but I placed little hope\nin the success of the scheme, for it was not possible that the Martian\nlanguage would be identical with any of ours.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE VOICE FROM ANOTHER WORLD\n\n\nThis thought of communicating with the Martian by writing, did not deter\nme from using every effort to perfect my instrument, so that this might\nbe done verbally, or that at least I might hear a voice and a language\nspoken on a world millions of miles away. Accordingly I gave the subject\nof sound-waves my best thought, and the next morning I had formulated\nclearly laid principles upon which to work. By these I hoped to make an\ninstrument that would be the means of conversing with a Martian.\n\nI had come to the conclusion that the jumble of sound was caused by the\nprolonged vibration of the wires after each distinct wave from Mars was\nreceived, as the wires of a piano will vibrate long after they have been\ntouched. With light-waves it was necessary to have a highly sensitive\nsurface of the composition, capable of responding to many different\nvibrations, according to the light or shade of the object projected.\nThis accounted for the success I met with upon adopting the coated\nwires, and I concluded thereupon that they were indispensable. But I now\nsaw that the presence of wires in the composition, though successful\nwith light-waves, was inimical to sound-waves, and it became evident\nthat a firmer but highly sensitive surface was required. The film had\nnot brought good results, either from sound-waves or light-waves, but,\nit will be remembered, there were wires running through it to give it\nrigidity, which, although necessary in my original experiments, must be\navoided in connection with sound vibrations. Clearly my new film must\nnot be rigid. I thereupon made a film of composition, as thin as\npossible, and stretched it upon the frame of my instrument, as a\ndiaphragm behind the wires, hoping that the sound-waves would pass\nbetween the wires, and vibrate the diaphragm, which, being made of\ncomposition, would undoubtedly glow, but not more than the film had\ndone. This, I concluded, would not interfere with the image on the\nwires, owing to the brilliancy of the latter.\n\nI was now hopeful of success, and anxiously waited for the day to close.\nEverything was in readiness by noon, and I had at least eight hours to\nwait before Mars would be in a position for wave contact. But now\nappeared an adversary with which I had not reckoned. Clouds began to\ngather, thin and fleecy at first, but growing heavier as the afternoon\npassed, until by evening the heavens were completely obscured. This was\na condition that might last for several days, and the dread of it filled\nme with despair. How could I wait for days inactive, without seeing or\neven hearing from my friend in Mars?\n\nIt now occurred to me how absolutely absorbed I had become in the\nMartian investigation. Ordinarily a sociable person, in the past week I\nhad become a recluse. College friends that I had seen almost daily since\nmy return to Paris, I now completely neglected, even shunned, lest they\nshould call at my rooms some evening when I was in wave contact with\nMars. It also occurred to me that, as surely as my friendship and\nnecessity for them was declining, in like ratio was increasing an\nattachment for an inhabitant of another world. I felt a strange soul\nkinship for this Martian, which seemed to spring up the moment I saw his\nimage portrayed on my instrument. And the feeling was not one of\nordinary friendship. I felt I was drawn to him by some mysterious power,\nthat gave him the place of a brother in my affections--a power that\nseemed to have brought us together, and now united us with a great\ncommon and compelling interest. And yet as I pictured his handsome,\nalmost beautiful face, there was still another face I had seen--but\nwhere? The Martian had been alone, yet I was conscious of a face that\nwas wonderfully beautiful, that seemed the goal for which I was\nstriving. It led me to greater effort after failure; the face which I\nyearned to see and yet strangely dreaded seeing.\n\nIt was useless for me to try to understand such thoughts, and to banish\nthem from my mind was impossible. I was overcome with a sense of\nloneliness. Looking at my watch, I found that it was already past the\nhour when Mars would be visible through the window on a clear night,\nbut, alas, the sky showed no signs of clearing; though my instrument\nstood ready, it was useless.\n\nBut, obeying some irresistible impulse, I decided to turn on the current\nand stand by the instrument in case an opening in the clouds should\noccur, for even a moment. I therefore turned the switch that controlled\nthe current, and immediately, to my astonishment, the surface of wires\nbecame as brilliant as on the previous evening under a clear sky.\nTurning away for a moment, to allow my eyes to become accustomed to the\nbrilliancy, I noticed that the sky was still overcast with heavy rain\nclouds. My joy at the discovery that the Martian projecting agent was\nnot arrested by vapor was unbounded, for it meant that I could be in\nwave-contact with Mars every night, during the period that the planet\nwas visible from Earth.\n\nI approached the instrument with the intention of at once testing the\ndiaphragm, but, to my surprise, my Martian friend was not there to greet\nme. The room and its furnishings, however, were depicted as clearly as\nbefore, and I now had an opportunity to note the instruments, the large\nvolumes of books, and the maps of the heavens which hung on the wall.\nEverything pointed to this being a fully equipped Martian observatory,\nthough the instruments were entirely strange to me. I was examining\nthese latter more closely, when heavy porti\u00e8res parted, and my Martian\nfriend stepped into the room. So anxious was I to give him a pleasant\ngreeting, instead of staring at him in a semi-stupefied condition, as I\nhad done previously, that I forgot, for the moment, my determination to\ntest my diaphragm at the first opportunity, and greeted him merely with\na smile and a bow.\n\nMy serene demeanor lasted but a moment, for simultaneously with his\nbowed response to my greeting, came in a clear voice, with perfect\naccent: \"Bon soir, Monsieur!\"\n\nI started back, for it seemed as if someone in the room had spoken, but\nthen I noticed that the Martian held in his hand the instrument I had\nseen on the previous evening. Was it possible that this was his voice,\nspeaking French from a distance of millions of miles as clearly as if he\nwere in the room? The thing was incredible! How could a Martian know a\nlanguage evolved here on Earth? Was the whole thing then a delusion of\nan overwrought mind? I stood staring at the instrument in amazement.\n\nThe Martian, now seeing by my actions that his voice had been heard,\nraised his instrument and repeated his greeting. The voice rang as\nclearly as before; there could be no further doubt; through this\nwonderful instrument the Martian's voice was projected, almost\ninstantaneously to the Earth--millions of miles in a second. The\nmysterious power which enabled the Martian to project the waves,\ncompared with our electricity as the telegraph does with the\nstage-coach. Was it strange that I stood aghast, as my mind slowly\ncomprehended the enormous distance which that voice had traversed almost\ninstantaneously?\n\nIt was some moments before my amazement permitted me to respond to this\nextraordinary salutation, then--my mind still too bewildered properly to\ngrasp the situation--I mumbled something in English about my great\nastonishment at hearing a language of Earth spoken from a distant world.\n\nThe sound of my voice seemed to cause the Martian some surprise, but\nimmediately his voice issued again in clear tones from the instrument.\n\n\"I greeted you in what I supposed was your native tongue,\" he said in\nperfect English. \"Although now we have but one composite language here,\nover a thousand years ago we spoke in many languages, as the people of\nyour planet do at the present time.\n\n\"For more than six hundred years we have been able to observe the\nprogress of your planet,\" he went on, \"through an instrument by which\nlight-waves are projected and received, and have found it to be\nidentical with ours of almost fifteen hundred years ago. By the placards\nin the streets of your cities and towns, we discovered that you also\nspoke in many tongues, and although the progress was necessarily slow,\nour astronomers were, by this means, able to learn the principal\nlanguages of Earth.\n\n\"Anxiously we have watched and waited for the discovery of an instrument\nthat would respond to our projected light-waves and reveal to you the\ninhabitants of your neighboring planet. At last this momentous time has\narrived. I congratulate you upon bringing it about.\"\n\nAs he spoke, his voice, coming from the diaphragm of my instrument,\nsounded as distinct as if he were in the room, and his image, depicted\nlife-size, made it hard to believe that he was more than a few feet\naway. That my informant was, in reality, millions of miles away, my mind\nabsolutely refused to grasp.\n\nA thousand questions to put to my Martian acquaintance rushed into my\nmind, but alas, in supposing that I could not come in contact with Mars\non account of cloud obscurity, I had lost much of the precious time, and\nnow the waning light on my instrument warned me that the planet would,\nin a few moments, pass out of range. We therefore hastily bade each\nother adieu, promising to continue our conversation on the morrow, as\nthough we had parted at a street corner. The light now faded completely,\nand the instrument, that a few moments previously had been animated with\nsuch an exuberance of life and mystery, now stood before me wrapped in\nprofound darkness and silence.\n\nHow impossible, how inconceivable it all seemed! How the outside world\nwould scoff if I attempted to explain or publish my discovery! I felt\nthat the time had not yet come to take anyone into my confidence, and I\ndetermined still to keep all a secret. I was then unaware, however, that\nthe more I learned of Mars and its people the more closely I would guard\nmy knowledge.\n\nPacing excitedly up and down my laboratory, I spent most of the night in\nreviewing what I had heard, and speculating the rare knowledge that the\nmorrow would bring. The secrets of another world would be unfolded to\nme, and the scientific achievements of a people over a thousand years in\nadvance of us would be mine. What glorious possibilities this disclosed!\nWhat a brilliant future as a scientist such knowledge would assure me!\nAnd in the exuberance of my spirits I little thought that the possession\nof this knowledge would come to mean naught to me; for I had yet to\nlearn that man cannot share the riches of another world without also\nbecoming a partner in its sorrows and its passions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE STORY OF MARTIAN LIFE.\n\n\nWith a determination of finding a room from which I could command a\nlonger view of Mars, the next day I visited several studios which were\nfor rent, and finally succeeded in securing one formerly occupied by a\nphotographer, which was located on the top floor of a house in the\nimmediate vicinity of my old rooms.\n\nThe room was large, in fact it occupied the entire top floor of the\nbuilding, and this feature pleased me greatly. The only communication\nwith the house was by a door which had every appearance of an outside\ndoor, so heavy were the hinges and lock. The landlord, in drawing my\nattention to this, had smiled and remarked that the former tenant, who\nlived in another section of the city, had been very careful always to\nleave his studio securely locked. The ceiling of half the room was\nentirely of glass, sloping down to the floor at the angle of the roof,\nand this was the only means of obtaining air and light. It was\nconstructed in two sections, which would slide back and forth, for the\npurpose of ventilation. This arrangement, I found, would give me an\nunobstructed view of Mars for several hours each night. Nothing could be\nbetter adapted to my requirements; I could not be observed by anyone\noutside, and I need not fear being overheard while conversing with my\nMartian friend.\n\nI therefore determined to have my instrument moved at once, in order to\nbe installed in my new quarters that evening.\n\nI next bought a crate, used for large oil paintings, and upon its\ndelivery at my old rooms, I immediately commenced packing my instrument\nin it. Owing to its great weight this was no easy work, and it would\nexpress the procedure better if I said that I placed the crate around\nthe instrument. Making sure that it was all covered carefully, I had it\nmoved to my new quarters and set in place, the impression of the\ncarriers being that it was a painting which I was very anxious that no\none should see until it was completed.\n\nAs it was now within an hour of the time when I expected Mars to appear,\nI decided to leave my books and other belongings at my former rooms\nuntil the next day. I uncovered the instrument, and got everything into\nreadiness, being careful to see that the batteries were all in place, so\nthat nothing might occur to interrupt the long talk with the Martian\nwhich I was anticipating.\n\nHaving turned on the current, and opened the sliding section of the\nglass roof, I now awaited the appearance of Mars. There occurred to me\nquestion alter question that seemed of sufficient importance to prompt\nimmediate inquiry, only to be forgotten as others came into my mind;\nuntil the presence of the increasing faint glow on my instrument found\nme unprepared with any single question of actual importance.\nConsequently I decided to allow my distant informant to continue with\nthe account of Martian observations of Earth, as being at once the most\ninstructive and surest way of suggesting important questions.\n\nAs my eyes got accustomed to the brilliancy I saw the Martian waiting\nfor me, with his instrument in readiness. We greeted each other with the\naffection we both now sincerely felt, and though I could not clasp his\nhand, I endeavored in every way to show him the brotherly warmth of\nfeeling I entertained for him.\n\nIt now occurred to me that in the excitement of our first communication\nwith each other, we had completely overlooked an important\nconventionality. I therefore announced that I was known on Earth as\nHarold Lonsdale.\n\n\"My name is Almos,\" he responded, his dark eyes sparkling as he quickly\nentered into the spirit of the occasion. \"Although it was customary once\nfor us to have two or three names, we found it in better harmony with\nthe changed conditions of the present time to have but one. This you\nwill more easily understand when you have become better acquainted with\nthis planet and its people.\"\n\n\"And as I am most anxious to learn more about the conditions of life in\nyour world,\" I added, eagerly, \"I trust you will continue the account of\nMartian observations of Earth, which was barely commenced last evening\nwhen the wave contact ceased. But first let me ask how you located my\nwhereabouts, for this morning I moved to another section of the city.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he replied, with a smile, \"I was not aware you had moved.\nExperience has taught me about where to look for the large city you call\nParis, on the side of Earth that is now exposed to us, and then by\nsystematic search I soon located the response of your instrument.\n\n\"As our observations of Earth with projected light-rays have been\ncarried on for seven hundred years, it will be necessary to give you an\noutline of our history and the progress of science covering that time.\nThis will not only be of interest as a forecast of your own world's\nfuture, but will also prove of the greatest value to you, if you decide\nto visit this planet, an undertaking which I am convinced lies within\nyour power.\"\n\nHis words wrung an exclamation of astonishment from my lips, but, as\nthough not wishing to be interrupted, he went on:\n\n\"Seven hundred years ago, a power derived from that substance known on\nEarth as radium, was discovered on Mars. This power was found to be\ncapable of projecting light rays almost instantaneously through space\nfor inconceivable distances, at the same time preserving their integrity\nto such a remarkable degree that they would reach the farthest planets\nwithout diffusion or diminution. Thus my image, thrown upon the\ninstrument before me, is conveyed to Earth in light-waves by this flow\nof super-radium with such tremendous speed as to be practically\ninstantaneous; these are received in your instrument, which is\nresponsive to the flow of super-radium, in the same condition as when\nthey left Mars, consequently depicting the image life-size.\n\n\"Having come in contact with another body in the heavens, this\noutward-flowing current of super-radium is changed to an inward-flowing\ncurrent. In making this change it frees the light-waves it conveyed from\nMars, and retains the light-waves of the objects about it, which is\nmerely repeating its performance upon leaving Mars. These light-waves of\nobjects on another globe it now conveys on its return journey to Mars,\nentering a receiving instrument and depicting the objects therein\nlife-size.\n\n\"Possessing rays invisible to the human eye, except when agitated by a\nsubstance of its own nature, daylight on a planet becomes an entirely\nunnecessary adjunct to observations made with super-radium, and we are\nable to explore the dark side of planets and other heavenly bodies, just\nas effectually as those illuminated by the sun.\n\n\"Thus have we, for seven hundred years, been able to study the country,\ncities, streets, and people of Earth. And not only did we note a\nremarkable similarity in the people, buildings, and scientific progress\nto early Martian ages, but, by the advertisements, placards, and other\nstreet signs we were able to learn the principal languages spoken on\nyour planet, and these were found to correspond in a remarkable degree\nto those in use on Mars, before conditions on our planet made the\nadoption of a composite language an absolute necessity. And undoubtedly\nthese same conditions in due time will face the people of Earth.\"\n\nI could not restrain an exclamation of astonishment at this prediction,\nbut Almos at once reassured me by stating that when the time did come,\nit would be the beginning of universal peace and happiness on Earth.\n\n\"Am I to understand, then,\" said I, \"that a condition of perfect\nhappiness prevails on Mars?\"\n\n\"Unhappiness is considered a disease with us,\" Almos rejoined. \"It is\nheard of, but very rarely, and is treated as a serious malady. But you\nwill understand these things better as you gradually become acquainted\nwith the conditions here. You must remember that you are in the position\nof a man over fifteen hundred years in advance of his day.\n\n\"Having become convinced, through close observations, that the progress\nof Earth was identical with that of Mars, and that Earth, being the\nyounger planet, was consequently following our lead, we anxiously\nwatched for the discovery on Earth of the wonderful power that had been\nthe means of bringing us into such close visual contact with you. When\nyou discovered radium, we realized that this would eventually lead to\nthe discovery of the higher power, but we feared that this might not be\nfor hundreds of years.\n\n\"That communication was possible through the medium of radium and\nelectricity, we were totally ignorant of. It was the responsive\nproperties of radium in your instrument, however, that first attracted\nmy attention while searching over Paris for an object I had previously\nbeen observing. Thereafter my interest in your progress was as great as\nyour own, and every twenty-four hours, when the eastern hemisphere of\nEarth was turned toward Mars, I searched with the radioscope until I got\nthe response of your instrument.\n\n\"I have kept my success in communicating with Earth a secret, as it\ninvolves an invention of mine which I have not yet made public, and of\nwhich I will now tell you. This invention is the radiphone, through\nwhich we are now conversing, and to which the diaphragm of your\ninstrument responds, as it doubtless contains radium also. My entire\nlife has been devoted to the development of Martian-Earthly\ncommunication, and this instrument has been the goal which I have\nstriven to reach since boyhood, and yet its success in communicating\nwith Earth came as a great surprise to me.\"\n\nSo accustomed was I to hear the Martian speak of the most miraculous\noccurrences in an ordinary conversational tone, that the idea of there\nstill remaining something on Mars to be discovered appeared a still\ngreater wonder.\n\n\"We have made a most important discovery,\" pursued Almos. \"I say 'we,'\nas without the response of your instrument the action of a super-radium\ncurrent on sound-waves would not have been discovered.\"\n\n\"I feel that I can hardly share in the honors,\" I protested modestly.\n\"Without the super-radium current from Mars, I would still be\nexperimenting with the hope of finding a substitute for glass.\"\n\nI now entered into a full account of the experiments I had conducted,\ndescribing how, quite accidentally, I had made a substance responsive to\nthe waves from Mars. He was greatly amused upon hearing of my\nastonishment at finding that Martians resembled the people on Earth; and\nwhen I drew for him a verbal picture of the ferocious creatures the\ninhabitants of Mars were supposed to be, he laughed aloud.\n\n\"We never suspected that the people of Earth did us such a great\ninjustice,\" he said, his whole countenance lighting up with good humor.\n\"I have several volumes here giving accounts of observations of Earth,\nsome of them written eight hundred years ago. It would perhaps interest\nyou to hear what the Martian conception of the inhabitants of Earth was\nat that time.\"\n\n\"Indeed it would,\" I exclaimed, with rising curiosity.\n\n\"Well then,\" rejoined Almos, bringing one of the books and turning over\nthe leaves, while a curious smile still played about his mouth, \"you\nmust understand that this was written over a hundred years before\nsuper-radium was discovered, and at that time we had no means of\nobserving Earth except through the telescope, which showed us the\nmountains, seas, and continents, much the same as your telescope must\nreveal the physical features of Mars. On the question of whether Earth\nis inhabited the author says:\n\n\"'That this planet is inhabited we have no reason to doubt, as it is\nknown to be enveloped in an atmosphere, and it is now a generally\naccepted theory that the changes noticed in its color throughout the\nyear are the seasonal effects on vegetable matter existing on its\nsurface.... What the inhabitants are like, however, we can only\nsurmise, but a study of the conditions under which they live will help\nus to picture the wild amphibious creatures they must be. Their planet,\nmore than half covered with water, and being so many millions of miles\nnearer the sun than we are, is almost continually enveloped in heavy\nclouds of vapor, which, unless they were half fish, must surely\nsuffocate them. They doubtless seek the depths of water when these\nclouds of thick vapor arise. Upon emerging, however, they have to face\nsuch intense heat as none of us could tolerate a minute and live....\nThey are no doubt provided with steel-like skin to resist this\ntemperature.... That they are of a fierce temperament there can be\nlittle doubt, as their atmosphere, which is twice the weight of ours, is\nso overcharged with electricity, owing to the heat and clouds of vapor,\nthat violent storms are constantly breaking over them, doubtless killing\nthousands of them at a time and tending to make the natures of the\nsurvivors as fierce as the elements which surround them.... Their year\nis but half as long as ours, and this--impeding the laws of propagation,\nthus making impossible the higher order of mankind--would naturally\nhave the effect of rendering their lives a short, reckless, and\nferocious existence, full of unrestrained cruelty and passions....'\n\n\"And now,\" continued Almos, with a smile, after closing the volume, \"you\nsee there is no occasion for apologies from you.\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered, somewhat dryly.\n\n\"The fact is, my dear fellow,\" said Almos, laughing and seeming to enjoy\nthe situation immensely, \"the entire solar system is pursuing the same\npath; what A thinks of B, B has already thought of A.\"\n\nThe failing light on my instrument at this moment gave warning of the\npassing of Mars out of wave contact, and we were obliged to bid each\nother good-bye, Almos promising important revelations on the morrow.\n\nAs I stood for a moment before my instrument, now wrapped in darkness, I\nwas conscious of a strange feeling that, in bidding Almos adieu, I had\nalso parted from another inhabitant of Mars. Though well aware that I\nhad only seen and conversed with Almos, my mind, nevertheless, also\nreproduced the likeness of a young girl, wonderfully beautiful. I had\nfirst experienced this mental image immediately after my first\nconversation with Almos. At that time I had tried hard to put it from me\nas merely a delusion resulting from nervous tension. But I found that\nafter each interview with Almos, the image became clearer and more\ndefinitely fixed in my mind, until now I firmly believed in the\nexistence of this beautiful being on Mars, and, remarkable though it\nseemed, I could not deny my growing affection for her. I had not\nmentioned this mental image to Almos, as I felt convinced that he knew\nnothing of it, and therefore would be unable to help me in any way.\nMoreover, my training had taught me to seek a scientific reason for\nthings which might appeal to the superstitious as weird and uncanny. I\nwas therefore loath to speak of it to Almos, until I had proved beyond\ndoubt that it was not an hallucination.\n\nAfter I had spent many hours in vainly seeking a possible cause for this\nmysterious mental image, the realization that I was but the veriest\ninfant in the wonderful achievements of our sister planet, finally\ndecided me upon the wiser course of leaving such matters until I had\nbecome better acquainted with Martian inventions and scientific\nprogress. I therefore looked forward to visiting this wonderful world\nwith the greatest anticipation, and though I was entirely ignorant of\nhow this stupendous and seemingly impossible feat should be\naccomplished, such was my faith in Almos' superior knowledge of science,\nthat I did not, for a moment, doubt the possibility of such a thing.\nLittle did I realize the fearful nature of the journey--the success of\nwhich was based entirely on theories--or I would have shrunk in horror\nfrom such an undertaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE HAZARDOUS UNDERTAKING.\n\n\nThe greater part of the next day was spent in moving the rest of my\nbelongings to my new quarters and in settling down there. Indeed, so\noccupied was I with this task, that the approach of darkness found me\nquite unprepared for wave contact with Mars. I had been obliged to take\nmy instrument apart in order to allow the larger pieces of furniture to\nbe brought into the room, and it required almost two hours to put it\ntogether again.\n\nWhen at last all was in readiness and I had turned on the current, I\nfound my Martian friend waiting for me.\n\n\"This is to be the last of my narrative,\" he remarked, after we had\ngreeted each other.\n\n\"What!\" I ejaculated in amazement.\n\n\"You see, my dear fellow,\" continued Almos, \"it was necessary for you\nto become gradually acquainted with the advanced contions on Mars,\nproperly to understand them, and I have tried to school your mind\naccordingly. It is essential, however, for you to see these things,\nfully to appreciate the advancement of almost twenty centuries, and only\nthus can my highest ambition be realized.\"\n\n\"How is it possible?\"\n\n\"When I have told you of several important ways in which life on Mars\ndiffers from that on Earth, you will more readily understand.\n\n\"I have said that unhappiness on Mars is almost unknown. It is only the\npresence of ill health that causes unhappiness. If the body can be kept\nin a condition of absolutely perfect health--and by that I mean\nsomething far beyond what is considered perfect health on Earth--then\nunhappiness is impossible. Its causes, sorrow, jealousy, envy, hatred,\nand discontent, are eliminated, and a normal condition of perfect\nimmunity from wrong-doing and unhappiness exists.\n\n\"It has been discovered on Earth that crime is the result of a diseased\nbrain, and with us this discovery, in time, developed the fact that\nwrong-doing, even in its minor phases, is the result of physical ill\nhealth. Maintain, then, a perfect state of bodily health in a community,\nand there is no wrong-doing and consequent unhappiness.\n\n\"The means of obtaining this bodily health was discovered on Mars, in\nthe form of invisible light rays, almost six hundred years ago, and its\ndiscovery led to a complete transformation in social conditions,\nestablishing perfect tranquillity and happiness upon the entire globe.\n\n\"Separate governments became intolerable and were abandoned when race\ndistinction was forgotten, and the people of Mars became as one family,\nspeaking one tongue. Friendship for one's neighbor was transmuted into\nlove for one's brother. The pursuit of personal gain was replaced by a\ndesire to work for the good of all, and now a keen individual sense of\nright and duty actuates the entire population, and is paramount in all\nthings. Duties are performed without other compensation than that which\nthe fulfillment of something well done brings.\n\n\"It was soon found that the remarkable regenerating properties of these\nrays perpetuated life and youth. Not only did they prevent sickness of\nany kind, but they rebuilt the tissues of the body as fast as they wore\nout, thus making the aging of the body impossible. A child therefore\ngrows up to full manhood or womanhood and remains in that state of the\nbody's highest excellence. While the child is developing the rays\nstimulate his progress; anything beyond that would be decaying, a\ncondition the rays prevent.\"\n\nAccustomed though I had become to a long recital of the most marvelous\naccounts without interrupting, I could not suppress an exclamation of\nastonishment at the information that Martians enjoy everlasting life.\n\nAlmos received my evident amazement with the quiet smile I had grown\naccustomed to observe upon such occasions, and, with a view of\nillustrating the point further, said:\n\n\"Although one's actual age becomes a very unimportant matter when,\ninstead of being limited to sixty or seventy years, it extends over\nhundreds of years, I can readily ascertain my age, from the fact that I\nwas twenty years old at the time these wonderful rays were discovered. I\nhave lived, then, about six hundred of Earth's years, or three hundred\nMartian years.\"\n\n\"Six hundred years!\" I exclaimed, as I looked at the reflection of his\nhandsome face; his eyes flashing, his cheeks aglow with ruddy health,\nhis whole countenance animated with the full vigor of manhood.\n\n\"Of course, we do not know how long the effects of regenerating rays\nwill make it possible to live,\" pursued Almos, \"but in theory, it would\nseem that by their daily use perfect health will be assured, and life\nitself will continue indefinitely.\"\n\n\"And death become unknown on Mars!\" I added, enthusiastically.\n\n\"Not quite unknown,\" rejoined Almos. \"For lives are sometimes lost in\naccidents. Instant death defies all our science, and will not be\nconquered. But in accidents, no matter how serious, where a spark of\nlife remains, we can prevent that from escaping until the body is in a\ncondition to take care of it.\n\n\"This is accomplished by a device known as a virator, which, though\nsimple in construction, is the greatest marvel of the age. It consists\nof a dome, made of material similar to glass in appearance, but which\ndiffers from anything else known, in that it is absolutely atomless.\nThis dome fits over the operating table, upon which the patient lies,\nwith just sufficient room for two persons inside, and is kept at the\ntemperature of the body. On its top is a small globe made of the same\nmaterial, measuring but a few inches in diameter, which is connected\nwith the large chamber below by a neck or passage about an inch wide.\nThe patient is placed inside, and there operated upon. If life leaves\nthe body, either during the operation or after, the spirit ascends\nthrough the narrow passage into the small globe above and is there\nretained, as it cannot pass through the material of which the walls of\nthis chamber are constructed. The body is then kept continually bathed\nin the regenerating rays, which not only preserve it as if life were in\nit, but actually carry on the process of healing. This continues until\nthe body is in a perfectly sound and healthy condition again, and well\nable to retain life.\n\n\"And now occurs the most wonderful of all. When everything is in\nreadiness for the spirit to enter the body again, a strong flow of\nsuper-radium is sent through the top globe from an instrument attached.\nPassing through the small chamber and down the narrow passage, it\nreaches the body, and immediately changes to a return flow. This current\nis but momentary; the patient is seen to move, and the body is once more\nquickened by the life spark. The flow of super-radium has conveyed the\nspirit of the patient from the small chamber above and released it in\nthe body as it returned, in exactly the same manner as it does with\nlight-waves or sound-waves.\"\n\n\"Marvelous!\" I gasped, though my mind could only slowly comprehend this\nalmost miraculous achievement. With such vast scientific resources\nnothing seemed impossible to Martians.\n\nAlmos had stopped abruptly. A change came over him. His face paled and\nhis lips set in a hard, determined expression. Instantly I felt my every\nfaculty strain to the utmost, in response to the new character of this\nremarkable being.\n\nSpeaking slowly and deliberately, his keen eyes holding mine fascinated\nby a strange fire that seemed kindled within them, he said:\n\n\"A few words more and we have reached that point at which death may\nawait the inhabitant of Earth who would proceed farther. A death that no\nscientific knowledge can avert. I have tried to school your mind, to the\nend that you may fully understand the nature of a desperate undertaking,\nnever before attempted by any human being, which, if you wish to\nattempt, you must risk alone.\n\n\"Impelled by a motive that I cannot now explain, I have spanned the\nmillions of miles of universe lying between us by a bridge of theories,\nwhich, should they prove realities, would enable you to see and live in\nanother world. Should they prove untenable, however, no power on Earth\nor Mars can save you; in five hours all would be over. You must consider\nthe possible consequences ere it be too late.\"\n\n\"Never!\" I cried. \"My dear Almos, I am too vitally interested; I have\nproceeded too far now to hesitate at any step toward such a goal.\nExplain your theories to me, and I will test them, even if it costs me\nmy life, for Mars holds that which is dearer to me than life on Earth\never can be.\"\n\n\"Well, my brave fellow,\" said Almos, his voice softening, \"you must\nfollow me closely in all I tell you, and remember every word I say, for\nto-morrow I can be of no assistance to you. Alone you must undertake the\njourney.\"\n\nI was glad Almos had not questioned me regarding the import of what I\nhad said in the enthusiasm of the moment, for I could not help feeling\nnow that I had acted unjustly in not confiding in him, at once, the\nfacts regarding the mental image of the beautiful young girl whom I\nfully believed existed on Mars, and whose destiny, I was certain, was\ninextricably bound with mine. I now decided to do so on the first\nopportunity.\n\n\"I have explained to you how the spirit may be retained in the upper\nchamber of a virator after it has left the body,\" pursued Almos, \"and as\nit is this apparatus we shall employ, I have but to describe the\nadditions I have made to it to meet our requirements, and also my\ntheories in connection with them.\n\n\"To the lower chamber or dome of a virator I have connected the\nreceiving apparatus of a radioscope, first removing the image surface.\nThis can be disconnected easily, and the projecting apparatus\nsubstituted, from which I have also removed the image surface. Thus we\nmay have a free current of super-radium flowing from the radioscope to\nEarth and returning into the virator, and by substituting the projecting\napparatus, we have a current flowing from the virator to Earth and\nreturning into the receiving apparatus.\n\n\"This is exactly the condition that exists in a virator in ordinary use\nwith these exceptions: the current of super-radium is made to flow\neither in or out of the bottom chamber, as well as the top; instead of\nbeing local, the current is between Earth and Mars, and consequently\nmuch more powerful. The currents from both the top and bottom chambers\nare controlled by clockwork which I have devised for that purpose, and\nin place of an operating table in the virator I have substituted a\ncouch.\n\n\"And now I enjoin you to summon all your courage, for in this\nundertaking nothing but nerves of steel will carry you safely through.\"\n\n\"I shall faithfully carry out your instructions, Almos,\" I responded,\ntrying to appear perfectly calm, though my being fifteen hundred years\nbehind Martian times never seemed so much a handicap as now.\n\n\"Follow me, then, word for word,\" resumed Almos. \"Understand all I say,\nfor in the error of a second, the misconception of a word, the hesitancy\nof a moment, there is death!\n\n\"To-morrow, when that part of the Earth's surface on which Paris is\nsituated appears, I shall attach the receiving apparatus of the\nradioscope to the lower chamber of the virator, so that the return\ncurrent from Earth will flow into it. I shall then set the clockwork to\nturn on the current of super-radium in half an hour. In that time my\nbody must be in a condition to receive your spirit.\"\n\nI could not suppress a shudder upon hearing this, but I deemed it best\nnot to interrupt Almos.\n\n\"Filling a cone with the required amount of chloroform, I shall enter\nthe virator, and, reclining upon the couch, place the cone over my mouth\nand nose. In a few minutes my spirit will have passed into the upper\nchamber.\n\n\"By experimenting, I have found that regenerating rays are contained in\nsuper-radium. In fact, my theory is that the regenerating rays and the\ninvisible rays of super-radium are synonymous. Such being the case, when\nthe current of super-radium is turned on by the clockwork, it will flow\nto Earth and, returning, enter the virator and restore my body to a\nnormal condition, freeing it from the fumes of chloroform and making it\ncapable of receiving its new life.\n\n\"The glow of your instrument, in response to the super-radium current,\nwill warn you that this has taken place, and you must then prepare\nyourself for departure. You will not observe any image, owing to my\nhaving removed the lenses of the radioscope, but your instrument will\nglow in response to the current.\n\n\"Having prepared a cone of chloroform, you must move a couch directly in\nfront of your instrument, so that upon lying down your body will obscure\nthe rays from it. You will thus know that you are in the path of the\nsuper-radium current; this is of the greatest importance as, otherwise,\nyour spirit would undoubtedly escape upon leaving the body and be lost\nforever.\n\n\"After taking every possible precaution to safeguard against any\nmovement of the body, place the cone securely over your mouth and nose.\nWithin a short time your spirit will leave the body and will instantly\nbe caught up by the super-radium current, on its return flow to Mars.\nEntering the receiving apparatus and thus passing into the virator, the\nflow will come into direct contact with my body, into which it will\ndischarge your spirit.\"\n\nAlmos stopped abruptly, consternation written on his face. A moment\nlater, I realized the cause--the two planets were passing out of wave\ncontact. At such a critical moment nothing could be more unfortunate,\nand I was about hastily to suggest a postponement, when Almos exclaimed:\n\"It is all right!--I shall leave----\"\n\nWave contact ceased before he had time to finish the sentence, and I was\nleft standing before the instrument in a state of irresolution.\n\nHow could I arrive on Mars totally unprepared to meet the conditions?\nUpon my regaining consciousness these might present themselves in the\nmost urgent form, demanding immediate attention and a thorough knowledge\nof Martian sciences. Almos' life, indeed, might depend upon just such a\ncondition.\n\nUndetermined upon the course I should pursue the next day, my mind\nfilled with the most formidable fancies of so strange an undertaking, I\nat last sought repose, hoping that with the morrow would come clearer\nthought.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\"AS OTHERS SEE US.\"\n\n\nThe next morning found me resolved to make the journey to Mars at any\ncost. That Almos had intended to say he would leave further\ninstructions, I had no doubt. The instructions would probably be\nwritten, and placed where I would immediately see them upon regaining\nconsciousness. In any event, I argued, if, at the usual hour of Martian\ncontact, my instrument should glow in response to super-radium, it would\nclearly be my duty to fulfil my part of the agreement, for the glow\nwould be proof that Almos had fulfilled his and that his spirit had\npassed into the upper chamber of the virator.\n\nI had purchased the necessary articles for my remarkable journey, and\nhad taken the precaution to fasten a notice outside my door to the\neffect that I would be out during the evening. I could not restrain a\ngrim smile at the thought of the uncanny literal truth in this\nannouncement.\n\nThese things done I fell to speculating upon what would be my experience\non Mars if, indeed, I ever reached that planet. For the first hours, try\nas I would to check it, there was, at times, a doubt as to the outcome\nof this wild soul-adventure. But, strange as it may appear, although I\nfully realized the danger attending such an undertaking, the success of\nwhich was based entirely on theories, it did not, in any way, act as a\ndeterrent. So great was the prize to be attained, that the risk of life\nseemed unimportant. Indeed, the first step of the journey to Mars was to\ntake my life, as we understand the term on Earth, and, having become\nreconciled to this, I was not sensible of any danger beyond. So absorbed\nwas I in these thoughts, that the time passed without my realizing it,\nand only the fading daylight warned me of the near approach of the hour\nof Martian contact.\n\nI now made a complete examination of all the batteries and coils of my\ninstrument, as failure in any of these might result most seriously.\nFinding all to be in perfect working order, I next proceeded to arrange\nmy couch so as to bring it directly between the instrument and the\nwindow. Having thus completed my preparations, possessed by conflicting\nemotions, I now waited for the appearance of Mars.\n\nEarly in the day I had arranged my letters and private papers so that in\nthe event of the worst happening, they could be readily packed, and it\nnow occurred to me that it would be only proper to leave a word of\nexplanation with them. I therefore hastily penned a note to a cousin\nliving in England--my nearest relative--briefly explaining my discovery\nof the Martian super-radium current, and also the character of the\nadventure in which I was about to participate. This note I placed with\nmy papers.\n\nReturning to the instrument, I discovered that Mars was already visible.\nQuickly turning on the current and finding no responsive glow, I knew\nthat Almos was already making the preparations he had described to me.\nHe had said that within half an hour the clockwork would turn on the\ncurrent, and the glow of my instrument would be the signal for my\ndeparture.\n\nNo time was to be lost. Securely fastening the door of my room, I\nprepared the cone of chloroform and extinguished the light, in order not\nto excite the suspicion of a chance caller during the evening.\n\nI now sat on the couch awaiting with anxiety the current of super-radium\nthat would convey me to the far world of my dreams. Minutes seemed like\nhours, as I sat in the darkness, with every nerve strained to its\nuttermost, awaiting Death. What if Death should refuse to release me!\nMillions have been wrapped in Death's cold arms, but no mortal has\nreturned to give accounting.\n\nWhat was that!--A blinding flash made me instantly shield my eyes. Ah!\nThe glow at last! But such was its dazzling brilliancy that I could not\nstand the glare. I had been accustomed to see the glow gradually creep\nup the surface of the instrument, slowly growing brighter as the rim of\nthe star appeared above the window casement, but this time Mars had\nrisen to full view before the current was turned on by the clockwork.\nThis was ample proof that everything had happened as Almos had planned.\nIt was now my turn to act and I must not hesitate. Stretching myself on\nthe couch so that I came into full contact with the current of\nsuper-radium, I seized the cone saturated with chloroform, and fastened\nit securely over my mouth and nose.\n\nA few moments of a slightly suffocating sensation, then a long, long\nfall, gradual at first, then quicker, quicker--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a feeling of exhilaration, such as I had never before experienced,\nI opened my eyes and sprang to my feet. My brain was perfectly clear,\nand so active that my mind utterly failed to keep pace with the\nmultitude of thoughts that were crowded upon it--thoughts that were\nstrange to my mind, yet perfectly familiar to my brain, if this\nparadoxical statement may stand. It seemed as if my mind stood, apart\nand marveled at the remarkable activity and knowledge possessed by the\nbrain--of which knowledge my mind was entirely ignorant.\n\nI was in another world, millions of miles away from Earth. My mind\nrealized that something little short of a miracle had happened, and yet\nI felt absolutely familiar with all the objects about me. The glass-like\nwalls that surrounded me, reaching up and forming a dome several feet\nabove my head; the narrow passage in the center of the dome (just as the\nneck of a bottle would appear if viewed from inside), through which the\nspirit of Almos had passed to the chamber above; all these were\nwonderfully familiar to me.\n\nI was in the virator, but it was uncomfortable to remain inside, as the\nair was oppressively warm. Moreover, dictated my brain, I must prepare\nthe virator for my return within five hours, and my hand instinctively\ngrasped a lever in the wall of the apparatus. A door opened and I\nstepped out, carefully closing it behind me. Again I was astonished at\nmy wonderful familiarity with everything. If I had lived on Mars all my\nlife, I could not have had a more intimate knowledge of my surroundings.\nI seemed to know exactly how to proceed, and after attending to several\nimportant details, and carefully noting the temperature of the virator\non a thermometer placed for that purpose, I consulted a chronometer to\nascertain how long it would be safe for me to remain on Mars. I found\nthat, allowing a half-hour for the process of arrival and the same for\ndeparture, I had just five hours.\n\nMy mind, at first stunned by the new and strange conditions to which it\nwas subjected, now gradually began to realize its remarkable position in\nrelation to the brain.\n\nThat the mind and the spirit are one, or so closely related as to be\nindistinguishable and inseparable, was now beyond doubt, as I was keenly\naware of all that had happened to me on Earth, showing that my mind not\nonly existed, but also possessed the same faculty of thought in Almos'\nbody as it did in mine while on Earth. Here was a positive proof, in\nfact a demonstration, of the theory advanced by some scientists, that\nthe mind is separate and distinct from the brain.\n\nBut the gulf that lies between life and death remained as wide as ever.\nDeath was still shrouded in mystery, for my mind knew nothing from the\nmoment it left the body on Earth, until it awakened in the body on Mars.\nFlesh and blood, then, were essential to the mind's existence. Mind or\nspirit must have expression through some form. Although man may achieve\nmuch by scientific advancement, that to which he has progressed is but\nas a grain of sand in the desert, to the wonders that surround him.\nScience shall never penetrate the mystery of those things that are\nwithheld from him.\n\nThe brain of which my mind now took control, acted merely as the\nmaterial handle by which the machinery of the body was operated, thus\nconverting thoughts into actions. But although my mind, having by now\nbecome perfectly familiar with the strange conditions, was able to\nrecord new impressions on the brain, there still existed the impression\nof Almos' thoughts. It resembled a book which my mind could instantly\nrefer to and be guided by, and thus was I in possession of a perfect\nknowledge of Mars, its people, and its language.\n\nI now realized that my first actions, upon becoming conscious, had\nsimply been carrying out the instructions Almos had left for me. Strange\nto the conditions in those first few minutes, I had instinctively done\nwhat the brain dictated. In this remarkable way had Almos completed the\ninstructions he was about to give me when interrupted by the cessation\nof wave contact.\n\nHaving thus arrived at what I felt to be the true relation of my mind\nwith Almos' body, I now turned my attention to the objects surrounding\nme.\n\nI stood in a room about the size of my laboratory on Earth. There were\nno windows to admit light, but the ceiling, which was fully twenty feet\nhigh, emitted a beautifully diffused white light, which filled every\ncorner of the room, leaving absolutely no shadows. Its effect was that\nof daylight, and so closely did it resemble the sky, that, had I not\nbeen supplied with Almos' knowledge of Martian science, I would have\nnaturally supposed that there was no ceiling to the room. Immediately\nupon the question coming into my mind, however, I became aware that the\nceiling was coated with a composition, one of the component parts of\nwhich was radium in a highly developed state. Its action upon the other\nelements that composed this substance resulted in a perpetual light\nwithout heat, which was equal in every way to daylight.\n\nThe tourist, finding himself in a new country, has but one thought, one\nambition, that of seeing all he can; yet, strange to say, although a\nwhole new world lay before me, my first thought was of Mother Earth. A\ndesire to view my old habitat as Martians see it seemed almost\nirresistible.\n\nTo touch the radioscope that was trained on Earth, would result in an\ninstant change taking place in my body as it lay in the laboratory, and\nthis would be disastrous. It was only the regenerating properties of the\nsuper-radium current that kept it in a state acceptable to my return,\nand the delicate mechanism of this instrument was regulated so as to\nkeep the current exactly in position, as long as that part of the\nEarth's surface was exposed to Mars. To interfere then with this\ncurrent, for a moment, would mean certain death.\n\nImmediately I became conscious of the presence of another instrument,\nwhich was in a room adjoining, and, feeling absolutely familiar with\nevery inch of the way, I proceeded thence. The room was a small one,\njust large enough, indeed, to operate the radioscope, which was exactly\nthe same as the one in the room I had just quitted.\n\nWith a perfect knowledge of the mechanism of the instrument, I was soon\nat work adjusting the projecting and receiving apparatus. An ordinary\ntelescope was attached to the huge tube of the radioscope, and with\nAlmos' dexterity I soon located Earth through it, thus sighting the\nradioscope for that planet.\n\nI had now but to turn on the current to see the people on Earth and\nwatch their doings, as had done Martians for hundreds of years, but,\nwith my hand on the lever that controlled the current, I paused.\n\nThe sight of Earth, as it appeared through the telescope, was too\nbeautiful to pass by with a mere glance. Half illuminated, owing to the\ngreater distance of Mars from the sun and the position of the planets at\nthat time, Earth appeared about the size the moon looks to the naked\neye. But what a wonderful sight! Bathed in sunlight lay the eastern half\nof the continents of North and South America, faintly outlined by the\npale blue of the western portion of the Atlantic Ocean. So familiar was\nI with the appearance of these two great continents as drawn in an\natlas, that I had difficulty in recognizing them as they now appeared.\nMexico and Central America seemed almost as broad as that part of the\nUnited States from San Francisco to Washington; the whole tapering down\nfrom Canada to Cape Horn almost in the shape of a cone.\n\nAeronauts passing over a lake or river are able to see the bottom, owing\nto their altitude; this was undoubtedly the explanation of the strange\nappearance of the continents of North and South America. On account of\nthe enormous distance I was away from Earth, the shallow waters appeared\nas land, obliterating completely the familiar coast line, and only the\nextreme depth of an ocean showed a pale blue.\n\nNight covered Europe and Africa, which would otherwise have been visible\nto me, and the shadow of darkness was steadily creeping across the\nAtlantic Ocean, as the Earth revolved upon its axis. I could not\nsuppress a shudder at the thought that I must cover that enormous\ndistance ere it revolved too far.\n\nI now moved the lever that controlled the current, and at once the lens\nin the receiving apparatus shone with a brilliant dark blue color. The\ncurrent of super-radium had reached Earth and returned in less than a\nsecond, and I saw, beautifully pictured before me, an expanse of ocean\nwith waves tumbling and tossing so near me that it seemed as if I were\nbut a few feet above them.\n\nBy diminishing the current I found that the image on the lens grew\nsmaller, the effect being exactly the same as that from a balloon\nrising. The picture at first appeared slanting at an angle of about\nthirty degrees, owing to the curvature of the Earth, but by manipulating\na small lever close at hand that operated a mirror in the radioscope,\nthis defect was corrected.\n\nAfter searching about with the current, I at last came upon a large\nsteamer, evidently an ocean liner. Throwing huge billows aside in clouds\nof white spray as she cut through the water, she made a beautiful sight,\nand it was with difficulty that I kept her in the field of vision. As I\nappeared to be looking straight down upon her decks, it was evident that\nshe was about in the center of the Earth's surface exposed to Mars.\n\nI now moved the current in a westerly direction, travelling at what\nwould be a terrific speed on Earth, until I came to land. Not\nrecognizing the small coast town that first came in view, I moved up the\ncoast in a northerly direction, diminishing the current until I could\nsee a large stretch of country. Toward the northwest a large city\nappeared, which I immediately recognized as Washington. Directing the\ninstrument to that city, I increased the current until the people on the\nstreets measured two or three feet on the lens of my instrument. Here I\nfound that the curvature of the Earth resulted in my looking down\nobliquely at the objects on its surface, but not at a sufficient angle\nto see the faces of those who passed across my lens.\n\nBut now I became aware of a strange condition that, owing to the motion\nof the liner at sea, had escaped my notice before. Although I was\nlooking at the people passing before one of the large government\nbuildings in Washington, I had to keep regulating the instrument in\norder to keep this building in view. Moreover, I discovered that I had\nto regulate it as fast as I had done with the ocean liner. In fact,\nobviously the liner's speed mattered but little; it was the rate at\nwhich the Earth was revolving upon its axis and journeying around the\nsun with which I had to contend. Through the telescope this was not\ndiscernible, but now that I had come into such close visual contact with\nthe Earth's surface, I realized the terrific speed with which it rushed\nthrough space. Hundreds of miles a minute was the speed my instrument\nhad to be regulated to, in order to keep an object on Earth in view--the\nmotion of the liner was insignificant!\n\nMoving the current eastward over the Atlantic Ocean, I discovered that\ndarkness in no way hindered my view of objects on Earth's surface. The\nreproduction on the lens, however, presented quite a different\nappearance to that which I had witnessed while observing the part of\nEarth illuminated by the sun. The beautiful colors which contributed so\nmuch realism to the picture were now replaced by a sombre gray tone,\ngreatly resembling a photograph in appearance.\n\nSo absorbed had I become in all that this wonderful instrument revealed\nto me of the different phases of life on Earth, that I forgot all else,\nuntil, with a start, I realized that someone was moving about in the\nlarge room which contained the virator that I had recently left. I was\nfilled with apprehension. Who could it be? And what was the reason of\nthis unexpected visit? Almos had not warned me against intrusion of any\nkind, and I felt that to meet and converse with a Martian, thus\nunprepared, would be impossible. In that room, however, were the\ninstruments that held two lives within their delicate mechanism, and\neven now they might have been tampered with enough to cause the most\nserious consequences. I must not hesitate a moment longer. Hastening\ndown the passage that led to the larger room, I pushed aside the heavy\nportieres and found myself in the presence of a Martian.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE MELODY OF FLOWERS AND ZARLAH.\n\n\nMy visitor appeared to be a young man of about twenty-five, tall,\nhandsome, broad-shouldered, and fair-complexioned, with that frank and\nopen countenance which claims the friendship of all men. Without a\nmoment's hesitation he stepped forward with outstretched hand and, in\nthe composite language of Mars, said:\n\n\"Good-evening, Almos. I am afraid this is an intrusion. I have\ninterrupted your studies, I know, but the fact is--\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear Reon!\" I found myself replying. \"I am glad to see\nyou at any time, and now, how can I be of service to you?\"\n\nAlthough I answered him in the composite language, and in a manner that\ndid not excite the slightest suspicion, I did so unconsciously. In\nspite of the quandary in which I found myself upon coming face to face\nwith an inhabitant of Mars, I outwardly remained perfectly calm, nor did\nit require any effort to appear so. The brain, in such an emergency,\nfollowed instinctively its natural habit. It was as if another man had\nspoken from within me, one who was perfectly acquainted with the visitor\nand with Martian affairs. I found, however, when the surprise of the\nfirst few moments had passed, that my mind could take control whenever\nit exerted itself to do so. Thus I was able to say whatever I wished,\nor, if necessity demanded, draw upon Almos' knowledge for information.\nReplies came with the ease that Almos himself would have experienced in\nanswering questions, and I soon found that, with discretion, there was\nno danger of my visitor suspecting the remarkable change of personality\nin his friend.\n\nI learned that Reon had come with a message from Sarraccus, one of Mars'\ngreatest scientists, who was about to give a demonstration of his latest\ninvention, a remarkable musical instrument called the lumaharp. A\nrecognized authority on anything of a scientific nature, Almos' counsel\nwas sought, and it was desired that he should be present at the recital\nof this wonderful instrument.\n\nHastily ascertaining the time, I found that I had only two hours in\nwhich it would be safe to remain on Mars. So interested had I been in my\nobservations of Earth, that the time had passed without my being aware\nof the narrow margin I had left myself in which to see the planet. I,\nhowever, informed my visitor that I would be ready to accompany him in a\nfew minutes, and with all haste, prepared myself for this new\nundertaking.\n\nI realized that once having left the observatory and stepped into a new\nand strange world, many things might happen to prevent me returning\nwithin two hours. But besides feeling that I was in duty bound to Almos\nto attend this demonstration, I also felt that the risks I had taken\nwere too great to go unrewarded by even a glimpse into the life of this\nwonderful planet. The future, too, held that element of uncertainty\nwhich made me feel that I might pay dearly for the five hours spent in\nanother world. If the return current failed to do what was expected of\nit, if I had erred in my calculation of the time I could remain on\nMars, or if my room had been broken into and my body moved, the results\nwould be disastrous.\n\nI must attend this demonstration at any cost, but I would explain to my\nhost that it was most urgently necessary to return to the observatory\nwithin two hours. I was now ready for the strange journey, and,\napproaching my visitor, I said:\n\n\"And now, Reon, I will accompany you, but there is no time to be lost,\nas an experiment I am conducting with one of these instruments demands\nmy attention in two hours.\"\n\nI held back the porti\u00e8res as Reon passed out, and following him down a\nshort passage, we stepped out upon a wide balcony constructed of white\nmarble.\n\nA wonderful sight met my astonished gaze. It was a summer evening, and\nthe dome of the heavens seemed ablaze with the light of myriads of\ndiamonds, so countless were the stars to be seen and so brilliant did\nthey appear in this rarefied atmosphere. Below me stretched out what\nappeared to be a magnificent park, with white marble buildings scattered\nhere and there, while floating easily in the air were hundreds of small\ncanoe-like airships, containing the inhabitants of this fairyland,\nreclining on cushions and enjoying sailing through the cool night air.\nAs the question of buoyancy of these remarkable airships arose in my\nmind, I immediately became aware that they were sustained, in the air by\na metal which was used in their construction that was repellent to the\nsurface of Mars. It had been discovered by the Martians that their\nplanet, like a magnet, had both the power of attracting and repelling.\nThe north and south poles were found to be the repelling poles of this\nimmense magnetic sphere. Nothing could exist on these poles that was not\na fixture to the planet's surface, consequently no snow or ice existed\nat the poles themselves. Many explorers' lives had been lost before this\ndiscovery was made; those who succeeded in reaching the pole having made\nthe discovery too late to save themselves from being hurled off the\nplanet into space. But so small was the surface of this repelling pole\nthat it was argued that the pole must run through the center of the\nplanet, to make it equal in mass to the attracting force which covered\nthe rest of the surface.\n\nWorking on this theory, although it was impossible to reach the pole\nitself without danger of being hurled off the planet, excavations were\nmade as near it as possible, and a tunnel was run under the surface\nuntil the desired point was reached. A change from rock to ore was\nencountered, with evidences of its having been subjected to intense\nheat, and upon penetrating farther, pure metal was discovered. This\nstrange metal, unlike any other metal known to the Martians, was found\nto possess a powerful repelling force. And when it was brought to the\nsurface, it was discovered that it not only retained its repelling\nforce, as a lodestone retains its attracting power, but that this same\nforce was greatly increased, doubtless owing to the close proximity of\nan unfriendly element in the surface of the planet away from the pole.\nThe repelling force of this metal was found to be ten times as great as\nthe specific gravity of a piece of iron of relative proportions, and by\nits use in the construction of airships, the problem of aerial\nnavigation on Mars had been solved.\n\nAlmos' knowledge of such matters made me instantly aware of all this the\nmoment the question of buoyancy presented itself in my mind, but,\nalthough I could not help marveling at the ingenuity of this wonderful\npeople, I outwardly preserved the calm demeanor which Almos' strong\npersonality had made a characteristic. Indeed, Reon, who had been\npreparing an aerenoid for our use--such was the Martian name for these\nairships--was quite unaware of my astonishment, and it was plain that\nwith the exercise of due care, when I spoke without the prompting of\nAlmos' knowledge, there was no likelihood of anyone's having a suspicion\nof my true personality.\n\nThe aerenoid in which we were going to make our journey differed in\nappearance considerably from those which I saw floating about us.\nCigar-shaped, with windows in its sides and roof like a steamer's\nportholes, it more nearly resembled a submarine boat than an airship, as\nit rested on a platform built in the side of the balcony for the\npurpose. Yet such was the repelling force of this wonderful metal which\nthe Martians had discovered, and which I found was attached in two or\nmore strips to the bottom of the aerenoids, that the matter of weight in\ntheir construction was of little importance. While resting on the\nground these strips were encased in a material that was a non-conductor,\nthus neutralizing the repelling force. In order to raise the car the\ncasing was merely drawn back by means of a controlling lever, until\nenough of the metal was exposed to the surface of Mars to cause the\nrepelling force to lift the aerenoid, and by preserving this exposure,\nany desired height could thus be attained.\n\nThe entire design of this aerenoid indicated that it was built to attain\ngreat speed, and yet as I stepped into it through a door that closed\nflush with the rounded sides, I was astonished at seeing no traces of\nmachinery. Instantly I became aware of the extraordinary means of\npropulsion, however, and so simple, yet so effective, was it, that I\ncould not restrain a cry of admiration at this new evidence of\nscientific progress.\n\nAtmospheric pressure, instead of retarding speed, was employed to\nproduce it. Under the floor of the car and occupying the entire rear\nhalf, was a chamber of steel, five or six feet broad at one end, and\ntapering down with the sides of the aerenoid until it reached the stern,\nwhere it ended in an opening one inch in diameter. By a chemical\nprocess the air in the chamber was exhausted, instantly causing a\nvacuum. Immediately the air outside the car rushed in through the small\nopening at the rear end, with such great force as to cause a concussion\nagainst the forward and broad end of the chamber, thus driving the\naerenoid ahead. So quick was this action that, when going at great\nspeed, more than one hundred exhaustions would occur in a minute. Simple\nthough this means of propulsion was, gravity having been overcome and\nthe long pointed body of the aerenoid offering little resistance, the\nspeed thus attained was remarkable.\n\nTaking his position at the forward end, where a window in the top of the\ncar afforded a view ahead, Reon now moved a lever at his side and we\nrose until clear of the observatory building. We then commenced to glide\nalong without either vibration or sound. Slowly we made our way through\nthe many small aerenoids that floated about us, and a soft light, coming\nfrom a canopy containing the substance used to illuminate the\nobservatory, clearly revealed the occupants to me, as we passed close\nby them. I now noticed that the women were wonderfully\nbeautiful--beauty that was possible only where sickness had been unknown\nfor hundreds of years.\n\nLeaving this happy gathering, we passed over what appeared to be a river\nabout a mile broad, whose banks rose perpendicularly a hundred feet or\nmore from the water. These were illuminated with lights, placed every\nhundred yards or so, giving it the appearance of a broad city street\nstretching as far as the eye could see. At once it occurred to me that\nthis was one of the wonderful canals, visible even from Earth, and as we\npassed over it I observed another canal, equal in proportions, running\nparallel. Although both were on level ground, their waters were flowing\nrapidly in different directions. What new wonder was this!\n\nInto this second canal our aerenoid now turned, sinking slowly until\nwithin thirty feet from the surface. Gradually our speed increased until\nthe lights along the banks formed one long unbroken line. One hundred\nmiles a minute we sped along, and yet without the least vibration or\nsound. At such a speed it was possible to encircle Mars in seventy\nminutes, almost, I thought, as rapidly as could Puck in \"Midsummer\nNight's Dream,\" who boasted of putting a girdle round the Earth in forty\nminutes.\n\nOn we flew down the walled-in track, passing numerous other canals\nequally as broad, flowing into it, until within ten minutes a faint gray\nlight appeared. It was daylight, and in a few moments sunlight crowned\nthe banks on either side of us. Even as I looked the sun itself\nappeared, and in the space of fifty seconds it was high in the heavens.\nIn fifteen minutes we had covered almost a quarter of the globe, and now\nit was the middle of the afternoon.\n\nThe importance of having speedways in which to confine aerenoids,\ntravelling at the terrific velocity of one hundred miles a minute, was\nobvious, and what could be better adapted to the purpose than these\nmagnificent waterways, which completely cover the surface of the planet\nwith such geometrical exactness, that they have always been a source of\ngreat wonder to astronomers on Earth. Thousands and thousands of years\nold, the method of constructing this gigantic system of canals remains\nenshrouded in the same mystery to the Martians, as that which surrounds\nthe building of the pyramids in Egypt.\n\nI was now made aware of another valuable use to which the canals were\nput, in fact a most important adjunct to the operation of an aerenoid.\nThe checking of such terrific speed would be impossible, were it not for\nthe water in these canals. We had covered several hundred miles without\npropulsion, and our speed had not decreased perceptibly, when, moving a\nlever at his side, Reon turned the aerenoid slightly downward. In an\ninstant we were plunging along the surface of the water, sending high\ninto the air great clouds of spray, which formed snow-white banks on\neither side of the wake, and made a most remarkable picture. I now\nrealized why this high-speed aerenoid resembled a submarine boat in\nappearance.\n\nGradually our speed was reduced until, moving at not more than a mile a\nminute, we gently left the surface of the water and proceeded down\nseveral branch canals. At last we slowly rose above the top of the canal\nbanks. Higher and higher we ascended until we were about a thousand\nfeet in the air, and then proceeded at a greatly reduced speed.\n\nA veritable fairyland lay beneath us. Stretching as far as the eye could\nreach lay a landscape of pink and green, dotted with white marble\nbuildings of magnificent architecture. Narrow paths, shaded by trees,\ncould be seen winding in and out over rustic bridges and beside\nsparkling brooks. But nowhere did there appear either cities or\ntowns--not even a road was there to indicate a volume of traffic in any\nparticular direction.\n\nNo small aerenoids were to be seen floating about, and as the air in our\ncar was now very close, I realized that in consequence of the light\natmosphere of Mars, the sun's direct rays gave great heat. It was\nevidently the custom for Martians to remain as much as possible under\ncover in the daytime.\n\nOpening the door of the aerenoid to obtain a fresh supply of air, I was\nat once struck with the remarkable appearance of the sky, which was\nintensely blue in color, but of such a dark shade as to appear almost\nblack. It presented all the appearance of night, so many stars were\nvisible and so brightly did they shine, while the sun blazed forth with\nsuch brilliancy from the surrounding blackness, that it was impossible\nto look westward without shading the eyes. I now appreciated the\nenormous advantage of having an atmosphere as dense as Earth's, which\ndiffused the light to a much more comfortable extent. But the appearance\nof the Martian sky was magnificent, and I stood lost in admiration\nuntil, with a hardly perceptible shock, I discovered that we had come to\nrest upon a ledge which projected from the circular balcony of a most\npalatial building.\n\nJumping out, I moored the aerenoid by means of ropes that were attached\nto the balcony for that purpose. I was aware that this was my duty upon\nlanding, and when I had made everything secure, Reon left his place at\nthe levers and joined me.\n\nThere were numerous other aerenoids moored to the balcony, some of the\nhigh-speed class similar to ours, and a few of the lighter class\nresembling rowboats. The balcony was entirely deserted, however, and it\nwas evident that all were inside listening to the recital of the\nlumaharp.\n\nAs we proceeded across the broad balcony, I was astonished to discover\nthat the outside walls of this building were entirely covered with\nbeautifully carved reliefs, representing the inventions of Sarraccus.\nHad it been daylight at the observatory, I would have noticed that it,\ntoo, was decorated with the wonders of other worlds discovered by Almos.\nThe mountains on Earth, the seas, clouds, volcanoes, and ships; these\nand many other objects that do not exist on Mars, were carved with\nremarkable faithfulness upon the walls of the observatory, and were\nlooked upon by Martians as the wonders of a strange world.\n\nAs at the observatory, the doorway was hung with heavy porti\u00e8res, and,\npassing through these, we found ourselves in what appeared to be an\nimmense palm garden, in which Martians were to be seen sitting in\ngroups, or walking about admiring the plants and flowers. Sunlight\nstreamed in through the roof, the covering of which had been rolled\nback, and I became aware that it was in such places as this that the\nMartians were to be found during the heat of the day.\n\nRain being unknown, it was necessary to grow the more delicate plants\nwhere they might be watered regularly and sheltered from the heat of the\nmidday sun, and also from the hot winds that often came at this season.\nI now realized that the trees that I had noticed were to be found only\nupon the banks of streams and lakes, and that, with the exception of the\ngreen these afforded, Mars was entirely covered with a small and hardy\npink flower of the antennaria family, which flourishes in a dry and\nsandy soil.\n\nReon now left me, promising to return within an hour, in order that I\nmight reach the observatory in due time. As I walked slowly among the\ntall palms, taking a path here and there at random and admiring the\nbeautiful beds of flowers, some of which I recognized as flowers also\nindigenous to Earth, I noticed that all whom I met greeted me in the\nmost cordial way, some pausing to say a few words. I saw the importance\nof saying whatever was prompted by the first appearance of the\nindividual, and I found that I could thus join in a most enjoyable\nconversation with these charming people, with a knowledge of their names\nand the matters of interest to them. All were very enthusiastic about\nthe lumaharp, and I anxiously awaited another number upon this wonderful\ninstrument.\n\nAs the paths I turned down were all strange to me, I judged that Almos\nwas not familiar with the interior of this particular building, but as\nthere were many gardens nearer the observatory, he would have no reason\nto visit this one, except on an occasion of this kind.\n\nNot realizing the enormous size of the building, I had wandered far from\nthe entrance at which I was to meet Reon, and had decided to ask to be\ndirected back, when suddenly I stopped, rooted to the ground, every\nnerve straining to catch a faint melodious sound that seemed to fill the\nair. No music on Earth could equal it! Before me arose a vision of\nbeautiful flowers--flowers that had thoughts as beautiful as themselves,\nand that through the genius of a man poured forth their souls in a\nvolume of melody, so beautiful as to beggar description.\n\nAs Almos was perfectly familiar with this remarkable invention, a\ngradual comprehension of the wonderful genius of Sarraccus, its\ninventor, came to me. Tall, calm, and of dignified bearing; a man of\ngreat learning, but of few words; Sarraccus had won the love and\nadmiration of all by his discovery of the regenerating rays that had\ngiven the people of Mars perpetual life and health. He it was who had\ndiscovered super-radium, and this wonderful power had, in time, been\nused by others until many important inventions had developed from it,\nsuch as the virator, the radioscope, the radiphone, illumination without\nexpenditure of power or material, and several minor inventions, all of\nwhich, however, contributed greatly to the comfort and advancement of\nthis great people.\n\nThe aerenoid, one of his most important inventions, had made it possible\nto reach any part of the globe within an hour, and this, coming at the\ntime of the great change in the social conditions on Mars, had expedited\nthe movement to a wonderful extent by bringing the inhabitants of every\nquarter of the globe into daily contact with one another. So easy and\nrapid was this means of transit through the air, that cities and towns\nwere soon abolished, and in the process of time, Mars attained the\nideal, and became a World Beautiful--the magnificent estate of one large\nfamily.\n\nAnd now Sarraccus had given the flowers a voice to sing of their\nbeauty. In the mind of this great genius was conceived the idea that\ninasmuch as there is ineffable beauty to the eye in the soft colors and\nshades of a flower--beauty too rare for the hand of man to\nreproduce--there must also be a corresponding sweetness of sound or\nvibration, if it were possible to transform its beauty into sound.\nLight-waves, he reasoned, varying according to the color and shade of\nthe object, might be changed into sound-waves, if an instrument were\nmade sensitive enough to vibrate in response to these extremely delicate\nundulations of light. The vibrations would then vary in accordance with\nthe light-waves, and a harmony of sound, corresponding in sweetness to\nthe beauty of the flower, would result.\n\nAfter many unsuccessful trials, Sarraccus found a material that, in the\nform of a fine wire, twenty or thirty feet in length, vibrated in\nresponse to light of a certain color, as a wire in a piano or harp will\noften be attuned sympathetically to a certain note in the human voice,\nand will vibrate whenever that note is reached. The vibrations of this\nwire in response to light, however, were almost imperceptible, and it\nwas only upon testing with a highly sensitive instrument that they were\ndiscovered. Several wires were then made of different thickness, and\neach was found to have a sympathetic vibration to a light of a certain\ncolor. The quantity of wires was then increased to represent every\npossible shade of color, and when these were stretched between two large\ndrums, a faint sound was detected. The drums were then enclosed in\nchambers that led into large horns, and thus the sounds caused by the\ndelicate vibrations of the wires, though as soft as the sighing of the\nwind, were diffused and augmented so as to reach into every corner of\nthe large building. Enclosed in a dark room, the wires occupied the\nposition of a plate in a camera, a large lens being adjusted in the wall\nopposite them.\n\nThe image of a flower, illuminated by the sun's light, was now thrown\nupon the wires, and a marvelous melody of sound resulted. Each delicate\nshade of color in the flower found a sympathetic wire which vibrated in\nresponse to it, and the harmony produced by all in chorus was the\nineffably sweet song of Nature. As Nature expressed its dreams of\nbeauty in flowers, which in their simplicity and radiance defy the hand\nof man to equal, so did the melody of these flowers far surpass anything\nthat the ear of man had ever before heard. Did not the lilies of the\nfield receive the tribute of Christ? What wonderfully effective yet\nsimple truth would not He have heard in this surpassing melody? As\ndifferent flowers were placed before the instrument, so would the music\nchange; often sad and appealing as a whispered prayer, it would change\nagain to a joyous triumphal chorus, full of the gladness of life and\nbeauty.\n\nFor a moment I stood spellbound, then by some irresistible, mystic power\nI was drawn to it; and eagerly seeking the paths that led in the\ndirection of the sound, I became aware that as I gradually understood\nand sympathized with this compelling cry of Nature, so the melody seemed\nto become my every hope. Ambition, love, aspiration, and passion surged\nthrough that grand symphony. It was heard and understood by the soul, as\nother music ministers to the ear, and as I eagerly listened I was\nsensible of a yearning for a love--a love that was soon forgotten, and I\nknew it to be mine. In the wonders of this new world I had forgotten\nthe love that, while on Earth, I had been ready to risk my life for, and\nnow it was the eleventh hour, and who could say whether I should ever\nreturn to this paradise?\n\nSeeing a little rustic arbor, and being overcome with the excess of\nemotion and beauty, I turned my steps thither to rest and think.\nSituated in a shaded corner of the building, the interior of the arbor\nwas almost in darkness, and I felt that here I would be alone and\nunobserved. Every instant I grew more sad at heart over the time which I\nnow felt had been wasted, and as the melody died away, my head sank on\nmy arms, as I rested them upon the table before me. My Earth-tuned soul\nseemed still to linger under the spell of the enchanted music.\n\nI had remained thus but a few moments when I became conscious of a hand\nsoftly laid upon my shoulder, and a voice, as sweet and gentle as the\nmelody that had just died away, murmured, \"Almos, poor Almos!\"\n\nThe touch had a healing in it and was as gentle as the fall of snow.\nRaising my head I started up, giving utterance to the name that\ninstinctively came to my lips--\"Zarlah!\" It was as if another man had\nspoken the name while I stood entranced with the small soft hand held a\nprisoner in both mine, gazing down upon the beautiful being whose image\nI had so often seen pictured in my mind. It was Zarlah!\n\nI knew, now, that this beauteous image had not been an hallucination,\nand by what miracle it had all happened I cared not. Enough that this\nbeautiful, radiant woman actually existed, and in one quick bound of the\nheart, I realized my all-consuming, deathless love for her.\n\nWhat I might have indiscreetly said in the great emotions of those first\nmoments, I know not, but before I could give utterance to further words,\nAlmos' calm demeanor had asserted itself, and in a voice that gave no\nevidence of how I was torn within, I said:\n\n\"How is it, Zarlah, that you find time from your studies to linger\nhere?\"\n\n\"My studies have brought me here,\" she answered, gently withdrawing her\nhand and rising as if to go. Then quickly lifting her shining eyes to\nmine, in a playfully reproachful tone, she said, \"And have you no\nexperiments at the observatory that demand your attention that you can\nafford to linger here, Almos?\"\n\nHow beautiful she looked as she stood before me thus! Surely I could not\nhope for a better time than now to tell her all that was in my heart.\nThere was uncertainty in the future--perhaps I would never again be\ngiven the opportunity to speak that with which my soul burned.\n\nPlacing a hand lightly on her shoulder and looking down into her\nwonderful eyes, I said tenderly, \"The reason I have lingered here,\nZarlah, was to think of you.\"\n\nA tremor of her slight form was the only response I received for some\nseconds that seemed hours to me, then, with her eyes turned away so I\ncould not read in them my fate, she murmured, \"Did you not come to hear\nthe wonderful instrument by which Sarraccus gives the flowers a voice?\"\n\n\"I did,\" I answered passionately, \"and its sweet melody whispered only\nof you--the radiant rose of the spheres. It told me of the yearning in\nmy heart--it sang of your great beauty, and of my unspeakable love for\nyou, and sobbed at the time I have wasted, a fortune of golden moments;\nthen, as it died away, it led me to you. Is not this melody of flowers\ndirect from God's own hand, Zarlah? It must then be decreed by Him that\nI should love you, for being truth itself, it can appeal only to the\ntruth that is within the soul.\"\n\nI drew her unresisting form toward me, and, gently pushing back the\nwaves of soft brown hair, I tenderly kissed the beautiful face, radiant\nwith the light of love. A thought of fabled beauties of Earth passed\nbefore me. Could any of them compare with my Martian love? Would not the\nface of Helen--that which \"launched a thousand ships\" at Troy--have\npaled into insignificance beside it?\n\nFor some moments we remained thus, neither of us caring to break that\nsacred silence which to lovers means infinitely more than words. The joy\nof feeling that my love was returned, and that she whom I held in my\narms was mine, made me forget all else, until, with a little sob, Zarlah\nwhispered:\n\n\"Dearest, in our great happiness, we must not forget the duties that\nhave been confided to us. You must return to the observatory at once.\nCome, and I will accompany you to where Reon waits.\"\n\nThe truth of Zarlah's words flashed upon me, and with it a full\nrealization of the terrible mistake I had made. In the eyes of Zarlah I\nwas a Martian, her life-long friend, Almos, and her anxiety for me to\nreturn to the observatory was the prompting of her Martian sense of\nduty--her sole creed. In what words could I ever hope to explain that I\nwas not Almos, when the voice, the manners, the features, and even the\nknowledge of her affairs were those of her intimate friend? And even if\nit were possible to make Zarlah believe in the remarkable change of\npersonality, by explaining in full the weird and uncanny details of how\nthe change was effected, what happiness could I hope to derive from it;\nit was Almos she loved, not a strange spirit of whom she could know\nnothing--a spirit even from an alien world.\n\nSuch were the thoughts that filled my mind, as I walked beside Zarlah\nthrough this more than Edenic garden toward the entrance where Reon was\nto wait for me. But, although utterly crushed by the realization of my\nown hopeless case, I felt that the knowledge of Zarlah's love, of which\nI had so wrongly come into possession, had imposed upon me a sacred\nduty. I therefore gave no outward evidence of my emotions, though my\ncup of happiness was now changed to one of sorrow and bitterness, and\nwhen Zarlah proposed that we should meet the following evening, I\nquickly assented with all a lover's eagerness.\n\nWe had now reached the entrance and, as we stepped out on the balcony, I\nsaw Reon waiting for me with the aerenoid in readiness. Seeing a merry\nparty in a large open aerenoid, and knowing them to be Zarlah's friends,\nI would have escorted her to them, but in a low tone she earnestly\nbesought me to lose no time in reaching the observatory.\n\nA few words of farewell--a slight pressure of hands, and we parted; and\nas I walked over to where Reon stood, ready for the journey, I could not\nhelp marveling at the great sacredness in which all duties are held in\nthe eyes of the Martians; duties, too, that have no other reward than\ntheir own fulfillment. A feeling of shame came over me as I thought of\nthe endless struggle, selfishness, and crime of another world that is a\nslave to Gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nA HUNDRED MILES A MINUTE IN AN AERENOID.\n\n\nReon was at his place by the levers when I stepped into the aerenoid,\nand as I closed and fastened the steel door, we slowly rose, and\ndescribing a large circle, sailed toward the canal. As the sun was now\nlow in the heavens, numerous open aerenoids were to be seen, but these\nwere soon passed, and within a few minutes we had reached the branch\ncanal where our speed increased.\n\nMy thoughts were now turned to the long journey before me. So deeply\nabsorbed had I been in the rapid events since I left the observatory,\nthat I had given little thought to time. My great happiness at meeting\nand being with Zarlah had caused me to forget completely the importance\nof returning to the observatory within two hours, and as the thought\nnow flashed through my mind, I hastily consulted the time. To my great\ndismay I found I had but twenty minutes in which to cover quarter of\nMars. This I knew was possible, but it left such a narrow margin that\nany delay or accident, en route, would prove disastrous to our plans,\nthus bringing fatal consequences.\n\nWe had now reached the large canal in which we had attained such great\nspeed, and, rising, we proceeded to pass over it. As we crossed the\nbanks there came a rushing sound from beneath us, as of a mighty gust of\nwind, and, looking through one of the small windows in the side of the\ncar, I saw in the distance a speck, which, in another moment,\ndisappeared. Our aerenoid now gently rocked with the motion of a boat\nthat is in the swell of a passing steamer, and I instantly realized that\nanother aerenoid, travelling at a terrific speed, had passed in the\ncanal beneath us.\n\nWe had now reached the canal that ran parallel to the one over which we\nhad just passed. This was in every way similar to the first and was used\nby aerenoids going in an opposite direction. Into this canal we turned,\nsinking lower as our speed increased, until, when we had reached our\nmaximum speed, we were travelling not more than thirty feet above the\nwater. Thus, whenever necessary, we were ready for an instant plunge in\norder to reduce our speed, and thus did this simple rule of starting\nhigh and sinking lower as the speed increased make collisions\nimpossible.\n\nAs it was late in the afternoon when we started, the daylight soon\nfaded, and in a few minutes we had reached complete darkness, the double\nline of lights on the canal banks being our only guide. Anxiously did I\ncount the minutes as we sped along, but knowing the danger of\ndistracting Reon's attention, even for a moment, while we were\ntravelling at such a terrific speed, I kept silent, nor did I allow my\nmanner to give any evidence of my anxiety.\n\nI now realized that if I reached the observatory in time, I would owe my\nlife to Zarlah. Twice had she reminded me of my duties at the\nobservatory, and had insisted upon my immediate departure, when, under\nthe influence of her great beauty, I would have lingered until too late.\nMy mind was fully determined as to how to proceed with regard to\nrighting the wrong I felt I had done Almos, in confessing to Zarlah my\nlove for her. I would leave a note for him at the observatory to the\neffect that I wished to communicate with him the following evening, when\nI would tell him all.\n\nThe hopelessness of my love was plain, for it was Almos whom she loved,\nand she believed also that Almos had confessed his love to her; and,\nwith a lover's conviction that everyone must love the one he loves, I\nfelt that Almos undoubtedly loved Zarlah. Indeed, it was probably his\naffection for her through which I had silently won her confession. Almos\nwould then have no cause to regret my action, and Zarlah would never\nknow the strange circumstances that had brought them together. Thus did\nI picture in my mind a happy conclusion to my selfish and precipitate\naction, which, I had feared at first, must bring overwhelming sorrow and\nhumiliation into three lives, two of which were dearer to me than any on\nEarth.\n\nI was roused from these meditations by the sudden roar of rushing waters\nas, in order to reduce speed, we plunged along the surface of the\ncanal. We were nearing our destination at last, and my mind at once\nreverted to the now imminent danger--that of arriving at the observatory\nonly to find that the wave contact with Paris had ceased, and I was too\nlate ever to return to the world from which I had come. In such a case,\nI determined to write a brief account of my experiences to Almos, and,\nafter arranging the current of super-radium so that it would convey my\nspirit out of the virator (whither I knew not), I would then enter the\nvirator and deliver the body to its rightful owner.\n\nAlthough I determined upon this course as being clearly my duty, in the\nevent of my being too late to return to Earth, the desperate nature of\nsuch a proceeding roused me to action. We had now risen from the canal\nand were floating slowly in the air at a considerable height. Striving\nhard to suppress my agitation, I urged Reon to make more speed, and he\nat once responded by increasing the power. As it was now after midnight\nin this part of Mars, we were in no danger of encountering small\naerenoids in our flight, and in a few moments, to my great relief, I\ndistinguished the observatory lying far beneath us. Describing circles\nover the building, we slowly descended and in a few seconds we had\nreached the balcony.\n\nThanking my companion with a hearty handshake (which came perfectly\nnatural even on Mars), I bade him adieu, and, stepping on to the\nbalcony, made my way into the observatory with all haste. Everything was\nin the condition I had left it, and I was greatly relieved to find that\nthe necessary time for the process of departure still remained, before\nwave contact with Paris ceased. My heart now went out in true gratitude\nand love to her who, in the simple desire to do what was right, had\nplaced duty before her love, and had thus been of such inestimable\nservice to me.\n\nImmediately upon my arrival, I had prepared the virator for my journey\nback to Earth by substituting the projecting apparatus of the radioscope\nfor the receiving apparatus. It was only necessary now to start the\nclockwork that would shut off the current to earth in half an hour, and\nwould start the current flowing through the upper chamber of the\nvirator.\n\nAfter having written a brief note to Almos, saying that I wished to\ncommunicate with him the following evening before making another visit,\nI made a hasty examination of the current of super-radium which now\nflowed through the virator to Earth from the projecting apparatus. The\ninstant my spirit was released, it would be caught up in this current\nand conveyed to my body, where it lay in my rooms in Paris. In half an\nhour the clockwork would shut off the current flowing to Earth, and\nwould then turn on the current which flowed through the upper chamber of\nthe virator, thus transferring Almos' spirit back to the body, as it lay\nin the lower chamber.\n\nAll was in perfect order, but it was not without a feeling of reluctance\nand anxiety that I stepped into the virator and, after carefully\nfastening the door, prepared the cone of chloroform. I realized that\nthere were many dangers attending the return journey that were not\npresent in my journey to Mars. If I had erred in my calculation of the\ntime the super-radium current could be kept on my body in Paris, or if\nmy body had moved in that time, it would undoubtedly mean death to me;\nand the thought of whether Almos, in such a case, would learn of my\nfate on the morrow flashed through my mind. Realizing the danger of such\napprehensions, not only from the loss of valuable time which they\noccupied, but also from the fact that they tended to unnerve me at the\nmoment when hesitation meant death, I quickly fastened the chloroform\ncone over my face and inhaled the fumes.\n\nA moment's consciousness--a flickering light--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE REALIZATION OF A HOPELESS LOVE.\n\n\nI opened my eyes--it was broad daylight, and for some moments I lay\ndreamily surveying the familiar objects in my room, unconscious of all\nthat had happened to me during the previous night. Then, noticing that I\nwas fully dressed, a sudden realization of it all came upon me, and,\nspringing to my feet, I excitedly paced up and down my room, pinching my\narms and legs to make sure that they were in normal condition.\nSatisfying myself upon this point, I then looked at the time, and, to my\nastonishment, found that it was noon.\n\nAs Mars passed out of wave contact about one o'clock in the morning, I\nmust have slept eleven hours after the return of my spirit to Earth. I\nhad greatly feared that even if it were my good fortune ever to regain\nconsciousness, it would be only to discover that I had lost the use of\nmy limbs and was powerless to move. That the super-radium current would\npreserve my body in such a natural condition as even to induce sleep I\nwould not have believed possible. Yet there was every indication that I\nhad awakened from a natural sleep. I felt fresh and full of vigor, and\nthere on my couch lay the cone which, in my sleep, I had unfastened and,\nin turning over, crushed. If I had remained unconscious the entire time\nthere would not have been this evidence of restlessness, and I\nconsidered it of importance as being proof that my sleep had been\nnatural. Beyond this, however, I did not consider the removal of the\ncone from my face as important, as the chloroform must have completely\nevaporated soon after I became unconscious.\n\nNow that I was once again in my laboratory with the humdrum life of a\nmatter-of-fact world surging about me, evincing itself by the continual\nroar of traffic which reached me through the open window, my remarkable\nadventure of the night before seemed like a strange dream. As there was\nno tangible proof that I had actually been on Mars, I might have been\nled to the conclusion that I had chloroformed myself into\nunconsciousness only, and had passed from this state into a deep sleep,\nin which I had dreamed my remarkable experiences. But the clearness and\nconsistency of every detail were amply sufficient to convince me of the\ngenuineness of my experiences on Mars, and that the characters, so\nvividly portrayed in my mind, lived in flesh and blood on a world\nmillions of miles away. Much more convincing than this, however, was the\nmoral obligation that I felt incumbent upon me--a duty I owed to\nanother. No dream could have left me with this keen sense of\nresponsibility.\n\nAlas, I knew only too well that I loved, with an impossible love, a\nbeautiful being of another planet, and that my duty lay in the\nrenunciation of this love to Almos, its rightful possessor.\n\nThus my discovery had not brought me the joy of triumph. The proud\nmoments in an inventor's career when he holds up to the world the fruit\nof his ingenuity and study could not be mine. Indeed, the thought of the\nexcitement that the news of such easy communication with Mars would\ncause, if I demonstrated its truth before reputable scientists, made me\ndetermined to guard the secret of my discovery the more jealously.\nHundreds of instruments similar to mine would be made, and it would soon\nbecome known to all the inhabitants of Mars that they could talk to the\npeople of Earth, resulting in constant communication from all parts of\nboth planets. Such an innovation would soon be a regular pastime of the\nrich. It would then be impossible for me to visit Mars again, as the\ncrossing of the currents of super-radium would add a grave danger to\nsuch an undertaking.\n\nThe possibility of my secret becoming known through an accident (someone\nbreaking into my room or overhearing me talk with Almos) now occurred to\nme, and, in the fear of my being separated from Zarlah forever, I\ndetermined upon another visit to Mars that evening.\n\nI had planned to tell Almos at once of my thoughtless confession of love\nto Zarlah, but in an effort to justify my great desire to see her again,\nI now saw several important reasons for postponing this. I had given my\npromise to Zarlah to be with her the following evening, and it seemed\nonly honorable for me first to fulfil my promise to her. Moreover, under\nthe circumstances, it might be embarrassing for Almos to meet her upon\nsuch short notice. When a man takes a step of this kind, he usually has\nspent some time in consideration beforehand, how much more necessary,\nthen, is time for consideration when this step has been taken for him. I\ntherefore decided to keep my promise to Zarlah and to endeavor to visit\nMars again during the next wave contact.\n\nI did not regret having left the note for Almos, however, as I had no\nmeans of telling whether the mechanism of the virator had done what was\nexpected of it, or not. Almos' life depended upon the accurate working\nof this mechanism after I had gone, and I was anxious to learn of his\nsafety. He would also want to learn of my safe arrival before preparing\nhimself for another undertaking of the kind; to see each other was\ntherefore necessary. Almos would undoubtedly have warned me of this, had\nnot the cessation of wave contact prevented him from giving me\ninstructions.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when a feeling of intense hunger reminded\nme that I had not tasted food for twenty-four hours. I contented myself,\nhowever, with a light meal at a neighboring cafe, knowing the danger of\neating heavily at this time. To my great surprise, I found that this\nsmall amount of food was evidently all my system required. Not only was\nmy hunger appeased, but, while returning to my rooms, I was conscious of\na strength and vigor which were entirely new to me, and which I now\nremembered I had first experienced upon awakening. Could it be that the\nsuper-radium current, possessing the wonderful regenerating rays that\nhad brought perpetual life to the people of Mars, was gradually working\nthis change in my body over a distance of millions of miles? Impossible\nas this seemed there was no other way of accounting for the remarkable\nchange which had taken place in my body.\n\nThe intense excitement I experienced at the thought of possessing\nperpetual life, health, and youth was but momentary, and I reached my\nlaboratory with a full realization of the enormous responsibilities\nwhich my discovery was placing upon me. I could no longer keep it\nsecret; each day that I withheld the knowledge of these rays from my\nfellow beings, hundreds, nay thousands, of lives would be laid to my\naccount. The knowledge had not been given to me that I should guard it\nselfishly. The hope that, even though I could never call Zarlah my own,\nI might often spend a few happy hours with her in her Martian paradise\nwas now shattered forever. I must stifle my love or commit a crime\nagainst every living soul on Earth; and as I paced my room in agony,\nwith my hands pressed to my temples to ease their throbbing, a great cry\nof anguish from the multitude in Death's grasp rang through my brain. My\nheart was torn asunder by two great conflicting emotions, Love and Duty,\nand in this torture of mind and body I moved restlessly back and forth\nin my room, until the fading light warned me of the near approach of\nwave contact with Mars.\n\nThere was but one course open to me; I would tell Almos of my experience\nwith the rays, and if he should decide that they were the same as the\nregenerating rays, possessing all their properties, and that continual\nlife was now within reach of the people on Earth, I would make my\ndiscovery public on the morrow. This would be my solemn duty, no matter\nwhat sacrifice it involved, and I could not help feeling that this\nsecond visit to Mars might be the last.\n\nA hasty examination of my instrument assured me that all was in order,\nand, turning on the current, I now watched the surface of wires for the\nglow that would signalize the commencement of wave contact. Should this\nglow appear without an image of any kind it would have but one\nmeaning--that the mechanism of the virator had failed to do its work the\nnight previous, and that disaster had befallen Almos.\n\nMy heart beat fast, therefore, when in a short time a faint glow\nappeared on the upper portion of my instrument and rapidly spread until\nit covered the entire surface. As it grew brighter I was obliged to turn\naway, before I could recognize any image, and, as I stood shielding my\neyes from the strong glare, I felt my heart sink within me. But, before\nI could approach the instrument again, I heard my name called in the\nclear, ringing tones of Almos' beloved voice.\n\nI reached the instrument with a bound, and there, standing with his\nhands extended toward me and a smile of greeting on his handsome face, I\nsaw my brave Martian brother.\n\n\"My dear Almos, how glad I am to see you are safe!\" I cried, tears of\njoy springing to my eyes at finding that the fears of a moment ago were\nunfounded.\n\n\"It is entirely due to your forethought in leaving the note, that either\nof us are safe,\" Almos responded. \"Had you not done this, disaster to\none or both of us must certainly have resulted, through ignorance of\neach other's plans. Let me congratulate you, my brave fellow, for having\nso successfully accomplished your remarkable journey. This is the\ninitial step in the linking together of the destinies of Earth and Mars.\n\n\"But now I should like to hear an account of your experiences here, for\nalthough I have gradually become aware of many impressions you left, I\nfind it is only of the things suggested by my mind that I can gather\nanything.\"\n\n\"Then it is evident that the brain is merely a book of reference for the\nmind,\" I replied, \"as I was not instantly aware of your knowledge of\nMartian affairs, but only upon a subject being suggested by my mind,\nwas the information regarding it available. Thus, the mind is aware of\nimpressions it has made on the brain, but is totally ignorant of\nimpressions made by another mind, unless the thought is suggested.\"\n\nI now gave Almos a brief description of my journey, explaining that, as\nI intended to make another visit to Mars that evening, I would leave the\nfull account of my experiences until the following night. I was careful\nnot to make any reference to Zarlah, as I felt that my second meeting\nwith her would put me in a much better position to approach Almos on\nthis extremely delicate subject and lay before him my plans. Moreover, I\nwas anxious that nothing should interfere with those few happy hours to\nwhich I looked forward with such intense desire.\n\nAlmos listened to my narrative with wrapt attention, and not until I\nconcluded by describing the remarkable effects of the regenerating rays,\ndid he give utterance to a word. Then, to my amazement, he said:\n\n\"The result is what I fully expected. The proof that the regenerating\nrays exist in the super-radium current, lies in the fact that your body\nwas perfectly preserved for six hours, and there is no reason for\nsupposing that they differ, in any way, from the rays which preserve\nlife here for an unlimited time.\"\n\n\"Then I can no longer keep my discovery a secret,\" I declared\nresolutely. \"It becomes my solemn duty at once to make public the\nknowledge of these wonderful rays emanating from Mars.\"\n\n\"What you say is indeed the truth,\" rejoined Almos. \"The time has now\narrived; the existence of a people on Mars, our early history, progress,\nand the conditions under which we live at the present day, must now\nbecome known upon Earth; our inventions and scientific advancement must\nbe made available to Earth's scientists. Since the discovery of the\nradioscope, which enabled us to see the people on your planet, Mars has\nyearned to give a helping hand to her younger sister. That time has now\ncome, and before many years the conditions of life on Earth will be\nsimilar to those here. A great work must be accomplished, however, but\nthe burden of that work rests upon me; when it is finished the goal of\nmy life has been reached. There are many things that are not clear to\nyou now, my dear fellow, but there is no time at present for\nexplanations. In half an hour I shall have prepared for your\nvisit--remember, no matter what happens, tomorrow all shall be\nexplained.\"\n\nHaving thus spoken, his voice and manner evincing great earnestness and\ndetermination, he waved his hand in farewell, and instantly the\ninstrument was plunged into darkness.\n\nFor some moments I stood motionless under the spell that his remarkable\npersonality had cast over me, nor did even his abrupt manner appear at\nall strange, such perfect harmony of word and action existed in this\nMartian genius. Indeed, it seemed a fitting conclusion to all that had\ngone before. Speaking rapidly, as though realizing the loss of time in\nmere words, his handsome face, strong with determination, holding me\nfascinated, he had confessed the ambition nearest and dearest to his\nheart--that of giving to Earth the discoveries and inventions of\nhundreds of years of advancement in science; all that had resulted in\nthe longevity, health, peace, and happiness which existed upon Mars.\n\nHumbled at my own insignificance and full of admiration for this great\ncharacter, I turned slowly away, and, procuring a light, commenced to\nprepare for my journey.\n\nMy letters and other papers, with a brief note of explanation, still\nremained on my desk, and, as my glance fell upon this bundle, I became\nconscious of a nervousness, which, although to many would be perfectly\nnatural at such a time, was entirely strange to me. I had not\nexperienced the least nervousness on the occasion of my first visit the\nnight before, yet the mere sight of this package on my desk, with its\nnote of explanation, now caused me an uneasiness, which, try as I would,\nI could not ignore.\n\nMaking the few necessary preparations about my room for the night, I\nsecured the door with lock and bolt, and, drawing my couch before the\ninstrument, poured out a glass of wine and lit a cigar, hoping thus to\nsteady my nerves.\n\nThe day had been warm and close, and a thunderstorm of unusual violence\nmade the night a wild one. Vivid flashes of lightning that seemed to vie\nwith each other in intensity, darted from the heavens, accompanied by\ndeafening crashes of thunder that shook the building to its\nfoundations, while the shrieking of the wind, as though it were rushing\nthrough the rigging of a ship at sea, added to the noise of the tempest.\n\nWithin a few moments the glow on my instrument would be the signal for\nmy departure, and, as I prepared the cone of chloroform, I could not\nsuppress a shudder at the thought of my spirit going out into the fury\nof such a storm. It seemed as if Death, in the fear of being driven from\nEarth and forever despoiled of his cruel victories, had turned loose the\nelements in his fury, and waited without to wreak vengeance on my\naudacious spirit as it sped through space.\n\nAn instant an intensely white glare on the surface of wires at this\nmoment gave evidence of the super-radium current. It was the signal for\nmy departure, and, with a brief but earnest prayer, I seized the cone,\nand, taking my position on the couch, inhaled the fumes of chloroform.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nZARLAH'S CONFESSION.\n\n\nIt was with a feeling of thankfulness that, upon opening my eyes, I\nfound myself in the virator. The storm, which I had feared might prove\ndisastrous, had been passed through safely, and now reigned the\nwonderful quiet of Mars. The strange uneasiness, which I had experienced\nupon my departure from Earth, was forgotten in the anticipation of the\ngreat joy before me, or I would have noticed that the usual calm, ever\ncharacteristic of Almos, was lacking.\n\nIt was already past the hour of my appointment with Zarlah, and, eager\nto be with her, I hastily made the necessary preparations for my return\nto Earth. Although these consisted merely of changing the current so\nthat it would flow from the virator to Earth, and adjusting the\nclockwork for the hour of departure, I had decided upon the importance\nof doing this beforehand, as any mistake made in the haste of departure\nwould prove fatal to either Almos or myself.\n\nThese preparations attended to, I now made my way to the balcony. I had\nrelied upon Almos' knowledge to guide me to Zarlah, and, as I reached\nthe open air, I at once felt his judgment assert itself. Two aerenoids\nwere moored to the balcony, a large high-speed one of the submarine-boat\ntype and a small open one. Into the latter I stepped, and, with a\nperfect knowledge of its operation, glided out upon the cool night air.\n\nGently rising to about three hundred feet, I lay suspended between the\nfairyland stretched beneath me and the brilliantly starred heavens. I\nwas perfectly aware of the direction in which I was to go, but for a few\nmoments I lay thus suspended, enjoying as could only an inhabitant of\nEarth, the strangeness and marvel of it all.\n\nThe little vessel had reached the limit of height to which it was\ndesigned to ascend and, upon realizing this, I became aware that, for\nsafety, all aerenoids are limited to a certain height by the amount of\nrepelling metal used in their construction. The high-speed aerenoids,\nowing to their build, being better adapted to withstand the atmospheric\nconditions at a great altitude, can ascend several thousand feet, but\nall are limited to what is considered a safe height for the class to\nwhich they belong. The action of the repelling metal being independent\nof the atmosphere, the danger of an aerenoid getting beyond control, and\nrising above the envelope of air which surrounds the planet is thus\neliminated.\n\nAs these thoughts came into my mind, I glanced up into the heavens with\nits countless stars--one being the world from which I came--when lo! a\nremarkable phenomenon met my gaze. In the west hung a crescent moon,\nsomewhat smaller than Earth's moon, but extremely brilliant, while out\nof the east rose another moon at its full. So rapidly did this latter\nmoon rise, that its journey through the heavens was perceptible, and it\nwas evident that within an hour it would sink into the western horizon,\nhaving gradually changed its phase to a crescent. In seven hours it\nwould encircle Mars, and again appear above the eastern horizon.\n\nMy interest in this moon was intensified when I realized that it was\nbut a few thousand miles distant, and so small, that it would require\nbut a couple of days' comfortable walking to encircle it. Compared with\nmy journey from Earth, this few thousand miles seemed but an\ninsignificant distance, and I immediately thought of the possibility of\nreaching it in a high-speed aerenoid to which a sufficient amount of the\nrepelling metal was attached to overcome the gravity of Mars. But I\ninstantly was aware of the fact that an attempt to reach this moon had\nbeen made many years previously, and that the intrepid Martians who\nundertook the hazardous journey, never returned. Although their aerenoid\ncarried enough oxygen to supply them for many days after they had left\nthe atmosphere of Mars, it was decided later that they had been lost in\nspace, unable either to reach the moon or return to Mars. The gravity of\nso small a body would be insufficient to draw them to it, unless they\ntraveled straight in its direction, and, as the moon was moving rapidly\naround Mars, the chances of this were admittedly small. Moreover, once\nout of the atmosphere of Mars, it would be impossible to propel the\naerenoid, and, having missed the moon, they would travel on and on\nthrough endless space. Had they reached the moon they could have\nreturned, as the repelling force on a body with so little gravity, would\nbe greatly increased, and would have hurled them into the gravity of\nMars again, as soon as they exposed the repelling metal. There could be\nno doubt that they had never reached the moon, and their terrible fate\nresulted in a safe limitation of this dangerous metal upon all\naerenoids.\n\nSo absorbed had I become in these intensely interesting details supplied\nby Almos' knowledge, that time had passed without my realizing it, and,\nreproaching myself for having wasted the valuable moments I might have\nspent with Zarlah, I now moved the lever at my side and glided gently\nforward.\n\nThe moon, however, as it rapidly journeyed across the heavens, seemed to\nhold a strange fascination for me, and my gaze constantly reverted to\nit. Had I realized that this fascination was caused by the approach of a\nterrible danger, I might have paid heed to the warning, but desirous now\nto get to my journey's end, which, according to Earth's proverb, should\nend in a lover's meeting, I thought only of the time I had lost, and\nimpatiently put the subject from my mind.\n\nMoreover, as my meeting with Zarlah drew near, thoughts that were\nrelevant and of a more serious character filled my mind. My present\nvisit to her now began to appear most unjustifiable. If I had found\nexcuse for my action of the previous evening, in the enthusiasm of so\nsuddenly beholding the object of my adoration, unaccustomed as I was to\nmy strange position, I had no such excuse now. To appear before her\nagain as Almos, after having seen my folly and realized the deceit of my\nposition toward her, would be an act of shameful duplicity. I had not\nrealized this before, for I had thought only of my great love for her\nand the joy of again being with her, but now the crushing force with\nwhich the truth presented itself, caused me to hesitate before taking\nanother step that I now felt would be impossible to justify before\nAlmos. In this great uncertainty of mind I glided slowly along.\n\nThe wonderful stillness of the night was broken only by the faint hum of\nvoices and merry laughter that reached me from below. Glancing down, I\nobserved numerous open aerenoids floating some two hundred feet beneath\nme, while now and then those of the high-speed class appeared, slowly\nwending their way toward the canals, to fly to different parts of the\nglobe. But although I was aware that for convenience of landing it was\ncustomary to travel just high enough to escape the buildings, I\ncontinued on at my present elevation, as I felt the need of deep and\nearnest thought, which I realized would be impossible amid the gay\nthrong nearer the surface.\n\nAs the highest speed attainable by open aerenoids, which were used\nmainly for pleasure, was but eight miles an hour, my journey of five\nmiles gave me ample time for meditation; and when I at last alighted on\nthe balcony of a small white marble villa, to which I had instinctively\nguided my aerenoid, I had fully determined upon what I felt to be the\nonly honorable course to pursue. This was to confide all in Zarlah, and,\nno matter at what cost, to reveal to her the strange conditions that hid\nthe identity of a being from another world behind that of her friend\nAlmos.\n\nHaving secured my aerenoid, I stood on the balcony, entranced at the\nbeauty of the scene before me, which lay bathed in a wonderful\nstarlight--far more brilliant than the light of the full moon upon\nEarth--shed by a myriad of blazing gems in a sky that knew no clouds. A\nperfect stillness reigned, save for the rippling laughter of a little\nstream, that wended its way through an avenue of trees to a lake of\nglistening silver, a short distance beyond.\n\n\"What happiness would be mine in such a paradise, with Zarlah for my\nown!\" I thought, and a great anguish filled my heart, as I realized the\nimpossibility of it--and now for the first time I also realized the\nimpossibility of life without Zarlah. A sudden dread of meeting the one\nI loved came upon me--a dread of seeing the light of love in her eyes,\neven for an instant, knowing that it was not for me. I felt I could not\nbear to behold the look of tenderness in her beautiful face change to\none of hatred, upon learning how she had been deceived; and in my agony\nof spirit, I cried in a voice of deep emotion:\n\n\"Ah, Zarlah! I have won you, yet you are not mine! You have loved me,\nyet I am not loved!\"\n\n\"I am yours, and I love you, Harold,\" softly protested a voice at my\nside.\n\nWith a start I turned and beheld Zarlah, and for a moment I stood as if\ngazing at an apparition.\n\nRealizing my bewilderment, she laid her hand gently upon my arm, and in\na low voice, full of compassion, said: \"It is Harold Lonsdale whom I\nlove!\"\n\nIn a delirium of ecstasy I caught the small white hand and pressed it to\nmy lips. Passing my arm about her I drew her tenderly toward me, gazing\ndown into her beautiful eyes where lay a world of tenderness and love.\nMy heart was too full for words--it was all too wonderful to understand;\nenough that I knew Zarlah to be wholly mine, and in those few silent\nmoments of absolute happiness and contentment, the little stream's merry\nlaughter seemed to swell into the great joyous chorus of all creation,\nbehind which is the great love principle.\n\nTogether we left the balcony and walked beneath the giant trees toward\nthe lake, Zarlah relating to me how, through an instrument she\npossessed, which transmitted and received thought-waves, she had not\nonly learned of Almos' communication with Earth, but had descried a\nmental picture of the inhabitant of that distant world with whom he had\nspoken.\n\nOn the evening of my first communication with Mars, Zarlah was testing\nthis instrument on Almos' mind, when, to her great astonishment, she\ncame into thought communication with Earth. As this was the first trial\nof the instrument, Almos himself was unaware of the success that had\ncrowned Zarlah's invention, though he had taken much interest in it, and\nhad on several occasions given his advice during its construction.\nAlthough this instrument was only capable of transmitting and receiving\nthought-waves over a few miles, it was evident that through the medium\nof Almos' mind, which was in communication with mine, the thought-waves\nwere conveyed to Earth by the super-radium current.\n\nZarlah had thus learned of my proposed visit to Mars, but had not known\nwhen the attempt was to be made, until, seeing Almos in evident distress\nat the recital of the lumaharp, she had feared that the attempt had\nproved disastrous. When, however, I evinced my astonishment at seeing\nher, she knew instantly that before her stood the personality of the\nman from distant Earth, who had been projected to her in mental\npictures, and who was called Harold Lonsdale. When I spoke to her of my\nlove, she realized that her image had also been projected to my mind,\nand, as she listened to my impassioned words, she recognized in them the\nthoughts of love that had accompanied the projection of my image.\nIndeed, my every thought of Zarlah, during wave contact, had been\nprojected to her through the medium of this remarkable instrument.\n\nWith a keen desire to see and examine the mechanism, by which thoughts\ncould be transferred over millions of miles, I said: \"But where is this\nwonderful instrument of which you speak, Zarlah?\"\n\nWe had reached the lake, and now stood on the bank overlooking its\nglistening surface.\n\nA tremor ran through her slight form as she drew closer to me, and said\nimploringly: \"You must not ask to see it! Oh, Harold! Do you not realize\nthe grief this instrument has brought into our lives? Have you partaken\nof the sweetness so deeply, that you fail to perceive the bitterness\nthat lies beneath? You can be but a beloved memory to me--the memory of\na lover millions of miles away--but we are separated by that which is\nfar greater than distance!\"\n\nHer voice died away in a sob, and, as I drew her gently toward me, she\nwept bitterly. Thus had I of Earth brought tears into a world that had\nnot known sorrow for hundreds of years.\n\n\"But, dearest,\" I argued, tenderly smoothing back the soft brown hair,\nand striving to cheer her, \"we are now commencing on an era of planet\ncommunication, and it may not be long before a means is discovered of\nactually transferring people from one planet to another. Did not\nexplorers, some years ago, have this in mind, when they attempted to\nreach the nearest moon? And even though they failed to reach their goal,\nwho knows that they were not drawn to some planet that was in opposition\nat that time, and are now prepared for a return journey at the next\nopposition? With the complete absence of resistance there is in space,\ntheir speed would become terrific--thousands of miles a minute--and at\nsuch a rate it would be possible to reach a planet in opposition, long\nbefore their month's supply of oxygen became exhausted. Heat would not\nbe generated as there would be no friction until the planet's\natmosphere was reached, but long before this they would have applied\ntheir repelling force, which would reduce their speed, thus enabling\nthem to sail gently through the atmosphere and alight safely on the\nplanet's surface.\"\n\nAlthough I had not as much confidence in such an achievement as I sought\nto inspire (well knowing the vast difference between a spiritual\ntransfer and a material one over such a tremendous distance), I wished,\nabove all, to cheer Zarlah. Indeed, I feared that grief might bring the\nmost serious consequences on Mars. I was greatly relieved, therefore,\nupon observing her countenance light up with a sudden interest, as I\nexpressed these sanguine predictions as to the future.\n\nIt was not until some hours later, when I was alone, that this incident\ncaused me much anxiety, as I remembered that, in spite of the keen\ninterest Zarlah had evinced, she had carefully avoided any allusion to\nthe subject afterwards. But in the subsequent events of the evening this\nescaped my notice, and, glad to observe the soothing effect my words had\nupon her, I did not pursue the thought further.\n\nWe had descended by a flight of stone steps to the water's edge, and,\nas we stepped upon the narrow strip of pebbly beach, walled in by\ncavernous rocks, Zarlah, with great earnestness, exclaimed: \"You are\nright, dear Harold, we must be hopeful, and not waste the few precious\nmoments we have together in regrets that are useless. We shall always\nlove each other, and if we are brave--even unto death--Love will find a\nway!\"\n\nPoor Zarlah! Little did I imagine the desperate plan that was already\nforming in her mind when she uttered these words, that before the close\nof another day would indeed have proved her \"brave even unto death.\"\n\nDrawing closer to me and turning her beautiful face up to mine, she\nsaid, after a pause, in which she seemed to read my very soul: \"Before\nme lies a duty, Harold, which with you at my side I have the strength to\nperform, but without you the sacrifice is too great.\"\n\n\"What is it, dearest?\" I asked, pressing the little hand I held to my\nlips.\n\n\"It is to destroy the wicked instrument of which I have told you. I had\nnot the courage to do this before, as I feared for your safety in\nreturning to Earth, and to have destroyed it then would have left me in\nfearful suspense. But now I must put away, forever, this awful thing\nthat possesses the power to reveal the thoughts of my fellow beings,\nthat its mechanism may never become known and thus prove an eternal\ncurse to the world.\"\n\nWith these words, Zarlah disappeared for a moment in the gloom of a cave\nnearby, and, returning with a small metal box, said in a voice which\nbetrayed great emotion: \"Take it, Harold, and hurl it far out into the\nwaters of the lake, where it will sink forever from sight!\"\n\nThe earnestness with which Zarlah had spoken of this device, proved how\ndeeply its existence troubled her conscience, and restrained me from\nmaking any attempt to persuade her from thus severing a connecting\nstrand between two hearts so widely separated. I therefore took the box\nand, with all my strength, hurled it far out into the lake, where it\nsank to remain a secret for all time.\n\nSwiftly flew those precious moments in which Fate had destined that two\nhearts from separate worlds should taste of each other's love, and\nthen--what? Alone in our great love we drank deeply the cup of\nhappiness, and the hour of parting, ever drawing nearer, seemed but a\ncloud on the horizon. At last, yielding to necessity, we retraced our\nsteps, leaving the scene of our joyous love behind, and the dread of\nparting filled our hearts and stifled our words of happiness.\n\nStrange to say, as I stood in that other world, there surged through my\nalien mind some lines of Clinton Scollard's, which I had once learned,\nlittle dreaming of their significance:\n\n    \"Lo, it has come, the inevitable hour\n    When thou and I, beloved one, must part;\n    When heart be sundered from caressing heart,\n    And ungloomed skies be turned to dreary gray.\"\n\nA silence fell upon us, both dreading to put into words the thoughts we\nknew must be spoken. Then, as our hearts beat audibly in the sacred\nstillness of night that had fallen about us, Zarlah murmured, clinging\nto me in despair, \"Oh, Harold, my love, how can we bear the agony of\nbeing parted!\"\n\n\"I would give my life to remain with you, dearest!\" I answered, pressing\nher passionately to me, but in a more soothing tone I added,\n\n\"We must be brave, love, it is but for a day--to-morrow I shall return,\nbut before my departure from Earth I will speak with Almos, and tell him\nthat I wish to abandon my body forever and to abide in spirit on Mars.\nIn a virator constructed with two upper chambers, my spirit could be\nretained indefinitely, and I would then see you daily through the medium\nof Almos. To-morrow, dearest, I shall return to you with good news.\"\n\n\"Ah! Harold, you do not see the impossibility of such a thing--you\ncannot behold it through a woman's eyes. No, no! I can never see Almos\nagain! I gave my love to you through his medium, and to see him when you\nwere absent would be greater agony than I could bear. I must go with\nyou, Harold, to the world in which you live, where I can have you\nalways.\"\n\nWith words of love and assurance I tried to comfort the brave little\nheart that beat so loyally for me, and, fearing to leave her in this\nunhappy condition, I lingered until barely time remained in which to\nreach the observatory before Paris would pass out of wave contact.\nExplaining this to Zarlah, we hurried to the villa, and, as we ascended\nthe steps to the balcony, I beheld a large high-speed aerenoid resting a\nshort distance from mine. This, Zarlah begged me to take, explaining\nthat by rising a few hundred feet above the elevation of small\naerenoids, I could safely exceed the customary speed of local traffic.\nShe explained that her brother had just returned in it from the north,\nwhere he had spent the day in the enjoyment of winter pastimes.\n\nMy heart was too full of the sorrow of parting to be aroused to\nenthusiasm at even such a wonder as this, and, realizing that I would be\nunaccustomed to an aerenoid that was strange to Almos, I decided to\ntrust to the smaller one reaching the observatory in time. But not a\nmoment was to be lost, and, begging Zarlah to be courageous until my\nreturn the following evening, I pressed her to my heart in a last fond\nembrace.\n\nOh! the agony of that moment, as I felt the slender form in my arms\nconvulsed with sobs, while I, struggling frantically with the emotions\nthat tore my heart, whispered words of passionate love; and as at last I\nrose in the night air, condemned by Fate to journey millions of miles\nfrom her I adored, my soul cried out in its anguish:\n\n    \"'Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire\n    To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,\n    Would not we shatter it to bits--and then\n    Re-mould it nearer to our Heart's Desire?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE DISCOVERY AT THE MARTIAN OBSERVATORY.\n\n\nAlthough I well knew the fatal consequences of arriving at the\nobservatory too late, and realized that in this slow travelling aerenoid\nmy chances of covering the five miles in time were but slight, so\ndepressed and desperate was I that I gave the matter little thought.\nIndeed, my mind was entirely occupied with thoughts of Zarlah. Vainly\ndid I search Almos' scientific knowledge for a means of transportation\nover millions of miles of space. All my theories led to but one\nconclusion--that no material transit over such an enormous distance was\npossible. My heart sank within me as I thought how brief my happiness\nhad been. But then came the bewildering realization that an eternity of\nloneliness would not be too much to pay for the unutterable joy which\nnothing could take from me. Raised aloft to the highest pinnacle of\nhappiness, I had been permitted to experience the joy of Zarlah's\nlove--a love that I had thought was for Almos--only to be dashed down\ninto still deeper despair. Then a great anguish filled my heart as I\nrealized that before I was alone in my misery, which, through a\nthoughtless action, I had brought upon myself, but now my agony was\nshared by a loving and trusting heart that had been joined to mine by\nthe decree of Fate.\n\nThe thought of the unhappiness I had brought into Zarlah's life maddened\nme, and when at last the aerenoid rested upon the balcony of the\nobservatory, I stepped out, caring little whether wave contact had\nceased or not. I would enter the virator in any case, and at once fulfil\nmy obligation to Almos, through whose generosity I had been permitted to\nvisit this veritable paradise. Then, if wave contact with Paris still\nexisted my spirit would return to my body which lay there, but if not, I\nfelt that Fate would have thus solved the hopeless tangle into which it\nhad precipitated me.\n\nAs I proceeded across the balcony, I was astonished to observe a\nhigh-speed aerenoid lying close to the one I knew belonged to Almos.\nWhat could it mean! That a visitor would enter the observatory knowing\nAlmos to be absent, I could not conceive, as I was well aware of the\nsanctity of a dwelling in the Martian mind, especially when that\ndwelling was the theatre of such experiments and observations as the\nobservatory conducted by Almos.\n\nGreatly perturbed I turned and entered the building, and, with all\nhaste, proceeded down the corridor. As I reached the porti\u00e8res of the\nlarge room, the sound of someone within moving about caused my heart to\nbeat wildly, and, thrusting aside the curtains, I beheld Reon.\n\nFor a moment I was mute with astonishment, then, as he smilingly\nadvanced with extended hand, I knew instantly that he was present at\nAlmos' request. Without further time for thought, I grasped his hand and\ngreeted him cordially, realizing that no matter what the object of his\nvisit was, it was known to Almos, and under no circumstances must I\nappear surprised. Without waiting to be questioned, Reon offered me a\nslip of paper on which I observed Almos' handwriting.\n\n\"I carefully followed your instructions, Almos, regarding the virator,\nand, half an hour later, I turned off the current of super-radium. I was\njust preparing to leave. You are late in returning, are you not?\"\n\nWhile Reon thus spoke, I had gained time to glance hastily over the\ninstructions that Almos had written upon the slip of paper which I held\nin my hand, and I now replied, with every nerve strung in an effort to\nappear calm:\n\n\"I am, Reon, a whole hour late, and very sorry, indeed, to have kept you\nwaiting so long. But now, my good fellow, you must be off; I will not\ndetain you a moment longer than it takes to thank you for your kindness\nfrom the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nSo saying, I shook his hand warmly, and accompanying him to the balcony,\nwaved him adieu.\n\nThe gratitude which I had thus expressed to Reon, was by no means mere\nacting. My hasty glance at the instructions had convinced me that he had\nbeen the means of saving my life. Without noticing the hour mentioned, I\nhad just time enough, while Reon was speaking, to note that he was\ninstructed to turn on the current from the upper chamber of the\nvirator, and, half an hour later, to shut off the super-radium current.\nI felt that Almos had in this way prepared to save my life, in case I\narrived at the observatory too late to return to Earth. With wonderful\nforethought--perhaps even a premonition of my late return--he had\nrequested Reon to visit the observatory and instructed him what to do at\na certain time, with the result that Almos' spirit had been transferred\nto my body in Paris, before it was lost forever by passing out of wave\ncontact.\n\nHastening to the virator, I now examined it, and found that Reon had\nfaithfully carried out the instructions, although he was unaware that in\nso doing he had saved a life, doubtless thinking that in Almos' absence,\nhe had merely attended to the details of an important experiment.\n\nI felt that I could never repay Almos for all he had undertaken for my\nsafety. The following evening I would enter the virator, and do\nprecisely as Almos had done on previous evenings. When Almos' spirit had\narrived, he would then change the current to an outflowing one, and\ndispatch my spirit to Earth.\n\nAlthough my thoughts of Zarlah had been interrupted by the excitement\nincident to finding Reon at the observatory, I was soon absorbed once\nmore in the subject ever foremost in my mind. With my head resting on my\nhands, I sat hour after hour, endeavoring to conceive some plan--no\nmatter how hazardous--that would result in my being able to remain on\nMars with Zarlah. But the gloom of despair only deepened, and all\nsolutions were perforce dismissed.\n\nAt my feet lay the slip of paper which bore the instructions for Reon.\nMany times during the long hours of deep thought, had my eyes rested\nupon it, only to seek a new object as a new problem confronted me.\nSuddenly, starting to my feet and snatching the paper from the ground, I\nuttered an exclamation of astonishment. For the first time, I noticed\nthe hour at which Reon was to carry out his instructions--_it was three\nhours before the time for my departure_!\n\nAlmos had, then, deliberately planned to take my place on Earth, and in\nreturn to give me his on Mars. How I had been kept in ignorance of these\nplans, I knew not, but, as I stood staring at the paper in my hand, my\nmind gradually comprehended all that Almos had, until now, so\nsuccessfully hidden from me.\n\nImpelled by these strange revelations, I hastened to the sleeping\nchamber, and glanced eagerly around in search of some message that would\nexplain more fully the reason for Almos' departure to Earth. Nor was I\ndisappointed, for upon the couch lay a letter addressed to \"Harold\nLonsdale.\" Almos had naturally supposed that I would retire soon after\nmaking the discovery that he had gone to Earth, and that I would then\nfind the letter which, in this chamber, was safe from Reon's\nobservation.\n\nAs I read the contents my eyes filled with tears of overwhelming\ngratitude, and my heart went out in sincere affection to him who, in\nthis brief message, which was the sacrifice of a strong and noble\ncharacter, offered me his life on Mars with the love that he had known\nwas mine, but which otherwise I could never possess.\n\nPacing the room under the influence of strong emotions, I laid the\nletter down, only to pick it up again and reread its contents carefully.\nNo other man, living on Earth or Mars, could have done as much for me\nas had Almos this night. He had not only saved my life, but had given to\nme the thing that was far dearer. It was a princely gift, and my mind,\ntrained as it had been to the cramped confines of a sordid existence in\na mercenary world, was slow to comprehend the limitless wealth of\nhappiness and love which it bestowed upon me. Sleep was impossible, and\nI longed for the morning, that I might hasten to my beloved, and tell\nher of the happiness that was ours.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE WARNING OF DANGER----THE RACE WITH DEATH.\n\n\nSlowly crept the long tedious hours of darkness. The heavy cloud of\ndespair that had so long hung over me, now being dispelled as if by\nmagic, I was all impatience. My heart yearned for the moment when,\ngazing into the depths of Zarlah's wondrous eyes, I should see\nthere--not the appealing timid look, full of the dread of hopeless\nseparation from her lover, that had so wrung my heart at our last\nparting--but the radiant happiness of perfect contentment and fulfilled\ndesire. I had thrown myself on the couch, and, as a miser jealously\ncounts over his gold, fondling each precious bit with eager fingers, so\nI pondered on the happy hours spent with Zarlah, carefully reviewing\neach golden moment with its precious burden of Love's confessions.\n\nSuddenly I sprang to my feet--a piercing, despairing cry of \"Harold, my\nlove, save me! save me!\" was ringing in my ears.\n\nIt was Zarlah's voice, and some terrible danger confronted her.\n\nRushing into the adjoining room, I glanced anxiously about--all was\nstill. The numerous books and instruments lay just as I had left them,\nand I gradually realized that, tired with the experiences I had lately\nundergone, I had unconsciously fallen asleep, and Zarlah's cry for help\nwas only a dream.\n\nAlthough greatly relieved by this discovery, my mind remained in a state\nof unrest. I was oppressed with a sense of danger which, in spite of my\nendeavor to overcome by occupying my mind with the volumes of Martian\nastronomical discoveries, I found to be impossible. Laying aside the\nbook I had endeavored to read, I started to my feet and paced restlessly\nto and fro, but each footfall, echoing in the profound stillness, seemed\nto be an appealing cry for help. A premonition that a terrible danger\nhung over Zarlah came upon me, and, maddened by the thought that I\nremained inactive, whilst yet I might save her, I rushed out upon the\nbalcony.\n\nThe sun was just rising, but in place of the gray light of dawn on Earth\nwith its beautifully colored eastern sky, there appeared sharp contrasts\nof the blackest darkness and the most brilliant light, in the long\nshadows that were cast across the landscape. Without the diffusion of\nlight which the denser atmosphere of Earth causes, night seemed to\nlinger on the very footsteps of day. Though the remarkable effect of\nthis Martian sunrise would have been pleasing under other circumstances,\nit now served only to increase my apprehension, warning me that I was in\na strange world, and that I must be prepared to meet extraordinary\nemergencies.\n\nI had but one thought, that of reaching Zarlah as speedily as possible\nand saving her from the awful fate which menaced her. What this fate\nwas, I knew not, but I could feel its presence like the hot breath of\nsome ferocious beast, as it stands over its prostrate victim. Greatly\ndid I now deplore the loss of Zarlah's valuable instrument.\n\nWith eager hands I prepared the high-speed aerenoid for the journey,\nfeeling that I must trust to Almos' knowledge of its operation to carry\nme through safely. Though I realized that the danger was increased a\nthousand times in an aerenoid capable of such terrific speed, the fear\nthat even now I might be too late compelled me to make use of it.\n\nTaking my place in the forward part of the car, I was greatly relieved\nto find that my hand instinctively sought the levers, and operated them\nwith a judicious care that could result only from long experience.\n\nRising high enough to avoid small aerenoids, I proceeded at a\nconsiderable speed and soon came within sight of Zarlah's dwelling. The\nserene and peaceful appearance of this beautiful white marble villa, as\nthe morning sun glorified it, quickly dispelled the fears that had\nbrought me hither at such an early hour, and I gladly attributed them to\noverwrought nerves and the loss of a night's sleep.\n\nMoreover, as I slowly circled over the lake that only a few hours before\nZarlah and I had wistfully gazed upon together as we built a world of\nhappiness for ourselves, I felt that I was near to her, should the\ndanger of which I had been forewarned prove real. Here in the scene of\nour happiness I would wait through the early hours--the last hours of\nour separation.\n\nSlowly descending, I brought the aerenoid to rest in a spot obscured by\ntrees from the villa. A few feet away, the little brook sparkled merrily\nin the sunlight as it leaped along on its journey to the lake, and, as I\nopened the door of the car, its joyous song swelled upon the fragrant\nmorning air, laughing at my forebodings in this world of peace, as it\nhad laughed at my despair of the previous night.\n\nAs I stepped out into the warm sunlight and made my way toward the\nlake, a great joy filled my heart. It would not be long ere Zarlah\nshared with me the happiness of the knowledge that we need never again\nbe separated.\n\n\"Poor Zarlah!\" I murmured, as the memory of our last parting with its\ngreat anguish of a forlorn hope sent a pang to my heart. \"The bitterness\nin thy cup was indeed great, but it is past. Oh, my beloved, awake to\nthe light of a new day filled with gladness, and sorrow shall not again\ncross thy path!\"\n\nI paused, fancying I heard footsteps, and, glancing back, listened\nintently. All was still, and I was just about to proceed when again the\nsound came. This time I could not be mistaken; it was the sound of\nhurried footsteps some distance off and in the direction of the villa.\n\nI was still hidden from the villa by the trees, but across the stream,\nsome thirty yards away, was an opening from which a view of it could be\nhad. Leaping the stream I hastened thither, anxious to learn the cause\nof the untimely activity. Another moment, and I should have been too\nlate to see a slight figure, laden with what appeared to be wraps and\nother travelling equipment, hurry across the balcony and step into the\nlarge high-speed aerenoid that I had observed there the previous\nevening.\n\nIt was Zarlah! But what was the reason of this hasty departure at such\nan hour? Suddenly a frenzy seized me, and, rushing toward the villa, I\nfrantically called to her, but it was too late. She had not seen me,\nand, before I had taken many steps, the aerenoid rose rapidly to a great\nheight and disappeared over the trees.\n\nNot a moment was to be lost. Turning, I dashed wildly back toward the\naerenoid I had so foolishly left in concealment. Reaching the stream, I\nstumbled over an entanglement of vines and plunged headlong therein,\nonly to scramble, dripping and bruised, up the opposite bank and\ncontinue my frantic efforts to reach the aerenoid, before Zarlah's car\nhad disappeared from sight. What her intention was I knew not, but the\nearly hour, the haste with which she had departed, and the absence of\nher brother, all conspired to arouse the fears that had beset me during\nthe long hours of the night.\n\nArriving at the aerenoid at last, after a journey that seemed to consume\nhours, I jumped in and closed the door. Frantically I seized the lever\nthat controlled the ascension and, pulling it so that the full repelling\npower was instantly exposed, the car bounded high into the air with\nterrific force.\n\nThe shock hurled me off my feet, but in an instant my eyes were again\nfixed upon a mere speck many miles distant, which I knew to be the\naerenoid containing all that life possessed for me. As the car plunged\nforward at great speed, the speck disappeared, and I at once realized\nthat Zarlah had reached a canal, into which she had turned her aerenoid.\nIt was now impossible for me to see which direction she took, and unless\nI arrived at the canal within a few seconds, I felt that all hope of\novertaking her would have vanished, as she would doubtless proceed at\nfull speed and soon be lost to sight.\n\nOpening to its fullest extent the valve that controlled the exhaustion\nof air in the chamber beneath, the velocity of the car soon became\nterrific, and, rising still higher as I sped along, I caught sight of\nZarlah's aerenoid proceeding in a northerly direction.\n\nWith a disregard for all safety I swerved to the north, thus forming the\nthird side of a triangle, of which the other sides were the course\nZarlah had taken. This movement reduced the distance between the two\naerenoids considerably, and upon turning into the speedway of the canal,\nI was greatly relieved to find that I was but a few miles in the rear.\nThe hope that Zarlah might see the car speeding so close behind her,\nflashed through my mind, but instantly I realized the impossibility of\nsuch a thing, for a glance behind, even for a second, while travelling\nwith such frightful velocity, would entail certain destruction by being\ndashed to pieces against the sides of the canal. My only chance lay in\novertaking her and making some signal, and with my free hand I wrenched\nat the speed valve, endeavoring to open it wider.\n\nOn we sped in our wild career over the planet's surface. Hundreds of\nmiles were quickly swept beneath us, but not one foot did I seem to\ngain. Vainly did I strive to put from my mind the fears that lurked\nthere, by seeking a plausible reason for Zarlah's strange action.\n\nOn, on we flew, each aerenoid going at its maximum speed; surely Zarlah\nhad gone far enough north; she must slacken her speed soon to turn down\na branch canal, and I would then be able to run alongside of her car and\nsignal my presence. There was a gleam of hope in this, and to it I clung\nlike a drowning man to a straw.\n\nThe air in the car, which had steadily grown colder, was now biting in\nits sharpness, and as I clutched the steering apparatus with numbed\nhands, a white object loomed up in the distance and in a second flew\nbeneath me--another came, then another, and another, and as they\nappeared in greater numbers, I observed that they were huge blocks of\nice. The sight filled me with grave apprehension. It was now impossible\nto stop our terrific momentum, yet in spite of this great danger, on and\non we sped, still farther north.\n\nWhat could be the reason for this perilous journey? Did Zarlah not\nrealize the danger to which she was exposed, rushing thus madly into the\nwilds of the North--the region of the Repelling Pole--without the means\nof stopping?\n\nSuddenly I shrank in horror as a fearful thought entered my mind. My\nsenses reeled, and a strange sensation swept over me, as of an awful\nPresence in the car with me. \"No, no,\" I muttered between clenched\nteeth; \"it cannot be! She surely realizes that it would be going to a\ncertain and terrible death!\" And as I frantically wrenched at the valve\nin an effort to get more speed, a strange hollow voice echoed through my\nbrain, laughing at my unutterable agony, and crying with fiendish glee,\n\"Your love has no thought of stopping; she hastens to her bridegroom,\nDeath!\"\n\nAs hot irons scorching the living flesh, the words burned into my\nbrain, setting it on fire. It was the voice of Death--which voice no\nliving mortal can mistake--and I recognized it also as the fury of the\nstorm which was abroad when I departed from Earth, and the echo of the\nstream's song of peace in the midst of danger. Had Death thus followed\nme from the world in which he thrived to wreak this vengeance upon me,\nby tempting my bride into his arms, believing that she hastened to her\nlove?\n\nOn, on we rushed into the region of the dreaded Pole. All signs of the\ncanal had disappeared, and before us lay only a vast uninhabitable field\nof ice. I stood at the levers, frozen rigid with the intense cold, but\nwith my eyes ever on the flying object before me, while visions of my\nbeloved one, now so close to death, passed rapidly through my fevered\nbrain. As if Death had thus planned to torture me, before tearing my\nloved one from my very arms, I seemed to stand impersonally apart and\nwatch two lovers--Zarlah and myself. Bending over her, I tried to\nconsole her with a false hope--a story of impossible fulfillment. I\nsucceeded; and now I saw that I had laid the trap which Death had\nplaced in my hands to draw her toward him, and, with a cry of horror, I\ntried to wrench my hand from the lever to which it was frozen, so that I\nmight shut such a scene from my sight--\n\nI realized the meaning of it all now. Zarlah, unable to obtain the\nrepelling force necessary to carry her off Mars, was rushing toward the\nRepelling Pole to be hurled off the planet, risking all in the hope of\nbeing drawn to Earth, which was in opposition. It was a vain hope--alas,\nI knew this too well. She was rushing to her death--a death that I had\nlured her to, and my hands would be stained with the blood of my\nbeloved.\n\nDesperately I wrenched at my frozen hands to free them from the metal to\nwhich they adhered, with a wild idea of smashing the window and calling\nloudly to Zarlah. The skin tore from the flesh like paper at the fury of\nmy efforts, and I freed my hands at last, only to find that my arms hung\nlifeless at my side.\n\nIn a frenzy of grief and despair at my utter helplessness, I fell on my\nknees, crying aloud, \"Oh, my God! Save her from this awful death!\"\n\nA sudden gloom filled the car, and, struggling to my feet, I found that\nwe had entered the belt of semi-darkness that covers the polar caps in\ntheir winter season. Our doom was near at hand--nothing could save\nZarlah now, and only by swerving my car around instantly and returning\ncould I preserve myself. But life was nought to me without Zarlah--I\npreferred death to such an empty existence. Condemned by Fate to be\nseparated in life, we would meet death together.\n\nI could dimly see Zarlah's car outlined against the white snow beyond,\nbut, even as I stood now helplessly and silently awaiting the end, a\ndark line rapidly spread over this field of white. Beyond, all was\nblack, and as this sharp-cut boundary line rapidly approached Zarlah's\ncar, my blood froze in my veins, for in this vast area of bare black\nrock I recognized the terrible power of the North Repelling Pole. There\nwas another moment in which my heart refused to beat, then a groan of\ngreat anguish escaped my lips, as Zarlah's car was hurled upwards into\nspace with frightful velocity.\n\nShutting my eyes I awaited death. For an instant it seemed to me that I\nheard Zarlah's voice call to me in clear accents, then came a terrific\nshock which hurled me to the far end of the aerenoid, amid a confusion\nof furniture, books, and instruments that had been torn from their\nfastenings. Frozen into a state of utter helplessness, my senses fast\nleaving me, I lay unable to extricate myself from the heavy mass.\n\nIn this comatose condition I remained totally ignorant of the lapse of\ntime, until, feeling the terrible pressure diminish, I opened my eyes\nand dreamily beheld the heavy instruments and pieces of furniture move\ngently away, and bump against one another as they floated lightly about\nwithin the car.\n\nRelieved of the great weight, I now breathed more freely. My senses grew\nclearer, and soon I became conscious of a loud hissing noise close at\nhand. Drowsily I turned my head in the direction of the sound, and\ndiscovered that it came from the door in the side of the aerenoid. In an\ninstant the full faculty of my senses returned, as with intense horror I\nrealized the cause--the air of the car was escaping into the void of the\nuniverse without! Desperately I struggled to gain my feet, but being\nwithout weight, the effort resulted only in my drifting helplessly about\nthe car, until, gasping for air, I realized that the end had come.\n\nA moment's consciousness of being drawn gently to the floor of the car\nagain, while the furniture and other articles that had been drifting\nabout piled lightly upon me without any perceptible weight; a slight\nshock, then, as the suffocating sensation became more intense, a\nblackness rushed in upon me, and my senses reeled--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE END OF A PERILOUS JOURNEY.\n\n\nA tall, gaunt figure, swathed in black robes, Stood waiting some\ndistance from me. I knew that it was Death, for under the hood I beheld\nthe grinning skull with its sightless eye-holes, and I turned away in\nloathsome dread. But even as I did so, the bony arms were stretched out\nin welcome, and to them ran a slight girlish form--it was Zarlah! For a\nmoment I stood paralyzed with horror, then rushing toward the now\nretreating figures, I called out wildly, \"Zarlah! Zarlah! Flee not with\nDeath! I am here--your Harold is here!\" Suddenly I was seized from\nbehind; instantly my strength seemed to be sapped from me and I fell\nback exhausted, crying in my despair, \"Oh, my God! save her! save her!\"\n\nA cool, soft hand was laid upon my burning brow, and a sweet voice\ngently murmured, \"Poor Harold! If you could only know that God in His\nmercy has saved us both!\"\n\nIt was the voice of the living, not the dead, and slowly the words\nformed a meaning in my confused brain, dragging me from the depths of\nunconsciousness to the life that still existed about me, warmed as it\nwas by the wondrous power of a woman's love. Opening my eyes I beheld\nZarlah bending over me, her beautiful face full of compassionate love.\nIt seemed as though in a dream my loved one had come to me, and for a\nmoment I lay peacefully gazing into her face, feeling neither curiosity\nnor alarm. Then, as my mind awoke to a realization of all that had\ntranspired, a sudden bewilderment came upon me, and, clasping the hand\nthat sought to ease my head, lest the vision should vanish, I cried:\n\n\"Zarlah, my beloved, speak to me! Are we by a miracle saved from the\ndeath that had engulfed us, or is this the strange meeting of our souls\nafter death?\"\n\nAt the sound of my voice, Zarlah clasped her hands in a fervent prayer\nof thankfulness, then, burying her face on my shoulder, gave way to a\nflood of tears.\n\n\"Oh, Harold, my love!\" she sobbed. \"Thank God, you have been spared to\nme! It is indeed by a miracle that this moon, intercepting our aerenoids\nin their wild flight through space, thus brought us together at the\neleventh hour, and laid you helpless and dying at my feet.\"\n\n\"The _moon_!\" I gasped, raising myself and staring out of the window at\nmy side in astonishment, as my mind gradually comprehended our\nhairbreadth escape from death.\n\nA blazing orb of fire, shining from the intense blackness around it, was\nall that met my gaze, and I sank back, exhausted with the effort, into\nthe arms that awaited me.\n\n\"Tell me more, darling,\" I said, as a great happiness came over me, and\nmy heart was filled with the simple desire to hear the gentle voice I\nloved. What mattered it to me whether we ever reached Mars or not? The\nfuture held no fears for me now; enough that I had Zarlah, for the walls\nof the aerenoid that surrounded us seemed to compass the whole universe.\n\n\"Ah, my love!\" sighed Zarlah, bending over me and nervously clasping my\nhands in hers, \"now that the danger is past and you are restored to me,\nthe long hours of agony seem like a dream. But, oh, the anguish of that\nmoment when I beheld another aerenoid lying close to mine, upon the\nsurface of the moon that had intercepted my journey to Earth! My soul\ncried out that in it lay my beloved, suffocating to death. Who else\nwould have followed me over the dreaded Pole! With wild haste I attached\nan oxygen respirator to my mouth, and, releasing the air from the car,\nsprang out upon the surface, little suspecting the danger that lurked\nthere. But so small is the force of gravity upon this moon that I was\nwithout perceptible weight, and the tendency to rise with every step I\ntook filled me with terror, and I crept upon my hands and knees to the\naerenoid which lay a few yards away. Opening the door, I found you lying\napparently lifeless upon the floor. My heart told me that it was my love\nwho lay within Death's grasp, and, desperate at the thought that you had\nbeen so near to me, only to be torn away by the hand of Death, I lifted\nyou up and hastened with you back to the aerenoid I had left. The small\namount of gravity now aided me, and I carried you without feeling the\nburden.\n\n\"Filling the car with oxygen and applying regenerating rays, I waited\nfor a sign of life. Oh, the agony of those moments, as in despair I\nfrantically called your name! At last the sign came--a quiver of the\nlips, a faint breath--and I knew there was hope. Gradually your\nbreathing became stronger, but a terrible fever raged within you.\nThrough long, long hours on this strange globe I knelt beside you,\nlistening to your piercing cries of delirium, as you lived that awful\nexperience over and over again. Little by little, in the cries of agony\nthat rent my heart, I learned how you had come to me a moment too late;\nhow you had followed my aerenoid, and, being unable to stop me, had\nrushed to the fate that was mine, to be hurled into space, unprepared\nfor such a journey; how you had suffocated, and--oh! my love, as you lay\nthrough the long hours, gazing at me with wild unseeing eyes--ever\ncalling my name--imploring me not to rush to my death--I at last\ndespaired of your life, and my soul prepared itself to fly with yours to\nthe life beyond, leaving our bodies clasped in each other's arms, to\ncircle round the world which had denied us our love until the end of\ntime!\n\n\"But suddenly the light of reason came into your eyes--your voice lost\nits wild accents, and I knew that you had been restored to me. In a few\nhours now, Harold, the rays will have completed their work, and you will\nbe in full possession of your former strength.\"\n\nWhat a happy future we now looked out upon! The danger of our position\nupon a heavenly body but a few miles in diameter, with barely enough\ngravity to hold us on its surface, was forgotten in the great joy of\nbeing together and feeling that we should never again be parted.\n\nI related to Zarlah all that had happened since I had left her; how I\nhad encountered Reon at the observatory and learned of Almos' departure\nto Earth, and how I had later discovered the letter in which Almos gave\nto us the great happiness we had despaired of ever possessing. And now\nthe fast encroaching darkness warned us of the approach of a lunar\nnight. As darkness with us would necessarily mean daylight on that part\nof Mars to which we had come opposite in our journey round the planet, I\nfelt that now had arrived the time for action, as Mars would become\nvisible. Moreover, as the days and nights of this rapidly moving\nsatellite were but three and a half hours in duration, I realized that\nno time should be lost in making the necessary preparations for our\nhazardous journey. But although I was now able to get on my feet and had\nthe use of my arms, I had not by any means regained all my strength, and\nupon laying my plans before Zarlah, she urged me not to undertake such a\njourney until the rays had fully restored me. Therefore it was decided\nto postpone our attempt to reach Mars until the following night.\n\nBut soon a strange and unforeseen incident warned us of the great danger\nto which we were exposed on the surface of this diminutive moon, and\nleft us no alternative but immediate departure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nHURLED FROM THE MOON.\n\n\nTogether we stood gazing in silence out into the abyss over the small\nsurface of the moon that was visible to us, oppressed with a sense of\nawe as the sun dropped from sight, leaving us plunged in darkness.\n\nSuddenly there appeared from out of the inky blackness of the heavens a\nhuge crescent, stretching across the sky far above us. The sight of it\nfascinated us, and, as we stood lost in admiration at the majestic\nproportions of the beautiful arch of light, ever growing in width, we\ngradually realized that it was the sun-tipped rim of the planet which\nour moon was journeying around--the world from which we had been hurled\nand to which we must return.\n\nA sense of great reverence overpowered me; I realized that we looked\nupon sights, and felt great forces never before bared to mortals.\nThrough my mind ran lines of Addison's ode:\n\n    \"The spacious firmament on high\n    With all the blue ethereal sky,\n    And spangled heavens, a shining frame,\n    Their great _Original_ proclaim.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Forever singing as they shine\n    The hand that made us is divine.\"\n\nSlowly the light crept over the planet's surface until the huge\nilluminated sphere, almost filling the entire heavens, made a scene of\nthe most exquisite grandeur that human eyes have ever beheld.\n\n\"Dearest!\" I exclaimed, with sudden impulse, as a most remarkable and\nterrifying fact occurred to me, \"wonderful though our deliverance from\ndeath seems to us, it is even more miraculous than we had any conception\nof! To meet with this moon in our journey through space, we must have\ndescribed an arc, as this satellite never passes over the pole.\"\n\n\"How can such a thing be possible?\" returned Zarlah, in tremulous\naccents, drawing closer to me as the awfulness of our narrow escape\nappalled her.\n\n\"Ah, my love, we may never know that!\" I answered. \"The Great Creator of\nall these wonders has, indeed, guided us to this haven in our wild\nflight through space. We can but theorize that the pole, being several\nmiles in diameter, hurled us from its edge, the tremendous repelling\nforce not permitting our aerenoids to proceed over its surface. The\nrotary motion of the planet upon its axis would then cause us to\ndescribe a curve in our flight from its surface, as only in the center\nof the pole would this rotary motion lose its effect.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harold,\" whispered Zarlah, timidly, when I had finished speaking,\n\"the thought of these terrible things and the sight of this immense\nglobe hanging over us fill me with dread! Do you think we shall ever\nreach our world again? It appears to be so near and yet is so far away\nfrom us. What veritable atoms we are in the glory of this tumultuous\nwhirl!\"\n\n\"I do not think we could possibly miss it, sweetheart,\" I answered,\ncheerfully, as I placed my arm about her and drew her away from the\nwindow which commanded a view of Mars. \"Come, let us look out upon the\nlittle globe that supports us; we are entirely missing the beautiful\neffect of this grand reflection of light\"\n\nThe surface of the moon was now bathed in a beautiful diffused light,\nand our surroundings where once more visible. Indeed, many objects,\nwhich we had been unable to see in the dazzling brilliancy of the sun's\nlight, as it blazed forth from a heaven unsoftened by any atmosphere,\nwere now clearly revealed. We had approached a window and were looking\nat these new objects of interest, when Zarlah suddenly cried in dismay:\n\"Look, Harold, look! The other aerenoid is moving!\"\n\nQuickly turning my gaze in the direction indicated, I saw the aerenoid\nin which I had made the journey from Mars move a space of several yards\nwith a jerky motion, then, to my intense horror, glide off the surface\nof the moon into space. At the same instant, the car in which we stood\nrocked as though about to turn over upon its side.\n\nNot a moment was to be lost! Some unknown force was exerting its\ninfluence over the movable objects on the moon's surface. What this\npower was I knew not, but the direction in which the aerenoid had\nglided proved it to be other than Mars. Our position was now perilous in\nthe extreme, for were we suddenly to glide off into space we would\nundoubtedly be lost, as it was necessary to have air surrounding us in\norder to propel the car. Without an atmosphere we would therefore be\nhelpless and entirely at the mercy of the unknown and mysterious power.\nIndeed, it was evident that only our increased weight had saved us from\nimmediately following the other aerenoid, and I felt that at any moment\nwe might do so. Although lacking the power of propulsion, my hope was\nthat our repelling force, which I knew must be increased to an enormous\nextent by the slight gravity on the moon's surface, would hurl us off\nthat satellite straight upward into the influence of Mars' gravity.\n\nSeizing the lever, I cried to Zarlah to He on the floor of the car, but\neven as she did so, the aerenoid rocked again with still greater\nviolence--in another moment it would be too late! Thrusting the lever\nover, I exposed the full repelling force to the moon's surface. The\nshock hurled me to the floor, and so terrific was the force with which\nwe shot upward, that I was held powerless to move hand or foot. For a\nspace of time which seemed to me hours I was obliged to remain thus,\ncontenting myself with calling words of encouragement to my dear one,\nwhom I greatly feared must have suffered severely from the awful shock.\nAt last, finding that I could rise, I hastened to her side, and, to my\ngreat relief, discovered that she had entirely escaped injury.\n\nAs it was impossible in any way to control the aerenoid speeding upward\nthrough space, it was useless for me to stand by the levers, and,\nassisting Zarlah to rise, we approached a window in the roof of the car\nand glanced upward at the planet to which we were rushing. A remarkable\nphenomenon met our eyes! Mars appeared to be no longer a sphere--the\ngreat globe that we had beheld from the moon--but instead a huge dome,\nwhich hung over us, ever deepening in the center as we rushed up toward\nit. Inconceivable though it seemed, I knew that, to produce such an\neffect, we must already have covered more than half the distance\nbetween the two bodies. Upward we shot, and although there was no means\nof ascertaining how fast we were travelling, I knew by the rapidly\nchanging appearance of the dome above us that our speed must be\nterrific.\n\nWe had steadily grown lighter, and now we discovered that we were\nentirely without weight, and that it required some effort to keep our\nfeet on the floor of the car.\n\nStill upward we rushed into the center of the dome which now stretched\ndown and encircled us on all sides like an immense umbrella, when\nsuddenly, without the slightest perceptible movement of the car, the\ndome appeared to swing around until it lay beneath us, and instantly we\nfelt our feet settling upon the floor of the car.\n\n\"We are safe from the unknown power now, dearest!\" I exclaimed,\nanxiously examining the lever that controlled the descent, to make sure\nthat the repelling metal was fully exposed. \"We are dropping upon Mars,\nand our repelling metal should soon check our speed.\"\n\n\"Oh, Harold, my love,\" sighed Zarlah, timidly clinging to me, her eyes\nfilled with tears, and a look of great yearning coming into them, \"my\nheart despairs at the dangers that encompass us! With you as my goal I\nknew no fear; but now that I have you, I am a coward. Is our love\nforbidden, that we should be thus pursued by these terrible dangers?\"\n\n\"Courage, dearest!\" I replied, reassuringly. \"We shall soon be safe, and\nthen nothing shall interrupt the happiness for which we have endured so\nmuch.\"\n\nI hid from her the anxiety that lurked near my heart, and endeavored to\ninterest her by advancing several theories upon the phenomenal\nappearance of the planet's surface.\n\nLike a huge cup the land now stretched up and around us, but we were\nstill descending with frightful velocity. I had noticed that the air in\nthe car was becoming warmer, and now, filled with apprehension, I\nstretched out my hand and touched the wall. Instantly I withdrew it--the\nwall was hot! Like a flash the full realization of our terrible danger\nburst upon me. I had relied upon the repelling metal to check our\ndescent before we entered the region of air, and had supposed that we\nwould float lightly to the ground under perfect control. But now I saw\nhow foolishly I had erred, in omitting to take into consideration the\nterrific momentum we would attain in our journey of six thousand miles\nthrough space. This momentum was now driving us to the ground, in spite\nof our strong repelling force, and with such a frightful speed that heat\nwas being generated by friction with the air as we rushed through it.\nThe creaking and straining sound coming from the bottom of the aerenoid\nwas evidence of the fight the repelling metal was making to overcome\nthis momentum before the surface of Mars was reached, but I shuddered as\nI realized what little effect it had upon this gigantic force.\n\nIn a few seconds the air became unbearably hot, and, with a gasp, Zarlah\nlay limp in my arms, as she turned her face to me to speak. Laying her\ntenderly upon the floor, I hastily wrapped wet blankets around her, and,\ndashing water over myself, I staggered across the car to the window\nagain. We were still descending rapidly, but, as I felt the walls of the\ncar, I found that they were now cooler, proving that our terrific speed\nhad been reduced. The increased pressure of my feet upon the floor of\nthe car was also evidence that our descent was being steadily checked.\nA wild hope surged within me that the repelling metal would overcome the\nmomentum in time to save us from destruction.\n\nGlancing down, I saw white specks lying far beneath us. My heart stood\nstill as I realized that these were buildings. We could not be more than\na few miles from the surface, yet down, down we sped. A few moments more\nand the buildings became plainly visible, and my heart thumped wildly,\nas they seemed to rush up to meet us. We would be dashed to pieces! The\nrepelling force could not possibly stop us in time! Turning, in despair,\nI threw myself down beside Zarlah, and enfolded her in a last embrace.\n\nInstantly there was a terrific shock--a deafening crash. Then all was\ndark, while a flood of water came pouring in upon us. I staggered to my\nfeet with Zarlah in my arms, only to be thrown to the floor again by an\nupward bound of the aerenoid. Sunlight once more filled the car, and, as\nI struggled to my feet, a cool breeze wafted in through the shattered\nwindows. To what further extremes of temperature and mediums were we to\nbe subjected?\n\nI was still too dazed by the shock to realize how we had escaped from a\ndeath that seemed inevitable, but I knew that we were flying upward with\nthe full force of our repelling metal. Tenderly lifting Zarlah to a\nsafer and more comfortable place, I seized the lever and gradually\ndecreased the repelling power, until we rested motionless in the air.\n\nWe had already attained a considerable height, and, as I eagerly gazed\ndown, I beheld far beneath us the glistening surface of a lake. With a\ngasp of horror, I realized what a narrow escape had been ours. Into this\nlake we had plunged with a velocity sufficient to have dashed us to\npieces had we struck the ground; the damage which the car had sustained\nupon striking the water was evidence of this. Our descent being stopped,\nthe repelling metal, which was fully exposed, had then sent us bounding\ninto the air again, and in all probability had thus saved us from being\ndrowned beneath the waters of the lake.\n\nDeath had indeed been close to us many times during our strange\nadventure, and now that all the dangers were past, I breathed a\nheartfelt prayer of thankfulness for our safe deliverance.\n\nFreeing Zarlah from the wet blankets I had wrapped around her during\nthe intense heat, I gazed anxiously down upon the beautiful, unconscious\nface.\n\n\"My love! my love!\" I murmured, passionately. \"How much you have\nrisked--how much you have suffered for my sake! Oh, cruel the fate that\nthus delays our happiness!\"\n\nThe sun was setting, and I now realized the importance of descending\nnearer to the ground, that I might ascertain our whereabouts, as from\nour present altitude, even with Almos' knowledge of Mars, I was unable\nto recognize any familiar landmark, and I knew that darkness would soon\nbe upon us.\n\nBending once again over the form of my loved one, I tenderly kissed the\nsilent lips, but as I did so, her arms closed about my neck, and\ndreamily opening her eyes, she smiled up at me as a child awakening from\na peaceful sleep.\n\n\"We are safe now, darling, all the danger is past!\" I murmured, and\nfalling on my knees beside her, I took her up into my arms, with the\nprayer that I might ever shield her in the days to come.\n\nThe shadows lengthened; quickly the gloom gathered, and darkness closed\nin upon us, but still we remained suspended in the cool night air under\nthe dome of the starry heavens, unmindful of all in the joy of our great\nlove; for with the fulfillment of our hearts' long cherished desire,\ncame the realization that our journey was ended.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPARIS, February 17, 19--.\n\nSix months have elapsed since that memorable evening when Harold and\nZarlah--radiant with their new-found happiness--were portrayed upon the\ninstrument in Paris at which I anxiously waited, after having exchanged\nmy existence on Mars for one on Earth. The account of his strange\nadventures, which Harold has since given me, I have endeavored to record\nin the foregoing pages, as nearly as possible in his own words, trusting\nthat this narration of the events connected with the opening of\ncommunication between Earth and Mars will prepare the way for the\ngreater developments soon to be announced by scientists.\n\nALMOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Zarlah the Martian, by R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
