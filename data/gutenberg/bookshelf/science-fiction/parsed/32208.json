Only the Captain knew of its danger!\n\n\nThe _Star Lord_ waited, poised for her maiden voyage. The gigantic\nsilvery spindle, still cradled in its scaffoldings, towered upwards\nagainst the artificial sky of Satellite Y.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe passengers were beginning to come on board before Captain Josiah\nEvans had finished checking the reports of his responsible officers. The\nship was ready for space, now, and there was nothing more he could do\nuntil takeoff. With long, deliberate steps he walked to his cabin,\nclosed the door, and in the privacy he had come to regard as the\ngreatest luxury life had to offer him, he sank into his chair and\nreached for the post-bag which had been delivered by the morning's\nrocket ferry from earth.\n\nThere were no personal letters for him. He rarely received any and never\nreally expected any, for his career had always been more important to\nhim than personal ties. Shoving aside the official documents, he picked\nup the small brown parcel, slit the pliofilm covering with his pocket\nknife, and inspected the red leather cover with its simple title: _Ley's\nRockets and Space Ships._ At the bottom of the cover was a date: May 1,\n2421, Volume 456. In the nearly five hundred years since the publication\nof Volume one, which listed all the earth's rocket ships on half of one\npage, the annual edition of this book, regularly edited and brought up\nto date, had become the spaceman's bible.\n\nCaptain Evans was annoyed to find that his hands were shaking as he\nleafed through the pages, and he paused a few seconds, trying to control\nhis excitement. His black hair had begun to turn gray above his ears,\nand there were a few white hairs in his bushy eyebrows. But a healthy\npink glowed under the skin of his well-fleshed cheeks, and the jut of\nhis chin showed the confidence of one used to receiving immediate,\nunquestioning obedience. When his long fingers had stopped their\ntrembling, he found the entry he had been looking for, and a triumphant\nsmile lighted his heavy features as he settled deeper in his chair and\nread the first paragraph.\n\n\"_Star Lord: newest model in space-ships of the famed Star Line. Vital\nStatistics: Construction begun February 2418, on Satellite Y.\nChristened, October, 2420. Maiden voyage to Almazin III scheduled\nspring, 2421._\"\n\nHe looked up at the diagram of the ship which hung on the wall at his\nright, then glanced at the zodiometer on his desk. May 3, late spring.\n\n\"_Powered by twenty-four total conversion Piles. Passenger capacity\n1250. Crew and maintenance 250. Six life boats, capacity 1500. Captain.\nJosiah Evans._\"\n\nHis throat swelling, he was almost choked with pride as he read the\nfinal Statistic. This, he thought was the climax of his career, the\nplace he had been working towards all his life. It had been a long road\nfrom his lonely boyhood in a Kansas orphanage, to Captain of the earth's\nfinest spaceship.\n\nThe _Star Lord_ was the perfection of modern space craft, the creation\nof the earth's most skilled designers and builders, the largest ship\never launched. Protected by every safety device the ingenuity of man had\nbeen able to contrive, she was a palace to glide among the stars.\n\nHis heart beat more rapidly as he read the next section.\n\n\"_Prediction: her maiden voyage will break all previous speed records,\nand regain for her backers the coveted Blue Ribbon, lost ten years ago\nto the Light Lines._\"\n\nNo question of that, he thought. No faster ship had ever been built. But\nhe frowned as he read the final paragraph:\n\n\"_Sidelights: Reviving a long obsolete custom, certain astrologers in\nLondon have cast the horoscope of the Star Lord and pronounced the\nauguries to be unfavorable. This verdict, plus the incident at the\nchristening, has caused some head-shaking among the superstitious\nfringe, and some twittering about 'cosmic arrogance'. But few of the\nlords of the earth, we imagine, will therefore feel impelled to cancel\ntheir passages on this veritable Lord of the Stars._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvans remembered that christening. High in the scaffolding he had stood\non the platform with the christening party: the Secretary of\nInterstellar Commerce, the Ambassador from Almazin III, the Governor of\nSatellite Y, and President and Mrs. Laurier of Earth.\n\nSwaying gently in the still air, the traditional bottle of champagne\nhung before them, suspended at the end of a long ribbon. Mrs. Laurier's\neyes were shining, her cheeks flushed, as she looked at her husband for\na signal. At his smile and nod she had said in a high clear voice, \"I\nchristen thee _Star Lord_!\" and then reached out to grasp the bottle.\nBefore she could touch it, somewhere above them the slender ribbon\nbroke.\n\nThe bottle fell like a stone, plummeted straight down and crashed into a\nmillion fragments on the floor of the satellite.\n\nAn instant's shocked silence, and then a roar of voices surged up from\nthe crowds watching below. Mrs. Laurier had put her hand to her mouth,\nand shivered.\n\n\"What a dreadful thing!\" she whispered. \"Does that mean bad luck?\"\n\nPresident Laurier had frowned at her, but the Secretary of Interstellar\nCommerce had laughed.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Laurier. There is no such thing as luck. Even\nwithout a bath of champagne, this magnificent vessel will prove that man\nis certainly master of the universe. She begins her life well and truly\nnamed.\"\n\nThe Star Line ought to abandon that silly custom of christening a new\nship, thought Captain Evans. It was an archaic ceremony, utterly\nirrational, a foolish relic of a primitive world in which people had\nbeen so uncertain of their machines that they had had to depend on luck,\nand to beg good fortune of unpredictable gods.\n\nTaking up _Ley's Space Ships_ again, he began fondly to reread the page,\nwhen there was a knock at the door and a crewman entered.\n\n\"Mr. Jasperson to see you, sir.\"\n\nThe Captain stared, a tiny muscle in his cheek quivering.\n\n\"You know I'm not to be disturbed until after takeoff, Stacey.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But Mr. Jasperson insisted. He says he knows those rules\ndon't apply to _him_.\"\n\nEvans closed the book, laid it on his desk, and stood up. He leaned\nforward and spoke softly.\n\n\"Tell Mr. Jasperson--\"\n\n\"Tell him what, Josiah?\" boomed a voice from the opening door. \"You can\ntell me yourself now.\"\n\nBurl Jasperson was a portly little man with legs too short for his\nbulging body, and clothes that were too tight. His head was bald except\nfor a fringe above the ears, and he might have been a comical figure but\nfor the icy blue eyes that probed from under the dome of his forehead.\n\n\"What have you got to tell me? You're quite right not to let the ragtag\nand bobtail bother you at a time like this, but I know your old friend\nBurl Jasperson is always welcome.\"\n\nWith scarcely a pause, the Captain extended his hand.\n\n\"How are you, Burl? Won't you come in? I hope the Purser has taken care\nof you properly?\"\n\n\"I'm comfortable enough, thanks, and I'm looking forward to the trip.\nIt's odd, come to think of it, that though I've been Chairman of the\nboard of directors, and have spent some thirty years managing a fleet of\nspace liners, yet I've never before made a trip myself. I don't like\ncrowds of people, for one thing, and then I've been busy.\"\n\n\"What made you decide to go along on this one?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReaching across the table, Jasperson picked up the silver carafe and\npoured himself a glass of water.\n\n\"Ah! Nothing like a drink of cold water! The fact is, I wanted to check\nup on things, make notes of possible improvements in the Star Line's\nservice, and sample passenger reactions. Then too, I'll have the\nsatisfaction of being present on the trip which will establish the\nLine's supremacy, once and for all. This crossing will make history. It\nmeans everything to us, Josiah. You know we're counting on you to break\nthe record. We want to win back the Blue Ribbon, and we expect you to\nmanage it for us.\"\n\n\"I shall do my best.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit I like to see. Full speed ahead!\"\n\n\"Certainly--consistent with safety.\"\n\n\"Consistent with _reasonable_ safety, of course. I know you won't let\nyourself be taken in by all this nonsense about the imaginary dangers of\nhyperspace.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"All this nonsense about the Thakura Ripples! But then, of course\nyou're a sensible man or we wouldn't have hired you, and I'm sure you\nagree with me that the _Star Lord_ can deal with anything that\nhyperspace has to offer.\"\n\nJasperson adjusted the set of his jacket over his plump stomach while he\nwaited for an answer, and Captain Evans stared at him.\n\n\"Is that why you're wearing a pistol?\" he said dryly. \"To help the ship\nfight her battles?\"\n\n\"This?\" His face reddened as he patted his bulging pockets. \"Oh, it's\njust a habit. I don't like being without protection; I always wear a gun\nin one pocket and my recorder in the other.\"\n\n\"You'll scarcely be in any danger on the ship, Burl. Better leave it in\nyour cabin.\"\n\n\"All right. But about the Ripples--you aren't going to take them\nseriously, are you?\"\n\n\"I wish you'd be a little more frank, Mr. Chairman. Has the Star Line\nsuddenly lost confidence in me?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing of the sort! We've every confidence in you, of course.\nBut I've been hearing rumors, hints that we may have to make a slow\ncrossing, and I've been wondering. But then, I'm sure that a man of your\nintelligence doesn't take the Ripples any more seriously than I do.\"\n\n\"I don't know what gossip you have been hearing,\" said the Captain,\nhesitantly. \"'Ripples' is probably a very inaccurate and inadequate name\nfor the phenomenon. Thakura might equally well have called them rapids,\nfalls, bumps, spaces, holes, or discontinuities.\"\n\n\"Then why did he choose to call them Ripples?\"\n\n\"Probably because he didn't know exactly what they are. The whole\nproblem is a very complicated one.\"\n\n\"Complicated nonsense, I call it. Well, we won't quarrel, my dear\nJosiah, but don't let them hold us back. Remember, we're out to break\nall records!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the artificial sky, crowds of people streamed into the\nadministration building of Satellite Y. The jumping-off place for all\nrockets and ships going to and from the stars, Y-port was a world of its\nown, dedicated to only one purpose, the launching and berthing of ships.\n\nIt was a quiet and orderly place as a rule, and its small permanent\ncolony of workmen and officials lived a spartan existence except for\ntheir yearly vacations on Earth. But today it seemed as if half the\nearth's people, friends and relatives of the passengers, had chosen to\nmake the port a holiday spot of their own, to help celebrate the\nlaunching of the _Star Lord_ on her maiden voyage. The rocket ferry\nbetween Y-port and Earth had had to triple its number of runs in the\npast week, and this morning's rocket had brought in the last of the\npassengers for Almazin III.\n\nAlan Chase trudged wearily along with the crowd entering the building,\ntrying to close his ears to the hundreds of chattering voices. He was\ntall and very thin, and his white skin clothed his bones like brittle\npaper. Walking was an effort, and he tried to move with an even step so\nhe would not have to gasp for breath as he moved slowly forward with the\nline before the Customs desk. In his weakness, the gaiety around him\nseemed artificial, and the noise of voices was unendurable.\n\nJust ahead of him in line was a young man in an obviously new suit; the\npretty girl holding to his arm still had a few grains of rice shining in\nher hair.\n\n\"That will be all,\" said the Inspector. \"I hope you and Mrs. Hall have a\nvery happy honeymoon. Next!\"\n\nHe gritted his teeth to stop his trembling as the Inspector reached for\nthe passport, glanced at a notation, then looked up.\n\n\"I'll have to ask you to step in and see Dr. Willoughby, our ship's\ndoctor. It will only take a moment, Dr. Chase.\"\n\n\"But I'm not infectious!\"\n\n\"But there seems to be some question of fitness. In cases like yours the\nStar Line likes to have a final check, just to make sure you'll be able\nto stand the trip. We're responsible, after all. Last door on my right.\"\n\nClose to exhaustion, Alan walked down the hall to the last door and\nstepped inside. A healthy, rugged man with prominent black eyes looked\nat him with a speculative glance.\n\n\"And what can I do for you?\"\n\nHolding out his passport, Alan sank down into a chair, glad of a chance\nto rest, while Dr. Willoughby studied the document, then looked up, the\nroutine smile wiped off his face.\n\n\"Well! So you're Dr. Alan Chase. I've been much interested in the papers\nyou've been publishing recently. But this is bad news, Dr. Chase. I\nsuppose you had an independent check on the diagnosis?\"\n\n\"Not even one of our freshmen could have missed it, but I had it\nconfirmed by Simmons and von Kramm.\"\n\n\"Then there's no question. How did you pick it up, doctor? Neosarcoma is\nstill rather a rare disease, and it's not supposed to be very\ninfectious.\"\n\nAlan tried to speak casually, although just looking at the rugged good\nhealth of the man opposite him made him feel weaker.\n\n\"No, it's not very infectious. But after medical school, I went into\nresearch instead of practice, and I worked on neosarcoma for nearly five\nyears, trying to devise a competitive chemical antagonist. Then, as used\nto happen so often in the old days, I finally picked it up myself--a lab\ninfection.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe older man nodded. \"Well, you're doing the right thing now in going\nto Almazin III. I've made some study of the disease myself, as you may\nknow, and I entirely agree with your theory that it is caused by a\nvirus, and kept active by radiation. Since the atomic wars, the\nincreased radioactivity of the earth undoubtedly stimulates mitosis of\nthe malignant cells. It feeds the disease, and kills the man. But on a\nplanet like Almazin III where the radiation index is close to zero, the\nmitosis of the sarcoma cells stops abruptly, virus or no virus.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" said Alan. \"I've read some of your papers on\nthe subject, and the evidence sounds pretty convincing.\"\n\n\"It's conclusive. If you arrive in time you've nothing to worry about.\nI've seen men as badly off as you, with malignant growths well advanced,\nwho migrated to Almazin III and recovered within a year. Without\nradioactivity to maintain it, the disease seems to be arrested\nimmediately, and if the tissue damage has not gone too far, the tumor\nregresses and eventually disappears. Once you're cured, you can come\nback to earth and take up your work where you left off. Well, let's\ncheck you over.\"\n\nThe examination was brief. Dr. Willoughby initialed the passport, and\noffered his hand.\n\n\"You should stand the trip all right. But I'm glad you didn't put it off\nany longer than you did. Another two months of earth's emanations, and\nI'm afraid I couldn't have certified you. It's lucky for you that the\n_Star Lord_ is the fastest ship in space. That's all, Dr. Chase. I'll be\nseeing you on board.\"\n\nIn the swiftly moving elevator cage Alan ascended the slender pylon to\nthe boarding platform, crowded by a group of quarreling children in\ncharge of an indifferent nursemaid.\n\nThe Chief Steward, rustling in starched whites, stepped forward at the\nport, clicked his heels, and curved his thin lips into a smile.\n\n\"How do you do, sir. The Star Line wishes you a happy voyage. Will you\nbe kind enough to choose?\"\n\nFollowing his nod, Alan looked down at the silver tray extended for his\ninspection, and then stepped back as a heavy perfume assaulted his\nnostrils.\n\n\"What are those?\"\n\n\"Carnations, sir, for the gentlemen's coats, and rose corsages for the\nladies' gowns. Compliments of the Star Line.\"\n\n\"But they're white!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. The white flowers, the only kind we are able to grow in\nY-port, are symbols of the white light of the stars, we like to think.\"\n\n\"What idiot gave the Star Line that idea?\" said Dr. Chase. \"You know\nstars are all colors--white, green, yellow, blue, and even red. But\nwhite carnations are a symbol of death.\"\n\nSteward Davis lowered his tray. \"Then you don't care to wear one, sir?\"\n\n\"Not until I have to,\" said Alan. \"Now please call some one to show me\nmy cabin.\"\n\n\"Band playing in the lounge, sir. Tea is being served in the Moon Room,\nand the Bar is open until just before takeoff.\"\n\n\"Thanks, but I've been ill. I just want to find my cabin.\"\n\n\"Boy!\" called Steward Davis. \"Show this gentleman to 31Q.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlan followed the pageboy through a complex of corridors, ascending\nspirals of stairs, down a hall, and to the door of Cabin 31Q. The boy\nthrew open the door and Alan stepped in, then halted in shocked\ndisbelief at sight of a white-haired old man who was just lifting a\nshirt from an opened suitcase.\n\n\"I am Dr. Chase. Isn't this Cabin 31Q?\"\n\nThe old man beamed, his pink skin breaking into a thousand tiny\nwrinkles. \"That's right. 31Q it is.\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Have you no powers of observation? Unpacking, of course. I was assigned\nto this cabin.\"\n\nStaggering over to a bunk, Alan sagged back against the wall. He lifted\nhis tired eyelids and stared at the sprightly old gentleman.\n\n\"But I was promised a cabin by myself!\"\n\nThe old man looked distressed. \"I'm very sorry, young man. I, too, hoped\nto have a cabin to my self. I learned only a few minutes ago that I was\nto be quartered with another passenger--evidently you. Somebody made a\nmistake, there's no question of that, but the Purser tells me that every\nbit of space is occupied, and no other arrangements can be made. Unless\nyou want to postpone your voyage, and follow in a later ship?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Alan. His voice had sunk to a whisper. \"No, I can't do that.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have to make the best of it, young man,\" he said, picking up\na pile of handkerchiefs, and putting them in the drawer he had pulled\nout from the wall.\n\n\"Let me introduce myself. I am Wilson Larrabee--teacher, or student,\naccording to the point of view. Some years of my life I've spent being a\nprofessor of this or that at various universities, and the other years\nI've spent in travel. Whenever the bank account gets low, I offer my\nknowledge to the nearest university, and stay there until I pile up\nenough credits so I can travel again.\"\n\n\"Sounds a lonely sort of life, with no roots anywhere.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! My wife loved travelling as much as I do, and wherever she was,\nwas home.\" He paused, his hand arrested in the act of hanging up his\nlast necktie, and for a moment his face was somber. Then he finished\nhanging up the tie, gave it a little pat, and continued cheerfully.\n\n\"We saw most of the world, in the fifty years we had together. The last\ntrip she made with me, to the Moon and back, was in some ways the\npleasantest of all. After we returned, we started planning and saving\nand dreaming of making one last grand tour outside the solar system. And\nthen--well, she was more than seventy, and I try to think that she isn't\ndead, that she just started the last tour a little ahead of me. That's\nwhy I'm making this jaunt now, the one we planned on the _Star Lord_.\nIt's lonely, in a way, but she wouldn't have wanted me to give up and\nstay home, just because I had to go on alone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlancing at Alan's bent head, Professor Larrabee abruptly banged shut\nthe lid of his empty suitcase and shoved it into the conveyor port in\nthe wall to shoot it down to Luggage. Then he straightened up and\nrumpled his white hair.\n\n\"That's done, young man. Will you join me in the Bar for a spacecap?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir. I'm very tired. I just want to rest and be quiet.\"\n\n\"But a frothed whiskey would help you to relax. Come along, and let me\nbuy you a final drink before we take off for eternity.\"\n\nAlan noticed with distaste the white carnation in the coat lapel of his\ncompanion. \"I hardly like to think of this trip as being synonymous with\neternity,\" he said. \"You sound as though you didn't expect to come\nback.\"\n\n\"Do I? Perhaps I made an unfortunate choice of words. But do you believe\nin premonitions, Dr. Chase?\"\n\n\"No. All premonitions stem from indigestion.\"\n\n\"No doubt you are right. But from the moment of boarding this ship I\nhave been haunted by the memory of an extremely vivid story I once\nread.\"\n\n\"What kind of a story?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was a scientific romance, one of those impossible flights of\nfancy they used to publish in my boyhood, about the marvels of future\nscience. This was in the days before we had got outside the solar\nsystem, but I still remember the tale, for it was about a spaceship\nwhich was wrecked on its first voyage.\"\n\n\"But there've been hundreds of other such stories! Why should this\nparticular one be bothering you now?\"\n\n\"Well, you see,\" said the professor apologetically, \"it's because of the\nname. The coincidence of names. This other ship, the one in the\nstory--it was called the _Star Lord_.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't let that worry me. Surely it's a logical name for a\nspaceship?\"\n\nProfessor Larrabee laughed. \"Logical, and perhaps a trifle presumptuous.\nBut I'm sure it's a meaningless coincidence, my boy. Now how about that\ndrink?\"\n\nAlan shook his head.\n\n\"Come, Dr. Chase. Allow me the liberties of an old man. You're obviously\nill, you want to crawl into a hole and pull the hole in after you, and\nenjoy the deadly luxury of feeling sorry for yourself. But we can't do\nthat sort of thing. Let me prescribe for you.\"\n\nWith an effort, Alan smiled. \"All right, Professor. I usually do the\nprescribing myself, but right now I'm too tired to argue. I'll accept a\nspacecap with pleasure.\" He swallowed a panedol tablet to ease his pain,\nthen pulled himself up.\n\n\"That's the spirit, my boy! We will drink to the _Star Lord_, that she\nmay have a happier fate than her namesake.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes before takeoff. The first signal had sounded. The Bar was\nclosed by now, the lounges deserted, and in theory the twelve hundred\nand fifty passengers were secure in their cabins, waiting for the\ninstantaneous jump into hyperspace.\n\nAt the port, Chief Steward Davis leaned against the wall with his tray\nof wilting flowers, while the Second Officer and two crewmen stood by,\nwaiting for the final signal to close the port.\n\nThey were startled by a sudden commotion, a flurry of voices, and turned\nto see the elevator doors open on the loading platform. A group of\nlaughing people surged forward.\n\n\"But I'm late again, darlings!\" cried a vibrant voice. \"You must let me\ngo now! The ship is waiting just for me, I know. Stop holding me!\"\n\n\"But we don't want to lose you!\" called a man.\n\n\"You know I'll be back in the fall.\"\n\n\"But the theater can't get along without you!\"\n\n\"But it won't be forever, darling!\"\n\nStill laughing, Tanya Taganova pulled away from her teasing friends. She\nwas a tall woman, very slender; very beautiful, with her burnished\nauburn hair and warm brown eyes. She walked forward with the swift\nprecision of a dancer, in her flared gown of stiff green satin, whose\nruff stood out about her slender neck to frame a regal head. In her arms\nshe carried an enormous sheaf of red roses.\n\nWith light steps she entered the port, then turned to wave at her\nfriends and give them a last challenging smile.\n\nThe Second Officer asked sharply, \"Are you a passenger, madame? You're\nrather late.\"\n\n\"And I tried _so_ hard to be on time for once in my life! I'm very\nsorry, lieutenant!\"\n\n\"Quite all right, madame. You got here in time, and that's what counts.\nBut you'll have to hurry to get to your cabin before takeoff.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" said Steward Davis. His long face had come to life as he looked\nat her admiringly and extended his tray of flowers.\n\n\"White roses? For me?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, madame. Compliments of the Star Line.\"\n\nTurning her head, she moved away. \"Thank you, but I'm not ready to wear\nwhite roses, yet. It's not that they're not lovely, but--\" she raised\nher arms, burdened with their scented blooms, \"you see that I already\nhave so many flowers, and the red rose is still for the living!\"\n\nDavis banged his tray to the floor and shoved it aside with his foot.\n\n\"All right, madame. Now we'll have to hurry. We'll have to run!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA final bell rang, a final light flashed.\n\nOn the floor below the ship, the crowds of relatives and wistful\nstay-at-homes gazed up; at the beautiful metal creation, poised on its\nslender fins, nose pointed towards the opened dome.\n\nA vibration began, a gentle, barely perceptible shuddering of the ground\nwhich increased in frequency. It beat through the floor, into their\nfeet, until their whole bodies quivered with the racing pulse that grew\nfaster, faster, as the twenty-four total conversion Piles in the ship\nreleased their power. Then, as the people watched, between one instant\nand the next, the ship vanished. In the blink of an eyelid she had\nshifted to hyperspace.\n\nThe _Star Lord_ had begun her maiden voyage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the second day out, most of the passengers felt completely at home.\nThe ship had become a separate world, and the routines they had left\nbehind them on earth, and the various routines they would take up again\nsome six weeks from now on Almazin III seemed equally remote and\nimprobable. Life on the _Star Lord_ was the only reality.\n\nShe moved through the uncharted realms of hyperspace, travelling in one\nhour's time as measured by earth watches, more than twenty light years\ndistance, if measured in the units of real space. The ship itself was\nquiet. The vibration of the takeoff had ended in a moment, and now the\npassengers could hear no noise and hum of motors, could feel no motion\nagainst swelling waves, no battering against a barrier of uneven air.\nThe artificial gravity induced a sense of security as absolute as though\nthe ship were resting on living rock.\n\nAlthough most of the cabins were small, they were cleverly designed to\nprovide the maximum of comfort, even the least expensive of them. For\nthe very wealthy, the rulers of the galaxy's finance, the owners of the\ngalaxy's industries, the makers of the galaxy's entertainment, there\nwere the luxury cabins. The floors glowed with the soft reds of oriental\nrugs, the lounge chairs were upholstered in fabrics gleaming with gold\nthread. Cream-colored satin curtains fluttered in an artificial breeze\nat the simulated windows, and on the walls hung tranquil landscapes in\ndull gold frames. To those who had engaged them, the ornate cabins\nseemed only appropriate to their own eminent positions in life.\n\nDelicious meals were served three times a day in the several dining\nrooms, the softly lighted Bar was never closed, and every day three\ntheaters offered a varied program of stereo-dramas. There was even--the\nmost marvelous, daring, expensive luxury of all--a swimming pool. The\npool was small, and was open only to the first cabin passengers, but the\nfact that a ship travelling to a distant solar system could afford room\nenough for a pool, and extra weight for the water needed to fill it,\nseemed evidence that man had achieved a complete conquest of the\ninconveniences of space travel.\n\nOne luxury, however, freely accessible to even the poorest sheep herder\non earth, was denied the passengers of the _Star Lord_.\n\nThey could not see the stars. They could not see the sky.\n\nThe ship had portholes, of course, and observation rooms which could be\nopened if at any time she cruised in normal space, but the ports and\nobservation windows were closed now, for there was nothing to see. The\nship was surrounded by blackness, the impenetrable, unknowable\nblackness, of hyperspace, but this black emptiness did not frighten the\npassengers because they never bothered to think about it.\n\nBut the builders of the ship had designed it so that even the simple\npleasure of looking at a friendly sky should not be denied its\npassengers. An artificial day and night of the appropriate length was\nmaintained by the dimming and brightening of lights, and the main\nlounges were bounded with special walls which looked like windows,\nthrough which could be glimpsed bright summer days, fleecy clouds\ndrifting over a blue sky, and, in the evenings, soft starlight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery passenger should have been soothed into contentment by these\ndevices, but by the end of the first week, Burl Jasperson was restless.\n\nHe hated to sit still, and the hours and the days seemed endless. His\nbald head and portly body were a familiar sight as he roamed the ship,\ninspecting every detail as though it were his personal responsibility.\nOnce a day he called on Captain Evans to check on the progress of the\n_Star Lord_, once a day he chafed under the cold courtesy of the\nCaptain's manner, and then wandered on. In his jacket he wore his pocket\nrecorder, and he was momentarily cheered whenever he found an excuse for\nmaking a memorandum:\n\n\"Chairs in lounge should be two centimeters lower. Sell Deutonium\nshares. How about monogrammed linens for the first cabins? Install\ngymnasium?\"\n\nAs he walked, he murmured these thoughts to his recorder, and each night\nhis meek and colorless secretary sat up late to transcribe them into the\nlocked notebook which was his special charge, after Jasperson had taken\nhis sleeping pills and crawled into bed.\n\nOn the evening of the eighth night out, Burl Jasperson wandered into the\nBar, and drummed his pudgy fingers on the table as he waited to give his\norder.\n\n\"A glass of ice water, and a Moon Fizz. And be sure you make it with\ngenuine absinthe. You fellows seem to think you can get away with making\nit with _'arak_, and your customers won't know the difference. Well,\njust remember I'm one customer that does, and I want _real_ absinthe.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, Mr. Jasperson,\" said the Bar steward.\n\nTurning restlessly in his chair, Burl let his eyes stop on the\nwhite-haired old gentleman beside him, happily consuming a brandy and\nsoda. After a moment's inspection, he stuck out his hand confidently.\n\n\"My name's Jasperson. Everything all right? Enjoying the trip?\"\n\nThe pink skin wrinkled in amusement.\n\n\"I am Wilson Larrabee. Everything's fine, thank you, except that the\nship is almost too luxurious for a man of my background. A professor's\nsalary does not often permit him indulgences of this kind.\"\n\n\"You a professor? Of what?\"\n\n\"Various things at various times. Philosophy, physics, Elizabethan\ndrama, history of science--\"\n\n\"Myself, I never could understand why a sensible man would go into that\nbusiness. No money. No prestige. Never doing anything, just reading and\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Every man to his taste,\" said Larrabee.\n\n\"Yes, within limits. But the things some of you professors think up!\nMost of the ideas do more harm than good, scaring people to death,\nhurting business. You'd think they ought to have more sense of\nresponsibility!\"\n\nHe tasted his drink, then nodded knowingly at the bartender. \"This is\nsomething like! _Real_ absinthe.\"\n\nProfessor Larrabee studied his companion. \"I can hardly suppose, Mr.\nJasperson, that you hold professors responsible for all the ills of the\nworld. And yet you seem disturbed. Did you have something in particular\nin mind?\"\n\n\"Yes. The Thakura Ripples!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmusement vanished from the professor's eyes. \"What about them?\"\n\n\"Why are people so afraid of them? As far as I can see, they're just a\npiece of nonsense thought up by a dreamy-eyed physics professor, and he\nhypnotized people into believing in them. But as I was telling Captain\nEvans last night, they've never been seen, never been measured, and\nthere's nothing at all to prove that they have any existence outside the\nmind of a madman. And yet people are afraid of them!\"\n\n\"And just what are the Thakura Ripples?\" said Alan Chase, drawing up a\nchair. \"Waiter, I'll have a spacecap.\"\n\n\"Feeling a little better tonight, Alan?\" asked his friend.\n\n\"Some, thanks. I just had a checkup from Dr. Willoughby, and he thinks\nI'm more than holding my own. Now go on about the Ripples. Where are\nthey? What do they do?\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Jasperson muttered. \"If you want to tell ghost stories,\ngo ahead.\"\n\n\"Thank you. The Thakura Ripples, my boy, are an unexplained phenomenon\nof hyperspace. We do not know what they are--only that they are\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"But I thought that space was entirely uniform?\"\n\n\"Alas, no. Not even normal space can be called uniform. It has been\nknown for a long time that variations exist in the density of the\ninterstellar gases. Just why they occur, what pattern they follow, if\nany, was for many years one of the major unsolved problems confronting\nastronomers and physicists. Then they learned that these variations in\ndensity of the interstellar gases were directly connected with the\ndevelopment of the successive ice ages on the earth, and eventually a\nstudy of the collisions and interactions of the various light forces\nfrom the stars in the galaxy made the pattern clear. We know, now, that\nthe variations occur only in a certain band of space. They may occur at\nany given place within that band, but their position is constantly\nshifting and unpredictable.\"\n\n\"Now you see it, now you don't?\" said Alan.\n\n\"Exactly. Now it was Thakura's theory that the Ripples are an analogous\nband of mysterious forces existing in hyperspace. They may be tangible\nbarriers, they may be force barriers, we do not know. But a ship\nentering this lane _may_ go through it without damage, and by pure\nchance take a course which misses all these bumps in space. Or, by going\nslowly and using his instruments to feel his way, a navigator can often\nsense them ahead, and if he is skillful he may be able to dodge them.\nBut if, in some terrible moment, he smashes head-on against the Thakura\nRipples, the conversion Piles which power his ship are immediately\naffected. They begin to heat, perhaps to heat irreversibly, and if they\nget out of control, they may vaporize. In the last fifty years at least\nfive ships have vanished in this region, and it was Thakura's belief\nthat they were disintegrated on the Ripples.\"\n\n\"But there isn't any evidence!\" Jasperson exploded.\n\n\"Isn't a demolished space ship evidence?\"\n\n\"No! It's evidence that something went wrong, certainly, but it doesn't\ntell us _what_ went wrong. I'm not an unreasonable man, professor, I'm a\nhardheaded business man, and I like to deal with facts.\"\n\n\"I don't have an intimate knowledge of these matters, of course,\" said\nLarrabee, \"but it was my impression that in the past fifty years since\ntravel in hyperspace became common, several ships have been\nunaccountably lost.\"\n\n\"Your first figure was right. Five ships have been lost--that much is\nfact. Why they were lost is still a question. It's my considered\nopinion that they were lost by human failure; the crewmen let the Piles\nget hot, and the ships were helpless. In the early days they had to get\nalong with only one or two Piles, and if they went wrong the ship was\ndone for. But we've changed all that. That's why the _Star Lord_ has\ntwenty-four Piles. No matter what happens it's impossible that _all_ of\nthem should go bad at once. She can ditch the dangerous Piles and still\nalways have power enough left to make port. One thing is certain, this\nship will never be wrecked on the Ripples of a mad scientist's\nimagination! A phenomenon like the Ripples, is impossible. If it\nexisted, we'd have had some proof of it many years ago.\"\n\n\"But surely you don't mean to imply that if we don't know a fact, it is\ntherefore impossible?\"\n\n\"Not at all. But you know yourself, Professor Larrabee--you're an\neducated man--that by this time our physicists understand the universe\ncompletely, from A to Z. There are no unexplained phenomena. Thakura is\nshut up in a madhouse now. In my opinion, he was already insane when he\npublished his theory.\"\n\nLarrabee was nodding, thoughtfully. \"I wonder what makes you so certain\nof your theory?\"\n\n\"What theory? I never deal in theories. I'm talking fact.\"\n\n\"Your theory that we have unveiled all the mystery of the universe; how\ndo you know? Every now and then, of course, man lives through a century\nof such amazing progress that he concludes that nothing remains to be\nlearned. But how can he ever be certain?\"\n\n\"But we are certain! Most physicists are in agreement now that there\nhasn't been one single unexplained physical aberration in the past\ncentury!\"\n\n\"Most physicists except Thakura, you mean?\"\n\n\"But Thakura is insane! We understand all the physical phenomena of the\nuniverse.\"\n\n\"Except the Thakura Ripples?\"\n\nJasperson slammed down his glass and stood up, his face red and puffy.\n\"Steward! More ice water! I'm getting tired of those words, professor.\nDo you think for one minute I'd have risked my life to come on this trip\nif I'd thought there was the slightest danger?\"\n\nAlan looked up languidly. \"You mean you wouldn't mind sending a crew and\npassengers into danger--as long as you could take care to be safe\nyourself?\"\n\n\"Surely you're not afraid, Mr. Jasperson?\" said Larrabee.\n\n\"No. What is there to be afraid of?\" He gulped down his drink. \"Nothing\ncan wreck the _Star Lord_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Dr. Alan Chase woke up next morning and glanced at his wrist watch,\nhe realized that the breakfast hour was nearly over. Professor Larrabee\nhad already left the cabin.\n\nAlan was not hungry. It had been many months since he had really enjoyed\nan appetite for food, but he got up and began to dress, so that he could\nperform the duty of eating. But his clothes, he noticed, were beginning\nto fit a little more snugly. He fastened his belt at a new and\npreviously unused notch, buttoned his jacket, and then performed the\nritual he carried out every morning and every evening.\n\nTouching a facet in the ornamentation of his wrist watch, he walked\nabout, geigering the room. Radiation normal, somewhat less than earth's\nnormal, in fact. The twenty-four Piles were well shielded, and if this\ncontinued, he should survive the journey in fair shape.\n\nAt the door of the dining room he paused, for the entrance was blocked\nby Steward Davis and the young couple he had noticed the day they left\nY-port.\n\nThe tall young man with rumpled black hair was arguing, while the pretty\ngirl clung to his arm and watched his face admiringly, as though he were\nthe only man in the world.\n\n\"But Steward,\" said the young man, \"Dorothy and I--that is, Mrs. Hall\nand I--we felt sure we'd be able to have a table by ourselves. We don't\nwant to be unreasonable, it's only that this is our honeymoon, maybe the\nonly time we'll ever get to spend together, really, and we like to eat\nalone, together, I mean. That's the reason we chose the _Star Lord_,\nbecause the advertisements all talked about how big and roomy it was,\nand how it didn't have to be so miserly with its space as they did in\nearlier ships. They said you could have privacy, and not have to crowd\nall together in one stuffy little cabin, the way they used to.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Hall,\" said the Steward crisply. \"We are all proud of\nthe spaciousness of our ship, but not even the _Star Lord_ can provide\nseparate tables for everybody who--Oh, _good_ morning, Mr. Jasperson!\nGlad to see you, sir.\" Turning his back on Tom, he smiled and bowed to\nthe new arrival \"Everything all right, sir?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Dr. Chase. No nightmares last night? 'Morning Davis. Tell\nthat waiter of mine to be more particular about giving me plenty of ice\nwater. I like plenty of water, and I like it cold.\"\n\n\"Sorry, sir. I'll speak to him at once.\" He bowed again as Jasperson\nstrode on.\n\n\"Then could we--\" Tom began.\n\nDavis whirled with an impatient frown. \"What? Are you still here?\nSurely I made it clear that there's nothing I can do, Mr. Hall?\"\n\n\"But couldn't you at least move us to another table?\"\n\n\"I regret that you are dissatisfied with our arrangements. All table\nspace was allocated before we took off from Y-port.\"\n\n\"But you've put us with such noisy people!\" said Tom stubbornly. \"They\nkeep talking about how much money they made in deutonium, and they refer\nto us, right in front of us, as the babes in the woods. They may be\nrich, but they haven't the manners of a six-year old. We _can't_ stay at\nthat table.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hall, I can't waste any more time with you. If all our passengers\nwere to demand special privileges--\" He shrugged his shoulders.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDorothy Hall whispered shyly, \"Ask him, then, what about that man?\" and\nshe nodded her head slightly to the right.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"You say there isn't enough room, but what about that\ntable over there? It's made to seat two, and there's just that one man\nwho eats alone.\"\n\nDavis glanced over. \"Oh, yes. But that's Mr. Jasperson! He likes to be\nby himself.\"\n\n\"Who's Mr. Jasperson?\"\n\n\"A very important man.\"\n\n\"And I'm not?\"\n\nAlan broke in. \"Excuse me, Mr. Hall. I am Dr. Chase. Won't you join my\ntable? Three of the people assigned places there are Almazanians, a\ndiplomatic mission, I think, and they naturally prefer to have their own\ncuisine in their own cabins, so we have room for three more.\"\n\n\"How about it, Steward,\" said Tom. \"Any objections?\"\n\nShrugging his shoulders, Davis strolled away.\n\nTom glared at the retreating back. \"That guy has the face of a murderer.\nHe can't be decent to anybody with less than a million credits.\"\n\nDorothy laughed. \"Never mind, Tom. Someday you'll be the most famous\nlawyer in the Interstellar courts, and maybe you'll get a chance to\nprosecute him for arson or treason.\"\n\nAlan led them to the rear of the dining room, where his two table\ncompanions were finishing the last sips of their coffee, and lighting\nthe first cigarette of the morning.\n\n\"Miss Taganova, may I present Tom and Dorothy Hall, who would like to\nshare our table.\"\n\nTanya lifted her beautiful auburn head and smiled a welcome. Professor\nLarrabee stood up, his pink cheeks crinkling with pleasure as he shook\nhands with Tom.\n\n\"Young people make the best companions,\" he said, \"especially on long\njourneys.\"\n\nAlan sat down and reached for the vitamin dispenser. \"These particular\nyoung people want privacy. They're on their honeymoon, and would hardly\nshed a tear if all the rest of the world suddenly ceased to exist.\"\n\n\"It's not quite like that, Dr. Chase,\" said Tom, his face reddening,\n\"but those people at our other table were just out of our class, one way\nor another. The men talked all the time about their bank accounts, and\nthe women clawed at each other about which one had the biggest house,\nand the biggest pearls and diamonds and emeralds, until we began to feel\nsmothered in a blanket of credits and diamonds.\"\n\n\"Credits and diamonds must be very nice things to have,\" said Tanya.\n\"I've never managed to collect many of either.\"\n\n\"I've nothing against them in themselves,\" said Tom, \"but right now they\ndon't seem to matter very much. We had to wait five long years to be\nmarried, five years for me to finish my law training, and for Dorothy to\nwear out her family's opposition. They didn't want her to throw herself\naway on a penniless lawyer.\"\n\n\"As if I were a child who didn't know her own mind,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Well, I wanted Tom, penniless or not; and anyway, in a few years he's\ngoing to be the finest lawyer in the Interstellar Courts.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll always be as happy as you are now, children.\" The\nprofessor's eyes were misty as he stood up. \"Come, Miss Tanya. Take a\nstroll with me, and bring back to an old man a brief illusion of youth.\"\n\n\"But you'll never be old!\" she said affectionately. \"You're still the\nmost fascinating man on the ship.\"\n\nLike every other man in the room, Alan watched with envious eyes as\nTanya took the professor's arm and sauntered to the door, the heavy\ntaffeta skirts of her pearl-gray gown swishing and rustling as she\nwalked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin the sealed hulk of the _Star Lord_ the twenty-four Piles silently\ndid their work, out of sight, out of the thoughts of the passengers.\nDriving the ship through the unknowable infinities of hyperspace, they\nheld her quiet, steady, seemingly without motion. They behaved as they\nwere intended to, their temperatures remained docilely within the normal\nlimits of safety, and the ship sped on.\n\nThe technicians and maintenance men, the navigators, the nucleonics men,\nall kept aloof from the social eddies frothing at the center of the\nship. They lived in another world, a world of leashed power, in which\nthe trivial pursuits of the passengers were as irrelevant as the\ntwitterings of birds.\n\nIn the central tiers occupied by the passengers, each morning the walls\nof the lounges and dining rooms resumed their daily routine of\nsimulating the panorama of earth's day. Lights glowed into a clear\nsunrise, brightened into a sunny sky across which light clouds scudded.\n\nChildren played in the nurseries, grownups idled through the hours,\neating the delicious food, taking a dip in the priceless pool, attending\nthe stereodrams, and playing games. At the cocktail hour, the orchestra\nplayed jaunty tunes, old-fashioned polkas, waltzes, mazurkas; at dinner,\nit shifted to slower, muted melodies, suitable background for high\nfeminine voices, deep male laughter, and the heavy drone of talk.\n\nIn the walls, the sun set, twilight crept in, and the stars came out.\nAfter the stars had been advancing for several hours, people finished\ntheir dancing and card games, walked out of the theaters, had a final\ndrink at the Bar, paused at the bulletin board which detailed the ship's\ndaily progress, and went to bed.\n\nDr. Alan Chase followed his own routine. Each morning and each evening\nhe geigered his cabin and found the radiation still below the earth\nnormal. He was surprised to find that he was holding his own,\nphysically, instead of becoming progressively weaker, as he had\nexpected, and he began to feel hopeful that he might quickly regain his\nhealth on the inert atmosphere of Almazin III. He was not strong enough,\nhowever, to take part in the active games of the passengers, and had not\nenough energy to try to make friends, except for the people at his\ndining table--particularly Tanya.\n\nOf all the lovely women on board, he thought Tanya Taganova the\nloveliest. He knew he was not alone in this, for the arresting planes of\nher face, the dramatic color of her rustling taffeta gowns, attracted\nmany followers. He would sit in the lounge at night and watch her\ndancing, and then realize, suddenly, that she had disappeared, long\nbefore the evening was over. She was an elusive creature, as\nunpredictable as a butterfly.\n\nWandering listlessly about the ship, one afternoon he stepped through\nthe open door of the Library. In the almost empty room he saw the auburn\nhead of Tanya, bent over so as to hide her face and show him only her\nglowing hair. She raised her head as he approached.\n\n\"Are you looking for a book, Dr. Chase?\"\n\n\"No, I just wondered what was interesting you so much.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe shifted her seat, to let him see a large sheet of rough drawing\npaper covered with a chalk sketch of a desolate gray marsh over which\ngreen waves swirled from the sea, behind them loomed rose-colored\ngranite hills.\n\n\"I'm a scene designer, you know. But at home, somehow, I never have time\nto myself. People will never believe I'm serious, and when I want to get\nsome real work done, I run away on a trip, by myself. Right now I'm\nsketching out a set for a new stereodrama we're staging next autumn.\nThis particular one is for a melancholy suicide on Venus. I've several\nmore here.\" She pointed to a scattered heap of drawings.\n\nThe soft chime of the library telephone interrupted them. Tanya rose and\nmoved to the desk.\n\n\"Yes? Not now, youngster. I'm working. Yes, maybe tomorrow.\"\n\nAlan had been examining her drawings. \"Is this what you do during the\nhours when you disappear?\".\n\n\"Usually. Sometimes I drop into the playroom to chat with the children.\nThey're more interesting than their parents, for the most part, and\nnobody ever seems to pay much attention to them.\"\n\n\"But do you have to work at night, too? When you disappear in the middle\nof the evening, everybody misses you. The men all watch for you to come\nback, their wives sigh with relief, and old man Jasperson toddles around\nand searches the dance floor and bleats, 'Where's Miss Tanya? She was\nhere just a little while ago, and now I can't find her anywhere!'\"\n\n\"I know. But one dance an evening with him is about all I can stand. I\ndon't really like the man.\"\n\n\"But why? He's a little stupid, but he seems a harmless sort of duck. In\na financial deal, of course, I can see that he'd be sharp and\nruthless--that's how men like him become millionaires--but he can't\nknife anybody on shipboard.\"\n\nTanya slashed a heavy black line across her drawing, bearing down so\nhard that she broke the chalk, and threw the pieces to the floor.\n\n\"He's a coward! Haven't you ever noticed the way he bullies the waiters?\nHow he patronizes Professor Larrabee, and ignores the young Halls? And\nto hear him tell it, you'd think only his advice makes it possible for\nCaptain Evans to run the ship! I'm afraid of men like that. They're\ncowardly and boastful, and in a crisis they are dangerous!\"\n\n\"What an outburst over a fat little bald-headed man! Aren't you letting\nyour dramatic sense run away with you?\"\n\nLaughing, Tanya picked up her chalk and resumed sketching. \"Probably,\nbut after all, I earn my living with my imagination.\"\n\n\"Then you aren't just a rich young woman dabbling in the theater?\"\n\n\"No indeed. If you could see my bank account! No, I'm going to Almazin\nIII to make authentic sketches of the landscape. We may do a show set in\nthat locale, next year.\"\n\n\"I wish I could see some of the shows you stage.\"\n\n\"When we get home, I'll send you a pass.\"\n\nHe did not answer. Suddenly the melancholy Venusian scene she was\ncreating depressed him, as if it had been a reflection of his own barren\nlife.\n\n\"Or don't you like the theater, Dr. Chase?\"\n\n\"It's not that,\" he said hastily. \"Only--\" He shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Something about this ship, I suppose. Home seems so very far away.\"\n\n\"Have you felt that too? I've had the feeling, sometimes, that earth\nisn't there any more, and that this ship is the only reality.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the end of the third week out, Burl Jasperson was afflicted by an\nalmost intolerable tension. He prowled the ship like a tiger, for he\ncould think of nothing more to do. For the moment there were no more\nimprovements to suggest to the Star Line, no more brilliant financial\ndeals to execute, and each empty minute seemed to swell into an endless\nhour. He tried to relax by viewing the dramas on the stereoscreen, but\nhe was always too uneasy to sit through an entire performance, and would\nleave in the middle to resume his pacing of the corridors.\n\nAt his private table in the dining room he stared at the empty chair\nacross from him, munching his food mechanically, seething with unrest.\nHe could see Tanya's gleaming head across the room, with Alan Chase's\nbeside her, and he tortured himself with imagining the light laughter,\nthe friendly talk which must be taking place there. Never, before this\ntrip, had he been made to feel so unnecessary, so much an outsider.\nWasn't he a lord of finance, a master of industry, the kind of a man to\nbe respected and admired? Of course, less successful men called him\nruthless, he realized, but he was not ruthless--only realistic. He was\nan able man, and if he expected people in general to take orders from\nhim, it was only because he was more intelligent and more capable than\nthe people to whom he gave his orders. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut these miserable empty days were beginning to frighten him. He felt\nlost. The ship ran by herself, without needing his help, and there was\nno doubt at all that she would win the Blue Ribbon. Although he\nquestioned Captain Evans sharply, and checked every day on the minutest\ndata of the voyage, so far he had found nothing to criticize--except the\ncoldness of Josiah Evans' manner.\n\nHe ground his teeth through a stalk of celery in a vicious bite. After\nall, wasn't he Chairman of the board of directors of the Star Line?\nWasn't it his right, even his duty, to make sure that everything was\ngoing well?\n\nThe crowd of diners had grown thin, now, and he could see clearly the\nlittle group at Tanya's table. They were laughing, and he could see the\ndelightful animation which always disappeared whenever he tried to talk\nto her.\n\nSteward Davis sidled up, a deferential smile on his long face.\n\n\"Is everything all right, Mr. Jasperson?\"\n\n\"Um.\"\n\n\"Looks like we'll get the Blue Ribbon this trip, doesn't it, sir?\"\n\n\"Um.\"\n\n\"If you should ever want any special dishes, sir, any little delicacies\nnot available to everyone, I should be glad to speak to the chef.\"\n\nJasperson pushed his plate away. \"I'll remember, Davis.\" Throwing down\nhis napkin he stood up. His waiter came running.\n\n\"Dessert, sir?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout answering, he strode across the room, trying to compose his\nmouth into a smile as he reached his goal.\n\n\"Miss Taganova, would you care to join me in the bar for a drink?\"\n\nThey all looked up at him in astonishment.\n\n\"But I've just finished dinner,\" she said.\n\nHe waited, uncertainly. At last Professor Larrabee pointed to the\nunoccupied chair.\n\n\"Perhaps you'd care to join us, instead?\"\n\nNo one else spoke, and he sat down nervously. Conversation had stopped,\nand at last he broke out with explosive force.\n\n\"I wish Captain Evans would speed up this ship. It feels as if we'd been\non the way forever. And still three weeks to go!\"\n\n\"Do you find three weeks so long a time?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"It seems like eternity. I wish something would happen. Why can't we\nhave a little excitement?\"\n\n\"Couldn't you find any more banks to break today?\" Alan drawled. \"No\ngambles on the stock exchange?\"\n\nThe professor broke in soothingly. \"Now, there's an idea! You're\nobviously a gambling man, a man of action. Do you play poker? Why don't\nyou get up a little game among your friends? That ought to provide you\nwith excitement for one evening at least.\"\n\n\"Would you join the game?\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear Mr. Jasperson! You and I do not move in the same\ncircles. I confess, I enjoy the delightful uncertainties of poker, but I\ncould never afford to play for your stakes.\"\n\n\"Then we'll make the stakes what you can afford. Each raise limited to\nfive credits?\"\n\n\"In that case, I might consider it.\"\n\n\"You, Dr. Chase?\"\n\n\"Too exciting for an invalid, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"You, Mr. Hall?\"\n\nTom squeezed Dorothy's hand under the table. \"No, thank you, Mr.\nJasperson. My wife and I, we have other plans.\"\n\n\"If it's money, young fellow, I'll stake you, and you can have a year to\npay me back.\"\n\nTom grinned. \"You're very generous. But what makes you so sure you'd be\nthe winner?\"\n\n\"I always win. Will you join the game, Miss Taganova?\"\n\nHe accepted her silent head-shake without protest.\n\n\"Then I'll try to round up two or three others. We don't want a big\ncrowd--too many people make me nervous. Perhaps Willoughby will play,\nand I'll get Captain Evans. He doesn't like the game, but he'll sit in\nif I insist. See you in my suite in half an hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe poker game had been in progress for more than an hour when Captain\nEvans entered the parlor. Frowning, Jasperson looked up.\n\n\"You're late, Josiah. I told you we'd begin at nine.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Burl. I was delayed.\"\n\nJasperson paused in the act of raking in the pot, and looked up sharply.\n\n\"Anything wrong?\"\n\n\"No, all serene.\"\n\n\"Anything you need my advice on?\"\n\n\"No, just a routine conference with the navigator.\"\n\n\"Then pull up a chair and get in the game.\"\n\nNearly half the chips were piled in front of Jasperson, and across from\nhim a modest heap sat before the professor. At his right the baggy-eyed\nonly son of a deutonium millionaire fingered his dwindling pile\nindifferently, and on his left Dr. Willoughby stared unbelievingly at\nhis few remaining chips, three blues and a couple of whites.\n\n\"I'll just watch,\" said the Captain. \"You know I'm not much of a\ngambler. Chess is my game.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Josiah. I insist that you play. Prove that you've got red\nblood in your veins.\"\n\nEvans hesitated, but remained standing. \"I'd rather just look on.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Captain. Doesn't the Star Line always try to please its\npassengers? Well, I'm a passenger. Or is it just your native caution\nthat makes you afraid of losing?\" His laugh did not entirely disguise\nthe irritation in his voice.\n\n\"All right, anything to oblige,\" said Evans wearily, pulling up a chair.\n\"What stakes are you playing for?\"\n\nThe Captain lost, slowly and steadily. Mechanically he went through the\nmotions of dealing, discarding, drawing, and betting, but it was obvious\nthat his mind was not on the game. Jasperson rarely lost a hand, if he\nhad stayed at all, while Professor Larrabee's luck was unpredictable,\nthe pile of chips before him fluctuating, growing or diminishing with\nstartling swiftness.\n\nThey were interrupted once when a waiter came in with a tray of bottles\nand glasses. The Captain refused.\n\n\"But one drink won't do you any harm,\" said Jasperson.\n\n\"I never drink in space. For one thing, the rules of the Star Line\nexplicitly forbid it, as you should know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I helped make that rule. That means I can release you from it.\"\n\nBut Evans was firm. \"I never drink in space,\" he repeated. \"I'll take\ntwo cards--no, make it three.\"\n\nThe professor surveyed his hand with his customary sprightly air.\n\n\"I'll play these,\" he said.\n\nJasperson discarded. \"I'll take one.\"\n\nCaptain Evans languidly opened the betting, but after the first round he\ndropped out, and only Jasperson and the professor remained. Each raised\nthe other persistently, and while Jasperson grew more and more excited,\nthe professor smiled as usual, his eyes glinting with amusement.\n\n\"And another five,\" said Larrabee.\n\nFor the first time, Jasperson hesitated. \"You sure you mean it,\nprofessor? I kind of hate to clean you out, especially because I doubt\nif you can afford it.\"\n\n\"Suppose you let me be the judge of what is, after all, a private\nmatter?\"\n\n\"All right, it's you that will go bankrupt, not me. And another five.\"\n\n\"See you, and raise you five!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJasperson sat back and pondered, his cold eyes calculating. \"Now let's\nreview the situation, just among friends. The professor's a smart man,\nand he isn't rich. He saw me draw one card, so he can make a pretty good\nguess what I probably hold, if I drew the right card, but he's playing a\npat hand, and playing as if he meant it. Well, I've put a lot of credits\nin that pot, but I never did believe in throwing good money after bad,\neven in a friendly game. I quit.\"\n\n\"What? You mean you're going to drop out without even seeing me?\"\n\n\"I know when I'm licked. Five credits is five credits, even to me.\" He\nthrew down his cards and reached to gather in the deck.\n\nSlowly Professor Larrabee raked in the chips, as Jasperson went on\ncomplacently.\n\n\"That's the only principle a practical man can work on. Know when you're\nlicked. Get all the facts, analyze all the data, and then act on the\nlogical conclusion, no matter how much you may hate to. It was clear to\nme that you must have drawn a pat flush that would top my straight, so I\nsimply decided not to waste any more money.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jasperson. I appreciate the gift.\"\n\n\"It was no gift. You had me beat.\"\n\n\"Did I? Only if you had all the facts, only if you analyzed all the\ndata, and only if you reached the correct conclusion. Perhaps you ought\nto see what I held.\"\n\nDeliberately he turned over his hand and spread the cards.\n\nJasperson jumped to his feet in a rage. \"But that's a handful of junk!\nNot even a pair! You held a bust, and I had you beat!\"\n\n\"Certainly. But you didn't know it. Without all the facts, you acted on\na faulty conclusion.\"\n\nBreathing noisily, his plump face flushed, Jasperson smashed his fist\ninto his pile of chips and scattered them to the floor.\n\n\"A pure bluff! I hate bluffing!\"\n\n\"Then you miss a great deal of fun in life,\" said Larrabee calmly. \"I\nfind it dull just to analyze data and then bet on a sure thing. I like a\nlittle excitement.\"\n\nSlowly the financier sank back into his chair. He gulped in a large\nbreath of air and tried to steady himself, a sickly smile around his\nmouth.\n\n\"Excuse me, Professor. But you took me by surprise.\" Hands trembling, he\nbegan to shuffle the deck.\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and a crewman entered.\n\n\"What is it, Stacey?\" said Captain Evans.\n\n\"Chief Wyman is waiting to see you in your quarters, sir.\"\n\nWith a sigh of relief, the Captain turned in his few chips. \"Time for\nme to quit, anyway.\"\n\nHis face still red, Jasperson looked up hopefully. \"Shall I come with\nyou? Any way I can be of use?\"\n\n\"No thank you, Burl. I'll leave you to your little game.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the Captain's quarters, Chief Wyman was pacing the floor.\n\n\"Sir!\" he burst out. \"This is it! We've hit the Thakura Ripples!\"\n\n\"Impossible, Wyman! It's too soon. What's happened?\"\n\n\"You told me to report as soon as we ran across anything suspicious,\nsir. Well, look what our screen has been picking up.\"\n\nHe handed over a plastic record tape, perforated by minute notches which\noutlined an unsystematic, jagged line of peaks and hollows.\n\n\"We've been getting this stuff all evening.\"\n\n\"Doesn't seem to mean anything. It doesn't show any sort of pattern.\"\n\n\"No, sir, and it may not mean anything, but it's different from what\nwe've been getting up till now. And then another thing. It's probably\nnot serious, but the number ten Pile has started to heat.\"\n\n\"Begun to heat? What's wrong with Pile Ten? One of your men been getting\ncareless?\"\n\n\"I'm positive not, sir. I have complete confidence in all of them.\"\n\nCaptain Evans studied the record tape, a worried frown on his forehead.\n\n\"It's just possible, I suppose, that the Ripples--Is Pile Ten heating\nfast?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It's still below the critical level, and of course we're\nputting in dampers.\"\n\n\"I wish we _knew_ something definite about the Thakura Ripples,\" the\nCaptain burst out, \"what they are, what they do, what they look like,\nand _how_ they affect our atomic Piles! If only Thakura were still a\nsane man, and could finish up his calculations!\"\n\n\"Maybe Thakura was crazy to start with,\" said Chief Wyman, \"or maybe the\nRipples drove him crazy. I don't know. But I do know Pile Ten is\nheating.\"\n\n\"Well, keep watching it. Double the checks on the other Piles, and let\nme know of even the slightest rise.\"\n\nAs soon as the door had closed, Evans opened the desk panel and buzzed\nOperations.\n\n\"Pilot Thayer? Captain Evans here. I am about to give you an order. As\nsoon as you have executed it, come at once to my cabin, and bring\nNavigator Smith with you. Here it comes. Reduce speed immediately,\nrepeat immediately, to one-half, repeat one-half. That's all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNobody felt the alteration in the progress of the _Star Lord_. Within\nthe metal casing of the ship nothing was changed. The sunny scenes in\nthe walls were just as bright, and the synthetic light of the slowly\nmoving stars at night was just as soothing. For the passengers, the\nblack menace outside the ship did not exist. Because change of speed\ncannot be felt in hyperspace, they had no way of realizing that the\n_Star Lord_ had slackened her pace and was feeling her way cautiously as\na blind man to avoid the ominous barriers of the Thakura Ripples.\n\nOn their way to their cabins that night, there were a few people who\nnoticed that the bulletin which detailed the day's run had not been\nposted on the board, but they wondered only for a moment why it had been\nomitted, and then forgot the matter.\n\nGoing in to breakfast next morning, Burl Jasperson stopped to read the\nbulletin as usual, to find how many light years distance had been put\nbehind him in this interminable journey, and he clenched his fist at\nfinding a blank board before him.\n\nAbruptly turning his back on the dining room, he proceeded straight to\nthe Captain's quarters, where Stacey stopped him in the anteroom.\n\n\"Where's Captain Evans?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Jasperson. The Captain left orders he was not to be\ndisturbed.\"\n\n\"He'll see _me_. Let him know I'm here.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. My orders were, nobody was to be admitted. He was very\nspecific.\"\n\nStacey did not budge, but the inner door swung open and the Captain's\ntired face peered out.\n\n\"You have a very penetrating voice, Burl. I suppose you might as well\ncome in. It's all right, Stacey. Stand by.\"\n\nHe moved to let Jasperson enter, and closed the door.\n\nAbout the desk sat Chief Engineer Wyman, Chief Pilot Thayer, and Chief\nNavigator Smith, all studying a chart laid out before them, and making\ncomputations. They looked up at the interruption.\n\n\"What's going on here?\" said Jasperson. \"If you're having a conference\nof some kind, I should be in on it.\"\n\n\"Just routine work, Burl. What is it you want?\"\n\n\"Somebody is getting careless. The bulletin of yesterday's run has not\nbeen posted. It's little things like that that make all the difference\nin the reputation of a shipping line. Somebody ought to be reprimanded.\nWhat was the day's run, by the way? Well, speak up, Josiah! I'm\nwaiting.\"\n\nEvans reached for a sheet of paper from the desk and silently handed it\nacross. Jasperson looked at the figures, frowned, and spoke angrily.\n\n\"Have your computers broken down, Captain Evans? Or is this a joke? Why,\nthat's only about two-thirds our usual distance. At this rate it will\ntake us from now to eternity to arrive.\"\n\n\"You'd better sit down, Burl.\" The Captain looked steadily at him.\n\"Those figures explain why I ordered that the bulletin was not to be\nposted. Not one passenger out of a hundred would have noticed much\nchange in the figures, but I do not want to alarm even that one in a\nhundred. I have ordered the ship to proceed at half-speed.\"\n\n\"What? Have you lost your mind?\"\n\n\"We are approaching the Thakura Ripples. It just isn't safe to go any\nfaster.\"\n\nExpelling a long breath, Jasperson spoke more calmly.\n\n\"That means we'll be late in reaching Almazin III?\"\n\n\"Three or four days, perhaps, not more. Eventually we'll get through\nthis danger zone, and then we can resume speed.\"\n\n\"But we _can't_ be late, Captain Evans! Surely you haven't forgotten\nthat we're out after the Blue Ribbon? The Light Line's ships have made\nit in forty-three days, and we've got to do it in forty-two or less.\nThis trip is a matter of prime importance to the Star Line, and a delay\nof even three days would keep us from breaking the record. I thought you\nunderstood all that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSighing, the Captain shook his head. \"I know all that. But we are in\ndangerous regions, and I can't risk my ship just for a piece of silk!\nLast night Pile Ten started heating. It's still hot, and we may have to\nexpel it. I hadn't expected to reach the Ripples so soon, and had even\nhoped we could avoid them entirely, but evidently the limits of the band\nhaven't been charted very accurately. The only safe thing is to go\nslow.\"\n\n\"But the Ripples are imaginary! Why do you think we've hit them?\"\n\n\"There's the number Ten Pile.\"\n\n\"But why should only that one out of the twenty-four be affected? And\neven if it is heating, that's no good reason for slackening speed.\"\n\nCaptain Evans glared back at the plump little man, then his eyes\nwavered, and his fingers fiddled uncertainly with the papers on his\ndesk. His chief officers were watching him intently. At last he\nstraightened his shoulders and spoke sternly.\n\n\"Mr. Jasperson. Surely it will not be necessary to remind you that I am\nthe Captain of this ship. I am in sole command. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Would you seriously advise me to go contrary to my own knowledge, my\nown instinct? To run this ship into an area of danger, to risk the lives\nof the passengers, all for a piece of ribbon? Would you want to take the\nresponsibility of giving me such an order, even if I should agree?\"\n\nAs Jasperson looked around at the watchful faces of the Engineer, the\nPilot, and the Navigator, some of the belligerence left his voice.\n\n\"Certainly not, Josiah! And anyway, it's not your knowledge I'm\nquarreling with. If you run the ship according to the facts, you'll do\nall right. It's when you let your judgment be influenced by your\nimagination that I object. But by all means, do as you think best. When\nthe Star Line loses confidence in its Captains, they replace them. I'll\nlook in again, if I may, later in the day.\"\n\nWhen the door had closed behind him, Pilot Thayer shook his head\nwonderingly. \"You'd think he ruled the universe!\"\n\n\"He's a man of very limited imagination,\" said the Captain. \"But never\nforget, he wields a great deal of power. Now, are your orders clear?\nSmith, you'll continue your charting.\"\n\n\"I'm doing my best, Captain, but what am I charting? Sometimes I wonder\nif maybe your friend Jasperson isn't right. If the Ripples are\nimaginary, maybe I'm getting gray hairs trying to make a map of\nsomething that isn't there!\"\n\n\"Chart it anyway! We can't take chances. Wyman, I'm not a bit satisfied\nwith the way Pile Ten is behaving. It should have cooled to normal\nbefore now. Watch it. If we have to dump it, we want to act before it\ngets too hot. Anything else?\"\n\n\"One other thing, sir,\" said Engineer Wyman, pointing to the diagram of\nthe ship which hung on the wall. \"Pile Ten is located just below\nLifeboat C, and the radiation index of Boat C is getting a little high.\"\n\n\"That's bad. Well, keep shoving in the dampers, and keep me posted.\"\n\nAfter they had gone, he sat for a while at his desk, studying the data\non the papers before him. He paced the room for a few minutes, then\npaused to pick up the little red volume of _Ley's Space Ships_. He had\nno need to open it. It fell open of itself at the well-read page, and\nhis eyes rested for one rich moment on the words: _Captain: Josiah\nEvans_.\n\nWhat name, he wondered, feeling almost physically sick with\nuncertainty, what name would be printed in the next edition?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe orchestra played melodiously at lunch time. The chef had produced\ndelicacies even more delectable than usual, and at each table the\nwaiters poured sparkling white wine into long-stemmed glasses, while\nmurmuring softly, \"Compliments of the Captain!\"\n\n\"Is this a special occasion?\" asked Tanya.\n\n\"Not that I know of, miss.\"\n\n\"Every meal feels like a special occasion,\" said Alan, \"because I get to\ntalk to you.\"\n\n\"Sh-h! Here come the Halls.\"\n\nTom and Dorothy flitted in to the table, hand in hand, still absorbed in\nthe wonder of being together, scarcely aware of the world about them,\nthen left, without finishing their dessert. Alan and Tanya looked after\nthem with affectionate amusement, but Professor Larrabee seemed\nwithdrawn and a little sad, as though they evoked memories of a time now\nlost to him forever.\n\n\"They make me feel so _old_!\" said Tanya.\n\n\"And lonely?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, a little. They seem so sure, somehow, that all the rest of\ntheir lives will be just as happy as this, always.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Professor Larrabee.\n\nThe orchestra swayed into a final soft chord, and immediately a voice\nspoke from a loudspeaker in the ceiling.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" Conversation stopped, the room became quiet.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen. The customary lifeboat drill will be held this\nafternoon at 1600 hours. The attendance of all passengers is requested.\"\n\nThe voice stopped, the orchestra resumed its playing, and the passengers\nsipped their coffee.\n\n\"I wonder why he said 'customary'?\" said Tanya. \"We've been out about\nthree weeks, and this will be the first drill we've had. Do you suppose\nsomething is wrong?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid your sense of the dramatic gets the better of you,\" said\nAlan. \"What could be wrong with the _Star Lord_?\"\n\n\"Maybe her name,\" murmured Professor Larrabee, and his eyes looked\nhaunted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSolitary at his table, Burl Jasperson sipped at a glass of ice water as\nhe pondered. For the first time in his life he was not quite sure what\ncourse to follow. He wanted that Blue Ribbon for the Star Line, and\nyet--he did not know what to do. While he listened to the announcement\nof the lifeboat drill, his lip twisted in contempt. Just like Josiah\nEvans, he thought, to be over-cautious and run the risk of starting a\npanic.\n\nStill thinking, he left the dining room and went to the main lounge to\nstudy the illuminated map of the ship. The three-dimensional panorama\nshowed the slim and elegant body of the _Star Lord_, tapered like a\nsilver spindle. Six small ships, three on each side of the long axis,\neach capable of carrying 250 people, were fastened into her hulk.\nSeemingly a part of the ship itself, their outer walls forming a part of\nthe ship's wall, they were designed to be detached at the touch of a\nbutton, and launched into space as free craft.\n\nWhen the warning bells rang, he joined the crowd of passengers who were\nassigned to Boat F, peered at the boat through the transparent panel,\nand listened attentively to the instructions. It was Steward Davis, he\nnoted approvingly, who was in charge.\n\n\"Passengers will file in through the usual port and walk to the farthest\nunoccupied seat, and buckle themselves into place. They have nothing\nfurther to do. Crewmen will take care of the mechanics of detaching and\nlaunching the boat. You will note that there are no separate cabins,\nonly rows of seats as in the primitive airplanes, but you will find this\nno real discomfort, since the boat would undoubtedly be picked up after\na very short interval by some alerted space liner.\"\n\nJasperson raised his voice above the crowd's hum.\n\n\"What about provisioning? Are the boats stocked on Y-port?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Jasperson, except for food concentrates, and one air tank which\nis placed there for the greater comfort of the crewmen who must go in to\nclean or to make minor adjustments. The boats are not fully provisioned\nuntil the need arises. After all, we don't want to invite trouble, do\nwe?\"\n\nPeople laughed appreciatively.\n\n\"No,\" he went on, \"if there should be an emergency, we have specially\ntrained crewmen whose job it is to stock reserves of air and water. They\nwould go to work as automatically and efficiently as machines. Any other\nquestions?\"\n\nJasperson lingered after the indifferent crowd, to inspect the boat more\nclosely, then slouched away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll that afternoon he prowled the ship, trying to make up his mind. He\nstopped now and then to question a business acquaintance, ask a\njournalist his opinion, and he quizzed Larrabee again, more sharply than\nbefore, about the hypothetical Ripples. He kept moving, and as he walked\nhe calculated, bringing to bear all the power of a mind which he\nbelieved to be logical, and which his financial success had proved to\nbe keen and intelligent. All his life he had trusted his judgment, and\nit had rarely failed him--barring accidents like that unfair poker game.\nAt last, as the hours went on, his decision crystallized. He had made up\nhis mind.\n\nAt dinner he drank champagne in addition to his usual ice water, and\nonly half heard the scraps of conversation in the dining room. There was\nto be a special masquerade dance, he gathered. People around him were\nexcitedly planning the improvisation of costumes. He would not get\nhimself up in any silly costume, he decided, but if his plans went well,\nhe might look in later in the evening, on the chance to being allowed to\nglide over the waxed floor with the lovely Tanya.\n\nAfter finishing his last drop of coffee he went directly to the cabin of\nCaptain Evans, who had just begun to eat his simple dinner.\n\nThe Chairman of the board of directors pulled up a chair and sat down,\nwithout waiting to be asked.\n\n\"Look here, Josiah, I want to talk to you. I've been thinking. I'm\nafraid I was too brusque this morning. That's a bad habit of mine, and I\nwant to apologize. But after all, we should not be quarreling, for your\ninterests and mine are the same, as you surely realize.\"\n\nCaptain Evans pushed away his tray, lit a cigar, and puffed stolidly. \"I\nrealize that I must consider the safety of my passengers, if that's what\nyou mean.\"\n\n\"That's included, of course.\" Jasperson made his voice warm and\npersuasive, the voice that had swayed boards of directors, the voice\nthat reassured hesitant bankers.\n\n\"Passenger safety is always paramount, of course, and I respect your\nattitude there. But in this particular case, isn't it possible that you\nare being too cautious?\"\n\n\"But Burl! Can the Captain of a ship _ever_ be too cautious? Think of\nhis responsibility!\"\n\n\"His responsibility is very great, and I would never advise you, nor\npermit you, to shirk yours. But sometimes caution may cease to be a\nvirtue. Think about this caution of yours for a minute. Surely you\nbelieve that I would never urge you to do anything against the interests\nof the ship, or against your own conscience? Now you have an excellent\nmind--logical, objective, clear. That was one reason we chose you for\nthis place. Try to consider, for a moment, the bare possibility that\nyour decision to reduce speed may not have been justified.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvans was silent, and finally Burl asked, \"How far did we get today?\"\n\n\"240 Light years.\"\n\n\"And if you decide to continue at that speed for five or six days, that\nmeans we'll be approximately three days behind schedule in touching\nAlmazin III?\"\n\n\"About that.\"\n\n\"And that means we won't break the record. Now consider the reason for\nthis very unhappy situation. Think about it with an open mind. You have\none Pile heating--but has that never happened to a ship before, even in\nnormal space? You and I both know it happens, and that ships have been\nlost because of a defective Pile. Logically, why shouldn't this be just\nanother such case? You say it is caused by the Ripples, but as man to\nman, what objective evidence can you bring forward to prove their\nexistence? I'm not trying to browbeat you, you understand, but just to\nask you to look at the matter carefully. You said yourself, this\nmorning, that you hadn't expected to be meeting the Ripples at this\npoint--you had thought they occurred in a rather different area of\nhyperspace. Couldn't that mean that they don't really exist, anywhere?\"\n\nCaptain Evans wiped his glistening forehead with his handkerchief.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I was surprised. I'll admit I didn't expect them here.\nBut there's so much we don't know about hyperspace!\"\n\n\"No, there's so much we _do_ know! Are you a child, to fancy there are\ngoblins outside just because it's dark? There is a perfectly rational,\nalternative explanation for the things that worry you. Why can't you\naccept them?\"\n\nEvans got up and began to pace the floor. \"I guess I'm following a\nhunch.\"\n\n\"But would you make us lose the Blue Ribbon for a mere hunch? Don't you\ntrust your own objective judgment?\"\n\nSweating heavily, the Captain tried to stub out his cigar, but his hands\nwere moist and his fingers trembled.\n\n\"I don't know!\" he shouted. Then he went on, his voice low and tired.\n\"You may be right. Burl. You may be right. We may not have hit the\nRipples. The Ripples may not even exist, although some very competent\nspacemen and some very brilliant physicists are convinced they do. But\nhow can I judge? How can I be sure?\"\n\nJasperson leaned forward, intent as a cat on a bird.\n\n\"None of the other Piles have started to heat? There's nothing else to\nmake you suspicious?\"\n\n\"Nothing except the space record tape, and that makes no sense.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Then why don't you look at this situation as a hardheaded\nspaceman should, and order full speed ahead?\"\n\n\"Burl, there are fifteen hundred lives dependent on me. How can I take\nsuch a chance?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be a chance. And if by the one unlucky chance in ten\nmillion there should be trouble, you have ample lifeboat space for\neveryone. Isn't it worth the gamble?\"\n\n\"I don't like gambling lives against a piece of blue silk ribbon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJasperson sighed. \"Come, Josiah, be reasonable. I wouldn't think of\ngiving you an order, or trying to interfere with your decision in any\nway, but surely I may be allowed to help you to reach the correct\ndecision? How will you feel when the _Star Lord_ limps into port four or\nfive days late, and you have to explain to the Board that she was\ndelayed because you were trying to dodge some non-existent Ripples. You\nare afraid! Change your frightened point of view, and that will make you\nchange your orders and get us on the way once more, full speed!\"\n\nMuttering to himself, wiping his brow, Captain Evans walked around the\nlittle room, while Jasperson sat back and watched him with cold, intent\neyes. Evans glanced once at the little red book, half covered with\npapers, and pain contorted his face.\n\nSuddenly he stepped to his desk and called Engineer Wyman.\n\n\"What about that space tape, Wyman? Has Smith been able to detect any\npattern in the impulses?\"\n\n\"No, sir. No pattern of any sort we can recognize, anyway.\"\n\n\"And what report on Pile Ten?\"\n\n\"Pile Ten is doing nicely, sir. Lost half a degree in the last hour. By\ntomorrow she ought to be back to normal limits.\"\n\nClicking the phone, Evans resumed his pacing in the heavy silence. At\nlast he faced Jasperson and spread out his palms, his face gray as\nparchment.\n\n\"All right, Burl. You're probably right. I won't argue any longer.\"\n\n\"Good man! The Star Line will know how to appreciate your decision.\" He\nhesitated, and asked, \"You'll agree, now, I didn't push you into this?\nIt's your own free decision?\"\n\nCalmly, Evans answered. \"It is my own responsibility.\"\n\nHe buzzed Operations.\n\n\"Wyman? Captain Evans speaking. Full speed ahead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the dance floor late that night, a crooner in blue Venusian mask and\nwig hummed the melody while the orchestra wailed and zinged behind him.\nThe lights had been dimmed to a purple midnight, and shadowy couples\nflitted about the room, swaying, humming, laughing. Horned devils danced\nwith angels, pirates and Roman senators guided in their arms lovely\nCleopatras and sinuous mermaids. Hunched over the little tables,\nclinking glasses, grotesque silhouettes of Martians, Venusians, and\nApollonians whispered intimately.\n\nThe walls of the room displayed the evening stars of late summer, and,\nspecial event for a gala evening, a fat yellow half moon sailed lazily\nin the sky.\n\nThe _Star Lord_ shuddered, briefly. Briefly the crooner's voice wavered,\nthe notes of the violins hesitated, but no one noticed. A second quiver\nof the ship, and the dancers paused to look at one another\nquestioningly, then laughed and danced on.\n\nJasperson had been sitting beside the wall, vainly searching among the\ndancers for Tanya. He stood up, his forehead suddenly wet with sweat.\nPlowing through the dancers and out of the door, in the corridor he ran\ninto Steward Davis, gliding along on silent, slippered feet.\n\n\"What was that, Davis?\"\n\n\"Don't know, sir. Nothing serious, or the alarm lights would be on.\"\n\n\"Come with me.\"\n\nHe flung open the door of the Captain's cabin. It was empty. Stacey was\nnot in the anteroom, and the inner cabin was silent. The water carafe\nhad been turned over on the desk, and a few papers lay scattered on the\nfloor.\n\n\"They might be in Operations, sir.\"\n\n\"Show me the way!\" They raced down the corridors, past the open door of\nthe room where dancers still swayed and the orchestra still played.\nThrough a hall, down an escalator, down, down, to the center of the\nship.\n\nJasperson paused. \"You needn't wait, Davis. But I may want you again.\nI'll let you know.\"\n\nPushing aside the crewmen who stood guard at the door, he rushed into\nthe room.\n\n\"Josiah! What was that shock? I demand to know what's happened!\"\n\nEvans threw him a glance of pure, intense hatred, and then resumed his\nquestioning of Chief Wyman.\n\n\"You say Number Ten just let go?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, sir. For a couple of hours or so after we resumed speed,\nit stayed steady. All of a sudden, it started to climb. They called me,\nbut by the time I got there it was already at critical level. We put in\nmore dampers, but it kept going up and up, and I thought it might\nvaporize any minute. I hadn't any choice, sir. There wasn't time to call\nyou and get orders. I had to drop it.\"\n\n\"Certainly. I'm not criticizing you. But there's one thing we hadn't\ncounted on. Chief Thayer says Pile Ten took lifeboat C along with it.\"\n\n\"But how could that happen?\"\n\n\"Boat C was just above, you remember. The heat triggered the release\nmechanism, and the boat launched itself into space.\"\n\nJasperson interrupted, trying to speak calmly. \"What's happened? Tell me\nwhat's wrong?\"\n\n\"We've hit the imaginary Thakura Ripples,\" Evans said savagely, \"and\nthey're tearing us apart!\"\n\nThe plump soft body of Burl Jasperson seemed to deflate. The truculence\ndrained from his face, leaving his skin a dirty white as he whispered,\n\"Then the Thakura Ripples _are_ real? And we're in danger?\"\n\nThe Captain's laugh was bitter. \"What do _you_ think? Don't you want to\ngive me the benefit of your advice now?\"\n\nAgain the door burst open, and a crewman ran in.\n\n\"Captain Evans, sir. Piles Fourteen and Fifteen have started to heat.\nThey're already at critical level.\"\n\n\"Dump them!\"\n\nThe phone buzzed, and Evans listened with a face which was turning a\ngraveyard gray.\n\n\"If you can hold them down, keep them. If they pass the critical point,\nshoot them away.\" Turning, he looked straight into the dilated eyes of\nJasperson, and spoke as if every word were a knife thrusting into the\npudgy body.\n\n\"Every one of the Piles is starting to heat. Every last one. One life\nboat is lost. That means fifteen hundred people to be crowded into five\nlittle boats!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" croaked the little man.\n\n\"I've already reduced speed. I've sent out and am still sending out\ncalls for help, over phase wave. We'll shift to normal space, and we'll\nlaunch the lifeboats as soon as they can be provisioned and loaded. And\nthen we'll pray. And now, Burl Jasperson, how do you like the Thakura\nRipples?\"\n\nBracing himself against the desk, Burl tried to smile. \"If there's any\nway I can help, of course, just let me know.\" With a feeble attempt at\njauntiness, he staggered out of the cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOpening the long-closed shutter of the observation port, Captain Evans\ncould see the suns of normal space glittering in the blackness about the\nship, unfamiliar and alien. Before the shift to normal space he had\nsent out SOS calls throughout the galaxy, but he had not waited for any\nreplies before shifting. He could not know whether the calls had been\nheard, or even whether there were any ships close enough to send help\nafter hearing the calls. He hoped, with all his being, that they had\ncome out in a region of inhabited planet systems, in a regular shipping\nlane, so that his passengers could be picked up and taken to port--any\nport.\n\nHe kept his line open to Operations, and every minute or so Wyman spoke\nto him, giving the data on the climbing piles. Ten had been jettisoned\nin hyperspace, and so had Fourteen and Fifteen. Since their shift to\nnormal space, it had been necessary also to detach the entire bank of\nNineteen, Twenty, and Twenty-one, whose index had risen at a terrifying\nrate.\n\nWyman's voice spoke in his ear. \"One, Two, and Three are climbing fast,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Shoot them away!\"\n\n\"No good, sir. I've tried. The release mechanism has fused, and those\nthree Piles are welded to the ship!\"\n\nEvans closed his eyes. That meant that the life of the ship was doomed.\nThere would be no way to save her. But the passengers could still be\nsaved, if they got away soon enough, before the three Piles vaporized.\n\n\"Wyman!\" he whispered despairingly, \"is there any single Pile that isn't\nheating?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Is there any single Pile that's responding to your dampers?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not one.\"\n\n\"Then, in your experience, they are all bound to go, sooner or later?\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this in my experience, sir. It looks\nbad.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Jasperson slunk in. His skin had lost its\ncushioning, gray folds sagged under his cheek bones, and black hollows\noutlined his glittering blue eyes. The Captain ignored him, and spoke\ninto the phone.\n\n\"Very well. In exactly fifteen minutes I shall sound the alarm and we'll\nabandon ship. I can't take a chance on waiting any longer. Keep a\nskeleton crew at work on those Piles to hold them down as much as\npossible, and have all other crewmen report to their lifeboat stations.\"\n\n\"Right, sir. But Boat C has gone, you remember. When we dumped Pile\nTen.\"\n\n\"Yes. Distribute her passengers among the remaining boats.\"\n\nHe turned to look at Jasperson, who was shivering as though he were\nfreezing.\n\n\"Is there no hope, Josiah? Is this the end?\"\n\n\"The end of the _Star Lord_, yes. I hope to save the passengers. You\nheard me. In fifteen minutes all preparations should be finished, then I\nsound the alarm. Don't worry, Burl. There's room enough for everybody,\nyour skin is safe.\"\n\n\"But won't the lifeboats be horribly crowded?\"\n\n\"Crowded, yes, but not impossibly so. If they can carry two hundred and\nfifty people in fair comfort, they can jam in three hundred by squeezing\na bit.\"\n\nJasperson shuddered. \"So many people! And so close together! I can't\nbear crowds, Josiah, you know that. They make me feel sick and confused.\nIt will be terrible!\"\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, there's nothing else to do if we want to\nsave lives. I'll sound the alarm in a quarter of an hour. Get yourself\nready, but whatever you do, don't tell the others yet. I don't want a\npanic on my hands until I'm ready to deal with it.\"\n\nBiting his lip, Jasperson turned, without a word, and shuffled out of\nthe cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce in the corridor, he began to run, a shrivelled old man waddling on\nwings of fear down the hall to the dining room where empty tables waited\nin the elegant silence of gleaming silver and crisp white linen for the\nbreakfast hour.\n\nDavis was standing at the sideboard, staring blankly at the flashing red\nlight above the door.\n\nJasperson ran up to him and clutched his arm. Looking around cunningly\nto see that they were alone, he whispered.\n\n\"Davis, I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Later, sir. That red light means I'm wanted at the briefing room.\"\n\n\"Yes, but wait a minute!\"\n\n\"I'm supposed to go at once, sir.\"\n\n\"A thousand credits if you'll listen to me a minute!\"\n\nAs Davis hesitated, Burl went on. \"Listen, Davis, the ship is in\ntrouble. The Captain is going to launch the lifeboats. You're in charge\nof Boat F, aren't you? You know how to operate it?\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Jasperson.\"\n\n\"Then come with me, and we'll take the boat now. I'll pay you well.\"\n\n\"But we can't do that!\"\n\n\"Why not? The _Star Lord_ is doomed. In fifteen minutes this place will\nbe a madhouse, and there may not be room for everybody. I want to get\nout of here before the mob. We'll take Boat F.\"\n\nSteward Davis' eyes were thoughtful as he replied. \"But sir, we can't\njust take a boat for ourselves, like that. There's two hundred and\nfifty people assigned to Boat F.\"\n\n\"Worse than that! Three hundred! One lifeboat has been lost already.\nIt's dangerous to wait--there'll be a stampede and the lifeboats might\neven be wrecked. No, we must take her alone, Davis. I'll give you ten\nthousand credits if you'll do it, and as long as you live you'll have me\nas a friend.\"\n\nThe steward's Little eyes looked sidewise at the pleading man. \"But I'd\nbe found out for sure, Mr. Jasperson, and then what would become of me?\nI'd never get another job as long as I lived. I'd have to change my\nname, disguise myself, and maybe live on some other planet, and all that\nwould take money. I'm a poor man, and I don't see how I could afford\nit.\"\n\n\"But if I have to squeeze into one of those boats with three hundred\nother people crowding against me, I'll go crazy! We'll go to some\nout-of-the-way planet, and you can change your identity and be perfectly\nsafe. Can't you understand, man? My life is at stake, and my sanity.\nI'll give you fifteen thousand credits!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Davis. \"Could you make it twenty-five?\"\n\n\"Done! Meet me at Boat F in five minutes.\"\n\nJasperson rushed to his cabin. Yanking open the wall safe he dragged out\nhis brief case and the locked memorandum book, thrust his pistol into\nhis pocket, and ran to the door.\n\n\"Follow me!\" he called to his startled secretary, and hurried from the\nroom.\n\nRunning past the library door, he glimpsed Tanya at work, her auburn\nhead bent over her sketching. On impulse, he stopped and ran back.\n\nPanting from the physical punishment of running, nearly smothered by the\npounding of his terrified heart, he gasped out his invitation.\n\n\"Tanya! The ship is going to blow up! Don't tell anyone. Come with me\nnow, before the crowd, and I'll get you off safely in my lifeboat. I'll\ntake care of you, Tanya.\"\n\nShe pulled away. \"Have you lost your mind, Mr. Jasperson?\"\n\n\"Don't argue. There's no time. Come, I'll protect you. We'll have plenty\nof room. If you wait, it may be too late.\"\n\n\"Go with you, and leave the others? You're mad!\"\n\n\"But if you wait, you'll be trampled to death by the mob. I'm giving you\na chance to save your life.\"\n\n\"But you can't take that boat for yourself. What would happen to the\nother people? That would be murder. Get away from me! I'm going to call\nCaptain Evans.\"\n\nAs she ran to the phone and pressed the dial, he padded out of the door\nand resumed his flight to Boat F where Davis waited, peering nervously\nup and down the hall. Waving his secretary to follow, Jasperson rushed\nthrough the port.\n\n\"Everything ready, Davis? Provisions all in?\"\n\n\"All set. I saw the tail end of the truck leaving just as I got here,\nbut I'll just check--\"\n\n\"Hurry, man! There's no time to waste.\" He cocked his head, listening to\nthe low rumble of an approaching motor. Davis ran inside, and together\nthey watched from the port.\n\nComing swiftly down the corridor was a small motor truck. It stopped,\nand the driver jumped out and shouted.\n\n\"Get out of that boat! She's not ready yet! What are you--\"\n\nWith a steady hand Jasperson drew his pistol and pressed the trigger.\nThe man fell without a sound.\n\n\"What are you waiting for, Davis? Shove off!\"\n\nThe port door slid shut. A few seconds delay, and Lifeboat F, carrying\nthree persons, shot away from the _Star Lord_ into space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlarm bells rang, red lights flashed.\n\nSickening with the inexorable rise of her fevered power units, the _Star\nLord_ trembled with the clangor of bells ringing in library and nursery,\nin lounges and dance hall, in bar and cabins, in dining rooms and\ntheaters. The orchestra crashed to a stop, the dancers halted, startled\nand vaguely frightened, half laughing at themselves as they listened to\nthe bells.\n\nThen silence, and the voice of Captain Evans.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen. Do not be alarmed. Because of certain mechanical\ndifficulties the _Star Lord_ has shifted to normal space. There is no\nimmediate danger, but purely as a precautionary measure we shall launch\nthe lifeboats. Remember, there is no danger, but I ask each of you to\nproceed at once, in calm orderly fashion, to the station to which you\nare assigned, and there obey the orders of the officer in charge. The\npassengers formerly assigned to Boat C will be placed in other boats. Do\nnot wait to go to your cabins. Proceed immediately to your lifeboats.\"\n\nThe voice clicked off. A few seconds of silence, and then the quiet was\nbroken by the patter of hurrying feet. In a moment, the public lounges\nwere empty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the library, Tanya was still calling into the phone.\n\n\"Operator, operator!\" she cried. \"I must speak to the Captain. It's a\nmatter of life and death!\" But the phone was dead.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen the alarm bells rang, she listened to the announcement and then\nslowly put back the useless instrument. Back in her corner, she picked\nup her chalk, shuffled her drawings into an orderly heap, paused, and\nwith a wry smile dropped them all to the floor and hurried away.\n\nA sound of crying wailed from the open door of the playroom, and she\nlooked in to see a group of children, none of them more than six,\nhuddled together and sobbing. She walked up to them and smiled, hands on\nher hips.\n\n\"Well, small fry! What are you doing up so late? Why the big howls?\"\n\nStill they cried, ignoring their abandoned toys. Around the room hobby\nhorses sat quietly, alphabet blocks lay scattered, and picture books and\nsprawling dolls littered the floor.\n\n\"So,\" she said. \"Your nurses ran out on you, did they? Left you to shift\nfor yourselves? Never mind, youngsters, Aunt Tanya will look after you.\nTake hands, now, and come with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the alarm rang in the Bar, a glass crashed to the floor as the only\nson of the deutonium millionaire jumped to his feet and ran.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nProfessor Larrabee deliberately finished his drink, gently put down the\nglass, and stood up.\n\n\"Our final spacecap,\" he said. \"Well, Alan, it's been a good trip, but I\ncan't say I'm surprised at its ending. The ship had the wrong name, from\nthe beginning.\"\n\n\"We'd better hurry, Professor. We must find Tanya and the Halls.\"\n\n\"You're walking too fast for me, my boy. Don't worry. They're in Boat F,\nwith us, and we're sure to find them there.\"\n\nIn the corridor leading to F station their way was blocked by the crowd,\nmany of them still wearing the grotesque costumes of the masquerade\ndance, now pale and tawdry in the bright lights. Stunned with horror,\nthey stared through the transparent wall at the gaping socket where the\nlifeboat had been. Crewmen formed a tight circle around the truck and\nthe man who lay moaning on the floor. Pistols ready, they held back the\ncrowd while Dr. Willoughby administered an intravenous shot of panedol,\nand Captain Evans, kneeling beside the dying man, tried to catch his\nwhispers.\n\n\"It was Mr. Jasperson, sir. He got me before I could do a thing. I tried\nto stop him.\"\n\n\"You say you warned him?\"\n\n\"I called to him, sir, and said the boat wasn't ready. But he didn't\ngive me a chance. He shot me.\"\n\nThe boy closed his eyes, and Evans stood up.\n\n\"Through an error, ladies and gentlemen, Boat F has already gone. You\nwill please go to the other stations and wait for assignment to the\nother boats.\"\n\nThe crowd whispered, staring uncomprehendingly at the Captain's stony\nface.\n\n\"Did you ever teach mathematics, Professor?\" Alan murmured. \"How do you\ndivide fifteen hundred people among four boats?\"\n\nLarrabee only smiled, a faraway look in his eyes.\n\nA frightened voice cried, high and loud, \"But there won't be enough\nroom!\"\n\nSomeone screamed. Someone else started to run. In a few seconds a mob of\nrunning, panic-stricken people jammed the corridor, fighting their way\nout. Alan and the professor, an old man and an invalid, had no strength\nto resist and were helplessly carried along by the living wave.\n\n\"Stop those people!\" shouted the Captain.\n\nA gun fired into the air and the mob hesitated, then surged on,\nshouting, past the lounges, to join the throngs waiting at the other\nstations.\n\n\"It's no use,\" said Evans wearily. \"Chief Thayer. Send men to all the\nstations to guard the boats. You proceed to Boat E and load it first. If\nany person tries to force his way in, shoot to kill!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn their small cabin, Dorothy Hall raised herself on one elbow and\nlooked down at her sleeping husband. His hair was rumpled, his face calm\nand placid.\n\n\"Tom,\" she whispered. \"Wake up, Tom!\" Mumbling sleepily, he opened his\neyes, then smiled and tried to draw her down to him.\n\n\"Wait, Tom. Did you hear the Captain's message?\"\n\n\"What message?\"\n\n\"I was so sleepy I didn't understand it very well. Something about the\nship, and we must all go to our lifeboats.\"\n\n\"You must have been dreaming. What time is it?\"\n\n\"Not quite midnight. Do you think everything is all right?\"\n\n\"Of course. You just had a bad dream. The _Star Lord_ can't be in any\ntrouble. You know that.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we ought to go see?\"\n\nPlayfully he towsled her hair. \"Trying to get away from your husband?\nTired of me already?\"\n\nRelaxing, she snuggled down beside him with a happy sigh.\n\n\"I'd never be tired of you, Tom, in a million years. Wherever you are,\nthat's where I want to be, always.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe children were no longer afraid, and they had stopped crying. Leading\nthem through the maze of corridors towards Boat station F, Tanya laughed\nand told them jokes until, reaching a corner, she suddenly found the\npassage blocked with a screaming mass of people, fighting, gouging,\njamming the hall so that forward movement was almost impossible. She\ndrew back, huddling the children behind her.\n\n\"No place for us here, youngsters,\" she said. \"Let's go back, where it\nisn't so noisy.\"\n\nObediently they followed her back to the library, where she settled them\nin her favorite corner and picked up the abandoned chalk and paper.\n\n\"Now Aunt Tanya will tell you a story,\" she said. \"And if you're very\ngood and don't cry at all, I'll even draw you some pictures to go with\nthe story. Once upon a time....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was not enough room. A lifeboat which had been designed to carry\ntwo hundred and fifty persons could not suddenly expand to take in three\nhundred and seventy-five, although Chief Thayer did his best. At Boat E\nhe stood with drawn pistol, sorting the crowd, and ordering them one by\none through the port according to custom as ancient as the race.\n\n\"Women and children first,\" he repeated, again and again. \"_Women and\nchildren first!_\"\n\nThey could hear from distant corridors an occasional shout and the\nclatter of running feet, but the first panic had subsided, and under the\nmenace of the crew's guns the people had become subdued.\n\nWhite-faced men stepped back and made themselves inconspicuous in the\nshadows, watching their wives and children file through the port, and\nlooking after them hungrily. Once, a man screamed and tried to crash\nthrough the cordon. Thayer shot him, and he fell moaning to the floor.\nDr. Willoughby moved through the crowd, soothing the hysterical,\njollying the frightened, until he spied Alan Chase standing at the edge\nof the group.\n\nHe pushed through to Alan and threw his arm around the bony shoulder,\nencouragingly.\n\n\"I'm assigned to this first boat, Chase, and they'll want you in one of\nthe others. We want at least one medical man in each boat. But I must\nwarn you--\" he look-ed around cautiously, but they might have been alone\nin a desert for all chance there was of anyone's listening to them, \"be\nsure to get off in Boats B or D. Don't wait for Boat A.\"\n\n\"What difference does it make?\"\n\n\"Boat A lies above two of the Piles that had to be dumped, and the\nradioactivity index is sure to be high. Normal people won't be harmed in\nthe brief time they'll be on board if they're rescued, and if they're\nnot rescued, of course, it won't matter anyway. Even you might not be\nharmed, but with your condition you shouldn't take the risk.\"\n\n\"But does it really matter?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that we'd counted on my reaching Almazin III quickly and living\nin an inert atmosphere in order to cure the neosarcoma. Now that the\n_Star Lord_ is wrecked, I may not be able to get there for months, and\nthat will be too late. If I'm going to die, I'd rather stay with the\nship and get it over with.\"\n\n\"Don't be an idiot, doctor! Don't you realize how much better you are?\nThe mitosis was definitely decreasing the last time I checked you. This\ndelay won't be fatal, I'm convinced.\"\n\nAlan shook his head skeptically.\n\n\"Dr. Willoughby!\" called Thayer. \"Boat ready to launch!\"\n\nA grip of the hand, and he had gone. The port shut.\n\nBoat E, jammed with three hundred and twenty-five persons, released\nitself and shot out into star-studded space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoat B was the second to be launched, and Boat D followed.\n\nKeeping to the back of the crowds, Alan watched, admiring the efficiency\nwith which Chief Thayer worked, shouting, wheedling, cursing, until\nthree hundred and thirty people were squeezed in, like frightened cattle\nin a pen.\n\nThere remained only Boat A, and from the shadows he watched nearly five\nhundred tense faces, drawn with the anxiety of wondering who was to go,\nand who remain.\n\nGood thing the women and children had all been taken off in the earlier\nboats, Alan reflected thankfully. It would be heartbreaking enough for\nThayer to have to choose among the men, and say to some, _Go_, and to\nsome, _Stay_.\n\nCaptain Evans appeared, flanked by Thayer and Stacey, each with drawn\npistol. He faced the silent crowd and spoke with terrifying calm.\n\n\"I will take charge here,\" he said. \"I cannot ask Thayer to take on such\na responsibility. I am sure it is not necessary to tell you that there\nis not room enough in this boat for all of you. If rescue ships arrive\nin time, those who must remain behind will be taken off. If not--I\nrealize that no human being has the right arbitrarily to send some men\nto life and keep others for possible death. But since choice of some\nsort is necessary to avoid a panic which might result in unnecessary\ndeaths, I shall choose which ones are to enter this boat, as nearly as\npossible according to the random positions in which you are now\nstanding. Anyone trying to change his place will be shot!\"\n\nNo one moved. No one spoke.\n\n\"Thayer, you will send in two crewmen to help run the boat. You yourself\nwill be the last man in, to take command. As for the rest--\" He paused,\nwiped his hand over his reddened eyes, and staggered. In a few seconds\nhe had regained control of himself, and with shoulders erect he pointed\nhis arm and called out,\n\n\"You go, and you, and you, and you....\"\n\nAlan heard a low chuckle behind him, and turned to find Professor\nLarrabee.\n\n\"What a climax, my boy! Do you believe in premonitions, now?\"\n\n\"Why haven't you gone?\"\n\n\"Too old, Alan. I don't want to go. My life is done. But I can't say I\nreally mind. It's been a wonderful adventure, sharing the life and death\nof the _Star Lord_.\"\n\nThe boat was nearly half full when the tense quiet was broken by the\ntreble voice of a child.\n\nCaptain Evans whirled to face the corridor, along which came Tanya,\nholding to the hands of the two smallest children, while the others\nclung tightly to the stiff folds of her taffeta gown.\n\nHis stare was ghastly. \"Miss Taganova! I thought you'd gone! Where have\nyou been? And why weren't these children sent off in the other boats?\nDidn't you hear the warnings?\"\n\n\"Somebody's always scolding me for being late,\" said Tanya, lightly.\n\"But I really couldn't help it. These children seem to have been\nabandoned by the nursemaids and lost or forgotten by their parents. I\nhave been trying to amuse them until it seemed safe to bring them to\nyou. If I'd come before they would have been trampled to death.\"\n\n\"Well, luckily it's not too late. In you go, the lot of you.\"\n\nThe six youngsters were scrambling through the port, and the Captain had\nresumed his \"You, and you, and you....\" when Alan darted forward and\nclasped Tanya's hand.\n\n\"I just want you to know,\" he whispered. \"If the _Star Lord_ had gone on\nto port I'd never have dared say it. But since it can't matter now,\nTanya--I'd like you to know--\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I know, Alan. I've known it for many days. And I'd have\nmade a good doctor's wife, I think!\" Her lips were trembling as she\nturned away and entered the port.\n\n\"Dr. Chase!\" roared the Captain. \"What are you doing here? You were\nsupposed to go on Boat D!\"\n\n\"There isn't room for all of us, Captain. I thought the healthy men\nshould have the preference. I prefer to stay here.\"\n\n\"Personal preferences mean nothing at all at this moment. Get into the\nboat.\"\n\n\"Let some one else have my place, sir. I haven't long to live anyway,\nyou know. I don't mind staying behind.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Captain steadied his pistol. \"Get in. That's an order. This is no\ntime for mock heroics. You should have gone with Boat D to look after\nthe women and children. Whether you live a month or a year doesn't\nmatter to me, but it is important that you use your medical skill to\ntake care of these people until they are rescued.\"\n\nWith a dazed look, Alan walked through the port.\n\n\"And you, and you, and you....\"\n\nThayer called out at last. \"That's all, sir. No more room.\"\n\n\"None at all? You're sure?\"\n\n\"Certain, sir. The talley is three hundred and thirty....\"\n\nNearly a hundred men remained in the corridor. Ashen-faced but calm,\nthey stared at the rectangular doorway which would have meant a chance\nto live.\n\n\"In you go, Thayer,\" said the Captain. \"Prepare to release.\"\n\nInto the tense silence broke the brittle clicking of high heels as Tom\nand Dorothy Hall sauntered up, arm in arm, a puzzled frown on their\nforeheads.\n\nThe Captain moaned. \"Another woman! Wait, Thayer. We've one more woman\nhere. Which one of you men in Boat A will volunteer to give up his place\nto young Mrs. Hall?\"\n\nAn elderly man walked serenely back into the ship, and joined the\nothers.\n\nDorothy looked bewildered. \"But what's happened? We kept hearing so much\nnoise we decided to get up. Is something wrong?\"\n\n\"We're abandoning ship. This gentleman is giving up his place to you.\nGet in.\"\n\nShe clung to Tom's arm. \"Not without my husband!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hall! We can't waste time on hysterics. This ship might be\nvaporized while we're talking. A man has given up his chance at life for\nyou. Get in.\"\n\nShe held back. \"And Tom?\"\n\nWith a haggard smile, Tom pat-ted her shoulder. \"Never mind me, honey.\nYou go jump in. I'll be all right.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Hall, I'm willing to deprive one man of his chance, because you\nare a woman. But I will not ask anyone else to give up his place to your\nhusband. Every man in the lifeboat has as much right to his life as your\nhusband, and so has every man who must be left behind. Go, now. It's\nyour last chance!\"\n\nHer face had become calm and all hint of tears was gone. Without\nhesitating she looked up at her husband and spoke softly.\n\n\"Tell the man to go back. Whether we live or we die, we'll do it\ntogether.\" Smiling at Tom, she took his hand to lead him away.\n\n\"Come, Tom. Let's go look at the sky. I believe these stars are real\nones.\"\n\n\"Close the port!\"\n\nThe door slid shut. A minute's long wait, then the boat released herself\nand shot out into the blackness. The last of the lifeboats was gone.\n\nProfessor Larrabee materialized from the shadows and approached Evans\nwith outstretched hand.\n\n\"Well done, Captain!\"\n\n\"You here? I'd hoped you'd gone with the others.\"\n\n\"What for? My life is over. I've had my pleasures. And this way, I shall\nbe seeing my wife all the sooner. She always loved adventure, and I\nshall tell her all about the Thakura Ripples. Will you join me in a\ndrink, Captain Evans?\"\n\n\"No, thank you.\" His voice broke. \"No. I need to be alone.\" He turned\nand strode away.\n\nIn the privacy of his cabin he buzzed operations.\n\n\"What news, Wyman?\"\n\n\"Slow, steady climb, sir. All piles have passed critical stage.\"\n\nSlowly he replaced the phone, and covered his eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuddled against the wall of boat F, Burl Jasperson stared out of the\nobservation port, his cold eyes intent on the distant, fast receding\nlights of the _Star Lord_. Now that he felt himself to be safe, he was\nweak and exhausted. Beside him sat his secretary, a wizened little man\nwho stared numbly at his clasped hands.\n\nJasperson coughed.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Jasperson?\"\n\n\"Get me a panedol tablet and a glass of water. I don't suppose there's\nany ice, but if there is, put in some ice. I'm thirsty.\"\n\nMeekly the secretary shuffled down the long length of the boat, solitary\nas a ghost, to the cubicle labelled Rations. He was gone a long time,\nthought Burl, and when at last he returned his feet were dragging more\nthan ever.\n\n\"There isn't any water, Mr. Jasperson.\"\n\n\"You idiot! There's got to be water.\"\n\n\"I couldn't find any, Mr. Jasperson.\"\n\n\"Davis!\" he roared. \"Davis, get me a glass of water!\"\n\nDavis looked out from the control room. \"Get it yourself. This isn't the\nship's dining room any more, Jasperson. I've got other things to do now\nthan taking orders from you.\"\n\n\"But I don't know where it is!\"\n\n\"All right. I'll get it for you this time and show you where it's kept,\nbut after this you wait on yourself.\"\n\nLeading the way to Rations, he opened a steel cupboard and reached in.\nSuddenly anxious, he groped about frantically, then cried, \"But there\nisn't any water!\"\n\nJasperson swallowed, with dry throat.\n\n\"There isn't any water?\" he asked plaintively. \"But I'm _thirsty_!\"\n\nAs the hours crawled by, Jasperson sat in the vast emptiness of the boat\nand stared out at the alien stars. He could not bear to look at the long\nrows of empty seats, seats that might have been occupied by living men,\ntwo hundred and forty-seven silent, omnipresent accusers. His eyes were\nglowing coals, his skin sagged in wrinkles over his haggard face, and\nhis voice was a mere croak.\n\n\"Are you _sure_ there's no water?\" he asked again. \"Are you certain?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm certain, as I've told you a thousand times,\" said Steward\nDavis. \"Don't you suppose I'm thirsty too? If you hadn't been in such a\nhurry to sneak away we'd have been all right. That man you shot was\nprobably getting ready to load the water tanks.\"\n\n\"But you told me the boat was all provisioned!\"\n\n\"I thought it was, when I saw the tail-end of that truck! But you didn't\ngive me time to check. Why did you have to be in such a hurry?\"\n\nGroaning, Jasperson turned again to peer at the unfamiliar suns.\n\n\"How long will it take us to reach an inhabited planet, do you think?\"\n\n\"I don't know, because I don't know just where we are. With luck, maybe\na week, maybe two.\"\n\n\"How long can we live without water?\"\n\n\"Longer than you'd think. Twelve to fifteen days if we don't move\naround. We may be able to land somewhere before then. If not--\" His\nvoice rose to a sudden shriek. \"_What good are those twenty-five\nthousand credits going to do me now?_\"\n\nThe secretary sat in numb collapse, but Jasperson prowled the room, up\nand down, up and down, past the rows of empty seats, while Davis sat and\nwatched him with glittering eyes. Jasperson's head was aching, and he\nwas aware, all at once, that he was out of breath, as though he had been\nclimbing a steep hill under a broiling sun.\n\n\"Have to see to this,\" he muttered. \"They can't treat me this way.\"\nStumbling, he lurched down the aisle towards Davis, staggering like a\ndrunken man.\n\n\"Got to have more air, Davis. This won't do.\"\n\nInsolently, Davis got up and looked at the oxygen indicator set in the\nwall.\n\n\"Needle's falling a bit. I'll turn on another tank.\" He touched the\nswitch, then sat down again.\n\nJasperson began to laugh.\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\nWith shaking hand he pointed, laughing harder, his sagging cheeks\nquivering as he roared.\n\n\"It's those chairs! Ever see such silly chairs? The way they sit there,\nand look at you?\"\n\n\"Hey, man, you're drunk! I wonder....\"\n\nHe got up to look at the oxygen dial again. The needle had fallen still\nfurther.\n\n\"Where's that oxygen?\" he shouted. He rushed into the inner compartment\nand was back immediately, his eyes black with terror.\n\n\"No air reserve either! Only that one tank! You great, blundering,\ncondemned fool! A man can live for fifteen days without water, but he\ncan't live ten minutes without air. We're done for!\"\n\nJasperson giggled.\n\nDavis collapsed, and he, too, began to laugh, a helpless, gasping laugh.\nThey had entirely forgotten the self-effacing secretary, but the noise\nof their dying laughter did not disturb him. He had already fallen\nsideways in his chair, and would never wake again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the _Star Lord_, Tom and Dorothy sat in the empty lounge, looking\nthrough the observation port at the real stars that studded the void.\nThey were holding hands. They were not afraid, and there was nothing\nthey needed to say.\n\nSome of the doomed passengers sat in the Bar, drinking steadily. Others\nsat and stared at nothingness. Professor Larrabee lay in his cabin, his\nface turned to the wall, his eyes closed. But he was not sleeping. He\nwas thinking of his wife, and a smile clothed his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn his cabin Captain Josiah Evans waited alone. His hair was almost\nwhite, now, his cheeks were sunken, and all semblance of youth had left\nhim. Knowing the futility of his action, nevertheless he completed the\nday's entry in the ship's log, and closed the volume.\n\nAs the hours crept by he noticed that the temperature in the room was\nrising. Once more, for the last time, he called Operations.\n\n\"It's no use, Wyman. Let the Piles alone. It's only a matter of hours\nnow--or perhaps minutes.\"\n\n\"Shall I cast loose the other Piles, sir?\"\n\n\"No, no use in that, since you can't jettison Piles One, Two and Three.\nWhen they go, we all go. It's impossible, now, that any rescue ship\ncould get to us in time. You've done a good job, Wyman. You are now\nreleased from duty.\"\n\nHis hands were sweating, his whole body was wet from the high summer\ntorridness of the room. Captain Evans wiped his sticky hands on his\nhandkerchief and picked up the little red book, _Ley's Space Ships_.\nOpening the book, he read for the last time the well-loved page. Then he\ntook up his pen and made a new notation in the margin.\n\n\"_Star Lord: Lost, May 26, 2421, on the Thakura Ripples._\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then with firm, steady strokes he wrote the\nfinal entry: \"_Destroyed by the arrogance of her owners, and the\ncriminal pride and weakness of her Captain._\"\n\nHe put down the pen, and laid his head on his desk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHour after hour Boat A circled the dying _Star Lord_, its weary\npassengers tense with hope for the all but impossible rescue. Alan sat\nnext to Tanya, guarding the sleeping children.\n\nSuddenly she sat up. \"What's that? Out there?\"\n\nOver the loudspeaker came Thayer's voice. \"We have successfully made\ncontact with a rescue ship. A space cruiser will reach us in\napproximately eight hours.\"\n\nTanya scarcely heard him. She was still peering out, her eyes on the\nfaint lights of the _Star Lord_.\n\n\"Look!\" she cried.\n\n\"Shut your eyes!\" shouted Thayer. \"Everybody turn your head!\"\n\nFar out in space where the _Star Lord_ had been was a brilliant red\nglow, like many suns. It changed, suddenly, to a blinding light, so\nbright that it was more blue than white, then vanished.\n\nMan had not yet made himself Lord of the Stars.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Star Lord, by Boyd Ellanby\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STAR LORD ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32208.txt or 32208.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/2/0/32208/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
