BEAM PIPER\n\n\nColonel Ashley Hampton chewed his cigar and forced himself to relax, his\nglance slowly traversing the room, lingering on the mosaic of\nbook-spines in the tall cases, the sunlight splashed on the faded pastel\ncolors of the carpet, the soft-tinted autumn landscape outside the\nFrench windows, the trophies of Indian and Filipino and German weapons\non the walls. He could easily feign relaxation here in the library of\n\"Greyrock,\" as long as he looked only at these familiar inanimate\nthings and avoided the five people gathered in the room with him, for\nall of them were enemies.\n\nThere was his nephew, Stephen Hampton, greying at the temples but\nyouthfully dressed in sports-clothes, leaning with obvious if slightly\npremature proprietorship against the fireplace, a whiskey-and-soda in\nhis hand. There was Myra, Stephen's smart, sophisticated-looking blonde\nwife, reclining in a chair beside the desk. For these two, he felt an\nimplacable hatred. The others were no less enemies, perhaps more\ndangerous enemies, but they were only the tools of Stephen and Myra. For\ninstance, T. Barnwell Powell, prim and self-satisfied, sitting on the\nedge of his chair and clutching the briefcase on his lap as though it\nwere a restless pet which might attempt to escape. He was an honest man,\nas lawyers went; painfully ethical. No doubt he had convinced himself\nthat his clients were acting from the noblest and most disinterested\nmotives. And Doctor Alexis Vehrner, with his Vandyke beard and his\nViennese accent as phony as a Soviet-controlled election, who had\npreempted the chair at Colonel Hampton's desk. That rankled the old\nsoldier, but Doctor Vehrner would want to assume the position which\nwould give him appearance of commanding the situation, and he probably\nfelt that Colonel Hampton was no longer the master of \"Greyrock.\" The\nfifth, a Neanderthal type in a white jacket, was Doctor Vehrner's\nattendant and bodyguard; he could be ignored, like an enlisted man\nunthinkingly obeying the orders of a superior.\n\n\"But you are not cooperating, Colonel Hampton,\" the psychiatrist\ncomplained. \"How can I help you if you do not cooperate?\"\n\nColonel Hampton took the cigar from his mouth. His white mustache,\ntinged a faint yellow by habitual smoking, twitched angrily.\n\n\"Oh; you call it helping me, do you?\" he asked acidly.\n\n\"But why else am I here?\" the doctor parried.\n\n\"You're here because my loving nephew and his charming wife can't wait\nto see me buried in the family cemetery; they want to bury me alive in\nthat private Bedlam of yours,\" Colonel Hampton replied.\n\n\"See!\" Myra Hampton turned to the psychiatrist. \"We are _persecuting_\nhim! We are all _envious_ of him! We are _plotting against_ him!\"\n\n\"Of course; this sullen and suspicious silence is a common paranoid\nsymptom; one often finds such symptoms in cases of senile dementia,\"\nDoctor Vehrner agreed.\n\nColonel Hampton snorted contemptuously. Senile dementia! Well, he must\nhave been senile and demented, to bring this pair of snakes into his\nhome, because he felt an obligation to his dead brother's memory. And\nhe'd willed \"Greyrock,\" and his money, and everything, to Stephen. Only\nMyra couldn't wait till he died; she'd Lady-Macbethed her husband into\nthis insanity accusation.\n\n\"... however, I must fully satisfy myself, before I can sign the\ncommitment,\" the psychiatrist was saying. \"After all, the patient is a\nman of advanced age. Seventy-eight, to be exact.\"\n\nSeventy-eight; almost eighty. Colonel Hampton could hardly realize that\nhe had been around so long. He had been a little boy, playing soldiers.\nHe had been a young man, breaking the family tradition of Harvard and\nwangling an appointment to West Point. He had been a new second lieutenant\nat a little post in Wyoming, in the last dying flicker of the Indian Wars.\nHe had been a first lieutenant, trying to make soldiers of militiamen and\nhoping for orders to Cuba before the Spaniards gave up. He had been the\nhard-bitten captain of a hard-bitten company, fighting Moros in the\njungles of Mindanao. Then, through the early years of the Twentieth\nCentury, after his father's death, he had been that _rara avis_ in the\nAmerican service, a really wealthy professional officer. He had played\npolo, and served a turn as military attache at the Paris embassy. He had\ncommanded a regiment in France in 1918, and in the post-war years, had\nrounded out his service in command of a regiment of Negro cavalry, before\nretiring to \"Greyrock.\" Too old for active service, or even a desk at the\nPentagon, he had drilled a Home Guard company of 4-Fs and boys and paunchy\nmiddle-agers through the Second World War. Then he had been an old man,\nsitting alone in the sunlight ... until a wonderful thing had happened.\n\n\"Get him to tell you about this invisible playmate of his,\" Stephen\nsuggested. \"If that won't satisfy you, I don't know what will.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had begun a year ago last June. He had been sitting on a bench on the\neast lawn, watching a kitten playing with a crumpled bit of paper on the\nwalk, circling warily around it as though it were some living prey,\nstalking cautiously, pouncing and striking the paper ball with a paw and\nthen pursuing it madly. The kitten, whose name was Smokeball, was a\nfriend of his; soon she would tire of her game and jump up beside him to\nbe petted.\n\nThen suddenly, he seemed to hear a girl's voice beside him:\n\n\"Oh, what a darling little cat! What's its name?\"\n\n\"Smokeball,\" he said, without thinking. \"She's about the color of a\nshrapnel-burst....\" Then he stopped short, looking about. There was\nnobody in sight, and he realized that the voice had been inside his head\nrather than in his ear.\n\n\"What the devil?\" he asked himself. \"Am I going nuts?\"\n\nThere was a happy little laugh inside of him, like bubbles rising in a\nglass of champagne.\n\n\"Oh, no; I'm really here,\" the voice, inaudible but mentally present,\nassured him. \"You can't see me, or touch me, or even really hear me, but\nI'm not something you just imagined. I'm just as real as ... as\nSmokeball, there. Only I'm a different kind of reality. Watch.\"\n\nThe voice stopped, and something that had seemed to be close to him left\nhim. Immediately, the kitten stopped playing with the crumpled paper and\ncocked her head to one side, staring fixedly as at something above her.\nHe'd seen cats do that before--stare wide-eyed and entranced, as though\nat something wonderful which was hidden from human eyes. Then, still\nlooking up and to the side, Smokeball trotted over and jumped onto his\nlap, but even as he stroked her, she was looking at an invisible\nsomething beside him. At the same time, he had a warm and pleasant\nfeeling, as of a happy and affectionate presence near him.\n\n\"No,\" he said, slowly and judicially. \"That's not just my imagination.\nBut who--or what--are you?\"\n\n\"I'm.... Oh, I don't know how to think it so that you'll understand.\"\nThe voice inside his head seemed baffled, like a physicist trying to\nexplain atomic energy to a Hottentot. \"I'm not material. If you can\nimagine a mind that doesn't need a brain to think with.... Oh, I can't\nexplain it now! But when I'm talking to you, like this, I'm really\nthinking inside your brain, along with your own mind, and you hear the\nwords without there being any sound. And you just don't know any words\nthat would express it.\"\n\nHe had never thought much, one way or another, about spiritualism. There\nhad been old people, when he had been a boy, who had told stories of\nghosts and apparitions, with the firmest conviction that they were true.\nAnd there had been an Irishman, in his old company in the Philippines,\nwho swore that the ghost of a dead comrade walked post with him when he\nwas on guard.\n\n\"Are you a spirit?\" he asked. \"I mean, somebody who once lived in a\nbody, like me?\"\n\n\"N-no.\" The voice inside him seemed doubtful. \"That is, I don't think\nso. I know about spirits; they're all around, everywhere. But I don't\nthink I'm one. At least, I've always been like I am now, as long as I\ncan remember. Most spirits don't seem to sense me. I can't reach most\nliving people, either; their minds are closed to me, or they have such\ndisgusting minds I can't bear to touch them. Children are open to me,\nbut when they tell their parents about me, they are laughed at, or\npunished for lying, and then they close up against me. You're the first\ngrown-up person I've been able to reach for a long time.\"\n\n\"Probably getting into my second childhood,\" Colonel Hampton grunted.\n\n\"Oh, but you mustn't be ashamed of that!\" the invisible entity told him.\n\"That's the beginning of real wisdom--becoming childlike again. One of\nyour religious teachers said something like that, long ago, and a long\ntime before that, there was a Chinaman whom people called Venerable\nChild, because his wisdom had turned back again to a child's\nsimplicity.\"\n\n\"That was Lao Tze,\" Colonel Hampton said, a little surprised. \"Don't\ntell me you've been around that long.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I have! Longer than that; oh, for very long.\" And yet the voice\nhe seemed to be hearing was the voice of a young girl. \"You don't mind\nmy coming to talk to you?\" it continued. \"I get so lonely, so dreadfully\nlonely, you see.\"\n\n\"Urmh! So do I,\" Colonel Hampton admitted. \"I'm probably going bats, but\nwhat the hell? It's a nice way to go bats, I'll say that.... Stick\naround; whoever you are, and let's get acquainted. I sort of like you.\"\n\nA feeling of warmth suffused him, as though he had been hugged by\nsomeone young and happy and loving.\n\n\"Oh, I'm glad. I like you, too; you're nice!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" Doctor Vehrner nodded sagely. \"That is a schizoid\ntendency; the flight from reality into a dream-world peopled by\ncreatures of the imagination. You understand, there is usually a mixture\nof psychotic conditions, in cases like this. We will say that this case\nbegins with simple senile dementia--physical brain degeneration, a\nresult of advanced age. Then the paranoid symptoms appear; he imagines\nhimself surrounded by envious enemies, who are conspiring against him.\nThe patient then withdraws into himself, and in his self-imposed\nisolation, he conjures up imaginary companionship. I have no doubt....\"\n\nIn the beginning, he had suspected that this unseen visitor was no more\nthan a figment of his own lonely imagination, but as the days passed,\nthis suspicion vanished. Whatever this entity might be, an entity it\nwas, entirely distinct from his own conscious or subconscious mind.\n\nAt first she--he had early come to think of the being as feminine--had\nseemed timid, fearful lest her intrusions into his mind prove a\nnuisance. It took some time for him to assure her that she was always\nwelcome. With time, too, his impression of her grew stronger and more\nconcrete. He found that he was able to visualize her, as he might\nvisualize something remembered, or conceived of in imagination--a lovely\nyoung girl, slender and clothed in something loose and filmy, with\nflowers in her honey-colored hair, and clear blue eyes, a pert, cheerful\nface, a wide, smiling mouth and an impudently up-tilted nose. He\nrealized that this image was merely a sort of allegorical\nrepresentation, his own private object-abstraction from a reality which\nhis senses could never picture as it existed.\n\nIt was about this time that he had begun to call her Dearest. She had\ngiven him no name, and seemed quite satisfied with that one.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" she said, \"I ought to have a name for you, too. Do\nyou mind if I call you Popsy?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" He had been really startled at that. If he needed any further\nproof of Dearest's independent existence, that was it. Never, in the\nuttermost depths of his subconscious, would he have been likely to label\nhimself Popsy. \"Know what they used to call me in the Army?\" he asked.\n\"Slaughterhouse Hampton. They claimed I needed a truckload of sawdust to\nfollow me around and cover up the blood.\" He chuckled. \"Nobody but you\nwould think of calling me Popsy.\"\n\nThere was a price, he found, that he must pay for Dearest's\ncompanionship--the price of eternal vigilance. He found that he was\nacquiring the habit of opening doors and then needlessly standing aside\nto allow her to precede him. And, although she insisted that he need not\nspeak aloud to her, that she could understand any thought which he\ndirected to her, he could not help actually pronouncing the words, if\nonly in a faint whisper. He was glad that he had learned, before the end\nof his plebe year at West Point, to speak without moving his lips.\n\nBesides himself and the kitten, Smokeball, there was one other at\n\"Greyrock\" who was aware, if only faintly, of Dearest's presence. That\nwas old Sergeant Williamson, the Colonel's Negro servant, a retired\nfirst sergeant from the regiment he had last commanded. With increasing\nfrequency, he would notice the old Negro pause in his work, as though\ntrying to identify something too subtle for his senses, and then shake\nhis head in bewilderment.\n\nOne afternoon in early October--just about a year ago--he had been\nreclining in a chair on the west veranda, smoking a cigar and trying to\nre-create, for his companion, a mental picture of an Indian camp as he\nhad seen it in Wyoming in the middle '90's, when Sergeant Williamson\ncame out from the house, carrying a pair of the Colonel's field-boots\nand a polishing-kit. Unaware of the Colonel's presence, he set down his\nburden, squatted on the floor and began polishing the boots, humming\nsoftly to himself. Then he must have caught a whiff of the Colonel's\ncigar. Raising his head, he saw the Colonel, and made as though to pick\nup the boots and polishing equipment.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Sergeant,\" the Colonel told him. \"Carry on with\nwhat you're doing. There's room enough for both of us here.\"\n\n\"Yessuh; thank yo', suh.\" The old ex-sergeant resumed his soft humming,\nkeeping time with the brush in his hand.\n\n\"You know, Popsy, I think he knows I'm here,\" Dearest said. \"Nothing\ndefinite, of course; he just feels there's something here that he can't\nsee.\"\n\n\"I wonder. I've noticed something like that. Funny, he doesn't seem to\nmind, either. Colored people are usually scary about ghosts and spirits\nand the like.... I'm going to ask him.\" He raised his voice. \"Sergeant,\ndo you seem to notice anything peculiar around here, lately?\"\n\nThe repetitious little two-tone melody broke off short. The\nsoldier-servant lifted his face and looked into the Colonel's. His brow\nwrinkled, as though he were trying to express a thought for which he had\nno words.\n\n\"Yo' notice dat, too, suh?\" he asked. \"Why, yessuh, Cunnel; Ah don' know\n'zackly how t' say hit, but dey is som'n, at dat. Hit seems like ...\nlike a kinda ... a kinda _blessedness_.\" He chuckled. \"Dat's hit,\nCunnel; dey's a blessedness. Wondeh iffen Ah's gittin' r'ligion, now?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, all this is very interesting, I'm sure, Doctor,\" T. Barnwell\nPowell was saying, polishing his glasses on a piece of tissue and\nkeeping one elbow on his briefcase at the same time. \"But really, it's\nnot getting us anywhere, so to say. You know, we must have that\ncommitment signed by you. Now, is it or is it not your opinion that this\nman is of unsound mind?\"\n\n\"Now, have patience, Mr. Powell,\" the psychiatrist soothed him. \"You\nmust admit that as long as this gentleman refuses to talk, I cannot be\nsaid to have interviewed him.\"\n\n\"What if he won't talk?\" Stephen Hampton burst out. \"We've told you\nabout his behavior; how he sits for hours mumbling to this imaginary\nperson he thinks is with him, and how he always steps aside when he\nopens a door, to let somebody who isn't there go through ahead of him,\nand how.... Oh, hell, what's the use? If he were in his right mind, he'd\nspeak up and try to prove it, wouldn't he? What do you say, Myra?\"\n\nMyra was silent, and Colonel Hampton found himself watching her with\ninterest. Her mouth had twisted into a wry grimace, and she was\nclutching the arms of her chair until her knuckles whitened. She seemed\nto be in some intense pain. Colonel Hampton hoped she were; preferably\nwith something slightly fatal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSergeant Williamson's suspicion that he might be getting religion became\na reality, for a time, that winter, after The Miracle.\n\nIt had been a blustery day in mid-January, with a high wind driving\nswirls of snow across the fields, and Colonel Hampton, fretting indoors\nfor several days, decided to go out and fill his lungs with fresh air.\nBundled warmly, swinging his blackthorn cane, he had set out,\naccompanied by Dearest, to tramp cross-country to the village, three\nmiles from \"Greyrock.\" They had enjoyed the walk through the white\nwind-swept desolation, the old man and his invisible companion, until\nthe accident had happened.\n\nA sheet of glassy ice had lain treacherously hidden under a skift of\nsnow; when he stepped upon it, his feet shot from under him, the stick\nflew from his hand, and he went down. When he tried to rise, he found\nthat he could not. Dearest had been almost frantic.\n\n\"Oh, Popsy, you must get up!\" she cried. \"You'll freeze if you don't.\nCome on, Popsy; try again!\"\n\nHe tried, in vain. His old body would not obey his will.\n\n\"It's no use, Dearest; I can't. Maybe it's just as well,\" he said.\n\"Freezing's an easy death, and you say people live on as spirits, after\nthey die. Maybe we can always be together, now.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't want you to die yet, Popsy. I never was able to\nget through to a spirit, and I'm afraid.... Wait! Can you crawl a\nlittle? Enough to get over under those young pines?\"\n\n\"I think so.\" His left leg was numb, and he believed that it was broken.\n\"I can try.\"\n\nHe managed to roll onto his back, with his head toward the clump of pine\nseedlings. Using both hands and his right heel, he was able to propel\nhimself slowly through the snow until he was out of the worst of the\nwind.\n\n\"That's good; now try to cover yourself,\" Dearest advised. \"Put your\nhands in your coat pockets. And wait here; I'll try to get help.\"\n\nThen she left him. For what seemed a long time, he lay motionless in the\nscant protection of the young pines, suffering miserably. He began to\ngrow drowsy. As soon as he realized what was happening, he was\nfrightened, and the fright pulled him awake again. Soon he felt himself\ndrowsing again. By shifting his position, he caused a jab of pain from\nhis broken leg, which brought him back to wakefulness. Then the deadly\ndrowsiness returned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time, he was wakened by a sharp voice, mingled with a throbbing\nsound that seemed part of a dream of the cannonading in the Argonne.\n\n\"Dah! Look-a dah!\" It was, he realized, Sergeant Williamson's voice.\n\"Gittin' soft in de haid, is Ah, yo' ol' wuthless no-'count?\"\n\nHe turned his face, to see the battered jeep from \"Greyrock,\" driven by\nArthur, the stableman and gardener, with Sergeant Williamson beside him.\nThe older Negro jumped to the ground and ran toward him. At the same\ntime, he felt Dearest with him again.\n\n\"We made it, Popsy! We made it!\" she was exulting. \"I was afraid I'd\nnever make him understand, but I did. And you should have seen him bully\nthat other man into driving the jeep. Are you all right, Popsy?\"\n\n\"Is yo' all right, Cunnel?\" Sergeant Williamson was asking.\n\n\"My leg's broken, I think, but outside of that I'm all right,\" he\nanswered both of them. \"How did you happen to find me, Sergeant?\"\n\nThe old Negro soldier rolled his eyes upward. \"Cunnel, hit war a mi'acle\nof de blessed Lawd!\" he replied, solemnly. \"An angel of de Lawd done\nappeahed unto me.\" He shook his head slowly. \"Ah's a sinful man, Cunnel;\nAh couldn't see de angel face to face, but de glory of de angel was\nbefoh me, an' guided me.\"\n\nThey used his cane and a broken-off bough to splint the leg; they\nwrapped him in a horse-blanket and hauled him back to \"Greyrock\" and put\nhim to bed, with Dearest clinging solicitously to him. The fractured leg\nknit slowly, though the physician was amazed at the speed with which,\nconsidering his age, he made recovery, and with his unfailing\ncheerfulness. He did not know, of course, that he was being assisted by\nan invisible nurse. For all that, however, the leaves on the oaks around\n\"Greyrock\" were green again before Colonel Hampton could leave his bed\nand hobble about the house on a cane.\n\nArthur, the young Negro who had driven the jeep, had become one of the\nmost solid pillars of the little A.M.E. church beyond the village, as a\nresult. Sergeant Williamson had also become an attendant at church for a\nwhile, and then stopped. Without being able to define, or spell, or even\npronounce the term, Sergeant Williamson was a strict pragmatist. Most\nAfricans are, even five generations removed from the slave-ship that\nbrought their forefathers from the Dark Continent. And Sergeant\nWilliamson could not find the blessedness at the church. Instead, it\nseemed to center about the room where his employer and former regiment\ncommander lay. That, to his mind, was quite reasonable. If an Angel of\nthe Lord was going to tarry upon earth, the celestial being would\nnaturally prefer the society of a retired U.S.A. colonel to that of a\npassel of triflin', no-'counts at an ol' clapboard church house. Be that\nas it may, he could always find the blessedness in Colonel Hampton's\nroom, and sometimes, when the Colonel would be asleep, the blessedness\nwould follow him out and linger with him for a while.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Hampton wondered, anxiously, where Dearest was, now. He had not\nfelt her presence since his nephew had brought his lawyer and the\npsychiatrist into the house. He wondered if she had voluntarily\nseparated herself from him for fear he might give her some sign of\nrecognition that these harpies would fasten upon as an evidence of\nunsound mind. He could not believe that she had deserted him entirely,\nnow when he needed her most....\n\n\"Well, what can I do?\" Doctor Vehrner was complaining. \"You bring me\nhere to interview him, and he just sits there and does nothing.... Will\nyou consent to my giving him an injection of sodium pentathol?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, now,\" T. Barnwell Powell objected. \"I've heard of\nthat drug--one of the so-called 'truth-serum' drugs. I doubt if\ntestimony taken under its influence would be admissible in a court....\"\n\n\"This is not a court, Mr. Powell,\" the doctor explained patiently. \"And\nI am not taking testimony; I am making a diagnosis. Pentathol is a\nrecognized diagnostic agent.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Stephen Hampton said. \"Anything to get this over with....\nYou agree, Myra?\"\n\nMyra said nothing. She simply sat, with staring eyes, and clutched the\narms of her chair as though to keep from slipping into some dreadful\nabyss. Once a low moan escaped from her lips.\n\n\"My wife is naturally overwrought by this painful business,\" Stephen\nsaid. \"I trust that you gentlemen will excuse her.... Hadn't you better\ngo and lie down somewhere, Myra?\"\n\nShe shook her head violently, moaning again. Both the doctor and the\nattorney were looking at her curiously.\n\n\"Well, I object to being drugged,\" Colonel Hampton said, rising. \"And\nwhat's more, I won't submit to it.\"\n\n\"Albert!\" Doctor Vehrner said sharply, nodding toward the Colonel. The\npithecanthropoid attendant in the white jacket hastened forward, pinned\nhis arms behind him and dragged him down into the chair. For an instant,\nthe old man tried to resist, then, realizing the futility and undignity\nof struggling, subsided. The psychiatrist had taken a leather case from\nhis pocket and was selecting a hypodermic needle.\n\nThen Myra Hampton leaped to her feet, her face working hideously.\n\n\"No! Stop! Stop!\" she cried.\n\nEverybody looked at her in surprise, Colonel Hampton no less than the\nothers. Stephen Hampton called out her name sharply.\n\n\"No! You shan't do this to me! You shan't! You're torturing me! you are\nall devils!\" she screamed. \"Devils! _Devils!_\"\n\n\"Myra!\" her husband barked, stepping forward.\n\nWith a twist, she eluded him, dashing around the desk and pulling open a\ndrawer.\n\nFor an instant, she fumbled inside it, and when she brought her hand up,\nshe had Colonel Hampton's .45 automatic in it. She drew back the slide\nand released it, loading the chamber.\n\nDoctor Vehrner, the hypodermic in his hand, turned. Stephen Hampton\nsprang at her, dropping his drink. And Albert, the prognathous\nattendant, released Colonel Hampton and leaped at the woman with the\npistol, with the unthinking promptness of a dog whose master is in\ndanger.\n\nStephen Hampton was the closest to her; she shot him first, point-blank\nin the chest. The heavy bullet knocked him backward against a small\ntable; he and it fell over together. While he was falling, the woman\nturned, dipped the muzzle of her pistol slightly and fired again; Doctor\nVehrner's leg gave way under him and he went down, the hypodermic flying\nfrom his hand and landing at Colonel Hampton's feet. At the same time,\nthe attendant, Albert, was almost upon her. Quickly, she reversed the\nheavy Colt, pressed the muzzle against her heart, and fired a third\nshot.\n\nT. Barnwell Powell had let the briefcase slip to the floor; he was\nstaring, slack-jawed, at the tableau of violence which had been enacted\nbefore him. The attendant, having reached Myra, was looking down at her\nstupidly. Then he stooped, and straightened.\n\n\"She's dead!\" he said, unbelievingly.\n\nColonel Hampton rose, putting his heel on the hypodermic and crushing\nit.\n\n\"Of course she's dead!\" he barked. \"You have any first-aid training?\nThen look after these other people. Doctor Vehrner first; the other\nman's unconscious; he'll wait.\"\n\n\"No; look after the other man first,\" Doctor Vehrner said.\n\nAlbert gaped back and forth between them.\n\n\"Goddammit, you heard me!\" Colonel Hampton roared. It was Slaughterhouse\nHampton, whose service-ribbons started with the Indian campaigns,\nspeaking; an officer who never for an instant imagined that his orders\nwould not be obeyed. \"Get a tourniquet on that man's leg, you!\" He\nmoderated his voice and manner about half a degree and spoke to Vehrner.\n\"You are not the doctor, you're the patient, now. You'll do as you're\ntold. Don't you know that a man shot in the leg with a .45 can bleed to\ndeath without half trying?\"\n\n\"Yo'-all do like de Cunnel says, 'r foh Gawd, yo'-all gwine wish yo'\nhad,\" Sergeant Williamson said, entering the room. \"Git a move on.\"\n\nHe stood just inside the doorway, holding a silver-banded malacca\nwalking-stick that he had taken from the hall-stand. He was grasping it\nin his left hand, below the band, with the crook out, holding it at his\nside as though it were a sword in a scabbard, which was exactly what\nthat walking-stick was. Albert looked at him, and then back at Colonel\nHampton. Then, whipping off his necktie, he went down on his knees\nbeside Doctor Vehrner, skillfully applying the improvised tourniquet,\ntwisting it tight with an eighteen-inch ruler the Colonel took from the\ndesk and handed to him.\n\n\"Go get the first-aid kit, Sergeant,\" the Colonel said. \"And hurry. Mr.\nStephen's been shot, too.\"\n\n\"Yessuh!\" Sergeant Williamson executed an automatic salute and\nabout-face and raced from the room. The Colonel picked up the telephone\non the desk.\n\nThe County Hospital was three miles from \"Greyrock\"; the State Police\nsubstation a good five. He dialed the State Police number first.\n\n\"Sergeant Mallard? Colonel Hampton, at 'Greyrock.' We've had a little\ntrouble here. My nephew's wife just went _juramentado_ with one of my\npistols, shot and wounded her husband and another man, and then shot and\nkilled herself.... Yes, indeed it is, Sergeant. I wish you'd send\nsomebody over here, as soon as possible, to take charge.... Oh, you\nwill? That's good.... No, it's all over, and nobody to arrest; just the\nformalities.... Well, thank you, Sergeant.\"\n\nThe old Negro cavalryman re-entered the room, without the sword-cane and\ncarrying a heavy leather box on a strap over his shoulder. He set this\non the floor and opened it, then knelt beside Stephen Hampton. The\nColonel was calling the hospital.\n\n\"... gunshot wounds,\" he was saying. \"One man in the chest and the other\nin the leg, both with a .45 pistol. And you'd better send a doctor who's\nqualified to write a death certificate; there was a woman killed,\ntoo.... Yes, certainly; the State Police have been notified.\"\n\n\"Dis ain' so bad, Cunnel,\" Sergeant Williamson raised his head to say.\n\"Ah's seen men shot wuss'n dis dat was ma'ked 'Duty' inside a month,\nsuh.\"\n\nColonel Hampton nodded. \"Well, get him fixed up as best you can, till\nthe ambulance gets here. And there's whiskey and glasses on that table,\nover there. Better give Doctor Vehrner a drink.\" He looked at T.\nBarnwell Powell, still frozen to his chair, aghast at the carnage around\nhim. \"And give Mr. Powell a drink, too. He needs one.\"\n\nHe did, indeed. Colonel Hampton could have used a drink, too; the\nlibrary looked like beef-day at an Indian agency. But he was still\nSlaughterhouse Hampton, and consequently could not afford to exhibit\nqueasiness.\n\nIt was then, for the first time since the business had started that he\nfelt the presence of Dearest.\n\n\"Oh, Popsy, are you all right?\" the voice inside his head was asking.\n\"It's all over, now; you won't have anything to worry about, any more.\nBut, oh, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do it!\"\n\n\"My God, Dearest!\" He almost spoke aloud. \"Did you make her do that?\"\n\n\"Popsy!\" The voice in his mind was grief-stricken. \"You.... You're\nafraid of me! Never be afraid of Dearest, Popsy! And don't hate me for\nthis. It was the only thing I could do. If he'd given you that\ninjection, he could have made you tell him all about us, and then he'd\nhave been sure you were crazy, and they'd have taken you away. And they\ntreat people dreadfully at that place of his. You'd have been driven\nreally crazy before long, and then your mind would have been closed to\nme, so that I wouldn't have been able to get through to you, any more.\nWhat I did was the only thing I could do.\"\n\n\"I don't hate you, Dearest,\" he replied, mentally. \"And I don't blame\nyou. It was a little disconcerting, though, to discover the extent of\nyour capabilities.... How did you manage it?\"\n\n\"You remember how I made the Sergeant see an angel, the time you were\ndown in the snow?\" Colonel Hampton nodded. \"Well, I made her see ...\nthings that weren't angels,\" Dearest continued. \"After I'd driven her\nalmost to distraction, I was able to get into her mind and take control\nof her.\" Colonel Hampton felt a shudder inside of him. \"That was\nhorrible; that woman had a mind like a sewer; I still feel dirty from\nit! But I made her get the pistol--I knew where you kept it--and I knew\nhow to use it, even if she didn't. Remember when we were shooting\nmuskrats, that time, along the river?\"\n\n\"Uhuh. I wondered how she knew enough to unlock the action and load the\nchamber.\" He turned and faced the others.\n\nDoctor Vehrner was sitting on the floor, with his back to the chair\nColonel Hampton had occupied, his injured leg stretched out in front of\nhim. Albert was hovering over him with mother-hen solicitude. T.\nBarnwell Powell was finishing his whiskey and recovering a fraction of\nhis normal poise.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you gentlemen see, now, who was really crazy around\nhere?\" Colonel Hampton addressed them bitingly. \"That woman has been\ndangerously close to the borderline of sanity for as long as she's been\nhere. I think my precious nephew trumped up this ridiculous insanity\ncomplaint against me as much to discredit any testimony I might ever\ngive about his wife's mental condition as because he wanted to get\ncontrol of my estate. I also suppose that the tension she was under\nhere, this afternoon, was too much for her, and the scheme boomeranged\non its originators. Curious case of poetic justice, but I'm sorry you\nhad to be included in it, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Attaboy, Popsy!\" Dearest enthused. \"Now you have them on the run; don't\ngive them a chance to re-form. You know what Patton always said--Grab\n'em by the nose and kick 'em in the pants.\"\n\nColonel Hampton re-lighted his cigar. \"Patton only said 'pants' when he\nwas talking for publication,\" he told her, _sotto voce_. Then he noticed\nthe unsigned commitment paper lying on the desk. He picked it up,\ncrumpled it, and threw it into the fire.\n\n\"I don't think you'll be needing that,\" he said. \"You know, this isn't\nthe first time my loving nephew has expressed doubts as to my sanity.\"\nHe sat down in the chair at the desk, motioning to his servant to bring\nhim a drink. \"And see to the other gentlemen's glasses, Sergeant,\" he\ndirected. \"Back in 1929, Stephen thought I was crazy as a bedbug to sell\nall my securities and take a paper loss, around the first of September.\nAfter October 24th, I bought them back at about twenty per cent of what\nI'd sold them for, after he'd lost his shirt.\" That, he knew, would have\nan effect on T. Barnwell Powell. \"And in December, 1944, I was just\nplain nuts, selling all my munition shares and investing in a company\nthat manufactured baby-food. Stephen thought that Rundstedt's Ardennes\ncounter-offensive would put off the end of the war for another year and\na half!\"\n\n\"Baby-food, eh?\" Doctor Vehrner chuckled.\n\nColonel Hampton sipped his whiskey slowly, then puffed on his cigar.\n\"No, this pair were competent liars,\" he replied. \"A good workmanlike\nliar never makes up a story out of the whole cloth; he always takes a\nfabric of truth and embroiders it to suit the situation.\" He smiled\ngrimly; that was an accurate description of his own tactical procedure\nat the moment. \"I hadn't intended this to come out, Doctor, but it\nhappens that I am a convinced believer in spiritualism. I suppose you'll\nthink that's a delusional belief, too?\"\n\n\"Well....\" Doctor Vehrner pursed his lips. \"I reject the idea of\nsurvival after death, myself, but I think that people who believe in\nsuch a theory are merely misevaluating evidence. It is definitely not,\nin itself, a symptom of a psychotic condition.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor.\" The Colonel gestured with his cigar. \"Now, I'll\nadmit their statements about my appearing to be in conversation with\nsome invisible or imaginary being. That's all quite true. I'm convinced\nthat I'm in direct-voice communication with the spirit of a young girl\nwho was killed by Indians in this section about a hundred and\nseventy-five years ago. At first, she communicated by automatic writing;\nlater we established direct-voice communication. Well, naturally, a man\nin my position would dislike the label of spirit-medium; there\nare too many invidious associations connected with the term. But there\nit is. I trust both of you gentlemen will remember the ethics of your\nrespective professions and keep this confidential.\"\n\n\"Oh, brother!\" Dearest was fairly hugging him with delight. \"When bigger\nand better lies are told, we tell them, don't we, Popsy?\"\n\n\"Yes, and try and prove otherwise,\" Colonel Hampton replied, around his\ncigar. Then he blew a jet of smoke and spoke to the men in front of him.\n\n\"I intend paying for my nephew's hospitalization, and for his wife's\nfuneral,\" he said. \"And then, I'm going to pack up all his personal\nbelongings, and all of hers; when he's discharged from the hospital,\nI'll ship them wherever he wants them. But he won't be allowed to come\nback here. After this business, I'm through with him.\"\n\nT. Barnwell Powell nodded primly. \"I don't blame you, in the least,\nColonel,\" he said. \"I think you have been abominably treated, and your\nattitude is most generous.\" He was about to say something else, when the\ndoorbell tinkled and Sergeant Williamson went out into the hall. \"Oh,\ndear; I suppose that's the police, now,\" the lawyer said. He grimaced\nlike a small boy in a dentist's chair.\n\nColonel Hampton felt Dearest leave him for a moment. Then she was back.\n\n\"The ambulance.\" Then he caught a sparkle of mischief in her mood.\n\"Let's have some fun, Popsy! The doctor is a young man, with brown hair\nand a mustache, horn-rimmed glasses, a blue tie and a tan-leather bag.\nOne of the ambulance men has red hair, and the other has a\nmercurochrome-stain on his left sleeve. Tell them your spirit-guide told\nyou.\"\n\nThe old soldier's tobacco-yellowed mustache twitched with amusement.\n\n\"No, gentlemen, it is the ambulance,\" he corrected. \"My spirit-control\nsays....\" He relayed Dearest's descriptions to them.\n\nT. Barnwell Powell blinked. A speculative look came into the\npsychiatrist's eyes; he was probably wishing the commitment paper hadn't\nbeen destroyed.\n\nThen the doctor came bustling in, brown-mustached, blue-tied,\nspectacled, carrying a tan bag, and behind him followed the two\nambulance men, one with a thatch of flaming red hair and the other with\na stain of mercurochrome on his jacket-sleeve.\n\nFor an instant, the lawyer and the psychiatrist gaped at them. Then T.\nBarnwell Powell put one hand to his mouth and made a small gibbering\nsound, and Doctor Vehrner gave a faint squawk, and then both men\ngrabbed, simultaneously, for the whiskey bottle.\n\nThe laughter of Dearest tinkled inaudibly through the rumbling mirth of\nColonel Hampton.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED\n\nIn the text: \"... a man in my position would dislike the label of\nspirit-medium;\" the word \"meduim\" was corrected to \"medium.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dearest, by Henry Beam Piper\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEAREST ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19102.txt or 19102.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/1/0/19102/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geetu Melwani, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
