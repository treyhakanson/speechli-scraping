He tucked\nhis railroader's watch back in his vest pocket. \"You better get\naboard--if you're still set on going.\"\n\n\"It was reading all them books done it,\" Aunt Haicey said. \"Thick books,\nand no pictures in them. I knew it'd make trouble.\" She plucked at the\nfaded hand-embroidered shawl over her thin shoulders, a tiny bird-like\nwoman with bright anxious eyes.\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" Brett said. \"I'll be back.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The place'll be yours when I'm gone,\" Aunt Haicey said. \"Lord knows it\nwon't be long.\"\n\n\"Why don't you change your mind and stay on, boy?\" Mr. Phillips said,\nblinking up at the young man. \"If I talk to Mr. J.D., I think he can\nfind a job for you at the plant.\"\n\n\"So many young people leave Casperton,\" Aunt Haicey said. \"They never\ncome back.\"\n\nMr. Phillips clicked his teeth. \"They write, at first,\" he said. \"Then\nthey gradually lose touch.\"\n\n\"All your people are here, Brett,\" Aunt Haicey said. \"Haven't you been\nhappy here?\"\n\n\"Why can't you young folks be content with Casperton?\" Mr. Phillips\nsaid. \"There's everything you need here.\"\n\n\"It's that Pretty-Lee done it,\" Aunt Haicey said. \"If it wasn't for that\ngirl--\"\n\nA clatter ran down the line of cars. Brett kissed Aunt Haicey's dry\ncheek, shook Mr. Phillips' hand, and swung aboard. His suitcase was on\none of the seats. He put it up above in the rack, and sat down, turned\nto wave back at the two old people.\n\nIt was a summer morning. Brett leaned back and watched the country slide\nby. It was nice country, Brett thought; mostly in corn, some cattle, and\naway in the distance the hazy blue hills. Now he would see what was on\nthe other side of them: the cities, the mountains, and the ocean. Up\nuntil now all he knew about anything outside of Casperton was what he'd\nread or seen pictures of. As far as he was concerned, chopping wood and\nmilking cows back in Casperton, they might as well not have existed.\nThey were just words and pictures printed on paper. But he didn't want\nto just read about them. He wanted to see for himself.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nPretty-Lee hadn't come to see him off. She was probably still mad about\nyesterday. She had been sitting at the counter at the Club Rexall,\ndrinking a soda and reading a movie magazine with a big picture of an\nimpossibly pretty face on the cover--the kind you never see just walking\ndown the street. He had taken the next stool and ordered a coke.\n\n\"Why don't you read something good, instead of that pap?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Something good? You mean something dry, I guess. And don't call it ...\nthat word. It doesn't sound polite.\"\n\n\"What does it say? That somebody named Doll Starr is fed up with glamor\nand longs for a simple home in the country and lots of kids? Then why\ndoesn't she move to Casperton?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand,\" said Pretty-Lee.\n\nHe took the magazine, leafed through it. \"Look at this: all about\npeople who give parties that cost thousands of dollars, and fly all over\nthe world having affairs with each other and committing suicide and\ngetting divorced. It's like reading about Martians.\"\n\n\"I still like to read about the stars. There's nothing wrong with it.\"\n\n\"Reading all that junk just makes you dissatisfied. You want to do your\nhair up crazy like the pictures in the magazines and wear weird-looking\nclothes--\"\n\nPretty-Lee bent her straw double. She stood up and took her shopping\nbag. \"I'm very glad to know you think my clothes are weird--\"\n\n\"You're taking everything I say personally. Look.\" He showed her a\nfull-color advertisement on the back cover of the magazine. \"Look at\nthis. Here's a man supposed to be cooking steaks on some kind of\nback-yard grill. He looks like a movie star; he's dressed up like he was\ngoing to get married; there's not a wrinkle anywhere. There's not a spot\non that apron. There isn't even a grease spot on the frying pan. The\nlawn is as smooth as a billiard table. There's his son; he looks just\nlike his pop, except that he's not grey at the temples. Did you ever\nreally see a man that handsome, or hair that was just silver over the\nears and the rest glossy black? The daughter looks like a movie starlet,\nand her mom is exactly the same, except that she has that grey streak in\nfront to match her husband. You can see the car in the drive; the treads\nof the tires must have just been scrubbed; they're not even dusty.\nThere's not a pebble out of place; all the flowers are in full bloom; no\ndead ones. No leaves on the lawn; no dry twigs showing on the trees.\nThat other house in the background looks like a palace, and the man with\nthe rake, looking over the fence: he looks like this one's twin brother,\nand he's out raking leaves in brand new clothes--\"\n\nPretty-Lee grabbed her magazine. \"You just seem to hate everything\nthat's nicer than this messy town--\"\n\n\"I don't think it's nicer. I like you; your hair isn't always perfectly\nsmooth, and you've got a mended place on your dress, and you feel human,\nyou smell human--\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Pretty-Lee turned and flounced out of the drug store.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett shifted in the dusty plush seat and looked around. There were a\nfew other people in the car. An old man was reading a newspaper; two old\nladies whispered together. There was a woman of about thirty with a\nmean-looking kid; and some others. They didn't look like magazine\npictures, any of them. He tried to picture them doing the things you\nread in newspapers: the old ladies putting poison in somebody's tea; the\nold man giving orders to start a war. He thought about babies in houses\nin cities, and airplanes flying over, and bombs falling down: huge\nexplosive bombs. Blam! Buildings fall in, pieces of glass and stone fly\nthrough the air. The babies are blown up along with everything else--\n\nBut the kind of people he knew couldn't do anything like that. They\nliked to loaf and eat and talk and drink beer and buy a new tractor or\nrefrigerator and go fishing. And if they ever got mad and hit\nsomebody--afterwards they were embarrassed and wanted to shake hands....\n\nThe train slowed, came to a shuddery stop. Through the window he saw a\ncardboardy-looking building with the words BAXTER'S JUNCTION painted\nacross it. There were a few faded posters on a bulletin board. An old\nman was sitting on a bench, waiting. The two old ladies got off and a\nboy in blue jeans got on. The train started up. Brett folded his jacket\nand tucked it under his head and tried to doze off....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBrett awoke, yawned, sat up. The train was slowing. He remembered you\ncouldn't use the toilets while the train was stopped. He got up and went\nto the end of the car. The door was jammed. He got it open and went\ninside and closed the door behind him. The train was going slower,\nclack-clack ... clack-clack ... clack; clack ... cuh-lack ...\n\nHe washed his hands, then pulled at the door. It was stuck. He pulled\nharder. The handle was too small; it was hard to get hold of. The train\ncame to a halt. Brett braced himself and strained against the door. It\ndidn't budge.\n\nHe looked out the grimy window. The sun was getting lower. It was about\nthree-thirty, he guessed. He couldn't see anything but some dry-looking\nfields.\n\nOutside in the corridor there were footsteps. He started to call, but\nthen didn't. It would be too embarrassing, pounding on the door and\nyelling, \"Let me out! I'm stuck in the toilet ...\"\n\nHe tried to rattle the door. It didn't rattle. Somebody was dragging\nsomething heavy past the door. Mail bags, maybe. He'd better yell. But\ndammit, the door couldn't be all that hard to open. He studied the\nlatch. All he had to do was turn it. He got a good grip and twisted.\nNothing.\n\nHe heard the mail bag bump-bump, and then another one. To heck with it;\nhe'd yell. He'd wait until he heard the footsteps pass the door again\nand then he'd make some noise.\n\nBrett waited. It was quiet now. He rapped on the door anyway. No answer.\nMaybe there was nobody left in the car. In a minute the train would\nstart up and he'd be stuck here until the next stop. He banged on the\ndoor. \"Hey! The door is stuck!\"\n\nIt sounded foolish. He listened. It was very quiet. He pounded again.\nThe car creaked once. He put his ear to the door. He couldn't hear\nanything. He turned back to the window. There was no one in sight. He\nput his cheek flat against it, looked along the car. He saw only dry\nfields.\n\nHe turned around and gave the door a good kick. If he damaged it, it was\ntoo bad; the railroad shouldn't have defective locks on the doors. If\nthey tried to make him pay for it, he'd tell them they were lucky he\ndidn't sue the railroad ...\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe braced himself against the opposite wall, drew his foot back, and\nkicked hard at the lock. Something broke. He pulled the door open.\n\nHe was looking out the open door and through the window beyond. There\nwas no platform, just the same dry fields he could see on the other\nside. He came out and went along to his seat. The car was empty now.\n\nHe looked out the window. Why had the train stopped here? Maybe there\nwas some kind of trouble with the engine. It had been sitting here for\nten minutes or so now. Brett got up and went along to the door, stepped\ndown onto the iron step. Leaning out, he could see the train stretching\nalong ahead, one car, two cars--\n\nThere was no engine.\n\nMaybe he was turned around. He looked the other way. There were three\ncars. No engine there either. He must be on some kind of siding ...\n\nBrett stepped back inside, and pushed through into the next car. It was\nempty. He walked along the length of it, into the next car. It was empty\ntoo. He went back through the two cars and his own car and on, all the\nway to the end of the train. All the cars were empty. He stood on the\nplatform at the end of the last car, and looked back along the rails.\nThey ran straight, through the dry fields, right to the horizon. He\nstepped down to the ground, went along the cindery bed to the front of\nthe train, stepping on the ends of the wooden ties. The coupling stood\nopen. The tall, dusty coach stood silently on its iron wheels, waiting.\nAhead the tracks went on--\n\nAnd stopped.\n\nHe walked along the ties, following the iron rails, shiny on top, and\nbrown with rust on the sides. A hundred feet from the train they ended.\nThe cinders went on another ten feet and petered out. Beyond, the fields\nclosed in. Brett looked up at the sun. It was lower now in the west, its\nlight getting yellow and late-afternoonish. He turned and looked back at\nthe train. The cars stood high and prim, empty, silent. He walked back,\nclimbed in, got his bag down from the rack, pulled on his jacket. He\njumped down to the cinders, followed them to where they ended. He\nhesitated a moment, then pushed between the knee-high stalks. Eastward\nacross the field he could see what looked like a smudge on the far\nhorizon.\n\nHe walked until dark, then made himself a nest in the dead stalks, and\nwent to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe lay on his back, looking up at pink dawn clouds. Around him, dry\nstalks rustled in a faint stir of air. He felt crumbly earth under his\nfingers. He sat up, reached out and broke off a stalk. It crumbled into\nfragile chips. He wondered what it was. It wasn't any crop he'd ever\nseen before.\n\nHe stood, looked around. The field went on and on, dead flat. A locust\ncame whirring toward him, plumped to earth at his feet. He picked it up.\nLong elbowed legs groped at his fingers aimlessly. He tossed the insect\nin the air. It fluttered away. To the east the smudge was clearer now;\nit seemed to be a grey wall, far away. A city? He picked up his bag and\nstarted on.\n\nHe was getting hungry. He hadn't eaten since the previous morning. He\nwas thirsty too. The city couldn't be more than three hours' walk. He\ntramped along, the dry plants crackling under his feet, little puffs of\ndust rising from the dry ground. He thought about the rails, running\nacross the empty fields, ending ...\n\nHe had heard the locomotive groaning up ahead as the train slowed. And\nthere had been feet in the corridor. Where had they gone?\n\nHe thought of the train, Casperton, Aunt Haicey, Mr. Phillips. They\nseemed very far away, something remembered from long ago. Up above the\nsun was hot. That was real. The rest seemed unimportant. Ahead there was\na city. He would walk until he came to it. He tried to think of other\nthings: television, crowds of people, money: the tattered paper and the\nworn silver--\n\nOnly the sun and the dusty plain and the dead plants were real now. He\ncould see them, feel them. And the suitcase. It was heavy; he shifted\nhands, kept going.\n\nThere was something white on the ground ahead, a small shiny surface\nprotruding from the earth. Brett dropped the suitcase, went down on one\nknee, dug into the dry soil, pulled out a china teacup, the handle\nmissing. Caked dirt crumbled away under his thumb, leaving the surface\nclean. He looked at the bottom of the cup. It was unmarked. Why just one\nteacup, he wondered, here in the middle of nowhere? He dropped it, took\nup his suitcase, and went on.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAfter that he watched the ground more closely. He found a shoe; it was\nbadly weathered, but the sole was good. It was a high-topped work shoe,\nsize 10-1/2-C. Who had dropped it here? He thought of other lone shoes\nhe had seen, lying at the roadside or in alleys. How did they get\nthere...?\n\nHalf an hour later he detoured around the rusted front fender of an\nold-fashioned car. He looked around for the rest of the car but saw\nnothing. The wall was closer now; perhaps five miles more.\n\nA scrap of white paper fluttered across the field in a stir of air. He\nsaw another, more, blowing along in the fitful gusts. He ran a few\nsteps, caught one, smoothed it out.\n\n    BUY NOW--PAY LATER!\n\nHe picked up another.\n\n    PREPARE TO MEET GOD\n\nA third said:\n\n    WIN WITH WILLKIE\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wall loomed above him, smooth and grey. Dust was caked on his skin\nand clothes, and as he walked he brushed at himself absently. The\nsuitcase dragged at his arm, thumped against his shin. He was very\nhungry and thirsty. He sniffed the air, instinctively searching for the\nodors of food. He had been following the wall for a long time, searching\nfor an opening. It curved away from him, rising vertically from the\nlevel earth. Its surface was porous, unadorned, too smooth to climb. It\nwas, Brett estimated, twenty feet high. If there were anything to make a\nladder from--\n\nAhead he saw a wide gate, flanked by grey columns. He came up to it, put\nthe suitcase down, and wiped at his forehead with his handkerchief.\nThrough the opening in the wall a paved street was visible, and the\nfacades of buildings. Those on the street before him were low, not more\nthan one or two stories, but behind them taller towers reared up. There\nwere no people in sight; no sounds stirred the hot noon-time air. Brett\npicked up his bag and passed through the gate.\n\nFor the next hour he walked empty pavements, listening to the echoes of\nhis footsteps against brownstone fronts, empty shop windows, curtained\nglass doors, and here and there a vacant lot, weed-grown and desolate.\nHe paused at cross streets, looked down long vacant ways. Now and then a\ndistant sound came to him: the lonely honk of a horn, a faintly tolling\nbell, a clatter of hooves.\n\nHe came to a narrow alley that cut like a dark canyon between blank\nwalls. He stood at its mouth, listening to a distant murmur, like a\ncrowd at a funeral. He turned down the narrow way.\n\nIt went straight for a few yards, then twisted. As he followed its\nturnings the crowd noise gradually grew louder. He could make out\nindividual voices now, an occasional word above the hubbub. He started\nto hurry, eager to find someone to talk to.\n\nAbruptly the voices--hundreds of voices, he thought--rose in a roar, a\nlong-drawn Yaaayyyyy...! Brett thought of a stadium crowd as the home\nteam trotted onto the field. He could hear a band now, a shrilling of\nbrass, the clatter and thump of percussion instruments. Now he could see\nthe mouth of the alley ahead, a sunny street hung with bunting, the\nbacks of people, and over their heads the rhythmic bobbing of a passing\nprocession, tall shakos and guidons in almost-even rows. Two tall poles\nwith a streamer between them swung into view. He caught a glimpse of\ntall red letters:\n\n    ... For Our Side!\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe moved closer, edged up behind the grey-backed crowd. A phalanx of\nyellow-tuniced men approached, walking stiffly, fez tassels swinging. A\nsmall boy darted out into the street, loped along at their side. The\nmusic screeched and wheezed. Brett tapped the man before him.\n\n\"What's it all about...?\"\n\nHe couldn't hear his own voice. The man ignored him. Brett moved along\nbehind the crowd, looking for a vantage point or a thinning in the\nranks. There seemed to be fewer people ahead. He came to the end of the\ncrowd, moved on a few yards, stood at the curb. The yellow-jackets had\npassed now, and a group of round-thighed girls in satin blouses and\nblack boots and white fur caps glided into view, silent, expressionless.\nAs they reached a point fifty feet from Brett, they broke abruptly into\na strutting prance, knees high, hips flirting, tossing shining batons\nhigh, catching them, twirling them, and up again ...\n\nBrett craned his neck, looking for TV cameras. The crowd lining the\nopposite side of the street stood in solid ranks, drably clad, eyes\nfollowing the procession, mouths working. A fat man in a rumpled suit\nand a panama hat squeezed to the front, stood picking his teeth.\nSomehow, he seemed out of place among the others. Behind the spectators,\nthe store fronts looked normal, dowdy brick and mismatched glass and\noxidizing aluminum, dusty windows and cluttered displays of cardboard, a\nfaded sign that read TODAY ONLY--PRICES SLASHED. To Brett's left the\nsidewalk stretched, empty. To his right the crowd was packed close, the\nshout rising and falling. Now a rank of blue-suited policemen followed\nthe majorettes, swinging along silently. Behind them, over them, a piece\nof paper blew along the street. Brett turned to the man on his right.\n\n\"Pardon me. Can you tell me the name of this town?\"\n\nThe man ignored him. Brett tapped the man's shoulder. \"Hey! What town is\nthis?\"\n\nThe man took off his hat, whirled it overhead, then threw it up. It\nsailed away over the crowd, lost. Brett wondered briefly how people who\nthrew their hats ever recovered them. But then, nobody he knew would\nthrow his hat ...\n\n\"You mind telling me the name of this place?\" Brett said, as he took the\nman's arm, pulled. The man rotated toward Brett, leaning heavily against\nhim. Brett stepped back. The man fell, lay stiffly, his arms moving, his\neyes and mouth open.\n\n\"Ahhhhh,\" he said. \"Whum-whum-whum. Awww, jawww ...\"\n\nBrett stooped quickly. \"I'm sorry,\" he cried. He looked around. \"Help!\nThis man ...\"\n\nNobody was watching. The next man, a few feet away, stood close against\nhis neighbor, hatless, his jaw moving.\n\n\"This man's sick,\" said Brett, tugging at the man's arm. \"He fell.\"\n\nThe man's eyes moved reluctantly to Brett. \"None of my business,\" he\nmuttered.\n\n\"Won't anybody give me a hand?\"\n\n\"Probably a drunk.\"\n\nBehind Brett a voice called in a penetrating whisper: \"Quick! You! Get\ninto the alley...!\"\n\nHe turned. A gaunt man of about thirty with sparse reddish hair,\nperspiration glistening on his upper lip, stood at the mouth of a narrow\nway like the one Brett had come through. He wore a grimy pale yellow\nshirt with a wide-flaring collar, limp and sweat-stained, dark green\nknee-breeches, soft leather boots, scuffed and dirty, with limp tops\nthat drooped over his ankles. He gestured, drew back into the alley. \"In\nhere.\"\n\nBrett went toward him. \"This man ...\"\n\n\"Come on, you fool!\" The man took Brett's arm, pulled him deeper into\nthe dark passage. Brett resisted. \"Wait a minute. That fellow ...\" He\ntried to point.\n\n\"Don't you know yet?\" The red-head spoke with a strange accent. \"Golems\n... You got to get out of sight before the--\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe man froze, flattened himself against the wall. Automatically Brett\nmoved to a place beside him. The man's head was twisted toward the alley\nmouth. The tendons in his weathered neck stood out. He had a three-day\nstubble of beard. Brett could smell him, standing this close. He edged\naway. \"What--\"\n\n\"Don't make a sound! Don't move, you idiot!\" His voice was a thin hiss.\n\nBrett followed the other's eyes toward the sunny street. The fallen man\nlay on the pavement, moving feebly, eyes open. Something moved up to\nhim, a translucent brownish shape, like muddy water. It hovered for a\nmoment, then dropped on the man like a breaking wave, flowed around him.\nThe body shifted, rotating stiffly, then tilted upright. The sun struck\nthrough the fluid shape that flowed down now, amber highlights\ntwinkling, to form itself into the crested wave, flow away.\n\n\"What the hell...!\"\n\n\"Come on!\" The red-head turned, trotted silently toward the shadowy bend\nunder the high grey walls. He looked back, beckoned impatiently, passed\nout of sight around the turn--\n\nBrett came up behind him, saw a wide avenue, tall trees with chartreuse\nspringtime leaves, a wrought-iron fence, and beyond it, rolling green\nlawns. There were no people in sight.\n\n\"Wait a minute! What is this place?!\"\n\nHis companion turned red-rimmed eyes on Brett. \"How long have you been\nhere?\" he asked. \"How did you get in?\"\n\n\"I came through a gate. Just about an hour ago.\"\n\n\"I knew you were a man as soon as I saw you talking to the golem,\" said\nthe red-head. \"I've been here two months; maybe more. We've got to get\nout of sight. You want food? There's a place ...\" He jerked his thumb.\n\"Come on. Time to talk later.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett followed him. They turned down a side street, pushed through the\ndoor of a dingy cafe. It banged behind them. There were tables, stools\nat a bar, a dusty juke box. They took seats at a table. The red-head\ngroped under the table, pulled off a shoe, hammered it against the wall.\nHe cocked his head, listening. The silence was absolute. He hammered\nagain. There was a clash of crockery from beyond the kitchen door. \"Now\ndon't say anything,\" the red-head said. He eyed the door behind the\ncounter expectantly. It flew open. A girl with red cheeks and untidy\nhair, dressed in a green waitress' uniform appeared, swept up to the\ntable, pad and pencil in hand.\n\n\"Coffee and a ham sandwich,\" said the red-head. Brett said nothing. The\ngirl glanced at him briefly, jotted hastily, whisked away.\n\n\"I saw them here the first day,\" the red-head said. \"It was a piece of\nluck. I saw how the Gels started it up. They were big ones--not like the\ntidiers-up. As soon as they were finished, I came in and tried the same\nthing. It worked. I used the golem's lines--\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Brett said. \"I'm going to ask\nthat girl--\"\n\n\"Don't say anything to her; it might spoil everything. The whole\nsequence might collapse; or it might call the Gels. I'm not sure. You\ncan have the food when it comes back with it.\"\n\n\"Why do you say 'when \"it\" comes back'?\"\n\n\"Ah.\" He looked at Brett strangely. \"I'll show you.\"\n\nBrett could smell food now. His mouth watered. He hadn't eaten for\ntwenty-four hours.\n\n\"Care, that's the thing,\" the red-head said. \"Move quiet, and stay out\nof sight, and you can live like a County Duke. Food's the hardest, but\nhere--\"\n\nThe red-cheeked girl reappeared, a tray balanced on one arm, a heavy cup\nand saucer in the other hand. She clattered them down on the table.\n\n\"Took you long enough,\" the red-head said. The girl sniffed, opened her\nmouth to speak--and the red-head darted out a stiff finger, jabbed her\nunder the ribs. She stood, mouth open, frozen.\n\nBrett half rose. \"He's crazy, miss,\" he said. \"Please accept--\"\n\n\"Don't waste your breath.\" Brett's host was looking at him triumphantly.\n\"Why do I call it 'it'?\" He stood up, reached out and undid the top\nbuttons of the green uniform. The waitress stood, leaning slightly\nforward, unmoving. The blouse fell open, exposing round white\nbreasts--unadorned, blind.\n\n\"A doll,\" said the red-head. \"A puppet; a golem.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett stared at her, the damp curls at her temple, the tip of her tongue\nbehind her teeth, the tiny red veins in her round cheeks, and the white\nskin curving ...\n\n\"That's a quick way to tell 'em,\" said the red-head. \"The teat is\nsmooth.\" He rebuttoned the uniform, then jabbed again at the girl's\nribs. She straightened, patted her hair.\n\n\"No doubt a gentleman like you is used to better,\" she said carelessly.\nShe went away.\n\n\"I'm Awalawon Dhuva,\" the red-head said.\n\n\"My name's Brett Hale.\" Brett took a bite of the sandwich.\n\n\"Those clothes,\" Dhuva said. \"And you have a strange way of talking.\nWhat county are you from?\"\n\n\"Jefferson.\"\n\n\"Never heard of it. I'm from Wavly. What brought you here?\"\n\n\"I was on a train. The tracks came to an end out in the middle of\nnowhere. I walked ... and here I am. What is this place?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\" Dhuva shook his head. \"I knew they were lying about the\nFire River, though. Never did believe all that stuff. Religious hokum,\nto keep the masses quiet. Don't know what to believe now. Take the roof.\nThey say a hundred kharfads up; but how do we know? Maybe it's a\nthousand--or only ten. By Grat, I'd like to go up in a balloon, see for\nmyself.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Brett said. \"Go where in a balloon? See\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've seen one at the Tourney. Big hot-air bag, with a basket under\nit. Tied down with a rope. But if you cut the rope...! But you can bet\nthe priests will never let that happen, no, sir.\" Dhuva looked at Brett\nspeculatively. \"What about your county: Fession, or whatever you called\nit. How high do they tell you it is there?\"\n\n\"You mean the sky? Well, the air ends after a few miles and space just\ngoes on--millions of miles--\"\n\nDhuva slapped the table and laughed. \"The people in Fesseron must be\nsome yokels! Just goes on up; now who'd swallow that tale?\" He chuckled.\n\n\"Only a child thinks the sky is some kind of tent,\" said Brett. \"Haven't\nyou ever heard of the Solar System, the other planets?\"\n\n\"What are those?\"\n\n\"Other worlds. They all circle around the sun, like the Earth.\"\n\n\"Other worlds, eh? Sailing around up under the roof? Funny; I never saw\nthem.\" Dhuva snickered. \"Wake up, Brett. Forget all those stories. Just\nbelieve what you see.\"\n\n\"What about that brown thing?\"\n\n\"The Gels? They run this place. Look out for them, Brett. Stay alert.\nDon't let them see you.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"What do they do?\"\n\n\"I don't know--and I don't want to find out. This is a great place--I\nlike it here. I have all I want to eat, plenty of nice rooms for\nsleeping. There's the parades and the scenes. It's a good life--as long\nas you keep out of sight.\"\n\n\"How do you get out of here?\" Brett asked, finishing his coffee.\n\n\"Don't know how to get out; over the wall, I suppose. I don't plan to\nleave though. I left home in a hurry. The Duke--never mind. I'm not\ngoing back.\"\n\n\"Are all the people here ... golems?\" Brett said. \"Aren't there any more\nreal people?\"\n\n\"You're the first I've seen. I spotted you as soon as I saw you. A live\nman moves different than a golem. You see golems doing things like\nknitting their brows, starting back in alarm, looking askance, and\nstanding arms akimbo. And they have things like pursed lips and knowing\nglances and mirthless laughter. You know: all the things you read about,\nthat real people never do. But now that you're here, I've got somebody\nto talk to. I did get lonesome, I admit. I'll show you where I stay and\nwe'll fix you up with a bed.\"\n\n\"I won't be around that long.\"\n\n\"What can you get outside that you can't get here? There's everything\nyou need here in the city. We can have a great time.\"\n\n\"You sound like my Aunt Haicey,\" Brett said. \"She said I had everything\nI needed back in Casperton. How does she know what I need? How do you\nknow? How do I know myself? I can tell you I need more than food and a\nplace to sleep--\"\n\n\"What more?\"\n\n\"Everything. Things to think about and something worth doing. Why, even\nin the movies--\"\n\n\"What's a movie?\"\n\n\"You know, a play, on film. A moving picture.\"\n\n\"A picture that moves?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"This is something the priests told you about?\" Dhuva seemed to be\nholding in his mirth.\n\n\"Everybody's seen movies.\"\n\nDhuva burst out laughing. \"Those priests,\" he said. \"They're the same\neverywhere, I see. The stories they tell, and people believe them. What\nelse?\"\n\n\"Priests have nothing to do with it.\"\n\nDhuva composed his features. \"What do they tell you about Grat, and the\nWheel?\"\n\n\"Grat? What's that?\"\n\n\"The Over-Being. The Four-eyed One.\" Dhuva made a sign, caught himself.\n\"Just habit,\" he said. \"I don't believe that rubbish. Never did.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're talking about God,\" Brett said.\n\n\"I don't know about God. Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"He's the creator of the world. He's ... well, superhuman. He knows\neverything that happens, and when you die, if you've led a good life,\nyou meet God in Heaven.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"It's ...\" Brett waved a hand vaguely, \"up above.\"\n\n\"But you said there was just emptiness up above,\" Dhuva recalled. \"And\nsome other worlds whirling around, like islands adrift in the sea.\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Dhuva held up his hands. \"Our priests are liars too. All\nthat balderdash about the Wheel and the River of Fire. It's just as bad\nas your Hivvel or whatever you called it. And our Grat and your Mud, or\nGog: they're the same--\" Dhuva's head went up. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"I didn't hear anything.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nDhuva got to his feet, turned to the door. Brett rose. A towering brown\nshape, glassy and transparent, hung in the door, its surface rippling.\nDhuva whirled, leaped past Brett, dived for the rear door. Brett stood\nfrozen. The shape flowed--swift as quicksilver--caught Dhuva in\nmid-stride, engulfed him. For an instant Brett saw the thin figure, legs\nkicking, upended within the muddy form of the Gel. Then the turbid wave\nswept across to the door, sloshed it aside, disappeared. Dhuva was gone.\n\nBrett stood rooted, staring at the doorway. A bar of sunlight fell\nacross the dusty floor. A brown mouse ran along the baseboard. It was\nvery quiet. Brett went to the door through which the Gel had\ndisappeared, hesitated a moment, then thrust it open.\n\nHe was looking down into a great dark pit, acres in extent, its sides\nriddled with holes, the amputated ends of water and sewage lines and\npower cables dangling. Far below light glistened from the surface of a\nblack pool. A few feet away the waitress stood unmoving in the dark on a\nnarrow strip of linoleum. At her feet the chasm yawned. The edge of the\nfloor was ragged, as though it had been gnawed away by rats. There was\nno sign of Dhuva.\n\nBrett stepped back into the dining room, let the door swing shut. He\ntook a deep breath, picked up a paper napkin from a table and wiped his\nforehead, dropped the napkin on the floor and went out into the street,\nhis suitcase forgotten now. At the corner he turned, walked along past\nsilent shop windows crowded with home permanents, sun glasses,\nfingernail polish, suntan lotion, paper cartons, streamers, plastic\ntoys, vari-colored garments of synthetic fiber, home remedies, beauty\naids, popular music, greeting cards ...\n\nAt the next corner he stopped, looking down the silent streets. Nothing\nmoved. Brett went to a window in a grey concrete wall, pulled himself up\nto peer through the dusty pane, saw a room filled with tailor's forms,\ngarment racks, a bicycle, bundled back issues of magazines without\ncovers.\n\nHe went along to a door. It was solid, painted shut. The next door\nlooked easier. He wrenched at the tarnished brass nob, then stepped back\nand kicked the door. With a hollow sound the door fell inward, taking\nwith it the jamb. Brett stood staring at the gaping opening. A fragment\nof masonry dropped with a dry clink. Brett stepped through the breach in\nthe grey facade. The black pool at the bottom of the pit winked a\nflicker of light back at him in the deep gloom.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAround him, the high walls of the block of buildings loomed in\nsilhouette; the squares of the windows were ranks of luminous blue\nagainst the dark. Dust motes danced in shafts of sunlight. Far above,\nthe roof was dimly visible, a spidery tangle of trusswork. And below was\nthe abyss.\n\nAt Brett's feet the stump of a heavy brass rail projected an inch from\nthe floor. It was long enough, Brett thought, to give firm anchor to a\nrope. Somewhere below, Dhuva--a stranger who had befriended him--lay in\nthe grip of the Gels. He would do what he could--but he needed\nequipment--and help. First he would find a store with rope, guns,\nknives. He would--\n\nThe broken edge of masonry where the door had been caught his eye. The\nshell of the wall, exposed where the door frame had torn away, was\nwafer-thin. Brett reached up, broke off a piece. The outer face--the\nside that showed on the street--was smooth, solid-looking. The back was\nporous, nibbled. Brett stepped outside, examined the wall. He kicked at\nthe grey surface. A great piece of wall, six feet high, broke into\nfragments, fell on the sidewalk with a crash, driving out a puff of\ndust. Another section fell. One piece of it skidded away, clattered down\ninto the depths. Brett heard a distant splash. He looked at the great\njagged opening in the wall--like a jigsaw picture with a piece missing.\nHe turned and started off at a trot, his mouth dry, his pulse thumping\npainfully in his chest.\n\nTwo blocks from the hollow building, Brett slowed to a walk, his\nfootsteps echoing in the empty street. He looked into each store window\nas he passed. There were artificial legs, bottles of colored water,\nimmense dolls, wigs, glass eyes--but no rope. Brett tried to think. What\nkind of store would handle rope? A marine supply company, maybe. But\nwhere would he find one?\n\nPerhaps it would be easiest to look in a telephone book. Ahead he saw a\nsign lettered HOTEL. Brett went up to the revolving door, pushed inside.\nHe was in a dim, marble-panelled lobby, with double doors leading into\na beige-carpeted bar on his right, the brass-painted cage of an elevator\ndirectly before him, flanked by tall urns of sand and an ascending\nstaircase. On the left was a dark mahogany-finished reception desk.\nBehind the desk a man stood silently, waiting. Brett felt a wild surge\nof relief.\n\n\"Those things, those Gels!\" he called, starting across the room. \"My\nfriend--\"\n\nHe broke off. The clerk stood, staring over Brett's shoulder, holding a\npen poised over a book. Brett reached out, took the pen. The man's\nfinger curled stiffly around nothing. A golem.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett turned away, went into the bar. Vacant stools were ranged before a\ndark mirror. At the tables empty glasses stood before empty chairs.\nBrett started as he heard the revolving door thump-thump. Suddenly soft\nlight bathed the lobby behind him. Somewhere a piano tinkled _More Than\nYou Know_. With a distant clatter of closing doors the elevator came to\nlife.\n\nBrett hugged a shadowed corner, saw a fat man in a limp seersucker suit\ncross to the reception desk. He had a red face, a bald scalp blotched\nwith large brown freckles. The clerk inclined his head blandly.\n\n\"Ah, yes, sir, a nice double with bath ...\" Brett heard the unctuous\nvoice of the clerk as he offered the pen. The fat man took it, scrawled\nsomething in the register. \"... at fourteen dollars,\" the clerk\nmurmured. He smiled, dinged the bell. A boy in tight green tunic and\ntrousers and a pillbox cap with a chin strap pushed through a door\nbeside the desk, took the key, led the way to the elevator. The fat man\nentered. Through the openwork of the shaft Brett watched as the elevator\ncar rose, greasy cables trembling and swaying. He started back across\nthe lobby--and stopped dead.\n\nA wet brown shape had appeared in the entrance. It flowed across the rug\nto the bellhop. Face blank, the golem turned back to its door. Above,\nBrett heard the elevator stop. Doors clashed. The clerk stood poised\nbehind the desk. The Gel hovered, then flowed away. The piano was silent\nnow. The lights burned, a soft glow, then winked out. Brett thought\nabout the fat man. He had seen him before ...\n\nHe went up the stairs. In the second floor corridor Brett felt his way\nalong in near-darkness, guided by the dim light coming through transoms.\nHe tried a door. It opened. He stepped into a large bedroom with a\ndouble bed, an easy chair, a chest of drawers. He crossed the room,\nlooked out across an alley. Twenty feet away white curtains hung at\nwindows in a brick wall. There was nothing behind the windows.\n\nThere were sounds in the corridor. Brett dropped to the floor behind the\nbed.\n\n\"All right, you two,\" a drunken voice bellowed. \"And may all your\ntroubles be little ones.\" There was laughter, squeals, a dry clash of\nbeads flung against the door. A key grated. The door swung wide. Lights\nblazed in the hall, silhouetting the figures of a man in black jacket\nand trousers, a woman in a white bridal dress and veil, flowers in her\nhand.\n\n\"Take care, Mel!\"\n\n\"... do anything I wouldn't do!\"\n\n\"... kiss the bride, now!\"\n\nThe couple backed into the room, pushed the door shut, stood against it.\nBrett crouched behind the bed, not breathing, waiting. The couple stood\nat the door, in the dark, heads down ...\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett stood, rounded the foot of the bed, approached the two unmoving\nfigures. The girl looked young, sleek, perfect-featured, with soft dark\nhair. Her eyes were half-open; Brett caught a glint of light reflected\nfrom the eyeball. The man was bronzed, broad-shouldered, his hair wavy\nand blond. His lips were parted, showing even white teeth. The two\nstood, not breathing, sightless eyes fixed on nothing.\n\nBrett took the bouquet from the woman's hand. The flowers seemed\nreal--except that they had no perfume. He dropped them on the floor,\npulled at the male golem to clear the door. The figure pivoted, toppled,\nhit with a heavy thump. Brett raised the woman in his arms and propped\nher against the bed. Back at the door he listened. All was quiet now. He\nstarted to open the door, then hesitated. He went back to the bed, undid\nthe tiny pearl buttons down the front of the bridal gown, pulled it\nopen. The breasts were rounded, smooth, an unbroken creamy white ...\n\nIn the hall, he started toward the stair. A tall Gel rippled into view\nahead, its shape flowing and wavering, now billowing out, then rising\nup. The shifting form undulated toward Brett. He made a move to run,\nthen remembered Dhuva, stood motionless. The Gel wobbled past him,\nslumped suddenly, flowed under a door. Brett let out a breath. Never\nmind the fat man. There were too many Gels here. He started back along\nthe corridor.\n\nSoft music came from double doors which stood open on a landing. Brett\nwent to them, risked a look inside. Graceful couples moved sedately on a\npolished floor, diners sat at tables, black-clad waiters moving among\nthem. At the far side of the room, near a dusty rubber plant, sat the\nfat man, studying a menu. As Brett watched he shook out a napkin, ran it\naround inside his collar, then mopped his face.\n\nNever disturb a scene, Dhuva had said. But perhaps he could blend with\nit. Brett brushed at his suit, straightened his tie, stepped into the\nroom. A waiter approached, eyed him dubiously. Brett got out his wallet,\ntook out a five-dollar bill.\n\n\"A quiet table in the corner,\" he said. He glanced back. There were no\nGels in sight. He followed the waiter to a table near the fat man.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nSeated, he looked around. He wanted to talk to the fat man, but he\ncouldn't afford to attract attention. He would watch, and wait his\nchance.\n\nAt the nearby tables men with well-pressed suits, clean collars, and\ncarefully shaved faces murmured to sleekly gowned women who fingered\nwine glasses, smiled archly. He caught fragments of conversation:\n\n\"My dear, have you heard ...\"\n\n\"... in the low eighties ...\"\n\n\"... quite impossible. One must ...\"\n\n\"... for this time of year.\"\n\nThe waiter returned with a shallow bowl of milky soup. Brett looked at\nthe array of spoons, forks, knives, glanced sideways at the diners at\nthe next table. It was important to follow the correct ritual. He put\nhis napkin in his lap, careful to shake out all the folds. He looked at\nthe spoons again, picked a large one, glanced at the waiter. So far so\ngood ...\n\n\"Wine, sir?\"\n\nBrett indicated the neighboring couple. \"The same as they're having.\"\nThe waiter turned away, returned holding a wine bottle, label toward\nBrett. He looked at it, nodded. The waiter busied himself with the cork,\nremoving it with many flourishes, setting a glass before Brett, pouring\nhalf an inch of wine. He waited expectantly.\n\nBrett picked up the glass, tasted it. It tasted like wine. He nodded.\nThe waiter poured. Brett wondered what would have happened if he had\nmade a face and spurned it. But it would be too risky to try. No one\never did it.\n\nCouples danced, resumed their seats; others rose and took the floor. A\nstring ensemble in a distant corner played restrained tunes that seemed\nto speak of the gentle faded melancholy of decorous tea dances on\nlong-forgotten afternoons. Brett glanced toward the fat man. He was\neating soup noisily, his napkin tied under his chin.\n\nThe waiter was back with a plate. \"Lovely day, sir,\" he said.\n\n\"Great,\" Brett agreed.\n\nThe waiter placed a covered platter on the table, removed the cover,\nstood with carving knife and fork poised.\n\n\"A bit of the crispy, sir?\"\n\nBrett nodded. He eyed the waiter surreptitiously. He looked real. Some\ngolems seemed realer than others; or perhaps it merely depended on the\nparts they were playing. The man who had fallen at the parade had been\nonly a sort of extra, a crowd member. The waiter, on the other hand, was\nable to converse. Perhaps it would be possible to learn something from\nhim ...\n\n\"What's ... uh ... how do you spell the name of this town?\" Brett asked.\n\n\"I was never much of a one for spelling, sir,\" the waiter said.\n\n\"Try it.\"\n\n\"Gravy, sir?\"\n\n\"Sure. Try to spell the name.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better call the headwaiter, sir,\" the golem said stiffly.\n\nFrom the corner of an eye Brett caught a flicker of motion. He whirled,\nsaw nothing. Had it been a Gel?\n\n\"Never mind,\" he said. The waiter served potatoes, peas, refilled the\nwine glass, moved off silently. The question had been a little too\nunorthodox, Brett decided. Perhaps if he led up to the subject more\nobliquely ...\n\n       *       *       *\n\nWhen the waiter returned Brett said, \"Nice day.\"\n\n\"Very nice, sir.\"\n\n\"Better than yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes indeed, sir.\"\n\n\"I wonder what tomorrow'll be like.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we'll have a bit of rain, sir.\"\n\nBrett nodded toward the dance floor. \"Nice orchestra.\"\n\n\"They're very popular, sir.\"\n\n\"From here in town?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know as to that, sir.\"\n\n\"Lived here long yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\" The waiter's expression showed disapproval. \"Would there\nbe anything else, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm a newcomer here,\" Brett said. \"I wonder if you could tell me--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir.\" The waiter was gone. Brett poked at the mashed\npotatoes. Quizzing golems was hopeless. He would have to find out for\nhimself. He turned to look at the fat man. As Brett watched he took a\nlarge handkerchief from a pocket, blew his nose loudly. No one turned to\nlook. The orchestra played softly. The couples danced. Now was as good a\ntime as any ...\n\nBrett rose, crossed to the other's table. The man looked up.\n\n\"Mind if I sit down?\" Brett said. \"I'd like to talk to you.\"\n\nThe fat man blinked, motioned to a chair. Brett sat down, leaned across\nthe table. \"Maybe I'm wrong,\" he said quietly, \"but I think you're\nreal.\"\n\nThe fat man blinked again. \"What's that?\" he snapped. He had a high\npetulant voice.\n\n\"You're not like the rest of them. I think I can talk to you. I think\nyou're another outsider.\"\n\nThe fat man looked down at his rumpled suit. \"I ... ah ... was caught a\nlittle short today. Didn't have time to change. I'm a busy man. And what\nbusiness is it of yours?\" He clamped his jaw shut, eyed Brett warily.\n\n\"I'm a stranger here,\" Brett said. \"I want to find out what's going on\nin this place--\"\n\n\"Buy an amusement guide. Lists all the shows--\"\n\n\"I don't mean that. I mean these dummies all over the place, and the\nGels--\"\n\n\"What dummies? Jells? Jello? You don't like Jello?\"\n\n\"I love Jello. I don't--\"\n\n\"Just ask the waiter. He'll bring you your Jello. Any flavor you like.\nNow if you'll excuse me ...\"\n\n\"I'm talking about the brown things; they look like muddy water. They\ncome around if you interfere with a scene.\"\n\nThe fat man looked nervous. \"Please. Go away.\"\n\n\"If I make a disturbance, the Gels will come. Is that what you're afraid\nof?\"\n\n\"Now, now. Be calm. No need for you to get excited.\"\n\n\"I won't make a scene,\" Brett said. \"Just talk to me. How long have you\nbeen here?\"\n\n\"I dislike scenes. I dislike them intensely.\"\n\n\"When did you come here?\"\n\n\"Just ten minutes ago. I just sat down. I haven't had my dinner yet.\nPlease, young man. Go back to your table.\" The fat man watched Brett\nwarily. Sweat glistened on his bald head.\n\n\"I mean this town. How long have you been here? Where did you come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Why, I was born here. Where did I come from? What sort of question is\nthat? Just consider that the stork brought me.\"\n\n\"You were born here?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What's the name of the town?\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you trying to make a fool of me?\" The fat man was getting angry.\nHis voice was rising.\n\n\"Shhh,\" Brett cautioned. \"You'll attract the Gels.\"\n\n\"Blast the Jilts, whatever that is!\" the fat man snapped. \"Now, get\nalong with you. I'll call the manager.\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" Brett said, staring at the fat man. \"They're all\ndummies; golems, they're called. They're not real.\"\n\n\"Who're not real?\"\n\n\"All these imitation people at the tables and on the dance floor. Surely\nyou realize--\"\n\n\"I realize you're in need of medical attention.\" The fat man pushed back\nhis chair and got to his feet. \"You keep the table,\" he said. \"I'll dine\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Brett got up, seized the fat man's arm.\n\n\"Take your hands off me--\" The fat man went toward the door. Brett\nfollowed. At the cashier's desk Brett turned suddenly, saw a fluid brown\nshape flicker--\n\n\"Look!\" He pulled at the fat man's arm--\n\n\"Look at what?\" The Gel was gone.\n\n\"It was there: a Gel.\"\n\nThe fat man flung down a bill, hurried away. Brett fumbled out a ten,\nwaited for change. \"Wait!\" he called. He heard the fat man's feet\nreceding down the stairs.\n\n\"Hurry,\" he said to the cashier. The woman sat glassy-eyed, staring at\nnothing. The music died. The lights flickered, went off. In the gloom\nBrett saw a fluid shape rise up--\n\nHe ran, pounding down the stairs. The fat man was just rounding the\ncorner. Brett opened his mouth to call--and went rigid, as a translucent\nshape of mud shot from the door, rose up to tower before him. Brett\nstood, mouth half open, eyes staring, leaning forward with hands\noutflung. The Gel loomed, its surface flickering--waiting. Brett caught\nan acrid odor of geraniums.\n\nA minute passed. Brett's cheek itched. He fought a desire to blink, to\nswallow--to turn and run. The high sun beat down on the silent street,\nthe still window displays.\n\nThen the Gel broke form, slumped, flashed away. Brett tottered back\nagainst the wall, let his breath out in a harsh sigh.\n\nAcross the street he saw a window with a display of camping equipment,\nportable stoves, boots, rifles. He crossed the street, tried the door.\nIt was locked. He looked up and down the street. There was no one in\nsight. He kicked in the glass beside the latch, reached through and\nturned the knob. Inside he looked over the shelves, selected a heavy\ncoil of nylon rope, a sheath knife, a canteen. He examined a Winchester\nrepeating rifle with a telescopic sight, then put it back and strapped\non a .22 revolver. He emptied two boxes of long rifle cartridges into\nhis pocket, then loaded the pistol. He coiled the rope over his shoulder\nand went back out into the empty street.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe fat man was standing in front of a shop in the next block, picking\nat a blemish on his chin and eyeing the window display. He looked up\nwith a frown, started away as Brett came up.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Brett called. \"Didn't you see the Gel? the one that\ncornered me back there?\"\n\nThe fat man looked back suspiciously, kept going.\n\n\"Wait!\" Brett caught his arm. \"I know you're real. I've seen you belch\nand sweat and scratch. You're the only one I can call on--and I need\nhelp. My friend is trapped--\"\n\nThe fat man pulled away, his face flushed an even deeper red. \"I'm\nwarning you, you maniac: get away from me...!\"\n\nBrett stepped close, rammed the fat man hard in the ribs. He sank to his\nknees, gasping. The panama hat rolled away. Brett grabbed his arm,\nsteadied him.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"I had to be sure. You're real, all right. We've got\nto rescue my friend, Dhuva--\"\n\nThe fat man leaned against the glass, rolling terrified eyes, rubbing\nhis stomach. \"I'll call the police!\" he gasped.\n\n\"What police?\" Brett waved an arm. \"Look. Not a car in sight. Did you\never see the street that empty before?\"\n\n\"Wednesday afternoon,\" the fat man gasped.\n\n\"Come with me. I want to show you. It's all hollow. There's nothing\nbehind these walls--\"\n\n\"Why doesn't somebody come along?\" the fat man moaned.\n\n\"The masonry is only a quarter-inch thick,\" Brett said. \"Come on; I'll\nshow you.\"\n\n\"I don't like it,\" said the fat man. His face was pale and moist.\n\"You're mad. What's wrong? It's so quiet ...\"\n\n\"We've got to try to save him. The Gel took him down into this pit--\"\n\n\"Let me go,\" the man whined. \"I'm afraid. Can't you just let me lead my\nlife in peace?\"\n\n\"Don't you understand? The Gel took a man. They may be after you next.\"\n\n\"There's no one after me! I'm a business man ... a respectable citizen.\nI mind my own business, give to charity, go to church. All I want is to\nbe left alone!\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett dropped his hands from the fat man's arms, stood looking at him:\nthe blotched face, pale now, the damp forehead, the quivering jowls. The\nfat man stooped for his hat, slapped it against his leg, clamped it on\nhis head.\n\n\"I think I understand now,\" said Brett. \"This is your place, this\nimitation city. Everything's faked to fit your needs--like in the hotel.\nWherever you go, the scene unrolls in front of you. You never see the\nGels, never discover the secret of the golems--because you conform. You\nnever do the unexpected.\"\n\n\"That's right. I'm law-abiding. I'm respectable. I don't pry. I don't\nnose into other people's business. Why should I? Just let me alone ...\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Brett said. \"Even if I dragged you down there and showed you,\nyou wouldn't believe it. But you're not in the scene now. I've taken you\nout of it--\"\n\nSuddenly the fat man turned and ran a few yards, then looked back to see\nwhether Brett was pursuing him. He shook a round fist.\n\n\"I've seen your kind before,\" he shouted. \"Troublemakers.\"\n\nBrett took a step toward him. The fat man yelped and ran another fifty\nfeet, his coat tails bobbing. He looked back, stopped, a fat figure\nalone in the empty sunny street.\n\n\"You haven't seen the last of me!\" he shouted. \"We know how to deal with\nyour kind.\" He tugged at his vest, went off along the sidewalk. Brett\nwatched him go, then started back toward the hollow building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe jagged fragments of masonry Brett had knocked from the wall lay as\nhe had left them. He stepped through the opening, peered down into the\nmurky pit, trying to judge its depth. A hundred feet at least. Perhaps a\nhundred and fifty.\n\nHe unslung the rope from his shoulder, tied one end to the brass stump,\nthrew the coil down the precipitous side. It fell away into darkness,\nhung swaying. It was impossible to tell whether the end reached any\nsolid footing below. He couldn't waste any more time looking for help.\nHe would have to try it alone.\n\nThere was a scrape of shoe leather on the pavement outside. He turned,\nstepped out into the white sunlight. The fat man rounded the corner,\nrecoiled as he saw Brett. He flung out a pudgy forefinger, his\nprotruding eyes wide in his blotchy red face.\n\n\"There he is! I told you he came this way!\" Two uniformed policemen came\ninto view. One eyed the gun at Brett's side, put a hand on his own.\n\n\"Better take that off, sir.\"\n\n\"Look!\" Brett said to the fat man. He stooped, picked up a crust of\nmasonry. \"Look at this--just a shell--\"\n\n\"He's blasted a hole right in that building, officer!\" the fat man\nshrilled. \"He's dangerous.\"\n\nThe cop ignored the gaping hole in the wall. \"You'll have to come along\nwith me, sir. This gentleman registered a complaint ...\"\n\nBrett stood staring into the cop's eyes. They were pale blue eyes,\nlooking steadily back at him from a bland face. Could the cop be real?\nOr would he be able to push him over, as he had other golems?\n\n\"The fellow's not right in the head,\" the fat man was saying to the cop.\n\"You should have heard his crazy talk. A troublemaker. His kind have got\nto be locked up!\"\n\nThe cop nodded. \"Can't have anyone causing trouble.\"\n\n\"Only a young fellow,\" said the fat man. He mopped at his forehead with\na large handkerchief. \"Tragic. But I'm sure that you men know how to\nhandle him.\"\n\n\"Better give me the gun, sir.\" The cop held out a hand. Brett moved\nsuddenly, rammed stiff fingers into the cop's ribs. He stiffened,\ntoppled, lay rigid, staring up at nothing.\n\n\"You ... you killed him,\" the fat man gasped, backing. The second cop\ntugged at his gun. Brett leaped at him, sent him down with a blow to the\nribs. He turned to face the fat man.\n\n\"I didn't kill them! I just turned them off. They're not real, they're\njust golems.\"\n\n\"A killer! And right in the city, in broad daylight.\"\n\n\"You've got to help me!\" Brett cried. \"This whole scene: don't you see?\nIt has the air of something improvised in a hurry, to deal with the\nunexpected factor; that's me. The Gels know something's wrong, but they\ncan't quite figure out what. When you called the cops the Gels\nobliged--\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nStartlingly the fat man burst into tears. He fell to his knees.\n\n\"Don't kill me ... oh, don't kill me ...\"\n\n\"Nobody's going to kill you, you fool!\" Brett snapped. \"Look! I want to\nshow you!\" He seized the fat man's lapel, dragged him to his feet and\nacross the sidewalk, through the opening. The fat man stopped dead,\nstumbled back--\n\n\"What's this? What kind of place is this?\" He scrambled for the opening.\n\n\"It's what I've been trying to tell you. This city you live in--it's a\nhollow shell. There's nothing inside. None of it's real. Only you ...\nand me. There was another man: Dhuva. I was in a cafe with him. A Gel\ncame. He tried to run. It caught him. Now he's ... down there.\"\n\n\"I'm not alone,\" the fat man babbled. \"I have my friends, my clubs, my\nbusiness associates. I'm insured. Lately I've been thinking a lot about\nJesus--\"\n\nHe broke off, whirled, and jumped for the doorway. Brett leaped after\nhim, caught his coat. It ripped. The fat man stumbled over one of the\ncop-golems, went to hands and knees. Brett stood over him.\n\n\"Get up, damn it!\" he snapped. \"I need help and you're going to help\nme!\" He hauled the fat man to his feet. \"All you have to do is stand by\nthe rope. Dhuva may be unconscious when I find him. You'll have to help\nme haul him up. If anybody comes along, any Gels, I mean--give me a\nsignal. A whistle ... like this--\" Brett demonstrated. \"And if I get in\ntrouble, do what you can. Here ...\" Brett started to offer the fat man\nthe gun, then handed him the hunting knife. \"If anybody interferes, this\nmay not do any good, but it's something. I'm going down now.\"\n\nThe fat man watched as Brett gripped the rope, let himself over the\nedge. Brett looked up at the glistening face, the damp strands of hair\nacross the freckled scalp. Brett had no assurance that the man would\nstay at his post, but he had done what he could.\n\n\"Remember,\" said Brett. \"It's a real man they've got, like you and me\n... not a golem. We owe it to him.\" The fat man's hands trembled. He\nwatched Brett, licked his lips. Brett started down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe descent was easy. The rough face of the excavation gave footholds.\nThe end of a decaying timber projected; below it was the stump of a\ncrumbling concrete pipe two feet in diameter. Brett was ten feet below\nthe rim of floor now. Above, the broad figure of the fat man was visible\nin silhouette against the jagged opening in the wall.\n\nNow the cliff shelved back; the rope hung free. Brett eased past the cut\nend of a rusted water pipe, went down hand over hand. If there were\nnothing at the bottom to give him footing, it would be a long climb back\n...\n\nTwenty feet below he could see the still black water, pockmarked with\nexpanding rings where bits of debris dislodged by his passage peppered\nthe surface.\n\nThere was a rhythmic vibration in the rope. Brett felt it through his\nhands, a fine sawing sensation ...\n\nHe was falling, gripping the limp rope ...\n\nHe slammed on his back in three feet of oily water. The coils of rope\ncollapsed around him with a sustained splashing. He got to his feet,\ngroped for the end of the rope. The glossy nylon strands had been\ncleanly cut.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nFor half an hour Brett waded in waist-deep water along a wall of damp\nclay that rose sheer above him. Far above, bars of dim sunlight crossed\nthe upper reaches of the cavern. He had seen no sign of Dhuva ... or the\nGels.\n\nHe encountered a sodden timber that projected above the surface of the\npool, clung to it to rest. Bits of flotsam--a plastic pistol, bridge\ntallies, a golf bag--floated in the black water. A tunnel extended\nthrough the clay wall ahead; beyond, Brett could see a second great\ncavern rising. He pictured the city, silent and empty above, and the\nhoney-combed earth beneath. He moved on.\n\nAn hour later Brett had traversed the second cavern. Now he clung to an\noutthrust spur of granite directly beneath the point at which Dhuva had\ndisappeared. Far above he could see the green-clad waitress standing\nstiffly on her ledge. He was tired. Walking in water, his feet\nfloundering in soft mud, was exhausting. He was no closer to escape, or\nto finding Dhuva, than he had been when the fat man cut the rope. He had\nbeen a fool to leave the man alone, with a knife ... but he had had no\nchoice.\n\nHe would have to find another way out. Endlessly wading at the bottom of\nthe pit was useless. He would have to climb. One spot was as good as\nanother. He stepped back and scanned the wall of clay looming over him.\nTwenty feet up, water dripped from the broken end of a four-inch water\nmain. Brett uncoiled the rope from his shoulder, tied a loop in the end,\nwhirled it and cast upward. It missed, fell back with a splash. He\ngathered it in, tried again. On the third try it caught. He tested it,\nthen started up. His hands were slippery with mud and water. He twined\nthe rope around his legs, inched higher. The slender cable was smooth as\nglass. He slipped back two feet, then inched upward, slipped again,\npainfully climbed, slipped, climbed.\n\nAfter the first ten feet he found toe-holds in the muddy wall. He worked\nhis way up, his hands aching and raw. A projecting tangle of power cable\ngave a secure purchase for a foot. He rested. Nearby, an opening two\nfeet in diameter gaped in the clay: a tunnel. It might be possible to\nswing sideways across the face of the clay and reach the opening. It was\nworth a try. His stiff, clay-slimed hands would pull him no higher.\n\nHe gripped the rope, kicked off sideways, hooked a foot in the tunnel\nmouth, half jumped, half fell into the mouth of the tunnel. He clung to\nthe rope, shook it loose from the pipe above, coiled it and looped it\nover his shoulder. On hands and knees he started into the narrow\npassage.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThe tunnel curved left, then right, dipped, then angled up. Brett\ncrawled steadily, the smooth stiff clay yielding and cold against his\nhands and sodden knees. Another smaller tunnel joined from the left.\nAnother angled in from above. The tunnel widened to three feet, then\nfour. Brett got to his feet, walked in a crouch. Here and there, barely\nvisible in the near-darkness, objects lay imbedded in the mud: a\nsilver-plated spoon, its handle bent; the rusted engine of an electric\ntrain; a portable radio, green with corrosion from burst batteries.\n\nAt a distance, Brett estimated, of a hundred yards from the pit, the\ntunnel opened into a vast cave, green-lit from tiny discs of frosted\nglass set in the ceiling far above. A row of discolored concrete piles,\nthe foundations of the building above, protruded against the near wall,\ntheir surfaces nibbled and pitted. Between Brett and the concrete\ncolumns the floor was littered with pale sticks and stones, gleaming\ndully in the gloom.\n\nBrett started across the floor. One of the sticks snapped underfoot. He\nkicked a melon-sized stone. It rolled lightly, came to rest with hollow\neyes staring toward him. A human skull.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe floor of the cave covered an area the size of a city block. It was\nblanketed with human bones, with here and there a small cat skeleton or\nthe fanged snout-bones of a dog. There was a constant rustling of rats\nthat played among the rib cages, sat atop crania, scuttled behind\nshin-bones. Brett picked his way, stepping over imitation pearl\nnecklaces, zircon rings, plastic buttons, hearing aids, lipsticks,\ncompacts, corset stays, prosthetic devices, rubber heels, wrist watches,\nlapel watches, pocket watches with corroded brass chains.\n\nAhead Brett saw a patch of color: a blur of pale yellow. He hurried,\nstumbling over bone heaps, crunching eyeglasses underfoot. He reached\nthe still figure where it lay slackly, face down. Gingerly he squatted,\nturned it on its back. It was Dhuva.\n\nBrett slapped the cold wrists, rubbed the clammy hands. Dhuva stirred,\nmoaned weakly. Brett pulled him to a sitting position. \"Wake up!\" he\nwhispered. \"Wake up!\"\n\nDhuva's eyelids fluttered. He blinked dully at Brett.\n\n\"The Gels may turn up any minute,\" Brett hissed. \"We have to get away\nfrom here. Can you walk?\"\n\n\"I saw it,\" said Dhuva faintly. \"But it moved so fast ...\"\n\n\"You're safe here for the moment,\" Brett said. \"There are none of them\naround. But they may be back. We've got to find a way out!\"\n\nDhuva started up, staring around. \"Where am I?\" he said hoarsely. Brett\nseized his arm, steadied him on his feet.\n\n\"We're in a hollowed-out cave,\" he said. \"The whole city is undermined\nwith them. They're connected by tunnels. We have to find one leading\nback to the surface.\"\n\nDhuva gazed around at the acres of bones. \"It left me here for dead.\"\n\n\"Or to die,\" said Brett.\n\n\"Look at them,\" Dhuva breathed. \"Hundreds ... thousands ...\"\n\n\"The whole population, it looks like. The Gels must have whisked them\ndown here one by one.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"For interfering with the scenes. But that doesn't matter now. What\nmatters is getting out. Come on. I see tunnels on the other side.\"\n\nThey crossed the broad floor, around them the white bones, the rustle of\nrats. They reached the far side of the cave, picked a six-foot tunnel\nwhich trended upward, a trickle of water seeping out of the dark mouth.\nThey started up the slope.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"We have to have a weapon against the Gels,\" said Brett.\n\n\"Why? I don't want to fight them.\" Dhuva's voice was thin, frightened.\n\"I want to get away from here ... even back to Wavly. I'd rather face\nthe Duke.\"\n\n\"This was a real town, once,\" said Brett. \"The Gels have taken it over,\nhollowed out the buildings, mined the earth under it, killed off the\npeople, and put imitation people in their place. And nobody ever knew. I\nmet a man who's lived here all his life. He doesn't know. But we know\n... and we have to do something about it.\"\n\n\"It's not our business. I've had enough. I want to get away.\"\n\n\"The Gels must stay down below, somewhere in that maze of tunnels. For\nsome reason they try to keep up appearances ... but only for the people\nwho belong here. They play out scenes for the fat man, wherever he goes.\nAnd he never goes anywhere he isn't expected to.\"\n\n\"We'll get over the wall somehow,\" said Dhuva. \"We may starve, crossing\nthe dry fields, but that's better than this.\"\n\nThey emerged from the tunnel into a coal bin, crossed to a sagging door,\nfound themselves in a boiler room. Stairs led up to sunlight. In the\nstreet, in the shadow of tall buildings, a boxy sedan was parked at the\ncurb. Brett went to it, tried the door. It opened. Keys dangled from the\nignition switch. He slid into the dusty seat. Behind him there was a\nhoarse scream. Brett looked up. Through the streaked windshield he saw a\nmighty Gel rear up before Dhuva, who crouched back against the blackened\nbrick front of the building.\n\n\"Don't move, Dhuva!\" Brett shouted. Dhuva stood frozen, flattened\nagainst the wall. The Gel towered, its surface rippling.\n\nBrett eased from the seat. He stood on the pavement, fifteen feet from\nthe Gel. The rank Gel odor came in waves from the creature. Beyond it he\ncould see Dhuva's white terrified face.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSilently Brett turned the latch of the old-fashioned auto hood, raised\nit. The copper fuel line curved down from the firewall to a glass\nsediment cup. The knurled retaining screw turned easily; the cup dropped\ninto Brett's hand. Gasoline ran down in an amber stream. Brett pulled\noff his damp coat, wadded it, jammed it under the flow. Over his\nshoulder he saw Dhuva, still rigid--and the Gel, hovering, uncertain.\n\nThe coat was saturated with gasoline now. Brett fumbled a match box from\nhis pocket. Wet. He threw the sodden container aside. The battery caught\nhis eye, clamped in a rusted frame under the hood. He jerked the pistol\nfrom its holster, used it to short the terminals. Tiny blue sparks\njumped. He jammed the coat near, rasped the gun against the soft lead\npoles. With a whoosh! the coat caught; yellow flames leaped,\nsoot-rimmed. Brett snatched at a sleeve, whirled the coat high. The\ngreat Gel, attracted by the sudden motion, rushed at him. He flung the\nblazing garment over the monster, leaped aside.\n\nThe creature went mad. It slumped, lashed itself against the pavement.\nThe burning coat was thrown clear. The Gel threw itself across the\npavement, into the gutter, sending a splatter of filthy water over\nBrett. From the corner of his eye, Brett saw Dhuva seize the burning\ncoat, hurl it into the pooled gasoline in the gutter. Fire leaped twenty\nfeet high; in its center the great Gel bucked and writhed. The ancient\ncar shuddered as the frantic monster struck it. Black smoke boiled up;\nan unbelievable stench came to Brett's nostrils. He backed, coughing.\nFlames roared around the front of the car. Paint blistered and burned. A\ntire burst. In a final frenzy, the Gel whipped clear, lay, a great\nblackened shape of melting rubber, twitching, then still.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"They've tunneled under everything,\" Brett said. \"They've cut through\npower lines and water lines, concrete, steel, earth; they've left the\nshell, shored up with spidery-looking trusswork. Somehow they've kept\nwater and power flowing to wherever they needed it--\"\n\n\"I don't care about your theories,\" Dhuva said; \"I only want to get\naway.\"\n\n\"It's bound to work, Dhuva. I need your help.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I'll have to try alone.\" He turned away.\n\n\"Wait,\" Dhuva called. He came up to Brett. \"I owe you a life; you saved\nmine. I can't let you down now. But if this doesn't work ... or if you\ncan't find what you want--\"\n\n\"Then we'll go.\"\n\nTogether they turned down a side street, walking rapidly. At the next\ncorner Brett pointed.\n\n\"There's one!\" They crossed to the service station at a run. Brett tried\nthe door. Locked. He kicked at it, splintered the wood around the lock.\nHe glanced around inside. \"No good,\" he called. \"Try the next building.\nI'll check the one behind.\"\n\nHe crossed the wide drive, battered in a door, looked in at a floor\ncovered with wood shavings. It ended ten feet from the door. Brett went\nto the edge, looked down. Diagonally, forty feet away, the underground\nfifty-thousand-gallon storage tank which supplied the gasoline pumps of\nthe station perched, isolated, on a column of striated clay, ribbed\nwith chitinous Gel buttresses. The truncated feed lines ended six feet\nfrom the tank. From Brett's position, it was impossible to say whether\nthe ends were plugged.\n\nAcross the dark cavern a square of light appeared. Dhuva stood in a\ndoorway looking toward Brett.\n\n\"Over here, Dhuva!\" Brett uncoiled his rope, arranged a slip-noose. He\nmeasured the distance with his eye, tossed the loop. It slapped the top\nof the tank, caught on a massive fitting. He smashed the glass from a\nwindow, tied the end of the rope to the center post. Dhuva arrived,\nwatched as Brett went to the edge, hooked his legs over the rope, and\nstarted across to the tank.\n\nIt was an easy crossing. Brett's feet clanged against the tank. He\nstraddled the six-foot cylinder, worked his way to the end, then\nclambered down to the two two-inch feed lines. He tested their\nresilience, then lay flat, eased out on them. There were plugs of hard\nwaxy material in the cut ends of the pipes. Brett poked at them with the\npistol. Chunks loosened and fell. He worked for fifteen minutes before\nthe first trickle came. Two minutes later, two thick streams of gasoline\nwere pouring down into the darkness.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett and Dhuva piled sticks, scraps of paper, shavings, and lumps of\ncoal around a core of gasoline-soaked rags. Directly above the heaped\ntinder a taut rope stretched from the window post to a child's wagon,\nthe steel bed of which contained a second heap of combustibles. The\nwagon hung half over the ragged edge of the floor.\n\n\"It should take about fifteen minutes for the fire to burn through the\nrope,\" Brett said. \"Then the wagon will fall and dump the hot coals in\nthe gasoline. By then it will have spread all over the surface and\nflowed down side tunnels into other parts of the cavern system.\"\n\n\"But it may not get them all.\"\n\n\"It will get some of them. It's the best we can do right now. You get\nthe fire going in the wagon; I'll start this one up.\"\n\nDhuva sniffed the air. \"That fluid,\" he said. \"We know it in Wavly as\nphlogistoneum. The wealthy use it for cooking.\"\n\n\"We'll use it to cook Gels.\" Brett struck a match. The fire leaped up,\nsmoking. Dhuva watched, struck his match awkwardly, started his blaze.\nThey stood for a moment watching. The nylon curled and blackened,\nmelting in the heat.\n\n\"We'd better get moving,\" Brett said. \"It doesn't look as though it will\nlast fifteen minutes.\"\n\nThey stepped out into the street. Behind them wisps of smoke curled from\nthe door. Dhuva seized Brett's arm. \"Look!\"\n\nHalf a block away the fat man in the panama hat strode toward them at\nthe head of a group of men in grey flannel. \"That's him!\" the fat man\nshouted, \"the one I told you about. I knew the scoundrel would be back!\"\nHe slowed, eyeing Brett and Dhuva warily.\n\n\"You'd better get away from here, fast!\" Brett called. \"There'll be an\nexplosion in a few minutes--\"\n\n\"Smoke!\" the fat man yelped. \"Fire! They've set fire to the city! There\nit is! pouring out of the window ... and the door!\" He started forward.\nBrett yanked the pistol from the holster, thumbed back the hammer.\n\n\"Stop right there!\" he barked. \"For your own good I'm telling you to\nrun. I don't care about that crowd of golems you've collected, but I'd\nhate to see a real human get hurt--even a cowardly one like you.\"\n\n\"These are honest citizens,\" the fat man gasped, standing, staring at\nthe gun. \"You won't get away with this. We all know you. You'll be dealt\nwith ...\"\n\n\"We're going now. And you're going too.\"\n\n\"You can't kill us all,\" the fat man said. He licked his lips. \"We won't\nlet you destroy our city.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAs the fat man turned to exhort his followers Brett fired, once twice,\nthree times. Three golems fell on their faces. The fat man whirled.\n\n\"Devil!\" he shrieked. \"A killer is abroad!\" He charged, mouth open.\nBrett ducked aside, tripped the fat man. He fell heavily, slamming his\nface against the pavement. The golems surged forward. Brett and Dhuva\nslammed punches to the sternum, took clumsy blows on the shoulder, back,\nchest. Golems fell. Brett ducked a wild swing, toppled his attacker,\nturned to see Dhuva deal with the last of the dummies. The fat man sat\nin the street, dabbing at his bleeding nose, the panama still in place.\n\n\"Get up,\" Brett commanded. \"There's no time left.\"\n\n\"You've killed them. Killed them all ...\" The fat man got to his feet,\nthen turned suddenly and plunged for the door from which a cloud of\nsmoke poured. Brett hauled him back. He and Dhuva started off, dragging\nthe struggling man between them. They had gone a block when their\nprisoner, with a sudden frantic jerk, freed himself, set off at a run\nfor the fire.\n\n\"Let him go!\" Dhuva cried. \"It's too late to go back!\"\n\nThe fat man leaped fallen golems, wrestled with the door, disappeared\ninto the smoke. Brett and Dhuva sprinted for the corner. As they\nrounded it a tremendous blast shook the street. The pavement before them\nquivered, opened in a wide crack. A ten-foot section dropped from view.\nThey skirted the gaping hole, dashed for safety as the facades along the\nstreet cracked, fell in clouds of dust. The street trembled under a\nsecond explosion. Cracks opened, dust rising in puffs from the long\nwavering lines. Masonry collapsed around them. They put their heads down\nand ran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinded, Brett and Dhuva walked through the empty streets of the city.\nBehind them, smoke blackened the sky. Embers floated down around them.\nThe odor of burning Gel was carried on the wind. The late sun shone on\nthe blank pavement. A lone golem in a tasseled fez, left over from the\nmorning's parade, leaned stiffly against a lamp post, eyes blank. Empty\ncars sat in driveways. TV antennae stood forlornly against the sunset.\n\n\"That place looks lived-in,\" said Brett, indicating an open apartment\nwindow with a curtain billowing above a potted geranium. \"I'll take a\nlook.\"\n\nHe came back shaking his head. \"They were all in the TV room. They\nlooked so natural at first; I mean, they didn't look up or anything when\nI walked in. I turned the set off. The electricity is still working\nanyway. Wonder how long it will last?\"\n\nThey turned down a residential street. Underfoot the pavement trembled\nat a distant blast. They skirted a crack, kept going. Occasional golems\nstood in awkward poses or lay across sidewalks. One, clad in black,\ntilted awkwardly in a gothic entry of fretted stone work. \"I guess there\nwon't be any church this Sunday,\" said Brett.\n\nHe halted before a brown brick apartment house. An untended hose welled\non a patch of sickly lawn. Brett went to the door, stood listening, then\nwent in. Across the room the still figure of a woman sat in a rocker. A\ncurl stirred on her smooth forehead. A flicker of expression seemed to\ncross the lined face. Brett started forward. \"Don't be afraid. You can\ncome with us--\"\n\nHe stopped. A flapping window-shade cast restless shadows on the still\ngolem features on which dust was already settling. Brett turned away,\nshaking his head.\n\n\"All of them,\" he said. \"It's as though they were snipped out of paper.\nWhen the Gels died their dummies died with them.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Dhuva. \"What does it all mean?\"\n\n\"Mean?\" said Brett. He shook his head, started off again along the\nstreet. \"It doesn't mean anything. It's just the way things are.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBrett sat in a deserted Cadillac, tuning the radio.\n\n\"... anybody hear me?\" said a plaintive voice from the speaker. \"This is\nAb Gullorian, at the Twin Spires. Looks like I'm the only one left\nalive. Can anybody hear me?\"\n\nBrett tuned. \"... been asking the wrong questions ... looking for the\nFinal Fact. Now these are strange matters, brothers. But if a flower\nblooms, what man shall ask why? What lore do we seek in a symphony...?\"\n\nHe twisted the knob again. \"... Kansas City. Not more than half a dozen\nof us. And the dead! Piled all over the place. But it's a funny thing:\nDoc Potter started to do an autopsy--\"\n\nBrett turned the knob. \"... CQ, CQ, CQ. This is Hollip Quate, calling\nCQ, CQ. There's been a disaster here at Port Wanderlust. We need--\"\n\n\"Take Jesus into your hearts,\" another station urged.\n\n\"... to base,\" the radio said faintly, with much crackling. \"Lunar\nObservatory to base. Come in, Lunar Control. This is Commander McVee of\nthe Lunar Detachment, sole survivor--\"\n\n\"... hello, Hollip Quate? Hollip Quate? This is Kansas City calling.\nSay, where did you say you were calling from...?\"\n\n\"It looks as though both of us had a lot of mistaken ideas about the\nworld outside,\" said Brett. \"Most of these stations sound as though they\nmight as well be coming from Mars.\"\n\n\"I don't understand where the voices come from,\" Dhuva said. \"But all\nthe places they name are strange to me ... except the Twin Spires.\"\n\n\"I've heard of Kansas City,\" Brett said, \"but none of the other ones.\"\n\nThe ground trembled. A low rumble rolled. \"Another one,\" Brett said. He\nswitched off the radio, tried the starter. It groaned, turned over. The\nengine caught, sputtered, then ran smoothly.\n\n\"Get in, Dhuva. We might as well ride. Which way do we go to get out of\nthis place?\"\n\n\"The wall lies in that direction,\" said Dhuva. \"But I don't know about a\ngate.\"\n\n\"We'll worry about that when we get to it,\" said Brett. \"This whole\nplace is going to collapse before long. We really started something. I\nsuppose other underground storage tanks caught--and gas lines, too.\"\n\nA building ahead cracked, fell in a heap of pulverized plaster. The car\nbucked as a blast sent a ripple down the street. A manhole cover popped\nup, clattered a few feet, dropped from sight. Brett swerved, gunned the\ncar. It leaped over rubble, roared along the littered pavement. Brett\nlooked in the rear-view mirror. A block behind them the street ended.\nSmoke and dust rose from the immense pit.\n\n\"We just missed it that time!\" he called. \"How far to the wall?\"\n\n\"Not far! Turn here ...\"\n\nBrett rounded the corner with a shrieking of tires. Ahead the grey wall\nrose up, blank, featureless.\n\n\"This is a dead end!\" Brett shouted.\n\n\"We'd better get out and run for it--\"\n\n\"No time! I'm going to ram the wall! Maybe I can knock a hole in it.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nDhuva crouched; teeth gritted, Brett held the accelerator to the floor,\nroared straight toward the wall. The heavy car shot across the last few\nyards, struck--\n\nAnd burst through a curtain of canvas into a field of dry stalks.\n\nBrett steered the car in a wide curve to halt and look back. A blackened\npanama hat floated down, settled among the stalks. Smoke poured up in a\ndense cloud from behind the canvas wall. A fetid stench pervaded the\nair.\n\n\"That finishes that, I guess,\" Brett said.\n\n\"I don't know. Look there.\"\n\nBrett turned. Far across the dry field columns of smoke rose from the\nground.\n\n\"The whole thing's undermined,\" Brett said. \"How far does it go?\"\n\n\"No telling. But we'd better be off. Perhaps we can get beyond the edge\nof it. Not that it matters. We're all that's left ...\"\n\n\"You sound like the fat man,\" Brett said. \"But why should we be so\nsurprised to find out the truth? After all, we never saw it before. All\nwe knew--or thought we knew--was what they told us. The moon, the other\nside of the world, a distant city ... or even the next town. How do we\nreally know what's there ... unless we go and see for ourselves? Does a\ngoldfish in his bowl know what the ocean is like?\"\n\n\"Where did they come from, those Gels? How much of the world have they\nundermined? What about Wavly? Is it a golem country too? The Duke ...\nand all the people I knew?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Dhuva. I've been wondering about the people in Casperton.\nLike Doc Welch. I used to see him in the street with his little black\nbag. I always thought it was full of pills and scalpels; but maybe it\nreally had zebra's tails and toad's eyes in it. Maybe he's really a\nmagician on his way to cast spells against demons. Maybe the people I\nused to see hurrying to catch the bus every morning weren't really going\nto the office. Maybe they go down into caves and chip away at the\nfoundations of things. Maybe they go up on rooftops and put on\nrainbow-colored robes and fly away. I used to pass by a bank in\nCasperton: a big grey stone building with little curtains over the\nbottom half of the windows. I never go in there. I don't have anything\nto do in a bank. I've always thought it was full of bankers, banking ...\nNow I don't know. It could be anything ...\"\n\n\"That's why I'm afraid,\" Dhuva said. \"It could be anything.\"\n\n\"Things aren't really any different than they were,\" said Brett, \"...\nexcept that now we know.\" He turned the big car out across the field\ntoward Casperton.\n\n\"I don't know what we'll find when we get back. Aunt Haicey, Pretty-Lee\n... But there's only one way to find out.\"\n\nThe moon rose as the car bumped westward, raising a trail of dust\nagainst the luminous sky of evening.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The body shifted, rotating stiffly, then tilted upright.\n\n\"The sun struck through the amber shape that flowed down to form itself\ninto the crested wave.\"\n\nsee IT COULD BE ANYTHING\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ January 1963.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
