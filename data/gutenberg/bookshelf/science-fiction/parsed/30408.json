The dynamo hummed\nand whined and the night silence outside seemed to make the noises\nwithin more deafening. Tommy Reames ran his eyes again over the\npower-leads to the monstrous, misshapen coils. Professor Denham bent\nover one of them, straightened, and nodded. Tommy Reames nodded to\nEvelyn, and she threw the heavy multiple-pole switch.\n\nThere was a flash of jumping current. The masses of metal on the floor\nseemed to leap into ungainly life. The whine of the dynamo rose to a\nscream and its brushes streaked blue flame. The metal things on the\nfloor flicked together and were a tube, three feet and more in\ndiameter. That tube writhed and twisted. It began to form itself into\nan awkward and seemingly impossible shape, while metal surfaces\nsliding on each other produced screams that cut through the din of the\nmotor and dynamo. The writhing tube strained and wriggled. Then there\nwas a queer, inaudible _snap_ and something gave. A part of the tube\nquivered into nothingness. Another part hurt the eyes that looked upon\nit.\n\nAnd then there was the smell of burned insulation and a wire was\narcing somewhere, while thick rubbery smoke arose. A fuse blew out\nwith a thunderous report, and Tommy Reames leaped to the suddenly\nracing motor-generator. The motor died amid gasps and rumblings. And\nTommy Reames looked anxiously at the Fifth-Dimension Tube.\n\nIt was important, that Tube. Through it, Tommy Reames and Professor\nDenham had reason to believe they could travel to another universe, of\nwhich other men had only dreamed. And it was important in other ways,\ntoo. At the moment Evelyn Denham threw the switch, last-edition\nnewspapers in Chicago were showing headlines about \"King\" Jacaro's\nforfeiture of two hundred thousand dollars' bail by failing to appear\nin court. King Jacaro was a lord of racketeerdom.\n\nWhile Tommy inspected the Tube anxiously, a certain chief of police in\na small town upstate was telling feverishly over the telephone of a\nposse having killed a monster lizard by torchlight, having discovered\nit in the act of devouring a cow. The lizard was eight feet high,\nwalked on its hind legs, and had a collar of solid gold about its\nneck. And jewel importers, in New York, were in anxious conference\nabout a flood of untraced jewels upon the market. Their origin was\nunknown. The Fifth-Dimension Tube ultimately affected all of those\naffairs, and the Death Mist as well. And--though it was not considered\ndangerous then--everybody remembers the Death Mist now.\n\nBut at the moment Professor Denham stared at the Tube concernedly, his\ndaughter Evelyn shivered from pure excitement as she looked at it, and\na red-headed man named Smithers looked impassively from the Tube to\nTommy Reames and back again. He'd done most of the mechanical work on\nthe Tube's parts, and he was as anxious as the rest. But nobody\nthought of the world outside the laboratory.\n\nProfessor Denham moved suddenly. He was nearest to the open end of the\nTube. He sniffed curiously and seemed to listen. Within seconds the\nothers became aware of a new smell in the laboratory. It seemed to\ncome from the Tube itself, and it was a warm, damp smell that could\nonly be imagined as coming from a jungle in the tropics. There were\nthe rich odors of feverishly growing things; the heavy fragrance of\nunknown tropic blossoms, and a background of some curious blend of\nscents and smells which was alien and luring, and exotic. The whole\nwas like the smell of another planet of the jungles of a strange world\nwhich men had never trod. And then, definitely coming out of the Tube,\nthere was a hollow, booming noise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been echoed and re-echoed amid the twistings of the Tube, but\nonly an animal could have made it. It grew louder, a monstrous roar.\nThen yells sounded suddenly above it--human yells, wild yells, insane,\nhalf-gibbering yells of hysterical excitement and blood lust. The\nbeast-thing bellowed and an ululating chorus of joyous screams arose.\nThe laboratory reverberated with the thunderous noise. Then there was\nthe sound of crashing and of paddings, and abruptly the noise was\ndiminishing as if its source were moving farther away. The beast-thing\nroared and bellowed as if in agony, and the yelling noise seemed to\nshow that men were following close upon its flanks.\n\nThose in the laboratory seemed to awaken as if from a bad dream.\nDenham was kneeling before the mouth of the Tube, an automatic rifle\nin his hands. Tommy Reames stood grimly before Evelyn. He'd snatched\nup a pair of automatic pistols. Smithers clutched a spanner and\nwatched the mouth of the Tube with a strained attention. Evelyn stood\nshivering behind Tommy.\n\nTommy said with a hint of grim humor:\n\n\"I don't think there's any doubt about the Tube having gotten through.\nThat's the Fifth Dimension planet, all right.\"\n\nHe smiled at Evelyn. She was deathly pale.\n\n\"I--remember--hearing noises like that....\"\n\nDenham stood up. He painstakingly slipped on the safety of his rifle\nand laid it on a bench with the other guns. There was a small arsenal\non a bench at one side of the laboratory. The array looked much more\nlike arms for in expedition into dangerous territory than a normal\npart of apparatus for an experiment in rather abstruse mathematical\nphysics. There were even gas masks on the bench, and some of those\nconverted brass Very pistols now used only for discharging tear- and\nsternutatory-gas bombs.\n\n\"The Tube wasn't seen, anyhow,\" said Professor Denham briskly. \"Who's\ngoing through first?\"\n\nTommy slung a cartridge belt about his waist and a gas mask about his\nneck.\n\n\"I am,\" he said shortly. \"We'll want to camouflage the mouth of the\nTube. I'll watch a bit before I get out.\"\n\nHe crawled into the mouth of the twisted pipe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Tube was nearly three feet across, each section was five feet\nlong, and there were gigantic solenoids at each end of each section.\n\nIt was not an experiment made at random, nor was the world to which it\nreached an unknown one to Tommy or to Denham. Months before, Denham\nhad built an instrument which would bend a ray of light into the Fifth\nDimension and had found that he could fix a telescope to the device\nand look into a new and wholly strange cosmos.[1] He had seen\ntree-fern jungles and a monstrous red sun, and all the flora and fauna\nof a planet in the carboniferous period of development. More, by the\naccident of its placing he had seen the towers and the pinnacles of a\ncity whose walls and towers seemed plated with gold.\n\n    [1] \"The Fifth-Dimension Catapult\"--see the January, 1931,\n        issue of Astounding Stories.\n\nHaving gone so far, he had devised a catapult which literally flung\nobjects to the surface of that incredible world. Insects, birds, and\nat last a cat had made the journey unharmed, and he had built a steel\nglobe in which to attempt the journey in person. His daughter Evelyn\nhad demanded to accompany him, and he believed it safe. The trip had\nbeen made in security, but return was another matter. A laboratory\nassistant, Von Holtz, had sent them into the Fifth Dimension, only to\nbetray them. One King Jacaro, lord of Chicago racketeers, was\nconvinced by him of the existence of the golden city of that other\nworld, and that it was full of delectable loot. He offered a bribe\npast envy for the secret of Denham's apparatus. And Von Holtz had\nremoved the apparatus for Denham's return before working the catapult\nto send him on his strange journey. He wanted to be free to sell full\nprivileges of rapine and murder to Jacaro.\n\nThe result was unexpected. Von Holtz could not unravel the secret of\nthe catapult he himself had operated. He could not sell the secret for\nwhich he had committed a crime. In desperation he called in Tommy\nReames--rather more than an amateur in mathematical physics--showed\nhim Evelyn and her father marooned in a tree-fern jungle, and\nhypocritically asked for aid.\n\nTommy's enthusiastic efforts soon became more than merely\nenthusiastic. The men of the Golden City remained invisible, but there\nwere strange, half-mad outlaws of the jungles who hated the city.\nTommy Reames had watched helplessly as they hunted for the occupants\nof the steel globe. He had worked frenziedly to achieve a rescue. In\nthe course of his labor he discovered the treachery of Von Holtz as\nwell as the secret of the catapult, and with the aid of Smithers--who\nhad helped to build the original catapult--he made a new small device\nto achieve the original end.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole affair came to an end on one mad afternoon when the Ragged\nMen captured first an inhabitant of the Golden City, and then Denham\nand Evelyn in a forlorn attempt at rescue. Tommy Reames went mad. He\nused a tiny sub-machine gun upon the Ragged Men through the model\nmagnetic catapult he had made, and contrived communication with Denham\nafterward. Instructed by Denham, he brought about the return of father\nand daughter to Earth just before Ragged Men and Earthling alike would\nhave perished in a vengeful gas cloud from the Golden City. Even then,\nthough, his triumph was incomplete because Von Holtz had gotten word\nto Jacaro, and nattily-dressed gunmen raided the laboratory and made\noff with the model catapult, leaving three bullets in Tommy and one in\nSmithers as souvenirs.\n\nNow, using the principle developed in the catapult, Tommy and Denham\nhad built a large Tube, and as Tommy climbed along its corrugated\ninterior he knew a good part of what he should expect at the other\nend. A steady current of air blew past him. It was laden with a myriad\nunfamiliar scents. The Tube was a tunnel from one set of dimensions to\nanother, a permanent way from Earth to a strange, carboniferous-period\nplanet on which a monstrous dull-red sun shone hotly. Tommy should\ncome out into a tree-fern forest whose lush vegetation would hide the\nsky, and which furnished a lurking place not only for strange\nreptilian monsters akin to those of the long-dead past of Earth, but\nfor the bands of ragged, half-mad human beings who were outlaws from\nthe civilization of which Denham and Evelyn had seen proofs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy reached the third bend in the Tube. By now he had lost all sense\nof orientation. An object may be bent through one right angle only in\ntwo dimensions, and a second perfect right angle--at ninety degrees to\nall former paths--only in three dimensions. It follows that a third\nperfect right angle requires four dimensions for existence, and four\nperfect right angles five. The Tube bent itself through four perfect\nright angles, and since no human-being can ever have experience of\nmore than three dimensions, plus time, it followed that Tommy was\nexperiencing other dimensions than those of Earth as soon as he passed\nthe third bend. In short, he was in another cosmos.\n\nThere was a moment of awful sickness as he passed the third bend. He\nwas hideously dizzy when he passed the fourth. For a time he felt as\nif he had no weight at all. But then, quite abruptly, he was climbing\nvertically upward and the soughing of tree-fern fronds was loud in his\nears, and suddenly the end of the Tube was under his fingers and he\nstared out into the world of the Fifth Dimension.\n\nNow a gentle wind blew in his face. Tree-ferns rose to incredible\nheights above his head, and now and again by the movements of their\nfronds he caught stray glimpses of unfamiliar stars. There were red\nstars, and blue ones, and once he caught sight of a clearly\ndistinguishable double star, of which each component was visible to\nthe naked eye. And very, very far away he heard the beastly yellings\nhe knew must be the outlaws, the Ragged Men, feasting horribly on\nhalf-scorched flesh torn from the quivering, yet-living flanks of a\nmonstrous reptile.\n\nSomething moved, whimpered--and fled suddenly. It sounded like a human\nbeing. And Tommy Reames was struck with the utterly impossible\nconviction that he had heard just that sound before. It was not\ndangerous, in any case, and he watched, and listened, and presently he\nslipped from the mouth of the Tube and by the glow of a flashlight\nstripped foliage from nearby growths and piled it about the Tube's\nmouth. And then, because the purpose of the Tube was not adventure but\nscience, he went back down into the laboratory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three men, with Evelyn, worked until dawn at the rest of their\npreparations for the use of the Tube. All that time the laboratory was\nfilled with the heavy fragrance of a tree-fern jungle upon an unknown\nplanet. The heavy, sickly-sweet scents of closed jungle blossoms\nfilled their nostrils. The reek of feverishly growing green things\nsaturated the air. A steady wind blew down the Tube, and it bore\ninnumerable unfamiliar odors into the laboratory. Once a gigantic moth\nbumped and blundered into the Tube, and finally crawled heavily out\ninto the light. It was scaled, and terrible because of its monstrous\nsize, but it had broken a wing and could not fly. So it crawled with\nfeverish haste toward a brilliant electric light. Its eyes were\nespecially horrible because they were not compound like the moths of\nEarth. They were single, like those of a man, and were fixed in an\nexpression of utter, fascinated hypnosis. The thing looked horribly\nhuman with those eyes staring from an insect's head, and Smithers\nkilled it in a flash of nerve-racked horror. None of them were able to\ngo on with their work until the thing and its fascinated, staring eyes\nhad been put out of sight. Then they labored on with the smell of the\njungles of that unnamed planet thick about them, and noises now and\nthen coming down the Tube. There were roars, and growlings, and once\nthere was a thin high sound which seemed like the far-distant,\ndeath-startled scream of a man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Death Mist_\n\n\nTommy Reames saw the red sun rise while he was on guard at the mouth\nof the Tube. The tree-ferns above him came into view as vague gray\noutlines. The many-colored stars grew pale. And presently a bit of\ncrimson light peeped through the jungle somewhere. It moved along the\nhorizon and very slowly grew higher. For a moment, Tommy saw the huge,\ndull-red ball that was the sun of this alien planet. Queer mosses took\nform and color in the daylight, displaying colors never seen on Earth.\nHe saw flying things dart among the tree-fern fronds, and some were\nscaled and some were not, but none of them were feathered.\n\nThen a tiny buzzing noise. The telephone that now rested below the lip\nof the Tube was being used from the laboratory.\n\n\"Smithers will relieve you,\" said Denham's voice in the receiver.\n\"Come on down. We're not the only people experimenting with the Fifth\nDimension. Jacaro's been working, and all hell's loose!\"\n\nTommy slid down the Tube in an instant. The four right-angled turns\nmade him sick and dizzy again, but he came out with his jaw set\ngrimly. There was good reason for Tommy's interest in Jacaro. Besides\nsides three bullet wounds, Tommy owed Jacaro something for stealing\nthe first model Tube.\n\nHe emerged in the laboratory on his hands and knees as the size of the\nTube made necessary. Smithers smiled placidly at him and crawled in to\ntake his place.\n\n\"What the devil happened?\" demanded Tommy.\n\nDenham was bitter. He held a newspaper before him. Evelyn had brought\ncoffee and the morning paper to the laboratory. She seemed rather\npale.\n\n\"Jacaro's gotten through too!\" snapped Denham. \"He's gotten in a pack\nof trouble. And he's loosed the devil on Earth. Here--look!\" He jabbed\nhis finger at one headline. \"And here--and here!\" He thrust at others.\n\"Here's proof.\"\n\nThe first headline read: \"KING JACARO FORFEITS BOND.\" Smaller headings\nbeneath it read: \"Racketeer Missing for Income Tax Trial. $200,000\nBail Forfeited.\" The second headline was in smaller type: \"Monster\nLizard Killed! Giant Meat Eater Brought Down by Rifleman. Akin to\nAncient Dinosaurs, Say Scientists.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Jacaro's missing,\" said Denham harshly. \"This article says he's\nvanished, and with him a dozen of his most prominent gunmen. You know\nhe had a model catapult to duplicate--the one he got from you. Von\nHoltz could arrange the construction of a big Tube for him. And he\nknew about the Golden City. Look!\"\n\nHis finger, trembling, tapped on the flashlight picture of the giant\nlizard of which the story told. And it was a giant. A rope had upheld\na colossal, leering, reptilian head while men with rifles posed\nself-consciously beside the dead creature. It was as big as a horse,\nand at first glance its kinship to the extinct dinosaurs of Earth was\nplain. Huge teeth in sharklike rows. A long, trailing tail. But there\nwas a collar about the beast-thing's neck.\n\n\"It had killed and was devouring a cow when they shot it,\" said Denham\nbitterly. \"There've been reports of these creatures for days--so the\nnews story says. They weren't printed because nobody believed them.\nBut there are a couple of people missing. A searching party was\nhunting for them. They found this!\"\n\nTommy Reames stared at the picture. His face went grimmer still. He\nthought of sounds he had heard beyond the Tube, not long since.\n\n\"There's no question where they came from. The Fifth Dimension. But if\nJacaro brought them back, he's a fool.\"\n\n\"Jacaro's missing,\" said Denham savagely. \"Don't you understand? He\ncould get through to the Golden City. These beast-things are proof\nsomebody did. And these things came down the Tube that somebody\ntravelled through. Jacaro wouldn't send them, but somebody did.\nThey've got collars around their necks! Who sent them? And why?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"If civilized men found the mouth of a Tube, it would seem like the\nmouth of an artificial tunnel or a cave--\"\n\n\"And if annoying vermin, like Jacaro's gunmen\"--Denham's voice was\nbrittle--\"had come out of it, why, intelligent men might send\nsomething living and deadly down it, as men on Earth will send ferrets\ndown a rat-hole! To wipe out the breed! That's what's happened!\nJacaro's gone through and attacked the Golden City. They've found his\nTube. And they've sent these things down....\"\n\n\"If _we_ found rats coming from a rat-hole,\" said Tommy very quietly,\n\"and ferrets went down and didn't come up, we'd gas them.\"\n\n\"And so,\" Denham told him, \"so would the Golden City.\"\n\nHe pointed to a boxed double paragraph news story under leaded\ntwenty-point headline: \"Poisonous Fog Kills Wild Life.\"\n\nThe story was not alarming. It said merely that state game wardens had\nfound numerous dead game animals in a thinly-settled district near\nColtsville, N.Y., and on investigation had found a bank of mist, all\nof half a mile across, which seemed to have caused the trouble. State\nchemists and biologists were investigating the phenomenon. Curiously,\nthe bank of mist seemed not to dissipate in a normal fashion. Samples\nof the fog were being analyzed. It was probably akin to the Belgian\nfogs which on several occasions had caused much loss of life. The mist\nwas especially interesting because in sunlight it displayed prismatic\ncolorings. State troopers were warning the inhabitants of the\nneighborhood.\n\n\"The gassing's started,\" said Denham savagely. \"I know a gas that\nshows rainbow colors. The Golden City uses it. So we've got to find\nJacaro's Tube and seal it, or only God knows what will come out of it\nnext. I'm going off, Tommy. You and Smithers guard our Tube. Blow it\nup, if necessary. It's dangerous. I'll get some authority in Albany,\nand we'll find Jacaro's Tube and blast it shut.\"\n\nTommy nodded, his eyes keen and thoughtful. Denham hurried out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMinutes later, only, they heard the roar of a car motor going down the\nlong lane away from the laboratory. Evelyn tried to smile at Tommy.\n\n\"It seems terrible, dangerous.\"\n\nTommy considered and shrugged.\n\n\"This news is old,\" he observed. \"This paper was printed last night. I\nthink I'll make a couple of long-distance calls. If the Golden City's\nhad trouble with Jacaro, it's going to make things bad for us.\"\n\nHe swept his eyes about and frowningly loaded a light rifle. He put it\nconvenient to Evelyn's hand and made for the dwelling-house and the\ntelephone. It was odd that as he emerged into the open air, the\nfamiliar smells of Earth struck his nostrils as strange and\nunaccustomed. The laboratory was redolent of the tree-fern forest into\nwhich the Tube extended. And Smithers was watching amid those dank,\nincredible carboniferous-period growths now.\n\nTommy put through calls, seeing all his and Denham's plans for a\npeaceful exploration party and amicable contact with the civilization\nof that other planet, utterly shattered by presumed outrages by\nJacaro. He made call after call, and his demands for information grew\nmore urgent as he got closer to the source of trouble. His cause for\nworry was verified long before he had finished. Even as he made the\nfirst call, New York newspapers had crowded a second-grade murder off\ntheir front pages to make room for the white mist upstate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe early-morning editions had termed it a \"poisonous fog.\" The\nbreakfast editions spoke of it as a \"poison fog.\" But it grew and\nmoved and by the time Tommy had a clear line to get actual information\nabout it, a tabloid had christened it the \"Death Mist\" and there were\nthree chartered planes circling about it for the benefit of their\nnewspapers. State troopers were being reinforced. At ten o'clock it\nwas necessary to post extra traffic police to take care of the cars\nheaded upstate to look at the mystery. At eleven it began to move!\nSluggishly, to be sure, and rather raggedly, but it undoubtedly moved,\nand as undoubtedly it moved independently of the wind.\n\nIt was at twelve-thirty that the first casualty occurred. Before that\ntime, the police had frantically demanded that the flood of sightseers\nbe stopped. The Death Mist covered a square mile or more. It clung to\nthe ground, nowhere more than fifty or sixty feet high, and glittered\nwith all the colors of the rainbow. It moved with a velocity of\nanywhere from ten to twenty miles an hour. In its path were a myriad\nsmall tragedies--nesting birds stiff and still, and rabbits and other\nsmall furry bodies contorted in queer agonized postures. But until\ntwelve-thirty no human beings were known to be its victims.\n\nThen, though, it was moving blindly across the wind with a thin\ntrailing edge behind it and a rolling billow of descending mist as its\nforefront. It rolled up to and across a concrete highway, watched by\nperspiring motor cops who had performed miracles in clearing a path\nfor it among the horde of sightseeing cars. It swept on into a\nspindling pine wood. Behind it lay a thinning sheet of vapor--thick\nwhite mist which seemed to rise and move more swiftly to overtake the\nmain body. It lay across the highway in a sheet which was ten feet\ndeep, then thinned to six, to three....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mist was no more than a foot thick, when a party of motorists\nessayed to drive through it as through a sheet of water. They dodged a\nswearing motorcycle cop and, yelling hilariously, plunged forward. It\nhappened that they had not more than a hundred yards to go, so the\nwhole thing was plainly seen.\n\nThe car was ten yards across the sheet of mist before the effect of\nits motion was apparent. Then the mist, torn by the car-eddy, swirled\nmadly in their wake. The motorists yelled delightedly. There is a\npicture extant, taken at just this moment. It shows the driver with a\nfoolish grin on his face, clutching the wheel and very obviously\nstepping on the accelerator. A pandemonium of triumphant, hilarious\nshouting--and then a very sudden silence.\n\nThe car roared on. The road curved slightly. The car did not. It went\noff the road, turned over, and its engine shrieked itself into\nsilence. The Death Mist went on, draining from the roadway to follow\nthe tall, prismatically-colored cloud. It moved swiftly and blindly.\nTo the circling planes above it, it seemed like a blind thing\nimagining itself confined, and searching for the edges of its prison.\nIt gave an uncanny impression of being directed by intelligence. But\nthe Death Mist, itself, was not alive.\n\nNeither were the occupants of the motor car.\n\nWhen Tommy got back to the laboratory after his last call for news, he\nfound Evelyn in the act of starting to fetch him.\n\n\"Smithers called,\" she said uneasily. \"He says something's moving\nabout--\" The buzzer of the telephone was humming stridently. Tommy\nanswered quickly.\n\n\"Just want you handy,\" said Smithers' calm voice. \"I might have to\nduck. Some Ragged Men are chasin' something. Get set, will ya?\"\n\n\"Ready for anything,\" Tommy assured him.\n\nThen he made it true: rifles handy, a sub-machine gun, grenades, gas\nmasks. He handed one to Evelyn. Smithers had one already. Then Tommy\nwaited, grimly ready by the Tube-mouth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe warm, scent-laden breeze blew upon him. Straining his ears, he\ncould hear the sound of tree-fern fronds clashing in the wind. He\nheard the louder sounds made by Smithers, stirring ever so slightly in\nthe Tube. And then he caught a vague, distant uproar. It would have\nbeen faint and confused at best but the Tube was partly blocked by\nSmithers' body, and there were the multiple bends further to\ncomplicate the echoes. It was no more than a formless tumult through\nwhich faint yells came occasionally. It drew nearer and nearer. Tommy\nheard Smithers stir suddenly, almost as if he had jumped. Then there\nwere scrapings which could only mean one thing: Smithers was climbing\nout of the Tube into the jungle of the Fifth-Dimension world.\n\nThe noise rose abruptly to a roar as the muffling effect of Smithers'\nbody was removed. The yells were sharp and savage and half mad. There\nwas a sudden crackling sound and a voice screamed:\n\n\"_Gott!_\"\n\nThe hair rose at the back of Tommy's neck. Then there came the\ndeafening report of an automatic pistol roaring itself empty above the\nend of the Tube. Smithers' voice, vastly calm:\n\n\"It's a'right, Mr. Reames. Don't worry.\"\n\nA second pistol took up the fusillade. Yells and howls and screams\narose. Men fled. Something came crashing to the mouth of the Tube.\nSmithers' voice again, with purring note in it: \"Get down there. I'll\nhold 'em off.\" Then single deliberately spaced shots, while something\ncame stumbling, fumbling, squirming down through the Tube, so filling\nit that Smithers' shooting was muted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen came the subtly different explosions of the Very pistols,\ndischarging gas bombs. And Tommy drew back, his jaw set, and he stood\nwith his weapons very ready indeed, and a scratched, bleeding,\nexhausted, panting, terror-stricken human being in the tattered\ncostume of Earth crawled from the Tube and groveled on the floor\nbefore him.\n\nEvelyn gave a little exclamation, partly of disgust and partly of\nhorror. Because this man, who had had come from the world of the Fifth\nDimension, was wholly familiar. He was tall, and he was lean,\nemaciated now; he wept sobbingly behind thick-lensed spectacles, and\nhis lips were far too full and red. His name was Von Holtz; he had\nonce been laboratory assistant to Professor Denham, and he had\nbetrayed Evelyn and her father to the most ghastly of possible fates\nfor a bribe offered him by Jacaro. Now he groveled. He was horrible to\nlook at. Where he was not scratched and torn his flesh was reddened as\nif by fire. He was exhausted, and trembling with an awful terror, and\nhe gasped out abject, placatory ejaculations and suddenly collapsed\ninto a sobbing mass on the floor.\n\nSmithers emerged from the Tube with a look of unpleasant satisfaction\non his face.\n\n\"I chased off the Ragged Men with sneeze gas,\" he observed with a vast\ncalmness. \"They ain't comin' back for a while. An' I always wanted to\nbreak this guy's neck. I think I'll do it now.\"\n\n\"Not till I've questioned him,\" said Tommy savagely. \"He and Jacaro\nhave started hell to popping, with that Tube design they stole from\nme. He's got to stay alive and tell us how to stop it. Von Holtz,\ntalk! And talk quick, or back you go through the Tube for the Ragged\nMen to work on!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Tree-Fern Jungle_\n\n\nTommy watched Smithers drive away. The sun was sinking low toward the\nwest, and the car stirred up a cloud of light-encarmined dust as it\nsped down the long, narrow lane to the main road. The laboratory had\nintentionally been built in an isolated spot, but at the moment Tommy\nwould have given a good deal for a few men nearby. Smithers was taking\nVon Holtz to Albany to add his information to Denham's pleas. Denham\nhad ordered it, when they reached him by phone after hours of effort.\nSmithers had to go, to guard against Von Holtz's escape, even sick and\nill as he was. And Evelyn had refused to go with him.\n\n\"If I stay in the laboratory,\" she insisted fiercely, \"you can slip\ndown and I can blow up the Tube after you, if the Ragged Men don't\nstay away. But by yourself....\"\n\nTommy did not consent, but he was helpless. There was danger from the\nTube. Not only from ghastly animals which might come through, but from\nmen. Smithers had fought the Ragged Men above it. He had chased them\noff, but they would come back. Perhaps they would come very soon,\nperhaps not until Denham and Smithers had returned. If they could be\nheld off, the as yet unknown dangers from the other Tube--of which\nonly the lizards and the Death Mist were certainties--might be\ncounteracted. In any case, the Tube must not be destroyed until its\ndefense was hopeless.\n\nTommy made up a grim bundle to go through the Tube with him: the\nsub-machine gun, extra drums of shells, more gas bombs and half a\ndozen grenades. He hung the various objects about himself. Evelyn\nwatched him miserably.\n\n\"You--you'll be careful, Tommy?\"\n\n\"Nothing else but,\" said Tommy. He grinned reassuringly. \"There's\nnothing to it, really. Just sitting still, listening. If I pop off\nsome fireworks I'll just have to sit down and watch them run.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe settled his gas mask about his neck and started to enter the Tube.\nEvelyn touched his arm.\n\n\"I'm--frightened, Tommy.\"\n\n\"Shucks!\" said Tommy. \"Also a couple of tut-tuts.\" He stood up, put\nhis arms about her, and kissed her until she smiled. \"Feel better\nnow?\" he asked interestedly.\n\n\"Y-yes....\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Tommy, and grinned again. \"When you feel scared again,\nring me on the phone and I'll give you another treatment.\"\n\nBut her smile faded as, beaming at her, he crawled into the first\nsection of the Tube. And his own expression grew serious enough when\nshe could see him no longer. The situation was not comfortable. Evelyn\nintended to marry him and he had to keep her cheerful, but he wished\nshe were well away from here.\n\nHe tried to move cautiously through the Tube, but his bundles bumped\nand rattled. It seemed hours before he was climbing up the last\nsection into the tree-fern jungle. He was caution itself as he peered\nover the edge. It was already night upon Earth, but here the\nmonstrous, dull-red sun was barely sinking. It moved slowly along the\nhorizon as it dipped, but presently a gray cast come over the\ncolorings in the forest. Flying things came clattering homeward\nthrough the masses of fern-fronds overhead. He saw a projectile-like\nthing with a lizard's head and jaws go darting through an incredibly\nsmall opening. It seemed to have no wings at all. But then, in one\ninstant, a vast wing-surface flashed out, made a single gigantic\nflap--and the thing was a projectile again, darting through a\n_cheraux-de-frise_ of interlaced fronds without a sign of wings to\nsupport it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy inspected his surroundings with an infinite care. As the\ndarkness deepened he meditatively taped a flashlight below the barrel\nof the sub-machine gun. Turned on, it would cast a pitiless light upon\nhis target, and the sights would be silhouetted against the thing to\nbe killed. He hung his grenades in a handy row just inside the mouth\nof the Tube and set his gas bombs conveniently in place, then settled\ndown to watch.\n\nIt was assuredly necessary. Von Holtz's story confirmed his own and\nDenham's guesses and made their worst fears seem optimistic. Von Holtz\nhad made a Tube for Jacaro, working from the model of Tommy's own\nconstruction. It had been completed nearly a month before. But no\njungle odors had seeped through that other Tube on its completion. It\nopened in a sub-cellar of a structure in the Golden City itself, the\ncity of towers and soaring spires Denham had glimpsed long months\nbefore. By sheer fortune it opened upon a rarely used storeroom where\nimprobable small animals--the equivalent of rats--played obscenely in\nthe light of ever-glowing panels in the wall.\n\nFor two days of the Fifth-Dimension world Jacaro and his gunmen lay\nquiet. During two nights they made infinitely cautious reconnaissance.\nThe second night it was necessary to kill two men who sighted the tiny\nexploring party. But the killing was done with silenced automatics,\nand there was no alarm. The third night they lay still, fearing an\nambush. The fourth night Jacaro struck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe and his men fled back to their Tube with plunder and precious gems.\nTheir loot was vast even beyond their hopes, though they had killed\nother men in gathering it. The Golden City was rich beyond belief. The\nvery crust of the Fifth-Dimension world seemed to be composed of other\nsubstances than those of Earth. The common metals of Earth were rare\nor even unknown. The rarer metals of Earth were the commonplace ones\nin the Golden City. Even the roofs seemed plated with gold, but\nJacaro's gunmen saw not one particle of iron save in a ring they took\nfrom a dead man's finger. There, an acid-etched plate of steel was set\nas if to be used for a signet.\n\nVon Holtz had accompanied the raiders perforce on every journey.\nJeweled bearings for motors; objects of commonest use, made of gold\nbeat thin for lightness; huge ingots of silver for industry; once a\nqueer-shaped spool of platinum wire that it took two men to\ncarry--these things made up the loot they scurried back to their\nrathole with. Five raids they made, and twenty men they shot down\nbefore they came upon disaster. On the sixth raid an outcry rose and\nan ambush fell upon them.\n\nFlashes of incredibly vivid actinic flame leaped from queer engines\nthat opened upon them. Curious small truncheonlike weapons spat\nparalyzing electric shocks upon them. The twelve gangsters fought with\nthe desperation of cornered rats, with notched and explosive bullets\nand with streams of lead from tommy-guns.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA chance bullet blew something up. One of the flame weapons flew to\nbits, spouting what seemed to be liquid thermit upon friend and foe\nalike. The way of the gangsters back to their Tube was barred. The\nroute they knew was a chaos of scorched bodies and melting metal. The\nthermit flowed in all directions, seeming to grow in volume as it\nflamed. Jacaro and his gangsters fled. They broke through the shaken\nremnants of the ambush. The six of them who survived the fighting\nfound a man somnolently driving a ground vehicle with two wheels. They\nburst upon him and, with their scared faces constituting threats in\nthemselves, forced him to drive them out of the Golden City. They fled\nalong aluminum roads into the tree-fern forests, while the sky behind\nthem seemed to flame as the city woke to the tumult in its ways.\n\nThey killed the driver of their vehicle when he refused to take them\nfarther, and it was that murder which saved their lives. It was seen\nby Ragged Men, the outlaws of the jungle, and it proved their enmity\nto the Golden City. The Ragged Men greeted them joyously and fed them,\nand enlisted their aid in a savage attack on a land-convoy on the way\nto the city. Their weapons carried the convoy, and they watched\nwounded prisoners killed with excruciating tortures....\n\nThey were with the Ragged Men now, Von Holtz believed. He had fled a\nweek or more before, when Jacaro--already learning the language of his\nhalf-mad allies--began to plan a grandiose attack upon the Golden\nCity. Von Holtz was born a coward, and he knew where Tommy Reames and\nDenham would shortly thrust a Tube through. It would come out just\nwhere the catapult had flung Evelyn and Denham, months before, the\nsame spot where he had marooned them. He searched desperately for that\nTube, and failed to find it. He was chased by carnivores, scratched by\nthorns, and at last pursued by a yelling horde of human devils who\nwere fired into by Smithers from the mouth of the just-finished Tube.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy debated the story grimly as he stood guard in the Tube in the\nhumid jungle night. Many-colored stars winked fitfully through the\nthatch of giant ferns overhead. The wind soughed unsteadily above the\njungle. There were queer creakings, and once or twice there were\ndistant cries, and when the wind died down there was a deep-toned\ncroaking audible somewhere which sounded rather like the croaking of\nunthinkably, monstrous frogs. But it could not be that, of course. And\nonce there was the sound of dainty movement and something passed\nnearby. Tommy Reames saw the shadowy outline of a bulk so vast that it\nturned him cold to think about it, and it did not seem fair for any\ncreature as huge as that to move so quietly.\n\nThen there was a little scuffling noise beneath him. A hand touched\nhis foot.\n\n\"It's--it's me, Tommy.\" Evelyn crowded up beside him and whispered\nshakenly: \"It--it was so lonesome down there, so quiet.\"\n\nTommy frowned unhappily in the darkness. If he sent her back, she\nwould know it was because he knew danger lurked here. Then she would\nworry. If he did not send her back....\n\n\"I'll go back the minute you tell me,\" she insisted forlornly.\n\"Honestly. But--I was lonesome.\"\n\nTommy slipped his arm about her.\n\n\"Woman,\" he said sternly. \"I'm going to let you stay ten minutes, so\nyou can brag to our grandchildren that you were the first Earth-girl\never to be kissed in the Fifth Dimension. But I want you down in the\nlaboratory so you won't be in my way if I start running!\"\n\nHis tone was the right one. She even laughed a little, softly, as he\npressed her to him. Then she clung to his hand and tried eagerly to\npierce the darkness all about them.\n\n\"You'll be able to see something presently,\" he assured her in a low\ntone. \"Just keep quiet, now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe gazed up at the stars, then around in the so-nearly complete\nobscurity. Tommy answered her comments abstractedly, after a little.\nHe was not quite sure that certain irregular sounds, yet far distant,\nwere not actually quite regular ones. The Ragged Men Smithers had shot\ninto had run away. But they would come back and they might come with\nJacaro and his gunmen as allies. If those distant sounds were men....\n\nShe withdrew her hand from his. Her back was toward him then, as she\ntried to pierce the darkness with her eyes. Tommy listened uneasily to\nthe distant sound. Suddenly he felt Evelyn bump against his shoulder.\nHe turned sharply--and she was out of the Tube! She was walking\nsteadily off into the darkness!\n\n\"Evelyn! Evelyn!\"\n\nShe did not falter or turn. He switched on the flashlight beneath his\ngun barrel and leaped out of the Tube himself. The light swept about.\nEvelyn's lithe figure kept moving away from him. Then his heart stood\nstill. There were eyes beyond her in the darkness, huge, monstrous,\nsteady eyes, half a yard apart in a head like something out of hell.\nAnd he could not fire because Evelyn was between the Thing and\nhimself. Its eyes glowed unholily--fascinating, hypnotic, insane....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvelyn swayed ... and the Thing moved! Tommy leaped like a madman\nshouting. As his feet struck the ground a mass of sold-seeming fungus\ngave way beneath him. He fell sprawling, but clutching the gun fast.\nThe spreading beam of the flashlight showed him Evelyn turning, her\nface filled with a wakening horror--the horror of one released from\nthe fascination of a snake. She screamed his name.\n\nThen a huge lizard paw swept forward and seized her body. A second\ngripped her as she screamed again. And Tommy Reames was deathly,\nterribly cool. The whole thing had happened in seconds only. He was\nsubmerged in slimy, sticky ooze which was the crushed fungus that had\ntripped him. But he cleared the gun. The flashlight limned a ghastly,\nobscenely fat body and a long tapering tail. Tommy aimed at the base\nof that tail and pulled the trigger, praying frenziedly.\n\nA stream of flame leaped from the gun-muzzle. Explosive bullets\nuttered their queer cracking noise. The thing screamed horribly. Its\ncry was hoarsely shrill. The flashlight showed it swinging ponderously\nabout, with Evelyn held fast against its body in a fashion horribly\nreminiscent of a child holding a doll.\n\nTommy was scrambling upright. Jaws clamped, cold horror filling him,\nhe aimed again, at the sharp-toothed head above Evelyn's body. He\ncould not try a heart shot with her in the way. Again the gun spat out\na burst of explosive lead. And Tommy should have been sickened by the\neffect of detonating missiles. The thing's lower jaw was shattered,\nhalf severed, made useless. It should have been killed a dozen times\nover.\n\nBut it screamed again until the jungle rang with the uproar, and then\nit fled, still screaming and still holding Evelyn clutched fast\nagainst its scaly breast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Fifth-Dimension World_\n\n\nTommy flung himself in pursuit, despairing. Evelyn cried out once more\nas the lumbering thing fled with her, giving utterance to shrieking\noutcries at which the tree-fern jungle shook. It leaped once, upon\nmonstrous hind legs, but came crashing heavily to the ground. Tommy's\nexplosive bullets had shattered the bones which supported the\nbalancing tail. Now that huge fleshy member dragged uselessly. The\nthing could not progress in its normal fashion of leaps covering many\nyards. It began to waddle clumsily, shrieking, with Evelyn clasped\nclose. Its jaw was a shattered horror. It went marching insanely\nthrough the blackness of the jungle, and with it went the unholy din\nof its anguish, and behind it Tommy Reames came flinging himself\nfrenziedly in pursuit.\n\nNormally, the thing should have distanced him in seconds. Even\ncrippled as it was, it moved swiftly. The scaly, duck-shaped head\nreared a good twenty feet above the fallen tree-fern fronds which\ncarpeted the jungle. The monstrous splayed feet stretched a good yard\nand a half from front to rear upon the ground. Even its waddling\nfootprints were yards apart, and it moved in terror.\n\nTommy tripped, fell, and got to his feet again, and the shrieking\ntumult was farther away. He raced madly toward the sound, the\nflashlight beam cutting swordlike through the blackness. He caught\nsight of the warty, scaly bulk of the monster at the extreme limit of\nthe rays. It was moving faster than he could travel. He sobbed\nhelpless curses at the thing and put forth superhuman exertions. He\nleaped fallen tree-fern trunks, he splashed through shallow\nponds--later, when he knew something of the inhabitants of such pools,\nTommy would turn cold at that memory--and raced on, gasping for breath\nwhile the shrieking of the thing that bore Evelyn grew more and more\ndistant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn five minutes he was almost strangling and the thing was half a mile\nahead of him. In ten, he was exhausted, and the shrieking noise it\nmade as it waddled away was distinctly fainter. In fifteen minutes he\nonly heard its hooting scream between the harsh laboring rasps of his\nown breath as he drew it into tortured lungs. But he ran on. He leaped\nand climbed and ran in a terrible obliviousness to all dangers the\njungle might hold.\n\nHe leaped down from one toppled tree-trunk upon what seemed be\nanother. But the thing he landed upon gave beneath his boots in the\nunmistakable fashion of yielding flesh. Something vast and angry\nstirred and hissed furiously. Something--a head, perhaps--whipped\ntoward him among the fallen fern-fronds. But he was racing on,\nsobbing, cursing, praying all at once.\n\nThen suddenly he broke out into a profuse sweat. His breathing became\neasier, and then he was running lightly. His second wind had come to\nhim. He was no longer exhausted. He felt as if he could run forever,\nand ran on more swiftly still. Suddenly the flashlight beam showed him\na deep furrow in the rotting vegetation underfoot, and something\nglistened. A musky reek filled his nostrils. The thing's trail--the\nfurrow left by its dragging tail! That musky reek was the thing's\nblood. It was bleeding from the wounds the explosive bullets had made.\nIt was spouting whatever filthy fluid ran in its veins even as it\nwaddled onward, screaming.\n\nFive minutes more, and he felt that he was gaining on it. Then, and he\nwas sure of it. But it was half an hour before he actually overtook\nthe injured monster marching like a mad machine. Its mutilated\nducklike head held high, its colossal feet lifting one after the other\nin a heavy, slowing waddle, and its hoarse screams re-echoing in a\nsenseless uproar of agony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy's hands were shaking, but his brain was cool with a vast\ncoolness. He raced past the shrieking monster, and halted in its path.\nHe saw Evelyn, a huddled bundle, clasped still to the creature's scaly\nbreast. And Tommy sent a burst of explosive bullets into a gigantic,\nfoot thick ankle-joint.\n\nThe monster toppled, and flung out its prehensile lizard claws in an\ninstinctive effort to catch itself. Evelyn was thrown clear. And\nTommy, standing alone in the blackness of a carboniferous jungle upon\nan alien planet, sent bullet after bullet into the shaking, obscenely\nflabby body of the thing. The bullets penetrated, and exploded. Great\nmasses of flesh upheaved and fell away. Great gouts of awful smelling\nfluid were flung out and blown to mist by the explosions. The thing\ndid not so much die as disintegrate under the storm of detonating\nmissiles.\n\nThen Tommy went to Evelyn. He was wild with grief. He had no faintest\nhope that she could still be living. But as he picked her up she\nmoaned softly, and when he cried her name she clung to him, pressing\nclose in an agony of thankfulness almost as devastating as her fear\nhad been.\n\nIt was minutes before either of them could think of anything other\nthan her safety and the fact that they were together again. But then\nTommy said, in a shaken effort to be himself again:\n\n\"I--I'd have done better if--if I'd had roller skates, maybe.\" His\ngrin was wholly unconvincing. \"Why'd you get out of the Tube?\"\n\n\"Its eyes!\" Evelyn shuddered, her own eyes hidden against Tommy's\nshoulder. \"I saw them suddenly, looking at me. And I--hadn't any will.\nI felt myself getting out of the Tube and walking toward it. It was\nlike the way a snake fascinates--hypnotizes--a bird....\"\n\nA vagrant wind-eddy submerged them in the foul reek of the dead\nthing's flesh. Tommy stirred.\n\n\"Ugh! Let's get out of this. There'll be things coming to feed on that\ncarcass. They'll smell it.\"\n\nEvelyn tried to stand, and succeeded. She clung to his hand.\n\n\"Do you think you can find the Tube again?\"\n\nTommy was already thinking of that. He grimaced.\n\n\"Probably. Back-trail the damned thing. If the flashlight battery\nholds out. Its tail left plenty of sign for us to follow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey started. And Evelyn had literally been forgotten in its agony by\nthe monster which had carried her. Its body, though scaled and warty,\nwas flabby and soft. Pressed against its breast she had been half\nstrangled, but had no injuries beyond huge, purple bruises which had\nnot yet reached the point of stiffness. She followed Tommy gamely, and\nthe need for action kept her from yielding to the reaction from her\nterror.\n\nFor a long, long time they back-trailed. Less than fifteen minutes\nafter leaving the carcass of the thing Tommy had killed, they heard\nbeast-roarings and the sound of fighting. But that noise died away as\nthey traveled. Presently they reached the spot where Tommy had leaped\nupon a huge living thing. It was gone now, but the impress of a body\nthe thickness of a barrel remained upon the rotted vegetation of the\njungle floor. Evelyn shivered when Tommy pointed it out.\n\n\"It was large,\" said Tommy ruefully. \"I didn't even get a good look it the\nthing. Probably just as well, though. I might have been--er--delayed.\nGood Lord! What's that?\"\n\nA light had sprung into being somewhere. It was bright. It was\nblinding in its brilliance. Coming through the tangled jungle growth,\nit seemed as if spears of flame shot through the air, irradiating\nstray patches of scabrous tree-trunk with unbearable light. For an\ninstant the illumination held. Then there was a distant, cracking\ndetonation. The unmistakable explosion of gun-cotton split the air,\nand its echoes rolled and reverberated through the jungle. The light\nwent out. Then came a thin, high yelling sound which, faint as it was,\nhad something of the quality of hysterical glee. That crazy ululation\nkept up for several minutes. Evelyn shivered.\n\n\"The Ragged Men,\" said Tommy very quietly. \"They sneaked up on the\nTube. They flung blazing thermit, or something like it, with a weapon\ncaptured from the Golden City. That explosion was the grenades going\noff. I'm afraid the Tube's blown up, Evelyn.\"\n\nShe caught her breath, looking mutely up at him.\n\n\"Here's a pistol,\" he said briefly, \"and shells. There's no use our\ngoing to the Tube to-night. It would be dangerous. We'll do our\ninvestigating at dawn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found a crevice where tree-fern trunks grew close together and\nclosed in three sides of a sort of roofless cave. He seated himself\ngrimly at the opening to wait for daybreak. He was not easy in his\nmind. There had been two Tubes to the Fifth-Dimension world. One had\nbeen made by Jacaro for his gunmen. That was now held by the men of\nthe Golden City, as was proved by carnivorous lizards and the Death\nMist that had come down it. The other was now blown up or, worse, in\nthe hands of the Ragged Men. In any case Tommy and Evelyn were\nisolated upon a strange planet in a strange universe. To fall into the\nhands of the Ragged Men was to die horribly, and the Golden City would\nnot now welcome inhabitants of the world Jacaro and his men had come\nfrom. To the civilized men of this world, Jacaro's raids would seem\ninvasion. They would seem acts of war on the part of the people of\nEarth. And the people of Earth, all of them, would seem enemies.\nJacaro would never be identified as an unauthorized invader. He would\nseem to be a scout, an advance guard, a spy, for hordes of other\ninvaders yet to come.\n\nAs the long night wore away, Tommy's grim hopelessness intensified.\nThe Ragged Men would hunt them for sport and out of hatred for all\nsane human beings. The men of the Golden City would be merciless to\ncompatriots of Jacaro's gunmen. And Tommy had Evelyn to look out for.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen dawn came, his face was drawn and lined. Evelyn woke with a\nlittle gasp, staring affrightedly about her. Then she tried gamely to\nsmile.\n\n\"Morning, Tommy,\" she said shakily. She added in a brave attempt at\nlevity: \"Where do we go from here?\"\n\n\"We look at the Tube,\" said Tommy heavily. \"There's a bare chance....\"\n\nHe led the way as on the night before, with his gun held ready. They\ntraveled for half an hour through the awakening jungle. Then for long,\nlong minutes Tommy searched for a sign of living men before he\nventured forth to look at the wreckage of the Tube. He found no live\nmen, and only two dead ones. But a glimpse of their bestial,\nvice-ridden faces was enough to remove any regret for their deaths.\n\nThe Tube was shattered. Its mouth was belled out and broken by the\nexplosion of the grenades hung within it. A part of the metal was\nmolten--from the thermit, past question. There was a veritable crater\nfifteen feet across where the Tube had come through, and there were only\nshattered shreds of metal where the first bend had been. Tommy regarded\nthe wreckage grimly. A pair of oxidized copper wires, their insulation\nburnt off, stung his eyes as he traced them to where they vanished in\ntorn-up earth. He took them in his bare hands. The tingling sting of a\nlow-voltage current made his heart leap. Then he smiled grimly. He\ntouched them to each other. Dot-dot-dot--dash-dash-dash--dot-dot-dot.\nS O S! If there was anybody in the laboratory, that would tell them.\n\nHis hands stung sharply. Someone was there, ringing the phone! Evelyn\ncame toward him, her face resolutely cheerful.\n\n\"No hope, Tommy?\" she asked. \"I just saw the telephone, all battered\nup. I guess we're pretty badly off.\"\n\n\"Get it!\" said Tommy feverishly. \"For Heaven's sake, get it! The phone\nwires weren't broken. If we can make it work....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe instrument was a wreck. It was crumpled and torn and apparently\nuseless. The diaphragm of the receiver was punctured. The transmitter\nseemed to have been crushed. But Tommy worked desperately over them,\nand twisted the earth-wires into place.\n\n\"Hello, hello, hello!\"\n\nThe voice that answered was Smithers', strained and fearful:\n\n\"Mr. Reames! Thank Gawd! What's happened? Is Miss Evelyn all right?\"\n\n\"So far,\" said Tommy. \"Listen!\" He told curtly just what had happened.\n\"Now, what's happened on Earth?\"\n\n\"Hell!\" panted Smithers bitterly. \"Hell's been poppin'! The Death\nMist's two miles across an' still growin an' movin'. Four townships\nunder martial law an' movin' out the people. It got thirty of 'em this\nmorning. An' they think the professor's crazy an' nobody'll listen to\nhim!\"\n\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy. He considered, grimly. \"Look here, Von Holtz ought\nto convince them.\"\n\n\"He caved in, outa his head, before I got to Albany. He's in hospital\nnow, ravin'. He's got some kinda fever the doctors don't know nothin'\nabout. Sick as hell!\"\n\nTommy compressed his lips. Matters were more desperate even than he\nhad believed. He informed his helper measuredly:\n\n\"Evelyn and I can't stay around here, Smithers. The Ragged Men may\ncome back, and it'll be weeks before you and the professor can get\nanother Tube through. I'm going to make for the Golden City and work\non them there to cut off the Death Mist.\"\n\nThere was an inarticulate sound from Smithers.\n\n\"Tell the professor. If he can find Jacaro's Tube, he'll work out some\nway to communicate through it. We've got to stop that Death Mist\nsomehow. And we don't know what else they may try.\"\n\nSmithers tried to speak, and could not. He merely made grief-stricken\nnoises. He worshiped Evelyn and she was isolated in a hostile world\nwhich was vastly more unreachable than could be measured by millions\nor trillions of miles. But at last he said unsteadily:\n\n\"We'll be comin', Mr. Reames. We'll come, if we have t' blow half the\nworld apart!\"\n\nTommy said grimly: \"Then hunt up the Golden City and bring extra\nammunition. Mostly explosive bullets. Good-by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe untwisted the wires from the shattered phone units and thrust them\nin his pocket. Evelyn was picking up stray small objects from the\nground.\n\n\"I've found some cartridges, Tommy,\" she said constrainedly, \"and a\npistol I think will work.\"\n\n\"Then listen for visitors,\" commanded Tommy, \"while I look for more.\"\n\nFor half in hour he scoured the area around the shattered Tube. He\nfound where some clumsy-wheeled thing had been pushed to a spot near\nthe Tube--undoubtedly the machine which had sprayed the flaming stuff\nupon it. He found two pockets full of shells. He found an extra\nmagazine, for the sub-machine gun. It was nearly full and only a\nlittle bent. That was all.\n\n\"Now,\" he said briskly, \"we'll start. I've got a hunch the jungle\nthins out over that way. We'll find a clearing, try to locate the\nGolden City either by seeing it or by watching for aircraft flying to\nit, and then make for it. They're making war on Earth there. They\ndon't understand. We've got to make them understand. O. K.?\"\n\nEvelyn nodded. She put out her hand suddenly, a brave slender figure\namid the incredible growths about her.\n\n\"I'm glad, Tommy,\" she said slowly, \"that if--if anything happens, it\nwill be the--the two of us. Funny, isn't it?\"\n\nTommy kissed the twisted little smile from her face.\n\n\"And now that that's over,\" he observed, ashamed of his own emotion,\n\"let's go!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went. Tommy watched the sun and kept approximately a straight\nline. They traveled three miles, and the jungle broke abruptly. Before\nthem was a spongy surface neither solid earth or marsh. It shelved\ngently down to a vast and steaming morass upon which the dull-red sun\nshone hotly. It was vast, that marsh, and a steaming haze hung over\nit, and it seemed to reach to the world's end. But vaguely, through\nthe attenuating upper layers of the steamy haze, they saw the outlines\nof a city beyond: tall towers and soaring spires, buildings of a grace\nand perfection of outline unknown upon the Earth. And faint golden\nflashes came from the walls and pinnacles of that city. They were\nreflections of this planet's monster sun, upon walls and roofs of\nplated gold.\n\n\"The Golden City,\" said Tommy heavily. He looked at the horrible marsh\nbetween. His heart sank.\n\nAnd then there was a sudden screaming ululation nearby. A half-naked\nman was running out of sight. Two others danced and capered and yelled\nin insane glee, pointing at Tommy and at Evelyn. The running man's\noutcry was echoed from far away. Then it was taken up and repeated\nhere and there in the jungle.\n\n\"They saw our tracks near the Tube,\" snapped Tommy bitterly. \"Oh, what\na fool I am! Now they'll ring us in.\"\n\nHe seized Evelyn's hand and began to run. There was a little rise in\nthe ground a hundred yards away, with a clump of leafy ferns to shade\nit. They reached it as other half-naked, wholly mad human forms burst\nout of the jungle to yell and caper and make derisive and horrible\ngestures at the fugitives.\n\n\"Here we fight,\" said Tommy grimly. \"The ground's open, anyhow. We\nfight here, and very probably we die here. But first....\"\n\nHe knelt down and drew the finest of fine beads upon a bearded man who\ncarried a glittering truncheonlike club which, by the way it was\ncarried, was more than merely a bludgeon. He pulled the trigger for a\nsingle shot.\n\nThe bullet struck the capering Ragged Man fairly in the chest. And it\nexploded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Fight in the Marsh_\n\n\nTwice, within the next two hours, the Ragged Men mustered the courage\nto charge. They came racing across the semi-solid ooze like the madmen\nthey were. Their yells and shouts were maniacal howls of blood-lust or\nworse. And twice Tommy broke their rush with a savage ruthlessness.\nThe sub-machine-gun's first magazine was nearly empty. It was an\nunhandy weapon for single-shot work but it was loaded with explosive\nshells. The second rush he stopped with an automatic pistol. There\nwere half-naked bodies partly buried in the ooze all the way from the\njungle's edge to within ten yards of the hillock on which he and\nEvelyn had taken refuge.\n\nIt was hot there, terribly hot. The air was stifling. It fairly reeked\nof moisture and the smells from the swamp behind them were sickening.\nTommy began to transfer the shells from the spare bent magazine to the\none he had carried with the gun.\n\n\"We've a couple of reasons to be thankful,\" he observed. \"One is that\nthere's a bit of shade overhead. The other is that we had the big\nmagazines for this gun. We still have nearly ninety shells, besides\nthe ones for the pistols.\"\n\nEvelyn said soberly:\n\n\"We're going to be killed, don't you think, Tommy?\"\n\nTommy frowned.\n\n\"I'm rather afraid we are,\" he said irritably. \"Confound it, and I'd\nthought of such excellent arguments to use in the City back yonder!\nSmithers said the Death Mist was two miles across, to-day, and still\ngrowing. The people in the city are still pouring the stuff down\nthrough Jacaro's Tube.\"\n\nEvelyn smiled faintly. She touched his hand.\n\n\"Trying to keep me from worrying? Tommy....\" She hesitated until he\ngrowled a question. \"Please--remember that when Daddy and I were in\nthe jungle before, we saw what these Ragged Men do to prisoners they\ntake. I just want you to promise that--well, you won't wait too long,\nin hopes of somehow saving me.\"\n\nTommy stared at her. Then he decisively reached forward and put his\nhand over her mouth.\n\n\"Keep quiet,\" he said gently. \"They shan't capture you. I promise\nthat. Now keep quiet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was only silence for a long time. Now and again a hidden figure\nscreamed in rage at them. Now and again some flapping thing sped\ntoward the jungle's edge. Once a naked arm thrust one of the golden\ntruncheons from behind its cover, pointing at a flying thing a few\nyards overhead. The flying thing suddenly toppled, turning over and\nover before it crashed to the ground. There were howls of glee.\n\n\"They seem mad,\" said Tommy meditatively, \"and they act like lunatics,\nbut I've got a hunch of some sort about them. But what?\"\n\nSunlight gleamed on something golden beyond the jungle's edge. Naked\nfigures went running to the spot. An exultant tumult arose.\n\n\"Now they try another trick,\" Tommy observed dispassionately. \"I\nremember that at the Tube they had pushed something on wheels....\"\n\nThe sub-machine gun was unhandy for accurate single shots, and no\npistol can be used to effect at long ranges. To conserve ammunition,\nTommy had been shooting only at relatively close targets, allowing the\nRagged Men immunity at over two hundred yards. But now he flung over\nthe continuous-fire stud. He watched grimly.\n\nThe foliage at the edge of the jungle parted. A crude wagon appeared.\nIts axles were lesser tree-trunks. Its wheels were clumsy and crude\nbeyond belief. But mounted upon it there was a queer mass of golden\nmetal which looked strangely beautiful and strangely deadly.\n\n\"That's the thing,\" said Tommy dispassionately, \"which made the flare\nof light last night. It blew up the Tube. And Von Holtz told\nme--hm--his friends, in the City....\"\n\nHe sighted carefully. The wagon and its contents were surrounded by a\nleaping, capering mob. They shook their fists in an insane hatred.\n\nA storm of bullets burst upon them. Tommy was traversing the little\ngun with the trigger pressed down. His lips were set tightly. And\nsuddenly it seemed as if the solid earth burst asunder! There had been\nan instant in which the bullet-bursts were visible. They tore and\nshattered the howling mob of Ragged Men. But then they struck the\ngolden weapon. A sheet of blue-white flame leaped skyward and round\nabout. A blast of blistering, horrible heat smote upon the beleaguered\npair. The moisture of the ooze between them and the jungle flashed\ninto steam. A section of the jungle itself, a hundred yards across,\nshriveled and died.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSteam shot upward in a monstrous cloud--miles high, it seemed. Then,\nalmost instantly, there was nothing left of the Ragged Men about the\ngolden weapon, or of the weapon itself, but an unbearable blue-white\nlight which poured away and trickled here and there and seemed to grow\nin volume as it flamed.\n\nFrom the rest of the jungle a howl arose. It was a howl of such loss,\nand of such unspeakable rage, that the hair at the back of Tommy's\nneck lifted, as a dog's hackles lift at sight of an enemy.\n\n\"Keep your head down, Evelyn,\" said Tommy composedly. \"I have an idea\nthat the burning stuff gives off a lot of ultra-violet. Von Holtz was\nbadly burned, you remember.\"\n\nNaked figures flashed forward from the jungle beyond the burned area.\nTommy shot them down grimly. He discarded the sub-machine gun with its\nexplosive shells for the automatics. Some of his targets were only\nwounded. Those wounded men dragged themselves forward, screaming their\nrage. Tommy felt sickened, as if he were shooting down madmen. A voice\nroared a rage-thickened order from the jungle. The assault slackened.\n\nFive minutes later it began again, and this time the attackers waded\nout into the softer ooze and flung themselves down, and then began a\nhalf-swimming, half-crawling progress behind bits of tree-fern stump,\nor merely pushing walls of the jellylike mud before them. The white\nlight expanded and grew huge--but it dulled as it expanded, and\npresently seemed no hotter than molten steel, and later still it was\nno more than a dull-red heat, and later yet....\n\nTommy shot savagely. Some of the Ragged Men died. More did not.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" he said coolly, \"they're going to get us. It seems\nrather purposeless, but I'm afraid they're going to win.\"\n\nEvelyn thrust a shaking hand skyward. \"There, Tommy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA strange, angular flying thing was moving steadily across the marsh,\nbarely above the steamlike haze that hung in thinning layers about its\nfoulness. The flying thing moved with a machinelike steadiness, and\nthe sun twinkled upon something bright and shining before it.\n\n\"A flying machine,\" said Tommy shortly. His mind leaped ahead and his\nlips parted in a mirthless smile. \"Get your gas mask ready, Evelyn.\nThe explosion of that thermit-thrower made them curious in the City.\nThey sent a ship to see.\"\n\nThe flying thing grew closer, grew distinct. A wail arose from the\nRagged Men. Some of them leaped to their feet and fled. A man came out\ninto the open and shook his fists at the angular thing in the air. He\nscreamed at it, and such ghastly hatred was in the sound that Evelyn\nshuddered.\n\nTommy could see it plainly, now. Its single wing was thick and queerly\nunlike the air-foils of Earth. A framework hung below it, but it had\nno balancing tail. And there was a glittering something before it that\nobviously was its propelling mechanism, but as obviously was not a\nscrew propeller. It swept overhead, with a man in it looking downward.\nTommy watched coolly. It was past him, sweeping toward the jungle. It\nswung sharply to the right, banking steeply. Smoking things dropped\nfrom it, which expanded into columns of swiftly-descending vapor. They\nreached the jungle and blotted it out. The flying machine swung again\nand swept back to the left. More smoking things dropped. Ragged Men\nerupted from the jungle's edge in screaming groups, only to writhe and\nfall and lie still. But a group of five of them sped toward Tommy,\nshrieking their rage upon him as the cause of disaster. Tommy held his\nfire, looking upward. A hundred yards, fifty yards, twenty-five....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flying machine soared in easy, effortless circles. The man in it\nwas watching, making no effort to interfere.\n\nTommy shot down the five men, one after the other, with a curiously\ndetached feeling that their vice-brutalized faces would haunt him\nforever. Then he stood up.\n\nThe flying machine banked, turned, and swept toward him, and a smoking\nthing dropped toward the earth. It was a gas bomb like those that had\nwiped out the Ragged Men. It would strike not ten yards away.\n\n\"Your mask!\" snapped Tommy.\n\nHe helped Evelyn adjust it. The billowing white cloud rolled around\nhim. He held his breath, clapped on his mask, exhaled until his lungs\nached, and was breathing comfortably. The mask was effective\nprotection. And then he held Evelyn comfortably close.\n\nFor what seemed a long, long while they were surrounded by the white\nmist. The cloud was so dense, indeed, that the light about them faded\nto a gray twilight. But gradually, bit by bit, the mist grew thinner.\nThen it moved aside. It drifted before the wind toward the tree-fern\nforest and was lost to sight.\n\nThe flying machine was circling and soaring silently overhead. As the\nmist drew aside, the pilot dived down and down. And Tommy emptied his\nautomatic at the glittering thing which drew it. There was a crashing\nbolt of blue light. The machine canted, spun about with one wing\nalmost vertical, that wing-tip struck the marsh, and it settled with a\nmonstrous splashing of mud. All was still.\n\nTommy reloaded, watching it keenly.\n\n\"The framework isn't smashed up, anyhow,\" he observed grimly. \"The\npilot thinks we're some of Jacaro's gang. My guns were proof, to him.\nSo, since the Ragged Men didn't get us, he gassed us.\" He watched\nagain, his eyes narrow. The pilot was utterly still. \"He may be\nknocked out. I hope so! I'm going to see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAutomatic held ready, Tommy moved toward the crashed machine. It had\nsplashed into the ooze less than a hundred yards away. Tommy moved\ncautiously. Twenty yards away, the pilot moved feebly. He had knocked\nhis head against some part of his machine. A moment later he opened\nhis eyes and stared about. The next instant he had seen Tommy and\nmoved convulsively. A glittering thing appeared in his hand--and Tommy\nfired. The glittering thing flew to one side and the pilot clapped his\nhand to a punctured forearm. He went white, but his jaw set. He stared\nat Tommy, waiting for death.\n\n\"For the love of Pete,\" said Tommy irritably, \"I'm not going to kill\nyou! You tried to kill me, and it was very annoying, but I have some\nthings I want to tell you.\"\n\nHe stopped and felt foolish because his words were, of course,\nunintelligible. The pilot was staring amazedly at him. Tommy's tone\nhad been irritated, certainly, but there was neither hatred nor\ntriumph in it. He waved his hand.\n\n\"Come on and I'll bandage you up and see if we can make you understand\na few things.\"\n\nEvelyn came running through the muck.\n\n\"He didn't hurt you, Tommy?\" she gasped. \"I saw you shoot--\"\n\nThe pilot fairly jumped. At first glance he had recognized her as a\nwoman. Tommy growled that he'd had to \"shoot the damn fool through the\narm.\" The pilot spoke, curiously. Evelyn looked at his arm and\nexclaimed. He was holding it above the wound to stop the bleeding.\nEvelyn looked about helplessly for something with which to bandage it.\n\n\"Make pads with your handkerchief,\" grunted Tommy. \"Take my tie to\nhold them in place.\"\n\nThe prisoner looked curiously from one to the other. His color was\nreturning. As Evelyn worked on his arm he seemed to grow excited at\nsome inner thought. He spoke again, and looked at once puzzled and\nconfirmed in some conviction when they were unable to comprehend. When\nEvelyn finished her first-aid task he smiled suddenly, flashing white\nteeth at them. He even made a little speech which was humorously\napologetic, to judge by its tone. When they turned to go back to their\nfortress he went with them without a trace of hesitation.\n\n\"Now what?\" asked Evelyn.\n\n\"They'll be looking for him in a little while,\" said Tommy curtly. \"If\nwe can convince him we're not enemies, he'll keep them from giving us\nmore gas.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot was fumbling at a belt about the curious tunic he wore.\nTommy watched him warily. But a pad of what seemed to be black metal\ncame out, with a silvery-white stylus attached to it. The pilot sat\ndown the instant they stopped and began to draw in white lines on the\nblack surface. He drew a picture of a man and an angular flying\nmachine, and then a sketchy, impressionistic outline of a city's\ntowers. He drew a circle to enclose all three drawings and indicated\nhimself, the machine, and the distant city. Tommy nodded comprehension\nas the pilot looked up. Then came a picture of a half-naked man\nshaking his fists at the three encircled sketches. The half-naked man\nstood beneath a roughly indicated tree-fern.\n\n\"Clever,\" said Tommy, as a larger circle enclosed that with the city\nand the machine. \"He's identifying himself, and saying the Ragged Men\nare enemies of himself and his Golden City, too. That much is not hard\nto get.\"\n\nHe nodded vigorously as the pilot looked up again. And then he watched\nas a lively, tiny sketch grew on the black slab, showing half a dozen\nmen, garbed almost as Tommy was, using weapons which could only be\nsub-machine guns and automatic pistols. They were obviously Jacaro's\ngangsters. The pilot handed over the plate and watched absorbedly as\nTommy fumbled with the stylus. He drew, not well but well enough, an\noutline of the towers of New York. The difference in architecture was\nstriking. There followed tiny figures of himself and Evelyn--with a\ndrily murmured, \"This isn't a flattering portrait of you,\nEvelyn!\"--and a circle enclosing them with the towers of New York.\n\nThe pilot nodded in his turn. And then Tommy encircled the previously\ndrawn figures of the gangsters with New York, just as the Ragged Men\nhad been linked with the other city. And a second circle linked\ngangsters and Ragged Men together.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm saying,\" observed Tommy, \"that Jacaro and his mob are the Ragged\nMen of our world, which may not be wrong, at that.\"\n\nThere was no question but that the pilot took his meaning. He grinned\nin a friendly fashion, and winced as his wounded arm hurt him.\nRuefully, he looked down at his bandage. Then he pressed a tiny stud\nat the top of the black-metal pad and all the white lines vanished\ninstantly. He drew a new circle, with tree-ferns scattered about its\nupper third--a tiny sketch of a city's towers. He pointed to that and\nto the city visible through the mist--a second city, and a third, in\nother places. He waved his hand vaguely about, then impatiently\nscribbled over the middle third of the circle and handed it back to\nTommy.\n\nTommy grinned ruefully.\n\n\"A map,\" he said amusedly. \"He's pointed out his own city and a couple\nof others, and he wants us to tell him where we come from.\nEvelyn--er--how are we going to explain a trip through five dimensions\nin a sketch?\"\n\nEvelyn shook her head. But a shadow passed over their heads. The pilot\nleaped to his feet and shouted. There were three planes soaring above\nthem, and the pilot in the first was in the act of releasing a smoking\nobject over the side. At the grounded pilot's shout, he flung his ship\ninto a frantic dive, while behind him the smoking thing billowed out a\nthicker and thicker cloud. His plane was nearly hidden by the vapor\nwhen he released it. It fell two hundred yards and more away, and the\nwhite mist spread and spread. But it fell short of the little hillock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Quick thinking,\" said Tommy coolly. \"He thought we had this man a\nprisoner, and he'd be better off dead. But--\"\n\nTheir captive was shouting again. His head thrown back, he called\nsentence after sentence aloft while the three ships soared back and\nforth above their heads, soundless as bats. One of the three rose\nsteeply and soared away toward the city. Their captive, grinning,\nturned and nodded his head satisfiedly. Then he sat down to wait.\n\nTwenty minutes later a monstrous machine with ungainly flapping wings\ncame heavily over the swamp. It checked and settled with a terrific\nflapping and an even more terrific din. Half a dozen armed men waited\nwarily for the three to approach. The golden weapons lifted alertly as\nthey drew near. The wounded man explained at some length. His\nexplanation was dismissed brusquely. A man advanced and held out his\nhands for Tommy's weapons.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" growled Tommy, \"but we've got to think of Earth. If\nyou get a chance hide your gun, Evelyn.\"\n\nHe pushed on the safety catches and passed over his guns. The pilot he\nhad shot down led them onto the fenced-in deck of the monstrous\nornithopter. Machinery roared. The wings began to beat. They were\nnearly invisible from the speed of their flapping when the ship lifted\nvertically from the ground. It rose straight up for fifty feet, the\nmotion of the wings changed subtly, and it swept forward.\n\nIt swung in a vast half circle and headed back across the marsh for\nthe Golden City. Five minutes of noisy flight during which the machine\nflapped its way higher and higher above the marsh--which seemed more\nnoisome and horrible still from above--and then the golden towers of\nthe city were below. Strange and tapering and beautiful, they were. No\nsingle line was perfectly straight, nor was any form ungraceful. These\ntowers sprang upward in clean-soaring curves toward the sky. Bridges\nbetween them were gossamerlike things that seemed lace spun out in\nmetal. And as Tommy looked keenly and saw the jungle crowding close\nagainst the city's metal walls, the flapping of the ornithopter's\nwings changed again and it seemed to plunge downward like a stone\ntoward a narrow landing place amid the great city's towering\nbuildings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Golden City_\n\n\nThe thing that struck Tommy first of all was the scarcity of men in\nthe city, compared to its size. The next thing was the entire absence\nof women. The roar of machines smote upon his consciousness as a bad\nthird, though they made din enough. Perhaps he ignored the machine\nnoises because the ornithopter on which they had arrived made such a\nracket itself.\n\nThey landed on a paved space perhaps a hundred yards by two hundred,\nthree sides of which were walled off by soaring towers. The fourth\ngave off on empty space, and he realized that he was still at least a\nhundred feet above the ground. The ornithopter landed with a certain\nskilful precision and its wings ceased to beat. Behind it, the two\nfixed-wing machines soared down, leveled, hovered, and settled upon\namazingly inadequate wheels. Their pilots got out and began to push\nthem toward one side of the landing area. Tommy noticed it, of course.\nHe was noticing everything, just now. He said amazedly:\n\n\"Evelyn! They launch these planes with catapults like those our\nbattleships use! They don't take off under their own power!\"\n\nThe six men on the ornithopter put their shoulders to their machine\nand trundled it out of the way. Tommy blinked at the sight.\n\n\"No field attendants!\" He gazed out across the open portion of the\nland area and saw an elevated thoroughfare below. Some sort of\nvehicle, gleaming like gold, moved swiftly on two wheels. There was a\nwalkway in the center of the street with room for a multitude. But\nonly two men were in sight upon it. \"Lord!\" said Tommy. \"Where are the\npeople?\"\n\nThere was brief talk among the crew of the ornithopter. Two of them\npicked up Tommy's weapons, and the pilot he had wounded made a gesture\nindicating that he should follow. He led the way to an arched door in\nthe nearest tower. A little two-wheeled car was waiting. They got into\nit and the pilot fumbled with the controls. As he worked at it--rather\nclumsily on account of his arm--the rest of the ornithopter's crew\ncame in. They wheeled out another vehicle, climbed into it, and shot\naway down a sloping passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir own vehicle followed and emerged upon the paved and nearly empty\nthoroughfare. Tall buildings rose all about them, with curved walls\nsoaring dizzily skyward. There was every sign of a populous city,\nincluding the dull drumming roar of many machines, but the streets\nwere empty. The little machine moved swiftly for minutes. Twice it\nswung aside and entered a sloping incline. Once it went up. The other\ntime it dived down seventy feet on a four-hundred-foot ramp. Then it\nswung sharply to the right, meandered into a street-level way leading\ninto the heart of a monster building, and stopped. And in all its\ntravel it had not passed fifty people.\n\nThe pilot-turned-chauffeur turned and grinned amiably, and led the way\nagain. Steps--twenty or thirty of them. Then they emerged suddenly\ninto a vast room. It must have been a hundred and fifty feet long,\nfifty wide, and nearly as high. It was floored with alternate blocks\nof what seemed to be an iron-hard black wood and the omnipresent\ngolden metal. Columns and pilasters about the place gave forth the\nsame subdued deep golden glow. Light streamed from panels inset in the\nwall and ceiling--a curious saffron-red light. There was a massive\ntable of the hard black wood. Chairs with curiously designed backs\nwere ranged about it. They were benches, really, but they served the\npurpose of chairs. Each was too narrow to hold more than one person.\nThe room was empty.\n\nThey waited. After a long time a man in a blue tunic came into the\nroom and sat down on one of the benches. A long time later, another\nman came in, in red; and another and another, until there were a dozen\nin all. They regarded Tommy and Evelyn with a weary suspicion. One of\nthem--an old man with a white beard--asked questions. The pilot\nanswered them. At a word, the two men with Tommy's weapons placed them\non the table. They were inspected casually, as familiar things. They\nprobably were, since some of Jacaro's gunmen had been killed in a\nfight in this city. Another question.\n\nThe pilot explained briefly and offered Tommy the black-metal pad\nagain. It still contained the incomplete map of a hemisphere, and was\nobviously a repetition of the question of where he came from.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy took it, frowning thoughtfully. Then an idea struck him. He\nfound the little stud which, pressed by the pad's owner, had erased\nthe previous drawings. He pressed it and the lines disappeared. And\nTommy drew, crudely enough, that complicated diagram which is supposed\nto represent a cube which is a cube in four dimensions: a tesseract.\nUpon one surface of the cube he indicated the curving towers of the\nGolden City. Upon a surface representing a plane beyond the three\ndimensions of normal experience, he repeated the angular tower\nstructures of New York. He shrugged rather hopelessly as he passed it\nover, but to his amazement it was understood at once.\n\nThe little black pad passed from hand to hand and an animated\ndiscussion took place. One rather hard-faced man was the most animated\nof all. The bearded old man demurred. The hard-faced man insisted.\nTommy could see that his pilot's expression was becoming uneasy. But\nthen a compromise seemed to be arrived at. The bearded man spoke a\nsingle, ceremonial phrase and the twelve men rose. They moved toward\nvarious doors and one by one left, until the room was empty.\n\nBut the pilot looked relieved. He grinned cheerfully at Tommy and led\nthe way back to the two-wheeled vehicle. The two men with Tommy's\nweapons vanished. And again there was a swift, cyclonelike passage\nalong empty ways with the throbbing of machinery audible everywhere.\nInto the base of a second building, up endless stairs, past\ninnumerable doors. It seemed to Tommy that he heard voices behind some\nof them, and they were women's voices.\n\nAt a private, triple knock a door opened wide, and the pilot led the\nway into a room, closed and locked the door behind him, and called. A\nwoman's voice cried out in astonishment. Through an inner arch a woman\ncame running eagerly. Her face went blank at sight of Tommy and\nEvelyn, and her hand flew to a tiny golden object at her waist. Then,\nat the pilot's chuckle, she flushed vividly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours later, Tommy and Evelyn were able to talk it over. They were\nalone then, and could look out an oval window upon the Golden City all\nabout them. It was dark, but saffron-red panels glowed in building\nwalls all along the thoroughfares, and tiny glowing dots in the\nsoaring spires of gold told of people within other dwellings like\nthis.\n\n\"As I see it,\" said Tommy restlessly, \"the Council--and it must have\nbeen that in the big room to-day--put us in our friend's hands to\nlearn the language. He's been working with me four hours, drawing\npictures, and I've been writing down words I've learned. I must have\nseveral hundred of them. But we do our best talking with pictures. And\nEvelyn, this city's in a bad fix.\"\n\nEvelyn said irrelevantly: \"Her name is Ahnya, Tommy, and she's a dear.\nWe got along beautifully. I'll bet I found out things you don't even\nguess at.\"\n\n\"You probably have,\" admitted Tommy, frowning. \"Check up on this: our\nfriend's name is Aten, and he's an air-pilot and also has something to\ndo with growing foodstuffs in some special towers where they grow\ncrops by artificial light only. Some of the plants he sketched look\namazingly like wheat, by the way. The name of the town is\"--he looked\nat his notes--\"Yugna. There are some other towns, ten or twelve of\nthem. Rahn is the nearest, and it's worse off than this one.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Evelyn, smiling. \"They use _cuyal_ openly, there!\"\n\n\"How'd you learn all that?\" demanded Tommy.\n\n\"Ahnya told me. We made gestures and smiled at each other. We\nunderstood perfectly. She's crazy about her husband, and I--well she\nknows I'm going to marry you, so....\"\n\nTommy grunted.\n\n\"I suppose she explained with a smile and gestures just how much of a\nstrain it is, simply keeping the city going?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Evelyn calmly. \"The city's fighting against the\njungle, which grows worse all the time. They used to grow their\nfoodstuffs in the open fields. Then within the city. Now they use\nempty towers and artificial light. I don't know why.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy grunted again.\n\n\"This planet's just had, or is having, a change of geologic period,\"\nhe explained, frowning. \"The plants people need to live on aren't\nadapted to the new climate and new plants fit for food are scarce.\nThey have to grow food under shelter, now, and their machines take an\nabnormal amount of supervision--I don't know why. The air-conditions\nfor the food plants; the machines that fight back the jungle creepers\nwhich thrive in the new climate and try to crawl into the city to\nsmother it; the power machines; the clothing machines--a million\nmachines have to be kept going to keep back the jungle and fight off\nstarvation and just hold on doggedly to the bare fact of civilization.\nAnd they're short-handed. The law of diminishing returns seems to\noperate. They're trying to maintain a civilization higher than their\nenvironment will support. They work until they're ready to drop, just\nto stay in the same place. And the monotony and the strain makes some\nof them take to _cuyal_ for relief.\"\n\nHe surveyed the city from the oval window, frowning in thought.\n\n\"It's a drug which grows wild,\" he added slowly. \"It peps them up. It\nmakes the monotony and the weariness bearable. And then, suddenly,\nthey break. They hate the machines and the city and everything they\never knew or did. It's a sort of delayed-action psychosis which goes\noff with a bang. Some of them go amuck in the city, using their\nbelt-weapons until they're killed. More of them bolt for the jungle.\nThe city loses better than one per cent of its population a year to\nthe jungle. And then they're Ragged Men, half mad at all times and\nwholly mad as far as the city and its machines are concerned.\"\n\nEvelyn linked her arm in his.\n\n\"Somehow,\" she told him, smiling, \"I think one Thomas Reames is\nworking out ways and means to help a city named Yugna.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Tommy grimly. \"We have to think of Earth. Not\neverybody in the Council approved of us. Aten told me one chap argued\nthat we ought to be shoved out into the jungle again as compatriots of\nJacaro. And the machines were especially short-handed to-day because\nof a diversion of labor to get ready something monstrous and really\ndeadly to send down the Tube to Earth. We've got to find out what that\nis, and stop it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut on the second day afterward, when he and Evelyn were summoned\nbefore the Council again, he still had not found out. During those two\ndays he learned many other things, to be sure: that Aten for instance,\nwas relieved from duty at the machines only because he was wounded;\nthat the power of the main machines came from a deep bore which\nbrought up superheated steam from the source of boiling springs long\nsince built over; that iron was a rare metal, and consequently there\nwas no dynamo in the city and magnetism was practically an unknown\nforce; that electrokinetics was a laboratory puzzle--or had been, when\nthere was leisure for research--while the science of electrostatics\nhad progressed far past its state on Earth. The little truncheonlike\nweapons carried a stored-up static charge measurable only in hundreds\nof thousands of volts, which could be released in flashes which were\neffective up to a hundred feet or more.\n\nAnd he learned that the thermit-throwers actually spat out in normal\noperation tiny droplets of matter Aten could not describe clearly, but\nwhich seemed to be radioactive with a period of five minutes or less;\nthat in Rahn, the nearest other city, _cuyal_ was taken openly, and\nthe jungle was growing into the town with no one to hold it back; that\ntwo generations since there had been twenty cities like this one, but\nthat a bare dozen still survived; that there was a tradition that\nhuman beings had come upon this planet from another world where other\nhuman beings had harried them, and that in that other world there were\ndivers races of humanity, of different colors, whereas in the world of\nthe Golden City all mankind was one race; that Tommy's declaration\nthat he came from another group of dimensions had been debated and, on\nre-examination of Jacaro's Tube, accepted, and that there was keen\nargument going on as to the measures to be taken concerning it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThese things Tommy had learned, and he and Evelyn went to their second\ninterrogation by the city's Council armed with written vocabularies of\nnearly a thousand words, which they had sorted out and made ready for\nuse. But they were still ignorant of the weapons the Golden City might\nuse against Earth.\n\nThe Council meeting took place in the same hall, with its alternating\nblack-and-gold flooring and the saffron-red lighting panels casting a\nsoft light everywhere. This was a scheduled meeting, foreseen and\narranged for. The twelve chairs above the heavy table were all\noccupied from the first. But Tommy realized that the table had been\nintended to seat a large number of councilors. There were guards\nstationed formally behind the chairs. There were spectators, auditors\nof the deliberations of the Council. They were dressed in a myriad\ncolors, and they talked quietly among themselves; but it seemed to\nTommy that nowhere had he seen weariness, as an ingrained expression,\nupon so many faces.\n\nTommy and Evelyn were led to the foot of the Council table. The\nbearded old man in blue began the questioning. As Keeper of\nFoodstuffs--according to Aten--he was a sort of presiding officer.\n\nTommy answered the questions crisply. He had known what they would be,\nand he had developed a vocabulary to answer them. He told them of\nEarth, of Professor Denham, of his and the professor's experiments. He\noutlined the first experiment with the Fifth-Dimension catapult and\nthe result of it--when the Golden City had sent the Death Mist to wipe\nout a band of Ragged Men who had captured a citizen, and after him\nEvelyn and her father.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis they remembered. Nods went around the table. Tommy told them of\nJacaro, stressing the fact that Jacaro was an outlaw, a criminal upon\nEarth. He explained the theft of the model Tube, and how it was that\ntheir first contact with Earth had been with the dregs of Earth\nhumanity. On behalf of his countrymen he offered reparation for all\nthe damage Jacaro and his men had done. He proposed a peaceful\ncommerce between worlds, to the infinite benefit of both.\n\nThere was silence until he finished. The faces before him were\nimmobile. But a hawk-faced man in brown asked dry questions. Were\nthere more races than one upon Earth? Were they of diverse colors? Did\nthey ever war among themselves? At Tommy's answers the atmosphere\nseemed to change. And the hawk-faced man rose to speak.\n\nTommy and Evelyn, he conceded caustically, had certainly come from\nanother world. Their own most ancient legends described just such a\nworld as his: a world of many races of many colors, who fought many\nwars among themselves. Their ancestors had fled from such a world,\naccording to legend through a twisting cavern which they had sealed\nbehind them. The conditions Tommy described had been the cause of\ntheir ancestors' flight. They, the people of Yugna, would do well to\nfollow the example of their forebears: strip these Earth folk of their\nweapons, exile them to the jungles, destroy the Tube through which the\nMist of Many Colors had been sent. All should be as in past ages.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy opened his mouth to answer, but another man sprang to his feet.\nHis face alone was not weary and worn. As he stood up, Aten murmured\n\"_Cuyal!_\" and Tommy understood that this man used the drug which was\ndestroying the city's citizens, but gave a transient energy to its\nvictims. He spoke in fiery phrases, urging action which would be\ndrastic and certain. He spoke confidently, persuasively. There was a\nrustling among those who watched and listened to the debate. He had\ncaught at their imagination.\n\nEvelyn, exerting every faculty to understand, saw Tommy's lips set\ngrimly.\n\n\"What--what is it?\" she whispered. \"I--I don't understand....\"\n\nTommy spoke in a savage growl.\n\n\"He says,\" he told her bitterly, \"that in one blow they can defeat\nboth the jungle and the invaders from Earth. In past ages their\nancestors were faced by enemies they could not defeat. They fled to\nthis world. Now they are faced by jungles they cannot defeat. He\nproposes that they flee to our world. The Death Mist is a toy, he\nreminds them, compared with gases they know. There is a gas of which\none part in ten hundred million is fatal! In a hundred of their days\nthey can make and send through the Tube enough of it to kill every\nliving thing on Earth. They've figures on the Earth's size and\natmosphere from me, damn 'em! And he reminds them that that deadly gas\nchanges of itself into a harmless substance. He urges them to gas\nEarth humanity out of existence, call upon the other cities of this\nworld, and presently move through the Tube to Earth. They'll carry\ntheir food-plants, rebuild their cities, and abandon this planet to\nthe jungles and the Ragged Men. And the hell of it is, they can do\nit!\"\n\nA sudden approving buzz went through the Council hall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_The Fleet from Rahn_\n\n\nThe approval of the citizens of Yugna was not enthusiastic. It was\ndesperate. Their faces were weary. Their lives were warped. They had\nbeen fighting since birth against the encroachment of the jungle,\nwhich until the days of their grandparents had been no menace at all.\nBut for two generations these people had been foredoomed, and they\nknew it. Nearly half the cities of their race were overwhelmed and\ntheir inhabitants reduced to savage hunters in the victorious jungles.\nNow the people of Yugna saw a chance to escape from the jungle. They\nwere offered rest. Peace. Relaxation from the desperate need to serve\ninsatiable machines. Sheer desperation impelled them. In their\nsituation, the people of Earth would annihilate a solar system for\nrelief, let alone the inhabitants of a single planet.\n\nShouts began to be heard above the uproar in the Council\nhall--approving shouts, demands that one be appointed to conduct the\noperation which was to give them a new planet on which to live, where\ntheir food-plants would thrive in the open, where jungles would no\nlonger press on them.\n\nTommy's face went savage and desperate, itself. He clenched and\nunclenched his hands, struggling among his meagre supply of words for\npromises of help from Earth, which promises would tip the scales for\npeace again. He raised his voice in a shout for attention. He was\nunheard. The Council hall was in an uproar of desperate approval. The\norator stood flushed and triumphant. The Council members looked from\neye to eye, and slowly the old, white-bearded Keeper of Foodstuffs\nplaced a golden box upon the table. He touched it in a certain\nfashion, and handed it to the next man. That second man touched it,\nand passed it to a third. And that man....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hush fell instantly. Tommy understood. The measure was being decided\nby solemn vote. The voting device had reached the fifth man when there\nwas a frantic clatter of footsteps, a door burst in, and babbling men\nstood in the opening, white-faced and stammering and overwhelmed, but\ntrying to make a report.\n\nConsternation reigned, incredulous, amazed consternation. The bearded\nold man rose dazedly and strode from the hall with the rest of the\nCouncil following him. A pause of stunned stupefaction, and the\nspectators in the hall rushed for other doors.\n\n\"Stick to Aten,\" snapped Tommy. \"Something's broken, and it has to be\nour way. Let's see what it is.\"\n\nHe clung alike to Evelyn and to Aten as the air-pilot fought to clear\na way. The doors were jammed. It was minutes before they could make\ntheir way through and plunge up the interminable steps Aten mounted,\nonly to fling himself out to the open air. Then they were upon a\nflying bridge between two of the towers of the city. All about the\ncity human figures were massing, staring upward.\n\nAnd above the city swirled a swarm of aircraft. Tommy counted three of\nthe clumsy ornithopters, high and motelike. There were twenty or\nthirty of the small, one-man craft. There were a dozen or more two-man\nplanes. And there were at least forty giant single-wing ships which\nlooked as if they had been made for carrying freight. They soared and\ncircled above the city in soundless confusion. Before each of them\nglittered something silvery, like glass, which was not a screw\npropeller but somehow drew them on.\n\nThe Council was massed two hundred yards away. A single-seater dived\ndownward, soared and circled noiselessly fifty yards overhead, and its\npilot shouted a message. Then he climbed swiftly and rejoined his\nfellows. The men about Tommy looked stunned, as if they could not\nbelieve their ears. Aten seemed stricken beyond the passability of\nreaction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I got part of it,\" snapped Tommy, to Evelyn's whispered question. \"I\nthink I know the rest. Aten!\" He snapped question after question in\nhis inadequate phrasing of the city's tongue. Evelyn saw Aten answer\ndully, then bitterly, and then, as Tommy caught his arm and whispered\nsavagely to him, Aten's eyes caught fire. He nodded violently and\nturned on his heel.\n\n\"Come on!\" And Tommy seized Evelyn's arm again.\n\nThey followed closely as Aten wormed his way through the crowd. They\nraced behind him downstairs and through a door into a dusty and\nunvisited room. It was a museum. Aten pointed grimly.\n\nHere were the automatic pistols taken from those of Jacaro's men who\nhad been killed, a nasty sub-machine gun which had been Tommy's, and\ngrenades--Jacaro's. Tommy checked shell calibres and carried off a\nninety-shot magazine full of explosive bullets, and a repeating rifle.\n\n\"I can do more accurate work with this than the machine gun,\" he said\ncryptically. \"Let's go!\"\n\nIt was not until they were racing away from the Council building in\none of the two-wheeled vehicles that Evelyn spoke again.\n\n\"I--understand part,\" she said unsteadily. \"Those planes overhead are\nfrom Rahn. And they're threatening--\"\n\n\"Blackmail,\" said Tommy between clenched teeth. \"It sounds like a\nperfectly normal Earth racket. A fleet from Rahn is over Yugna, loaded\nwith the Death Mist. Yugna pays food and goods and women or it's wiped\nout by gas. Further, it surrenders its aircraft to make further\ncollections easier. Rahn refuses to die, though it's let in the\njungle. It's turned pirate stronghold. Fed and clothed by a few other\ncities like this one, it should be able to hold out. It's a racket,\nEvelyn. A stick-up. A hijacking of a civilised city. Sounds like\nJacaro.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little vehicle darted madly through empty highways, passing groups\nof men staring dazedly upward at the soaring motes overhead. It darted\ndown this inclined way, up that one. It shot into a building and\naround a winding ramp. It stopped with a jerk and Aten was climbing\nout. He ran through a doorway, Tommy and Evelyn following. Planes of\nall sizes, still and lifeless, filled a vast hall. And Aten struggled\nwith a door mechanism and a monster valve swung wide. Then Tommy threw\nhis weight with Aten's to roll out the plane he had selected. It was a\nsmall, triangular ship, with seats for three, but it was heavy. The\ntwo men moved it with desperate exertion. Aten pointed, panting, to\nslide-rail and it took them five minutes to get the plane about that\nrail and engage a curious contrivance in a slot in the ship's\nfuselage.\n\n\"Tommy,\" said Evelyn, \"you're not going to--\"\n\n\"Run away? Hardly!\" said Tommy. \"We're going up. I'm going to fight\nthe fleet with bullets. They don't have missile-weapons here, and Aten\nwill know the range of their electric-charge outfits.\"\n\n\"I'm coming too,\" said Evelyn desperately.\n\nTommy hesitated, then agreed.\n\n\"If we fail they'll gas the city anyway. One way or the other....\"\n\nThere was a sudden rumble as Evelyn took her place. The plane shot\nforward with a swift smooth acceleration. There was no sound of any\nmotor. There was no movement of the glittering thing at the forepart\nof the plane. But the ship reached the end of the slide and lifted,\nand then was in mid-air, fifty feet above the vehicular way, a hundred\nfeet above the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy spoke urgently. Aten nodded. The ship had started to climb. He\nleveled it out and darted straight forward. He swung madly to dodge a\nsoaring tower. He swept upward a little to avoid a flying bridge. The\nship was travelling with an enormous speed, and the golden walls of\nthe city flashed past below them and they sped away across feathery\njungle.\n\n\"If we climbed at once,\" observed Tommy shortly, \"they'd think we\nmeant to fight. They might start their gassing. As it is, we look like\nwe're running away.\"\n\nEvelyn said nothing. For five miles the plane fled as if in panic.\nEvelyn clung to the filigree side of the cockpit. The city dwindled\nbehind them. Then Aten climbed steeply. Tommy was looking keenly at\nthe glittering thing which propelled the ship. It seemed like a\ncrystal gridwork, like angular lace contrived of glass. But a cold\nblue flame burned in it and Tommy was obscurely reminded of a neon\ntube, though the color was wholly unlike. A blast of air poured back\nthrough the grid. Somehow, by some development of electro-statics, the\n\"static jet\" which is merely a toy in Earth laboratories had become\nusable as a means of propelling aircraft.\n\nBack they swept toward the Golden City, five thousand feet or more\naloft. The ground was partly obscured by the hazy, humid atmosphere,\nbut glinting sun-reflections from the city guided them. Soaring things\ntook shape before them and grew swiftly nearer. Tommy spoke again,\nbusily loading the automatic rifle with explosive shells.\n\nAten swung to follow a vast dark shape in its circular soaring, a\nhundred feet above it and a hundred yards behind. Wind whistled,\nrising to a shriek. Tommy fired painstakingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe other plane zoomed suddenly as a flash of blue flame spouted\nbefore it. It dived, then, fluttering and swooping, began to drift\nhelplessly toward the spires of the city below it.\n\n\"Good!\" snapped Tommy. \"Another one, Aten.\"\n\nAten made no reply. He flung his ship sidewise and dived steeply\nbefore a monstrous freight carrier. Tommy fired deliberately as they\nswept past. The propelling grid flashed blue flame in a vast, crashing\nflame. It, too, began to flutter down.\n\nTommy did not miss until the fifth time, and Aten turned with a\ngrimace of disappointment. Tommy's second shot burst in a freight\ncompartment and a man screamed. His voice carried horribly in the\nsilence of these heights. But Tommy shot again, and, again, and there\nwas a satisfying blue flash as a fifth big ship went fluttering\nhelplessly down.\n\nAten began to circle for height Tommy refilled the magazine.\n\n\"I'm bringing 'em down,\" he explained unnecessarily to Evelyn, \"by\nsmashing their propellers. They have to land, and when they land\nthey're hostages--I hope!\"\n\nConfusion became apparent among the hostile planes. The one Yugna ship\nwas identified as the source of disaster. Tommy worked his rifle in\ncold fury. He aimed at no man, but the propelling grids were large.\nFor a one-man ship they were five feet in diameter, and for the big\nfreight ships, they were circles fifteen feet across. They were\nperfect targets, and Aten seemed to grasp the necessary tactics almost\ninstantly. Dead ahead or from straight astern, Tommy could not miss a\nshot. The fleet of Rahn went fluttering downward. Fifteen of the\nbiggest were down, and six of the two-man planes. A sixteenth and\nseventeenth flashed at their bows and drifted helplessly....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the one-man ships attacked. Six of them at once. Aten grinned and\ndived for all of them. One by one, Tommy smashed their crystal grids\nand watched them sinking unsteadily toward the towers of the city. As\nhis own ship drove over them, little golden flashes licked out.\nElectric-charge weapons. One flash struck the wingtip of their plane,\nand flame burst out, but Aten flung the ship into a mad whirl in which\nthe blaze was blown out.\n\nAnother freight ship helpless--and another. Then the air fleet of Rahn\nturned and fled. The ornithopters winged away in heavy, creaking\nterror. The others dived for speed and flattened out hardly above the\ntree-fern jungle. They streaked away in ignominious panic. Aten darted\nand circled above them and, as Tommy failed to fire, turned and went\nracing back toward the city.\n\n\"After the first ones went down,\" observed Tommy, \"they knew that if\nthey gassed the city we'd shoot them down into their own gas cloud. So\nthey ran away. I hope this gives us a pull.\"\n\nThe city's towers loomed before them. The lacy bridges swarmed with\nhuman figures. Somewhere a fight was in progress about a grounded\nplane from Rahn. Others seemed to have surrendered sullenly on\nalighting. For the first time Tommy saw the city as a thronging mass\nof humanity, and for the first time he realized how terrible must be\nthe strain upon the city if with so large a population so few could be\nfree for leisure in normal times.\n\nThe little plane settled down and landed lightly. There were a dozen\nmen on the landing platform now, and they were herding disarmed men\nfrom Rahn away from a big ship Tommy had brought down. Tommy looked\ncuriously at the prisoners. They seemed freer than the inhabitants of\nYugna. Their faces showed no such signs of strain. But they did not\nseem well-fed, nor did they appear as capable or as resolute.\n\n\"_Cuyal_,\" said Aten in an explanatory tone, seeing Tommy's\nexpression. He put his shoulder to the big ship, to wheel it back into\nits shed.\n\n\"You son of a gun,\" grunted Tommy, \"it's all in the day's work to you,\nfighting an invading fleet!\"\n\nA messenger came panting through the doorway. Tommy grinned.\n\n\"The Council wants us, Evelyn. Now maybe they'll listen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe atmosphere of the resumed Council meeting was, as a matter of\nfact, considerably changed. The white-bearded Keeper of Foodstuffs\nthanked them with dignity. He invited Tommy to offer advice, since his\nservices had proved so useful.\n\n\"Advice?\" said Tommy, in the halting, fumbling phrases he had slaved\nto acquire. \"I would put the prisoners from Rahn to work at the\nmachines, releasing citizens.\" There was a buzz of approval, and he\nadded drily in English: \"I'm playing politics, Evelyn.\" Again in the\nspeech of Yugna he added: \"And I would have the fleet of Yugna soar\nabove Rahn, not to demand tribute as that city did, but to disable all\nits aircraft, so that such piracy as to-day may not be tried again!\"\nThere was a second buzz of approval. \"And third,\" said Tommy\nearnestly, \"I would communicate with Earth, rather than assassinate\nit. I would require the science of Earth for the benefit of this\nworld, rather than use the science of this world to annihilate that!\nI--\"\n\nFor the second time the Council meeting was interrupted. An armed\nmessenger came pounding into the room. He reported swiftly. Tommy\ngrasped Evelyn's wrist in what was almost a painful grip.\n\n\"Noises in the Tube!\" he told her sharply. \"Earth-folk doing something\nin the Tube Jacaro came through. Your father....\"\n\nThere was an alert silence in the Council hall. The white-bearded old\nman had listened to the messenger. Now he asked a grim question of\nTommy.\n\n\"They may be my friends, or your enemies,\" said Tommy briefly. \"Mass\nthermit-throwers and let me find out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the only possible thing to do. Tommy and Evelyn went with the\nCouncil, in a body, in a huge wheeled vehicle that raced across the\ncity. Lingering groups still searched the sky above them, now\nblessedly empty again. But the Council's vehicle dived down and down\nto ground level, where the rumble of machines was loud indeed, and\nthen turned into a tunnel which went down still farther. There was\nfeverish activity ahead, where it stopped, and a golden\nthermit-thrower came into sight upon a dull-colored truck.\n\nQuestions. Feverish replies. The white-bearded man touched Tommy on\nthe shoulder, regarding him with a peculiarly noncommittal gaze, and\npointed to a doorway that someone was just opening. The door swung\nwide. There was a confusion of prismatically-colored mist within it,\nand Tommy noticed that tanks upon tanks were massed outside the metal\nwall of that compartment, and seemingly had been pouring something\ninto the room.\n\nThe mist drew back from the door. Saffron-red lighting panels appeared\ndimly, then grew distinct. There were small, collapsed bundles of fur\nupon the floor of the storeroom being exposed to view. They were,\nprobably, the equivalent of rats. And then the last remnant of mist\nvanished with a curiously wraithlike abruptness, and the end of\nJacaro's Tube came into view.\n\nTommy advanced, Evelyn clinging to his sleeve. There were clanking\nnoises audible in this room even above the dull rumble of the city's\nmachines. The noises came from the Tube's mouth. It was four feet and\nmore across, and it projected at a crazy angle out of a previously\nsolid wall.\n\n\"Hello!\" shouted Tommy. \"Down the Tube!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clattering noise stopped, then continued at a faster rate.\n\n\"The gas is cut off!\" shouted Tommy again. \"Who's there?\"\n\nA voice gasped from the Tube's depths:\n\n\"It's him!\" The tone was made metallic by echoing and reechoing in the\nbends of the Tube, but it was Smithers. \"We're comin', Mr. Reames.\"\n\n\"Is--is Daddy there?\" called Evelyn eagerly. \"Daddy!\"\n\n\"Coming,\" said a grim voice.\n\nThe clattering grew nearer. A goggled, gas-masked head appeared, and a\nbody followed it out of the Tube, laden with a multitude of burdens. A\nsecond climbed still more heavily after the first. The brightly-colored\ncitizens of the Golden City reached quietly to the weapons at their\nwaists. A third voice came up the Tube, distant and nearly\nunintelligible. It roared a question.\n\nSmithers ripped off his gas mask and said distinctly:\n\n\"Sure we're through. Go ahead. An' go to hell!\"\n\nThen there was a thunderous detonation somewhere down in the Tube's\ndepths. The visible part of it jerked spasmodically and cracked\nacross. A wisp of brownish smoke puffed out of it, and the stinging\nreek of high explosive tainted the air. Then Evelyn was clinging close\nto her father, and he was patting her comfortingly, and Smithers was\npumping both of Tommy's hands, his normal calmness torn from him for\nonce. But after a bare moment he had gripped himself again. He\nunloaded an impressive number of parcels from about his person. Then\nhe regarded the citizens of the Golden City with an impersonal,\nestimating gaze, ignoring twenty weapons trained upon him.\n\n\"Those damn fools back on Earth,\" he observed impassively, \"decided\nthe professor an' me was better off of it. So they let us come through\nthe Tube before they blew it up. We brought the explosive bullets, Mr.\nReames. I hope we brought enough.\"\n\nAnd Tommy grinned elatedly as Denham turned to crush his hands in his\nown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\"_Those Devils Have Got Evelyn!_\"\n\n\nThat night the three of them talked, on a high terrace with most of\nthe Golden City spread out below them. Over their heads, lights of\nmany colors moved and shifted slowly in the sky. There were a myriad\nglowing specks of saffron-red about the ways of the city, and the air\nwas full of fragrant odors. The breath of the jungle reached them even\na thousand feet above ground. And the dull, persistent roar of the\nmachines reached them too. There were five people on the terrace:\nTommy, Denham, Smithers, Aten and the white-bearded old Keeper of\nFoodstuffs. He looked on as the Earthmen talked.\n\n\"We're marooned,\" Tommy was saying crisply, \"and for the time being\nwe've got to throw in with these people. I believe they came from\nEarth originally. Four, five thousand years ago, perhaps. Their tale\nis of a cave they sealed up behind them. It might have been a\nprimitive Tube, if such a thing can be imagined.\"\n\nDenham filled his pipe and lighted it meditatively.\n\n\"Half the American Indian tribes,\" he observed drily, \"had legends of\ncoming originally from an underworld. I wonder if Tubes are less your\nown invention than we thought?\"\n\nTommy shrugged.\n\n\"In any case, Earth is safe.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" insisted Denham. \"You say they understood at once when you\ntalked of dimension-travel. Ask the old chap there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy frowned, then labored with the question. The bearded old man\nspoke gravely. At his answer, Tommy grimaced.\n\n\"Datl's gone looking for the cave their legends tell of,\" he said\nreluctantly. \"He's the lad who wanted the city to gas Earth with some\nghastly stuff they know of, and move over when the gas was harmless\nagain. But the cave has been lost for centuries, and it's in the\ntorrid zone--which _is_ torrid! We're near the North Pole of this\nplanet, and it's tropic here. It must be mighty hot at the equator.\nDatl took a ship and supplies and sailed off. He may be killed. In any\ncase it'll be some time before he's dangerous. Meanwhile, as I said,\nwe're marooned.\"\n\n\"And more,\" said Denham deliberately. \"By the time the authorities\nhalfway believed me, and Von Holtz could talk, there were more deaths\nfrom the Death Mist. It wiped out a village, clean. So when it was\nrealized that I'd caused it--or that was their interpretation--and was\nthe only man who could cause it again, why, the authorities thought it\na splendid idea for me to come through the Tube. They invited me to\ncommit suicide. My knowledge was too dangerous for a man to have. So,\"\nhe added grimly, \"I have committed suicide. We will not be welcomed\nback on Earth, Tommy.\"\n\nTommy made an impatient gesture.\n\n\"Worry about that later,\" he said impatiently. \"Right now there's a\nwar on. Rahn's desperate, and the prisoners we took this morning say\nJacaro and his gunmen are there, advising them. Ragged Men have joined\nin to help kill civilized humans. And they've still got aircraft.\"\n\n\"Which can still bombard this city,\" observed Denham. \"Can't they?\"\n\nTommy pointed to the many-colored beams of light playing through the\nsky overhead.\n\n\"No. Those lights were invented to guide night-flying planes back\nhome. They're static lights--cold lights, by the way--and they\nregister powerfully when a static-discharge propeller comes within\nrange of them. If Rahn tries a night attack, Aten and I take off and\nshoot them down again. That's that. But we've got to design gas masks\nfor these people, and I think I can persuade the Council to send over\nand take all Rahn's aircraft away to-morrow. But the real emergency is\nthe jungle.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe expounded the situation of the city as he understood it. He labored\npainstakingly to make his meaning clear while Denham blew meditative\nsmoke rings and Smithers listened quietly. But when Tommy had\nfinished, Smithers said in a vast calm:\n\n\"Say, Mr. Reames, y'know I asked you to get somebody to take me\nthrough some o' these engine rooms. That's kinda my specialty. An'\nthese folks are good, no question! There's engines--even steam\nengines--we couldn't build on Earth. But, my Gawd, they're dumb! There\nain't a piece of automatic machinery on the place. There's one man to\nevery motor, handlin' the controls or the throttle. They got stuff we\ncouldn't come near, but they never thought of a steam governor.\"\n\nTommy turned kindling eyes upon him. \"Go on!\"\n\n\"Hell,\" said Smithers, \"gimme some tools an' I'll go through one shop\nan' cut the workin' force in half, just slammin' governors, reducin'\nvalves, an' automatic cut-offs on the machines I understand!\"\n\nTommy jumped to his feet. He paced up and down, then halted and began\nto spout at Aten and the Keeper of Foodstuffs. He gesticulated,\nfumbling for words, and hunted absurdly for the ones he wanted among\nhis written lists, and finally was drawing excitedly on Aten's\nblack-metal tablet. Smithers got up and looked over his shoulder.\n\n\"That ain't it, Mr. Reames,\" he said slowly. \"Maybe I....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy pressed the stud that erased the page. Smithers took the tablet\nand began to draw painstakingly. Aten, watching, exclaimed suddenly.\nSmithers was drawing an actual machine, actually used in the Golden\nCity, and he was making a working sketch of a governor so that it\nwould operate without supervision while the steam pressure continued.\nAten began to talk excitedly. The Keeper of Foodstuffs took the tablet\nand examined it. He looked blank, then amazed, and as the utterly\nforeign idea of a machine which controlled itself struck home, his\nhands shook and color deepened in his cheeks.\n\nHe gave an order to Aten, who dashed away. In ten minutes other men\nbegan to arrive. They bent over the drawing. Excited comments,\ndiscussions and disputes began. A dawning enthusiasm manifested\nitself. Two of them approached Smithers respectfully, with shining\neyes. They drew their tablets from their belts, rather skilfully drew\nthe governor he had indicated in larger scale, and by gestures asked\nfor more detailed plans. Smithers stood up to go with them.\n\n\"You're a hero, now, Smithers,\" Tommy informed him exultantly.\n\"They'll work you to death and call you blessed!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Smithers. \"These fellas are right good mechanics.\nThey just happened to miss this trick.\" He paused. \"Uh--where's Miss\nEvelyn?\"\n\n\"With Aten's--wife,\" said Tommy. This was no time to discuss the\nmarital system of Yugna. \"We were prisoners until this morning. Now\nwe're guests of honor. Evelyn's talking to a lot of women and trying\nto boost our prestige.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSmithers went over to the gesticulating group of draftsmen. He settled\ndown to explain by drawings, since he had not a word of their\nlanguage. In a few minutes a group went rushing away with the sketch\ntablets held jealously to their breasts, bound for workshops. Other\nmen appeared to present new problems. A wave of sheer enthusiasm was\nin being. A new idea which would lessen the demands of the machines\nwas a godsend to these folk.\n\nThen Denham blew a smoke ring and said meditatively:\n\n\"I think I've got something too, Tommy. Ultra-sonic vibrations. Sound\nwaves at two to three hundred thousand per second. Air won't carry\nthem. Liquids will. They use 'em to sterilize milk, killing the germs\nby sound waves carried through the fluid. I think we can start some\nultra-sonic generators out there that will go through the wet soil and\nkill all vegetation within a given range. We might clear away the\njungle for half a mile or so and then use ultra-sonic beams to help it\nclear while new food-plants are tried out.\"\n\nTommy's eyes glowed.\n\n\"You've given yourself a job! We'll turn this planet upside down.\"\n\n\"We'll have to,\" said Denham drily. \"This city may believe in you, but\nthere are others, and these folk are a little too clever. There's no\nreason why some other city shouldn't attack Earth, if they seriously\nattack the problem of building a Tube.\"\n\nTommy ground his teeth, frowning. Then he started up. There was a new\nnoise down in the city. A sudden flare of intolerable illumination\nbroke out. There was an explosion, many screams, then the yelling\ntumult of men in deadly battle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery man on the tower terrace was facing toward the noise, staring.\nThe white-bearded man gave an order, deliberately. Men rushed. But as\nthey swarmed toward an exit, a green beam of light appeared near the\nuproar. It streaked upward, wavering from side to side and making the\ngolden walls visible in a ghostly fashion. It shivered in a hasty\nrhythm.\n\nAten groaned, almost sobbed. There was another flash of that\nunbearable actinic flame. A thermit-thrower was in action. Then a\nthird flash. This was farther away. The tumult died suddenly, but the\ngreen light-beam continued its motion.\n\nTommy was snapping questions. Aten spoke, and choked upon his words.\nTommy swore in a sudden raging passion and then turned a chalky face\ntoward the other two men from Earth.\n\n\"The prisoners!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"The men from Rahn! They\nbroke loose. They rushed an arsenal. With hand weapons and a\nthermit-thrower they fought their way to a place where the big\nvehicles are kept. They raided a dwelling-tower on the way and seized\nwomen. They've gone off on the metal roads through the jungle!\" He\ntried to ease his collar. Aten, still watching the green beam, croaked\nanother sentence. \"Those devils have got Evelyn!\" cried Tommy\nhoarsely. \"My God! Aten's wife, and his....\" He jerked a hand toward\nthe Councilor. \"Fifty women--gone through the jungle with them, toward\nRahn! Those devils have got Evelyn!\"\n\nHe whirled upon Aten, seizing his shoulder, shaking the man as he\nroared questions.\n\n\"No chance of catching them.\" Far away, in the jungle, the infinitely\nvivid actinic flame blazed for several seconds. \"They've sprayed\nthermit on the road. It's melted and ruined. It'd take hours to haul\nthe ground vehicles past the gap. They're got arms and lights. They\ncan fight off the beasts and Ragged Men. They'll make Rahn. And\nthen\"--he shook with the rage that possessed him--\"Jacaro's there with\nthose gunmen of his and his friends the Ragged Men!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe seemed to control himself with a terrific effort. He turned to the\nwhite-bearded Councilor, whose bearing was that of a man stunned by\ndisaster. Tommy spoke measuredly, choosing words with a painstaking\ncare, clipping the words crisply as he spoke.\n\nThe Councilor stiffened. Old as he was, an undeniable fighting light\ncame into his eyes. He barked orders right and left. Men woke from the\nparalysis of shock and fled upon errands of his command. And Tommy\nturned to Denham and Smithers.\n\n\"The women will be safe until dawn,\" he said evenly. \"Our late\nprisoners can't lose the way--aluminum roads that are no longer much\nused lead between all the cities--but they won't dare stop in the\njungles. They'll go straight on through. They should reach Rahn at\ndawn or a little before. And at dawn our air fleet will be over the\ncity and they'll give back the women, unharmed, or we'll turn their\nown trick on them, by God! It'd be better for Evelyn to die of gas\nthan as--as the Ragged Men would kill her!\"\n\nHis hands were clenched and he breathed noisily for an instant. Then\nhe swallowed, and went on in the same unnatural calm:\n\n\"Smithers, you're going to stay behind, with part of the air fleet.\nYou'll get aloft before dawn and shoot down any strange aircraft. They\nmight try to stalemate us by repeating their threat, with our guns\nover Rahn. I'll give orders.\"\n\nHe turned again to the Councilor, who nodded, glanced at Smithers, and\nrepeated the command.\n\n\"You, sir,\" he spoke to Denham, \"you'll come with me. It's your right,\nI suppose. And we'll go down and get ready.\"\n\nHe led the way steadily toward a door. But he reached up to his\ncollar, once, as if he were choking, and ripped away collar and coat\nand all, unconscious of the resistance of the cloth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat night the Golden City made savage preparation for war. Ships were\nloaded and ranged in order. Crews armed themselves, and helped in the\nloading and arming of other ships. Oddly enough, it was to Tommy that\nmen came to ask if the directing apparatus for the Death Mist should\nbe carried. The Death Mist could, of course, be used as a gas alone,\ndrifting with the wind, or it could be directed from a distance. This\nhad been done on Earth, with the directional impulses sent blindly\ndown the Tube merely to keep the Mist moving always. The controlling\napparatus could be carried in a monster freight plane. Tommy ordered\nit done. Also he had the captured planes from Rahn refitted for flight\nby replacing their smashed propelling grids. Fresh crews of men for\nthese ships organized themselves.\n\nWhen the fleet took off there was only darkness in all the world. The\nunfamiliar stars above shone bright and very near as Tommy's ship,\nleading, winged noiselessly up and down and straight away from the\nplay of prismatic lights above the city. Behind him, silhouetted\nagainst that many-colored glow, were the angular shapes of many other\nnoiseless shadows. The ornithopters with their racket would start\nlater, so the planes would be soaring above Rahn before their presence\nwas even suspected. The rest of the fleet flew in darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flight above the jungle would have been awe-inspiring at another\ntime. There were the stars above, nearer and brighter than those of\nEarth. There was no Milky Way in the firmament of this universe. The\nstars were separate and fewer in number. There was no moon. And below\nthere was only utter, unrelieved darkness, from which now and again\nbeast-sounds arose. They were clearly audible on board the silent air\nfleet. Roarings, bellowings, and hoarse screamings. Once the ships\npassed above a tumult as of unthinkable monsters in deadly battle,\nwhen for an instant the very clashing of monstrous jaws was audible\nand a hissing sound which seemed filled with deadly hate.\n\nThen lights--few of them, and dim ones. Then blazing fires--Ragged\nMen, camped without the walls of Rahn or in some gold-walled courtyard\nwhere the jungle thrust greedy, invading green tentacles. The air\nfleet circled noiselessly in a huge batlike cloud. Then things came\nracing from the darkness, down below, and there was a tumult and a\nshouting, and presently the hilarious, insanely gleeful uproar of the\nRagged Men. Tommy's face went gray. These were the escaped prisoners,\narrived actually after the air fleet which was to demand the return of\ntheir captives.\n\nTommy wet his lips and spoke grimly to his pilot. There were six men\nand many Death-Mist bombs in his ship. He was asking if communication\ncould be had with the other ships. It was wise to let Rahn know at\nonce that avengers lurked overhead for the captives just delivered\nthere.\n\nFor answer, a green signal-beam shot out. It wavered here and there.\nTommy commanded again. And as the signal-beam flickered, he somehow\nsensed the obedience of the invisible ships about him. They were\nsweeping off to right and left. Bombs of the Death Mist were dropping\nin the darkness. Even in the starlight, Tommy could see great walls of\npale vapor building themselves up above the jungle. And a sudden\nconfused noise of yapping defiance and raging hatred came up from the\ncity of Rahn. But before dawn came there was no other sign that their\npresence was known.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ornithopters came squeaking and rattling in their heavy flight\njust as the dull-red sun of this world peered above the horizon. The\ntree-fern fronds waved languidly in the morning breeze. The walls and\ntowers of Rahn gleamed bright gold, in parts, and in parts they seemed\ndull and scabrous with some creeping fungus stuff, and on one side of\nthe city the wall was overwhelmed by a triumphant tide of green. There\nthe jungle had crawled over the ramparts and surged into the city.\nThree of the towers had their bases in the welter of growing things,\nand creepers had climbed incredibly and were still climbing to enter\nand then destroy the man-made structures.\n\nBut about the city there now reared a new rampart, rising above the\ntree-fern tops: there was a wall of the Death Mist encompassing the\ncity. No living thing could enter or leave the city without passing\nthrough that cloud. And at Tommy's order it moved forward to the very\nencampments of the Ragged Men.\n\nHe spoke, beginning his ultimatum. But a movement below checked him.\nOn a landing stage that was spotted with molds and lichens, women were\nbeing herded into clear view. They were the women of the Golden City.\nTommy saw a tiny figure in khaki--Evelyn! Then there was a sudden\nuproar from an encampment of the Ragged Men. His eyes flicked there,\nand he saw the Ragged Men running into and out of the tall wall of\nDeath Mist. And they laughed uproariously and ran into and out of the\nMist again.\n\nHis pilot dived down. The Ragged Men yelled and capered and howled\nderisively at him. He saw that they removed masklike things from their\nfaces in order to shout, and donned them again before running again\ninto the Mist. At once he understood. The Ragged Men had gas masks!\n\nThen, a sudden cracking noise. Three men had opened fire with rifles\nfrom below. Their garments were drab-colored, in contrast to the vivid\ntints of the clothing of the inhabitants of Rahn. They were Jacaro's\ngunmen. And a great freight carrier from Yugna veered suddenly, and a\nbluish flash burst out before it, and it began to flutter helplessly\ndown into the city beneath.\n\nThe weapons of Tommy's fleet were useless, since the citizens of Rahn\nwere protected by gas masks. And Tommy's fighting ships were subject\nto the same rifle fire against their propelling grids that had\ndefeated the fleet from Rahn. The only thing the avenging fleet could\nnow accomplish was the death of the women it could not save.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_War!_\n\n\nA huge ornithopter came heavily out on the landing stage in the city\nof Rahn. Its crew took their places. With a creaking and rattling\nnoise it rose toward the invading fleet. From its filigree cockpit\nsides, men waved green branches. A green light wavered from the big\nplane that carried the bearded Council man and Denham. That plane\nswept forward and hovered above the ornithopter. The two flying things\nseemed almost fastened together, so closely did their pilots maintain\nthat same speed and course. A snaky rope went coiling down into the\nlower ship's cockpit. A burly figure began to climb it hand over hand.\nA second figure followed. A third figure, in the drab clothing that\ndistinguished Jacaro's men from all others, wrapped the rope about\nhimself and was hauled up bodily. And Tommy had seen Jacaro but once,\nyet he was suddenly grimly convinced that this was Jacaro himself.\n\nThe two planes swept apart. The ornithopter descended toward the\nlanding stage of Rahn. The freight plane swept toward the ship that\ncarried Tommy. Again the snaky rope coiled down. And Tommy swung up\nthe fifteen feet that alone separated the two soaring planes, and\nlooked into the hard, amused eyes of Jacaro where he sat between two\nother emissaries of Rahn. One of them was half naked and savage, with\nthe light of madness in his eyes. A Ragged Man. The other was lean and\ndesperate, despite the colored tunic of a civilized man that he wore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Hello,\" said Jacaro blandly. \"We come up to talk things over.\"\n\nTommy gave him the briefest of nods. He looked at Denham--who was\ndeathly white and grim--and the bearded Councilor.\n\n\"I' been givin' 'em the dope,\" said Jacaro easily. \"We got the whip\nhand now. We got gas masks, we got guns just the same as you have, an'\nwe got the women.\"\n\n\"You haven't ammunition,\" said Tommy evenly, \"or damned little. Your\nmen brought down one ship, and stopped. If you had enough shells would\nyou have stopped there?\"\n\nJacaro grinned.\n\n\"You got arithmetic, Reames,\" he conceded. \"That's so. But--I'm sayin'\nit again--we got the women. Your girl, for one! Now, how about\nthrowin' in with me, you an' the professor?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"In a coupla months, Rahn'll be runnin' this planet,\" said Jacaro\nblandly, \"and I'm runnin' Rahn! I didn't know how easy the racket'd\nbe, or I'd 've let Yugna alone. I'd 've come here first. Now get it!\nRahn runnin' the planet, with a couple guys runnin' Rahn an' passin'\ndown through a Tube any little thing we want, like a few million bucks\nin solid gold. An' Rahn an' the other cities for kinda country homes\nfor us an' our friends. All the women we want, good liquor, an' a\nswell time!\"\n\n\"Talk sense,\" said Tommy, without even contempt in his tone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJacaro snarled.\n\n\"No sense actin' too big!\" But the snarl encouraged Tommy, because it\nproved Jacaro less confidant than he tried to seem. His next change of\ntone proved it. \"Aw, hell!\" he said placatingly. \"This is what I'm\nfigurin' on. These guys ain't used to fighting, but they got the\nstuff. They got gases that are hell-roarin'. They got ships can beat\nany we got back home. Figure out the racket. A couple big Tubes,\nthat'll let a ship--maybe folded--go through. A fleet of 'em floatin'\nover N'York, loaded with gas--that white stuff y' can steer wherever\ny' want it. Figure the shake-down. We could pull a hundred million\nfrom Chicago! We c'd take over the whole United States! Try that on y'\npiano! Me, King Jacaro, King of America!\" His dark eyes flashed. \"I'll\ngive y' Canada or Mexico, whichever y' want. Name y' price, guy. A\ncoupla months organizin' here, buildin' a big Tube, then....\"\n\nTommy's expression did not change.\n\n\"If it were that easy,\" he said drily, \"you wouldn't be bargaining.\nI'm not altogether a fool, Jacaro. We want those women back. You want\nsomething we've got, and you want it badly. Cut out the oratory and\ntell me the real price for the return of the women, unharmed.\"\n\nJacaro burst into a flood of profanity.\n\n\"I'd rather Evelyn died from gas,\" said Tommy, \"than as your filthy\nRagged Men would kill her. And you know I mean it.\" He switched to the\nlanguage of the cities to go on coldly: \"If one woman is harmed, Rahn\ndies. We will shoot down every ship that rises from her stages. We\nwill spray burning thermit through her streets. We will cover her\ntowers with gas until her people starve in the gas masks they've\nmade!\"\n\nThe lean man in the tunic of Rahn snarled bitterly: \"What matter? We\nstarve now!\"\n\nTommy turned upon him as Jacaro whirled and cursed him bitterly for\nthe revealing outburst.\n\n\"We will ransom the women with food,\" said Tommy coldly--and then his\neyes flamed, \"and thrash you afterwards for fools!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe made a gesture to the Keeper of Foodstuffs. It was unconsciously an\nauthoritative gesture, though the Keeper of Foodstuffs was in the\nstate of affairs in Yugna the head of the Council. But that old man\nspoke deliberately. The man from Rahn snarled his reply. And Tommy\nturned aside as the bargaining went on. He could see Evelyn down\nbelow, a tiny speck of khaki amid the rainbow-colored robes of the\nother women. This had been a savage expedition, to rescue or to\navenge. It had deteriorated into a bargain. Tommy heard, dully,\namounts of unfamiliar weights and measures of foodstuffs he did not\nrecognize. He heard the time and place of payment named: the gate of\nYugna, the third dawn hence. He hardly looked up as at some signal one\nof their own ornithopters slid below and the three ambassadors of Rahn\nprepared to go over the side. But Jacaro snarled out of one corner of\nhis mouth.\n\n\"These guys are takin' each other's words. Maybe that's all right, but\nI'm warnin' you, if there's any double-crossin'....\"\n\nHe was gone. The Keeper of Foodstuffs touched Tommy's shoulder.\n\n\"Our flier,\" he said slowly, \"will make sure our women are as yet\nunharmed. We are to deliver the foods at our own city gate, and after\nthe women have been returned. Rahn dares not keep them or harm them.\nWe of Yugna keep our word. Even in Rahn they know it.\"\n\n\"But they won't keep theirs,\" said Tommy heavily. \"Not with a man of\nEarth to lead them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched with his heart in his mouth as the ornithopter alighted\nnear the assembled women of Yugna. As the three ambassadors climbed\nout, he could hear the faint murmur of voices. The men of Yugna, under\ntruce, called across the landing stage to the women of their own city,\nand the women replied to them. Then the crew of the one grounded\nfreighter arrived on the landing stage and the flapping flier rose\nslowly and rejoined the fleet. Its crew shouted a shamefaced\nreassurance to the flagship.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Tommy bitterly, \"we'd better go back--if you're sure\nthe women are safe.\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" said the old man unhappily, \"or I had not agreed to pay\nhalf the foodstuffs in Yugna for their return.\"\n\nHe withdrew into a troubled silence as the fleet swept far from\ntriumphantly for him. Denham had not spoken at all, though his eyes\nhad blazed savagely upon the men of Rahn. Now he spoke,\ndry-throatedly:\n\n\"Tommy--Evelyn--\"\n\n\"She is all right so far,\" said Tommy bitterly. \"She's to be ransomed\nby foodstuffs, paid at the gates of Yugna. And Jacaro bragged he's\nrunning Rahn--and they've got gas masks. We'd better be ready for\ntrouble after the women are returned.\"\n\nDenham nodded grimly. Tommy reached out and took one of the black\ntablets from the man beside him. He began to draw carefully, his eyes\nsavage.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"There's high-pressure steam in Yugna,\" said Tommy coldly. \"I'm\ndesigning steam guns. Gravity feed of spherical projectiles. A jet of\nsteam instead of gunpowder. They'll be low-velocity, but we can use\nbig-calibre balls for shock effect, and with long barrels they ought\nto serve for a hundred yards or better. Smooth bore, of course.\"\n\nDenham stirred. His lips were pinched.\n\n\"I'll design a gas mask,\" he said restlessly, \"and Smithers and I,\nbetween us, will do what we can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe air fleet went on over the waving tree-fern jungle in an unvarying\nmonotony of bitterness. Presently Tommy wearily explained his design\nto the bearded Councilor who, with the quick comprehension of\nmechanical design apparently instinctive in these folk, grasped it\nimmediately. He selected three of the six-man crew and passed Tommy's\ndrawings to them. While the jungle flowed beneath the fleet they\nstudied the sketches, made other drawings, and showed them eagerly to\nTommy. When the fleet soared down to the scattered landing stages, not\nonly was the design understood but apparently plans for production had\nbeen made. It did not take the men of the Golden City long to respond.\n\nTommy flung himself savagely into the work he had taken upon himself.\nIt did not occur to him to ask for authority. He knew what had to be\ndone and he set to work to do it, commanding men and materials as if\nthere could be no question of disobedience. As a matter of fact, he\nyielded impatiently to an order of the Council that he should present\nhimself in the Council hall, and, since no questions were asked him,\ncontinued his organizing in the very presence of the Council, sending\nfor information and giving orders in a low tone while the Council\ndeliberated. A vote was taken by the voting machine. At its end, he\nwas solemnly informed that, though not a native of Yugna, he was\nentrusted with the command of the defense forces of the city. His\nskill in arms--as evidenced by his defeat of the fleet of Rahn--and\nhis ability in command--when he met the gas-mask defense of Rahn with\na threat of starvation--moved the Council to that action. He accepted\nthe command almost abstractedly, and hurried away to pick gun\nemplacements.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin four hours after the return of the fleet, the first steam gun\nwas ready for trial. Smithers appeared, sweat-streaked and vastly\ncalm, to announce that others could be turned out in quantity.\n\n\"These guys have got the stuff,\" he said steadily. \"Instead o' castin'\ntheir stuff, they shoot it on a core in a melted spray. They ain't got\nsteel, an' copper's scarce, but they got some alloys that are good an'\ntough. One's part tungsten or I'm crazy.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"Turn out all the guns you can,\" he said. \"I look for fighting.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Smithers. \"Miss Evelyn's still all right?\"\n\n\"Up to three hours ago,\" said Tommy grimly. \"Every three hours one of\nour ships lands in Rahn and reports. We give the Rahnians their stuff\nat our own city gates. I've warned Jacaro that we've mounted\nthermit-throwers on our food stores. If he manages to gas us by\nsurprise, nevertheless our foodstuffs can't be captured. They've got\nto turn over Evelyn and cart off their food before they dare to fight,\nelse they'll starve.\"\n\n\"But--uh--there're other cities they could stick up, ain't there?\"\n\n\"We've warned them,\" said Tommy curtly. \"They've got thermit-throwers\nmounted on their food supplies, too. And they're desperate enough to\nkeep Rahn off. They're willing enough to let Yugna do the fighting,\nbut they know what Rahn's winning will mean.\"\n\nSmithers turned away, then turned back.\n\n\"Uh--Mr. Reames,\" he said heavily, \"these fellas've gone near crazy\nabout governors an' reducing valves an' such. They're inventin' ways\nto use 'em on machines I don't make head or tail of. We got three-four\nhundred men loose from machines already, an' they're turnin' out these\nsteam guns as soon as you check up. There'll be more loose by night. I\nhad 'em spray some castin's for another Tube, too. Workin' like they\ndo, an' with the tools they got, they make speed.\"\n\nTommy responded impatiently: \"There's no steel, no iron for magnets.\"\n\n\"I know,\" admitted Smithers. \"I'm tryin' steam cylinders\nto--uh--energize the castin's, instead o' coils. It'll be ready by\nmornin'. I wish you'd look it over, Mr. Reames. If Miss Evelyn gets\nsafe into the city, we could send her down the Tube to Earth until the\nfightin's over.\"\n\n\"I'll try to see it,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"I'll try!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned back to the set-up steam gun. A flexible pipe from a heavily\ninsulated cylinder ran to it. A hopper dropped metallic balls down\ninto a bored-out barrel, where they were sucked into the blast of\nsuperheated steam from the storage cylinder. At a touch of the trigger\na monstrous cloud of steam poured out. It was six feet from the gun\nmuzzle before it condensed enough to be visible. Then a huge white\ncloud developed; but the metal pellets went on with deadly force. Half\nan inch in diameter, they carried seven hundred yards at extreme\nelevation. Point-blank range was seventy-five yards. They would kill\nat three hundred, and stun or disable beyond that. At a hundred yards\nthey would tear through a man's body.\n\nTommy was promised a hundred of the weapons, with their boilers, in\ntwo days. He selected their emplacements. He directed that a disabling\ndevice be inserted, so if rushed they could not be turned against\ntheir owners. He inspected the gas masks being turned out by the\nwomen, who in this emergency worked like the men. Though helpless\nbefore machinery, it seemed, they could contrive a fabric device like\na gas mask.\n\nThe second day the work went on more desperately still. But Smithers'\nwork in releasing men was telling. There were fifteen hundred\ngovernors, or reducing valves, or autocratic cut-outs in operation\nnow. And fifteen hundred men were released from the machines, which\nhad to be kept going to keep the city alive. With that many men,\nintelligent mechanics all, Tommy and Smithers worked wonders. Smithers\ndrove them mercilessly, using profanity and mechanical drawings\ninstead of speech. Denham withdrew twenty men and labored on top of\none of the towers. Toward sunset of the second day, vast clouds of\nsteam bellied out from it at odd, irregular intervals. Nothing else\nmanifested itself. Those irregular belchings of steam continued until\ndark, but Tommy paid no attention to them. He was driving the gunners\nof the machine guns to practice. He was planning patrols, devising a\nreserve, mounting thermit-throwers, and arranging for the delivery of\nthe promised ransom at the specified city gate. So far, there was no\nsign of anything unusual in Rahn. Messengers from Yugna saw the\ncaptive women regularly, once every three hours. The last to leave had\nreported them being loaded into great ground vehicles under a\ndefending escort, to travel through the dark jungle roads to Yugna. A\nvast concourse of empty vehicles was trailing into the jungle after\nthem, to bring back the food which would keep Rahn from starving, for\na while. It all seemed wholly regular.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt dawn, the remaining ships of the air fleet of Rahn were soaring\nsilently above the jungle about the Golden City. They made no threat.\nThey offered no affront. But they soared, and soared....\n\nA little after dawn, glitterings in the jungle announced the arrival\nof the convoy. Messengers, in advance, shouted the news. Men from\nYugna went out to inspect. The atmosphere grew tense. The air fleet of\nRahn drew closer.\n\nSlowly, a great golden gateway yawned. Four ground vehicles rolled\nforward, and under escort of the Rahnians entered the city. Half the\ncaptive women from Yugna were within them. They alighted, weeping for\njoy, and were promptly whisked away. Evelyn was not among them. Tommy\nground his teeth. An explanation came. When one half the promised\nransom was paid, the others would be forthcoming.\n\nTommy gave grim orders. Half the foodstuffs were taken to the city\ngate--half, no more. At his direction, it was explained gently to the\nRahnians that the rest of the ransom remained under guard of the\nthermit-throwers. It would not be exposed to capture until the last of\nthe captives were released. There was argument, expostulation. The\nrest of the women appeared. Aten, at Tommy's express command, piled\nEvelyn and his own wife into a ground vehicle and came racing madly to\nthe tower from which Tommy could see all the circuit of the city.\n\n\"You're all right?\" asked Tommy. At Evelyn's speechless nod, he put\nhis hand heavily on her shoulder. \"I'm glad,\" he managed to say. \"Put\non that gas mask. Hell's going to pop in a minute.\"\n\nHe watched, every muscle tense. There was confusion about the city\ngate. Ground vehicles, loaded with foodstuffs, poured out of the gate\nand back toward the jungle. Other vehicles with improvised\nenlargements to their carrying platforms--making them into huge closed\nboxes--rolled up to the gate. The loaded vehicles rolled back and back\nand back, and ever more apparently empty ones crowded about the city\ngate waiting for admission.\n\nThen there was a sudden flare of intolerable light. A wild yell arose.\nClouds of steam shot up from the ready steam guns. But the circling\nair fleet turned as one ship and plunged for the city. The leaders\nbegan to drop smoking things that turned into monstrous pillars of\nprismatically-colored mist. A wave of deadly vapor rolled over the\nramparts of the city. And then there was a long-continued ululation\nand the noise of battle. Ragged Men, hidden in the jungle, had swarmed\nupon the walls with ladders made of jungle reeds. They came over the\nparapet in a wave of howling madness. And they surged into the city,\nflinging gas bombs as they came.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Fight_\n\n\nThe city was pandemonium. Tommy, looking down from his post of\ncommand, swore softly under his breath. The Death Mist was harmless to\nthe defenders of Yugna as a gas, because of their gas masks. But it\nserved as a screen. It blotted out the waves of attackers so the steam\nguns could not be aimed save at the shortest of short ranges. His\nprecautions were taking effect, to be sure. Two thirds of the\nattackers were Ragged Men drawn from about half the surviving cities,\nand against such a horde Yugna could not have held out at all but for\nhis preparations. Now the defenders took a heavy toll. Swarms of men\ncame racing toward the open gate, their truncheons aglow in the\nsunlight. The ring of Death Mist was contracting as if to strangle the\ncity, and it left the ramparts bare again. And from more than one\npoint upon the battlements the roaring clouds of steam burst out\nagain. A dozen guns concentrated on the racing men of Rahn, plunging\nfrom the jungle to enter by the gate. They were racing forward,\nwithout order but at top speed, to share in the fighting and loot.\nThen streams of metal balls tore into them. The front of the irregular\ncolumn was wiped out utterly. Wide swathes were cut in the rest. The\nsurvivors ran wildly forward over a litter of dead and dying men.\nElectric-charge weapons sent crackling discharges among them. Their\ncontorted figures reeled and fell or leaped convulsively to lie\nforever still where they struck. And then the steam guns turned about\nto fire into the rear of the men who had charged past them.\n\nThe steam guns had literally blasted away the line of Ragged Men where\nthey stood. But the line went on, with great ragged gaps in it, to be\nsure, but still vastly outnumbering the defenders of the city. Here\nand there a steam gun was silent, its gun crew dead. And presently\nthose that were left were useless, immobile upon the ramparts in the\nrear of the attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDown in the ways of the city the fight rose to a riotous clamor. At\nTommy's order the women of the city had been concentrated into a few\nstrong towers. The machines of the city were left undefended for a\ntime. A few strong patrols of fighting men, strategically placed,\nflung themselves with irresistible force upon certain bands of\nmaddened Ragged Men. But where a combat raged, there the Ragged Men\nswarmed howling. Their hatred impelled them to suicidal courage and to\nunspeakable atrocities. From his tower, Tommy saw a man of Yugna,\nevidently a prisoner. Four Ragged Men surrounded him, literally\ntearing him to pieces like the maniacs they were. Then he saw dust\nspurting up in a swift-advancing line, and all four Ragged Men\ntwitched and collapsed on top of their victim. A steam gun had done\nthat. A fighting patrol of the men of Yugna swept fiercely down a\npaved way in one of the Golden City's vehicles. There was the glint of\ngold from it. A solid, choked mass of invaders rushed upon it. Without\nslackening speed, without a pause, the vehicle raced ahead.\nIntolerable flashes of light appeared. A thermit-thrower was mounted\non the machine. It drove forward like a flaming meteor, and as\nelectric-charge weapons flashed upon it men screamed and died. It tore\ninto a vast cloud of the Death Mist and the unbearable flames of its\nweapon could only be seen as illuminations of that deadly vapor.\n\nA part of the city was free of defenders, save the isolated steam\ngunners left behind upon the walls. Ragged Men, drunk with success,\nran through its ways, slashing at the walls, battering at the\nlight-panels, pounding upon the doorways of the towers. Tommy saw them\nhacking at the great doorway of a tower. It gave. They rushed within.\nAlmost instantly thereafter the opening spouted them forth again and\nafter them, leaping upon them, snapping and biting and striking out\nwith monstrous paws and teeth, were green lizard-things like the one\nthat had been killed--years back, it seemed--on Earth. A deadly combat\nbegan instantly. But when the last of the fighting creatures was down,\nno more than a dozen were left of the three score who had begun the\nfight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut this was not the main battle. The main battle was hidden under the\nDeath-Mist cloud, concentrated in a vast thick mass in the very center\nof the city. Tommy watched that grimly. Perhaps eight thousand men had\nassailed the city. Certainly two thousand of them were represented by\nthe still or twitching forms in queer attitudes here and there, in\nsingle dots or groups. There were seven hundred corpses before the\ncity gate alone, where the steam guns had mowed down a reinforcing\ncolumn. And there were others scattered all about. The defenders had\nlost heavily enough, but Tommy's defense behind the line of the\nramparts was soundly concentrated in strong points, equipped with\nsteam guns and mostly armed with thermit-throwers as well. From the\ncenter of the city there came only a vast, unorganized tumult of\nbattle and death.\n\nThen a huge winged thing came soaring down past Tommy's tower. It\nlanded with a crash on the roofs below, spilling its men like ants.\nTommy strained his eyes. There was a billowing outburst of steam from\nthe tower where Denham had been working the night before. A big flier\nburst into the weird bright flame of the thermit fluid. It fell,\nsplitting apart as it dropped. Again the billowing steam. No\nresult--but beyond the city walls showed a flash of thermit flame.\n\n\"Denham!\" muttered Tommy. \"He's got a steam cannon; he's shooting\nshells loaded with thermit! They smash when they hit. Good!\"\n\nHe dispatched a man with orders, but a messenger was panting his way\nup as the runner left. He thrust a scribbled bit of paper into Tommy's\nhand.\n\n    \"I'm trying to bring down the ship that's controlling the\n    Death Mist. I'll shell those devils in the middle of town as\n    soon as our controls can handle the Mist.\n\n                                                          Denham.\"\n\nTommy began to snap out his commands. He raced downward toward the\nstreet. Men seemed to spring up like magic about him. A ship with one\nwing aflame was tottering in mid-air, and another was dropping like a\nplummet.\n\nThen Tommy uttered a roar of pure joy. The huge globe of beautiful,\ndeadly vapor was lifting! Its control-ship was shattered, and men of\nthe Golden City had found its setting. The Mist rose swiftly in a\nsingle vast globule of varicolored reflections. And the situation in\nthe center of the city was clear. Two towers were besieged. Dense\nmasses of the invaders crowded about them, battering at them. Steam\nguns opened from their windows. Thermit-throwers shot out flashes of\ndeadly fire.\n\nTommy led five hundred men in savage assault, cleaving the mass of\ninvaders like a wedge. He cut off a hundred men and wiped them out,\nwhile a rear guard poured electric charges into the main body of the\nenemy. More men of Yugna came leaping from a dozen doorways and joined\nthem. Tommy found Smithers by his side, powder-stained and\nsweat-streaked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Miss Evelyn's all right?\" Smithers asked in a great calm.\n\n\"She is,\" growled Tommy. \"On the top floor of a tower, with a hundred\nmen to guard her.\"\n\n\"You didn't look at the Tube I made,\" said Smithers impassively; \"but\nI turned on the steam. Looks like it worked. It's ready to go through,\nanyways. It's the same place the other one was, down in that cellar.\nI'm tellin' you in case anything happens.\"\n\nHe opened fire with a magazine rifle into the thick of the mob that\nassailed the two towers. Tommy left him with fifty men to block a\nhighway and led his men again into the mass of mingled Ragged Men and\nRahnians. His followers saw his tactics now. They split off a section\nof the mob and fell upon it ferociously. There were sudden awful\nscreams. Thermit flame was rising from two places in the very thick of\nthe mob. It burst up from a third, and fourth, and fifth.... Denham,\natop his tower, had the range with his steam cannon, and was flinging\nheavy shells into the attackers of the two central buildings. And then\nthere was a roaring of steam and a ground vehicle came to a stop not\nfifty feet away. A gun crew of Yugnans had shifted their unwieldy\nweapon and its insulated steam boiler to a freight-carrying vehicle.\nNow the gunner pulled trigger and traversed his weapon into the thick\nof the massed invaders, while his companions worked desperately to\nkeep the hopper full of projectiles.\n\nThe invaders melted away. Steam guns in the towers, thermit\nprojectiles from the cannon far away: now this.... And the concealing\ncloud of Death Mist was rising still, headed straight up toward the\nzenith. It looked like a tiny, dwindling pearl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe assault upon Yugna had been a mad one, a frantic one. But the\nflight from Yugna was the flight of men trying to escape from hell.\nWild panic characterized the fleeing men. They threw aside their\nweapons and ran with screams of terror no whit less horrible than\ntheir howls of triumph had been. And Tommy would have stopped the\nslaughter, but there was no way to send orders to the rampart gunners\nin time. As the fugitives swarmed toward the walls again, the storms\nof steam-propelled missiles mowed them down. Even those who scrambled\ndown to the ground outside and fled sobbing for the jungle were\npursued by hails of bullets. Of the eight thousand men who assailed\nYugna, less than one in five escaped.\n\nPursuit was still in progress. Here and there, through the city, the\nsound of isolated combats still went on. Denham came down from his\ntower, looking rather sick as he saw the carnage about him. A strong\nescort brought Evelyn. Aten was grinning proudly, as though he had in\nperson defeated the enemy. And as Evelyn shakingly put out her hand to\ntouch Tommy's arm--it was only later that he realized he had been\nwounded in half a dozen minor ways--a shadow roared over their heads.\nThe crackle of firearms came from it.\n\n\"Jacaro!\" snarled Tommy. He leaped instinctively to pursue. But the\nflying thing was bound for a landing in an open square, the same one\nwhich not long since had seen the heaviest fighting. It alighted there\nand toppled askew on contact. Figures tumbled out of it, in torn and\nragged garments fashioned in the style of the very best tailors of the\nEarth's underworld.\n\nMen of Yugna raced to intercept them. Firearms spat and bellowed\nluridly. In a close-knit, flame-spitting group, the knot of men raced\nover fallen bodies and hurtled areas where the pavement had cooled to\nno more than a dull-red heat where a thermit shell had struck. One\nman, two, three men fell under the small-arms fire. The gangsters went\nracing on, firing desperately. They dived into a tunnel and\ndisappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Tube!\" roared Smithers. \"They' goin' for the Tube!\"\n\nHe plunged forward, and Tommy seized his arm.\n\n\"They'll go through your Tube,\" he said curtly. \"It looks like the one\nthey came through. They'll think it is. Let 'em!\"\n\nSmithers tried to tear free.\n\n\"But they'll get back to Earth!\" he raged. \"They'll get off clear!\"\n\nThe sharp, cracking sound of a gun-cotton explosion came out of the\ndoorway into which Jacaro and his men had dived. Tommy smiled very\ngrimly indeed.\n\n\"They've gone through,\" he said drily, \"and they've blown up the Tube\nbehind them. But--I didn't tell you--I took a look at your castings.\nYour pupils were putting them together, ready for the steam to go in,\nin place of the coils I used. But--er--Smithers! You'd discarded one\npair of castings. They didn't satisfy you. Your pupils forgot that.\nThey hooked them all together.\"\n\nSmithers gulped.\n\n\"Instead of four right-angled bends,\" said Tommy grimly, \"you have six\nconnected together. You turned on the steam in a hurry, not noticing.\nAnd I don't know how many series of dimensions there are in this\nuniverse of ours. We know of two. There may be any number. But Jacaro\nand his men didn't go back to Earth. God only knows where they landed,\nor what it's like. Maybe somewhere a million miles in space. Nobody\nknows. The main thing is that Earth is safe now. The Death Mist has\nfaded out of the picture.\"\n\nHe turned and smiled warmly at Evelyn. He was a rather horrible sight\njust then, though he did not know it. He was bloody and burned and\nwounded. He ignored all matters but success, however.\n\n\"I think,\" he said drily, \"we have won the confidence of the Golden\nCity, Evelyn, and that there'll be no more talk of gassing Earth. As\nsoon as the Council meets again, we'll make sure. And then--well, I\nthink we can devote a certain amount of time to our personal affairs.\nYou are the first Earth-girl to be kissed in the Fifth Dimension.\nWe'll have to see if you can't distinguish yourself further.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the Council hall in the tower of government in the Golden City\nof Yugna. Again the queer benches about the black wood table--though\ntwo of the seats that had been occupied were now empty. Again the\nguards behind the chairs, and the crowd of watchers--visitors,\ncitizens of Yugna attending the deliberations of the Council. The\naudience was a queer one, this time. There were bandages here and\nthere. There were men who were wounded, broken, bent and crippled in\nthe fighting. But a warmly welcoming murmur spread through the hall as\nTommy came in, himself rather extensively patched. He was wearing the\ntunic and breeches of the Golden City, because his own clothes were\nhopelessly beyond repair. The bearded old Councilor gathered the eyes\nof his fellows. They rose. This Council seated itself as one man.\n\nQuiet, placid formalities. The Keeper of Foodstuffs murmured that the\nransom paid to Rahn had been recaptured after the fight. The Keeper of\nRolls reported with savage satisfaction the number of enemies who had\nbeen slain in battle. He added that the loss to Yugna was less than\none man to ten of the enemy. And he added with still greater emphasis\nthat the shops being fitted with automatic controls had released\nnow--it had grown so much--two thousand men from the necessary\nday-and-night working force, and further releases were to be expected.\nThe demands of the machines were lessened already beyond the memory of\nman. Eyes turned to Tommy. There was an expectant pause for his reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have been Commander of Defense Forces,\" he told them slowly, \"in\nthis fighting. I have given you weapons. My two friends have done\nmore. The machines will need fewer and fewer attendants as the hints\nthey have given you are developed by yourselves. And there is some\nhope that one of my friends may show you, in ultra-sonic vibrations, a\nweapon against the jungle itself. My own work is finished. But I ask\nagain for friendship for my planet Earth. I ask that no war be made on\nmy own people. I ask that what benefits you receive from us be passed\nto the other surviving cities on the same terms. And since there can\nbe no further fighting on this scale, I give back my commission as\nCommander of Defense.\"\n\nThere was a little murmur among the men of Yugna, looking on. It rose\nto a protesting babble, to a shout of denial. The bearded old Keeper\nof Foodstuffs smiled.\n\n\"It is proposed that the appointment as Commander of Defense Forces be\npermanent,\" he said mildly.\n\nHe produced the queer black box and touched it in a certain fashion.\nHe passed it to the next man, and the next and next. It went around\nthe table. It passed a second time, but this time each man merely\nlooked at the top.\n\n\"You command the defense forces of Yugna for always,\" said the bearded\nold man, gently. \"Now give orders that your requests become laws.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy stared blankly. He was suddenly aware of Aten in the background,\nsmiling triumphantly and very happily at him. There was something like\na roar of approval from the men of Yugna, assembled.\n\n\"Just what,\" demanded Tommy, \"does this mean?\"\n\n\"For many years,\" said a hawk-faced man ungraciously, \"we have had no\nCommander of Defense. We have had no wars. But we see it is needful.\nWe have chosen you, with all agreeing. The Commander of Defense\"--he\nsniffed a little, pugnaciously--\"has the authority the ancient kings\nonce owned.\"\n\nTommy leaned back in the curious benchlike chair, his eyes narrow and\nthoughtful. This would simplify matters. No danger of trouble to\nEarth. A free hand for Denham and Smithers to help these folk, and for\nDenham to learn scientific facts--in the sciences they had\ndeveloped--which would be of inestimable value to Earth. And it could\nbe possible to open a peaceful trade with the nations of Earth without\nany danger of war. And maybe....\n\nHe smiled suddenly. It widened almost into a grin.\n\n\"All right. I'll settle down here for a while. But--er--just how does\none set about getting married here?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fifth-Dimension Tube, by \nWilliam Fitzgerald Jenkins\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FIFTH-DIMENSION TUBE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30408.txt or 30408.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/0/30408/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Barbara Tozier and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
