They were the best men to\n    be found for that first, all-important flight to the Moon--the\n    pioneer manned rocket that would give either the East or the West\n    control over the Earth.\n\n    Yet when the race started, Adam Crag found that he had a saboteur\n    among his crew ... a traitor! Such a man could give the Reds\n    possession of Luna, and thereby dominate the world it circled.\n\n    Any one of the other three could be the hidden enemy, and if he\n    didn't discover the agent soon--even while they were roaring on\n    rocket jets through outer space--then Adam Crag, his expedition, and\n    his country would be destroyed!\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nOne of the rockets was silver; three were ashen gray. Each nested in a\ndifferent spot on the great Western Desert. All were long, tapered,\nsisters except for color. In a way they represented the first, and last,\nof an era, with exotic propellants, a high mass ratio and three-stage\ndesign. Yet they were not quite alike. One of the sisters had within her\nthe artifacts the human kind needed for life--a space cabin high in the\nnose. The remaining sisters were drones, beasts of burden, but beasts\nwhich carried scant payloads considering their bulk.\n\nOne thing they had in common--destination. They rested on their launch\npads, with scaffolds almost cleared, heads high and proud. Soon they\nwould flash skyward, one by one, seeking a relatively small haven on a\nstrange bleak world. The world was the moon; the bleak place was called\nArzachel, a crater--stark, alien, with tall cliffs brooding over an ashy\nplain.\n\nOut on the West Coast a successor to the sisters was shaping up--a great\nship of a new age, with nuclear drive and a single stage. But the\nsisters could not wait for their successor. Time was running out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe room was like a prison--at least to Adam Crag. It was a square with\na narrow bunk, a battered desk, two straight-back chairs and little\nelse. Its one small window overlooked the myriad quonsets and buildings\nof Burning Sands Base from the second floor of a nearly empty dormitory.\n\nThere was a sentry at the front of the building, another at the rear.\nSilent alert men who never spoke to Crag--seldom acknowledged his\nmovements to and from the building--yet never let a stranger approach\nthe weathered dorm without sharp challenge. Night and day they were\nthere. From his window he could see the distant launch site and, by\nnight, the batteries of floodlights illumining the metal monster on the\npad. But now he wasn't thinking of the rocket. He was fretting; fuming\nbecause of a call from Colonel Michael Gotch.\n\n\"Don't stir from the room,\" Gotch had crisply ordered on the phone. He\nhad hung up without explanation. That had been two hours before.\n\nCrag had finished dressing--he had a date--idly wondering what was in\nthe Colonel's mind. The fretting had only set in when, after more than\nan hour, Gotch had failed to show. Greg's liberty had been restricted to\none night a month. One measly night, he thought. Now he was wasting it,\ntossing away the precious hours. Waiting. Waiting for what?\n\n\"I'm a slave,\" he told himself viciously; \"slave to a damned bird\ncolonel.\" His date wouldn't wait--wasn't the waiting kind. But he\ncouldn't leave.\n\nHe stopped pacing long enough to look at himself in the cracked mirror\nabove his desk. The face that stared back was lean, hard, unlined--skin\nthat told of wind and sun, not brown nor bronze but more of a mahogany\nred. Just now the face was frowning. The eyes were wide-spaced, hazel,\nthe nose arrogant and hawkish. A thin white scar ran over one cheek\nending.\n\nHis mind registered movement behind him. He swiveled around, flexing his\nbody, balanced on his toes, then relaxed, slightly mortified.\n\nGotch--Colonel Michael Gotch--stood just inside the door eyeing him\ntolerantly. A flush crept over Crag's face. Damn Gotch and his velvet\nfeet, he thought. But he kept the thought concealed.\n\nThe expression on Gotch's face was replaced by a wooden mask. He studied\nthe lean man by the mirror for a moment, then flipped his cap on the bed\nand sat down without switching his eyes.\n\nHe said succinctly. \"You're it.\"\n\n\"I've got it?\" Crag gave an audible sigh of relief. Gotch nodded without\nspeaking.\n\n\"What about Temple?\"\n\n\"Killed last night--flattened by a truck that came over the center-line.\nOn an almost deserted highway just outside the base,\" Gotch added. He\nspoke casually but his eyes were not casual. They were unfathomable\nblack pools. Opaque and hard. Crag wrinkled his brow inquiringly.\n\n\"Accident?\"\n\n\"You know better than that. The truck was hot, a semi with bum plates,\nand no driver when the cops got there.\" His voice turned harsh. \"No ...\nit was no accident.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Crag said quietly. He hadn't known Temple personally. He\nhad been just a name--a whispered name. One of three names, to be exact:\nRomer, Temple, Crag. Each had been hand-picked as possible pilots of the\nAztec, a modified missile being rushed to completion in a last ditch\neffort to beat the Eastern World in the race for the moon. They had been\nseparately indoctrinated, tested, trained; each had virtually lived in\none of the scale-size simulators of the Aztec's space cabin, and had\nbeen rigorously schooled for the operation secretly referred to as \"Step\nOne.\" But they had been kept carefully apart. There had been a time when\nno one--unless it were the grim-faced Gotch--knew which of the three was\nfirst choice.\n\nRomer had died first--killed as a bystander in a brawl. So the police\nsaid. Crag had suspected differently. Now Temple. The choice, after all,\nhad not been the swarthy Colonel's to make. Somehow the knowledge\npleased him. Gotch interrupted his thoughts.\n\n\"Things are happening. The chips are down. Time has run out, Adam.\"\nWhile he clipped the words out he weighed Crag, as if seeking some clue\nto his thoughts. His face said that everything now depended upon the\nlean man with the hairline scar across his cheek. His eyes momentarily\nwondered if the lean man could perform what man never before had done.\nBut his lips didn't voice the doubt. After a moment he said:\n\n\"We know the East is behind us in developing an atomic spaceship. Quite\na bit behind. We picked up a lot from some of our atomic sub work--that\nand our big missiles. But maybe the knowledge made us lax.\" He added\nstridently:\n\n\"Now ... they're ready to launch.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Now!\"\n\n\"I didn't think they were that close.\"\n\n\"Intelligence tells us they've modified a couple of T-3's--the big ICBM\nmodel. We just got a line on it ... almost too late.\" Gotch smiled\nbleakly. \"So we've jumped our schedule, at great risk. It's your baby,\"\nhe added.\n\nCrag said simply; \"I'm glad of the chance.\"\n\n\"You should be. You've hung around long enough,\" Gotch said dryly. His\neyes probed Crag. \"I only hope you've learned enough ... are ready.\"\n\n\"Plenty ready,\" snapped Crag.\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\nGotch got to his feet, a square fiftyish man with cropped iron-gray\nhair, thick shoulders and weather-roughened skin. Clearly he wasn't a\ndesk colonel.\n\n\"You've got a job, Adam.\" His voice was unexpectedly soft but he\ncontinued to weigh Crag for a long moment before he picked up his cap\nand turned toward the door.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said. He paused, listening for a moment before he opened it,\nthen slipped quietly into the hall, closing the door carefully behind\nhim.\n\nHe's like a cat, Crag thought for the thousandth time, watching the\nclosed door. He was a man who seemed forever listening; a heavy hulking\nman who walked on velvet feet; a man with opaque eyes who saw everything\nand told nothing. Gotch would return.\n\nDespite the fact the grizzled Colonel had been his mentor for over a\nyear he felt he hardly knew the man. He was high up in the missile\nprogram--missile security, Crag had supposed--yet he seemed to hold\npower far greater than that of a security officer. He seemed, in fact,\nto have full charge of the Aztec project--Step One--even though Dr.\nKenneth Walmsbelt was its official director. The difference was, the\nnation knew Walmsbelt. He talked with congressmen, pleaded for money,\ncarried his program to the newspapers and was a familiar figure on the\ncountry's TV screens. He was the leading exponent of the\nspace-can't-wait philosophy. But few people knew Gotch; and fewer yet\nhis connections. He was capable, competent, and to Crag's way of\nthinking, a tough monkey, which pretty well summarized his knowledge of\nthe man.\n\nHe felt the elation welling inside him, growing until it was almost a\npainful pleasure. It had been born of months and months of hope, over a\nyear during which he had scarcely dared hope. Now, because a man had\ndied....\n\nHe sat looking at the ceiling, thinking, trying to still the inner\ntumult. Only outwardly was he calm. He heard footsteps returning. Gotch\nopened the door and entered, followed by a second man. Crag started\ninvoluntarily, half-rising from his chair.\n\nHe was looking at himself!\n\n\"Crag, meet Adam Crag.\" The Colonel's voice and face were\nexpressionless. Crag extended his hand, feeling a little silly.\n\n\"Glad to know you.\"\n\nThe newcomer acknowledged the introduction with a grin--the same kind of\nlopsided grin the real Crag wore. More startling was the selfsame\nhairline scar traversing his cheek; the same touch of cockiness in the\nset of his face.\n\nGotch said, \"I just wanted you to get a good look at yourself. Crag\nhere\"--he motioned his hand toward the newcomer--\"is your official\ndouble. What were you planning for tonight, your last night on earth?\"\n\n\"I have a date with Ann. Or had,\" he added sourly. He twisted his head\ntoward Gotch as the Colonel's words sunk home. \"Last night?\"\n\nGotch disregarded the question. \"For what?\"\n\n\"Supper and dancing at the Blue Door.\"\n\n\"Then?\"\n\n\"Take her home, if it's any of your damned business,\" snapped Crag. \"I\nwasn't planning on staying, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"I know ... I know, we have you on a chart,\" Gotch said amiably. \"We\nknow every move you've made since you wet your first diapers. Like that\ncurvy little brunette secretary out in San Diego, or that blonde night\nclub warbler you were rushing in Las Vegas.\" Crag flushed. The Colonel\neyed him tolerantly.\n\n\"And plenty more,\" he added. He glanced at Crag's double. \"I'm sure your\ntwin will be happy to fill in for you tonight.\"\n\n\"Like hell he will,\" gritted Crag. The room was quiet for a moment.\n\n\"As I said, he'll fill in for you.\"\n\nCrag grinned crookedly. \"Ann won't go for it. She's used to the real\narticle.\"\n\n\"We're not giving her a chance to snafu the works,\" Gotch said grimly.\n\"She's in protective custody. We have a double for her, too.\"\n\n\"Mind explaining?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Let's face the facts and admit both Romer and Temple were\nmurdered. That leaves only you. The enemy isn't about to let us get the\nAztec into space. You're the only pilot left who's been trained for the\nbig jump--the only man with the specialized know-how. That's why you're\non someone's list. Perhaps, even, someone here at the Base ... or on the\nhighway ... or in town. I don't know when or how but I do know this:\nYou're a marked monkey.\"\n\nGotch added flatly: \"I don't propose to let you get murdered.\"\n\n\"How about him?\" Crag nodded toward his double. The man smiled faintly.\n\n\"That's what he's paid for,\" Gotch said unfeelingly. His lips curled\nsardonically. \"All the heroes aren't in space.\"\n\nCrag flushed. Gotch had a way of making him uncomfortable as no other\nman ever had. The gentle needle. But it was true. The Aztec was his\nbaby. Gotch's role was to see that he lived long enough to get it into\nspace. The rest was up to him. Something about the situation struck him\nas humorous. He looked at his double with a wry grin.\n\n\"Home and to bed early,\" he cautioned. \"Don't forget you've got my\nreputation to uphold.\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" his double said amiably.\n\n\"Okay, let's get down to business,\" Gotch growled. \"I've got a little to\nsay.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLong after they left Crag stood at the small window, looking out over\nthe desert. Somewhere out there was the Aztec, a silver arrow crouched\nin its cradle, its nose pointed toward the stars. He drew the picture in\nhis mind. She stood on her tail fins; a six-story-tall needle braced by\nmetal catwalks and guard rails; a cousin twice-removed to the great\nnuclear weapons which guarded Fortress America. He had seen her at\nnight, under the batteries of floor lights, agleam with a milky\nradiance; a virgin looking skyward, which, in fact, she was. Midway\nalong her length her diameter tapered abruptly, tapered again beyond the\nthree-quarters point. Her nose looked slender compared with her body,\nyet it contained a space cabin with all the panoply needed to sustain\nlife beyond the atmosphere.\n\nHis thoughts were reverent, if not loving. Save for occasional too-brief\nintervals with Ann, the ship had dominated his life for over a year. He\nknew her more intimately, he thought, than a long-married man knows his\nwife.\n\nHe had never ceased to marvel at the Aztec's complexity. Everything\nabout the rocket spoke of the future. She was clearly designed to\nperform in a time not yet come, at a place not yet known. She would fly,\nwatching the stars, continuously measuring the angle between them,\ncomputing her way through the abyss of space. Like a woman she would\nunderstand the deep currents within her, the introspective sensing of\nevery force which had an effect upon her life. She would measure\ngravitation, acceleration and angular velocity with infinite precision.\nShe would count these as units of time, perform complex mathematical\nequations, translate them into course data, and find her way unerringly\nacross the purple-black night which separated her from her assignation\nwith destiny. She would move with the certainty of a woman fleeing to\nher lover. Yes, he thought, he would put his life in the lady's hands.\nHe would ride with her on swift wings. But he would be her master.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis mood changed. He turned from the window thinking it was a hell of a\nway to spend his last night. Last night on earth, he corrected wryly. He\ncouldn't leave the room, couldn't budge, didn't know where Ann was. No\ntelephone. He went to bed wondering how he'd ever let himself get\nsnookered into the deal. Here he was, young, with a zest for life and a\nstacked-up gal on the string. And what was he doing about it? Going to\nthe moon, that's what. Going to some damned hell-hole called Arzachel,\nall because a smooth bird colonel had pitched him a few soft words.\nSucker!\n\nHis lips twisted in a crooked grin. Gotch had seduced him by describing\nhis mission as an \"out-of-this-world opportunity.\" Those had been\nGotch's words. Well, that was Arzachel. And pretty quick it would be\nAdam Crag. Out-of-this-world Crag. Just now the thought wasn't so\nappealing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSleep didn't come easy. At Gotch's orders he had turned in early, at the\nunheard hour of seven. Getting to sleep was another matter. It's\nstrange, he thought, he didn't have any of the feelings Doc Weldon, the\npsychiatrist, had warned him of. He wasn't nervous, wasn't afraid. Yet\nbefore another sun had set he'd be driving the Aztec up from earth, into\nthe loneliness of space, to a bleak crater named Arzachel. He would face\nthe dangers of intense cosmic radiation, chance meteor swarms, and human\nerrors in calculation which could spell disaster. It would be the first\nstep in the world race for control of the Solar System--a crucial race\nwith the small nations of the world watching for the winner. Watching\nand waiting to see which way to lean.\n\nHe was already cut off from mankind, imprisoned in a small room with\nthe momentous zero hour drawing steadily nearer. Strange, he thought,\nthere had been a time when his career had seemed ended, washed up,\nfinished, the magic of the stratosphere behind him for good. Sure, he'd\nresigned from the Air Force at his own free will, even if his C. O. had\nmade the pointed suggestion. Because he hadn't blindly followed orders.\nBecause he'd believed in making his own decisions when the chips were\ndown. \"Lack of _esprit de corps_,\" his C. O. had termed it.\n\nHe'd been surprised that night--it was over a year ago now--that Colonel\nGotch had contacted him. (Just when he was wondering where he might get\na job. He hadn't liked the prosaic prospects of pushing passengers\naround the country in some jet job.) Sure, he'd jumped at the offer. But\nthe question had never left his mind. _Why had Gotch selected him?_ The\nAztec, a silver needle plunging through space followed by her drones,\nall in his tender care. He was planning the step-by-step procedure of\ntake-off when sleep came.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nCrag woke with a start, sensing he was not alone. The sound came\nagain--a key being fitted into a lock. He started from bed as the door\nswung open.\n\n\"Easy. It's me--Gotch.\" Crag relaxed. A square solid figure took form.\n\n\"Don't turn on the light.\"\n\n\"Okay. What gives?\"\n\n\"One moment.\" Gotch turned back toward the door and beckoned. Another\nfigure glided into the room--a shadow in the dim light. Crag caught the\nglint of a uniform. Air Force officer, he thought.\n\nGotch said crisply; \"Out of bed.\"\n\nHe climbed out, standing alongside the bed in his shorts, wondering at\nthe Colonel's cloak-and-dagger approach.\n\n\"Okay, Major, it's your turn,\" Gotch said.\n\nThe newcomer--Crag saw he was a major--methodically stripped down to his\nshorts and got into bed without a word. Crag grinned, wondering how the\nMajor liked his part in Step One. It was scarcely a lead role.\n\nGotch cut into his thoughts. \"Get dressed.\" He indicated the Major's\nuniform. Crag donned the garments silently. When he had finished the\nColonel walked around him in the dark, studying him from all angles.\n\n\"Seems to fit very well,\" he said finally. \"All right, let's go.\"\n\nCrag followed him from the room wondering what the unknown Major must be\nthinking. He wanted to ask about his double but refrained. Long ago he\nhad learned there was a time to talk, and a time to keep quiet. This was\nthe quiet time. At the outer door four soldiers sprang from the darkness\nand boxed them in. A chauffeur jumped from a waiting car and opened the\nrear door. At the last moment Crag stepped aside and made a mock bow.\n\n\"After you, Colonel.\" His voice held a touch of sarcasm.\n\nGotch grunted and climbed into the rear seat and he followed. The\nchauffeur blinked his lights twice before starting the engine. Somewhere\nahead a car pulled away from the curb. They followed, leaving the four\nsoldiers behind. Crag twisted his body and looked curiously out the rear\nwindow. Another car dogged their wake. Precautions, always precautions,\nhe thought. Gotch had entered with an Air Force officer and had\nostensibly left with one; ergo, it must be the same officer. He\nchuckled, thinking he had more doubles than a movie star.\n\nThey sped through the night with the escorts fore and aft. Gotch was a\nsilent hulking form on the seat beside him. It's his zero hour, too,\nCrag thought. The Colonel had tossed the dice. Now he was waiting for\ntheir fall, with his career in the pot. After a while Gotch said\nconversationally:\n\n\"You'll report in at Albrook, Major. I imagine you'll be getting in a\nbit of flying from here on out.\"\n\nTalking for the chauffeur's benefit, Crag thought. Good Lord, did every\nmove have to be cloak and dagger? Aloud he said:\n\n\"Be good to get back in the air again. Perhaps anti-sub patrol, eh?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\nThey fell silent again. The car skimmed west on Highway 80, leaving the\nsilver rocket farther behind with every mile. Where to and what next? He\ngave up trying to figure the Colonel's strategy. One thing he was sure\nof. The hard-faced man next to him knew exactly what he was doing. If it\nwas secret agent stuff, then that's the way it had to be played.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned back and thought of the task ahead--the rocket he had lived\nwith for over a year. Now the marriage would be consummated. Every\ndetail of the Aztec was vivid in his mind. Like the three great motors\ntucked triangularly between her tail fins, each a tank equipped with a\nflaring nozzle to feed in hot gases under pressure. He pictured the fuel\ntanks just forward of the engines; the way the fuels were mixed,\nvaporized, forced into the fireports where they would ignite and react\nexplosively, generating the enormous volumes of flaming hot gas to drive\nout through the jet tubes and provide the tremendous thrust needed to\nboost her into the skies. Between the engines and fuel tanks was a maze\nof machinery--fuel lines, speed controllers, electric motors.\n\nHe let his mind rove over the rocket thinking that before many hours\nhad passed he would need every morsel of the knowledge he had so\ncarefully gathered. Midway where the hull tapered was a joint, the\nseparation point between the first and second stages. The second stage\nhad one engine fed by two tanks. The exterior of the second stage was\nsmooth, finless, for it was designed to operate at the fringe of space\nwhere the air molecules were widely spaced; but it could be steered by\nsmall deflectors mounted in its blast stream.\n\nThe third stage was little more than a space cabin riding between the\ntapered nose cone and a single relatively low-thrust engine. Between the\nengine and tanks was a maze of turbines, pumps, meters, motors, wires. A\ngenerator provided electricity for the ship's electric and electronic\nequipment; this in turn was spun by a turbine driven by the explosive\ndecomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Forward of this was the Brain, a\ncomplex guidance mechanism which monitored engine performance, kept\ntrack of speed, computed course. All that was needed was the human hand.\nHis hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey traveled several hours with only occasional words, purring across\nthe flat sandy wastes at a steady seventy. The cars boxing them in kept\nat a steady distance.\n\nCrag watched the yellow headlights sweep across the sage lining the\nhighway, giving an odd illusion of movement. Light and shadow danced in\neerie patterns. The chauffeur turned onto a two-lane road heading north.\nAlpine Base, Crag thought. He had been stationed there several years\nbefore. Now it was reputed to be the launch site of one of the three\ndrones slated to cross the gulfs of space. The chauffeur drove past a\nhousing area and turned in the direction he knew the strip to be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere in the darkness ahead a drone brooded on its pad, one of the\nchildren of the silver missile they'd left behind. But why the drone?\nThe question bothered him. They were stopped several times in the next\nhalf mile. Each time Gotch gave his name and rank and extended his\ncredentials. Each time they were waved on by silent sharp-eyed sentries,\nbut only after an exacting scrutiny. Crag was groping for answers when\nthe chauffeur pulled to one side of the road and stopped. He leaped out\nand opened the rear door, standing silently to one side. When they\nemerged, he got back into the car and drove away. No word had been\nspoken. Figures moved toward them, coming out of the blackness.\n\n\"Stand where you are and be recognized.\" The figures took\nshape--soldiers with leveled rifles. They stood very still until one\nwearing a captain's bars approached, flashing a light in their faces.\n\n\"Identity?\"\n\nCrag's companion extended his credentials.\n\n\"Colonel Michael Gotch,\" he monotoned. The Captain turned the light on\nGotch's face to compare it with the picture on the identification card.\nHe paid scant attention to Crag. Finally he looked up.\n\n\"Proceed, Sir.\" It was evident the Colonel's guest was very much\nexpected.\n\nGotch struck off through the darkness with Crag at his heels. The stars\nshone with icy brilliance. Overhead Antares stared down from its lair in\nScorpio, blinking with fearful venom. The smell of sage filled the air,\nand some sweet elusive odor Crag couldn't identify. A warmth stole\nupward as the furnace of the desert gave up its stored heat. He strained\nhis eyes into the darkness; stars, the black desert ... and the hulking\nform of Gotch, moving with certain steps.\n\nHe saw the rocket with startling suddenness--a great black silhouette\nblotting out a segment of the stars. It stood gigantic, towering,\ngraceful, a taper-nosed monster crouched to spring, its finned haunches\nsquatted against the launch pad.\n\nThey were stopped, challenged, allowed to proceed. Crag pondered the\nreason for their visit to the drone. Gotch, he knew, had a good reason\nfor every move he made. They drew nearer and he saw that most of the\ncatwalks, guardrails and metal supports had been removed--a certain sign\nthat the giant before them was near its zero hour.\n\nAnother sentry gave challenge at the base of the behemoth. Crag whistled\nto himself. This one wore the silver leaf of a lieutenant colonel! The\nritual of identification was exacting before the sentry moved aside. A\nladder zigzagged upward through what skeletal framework still remained.\nCrag lifted his eyes. It terminated high up, near the nose.\n\nThis was the Aztec! The real Aztec! The truth came in a rush. The huge\nsilver ship at Burning Sands, which bore the name Aztec, was merely a\nfake, a subterfuge, a pawn in the complex game of agents and\ncounter-agents. He knew he was right.\n\n\"After you,\" Gotch said. He indicated the ladder and stepped aside.\n\nCrag started up. He paused at the third platform. The floor of the\ndesert was a sea of darkness. Off in the distance the lights of Alpine\nBase gleamed, stark against the night. Gotch reached his level and laid\na restraining hand on his arm.\n\nCrag turned and waited. The Colonel's massive form was a black shadow\ninterposed between him and the lights of Alpine Base.\n\n\"This is the Aztec,\" he said simply.\n\n\"So I guessed. And the silver job at Burning Sands?\"\n\n\"Drone Able,\" Gotch explained. \"The deception was necessary--a part of\nthe cat and mouse game we've been playing the last couple of decades. We\ncouldn't take a single chance.\" Crag remained silent. The Colonel turned\ntoward the lights of the Base. He had become quiet, reflective. When he\nspoke, his voice was soft, almost like a man talking to himself.\n\n\"Out there are hundreds of men who have given a large part of their\nlives to the dream of space flight. Now we are at the eve of making that\ndream live. If we gain the moon, we gain the planets. That's the destiny\nof Man. The Aztec is the first step.\" He turned back and faced Crag.\n\n\"This is but one base. There are many others. Beyond them are the\nfactories, laboratories, colleges, scientists and engineers, right down\nto Joe the Riveter. Every one of them has had a part in the dream.\nYou're another part, Adam, but you happen to have the lead role.\" He\nswiveled around and looked silently at the distant lights. The moment\nwas solemn. A slight shiver ran through Crag's body.\n\n\"You know and I know that the Aztec is a development from the ICBM's\nguarding Fortress America. You also know, or have heard, that out in San\nDiego the first atom-powered spaceship is nearing completion.\" He looked\nsharply at Crag.\n\n\"I've heard,\" Crag said noncommittally.\n\nGotch eyed him steadily. \"That's the point. So have others. Our space\nprogram is no secret. But we've suspected--feared--that the first stab\nat deep space would be made before the atom job was completed. Not\nsatellites but deep space rockets. That's why the Aztec was pushed\nthrough so fast.\" He fell silent. Crag waited.\n\n\"Well, the worst has happened. The enemy is ready to launch--may have\nlaunched this very night. That's how close it is. Fortunately our gamble\nwith the Aztec is paying off. We're ready, too, Adam.\n\n\"We're going to get that moon. Get it now!\" He reached into a pocket and\nextracted his pipe, then thought better of lighting it. Crag waited. The\nColonel was in a rare introspective mood, a quiet moment in which he\nmentally tied together and weighed his Nation's prospects in the\nfrightening days ahead. Finally he spoke:\n\n\"We put a rocket around the moon, Adam.\" He smiled faintly, noting\nCrag's involuntary start of surprise. \"Naturally it was fully\ninstrumented. There's uranium there--one big load located in the most\ninaccessible spot imaginable.\"\n\n\"Arzachel,\" Crag said simply.\n\n\"The south side of Arzachel, to be exact. That's why we didn't pick a\nsoft touch like Mare Imbrium, in case you've wondered.\"\n\n\"I've wondered.\"\n\n\"Adam,\" the Colonel hesitated a long moment, \"does the name Pickering\nmean anything to you?\"\n\n\"Ken Pickering who--\"\n\n\"What have you heard?\" snapped Gotch. His eyes became sharp drills.\n\nCrag spoke slowly: \"Nothing ... for a long time. He just seemed to drop\nout of sight after he broke the altitude record in the X-34.\" He looked\nup questioningly.\n\n\"Frankly, I've always wondered why he hadn't been selected for this job.\nI thought he was a better pilot than I am,\" he added almost humbly.\n\nGotch said bluntly: \"You're right. He is better.\" He smiled tolerantly.\n\"We picked our men for particular jobs,\" he said finally. \"Pickering ...\nwe hope ... will be in orbit before the Aztec blasts off.\"\n\n\"Satelloid?\"\n\n\"The first true satelloid,\" the Colonel agreed. \"One that can ride the\nfringes of space around the earth. A satelloid with fantastic altitude\nand speed. I'm telling you this because he'll be a link in Step One, a\ncommunication and observation link. He won't be up long, of course, but\nlong enough--we hope.\"\n\nSilence fell between them. Crag looked past the Colonel's shoulder. All\nat once the lights of Alpine Base seemed warm and near, almost personal.\nGotch lifted his eyes skyward, symbolic of his dreams. The light of\ndistant stars reflected off his brow.\n\n\"We don't know whether the Aztec can make it,\" he said humbly. \"We\ndon't know whether our space-lift system will work, whether the drones\ncan be monitored down to such a precise point on the moon, or the\ndangers of meteorite bombardment. We don't know whether our safeguards\nfor human life are adequate. We don't know whether the opposition can\nstop us....\n\n\"We don't know lots of things, Adam. All we know is that we need the\nmoon. It's a matter of survival of Western Man, his culture, his way of\nlife, his political integrity. We need the moon to conquer the\nplanets ... and some day the stars.\"\n\nHis voice became a harsh clang.\n\n\"So does the enemy. That's why we have to establish a proprietory\nownership, a claim that the U.N. will recognize. The little nations\nrepresent the balance of power, Adam. But they sway with the political\nwinds. They are the reeds of power politics ... swaying between the\nSputniks and Explorers, riding with the ebb and flow of power ... always\ntrying to anticipate the ultimate winner. Right now they're watching to\nsee where that power lies. The nation that wins the moon will tilt the\nbalance in its favor. At a critical time, I might add. That's why we\nhave to protect ourselves every inch of the way.\"\n\nHe tapped his cold pipe moodily against his hand. \"We won't be here to\nsee the end results, of course. That won't be in our time. But we're the\nstarters. The Aztec is the pioneer ship. And in the future our economy\ncan use that load of uranium up there.\"\n\nHe smiled faintly at Crag. \"When you step through the hatch you've left\nearth, perhaps for all time. That's your part in the plan. Step One is\nyour baby and I have confidence in you.\" He gripped Crag's arm warmly.\nIt was the closest he had ever come to showing his feelings toward the\nman he was sending into space.\n\n\"Come on, let's go.\"\n\nCrag started upward. Gotch followed more slowly, climbing like a man\nbearing a heavy weight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Aztec's crew, Max Prochaska, Gordon Nagel and Martin Larkwell, came\naboard the rocket in the last hour before take-off. Gotch escorted them\nup the ladder and introduced them to their new Commander.\n\nProchaska acknowledged the introduction with a cheerful smile.\n\n\"Glad to know you, Skipper.\" His thin warm face said he was glad to be\nthere.\n\nGordon Nagel gave a perfunctory handshake, taking in the space cabin\nwith quick ferret-like head movements.\n\nMartin Larkwell smiled genially, pumping Crag's hand. \"I've been looking\nforward to this.\"\n\nCrag said dryly. \"We all have.\" He acknowledged the introductions with\nthe distinct feeling that he already knew each member of his crew. It\nwas the odd feeling of meeting old acquaintances after long years of\nseparation. As part of his indoctrination he had studied the personnel\nrecords of the men he might be so dependent on. Now, seeing them in the\nflesh, was merely an act of giving life to those selfsame records. He\nstudied them with casual eyes while Gotch rambled toward an awkward\nfarewell.\n\nMax Prochaska, his electronics chief, was a slender man with sparse\nbrown hair, a thin acquiline nose and pointed jaw. His pale blue eyes,\nthin lips and alabaster skin gave him a delicate look--one belied by his\nrecord. His chief asset--if one was to believe the record--was that he\nwas a genius in electronics.\n\nGordon Nagel, too, was, thin-faced and pallid skinned. His black hair,\nnormally long and wavy, had been close-cropped. His eyes were small,\nshifting, agate-black, giving Crag the feeling that he was uneasy--an\nimpression he was to hold. His record had described him as nervous in\nmanner but his psychograph was smooth. He was an expert in oxygen\nsystems.\n\nMartin Larkwell, the mechanical maintenance and construction boss, in\nmany ways appeared the antithesis of his two companions. He was\nmoon-faced, dark, with short brown hair and a deceptively sleepy look.\nHis round body was well-muscled, his hands big and square. Crag thought\nof a sleek drowsy cat, until he saw his eyes. They were sparkling brown\npools, glittering, moving with some strange inner fire. They were the\neyes of a dreamer ... or a fanatic, he thought. In the cabin's soft\nlight they glowed, flickered. No, there was nothing sleepy about him, he\ndecided.\n\nAll of the men were short, light, in their early thirties. In contrast\nCrag, at 5' 10\" and 165 pounds, seemed a veritable giant. A small\nphysique, he knew, was almost an essential in space, where every ounce\nwas bought at tremendous added weight in fuel. His own weight had been a\nserious strike against him.\n\nColonel Gotch made one final trip to the space cabin. This time he\nbrought the _Moon Code Manual_ (stamped TOP SECRET), the crew personnel\nrecords (Crag wondered why) and a newly printed pamphlet titled \"Moon\nSurvival.\" Crag grinned when he saw it.\n\n\"Does it tell us how to get there, too?\"\n\n\"We'll write that chapter later,\" Gotch grunted. He shook each man's\nhand and gruffly wished them luck before turning abruptly toward the\nhatch. He started down the ladder. A moment later his head reappeared.\n\nHe looked sharply at Crag and said, \"By the way, that twosome at the\nBlue Door got it last night.\"\n\n\"You mean...?\"\n\n\"Burp gun. No finesse. Just sheer desperation. Well, I just wanted to\nlet you know we weren't altogether crazy.\"\n\n\"I didn't think you were.\"\n\nThe Colonel's lips wrinkled in a curious smile. \"No?\" He looked at Crag\nfor a long moment. \"Good luck.\" His head disappeared from view and Crag\nheard his footsteps descending the ladder.\n\nThen they were alone, four men alone. Crag turned toward his companions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nThe great red sun was just breaking over the desert horizon when Crag\ngot his last good look at earth. Its rays slanted upward, shadows fled\nfrom the sage; the obsidian sky with its strewn diamonds became slate\ngray and, in moments, a pale washed blue. Daybreak over the desert\nbecame a thunder of light. Tiny ants had removed the last of the metal\nframework encompassing the rocket. Other ants were visible making last\nminute cheeks.\n\nHe returned his attention to the space cabin. Despite long months of\ntraining in the cabin simulator--an exact replica of the Aztec\nquarters--he was appalled at the lack of outside vision. One narrow\nrectangular quartz window above the control panel, a circular port on\neach side bulkhead and one on the floor--he had to look between his\nknees to see through it when seated at the controls--provided the sole\nvisual access to the outside world. A single large radarscope, a radar\naltimeter and other electronic equipment provided analogs of the outside\nworld; the reconstruction of the exterior environment painted on the\nscopes by electromagnetic impulses.\n\nThe cabin was little more than a long flat-floored cylinder with most\nof the instrumentation in the nose section. With the rocket in launch\nposition, what normally was the rear wall formed the floor. The seats\nhad been swiveled out to operational position.\n\nNow they were seated, strapped down, waiting. It was, Crag thought, like\nsitting in a large automobile which had been balanced on its rear\nbumper. During launch and climb their backs would be horizontal to the\nearth's surface.\n\nHe was thankful they were not required to wear their heavy pressure\nsuits until well into the moon's gravisphere. Normally pressure suits\nand helmets were the order of the day. He was used to stratospheric\nflight where heavy pressure suits and helmets were standard equipment;\ngear to protect the fragile human form until the lower oxygen-rich\nregions of the air ocean could be reached in event of trouble. But the\nAztec was an all-or-nothing affair. There were no escape provisions, no\nejection seats, for ejection would be impossible at the rocket's speeds\nduring its critical climb through the atmosphere. Either everything went\naccording to the book or ... or else, he concluded grimly. But it had\none good aspect. Aside from the heavy safety harnessing, he would be\nfree of the intolerably clumsy suit until moonfall. If anything went\nwrong, well ...\n\nHe bit the thought off, feeling the tension building inside him. He had\nnever considered himself the hero type. He had prided himself that his\nability to handle hot planes was a reflection of his competence rather\nthan courage. Courage, to him, meant capable performance in the face of\nfear. He had never known fear in any type of aircraft, hence never\nbefore had courage been a requisite of his job. It was that simple to\nhim. His thorough knowledge of the Aztec's theoretical flight\ncharacteristics had given him extreme confidence, thus the feeling of\ntension was distracting. He held his hand out. It seemed steady enough.\n\nProchaska caught the gesture and said, \"I'm a little shaky myself.\"\n\nCrag grinned. \"They tell me the first thousand miles are the hardest.\"\n\n\"Amen. After that I won't worry.\"\n\nThe countdown had begun. Crag looked out the side port. Tiny figures\nwere withdrawing from the base of the rocket. The engine of a fuel truck\nsounded faintly, then died away. Everything seemed unhurried, routine.\nHe found himself admiring the men who went so matter-of-factly about the\njob of hurling a rocket into the gulfs between planets. Once, during his\nindoctrination, he had watched a Thor firing ... had seen the missile\nclimb into the sky, building up to orbital speed. Its launchers had been\nthe same sort of men--unhurried, methodical, checking the minutiae that\nwent into such an effort. Only this time there was a difference. The\nmissile contained men.\n\nOff to one side he saw the launch crew moving into an instrumented\ndugout. Colonel Gotch would be there, puffing on his pipe, his face\nexpressionless, watching the work of many years come to ... what?\n\nHe looked around the cabin for the hundredth time. Larkwell and Nagel\nwere strapped in their seats, backs horizontal to the floor, looking up\nat him. The tremendous forces of acceleration applied at right angles to\nthe spine--transverse g--was far more tolerable than in any other\nposition. Or so the space medicine men said. He hoped they were right,\nthat in this position the body could withstand the hell ahead. He gave a\nlast look at the two men behind him. Larkwell wore an owlish expression.\nHis teeth were clamped tight, cording his jaws. Nagel's face was intent,\nits lines rigid. It gave Crag the odd impression of an alabaster\nsculpture. Prochaska, who occupied the seat next to him facing the\ncontrol panels, was testing his safety belts.\n\nCrag gave him a quick sidelong glance. Prochaska's job was in many\nrespects as difficult as his own. Perhaps more so. The sallow-faced\nelectronics chief bore the responsibility of monitoring the\ndrones--shepherding, first Drone Able, then its sisters to\nfollow--across the vacuum gulfs and, finally, into Arzachel, a pinpoint\ncavity in the rocky wastelands of the moon. In addition, he was charged\nwith monitoring, repairing and installing all the communication and\nelectronic equipment, no small job in itself. Yes, a lot depended on the\nalmost fragile man sitting alongside him. He looked at his own\nharnessing, testing its fit.\n\nColonel Gotch came on the communicator. \"Pickering's in orbit,\" he said\nbriefly. \"No details yet.\"\n\nCrag sighed in relief. Somehow Pickering's success augured well for\ntheir own attempt. He gave a last check of the communication gear. The\nmain speaker was set just above the instrument panel, between him and\nProchaska. In addition, both he and the Chief--the title he had\nconferred on Prochaska as his special assistant--were supplied with\ninsert earphones and lip microphones for use during high noise\nspectrums, or when privacy was desired. Crag, as Commander, could limit\nall communications to his own personal headgear by merely flipping a\nswitch. Gotch had been the architect of that one. He was a man who liked\nprivate lines.\n\n\"Five minutes to zero, Commander.\"\n\nCommander! Crag liked that. He struggled against his harnessing to\nglance back over his shoulder. Nagel's body, scrunched deep into his\nbucket seat, seemed pitifully thin under the heavy harnessing. His face\nwas bloodless, taut. Crag momentarily wondered what strange course of\nevents had brought him to the rocket. He didn't look like Crag's picture\nof a spaceman. Not at all. But then, none of them looked like supermen.\nStill, courage wasn't a matter of looks, he told himself. It was a\nmatter of action.\n\nHe swiveled his head around farther. Larkwell reclined next to Nagel\nwith eyes closed. Only the fast rise and fall of his chest told of his\ninner tensions--that and the hawk-like grip of his fingers around the\narm rests. Worried, Crag thought. But we're all worried. He cast a\nsidelong glance at Prochaska. The man's face held enormous calm. He\nreached over and picked up the console mike, then sat for what seemed an\neternity before the countdown reached minus one minute. He plugged in\nhis ear-insert microphone.\n\n\"Thirty seconds....\" The voice over the speaker boomed. Prochaska\nsuddenly became busy checking his instruments. Jittery despite his\nseeming calm, Crag thought.\n\n\"Twenty seconds....\" He caught himself checking his controls, as if he\ncould gain some last moment's knowledge from the banks of levers and\ndials and knobs.\n\n\"Ten ... nine ... eight....\" He experimentally pulled at his harnessing,\nfeeling somewhat hypnotized by the magic of the numbers coming over the\ncommunicator.\n\n\"Three ... two....\"\n\nCrag said, \"Ready on one.\"\n\nHe punched a button. A muted roar drifted up from the stem. He listened\nfor a moment. Satisfied, he moved the cut-in switch. The roar increased,\nbecoming almost deafening in the cabin despite its soundproofing. He\ntested the radio and steering rockets and gave a last sidelong glance at\nProchaska. The Chief winked. The act made him feel better. I should be\nnervous, he thought, or just plain damned scared. But things were\nhappening too fast. He adjusted his lip mike and reached for the\ncontrols, studying his hand as he did so. Still steady. He stirred the\ncontrols a bit and the roar became hellish. He chewed his lip and took a\ndeep breath, exhaling slowly.\n\nHe said, \"Off to the moon.\"\n\nProchaska nodded. Crag moved the controls. The cabin seemed to bob,\nwobble, vibrate. A high hum came from somewhere. He glanced downward\nthrough the side port. The Aztec seemed to be hanging in mid-air just\nabove the desert floor. Off to one side he could see the concrete\ncontrols dugout. The tiny figures had vanished.\n\nHe thought: _Gotch is sweating it out now_. In the past rockets had\nburned on the pad ... blown up in mid-air ... plunged off course and had\nto be destroyed. The idea brought his head up with a snap. Was there a\nsafety officer down there with a finger on a button ... prepared to\ndestroy the Aztec if it wavered in flight?\n\nHe cut the thought off and moved the main power switch, bringing the\ncontrol full over. The ship bucked, and the desert dropped away with a\nsuddenness that brought a siege of nausea. He tightened his stomach\nmuscles like the space medicine doctors had instructed.\n\nThe first moment was bad. There was unbelievable thunder, a fraction of\na second when his brain seemed to blank, a quick surge of fear. Up ...\nup. The Aztec's rate of acceleration climbed sharply. At a prescribed\npoint in time the nose of the rocket moved slightly toward the east. It\nclimbed at an impossibly steep slant, rushing up from the earth. Crag\nswept his eyes over the banks of instruments, noted the positions of the\ncontrols, tried to follow what the faint voice in his earphone was\ntelling him. Dials with wavering needles ... knobs with blurry\nnumerals ... a cacophony of noise, light and movement--all this and\nmore was crowded into seconds.\n\nThe rocket hurtled upward, driven by the tidal kinetic energy generated\nby the combustion of high velocity exhaust, born in an inferno of\nthousands of degrees. Behind him giant thrust chambers hungrily consumed\nthe volatile fuel, spewing the high-pressure gases forth at more than\nnine thousand miles per hour. The crushing increased, driving him\nagainst the back of his seat. His heart began laboring ... became a\nsledge hammer inside his chest wall.\n\nHe lost all sense of motion. Only the almost unendurable weight crushing\nhis body downward mattered. He managed a glimpse of the desert through\nthe side port. It lay far below, its salient details erased. The roar of\nthe giant motors became muted. There was a singing in his ears, a high\nwhine he didn't like.\n\nThe Aztec began to tilt, falling off to the right.\n\nHe cast a quick glance at the engine instruments. A red light blinked.\nNumber three was delivering slightly less thrust than the others.\nSomewhere in the complex of machinery a mechanical sensing device\nreacted. Engines one and two were throttled back and the rocket\nstraightened. A second device shifted the mix on engine three, bringing\nthrust into balance. All three engines resumed full power.\n\n\"Twenty-five thousand feet,\" Prochaska chattered. His voice was tinny\nover the small insert earphone provided for communications, especially\nfor those first few hellish moments when the whole universe seemed\ncollapsed into one huge noise spectrum. Noise and pressure.\n\n\"Forty-five thousand....\"\n\nThey were moving up fast now--three g, four g, five g. Crag's body\nweight was equal to 680 pounds. The dense reaches of the\ntroposphere--the weather belt where storms are born--dropped below them.\nThey hurtled through the rarefied, bitterly cold and utterly calm\nstratosphere.\n\n\"Eighty thousand feet....\"\n\nCrag struggled to move his body. His hand was leaden on the controls, as\nif all life had been choked from it. A hot metal ball filled his chest.\nHe couldn't breathe. Panic ... until he remembered to breathe at the top\nof his lungs.\n\nAt eighteen miles a gale of wind drove west. Rudders on the Aztec\ncompensated, she leaned slightly into the blast, negating its drift. The\nwinds ceased ... rudders shifted ... the rocket slanted skyward.\nFaster ... faster.\n\nProchaska called off altitudes almost continuously, the chattering gone\nfrom his voice. Crag was still struggling against the pinning weight\nwhen it decreased, vanished. The firestream from the tail pipe gave a\nburst of smoke and died. _Brennschluss_--burnout.\n\nThe Aztec hurtled toward the cosmic-ray laden ionosphere, driven only by\nthe inertial forces generated in the now silent thrust chambers. The\nhard components of cosmic rays--fast mesons, high energy protons and\nneutrons--would rip through the ship. _If dogs and monkeys can take it,\nso can man._ That's what Gotch had said. He hoped Gotch was right.\nSomewhere, now, the first stage would fall away. It would follow them,\nat ever greater distances, until finally its trajectory would send it\nplunging homeward.\n\n\"Cut in.\" Prochaska's voice was a loud boom in the silence. A strident\nvoice from the communicator was trying to tell them they were right on\nthe button. Crag moved a second switch. The resultant acceleration drove\nhim against the back of his seat, violently expelling the air from his\nlungs. He fought against the increasing gravities, conscious of pressure\nand noise in his ears; pressure and noise mixed with fragments of voice.\nHis lips pulled tight against his teeth. The thudding was his heart. He\ntightened his stomach muscles, trying to ease the weight on his chest. A\nmighty hand was gripped around his lungs, squeezing out the air. But it\nwasn't as bad as the first time. They were piercing the thermosphere\nwhere the outside temperature gradient would zoom upward toward the\n2,000 degree mark.\n\nProchaska spoke matter-of-factly into his lip mike, \"Fifty miles.\"\n\nCrag marveled at his control ... his calm. No, he didn't have to worry\nabout the Chief. The little runt had it. Crag tried to grin. The effort\nwas a pain.\n\nThe Aztec gave a lurch, altering the direction of forces on their bodies\nagain as a servo control kicked the ship into the long shallow spiral of\nescape. It moved upward and more easterly, its nose slanted toward the\nstars, seeking its new course. Crag became momentarily dizzy. His vision\nblurred ... the instrument panel became a kaleidoscope of dancing,\nmerging patterns. Then it was past, all except the three g force nailing\nhim to the seat.\n\nHe spoke into the communicator. \"How we doing?\"\n\n\"Fine, Commander, just fine,\" Gotch rasped. \"The toughest part's over.\"\n\nOver like hell, Crag thought. A one-way rocket to the moon and he tells\nme the toughest part's over. Lord, I should work in a drugstore!\n\n\"Seventy-five miles and two hundred miles east,\" the Chief intoned. Crag\nmade a visual instrument check. Everything looked okay. No red lights.\nJust greens. Wonderful greens that meant everything was hunky-dory. He\nliked green. He wanted to see how Larkwell and Nagel were making out but\ncouldn't turn his head. It's rougher on them, he thought. They can't see\nthe instruments, can't hear the small voice from Alpine. They just have\nto sit and take it. Sit and feel the unearthly pressures and weights and\nhope everything's okay.\n\n\"Ninety-six miles ... speed 3.1 miles per second,\" Prochaska chanted a\nshort while later.\n\nIt's as easy as that, Crag thought. Years and years of planning and\ntraining; then you just step in and go. Not that they were there yet. He\nremembered the rockets that had burned ... exploded ... the drifting\nhulks that still orbited around the earth. No, it wasn't over yet. Not\nby a long shot.\n\nThe quiet came again. The earth, seen through the side port, seemed\ntremendously far away. It was a study in greens and yellow-browns and\nwhitish ragged areas where the eye was blocked by cloud formations.\nStraight out the sky was black, starry. Prochaska reached up and swung\nthe glare shield over the forward port. The sun, looked at even\nindirectly, was a blinding orb, intolerable to the unprotected eye.\nNight above ... day below. A sun that blazed without breaking the ebon\nskies. Strange, Crag mused. He had been prepared for this, prepared by\nlong hours of instruction. But now, confronted with a day that was\nnight, he could only wonder. For a moment he felt small, insignificant,\nand wondered at brazen man. Who dared come here? I dared, he thought. A\nfeeling of pride grew within him. I dared. The stars are mine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStage three was easy by comparison. It began with the muted roar of\nthrust chambers almost behind them, a noise spectrum almost solely\nconfined to the interior of the rocket. Outside there was no longer\nsufficient air molecules to convey even a whisper of sound. Nor was\nthere a pressure build-up. The stage three engine was designed for\nextremely low thrust extended over a correspondingly longer time. It\nwould drive them through the escape spiral--an orbital path around the\nearth during which time they would slowly increase both altitude and\nspeed.\n\nCrag's body felt light; not total weightlessness, but extremely light.\nHis instruments told him they were breaching the exosphere, where\nmolecular matter had almost ceased to exist. The atoms of the exosphere\nwere lonely, uncrowded, isolated particles. It was the top of the air\nocean where, heretofore, only monkeys, dogs and smaller test animals had\ngone. It was the realm of Sputniks ... Explorers ... Vanguards--all the\ntest rockets which had made the Aztec possible. They still sped their\nsilent orbits, borne on the space tides of velocity; eternal tombs of\ndogs and monkeys. And after monkey--man.\n\nThe communicator gave a burp. A voice came through the static. Drone\nAble was aloft. It had blasted off from its blasting pad at Burning\nSands just moments after the Aztec. Prochaska bent over the radarscope\nand fiddled with some knobs. The tube glowed and dimmed, then it was\nthere--a tiny pip.\n\nAlpine came in with more data. They watched its course. Somewhere far\nbelow them and hundreds of miles to the west human minds were guiding\nthe drone by telemeter control, vectoring it through space to meet the\nAztec. It was, Crag thought, applied mathematics. He marveled at the\nscience which enabled them to do it. One moment the drone was just a pip\non the scope, climbing up from the sere earth, riding a firestream to\nthe skies; the next it was tons of metal scorching through space,\ncutting into their flight path--a giant screaming up from its cradle.\n\nIt was Prochaska's turn to sweat. The job of taking it over was his. He\nbent over his instruments, ears tuned to the communicator fingers\nnervous on the drone controls. The drone hurtled toward them at a\nfrightening speed.\n\nCrag kept his fingers on the steering controls just in case, his mind\nfollowing the Chief's hands. They began moving more certainly. Prochaska\ntossed his head impatiently, bending lower over the instrument console.\nCrag strained against his harnessing to see out of the side port. The\ndrone was visible now, a silver shaft growing larger with appalling\nrapidity. A thin skein of vapor trailed from its trail, fluffing into\nnothingness.\n\n_If angle of closure remains constant, you're on collision course._ The\nwords from the Flying Safety Manual popped into his mind. He studied the\ndrone.\n\nAngle of closure was constant!\n\nCrag hesitated. Even a touch on the steering rockets could be bad. Very\nbad. The slightest change in course at their present speed would impose\ntremendous g forces on their bodies, perhaps greater than they could\nstand. He looked at the Chief and licked his lips. The man was intent on\nhis instruments, seemingly lost to the world. His fingers had ceased all\nrandom movement. Every motion had precise meaning. He was hooked onto\nDrone Able's steering rockets now, manipulating the controls with\nextreme precision. He was a concert pianist playing the strident music\nof space, an overture written in metal and flaming gas. Tiny corrections\noccurred in the Drone's flight path.\n\n\"Got her lined up,\" Prochaska announced without moving his eyes from the\nscope. He gradually narrowed the distance between the rockets until they\nwere hurtling through space on parallel courses scant miles apart. He\ngave a final check and looked at Crag. They simultaneously emitted big\nsighs.\n\n\"Had me worried for a moment,\" Crag confessed.\n\n\"Me, too.\" The Chief looked out of the side port \"Man, it looks like a\nbattle wagon.\"\n\nCrag squinted through the port. Drone Able was a silver bullet in space,\na twin of the Aztec except in color. A drone with view ports. He smiled\nthoughtfully. Every exterior of the drone had been planned to make it\nappear like a manned vehicle. Gotch was the architect of that bit of\ndeception, he thought. The Colonel hadn't missed a bet.\n\nHe looked at the earth. It was a behemoth in space; a huge curved\nsurface falling away in all directions; a mosaic of grays punctuated by\nswaths of blue-green tints and splotches of white where fleecy clouds\nrode the top of the troposphere. His momentary elation vanished,\nreplaced by an odd depression. The world was far away, retreating into\nthe cosmic mists. The aftermath, he thought. A chill presentiment crept\ninto his mind--a premonition of impending disaster.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThe communicator came to life with data on Pickering. The satelloid was\nmoving higher, faster than the Aztec, riding the rim of the exosphere\nwhere the atmosphere is indistinguishable from absolute space. Crag felt\nthankful he hadn't been tabbed for the job. The satelloid was a fragile\nthing compared to the Aztec--a moth compared to a hawk. It was a\nrelative handful of light metals and delicate electronic components, yet\nit moved at frightful speeds over the course the armchair astronauts had\ndubbed \"Sputnik Avenue.\" It was a piloted vehicle, a mite with small\nstubby wings to enable it to glide through the air ocean to safe\nsanctuary after orbiting the earth. Pickering would be crouched in its\nscant belly, a space hardly larger than his body, cramped in a pressure\nsuit that made movement all but impossible. His smallest misjudgment\nwould spell instant death. Crag marveled at Pickering's audacity.\nClearly he had the roughest mission. While he thought about it, he kept\none part of his mind centered on the communicator absorbing the data on\nthe satelloid's position and speed.\n\nThe Northern tip of Africa came up fast. The Dark Continent of history\nseen from the borders of space was a yellow-green splotch hemmed by\nblue. The satelloid was still beyond the Aztec's radar range but a data\nlink analog painted in the relationship between the two space vehicles.\nThe instrument's automatic grid measured the distance between them in\nhundreds of miles. Pickering, aloft before them, had fled into the east\nand already was beginning to overtake them from the west. The ships were\nseen on the analog as two pips, two mites aloft in the air ocean. Crag\nmarveled at the satelloid's tremendous speed. It was a ray of metal\nflashing along the fringes of space, a rapier coming out of the west.\n\nThe Middle East passed under them, receding, a mass of yellow-green and\noccasional smoke-blue splotches. The earth was a giant curvature, not\nyet an orb, passing into the shadow of night. It was a night of\nfantastic shortness, broken by daylight over the Pacific. The ocean was\nan incredible blue, blue-black he decided. The harsh sound of the\ncommunicator came to life. Someone wanted a confab with Crag. A private\nconfab. Prochaska wrinkled his brow questioningly. Crag switched to his\near insert phone and acknowledged.\n\n\"A moment,\" a voice said. He waited.\n\n\"Commander, we've bad news for you.\" It was Gotch's voice, a rasp coming\nover a great distance.\n\n\"The S-two reports a rocket being tracked by radar. ComSoPac's picked it\nup. It's on intercept course.\"\n\nCrag's thoughts raced. The S-two was the satelloid's code name. \"Any\nidea what kind?\"\n\n\"Probably a sub-launched missile--riding a beam right to you. Or the\ndrone,\" he added. He was silent for a second. \"Well, we sort of expected\nthis might happen, Commander. It's a tough complication.\"\n\nA helluva lot of good that does, Crag thought. What next? Another set of\npilots, more indoctrination, new rockets, another zero hour. Gotch would\nwin the moon if he had to use the whole Air Force. He said, \"Well, it's\nbeen a nice trip, so far.\"\n\n\"Get Prochaska on the scope.\"\n\n\"He's on and ... hold it.\" The Chief was making motions toward the\nscope. \"No, it's the satelloid. He's--\"\n\nGotch broke in with more data. Then it was there.\n\n\"He's got it,\" Crag announced. Gotch was silent. He watched the analog.\nAll three pips were visible. The satelloid was still above them, rushing\nin, fast. The interceptor was lower to the northwest, cutting into their\npath. He thought it was the Drone Able story all over again. Only this\ntime it wasn't a supply rocket. It was a warhead, a situation they\ncouldn't control.\n\n_Couldn't control? Or could they?_ He debated the question, then quickly\nbriefed Prochaska and cut him in on the com circuit.\n\n\"We can use Drone Able as an intercept,\" he told Gotch.\n\n\"No!\" The word came explosively.\n\nCrag snapped, \"Drone Able won't be a damn bit of good without the\nAztec.\"\n\n\"No, this is ground control, Commander.\" Gotch abruptly cut off. Crag\ncursed.\n\n\"Calling Step One.... Calling Step One. S-two calling Step One. Are you\nreceiving? Over.\" The voice came faint over the communicator, rising and\nfalling.\n\n\"Step One,\" Crag said, adjusting his lip mike. He acknowledged the code\ncall while his mind registered the fact it wasn't Alpine Base. There was\na burst of static. He waited a moment, puzzled.\n\n\"S-two calling....\"\n\nPickering! He had been slow in recognizing the satelloid's code call.\nThe voice faded--was lost. His thought raced. Pickering was up there in\nthe satelloid moving higher, faster than the Aztec, hurtling along the\nrim of space in a great circle around the earth. The stubby-winged\nrocket ship was a minute particle in infinity, yet it represented a part\nin the great adventure. It was the hand of Michael Gotch reaching toward\nthem. For the instant, the knowledge gave him a ray of hope--hope as\nquickly dashed. The S-two was just a high-speed observation and relay\nplatform; a manned vehicle traveling the communication orbit established\nby the Army's earlier Explorer missiles. He turned back to Prochaska and\nsketched in his plan of using Drone Able as an intercept.\n\n\"Could be.\" The Chief bit his lip reflectively. \"We could control her\nthrough her steering rockets, but we'd have to be plenty sharp. We'd\nonly get one crack.\"\n\n\"Chances are the intercept is working on a proximity fuse,\" Crag\nreasoned. \"All we'd have to do is work the drone into its flight path.\nWe could use our own steering rockets to give us a bigger margin of\nsafety.\"\n\n\"What would the loss of Able mean?\"\n\nCrag shrugged. \"I'm more concerned with what the loss of the Aztec would\nmean.\"\n\n\"Might work.\" The Chief looked sharply at him. \"What does Alpine say?\"\n\n\"They say nuts.\" Crag looked at the scope. The intercept was much\nnearer. So was the S-two. Pickering's probably coming in for an\neye-witness report, he thought sourly. Probably got an automatic camera\nso Gotch can watch the show. He looked quizzically at Prochaska. The\nChief wore a frozen mask. He got back on the communicator and repeated\nhis request. When he finished, there was a dead silence in the void.\n\nThe Colonel's answer was unprintable. He looked thoughtfully at\nProchaska. Last time he'd broken ground orders he'd been invited to\nleave the Air Force. But Gotch had taken him despite that. He glanced\nover his shoulder trying to formulate a plan. Larkwell was lying back in\nhis seat, eyes closed. Lucky dog, he thought. He doesn't know what he's\nin for. He twisted his head further. Nagel watched him with a narrow\nlook. He pushed the oxygen man from his mind and turned back to the\nanalog. The pip that was Pickering had moved a long way across the grid.\nThe altitude needle tied into the grid showed that the satelloid was\ndropping fast. The intercept was nearer, too. Much nearer. Prochaska\nwatched the scene on his radarscope.\n\n\"She's coming fast,\" he murmured. His face had paled.\n\n\"Too fast,\" Crag gritted. He got on the communicator and called Alpine.\nGotch came on immediately.\n\nCrag said defiantly. \"We're going to use Drone Able as an intercept.\nIt's the only chance.\"\n\n\"Commander, I ordered ground control.\" The Colonel's voice was icy,\nbiting.\n\n\"Ground has no control over this situation,\" Crag snapped angrily.\n\n\"I said ground control, Commander. That's final.\"\n\n\"I'm using Drone Able.\"\n\n\"Commander Crag, you'll wind up cleaning the heads at Alpine,\" Gotch\nraged. \"Don't move that Drone.\"\n\nFor a moment the situation struck him as humorous. Just now he'd like to\nbe guaranteed the chance to clear the heads at Alpine Base. It sounded\ngood--real good. There was another burst of static. Pickering's voice\ncame in--louder, clearer, a snap through the ether.\n\n\"Don't sacrifice the drone, Commander!\"\n\n\"Do you know a better way?\"\n\nPickering's voice dropped to a laconic drawl.\n\n\"Reckon so.\"\n\nCrag glanced at the analog and gave a visible start. The satelloid was\nlower, moving in faster along a course which would take it obliquely\nthrough the space path being traversed by the Aztec. If there was such a\nthing as a wake in space, that's where the satelloid would chop through,\ncutting down toward the intercept. He's using his power, he thought, the\nscant amount of fuel he would need for landing. But if he used it up....\n\nHe slashed the thought off and swung to the communicator.\n\n\"Step One to S-two ... Step One to S-two ...\"\n\n\"S-two.\" Pickering came in immediately.\n\nCrag barked, \"You can't--\"\n\n\"That's my job,\" Pickering cut in. \"You gotta get that bucket to the\nmoon.\" Crag looked thoughtfully at the communicator.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said finally. \"Thanks, fellow.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. The Air Force is always ready to serve,\" Pickering\nsaid. \"Adios.\" He cut off.\n\nCrag stared at the analog, biting his lip, feeling the emotion surge\ninside him. It grew to a tumult.\n\n\"Skipper!\" Prochaska's voice was startled. \"For God's sake ... look!\"\n\nCrag swung his eyes to the scope. The blip representing Pickering had\ncut their flight path, slicing obliquely through their wake. At its\ntremendous speed only the almost total absence of air molecules kept the\nsatelloid from turning into a blazing torch. Down ... down ... plunging\nto meet the death roaring up from the Pacific. They followed it\nsilently. A brief flare showed on the scope. They looked at the screen\nfor a long moment.\n\n\"He was a brave man,\" Prochaska said simply.\n\n\"A pile of guts.\" Crag got on the communicator. Gotch listened. When he\nhad finished, Gotch said:\n\n\"After this, Commander, follow ground orders. You damned near fouled up\nthe works. I don't want to see that happen again.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir, but I couldn't have expected that move.\"\n\n\"What do you think Pickering was up there for?\" Gotch asked softly. \"He\nknew what he was doing. That was his job. Just like the couple that got\nbumped at the Blue Door. It's tough, Commander, but some people have to\ndie. A lot have, already, and there'll be a lot more.\"\n\nHe added brusquely, \"You'll get your chance.\" The communicator was\nsilent for a moment. \"Well, carry on.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, Sir,\" Crag said. He glanced over his shoulder.\n\nLarkwell was leaning over in his seat, twisting his body to see out the\nside port. His face was filled with the wonder of space. Nagel didn't\nstir. His eyes were big saucers in his white, thin face. Crag half\nexpected to see his lips quiver, and wondered briefly at the courage it\nmust have taken for him to volunteer. He didn't seem at all like the\nhero type. Still, look at Napoleon. You could never tell what a man had\nuntil the chips were down. Well, the chips _were_ down. Nagel better\nhave it. He turned reflectively back to the forward port thinking that\nthe next two days would be humdrum. Nothing would ever seem tough again.\nNot after what they had just been through.\n\nProchaska fell into the routine of calling out altitude and speed. Crag\nlistened with one part of his mind occupied with Pickering's sacrifice.\nWould he have had the courage to drive the satelloid into the warhead?\nDid it take more guts to do that than to double for a man slated to be\nmurdered? He mulled the questions. Plainly, Step One was jammed with\nheroes.\n\n\"Altitude, 1,000 miles, speed, 22,300.\" Prochaska whispered the words,\nawe in his voice. They looked at each other wordlessly.\n\n\"We've made it,\" Crag exulted. \"We're on that old moon trajectory.\" The\nChiefs face reflected his wonder. Crag studied his instruments. Speed\nslightly over 22,300 miles per hour. The radar altimeter showed the\nAztec slightly more than one thousand miles above the earth's surface.\nHe hesitated, then cut off the third stage engine. The fuel gauge\nindicated a bare few gallons left. This small amount, he knew,\nrepresented error in the precise computations of escape. Well, the extra\nweight was negligible. At the same time, they couldn't afford added\nacceleration. He became aware that the last vestige of weight had\nvanished. He moved his hand. No effort. No effort at all. Space, he\nthought, the first successful manned space ship.\n\nElation swept him. He, Adam Crag, was in space. Not just the top of the\natmosphere but absolute space--the big vacuum that surrounded the world.\nThis had been the aim ... the dream ... the goal. And so quick!\n\nHe flicked his mind back. It seemed almost no time at all since the\nGermans had electrified the world with the V-2, a primitive rocket that\nscarcely reached seventy miles above the earth, creeping at a mere 3,000\nmiles per hour.\n\nThe Americans had strapped a second stage to the German prototype,\ncreating the two-stage V-2-Wac Corporal and sending it 250 miles into\nthe tall blue at speeds better than 5,000 miles per hour. It had been a\nbattle even then, he thought, remembering the dark day the Russians beat\nthe West with Sputnik I ... seemingly demolished it with Sputnik\nII--until the U. S. Army came through with Explorer I. That had been the\nreal beginning. IRBM's and ICBM's had been born. Missiles and\ncounter-missiles. Dogs, monkeys and mice had ridden the fringes of\nspace. But never man.\n\nA deep sense of satisfaction flooded him. The Aztec had been the first.\nThe Aztec under Commander Adam Crag. The full sense of the\naccomplishment was just beginning to strike him. We've beaten the enemy,\nhe thought. We've won. It had been a grim battle waged on a\ntechnological front; a battle between nations in which, ironically, each\nvictory by either side took mankind a step nearer emancipation from the\nworld. Man could look forward now, to a bright shiny path leading to the\nstars. This was the final step. The Big Step. The step that would tie\ntogether two worlds. In a few short days the Aztec would reach her\nlonely destination, Arzachel, a bleak spot in the universe. Adam Crag,\nthe Man in the Moon. He hoped. He turned toward the others, trying to\nwipe the smug look from his face.\n\nThe oddity of weightlessness was totally unlike anything he had expected\ndespite the fact its symptoms had been carefully explained during the\nindoctrination program. He was sitting in the pilot's seat, yet he\nwasn't. He felt no sense of pressure against the seat, or against\nanything else, for that matter. It was, he thought, like sitting on air,\nas light as a mote of dust drifting in a breeze. Sure, he'd experienced\nweightlessness before, when pushing a research stratojet through a\nhigh-speed trajectory to counter the pull of gravity, for example. But\nthose occasions had lasted only brief moments. He moved his hand\nexperimentally upward--a move that ended like the strike of a snake.\nYeah, it was going to take some doing to learn control of his movements.\nHe looked at Prochaska. The Chief was feeding data to Alpine Base. He\nfinished and grinned broadly at Crag. His eyes were elated.\n\n\"Sort of startling, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Amen,\" Crag agreed. \"I'm almost afraid to loosen my harnessing.\n\n\"Alpine says we're right on the button--schedule, course and speed.\nThere's a gal operator on now.\"\n\n\"That's good. That means we're back to routine.\" Crag loosened his\nharnesses and twisted around in his seat. Larkwell was moving his hands\nexperimentally. He saw Crag and grinned foolishly. Nagel looked ill. His\nface was pinched, bloodless, his eyes red-rimmed. He caught Crag's look\nand nodded, without expression.\n\n\"Pretty rough,\" Crag said sympathetically. His voice, in the new-born\nsilence, possessed a curious muffled effect. \"We're past the worst.\"\n\nNagel's lips twisted derisively. \"Yeah?\"\n\nThe querulous tone grated Crag and he turned back to the controls.\n_Every minor irritant will assume major proportions._ That's what Doc\nWeldon had warned. Well, damnit, he wouldn't let Nagel get him down.\nBesides, what was his gripe? They were all in the same boat. He turned\nto the instrument console, checking the myriad of dials, gauges and\nscopes. Everything seemed normal, if there was such a thing as normalcy\nin space. He said reflectively, speaking to no one in particular:\n\n\"Maybe I should have been more truthful with the Colonel before taking\non this damned job of moon pilot. There's something I didn't tell him.\"\n\n\"What?\" Prochaska's face was startled.\n\n\"I've never been to the moon before.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"Alpine wants a private confab,\" Prochaska said. His voice was ominous.\n\"Probably another stinker.\"\n\n\"Again?\" Crag plugged in his ear insert microphone thinking he wasn't\ngoing to like what he'd hear. Just when things had started looking\nsmooth too. He cut Prochaska out of the system and acknowledged.\n\n\"Crag?\" Gotch's voice was brittle, hard. He looked sideways at\nProchaska, who was studiously examining one of the instruments, trying\nto give him the privacy demanded. He shifted his head. Larkwell was\nstanding at the side port with his back toward him. Nagel lay back in\nhis seat, eyes closed.\n\nCrag answered softly. \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"More bad news,\" Gotch reported somberly. \"Burning Sands picked a\npackage out of Drone Able just before launch time. It's just been\nidentified.\"\n\n\"Check,\" he replied, trying to assimilate what Gotch was telling him.\n\nGotch stated flatly. \"It was a time bomb. Here's a description. Bomb was\npackaged in a flat black plastic case about one by four inches. Probably\nnot big enough to wreck the drone but big enough to destroy the\ncontrols. It was found tucked in the wiring of the main panel. Got\nthat?\"\n\n\"Check.\"\n\n\"The bomb squad hasn't come through with full details yet. If you find a\nmate, don't try to disarm it. Dump it, pronto!\"\n\n\"Can't. It'll stay with us.\"\n\n\"It's size indicates it wouldn't be fatal if it exploded outside the\nhull,\" Gotch rasped. \"It was designed to wreck controls. If you find\none, dump it. That's an order.\" The earphones were silent. Crag was\nswiveling toward Prochaska when they came to life again.\n\n\"One other thing.\" Gotch was silent for a moment. Crag pictured him\ncarefully framing his words. \"It means that the situation is worse than\nwe thought,\" he said finally.\n\n\"They haven't left anything to chance. If you have a bomb, it was\ncarried there after the final security check. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Crag answered thoughtfully. He sat for a moment, debating what\nto do. Prochaska didn't ask any questions. Gotch was telling him that\nthe Aztec might be mined. Wait, what else had he said? _The bomb was\ncarried there after the security check._ That spelled traitor. The Aztec\nhad been shaken down too often and too thoroughly for Intelligence to\nhave muffed. It would have to have been planted at the last moment. If\nthere was a bomb, he'd better keep quiet until Gotch's suspicions were\nproven false--or verified.\n\nHe turned toward Prochaska, keeping his voice low. \"Search the console\npanels--every inch of them.\"\n\nHe looked around. Nagel and Larkwell were back in their seats. Nagel\nseemed asleep, but Larkwell's face was speculative. Crag's eyes swept\nthe cabin. Spare oxygen tanks, packaged pressure suits, water vents,\nchemical commode, the algae chamber and spare chemicals to absorb carbon\ndioxide in case the algae system failed--these and more items filled\nevery wall, cupboard, occupied every cubic inch of space beyond the bare\nroom needed for human movement. Where was the most sensitive spot? The\ncontrols. He sighed and turned back to the panels.\n\nProchaska was methodically running his hands through the complex of\nwiring under the instrument panels. His face was a question, the face of\na man who didn't know what he was looking for. He decided not to tell\nhim ... yet. His earphones gave a burst of static followed by the\nColonel's hurried voice.\n\n\"Burning Sands reports packaged timed for 0815,\" he snapped. \"That's\neight minutes away. Get on the ball. If you've got one there, it's\nprobably a twin.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Crag acknowledged. \"Adios, we've got work to do.\" He swung\ntoward Nagel.\n\n\"Break out the pressure suits,\" he barked. \"Lend him a hand, Larkwell.\"\n\nNagel's eyes opened. \"Pressure suits?\"\n\n\"Check. We may need them in a couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Get to it,\" Crag rasped. \"It may be a matter of life or death.\" He\nturned. Prochaska was still examining the wiring. No time to search the\nrest of the cabin, he thought. It might be anywhere. It would have to be\nthe panels or nothing. Besides, that was the most logical place. He went\nto the Chief's assistance, searching the panels on his side of the\nboard, pushing his fingers gently between the maze of wiring. Nothing\nbelow the analog, the engine instruments, the radar altimeter. He\nglanced at the chronometer and began to sweat. The hands on the dial\nseemed to be racing. Prochaska finished his side of the console and\nlooked sideways at him. Better tell him, Crag thought.\n\nHe said calmly, \"Time bomb. Burning Sands says, if we have one, it may\nblow in--\" he glanced hurriedly at the chronometer--\"five minutes.\"\n\nProchaska looked hurriedly at the array of gear lining the bulkheads.\n\n\"Probably in the controls, if we have one.\" Crag finished the panels on\nhis side without any luck. Prochaska hastily started re-examining the\nwiring. Crag followed after him. A moment later his fingers found it, a\nsmooth flat case deeply imbedded between the wiring. Prochaska had gone\nover that panel a moment before! The thought struck him even as he moved\nit out, handling it gingerly. Prochaska showed his surprise. Crag\nglanced at Nagel and Larkwell. They had the suits free. He laid the\nbomb on the console. Larkwell saw it. His face showed understanding. He\nheaved one of the suits to Prochaska and a second one to Crag. They\nhurriedly donned them. Space limitations made it an awkward task. Crag\nkept his eyes on the chronometer. The hand seemed to whiz across the\ndial. He began to sweat, conscious that he was breathing heavily.\n\n\"Short exposure,\" he rapped out. \"Minimum pressure.\" He slipped on his\nhelmet, secured it to the neck ring and snapped on the face plate. He\nturned the oxygen valve and felt the pressure build up within the suit\nand helmet. The chronometer showed two minutes to go. He snapped a\nglance around. Nagel peered at him through his thick face plate with a\nworried expression. Larkwell's lips were compressed against his teeth.\nHis jaws worked spasmodically. Both were waiting, tense, watching him.\n\nProchaska was the last to finish. Crag waited impatiently for him to\nswitch on his oxygen valve before picking up the bomb. He motioned the\nothers to stand back and began opening the dogs which secured the escape\nhatch. He hesitated on the last one. The escaping air could whisk him\ninto space in a flash. The same thing had happened to crewmen riding in\nbubbles that broke at high altitude. Whoosh! He'd be gone! Conceivably,\nit could suck the cabin clean. Fortunately their gear had been secured\nas protection against the high g forces of escape. Too late to lash\nhimself with the seat harnessing. Time was running out. Panic touched\nhis mind. Calm down, Crag, he told himself. Play it cool, boy.\n\nProchaska saw his dilemma at the same instant. He squatted on the deck\nand thrust his legs straight out from the hips, straddling one of the\nseat supports. Larkwell and Nagel hurriedly followed suit. Crag cast a\nbackward glance at the chronometer--a minute and ten seconds to go! He\nthrew himself to one side of the hatch, squatted and hooked an arm into\na panel console, hoping it was strong enough. He laid the bomb on the\ndeck next to the hatch and reached up with his free hand, held his\nbreath, hesitated, and jarred the last dog loose.\n\nThe hatch exploded open. A giant claw seemed to grab his body, pulling\nhim toward the opening. It passed as quickly as it came, leaving him\nweak, breathless. The bomb had been whisked into space. He got to his\nfeet and grasped the hatch combing, looking out. It was a giddy,\nvertiginous moment. Before him yawned a great purple-black maw, a\nblacker purple than that seen through the view ports. It was studded\nwith unbelievably brilliant stars agleam with the hard luster of\ndiamonds--white diamonds and blue sapphires.\n\n_Something bright blinked in space._\n\nHe hesitated. The cold was already coming through his suit. He\nremembered he hadn't turned on either the heating element or interphone\nsystem. He drew the hatch shut and dogged it down, then switched both\non. The others saw his movements and followed suit.\n\n\"See anything?\" Prochaska was the first to ask. His voice sounded tinny\nand far away. Crag adjusted his amplifier and said grimly:\n\n\"It blew.\"\n\n\"How ... how did it get here?\" He identified the voice as Nagel's.\n\nHe snapped brusquely, \"That's what I'm going to find out.\" Larkwell was\nsilent. Nagel began fiddling with the oxygen valves. They waited,\nquietly, each absorbed in his thoughts until Nagel indicated it was safe\nto remove their suits. Crag's thoughts raced while he shucked the heavy\ngarments. It's past, he thought, but the saboteur's still here. Who? He\nflicked his eyes over the men. Who? That's what he had to find\nout--soon! When the suit was off, he hurriedly put through a call to\nGotch, reporting what had happened.\n\nThe Colonel listened without comment. When Crag finished, he was silent\nfor a moment. Finally he replied:\n\n\"Here's where we stand. We will immediately comb the record of every\nintelligence agent involved in the last shakedown. We'll also recomb the\nrecords of the Aztec crew, including yours. I've got to tell you this\nbecause it's serious. If there's a saboteur aboard--and I think there\nis--then the whole operation's in jeopardy. It'll be up to you to keep\nyour eyes open and analyze your men. We've tried to be careful. We've\nchecked everyone involved back to birth. But there's always the sleeper.\nIt's happened before.\"\n\n\"Check,\" Crag said. \"I only hope you don't catch up with all my early\npeccadillos.\"\n\n\"This is no time to be funny. Now, some more news for you. Washington\nreports that the enemy launched another missile this morning.\"\n\n\"Another one?\" Crag sighed softly. This time there would be no\nsatelloid, no Pickering to give his life.\n\nThe Colonel continued grimly. \"Radar indicates this is a different kind\nof rocket. Its rate of climb ... its trajectory ... indicates it's\nmanned. Now it's a race.\"\n\nCrag thought a moment. \"Any sign of a drone with it?\"\n\n\"No, that's the surprising part, if this is a full-scale attempt at\nestablishing a moon base. And we believe it is.\"\n\nCrag asked sharply. \"It couldn't be their atom-powered job?\" The\npossibility filled him with alarm.\n\n\"Positively not. We've got our finger squarely on that one and it's a\ngood year from launch-date. No, this is a conventional rocket ...\nperhaps more advanced than we had believed....\" His voice dropped off.\n\"We'll keep you posted,\" he added after a minute.\n\n\"Roger.\" Crag sighed. He removed the earphone reflectively. He wouldn't\ntell the others yet. Now that they were in space maybe ... just\nmaybe ... he could find time to catch his breath. Damn, they hadn't\nanticipated all this during indoctrination. The intercept-missile ...\ntime bomb ... possible traitor in the crew. What more could go wrong?\nFor just a second he felt an intense hostility toward Gotch. An Air\nForce full of pilots and he had to pick him--and he wasn't even in the\nAir Force at the time. Lord, he should have contented himself with\njockeying a jet airliner on some nice quiet hop. Like between L. A. and\nPearl ... with a girl at each end of the run.\n\nHe thought wistfully about the prospect while he made a routine check of\nthe instruments. Cabin pressure normal ... temperature 78 degrees F. ...\nnothing alarming in the radiation and meteor impact readings. Carbon\ndioxide content normal. Things might get routine after all, he thought\nmoodily. Except for one thing. The new rocket flashing skyward from east\nof the Caspian. One thing he was sure of. It spelled trouble.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nThe U. S. Navy's Space Scan Radar Station No. 5 picked up the new rocket\nbefore it was fairly into space. It clung to it with an electromagnetic\ntrain, bleeding it of data. The information was fed into computers,\ndigested, analyzed and transferred to Alpine Base, and thence\ntelemetered to the Aztec where it appeared as a pip on the analog\ndisplay. The grid had automatically adjusted to a 500-mile scale with\nthe positions of the intruder and Aztec separated by almost the width of\nthe instrument face. The Aztec seemed to have a clear edge in the race\nfor the moon. Prochaska became aware of the newcomer but refrained from\nquestions, nor did Crag volunteer any information.\n\nJust now he wasn't worrying about the East World rocket. Not at this\npoint. With Drone Able riding to starboard, the Aztec was moving at an\never slower rate of speed. It would continue to decelerate, slowed by\nthe earth's pull as it moved outward, traveling on inertial force since\nthe silencing of its engines. By the time it reached the neutral zone\nwhere the moon and earth gravispheres canceled each other, the Aztec\nwould have just enough speed left to coast into the moon's field of\ninfluence. Then it would accelerate again, picking up speed until slowed\nby its braking rockets. That was the hour that occupied his thoughts--a\ntime when he would be called upon for split-second decisions coming in\nwaves.\n\nHe tried to anticipate every contingency. The mass ratio necessary to\ninject the Aztec into its moon trajectory had precluded fuel beyond the\nabsolute minimum needed. The rocket would approach the moon in an\nelliptical path, correct its heading to a north-south line relative to\nthe planet and decelerate in a tight spiral. At a precise point in space\nhe would have to start using the braking rockets, slow the ship until\nthey occupied an exact point in the infinite space-time continuum, then\nlet down into cliff-brimmed Arzachel, a bleak, airless, utterly alien\nwasteland with but one virtue: Uranium. That and the fact that it\nrepresented the gateway to the Solar System.\n\nHe mentally reviewed the scene a hundred times. He would do this and\nthis and that. He rehearsed each step, each operation, each fleeting\nsecond in which all the long years of planning would summate in victory\nor disaster. He was the X in the equation in which the Y-scale was\nrepresented by the radar altimeter. He would juggle speed, deceleration,\naltitude, mass and a dozen other variables, keeping them in delicate\nbalance. Nor could he forget for one second the hostile architecture of\ntheir destination.\n\nFor all practical purposes Arzachel was a huge hole sunk in the moon--a\nvast depression undoubtedly broken by rocks, rills, rough lava outcrops.\nThe task struck him as similar to trying to land a high-speed jet in a\nwell shaft. Well, almost as bad.\n\nHe tried to anticipate possible contingencies, formulating his responses\nto each. He was, he thought, like an actor preparing for his first\nnight. Only this time there would be no repeat performance. The critics\nwere the gods of chance in a strictly one-night stand.\n\nGotch was the man who had placed him here. But the responsibility was\nall his. Gotch! All he gave a damn about was the moon--a chunk of real\nestate scorned by its Maker. Crag bit his lip ruefully. Stop feeling\nsorry for yourself, boy, he thought. You asked for it--practically\nbegged for it. Now you've got it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the end of the second day the novelty of space had worn off. Crag and\nProchaska routinely checked the myriad of instruments jammed into the\nfaces of the consoles: Meteorite impact counters, erosion counters,\nradiation counters--counters of all kinds. Little numbers on dials and\ngauges that told man how he was faring in the wastelands of the\nuniverse. Nagel kept a special watch on the oxygen pressure gauge.\nMeteorite damage had been one of Gotch's fears. A hole the size of a\npinhead could mean eventual death through oxygen loss, hence Nagel\nseldom let a half-hour pass without checking the readings.\n\nCrag and Prochaska spelled each other in brief catnaps. Larkwell, with\nno duties to perform, was restless. At first he had passed long hours at\nthe viewports, uttering exclamations of surprise and delight from time\nto time. But sight of the ebony sky with its fields of strewn jewels\nhad, in the end, tended to make him moody. He spent most of the second\nday dozing.\n\nNagel kept busy prowling through the oxygen gear, testing connections\nand making minor adjustments. His seeming concern with the equipment\nbothered Crag. The narrow escape with the time bomb had robbed him of\nhis confidence in the crew. He told himself the bomb could have been\nplanted during the last security shakedown. But a \"sleeper\" in security\nseemed highly unlikely. So did a \"sleeper\" in the Aztec. Everyone of\nthem, he knew, had been scanned under the finest security microscope\nalmost from birth to the moment each had climbed the tall ladder leading\nto the space cabin.\n\nHe covertly watched Nagel, wondering if his prowling was a form of\nescape, an effort to forget his fears. He was beginning to understand\nthe stark reality of Nagel's terror. It had been mirrored in his face, a\nnaked, horrible dread, during the recent emergency. No ... he wasn't the\nsaboteur type. Larkwell, maybe. Perhaps Prochaska. But not Nagel. A\nsaboteur would have iron nerves, a cold, icy fanaticism that never\nconsidered danger. But supposing the man were a consummate actor, his\nfear a mask to conceal his purpose?\n\nHe debated the pros and cons. In the end he decided it would not be\npolitic to forbid Nagel to handle the gear during flight. He was, after\nall, their oxygen equipment specialist. He contented himself with\nkeeping a sharp watch on Nagel's activities--a situation Nagel seemed\nunmindful of. He seemed to have lost some of his earlier fear. His face\nwas alert, almost cheerful at times; yet it held the attitude of\nwatchful waiting.\n\nDespite his liking for Prochaska, Crag couldn't forget that he had\nfailed to find the time bomb in a panel he had twice searched. Still,\nthe console's complex maze of wiring and tubes had made an excellent\nhiding place. He had to admit he was lucky to have found it himself. He\ntried to push his suspicions from his mind without relaxing his\nvigilance. It was a hard job.\n\nBy the third day the enemy missile had become a prime factor in the\nthings he found to worry about. The intruder rocket had drawn closer.\nAlpine warned that the race was neck and neck. It had either escaped\nearth at a higher speed or had continued to accelerate beyond the escape\npoint. Crag regarded the reason as purely academic. The hard fact was\nthat it would eventually overtake the still decelerating Aztec. Just now\nit was a pip on the analog, a pip which before long would loom as large\nas Drone Able, perhaps as close. He tried to assess its meaning, vexed\nthat Alpine seemed to be doing so little to help in the matter.\n\nLater Larkwell spotted the pip made by the East's rocket on the scope.\nThat let the cat out of the bag as far as Crag was concerned. Soberly he\ninformed them of its origin. Larkwell bit his lip thoughtfully. Nagel\nfurrowed his brow, seemingly lost in contemplation. Prochaska's\nexpression never changed. Crag assessed each reaction. In fairness, he\nalso assessed his own feeling toward each of the men. He felt a positive\ndislike of Nagel and a positive liking for Prochaska. Larkwell was a\nneutral. He seemed to be a congenial, open-faced man who wore his\nfeelings in plain sight. But there was a quality about him which, try as\nhe would, he could not put his finger on.\n\nNagel, he told himself, must have plenty on the ball. After all, he had\npassed through a tough selection board. Just because the man's\npersonality conflicted with his own was no grounds for suspicion. But\nthe same reasoning could apply to the others. The fact remained--at\nleast Gotch seemed certain--that his crew numbered a ringer among them.\nHe was mulling it over when the communicator came to life. The message\nwas in moon code.\n\nIt came slowly, widely spaced, as if Gotch realized Crag's limitations\nin handling the intricate cipher system evolved especially for this one\noperation. Learning it had caused him many a sleepless night. He copied\nthe message letter by letter, his understanding blanked by the effort\nto decipher it. He finished, then quickly read the two scant lines:\n\n\"_Blank channel to Alp unless survival need._\"\n\nHe studied the message for a long moment. Gotch was telling him not to\ncontact Alpine Base unless it were a life or death matter. Not that\neverything connected with the operation wasn't a life or death matter,\nhe thought grimly. He decided the message was connected with the\npresence of the rocket now riding astern and to one side of the Aztec\nand her drone. He guessed the Moon Code had been used to prevent\npossible pickup by the intruder rather than any secrecy involving his\nown crew.\n\nHe quietly passed the information to Prochaska. The Chief listened,\nnodding, his eyes going to the analog.\n\nAccording to his computations, the enemy rocket--Prochaska had dubbed it\nBandit--would pass abeam of Drone Able slightly after they entered the\nmoon's gravitational field, about 24,000 miles above the planet's\nsurface. Then what? He pursed his lips vexedly. Bandit was a factor that\nhad to be considered, but just how he didn't know. One thing was\ncertain. The East knew about the load of uranium in Crater Arzachel.\nThat, then, was the destination of the other rocket. Among the many X\nunknowns he had to solve, a new X had been added; the rocket from behind\nthe Iron Curtain. Something told him this would be the biggest X of all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nIf Colonel Michael Gotch were worried, he didn't show it. He puffed\ncomplacently on his black briar pipe watching and listening to the\nleathery-faced man across from him. His visitor was angular, about\nsixty, with gray-black hair and hard-squinted eyes. A livid scar bit\ndeep into his forehead; his mouth was a cold thin slash in his face. He\nwore the uniform of a Major General in the United States Air Force. The\nuniform did not denote the fact that its wearer was M.I.--Military\nIntelligence. His name was Leonard Telford.\n\n\"So that's the way it looks,\" General Telford was saying. \"The enemy is\nout to get Arzachel at all costs. Failing that, they'll act to keep us\nfrom it.\"\n\n\"They wouldn't risk war,\" Gotch stated calmly.\n\n\"No, but neither would we. That's the damnable part of it,\" the General\nagreed. \"The next war spells total annihilation. But for that very\nreason they can engage in sabotage and hostile acts with security of\nknowledge that we won't go to war. Look at them now--the missile attack\non the Aztec, the time bomb plant, the way they operate their networks\nright in our midst. Pure audacity. Hell, they've even got an agent _en\nroute_ to the moon. On our rocket at that.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded uncomfortably. The presence of a saboteur on the\nAztec represented a bungle in his department. The General was telling\nhim so in a not too gentle way.\n\n\"I seem to recall I was in Astrakhan myself a few years back,\" he\nreminded.\n\n\"Oh, sure, we build pretty fair networks ourselves,\" the General said\nblandly. He looked at Gotch and a rare smile crossed his face. \"How did\nyou like the dancing girls in Gorik's, over by the shore?\"\n\nGotch looked startled, then grinned. \"Didn't know you'd ever been that\nfar in, General.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, same time you were.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" Gotch breathed softly. There was a note of\nrespect in his voice. The General was silent for a moment.\n\n\"But the Caspian's hot now.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Warheads--with the name Arzachel writ large across the nose cones.\" He\neyed Gotch obliquely. \"If we secure Arzachel first, they'll blow it off\nthe face of the moon.\" They looked at each other silently. Outside a jet\nengine roared to life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe moon filled the sky. It was gigantic, breath-taking, a monstrous\nsphere of cratered rock moving in the eternal silence of space with\nghostly-radiance, heedless that a minute mote bearing alien life had\nentered its gravitational field. It moved in majesty along its orbit\nsome 2,300 miles every hour, alternately approaching to within 222,000\nmiles of its Earth Mother, retreating to over 252,000 miles measuring\nits strides by some strange cosmic clock.\n\nThe Apennines, a rugged mountain range jutting 20,000 feet above the\nplanet's surface, was clearly visible. It rose near the Crater\nEratosthenes, running northwest some 200 miles to form the southwest\nboundary of Mare Imbrium. The towering Leibnitz and Dorfel Mountains\nwere visible near the edge of the disc. South along the terminator, the\nborder between night and day, lay Ptolemaeus, Alphons, and Arzachel.\n\nCrag and Prochaska studied its surface, picking out the flat areas which\nearly astronomers had mistaken for seas and which still bore the names\nof seas. The giant enclosure Clavius, the lagoon-like Plato and\nash-strewn Copernicus held their attention. Crag studied the north-south\nline along which Arzachel lay, wondering again if they could seek out\nsuch a relatively small area in the jumbled, broken, twisted land\nbeneath them.\n\nAt some 210,000 miles from earth the Aztec had decelerated to a little\nover 300 miles per hour. Shortly after entering the moon's gravisphere\nit began to accelerate again. Crag studied the enemy rocket riding\nastern. It would be almost abreast them in short time, off to one side\nof the silver drone. It, too, was accelerating.\n\n\"Going to be nip and tuck,\" he told Prochaska. The Chief nodded.\n\n\"Don't like the looks of that stinker,\" he grunted.\n\nCrag watched the analog a moment longer before turning to the quartz\nviewport. His eyes filled with wonder. For untold ages lovers had sung\nof the moon, philosophers had pondered its mysteries, astronomers had\nscanned and mapped every visible mile of its surface until selenography\nhad achieved an exactness comparable to earth cartography. Scientists\nhad proved beyond doubt that the moon wasn't made of green cheese. But\nno human eye had ever beheld its surface as Crag was doing now--Crag,\nProchaska, Larkwell and Nagel. The latter two were peering through the\nside ports. Prochaska and Crag shared the forward panel. It was a\ntribute to the event that no word was spoken. Aside from the Chief's\noccasional checks on Drone Able and Bandit--the name stuck--the four\npairs of eyes seldom left the satellite's surface.\n\nThe landing plan called for circling the moon during which they were to\nmaneuver Drone Able into independent orbit. It was Crag's job to bring\nthe Aztec down at a precise point in Crater Arzachel and the Chief's job\nto handle the drone landings, a task as ticklish as landing the Aztec\nitself.\n\nThe spot chosen for landing was in an area where the Crater's floor was\nbroken by a series of rills--wide, shallow cracks the earth scientists\nhoped would give protection against the fall of meteorites. Due to lack\nof atmosphere the particles in space, ranging from dust grains to huge\nchunks of rock, were more lethal than bullets. They were another unknown\nin the gamble for the moon. A direct hit by even a grain-sized particle\ncould puncture a space suit and bring instant death. A large one could\nutterly destroy the rocket itself. Larkwell's job was to construct an\nairlock in one of the rills from durable lightweight prefabricated\nplastiblocks carried in the drones. Such an airlock would protect them\nfrom all but vertically falling meteorites.\n\nCrag felt almost humble in the face of the task they were undertaking.\nHe knew his mind alone could grasp but a minute part of the knowledge\nthat went into making the expedition possible. Their saving lay in the\nfact they were but agents, protoplasmic extensions of a complex of\ncomputers, scientists, plans which had taken years to formulate, and a\nman named Michael Gotch who had said:\n\n\"_You will land on Arzachel._\"\n\nHe initiated the zero phase by ordering the crew into their pressure\nsuits. Prochaska took over while he donned his own bulky garment,\ngrimacing as he pulled the heavy helmet over his shoulders. Later, in\nthe last moments of descent, he would snap down the face plate and\npressurize the suit. Until then he wanted all the freedom the bulky\ngarments would allow.\n\n\"Might as well get used to it.\" Prochaska grinned. He flexed his arms\nexperimentally.\n\nLarkwell grunted. \"Wait till they're pressurized. You'll think rigor\nmortis has set in.\"\n\nCrag grinned. \"That's a condition I'm opposed to.\"\n\n\"Amen.\" Larkwell gave a weak experimental jump and promptly smacked his\nhead against the low overhead. He was smiling foolishly when Nagel\nsnapped at him:\n\n\"One more of those and you'll be walking around the moon without a\npressure suit.\" He peevishly insisted on examining the top of the helmet\nfor damage.\n\nCrag fervently hoped they wouldn't need the suits for landing. Any\ndamage that would allow the Aztec's oxygen to escape would in itself be\na death sentence, even though death might be dragged over the long\nperiod of time it would take to die for lack of food. An intact space\ncabin represented the only haven in which they could escape from the\ncumbersome garments long enough to tend their biological needs.\n\nImperceptibly the sensation of weight returned, but it was not the body\nweight of earth. Even on the moon's surface they would weigh but\none-sixth their normal weight.\n\n\"Skipper, look.\" Prochaska's startled exclamation drew Crag's eyes to\nthe radarscope. Bandit had made minute corrections in its course.\n\n\"They're using steering rockets,\" Crag mused, trying to assess its\nmeaning.\n\n\"Doesn't make sense,\" said Prochaska. \"They can't have that kind of\npower to spare. They'll need every bit they have for landing.\"\n\n\"What's up?\" Larkwell peered over their shoulders, eyeing the\nradarscope. Crag bit off an angry retort. Larkwell sensed the rebuff and\nreturned away. They kept their eyes glued to the scope. Bandit\nmaneuvered to a position slightly behind and to one side of the silver\ndrone. Crag looked out the side port. Bandit was clearly visible, a\nmonstrous cylinder boring through the void with cold precision. There\nwas something ominous about it. He felt the hair prickle at the nape of\nhis neck. Larkwell moved alongside him.\n\nBandit made another minute correction. White vapor shot from its tail\nand it began to move ahead.\n\n\"Using rocket power,\" Crag grunted. \"Damn if I can figure that one out.\"\n\n\"Looks crazy to me. I should think--\" Prochaska's voice froze. A minute\npip broke off from Bandit, boring through space toward the silver drone.\n\n\"Warhead!\" Crag roared the word with cold anger.\n\nProchaska cursed softly.\n\nOne second Drone Able was there, riding serenely through space. The next\nit disintegrated, blasted apart by internal explosions. Seconds later\nonly fragments of the drone were visible.\n\nProchaska stared at Crag, his face bleak. Crag's brain reeled. He\nmentally examined what had happened, culling his thoughts until one cold\nfact remained.\n\n\"Mistaken identity,\" he said softly. \"They thought it was the Aztec.\"\n\n\"Now what?\"\n\n\"Now we hope they haven't any more warheads.\" Crag mulled the\npossibility. \"Considering weight factors, I'd guess they haven't.\nBesides, there's no profit in wasting a warhead on a drone.\"\n\n\"We hope.\" Prochaska studied Bandit through the port, and licked his\nlips nervously. \"Think we ought to contact Alpine?\"\n\nCrag weighed the question. Despite the tight beam, any communication\ncould be a dead giveaway. On the other hand, Bandit either had the\ncapacity to destroy them or it didn't. If it did, well, there wasn't\nmuch they could do about it. He reached a decision and nodded to\nProchaska, then began coding his thoughts.\n\nHe had trouble getting through on the communicator. Finally he got a\nweak return signal, then sent a brief report. Alpine acknowledged and\ncut off the air.\n\n\"What now?\" Prochaska asked, when Crag had finished.\n\nHe shrugged and turned to the side port without answering. Bandit loomed\nlarge, a long thick rocket with an oddly blunted nose. A monster that\nwas as deadly as it looked.\n\n\"Big,\" he surmised. \"Much bigger than this chunk of hardware.\"\n\n\"Yeah, a regular battleship,\" Prochaska assented. He grinned crookedly.\n\"In more ways than one.\"\n\nCrag sensed movement at his shoulder and turned his head. Nagel was\nstudying the radarscope over his shoulder. Surprise lit his narrow face.\n\n\"The drone?\"\n\n\"Destroyed,\" Crag said bruskly. \"Bandit had a warhead.\"\n\nNagel looked startled, then retreated to his seat without a word. Crag\nreturned his attention to the enemy rocket.\n\n\"What do you think?\" he asked Prochaska.\n\nHis answer was solemn. \"It spells trouble.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nAt a precise point in space spelled out by the Alpine computers Crag\napplied the first braking rockets. He realized that the act had been an\nimmediate tip-off to the occupants of the other rocket. No matter, he\nthought. Sooner or later they had to discover it was the drone they had\ndestroyed. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, their headlong flight was\nslowed. He nursed the rockets with care. There was no fuel to spare, no\nenergy to waste, no room for error. Everything had been worked out long\nbeforehand; he was merely the agent of execution.\n\nThe sensation of weight gradually increased. He ordered Larkwell and\nNagel into their seats in strapdown position. He and Prochaska shortly\nfollowed, but he left his shoulder harnessing loose to give his arms the\nvital freedom he needed for the intricate maneuvers ahead.\n\nThe moon rushed toward them at an appalling rate. Its surface was a\nharsh grille work of black and white, a nightmarish scape of pocks and\ntwisted mountains of rock rimming the flat lunar plains. It was, he\nthought, the geometry of a maniac. There was no softness, no blend of\nlight and shadow, only terrible cleavages between black and white. Yet\nthere was a beauty that gripped his imagination; the raw, stark beauty\nof a nature undefiled by life. No eye had ever seen the canopy of the\nheavens from the bleak surface below; no flower had ever wafted in a\nlunar breeze.\n\nProchaska nudged his arm and indicated the scope. Bandit was almost\nabreast them. Crag nodded understandingly.\n\n\"No more warheads.\"\n\n\"Guess we're just loaded with luck,\" Prochaska agreed wryly.\n\nThey watched ... waited ... mindless of time. Crag felt the tension\nbuilding inside him. Occasionally he glanced at the chronometer, itching\nfor action. The wait seemed interminable. Minutes or hours? He lost\ntrack of time.\n\nAll at once his hands and mind were busy with the braking rockets,\ndials, meters. First the moon had been a pallid giant in the sky; next\nit filled the horizon. The effect was startling. The limb of the moon,\nseen as a shallow curved horizon, no longer was smooth. It appeared as a\nrugged saw-toothed arc, somehow reminding him of the Devil's Golf Course\nin California's Death Valley. It was weird and wonderful, and slightly\nterrifying.\n\nProchaska manned the automatic camera to record the orbital and landing\nphases. He spotted the Crater of Ptolemaeus first, near the center-line\nof the disc. Crag made a minute correction with the steering rockets.\nThe enemy rocket followed suit. Prochaska gave a short harsh laugh\nwithout humor.\n\n\"Looks like we're piloting them in. Jeepers, you'd think they could do\ntheir own navigation.\"\n\n\"Shows the confidence they have in us,\" Crag retorted.\n\nThey flashed high above Ptolemaeus, a crater ninety miles in diameter\nrimmed by walls three thousand feet high. The crater fled by below them.\nSouth lay Alphons; and farther south, Arzachel, with walls ten thousand\nfeet high rimming its vast depressed interior.\n\nProchaska observed quietly: \"Nice rugged spot. It's going to take some\ndoing.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to get that what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here feeling.\"\n\n\"I've had it right along,\" Crag confided.\n\nThey caught only a fleeting look at Arzachel before it rushed into the\nbackground. Crag touched the braking rockets from time to time, gently,\nprecisely, keeping his eyes moving between the radar altimeter and speed\nindicator while the Chief fed him the course data.\n\nThe back side of the moon was spinning into view--the side of the moon\nnever before seen by human eyes. Prochaska whistled softly. A huge\nmountain range interlaced with valleys and chasms pushed some thirty\nthousand feet into the lunar skies. Long streaks of ochre and brown\nmarked its sides, the first color they had seen on the moon. Flat\nhighland plains crested between the peaks were dotted with strange\nmonolithic structures almost geometrical in their distribution.\n\nProchaska was shooting the scene with the automatic camera. Crag twisted\naround several times to nod reassuringly to Nagel and Larkwell but each\ntime they were occupied with the side ports, oblivious of his gesture.\nTo his surprise Nagel's face was rapt, almost dreamy, completely\nabsorbed by the stark lands below. Larkwell, too, was quiet with wonder.\n\nThe jagged mountains fell away to a great sea, larger even than Mare\nImbrium, and like Mare Imbrium, devoid of life. A huge crater rose from\nits center, towering over twenty thousand feet. Beyond lay more\nmountains. The land between was a wild tangle of rock, a place of\nunutterable desolation. Crag was fascinated and depressed at the same\ntime. The Aztec was closing around the moon in a tight spiral.\n\nThe alien landscape drew visibly nearer. He switched his attention\nbetween the braking rockets and instruments, trying to manage a quick\nglance at the scope. Prochaska caught his look.\n\n\"Bandit's up on us,\" he confirmed.\n\nCrag uttered a vile epithet and Prochaska grinned. He liked to hear him\ngrowl, taking it as a good sign.\n\nCrag glanced worriedly at the radar altimeter and hit the braking\nrockets harder. The quick deceleration gave the impression of added\nweight, pushing them hard against their chest harnesses.\n\nHe found it difficult to make the precise hand movements required. The\nAztec was dropping with frightening rapidity. They crossed more\nmountains, seas, craters, great chasms. Time had become meaningless--had\nceased to exist. The sheer bleakness of the face of the moon gripped his\nimagination. He saw it as the supreme challenge, the magnitude of which\ntook his breath. He was Cortez scanning the land of the Aztecs. More,\nfor this stark lonely terrain had never felt the stir of life. No\nbenevolent Maker had created this chaos. It was an inferno without\nfire--a hell of a kind never known on earth. It was the handiwork of a\nnature on a rampage--a maddened nature whose molding clay had been\nmolten lava.\n\nHe stirred the controls, moved them further, holding hard. The braking\nrockets shook the ship, coming through the bulkheads as a faint roar.\nThe ground came up fast. Still the landscape fled by--fled past for\nseeming days.\n\nProchaska announced wonderingly. \"We've cleared the back side. You're on\nthe landing run, Skipper.\"\n\nCrag nodded grimly, thinking it was going to be rough. Each second, each\nsplit second had to be considered. There was no margin for error. No\nsecond chance. He checked and re-checked his instruments, juggling speed\nagainst altitude.\n\nNinety-mile wide Ptolemaeus was coming around again--fast. He caught a\nglimpse through the floor port. It was a huge saucer, level at the\nbottom, rimmed by low cliffs which looked as though they had been carved\nfrom obsidian. The floor was split by irregular chasms, punctuated by\nsharp high pinnacles. It receded and Alphons rushed to meet them. The\nAztec was dropping fast. Too fast? Crag looked worriedly at the radar\naltimeter and hit the braking rockets harder. Alphons passed more\nslowly. They fled south, a slim needle in the lunar skies.\n\n\"Arzachel....\" He breathed the name almost reverently.\n\nProchaska glanced out the side port before hurriedly consulting the\ninstruments. Thirty thousand feet! He glanced worriedly at Crag. The\nground passed below them at a fantastic speed. They seemed to be\ndropping faster. The stark face of the planet hurtled to meet them.\n\n\"Fifteen thousand feet,\" Prochaska half-whispered. Crag nodded. \"Twelve\nthousand ... ten ... eight....\" The Chief continued to chant the\naltitude readings in a strained voice. Up until then the face of the\nmoon had seemed to rush toward the Aztec. All at once it changed. Now it\nwas the Aztec that rushed across the hostile land--rushing and dropping.\n\"Three thousand ... two thousand....\" They flashed high above a great\ncliff which fell away for some ten thousand feet. At its base began the\nplain of Arzachel.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye Crag saw that Bandit was leading\nthem. But higher ... much higher. Now it was needling into the\npurple-black--straight up. He gave a quick, automatic instrument check.\nThe braking rockets were blasting hard. He switched one hand to the\nsteering rockets.\n\nZero minute was coming up. Bandit was ahead, but higher. It could, he\nthought, be a photo finish. Suddenly he remembered his face plate and\nsnapped it shut, opening the oxygen valve. The suit grew rigid on his\nbody and hampered his arms. He cursed softly and looked sideways at\nProchaska. He was having the same difficulty. Crag managed a quick\nover-the-shoulder glance at Larkwell and Nagel. Everything seemed okay.\n\nHe took a deep breath and applied full deceleration with the braking\njets and simultaneously began manipulating the steering rockets. The\nship vibrated from stem to stern. The forward port moved upward; the\nface of the moon swished past and disappeared. Bandit was lost to sight.\nThe ship trembled, shuddered and gave a violent wrench. Crag was thrown\nforward.\n\nThe Aztec began letting down, tail first. It was a sickening moment. The\nbraking rockets astern, heavy with smoke, thundered through the hull.\nThe smoke blanketed out the ports. The cabin vibrated. He straightened\nthe nose with the steering rockets, letting the ship fall in a vertical\nattitude, tail first. He snapped a glance at the radar altimeter and\npunched a button.\n\nA servo mechanism somewhere in the ship started a small motor. A tubular\nspidery metal framework was projected out from the tail, extending some\ntwenty feet before it locked into position. It was a failing device\nintended to absorb the energy generated by the landing impact.\n\nProchaska looked worriedly out the side port. Crag followed his eyes.\nSmall details on the plain of Arzachel loomed large--pits, cracks, low\nridges of rock. Suddenly the plain was an appalling reality. Rocky\nfingers reached to grip them. He twisted his head until he caught sight\nof Bandit. It was moving down, tail first, but it was still high in the\nsky. Too high, he thought. He took a fast look at the radar altimeter\nand punched the full battery of braking rockets again. The force on his\nbody seemed unbearable. Blood was forced into his head, blurring his\nvision. His ears buzzed and his spine seemed to be supporting some\ngigantic weight. The pressure eased and the ground began moving up more\nslowly. The rockets were blasting steadily.\n\nFor a split-second the ship seemed to hang in mid-air followed by a\nviolent shock. The cabin teetered, then smashed onto the plain, swaying\nas the framework projecting from the tail crumpled. The shock drove them\nhard into their seats. They sat for a moment before full realization\ndawned. They were down--alive!\n\nCrag and Prochaska simultaneously began shucking their safety belts.\nCrag was first. He sprang to the side port just in time to see the last\nseconds of Bandit's landing. It came down fast, a perpendicular needle\nstabbing toward the lunar surface. Flame spewed from its braking\nrockets; white smoke enveloped its nose.\n\nFast ... too fast, he thought. Suddenly the flame licked out. Fuel\nerror. The thought flashed through his mind. The fuel Bandit had wasted\nin space maneuvering to destroy the drone had left it short. The rocket\nseemed to hang in the sky for a scant second before it plummeted\nstraight down, smashing into the stark lunar landscape. The Chief had\nreached his side just in time to witness the crash.\n\n\"That's all for them,\" he said. \"Can't say I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Serves 'em damn well right,\" growled Crag. He became conscious of Nagel\nand Larkwell crowding to get a look and obligingly moved to one side\nwithout taking his eyes from the scene. He tried to judge Bandit's\ndistance.\n\n\"Little over two miles,\" he estimated aloud.\n\n\"You can't tell in this vacuum,\" Prochaska advised. \"Your eyes play you\ntricks. Wait'll I try the scope.\" A moment later he turned admiringly\nfrom the instrument.\n\n\"Closer to three miles. Pretty good for a green hand.\"\n\nCrag laughed, a quiet laugh of self-satisfaction, and said, \"I could use\na little elbow room. Any volunteers?\"\n\n\"Liberty call,\" Prochaska sang out. \"All ashore who's going ashore. The\ngals are waiting.\"\n\n\"I'm a little tired of this sardine can, myself,\" Larkwell put in.\n\"Let's get on our Sunday duds and blow. I'd like to do the town.\" There\nwas a murmur of assent. Nagel, who was monitoring the oxygen pressure\ngauge, spoke affirmatively. \"No leaks.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Crag said with relief. He took a moment off to feel exultant but\nthe mood quickly vanished. There was work ahead--sheer drudgery.\n\n\"Check suit pressure,\" he ordered.\n\nThey waited a moment longer while they tested pressure, the interphones,\nand adjusted to the lack of body weight before Crag moved toward the\nhatch. Prochaska prompted them to actuate their temperature controls:\n\n\"It's going to be hot out there.\"\n\nCrag nodded, checked his temperature dial and started to open the hatch.\nThe lock-lever resisted his efforts for a moment. He tested the dogs\nsecuring the door. Several of them appeared jammed. Panic touched his\nmind. He braced his body, moving against one of the lock levers with all\nhis strength. It gave, then another. He loosened the last lock braced\nagainst the blast of escaping air. The hatch exploded open.\n\nHe stood for a moment looking at the ground, some twenty feet below. The\nmetal framework now crumpled below the tail had done its work. It had\nstruck, failing, and in doing so had absorbed a large amount of impact\nenergy which otherwise would have been absorbed by the body of the\nrocket with possible damage to the space cabin.\n\nThe Aztec's tail fins were buried in what appeared to be a powdery ash.\nThe rocket was canted slightly but, he thought, not dangerously so.\nLarkwell broke out the rope ladder provided for descent and was looking\nbusy. Now it was his turn to shine. He hooked the ladder over two pegs\nand let the other end fall to the ground. He tested it then straightened\nup and turned to Crag.\n\n\"You may depart, Sire.\"\n\nCrag grinned and started down the ladder. It was clumsy work. The bulk\nand rigidity of his suit made his movements uncertain, difficult. He\ndescended slowly, testing each step. He hesitated at the last rung,\nthinking: _This is it!_ He let his foot dangle above the surface for a\nmoment before plunging it down into the soft ash mantle, then walked a\nfew feet, ankle deep in a fine gray powder. First human foot to touch\nthe moon, he thought. The first human foot ever to step beyond the\nworld. Yeah, the human race was on the way--led by Adam Philip Crag. He\nfelt good.\n\nIt occurred to him then that he was not the real victor. That honor\nbelonged to a man 240,000 miles away. Gotch had won the moon. It had\nbeen the opaque-eyed Colonel who had directed the conquest. He, Crag,\nwas merely a foot soldier. Just one of the troops. All at once he felt\nhumble.\n\nProchaska came down next, followed by Nagel. Larkwell was last. They\nstood in a half-circle looking at each other, awed by the thing they had\ndone. No one spoke. They shifted their eyes outward, hungrily over the\nplain, marveling at the world they had inherited. It was a bleak,\nhostile world encompassed in a bowl whose vast depressed interior\nalternately was burned and frozen by turn. To their north the rim of\nArzachel towered ten thousand feet, falling away as it curved over the\nhorizon to the east and west. The plain to the south was a flat expanse\nof gray punctuated by occasional rocky knolls and weird, needle-sharp\npinnacles, some of which towered to awesome heights.\n\nSoutheast a long narrow spur of rock rose and crawled over the floor of\nthe crater for several miles before it dipped again into its ashy bed.\nCrag calculated that a beeline to Bandit would just about skirt the\nsoutheast end of the spur. Another rock formation dominated the\nmiddle-expanse of the plain to the south. It rose, curving over the\ncrater floor like the spinal column of some gigantic lizard--a great\ncrescent with its horns pointed toward their present position. Prochaska\npromptly dubbed it \"Backbone Ridge,\" a name that stuck.\n\nCrag suddenly remembered what he had to do, and coughed meaningfully\ninto his lip mike. The group fell silent. He faced the distant northern\ncliffs and began to speak:\n\n\"I, Adam Crag, by the authority vested in me by the Government of the\nUnited States of America, do hereby claim this land, and all the lands\nof the moon, as legal territory of the United States of America, to be a\ndominion of the United States of America, subject to its Government and\nlaws.\"\n\nWhen he finished, he was quiet for a minute. \"For the record, this is\nPickering Field. I think he'd like that,\" he added. There was a lump in\nhis throat.\n\nProchaska said quietly, \"Gotch will like it, too. Hadn't we better\nrecord that and transmit it to Alpine?\"\n\n\"It's already recorded.\" Crag grinned. \"All but the Pickering Field\npart. Gotch wrote it out himself.\"\n\n\"Confident bastard.\" Larkwell smiled. \"He had a lot more faith than I\ndid.\"\n\n\"Especially the way you brought that stovepipe down,\" Nagel interjected.\nThere was a moment of startled silence.\n\nProchaska said coldly. \"I hope you do your job as well.\"\n\nNagel looked provocatively at him but didn't reply.\n\nLarkwell had been studying the terrain. \"Wish Able had made it,\" he said\nwistfully. \"I'd like to get started on that airlock. It's going to be a\nhoney to build.\"\n\n\"Amen.\" Crag swept his eyes over the ashy surface. \"The scientists\nfigure that falling meteorites may be our biggest hazard.\"\n\n\"Not if we follow the plan of building our airlock in a rill,\" Larkwell\ninterjected. \"Then the only danger would be from stuff coming straight\ndown.\"\n\n\"Agreed. But the fact remains that we lost Able. We'll have to chance\nliving in the Aztec until Drone Baker arrives.\"\n\n\"If it makes it.\"\n\n\"It'll make it,\" Crag answered with certainty. Their safe landing had\nboosted his confidence. They'd land Baker and Charlie, in that order, he\nthought. They'd locate a shallow rill; then they'd build an airlock to\nprotect them against chance meteorites. That's the way they'd do it;\none ... two ... three....\n\n\"We've got it whipped,\" Prochaska observed, but his voice didn't hold\nthe certainty of his words.\n\nCrag said, \"I was wondering if we couldn't assess the danger. It might\nnot be so great....\"\n\n\"How?\" Prochaska asked curiously.\n\n\"No wind, no air, no external forces to disturb the ash mantle, except\nfor meteorites. Any strike would leave a trace. We might smooth off a\ngiven area and check for hits after a couple of days. That would give\nsome idea of the danger.\" He faced Prochaska.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"But the ash itself is meteorite dust,\" he protested.\n\n\"We could at least chart the big hits--those large enough to damage the\nrocket.\"\n\n\"We'll know if any hit,\" Larkwell prophesied grimly.\n\n\"Maybe not;\" Nagel cut in. \"Supposing it's pinhole size? The air could\nseep out and we wouldn't know it until too late.\"\n\nCrag said decisively. \"That means we'll have to maintain a watch over\nthe pressure gauge.\"\n\n\"That won't help if it's a big chunk.\" Prochaska scraped his toe through\nthe ash. \"The possibility's sort of disconcerting.\"\n\n\"Too damned many occupational hazards for me,\" Larkwell ventured. \"I\nmust have had rocks in my head when I volunteered for this one.\"\n\n\"All brawn and no brain.\" Crag gave a wry smile. \"That's the kind of\nfodder that's needed for deep space.\"\n\nProchaska said, \"We ought to let Gotch know he's just acquired a few\nmore acres.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Crag hesitated a moment. \"Then we'll check out on Bandit.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Larkwell asked.\n\n\"There might be some survivors.\"\n\n\"Let them rot,\" Nagel growled.\n\n\"That's for me to decide,\" Crag said coldly. He stared hard at the\noxygen man. \"We're still human.\"\n\nNagel snapped, \"They're damned murderers.\"\n\n\"That's no reason we should be.\" Crag turned back toward the ladder.\nWhen he reached it, he paused and looked skyward. The sun was a precise\ncircle of intolerable white light set amid the ebony of space. The stars\nseemed very close.\n\nThe space cabin was a vacuum. At Nagel's suggestion they kept pressure\nto a minimum to preserve oxygen. When they were out of their suits,\nProchaska got on the radio. He had difficulty raising Alpine Base,\nworking for several minutes before he got an answering signal. When the\nconnection was made, Crag moved into Prochaska's place and switched to\nhis ear insert microphone. He listened to the faint slightly metallic\nvoice for a moment before he identified it as Gotch's. He thought: _The\nOld Man must be living in the radio shack._ He adjusted his headset and\nsent a lengthy report.\n\nIf Gotch were jubilant over the fruition of his dream, he carefully\nconcealed it. He congratulated Crag and the crew, speaking in precise\nformal terms, and almost immediately launched into a barrage of\nquestions regarding their next step. The Colonel's reaction nettled him.\nLord, he should be jubilant ... jumping with joy ... waltzing the\ntelephone gal. Instead he was speaking with a business-as-usual manner.\nGotch left it up to Crag on whether or not to attempt a rescue\nexpedition.\n\n\"But not if it endangers the expedition in any way,\" he added. He\ninformed him that Drone Baker had been launched without mishap. \"Just\nbe ready for her,\" he cautioned. \"And again--congratulations,\nCommander.\" There was a pause....\n\n\"I think Pickering Field is a fitting name.\" The voice in the earphones\ndied away and Crag found himself listening to the static of space. He\npulled the sets off and turned to Nagel.\n\n\"How much oxygen would a man need for a round trip to Bandit, assuming a\ntotal distance of seven miles.\"\n\n\"It's not that far,\" Prochaska reminded.\n\n\"There might be detours.\"\n\nNagel calculated rapidly. \"An extra cylinder would do it.\"\n\n\"Okay, Larkwell and I'll go. You and Prochaska stand by.\" Crag caught\nthe surprised look on the Chief's face.\n\n\"There might be communication problems,\" he explained. Privately, he had\ndecided that no man would be left alone until the mystery of the time\nbomb was cleared up.\n\nProchaska nodded. The arrangement made sense. Nagel appeared pleased\nthat he didn't have to make the long trek. Larkwell, on the other hand,\nseemed glad to have been chosen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nThere is no dawn on the moon, no dusk, no atmosphere to catch and spread\nthe light of the sun. When the lunar night ends--a night two earth weeks\nlong--the sun simply pops over the horizon, bringing its intolerable\nheat. But the sky remains black--black and sprinkled with stars agleam\nwith a light unknown on earth. At night the temperature is 250 degrees\nbelow zero; by day it is the heat of boiling water. Yet the sun is but\nan intense circle of white aloft in a nigrescent sky. It was a world\nsuch as Crag had scarcely dreamed of--alien, hostile, fantastic in its\narchitecture--a bizarre world spawned by a nature in revolt.\n\nCrag stopped to adjust the temperature control on his suit. He started\nto mop his brow before he remembered the helmet. Larkwell saw the\ngesture, and behind his thick face plate his lips wrinkled in a grin.\n\"Go on, scratch it,\" he challenged.\n\n\"This moon's going to take a lot of getting used to.\" Crag swept his\neyes over the bleak plain. \"And they send four men to conquer this.\"\n\n\"It ain't conquered yet,\" Larkwell spat.\n\nCrag's answer was a sober reflection. \"No, it isn't,\" he said quietly.\nHe contemplated the soot-filled sky, its magic lanterns, then looked\ndown again at the plain.\n\n\"Let's get moving.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dawn--dawn in the sense that the sun had climbed above the\nhorizon. The landing had been planned for sunup--the line which divided\nnight from day--to give them the benefit of a two-week day before\nanother instantaneous onslaught of night.\n\nThey moved slowly across the ashy floor of the crater, occasionally\ncircling small knolls or jagged rock outcroppings. Despite the\ncumbersome suits and the burden of the extra oxygen cylinder each\ncarried, they made good time. Crag led the way with Larkwell close\nbehind, threading his way toward the spot where the enemy rocket had\nfallen from the sky. They had to stop several times to rest and regulate\ntheir temperature controls. Despite the protective garments they were\nsoon sweating and panting, gasping for breath with the feeling of\nsuffocation. Crag felt the water trickling down his body in rivulets\nand began to itch, a sensation that was almost a pain.\n\n\"It's not going to be a picnic,\" Larkwell complained. His voice sounded\nexhausted in the earphones.\n\nCrag grunted without answering. His feet ploughed up little spurts of\ndust which fell as quickly as they rose. Like water dropping, he\nthought. He wondered how long they would be able to endure the heat.\nCould they possibly adapt their bodies to such an environment? What of\nthe cold of night? The questions bothered him. He tried to visualize\nwhat it would be like to plunge from boiling day to the bitterly cold\nnight within the space of moments. Would they be able to take it? He\ngrinned to himself. They'd find out!\n\nAt the next halt they looked back at the Aztec.\n\n\"We don't seem to be getting anywhere,\" Larkwell observed. Crag\ncontemplated the rocket. He was right. The ship seemed almost as large\nand clear as ever.\n\n\"Your eyes trick you,\" he said. \"It's just another thing we'll have to\nget used to.\" He let his eyes linger on the plain. It was washed with a\nbrilliant light which even their glare shields didn't diminish. Each\nrock, each outcrop cast long black shadows--black silhouettes against\nthe white ash. There were no grays, no intermediate shades. Everything\nwas either black or white. His eyes began to ache and he turned them\nfrom the scene. He nodded at Larkwell and resumed his trek. He was\ntrudging head down when he suddenly stopped. A chasm yawned at his feet.\n\n\"Mighty wide,\" Larkwell observed, coming up.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Crag, indecisively. The rift was about twenty feet wide,\nits bottom lost in black shadows.\n\nLarkwell studied the chasm carefully. \"Might be just the rill we need\nfor an airlock. If it's not too deep,\" he added. He picked up a boulder\nand dropped it over the edge, waiting expectantly. Crag chuckled. The\nconstruction man had forgotten that sound couldn't be transmitted\nthrough a vacuum. Larkwell caught the laugh in his earphones and smiled\nweakly.\n\nHe said sheepishly, \"Something else to learn.\"\n\n\"We've plenty to learn.\" Crag looked both ways. To the right the chasm\nseemed to narrow and, although he wasn't sure, end.\n\n\"Let's try it,\" he suggested. Larkwell nodded agreement. They trudged\nalong the edge of the fissure, walking slowly to conserve their energy.\nThe plain became more uneven. Small outcroppings of black glassy rock\npunctured the ash, becoming more numerous as they progressed. Occasional\nsaw-toothed needles pierced the sky. Several times they stopped and\nlooked back at the Aztec. It was a black cylinder, smaller yet seemingly\nclose.\n\nCrag's guess was right. The chasm narrowed abruptly and terminated at\nthe base of a small knoll. Both rockets were now hidden by intervening\nrocks. He hesitated before striking out, keeping Backbone Ridge to his\nright. The ground became progressively more uneven. They trudged onward\nfor over a mile before he caught sight of the Aztec again. He paused,\nwith the feeling something was wrong. Larkwell put it into words.\n\n\"Lost.\"\n\n\"Not lost, but off course.\" Crag took a moment to get his bearings and\nthen struck out again thinking their oxygen supply couldn't stand many\nof these mistakes.\n\n\"How you doing, Skipper?\"\n\nCrag gave a start before remembering that Prochaska and Nagel were cut\ninto their intercom.\n\n\"Lousy,\" he told them. He gave a brief run-down.\n\n\"Just happened to think that I could help guide you. I'll work you with\nthe scope,\" Prochaska said.\n\n\"Of course,\" Crag exclaimed, wondering why they hadn't thought of it\nbefore. One thing was certain: they'd have to start remembering a lot\nof things. Thereafter, they checked with Prochaska every few minutes.\n\nThe ground constantly changed as they progressed. One moment it was\nlevel, dusty with ash; the next it was broken by low rocky ridges and\ninterlacing chasms. Minutes extended into seeming hours and they had to\nstop for rest from time to time. Crag was leading the way across a small\nravine when Larkwell's voice brought him up short:\n\n\"Commander, we're forgetting something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Radcounters. Mine's whispering a tune I didn't like.\"\n\n\"Not a thing to worry about,\" Crag assured him. \"The raw ores aren't\nthat potent.\" Nevertheless he unhooked his counter and studied it.\nLarkwell was right. They were on hot ground but the count was low.\n\n\"Won't bother us a bit,\" he affirmed cheerfully.\n\nLarkwell's answer was a grunt. Crag checked the instrument several times\nthinking that before long--when they were settled--they would mark off\nthe boundaries of the lode. Gotch would want that. The count rose\nslightly. Once he caught Larkwell nervously consulting his meter.\nClearly the construction boss wasn't too happy over their position. Crag\nwanted to tell him he had been reading too many Sunday supplements but\ndidn't.\n\nProchaska broke in, \"You're getting close.\" His voice was a faint\nwhisper over the phones. \"Maybe you'd better make a cautious approach.\"\n\nCrag remembered the fate of Drone Able and silently agreed. Thereafter\nhe kept his eyes peeled. They climbed a small knoll and saw Bandit. He\nabruptly halted, waiting until Larkwell reached his side.\n\nThe rocket lay at the base of the slope, which fell away before them. It\nwas careened at a crazy angle with its base crumpled. A wide cleft\nrunning half way to its nose was visible. Crag studied the rocket\ncarefully.\n\n\"Might still be oxygen in the space cabin,\" he ventured finally. \"The\nbreak in the hull might not reach that far.\"\n\n\"It does,\" Larkwell corrected. His eyes, trained in construction work,\nhad noted small cracks in the metal extending up alongside the hatch.\n\n\"No survivors in there,\" he grunted.\n\nCrag said thoughtfully: \"Might be, if they had on their pressure suits.\nAnd they would have,\" he added.\n\nHe hesitated before striking across the clearing, then began moving down\nthe slope. Larkwell followed slowly. As he neared the rocket Crag saw\nthat it lacked any type of failing device to absorb the landing impact.\nThat, at least, had been one secret kept, he thought. He was wondering\nhow to get into the space cabin when Larkwell solved the problem. He\ndrew a thin hemp line from a leg pocket and began uncoiling it. Crag\nsmiled approval.\n\n\"Never without one in the construction business,\" he explained. He\nstudied Bandit. \"Maybe I can hook it over the top of that busted tail\nfin, then work my way up the break in the hull.\"\n\n\"Let me try,\" Crag offered. The climb looked hazardous.\n\n\"This is my province.\" Larkwell snorted. He ran his eye over the ship\nbefore casting the line. He looked surprised when it shot high above the\nintended target point.\n\n\"Keep forgetting the low gravity,\" he apologized. He tried again. On the\nthird throw he hooked the line over the torn tailfin. He rubbed his\nhands against his suit then started upward, climbing clumsily, each\nmovement exaggerated by the bulky suit. He progressed slowly, testing\neach step. Crag held his breath. Larkwell gripped the line with his body\nswung outward, his feet planted against the vertical metal, reminding\nCrag of a human fly. He stopped to rest just below the level of the\nspace cabin.\n\n\"Thought a man was supposed to be able to jump thirty feet on the moon,\"\nhe panted.\n\n\"You can if you peel those duds off,\" Crag replied cheerfully. He ran\nhis eye over the break noting the splintered metal. \"Be careful of your\nsuit.\"\n\nLarkwell didn't answer. He was busy again trying to pull his body\nupward, using the break in the hull to obtain finger grips. Only the\nmoon's low gravity allowed him to perform what looked like an impossible\ntask. He finally reached a point alongside the hatch and paused,\nbreathing heavily. He rested a moment, then carefully inserted his hand\ninto the break in the hull. After a moment he withdrew it, and fumbled\nin his leg pocket withdrawing a switchblade knife.\n\n\"Got to cut through the lining,\" he explained. He worked the knife\naround inside the break for several minutes, then closed the blade and\nreinserted his hand, feeling around until he located the lockbar.\n\nHe tugged. It didn't give. He braced his body and exerted all of his\nstrength. This time it moved. He rested a moment then turned his\nattention to the remaining doglocks. In short time he had the hatch\nopen. Carefully, then, he pulled his body across to the black rectangle\nand disappeared inside.\n\n\"See anything?\" Crag shifted his feet restlessly.\n\n\"Dead men.\" Larkwell's voice sounded relieved over the phones. \"Smashed\nface plates.\" There was a long moment of silence. Crag waited\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Just a second,\" he finally reported. \"Looks like a live one.\" There was\nanother interval of silence while Crag stewed. Finally he appeared in\nthe opening with a hemp ladder.\n\n\"Knew they had to have some way of getting out of this trap,\" he\nannounced triumphantly. He knelt and secured one end to the hatch\ncombing and let the other end drop to the ground.\n\nCrag climbed to meet him. Larkwell extended a hand and helped him\nthrough the hatch. One glance at the interior of the cabin told him that\nany life left was little short of a miracle. The man in the pilot's seat\nlay with his faceplate smashed against the instrument panel. The top of\nhis fiberglass helmet had shattered and the top of his head was a bloody\nmess. A second crewman was sprawled over the communication console with\nhis face smashed into the radarscope. His suit had been ripped from\nshoulder to waist and one leg was twisted at a crazy angle. Crag turned\nhis eyes away.\n\n\"Here,\" Larkwell grunted. He was bent over the third and last crewman,\nwho had been strapped in a bucket seat immediately behind the pilot.\nCrag moved to his side and looked down at the recumbent figure. The\nman's suit seemed to have withstood the terrible impact. His helmet\nlooked intact, and his faceplate was clouded.\n\nProchaska nodded affirmatively. \"Breathing,\" he said.\n\nCrag knelt and checked the unconscious man as best he could before\nfinally getting back to his feet.\n\n\"It's going to be a helluva job getting him back.\"\n\nLarkwell's eyes opened with surprise. \"You mean we're going to lug that\nbastard back to the Aztec?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\nLarkwell didn't reply. Crag loosened the unconscious man from his\nharnessing. Larkwell watched for a while before stooping to help. When\nthe last straps were free they pulled him close to the edge of the hatch\nopening. Crag made a mental inventory of the cabin while Larkwell\nunscrewed two metal strips from a bulkhead and laced straps from the\nsafety harnessing between them, making a crude stretcher.\n\nCrag opened a narrow panel built into the rear bulkhead and\ninvoluntarily whistled into his lip mike. It contained two\nshort-barreled automatic rifles and a supply of ammunition. Larkwell\neyed the arms speculatively.\n\n\"Looks like they expected good hunting,\" he observed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Crag grimly agreed. He slammed the metal panel shut and looked\ndistastefully at the unconscious man. \"I've a damned good notion to\nleave him here.\"\n\n\"That's what I was thinking.\"\n\nCrag debated, and finally shrugged his shoulders. \"Guess we're elected\nas angels of mercy. Well, let's go.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Florence Nightingale Larkwell,\" the construction boss spat. He\nlooped a line under the unconscious man's arms and rolled him to the\nbrink of the opening.\n\n\"Ought to shove him out and let him bounce a while,\" he growled.\n\nCrag didn't answer. He ran the other end of the line around a metal\nstanchion and signaled Larkwell to edge the inert figure through the\nhatch. Crag let the line out slowly until it became slack. Larkwell\nstraightened up and leaned against the hatch combing with a foolish look\non his face. Crag took one look at his gaping expression.\n\n\"Oxygen,\" he snapped. Larkwell looked blank. He seized the extra\ncylinder from his belt and hooked it into Larkwell's suit, turning the\nvalve. Larkwell started to sway, and almost fell through the hatch\ncombing before Crag managed to pull him to safety.\n\nWithin moments comprehension dawned on Larkwell's face. Crag quickly\nchecked his own oxygen. It was low. Too low. The time they had lost\ntaking the wrong route ... the time taken to open Bandit's hatch ... had\nupset Nagel's oxygen calculations. It was something else to remember in\nthe future. He switched cylinders, then made a rapid calculation. It was\nevident they couldn't carry the injured man back with the amount of\noxygen remaining. He got on the interphones and outlined the problem to\nNagel.\n\n\"Try one of Bandit's cylinders,\" he suggested. \"They just might fit.\"\n\n\"No go. I've already looked them over.\" He kicked the problem around in\nhis mind.\n\n\"Here's the routine,\" he told him. \"You start out to meet us with a\ncouple of extra cylinders. We'll take along a couple of Bandit's spares\nto last this critter until you can modify the valves on his suit to fit\nour equipment. Prochaska can guide the works. Okay?\"\n\n\"Roger,\" Prochaska cut in. Nagel gave an affirmative grunt.\n\nCrag lowered two of Bandit's cylinders and the stretcher to the floor of\nthe crater, then took a last look around the cabin. Gotch, he knew,\nwould ask him a thousand technical questions regarding the rocket's\nconstruction, equipment, and provisioning. He filed the mental pictures\naway for later analysis and turned to Larkwell.\n\n\"Let's go.\" They descended to the plain and rolled the unconscious\ncrewman onto the stretcher. Crag grunted as he hoisted his end. It\nwasn't going to be easy.\n\nThe return trip proved a nightmare. Despite the moon's low surface\ngravity--one-sixth that of earth--the stretcher seemed an intolerable\nweight pulling at their arms. They trudged slowly toward the Aztec with\nCrag in the lead, their feet kicking up little fountains of dust.\n\nBefore they had gone half a mile, they were sweating profusely and their\narms and shoulders ached under their burden. Larkwell walked silently,\nsteadily, but his breath was becoming a hoarse pant in Crag's earphones.\nThe thought came to Crag that they wouldn't make it if, by any chance,\nNagel failed to meet them. But he can't fail--not with Prochaska guiding\nthem, he thought.\n\nThey reached the end of the rill and stopped to rest. Crag checked his\noxygen meter. Not good. Not good at all, but he didn't say anything to\nLarkwell. The construction boss swung his eyes morosely over the plain\nand cursed.\n\n\"Nine planets and thirty-one satellites in the Solar System and we had\nto pick this dog,\" he grumbled. \"Gotch must be near-sighted.\"\n\nCrag sighed and picked up his end of the stretcher. When Larkwell had\nfollowed suit they resumed their trek. They were moving around the base\nof a small knoll when Larkwell's foot struck a pothole in the ash and he\nstumbled. He dropped the end of the stretcher in trying to regain his\nbalance. It struck hard against the ground, transmitting the jolt to\nCrag's aching shoulders. He lowered his end of the stretcher, fearful\nthe plow had damaged the injured man's helmet. Larkwell watched\nunsympathetically while he examined it.\n\n\"Won't make much difference,\" he said.\n\nCrag managed a weak grin. \"Remember, we're angels of mercy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, carrying Lucifer.\"\n\nThe helmet proved intact. Crag sighed and signaled to move on. They\nhoisted the stretcher and resumed their slow trek toward the Aztec.\n\nCrag's body itched from perspiration. His face was hot, flushed and his\nheart thudded in his ears. Larkwell's breathing became a harsh rasp in\nthe interphones. Occasionally Prochaska checked their progress. Crag\nthought Nagel was making damned poor time. He looked at his oxygen meter\nseveral times, finally beginning to worry. Larkwell put his fears into\nwords.\n\n\"We'd better drop this character and light out for the Aztec,\" he\ngrowled. \"We're not going to make it this way.\"\n\n\"Nagel should reach us soon.\"\n\n\"Soon won't be soon enough.\"\n\n\"Nagel! Get on the ball,\" Crag snapped curtly into the interphones.\n\n\"Moving right along.\" The oxygen man's voice was a flat imperturbed\ntwang. Crag fought to keep his temper under control. Nagel's calm was\nmaddening. But it was their necks that were in danger. He repressed his\nanger, wondering again at the wisdom of trying to save the enemy\ncrewman. If he lived?\n\nIn short time Larkwell was grumbling again. He was on the point of\ntelling him to shut up when Nagel appeared in the distance. He was\nmoving slowly, stooped under the weight of the spare oxygen cylinders.\nHe appeared somewhat like an ungainly robot, moving with mechanical\nsteps--the movements of a machine rather than a man. Crag kept his eyes\non him. Nagel never faltered, never changed pace. His figure grew\nsteadily nearer, a dark mechanical blob against the gray ash. Crag\nsuddenly realized that Nagel wasn't stalling; he simply lacked the\nstrength for what was expected of him. Somehow the knowledge added to\nhis despair.\n\nThey met a short time later. Nagel dropped his burden in the ash and\nsquirmed to straighten his body. He looked curiously at the figure in\nthe stretcher, then at Crag.\n\n\"Doesn't make much sense to me,\" he said critically. \"Where are we going\nto get the oxygen to keep this bird alive?\"\n\n\"That's my worry,\" Crag snapped shortly.\n\n\"Seems to me it's mine,\" Nagel pointed out. \"I'm the oxygen man.\"\n\nCrag probed the voice for defiance. There was none. Nagel was merely\nstating a fact--an honest worry. His temper was subsiding when Larkwell\nspoke.\n\n\"He's right. This bird's a parasite. We ought to heave him in the rill.\nHell, we've got worries enough without....\"\n\n\"Knock it off,\" Crag snarled harshly. There was a short silence during\nwhich the others looked defiantly at him.\n\n\"Stop the bickering and let's get going,\" Crag ordered. He felt on the\nverge of an explosion, wanted to lash out. Take it easy, he told\nhimself.\n\nWith fresh oxygen and three men the remainder of the trip was easier.\nProchaska was waiting for them. He helped haul the Bandit crewman to the\nsafety of the space cabin. When it was pressurized they removed their\nsuits and Crag began to strip the heavy space garments from the injured\nman's body. He finished and stepped back, letting him lie on the deck.\n\nThey stood in a tight half-circle, silently studying the inert figure.\nIt was that of an extremely short man, about five feet, Crag judged, and\nthin. A thinness without emaciation. His face was pale, haggard and,\nlike the Aztec crewmen's, covered with stubbly beard. He appeared in his\nlate thirties or early forties but Crag surmised he was much younger.\nHis chest rose and fell irregularly and his breathing was harsh. Crag\nknelt and checked his pulse. It was shallow, fast.\n\n\"I don't know.\" He got to his feet. \"He may have internal injuries ...\nor just a bad concussion.\"\n\n\"To hell with him,\" spat Larkwell.\n\nProchaska said, \"He'll either live or die. In either case there's not\nmuch we can do about it.\" His voice wasn't callous, just matter-of-fact.\nCrag nodded agreement. The Chief turned his back. Crag was brooding over\nthe possible complications of having an enemy in their midst when his\nnostrils caught a familiar whiff. He turned, startled. The Chief was\nholding a pot of coffee.\n\n\"I did smuggle one small helping,\" he confessed.\n\nCrag looked thoughtfully at the pot. \"I should cite you for a\ncourt-martial. However ...\" He reached for the cup the Chief was\nextending.\n\nThey drank the coffee slowly, savoring each drop, while Larkwell\noutlined their next step. It was one Crag had been worrying about.\n\n\"As you know, the plans call for living in the Aztec until we can get a\nsheltered airlock into operation,\" Larkwell explained. \"To do that we\ngotta lower this baby to the horizontal so I can loosen the afterburner\nsection and clear out the gunk. Then we can get the prime airlock\ninstalled and working. That should give us ample quarters until we can\nbuild the permanent lock--maybe in that rill we passed.\"\n\n\"We got to rush that,\" Nagel cut in. \"Right now we lose total cabin\npressure every time we stir out of this trap. We can't keep it up for\nlong.\"\n\nCrag nodded. Nagel was right. The airlock had to be the first order of\nbusiness. The plans called for just such a move and, accordingly, the\nrocket had been designed with such a conversion in mind. Only it had\nbeen planned as a short-term stopgap--one to be used only until a\nbelow-surface airlock could be constructed. Now that Drone Able had been\nlost--\n\n\"Golly, what'll we do with all the room?\" Prochaska broke in humorously.\nHe flicked his eyes around the cabin. \"Just imagine, we'll be able to\nsleep stretched out instead of doubled up in a bucket seat.\"\n\nLarkwell took up the conversation and they listened while he outlined\nthe step-by-step procedure. It was his show and they gave him full\nstage. He suggested they might be able to use one of Aztec's now useless\nservo motors in the task. When he finished, Crag glanced down at the\nBandit crewman. Pale blue eyes stared back at him. Ice-blue, calm, yet\ntinged with mockery. They exchanged a long look.\n\n\"Feel better?\" Crag finally asked, wondering if by any chance he spoke\nEnglish.\n\n\"Yes, thank you.\" The voice held the barest suggestion of an accent.\n\n\"We brought you to our ship ...\" Crag stopped, wondering how to proceed.\nAfter all the man was an enemy. A dangerous one at that.\n\n\"So I see.\" The voice was laconic. \"Why?\"\n\n\"We're human,\" snapped Crag brutally. The pale blue eyes regarded him\nintently.\n\n\"I'm Adam Crag, Commander,\" he added. The Bandit crewman tried to push\nhimself up on his elbow. His face blanched and he fell back.\n\n\"I seem to be a trifle weak,\" he apologized. He looked at the circle of\nfaces before his eyes settled back on Crag. \"My name is Richter. Otto\nRichter.\"\n\nProchaska said, \"That's a German name.\"\n\n\"I am German.\"\n\n\"On an Iron Curtain rocket?\" Nagel asked sarcastically. Richter gave the\noxygen man a long cool look.\n\n\"That seems to be the case,\" he said finally. The group fell silent. It\nwas Crag's move. He hesitated. When he spoke his tone was decisive.\n\n\"We're stuck with you. For the time being you may regard yourself as\nconfined. You will not be allowed any freedom ... until we decide what\nto do with you.\"\n\n\"I understand.\"\n\n\"As soon as we modify the valves on your suit to fit our cylinders we're\ngoing to move you outside.\" He instructed Nagel to get busy on the\nvalves, then turned to Larkwell.\n\n\"Let's get along with lowering this baby.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\"Gordon Nagel?\" The professor turned the name over in his mind. \"Yes, I\nbelieve I recall him. Let's see, that would have been about....\" He\npaused, looking thoughtfully into space.\n\nThe agent said, \"Graduated in '55. One of your honor students.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, how could I have forgotten?\" The Professor folded his hands\nacross his plump stomach and settled back in his chair.\n\n\"I seem to recall him as sort of an intense, nervous type,\" he said at\nlast. \"Sort of withdrawn but, as you mentioned, quite brilliant. Now\nthat I think of it--\"\n\nHe abruptly stopped speaking and looked at the agent with a startled\nface.\n\n\"You mean the man in the moon?\" he blurted.\n\n\"Yes, that's the one.\"\n\n\"Ah, no wonder the name sounded so familiar. But, of course, we have so\nmany famous alumni. Ruthill University prides itself--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the agent cut in.\n\nThe professor gave him a hurt look before he began talking again. He\nrambled at length. Every word he uttered was taped on the agent's pocket\nrecorder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Gordon Nagel, the young man on the moon flight? Why certainly I recall\nyoung Nagel,\" the high school principal said. \"A fine student ... one of\nthe best.\" He looked archly at the agent down a long thin nose.\n\n\"Braxton High School is extremely proud of Gordon Nagel. Extremely\nproud. If I say so myself he has set a mark for other young men to\nstrive for.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the agent agreed.\n\n\"This is a case which well vindicates the stress we've put on the\nphysical and life sciences,\" the principal continued. \"It is the\nobjective of Braxton High School to give every qualified student the\ngroundwork he needs for later academic success. That is, students with\nsufficiently high I.Q.,\" he added.\n\n\"Certainly, but about Gordon Nagel...?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" The principal began to speak again. The agent relaxed,\nlistening. He didn't give a damn about the moon but he was extremely\ninterested in the thirty some years of Nagel's life preceding that trip.\nVery much so. He left the school thinking that Nagel owed quite a lot to\nBraxton High. At least the principal had inferred as much.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, I did go with Gordon for a while,\" Mrs. LeRoy Farwell said. \"But\nof course it was never serious. Just an occasional school dance or\nsomething. He might be famous but, well, frankly he wasn't my type. He\nwas an awful drip.\" Her eyes brushed the agent's face meaningfully.\n\n\"I like 'em live, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mrs. Farwell,\" the agent said gravely. \"But about Nagel...?\"\n\nThere were many people representing three decades of contact with Gordon\nNagel. Some of them recalled him only fleetingly. Others rambled at\nlength. Odd little entries came to life to fit into the dossier.\nPhotographs and records were exhumed. Gordon Nagel ... Gordon Nagel....\n\nThe file on Gordon Nagel grew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Michael Gotch didn't like the idea of an addition to the Aztec\ncrew. Didn't like it at all. He informed Crag that the rescue had been\nentirely unnecessary. Unrealistic, was the word he had used. He was\nextremely interested in the fact that Bandit housed an arsenal. He\nsuggested, in view of Drone Able's loss, they shouldn't overlook\nBandit's supplies.\n\n\"Especially as you have another mouth to feed,\" he said blandly.\n\nCrag agreed. He didn't say so but he had already planned just such a\nmove. The Colonel immediately launched into a barrage of questions\nconcerning the crashed rocket. He seemed grieved when Crag couldn't\nsupply answers down to the last detail.\n\n\"Look,\" Crag finally exploded, \"give us time ... time. We just got here.\nRemember?\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes, I know. But the information is vital,\" Gotch said firmly.\n\"I would appreciate it if you would try....\"\n\nCrag cursed and snapped the communicator off.\n\n\"What's wrong? The bird colonel heckling you?\"\n\n\"Hounding is the word,\" Crag corrected. He fixed the Chief with a\nbaleful eye and uttered an epithet with regard to the Colonel's\nancestry. Prochaska chuckled.\n\nLarkwell quickly demonstrated that he knew the Aztec inside and out far\nbetter than did any of the others. Aside from several large cables\nsupplied expressly for the purpose of lowering the rocket, he obtained\nthe rest of the equipment needed from the ship.\n\nUnder his direction two winches were set up about thirty yards from the\nship and a cable run to each to form a V-line. A second line ran from\neach winch to a nearby shallow gully. Heavy weights--now useless parts\nof the ship's engines--were fastened to these and buried. The lines were\nintended to anchor the winches during the critical period of lowering\nthe rocket. Finally Larkwell ran a guide line from the Aztec's nose to a\nthird winch. This one was powered by an electric motor which was powered\nby the ship's batteries.\n\nWhile Larkwell and Nagel prepared to lower the rocket Crag smoothed off\nan area of the plain's surface and marked off a twenty-foot square. He\nfinished and looked at his handiwork with satisfaction. Richter's eyes\nwere filled with interest.\n\n\"Using it to chart the frequency of meteorite falls,\" Crag explained.\n\"We'd like to get an idea of the hazard.\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" Richter said succinctly. He started to add more and stopped.\nCrag felt the urge to pump him but refrained. The least he became\ninvolved the better, he thought. It didn't escape him that the German\nseemed to have recovered to a remarkable extent. Well, that was\nsomething else to remember. Richter injured was one thing. But Richter\nrecovered ...\n\nHe snapped the thought off and turned toward the base of the rocket,\nindicating that the German should follow. Larkwell was testing the\nwinches and checking the cables when they arrived.\n\n\"About ready,\" he told Crag.\n\n\"Then let her go.\"\n\nThe construction boss nodded and barked a command to Prochaska and\nNagel, who were manning the restraining winches. When they acknowledged\nthey were ready he strode to the power winch.\n\n\"Okay.\" His voice was a terse crack in the interphones. The Aztec\nshuddered on its base, teetering, then its nose began to cant downward.\nIt moved slowly in an arc across the sky.\n\n\"Take up,\" Larkwell barked into the mike. The guide lines tautened.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThis time Prochaska and Nagel fed line through the winches more slowly.\nThe nose of the rocket had passed through sixty degrees of arc when its\ntail began to inch backward, biting into the plain.\n\n\"Hold up!\" Larkwell circled the rocket and approached the tailfins from\none side. He looked up at the body of the ship, then back at the base.\nSatisfied it would hold he ordered the winches started. The nose moved\nslowly toward the ground, swaying slightly from side to side. In another\nmoment it lay on its belly on the plain.\n\n\"Now the real work begins,\" Larkwell told Crag. \"We gotta clean\neverything out of that stovepipe and get the airlock rigged.\" His voice\nwas complaining but his face indicated the importance he attached to the\njob.\n\n\"How long do you figure it'll take?\"\n\nLarkwell rubbed his faceplate thoughtfully. \"About two days, with some\ncatnaps and some help.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Crag looked thoughtfully at Richter. \"Any reason you can't\nhelp?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"None at all,\" Richter answered solemnly.\n\nWhile Larkwell and Nagel labored in the tail section, Crag and\nProchaska rearranged the space cabin. The chemical commode was placed in\none corner and a nylon curtain rigged around it--their one concession to\ncivilization. Crag was conscious of Richter's eyes following\nthem--weighing, analyzing, speculating. He caught himself swiveling\naround at odd times to check on him, but Richter seemed unconcerned.\n\nElectric power from the batteries was limited. For the most part they\nwould be living on space rations--food concentrates supplemented with\nvitamin pills--and a square of chocolate daily per man. Later, when the\nairlock was installed in the area now occupied by the afterburners and\nmachinery, they would be able to appreciably extend their living\nquarters. Until then, Crag thought wryly, they would live like\nsardines--with an enemy in their midst. An enemy and a saboteur, he\nmentally corrected. Aside from that there was the constant danger from\nmeteorite falls. He shook his head despairingly. Life on the moon wasn't\nall it could be. Not by a damn sight.\n\nNagel was becoming perturbed over their oxygen consumption. He had set\nup the small tanks containing algae in a nutrient solution, tending them\nlike a mother hen. In time, if the cultivation were successful, the\nsmall algae farm would convert the carbon dioxide from their respiration\ninto oxygen. At the present time the carbon dioxide was being absorbed\nby chemical means. As things stood, it was necessary for the entire crew\nto don spacesuits every time one of them left the cabin. Each time the\ncabin air was lost in the vacuum of the moon. Crag pointed out there was\nno alternative until the airlock was completed, a fact which didn't keep\nNagel from complaining.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOtto Richter recovered fast. Before another day had passed--the Aztec\ncontinued to operate by earth clock--he seemed to have completely\nrecovered. It was evident that concussion and shock had been the extent\nof his injuries. Crag didn't know whether to be sorry or glad, he\ndidn't, in fact, know what to do with the man. He gave firm orders that\nRichter was never to be left alone--not for a moment.\n\nHe told him: \"You will not be allowed in the area of any of the\nelectronic equipment. First time you do ...\" He looked meaningfully at\nhim.\n\n\"I understand,\" the German said. Thereafter, except for occasional trips\nto the commode, or to help with work, he kept to the corner of the space\ncabin allotted him.\n\nLarkwell came up for the evening meal wearing a grim look. He extended\nhis hand toward Crag, holding a jagged chunk of rock nearly the size of\na baseball.\n\nCrag took the hunk and hefted it thoughtfully. \"Meteorite?\" The others\nclustered around.\n\n\"Yeah. I saw a hole in that cleared off section and reached down. There\nshe was, big as life.\"\n\n\"If that had hit this pipe we'd be dead ducks,\" Prochaska observed.\n\n\"But it didn't hit,\" Crag corrected, trying to allay any gathering\nnervousness. \"It just means that we're going to have to get going on the\nrill airlock as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"How will loss of Able affect that?\" Nagel asked curiously.\n\n\"Only in the matter of size,\" Crag explained. \"The possible loss of a\ndrone was taken into account. The plastiblocks are constructed to make\nany size shelter possible. We'll start immediately when Baker lands.\" He\nlooked thoughtfully at the men. \"Let's not borrow any trouble.\"\n\n\"Yeah, there's plenty without borrowing any more,\" Prochaska agreed. He\nsmiled cheerfully. \"I vote we all stop worrying and eat.\"\n\nAnother complication arose. Drone Baker would be in orbit the following\nmorning. Prochaska had to be prepared to bring it down. He was busy\nmoving his equipment into one compact corner opposite the commode. He\nrigged a curtain around it, partly for privacy but mainly to mark off a\ndefinite area prohibited to Richter.\n\nThe communicator was becoming another problem that harried Crag. A\ngovernment geologist wanted a complete description of Arzachel's rock\nstructure. A space medicine doctor had a lot of questions about the\nworking of the oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange system. Someone else--Crag\nwas never quite sure who--wanted an exact description of how the Aztec\nhad handled during letdown. In the end he got on the communicator and\ncurtly asked for Gotch.\n\n\"Keep these people off our backs until we land Drone Baker,\" he told\nhim. \"It's not headquarters for some damned quiz program.\"\n\n\"You're big news,\" Gotch placated. \"What you tell us will help with\nfuture rockets.\"\n\n\"Like a mineral description of the terrain?\"\n\n\"Even that. But cheer up, Commander. The worst is yet to come.\" He broke\noff before Crag could snap a reply. Prochaska grinned at his\ndiscomfiture.\n\n\"That's what comes of being famous,\" he said. \"We're wheels.\"\n\n\"A wheel on the moon.\" Crag looked questioningly at him. \"Is that good?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know. I haven't been here long enough.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrag was surprised to see how rapidly work in the tail section was\nprogressing. Larkwell had loosened the giant engines and fuel tanks and\npulled them from the ship with power from one of the rocket's servo\nmotors. They lay on the dusty floor of the plain, incongruous in their\nnew setting. He thought it a harbinger of things to come. A rocket\ngarage on the floor of barren Arzachel. Four men attempting to build an\nempire from the hull of a space ship. In time it would be replaced by an\nairlock in a rill ... a military base ... a domed city. Pickering Field\nwould become a transportation center, perhaps the hub of the Solar\nSystem's transportation empire. First single freighters, then ore\ntrains, would travel the highways of space between earth mother and her\nlong separated child. He sighed. The ore trains were a long way in the\nfuture.\n\nLarkwell crawled out from the cavern he had hollowed in the hull and\nstretched. \"Time for chow,\" he grunted. His voice over the interphones\nsounded tired. Nagel followed him looking morose. He didn't acknowledge\nCrag's presence.\n\nAt evening by earth clock they ate their scant fare. They were unusually\nsilent. The Chief seemed weary from his long vigil on the scope.\nLarkwell's face was sweaty, smudged with grease. He ate quickly, with\nthe air of a man preoccupied with weighty problems. Nagel was clearly\nbushed. Larkwell's fast pace had been too much for him. He wore a cross,\nirritable expression and avoided all conversation. Richter sat alone,\nseemingly unconcerned that he was a virtual prisoner, confined to one\nsmall corner of the cabin barely large enough to provide sleeping space.\nCrag had no feelings where he was concerned, neither resentment nor\nsympathy. The German was just a happenstance, a castaway in the war for\nArzachel. Or, more probable, he thought, the war for the moon.\n\nAfter chow the men took turns shaving with the single razor. It had been\nsupplied only because of the need to keep the oxygen ports in the\nhelmets free and to keep the lip mikes clear.\n\n\"Pure luxury,\" Prochaska said when his turn came. \"Nothing's too good\nfor the spaceman.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" Crag agreed. \"I hope the next crew is going to get a bar of\nsoap.\"\n\n\"For their sake I hope they pick something better than this crummy\nplanet,\" Larkwell grunted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrone Baker had entered the moon's gravisphere at the precise time\nspelled out by the earth computers. Its speed had dropped to a mere two\nhundred miles per hour. It began to accelerate, pulled by the moon,\nmoving in a vast trajectory calculated to put it into a closing orbit\naround the barren satellite. Prochaska picked it up and followed it on\nthe scope. Telemeter control from Alpine fired the first braking\nrockets. The blast countered the moon's pull. Drone Baker was still a\nspeck on the scope--a solitary traveler rushing toward them through the\nvoid.\n\n\"Seems incredible it took us that long,\" Crag mused, studying the\ninstrument panel. He reached over and activated the analog. Back on\nearth saucers with faces lifted to the skies were tracking the drone's\nflight. Their information was channeled into computer batteries,\nintegrated, analyzed, and sent back into space. The wave train ended in\na gridded scope--the analog Crag was viewing.\n\n\"Seemed a damned lot shorter when we were up there,\" he speculated\naloud.\n\n\"That's one experience that really telescopes time,\" the Chief agreed.\n\"I'd hate to have to sweat it out again.\"\n\n\"When do we take over?\"\n\nProchaska glanced at the master chrono. \"Not till 0810, give or take a\nfew minutes. It depends on the final computations from Alpine.\"\n\n\"Better catch some sleep,\" Crag suggested. \"It's going to be touchy once\nwe get hold of it.\"\n\n\"We'll be damn lucky if we get it down in Arzachel.\"\n\n\"We'd better.\" Crag grinned. \"Muff this and we might as well take out\nlunar citizenship.\"\n\n\"No thanks. Not interested.\"\n\n\"What's the matter, Max, no pioneer spirit?\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" Prochaska answered amiably.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Prochaska, that's no way to speak to your commanding officer,\"\nCrag reproved with mock severity.\n\n\"Okay. Go to hell, Sir,\" he joked.\n\nRichter was a problem. Someone had to be awake at all times. Crag\ndecided to break the crew into watches, and laid out a tentative\nschedule. He would take the first watch, Larkwell would relieve him at\nmidnight, and Nagel would take over at 0300. That way Prochaska would\nget a full night's sleep. He would need steady nerves come morning. He\noutlined the schedule to the crew. Neither Larkwell nor Nagel appeared\nenthusiastic over the prospect of initiating a watch regime, but neither\nprotested openly.\n\nWhen the others were asleep, Crag cut off the light to preserve battery\npower. He studied the lunar landscape out the port, thinking it must be\nthe bleakest spot in the universe. He twisted his head and looked\nstarward. The sky was a grab bag of suns. Off to one side giant Orion\nlooked across the gulf of space at Taurus and the Pleiades, the seven\ndaughters of Atlas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\"Commander!\" Crag came to with a start Prochaska was leaning over him.\nUrgency was written across his face.\n\n\"Come quick!\" The Chief stepped back and motioned with his head toward\nthe instrument corner. Crag sprang to his feet with a sense of alarm.\nRichter and Larkwell were still asleep. He glanced at the master chrono,\n0610, and followed him into the electronics corner. Nagel was standing\nby the scope, a frightened look on his face.\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"Nagel woke me at six. I came in to get ready for Drone Baker ....\"\n\n\"Get to the point,\" Crag snapped irritably.\n\n\"Sabotage.\" He indicated under the panel. \"All the wiring under the main\nconsole's been slashed.\"\n\nCrag felt a sense of dread. \"How long will it take to make repairs?\"\n\n\"I don't know--don't know the full extent of the damage.\"\n\n\"Find out,\" Crag barked. \"How about the communicator?\"\n\n\"Haven't tried it,\" Prochaska admitted. \"I woke you up as soon as I\nfound what had happened.\" He reached over and turned a knob. After a few\nseconds a hum came from the console. \"Works,\" he said.\n\n\"See how quickly you can make repairs,\" Crag ordered. \"We've got to hook\nonto the drone pretty quick.\"\n\nHe swung impatiently toward Nagel. \"Was anyone up during your watch? Did\nanyone go to the commode?\"\n\nNagel said defensively: \"No, and I was awake all the time.\" Too\ndefensive, Crag thought. But no one had stirred during his watch.\nTherefore, the sabotage had occurred between midnight and the time Nagel\nwakened Prochaska. But, wait ... Prochaska could have done the sabotage\nin the few moments he was at the console after Nagel woke him. It would\nhave taken just one quick slash--the work of seconds. That left him in\nthe same spot he'd been in with regard to the time bomb.\n\nHe grated harshly at Nagel: \"Wake Larkwell and get on with the airlock.\nAnd don't chatter about what's happened,\" he added.\n\n\"I won't,\" Nagel promised nervously. He retreated as if glad to be rid\nof Crag's scrutiny.\n\n\"A lousy mess,\" Prochaska grunted.\n\nCrag didn't answer.\n\n\"If we don't solve this, we're going to wind up dead,\" he pursued.\n\nCrag turned and faced him. \"It could be anybody. You ... me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know.\" The Chief's face got a hard tight look. \"Only it\nisn't ... it isn't me.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" Crag countered.\n\nProchaska said bitterly: \"You'd better find out.\"\n\n\"I will,\" Crag said shortly. He got on the communicator. It took several\nminutes to raise Alpine. He wasn't surprised when Gotch answered, and\nbriefly related what had happened.\n\n\"Is there any possibility of telemetering her all the way in?\" He knew\nthere wasn't, but he asked anyway.\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Okay, well try and make it from here.\"\n\nThe Colonel added a few comments. They were colorful but definitely not\ncomplimentary. He got the distinct impression the Colonel wasn't pleased\nwith events on the moon. When his cold voice faded from the\ncommunicator, Crag tried the analog. The grid scope came to life but it\nwas blank. Of course, he thought, Drone Baker was cut off from earth by\nthe body of the moon. It could not be simulated on the analog until it\ncame from behind the blind side where the earth saucers could track its\nflight.\n\n\"Morning,\" Larkwell said, sticking his head around the curtain. \"How\nabout climbing into your suits so we can get out of this can?\" Crag\nstudied his face. It seemed void of any guile. Nagel stood nervously\nbehind him.\n\n\"Okay,\" Crag said shortly. He hated to have Prochaska lose the precious\nmoments. They hurriedly donned their suits and Nagel decompressed the\ncabin, Larkwell opened the hatch and they left. Crag closed it after\nthem and released fresh oxygen into the cabin. Richter took off his suit\nand returned to his corner. His eyes were bright with interest. He\nknows, Crag thought.\n\nAt 0630 the communicator came to life. A voice at the other end gave\nDrone Baker's position and velocity as if nothing had happened. The\ndrone, on the far side of the moon, was decelerating, dropping as servo\nmechanisms operating on timers activated its blasters. It was guided\nsolely by the radio controlled servos, following a flight path\npreviously determined by banks of computers. Everything was in apple-pie\norder, except for the snafu in Arzachel, Crag thought bitterly.\n\nProchaska worked silently, swiftly. Crag watched with a helpless\nfeeling. There wasn't room for both of them to work at one time. The\nChief's head and arms literally filled the opening of the sabotaged\nconsole. Once he snapped for more light and Crag beamed a torch over his\nshoulder, fretting from the inaction.\n\nSounds came through the rear bulkhead where Larkwell and Nagel were\nworking in the tail section. Strange, Crag thought, to all appearances\neach crew member was a dedicated man. But one was a traitor. Which one?\nThat's what he had to find out. Richter would have been the logical\nsuspect were it not for the episode of the time bomb. No, it hadn't been\nthe German. It was either the competent Prochaska, the sullen Nagel or\nthe somehow cheerful but inscrutable Larkwell. But there should be a\nclue. If only he knew what to look for. Well, he'd find it. When he\ndid ... He clenched his fists savagely.\n\nAt 0715 Alpine simulated the drone on the analog. Fifteen minutes later\nProchaska pulled his head from the console and asked Crag to try the\nscope. It worked.\n\n\"Now if I can get those damn wires that control the steering and braking\nrockets ...\" He dived back into the console. Crag looked at the chrono,\nthen swung his eyes to the instruments. Drone Baker was coming in fast.\nThe minutes ticked off. The communicator came to life with more data.\nBaker was approaching Ptolemaeus on its final leg. The voice cut off and\nGotch came on.\n\n\"We're ready to transfer control.\"\n\nProchaska shook his head negatively without looking up.\n\n\"What's the maximum deadline?\" Crag asked.\n\n\"0812, exactly three minutes, ten seconds,\" Gotch rasped. Prochaska\nmoved his head to indicate maybe. The communicator was silent. Crag\nwatched the master chrono.\n\nAt 0812 Prochaska was still buried in the panel. Crag's dismay\ngrew--dismay and a sense of guilt over the sabotage. Gotch had warned\nhim against the possibility innumerable times. Now it had happened. The\nloss of Drone Able had been a bad blow; the loss of Baker could be\nfatal, not only to the success of their mission but to their survival.\n\nSurvival meant an airlock and the ability to live on their scant\nsupplies until Arzachel was equipped to handle incoming rockets on a\nbetter-than-chance basis. Well, one thing at a time, he thought. He\nsuppressed the worry nagging at his mind. Just now it was Drone Baker's\nturn at bat.\n\nAt 0813 Prochaska sprang to his feet and nodded. Crag barked an okay\ninto the communicator while the Chief got his bearings on the\ninstruments. Crag hoped the lost minute wouldn't be fatal. By 0814\nProchaska had the drone under control. It was 90,000 feet over Alphons\ntraveling at slightly better than a thousand miles per hour. He hit the\nbraking rockets hard.\n\n\"We're not going to make it,\" he gritted. He squinted his eyes. His face\nwas set, grim.\n\n\"Hold it with full braking power.\"\n\n\"Not sufficient fuel allowance.\"\n\n\"Then crash it as close as possible.\"\n\nProchaska nodded and moved a control full over. The drone's braking\nrockets were blasting continuously. Crag studied the instruments. It was\ngoing to be close. By the instrument data they couldn't make it. Drone\nBaker seemed doomed. It was too high, moving too fast despite the lavish\nwaste of braking power. His hand clenched the back of Prochaska's seat.\nHe couldn't tear his eyes from the scope. Baker thundered down.\n\nSuddenly the drone was on them. It cleared the north rim of Arzachel at\n3,000 feet. Too high, Crag half-whispered. The difference lay in the\nlost minute. Prochaska pushed and held the controls. Crag pictured the\nrocket, bucking, vibrating, torn by the conflict of energies within its\nfragile body.\n\nProchaska fingered the steering rockets and pushed the drone's nose\nupward. Crag saw it through the port. It rushed through space in a\nskidding fashion before it began to move upward from the face of the\nmoon. Prochaska hit the braking jets with full power. Crag craned his\nhead to follow its flight. Out of one corner of his eye he saw Nagel and\nLarkwell on the plain, their helmeted heads turned skyward. He scrunched\nhis face hard against the port and caught the drone at the top of its\nclimb.\n\nIt was a slender needle with light glinting on its tail--the Sword of\nDamocles hanging above their heads. It hung ... suspended in space ...\nthen began backing down, dropping stern first with flame and white vapor\npouring from its tail jets. It came fast. Occasional spurts from radial\njets around its nose kept its body perpendicular to the plain. Vapor\nfrom the trail fluffed out hiding the body of the rocket. The flame\nlicked out while the rocket was still over a hundred feet in the air.\n\nProchaska cursed softly. The rocket seemed riveted to the black sky for\na fraction of a second before it began to fall. Faster ... faster. It\nsmashed into the lunar surface, lost from sight.\n\n\"Exit Baker,\" Prochaska said woodenly. Quietly Crag got on the\ncommunicator and reported to Gotch. There was a brief silence when he\nhad finished.\n\nFinally Gotch said, \"Drone Charlie will be launched on schedule. We'll\nhave to reassess our logistics, though. Maybe we'd better knock off the\nidea of the airlock-in-the-gully idea and shoot along extra oxygen and\nsupplies instead. How does the meteorite problem look?\"\n\n\"Lousy,\" said Crag irritably. \"We've had a scary near miss. I wouldn't\nbet on being able to survive too long in the open. Again there was a\nsilence.\n\n\"You'll have to,\" Gotch said slowly, \"unless you can salvage Baker's\ncargo.\"\n\n\"We'll check that.\"\n\n\"You might investigate the possibility of covering the Aztec with ash.\"\n\n\"Sure ... sure,\" Crag broke in. \"Good idea. I'll have the boys break out\nthe road grader immediately.\"\n\n\"Don't be facetious,\" Gotch reprimanded. \"We have a problem to work\nout.\"\n\n\"You're telling me!\"\n\n\"In the meantime, try and clean up that other situation.\"\n\nBy \"other situation\" Crag knew he was referring to the sabotage. Sure,\nbe an engineer, intelligence agent, spaceman and superman, all rolled\ninto one. He wrinkled his face bitterly. Still he had to admire the\nColonel's tenacity. He was a man determined to conquer the moon.\n\n\"Will do,\" Crag said finally. \"In the meantime we'll look Baker over.\nThere might be some salvage.\"\n\n\"Do that,\" the Colonel said crisply. He cut off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"Max Prochaska was a real well-liked boy,\" Mrs. Arthur Bingham said\nfirmly, \"friendly with everyone in town. Of course, Vista was just a\nsmall place then,\" she added reminiscently. \"Not like now, especially\nsince the helicopter factory moved in. I do declare, a soul wouldn't\nrecognize the place any longer, with all the housing tracts and the new\nsupermarket--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the agent interjected, \"but about Max Prochaska.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\" Mrs. Bingham bit her lip reflectively. \"My husband\nalways said Max would go places. I wish he could have lived to see it.\"\nFor just a moment her eyes brimmed wetly, then she blew her nose, wiping\nthem in the process. The agent waited until she had composed herself.\n\n\"Little Max--I always think of him as Little Max,\" she explained--\"was\nsmart and pleasant, real well liked at school. And he _always_ attended\nchurch.\" She stressed the word always.\n\n\"Just think, now they say he's on the moon.\" Her eyes fixed the agent\nwith interest \"You'd think he'd get dizzy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe agent almost enjoyed tracing Max Prochaska's history, it was a neat,\nwrapped-up job, one that moved through a regular sequence. Teacher ...\nminister ... family doctor ... druggist ... scoutmaster ... athletic\ndirector--all the ties a small-town boy makes and retains. Everything\nwas clear-cut, compact. Records, deeds, acquaintances--all in one handy\npackage. The memory of a man who grew up in a small town persisted,\nborne in the minds of people whose worlds were small. The Vista paper\nhad obligingly carried Prochaska's biography, right on the front page,\nunder the headline: VISTAN LANDS ON MOON. The leading local drugstore\nwas featuring a Prochaska sundae and the Mayor of the town had\nproclaimed MAX PROCHASKA week.\n\nClearly, Vista was proud of its native son, but not nearly as proud as\nthe elderly couple who still tended a chicken ranch on the outskirts of\ntown.\n\n\"Max is a good boy,\" Mrs. Prochaska said simply. Her husband beamed\nagreement.\n\nOn the surface, Prochaska's record seemed clean--a good student,\nwell-liked, the usual array of girls, and nothing much in the way of\npeccadillos you could hang a hat on. The agent's last view of the town\nwas a sign at the city limits: VISTA--THE HOME OF MAX PROCHASKA.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrone Baker looked a complete loss. It had smashed tail down onto the\nash covered plain about four miles to the southeast of the Aztec, off\nthe eastern lip of the curved crescent Prochaska had dubbed \"Backbone\nRidge.\"\n\nCrag calculated that the positions of Bandit, the drone and their own\nrocket roughly formed an equilateral triangle on the floor of the\ncrater. The lower section of the rocket was crushed, its hull split\nlengthwise.\n\nCrag and Larkwell studied the scene from a small knoll. The drone lay in\na comparatively level area about thirty feet from the edge of a deep\nfissure, careened at a steep angle from the vertical. Only its tail\nimbedded into the ground kept it from toppling.\n\n\"Might as well have a closer look,\" Larkwell said finally. Crag nodded\nand beckoned Richter, who was waiting at the bottom of the knoll. Since\nthe sabotage incident he had split the crew into two sections which\nvaried according to task. Richter was used by either section as needed.\nIt wasn't an arrangement that Crag liked but he didn't feel it wise, or\nsafe, to allow anyone the privilege of privacy.\n\nRichter circled the base of the knoll and met them. When they reached\nthe rocket, Larkwell circled it several times, studying it from all\nangles.\n\n\"We might come out pretty well,\" he said finally. His voice carried a\ndubious note. He lifted his head and contemplated the rocket again.\n\"Maybe some of the cargo rode through.\"\n\n\"We hope,\" Crag said.\n\n\"I wouldn't bank too much on it.\"\n\n\"Think we might get inside?\"\n\nLarkwell said decisively: \"Not this boy. Not until we pull the nose\ndown. This baby's ready to topple.\"\n\nThey were discussing their next move when Prochaska came in on the\ninterphone: \"Alpine wants the dope on Baker.\"\n\nDamn Alpine, Crag thought moodily. He contemplated the rocket. \"Tell 'em\nit's still here.\" All at once he felt depressed. Strain, he told\nhimself. Since blast-off his life had been a succession of climaxes,\neach a little rougher than the one preceding. Not that he was alone in\nhis reactions. His mind switched to Nagel. The oxygen man had become\nsullen, irritable, almost completely withdrawn from the group. He was,\nCrag thought, a lonely, miserable man. Even Larkwell was beginning to\nshow the affects of their struggle to survive. His normal easygoing\nmanner was broken by periods of surliness. Only Prochaska had managed to\nmaintain his calm approach to life, but the effects were telling\nphysically. His face was a mask of parchment drawn tightly over bone,\naccentuating his tired hollow eyes.\n\nBut Richter seemed to be thriving. Why not? He was a doomed man given a\nfresh reprieve on life, with no responsibilities to burden his\nexistence. He was on a gravy train for the time being. Still, Richter\nwas in an unenviable spot. Nagel was openly hostile toward him. His\ndemeanor and looks were calculated to tell the German he was an\nundesirable intruder. Larkwell's attitude was one of avoidance. He\nsimply acted as if the German were not on the moon. When in the course\nof work it became necessary to give Richter an order, he did it with a\nshort surly bark. Prochaska concealed whatever feeling he had toward the\nGerman. No, he thought, Richter's lot wasn't easy.\n\nHe tried to push the mood aside. It wouldn't push. He checked his\noxygen, and decided to swing over to Bandit before returning. The\nsooner they got started on the salvage job, the better. He communicated\nhis plan to the others.\n\nLarkwell protested, \"Getting ready to open this baby's more important.\nWe'll never get started on the airlock fooling around this god forsaken\ndesert.\"\n\n\"Well get to that, too,\" Crag promised, fighting to keep his temper\nunder control. \"By going from here we'll save a couple of miles over\nhaving to make a special trip.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" the construction boss said truculently.\n\nCrag nodded stiffly and started toward the enemy rocket, now lost to\nview behind intervening rock formations. By unspoken agreement Larkwell\nfell in at the rear, leaving Richter sandwiched between them. The German\nlived constantly under the scrutiny of one or another of the crew. Crag\nintended to keep it that way.\n\nThe trip was more difficult than he had anticipated. Twice they were\nforced to detour around deep fissures. Before they had gone very far\nCrag's radiation counter came to life. He made a note of the spot\nthinking that later they would map the boundaries of the radioactive\narea. Once or twice he checked his course with Prochaska. His oxygen\nmeter told him they would have to hurry when they topped a low knoll of\nglazed rock and came upon the ship.\n\nHe stopped and turned, watching Richter. If he had expected any show of\nemotion he was disappointed. His face was impassive. It gave Crag the\nfeeling that he wasn't really seeing the rocket--that he was looking far\nbeyond, into nothingness. His eyes behind the face plate were vacuous\npools.\n\n\"We didn't have time to bury your companions,\" Crag said\nmatter-of-factly. He indicated the rocket with a motion of his head and\nhis voice turned cruel:\n\n\"They're still in there.\"\n\nRichter's expression remained unchanged. \"It doesn't make much\ndifference here,\" he said finally. He turned and faced Crag.\n\n\"One thing you should understand. They,\" he swept his arm toward Bandit,\n\"were the military.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\nRichter said stiffly: \"I am a scientist.\"\n\n\"Who destroyed our drone thinking it was us.\" They faced each other\nacross the bleak lunar desert. The German's eyes had become blue\nfires--azure coals leaping into flame.\n\n\"It makes no difference what you think,\" he said after a moment. \"My\nconscience is clear.\"\n\n\"Nuts.\" Larkwell spat the word with disgust. Richter shrugged and turned\nback toward the rocket. Crag looked at him with varying emotions. One\nthing was sure, he thought. Richter was a cool customer. He had seen new\ndepths in his blue eyes when they had faced each other. They were hard\neyes, ablaze with ice ... the eyes of a fanatic--or a saint. He pushed\nthe thought aside.\n\nProchaska came in on the phones to inquire about their oxygen. Crag\nchecked, chagrined to find that it was too low to spend more than a few\nminutes at the rocket. He opened the arms locker, thinking he would have\nto get rid of the weapons. They could be dangerous in the wrong hands.\nHe had been unable to carry them back the first trip. Then he had\nregarded them as something totally useless on the moon. Now he wasn't so\nsure.\n\nHe hurriedly studied the space cabin, seeking the information Gotch had\nrequested. The floor and walls were heavily padded with some foam\nmaterial--standard procedure to absorb vibration and attenuate noise.\nAside from the controls, there were no projecting metal surfaces or hard\ncorners ... the view ports were larger ... acceleration pads smaller,\nthicker. All in all, the cabins of the two rockets were quite similar.\nHe was examining the contents of the supply cabinets when Larkwell\nreminded him of their diminishing oxygen supply. They hurriedly\nplundered Bandit of six oxygen cylinders and started back across\nArzachel's desolate plain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrag arbitrarily broke the lunar day into twenty-four hour periods to\ncorrespond with earth time. Twelve hours were considered as \"day,\" the\nremaining time as \"night.\" He set up regular communication periods in\norder to schedule their activities. Under the arrangement Alpine came in\npromptly at exactly a half-hour before breakfast--0500 by earth\nclock--and again following the evening meal. Prochaska monitored the\nchannel during the workday to cover possible urgent messages. The\nschedule allowed a twelve-hour work period during the day and a\nthree-hour work period following the evening meal, from 7:00 to 10:00.\nThe communication periods quickly deteriorated into routine sessions--a\ngood omen to Crag--but Gotch kept his finger in the pie. Crag had the\nsatisfaction of knowing he was available around the clock. Consequently,\nwhen the communicator came to life midway through the regular\ntwelve-hour work period, he knew something was brewing--something he\nwasn't going to like. So did Prochaska. His voice, when he called Crag\nto the communicator, spelled trouble.\n\nCrag used the ear microphones for privacy and acknowledged the call with\na distinct feeling of unease. As he had expected, the caller was Gotch.\n\n\"Drone Charlie was launched at 0600,\" he told Crag. \"We'll feed you the\ndata on the regular channels.\" There was a brief silence. \"This one's\ngot to make it,\" he added significantly.\n\nCrag said stonily: \"We'll do our best.\"\n\n\"I know you will, Commander. I have absolutely no fear on that score.\nHow's everything going?\" The twangy voice across the abyss of space took\non a solicitous tone that set his nerves on edge. Something's\nwrong--something bad, he thought. The Colonel sounded like a doctor\nasking a dying patient how he felt.\n\n\"Okay, everything seems in hand. We've got the ship in good shape and\nLarkwell thinks we might fare pretty well with the drone. It might be in\nbetter shape than we first thought.\"\n\n\"Good, good, glad to hear it. We need a silver lining once in a while,\neh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I'm fairly certain you didn't call just to cheer me up,\" Crag\nsaid dryly. \"What's on your mind?\" The silence came again, a little\nlonger this time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\"You're in trouble.\" Gotch spoke like a man carefully choosing his\nwords. \"Intelligence informs us that another rocket's been fired from\neast of the Caspian. BuNav's got a track on it.\"\n\nCrag waited.\n\n\"There are two possibilities,\" Gotch continued. \"The first and most\nlogical assumption is that it's manned. We surmise that from the fact\nthat their first manned rocket was successful--that is, as far as\nreaching the moon is concerned. The assumption is further borne out by\nits trajectory and rate of acceleration.\" His voice fell off.\n\n\"And the second possibility?\" Crag prompted.\n\n\"Warhead,\" Gotch said succinctly. \"Intelligence informs us that the\nenemy is prepared to blow Arzachel off the face of the moon if they fail\nto take it over. And they have failed--so far.\" Crag tossed the idea\naround in his mind.\n\nHe said fretfully, \"I doubt if they could put a warhead down on\nArzachel. That takes some doing. Hell, it's tough enough to monitor one\nin from here, let alone smack from earth.\"\n\n\"I think you're right, but they can try.\" Gotch's voice became brisk.\n\"Here's the dope as we see it. We think the rocket contains a landing\nparty for the purpose of establishing a moon base. In Arzachel,\nnaturally, because that's where the lode is.\"\n\n\"More to the point, you expect an attack on Pickering Base,\" Crag\ninterjected.\n\n\"Well, yes, I think that is a reasonable assumption....\"\n\nCrag weighed the information. Gotch was probably right. A nuclear\nexplosion on the moon would be detected on earth. That was the dangerous\ncourse--the shot that could usher in World War III and perhaps a new\ncave era.\n\nAttack by a landing party seemed more logical. They batted ideas back\nand forth. The Colonel suggested that just before the landing phase of\nRed Dog--the code name assigned the new rocket--Crag post armed guards\nat some point covering the Aztec.\n\n\"Might as well get some use out of Bandit's automatic weapons,\" Gotch\ndryly concluded.\n\nCrag disagreed. He didn't think it likely that any attack would take the\nform of a simple armed assault. \"That would give us time to get off a\nmessage,\" he argued. \"They can't afford that.\"\n\nGotch pointed out that neither could they launch a missile while still\nin space. \"A homing weapon couldn't differentiate between Aztec, Baker\nand Bandit,\" he said.\n\n\"But they'd still have to have some sure fire quick-kill method,\" Crag\ninsisted.\n\n\"You may be right. Have you a better plan?\"\n\nCrag did, and outlined it in some detail. Gotch listened without comment\nuntil he had finished.\n\n\"Could work,\" he said finally. \"However, it's going to shoot your\nschedule, even if you could do it.\"\n\n\"Why can't we?\"\n\n\"You're not supermen, Commander,\" he said tersely. \"The psychiatrists\nhere inform us that your crew--as individuals--should be near the\nbreaking point. We know the cumulative strain. To be truthful with you,\nwe've been getting gray hair over that prospect.\"\n\n\"Nuts to the psychiatrists,\" Crag declared with a certainty he didn't\nfeel. \"Men don't break when their survival depends on their sanity.\"\n\n\"No?\" The single word came across the void, soft and low.\n\n\"We can do it,\" Crag persisted.\n\n\"All right, I agree with the plan. I think you're wrong but you're the\nCommander in the field.\" His voice was flat. \"Good luck.\" He cut off\nabruptly.\n\nCrag looked at the silent panel for a moment. Another problem, another\nsolution required. Maybe Gotch was right. Maybe they'd all wind up as\ncandidates for the laughing academy--if they lived long enough. The\nthought didn't cheer him. Well, he'd better get moving. There was a lot\nto be done. He looked up and saw the question in Prochaska's eyes. Might\nas well tell him, he thought.\n\nHe repeated the information Gotch had given, together with his plan.\nProchaska listened quietly, nodding from time to time. When he finished,\nthey discussed the pros and cons of Crag's proposed course of action.\nProchaska thought it would work. In the end they decided to pursue the\nplan without telling the others the full story. It might be the breaking\npoint, especially for Nagel, and they would be needing a good oxygen man\nin the coming days. Crag got on the interphone and called Larkwell, who\nwas working in the tail section with the others.\n\n\"Judging from what you've seen of Bandit, how long would it take to make\nit livable as crew quarters?\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked querulously.\n\n\"I haven't time to go into that now,\" Crag said evenly. \"Just give me\nyour best estimate.\"\n\n\"You can't make it livable. It's hot.\"\n\n\"Not that hot. You've just got the radiation creeps. Let's have the\nestimate.\"\n\nLarkwell considered a moment. \"There's quite a weld job on the hull,\nassuming we could get the necessary patch metal from Bandit. We'd have\nto haul one helluva lot of gear across that damned desert--\"\n\n\"How long?\" Crag cut in.\n\n\"Well, three days, at least. But that's a minimum figure.\"\n\n\"That's the figure you'll have to meet,\" Crag promised grimly. \"Start\nnow. Use Nagel and Richter. Load up the gear you'll need and get in a\ntrip before chow.\"\n\n\"Now?\" Larkwell's voice was incredulous. \"What about winding up this job\nfirst? The airlock is damned important.\"\n\n\"Drop it,\" Crag said briefly. There was silence at the other end of the\ninterphone.\n\n\"Okay,\" the construction boss grumbled finally.\n\nCrag suggested that Prochaska make the first trip with them to look over\nBandit's electronic gear. He would need to know what repairs and\nmodifications would be necessary to make it usable. The Chief was\ndelighted. It would mark the first time he'd been out of the space cabin\nsince the day of their landing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrag watched them leave through the port. It was impossible to tell the\ncrew members apart in their bulky garments. The extra oxygen and the\ntools Larkwell had selected gave them an odd shambling gait, despite the\nlow gravity. They plodded in single file, winding slowly across the\nplain. The thought struck him that they resembled grotesque life forms\nfrom some alien planet. For just a moment he felt sorry, and a trifle\nguilty, over assigning Nagel to the trip. The oxygen man was already in\na state of perpetual fatigue. Still, he couldn't allow anyone the luxury\nof rest. Work was in the cards--grueling, slavish toil if they were to\nsurvive.\n\nIt struck Crag that this was a moment of great risk. Of the four figures\nplodding toward Bandit, one was an enemy ... one a saboteur. Yet, what\ncould either accomplish by striking now? Nothing! _Not while I live_, he\nthought. Strangely enough, Richter bothered him more than the saboteur.\nThere was a quality about the man he couldn't decipher, an armor he\ncouldn't penetrate. It occurred to him that, outwardly at least, Richter\nwas much like Prochaska--quiet, calm, steady. He performed the tasks\nassigned him without question ... evinced no hostility, no resentment.\nHe was seemingly oblivious to Nagel's barbs and Larkwell's occasional\nsurly rebuffs. On the face of the record he was an asset--a work horse\nwho performed far more labor than Nagel.\n\nHe decided he couldn't write the German off as a factor to be\ncontinually weighed--weighed and watched. He was no ordinary man. Of\nthat he was sure. Richter's presence on the enemy's first moon rocket\nwas ample testimony of his stature. What were his thoughts? His plans?\nWhat fires burned behind his placid countenance? Crag wished he knew.\nOne thing was certain. He could never lower his guard. Not for a second.\n\nHe sighed and turned away from the viewport. A lot of data had piled up.\nHe'd give Alpine a little work to do to get Gotch off his neck. He\nreached for the communicator thinking of Ann. Probably got someone else\nlined up by now, he thought sourly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWork on Bandit progressed slowly. Nagel dragged through each successive\nwork shift on the verge of exhaustion. Crag expected him to collapse\nmomentarily. His disintegration took him further and further from the\ngroup. He ate silently, with eyes averted. He didn't protest the\narduous hours, but the amount of work he performed was negligible.\nLarkwell maintained his stamina but had become more quiet in the\nprocess. He seldom smiled ... never joked. Occasionally he was truculent\nor derisive, referring to Bandit as the \"Commander's hot box.\"\n\nRichter remained impersonal and aloof, but performed his assigned tasks\nwithout apparent resentment. Crag noticed that he stayed as far from\nLarkwell as possible, perhaps fearing violence from the burly\nconstruction boss. Prochaska, alone, maintained a cheerful exterior--for\nwhich Crag was thankful.\n\nHe was watching them now--the evening of the last day of Larkwell's\nthree-day estimate--returning from the Bandit. The four figures were\nstrung out over half a mile. He regarded that as a bad omen. They no\nlonger worked as a crew, but as separate individuals, each in his\nseparate world, with exception of Prochaska. He turned away from the\nport with the familiar feeling that time was running out, and mentally\nreviewed what remained to be done.\n\nMaking Bandit habitable was a must. There still remained the arduous\ntask of transferring their belongings and gear to Bandit. Drone Baker\nhad to be toppled and her cargo salvaged. Then there was Drone Charlie,\nat present just a minute speck somewhere in the great void between earth\nand her moon; but in somewhat less than forty-eight hours it would\nrepresent tons of metal hurtling over the rim of Arzachel. This time\nthey couldn't fumble the ball. The building of the airlock in the rill\nloomed in the immediate future--an oppressive shadow that caused him no\nend of worry. There were other problems, too--like the item of Red\nDog ... the possible battle for control of the moon.\n\nRed Dog, in particular, had become the prime shadow darkening Arzachel's\nashy plains. He thought about the emotional deterioration which had laid\nan iron grip over the expedition and wondered if they could hang on\nthrough the rough days ahead. All in all, the task of colonizing the\nmoon appeared an extremely formidable one. He shook off his\napprehensions and began planning his next step.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat evening Crag knocked off the usual three hour work period following\nevening chow. Nagel tumbled onto his pad and was asleep almost\ninstantly. His breathing was a harsh rasp. At Crag's suggestion\nProchaska took the watch until midnight. Crag stood guard the remainder\nof the night to allow Nagel and Larkwell a full night's rest.\n\nWhile the others slept, Crag brooded at the port. Once he ran his hand\nover his face, surprised at the hardness. All bone and no flesh, he\nthought. He looked toward the north wall of Arzachel.\n\nIn a few short hours Drone Charlie would come blazing over the rim, and\nRed Dog snapping at its heels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"Adam Crag was not a God-fearing man,\" the minister stated. His tone\nimplied that Crag had been just the opposite. \"Not a bit like his\nparents. The best family guidance in the world, yet he quit Sunday\nschool almost before he got started. I doubt that he's ever been to\nchurch since.\"\n\nHe looked archly at the agent. \"Perhaps a godless world like the moon is\njust retribution.\"\n\nA garage mechanic, a junk dealer and the proprietor of a tool shop had a\nlot to say about Adam Crag. So did the owner of a small private\nairport. They remembered him as a boy with an insatiable appetite for\ntearing cars apart and converting them to what the junk dealer termed\n\"supersonic jalopies.\"\n\nMany people in El Cajon remembered Adam Crag. Strangely enough, his\nteachers all the way back through grade school had little difficulty in\nrecalling his antics and attitudes. An elementary teacher explained it\nby saying, \"He was that kind of a boy.\"\n\nThe family doctor had the most to say about Adam. He had long since\nretired, a placid seventyish man who had elected to pass his last years\nin the same house, in an older section of the town, in which he'd been\nborn.\n\nHe sat swinging and talking, reminiscing about \"the growing up of young\nAdam,\" as he put it. The agent had made himself at home on the front\nsteps, listening. The doctor's comments were little short of being an\neulogy.\n\nHe finished and was silent, tapping a black briar pipe against his hand\nwhile he contemplated the agent with eyes which had long since ceased to\nsee.\n\n\"One other thing,\" he added finally. \"Adam was sure a heller with the\ngirls.\"\n\nThe agent started to comment that Crag's dossier looked like the roll\ncall of a girl's dormitory but refrained. He didn't want to prejudice\nthe testimony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nZero hour on the plains of Arzachel. The sun, an intolerably brilliant\nball pasted against the ebony sky, had started its drop toward the\nhorizon. The shadows on the plain were lengthening, harbingers of the\nbitter two-weeks-long night to come. They crept out from the sheer wall\nof the crater, reaching to engulf Pickering Base with icy fingers.\n\nCrag and Prochaska were alone, now, in the stripped cabin of the Aztec.\nNagel and Richter, under Larkwell's command, had departed for Bandit an\nhour earlier with the last of their supplies. Crag disliked splitting\nthe crew but saw no alternative. He had to gamble. The element of\ncertainty, the ability to predict, the expectations of logic--all these\nhad vanished, swept away by the vagaries of chance. They could do only\nso much. Beyond that their fate was pawn to the chaotic cross fires of\nhuman elements pitted against the architecture of the cosmos. They were\npuppets in the last lottery of probability.\n\nProchaska broke the silence: \"It's going to be close.\"\n\nCrag's eyes remained riveted to the instruments. Drone Charlie and Red\nDog were plunging through space separated by a scant half-hour's flight\ntime. Despite the drone's long launch lead, the gap between the two\nrockets had been narrowed to a perilous point. Drone Charlie was\ndecelerating rapidly, her braking rockets flaring spasmodically to slow\nher headlong flight.\n\n\"We'd better get into our suits,\" Crag said finally. \"We want to get out\nof this baby the second Charlie lets down.\"\n\nProchaska nodded. They left their suits unpressurized for the time being\nto allow full mobility. In the moments ahead Prochaska, in particular,\ncouldn't afford to be hampered by the rigidity the suit possessed when\nunder pressure.\n\nThey turned back to the control panel. Charlie was hurtling over\nAlphons, dropping toward the bleak lunar landscape with incredible\nspeed. The mechanical voice from Alpine droned a stream of data. There\nwas a rapid exchange of information between Prochaska and Alpine. At its\nconclusion he began taking over control of the drone. Crag watched\ntensely. Prochaska's fingers, even though encased in the heavy suit\nmaterial, moved with certainty. In a little while he spoke without\nlooking up.\n\n\"Got it,\" he said laconically. He studied the instruments, then his\nfingers sought the buttons controlling Charlie's forward braking\nrockets.\n\nCrag thought: _This is it._ Within scant moments the drone had covered\nthe sky over the tangled land lying between Alphons and Arzachel. It\nswept over the brimming cliffs at a scant two thousand feet. He saw the\nrocket through the forward ports. White vapor flared from its nose\nrockets. The Chief had it under full deceleration. The cloud of vapor\ncovered its body. Prochaska moved the steering control and the rocket\nslanted upward at ever-increasing angle of climb. Crag strained his neck\nto keep it in sight. He thought its rate of climb was too rapid but\nProchaska seemed unperturbed. His calm approach to the problem of\nlanding the drone gave Crag renewed confidence.\n\nAll at once, it seemed, Drone Charlie was hanging high in the sky, a\ntapered needle miraculously suspended in the heavens. Then it began\ndropping ... dropping. Bursts of smoke and white vapor shot from its\ntail jets, becoming continuous as the rocket hurtled toward the plain.\nThe drone was lost to sight in its own clouds, but he charted its\nprogress by the vapor spurts at its lower edge. Prochaska was draining\nthe tail braking jets of every ounce of energy. Suddenly the rocket gave\nthe illusion of hanging in mid-air. The gap between it and the stark\nterrain below seemed to have stopped closing. Crag half expected the\nblasting stern tubes to begin pushing the drone back into the sky.\nBut ... no! It was moving down again, slowly.\n\nProchaska moved another control. A servo-mechanism within the rocket\nstirred to life and a spidery metal network moved out from its tail\nhousing. The drone dropped steadily, ever slower, and finally settled.\nThe shock-absorbing frame folded, was crushed. At the same instant\nProchaska silenced its rockets. It settled down, its tail tubes pushed\ninto the plain's powdery ash scarcely a mile from the Aztec.\n\n\"Perfect.\" Prochaska sounded pleased with himself. His thin face broke\ninto a satisfied smile.\n\n\"Nice going,\" Crag agreed. \"Now let's get out of this trap.\"\n\nHis eyes lingered for an instant on the analog. Red Dog had already\ncleared Ptolemaeus. He snapped his face plate shut, clicked on the\ninterphone and turned the oxygen valve. His suit began to swell and grow\nrigid against his body. When they were pressurized, he opened the hatch\nand they clambered out onto the plain. He closed the hatch behind them\nand struck off in the direction of Bandit with the Chief at his heels.\n\nThey moved as rapidly as possible. Their feet in the heavy insulated\nspace boots kicked up small fountains of dust which dropped as quickly\nas they rose. From time to time Crag looked back toward the brimming\ncliffs. Prochaska plodded head down. His quickened breathing in the\ninterphones sounded harsh to Crag. Plainly the long hours of monitoring\nthe Aztec's instruments had made him soft. The microphone in his helmet\ncame to life. It was Larkwell.\n\n\"Red Dog's cleared the rim,\" he told them.\n\nCrag glanced back. His eyes caught the wispish trail of white vapor high\nabove the cliffs before he saw the rocket itself. It was already in\nvertical attitude, letting down amid a cloud of white vapor from its\nstern braking rockets.\n\n\"All hands disconnect their interphones,\" he commanded. \"From here on\nout we operate in silence.\" The Red Dog interphone system might or might\nnot be on the same band they used. He wasn't about to take that risk.\n\n\"Okay,\" Larkwell acknowledged. \"We're shutting off.\"\n\nCrag remembered that the German's interphones were still connected. Slip\none. He decided to leave his own open--at least he'd be forewarned if\nanyone tried to alert the Red Dog crew. He turned back toward the\nrocket. Red Dog was dropping about two or three miles from the Aztec in\nthe direction of the wrecked Baker.\n\nWhite smoke and flame poured from its stern tubes. It slowed visibly as\nit neared the lunar surface. He thought that a plumb bob dropped through\nthe long axis of the rocket would form a right angle with the surface\nof Arzachel. Pilot's good, he thought. He watched until it touched down\nteetering on its stern tubes for a moment before coming to rest; then he\nturned and hurried to overtake Prochaska.\n\nThe Chief's face behind his mask was covered with perspiration. He\npanted heavily. Crag beckoned him to follow and moved behind a low swale\nof rock where they would be safe from detection. The nose of Bandit\njutted into the sky about a mile ahead of them. He motioned toward it,\ngesturing for Prochaska to go on. The Chief nodded understanding and\nstruck off.\n\nCrag turned and began climbing a low rocky ridge that now lay between\nhim and Red Dog. He stopped just below its crest and searched for a safe\nvantage point. To his right a serrated rock structure extended up over\nthe backbone of the ridge. He angled toward it, then followed the\noutcropping to a point where he could see the plain beyond. Red Dog had\nits tail planted in the ash about three miles distant.\n\nMinute figures milled at its base, small blobs of movement against the\ncrater floor. No sounds broke the silence of Crag's open interphones. He\ntook this as a sign that the Red Dog sets operated on a different band.\nBut he couldn't be sure. The tremendous advantage of having\ncommunication with his own men must be discarded.\n\nHis vigil was rewarded a few moments later when the blobs around Red\nDog's base began moving in the direction of the Aztec. It struck him\nthat they couldn't see the rocket from their present position due to\nsmall intervening hillocks, although both Baker and Charlie were clearly\nvisible. He decided the Aztec's horizontal position had tipped them to\nits identity while they were still space-borne. One of the Red Dog\ncrewmen, obviously the leader, drew ahead of his companions. The other\ntwo seemed to be struggling with some object they carried between them.\nThey moved close together, halting from time to time. He returned his\ngaze to the rocket, conjecturing that another crewman would have\nremained behind. If so, he was in the space cabin. The ship seemed\nlifeless. The landing party approached a small ridge overlooking the\nAztec, bringing them closer to his lookout.\n\nHe saw that the two men following the leader were having difficulty with\ntheir burden. They walked slowly, uncertainly, pausing from time to\ntime. The lead man started up the rocky knoll overlooking the Aztec. His\nmovements were slow, wary. He crouched near the top of the ridge,\nscanning the plain beyond before waving to his companions to follow. The\ngesture told Crag that their interphones were disconnected. The crewmen\nnear the base of the knoll started climbing, moving with extreme\ndifficulty. He watched them, wondering, until they reached the leader.\nThey stood for a moment scouting the plain, then two of the men crouched\nover the burden they had lugged up the knoll.\n\nA weapon, Crag guessed. He tried to discern its shape but failed. A few\nmoments later one of the men stepped back. A puff of white rose from the\nknoll. A trail of vapor shot toward the Aztec. A portable rocket\nlauncher! His eyes tracked the missile's flight. The vapor trail\nterminated at its target. An instant later the Aztec disintegrated.\nBlack chunks of the rocket hurtled into the lunar skies, becoming lost\nto sight. Within seconds only a jagged few feet of broken torn metal\nmarked the site of man's first successful landing on the moon. _Wow,\nwhat a weapon_, he thought. It didn't merely push a hole in the Aztec.\nIt disintegrated it, completely. That was one for Gotch. He filed the\nthought away and watched.\n\nThe figures on the knoll searched the scene for a long time. Finally\nthey turned and started back, carrying the rocket launcher with them.\nThe act of saving the weapon told him that Red Dog carried more rockets\nthan just the single shot fired--a disconcerting thought.\n\nHe cautiously withdrew from his post and picked his way down the ridge\ntoward Bandit, moving as rapidly as the rough terrain permitted.\nEverything now depended on the next move of the Red Dog's crew, he\nthought. One thing was certain--there would be no quarter shown. The\nruthless destruction of the Aztec had set the pattern for the coming\nbattle of Arzachel. It was a declaration of war with all rules of human\nwarfare discarded. Well, that was okay with him.\n\nHe was breathing heavily by the time he reached a spot overlooking\nBandit. Nagel had decompressed the cabin and they were waiting for him\nwith the hatch open. He crossed the clearing and a moment later was in\nthe space cabin. He watched the gauge until it was safe to cut off his\nsuit pressure and open his face plate. He looked at Richter; his face\nwas blank. Tersely, then, he related what had happened.\n\n\"I sort of expected that,\" Prochaska said quietly when he had finished.\n\"It was the logical way.\"\n\n\"Logical to attempt to murder men?\" Nagel asked bitterly.\n\n\"Entirely logical,\" Crag interjected. \"The stakes are too big for a few\nhuman lives to matter. At least we've been warned.\"\n\nHe turned to Prochaska. \"Disconnect Richter's mikes until this show's\nover.\"\n\nThe Chief nodded. Richter stood quietly by while his lip microphone was\ndisconnected and withdrawn from the helmet. Nagel's face showed\nsatisfaction at the act, but Larkwell's expression was wooden.\n\nCrag said, \"Defense of Bandit will be under Prochaska's command.\" He\nlooked grimly at his second-in-command. \"Your fort has one automatic\nrifle. Make it count if you have to use it.\" The Chief nodded.\n\nLarkwell spoke up, \"How about you?\"\n\n\"I'll be scouting with the other automatic rifle. Stay in your suits and\nkeep ready. If they start to bring up the rocket launcher I'll signal.\nIf that happens you'll have to get out of here, pronto. You'd better\ncheck your oxygen,\" he added as an afterthought.\n\n\"If they think we're dead ducks they won't be toting the launcher,\"\nProchaska said.\n\n\"We hope.\" Crag exchanged his oxygen cylinder for a fresh one, then\nchecked one of the automatic rifles, slipping two extra clips in his\nbelt. On second thought he hooked a spare oxygen cylinder to the back\nstraps. He nodded to Nagel, snapped his face plate shut and pressurized\nhis suit. When the cabin was decompressed, he opened the hatch, scanning\nthe knoll carefully before descending to the plain. He struck off toward\nthe ridge overlooking Red Dog. The ground on this side of the spur was\nfairly flat and he made good time, but was panting heavily by the time\nhe reached his lookout point on the crest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nCrag sighted the Red Dog party immediately--three figures plodding in\nsingle file toward Drone Baker. He saw with satisfaction that they had\ndiscarded the rocket launcher. He took that as a sign they believed the\nAztec crew dead. He found a halfway comfortable sitting position, and\nsettled back to await developments.\n\nThe distant figures moved across the plain with maddening slowness. From\ntime to time he returned his eyes to the enemy rocket. It showed no\nsigns of life. Once he debated taking the gamble of trying to reach it,\nbut as quickly discarded the idea. Caught on the open plain and he'd be\na gone gosling.\n\nHe waited.\n\nAfter what seemed a long while, the invaders reached a point overlooking\nDrone Baker. One of the figures remained on a small rise overlooking the\ndrone while the other two separated and approached it from different\ndirections. The tactic disquieted him. It indicated that the newcomers\nwere not entirely convinced that they were alone in Crater Arzachel.\n\nAfter another interminably long time, the two figures approaching the\nrocket met at its base. They walked around the rocket several times,\nthen struck out, this time toward Drone Charlie. Their companion left\nhis lookout point and cut across the plain to join them.\n\nCrag squirmed uncomfortably. He was tired and hungry; his muscles ached\nfrom the constriction of the suit. His body was hot and clammy, and\nperspiration from his brow stung his eyes. He sighed, wishing he had a\ncigarette. Strange, he hadn't smoked in over a year but all at once the\nneed for tobacco seemed overwhelming. He pushed the thought aside.\n\nThe invaders were strung out in single file, moving in a direction which\nbrought them closer to his position. He shifted to a point below the\ncrest, moving slowly to avoid detection. Their path crossed his field of\nvision at a distance of about half a mile. At the closest point he saw\nthey carried rifles in shoulder slings. He took this as another\nindication they suspected the presence of survivors. The invaders\nstopped and rested at a point almost opposite him. He fidgeted, trying\nto get his body into a more comfortable position.\n\nFinally they resumed their trek. Before they reached the drone they\nhalted. One man remained in the cover of a spur of rock while the other\ntwo separated and advanced on the drone from different directions. Crag\ncursed under his breath. They certainly weren't going to be sitting\nducks. Perhaps it was just a precaution. Simply good infantry tactics,\nhe told himself, but it still raised a complication.\n\nHe waited. The two invaders closed on the drone, meeting at its base.\nThey evidently decided it was abandoned, for they left within a few\nminutes walking to join their waiting companion. After a short huddle\nthey struck out in the direction of Bandit. This was the move he had\nwaited for.\n\nHe withdrew to the lee side of the ridge and picked his way toward\nBandit as rapidly as possible, taking care not to brush against the\nsharp slivers of rock. He drew near the rocket, thinking that the open\nhatch would be a dead giveaway. Still, there was no alternative. A fort\nwithout a gunport was no fort at all. He climbed to a spot close to the\ncrest of the ridge and peered back in the direction of the invaders,\nstartled to find they were nearer than he had supposed. He hastily\nwithdrew his head, deciding it was too late to warn the others to\nabandon the rocket. If the invaders climbed straight up the opposite\nside of the ridge, they conceivably could catch his crew on the open\nplain. That made another complication.\n\nHe scanned the ridge. Off to his right a series of granite spurs jutted\nfrom the base rock in finger formation. He picked his way toward them,\nthen descended until he found shelter between two rock outcroppings\nwhich gave him a clear view of Bandit. He checked his automatic rifle,\nmoving the control lever to the semi-automatic position. The black\nrectangle that marked Bandit's hatch seemed lifeless.\n\nHe waited.\n\nLong minutes passed. He cursed the eternal silence of the moon which\nrobbed him of the use of his ears. A cannon could fire within an inch of\nhis back and he'd never know it, he thought. He moved his head slightly\nforward from time to time in an effort to see the slope behind him.\nNothing happened. His body itched intolerably from perspiration. He\nreadjusted the suit temperature setting, gaining a slight respite from\nthe heat. All at once he caught movement out of the corner of his face\nplate and involuntarily jerked his head back. He waited a moment, aware\nthat his heart was pounding heavily, then cautiously moved forward. One\nof the invaders was picking his way down the slope in a path that would\ntake him within thirty yards of his position. The man moved slowly,\nhalf-crouched, keeping his rifle cradled across his arm.\n\nThey know, he thought. The open hatch was the giveaway. He anxiously\nsearched Bandit. No sign of life was visible. He gave silent thanks that\nthe invaders had not lugged their rocket launcher with them. Prochaska,\nhe knew, would be watching, crouched in the shadow of the hatch opening\nbehind the heavy automatic rifle. He estimated the distance between the\nbase of the slope and the rocket at 400 yards--close enough for\nProchaska to pick off anyone who ventured onto the plain.\n\nHe waited while the invader passed abreast of him and descended to the\nbase of the plain, taking cover in the rocks. He halted there and looked\nback. A few moments later Crag saw the second of the invaders moving\ndown the slope about a hundred yards beyond his companion. He, too,\nstopped near the base of the rocks. Where was the third man? The same\ntechnique they used before, Crag decided. He would be covering his\ncompanions' advance from the ridge. That made it more difficult.\n\nHe studied the two men at the edge of the plain. It looked like a\nstalemate. They either had to advance or retreat. Their time was\ngoverned by oxygen. If they advanced, they'd be dead pigeons. Prochaska\ncouldn't miss if they chose to cross the clearing. As it was, neither\nside could get a clear shot at the distance separating them, although\nthe invaders could pour a stream of shells into the open hatch. But\nProchaska would be aware of that danger and would have taken refuge to\none side of the opening, he decided. There was another complication.\nThe shells were heavy enough to perforate the rocket. Well, he'd worry\nabout that later. He moved his head for a better view of the invaders.\n\nThe man nearest him had gotten into a prone position and was doing\nsomething with the end of his rifle. Crag watched, puzzled. Suddenly the\nman brought the rifle to his shoulder, and he saw that the end of the\nmuzzle was bulged. Rifle grenade! Damn, they'd brought a regular\narsenal. If he managed to place one in the open hatch, the Bandit crew\nwas doomed. Heedless of the other two Red Dog crewmen, he stepped out\nbetween the shoulders of rock to gain freedom of movement and snapped\nhis own weapon to his shoulder. He had trouble fitting his finger into\nthe trigger guard. The enemy was spraddled on his stomach, legs apart,\nadjusting his body to steady his weapon.\n\nCrag moved his weapon up, bringing the prone man squarely into his\nsights. He squeezed the trigger, feeling the weapon jump against his\npadded shoulder, and leaped back into the protective cover of rock.\nSomething struck his face plate. Splinter of rock, he thought. The\nwatcher on the ridge hadn't been asleep. He dropped to his knees and\ncrawled between the rock spurs to gain a new position. The sharp needle\nfragments under his hands and knees troubled him. One small rip and he'd\nbe the late Adam Crag. He finally reached a place where he could see the\nlower end of the ridge.\n\nThe man he'd shot was a motionless blob on the rocky floor, his arms and\nlegs pulled up in a grotesque fetal position. The vulnerability of human\nlife on the moon struck Crag forcibly. A bullet hole anywhere meant\nsudden violent death. A hit on the finger was as fatal as a shot through\nthe heart. Once air pressure in a suit was lost a man was dead--horribly\ndying within seconds. A pinhole in the suit was enough to do it. His\neyes searched for the dead man's companions. The ridge and plain seemed\nutterly lifeless. Bandit was a black canted monolith rising above the\nplain, seeming to symbolize the utter desolation and silence of Crater\nArzachel. For a moment he was fascinated. The very scene portended\ndeath. It was an eery feeling. He shook it off and waited. He was\nfinally rewarded by movement. A portion of rock near the edge of the\nplain seemed to rise--took shape. The dead man's companion had risen to\na kneeling position, holding his rifle to his shoulder.\n\nCrag raised his gun, wondering if he could hold the man in his sights. A\nhundred and fifty yards to a rifleman clothed in a cumbersome space suit\nseemed a long way. Before he could pull the trigger, the man flung his\narms outward, clawing at his throat for an instant before slumping to\nthe rocks. It took Crag a second to comprehend what had happened.\nProchaska had been ready.\n\nA figure suddenly filled the dark rectangle of Bandit, pointing toward\nthe ridge behind Crag. He apparently was trying to tell him something.\nCrag scanned the ridge. It seemed deserted. He turned toward Bandit and\nmotioned toward his faceplate. The other understood. His interphones\ncrackled to life. Prochaska's voice was welcome.\n\n\"I see him,\" he broke in. \"He's moving up the slope to your right,\ntrying to reach the top of the ridge. Too far for a shot,\" he added.\n\nCrag scrambled into a clearing and scanned the ridge, just in time to\nsee a figure disappear over the skyline. He started up the slope in a\nbeeline for the crest. If he could reach it in time, he might prevent\nthe sniper from crossing the open plain which lay between the ridge and\nRed Dog. Cops and robbers, he thought. Another childhood game had\nsuddenly been recreated, this time on the bleak plain of an airless\nalien crater 240,000 miles from the sunny Southern California lands of\nhis youth.\n\nCrag reached the ridge. The plain on the other side seemed devoid of\nlife. In the distance the squat needle that was Red Dog jutted above\nthe ashy plain, an incongruous human artifact lost on the wastelands of\nthe moon. Only its symmetry distinguished it from the jagged monolithic\nstructures that dotted this end of the crater floor. He searched the\nslope. Movement far down the knoll to his right caught his eye. The\nfugitive was trying to reach a point beyond range of Crag's weapon\nbefore cutting across the plain. He studied the terrain. Far ahead and\nto the left of the invader the crater floor became broken by bizarre\nrock formations of Backbone Ridge--a great half-circle which arced back\ntoward Red Dog. He guessed that the fantastic land ahead was the\nfugitive's goal.\n\nHe cut recklessly down the opposite slope and gained the floor of the\ncrater before turning in the direction he had last seen the invader. He\ncursed himself for having lost sight of him. Momentarily, he slowed his\npace, thinking he was ripe for a bushwhacking job. His eyes roved the\nterrain. No movement, no sign of his quarry. He moved quickly, but\nwarily, attempting to search every inch of the twisted rock formations\ncovering the slope ahead. His eye detected movement off to one side. At\nthe same instant a warning sounded in his brain and he flung himself\ndownward and to the side, hitting the rough ground with a sickening\nthud. He sensed that the action had saved his life. He crawled between\nsome rock outcroppings, hugging the ground until he reached a vantage\npoint overlooking the area ahead. He waited, trying to search the slope\nwithout exposing his position. Minutes passed.\n\nHe tossed his head restlessly. His eyes roved the plain, searching,\nattempting to discern movement. No movement--only a world of still\nlife-forms. The plain--its rocks and rills--stretched before him, barren\nand endless. Strange, he thought, there should be vultures in the sky.\nAnd on the plain creosote bushes, purple sage, cactus ... coyotes and\nrattlesnakes.\n\nBut ... no! This was an other-world desert, one spawned in the fires of\nhell--a never-never land of scalding heat and unbelievable cold. He\nthought it was like a painting by some mad artist. First he had sketched\nin the plain with infinite care--a white-black, monotonous, unbroken\nexpanse. Afterward he had splashed in the rocks, painting with wild\nabandon, heedless of design, form or structure, until the plain was a\nhodgepodge of bizarre formations. They towered, squatted, pierced the\nsky, crawled along the plain like giant serpents--an orgy in rock\nwithout rhyme or reason. Somewhere in the lithic jungle his quarry\nwaited. He would flush him out.\n\nHe thought that the sniper must be getting low on oxygen. He couldn't\nafford to waste time. He had to reach Red Dog soon--if he were to live.\nCrag checked his oxygen meter and began moving forward, conscious that\nthe chase would be governed by his oxygen supply. He'd have to remember\nthat.\n\nHe reached a clearing on the slope just as the sniper disappeared into\nthe rock shadows on the opposite side. He hesitated. Would the pursued\nman be waiting ... covering the trail behind him? He decided not to\nchance crossing it and began skirting around its edge, fretting at the\nminutes wasted. His earphones crackled and Prochaska's voice came, a\nwarning through the vacuum:\n\n\"Nagel says your oxygen must be low.\"\n\nHe glanced at the indicator on his cylinder. Still safe. He studied the\nrocks ahead and told Prochaska:\n\n\"I've got to keep this baby from reaching Red Dog.\"\n\n\"Watch yourself. Don't go beyond the point of no return.\" Prochaska's\nvoice held concern.\n\n\"Stop worrying.\"\n\nCrag pushed around the edge of the clearing with reckless haste. It was\nhard going and he was panting heavily long before he reached the spot\nwhere he had last seen the sniper. He paused to catch his breath. The\nslope fell away beneath him, a miniature kingdom of jagged needle-sharp\nrock. There was no sign of the fugitive. The plain, too, was devoid of\nlife. He descended to the edge of the clearing and picked his way\nthrough the debris of some eon-old geologic catastrophe. Ahead and to\nthe left of the ridge, the plain was broken by shallow rills and weird\nrock outcroppings. Farther out Backbone Ridge began as low mounds of\nstone, becoming twisted black stalagmites hunched incongruously against\nthe floor of the crater, ending as jagged sharp needles of rock curving\nover the plain in a huge arc.\n\nA moment later he caught sight of his quarry. The invader had cut down\nto the edge of the plain, abandoning the protection of the ridge, making\na beeline for the nearest rock extrusion on the floor of the crater. Too\nfar away for a shot. Crag cursed and made a quick judgment, deciding to\nrisk the open terrain in hopes of gaining shelter before the sniper was\naware of his strategy.\n\nHe abandoned the protection of the slope and struck out in a straight\nline toward the distant mounds on the floor of the crater, keeping his\neyes on the fugitive. They raced across the clearing in parallel paths,\nseveral hundred yards apart. The sniper had almost reached the first\nrocks when he glanced back. He saw Crag and put on an extra burst of\nspeed, reaching the first rocks while Crag was still a hundred yards\nfrom the nearest mound. Crag dropped to the ground, thankful that it was\nslightly uneven. At best he'd make a poor target. He crawled, keeping\nhis body low, tossing his head in an effort to shake the perspiration\nfrom his eyes.\n\n\"How you doing, skipper?\" It was Prochaska. Lousy, Crag thought. He\nbriefed him without slowing his pace.\n\nThe ashy plain just in front of him spurted in little fountains of white\ndust. He dropped flat on his belly with a gasp.\n\n\"You all right?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Crag gritted. \"This boy's just using me for target practice.\"\nProchaska's voice became alarmed. He urged him to retreat.\n\n\"We can get them some other way,\" he said.\n\n\"Not if they once get that launcher in operation. I'm moving on.\" There\nwas a moment of silence.\n\n\"Okay, skipper, but watch yourself.\" His voice was reluctant. \"And watch\nyour oxygen.\"\n\n\"Roger.\" He checked his gauge and hurriedly switched to the second\ncylinder. Now he was on the last one. The trick would be to stretch his\noxygen out until the chase was ended--until the man ahead was a corpse.\n\nHe clung to the floor of the crater, searching for shelter. The ground\nrose slightly to his right. He crawled toward the rise, noting that the\nterrain crested high enough to cut his view of the base of the rocks.\nSatisfied that he was no longer visible, he began inching his way toward\nthe nearest mounds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nCrag studied the scene. He lay at one end of the great crescent of rock\nforming Backbone Ridge, the other end of which ended about half a mile\nfrom Red Dog. The floor of the crater between the rocket and the nearest\nrock formations was fairly level and unbroken. The arced formation\nitself was a veritable jungle of rocks of every type--gnarled, twisted\nrock that hugged the ground, jutting black pinnacles piercing the sky,\nbizarre bubble formations which appeared like weird ebony eskimo cities,\nand great fantastic ledges which extruded from the earth at varying\nangles, forming black caves against their bases.\n\nWhole armies could hide there, he thought. Only the fugitive couldn't\nhide. Oxygen was still the paramount issue. He'd have to thread his way\nthrough the terrible rock jungle to the distant tip of the crescent,\nthen plunge across the open plain to the rocket if he hoped to survive.\nThe distance between the horns of the crescent appeared about three\nmiles. He pondered it thoughtfully, then got on the interphones and\noutlined his plan to Prochaska.\n\n\"Okay, I know better than to argue,\" the Chief said dolefully when he\nhad finished. \"But watch your oxygen.\" Damn the oxygen, Crag thought\nirritably. He studied the labyrinth of rock into which his quarry had\nvanished, then rose and started across the plain in a direct line for\nthe opposite tip of the crescent.\n\nThe first moments were the hardest. After that he knew he must be almost\nout of range of the sniper's weapon. Perhaps, even, the other had not\nseen his maneuver. He forced himself into a slow trot, his breath\nwhistling in his ears and his body sodden inside his suit. Perspiration\nstung his eyes, his leg muscles ached almost intolerably, and every\nmovement seemed made on sheer will power. The whimsical thought crossed\nhis mind that Gotch had never painted this side of the picture. Nor was\nit mentioned in the manual of space survival.\n\nHe was thankful that the plain between the two tips of the crescent was\nfairly even. He moved quickly, but it was a long time before he reached\nthe further tip of the crescent. He wondered if he had been observed\nfrom Red Dog. Well, no matter, he thought. He had cut the sniper's sole\navenue of escape. Victory over his quarry was just a matter of time, a\nmatter of waiting for him to appear. He picked a vantage point, a high\nrocky ledge which commanded all approaches to his position. After\nbriefing Prochaska, he settled back to wait, thinking that the fugitive\nmust be extremely low on oxygen.\n\nLong minutes passed. Once or twice he thought he saw movement among the\nrocks and started to lift his rifle; but there was no movement.\nIllusions, he told himself. His eyes were playing him tricks. The\nbizarre sea of rocks confronting him was a study in black and white--the\nintolerable light of sun-struck surfaces contrasting with the stygian\nblackness of the shadows. His eyes began to ache and he shifted them\nfrom time to time to shut out the glare. He was sweating again and there\nwas a dull ache at the back of his head. Precious time was fleeing. He'd\nhave to resolve the chase--soon.\n\nAll at once he saw movement that was not an illusion. He half rose,\nraising his rifle when dust spurted from the ground a few feet to his\nleft. He cursed and threw himself to the ground, rolling until he was\nwell below the ridge. One thing was certain: the sniper had the ridge\nwell under control. The Red Dog watcher must have warned him, he\nthought. He looked around. Off to one side a small rill cut through the\nrocks running in the sniper's general direction. He looked back toward\nthe ridge, hesitated, then decided to gamble on the rill. He moved\ncrablike along the side of the slope until he reached its edge and\npeered over. The bottom was a pool of darkness. He lowered himself over\nthe edge with some misgivings, searching for holds with his hands and\nfeet. His boot unexpectedly touched bottom.\n\nCrag stood for a moment on the floor of the rill. His body was clothed\nin black velvet shadows but it was shallow enough to leave his head in\nthe sunlight. He moved cautiously forward, half expecting the sniper to\nappear in front of him. His nerves were taut, edgy.\n\n_Relax, boy, you're strung like a violin_, he told himself. _Take it\neasy._\n\nA bend in the rill cut off the sun leaving him in a well of blackness.\nHe hadn't counted on that. Before he'd moved another dozen steps he\nrealized the rill wasn't the answer. He'd have to chance getting back\ninto the open. More time was lost. He felt the steep sides until he\nlocated a series of breaks in the wall, then slung his rifle over his\nshoulder and inched upward until his head cleared the edge. The sun's\nsudden glare blinded him. Involuntarily he jerked his head sideways,\nalmost losing his hold in the process. He clung to the wall for a moment\nbefore laboriously pulling his body over the edge.\n\nHe lay prone against the rocks, half-expecting to be greeted by a hail\nof bullets. He waited quietly, without moving, then carefully raised his\nhead. Off to one side was a series of mounds. He crawled toward them\nwithout moving his belly from the ground. When he reached the first one,\nhe half rose and scuttled forward until he found a view of the twisted\nrocks where he had last seen the sniper.\n\nThe scene ahead was a still-life painting. It seemed incongruous that\nsomewhere among the quiet rocks death moved in the form of a man. He\ndecided against penetrating further into the tangle of rocks. He'd wait.\nHe settled back, conscious that time was fleeing.\n\n\"Skipper, are you checking your oxygen?\" The Chief's voice rattled\nagainst his eardrums. It was filled with alarm.\n\n\"Listen, I have no time--\" Crag started to growl. His words were clipped\nshort as his eyes involuntarily took the reading of his oxygen gauge.\nLow ... low. He calculated quickly. He was well past the point of no\nreturn--too low to make the long trip back to Bandit. He was done, gone,\na plucked gosling. He had bought himself a coffin and he'd rest there\nfor all eternity--boxed in by the weird tombstones of Crater Arzachel.\nAdam Crag--the Man in the Moon.\n\nHe grinned wryly. Well, at least his quarry was going with him. He\nwouldn't greet his Maker empty handed. He tersely informed Prochaska of\nhis predicament, then recklessly moved to a high vantage point and\nscanned the rocks beyond.\n\nHe had to make every second count. Light and shadow ... light and\nshadow. Somewhere in the crisscross of light and shadow was a man-form,\na blob of protoplasm like himself, a living thing that had to be stamped\nout before the last of his precious oxygen was gone. He was the\nexecutioner. Somewhere ahead a doomed man waited in the docks ... waited\nfor him to come. They were two men from opposite sides of the world,\nbattling to death in Hell's own backyard. Only he'd win ... win before\nhe died.\n\nHe was scanning the rocky tableau when the sniper moved into his field\nof vision, far to one side of Crag's position. He was running with short\nchoppy steps, threading between the rocks toward Red Dog. His haste and\napparent disregard of exposing himself puzzled Crag for a moment, then\nhe smiled grimly. Almost out of oxygen, he thought. Well, that makes two\nof us. But he still had to make sure his quarry died. The thought\nspurred him to action.\n\nHe turned and scrambled back toward the tip of Backbone Ridge to cut the\nsniper's escape route. He reached the end rocks and waited. A few\nmoments later he sighted a figure scrambling toward him. He raised his\nrifle thinking it was too far for a shot, then lowered it again. The\nsniper began moving more slowly and cautiously, then became lost to\nsight in a maze of rock outcroppings.\n\nCrag waited impatiently, aware that precious moments were fleeing. He\nwas afraid to look at his gauge, plagued by the sense of vanishing\nmoments. Time was running out and eternity was drawing near--near to\nAdam Crag as well as the sniper. The rocks extended before him, a\nkaleidoscopic pattern of black and white. Somewhere in the tortuous\nlabyrinth was the man he had to kill before he himself died. He watched\nnervously, trying to suppress the tension pulling at his muscles. A\nnerve in his cheek twitched and he shook his head without removing his\neyes from the rocks ahead. Still there was no sign of the other.\n\nWho was the stalker and who was the stalked? The question bothered him.\nPerhaps even at that instant the sniper was drawing bead. Then he'd be\nfree to reach Red Dog--safety.\n\nCrag decided he couldn't wait. He'd have to seek the other out, somehow\nflush him from cover. He looked around. Off to one side a shelf of black\nrock angled incongruously into the sky. Its sides were steep but its top\nwould command all approaches to the tip of the crescent. He made his way\nto the base of the shelf and began scrambling up its steep sides,\nfinding it difficult to manage toe and hand holds. He slipped from time\nto time, hanging desperately on to keep himself from rolling back to the\nrocks below. Just below the top he rested, panting, fighting for breath,\nconscious of his heart thudding in his ears. He had to hurry!\n\nSlowly, laboriously he pulled himself up the last few feet and lay\npanting atop the shelf, none too soon. The sniper scrambled out of the\nrocks a scant hundred yards from Crag's position. He raised his rifle,\nthen hesitated. The Red Dog crewman had fallen to his hands and knees\nand was fighting to rise. He pushed his hands against the plain in an\nattempt to get his feet under him. Crag lowered his rifle and watched\ncuriously.\n\nThe sniper finally succeeded in getting to his feet. He stood for a\nmoment, weaving, before moving toward Crag's shelf with a faltering\nzigzag gait. Crag raised the rifle and tried to line the sights. He had\ndifficulty holding the weapon steady. He started to pull the trigger\nwhen the man fell again. Crag hesitated. The sniper floundered in the\nash, managed to pull himself half-erect. He weaved with a few faltering\nsteps and plunged forward on his face.\n\nCrag watched for a moment. There was no movement. The black blob of the\nsuit lay with the stillness of the rocks in the brazen heat of the\ncrater. So that's the way a man dies when his oxygen runs out, he\nthought. He just plops down, jerks a little and departs, with as little\nceremony as that. He grinned crookedly, thinking he had just watched a\nrehearsal of his own demise. He watched for a moment longer before\nturning his face back toward the plain.\n\nRed Dog was a bare half-mile away--a clear level half-mile from the tip\nof Backbone Ridge. That's how close the sniper had come to living. He\nmulled the thought with a momentary surge of hope. Red Dog? Why not? If\nhe could shoot his way into the space cabin he'd live ... live. The\nthought galvanized him to action.\n\nHe slung his rifle over his shoulder and scrambled down the slope\nheedless of the danger of ripping his suit. He could make it. He had to\nmake it! He gained the bottom and paused to catch his breath before\nstarting toward the rocket. A glance at his oxygen meter told him that\nthe race was futile. Still, he forced his legs into a run, threading\nthrough the rocks toward the floor of the crater. He reached the tip of\nthe crescent panting heavily and plunged across the level floor of the\nplain. His legs were leaden, his lungs burned and sweat filled his eyes,\nstinging and blurring his vision. Still he ran.\n\nThe rocket rose from the crater floor, growing larger, larger. He tried\nto keep in a straight path, aware that he was moving in a crazy zigzag\ncourse.\n\nThe rocket loomed bigger ... bigger. It appeared immense. Caution, he\ntold himself, there's an hombre up there with a rifle. He halted,\nfeeling his body weave, and tried to steady himself. High up in the nose\nof Red Dog the hatch was a dancing black shadow--black with movement.\nHe pulled the rifle from his shoulder and moved the control to full\nautomatic, falling to his knees as he did so. Strange, the ashy floor of\nthe crater was erupting in small fountains just to his side. Danger, he\nthought, take cover. The warning bells were still ringing in his brain\nas he slid forward on his stomach and tried to steady his weapon. Dust\nspurted across his face plate. The black rectangle of the hatch danced\ncrazily in his sights. He pulled back on the trigger, feeling the heavy\nweapon buck against his shoulder, firing until the clip was empty. His\nfingers hurriedly searched his belt for the spare clips. Gone. Somehow\nhe'd lost them. He'd have to rush the rocket.\n\nHe got to his feet, weaving dizzily, and forced his legs to move. Once\nor twice he fell, regaining his feet with difficulty.\n\nHe heard a voice. It took him a minute to realize it was his own. He was\nbabbling to Prochaska, trying to tell him ...\n\nThe sky was black. No, it was white, dazzling white, white with heat,\nred with flame. He saw Red Dog with difficulty. The rocket was a hotel,\ncomplete with room clerk. He laughed inanely. A Single, please. No, I'll\nonly be staying for the night. He fell again. This time it took him\nlonger to regain his feet. He stumbled ... walked ... stumbled. His eyes\nsought the rocket. It was weaving, swaying back and forth. Foolish, he\nthought, there was no wind in Crater Arzachel. No air, no wind, no\nnothing. Nothing but death. Wait, there was someone sitting on top of\nthe rocket--a giant of a man with a long white beard. He watched Crag\nand smiled. He reached out a hand and beckoned. Crag ran. The sky\nexploded within his brain, his legs buckled and he felt his face plate\nsmash against the ashy floor. For all eternity, he thought. The\nblackness came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdam Crag opened his eyes. He was lying on his back. Above him the dome\nof the sky formed a great black canopy sprinkled with brilliant stars.\nHis thoughts, chaotic memories, gradually stabilized and he remembered\nhis mad flight toward Red Dog.\n\nThis couldn't be death, he thought. Spirits didn't wear space suits. He\nsensed movement and twisted his head to one side. Gordon Nagel! The\noxygen man's face behind the heavy plate was thin, gaunt, but he was\nsmiling. Crag thought that he had never seen such a wonderful smile.\nNagel's lips crinkled into speech:\n\n\"I was beginning to wonder when you'd make it.\" Even his voice was\ndifferent, Crag thought. The nasal twang was gone. It was soft, mellow,\ndeep with concern. He thought it was the most wonderful sound he had\never heard.\n\n\"Thanks, Gordon,\" he said simply. He spoke the words thinking it was the\nfirst time he'd ever addressed the other by his first name.\n\n\"How'd you ever locate me?\"\n\n\"Started early,\" Nagel said. \"I was pretty sure you'd push yourself past\nthe point of no return. You seemed pretty set on getting that critter.\"\n\n\"It's a wonder you located me.\" He managed to push himself to a sitting\nposition.\n\n\"Prochaska didn't think I could. But I did. Matter of fact, I was pretty\nclose to you when you broke from the rocks heading for Red Dog.\" Red\nDog! Crag twisted his head and looked toward the rocket.\n\n\"He's lying at the base of the rocket,\" Nagel said, in answer to his\nunspoken question. \"Your last volley sprayed him.\"\n\n\"Skipper!\" Prochaska's voice broke impatiently into his earphones.\n\n\"Still alive,\" Crag answered.\n\n\"Yeah--just.\" Prochaska's voice was peevish. \"You were lucky with that\nlast burst of fire.\"\n\n\"Thanks to my good marksmanship,\" Crag quipped weakly.\n\n\"I wish you'd quit acting like a company of Marines and get back here.\"\n\n\"Okay, Colonel.\"\n\nProchaska cursed and Crag grinned happily. It was good to be alive, even\nin Crater Arzachel.\n\nNagel helped him to his feet and Crag stood for a moment, feeling the\nstrength surge back into his body. He breathed deeply, luxuriating in\nthe plentiful oxygen. Fresh oxygen. Fresh as a maiden's kiss, he thought\nOxygen was gold. More than gold. It was life.\n\n\"Ready, now?\"\n\n\"Ready as I ever will be,\" Crag answered. \"Lead on, Gordon.\"\n\nThey had almost reached Bandit when Crag broke the silence. \"Why did you\ncome ... to the moon, Gordon?\"\n\nNagel slowed his steps, then stopped and turned.\n\n\"Why did you come, Commander?\"\n\n\"Because ... because ...\" Crag floundered. \"Because someone had to\ncome,\" he blurted. \"Because I was supposed to be good in my field.\" His\neyes met Nagel's. The oxygen man was smiling, faintly.\n\n\"I'm good in mine, too,\" he said. He chewed at his bottom lip for a\nmoment.\n\n\"I could give the same reasons as you,\" he said finally. \"Truthfully,\nthough, there's more to it.\" He looked at Crag defiantly.\n\n\"I was a misfit on earth, Commander. A square peg in a round hole. I had\ndreams ... dreams, but they were not the dreams of earth. They were\ndreams of places in which there were no people.\" He gave an odd\nhalf-smile. \"Of course I didn't tell the psych doctors that.\"\n\n\"There's plenty I didn't tell 'em, myself,\" Crag said.\n\n\"Commander, you might not understand this but ... I like the moon.\" He\nlooked away, staring into the bleakness of Arzachel. Crag's eyes\nfollowed his. The plain beyond was an ash-filled bowl broken by weird\nledges, spires, grotesque rocks. In the distance Backbone Ridge crawled\nalong the floor of the basin, forming its fantastic labyrinths. Yet ...\nyet there was something fascinating, almost beautiful about the crater.\nIt was the kind of a place a man might cross the gulfs of space to see.\nNagel had crossed those gulfs. Yes, he could understand.\n\n\"I'll never return to earth,\" he said, almost dreamily.\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Not nonsense, Commander. But I'm not unhappy at the prospect. Do you\nremember the lines:\n\n    _Under the wide and starry sky\n    Oh, dig the grave and let me lie ..._\n\nWell, that's the way I feel about the moon.\"\n\n\"You'll be happy enough to get back to earth,\" Crag predicted.\n\n\"I won't get back, Commander. Don't want to get back.\" He turned\nbroodingly toward Bandit.\n\n\"Maybe we'd better move on,\" Crag said gently. \"I crave to get out of\nthis suit.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\"Martin Larkwell was a good boy,\" the superintendent said reminiscently,\n\"and of course we're highly pleased he's made his mark in the world.\" He\nlooked at the agent and beamed. \"Or should I say the moon?\" The agent\nsmiled dutifully.\n\n\"Young Martin was particularly good with his hands. Not that he wasn't\nsmart,\" he added hurriedly. \"He was very bright, in fact, but he was\nfortunate in that he coupled it with an almost uncanny knack of using\nhis hands.\"\n\nThe superintendent rambled at length. The agent listened, thinking it\nwas the same old story. The men in the moon were all great men. They had\nbeen fine, upstanding boys, all bright with spotless records. Well, of\ncourse that was to be expected in view of the rigorous weeding out\nprogram which had resulted in their selections. Only one of them was a\ntraitor. Which one? The question drummed against his mind.\n\n\"Martin wasn't just a study drudge,\" the superintendent was saying. \"He\nwas a fine athlete. The star forward of the Maple Hill Orphanage\nbasketball team for three years,\" he added proudly. He leaned forward\nand lowered his voice as if taking the agent into his confidence.\n\n\"We're conducting a drive to build the orphanage a new gym. Maybe you\ncan guess the name we've selected for it?\"\n\n\"The Martin Larkwell Gymnasium,\" the agent said drily.\n\n\"Right.\" The superintendent beamed. \"That's how much we think of Martin\nLarkwell.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the superintendent wasn't the only one who remembered\nMartin Larkwell with fondness. A druggist, a grocer, a gas station\noperator and a little gray lady who ran a pet shop remembered the orphan\nboy with surprising affection. They and many others. That's the way the\nchips fall, the agent thought philosophically. Let a man become famous\nand the whole world remembers him. Well, his job was to separate the\nwheat from the chaff.\n\nIn the days to follow he painstakingly traced Martin Larkwell's trail\nfrom the Maple Hill Orphanage to New York, to various construction jobs\nalong the East Coast and, finally, through other agents, to a two-year\nstint in Argentina as construction boss for an American equipment firm.\nLater the trail led back to America and, finally, to construction\nforeman on Project Step One. His selection as a member of the Aztec Crew\nstemmed from his excellent work and construction ability displayed\nduring building of the drones. All in all, the agent thought, the record\nwas clear and shiny bright.\n\nMartin Larkwell, Gordon Nagel, Max Prochaska, Adam Crag--four eager\nscrub-faced American boys, each outstanding in his field. There was only\none hitch. Who was the traitor?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrag filled Gotch in on the latest developments in Crater Arzachel. The\nColonel listened without interruption until he was through, then\nretaliated with a barrage of questions. What was the extent of the\nradioactive field? What were the dimensions of Red Dog? Had any progress\nbeen made toward salvaging the cargo of Drone Baker? How was the airlock\nin the rill progressing? Would he please describe the rocket launcher\nthe enemy had used to destroy the Aztec? Crag gritted his teeth to keep\nfrom exploding, barely managing civil replies. Finally he could hold it\nno longer.\n\n\"Listen,\" he grated, \"this is a four-man crew, not a damn army.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Gotch interrupted, \"I appreciate your difficulties. I was\njust--in a manner of speaking--outlining what has to be done.\"\n\n\"As if I didn't know.\"\n\nThe Colonel pressed for his future plans. Crag told him what he thought\nin no uncertain terms. When he finished he thought he heard a soft\nchuckle over the earphones. Damn Gotch, he thought, the man is a sadist.\nThe Colonel gave him another morsel of information--a tidbit that\nmollified him.\n\nPickering Field, Gotch informed him, was now the official name of the\nlanding site in Crater Arzachel. Furthermore, the Air Force was\npetitioning the Joint Chiefs to make it an official part of the U.S.\nAir Force defense system. A fact which had been announced to the world.\nFurthermore, the United States had petitioned the U.N. to recognize its\nsovereignty over the moon. Before cutting off he added one last bit of\ninformation, switching to moon code to give it.\n\n\"_Atom job near completion_,\" he spelled out. For the moment Crag felt\njubilant. An atom-powered space ship spelled complete victory over the\nEastern World. It also meant Venus ... Mars ... magical names in his\nmind. Man was on his way to the stars. MAN--the peripatetic quester. For\njust an instant he felt a pang of jealousy. He'd be pinned to his vacuum\nwhile men were conquering the planets. Or would he? But the mood passed.\nPickering Field, he realized, would play an important role in the future\nof space flight. If it weren't the stars, at least it was the jump-off.\nIn time it would be a vast Air Force Base housing rockets instead of\nstratojets. Pickering Base--the jump-off--the road to the stars. Pretty\nsoon the place would be filled with rank so high that the bird colonels\nwould be doing mess duty. But right now, he was Mr. Pickering Field, the\nMan with the Brass Eyeballs.\n\nWhile the others caught up on their sleep, Crag and Prochaska reviewed\ntheir homework, as the Chief had dubbed their planning sessions. The\narea in which Bandit rested was too far from the nearest rill to use as\na base of operation, and it was also vulnerable to meteorite damage.\nBandit had to be abandoned, and soon. Red Dog would be their next home.\nThere was also the problem of salvaging the contents of Drone Baker and\nremoving the contents of Drone Charlie. Last, there was the problem of\nbuilding the airlock in one of the rills. When they had laid out the\nproblems, they exchanged quizzical glances. The Chief smiled weakly.\n\n\"Seems like a pretty big order.\"\n\n\"A very big order,\" Crag amended. \"The first move is to secure Red\nDog.\" They talked about it until Crag found his eyelids growing heavy.\nProchaska, although tired, volunteered to take the watch. Crag nodded\ngratefully--a little sleep was something he could use.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRed Dog was squat, ebony, taper-nosed, distinguishable from the lithic\nstructures dotting this section of Crater Arzachel only by its symmetry.\nThe grotesque rock ledges, needle-sharp pinnacles and twisted formations\nof the plain clearly were the handiwork of a nature in the throes of\nbirth, when volcanoes burst and the floor of the crater was an uneasy\nsea of white-hot magmatic rock. Red Dog was just as clearly the creation\nof some other-world artificer, a creature born of the intelligence and\npatience of man, structured to cross the planetary voids. Yet it seemed\na part of the plain, as ancient as the brooding dolomites and diorites\nwhich made the floor of Arzachel a lithic wonderland. The tail of Red\nDog was buried in the ash of the plain. Its body reached upward, canted\nslightly from the vertical, as if it were ready to spring again to the\nstars.\n\nThe rocket launcher had been removed. Now it stood on the plain off to\none side of the rocket, small and portable, like some deadly insect. The\nlauncher bothered Crag. He wanted to destroy it--or the single missile\nthat remained--but was deterred by its possible use if the enemy should\nland another manned ship. In the end he left it where it was.\n\nOne of the numerous rills which crisscrossed the floor of the crater cut\nnear the base of the rocket at a distance of about ten yards. It was a\nshallow rill, about twelve feet wide and ten feet deep, with a bottom of\nsoft ash.\n\nAdam Crag studied the rocket and rill in turn, a plan gradually forming\nin his mind. The rocket could be toppled, its engines removed and an\nairlock installed in the tail section, as had been done with the Aztec.\nIt could be lowered into the rill and its body, all except the airlock,\ncovered with ash. Materials salvaged from the drones could be used to\nconstruct extensions running along the floor of the rill and these, in\nturn, covered with ash. This, then, would be the first moonlock, a place\nwhere man could live, safe from the constant danger of destruction by\nchance meteorites.\n\nHe looked thoughtfully at the sun. It was an unbearable circle of white\nlight hanging in the purple-black sky just above the horizon. Giant\nblack shadows crept out from the towering walls of the crater. Within\nanother twenty-four hours they would engulf the rocket. During the lunar\nnight--two weeks long--the crater floor would be gripped in the cold of\nabsolute space; the rocket would lie in a stygian night broken only by\nthe brilliance of the stars and the reflected light of an earth which\nwould seem to fill the sky. But they couldn't wait for the advent of a\nnew day. They would have to get started immediately.\n\nLarkwell opposed the idea of working through the long lunar night. He\nargued that the suits would not offer sufficient protection against the\ncold, they needed light to work, and that the slow progress they would\nmake wouldn't warrant the risks and discomfort they would have to\nundergo. Nagel unexpectedly sided with Crag. He cited the waste of\noxygen which resulted by having to decompress Bandit every time someone\nleft or entered the ship.\n\n\"We need an airlock, and soon,\" he said.\n\nCrag listened and weighed the arguments. Larkwell was right. The space\nsuits weren't made to withstand prolonged exposure during the bitter\nhours of the lunar night. But Nagel was right, too.\n\n\"I doubt if we could live cooped up in Bandit for two weeks without\nmurdering one another,\" Prochaska observed quietly. \"I vote we go\nahead.\"\n\n\"Sure, you sit on your fanny and monitor the radio,\" Larkwell growled.\n\"I'm the guy who has to carry the load.\"\n\nProchaska reddened and started to answer when Crag cut in: \"Cut the\ndamned bickering,\" he snapped. \"Max handles the communication because\nthat's his job.\" He looked sharply at Larkwell. The construction boss\ngrunted but didn't reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNight and bitter cold came to Crater Arzachel with a staggering blow.\nInstantly the plain became a black pit lighted only by the stars and the\nenormous crescent of the earth--an airless pit in which the temperature\nplunged until metal became as brittle as glass and the materials of the\nspace suits stiffened until Crag feared they would crack.\n\nLarkwell warned against continuing their work.\n\n\"One misstep in lowering Red Dog and it'll shatter like an egg.\"\n\nCrag realized he was right. Lowering the rocket in the bitter cold and\nblackness would be a superhuman job. Loss of the rocket would be\ndisastrous. Against this was the necessity of obtaining shelter from the\nmeteor falls. His determination was fortified by the discovery that a\nstray meteorite had smashed the nose of Drone Charlie. He decided to go\non.\n\nThe cold seeped through their suits, chilled their bones, touched their\narms and legs like a thousand pin pricks and lay like needles in their\nlungs until every movement was sheer agony. Yet their survival depended\nupon movement, hence every moment away from Bandit was filled with\nforced activity. But even the space cabin of Bandit was more like an\noutsized icebox than a place designed for human habitation. The rocket's\ninsulated walls were ice to the touch, their breaths were frosty\nstreams--sleep was possible only because of utter fatigue. At the end of\neach work shift the body simply rebelled against the task of retaining\nconsciousness. Thus a few hours of merciful respite against the cold was\nobtained.\n\nCrag assigned Prochaska the task of monitoring the radio despite his\nplea to share in the more arduous work. The knowledge that one of his\ncrew was a saboteur lay constantly in his mind. He had risked leaving\nProchaska alone before, he could risk it again, but he wasn't willing to\nrisk leaving any of the others alone in Bandit. Yet, Prochaska hadn't\nfound the bomb! Larkwell had worked superhumanly at the task of\nrebuilding the Aztec--Nagel had saved his life when he could just as\neasily have let him die. Neither seemed the work of a saboteur. Yet the\ncold fact remained--there was a saboteur!\n\nRichter, too, preyed on his mind. The self-styled Eastern scientist was\nnoncommittal, speaking only when spoken to. Yet he performed his\nassigned duties without hesitation. He had, in fact, made himself so\nuseful that he almost seemed one of the crew. That, Crag told himself,\nwas the danger. The tendency was to stop watching Richter, to trust him\nfarther and farther. Was he planning, biding his time, preparing to\nstrike? How? When? He wished he knew.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey toppled Red Dog in the dark of the moon.\n\nLarkwell had run two cables to manually operated winches set about\ntwenty-five yards from the rocket. A second line extended from each\nwinch to the ravine. The ends of these were weighted with rocks. They\nserved to anchor the winches during the lowering of the rocket. Finally\na guide line ran from the nose of the rocket to a third winch. Richter\nand Nagel manned the lowering winches while Larkwell worked with the\nguide line, with only small hand torches to aid them. It was\napproximately the same setup used on the Aztec--they were getting good\nat it. Crag helped until the moment came to lower the rocket, then there\nwas little for him to do. He contented himself with watching the\noperation, playing his torch over the scene as he felt it was needed.\n\nIt was an eery feeling. The rocket was a black monster bathed in the\npuny yellow rays of their hand torches. The pale light gave the illusion\nof movement until the rocket, the rocks, and the very floor of the\ncrater seemed to writhe and squirm, playing tricks on the eyes. It was,\nhe knew, a dangerous moment, one ripe for a saboteur to strike--or ripe\nfor Richter.\n\nIt was dark. Not an ebony dark but one, rather, with the odd color of\nmilky velvet. The earth was almost full, a gigantic globe whose\nreflected light washed out the brilliance of the stars and gave a milky\nsheen to Crater Arzachel. It was a light in which the eye detected form\nas if it were looking through a murky sea. It detected form but missed\ndetail. Only the gross structures of the plain were visible: the\nblackness of the rocket reaching upward into the night; fantastic\ntwisted rocks which blotted out segments of the stars; the black blobs\nof men moving in heavy space suits, dark shadows against the still\ndarker night. The eery almost futile beams of the hand torches seemed\nworse than useless.\n\n\"All set.\" Larkwell's voice was grim. \"Let her come.\"\n\nCrag fastened his eyes on the nose of Red Dog, a tapered indistinct\nsilhouette.\n\n\"Start letting out line at the count of three.\" There was a pause before\nLarkwell began the countdown.\n\n\"One ... two ... three....\"\n\nThe nose moved, swinging slowly across the sky, then began falling.\n\n\"Slack off!\"\n\nThe lines jerked, snapped taut, and the nose hung suspended in space,\nthen began swinging to one side.\n\n\"Take up on your line, Richter.\" The sideward movement stopped, leaving\nthe rocket canted at an angle of about forty-five degrees.\n\n\"Okay....\" The nose moved down again, slower this time. Crag began to\nbreathe easier. Suddenly the nose skidded to the rear, falling, then\nthe rocket was a motionless blob on the plain.\n\n\"That did it.\" Larkwell's voice was ominous, yet tinged with disgust.\n\n\"What happened?\" Crag found himself shouting into the lip mike.\n\n\"The tail slipped. That's what we get for trying to lower it under these\nconditions,\" Larkwell snarled. \"The damn thing's probably smashed.\"\n\nCrag didn't answer. He moved slowly toward the rocket, playing his torch\nover its hull in an attempt to discern its details. He was conscious\nthat the others had come up and were doing the same thing, but even when\nhe stood next to it Red Dog was no more than a black shadow.\n\n\"Feel it,\" Larkwell barked, \"that's the only way to tell. The torches\nare useless.\" They followed his advice. Crag walked alongside the\nrocket, moving his hand over the smooth surface. He had reached the tail\nand started back on the opposite side when Larkwell's voice rang in his\nears.\n\n\"Smashed!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"The under side--where she hit the deck. Looks like she came down on a\nrock.\"\n\nCrag hurried back around the rocket, nearly stumbling over Larkwell's\nlegs. The construction boss was lying on his stomach.\n\n\"Under here.\" Crag dropped to his knees, then to his stomach and moved\nalongside Larkwell, playing his beam over the hull. He saw the break\nimmediately, a ragged, gaping hole where the metal had shattered against\na small rock outcropping. Too big for a weld? Larkwell answered his\nunspoken thought.\n\n\"You'll play hell getting that welded.\"\n\n\"It might be possible.\"\n\n\"There may be more breaks.\" They lay there for a moment playing their\nbeams along the visible underside of Red Dog until they were satisfied\nthat, in this section at least, there was no more damage.\n\n\"What now?\" Larkwell asked, when they had crawled back from under the\nrocket.\n\n\"The plans haven't changed,\" Crag said stonily. \"We repair it ... fix it\nup ... move in. That's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"You can't fix it by just saying so,\" Larkwell growled. \"First it's got\nto be fixable. It looks like a cooked duck, to me.\"\n\n\"We gotta start back,\" Nagel said urgently, \"oxygen's getting low.\"\n\nCrag looked at his gauge. Nagel was right. They'd have to get moving. He\nwas about to give the signal to return to Bandit when Richter spoke up.\n\n\"It can be repaired.\" For a moment there was a startled silence.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"The inside of the cabin is lined with foam rubber, the same as in\nBandit--a self-sealing type designed for protection against meteorite\ndamage.\"\n\n\"So...?\" Larkwell asked belligerently.\n\nRichter explained, \"It's not porous. If the break were covered with\nmetal and lined with the foam, it would do a pretty good job of sealing\nthe cabin.\"\n\n\"You can't patch a leak that big with rubber and expect it to hold,\"\nLarkwell argued. \"Hell, the pressure would blow right through.\"\n\n\"Not if you lined the break with metal first,\" Richter persisted.\n\nThe suggestion startled Crag, coming as it did from a man whom he\nregarded as an enemy. For a moment he wondered if the German's instinct\nfor survival were greater than his patriotism. But the plan sounded\nplausible.\n\nHe asked Larkwell: \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"Could be,\" he replied noncommittally. He didn't seem pleased that\nRichter was intruding in a sphere which he considered his own.\n\nCrag gave a last look at the silhouette of the fallen giant on the plain\nand announced: \"We'll try it.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't work, we're in the soup,\" Larkwell insisted. \"Suppose\nthere are more breaks?\"\n\n\"We'll patch those, too,\" Crag snapped. He felt an unreasonable surge of\nanger toward the construction boss. He sucked his lip, vexedly, then\nturned his torch on his oxygen meter. \"We'd better get moving.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nColonel Michael Gotch looked at the agent across the narrow expanse of\nhis battered desk, then his eyes fell again to the dockets. Four\ndockets, four small sheaves of paper, each the capsuled story of a man's\nlife. The names on the dockets were literally burned into his mind: Adam\nPhilip Crag, Martin LeRoy Larkwell, Gordon Wells Nagel, Max Edward\nProchaska. Four names, four men, four separate egos who, by the magic of\nman, had been transported to a bleak haven on another world. Four men\nwhose task was to survive an alien hell until the U.N. officially\nrecognized the United States' claim to sovereignty over the stark lands\nof the moon.\n\nBut one of the men was a saboteur, an agent whose task was to destroy\nthe Western claim to ownership by destroying its occupancy of the moon.\nThat would leave the East free to claim at least equal sovereignty on\nthe basis that it, too, had established occupancy in a lunar base.\n\nThe agent broke into his thoughts. \"I'd almost stake my professional\nreputation he's your man.\" He reached over and tapped one of the dockets\nsignificantly.\n\n\"The word, the single word, that's what you used to tell me to watch\nfor. Well, the single word is there--the word that spells traitor. I'd\ngone over his record a dozen times before I stumbled on it.\" He ceased\nspeaking and watched the Colonel.\n\n\"You may be right,\" Gotch said at last. \"That's the kind of slip I'd\npounce on myself.\" He hesitated.\n\n\"Go on,\" the agent said, as if reading his thoughts.\n\n\"There's one thing I didn't tell you because I didn't want to prejudice\nyour thinking. The psychiatrists agree with you.\"\n\n\"The psychiatrists?\" The agent's brow furrowed in a question.\n\n\"They've restudied the records exhaustively, ever since we first knew\nthere was a saboteur in the crew.\n\n\"They've weighed their egos, dissected their personalities, analyzed\ntheir capabilities, literally taken them apart and put them together\nagain. I got their report just this morning.\" Gotch looked speculatively\nat the agent. \"Your suspect is also their choice. Only there is no\ntraitor.\"\n\n\"No traitor?\" The agent started visibly. \"I don't get you.\"\n\n\"No traitor,\" Gotch echoed. \"This is a tougher nut than that. The\npersonality profile of one man shows a distinct break.\" He looked\nexpectantly at the agent.\n\n\"A plant.\" The agent muttered, the words thoughtfully. \"A ringer--a spy\nwho has adopted the life role of another. That indicates careful\nplanning, long preparation.\" He muttered the words aloud, talking to\nhimself.\n\n\"He would have had to cover every contingency--friends, relatives,\nacquaintances, skills, hobbies--then, at an exact time and place, our\nman was whisked away and he merely stepped in.\" He shook his head.\n\n\"That's the kind of nut that's really tough to crack.\"\n\n\"Crack it,\" Gotch said.\n\nThe agent got to his feet \"I'll dig him out,\" he promised savagely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drive to rehabilitate Red Dog became a frenzy in Crag's mind. He\ndrove his crew mercilessly, beset by a terrible sense of urgency. Nor\ndid he spare himself. They rigged lines in the dark of the moon and\nrotated the rocket on its long axis until the break in the hull was\naccessible.\n\nCrag viewed it with dismay. It was far longer than he had feared--a\nsplintered jagged hole whose raw torn edges were bent into the belly of\nthe ship. They finally solved the problem by using the hatch door of\nDrone Charlie as a seal, lining it with sheets of foam from Bandit,\nwhose interior temperature immediately plummeted to a point where it was\nscarcely livable.\n\nProchaska bore the brunt of this new discomfort. Confined as he was to\nthe cabin and with little opportunity for physical activity, he nearly\nfroze until he took to living in his space suit.\n\nCrag began planning the provisioning of Red Dog even before he knew it\ncould be repaired. During each trip from Bandit he burdened the men with\nsupplies. Between times he managed to remove the spare oxygen cylinders\ncarried in Drone Charlie. There was still a scant supply in Drone Baker,\nbut he decided to leave those until later.\n\nThe problems confronting him gnawed at his mind until each small\ndifficulty assumed giant proportions. Each time he managed to fit the\nwork into a proper mental perspective a new problem or disaster cropped\nup. He grew nervous and irritable. In his frantic haste to complete the\nwork on Red Dog he found himself begrudging the crew the few hours they\ntook off each day for sleep. _Take it easy_, he finally told himself.\n_Slow down_, Adam. Yet despite his almost hourly resolves to slow down,\nhe found himself pushing at an ever faster pace. Complete Red Dog ...\ncomplete Red Dog ... became a refrain in his mind.\n\nLarkwell grew sullen and surly, snapping at Richter at the slightest\nprovocation. Nagel became completely indifferent, and in the process,\ncompletely ineffectual. Crag had long realized that the oxygen man had\nreached his physical limits. Now, he knew, Nagel had passed them. Maybe\nhe was right ... maybe he wouldn't leave the moon.\n\nWhen the break in Red Dog was repaired, Crag waited, tense and jittery,\nwhile Nagel entered the rocket and pressurized it. It'll work, he told\nhimself. It's got to work. The short period Nagel remained in the rocket\nseemed to extend into hours before he opened the hatch.\n\n\"One or two small leaks,\" he reported wearily. He looked disconsolately\nat Crag. \"Maybe we can locate them--with a little time.\"\n\n\"Good.\" Crag nodded, relieved. Another crisis past. He ordered Larkwell\nto start pulling the engines. If things went right....\n\nThe work didn't progress nearly as fast as he had hoped. For one thing,\nthe engines weren't designed for removal. They were welded fast against\ncross beams spread between the hull. Consequently, the metal sides of\nthe ship were punctured numerous times before the job was completed.\nEach hole required another weld, another patch, and increased the danger\nof later disaster.\n\nCrag grew steadily moodier. Larkwell seemed to take a vicious\nsatisfaction out of each successive disaster. He had adopted an\nI-told-you-so attitude that grated Crag's nerves raw. Surprisingly\nenough, Richter proved to be a steadying influence, at least to Crag. He\nworked quietly, efficiently, seeming to anticipate problems and find\nsolutions before even Crag recognized them. Despite the fact that he\nfound himself depending on the German more and more, he was determined\nnever to relax his surveillance over the man. Richter was an enemy--a\nman to be watched.\n\nLarkwell and Nagel were lackadaisically beginning work on the ship's\nairlock when Prochaska came on the interphones with an emergency call.\n\n\"Gotch calling,\" he told Crag. \"He's hot to get you on the line.\"\n\nCrag hesitated. \"Tell him to go to hell,\" he said finally. \"I'll call\nhim on the regular hour.\"\n\n\"He said you'd say that,\" Prochaska informed him amiably, \"but he wants\nyou now.\"\n\nAnother emergency--another hair-raiser. _Gotch is a damn ulcer-maker_,\nCrag thought savagely. \"Okay, I'm on my way,\" he said wearily. \"Anything\nto keep him off my back.\"\n\n\"Can I tell him that?\"\n\n\"Tell him anything you want,\" Crag snapped. He debated taking the crew\nwith him but finally decided against it. They couldn't afford the time.\nReluctantly he put the work party in Larkwell's charge and started back\nacross the bowl of the crater, each step a deliberate weighted effort.\nSo much to do. So little time. He trudged through the night, cursing the\nfate that had made him Gotch's pawn.\n\nGotch was crisp and to the point. \"Another rocket was launched from east\nof the Caspian this morning,\" he told him.\n\n\"Jesus, we need a company of Marines.\"\n\n\"Not this time, Adam.\"\n\n\"Oh ...\" Crag muttered the word.\n\n\"That's right ... a warhead,\" Gotch confirmed.\n\nCrag kicked the information around in his mind for a moment. \"What do\nthe computers say?\"\n\n\"Too early to say for sure, but it looks like it's on the right track.\"\n\n\"Unless it's a direct hit it's no go. We got ten thousand foot walls\nrimming this hell-hole.\"\n\nThe Colonel was silent for a moment. \"It's not quite that pat,\" he said\nfinally.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because of the low gravity. Thousands of tons of rock will be lifted.\nSome will escape but the majority will fall back like rain. They'll\nsmash down over a tremendously large area, Adam. At least that's what\nthe scientists tell us.\"\n\n\"Okay, in four days we'll be underground,\" he said with exaggerated\ncheerfulness, \"as safe as bunnies in their burrows.\"\n\n\"Can you make it that fast?\"\n\n\"We'll have to. That means well have to use Prochaska. That'll keep you\noff the lines except for the regular broadcast hour,\" he said with\nsatisfaction.\n\nGotch snorted: \"Go to hell.\"\n\n\"Been on the verge of it ever since we left earth.\"\n\n\"One other thing,\" Gotch said. \"Baby's almost ready to try its wings.\"\n\nThe atomic spaceship! Crag suppressed his excitement with difficulty. He\nheld down his voice.\n\n\"About time,\" he said laconically.\n\n\"Don't give me that blas\u00e9 crap,\" the Colonel said cheerfully. \"I know\nexactly how you feel.\" He informed him that the enemy was proclaiming to\nthe world they had established a colony on the moon, and had formally\nrequested the United Nations to recognize their sovereignty over the\nlunar world. \"How's that for a stack of hogwash?\" he ended.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" Crag agreed. \"What are we claiming?\"\n\n\"The same thing. Only we happen to be telling the truth.\"\n\n\"How will the U.N. know that?\"\n\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it, Adam. Just keep alive and\nlet us worry about the U.N.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to commit suicide if that's what you're thinking.\"\n\n\"You can--if you don't keep on your toes.\"\n\n\"Meaning...?\"\n\n\"The saboteur....\" His voice fell off for a moment. \"I've been wanting\nto talk with you about that, Adam. We have a lead. I can't name the man\nyet because it's pretty thin evidence. Just keep on your toes.\"\n\n\"I am. I'm a grown boy, remember?\"\n\n\"More than usual,\" Gotch persisted. \"The enemy is making an all-out\ndrive to destroy Pickering Base. You can be sure the saboteur will do\nhis share. The stage is set, Adam.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For murder.\"\n\n\"Not this lad.\"\n\n\"Don't be too cocky. Remember the Blue Door episode? You're the key\nman ... and that makes you the key target. Without you the rest would\nbe a cinch.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful,\" Crag promised.\n\n\"Doubly careful,\" Gotch cautioned. \"Don't be a sitting duck. I think\nmaybe we'll have a report for you before long,\" he added enigmatically.\n\n\"If the warhead doesn't get us,\" Crag reminded him. \"And thanks for all\nthe good news.\" He laughed mirthlessly. They exchanged a few more words\nand cut off. He turned to Prochaska, weighing his gaunt face.\n\n\"You get your wish, Max. Climb into your spaceman duds and I'll take you\nfor a stroll. As of now you're a working man.\"\n\n\"Yippee,\" Prochaska clowned, \"I've joined the international ranks of\nworkers.\"\n\nCrag's answering grin was bleak. \"You'll be sorry,\" he said quietly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nThe earth was no longer a round full ball. It was a gibbous mass of\nmilk-white light, humpbacked, a twisted giant in the sky whose reflected\nradiance swept the lunar night and dimmed even the brightest of the\nstars. Its beacon swept out through space, falling in Crater Arzachel\nwith a soft creamy sheen, outlining the structures of the plain with its\ndim glow.\n\nLarkwell and Nagel had finished the airlock. The rocket had been tested\nand, despite a few minute leaks they had failed to locate, the space\ncabin was sufficiently airtight to serve their purpose. But the rocket\nhad still to be lowered into the rill. Larkwell favored waiting for the\ncoming sun.\n\n\"It's only a few more days,\" he told Crag.\n\n\"We can't wait.\"\n\n\"We smashed this baby once by not waiting.\"\n\n\"Well have to risk it,\" Crag said firmly.\n\n\"Why? We're not that short of oxygen.\"\n\nCrag debated. Sooner or later the others would have to be told about the\nnew threat from the sides. That morning Gotch had given him ominous\nnews. The computers indicated it was going to be close. Very close. He\nlooked around. They were watching him, waiting for him to give answer to\nLarkwell's question.\n\nHe said softly: \"Okay, I'll tell you why. There's a rocket homing in\nwith the name Arzachel on its nose.\"\n\n\"More visitors?\" The plaintive query came from Nagel. Crag shook his\nhead negatively.\n\n\"We've got arms,\" Prochaska broke in confidently. He grinned \"We'll\nelect you Commander of the First Arzachel Infantry Company.\"\n\n\"This rocket isn't manned.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"It's a warhead,\" Crag said grimly, \"a nuclear warhead. If we're not\nunderground when it hits....\" He left the sentence dangling and looked\naround. The masked faces were blank, expressionless. It was a moment of\nsilence, of weighing, before Larkwell spoke.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"we drop her into the hole.\"\n\nHe turned back and gazed at Red Dog. Nagel didn't move. He kept his eyes\non Crag, seemingly rooted to the spot until Prochaska touched his arm.\n\n\"Come on, Gordon,\" he said kindly. \"We've got work to do.\" Only then did\nthe oxygen man turn away. Crag had the feeling he was in a daze.\n\nThey worked four hours beyond the regular shift before Crag gave the\nsignal to stop. The cables had been fastened to Red Dog--the winches\nset. Now it was poised on the brink of the rill, ready for lowering into\nthe black depths. Crag was impatient to push ahead but he knew the men\nwere too tired. Even the iron-bodied Larkwell was faltering. It would be\ntoo risky. Yet he only reluctantly gave the signal to start back toward\nBandit.\n\nThey trudged across the plain--five black blobs, five shadows plodding\nthrough a midnight pit. Crag led the way. The earth overhead gleamed\nwith a yellow-green light. The stars against the purple-black sky were\nwashed to a million glimmering pinpoints. The sky, the crater, the black\nshadows etched against the blacker night bespoke the alienage of the\nuniverse. Arzachel was the forgotten world. More, a world that never\nwas. It was solid matter created of nothingness, floating in\nnothingness, a minute speck adrift in the terrible emptiness of the\ncosmos. He shivered. It was an eery feeling.\n\nHe reached Bandit and waited for the others to arrive. Prochaska,\nfresher than the others, was first on the scene. He threw a mock salute\nto Crag and started up the ladder. Larkwell and Richter arrived moments\nlater. He watched them approach. They seemed stooped--like old men, he\nthought--but they gave him a short nod before climbing to the space\ncabin. He was beginning to worry before Nagel finally appeared. The\noxygen man was staggering with weariness, barely able to stand erect.\nCrag stepped aside.\n\n\"After you, Gordon.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Skipper.\"\n\nCrag anxiously watched while Gordon pulled his way up the rope ladder.\nHe paused halfway and rested his head on his arms. After a moment he\nresumed the climb. Crag waited until he reached the cabin before\nfollowing. Could Nagel hold out? Could a man die of sheer exhaustion?\nThe worry nibbled at his mind. Maybe he should give him a day's\nrest--let him monitor the communicator. Or just sleep. As it was his\ncontribution to their work was nil. He did little more than go through\nthe motions.\n\nCrag debated the problem while they pressurized the cabin and removed\ntheir suits. What would Gotch do? Gotch would drive him till he died.\nThat's what Gotch would expect him to do. No, he couldn't be soft. Even\nNagel's slight contribution might make the difference between success or\nfailure. Life or death. He would have to ride it out. Crag set his lips\ngrimly. He had felt kinder toward the oxygen man since that brief period\nwhen Nagel had let him peer into his mind. Now ... now he felt like his\nexecutioner. Just when he was beginning to understand the vistas of\nNagel's being. But understanding and sympathizing with Nagel made his\ntask all the more difficult. Impatiently he pushed the problem from his\nmind. There were other, bigger things he had to consider. Like the\nwarhead.\n\nLarkwell was getting out their rations when Prochaska slumped\nwordlessly to the floor. Crag leaped to his side. The Chief's face was\nwhite, drawn, twisted in a curious way. Crag felt bewildered. Odd but\nhis brain refused to function. He was struggling to make himself think\nwhen he saw Nagel leap for his pressure suit. Understanding came. He\nshouted to the others and grabbed for his own garments. He fought a wave\nof dizziness while he struggled to get them on. His fingers were heavy,\nawkward. He fumbled with the face plate for long precious seconds before\nhe managed to pull it shut and snap on the oxygen.\n\nNagel had finished and was trying to dress Prochaska. Crag sprang to\nhelp him. Together they managed to get him into his suit and turn on his\noxygen. Only then did he speak.\n\n\"How did we lose oxygen, Gordon?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He sounded frightened. \"A slow leak.\" He got out his\ntest equipment and fumbled with it. The others watched, waiting\nnervously until he finally spoke.\n\n\"A very slow leak. Must have been a meteorite strike.\"\n\n\"Can you locate it?\"\n\nNagel shrugged in his suit \"It'll take time--and cost some oxygen.\"\n\nCrag looked at him and decided he was past the point of work. Past,\neven, the point of caring.\n\n\"We'll take care of it,\" he said gently. \"Get a little rest, Gordon.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Skipper.\" Nagel slumped down in one of the seats and buried his\nhead in his arms. Before long Prochaska began to stir. He opened his\neyes and looked blankly at Crag for a long moment before comprehension\ncame to his face.\n\n\"Oxygen?\"\n\n\"Probably a meteorite strike. But it's okay ... now.\"\n\nProchaska struggled to his feet \"Well, I needed the rest,\" he joked\nfeebly.\n\nThe leak put an end to all thoughts of rations. They would have to\nremain in their suits until it was found and repaired. At Crag's\nsuggestion Nagel and Larkwell went to sleep. More properly, they simply\ncollapsed in their suits. Richter, however, insisted on helping search\nfor the break in the hull. Crag didn't protest; he was, in fact,\nthankful.\n\nIt was Prochaska who found it--a small rupture hardly larger than a pea\nin one corner of the cabin.\n\n\"Meteorite,\" he affirmed, examining the hole. \"We're lucky it hasn't\nhappened before.\"\n\nThey patched the break and repressurized the cabin, then tested it.\nPressure remained constant. Crag gave a sigh of relief and started to\nshuck his suit. Richter followed his example but Prochaska hesitated,\nstanding uncertainly.\n\n\"Makes you leery,\" he said.\n\n\"The chances of another strike are fairly low,\" Crag encouraged. \"I feel\nthe same way but we can't live in these duds.\" He finished peeling off\nhis garments and Prochaska followed suit.\n\nDespite his fatigue sleep didn't come easy to Crag. He tossed\nrestlessly, trying to push the problems out of his mind. Just before he\nfinally fell asleep thought of the saboteur popped into his mind. I'll\nbe a sitting duck, he told himself. He was trying to pull himself back\nto wakefulness when his body rebelled.\n\nHe slept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey prepared to lower Red Dog into the rill. Earth was humpbacked in\nthe sky, almost a crescent, with a bright cone of zodiacal light in the\neast. The light was a herald of the coming sun, a sun whose rays would\nnot reach the depths of Crater Arzachel for another forty-eight hours.\n\nIn the black pit of the crater the yellow torches of the work crew\nplayed over the body of the rocket, making it appear like some\ngargantuan monster pulled from the depths of the sea. It was poised on\nthe brink of the rill with cables encircling its body, running to\nwinches anchored nearby. The cables would be let out, slowly, allowing\nthe rocket to descend into the depths of the crevice. Larkwell on the\nopposite side of the rill manned a power winch rigged to pull the rocket\nover the lip of the crevice.\n\n\"Ready on winch one?\" His voice was a brittle bark, edgy with strain.\nNagel spoke up.\n\n\"Ready on winch one.\"\n\n\"Ready on winch two?\"\n\n\"Ready on winch two,\" Prochaska answered.\n\n\"Here we go.\" The line from Red Dog to Larkwell's winch tautened,\njerked, then tautened once more. Red Dog seemed to quiver, and began\nrolling slowly toward the brink of the rill. Crag watched from a nearby\nspur of rock. He smiled wryly. Lowering rockets on the moon was getting\nto be an old story. The cables and winches all seemed familiar. Well,\nthis would be the last one they'd have to lower. He hoped. Richter stood\nbeside him, silent. The rocket hung on the lip of the crevice for a\nmoment before starting over.\n\n\"Take up slack.\" The lines to the anchor winches became taut and the\nrocket hung, half-suspended in space.\n\n\"Okay.\" Larkwell's line tightened again and the rocket jerked clear of\nthe edge, held in space by the anchor winches.\n\n\"Lower away--slowly.\"\n\nCrag moved to the edge of the rill, conscious of Richter at his heels.\nThe man's constant presence jarred him; yet, he was there by his orders.\nHe played his torch over the rocket. It was moving into the rill in a\nseries of jerks. Its tail struck the ashy floor. In another moment it\nrested at the bottom of the crevice. They would make it. A wave of\nexultation swept him. The biggest problems could be whipped if you just\ngot aboard and rode them. Well, he'd ridden this one--ridden it through\na night of Stygian blackness and unbelievable cold. Ridden it to\nvictory despite damnable odds. He felt jubilant.\n\nBut they would have to hurry if they were to get all their supplies and\ngear moved from Bandit before the warhead struck. They still had to\ncover Red Dog, burying it beneath a thick coat of ash. Would that be\nenough? It was designed to protect them from the dangers of meteorite\ndust, but would it withstand the rain of hell to come when the warhead\nstruck? Wearily he pushed the thought from his mind.\n\nWhen the others had secured their gear, he gave the signal to return to\nBandit. They struck out, trudging through the blackness in single file,\nfollowing a serpentine path between the occasional rills and knolls\nscattered between the two ships. Crag swung his arms in an effort to\nkeep warm. Tiny needles of pain stabbed at his hands and feet, and the\ncold in his lungs was an agony. Even in the darkness the path between\nthe rockets had become a familiar thing.\n\nDespite the discomfort and weariness he rather liked the long trek\nbetween the rockets. It gave him time to think and plan, a time when\nnothing was demanded of him except that he follow a reasonably straight\ncourse. There was no warhead, no East World menace, no Gotch. There was\nonly the blackness and the solitude of Crater Arzachel. He even liked\nthe blackness of the lunar night, despite its attendant cold. The mantle\nof darkness hid the crater's ugliness, erasing its menacing profile and\nsoftening its features. He turned his eyes skyward as he walked. The\nearth was huge, many times the size of the full moon as seen from its\nmother planet, yet it seemed fragile, delicate, a pale ethereal wanderer\nof the heavens.\n\nCrag did not think of himself as an imaginative man. Yet when he beheld\nthe earth something stirred deep within him. The earth became not a\nthing of rock and sea water and air, but a living being. He thought of\nEarth as _she_. At times she was a ghost treading among the stars, a\nwaif lost in the immensity of the universe. And at times she was a\nwanton woman, walking in solitary splendor, her head high and proud. The\nstars were her lovers. Crag walked through the night, head up, wondering\nif ever again he would answer her call.\n\nHe had almost reached Bandit when Nagel's voice broke excitedly into his\nearphones.\n\n\"Something's wrong with Prochaska!\"\n\nCrag stopped in his tracks, gripped by a sudden fear.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He was somewhere ahead of me. I just caught up to him....\"\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\" Crag snapped irritably. Damn, wouldn't the man\nstop beating around the bush?\n\n\"He's collapsed.\"\n\n\"Coming,\" Crag said. He hurried back through the darkness, cursing\nhimself for having let the party get strung out.\n\n\"Too late, Commander.\" It was Richter's voice. \"His suit's deflated.\nMust have been a meteorite strike.\"\n\n\"Stay there,\" Crag ordered. \"Larkwell...?\"\n\n\"I'm backtracking too....\"\n\nThey were all there when he arrived, gathered around Prochaska's huddled\nform. The yellow lights of their torches pinned his body against the\nashy plain. Larkwell, on his knees, was running his hands over the\nelectronic chief's body. Crag dropped to his side.\n\n\"Here it is!\"\n\nLarkwell's fingers had found the hole, a tiny rip just under the\nshoulder. Crag examined it, conscious that something was wrong. It\ndidn't look like the kind of hole a meteorite would make. It looked, he\nthought, like, a small rip. The kind of a rip a knife point might make.\nHe stared up at Larkwell. The construction boss's eyes met his and he\nnodded his head affirmatively. Crag got to his feet and faced the\nGerman.\n\n\"Where were you when this happened?\"\n\n\"Ahead of him,\" Richter answered. \"We were strung out. I think I was\nnext in line behind you.\"\n\nLarkwell said softly: \"You got here before I did. That would put you\nbehind me.\"\n\n\"I was ahead of you when we started.\" The German contemplated Larkwell\ncalmly. \"I didn't see you pass me.\"\n\nCrag turned to Nagel. \"Where were you, Gordon?\"\n\n\"At the rear, as usual.\" His voice was bitter.\n\n\"How far was Prochaska ahead of you?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know.\" He looked away into the blackness, then back to Crag.\n\"Would you expect me to?\"\n\nCrag debated. Clearly he wasn't getting anywhere with the interrogation.\nHe looked at Nagel. The man seemed on the verge of collapse.\n\n\"We'll carry Max back. Lend a hand, Richter.\" His voice turned cold. \"I\nwant to examine that rip in the light.\"\n\nThe German nodded calmly.\n\n\"Stay together,\" Crag barked. \"No stringing out Larkwell, you lead the\nway.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The construction boss started toward Bandit. Nagel fell in at\nhis heels. Crag and Richter, carrying Prochaska's body between them,\nbrought up at the rear.\n\nIt took the last of Crag's strength before they managed to get the body\ninto the space cabin.\n\nThe men were silent while he conducted his examination. He removed the\ndead man's space suit, then stripped the clothing from the upper portion\nof his body, examining the flesh in the area where the suit had been\npunctured. The skin was unmarked. He studied the rip carefully. It was a\nclean slit.\n\n\"No meteorite,\" he said, getting to his feet. His voice was cold,\ndangerously low. Larkwell's face was grim. Nagel wore a dazed, almost\nuncomprehending expression. Richter looked thoughtful. Crag's face was\nan icy mask but his thoughts were chaotic. Fear crept into his mind.\nThis was the danger Gotch had warned him of.\n\nRichter? The saboteur? His eyes swung from man to man, coming finally to\nrest on the German. While he weighed the problem, one part of his mind\ntold him a warhead was scorching down from the sides. Time was running\nout. He came to a decision. He ordered Larkwell and Richter to strip the\npressure gear from Prochaska's body and carry it down to the plain.\n\n\"Well bury him later--after the warhead.\"\n\n\"If we're here,\" Larkwell observed.\n\n\"I have every intention of being here,\" Crag said evenly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nThe day of the warhead arrived.\n\nThe earth was a thin crescent in the sky whose light no longer paled the\nstars. They gleamed, hard and brittle against the purple-black of space,\nthe reds and yellows and brilliant hot blues of suns lying at\nunimaginable distances in the vast box of the universe. Night still\ngripped Crater Arzachel with its intolerable cold, but a zodiacal light\nin the sky whispered of a lunar dawn to come. Measured against the\nincalculable scale of space distances the rocket had but a relative inch\nto cross. That inch was almost crossed. The rocket's speed had dropped\nto a mere crawl before it entered the moon's gravitational field; then\nit had picked up again, moving ever faster toward its rendezvous with\ndestruction. Now it was storming down into the face of the land.\n\nThey buried Red Dog. Larkwell had improvised a crude scraper made of\nmetal strips from the interior of Drone Baker to aid in the task. He\nattached loops of cable to pull it. Crag, Larkwell and Richter wearily\ndragged the scraper across the plain, heaping the ash into piles, while\nNagel handled the easier job of pushing them over the edge of the rill.\n\nThe unevenness of the plain and occasional rock outcroppings made the\nwork exasperatingly slow. Crag fumed but there was little he could do to\nrectify the situation. It took the better part of eight hours before the\nrill was filled level with the plain, with only the extreme end of the\ntail containing the airlock being left accessible.\n\n\"Won't do a damn bit of good if anything big comes down,\" Larkwell\nobserved when they had finished.\n\n\"There's not much chance of a major hit,\" Crag conjectured. \"It's the\nsmall stuff that worries me.\"\n\n\"Bandit would be just as safe,\" Larkwell persisted.\n\n\"Perhaps.\" He turned away from the construction boss. Richter was\nswinging his arms and stamping his feet in an effort to keep warm. Nagel\nsat dejectedly on a rock, head buried in his arms. Crag felt a momentary\npity for him--a pity tinged with resentment. Nagel was the weak link in\ntheir armor--a threat to their safety. For all practical purposes two\nmen--he didn't include Richter--were doing the work of three. Yet, he\nthought, he couldn't exclude the German. The oxygen and supplies he\nconsumed were less than those they had obtained from Bandit and Red Dog.\nAnd Richter worked--worked with a calm, relentless purpose--more than\nmade up for Nagel's inability to shoulder his share. Maybe Richter was a\nblessing in disguise. He smiled grimly at the thought. But we're all\nshot, he told himself--all damned tired. Someone had to be the first to\ncave in. So why not Nagel?\n\nHe looked skyward. The stars reminded him of glittering chunks of ice in\nsome celestial freezebox. He moved his arms vigorously, conscious of the\nbitter cold gnawing at his bones--sharp needles stabbing his arms and\nlegs. He was cold, yet his body felt clammy. He became conscious of a\ndull ache at the nape of his neck. Thought of the warhead stirred him to\naction.\n\n\"We gotta fill this baby,\" he said, speaking to no one in particular.\n\"Oxygen ... food ... gear. There's not much time left.\"\n\nLarkwell snickered. \"You can say that again.\"\n\nCrag said thinly: \"Well make it.\" He looked sympathetically at Nagel.\n\n\"Come on, Gordon. We gotta move.\"\n\nCrag kept the men close together, in single file, with Larkwell leading.\nHe was followed by Nagel. Crag brought up at the rear. Memory of\nProchaska's fate burned in his mind and he kept his attention riveted on\nthe men ahead of him. They trudged through the night, slowly; wearily\nfollowing the serpentine path toward Bandit. He occasionally flicked on\nhis torch, splaying it over the column, checking the positions of the\nmen ahead of him. They rounded the end of a rill, half-circled the base\nof a small knoll, winding their way toward Bandit. Overhead Altair\nformed a great triangle with Deneb and Vega. Antares gleamed red from\nthe heart of Scorpius. Off to one side lay Sagittarius, the Archer. He\nthought that the giant hollow of Arzachel must be the loneliest spot in\nall the universe. He felt numbed, drained of all motion.\n\n\"Commander.\"\n\nThe single imperative call snapped him to attention.\n\n\"Come quick. Something's wrong with Nagel!\"\n\nCrag leaped ahead, flashing his torch. He saw Richter's form bent over a\nrecumbent figure while his mind registered the fact that it was the\nGerman's voice he had heard. He leaped to his side, keeping his eyes\npinned on Richter until he saw the man's hands were empty. He knelt by\nNagel--his suit was inflated! Crag breathed easier. He said briefly:\n\"Exhaustion.\"\n\nRichter nodded. An odd rumble sounded in Crag's earphones, rising and\nfalling. It took him a moment to realize it was Nagel snoring. He rose,\nin a secret sweat of mingled relief and apprehension, and looked down at\nthe recumbent form, thankful they were near Bandit.\n\nLarkwell grunted, \"Gets tougher all the time.\"\n\nIt took the three of them to get Nagel back to the rocket. Crag\npressurized the cabin and opened the sleeping man's face plate. He\ncontinued to snore, his lips vibrating with each exhalation. While he\nslept they gulped down food and freshened up. When they were ready to\nstart transferring oxygen to Red Dog, Nagel was still out. Crag\nhesitated, reluctant to leave him alone. The move could be fatal--if\nNagel were the saboteur. But if it were Larkwell, he might find himself\npitted against two men. The outlook wasn't encouraging. He cast one more\nglance at the recumbent figure and made up his mind.\n\n\"He'll be out for a long time,\" Larkwell commented, as if reading his\nmind.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Crag replaced Nagel's oxygen cylinder with a fresh one, closed\nhis face plate and opened the pressure valve on his suit He waited until\nthe others were ready and depressurized the cabin. He climbed down the\nladder thinking he would have to return before the oxygen in Nagel's\ncylinder was exhausted.\n\nEach man carried three cylinders. When they reached Red Dog, Larkwell\nscrambled down into the rill and moved the oxygen cylinders, which Crag\nand Richter lowered, into the rocket through the new airlock. They\nincreased the load to four cylinders each on the following trip, a\ndecision Crag regretted long before they reached Red Dog. It was a\nnightmarish, body-breaking trek that left him staggering with sheer\nfatigue. He marveled at Larkwell and Richter. Both were small men\nphysically. Small but tough, he thought. Tough and durable.\n\nNagel was awake, waiting for them when they returned for another load.\nHe greeted them with a slightly sheepish look. \"Guess I caved in.\"\n\n\"That you did,\" Crag affirmed. \"Not that I can blame you. I'm just about\nat that point myself.\"\n\nNagel spoke listlessly. \"Alpine sent a message.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Crag waited expectantly.\n\n\"Colonel Gotch. He said the latest figures indicated the rocket would\nstrike south of Alphons at 1350 hours.\"\n\nSouth of Alphons? How far south? It would be close, Crag thought Maybe\ntoo close. Maybe by south of Alphons Gotch meant Arzachel. Well, in that\ncase his worries would be over. He looked at the master chrono. Time for\ntwo more trips--if they hurried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were making their last trip to Bandit.\n\nLarkwell led the way with Crag bringing up the rear. They trudged\nslowly, tiredly, haunted by the shortness of time, yet they had pushed\nthemselves to their limit. They simply couldn't move faster.\n\nStrange, Crag thought, there's a rocket in the sky--a warhead, a nuclear\nbomb hurtling down from the vastness of space--slanting in on its target\nThe target: Adam Crag and crew. If we survive this ... what next? The\nquestion haunted him. How much could they take? Specifically, how much\ncould _he_ take? He shook the mood off. He'd take what he had to take.\n\nHe thought: _One more load and we'll hole up._ The prospect of ending\ntheir toil perked up his spirits. During the time of the bomb they'd\nsleep--sleep. Sleep and eat and rest and sleep some more.\n\nHalfway to Bandit he suddenly sensed something wrong. Richter's form,\nahead, was a black shadow. Beyond him, Nagel was a blob of movement. He\nflicked his torch on, shooting its beams into the darkness beyond the\noxygen man. Larkwell--there was no sign of Larkwell. He quickened his\npace, weaving the light back and forth on both sides of their path.\n\n\"Larkwell?\" His voice was imperative.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Larkwell?\" Silence mocked him. Richter stopped short. Nagel turned,\ncoming toward him in the night.\n\n\"Where's Larkwell?\"\n\n\"He was ahead of me.\" It was Nagel.\n\nRichter shrugged. \"Can't see that far ahead.\"\n\nCrag's thoughts came in a jumbled train. Had Larkwell been hit by a\nmeteorite? No, they would have seen him fall.\n\n\"Must have drawn ahead,\" Richter observed quietly. There was something\nin his voice that disturbed Crag.\n\n\"Why doesn't he answer?\" Nagel cut in. \"Why? why?\"\n\n\"Larkwell! Larkwell, answer me!\" Silence. A great silence. A suspicion\nstruck his mind. Crag caught his breath, horrified at the thought.\n\n\"Let's get moving--fast.\" He struck out in the direction of Bandit,\nforcing his tired legs into a trot. His boots struck against the plain,\nshooting needles of pain up his legs. His body grew sweaty and clammy,\nhot and cold by turn. A chill foreboding gripped him. He tried to light\nthe way with his torch. The rocks made elusive shadows--shadows that\ndanced, receded, grew and shortened by turn, until he couldn't\ndiscriminate between shadow and rock. He stumbled--fell heavily--holding\nhis breath fearfully until he was re-assured his suit hadn't ripped.\nAfter that he slowed his pace, moving more carefully. His torch was a\nyellow eye preceding him across the plain.\n\nBandit rose before him, jutting against the stars, an ominous black\nshadow. He moved his light, playing it over the plain. Larkwell--where\nwas Larkwell? The yellow beam caressed the rocket, wandering over its\nbase.\n\nSomething was wrong--dreadfully wrong. It took him an instant to realize\nthat the rope ladder had vanished. He swung the torch upward. Its yellow\nbeams framed Larkwell's body against the hatch.\n\n\"Larkwell.\" Crag called imperiously.\n\nThe figure in the hatch didn't move. Richter came up and stood beside\nhim. Crag cast a helpless glance at him. The German was silent,\nmotionless, his face turned upward toward the space cabin as if he were\nlost in contemplation. Crag called again, anger in his voice. There was\na moment of silence before a voice tinkled in his earphones.\n\n\"Larkwell? There's no Larkwell here.\" The words were spoken slowly,\ntauntingly.\n\nCrag snapped wrathfully: \"This is no time to be joking. Toss that ladder\ndown and make it quick.\" The silence mocked him for a long moment before\nLarkwell answered.\n\n\"I'm not joking, Mister Crag.\" He emphasized the word _Mister_. \"There\nis no Larkwell. At least, not here.\"\n\nA fearful premonition came to Crag. He turned toward Richter. The German\nhadn't moved. He touched his arm and began edging back until he was well\nclear of the base of the rocket. Nagel stood off to one side, seeming\nhelpless and forlorn in the drama being enacted. Crag marshaled his\nthoughts.\n\n\"Larkwell?\"\n\n\"My name is Malin ... if it interest you, Mister Crag. Igor Malin.\" The\nwords were spoken in a jeer.\n\nCrag felt the anger well inside him. All the pent-up emotion he had\nsuppressed since leaving earth boiled volcanically until his body shook\nlike a leaf. The scar on his face tingled, burned, and he involuntarily\nreached to rub it before remembering his helmet. He waited until the\nfirst tremors had passed, then spoke, trying to keep his voice calm.\n\n\"You're disturbed, Larkwell. You don't know what you're doing.\"\n\n\"No? You think not?\"\n\nCrag bit his lip vexedly. He spoke again:\n\n\"So, you're our saboteur?\"\n\n\"Call me that, if you wish.\"\n\n\"And a damned traitor!\"\n\n\"Not a traitor, Mister Crag. To the contrary, I have been very faithful\nto my country.\"\n\n\"You're a traitor,\" Crag stated coldly.\n\n\"Come, be reasonable. A traitor is one who betrays his country. You work\nfor your side ... I work for mine. It's as simple as that.\" He spoke\nlanguidly but Crag knew he was laughing at him. He made an effort to\ncontrol his his temper.\n\n\"You were born in the United States,\" Crag pursued.\n\n\"Wrong again.\"\n\n\"Raised in the Maple Hill Orphanage. I have your personnel record.\"\n\n\"Ah, that _was_ your Martin Larkwell.\" The voice taunted. \"But I became\nMartin Larkwell one sunny day in Buenos Aires. Part of, shall we say, a\nwell planned tactic? No, I am not your Martin Larkwell, Mister Crag. And\nI'm happy enough to be able to shed his miserable identity.\"\n\n\"What do you expect to gain?\" Crag asked. He kept his voice reasonable,\nhedging for time.\n\n\"Come, now, Mister Crag, you know the stakes. The moon goes to the\ncountry whose living representative is based here when the U.N. makes\nits decision--which should be soon. Note that I said _living_.\"\n\n\"Most of the supplies are in Red Dog,\" Crag pointed out.\n\n\"There's enough here for one man.\" The voice was maddeningly bland in\nCrag's earphones.\n\n\"You won't live through the rockstorm,\" Crag promised savagely.\n\n\"The chances of a direct hit are pretty remote. You said that yourself.\"\n\n\"Maybe....\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me.\"\n\n\"Damn you, Larkwell, you can't do this. Throw that ladder down.\" It was\nNagel. Again the scream came over the earphones: \"Throw it down, I say.\"\n\n\"You've made a mistake,\" Crag cut in calmly. \"We can survive. There's\nenough oxygen in Red Dog.\"\n\n\"I opened each cylinder you handed down,\" the man in the hatch stated\nmatter-of-factly. \"In fact, I opened all of the cylinders in Red Dog.\nSorry, Mister Crag, but the oxygen's all gone. Soon you'll follow\nProchaska.\"\n\n\"You did that?\" Crag's voice was a savage growl.\n\n\"This is war, Mister Crag. Prochaska was an enemy.\" He spoke almost\nconversationally. Crag had the feeling that everyone was crazy. It was a\nfantastic mixed-up dream, a nightmare. Soon he'd awaken....\n\n\"Coward!\" Nagel screamed. \"Coward--damned coward!\"\n\nThe figure in the hatch vanished into the rocket. He's armed! Crag's\nmind seized on die knowledge that two automatic rifles were still in\nBandit. He ordered the men back, alarmed. Nagel stood his ground\nscreaming maledictions.\n\n\"Come back, Gordon,\" Crag snapped.\n\nMalin reappeared a few seconds later holding a rifle. Crag snapped his\ntorch off, leaving the plain in darkness.\n\n\"Move back,\" he ordered again.\n\n\"I won't. I'm going to get into that rocket,\" Nagel babbled. He lunged\nforward and was lost in the darkness before Crag could stop him.\n\n\"Nagel, get back here! That's an order.\"\n\n\"I won't ... I won't!\" His scream was painful in Crag's ears.\n\nA yellow beam flashed down from the hatch and ran over the ground at the\nbase of the rocket. It stopped, pinning Nagel in a circle of light. His\nface was turned up. He was cursing wildly, violently.\n\n\"Nagel!\" Crag shouted a warning. Nagel shook his fist toward the hatch\nstill screaming. Flame spurted from the black rectangle and he fell,\ncrumpled on the plain.\n\n\"Move further back,\" Richter said quietly.\n\nCrag stood indecisively.\n\nRichter spoke more imperatively. \"He's gone. Move back--while you can.\"\n\n\"Happy dreams, Mister Crag ... and a long sleep.\" The hatch closed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nNagel was dead. He lay sprawled in the ash, a pitifully small limp\nbundle in a deflated suit. He had gotten his wish--he would never see\nearth again. _Under the wide and starry sky_ ... Now he was asleep with\nhis dream. Asleep in the fantastically bizarre world he had come to\nlove. But the fact still remained: Nagel had been murdered. Murdered in\ncold blood. Murdered by the killer of little Max Prochaska. And now the\nkiller was in command! Crag looked down at the crumpled body, reliving\nthe scene, feeling it burn in his brain.\n\nFinally he rose, filled with a terrible cold anger.\n\n\"There's one thing he forgot....\"\n\n\"What?\" Richter asked.\n\n\"The cylinders in Drone Baker. We didn't move them.\"\n\nHe looked at his oxygen gauge. Low. Baker lay almost four miles to the\neast on a trail seldom used. They had never traversed it by night.\nBaker, in fact, had become the forgotten drone. He probed his mind.\nThere was a spur of intervening rock ... rills ... a twisty trail\nthreading between lofty pinnacles....\n\n\"Well have to hurry,\" Richter urged.\n\n\"Let's move....\"\n\nThey started toward the east, walking silently, side by side, their\nformer relationship forgotten. Crag accepted the fact that their\nsurvival, the success of his mission--Gotch's well-laid plans--could\nvery well depend upon what Richter did. Or didn't do. He had suddenly\nbecome an integral part in the complex machine labeled STEP ONE.\n\nThey reached the ridge which lay between them and the drone and started\nupward, climbing slowly, silently, measuring distance against time in\nwhich time represented life-sustaining oxygen. The climb over the ridge\nproved extremely hazardous. Despite their torches they more than once\nbrushed sharp needles of rock and stumbled over low jagged extrusions.\nThey were panting heavily before they reached the crest and started down\nthe opposite side. They reached the plain and Crag checked his oxygen\ngauge. The reading alarmed him. He didn't say anything to Richter but\nspeeded his pace. The German's breath became a hoarse rumble in the\nearphones.\n\n\"Stop!\" There was consternation in Richter's warning cry. Crag\nsimultaneously saw the chasm yawning almost at their feet.\n\nRichter said quietly: \"Which way?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know.\" Crag flashed his torch into the rill. It was wide\nand deep, a cleft with almost vertical sides. They would have to go\naround it. He flashed the light in both directions along the plain.\nThere was no visible end to the fissure.\n\nHe studied the stars briefly and said, \"East is to our right. We'll have\nto work along the rill and gamble that it ends soon.\"\n\nIt did. They rounded its end and resumed their way toward the east. Crag\nhad to stop several times to get his bearings. The shadows danced before\nthe torch beams confusing him, causing odd illusions. He fell to\nnavigating by the stars. It occurred to him that Baker, measured against\nthe expanse of the plain, would be but a speck of dust.\n\nRichter's voice broke reflectively into his earphones, \"Oxygen's about\ngone. Looks like this place is going to wind up a graveyard.\"\n\nCrag said stubbornly: \"We'll make it.\"\n\n\"It better be soon....\"\n\n\"We should be about there.\"\n\nThey topped a small rise and dropped back to the plain. The needle of\nDrone Baker punctuated the sky--blotted out the stars. Oxygen ...\noxygen. The word was sweet music. He broke into a run, reached its base\nand clawed at the ladder leading to its hold. He got inside panting\nheavily, conscious of a slightly dizzy feeling, and grabbed the first\ncylinder he saw. He hooked it into his suit system before looking down\ntoward the plain. Richter was not in sight. Filled with alarm he grabbed\nanother cylinder and hurried down the ladder. His torch picked up\nRichter's form near the base of the rocket. He hooked the cylinder into\nhis suit system and turned the valve, hoping he was in time, then\nflashed his torch on the German's face. He seemed to be breathing. Crag\ncalled experimentally into the earphone, without answer. He finally\nsnapped off the torch to conserve the battery and waited, his mind a\njumble of thoughts.\n\n\"Commander...?\"\n\n\"Good. I was scared for a moment.\" He flashed the torch down. Richter's\neyes were open; he was smiling faintly.\n\n\"Not a bad way to go,\" he managed to say. \"Nice and easy.\"\n\n\"The only place you're going is Red Dog.\"\n\n\"I'll be okay in a minute.\"\n\n\"Sure you will.\"\n\nRichter struggled to his feet breathing deeply. \"I'm okay.\"\n\n\"We'd better get some more oxygen--enough to last through the\nfireworks,\" Crag suggested.\n\nThey returned to the drone and procured eight cylinders, lowering them\nwith a piece of line supplied for the purpose. They climbed down to the\nplain, packed the cylinders and started for Red Dog.\n\n\"Going to be close but we'll make it,\" Crag said, thinking of the\nwarhead.\n\nRichter answered confidently: \"We'll make it.\"\n\nStrange, Crag thought, I wind up fighting with the enemy to keep one of\nmy own crew from murdering me. Enemy? No, he could no longer brand\nRichter an enemy. He felt a pang of regret over the way he'd mistrusted\nhim. Still, there had been no other course. A thought jolted him. He\nspoke casually, aware he might be stepping on Richter's toes: \"There's\none thing I don't understand....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Larkwell's an enemy agent....\" He hesitated.\n\n\"And...?\"\n\n\"Why didn't he attempt to solicit your aid?\" Crag finished bluntly.\n\n\"You're a spaceman, Commander, not an intelligence agent.\"\n\n\"I don't get the connection.\"\n\n\"An agent trusts no one. And a saboteur is the lone wolf of the agents.\nTrust me? Ha! He'd just as soon trust your good Colonel Gotch. No,\nLarkwell wouldn't have trusted me. Never.\"\n\nCrag was silent. An agent who couldn't trust a soldier of his own\ncountry, even when the chips were down? It was a philosophy he couldn't\nunderstand. As for Larkwell! He vowed he'd live long enough to see him\ndead. More, he'd kill him himself. He was planning how he'd accomplish\nit when they reached the rill where Red Dog was buried. He switched his\ntorch on and ran it along the edge of the chasm until he located the\nrope ladder leading down to the airlock.\n\n\"You lower 'em and I'll pack 'em.\" Crag ordered. He descended into the\nrill and began moving the cylinders Richter lowered to him. Finished, he\nexamined the cylinders they had brought earlier. Empty! His lips set in\na thin line as he examined the cylinders which the rocket had brought\nfrom earth. Empty ... all empty. Larkwell had done a thorough job.\n\nHe gritted his teeth. Before he was through he'd ram the empty cylinders\ndown Larkwell's throat. Yeah, and that wasn't all. He contemplated the\nstep-by-step procedure. Larkwell would die. Die horribly. He looked\ntoward the hatch wondering what was detaining Richter. He waited a\nmoment, then climbed back to the plain. The German was nowhere in sight.\n\n\"Richter?\" There was no answer. He checked his interphone to make sure\nit was working and called again. Silence. He swept his torch over the\nplain. No Richter. The German had vanished ... disappeared into the\nblack maw of the crater.\n\n\"Richter! Richter, answer me...!\" Silence. Apprehension swept him. He\ncalled again, desperately:\n\n\"Richter!\"\n\n\"I'm all right, Commander.\" Richter's voice was low, seeming to have\ncome from a distance. \"You'd better get back into Red Dog.\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" Crag demanded.\n\n\"I have a job to do.\"\n\n\"Come back.\" The German didn't answer. Crag was about to start in\npursuit when he realized he didn't have the faintest idea what direction\nRichter had taken. He hesitated, baffled and fearful by turn.\n\nPeriodically he called his name without receiving an answer. He fumed,\nwondering what the German had in mind. He couldn't get into Bandit and,\nbesides, he was unarmed. He popped back into Red Dog and looked at the\nchrono. If Gotch's figures were right the warhead would strike in four\nminutes. He climbed out of the rill.\n\n\"Warhead due in less than four minutes,\" he called into his mike.\n\n\"Get back into Red Dog, Commander,\" Richter insisted.\n\nCrag snapped irritably: \"What the hell are you trying to do.\"\n\n\"Commander, many people have crossed the frontier--from East to West.\nMany others have wanted to.\"\n\n\"I don't get you.\"\n\n\"I had to come all the way to Arzachel to find my frontier, Commander.\"\n\n\"Richter, come back,\" Crag ordered, his voice level.\n\n\"There's nothing you can do. You didn't know it but when I landed here I\ncrossed the frontier, Commander. I went from East to West, on the moon.\"\n\n\"Richter...?\"\n\n\"Now I am free.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, but you'd better get back\nhere--and pronto. You'll get massacred if you're on the plain when the\nrocket hits.\" Inwardly he was shaken. \"There's not a damn thing you can\ndo about Larkwell.\"\n\n\"Ah, but there is. He forgot two things, Commander. The oxygen in Baker\nwas only the first.\"\n\n\"And the second?\"\n\nRichter did not answer.\n\nCrag called again. No answer. He waited, uncertain what to do next.\n\nThe ground twisted violently under his feet. The warhead! A series of\ndiminishing quakes rolled the plain in sharp jolts. Missed Arzachel, he\nthought jubilantly. It missed ... missed. He twisted his head upward.\nThe sky was black, black, a great black spread that reached to infinity,\nbroken only by the brilliance of the stars. Off to one side Betelgeuse\nwas a baleful red eye in the shoulder of Orion.\n\nA picture of what was happening flashed through his mind. Somewhere\nbetween Alphons and Arzachel thousands of tons of rock were hurtling\nupward in great ballistic trajectories, parabolic courses which would\nbring them crashing back onto the lunar surface. Many would escape,\nwould hurtle through space until infinity ended. Some would be caught in\nthe gravisphere of planets, would crash down into strange worlds. But\nmost would smash back on the moon. Rocks ranging in size from grains of\ndust to giants capable of smashing skyscrapers would fall like rain.\n\n\"Richter! Richter!\" He repeated the call several times. No answer. He\nswept his torch futilely over the plain. Richter was a dedicated man. If\nthe coming rain of death held any fears for him he failed to show it. He\nlooked up again, fancying that he saw movement against the stars.\nSomewhere up there mountains were hurtling through the void. He\nhurriedly descended into the rill, hesitated, then moved into the\nrocket. He again hesitated before leaving the airlock open. Richter\nmight return.\n\nAfter a while he felt the first thud, a jolt that shook the rocket and\ntraveled through his body like a wave. The floor danced under his feet.\nHe held his breath expectantly, suppressing an instant of panic. The\nrocket vibrated several times but none of the jolts was as severe as the\nfirst. He waited, aware of the stillness, a silence so deep it was like\na great thunder. The big stuff must all be down. The thought bolstered\nhis courage. The idea of being squashed like a bug was not appealing. He\nwaited, wondering if Richter had survived. He thought of Larkwell and\ninvoluntarily clenched his fists. Larkwell, or Igor Malin--if he\nlived--would be his first order of business. He remembered Nagel and\nProchaska and began planning how he would kill the man in Bandit. He\nwaited a while longer. The absolute silence grated his ears. Now, he\nthought.\n\nHe slipped on a fresh oxygen cylinder, and hooked a spare into his belt,\nthen pawed through the supplies until he found fresh batteries for his\ntorch. Finally he got one of the automatic rifles from Red Dog's\narsenal. After that he climbed up to the plain. He called Richter's name\nseveral times over the phones, with little hope of answer. He looked at\nthe sky, then swept his torch over the moonscape. A feeling of solitude\nassailed him. For the first time since leaving earth he was totally\nalone.\n\nThe last time he had experienced such a feeling was when he'd pushed an\nexperimental rocket ship almost to the edge of space. He shook off the\nfeeling and debated what to do. Richter undoubtedly was dead. Had\nLarkwell--or was it Malin?--survived the rock storm? Spurred to action,\nhe turned toward Bandit. Nothing seemed changed, he thought, or almost\nnothing. Here and there the smooth ash was pitted. Once he came to a\njagged rock which lay almost astride his path. He was sure it hadn't\nbeen there before.\n\nHe moved more cautiously as he drew near Bandit, remembering that the\noccupant of the rocket was armed. He climbed a familiar knoll, searching\nthe plain ahead with his torch. He stopped, puzzled, flashing the light\nto check his bearings. Satisfied he was on the right knoll he played the\nlight ahead again while moving down to the plain. He walked slowly\nforward. Once he dropped to the ground to see if he could discern the\nbulk of Bandit against the stars. Finally he walked faster, sweeping the\ntorch over the plain in wide arcs. Suddenly he stopped. Gone! Bandit was\ngone! It couldn't be. It might be demolished, smashed flat, but it\ncouldn't disappear. He wondered if he were having hallucinations. No, he\nwas sane ... completely sane. He began calling Richter's name. The\nsilence mocked him. Finally he turned back toward Red Dog.\n\nCrag slept. He slept with the airlock closed and the cabin flooded with\noxygen. He slept the sleep of the dead, a luxurious sleep without\nthought or dream. When he awakened, he ate and donned the pressure suit,\nthinking he would have to get more oxygen from the drone. He opened the\nhatch and scrambled out. The plain was light. The sun was an intolerable\ncircle hanging at the very edge of the horizon. He blinked his eyes to\nget them used to the glare.\n\nHe studied the plain for a long time, then hefted the rifle and started\ntoward Bandit before he remembered there was no Bandit. No Bandit? When\nhe reached the top of the knoll, he knew he was right. Bandit\nunaccountably was gone. He searched the area in wide circles. The\nquestion grew in his mind. He found several twisted pieces of metal--a\njagged piece of engine. Abruptly he found Richter.\n\nHe was dead. His suit hung limp, airless against his body. He stared at\nthe object next to Richter. It was a moment before he recognized it as\nthe rocket launcher.\n\n\"_He forgot two things, Commander...._\"\n\nNow he understood Richter's words. Now he knew the motive that had\ndriven him onto the plain in the face of the rock storm. Richter had\nused the launcher to destroy Bandit, to destroy the murderer of\nProchaska and Nagel. He marveled that Richter could have carried the\nheavy weapon. Once, before, he had watched two men struggle under its\nweight Richter must have mustered every ounce of his strength.\n\nHe looked at the fallen form for a long time. Richter had crossed his\nfrontier. At last he turned and started toward Red Dog. Adam Crag, the\nMan in the Moon. Now he was really the Man in the Moon. The only Man.\nColonel Crag, Commanding Officer, Pickering Field. General Crag of the\nFirst Moon expeditionary Force. Adam Crag, Emperor of Luna. He\nlaughed--a mirthless laugh. Damned if he couldn't be anything he wanted\nto be--on the Moon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun climbed above the rim of Arzachel transforming the vast\ndepressed interior of the crater into a caldron of heat and glare. In\nthe morning of the lunar day the rock structures rising from the plain\ncast lengthy black shadows over the ashy floor--a mosaic in black and\nwhite. Crag kept busy. He stripped the drones of their scant amount of\nusable supplies--mainly oxygen cylinders from Baker--and set up a new\ncommunication post in Red Dog. In the first hours of the new morning\nGotch named the saboteur. Crag listened, wearily. Just then he wasn't\ninterested in the fact that an alert intelligence agent had doubted that\na man of 5' 5\" could have been a star basketball player, as the\nSuperintendent of the Maple Hill Orphanage had said. He expressed his\nfeelings by shutting off the communicator in the middle of the Colonel's\nexplanation.\n\nThe sun climbed, slowly, until it hung overhead, ending a morning which\nhad lasted seven earth days in length. At midday the shadows had all but\nvanished. He finished marking the last of three crosses and stepped back\nto survey his work. He read the names at the head of the mounds: Max\nProchaska, Gordon Nagel, Otto Richter. Each was followed by a date. Out\non the plain were other graves, those of the crewmen of Bandit and Red\nDog. He had marked each mound with a small pile of stones. Later it\nstruck him that someday there might be peace. Someday, someone might\nwant to look at one of those piles of stone. He returned and added a\nnotation to each.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun moved imperceptibly across the sky. It seemed to hover above the\nhorizon for a long while before slipping beyond the rim. Night seemed\neternal. Crag worked and slept and waited. He measured his oxygen,\nrationed his food, and planned. He was tough. He'd survive. If only to\nread Gotch off, he promised himself savagely.\n\nThe sun came up again. In time it set. Rose and set.\n\nCrag waited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe watched the silvery ship let down. It backed down slowly, gracefully,\ncoming to rest on the ashy plain with scarcely a jar. Somehow he didn't\nfeel jubilant. He waited, gravely, watching the figures that came from\nthe ship. He wasn't surprised that the first one was Colonel Michael\nGotch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater they gathered in the small crew room of the Astronaut, the name of\nthe first atom-powered spaceship. They waited solemnly--Gotch and Crag,\nthe pilot, and two crewmen--waiting for the thin man to speak. Just now\nhe was sitting at the small pulldown chow table peering at some papers,\nrecords of the moon expedition. Finally he looked up.\n\n\"It seems to me that your Nation's claim to the Moon is justified,\" he\nsaid. The words were fateful. The thin man's name was Fredrick Gunter.\nHe was also Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Jeff Sutton, although experienced in journalistic and technical\n    writings, has only recently turned his hand to novels with the\n    result that _First on the Moon_ is also his first novel. A native\n    Californian, and a Marine veteran, he is presently employed as a\n    research engineer for Convair-San Diego, specializing appropriately\n    enough for this novel in problems of high altitude survival. He says\n    of himself:\n\n    \"I have long been a science-fiction reader (a common ailment among\n    scientists and engineers). On the personal side, a number of factors\n    have coalesced to pin me to the typewriter. I am living in--and\n    working in--a world of missiles, rockets, and far-reaching dreams.\n    In many areas the border between science-fiction and science\n    suddenly has become a lace curtain. It is a world I have some\n    acquaintance with--and fits very nicely into my desire to write.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                     SCIENCE-FICTION AT ITS BEST\n\n                  Luna Was The Goal, Earth The Prize\n\n     It was a top secret, and yet the enemy knew. They knew that the\n     Americans were about to send a manned rocket to the moon and\n     thereby claim it for Old Glory. They knew also that whoever held\n     the moon would command the Earth ... and they were determined to\n     stop us at all costs!\n\n     When assassination and sabotage failed to stop the take-off, they'd\n     have to use even more drastic measures. There might be an H-bomb\n     loaded rocket missile, there could be a Red spaceship with a\n     suicide crew, and there was always the possibility of their placing\n     a spy aboard the U.S. rocket.\n\n     FIRST ON THE MOON is a thrilling adventure of the very near future.\n     Written with up-to-the-minute accuracy by a professional aviation\n     research engineer, it is a top-notch novel that is science-fiction\n     only by the thinnest margin!\n\n                              AN ACE BOOK\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of First on the Moon, by Jeff Sutton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIRST ON THE MOON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 43235-8.txt or 43235-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/3/2/3/43235/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
