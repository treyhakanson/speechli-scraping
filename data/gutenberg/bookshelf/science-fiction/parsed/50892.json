As Hatter slumped unconscious he touched the\nhidden switch.\n\nA shock, then darkness.\n\nWhat first came to him out of the humming blackout mist was his own\nname: Marcusson. Al Marcusson, just turned sixteen that Saturday in\nJune, that green-leafed day his father had called him out to the back\nyard. They had sat on discount-house furniture under the heavy maple,\nAl who wore jeans and sneakers and a resigned expression, his father\nwho wore glasses, a sport shirt, slacks, eyelet shoes and a curious\nreckless smile, a smile that didn't belong in the picture.\n\n\"Now you're sixteen, Al, there's something I have to tell you,\" his\nfather had begun. \"My father told me when I turned sixteen, and his\nfather told him. First, the name of our family isn't Marcusson. It's\nMarcopoulos. Your name's Alexander Marcopoulos.\"\n\n\"What? Dad, you must be kidding! Look, all the records....\"\n\n\"The records don't go back far enough. Our name was changed four\ngenerations back, but the legal records disappeared in the usual\nconvenient courthouse fire. As far as anyone knows, our family's name's\nalways been Marcusson. My grandfather went to Minnesota and settled\namong the Swedes there. Unlike most foreigners he'd taken pains to\nlearn good English beforehand. And Swedish. He was good at languages.\"\nFor a moment the out-of-place smile came back. \"All our family is.\nLanguages, math, getting along with people, seldom getting lost or\nconfused. You better pay attention, Al. This is the only time I'm going\nto speak of our family, like my father. We never bothered much, by the\nway, about how our name was written. You can believe me or think I sat\nin the sun too long, but I'll tell you how our most famous relatives\nspelled it: Marco Polo.\"\n\n\"Oh, now....\"\n\n\"Never mind what you think now. Besides, I won't answer any questions,\nanyway. My father didn't and he was right. I found out some things by\nmyself later; you'll probably find out more. For example, the best job\nfor us is still exploring. That's why I became an oil geologist, and it\npaid off. Another thing: learning the legends of the place you're in,\nif you take up exploring, can mean the difference between success and a\nbroken neck. That's all, boy. Guess I'll get your mother some peonies\nfor the supper table.\"\n\nAl Marcusson had gone up quietly to his room. Later, his special gift\nfor languages and math got him through college and engineering school;\nhis sense of direction and lack of inner-ear trouble helped to get him\nchosen for Astronaut training while he was in the Air Force.\n\nWhile in training at the Cape he had met and married a luscious\nbrunette librarian in one of the sponge-fishing towns, a brunette with\na rather complicated last name that became forgotten as she turned\ninto Mrs. Marcusson, and unbeatable recipes for the most bewitching\ncocktails since Circe held the shaker for Ulysses.\n\nMarcusson's hobbies included scuba diving, electronic tinkering and\nreading. His psychiatrists noted a tendency to reserve, even secrecy,\nwhich was not entirely bad in a man who worked with classified material\nand had to face long periods of time alone. Besides, his ability to get\nalong with people largely compensated.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith slowly returning consciousness the last months of training swam\nin Al Marcusson's mind. The orbital flight--the only part of it he'd\nreally enjoyed was the quarter-hour alone with SARAH, the electronic\nbeacon, cut off from Control and even from the rescue team just over\nthe horizon, alone with the music of wind and sea.\n\nFor the moon shot he'd been responsible for communications, recording\nand sensing systems inside the capsule, as Hatter had for the\nlife-support systems and their two back-up men for propulsion and\nground systems coordination respectively. He relived the maddening,\nrisky business of the master switch to be secretly connected with the\ncapsule's several brains and camouflaged. The strap to be weakened.\nThen the blind terror of launch when his pulse had topped 120; blurred\nvision, clenched teeth, the suit digging into him, the brief relief of\nweightlessness erased by the cramped, terrifying ride filled with new\nsensations and endless petty tasks. The camera eye pitilessly trained\non his helmet. The way things had of staying there when you'd put them\naway. On Earth--already it was \"On Earth,\" as if Earth was a port he'd\nsailed from--you put things out of your mind, but here they bobbed\nbefore you still, like the good luck charm in its little leather bag,\nfor instance, the charm his wife had tied to one of his fastener tabs\nand that kept dancing in the air like a puppet, jerking every time he\nbreathed.\n\nEvery time he breathed in the familiar sweat-plastic-chemicals smell,\nfamiliar because he'd been smelling it in training, in the transfer\ntruck, in the capsule mock-up for months. All that should be new and\nadventurous had become stale and automatic through relentless training.\nHis eyes rested on the color-coded meters and switches that were\nassociated with nausea in the centrifuge tumbler-trainer. The couch\nmade him think of long hours in the chlorinated pool--he always used to\ncome out with his stomach rumbling and wrinkled white fingers, despite\nthe tablets and the silicone creams. His skin itched beneath the\nadhesive pads that held the prying electrodes to his body, itched like\nthe salt and sand itch he felt after swimming between training bouts.\nIt was still Florida air he breathed, but filters had taken out its\noil-fouled hot smell, its whiffs of canteen cooking, fish, seaweed and\nraw concrete in the sun. Hatter's and his own sing-song bit talk, so\ndeliciously new to television audiences, rang trite in his own ears: a\nmakeshift vocabulary, primer sentences chosen for maximum transmission\nefficiency to Control.\n\nThe Control center he remembered from having watched orbital flights\nhimself. Machines that patiently followed pulse rate, breathing,\ntemperature. Squiggly lines, awkward computer handwriting, screens\nwhere dots jumped, screens that showed instrument panels, screens\nwhere his own helmet showed, and inside it the squirming blob that was\nhis own face, rendered as a kind of rubberized black-and-white tragic\nmask. He felt the metal ears turning, questing for signals, the little\nblack boxes, miniaturized colossi tracking, listening, spewing tape. On\nthe capsule itself--all folded in like Japanese water flowers--sensors,\ncameras, listeners, analyzers should have burgeoned on impact, shot up,\nreached out, grasped, retracted, analyzed, counted, transmitted.\n\nBut he'd cut the switch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAl Marcusson blinked awake.\n\nHe set about freeing himself, a task comparable to getting a butterfly\nalive out of a spider web. Every creak of his suit and of the moulded\ncouch sounded loud and flat in the newly silent capsule. His breathing\nsoughed about him. But no signal went out from the electrodes taped to\nhis chest to say that his heart beat had again topped a hundred, that\nhe sweated, that his stomach contracted--even though he was under no\ngravity strain, the emergency cooling worked, and his latest no-crumbs,\nlow-residue meal had been welcomed by the same stomach an hour earlier.\n\nHe sat up. The port gave off a pale creamy glow. He leaned forward and\ncould see nothing except for a cream- or eggshell-colored mist, even\nand opaque.\n\nHe undid his glove-rings and took off his gloves. By the gleam of his\nwrist-light he checked whether Hatter was breathing correctly from his\nsuit, visor down, and not the capsule's air, then put his gloves on\nagain and bled the air slowly out. They were not supposed to leave the\ncapsule, of course. Still the possibility of having to check or repair\nsomething had had to be considered and it was theoretically possible.\nHe began the nerve-rasping egress procedure, through the narrow\nigloo-lock that seemed to extend painful claws and knobs to catch at\nevery loop and fold of his suit. At last he gave a frantic wiggle and\nrolled free.\n\nBecause of the dead switch, turning antennae circled in vain, pens\nstopped reeling out ink, screens stayed blank. The men in the control\nroom activated emergency signals but got no triggered responses.\nMeanwhile, television reporters sent frantic requests for background\nmaterial fillers, their \"and now back to's\" falling thick and fast.\n\nAl Marcusson bounced on a kind of lumpy featherbed two or three times\nbefore coming to rest in the same eggshell soup. Dust. Moon dust that\nhad no particular reason for dropping back now cocooned the ship. He\nstood up with great care and staggered straight out, putting his feet\ndown slowly to minimize dust puffs. The mist thinned and he rubbed the\ngloves against his visor and goggled.\n\nCliffs, craters, spines, crests and jags stood there as in the\nphotographs except for a curious staginess he realized came from the\nharsh footlights effect of the twilight zone they'd landed in and from\nthe shorter horizon with its backdrop of old black velvet dusty with\nstars. But the colors!\n\nRuby cliffs, surfaces meteor-pitted in places to a rosy bloom, rose to\npinnacles of dull jade that fell again in raw emerald slopes; saffron\nsplashes of small craters punctuated the violet sponge of scattered\nlava, topaz stalagmites reared against sapphire crests, amethyst spines\npierced agate ridges ... and on every ledge, in every hollow, pale\nmoondust lay like a blessing.\n\nWhen you were a kid, did you ever wake up at night in a Pullman berth\nand hear the snoring and looked at the moonwashed countryside knowing\nyou only were awake and hugging the knowledge to yourself? Did you ever\nset off alone at dawn to fish or hunt and watch the slow awakening of\ntrees? Did you ever climb the wall into an abandoned estate and explore\nthe park and suddenly come upon a statue half-hidden in honeysuckle, a\nstatue with a secret smile?\n\nAl Marcusson sat by himself on the twilight zone of the Moon and\nwatched the sun shining through cloudy glass arches and throwing on\nmoondust the same colored shadows that it throws through the great\nstained-glass windows on the flagstones of Chartres cathedral. He\nlooked up at Earth, now in \"New Earth\" position, a majestic ring of\nblue fire flushed with violet, red and gold at the crescent where\nclouds flashed white iridescence. He jerked free the little bag that\nheld his good luck charm and waited.\n\nThey came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could see them silhouetted against Earth, the long undulating V\nof them. Now he could discern their wings beating in the vacuum that\ncouldn't support them and heard the wild lonely honking through the\nvacuum that couldn't transmit sound. White wings surged steadily\nnearer. Soon there was a tempest of white, a tempest that stirred no\ndust, and the swans settled about him.\n\nAl Marcusson stood up.\n\n\"My Lady Selene,\" he began, speaking carefully although he knew that\nthe sound could not be heard outside his helmet. \"My Lady Luna, my Lady\nof the Swans, I greet you. I know of you through legends: I know you\nare Aphrodite the Swan-Rider, goddess of love that drives to suicide.\nI know you are the White Goddess, the Three-Women-in-One, who changes\nyour slaves into swans. I know of your twin daughters, Helen the fair,\nbane of Troy, and dark Clytemnestra, Mycenae's destroyer. I know of\nyour flight as the Wyrd of death who took great Beowulf of the Geats,\nof your quests as Diana of the cruel moonlit hunts; I remember your\nswan-wings shadowing the hosts of Prince Igor on the steppes, I have\nseen the rings of your sacred Hansa swans decorating the moon-shaped\nsteps of temples in Ceylon, your flights of swans and geese on painted\ntombs beyond the Nile. The witches of my own Thessaly called upon you\nto work their spells. On the feast of Beltane, on the first of May,\nwith hawthorn branches blooming white as your swans, the Celts did you\nhonor. The folk on the Rhine brought you figurines of white clay and\nlong remembered your wild Walpurgisnacht. But as other beliefs drove\nout the old, you went from the minds of men to those of children.\nOnly in Andersen's tales do you still change your slaves into swans,\nonly children understand the spells held in the foolish rhymes of\nMother Goose. Children know of the lady who flies on goose's back, her\ncape dark behind her, and each generation in turn still listens to\nyour spells, my Lady of the Swans. And sometimes poets, and sometimes\nhunters, and sometimes lovers look up at the moon and are afraid and\nacknowledge your power.\"\n\nAl Marcusson stopped. The birds ringed him in. He held up his good luck\ncharm, a small, carved rock-crystal swan, such as are found in the very\nancient tombs of the bronze-age sea kings of the Aegean.\n\n\"My Lady Selene,\" he cried, \"I bring an offering! I came alone, before\nthe others, to tell you the new beliefs now come to your dwelling. I\ncame to warn you, my Lady of the Swans, to beg you not to be wrathful\nagainst us, unwilling intruders, to ask you to take up your dwelling in\nanother place, but not to deprive us of poetry, of witching spells and\ndreams, and all that the Moon has meant to us.\" He threw the crystal\nswan before him.\n\nThe plumes about him foamed and a snowy form emerged, a moonstone with\nblack opal eyes who smiled and began to sing. Marcusson's knees gave\nand his eyes closed. Then she spread great swan wings and soared,\ncircling far lest her shadow fall on the crumpled spacesuited figure.\nShe rose. And her swans--her thousand myriad swans--rose after her out\nof cracks, caves and craters, from beneath overhangs, from ledges,\nhollows and rock-falls, their plumes at first stained with the colors\nof the stone. They winged away, V after sinuous V, across Earth and\ninto space. When the last swan had left the Moon became just another\npiece of colored rock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAl Marcusson opened his eyes and made his way dully back into the\ndust cloud now shot with flashes of red-orange as Earth's laser beams\nsearched for the capsule's nerve centers. He bumped against a strut and\nforced his way in.\n\nA hum filled the capsule. Ungainly jointed limbs, paddles, calyxes,\nsprouted from its outside walls. On Earth pens jiggled, tapes were\npunched, rows of figures in five columns appeared on blank pages,\npulses jumped and two groggy, worn-out faces appeared on the control\nroom screens. Hatter's eyes flickered over the boards and he opened his\nmouth. Some time later his disembodied voice came out of the monitor,\nreading dials, reporting on systems. Then the screens showed Al\nMarcusson's eyes opening in turn. Control could see him leaning forward\ntowards the port, his face drawn in haggard lines and shadows, then\nletting his head fall back. \"Hey,\" he said, \"didn't Doc tell you guys\ndust gives me hay fever?\"\n\nOn Earth the men about the screens slapped each other's backs and\ngrinned and wiped their eyes. Good old bellyaching Marcusson! Good old\nAl! The Moon was just another piece of rock, after all.\n\nBut a star went nova in Cygnus, and lovers wished on it that night.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of My Lady Selene, by Magnus Ludens\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY LADY SELENE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50892.txt or 50892.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/8/9/50892/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
