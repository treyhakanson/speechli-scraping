Willard_\n\n[Illustration: \"_Help--help--the eyes--the eyes!_\"]\n\n[Sidenote: Robert Thorpe seeks out the nameless horror that is sucking\nall human life out of ships in the South Pacific.]\n\n\nRobert Thorpe reached languidly for a cigarette and, with lazy\nfingers, extracted a lighter from his pocket.\n\n\"Be a sport,\" he repeated to the gray haired man across the table. \"Be\na sport, Admiral, and send me across on a destroyer. Never been on a\ndestroyer except in port. It ... would be a new experience ... enjoy\nit a lot....\"\n\nIn the palm-shaded veranda of this club-house in Manila, Admiral\nStruthers, U. S. N., regarded with undisguised disfavor the young man\nin the wicker chair. He looked at the deep chest and the broad\nshoulders which even a loose white coat could not conceal, at the\nshort, wavy brown hair and the slow, friendly smile on the face below.\n\nA likable chap, this Thorpe, but lazy--just an idler--he had\nconcluded. Been playing around Manila for the last two months--resting\nup, he had said. And from what? the Admiral had questioned\ndisdainfully. Admiral Struthers did not like indolent young men, but\nit would have saved him money if he had really got an answer to his\nquestion and had learned just why and how Robert Thorpe had earned a\nvacation.\n\n\"You on a destroyer!\" he said, and the lips beneath the close-cut gray\nmustache twisted into a smile. \"That would be too rough an experience\nfor you, I am afraid, Thorpe. Destroyers pitch about quite a bit, you\nknow.\"\n\nHe included in his smile the destroyer captain and the young lady who\ncompleted their party. The young lady had a charming and saucy smile\nand knew it; she used it in reply to the Admiral's remark.\n\n\"I have asked Mr. Thorpe to go on the _Adelaide_,\" she said. \"We shall\nbe leaving in another month--but Robert tells me he has other plans.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse,\" was the Admiral's comment. \"Your father's yacht is\nnot even as steady as a destroyer. Now I would suggest a nice\ncomfortable liner....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRobert Thorpe did not miss the official glances of amusement, but his\ncalm complacence was unruffled. \"No,\" he said, \"I don't just fancy\nliners. Fact is, I have been thinking of sailing across to the States\nalone.\"\n\nThe Admiral's smile increased to a short laugh. \"I would make a bet\nyou wouldn't get fifty miles from Manila harbor.\"\n\nThe younger man crushed his cigarette slowly into the tray. \"How much\nof a bet?\" he asked. \"What will you bet that I don't sail alone from\nhere to--where are you stationed?--San Diego?--from here to San\nDiego?\"\n\n\"Humph!\" was the snorted reply. \"I would bet a thousand dollars on\nthat and take your money for Miss Allaire's pet charity.\"\n\n\"Now that's an idea,\" said Thorpe. He reached for a check book in his\ninner pocket and began to write.\n\n\"In case I lose,\" he explained, \"I might be hard to find, so I will\njust ask Miss Allaire to hold this check for me. You can do the same.\"\nHe handed the check to the girl.\n\n\"Winner gets his thousand back, Ruth; loser's money goes to any little\norphans you happen to fancy.\"\n\n\"You're not serious,\" protested the Admiral.\n\n\"Sure! The bank will take that check seriously, I promise you. And I\nsaw just the sloop I want for the trip ... had my eye on her for the\npast month.\"\n\n\"But, Robert,\" began Ruth Allaire, \"you don't mean to risk your life\non a foolish bet?\"\n\nThorpe reached over to pat tenderly the hand that held his check. \"I'm\nglad if you care,\" he said, and there was an undertone of seriousness\nbeneath his raillery, \"but save your sympathy for the Admiral. The U.\nS. Navy can't bluff me.\" He rose more briskly from his chair.\n\n\"Thorpe....\" said Admiral Struthers. He was thinking deeply, trying to\nrecollect. \"Robert Thorpe.... I have a book by someone of that\nname--travel and adventure and knocking about the world. Young man,\nare you _the_ Robert Thorpe?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, if you wish to put it that way,\" agreed the other. He waved\nlightly to the girl as he moved away.\n\n\"I must be running along,\" he said, \"and get that boat. See you all in\nSan Diego!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first rays of the sun touched with golden fingers the tops of the\nlazy swells of the Pacific. Here and there a wave broke to spray under\nthe steady wind and became a shower of molten metal. And in the boat,\nwhose sails caught now and then the touch of morning, Robert Thorpe\nstirred himself and rose sleepily to his feet.\n\nOut of the snug cabin at this first hint of day, he looked first at\nthe compass and checked his course, then made sure of the lashing\nabout the helm. The steady trade-winds had borne him on through the\nnight, and he nodded with satisfaction as he prepared to lower his\nlights. He was reaching for a line as the little craft hung for an\ninstant on the top of a wave. And in that instant his eyes caught a\nmarking of white on the dim waters ahead.\n\n\"Breakers!\" he shouted aloud and leaped for the lashed wheel. He\nswung off to leeward and eased a bit on the main-sheet, then lashed\nthe wheel again to hold on the new course.\n\nAgain from a wave-crest he stared from under a sheltering hand. The\nbreakers were there--the smooth swells were foaming--breaking in\nmid-ocean where his chart, he knew, showed water a mile deep. Beyond\nthe white line was a three-master, her sails shivering in the breeze.\n\nThe big sailing ship swung off on a new tack as he watched. Was she\ndodging those breakers? he wondered. Then he stared in amazement\nthrough the growing light at the unbroken swells where the white line\nhad been.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe rubbed his sleepy eyes with a savage hand and stared again. There\nwere no breakers--the sea was an even expanse of heaving water.\n\n\"I could swear I saw them!\" he told himself, but forgot this\nperplexing occurrence in the still more perplexing maneuvers of the\nsailing ship.\n\nThis steady wind--for smooth handling--was all that such a craft could\nask, yet here was this old-timer of the sea with a full spread of\ncanvas booming and cracking as the ship jibed. She rolled far over as\nhe watched, recovered, and tore off on a long, sweeping circle.\n\nThe one man crew of the little sloop should have been preparing\nbreakfast, as he had for many mornings past, but, instead he swung his\nlittle craft into the wind and watched for near an hour the erratic\nrushes and shivering haltings of the larger ship. But long before this\ntime had passed Thorpe knew he was observing the aimless maneuvers of\nan unmanned vessel.\n\nAnd he watched his chance for a closer inspection.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe three-master _Minnie R._, from the dingy painting of the stern,\nhung quivering in the wind when he boarded her. There was a broken\nlog-line that swept down from the stern, and he caught this and made\nhis own boat fast. Then, watching his chance, he drew close and went\noverboard, the line in his hand.\n\n\"Like a blooming native after cocoanuts,\" he told himself as he went\nup the side. But he made it and pulled himself over the rail as the\nship drew off on another tack.\n\nThorpe looked quickly about the deserted deck. \"Ahoy, there!\" he\nshouted, but the straining of rope and spars was his only answer.\nCanvas was whipping to ribbons, sheets cracked their frayed ends like\nlashes as the booms swung wildly, but a few sails still held and\ncaught the air.\n\nHe was on the after deck, and he leaped first for the wheel that was\nkicking and whirling with the swing of the rudder. A glance at the\ncanvas that still drew, and he set her on a course with a few\nsteadying pulls. There was rope lying about, and he lashed the wheel\nwith a quick turn or two and watched the ship steady down to a smooth\nslicing of the waves from the west.\n\nAnd only then did the man take time to quiet his panting breath and\nlook about him in the unnatural quiet of this strangely deserted deck.\nHe shouted again and walked to a companionway to repeat the hail. Only\nan echo, sounding hollowly from below, replied to break the vast\nsilence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was puzzling--inconceivable. Thorpe looked about him to note the\nlifeboats snug and undisturbed in their places. No sign there of an\nabandonment of the boat, but abandoned she was, as the silence told\nonly too plainly. And Thorpe, as he went below, had an uncanny feeling\nof the crew's presence--as if they had been there, walked where he\nwalked, shouted and laughed a matter of a brief hour or two before.\n\nThe door of the captain's cabin was burst in, hanging drunkenly from\none hinge. The log-book was open; there were papers on a rude desk.\nThe bunk was empty where the blankets had been thrown hurriedly\naside. Thorpe could almost see the skipper of this mystery ship\nleaping frantically from his bed at some sudden call or commotion. A\nchair was smashed and broken, and the man who examined it curiously\nwiped from his hands a disgusting slime that was smeared stickily on\nthe splintered fragments. There was a fetid stench within his\nnostrils, and he passed up further examination of this room.\n\nForward in the fo'c'sle he felt again irresistibly the recent presence\nof the crew. And again he found silence and emptiness and a disorder\nthat told of a fear-stricken flight. The odor that sickened and\nnauseated the exploring man was everywhere. He was glad to gain the\nfreedom of the wind-swept deck and rid his lungs of the vile breath\nwithin the vessel.\n\nHe stood silent and bewildered. There was not a living soul aboard the\nship--no sign of life. He started suddenly. A moaning, whimpering cry\ncame from forward on the deck!\n\nThorpe leaped across a disorder of tangled rope to race toward the\nbow. He stopped short at sight of a battered cage. Again the moaning\ncame to him--there was something that still lived on board the\nill-fated ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe drew closer to see a great, huddled, furry mass that crouched and\ncowered in a corner of the cage. A huge ape, Thorpe concluded, and it\nmoaned and whimpered absurdly like a human in abject fear.\n\nHad this been the terror that drove the men into the sea? Had this ape\nescaped and menaced the officers and crew? Thorpe dismissed the\nthought he well knew was absurd. The stout wood bars of the cage were\nbroken. It had been partially crushed, and the chain that held it to\nthe deck was extended to its full length.\n\n\"Too much for me,\" the man said slowly, aloud; \"entirely too much for\nme! But I can't sail this old hooker alone; I'll have to get out and\nlet her drift.\"\n\nHe removed completely one of the splintered bars from the broken cage.\n\"I've got to leave you, old fellow,\" he told the cowering animal, \"but\nI'll give you the run of the ship.\"\n\nHe went below once more and came quickly back with the log-book and\npapers from the captain's room. He tied these in a tight wrapping of\noilcloth from the galley and hung them at his belt. He took the wheel\nagain and brought the cumbersome craft slowly into the wind. The bare\nmast of his own sloop was bobbing alongside as he went down the line\nand swam over to her.\n\nFending off from the wallowing hulk, he cut the line, and his small\ncraft slipped slowly astern as the big vessel fell off in the wind and\ndrew lumberingly away on its unguided course.\n\nShe vanished into the clear-cut horizon before the watching man ceased\nhis staring and pricked a point upon his chart that he estimated was\nhis position.\n\nAnd he watched vainly for some sign of life on the heaving waters as\nhe set his sloop back on her easterly course.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a sun-tanned young man who walked with brisk strides into the\noffice of Admiral Struthers. The gold-striped arm of the uniformed man\nwas extended in quick greeting.\n\n\"Made it, did you?\" he exclaimed. \"Congratulations!\"\n\n\"All O.K.,\" Thorpe agreed. \"Ship and log are ready for your\nverification.\"\n\n\"Talk sense,\" said the officer. \"Have any trouble or excitement? Or\nperhaps you are more interested in collecting a certain bet than you\nare in discussing the trip.\"\n\n\"Damn the bet!\" said the young man fervently. \"And that's just what I\nam here for--to talk about the trip. There were some little incidents\nthat may interest you.\"\n\nHe painted for the Admiral in brief, terse sentences the picture of\nthat daybreak on the Pacific, the line of breakers, white in the\nvanishing night, the abandoned ship beyond, cracking her canvas to\ntatters in the freshening breeze. And he told of his boarding her and\nof what he had found.\n\n\"Where was this?\" asked the officer, and Thorpe gave his position as\nhe had checked it.\n\n\"I reported the derelict to a passing steamer that same day,\" he\nadded, but the Admiral was calling for a chart. He spread it on the\ndesk before him and placed the tip of a pencil in the center of an\nunbroken expanse.\n\n\"Breakers, you said?\" he questioned. \"Why, there are hundreds of\nfathoms here, Mr. Thorpe.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I know it,\" Thorpe agreed, \"but I saw them--a stretch of white water\nfor an eighth of a mile. I know it's impossible, but true. But forget\nthat item for a time, Admiral. Look at this.\" He opened a brief case\nand took out a log-book and some other papers.\n\n\"The log of the _Minnie R._,\" he explained briefly. \"Nothing in it but\nroutine entries up to that morning and then nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Abandoned,\" mused the Admiral, \"and they did not take to the boats.\nThere have been other instances--never explained.\"\n\n\"See if this helps any,\" suggested Thorpe and handed the other two\nsheets of paper. \"They were in the captain's cabin,\" he added.\n\nAdmiral Struthers glanced at them, then settled back in his chair.\n\n\"Dated September fourth,\" he said. \"That would have been the day\nprevious to the time you found her.\" The writing was plain, in a\ncareful, well-formed hand. He cleared his throat and read aloud:\n\n\"Written by Jeremiah Wilkens of Salem, Mass., master of the _Minnie\nR._, bound from Shanghai to San Pedro. I have sailed the seas for\nforty years, and for the first time I am afraid. I hope I may destroy\nthis paper when the lights of San Pedro are safe in sight, but I am\nwriting here what it would shame me to set down in the ship's log,\nthough I know there are stranger happenings on the face of the waters\nthan man has ever seen--or has lived to tell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"All this day I have been filled with fear. I have been watched--I\nhave felt it as surely as if a devil out of hell stood beside me with\nhis eyes fastened on mine. The men have felt it, too. They have been\nfrightened at nothing and have tried to conceal it as I have\ndone.--And the animals....\n\n\"A shark has followed us for days--it is gone to-day. The cats--we\nhave three on board--have howled horribly and have hidden themselves\nin the cargo down below. The mate is bringing a big monkey to be sold\nin Los Angeles. An orang-outang, he calls it. It has been an ugly\nbrute, shaking at the bars of its cage and showing its ugly teeth ever\nsince we left port. But to-day it is crouched in a corner of its cage\nand will not stir even for food. The poor beast is in mortal terror.\n\n\"All this is more like the wandering talk of an old woman muttering in\na corner by the fireside of witches and the like than it is like a\ntruthful account set down by Jeremiah Wilkins. And now that I have\nwritten it I see there is nothing to tell. Nothing but the shameful\naccount of my fear of some horror beyond my knowing. And now that it\nis written I am tempted to destroy--No, I will wait--\"\n\n\"And now what is this?\" Admiral Struthers interrupted his reading to\nask. He turned the paper to read a coarse, slanting scrawl at the\nbottom of the page.\n\n\"The eyes--the eyes--they are everywhere above us--God help--\" The\nwriting trailed off in a straggling line.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lips beneath the trim gray mustache drew themselves into a hard\nline. It was a moment before Admiral Struthers raised his eyes to\nmeet those of Robert Thorpe.\n\n\"You found this in the captain's cabin?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the captain was--\"\n\n\"Gone.\"\n\n\"Blood stains?\"\n\n\"No, but the door had been burst off its hinges. There had been a\nstruggle without a doubt.\"\n\nThe officer mused for a minute or two.\n\n\"Did they go aboard another vessel?\" he pondered. \"Abandon ship--open\nthe sea-cocks--sink it for the insurance?\" He was trying vainly to\nfind some answer to the problem, some explanation that would not\nimpose too great a strain upon his own reason.\n\n\"I have reported to the owners,\" said Thorpe. \"The _Minnie R._ was not\nheavily insured.\"\n\nThe Admiral ruffled some papers on his desk to find a report.\n\n\"There has been another,\" he told Thorpe. \"A tramp freighter is listed\nas missing. She was last reported due east of the position you give.\nShe was coming this way--must have come through about the same\nwater--\" He caught himself up abruptly. Thorpe sensed that an Admiral\nof the Navy must not lend too credulous an ear to impossible stories.\n\n\"You've had an interesting experience, Mr. Thorpe,\" he said. \"Most\ninteresting. Probably a derelict is the answer, some hull just afloat.\nWe will send out a general warning.\"\n\nHe handed the loose papers and the log book to the younger man. \"This\nstuff is rubbish,\" he stated with emphasis. \"Captain Wilkins held his\ncommand a year or so too long.\"\n\n\"You will do nothing about it?\" Thorpe asked in astonishment.\n\n\"I said I would warn all shipping; there is nothing more to be done.\"\n\n\"I think there is.\" Thorpe's gray eye were steady as he regarded the\nman at the desk. \"I intend to run it down. There have been other such\ninstances, as you said--never explained. I mean to find the answer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdmiral Struthers smiled indulgently. \"Always after excitement,\" he\nsaid. \"You'll be writing another book, I expect. I shall look forward\nto reading it ... but just what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I am going to the Islands,\" said Thorpe quietly. \"I am going to\ncharter a small ship of some sort, and I am going out there and camp\non that spot in the hope of seeing those eyes and what is behind them.\nI am leaving to-night.\"\n\nAdmiral Struthers leaned back to indulge in a hearty laugh. \"I refused\nyou a passage on a destroyer once,\" he said, \"and it was an expensive\nmistake. I don't make the same mistake twice. Now I am going to offer\nyou a trip....\n\n\"The _Bennington_ is leaving to-day on a cruise to Manila. I'll hold\nher an extra hour or two if you would like to go. She can drop you at\nHonolulu or wherever you say. Lieutenant Commander Brent is in\ncommand--you remember him in Manila, of course.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Thorpe responded. \"I'll be there.\"\n\n\"And,\" he added, as he took the Admiral's hand, \"if I didn't object to\nbetting on a sure thing I would make you a little proposition. I would\nbet any money that you would give your shirt to go along.\"\n\n\"I never bet, either,\" said Admiral Struthers, \"on a sure loss. Now\nget out of here, you young trouble-shooter, and let the Navy get to\nwork.\" His eyes were twinkling as he waved the young man out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorpe found himself comfortably fixed on the _Bennington_. Brent, her\ncommander, was a fine example of the aggressive young chaps that the\ndestroyer fleet breeds. And he liked to play cribbage, Thorpe found.\nThey were pegging away industriously the sixth night out when the\nfirst S.O.S. reached them. A message was placed before the commander.\nHe read it and tossed it to Thorpe as he rose from his chair.\n\n\"S.O.S.,\" said the radio sheet, \"_Nagasaki Maru_, twenty-four\nthirty-five N., one five eight West. Struck something unknown. Down at\nthe bow. May need help. Please stand by.\"\n\nCaptain Brent had left the room. A moment later, and the quiver and\ntremble of the _Bennington_ told Thorpe they were running full speed\nfor the position of the stricken ship.\n\nBut: \"Twenty-four thirty-five North,\" he mused, \"and less than two\ndegrees west of where the poor old _Minnie R._ got hers. I wonder ...\nI wonder....\"\n\n\"We will be there in four hours,\" said Captain Brent on his return.\n\"Hope she lasts. But what have they struck out there? Derelict\nprobably, though she should have had Admiral Struthers' warning.\"\n\nRobert Thorpe made no reply other than: \"Wait here a minute, Brent. I\nhave something to show you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had not told the officer of his mission nor of his experience, but\nhe did so now. And he placed before him the wildly improbable\nstatement of the late Captain Wilkins.\n\n\"Something is there,\" surmised Captain Brent, \"just awash,\nprobably--no superstructure visible. Your _Minnie R._ hit the same\nthing.\"\n\n\"Something is there,\" Thorpe agreed. \"I wish I knew what.\"\n\n\"This stuff has got to you, has it?\" asked Brent as he returned the\npapers of Captain Wilkins. He was quite evidently amused at the\nthought.\n\n\"You weren't on the ship,\" said Thorpe, simply. \"There was nothing to\nsee--nothing to tell. But I know....\"\n\nHe followed Brent to the wireless room.\n\n\"Can you get the _Nagasaki_?\" Brent asked.\n\n\"They know we are coming, sir,\" said the operator. \"We seem to be the\nonly one anywhere near.\"\n\nHe handed the captain another message. \"Something odd about that,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"_U. S. S. Bennington_,\" the captain read aloud. \"We are still afloat.\nOn even keel now, but low in water. No water coming in. Engines full\nspeed ahead, but we make no headway. Apparently aground. _Nagasaki\nMaru._\"\n\n\"Why, that's impossible,\" Brent exclaimed impatiently. \"What kind of\nfoolishness--\" He left the question uncompleted. The radio man was\nwriting rapidly. Some message was coming at top speed. Both Brent and\nThorpe leaned over the man's shoulder to read as he wrote.\n\n\"_Bennington_ help,\" the pencil was writing, \"sinking fast--decks\nalmost awash--we are being--\"\n\nIn breathless silence they watched the pencil, poised above the paper\nwhile the operator listened tensely to the silent night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain his ear received the wild jumble of dots and dashes sent by a\nfrenzied hand in that far-off room. His pencil automatically set down\nthe words. \"Help--help--\" it wrote before Thorpe's spellbound gaze,\n\"the eyes--the eyes--it is attack--\"\n\nAnd again the black night held only the rush and roar of torn waters\nwhere the destroyer raced quivering through the darkness. The message,\nas the waiting men well knew, would never be completed.\n\n\"A derelict!\" Robert Thorpe exclaimed with unconscious scorn. But\nCaptain Brent was already at a communication tube.\n\n\"Chief? Captain Brent. Give her everything you've got. Drive the\n_Bennington_ faster than she ever went before.\"\n\nThe slim ship was a quivering lance of steel that threw itself through\nfoaming waters, that shot with an endless, roaring surge of speed\ntoward that distant point in the heaving waste of the Pacific, and\nthat seemed, to the two silent men on the bridge, to put the dragging\nmiles behind them so slowly--so slowly.\n\n\"Let me see those papers,\" said Captain Brent, finally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe read them in silence.\n\nThen: \"The eyes!\" he said. \"The eyes! That is what this other poor\ndevil said. My God, Thorpe, what is it? What can it be? We're not all\ninsane.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I expected to find,\" said Thorpe slowly. \"I had\nthought of many things, each wilder than the next. This Captain\nWilkins said the eyes were above him. I had visions of some sky\nmonster ... I had even thought of some strange aircraft from out in\nspace, perhaps, with round lights like eyes. I have pictured\nimpossibilities! But now--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the other questioned, \"now?\"\n\n\"There were tales in olden times of the Kraken,\" suggested Thorpe.\n\n\"The Kraken!\" the captain scoffed. \"A mythical monster of the sea.\nWhy, that was just a fable.\"\n\n\"True,\" was the quiet reply, \"that was just a fable. And one of the\nthings I have learned is how frequently there is a basis of fact\nunderlying a fable. And, for that matter, how can we know there is no\nsuch monster, some relic of a Mesozoic species supposed to be\nextinct?\"\n\nHe stood motionless, staring far out ahead into the dark. And Brent,\ntoo, was silent. They seemed to try with unaided eyes to penetrate the\ndark miles ahead and see what their sane minds refused to accept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was still dark when the search-light's sweeping beam picked up the\nblack hull and broad, red-striped funnels of the _Nagasaki Maru_. She\nwas riding high in the water, and her big bulk rolled and wallowed in\nthe trough of the great swells.\n\nThe _Bennington_ swept in a swift circle about the helpless hulk while\nthe lights played incessantly upon her decks. And the watching eyes\nstrained vainly for some signal to betoken life, for some sign that\ntheir mad race had not been quite vain. Her engines had been shut\ndown; there was no steerage-way for the _Nagasaki Maru_, and, from all\nthey could see, there were no human hands to drag at the levers of her\nwaiting engines nor to twirl with sure touch the deserted helm. The\n_Nagasaki Maru_ was abandoned.\n\nThe lights held steadily upon her as the _Bennington_ came alongside\nand a boat was swung out smartly in its davits. But Thorpe knew he was\nnot alone in his wild surmise as to the cause of the catastrophe.\n\n\"Throw your lights around the water occasionally,\" Brent ordered. \"Let\nme know if you see anything.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" said the man at the search-light. \"I will report if I spot\nany survivors or boats.\"\n\n\"Report anything you see,\" said Commander Brent curtly.\n\n\"You go aboard if you want to,\" he suggested to Thorpe. \"I will stay\nhere and be ready if you need help.\"\n\nThorpe nodded with approval as the small boat pulled away in the dark,\nfor there was activity apparent on the destroyer not warranted by a\nmere rescue at sea. Gun-crews rushed to their stations; the tarpaulin\ncovers were off of the guns, and their slender lengths gleamed where\nthey covered the course of the boat.\n\n\"Brent is ready,\" Thorpe admitted, \"for anything.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found the iron ladder against the ship's side, and a sailor\nsprang for it and made his way aboard. Thorpe was not the last to set\nfoot on deck, and he shuddered involuntarily at the eery silence he\nknew awaited them.\n\nIt was the _Minnie R._ over again, as he expected, but with a\ndifference. The sailing vessel, before he boarded it, had been for\nsome time exposed to the sun, while the _Nagasaki Maru_ had not. And\nhere there were slimy trails still wet on the decks.\n\nHe went first to the wireless room. He must know the final answer to\nthat interrupted message, and he found it in emptiness. No radio man\nwas waiting him there, nor even a body to show the loser of an unequal\nbattle. But there was blood on the door-jamb where a body--the man's\nbody, Thorpe was sure--had been smashed against the wood. A wisp of\nblack hair in the blood gave its mute evidence of the hopeless fight.\nAnd the slime, like the trails on the deck, smeared with odorous\nvileness the whole room.\n\nThorpe went again to the deck, and, as on the other ship, he breathed\ndeeply to rid his lungs and nostrils of the abhorrent stench. The\nensign in charge of the boarding party approached.\n\n\"What kind of a rotten mess is this?\" he demanded. \"The ship is filthy\nand not a soul on board. Not a man of them, officers or crew, and the\nboats are all here. It's absolutely amazing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Thorpe told him, \"about what we expected. What do you make of\nthis?\" He touched with his foot a broad trail that shone wet in the\n_Bennington's_ lights.\n\n\"The Lord knows,\" said the ensign in wonder. \"It's all over and it\nsmells like a rotten dead fish. Well, we will be going back, sir.\" He\ncalled to a petty officer to round up the men, and the boat was\nbrought alongside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir return to the _Bennington_ again through a pathway of light that\nThorpe knew was safe under the black muzzles of the destroyer's guns.\n\nOr was it, he asked himself. Safe! Was anything safe from this\ndevilish mystery that could pluck each cowering human from the lowest\ndepths of this steel freighter, that could drag her down in the water\ntill the radio man sent his cry: \"We are sinking!...\"\n\nHe told Brent quietly, after the ensign had reported, of the struggles\nin the wireless room and its few remaining traces. And he watched with\nthe commander through the hour of darkness while the _Bennington_\nsteamed in slow circles about the abandoned hulk, while her\nsearch-lights played endlessly over the empty waters and the men at\nthe guns cast wondering glances at their skipper who ordered such\nstrange procedure when no danger was there.\n\nWith daylight the scene lost its sense of mysterious threat, and\nThorpe was eager to return to the abandoned ship.\n\n\"I might find something,\" he said, \"some trace or indication of what\nwe have to fight.\"\n\n\"I must leave,\" said Commander Brent. \"Oh, I'm coming back, never\nfear,\" he added, at the look of dismay on Thorpe's face. The thought\nof leaving this mystery unsolved was more than that young seeker after\nadventure could accept.\n\n\"I'm coming back,\" Brent repeated. \"I've been in communication with\nthe Admiral--Honolulu has relayed the messages through. All code, of\ncourse; we mustn't alarm the whole Pacific with our nightmares. The\nold man says to stick around and get the low-down on this damn thing.\"\n\n\"Then why leave?\" objected Thorpe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Because I am coming around to your way of thinking, Thorpe. Because I\nam as certain as can be that we have a monster of some sort to deal\nwith ... and because I haven't any depth charges. I want to run up to\nthe supply station at Honolulu and get a couple of ash-cans of TNT to\nlay on top of the brute if we sight him.\"\n\n\"Glory be!\" said Thorpe fervently. \"That sounds like business. Go and\nget your eggs and perhaps we can feed them to this devil--raw.... And\nI think I'll stay here, if you will be back by dark.\"\n\n\"Better not,\" the other objected; but Thorpe overruled him.\n\n\"This thing attacks in the dark,\" he said. \"I will lay a little bet on\nthat. It left the orang-outang on the _Minnie R._--quit at the first\nsign of daylight. I will be safe through the day, and besides, the\nbeast has gutted this ship. It won't return, I imagine. And if I stay\nthere for the day--live as they lived, the men who manned that ship--I\nmay have some information that will be of help when you get back. But\nfor Heaven's sake, Brent, don't stop to pick any flowers on the way.\"\n\n\"It's your funeral,\" said Brent not too cheerfully. \"The old man said\nto give you every assistance, and perhaps that includes helping you\ncommit suicide.\"\n\nBut Robert Thorpe only laughed as Commander Brent gave his orders for\na small boat to be lowered. A ship's lantern and rockets for night\nsignals were taken at the officer's orders. \"We'll be back before\ndark,\" he said, \"but take these as a precaution.\"\n\nOne favor Thorpe asked--that the ship's carpenter go over with him and\nhelp him to make a strong-barred retreat of the wireless cabin.\n\n\"And I'll talk to you occasionally,\" he told Brent. \"I tried the key\nwhile I was aboard; the wireless is working on its batteries.\"\n\nHe waved a cheery good-by as the small boat pulled away. \"And hurry\nback,\" he called. The destroyer commander nodded an emphatic assent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn board the _Nagasaki Maru_, Thorpe directed the carpenter and his\nhelpers in the work he wanted done. The man seemed to know\ninstinctively where to put his hands on needed supplies, and the\nresult was a virtual cage of strong oak bars enclosing the wireless\nroom, and braces of oak to bar the single door. Thorpe was not\nassuming any bravado in his feeling of safety, but he was doing what\nhe had done in many other tight corners, and he prepared his defences\nin advance.\n\nThese included weapons of offense as well. As the boat with the\ndestroyer's men pulled back to the _Bennington_, he placed in easy\nreach in a corner of the room a heavy calibered rifle he had taken\nfrom his belongings.\n\nAnd, still, with all his feeling of security, there was a strange\ndepression fell upon him when the _Bennington's_ narrow hull was small\nupon the horizon, and then that, too, was gone and only the heaving\nswells and the wallowing hulk were his companions.\n\nOnly these? He shivered slightly as he thought of that unseen watcher\nwith the devil-eyes whose presence Captain Wilkins had felt--and his\nmen, and the poor terrified ape! He deliberately put from his mind the\nthought of this; no use to start the day with morbid fears. He went\nbelow to examine the cabins. But he carried the heavy elephant gun\nwith him wherever he went.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBelow decks the signs of the marauder were everywhere, yet there was\nlittle to be learned. The slimy trails dried quickly and vanished, but\nnot before Thorpe had traced them to the uttermost depths of the ship.\n\nThere was not a nook or corner that had gone unsearched in the\nhorrible quest for human food. And one thing impressed itself forcibly\nupon the man's mind. He found a lantern, and he used it of necessity\nin his explorations, but this thing had gone through the dark and with\nunerring certainty had found its way to every victim.\n\n\"Can it see in the dark?\" Thorpe questioned. \"Or....\" He visioned\ndimly some denizen of the vast depths, living beyond the limits of the\nsun's penetration, far in the abysmal darkness where its only light\nmust be self-made. But his mind failed in the attempt to picture what\nmanner of horror this thing might be.\n\nEven in the hold its evil traces were found. There were tiers of metal\ndrums that still shone wet in his lantern's light. Calcium\ncarbide--for making acetylene, he supposed--marked \"Made in U.S.A.\"\nThe _Nagasaki_ must have been westward bound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went, after an hour or so, to the wireless room, and only when he\nrelaxed in the safety of his improvised fortress did he realize how\ntense had been every nerve and muscle through his long search. He\ntried the wireless and got an instant response from the destroyer.\n\n\"Don't shoot it too fast,\" he spelled out slowly to the distant\noperator: \"I am only a dub. Just wanted to say hello and report all\nO.K.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" was the steady, careful response. \"We have had a little\ntrouble with our condensers--\" There was a short pause, then the\nmessage continued, this portion dictated by the commander. \"Delay not\nimportant. We will be back as agreed. Have picked up _S. S. Adelaide_\nbound east in your latitude. Warned her to take northerly course\naccount derelict. See you later. Signed, Brent, commanding _U. S. S.\nBennington_.\"\n\nThe man in the barred room tapped off his acknowledgement and closed\nthe key. He suddenly realized he had had no breakfast, and the hours\nhad been slipping past. He took his gun again and went down to the\ngalley to prepare some coffee. It was not the time or place for an\nenjoyable meal, but he would have relished it more had he not pictured\nthe _Adelaide_ and her lovely owner steaming across these threatening\nseas.\n\nHe knew the captain of the _Adelaide_. \"Obstinate pigheaded old\nScotchman!\" \"Hope he takes Brent's advice. Of course Brent couldn't\ntell him the truth. We can't blat this wild yarn all over the air or\nthe passenger lines would have our scalps. But I wish the _Adelaide_\nwas safe in Manila.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis explorations in the afternoon were half-hearted and perfunctory.\nThere was nothing more to be learned. But he had seen in his mind some\nvague outline of what they must meet. He saw a something, mammoth,\nhuge, that could grasp and hold an ocean freighter--against whose\ngreat body he had seen the waves dash in a line of white spray. Yet a\nsomething that could force its way down narrow passages, could press\nwith terrific strength on bolted doors and crush them inward, wrecked\nand splintered. Some serpentine thing that felt and saw its way and\ncrawled so surely through the dark--found its prey--seized it--and\ncarried off a man as easily as it might a mouse.\n\nNo octopus, no matter what proportions, filled the description. He\ngave up trying to see too clearly the awful thing. And he kept away\nfrom the ship's rail when once he had ventured near. For there had\ncome to him a feeling of fear that had sent the waves of cold\ntrickling and prickling up his spine. Was there something really\nthere?... A waiting lurking horror in the depths?\n\n\"The eyes,\" he thought, \"the eyes!...\" And he went more quickly than\nhe knew to his barred retreat where again he might breathe quietly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe position of the deserted ship was south of the regular steamer\nlanes on the TransPacific run. Only a trace of smoke on the northern\nhorizon marked through the afternoon the passage of other craft. It\nwas a long and lonely vigil for the waiting man. But the _Bennington_\nwould return, and he listened in at intervals hoping to hear her\nfriendly signal.\n\nThe batteries operating the _Nagasaki's_ wireless were none too\nstrong; Thorpe saved their strength, though he tried at times to raise\nthe _Bennington_ somewhere beyond his reach.\n\nThe sun was touching the horizon when he got his first response. \"Keep\nup the old nerve,\" admonished the slow, careful sending of the\n_Bennington's_ operator. \"We have been delayed but we are on our way.\nSigned, Brent.\"\n\nThe man in the wireless room placed the oak bars across the door, and\ntried to believe he was nonchalant and unafraid as he laid out extra\nclips of cartridges. But his eyes persisted in following the sinking\nsun, and he watched from within his cage the coming of the quick dark.\n\nThe protecting glare of day must be unbearable to this monster from\nthe lightless depths, and daylight was vanishing. Thorpe's mind was\nsearching for additional means of defense. He found it in the cargo he\nhad seen. The drums of carbide! He could scatter it on the deck--it\nreacted with water, and those slimy arms, if they came and touched it,\ncould find the contact hot. He took his lantern and went hastily below\nto stagger back with a drum upon his shoulder.\n\nIn the half-light that was left him he forced the cover and then\nrolled the drum about the swaying deck. The gray, earthly lumps of\ncarbide formed erratic lines. Useless perhaps, he admitted, but the\nthreatening dark forced the man to use every means at his command.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was scattering the contents of a second drum when he stiffened\nabruptly to rigid attention.\n\nThe ship, thrown broadside to the wide-spaced swells, had rolled\nendlessly with a monotonous motion. But now the deck beneath him was\nsteadying. It assumed an abnormal levelness. The boat rose and fell\nwith the waves, but it no longer rolled. There was something beneath\nholding, drawing on it.\n\nThorpe knew in that frozen second what it meant. The drum clattered to\nthe rail as he dashed for his room. Gun in hand, he watched with\nstaring eyes where the deserted deck showed dim and vague in the light\nof the stars and the bow of the ship was lost in the uncertain dark of\nnight.\n\nWide-eyed he watched into the blackness, and he listened with\ndesperate attention for some slightest sound beyond the splashing of\nwaves and the creaking of spars.\n\nFar in the west a light appeared, to glow and vanish and glow again in\nthe tumbling waters. The _Bennington_! His heart leaped at the\nthought, then sank as he knew the destroyer's lights would not appear\nfrom that direction.\n\nThrough a slow hour that seemed an eternity the oncoming ship drew\nnear, and he knew with a sudden, startling certainty that it was the\n_Adelaide_--and Ruth Allaire--coming on, through into the horror\nawaiting.\n\nHe leaned forward tensely as a sound reached his ears. A ghostly echo\nof a sound, like the softest of smooth, slipping fabric upon hard\nsteel. And as he listened, before his staring eyes, a something came\nbetween him and the lighted yacht.\n\nIt wavered and swung in the darkness. It was formless, uncertain of\noutline, and it swung in the night out beyond the ship's rail till it\nsuddenly neared, waved high overhead, and the cold light of the stars\nshone in pale reflection from an enormous, staring eye.\n\nIt surmounted a serpentine form that took shape in the dim radiance\nwithout and came lower in undulating folds to crash heavily upon the\ndeck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorpe's hand was upon the wireless key. He had wanted to warn off the\nyacht, but not till the thud of the creature on the bare deck proved\nits reality could he force his cold fingers to press the key.\n\nThen, fast as his inexperience allowed, he called frantically for the\n_Adelaide_. He spelled her name, over and over.... Would the sleepy\noperator never answer?\n\nThe _Bennington_ broke in one. \"Is that you, Thorpe? What is up?\" they\ndemanded.\n\nBut Thorpe kept up his slow spelling of the yacht's name. He must get\na warning to them! Then he realized that the _Bennington_ could do it\nbetter.\n\n\"_Bennington_,\" he called, \"_Adelaide_ approaching. I am attacked.\nWarn them off. Warn them--\" His frantic, hissing dots and dashes died\nimmediately. Beneath his feet the _Nagasaki Maru_ was rolling again,\nswinging free to the lift and thrust of the swells beneath.\n\n\"Good God!\" he shouted aloud in his lonely cabin. \"It's gone for the\nyacht. _Adelaide_--turn north--full speed--\" he clicked off on a slow,\nstuttering key. \"Head north. You are being attacked!\" He groaned again\nas he saw the _Adelaide's_ shining ports swing away from the safety of\nthe north; the ship broached broadside to the waves and came slowly to\na stop.\n\n\"_Bennington_,\" he radioed. \"Brent--it has got the _Adelaide_.\nHelp--hurry! I am going over.\"\n\nHe tore wildly at the barred door, and he made a dash across the deck\nto slip sprawling in a heap against the rail where the slimy traces of\nthe recent visitor stretched glistening on the deck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow he lowered the boat Thorpe never knew. But he knew there was one\nthat the men from the _Bennington_ had swung over the side, and tore\nmadly at the tackle to let the boat crash miraculously upright into\nthe sea. He slung the rifle about his neck with a rope end--there were\ncartridges in his pocket--and he went down the dangling lines and cast\noff in a frenzy of haste.\n\nWhat could he do? He hardly dared form the question. Only this stood\nclear and unanswerable in his mind: The yacht was in the monster's\ngrip, and Ruth Allaire was there on board. Ruth Allaire, so smiling,\nso friendly, so lovable! Food for that horror from the depths.... He\nrowed with super-human strength to drive the heavy boat across the\nwave-swept distance that separated them.\n\nBetween gasping breaths he turned at times to glance over his shoulder\nand correct his course. And now, as he drew near, he saw though\nindistinct the unmistakable, snakelike weaving of horrible tenuous\nfingers, rolling and groping about the yacht.\n\nThey were plain as he drew alongside. The trim ship rose and fell with\nthe water, while over her side where Thorpe approached swung a long,\nwhite monstrous rope of flesh. It retreated like the lash of a whip,\nand the horrified watcher saw as it went the struggling figure of a\nman in the grasp of flabby lips. And above them a single eye glared\nwickedly.\n\nAnother vile, twisting arm rose from the afterdeck with a screaming\nfigure in its grasp and vanished into the water beyond the yacht.\nThere were others writhing about the decks. Thorpe saw them as he made\nhis boat fast and clambered aboard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA wave of reeking air enveloped him as he reached the deck; the\nnauseous stench from the monster's tentacles was horrible beyond\nendurance. He gagged and choked as the stifling breath entered his\nlungs.\n\nA huge rope of slippery, throbbing flesh stretched its twisted length\ntoward the stern. It contracted as he watched into bulging muscular\nrings and withdrew from the afterdeck. The deadly end of it stopped in\nmid-air not twenty feet from where he stood. The jawlike pincers on it\nheld the limp form of an officer in its sucking grip, while above, in\na protuberance like a gnarled horn, a great eye glared into Thorpe's\nwith devilish hatred.\n\nThe beak opened sharply to drop its unconscious burden upon the deck,\nand the watching man, petrified with horror, saw within the gaping maw\ngreat sucking discs and beyond them a brilliant glow. The whole\ncavernous pit was aflame with phosphorescent light. Dimly he knew that\nthis light explained the ability of the beastly arms to grope so\nsurely in the dark.\n\nThe eye narrowed as the gaping, fleshy jaws distended, and Robert\nThorpe, in a flash that galvanized him to action, was aware that his\nfight for life was on. He fired blindly from the hip, and the recoil\nof the heavy gun almost tore it from his hands. But he knew he had\naimed true, and the toothless, seeking jaws whipped in agony back into\nthe sea.\n\nThere were other arms whose eyes were searching the stern of the\nyacht. Thorpe plunged frenziedly down a companionway for the cabin he\nknew was Ruth Allaire's. Was he in time? Could he save her if he found\nher? His mind was in a turmoil of half-formed plans as he rushed madly\ndown the corridor to find the body of the girl a limp huddle across\nthe threshold of her cabin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was alive; he knew it as he swung her soft body across one\nshoulder and staggered with his burden up the stairs. If he could only\nbreathe! His throat was tight and strangling with the reeking\nputrescence in the air. And before his eyes was a picture of the\nstrong oak bars of his own retreat. Somehow, some way, he must get\nback to the abandoned ship.\n\nAn eye detected him as he came on deck, and he dropped the limp body\nof the girl at his feet as he swung his rifle toward the glowing light\nwithin the opening jaws. The sucking discs cupped and wrinkled in\ndread readiness in the fleshy, toothless opening. He emptied the\nmagazine into the head, though he knew this was only a feeler and a\nfeeder for a still more horrible mouth in the monstrous body that rose\nand fell tremendously in the dark waters beyond. But it was typical of\nRobert Thorpe that even in the horror and frenzy of the moment he\nrammed another clip of cartridges into his rifle before he stooped to\nagain raise the prostrate figure of Ruth Allaire.\n\nThe forward deck for the moment was clear; it rose high with the\nweight of the writhing, twisting arms that weighed down the stern of\nthe yacht where the crew had taken refuge.\n\nTo think of helping them was worse than folly--he dismissed the\nthought as another great eye came over the rail. Once more he used the\ngun, then lowered the girl to the waiting boat, and cast off and rowed\nwith the stealthiest of strokes into the dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind him were whipping points of light above the white brilliance of\nthe yacht _Adelaide_. The boat was tossing in great waves that came\nfrom beyond, where a body, incredibly huge, was tearing the waters to\nfoam. There were ghostly arms that shone in slimy wetness, that lashed\nsearchingly in all directions, as the monster gave vent to its fury at\nThorpe's attack. There were screaming human figures grasped in many of\nthe jaws, and the man was glad with a great thankfulness that the\ngirl's stupor could save her from the frightful sight.\n\nHe dared to row now, and his breath was coming in great choking sobs\nof sheer exhaustion when at last he pulled the senseless form of Ruth\nAllaire to the deck of the _Nagasaki_ and drew her within the frail\nshelter of the wireless room.\n\nStout had the oaken bars appeared, and safe his refuge in the\nbarricaded room, but that was before he had seen in horrible reality\nthe fearful fury of this monster from the deep. He placed the braces\nagainst the door and turned with hopeless haste to seize the wireless\nkey.\n\n\"_Bennington_,\" he called, and the answer came strong and clear.\n\"Where are you.... Help--\" His fingers froze upon the key and the\nanswering message in his ears was unheeded as he watched across the\nwater the destruction of the yacht.\n\nThis craft that had dared to resist the onset of the brute, to fight\nagainst it, to wound it, was feeling the full fury of the monster's\nrage. The gleaming lights of the doomed ship were waving lines that\nswept to and fro in the grip of those monstrous arms. The boat beneath\nThorpe's feet was tossing in the waves that told of the titanic\nstruggle. He had meant to look south for some sign of the oncoming\ndestroyer, but in fearful fascination he stared spellbound where the\nmasts of the trim yacht swept downward into the waves, where the green\nof her star-board lantern glowed faintly for an instant, then\nvanished, to leave only the darkness and the starlit sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA voice aroused him from his stupefaction. \"Where am I ... where am\nI?\" Ruth Allaire was asking in a frightened whisper. \"That terrible\nthing--\" She shuddered violently as memory returned to show again the\nhorror she had witnessed. \"Where are we, Robert? And the\n_Adelaide_--where is it?\"\n\nThorpe turned slowly. The insane turmoil of the past hour had numbed\nhis brain, stunned him.\n\n\"The _Adelaide_--\" he mumbled, and groped fumblingly for coherent\nthoughts. He stared at the girl. She was half-risen from the floor\nwhere he had laid her, and the sight of her quivering face brought\nreason again to his mind. He knelt tenderly beside her and raised her\nin his arms.\n\n\"Where is the yacht?\" she repeated. \"The _Adelaide_?\"\n\n\"Gone,\" Thorpe told her. \"Lost!\" A thought struck him.\n\n\"Was your father on board, Ruth?\"\n\nRuth was dazed.\n\n\"Lost,\" she repeated. \"The _Adelaide_--lost!... No,\" she added in\nbelated response to Thorpe's question. \"Daddy was not there. But the\nmen--Captain MacPherson ... that horrible monster....\" She buried her\nface in her hands as she realized what Thorpe's silence meant.\n\nHe held the trembling figure close as the girl whispered: \"Where are\nwe, Robert? Are we safe?\"\n\n\"We may win through yet,\" he told her through grim, set lips. He\nrealized abruptly that he was seeing the face of Ruth Allaire in the\nlight. He had left a lantern burning! He withdrew his arms from about\nher and sprang quickly to his feet to put out the tell-tale light. In\ndarkness and quiet was their only safety. And he knew as he sprang\nthat he had waited too long. A soft body crashed heavily on the deck\noutside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl's voice was shrill with terror as she began a question.\nThorpe's hand pressed upon her lips in the dark where he stood\nwaiting--waiting.\n\nA luminous something was glowing outside the cabin. It searched and\nprodded about the deserted deck to whip upward at the audible hiss of\nwet carbide. Another appeared; the rifle came slowly to the man's\nshoulder as a pair of jaws gaped glowingly beyond the windows and an\neye stared unblinkingly from its hornlike sheath. It crashed madly\nagainst the walls of the wireless room to shatter the glass and make\nkindling of the woodwork of the sash. Thorpe fired once and again\nbefore the specter vanished, and he knew with sickening certainty that\nthe wounds were only messages to some central brain that would send\nother ravening tentacles against them. But the oak bars had held.\n\nHe reached in the brief interval for the key, and he sent out one\nfinal call for help. He strained his ears against the head-set for\nsome friendly human word of hope.\n\n\"--rocket,\" the wireless man was saying. \"Fire rockets. We can't\nfind--\" A swift, writhing arm wrapped crushingly about the cabin as\nthe message ceased.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorpe seized his rifle and fired into the gray mass that bulged with\nterrible muscular contractions through the window. He fired again to\naim lengthways of the arm and inflict as damaging a wound as his\nweapon would permit.\n\nThe arm relaxed, but a score of others took up the attack. Again the\nsickening stench was about them as gaping jaws gleamed fiery beneath\nthe hateful eyes and tore at the flimsy structure. Thorpe jammed more\ncartridges into the gun and fired again and again, then dropped the\nweapon to fumble for the rockets that Brent had given him.\n\nHe lighted one with trembling fingers; the first ball shot straight\ninto a waiting mouth. Another ignited a searing flame of acetlylene\ngas where a wet arm writhed in the hot carbide trail. The man leaned\nfar out through the broken window.\n\nNo time to look around. He let the red flares stream upward high into\nthe air, then dropped the rocket hissing on the deck to seize once\nmore the rifle.\n\nA mass of muscle crashed against the door; it went to splinters under\nthe impact, and only the two oak bars remained to hold in check the\nhorrible tentacles and the darting heads. One mouth closed to a\npointed end that forced its way between the bars. The oak gave under\nthe strain as Robert Thorpe pulled vainly at an empty gun. Beside him\nrose shrieks of terror as the monstrous thing came on, and Thorpe beat\nwith frantic fury with his clubbed rifle at the fleshy snout.\n\nHe knew as he swung the weapon that the shrieks had ceased, then\nsmiled grimly in the numbing horror as he realized that Ruth Allaire\nwas beside him. A piece of oak was in her hands, and she was striking\nwith desperate and silent fury at the slimy flesh.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the end, Thorpe knew, and suddenly he was glad. The nightmare\nwas over, and the end was coming with this girl beside him. But Robert\nThorpe was fighting on to the last, and he tried to make his blows\nreach outward to the hateful devilish eye.\n\nHe saw it plainly now, for the deck was a glare of white light. He saw\nthe eye and the thick arm behind it and the score of others that made\na heaving, knotted mass were brilliant and wetly shining. He could see\nnow how best to strike, and he turned his gun to thrust with the\nbarrel at the eye.\n\nIt withdrew before his stroke--the jaws slid backward to the deck.\nThere were sounds that hammered at his ears. \"The guns! The guns!\" a\ngirl was screaming. Across the deck, where a search-light played,\nhuge arms were lashing backward toward the sea. The waves beyond had\nvanished where a monstrous body shone wetly black in a blinding glare.\n\nAnd the man hung panting, helpless, on the one remaining bar across\nthe doorway to look where, beyond, her forward guns a spitting stream\nof staccato flashes, the _Bennington_ tore the waves to high-thrown\nspray. Her four clean funnels swung far over as the slim ship, with\nher stabbing, crashing guns, swung in a sweeping circle to bear down\nupon the black bulk slowly sinking in the search-light's glare.\n\nThe vast body had vanished as the destroyer shot like one of her own\nprojectiles over the spot where the beast had lain. And then, where\nshe had passed, the sea arose in a heaving mound. The big ship beneath\nthe watching man shuddered again as another depth charge grumbled its\nchallenge to the master of the deeps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe warship went careening on an arc to return and throw the full\nglare of her search-lights on the scene. They lighted a vast sea,\nstrangely stilled. An oily smoothness leveled waves and ironed them\nout to show more clearly the convulsions of a torn mass that rose\nslowly into sight.\n\nThorpe in some way found himself outside the cabin. And he knew that\nthe girl was again beside him as he stared and stared at what the\nwaters held. A bloated serpent form beyond believing was struggling in\nthe greasy swell. Its waving tentacles again were flung aloft in\nimpotent fury, and, beneath them, where their thick ends jointed the\nbody, a head with one horrible eye rose into the air. A thick-lipped\nmouth gaped open, and the gleam of molars shone white in the blinding\nglare.\n\nThe twisting body shuddered throughout its vast bulk, and the waving\narms and futile staring eyes dropped helpless into the splashing sea.\nAgain the revolting head was raised as the destroyer sent a rain of\nshells into its fearful mass. Once more the oily seas were calm. They\nclosed over the whirling vortex where a denizen of the lightless\ndepths was returning to those distant, subterranean caverns--returning\nas food for what other voracious monsters might still exist.\n\nThe man's arm was about the figure of the girl, trembling anew in a\nfresh reaction from the horror they had escaped, when a small boat\ndrew alongside.\n\n\"They're safe,\" a hoarse voice bellowed back to the destroyer, and a\nman came monkeywise up a rope where Thorpe had launched his boat.\n\nAnd now, as one in a dream, Thorpe allowed the girl to be taken from\nhim, to be lowered to the waiting boat. He clambered down himself and\nin silence was rowed across to the destroyer.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Brent, as he met them at the rail. \"You're safe, old\nman ... and Miss Allaire ... both of you! You let off that rocket just\nin time; we couldn't pick you up with our light--\n\n\"And now,\" he added, \"we're going back; back to San Diego. The Admiral\nwants a word of mouth report.\"\n\nThorpe stilled him with a heavy gesture. \"Give Ruth an opiate,\" he\nsaid dully. \"Let her forget ... forget!... Good God, can we ever\nforget--\" He stumbled forward, heedless of Brent's arm across his\nshoulders as the surgeon took the girl in charge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAdmiral Struthers, U.S.N., leaned back from his desk and blew a cloud\nof smoke thoughtfully toward the ceiling. He looked silently from\nThorpe to Commander Brent.\n\n\"If either one of you had come to me with such a report,\" he said\nfinally, \"I would have found it incredible; I would have thought you\nwere entirely insane, or trying some wild hoax.\"\n\n\"I wish it were a damn lie,\" said Thorpe quietly. \"I wish I didn't\nhave to believe it.\" There were new lines about the young-old eyes,\nlines that spoke what the lips would not confess of sleepless nights\nand the impress of a picture he could not erase.\n\n\"Well, we have kept it out of the papers,\" said the Admiral. \"Said it was a\nderelict, and the wild messages floating about were from an inexperienced\nman, frightened and irresponsible. Bad advertising--very--for the passenger\nlines.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Commander Brent agreed, \"but of course Mr. Thorpe may want to\nuse this in his next book of travel. He has earned the right without\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Thorpe emphatically. \"No! I told you, Brent, there was\noften a factual basis for fables--remember? Well, we have proved that.\nBut sometimes it is best to leave the fables just fables. I think you\nwill agree.\" A light step sounded in the corridor beyond. \"Nothing of\nthis to Miss Allaire,\" he said sharply.\n\nThe men rose as Ruth Allaire entered the room. \"We were just\nspeaking,\" said the Admiral with an engaging smile beneath his\nclose-cut mustache, \"of the matter of a bet. Mr. Thorpe has won\nhandily, and he has taught me a lesson.\"\n\nHe took a check book from his desk. \"What charity would you like to\nname, Miss Allaire? That was left to you, you remember.\"\n\n\"Some seamen's home,\" said Ruth Allaire gravely. \"You will know best,\nif you two are really serious about that silly bet.\"\n\n\"That bet, my dear,\" said Robert Thorpe with smiling eyes, \"was very\nserious ... and it has had most serious consequences.\" He turned to\nthe waiting men and extended a hand in farewell.\n\n\"We are going to Europe, Ruth and I,\" he told them. \"Just rambling\naround a bit. Our honeymoon, you know. Look us up if you're cruising\nout that way.\"\n\n\n\n\nMurder Madness\n\nPART TWO OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Murray Leinster_\n\n[Illustration: \"_As the madness grew, the two men fought. They were\nmurder mad. The local sub-deputy gave his guests the thrill of\nwatching maniacs battling to the death._\"]\n\n[Sidenote: Bell, of the secret \"Trade,\" strikes into the South\nAmerican jungle to find the hidden stronghold of The Master--the\nunknown monster whose diabolical poison swiftly and surely is\nenslaving the whole continent.]\n\n\nSeven United States Secret Service men have disappeared in South\nAmerica. Another is found--a screaming homicidal maniac. It is rumored\nthat they are victims of a diabolical poison which produces \"murder\nmadness.\"\n\nCharley Bell, of the \"Trade\"--a secret service organization that does\nnot officially exist--discovers that a sinister system of slavery is\nflourishing in South America, headed by a mysterious man known only as\nThe Master. This slavery is accomplished by means of a poison which\ncauses its victims to experience a horrible writhing of the hands,\nfollowed by a madness to do murder, two weeks after the poison is\ntaken.\n\nThe victims get relief only with an antidote supplied through Ribiera,\nThe Master's Chief Deputy; but in the antidote there is more of the\npoison which again in two weeks will take effect. And so it is that a\nperson who once receives the poison is forever enslaved.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBell learns that Ribiera has kidnapped Paula Canalejas, daughter of a\nBrazilian cabinet minister--himself a victim--who has killed himself\non feeling the \"murder madness,\" caused by the poison, coming over\nhim. Bell corners Ribiera in his home, buries the muzzles of two\nsix-guns in his stomach, and demands that he set Paula free.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIn this room the electric lights were necessary at all times. And it\noccurred to Bell irrelevantly that perhaps there were no windows\nbecause there might be sometimes rather noisy scenes within these\nwalls. And windows will convey the sound of screaming to the outside\nair, while solid walls will not.\n\nHe stood alert and grim, with his revolvers pressing into Ribiera's\nflabby flesh. His fingers were tensed upon the triggers. If he killed\nRibiera, he would be killed. Of course. And men and women he had known\nand liked might be doomed to the most horrible of fates by Ribiera's\ndeath. Yet even the death or madness of many men was preferable to the\nsuccess of the conspiracy in which Ribiera seemed to figure largely.\n\nRibiera looked up at him with the eyes of a terrified snake. There was\na little stirring at the door.\n\n\"Your friends,\" said Bell softly, \"had better not come close.\"\n\nRibiera gasped an order. The stirrings stopped. Paula came slowly into\nthe room quite alone. She smiled queerly at Bell.\n\n\"I believed that you would come,\" she said quietly. \"And yet I do not\nknow that we can escape.\"\n\n\"We're going to try,\" said Bell grimly. To Ribiera he added curtly,\n\"You'd better order the path cleared to the door, and have one of your\ncars brought around.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera croaked a repetition of the command.\n\n\"Now stand up--slowly,\" said Bell evenly. \"Very slowly. I don't want\nto die, Ribiera, so I don't want to kill you. But I haven't much hope\nof escape, so I shan't hesitate very long about doing it. And I've got\nthese guns' hammers trembling at full cock. If I get a bullet through\nmy head, they'll go off just the same and kill you.\"\n\nRibiera got up. Slowly. His face was a pasty gray.\n\n\"Your major-domo,\" Bell told him matter-of-factly, \"will go before us\nand open every door on both sides of the way to the street. Paula\"--he\nused her given came without thought, or without realizing it--\"Paula\nwill go and look into each door. If she as much as looks frightened, I\nfire, and try to fight the rest of the way clear. Understand? I'm\ngoing to get down to a boat I have ready in the harbor if I have to\nkill you and every living soul in the house!\"\n\nThere was no boat in the harbor, naturally. But the major-domo moved\nhesitantly across the room, looking at his master for orders. For\nRibiera to die meant death or madness to his slaves. The major-domo's\nface was ghastly with fear. He moved onward, and Bell heard the sound\nof doors being thrust wide. Once he gave a command in the staccato\nfashion of a terrified man. Bell nodded grimly.\n\n\"Now we'll move. Slowly, Ribiera! Always slowly.... Ah! That's better!\nPaula, you go on before and look into each room. I shall be sorry if\nany of your servants follow after you, Ribiera.... Through the\ndoorway. Yes! All clear, Paula? I'm balancing the hammers very\ncarefully, Ribiera. Very delicate work. It is fortunate for you that\nmy nerves are rather steady. But really, I don't much care.... Still\nall clear before us, Paula? With the servants nerve-racked as they\nare, I believe we'll make it through, even if I do kill Ribiera.\nThere'll be no particular point in killing us then. It won't help\nthem. Don't stumble, please, Ribiera.... Go carefully, and very\nslowly....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRibiera's face was a gray mask of terror when they reached the door. A\nlong, low car with two men on the chauffeur's seat was waiting.\n\n\"Only one man up front, Ribiera,\" said Bell dryly. \"No ostentation,\nplease. Now, I hope your servants haven't summoned the police, because\nthey might want to stop me from marching you out there with a gun in\nthe small of your back. And that would be deplorable, Ribiera. Quite\ndeplorable.\"\n\nWith a glance, he ordered Paula into the tonneau. He followed her,\ndriving Ribiera before him. There seemed to be none about but the\nstricken, terrified servant who had opened the door for their exit.\n\n\"My friend,\" Bell told the major-domo grimly, \"I'll give you a bit of\ncomfort. I'm not going to try to take the Senhor Ribiera away with me.\nOnce I'm on board the yacht that waits for me, I'll release him so he\ncan keep you poor devils sane until my Government has found a way to\nbeat this devilish poison of his. Then I'll come back and kill him.\nNow you can tell the chauffeur to drive us to the Biera Mar.\"\n\nHe settled back in his seat. There were beads of perspiration on his\nforehead, but he could not wipe them off. He held the two revolvers\nagainst Ribiera's flabby body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car turned the corner, and he added dryly:\n\n\"Your servants, Ribiera, will warn your more prominent slaves of my\nintention of going on board a yacht. Preparations will be made to stop\nevery pleasure boat and search it for me. So ... tell your chauffeur\nto swing about and make for the flying field. And tell him to drive\ncarefully, by the way. I've still got these guns on a very fine\nadjustment of the trigger-pressure.\"\n\nRibiera croaked the order. Bell was exactly savage enough to kill him\nif he did not escape.\n\nFor twenty minutes the car sped through the residential districts of\nRio. The sun was high in the air, but clouds were banking up above the\nPao d'Assucar--the Sugarloaf--and it looked as if there might be one\nof the sudden summer thunderstorms that sometimes sweep Rio.\n\nThen the clear road to the flying field. Rio has the largest\nmetropolitan district in the world, but a great deal of it is piled on\nend, and Rio itself built on most of the rest. The flying field is\nnecessarily some miles from even the residential districts, for the\nsake of a level plain of sufficient area.\n\nThe car shot ahead through practically untouched jungle, interspersed\nwith tiny clearings in which were patchwork houses that might have\nbeen a thousand miles in the interior instead of so near the center of\nall civilization in Brazil. Up smooth gradients. Around beautifully\nengineered curves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell put aside one revolver long enough to search Ribiera carefully.\nHe found a pearl-handled automatic, and handed it to Paula.\n\n\"Worth having,\" he said cheerfully. \"I wonder if you'd mind searching\nthe chauffeur: with that gun at his head I think he'd be peaceful. You\nneedn't have him stop.\"\n\nPaula stood up, smiling a little.\n\n\"I did not think I lacked courage, Senhor,\" she observed, \"but you\nhave taught me more.\"\n\n\"_Nil desperandum_,\" said Bell lightly. He relaxed deliberately.\nMatters would be tense at the flying field, and he would need to be\nwholly calm. There was little danger of an attempt at rescue here, and\nthe necessity of being ready to shoot Ribiera at any instant was no\nlonger a matter of split seconds.\n\nHe watched, while, bent over the back of the front seat, she extracted\ntwo squat weapons from the chauffeur's pockets.\n\n\"Quite an arsenal,\" said Bell as he pocketed them. He turned\npleasantly to Ribiera. \"Now, Ribiera, you understand just what I want.\nThat big amphibian plane of yours is fairly fast, and once when I was\nmerely your guest you assured me that it was always kept fueled and\neven provisioned for a long flight. When we reach the flying field I\nwant it rolled out and warmed up, over at the other end of the field\nfrom the flying line. We'll go over to it in the car.\n\n\"And I've thought of something. It worried me, before, because\nsometimes if a man's shot he merely relaxes all over. So while we're\nat the flying field I'm going to be holding back the triggers of these\nguns with my thumbs. I don't have to pull the trigger at all--just let\ngo and they'll go off. It isn't so fine an adjustment as I had just\nnow, but it's safer for you as long as you behave. And you might urge\nyour chauffeur to be cautious. I do hope, Ribiera, that you won't look\nas if you were frightened. If there's any hitch, and delay for letting\nsome fuel out of the tanks or messing up the motors, I'll be very\nsorry for you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car swooped out into bright sunshine. The flying field lay below,\nalready in the shadow of the banking clouds above. Hangars lay\nstretched out across the level space.\n\nThrough the gates. Ribiera licked his lips. Bell jammed the revolver\nmuzzles closer against his sides. The chauffeur halted the car. Paula\nspoke softly to him. He stiffened. Bell found it possible to smile\nfaintly.\n\nRibiera gave orders. There was a moment's pause--the revolver muzzles\nwent deeper into his side--and he snarled a repetition. The official\ncringed and moved swiftly.\n\n\"You have chosen your slaves well, Ribiera,\" said Bell coolly. \"They\nseem to occupy all strategic positions. We'll ride across.\"\n\nThe gears clashed. The car swerved forward and went deliberately\nacross the wide clear space that was the flying field. It halted near\nthe farther side. In minutes the door of a hangar swung wide. There\nwas the sputtering of a not-yet-warmed-up motor. The big plane came\nslowly out, its motors coughing now and then. It swung clumsily across\nthe field, turned in a wide circle, and stopped some forty or fifty\nfeet from the car.\n\n\"Send the mechanic back, on foot,\" said Bell softly.\n\nAgain Ribiera found it expedient to snarl. And Bell added, gently,\nwhile the throttled-down motors of the big amphibian boomed on:\n\n\"Now get out of the car.\"\n\nTiny figures began to gaze curiously at them from the row of hangars.\nThe mechanic, starting back on foot, the four people getting out of\nthe car, the big plane waiting....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith his revolver ready and aimed at Ribiera's bulk, Bell reached in\nthe front of the car and turned off the switch. The motor died\nabruptly. He put the key in his pocket.\n\n\"Just to get a minute or two extra start,\" he said dryly. \"Climb up in\nthe plane, Paula.\"\n\nShe obeyed, and turned at the top.\n\n\"I will cover them until you are up,\" she said quietly.\n\nBell laughed, now. A genuine laugh, for the first time in many days.\n\n\"We do work together!\" he said cheerfully.\n\nBut he backed up the ladder. There was a stirring over by the hangars.\nThe mechanic who had taxied the plane to this spot was a dwindling\nspeck, no more than a third of the way across the field. But even from\nthe distant hangars it could be seen that something was wrong.\n\n\"Close the door, Paula,\" said Bell. He had seated himself at the\ncontrols, and scanned the instruments closely.\n\nThis machine was heavy and large and massive. The boat-body between\nthe retractable wheels added weight to the structure, and when Bell\ngave it the gun it seemed to pick up speed with an irritating\nslowness, and to roll and lurch very heavily when it did begin to\napproach flying speed. The run was long before the tail came up. It\nwas longer before the joltings lessened and the plane began to rise\nslowly, with the solid steadiness that only a large and heavily loaded\nplane can compass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp, and up.... Bell was three hundred feet high when he crossed the\nhangars and saw tiny faces staring up at him. Some of the small\nfigures were pointing across the field. The big plane circled widely,\ngaining altitude, and Bell gazed down. Ribiera was gesticulating\nwildly, pointing upward to the soaring thing, shaking his fist at it,\nand making imperious, frantic motions of command.\n\nBell took one quick glance all about the horizon. Toward the sea the\nsun shone down brilliantly upon the city. Inland a broad white wall of\nadvancing rain moved toward the coastline. And Bell smiled frostily,\nand flung the big ship into a dive and swooped down upon Ribiera as a\nhawk might swoop at a chicken.\n\nRibiera saw the monster thing bearing down savagely, its motors\nbellowing, its nose pointed directly at him. And there is absolutely\nnothing more terrifying upon the earth than to see a plane diving upon\nyou with deadly intent. A panic that throws back to non-human\nancestors seizes upon a man. He feels the paralysis of those ancient\nanthropoids who were preyed upon by dying races of winged monsters in\nthe past. That racial, atavistic terror seizes upon him.\n\nBell laughed, though it sounded more like a bark, as Ribiera flung\nhimself to the ground and screamed hoarsely when the plane seemed\nabout to pounce upon him. The shrill timbre of the shriek cut through\nthe roaring of the motors, even through the thick padding of the big\nplane's cabin walls that reduced that roaring to a not intolerable\ngrowl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the plane passed ten feet or more above his head. It rose, and\nclimbed steeply, and passed again above the now buzzing, agitated\nhangars, and climbed above the hills behind the flying field as some\nmen went running and others moved by swifter means toward the shaken,\nnerve-racked Ribiera, on whose lips were flecks of foam.\n\nBell looked far below and far behind him. The incredible greenness of\ntropic verdure, of the jungle which rings Rio all about. The many\nglitterings of sunlight upon glass, and upon the polished domes of\nsundry public buildings, and the multitudinous shimmerings of the\ntropic sun upon the bay. The deep dark shadow of the banking clouds\ndrew a sharp line across the earth, and deep in that shadow lay the\nflying field, growing small and distant as the plane flew on. But\nspecks raced across the wide expanse. In a peculiar, irrational\nfashion those specks darted toward a nearly invisible speck, and\nencountered other specks darting away from that nearly invisible\nspeck, and gradually all the specks were turned about and racing for\nthe angular, toy-block squares which were the hangars of the\naeroplanes of the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLittle white things appeared from those hangars--planes being thrust\nout into the open air while motes of men raced agitatedly about them.\nOne of them was suddenly in motion. It moved slowly and clumsily\nacross the ground, and then abruptly moved more swiftly. It seemed to\nfloat upward and to swing about in mid-air. It came floating toward\nthe amphibian, though apparently nearly stationary against the sky.\nAnother moved jerkily, and another....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust before the big plane dived into the wide white wall of falling\nwater, the air behind it seemed to swarm with aircraft.\n\nIn the cabin of the amphibian, of course, the bellowing of the motors\noutside was muffled to a certain degree. Paula clung to the seats and\nmoved awkwardly up to the place beside Bell. She had just managed to\nseat herself when the falling sheet of water obliterated all the\nworld.\n\n\"Strap yourself in your seat,\" he said in her ear above the persistent\ntumult without. \"Then you might adjust my safety-belt. Well be flying\nblind in this rain. I hope the propellers hold.\"\n\nShe fumbled, first at the belt beside his upholstered chair, and only\nafterward adjusted her own. He sent a quick glance at her.\n\n\"Shouldn't have done that,\" he said quietly. \"I can manage somehow.\"\n\nThe plane lurched and tumbled wildly. He kicked rudder and jerked on\nthe stick, watching the instrument board closely. In moments the wild\ngyrations ceased.\n\n\"The beginning of this,\" he said evenly, \"is going to be hectic.\nThere'll be lightning soon.\"\n\nAlmost on his words the gray mist out the cabin windows seemed to\nflame. There was thunder even above the motors. But the faint,\nperceptible trembling of the whole plane under the impulse of its\nengines kept on. Bell kept his eyes on the bank and turn indicator,\nglancing now and then at the altimeter.\n\n\"We've got to climb,\" he said shortly, \"up where the lightning is,\ntoo. We want to pass the Serra da Carioca with room to spare, or we'll\ncrash on it.\"\n\nThere was no noticeable change in the progress of the plane, of\ncourse. Rain was dashing against the windows of the cabin with an\nincredible velocity. Rain at a hundred miles an hour acts more like\nhail than water, anyhow, and Bell was trusting grimly to the hope that\nthe propellers were of steel, which will withstand even hail, and a\nhope that the blast through the engine cowlings would keep the wiring\nfree of water-made short circuits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the air was bad beyond belief. At times the plane spun like\nthistledown in a vast and venomous flood that crashed into the\nwindows with a vicious rattling. Lightning began and grew fiercer. It\nseemed at times as if the plane were whirling crazily in sheer\nincandescent flame. The swift air-currents at the beginning of a\ntropic thunderstorm were here multiplied in trickiness and velocity by\nthe hills of the Serra da Carioca, and Bell was flying blind as well.\nThe safety-belts were needed fifty times within twenty minutes, as the\nbig ship was flung about by fierce blasts that sometimes blew even the\nrain upward for a time. And over all, as the amphibian spun madly, and\ntoppled crazily and fought for height, there was the terrific,\nincessant crashing of thunder which was horribly close, and the\ncrackling flares of lightning all about.\n\n\"I'm going to take a chance,\" said Bell curtly above the uproar, with\nthe windows seeming to look out upon the fires of hell. \"I think we're\nhigh enough. The compass has gone crazy, but I'm going to risk it.\"\n\nAgain there was no perceptible alteration in the motion of the ship,\nbut he fought it steadily toward the west. And it seemed that he\nactually was passing beyond the first fierce fringe of the storm,\nbecause the lightning became--well, not less frequent, but less\ncontinuous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd suddenly, in a blinding flare of light that made every separate\nraindrop look like a speck of molten metal, he saw another airplane.\nIt was close. Breath-takingly close. It came diving down out of\nnowhere and passed less than twenty yards before the nose of the\namphibian. It glistened with wet, and glittered unbearably in the\nincredible brightness of the lightning. Every spot and speck and\ndetail showed with an almost ghastly distinctness. But it dived on\npast, its pilot rigid and tense and unseeing, plunging like a meteor\nstraight downward. The golden, iridescent mist of rain closed over its\nbody. And it was gone.\n\nTen minutes later Bell was driving onward through a gray obscurity,\nwhich now was no more than tinted pink by receding lightning-flashes.\nThe air was still uneven and treacherous. The big plane hurtled\ndownward hundreds of feet in wild descending gusts among the hills,\nand was then flung upward on invisible billows of air for other\nhundreds of feet. But it was less uncontrollable. There were periods\nof minutes when the safety-belts did not come into use.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd later still, half an hour perhaps, the steadiness of the air gave\nassurance that the plane was past the range of the Serra da Carioca\nand was headed inland. He drove on, watching his instruments and\nflying blind, but with a gathering confidence in an ultimate escape\nfrom the swarm of aircraft Ribiera had sent aloft in the teeth of the\nstorm to hunt for him. The motors hummed outside the padded cabin. The\ngirl beside him was very quiet and very still and very pale.\n\n\"We want to get out of this before long,\" he said in her ear, \"and\nthen we can find out where we are, and especially begin to make some\nplans for ourselves.\"\n\nHer eyes turned to him. There was a curious stiffness in her manner.\nIt might have seemed reserve, but Bell recognized the symptoms of a\nwoman whose self-control is hanging by a thread. He smiled.\n\n\"Hold on a while yet,\" he said gently. \"I know you want to cry. But\nplease hold on a while yet. When we reach friends....\"\n\nHer hands went to her throat, and he could feel the effort of will\nthat kept her voice steady.\n\n\"Friends? We have no friends.\" She managed a smile. \"The Senhor\nRibiera explained to me when I arrived at his house how it was that no\nquestions would be asked about my disappearance. My father is dead.\nThe newspapers this morning said that it was not known whether he\nkilled himself or was assassinated. The Senhor Ribiera has given\norders to his slaves. The newspapers of this afternoon will inform a\nhorrified world that you and I, together, murdered my father that we\nmight flee together with such of his riches as he had actually\ngathered together for me to take away. We are murderers, my friend.\nCables and telegraph wires are reporting the news. The daughter of the\nMinister of War of the Republic of Brazil was assisted by her lover to\nmurder her father. She has fled with him. Now--where are we still to\nfind friends?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell stared, for the fraction of an instant. One thought came to him,\nand was checked. The Trade does not exist, anywhere. The Trade would\nnot help. And murderers are always duly handed over when the\nGovernment of the United States is requested politely to do so by\nanother nation. Always. And so far as the whole civilized world was\nconcerned they were murderers. Even the employees of the flying field\nwho were not subject to The Master would swear to the strictly\naccurate story of their escape together.\n\n\"It is just scandalous enough and horrible enough,\" said Bell quietly,\n\"to be reprinted everywhere as news. You're right. We haven't any\nfriends. We're up against it. And so I think we'll have to hunt down\nand kill The Master. Then we'll be believed. And there are just two of\nus, with what weapons we have in our pockets, to attack. How many\nthousands of slaves do you suppose The Master has by now?\"\n\nAnd, quite suddenly, he laughed.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe sun was sinking slowly when the plane appeared above the valley.\nThere was only jungle below. Jungle, and the languid river which now\nflowed sluggishly into a wide and shallow pool in which drowned trees\nformed a mass of substance neither land nor marsh nor river. The\nriver now contracted to a narrow space and showed signs of haste, and\neven foaming water, and then again flowed placidly onward, sometimes\neven a hundred yards in breadth. Shadows of the mountains to the west\nwere creeping toward the opposite hill-flanks, darkening the thick\nfoliage and sending flocks of flying things home to their chosen\nroosts.\n\nThe sound of the plane was a buzzing noise, which grew louder to a\nsharp drone as it seemed to increase in size, and became a dull\nmonotonous roar as it dipped toward the waters of the stream. It\nfloated downward, very gently, and circled as if regarding a certain\nspot critically, and resumed its onward flight. Again it circled,\nanxiously, now, as if the time for alighting were short.\n\nIt seemed to hesitate in mid-air, and dived, and circled up-stream and\ncame down the valley again. It sank, and sank, lower and lower, until\nthe white of its upper wings was hidden by the tall trees on either\nside.\n\nA _jabiru_ stork saw it from downstream, solemnly squatting on four\neggs which eventually would perpetuate the race. The _jabiru_ was\nabout forty feet above the water and had a clear view of the stream.\nThe stork squatted meditatively, with its long, naked neck projecting\nabove the edge of its nest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane dipped ever lower, its reflection vivid and complete upon\nthe waveless stream below it. Ten feet above the water. Five--and\nswift ripples from the rush of air disturbed the unbroken reflections\nbehind. It was almost a silhouette against the mirrored appearance of\nthe sunset sky. And then a clumsy-seeming boat body touched water with\na vast hissing sound, and settled more and more heavily, while the\nspeed of the plane checked markedly and its motors roared on\nsenselessly.\n\nThen, abruptly, the plane checked and partly swung around. The\n_jabiru_ half-rose from its eggs. The motors were bellowing wildly\nagain. As if tearing itself free, the plane sheered off from some\ninvisible obstacle, one of its wing tip floats splashed water wildly,\nand, with the motors thundering at their fullest speed, it went toward\nthe shore with a dragging wing, like some wounded bird.\n\nIt beached, and the _jabiru_ heard a sudden dense silence fall. A man\nclimbed out of the boatlike body. He walked to the bow and dropped to\nthe shore. He peered under the upward slanting nose of the boat-thing.\nThe _jabiru_, listening intently, heard words.\n\nThen, quite suddenly and quite abruptly, and generally with the\nunostentatious efficiency with which Nature manages such things in the\ntropics, night fell. It was dark within minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise of Bell's scrambling back onto the deck of the amphibian's\nhull could be heard inside the cabin. He opened the door and slipped\ndown inside.\n\n\"There ought to be some lights,\" he said curtly. \"Ribiera did himself\nrather well, as a rule.\"\n\nHe struck a match. Paula's eyes shone in the match-flame, fixed upon\nhis face. He looked about, frowning. He found a switch and pressed it,\nand a dome-light came into being. The cabin of the plane, from a place\nof darkness comparable to that of the jungle all about, became\nsuddenly a cosy and comfortable place.\n\n\"Well?\" said Paula quietly.\n\nBell hesitated, and took a deep breath.\n\n\"We're stuck,\" he said wryly. \"We must have struck a snag or perhaps a\nrock, just under water. Half the bottom of the hull's torn out.\nThere's no hope of repair. If I hadn't given her the gun and beached\nher, we'd have sunk in mid-stream.\"\n\nPaula said nothing.\n\n\"Things are piling on us,\" said Bell grimly. \"In the morning I'll try\nto make a raft. We can't stay here indefinitely. I'll hunt for maps\nand we'll try to plan something out. But I'll admit that this business\nworries me--the plane being smashed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe passed his hand harassedly over his forehead. To have escaped from\nRio was something, but since Paula had told him Ribiera's plans, it\nwas clearly but the most temporary of successes. Cabinet ministers are\nnot so commonplace but that the scandalous and horrifying crime that\nwas imputed to Bell and Paula would be printed in every foreign\ncountry. Newspapers in Tokio would include the supposed murder in\ntheir foreign news, and in Bucharest and even Constantinople it would\nmerit a paragraph or two. Assuredly every South American country would\ndiscuss the matter editorially, even where The Master's deputies did\nnot order it published far and wide. There would be pictures of Bell\nand of Paula, labeled with an infamy. In every town of all Brazil\ntheir faces would be known, and those who were The Master's slaves\nwould hunt them desperately, and all honorable men would seek them for\na crime. Even in America there would be no safety for them. The Trade\ndoes not exist, officially, and a member of the Trade must get out of\ntrouble as he can. As an accused murderer, Bell would be arrested\nanywhere. As worse than a mere murderess, Paula....\n\nShe was watching his face.\n\n\"This morning,\" she said queerly, \"you--you quoted '_Nil\ndesperandum_.'\"\n\nBell ground his teeth, and then managed to smile.\n\n\"If I looked like I needed you say that,\" he said coolly, \"I deserve\nto be kicked. Let's look for something to eat, and count up our\nresources. The thing to do is, when you fall down--bounce!\"\n\nHe managed a nearly genuine grin, then, and to his intense amazement,\nshe sobbed suddenly and bent her head down and began to weep. He\nstared at her in stupefaction for an instant, then swore at himself\nfor a fool. Her father....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour later he roused her as gently as he could. It was\nhelplessness, as much as anything else, that had made him leave her\nalone; but a woman needs to weep now and then. And Paula assuredly had\nexcuse.\n\n\"Here's a cup of coffee,\" he said practically, \"which you must drink.\nYou can't have had anything to eat all day. Have you?\"\n\nThat question had haunted him too. She had been a prisoner in\nRibiera's house for half an hour, possibly more. And Ribiera had in\nhis possession, and used, a deadly, devilish poison from some unknown\nnoxious plant. Its victim took the poison unknowingly, in a morsel of\nfood or a glass of water or of wine. And for two weeks there was no\nsign of evil. And then the poison drove its victim swiftly mad--unless\nthe antidote was obtained from Ribiera. And Ribiera administered the\nantidote with a further dose of poison.\n\nIf Paula had eaten one scrap of food or drunk one drop of water while\nRibiera's captive....\n\nShe understood. She looked up suddenly, and read the awful anxiety in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"No. Nothing.\" She caught her breath and steadied herself with an\neffort of the will. \"I understand. You tried not to let me fear. But I\nate nothing, touched nothing. I have not that to fear, at least.\"\n\n\"Drink this coffee,\" said Bell, smiling. \"Ribiera was a luxurious\ndevil. There's canned stuff and so on in a locker. He was prepared for\na forced landing anywhere. Flares and rockets will do us no good, but\nthere are a pair of machetes and a sporting rifle with shells. We\ndon't need to die for a bit, anyhow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula obediently took the coffee. He watched her anxiously as she\ndrank.\n\n\"Now some soup,\" he urged, \"and the rest of this condensed stuff. And\nI've found some maps and there's a radio receiving outfit if--\"\n\nPaula managed to smile.\n\n\"You want to know,\" she said, \"if I can endure listening to it. Yes.\nI--I should not have given way just now. But I can endure anything.\"\n\nBell still hesitated, regarding her soberly.\n\n\"I've heard,\" he said awkwardly, \"that in Brazil the conventions....\"\n\nShe waited, looking at him with her large eyes.\n\n\"I hoped,\" said Bell, still more unhappily, \"to find this place\nMoradores, where you said you had some relatives. I hoped to find it\nbefore dark. But before I landed I knew I'd missed it and couldn't\nhope to locate it to-night. I thought--\"\n\n\"You thought,\" said Paula, smiling suddenly, \"that my reputation would\nbe jeopardized. And you were about to offer--\"\n\nBell winced.\n\n\"Of course I don't mean to act like an ass,\" he said apologetically,\n\"but some people....\"\n\n\"You forget,\" said Paula, with the same faint smile, \"what the\nnewspapers will say of us, Senhor. You forget what news of us the\ncables have carried about the world. I think that we had better forget\nabout the conventions. As the daughter of a Brazilian, that remark is\nheresy. But did you know that my mother came from Maryland?\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Bell relievedly. \"Then you can believe that I'm not\nthinking exclusively of you, and maybe we'll get somewhere.\"\n\nPaula put out her hand. He grasped it firmly.\n\n\"Right!\" he said, more cheerfully than ever before. \"Now we'll turn on\nthe radio and see what news we get.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInto the deep dark jungle night, then, a strange incongruity was\nthrust. Tall trees loomed up toward the stars. A nameless little\nstream flowed placidly through the night and, beached where\nimpenetrable undergrowth crowded to the water's edge, a big amphibian\nplane lay slightly askew, while a light glowed brightly in its cabin.\nMore, from that cabin there presently emerged the incredible sound of\nmusic, played in Rio for _os gentes_ of the distinctly upper strata of\nsociety by a bored but beautifully trained orchestra.\n\nThe _jabiru_ stork heard it, and craned its featherless neck to stare\ndownward through beady eyes. But it was not frightened. Presently,\ninstead of music, there was a man's voice booming in the disconnected\nsounds of human speech. And still the _jabiru_ was unalarmed. Like\nmost of the birds whose necks are bald, the _jabiru_ is a useful\nscavenger, and so is tolerated in the haunts of men. And if man's\ngratitude is not enough for safety, the _jabiru_ smells very, very\nbadly, and no man hunts his tribe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell had been listening impatiently, when a sudden whining, whistling\nnoise broke into the program of very elevated music, played utterly\nwithout rest. The sound came from the speaker, of course.\n\nHe frowned thoughtfully. The whistling changed in timbre and became\nflutelike, then changed again, nearly to its original pitch and tone.\n\nPaula was not listening. Her mind seemed very far away, and on\nsubjects the reverse of pleasurable.\n\n\"Listen!\" said Bell suddenly. \"You hear that whistle? It came on all\nat once!\"\n\nPaula waited. The whistling noise went on. It was vaguely discordant,\nand it was monotonous, and it was more than a little irritating. Again\nit changed timbre, going up to the shrillest of squealings, and back\nnearly to its original sound an instant later.\n\nBell began to paw over maps. The plane had been intended for flight\nover the vast distances of Brazil, and there was a small supply of\ncondensed food and a sporting rifle and shells included in its\nequipment. Emergency landing fields are not exactly common in the back\ncountry of South America.\n\n\"Here,\" said Bell sharply. \"Here is where we are. It must be where we\nare! No towns of any size nearby. No railroad. No boat route. Nothing!\nNothing but jungle shown here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe frowned absorbedly over the problem.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Paula.\n\n\"Someone near,\" said Bell briefly. \"That's another radio receiver, an\nold fashioned regenerative set, sensitive enough and reliable enough,\nbut a nuisance to everyone but its owner--except when it's a godsend,\nas it is to us.\"\n\nThe music ended, and a voice announced in laboriously classic\nPortuguese, with only a trace of the guttural tonation of the\n_carioca_, that the most important news items of the day would be\ngiven.\n\nPaula paled a little, but listened without stirring. The voice\nread--the rustling of sheets of paper was abnormally loud--a bit of\nforeign news, and a bit of local news, and then....\n\nShe was deathly pale when the announcement of her father's death was\nfinished, and she had heard the official view of the police\nreported--exactly what Ribiera had told her it would be. When the\nvoice added that a friend of the late Minister of War, the Senhor\nRibiera, had offered twenty contos for the capture of the fugitive\npair, who had escaped in an airplane stolen from him, she bit her lip\nuntil it almost bled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I know,\" he said abstractedly. \"It's as you said. But listen to that\nwhistle.\"\n\nThe news announcement ceased. Music began again. The whistling\nabruptly died away.\n\n\"I just found some coils,\" said Bell feverishly, \"that plug in to take\nthe place of the longer-wave ones. I'm going to try them. It's a\nhunch, and it's crazy, but....\"\n\nThere were sharp clickings. The radio receiver was one of those\nextraordinarily light and portable ones that are made for aircraft. In\nseconds it was transformed into a short-wave receiver. Bell began to\nmanipulate the dials feverishly. Two minutes. Three. Four.\n\nThe speaker suddenly began to whine softly and monotonously.\n\n\"Regeneration,\" said Bell feverishly, \"on a carrier-wave. It can't be\nfar off, that receiving set.\"\n\nSuddenly a voice spoke. It was blurred and guttural. Infinitely\ndelicate adjustments cleared it up. And then....\n\nBell listened eagerly, at first in triumph, then in amazement, and at\nlast in a grim satisfaction. Reports from Rio on a short-wave band of\nradio frequencies were passing from Ribiera to some other place\napparently inland. It was Ribiera's own voice, which quivered with\nrage as he reported Bell's escape.\n\n\"_I do not think_,\" he snapped in Portuguese, \"_that full details\nshould be spoken even on beam wireless. I shall come to the_ fazenda\n_to-morrow and communicate with The Master direct. In the meantime I\nhave warned all sub-deputies in Brazil. I urge that all deputies be\ninformed and instructed as The Master may direct._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother voice replied that The Master would be informed. In the\nmeantime the deputy for Brazil was notified.\n\nThis list of bits of information chilled Bell's blood. This man, of\nVenezuela, had been denied the grace of The Master by the deputy in\nCaracas. He would probably use the passwords and demand the grace of\nThe Master of sub-deputies in the State of Par\u00e1. To be seized and\nCaracas informed. The deputy in Colombia desired that the son of\nColonel Garc\u00eda--upon a hunting-party with friends in the Amazon\nbasin--should be attached to the service of The Master. His father had\nbeen so attached, and it was believed had smuggled a letter into the\nforeign mail warning his son. If possible, that letter should be\nintercepted. And from Paraguay the deputy requested that the family of\nSenor Gomez, visiting relatives in Rio, should be induced to regard\nthe service of The Master as desirable....\n\nThe orders ceased abruptly. Ribiera acknowledged them. The whining\nwhistle cut off. And Bell turned to Paula very grimly indeed.\n\n\"Pretty, isn't it?\" he asked in a vast calmness. \"Apparently every\nnation on the continent has some devil like Ribiera in charge of the\nadministration of this fiendish poison. Every republic has some fiend\nat work in it. And they're organized. My God! They're organized! The\nMaster seems to supply them with the mixture of poison and its\nantidote, and they report to him....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula nodded.\n\n\"That was what my father had written down for you,\" she said quietly.\n\"Any man who can be lured to eat or drink anything these men have\nprepared is lost. He gains no pleasure, as a drug might give. He is\nentrapped into a lifetime of awful fear, knowing that a moment's\ndisobedience, a moment's reluctance to obey whatever command they\ngive, will cause his madness.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to think what we can work out of this,\" said Bell shortly.\n\"Some things are clear. There's a radio receiving set nearby, which\nlistened to those short-wave reports. Within five or six miles, at\nmost. We're going to find that to-morrow. And there's a central point,\na _fazenda_, where one may talk direct with The Master, whoever and\nwherever he may be. And--judging by Ribiera--my guess is that The\nMaster has the same hold upon them that they have on their underlings.\nRibiera is too arrogant a scoundrel to make obsequious reports if he\nwere not afraid to omit them.\" He was silent for a moment, thinking.\nThen he said abruptly, \"Try to get some sleep, if you can. That pistol\nof Ribiera's--you have it handy? Keep it where you can reach it in the\ndark. I'm going to watch, though.\"\n\nPaula settled herself comfortably, and looked queerly across the dimly\nlit little cabin at him.\n\n\"My friend,\" she said with the faintest of quavering smiles, \"Please\ndo not reassure me. I have the courage of endurance, at least. And--I\ndo not fear you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seemed to Bell, listening in the darkness that fell when he turned\noff the switch, that she stayed awake for a long time. But when she\ndid sleep, she slept heavily.\n\nBell had a raft of canes afloat beside the amphibian when she waked.\nHe was sweat-streaked and bitten by many insects. He was tired, and\nhis clothes were rags. But the raft was nearly twenty feet long, it\nwould easily float two persons and what small supplies the plane\ncarried, and it could be handled by a long pole.\n\n\"Hullo,\" he said cheerfully when she climbed on top of the waterlogged\nhull of the plane. \"We're nearly ready to start off. I'm sorry I can't\nadvise you to try to refresh yourself in the river. There are some\nfish in it that are fiends. One of them took a slice out of the side\nof my hand.\"\n\n\"_Piranhas!_\" she exclaimed, and was pale. \"You should have known!\"\n\n_Piranhas_ are small fresh-water fish of the Brazilian rivers, never\nmore than a foot and a half long, which prove the existence of a\ndevil. Where they swarm in schools they will tear every morsel of\nflesh from a swimmer's body as he struggles to reach shore, and leave\na clean-stripped skeleton of a mule or horse if an animal should essay\nto swim a stream.\n\n\"I'll ask, next time,\" said Bell ruefully. \"I'd planned a swim. But if\nyou'll fix some coffee while I finish up this raft, we'll get going. I\ndon't think we're far from some place or other. I heard what sounded\nsuspiciously like a motor boat, about dawn.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked at him anxiously.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Bell, smiling, \"if the boat belonged to whoever\nlistened in on the Rio broadcast _and_ the short-wave news, he won't\nbe especially friendly, though he should be glad to see us. But I've\nbeen studying the map, and I have a rather hopeful idea. Let's have\ncoffee.\"\n\nHe grinned as long as she was in sight, and when he went into the\ncabin of the plane he seemed more cheerful still. But the idea of\nfloating down this nameless little jungle stream upon a raft of canes\nwas not one that he would have chosen. It was forced upon him. To\ntravel through the jungle itself was next to impossible with a girl,\nespecially as they were dressed for city streets and not at all for\nbattling with dense and thorn-studded undergrowth. And to stay with\nthe plane was obviously absurd. Sooner or later they had to abandon\nit, though the moment they did desert it they would be encountering\nnot only the impersonal menace of the jungle, but the actual enmity of\nall the human race. The raft was the only possibility.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt floated smoothly enough when they started off, with Bell working\ninexpertly with his long pole to keep it in mid-stream. He was, of\ncourse, acutely apprehensive. In country like this a rapid could be\nexpected anywhere. The jungle life loomed high above their heads on\neither side, and the life of the jungle went on undisturbed by their\npassage. Monkeys gaped at them and exchanged undoubtedly witty\ncomments upon their appearance. Birds flew overhead with raucous and\nunpleasant cries. Toucans, in particular, made a most discordant din.\nOnce they disturbed a tiny herd of peccaries, drinking, which regarded\nthem pugnaciously and trotted sturdily out of sight as they came\nabreast.\n\nBut for one mile, for two, the stream flowed smoothly. A third.... And\nPaula pointed ahead in silence. A dug-out projected partly from the\nshoreline. Bell wielded his long pole cautiously now, and drew closer\nand ever closer to the stream bank. Paula pointed again. There was\neven a small dock--luxury unthinkable in these wilds.\n\nThe raft touched bottom. And suddenly from somewhere out of sight\nthere came a horrible and a bestial sound. It was a scream of\nblood-lust, of madness, of overpowering and unspeakable rage.\nFollowing it came cackling laughter.\n\nPaula went white.\n\n\"The _fazenda_,\" said Bell softly, \"of the sub-deputy who was\nlistening in on Ribiera last night. And it sounds as if someone were\nvery much amused. Some poor devil....\"\n\nPaula shuddered.\n\n\"I'm going ashore,\" said Bell, smiling frostily. \"There's nothing else\nto do.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCrouched at the edge of the jungle, where the clearing began, Paula\nheard four shots. Two in quick succession, and a wait of minutes. Then\na third, and another long wait, and then the last. Then silence. Paula\nbegan to shiver. Bell had helped her ashore from the raft and insisted\non her waiting at the edge of the jungle.\n\n\"Not that you'll be any safer,\" he had told her grimly, \"but that I\nmay be. One person can move more quickly than two. And if I'm chased\nI'll plunge for the place you're hidden, and you can open fire. Then\nthe two of us might hold them off.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Paula said slowly.\n\nAnd Bell caught at her wrist.\n\n\"Don't let me hear you talk like that!\" he said sharply. \"We're going\nto beat this thing! We've got to! And being desperate helps, but being\nin despair doesn't help a bit. Buck up!\"\n\nHe frowned at her until she smiled.\n\n\"I will not despair again without your permission,\" she told him.\n\"Really. I will not.\"\n\nHe found her a hiding-place and went cautiously out into the clearing,\nstill frowning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had been gone five minutes before the first shot sounded, and quite\nten before the last rang out dully, and was echoed and re-echoed\nhollowly by the jungle trees. And Paula lay waiting by the edge of the\nclearing, Ribiera's pearl-handled automatic in her hand--Bell had\ncarried the rifle from the plane. Small insects moved all about her,\nand she heard soft rustlings as the life of the jungle went on over\nher head and under her feet, and terror welled up in her throat.\n\nShe was trembling almost uncontrollably when Bell came back. He walked\nopenly toward her hiding-place.\n\n\"Paula.\"\n\nShe came out, trying to steady her quivering lips.\n\n\"We're all right,\" said Bell grimly. \"This is the _fazenda_ of a\nsub-deputy. I suspect, also, it's an emergency landing field for\nRibiera on the way to that place he talked to last night. There's a\ntwo-place plane here with both wheels and floats, in a filthy little\nshed. It seems to be all right. We're going to take off in it and try\nto make Moradores, where your people are. What's the matter?\"\n\nHer face was deathly pale.\n\n\"I thought,\" she said with some difficulty, \"when I heard the shots--I\nthought you were killed.\"\n\nBell shook his head.\n\n\"I wasn't,\" he said grimly. \"It was four other men who were killed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe led her carefully past the house. It was a fairly typical _fazenda_\ndwelling, if more substantial than most. It was wholly unpretentious,\nwith whitewashed walls, and the effect of grandeur it would give to\nnatives of this region would come solely from the number of buildings.\nThere were half a dozen or more.\n\n\"I killed four men,\" repeated Bell coldly. \"And I'm damned glad of it.\nThat scream we heard.... I know pretty well what happened here last\nnight. Remember, Ribiera spoke of using a beam-wireless to make his\nreport. He must have had a short-wave beam set somewhere on the\noutskirts of Rio, aimed at whatever headquarters he reports to. He's\ngoing up to that headquarters some time to-day, by plane, of course.\nHe needed emergency landing fields along the route, and here he picked\nout a native and made him a sub-deputy. Charming....\"\n\nMoving past the buildings, Paula caught sight of massive wooden bars\nset in the side of a building. Something crumpled up and limp lay\nbefore them.\n\n\"Don't look over there,\" said Bell harshly. \"There was a woman in this\nhouse and she told me what happened, though I'd guessed it before. The\nsub-deputy was here last night with a party of friends. Newly\nenslaved, some of them. He entertained them.... Up at Ribiera's place\na girl told me she and her husband had been shown a Secret Service\nman. He went mad before their eyes. It was an object-lesson for them,\na clear illustration of what would happen to them if they ever\ndisobeyed. I imagine that something of the sort is used by all The\nMaster's deputies to convince their slaves of the fate that awaits\nthem for disobedience. The local man had brought a party up to watch\ntwo men go mad. After that sight they'll be obedient.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe reached a shed, huge, but in disrepair. Monster doors were ajar.\nBell heaved at them and swung them wide. A small, trim, two-seated\nplane showed in the shadowy interior.\n\n\"This is for emergency use,\" said Bell grimly, \"and we face an\nemergency. I'll get it out and load it up. There's a dump of gas and\nso on here. You might look around outside the door, in case the one\nman who got away can find someone to help stop me.\"\n\nHe set to work checking on fuel and oil. He loaded extra gas in the\nfront cockpit, a huge tin of it. Another would crowd him badly in the\npilot's cockpit in the rear, but he stowed it as carefully as he\ncould.\n\n\"The local sub-deputy,\" he added evenly, \"has added to the thrill by\nhaving the two men put in one cage. He let his guests observe the\nprogress of the madness the damned poison produces. And presently, as\nthe madness grew, the two men fought. They were murder mad. The local\nsub-deputy gave his guests the thrill of watching maniacs battling to\nthe death. He left early this morning with his party, and I imagine\nthat everyone was suitably submissive to his demands for the future.\nThere were four men and a woman left as caretakers here. I found the\nfour men before the cage, baiting the poor devil who'd killed the\nother last night. That's why we heard the scream. When I came up with\nmy rifle they stared at me, and ran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I got one then, and as a matter of mercy I put a bullet through the\nman who'd gone murder mad. The\"--Bell sounded as if he were acutely\nnauseated--\"the man he'd killed was still in the cage. My God!... Then\nI went looking for the other three men. Wasting time, no doubt, but I\nfound them. I was angry. I got one, and the others ran away again. A\nlittle later the third man jumped me with a knife. He slit my sleeve.\nI killed him. Didn't find the fourth man.\" Bell moved to the front of\nthe plane. \"I'll see if she catches.\"\n\nHe swung on the stick. It went over stiffly. Again, and again. With a\nbellow, the motor caught. Bell shouted in Paula's ear.\n\n\"We'll get in. Use the warming-up period to taxi out. We want to get\naway as soon as we can.\"\n\nHe helped her up into the seat, then remembered. He rummaged about and\nflung a tumbled flying suit up in the cockpit with her.\n\n\"If you get a chance, put it on!\" he shouted. He stepped into a\nsimilar outfit, reached up and throttled down the motor, and kicked\naway the blocks under the wheels. He vaulted up into place. And slowly\nand clumsily the trim little ship came lurching and rolling out of the\nshed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe landing field was not large, but Bell took the plane to its edge.\nHe faced it about, and bent below the cockpit combing to avoid the\nslip stream and look at his maps again, brought from the big\namphibian. Something caught his eye. Another radio receiving set.\n\n\"Amphibian planes,\" he muttered, \"for landing on earth or water. And\nradios. I wonder if he has directional for a guide? It would seem\nsensible, and if a plane went down the rest of them would know about\nwhere to look.\"\n\nPaula reached about and touched his shoulder. She pointed. There was a\nmovement at the edge of the jungle and a puff of smoke. A bullet went\nthrough the fusilage of the plane, inches behind Bell. He frowned,\ngrasped the stick, and gave the motor the gun.\n\nIt lifted heavily, like all amphibians, but it soared over the group\nof buildings some twenty or thirty feet above the top of the wireless\nmast and went on, rising steadily, to clear even the topmost trees on\nthe farther side of the stream by a hundred feet or more.\n\nIt went on and on, roaring upward, and the jungle receded ever farther\nbelow it. The horizon drew back and back. At two thousand feet the\nearth began to have the appearance of a shallow platter. At three\nthousand it was a steep sided bowl, and Bell could look down and trace\nthe meandering of the stream on which he had landed the night before.\nNot too far downstream--some fifteen miles, perhaps--were the squalid,\ntoy sized structures of a town of the far interior of Brazil. He never\nlearned its name, but even in his preoccupation with the management\nof the plane and a search for landmarks, he wondered very grimly\nindeed what would be the state of things in that town. If in Rio,\nwhere civilization held sway, Ribiera exercised such despotic though\nsecret power, in a squalid and forgotten little village like this the\nrule of a sub-deputy of The Master could be bestial and horrible\nbeyond belief.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEastward. Bell had overshot the mark the night before. Before he had\nlocated himself he was quite fifty miles beyond the spot Paula had\nsuggested as a hiding place. Now he retraced his way. A peak jutting\nup from far beyond the horizon was a guiding mark. He set the plane's\nnose for it, and relaxed.\n\nThe motor thundered on valorously. Far below was a vast expanse of\nthick jungle, intercepted but nowhere broken by occasional small\nstreams and now and then the tiny, angular things which might be\nhouses. But houses were very infrequent. In the first ten miles--with\na view of twenty miles in every direction--Bell picked out no more\nthan four small groups of buildings which might be the unspeakably\nisolated _fazendas_ of the folk of this region.\n\n\"Ribiera was coming this way,\" he muttered.\n\nHe fumbled the headphone of the radio set into place. The set seemed\nto be already arbitrarily tuned. He turned it on. There was a\nmonotonous series of flashes, with the singing note of a buzzer in\nthem. A radio direction signal.\n\n\"Ribiera's on the way.\"\n\nBell stared far ahead, without reason. And it seemed to him that just\nthen, against that far distant guiding peak, he saw a black speck\nfloating in mid-air.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pulled back the joy stick. Detached, feathery clouds spread across\nthe sky, and he was climbing for them. Paula looked behind at him, and\nhe pointed. He saw her seem to stiffen upon sight of the other\naircraft.\n\nIn minutes Bell's plane was tearing madly through sunlit fleecy\nmonsters which looked soft and warm and alluring, and were cold and\ndamp and blinding in their depths. Bell kept on his course. The two\nplanes were approaching each other at a rate of nearly two hundred\nmiles an hour.\n\nAnd then, while the harsh, discordant notes of the radio signal\nsounded monotonously in his ears, Bell stared down and, through a rift\nbetween two clouds, saw the other plane for an instant, a thousand\nfeet below.\n\nThe sun shone upon it fiercely. Its propeller was a shimmering,\ncobwebby disk before it. It seemed to hang motionless--so short was\nBell's view of it--between earth and sky: a fat glistening body as of\na monstrous insect. Bell could even see figures in its cockpits.\n\nThen it was gone, but Bell felt a curious hatred of the thing. Ribiera\nwas almost certainly in it, headed for the place to which he had\nspoken the night before. And Bell was no longer able to think of\nRibiera with any calmness. He felt a personal, gusty hatred for the\nman and all he stood for.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis face was grim and savage as his own plane sped through the clouds.\nBut just as the two aircraft had approached each other with the\ncombined speed of both, so they separated. It seemed only a moment\nlater that Bell dipped down below the clouds and the other plane was\nvisible only as a swiftly receding mote in the sunlight.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bell coldly to himself, with the thunder of the motor\ncoming through the singing of the air route signal, \"I wonder if he'll\nsee the ship I cracked up last night?\"\n\nPaula was pointing. The shoulder of a hill upthrust beneath the\njungle. The tall trees were cleared away at its crest. Small,\nwhitewashed buildings appeared below.\n\n\"Good landing field,\" said Bell, his eyes narrowing suddenly. \"On the\ndirect route. Fifty miles back there's another landing field. I\nwonder....\"\n\nHe was already suspicious before he flattened out above the house,\nwhile dogs fled madly. He noticed, too, that horses in a corral near\nthe buildings showed no signs of fright. And horses are always afraid\nof landing aircraft, unless they have had much opportunity to grow\naccustomed to them.\n\nThe little plane rolled and bumped, and gradually came to a stop. Bell\ninconspicuously shifted a revolver to the outer pocket of his flying\nsuit. Figures came toward them, with a certain hesitating reluctance\nthat changed Bell's suspicions even while it confirmed them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Paula,\" he said grimly, \"this is another landing field for Ribiera's\nemergency use. It sticks out all over the place. Relatives or no\nrelatives, you want to make sure of them. You understand?\"\n\nHer eyes widened in a sudden startled fear. She caught her breath\nsharply. Then she said quietly, though her voice trembled:\n\n\"I understand. Of course.\"\n\nShe slipped out of the plane and advanced to meet the approaching\nfigures. There were surprised, astounded exclamations: A bearded man\nembraced her and shouted. Women appeared and, after staring, embraced.\nPaula turned to wave her hand reassuringly to Bell, and vanished\ninside the house.\n\nBell looked over his instruments, examined the gas in the tank, and\nbegan to work over his maps in the blaring sunlight. He cut out the\nswitch and the motor stopped with minor hissings of compression. The\nmaps held his attention, though he listened keenly as he worked for\nany signs of trouble that Paula might encounter.\n\nHe was beginning to have a definite idea in his mind. Ribiera had\ntalked to a headquarters somewhere, by beam radio from Rio. Beam\nwireless, of course, is nothing more or less than a concentration of\na radio signal in a nearly straight line, instead of allowing it to\nspread about equally on all sides of the transmitting station. It\nmakes both for secrecy and economy, since nearly all the power used at\nthe sending apparatus is confined to an arc of about three degrees of\na circle. Directed to a given receiving station, receiving outfits to\none side or the other of that path are unable to listen in, and the\nsignal is markedly stronger in the chosen path. Exactly the same\nprocess, of course, is used for radio directional signals, one of\nwhich still buzzed monotonously in Bell's ears until he impatiently\nturned it off. A plane in the path hears the signal. If it does not\nhear the signal, it is demonstrably off the straight route.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell, then, was in a direct line from Rio to the source of a radio\ndirection signal. Fifty miles back, where the big amphibian had\ncrashed, he was in the same air line. To extend that line on into the\ninterior would give the destination of Ribiera, and the location of\nthe headquarters where direct communication with The Master was\nmaintained.\n\nHe worked busily. His maps were in separate sheets, and it took time\nto check the line from Rio. When he had finished, he computed grimly.\n\n\"At a hundred miles in hour....\" He was figuring the maximum distance\nwhich could plausibly be accepted as a day's journeying by air. He\nsurveyed the maps again. \"The plateau of Cuyaba, at a guess. Hm....\nFleets of aircraft could practise there and never be seen. An army\ncould be maneuvered without being reported. Certainly the headquarters\nfor the whole continent could be there. Striking distance of Rio,\nMontevideo, Buenos Aires, La Paz, and Asunci\u00f3n. Five republics.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCertainly, from his figures, it seemed plausible that somewhere up on\nthe Plateau of Cuyaba--where no rails run, no boats ply, and no\ntelegraph line penetrates; which juts out ultimately into that\nunknown region where the Rio Zingu and the Tapajoz have their\norigins--certainly it seemed plausible that there must lie the\nheadquarters of the whole ghastly conspiracy. There, it might be, the\ndeadly plants from which The Master's poison was brewed were grown.\nThere the deadly stuff was measured out and mixed with its temporary\nantidote....\n\nPaula came back, a young man with her. Her eyes were wide and staring,\nas if she had looked upon something vastly worse than death.\n\n\"He--Ribiera,\" she gasped. \"My uncle, he owned this place. They--have\nhim here--alive--and mad! And all the rest....\"\n\nBell fumbled in the pocket of his flying suit. The young man with\nPaula was looking carefully at the plane. And there was a revolver in\na holster at his side. An air of grim and desperate doggedness was\nupon him.\n\n\"This is--my cousin,\" gasped Paula. \"He--and his wife--and--and--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young man took out his weapon. He fired. There was a clanging of\nmetal, the screech of tortured steel. Bell's own revolver went off the\nfraction of a second too late.\n\n\"You may kill me, Senhor,\" said the young man through stiff lips. His\nrevolver had dropped from limp fingers. He pressed the fingers of his\nleft hand upon the place where blood welled out, just above his right\nelbow. \"You may kill me. But if you and my cousin Paula escaped.... I\nhave a wife, Senhor, and my mother, and my children. Kill me if you\nplease. It is your right. But I have seen my father go mad.\" Sweat,\nthe sweat of agony and of shame, came out upon his face. \"I fought\nhim, Senhor, to save the lives of all the rest. And I have spoiled\nyour engine, and I have already sent word that you and Paula are here.\nNot for my own life, but....\"\n\nHe waited, haggard and ashamed and desperate and hopeless. But Bell\nwas staring at the motor of the airplane.\n\n\"Crankcase punctured,\" he said dully. \"Aluminum. The bullet went right\nthrough. We can't fly five miles. And Ribiera knows we're here--or\nwill.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThere was the sound of weeping in the house, the gusty and hopeless\nweeping of women. Bell had been walking around and around the plane,\nstaring at it with his hands clenched. Paula watched him.\n\n\"I am thinking,\" she said in an attempt at courage, \"that you said I\nmust not despair without your permission. But--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Bell impatiently. He stared at the engine. \"I'd give a\nlot for a car. Bolts.... How many hours have we?\"\n\n\"Four,\" said Paula drearily. \"Perhaps five. You have smashed the radio\nin the house?\"\n\nBell nodded impatiently. He had smashed the radio, a marvelously\ncompact and foolproof outfit, arbitrarily tuned to a fixed short\nwave-length. It was almost as simple to operate as a telephone. There\nhad been no opposition to the destruction. Paula's cousin had disabled\ntheir plane and reported their presence. He was inside the house now,\nsick with shame--and yet he would do the same again. In one of the\nrooms of the house, behind strong bars, a man was kept who had been an\nobject-lesson....\n\n\"Is there any machinery?\" asked Bell desperately. \"Any at all about\nthe place?\"\n\nPaula shook her head.\n\n\"It may be that there is a pump.\"\n\nBell went off savagely, hunting it. He came back and dived into the\ncockpit of the plane. He came out with a wrench, and his jaws set\ngrimly. He worked desperately at the pump. He came back with two\nshort, thick bolts.\n\nHe crawled into the plane again, tearing out the fire wall\nimpatiently, getting up under the motor.\n\n\"We have one chance in five thousand,\" he said grimly from there, \"of\ngetting away from here to crash in the jungle. Personally, I prefer\nthat to falling into Ribiera's hands. If your cousin or anybody else\ncomes near us, out here, call me, and I'll be much obliged.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was the sound of scraping, patient, desperate, wholly\nunpromising scraping. It seemed to go on for hours.\n\n\"The wrench, please, Paula.\"\n\nShe passed it to him. The bullet had entered the aluminum crankcase of\nthe motor and pierced it through. By special providence it had not\nstruck the crankshaft, and had partly penetrated the crankcase on the\nother side. Bell had cut it out, first of all. He had two holes in the\ncrankcase, then, through which the cylinder oil had drained away. And\nof all pieces of machinery upon earth, an aircraft motor requires oil.\n\nBell's scraping had been to change the punctured holes of the bullet\ninto cone shaped bores. The aluminum alloy was harder than pure\naluminum, of course, but he had managed it with a knife. Now he fitted\nthe short bolts in the bores, forced the threads on them to cut their\nown grooves, and by main strength screwed them in to a fit. He\ntightened them.\n\nHe came out with his eyes glowing oddly.\n\n\"The vibration will work them loose, sooner or later,\" he observed\ngrimly, \"and they may not be oil tight. Also, the crankshaft may clear\nthem, and it may not. If we go up in the ship in this state we may get\nfive miles away, or five hundred. At any minute it may fail us, and\nsooner or later it will fail us. Are you game to go up, Paula?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe smiled at him.\n\n\"With you, of course.\"\n\nHe began to brush off his hands.\n\n\"There ought to be oil and gas here,\" he said briefly. \"Another thing,\nthere'll probably be some metal chips in the crankcase, which may\nstop an oil line at any minute. It's a form of committing suicide, I\nimagine.\"\n\nHe went off, hunting savagely for the supplies of fuel and lubricant\nwhich would be stored at any emergency field. He found them. He was\npouring gasoline into the tanks before what he was doing was noticed.\nThen there was stunned amazement in the house. When he had the\ncrankcase full of oil the young man came out. Bell tapped his revolver\nsuggestively.\n\n\"With no man about this house,\" he said grimly, \"Ribiera will put in\none of his own choice. And you have a wife and children and they'll be\nat that man's mercy. Don't make me kill you. Ribiera may not blame you\nfor my escape if you tell him everything--and you're hurt, anyway.\nEither we get away, and you do that, or you're killed and we get away\nanyhow.\"\n\nHe toppled two last five gallon tins of gasoline into the\ncockpits--crowding them abominably--and swung on the prop. The engine\ncaught. Bell throttled it down, kicked away the stones with which he\nhad blocked its wheels, and climbed up into the pilot's cockpit. With\nhis revolver ready in his lap he taxied slowly over to a favorable\nstarting point.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship rose slowly, and headed west again. At three thousand feet he\ncut out the motor to shout to Paula.\n\n\"One place is as good as another to us, now. The whole continent is\nclosed to us by now. I'm going to try to find that headquarters and do\nsome damage. Afterwards, we'll see.\"\n\nHe cut in the motor again and flew steadily westward. He rose\ngradually to four thousand feet, to five.... He watched his\ninstruments grimly, the motor temperature especially. There were\nflakes of metal in the oil lines. Twice he saw the motor temperature\nrise to a point that brought the sweat out on his face. And twice he\nsaw it drop again. Bits of shattered metal were in the oiling system,\nand they had partly blocked the stream of lubricant until the engine\nheated badly. And each time the vibration had shifted them, or\nloosened them....\n\nThey had left the big amphibian no earlier than nine o'clock. It was\nnoon when they took off for the _fazenda_ of Paula's kin. But it was\nfive o'clock and after when they rose from there with an engine which\nmight run indefinitely and might stop at any second.\n\nBell did not really expect it to run for a long time. He had worked as\nmuch to cheat Ribiera of the satisfaction of a victory as in hopes of\na real escape. But an hour, and the motor still ran. It was\nconsistently hotter than an aero engine should run. Twice it had gone\nup to a dangerous temperature. One other time it had gone up for a\nminute or more as if the oiling system had failed altogether. But it\nstill ran, and the sun was sinking toward the horizon and shadows were\nlengthening, and Bell began to look almost hopefully for a clearing in\nwhich to land before the dark hours came.\n\nThen it was that he saw the planes that had been sent for him and for\nPaula.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were three of them, fast two-seaters very much like the one he\ndrove. They were droning eastward, with all cockpits filled, from that\nenigmatic point in the west. And Bell had descended to investigate a\nbarely possible stream when they saw him.\n\nThe leader banked steeply and climbed upward toward him. The others\ngazed, swung sharply, and came after him, spreading out as they came.\nAnd Bell, after one instant's grim debate, went into a maple leaf dive\nfor the jungle below him. The others dived madly in his wake. He heard\na sharp, tearing rattle. A machine-gun. He saw the streaks of tracers\ngoing very wide. Gunfire in the air is far from accurate. A\nmachine-gun burst from a hundred yards, when the gun has to be aimed\nby turning the whole madly vibrating ship, is less accurate than a\nrifle at six hundred, or even eight. Most aircraft duels are settled\nat distances of less than a hundred yards.\n\nIt was that fact that Bell counted on. With a motor that might go dead\nat any instant and a load of passengers and gas at least equaling that\nof any of the other ships, mere flight promised little. The other\nships, too, were armed, at any rate the leader was, and Bell had only\nsmall arms at his disposal. But a plane pilot, stunting madly to dodge\ntracer bullets, has little time to spare for revolver work.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell had but one advantage. He expected to be killed. He looked upon\nboth Paula and himself as very probably dead already. And he\ninfinitely preferred the clean death of a crash to either the life or\ndeath that Ribiera would offer them. He flattened out barely twenty\nyards above the waving branches that are the roof of the jungle. He\nwent scudding over the tree tops, rising where the jungle rose,\ndipping where it dropped, and behind him the foliage waved wildly as\nif in a cyclone.\n\nThe other planes dared not follow. To dive upon him meant too much\nchance of a dash into the entrapping branches. One plane, indeed, did\ntry it, and Bell scudded lower and lower until the wheels of the small\nplane were spinning from occasional, breath taking contacts with the\nfeathery topmost branches of jungle giants. That other plane flattened\nout not less than a hundred feet farther up and three hundred yards\nbehind. To fire on him with a fixed gun meant a dive to bring the gun\nmuzzle down. And a dive meant a crash.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA stream flashed past below. There was the glitter of water,\nreflecting the graying sky. A downward current here dragged at the\nwings of the plane. Bell jerked at the stick and her nose came up.\nThere was a clashing, despite her climbing angle, of branches upon the\nrunning gear, but she broke through and shot upward, trying to stall.\nBell flung her down again into his mad careering.\n\nIt was not exactly safe, of course. It was practically a form of\nsuicide. But Bell had not death, but life to fear. He could afford to\nbe far more reckless than any man who desired to live. The plane went\nscuttling madly across the jungle tops, now rising to skim the top of\na monster _ceiba_, now dipping deliberately.\n\nThe three pursuing planes hung on above him helplessly while the\nshort, short twilight of the tropics fell, and Bell went racing across\nthe jungle, never twenty feet above the tree top and with the boughs\nbehind him showing all the agitation of a miniature hurricane. As\ndarkness deepened, the race became more suicidal still, and there were\nno lighted fields nearby to mark a landing place. But as darkness grew\nmore intense, Bell could dare to rise to fifty, then a hundred feet\nabove the tops, and the dangers of diving to his level remained\nundiminished. And then it was dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell climbed to two hundred feet. To two hundred and fifty. With more\nfreedom, now, he could take one hand from the controls. He could feel\nthe menace of the tumultuously roaring motors in his wake, but he was\nsmiling very strangely in the blackness. He reached inside his flying\nsuit and tore away the front of his shirt. He reached down and\nbattered in the top of one of the five gallon gasoline tins in the\ncockpit with the barrel of his revolver. He stuffed the scrap of cloth\ninto the rent. It was wetted instantly by the splashing. Another\nsavage blow, unheard in the thunder of the motor. In the peculiarly\ncalm air of the cockpit the reek of gasoline was strong, but cleared\naway. And Bell, with the frosty grim smile of a man who gambles with\nhis life, struck a light. The cloth flared wildly, and he reached his\nhands into the flame and heaved the tin of fuel overside.\n\nThe cloth was burning fiercely, and spilled gasoline caught in\nmid-air. A fierce and savage flame dropped earthward. Spark on the\ncloth, and the cloud of inflammable vapor that formed where the\nleaking tin fell plummetlike, carried the flame down when the wind of\nits fall would have blown it out.\n\nThe following planes saw a flash of light. They saw a swiftly\ndescending conflagration tracing a steep arch toward the tree tops.\nThey saw that flaming vanish among the trees. And then they saw a vast\nupflaring of fire below. Flames licked upward almost to the tree\ntops....\n\nBell looked back from two thousand feet. Wing-tip lights were on,\nbelow, and disks of illumination played upon the roof of the jungle\nabove the fire. The three planes were hovering over the spot. But a\nthick dense column of smoke was rising, now. Green things shriveling\nin the heat, and dried and rotted underbrush. Altogether, the volume\nof smoke and flame was very convincing evidence that an airplane had\nburst into flame in mid-air and crashed through the jungle top to burn\nto ashes beneath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Bell climbed steadily to five thousand feet. He cut out the motor,\nthere, and in the shrieking and whistling of wind as the plane went\ninto a shallow glide, he spoke sharply.\n\n\"Paula?\"\n\n\"I am all right,\" she assured him unsteadily. \"What now?\"\n\n\"There's a seat pack under you,\" said Bell. \"It's a parachute. You'd\nbetter put it on. God only knows where we'll land, but if the motor\nstops we'll jump together. And I think we'll have to jump before dawn.\nThis plane won't fly indefinitely. There's just one chance in a\nmillion that I know of. There'll be a moon before long. When it comes\nup, look for the glitter of moonlight on water. With the wing-tip\nlights we may--we may--manage to get down. But I doubt it.\"\n\nHe moved his hand to cut in the motor again. She stopped him.\n\n\"If we head south,\" she said unsteadily, \"we may reach the Paraguay.\nIt is perhaps two hundred miles, but it is broad. We should see it.\nPerhaps even the stars....\"\n\n\"Good work!\" said Bell approvingly. \"_Nils desperandum!_ That's our\nmotto, Paula.\"\n\nHe swung off his course and headed south. He was flying high, now, and\nan illogical and incomprehensible hope came to him. There was no hope,\nof course. He had had, more than once, a despairing conviction that\nthe utmost result of all his efforts would be but the delaying of\ntheir final enslavement to The Master, whose apparent impersonality\nmade him the more terrible as he remained mysterious. So far they\nseemed like struggling flies in some colossal web, freeing themselves\nfrom one snaring spot to blunder helplessly into another.\n\nBut the moon came up presently, rounded and nearly full. The sky took\non a new radiance, and the jungle below them was made darker and more\nhorrible by the contrast.\n\nAnd when there were broad stretches of moonlit foliage visible on the\nrising slopes beneath, Bell felt the engine faltering. He switched on\nthe instrument board light. One glance, and he was cold all over. The\nmotor was hot. Hotter than it had ever been. The oil lines, perhaps\nthe pump itself....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula's hand reached back into the glow of the instrument board. He\nleaned over and saw her pointing. Moonlight on rolling water, far\nbelow. He dived for it, steeply. The wing-lights went on. Faint disks\nof light appeared far below, sweeping to and fro with the swaying of\nthe plane, bobbing back and forth.\n\nIt seemed to Bell that there had been nothing quite as horrible as\nthe next minute or two. He felt the over-heated, maltreated motor\nlaboring. It was being ruined, of course--and a ruined motor meant\nthat they were marooned in the jungle. But if it kept going only until\nthey landed. And if it did not....\n\nWhite water showed below in the disks of the landing lights' glow. It\ntumbled down a swift and deadly _raudal_--a rapid. And then--black,\ndeep water, moving swiftly between tall cliffs of trees.\n\nBell risked everything to bank about and land toward the white water.\nThe little plane seemed to be sinking into a canyon as the trees rose\noverhead on either side. But the moonlit rapid gave him his height,\napproximately, and the lights helped more than a little.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe landed with a terrific crash. The plane teetered on the very verge\nof a dive beneath the surface. Bell jerked back the stick and killed\nthe engine, and it settled back.\n\nA vast, a colossal silence succeeded the deafening noise of twelve\ncylinders exploding continuously. There were little hissing sounds as\nthe motor cooled. There was the smell of burnt oil.\n\n\"All right, Paula?\" asked Bell quietly.\n\n\"I--I'm all right.\"\n\nThe plane was drifting backward, now. It spun around in a stately\nfashion, its tail caught in underbrush, and it swung back. It drifted\npast cliffs of darkness for a long time, and grounded, presently, with\na surprising gentleness.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Bell dryly, \"this sort of thing is getting\nmonotonous. I think our motor's ruined. I never knew before that\nmisfortunes could grow literally tedious. I've been expecting to be\nkilled any minute since we started off, but the idea of being stuck in\nthe jungle with a perfectly good plane and a bad motor....\"\n\nHe fished inside his flying suit and extracted a cigarette. Then he\nlit it.\n\n\"Let's see.... We haven't a thing to eat, have we?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a little slapping noise. Bell became suddenly aware of a\nhorde of insects swarming around him. Smoke served partially to drive\nthem off.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said suddenly, \"we could unfold a parachute and cover\nthe cockpits for some protection against these infernal things that\nare biting me.\"\n\n\"We may need the parachute,\" said Paula unsteadily. \"Does--does that\nsmoke of yours drive them away?\"\n\n\"A little.\" Bell hesitated. \"I say, it would be crowded, but if I came\nup there, or you here....\"\n\n\"I--I'll come back there,\" she said queerly. \"The extra cans of\ngasoline here....\"\n\nShe slipped over the partition, in the odd flying suit which looks so\nmuch more odd when a girl wears it. She settled down beside him, and\nhe tried painstakingly to envelope her in a cloud of tobacco smoke.\nThe plague of insects lessened.\n\nThere was nothing to do but wait for dawn. She was very quiet, but as\nthe moon rose higher he saw that her eyes were open. The night noises\nof the jungle all about them came to their ears. Furtive little\nslitherings, and the sound of things drinking greedily at the water's\nedge, and once or twice peculiar little despairing small animal cries\noff in the darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe jungle was dark and sinister, and all the more so when the moon\nrose high and lightened its face and left them looking into weird,\nabysmal blackness between moonlit branches. Bell thought busily,\ntrying not to become too conscious of the small warm body beside him.\n\nHe moved, suddenly, and found her fingers closed tightly on the sleeve\nof his flying suit.\n\n\"Frightened, Paula?\" he asked quietly. \"Don't be. We'll make out.\"\n\nShe shook her head and looked up at him, drawing away as if to scan\nhis face more closely.\n\n\"I am thinking,\" she said almost harshly, \"of biology. I wonder--\"\n\nBell waited. He felt an intolerable strain in her tensed figure. He\nput his hand comfortingly over hers. And, astoundingly, he found it\ntrembling.\n\n\"Are all women fools?\" she demanded in a desperate cynicism. \"Are we\nall imbeciles? Are--\"\n\nBell's pulse pounded suddenly. He smiled.\n\n\"Not unless men are imbeciles too,\" he said dryly. \"We've been through\na lot in the past two days. It's natural that we should like each\nother. We've worked together rather well. I--well\"--his smile was\ndistinctly a wry and uncomfortable one--\"I've been the more anxious to\nget to some civilized place where The Master hasn't a deputy\nbecause--well--it wouldn't be fair to talk about loving you while--\"\nhe shrugged, and said curtly, \"while you had no choice but to listen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stared at him, there in the moonlight with the jungle moving about\nits business of life and death about them. And very, very slowly the\ntenseness left her figure. And very, very slowly she smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she said quietly, \"you are lying to me, Charles. Perhaps.\nBut it is a very honorable thing for you to say. I am not ashamed,\nnow, of feeling that I wish to be always near you.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Bell. He put his arm about her shoulder and drew her\ncloser to him. He tilted her face upward. It was oval and quite\nirresistibly pretty. \"I love you,\" said Bell steadily. \"I've been\nfighting it since God knows when, and I'm going to keep on fighting\nit--and it's no use. I'm going to keep on loving you until I die.\"\n\nHer fingers closed tightly upon his. Bell kissed her.\n\n\"Now,\" he said gruffly, \"go to sleep.\"\n\nHe pressed her head upon his shoulder and kept it there. After a long\ntime she slept. He stirred, much later, and she opened her eyes again.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Damn these mosquitos,\" growled Bell. \"I can't keep them off your\nface!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nFor four hours after sunrise Bell worked desperately. With the few and\ninadequate tools in the plane he took apart the oiling system of the\nmotor. It was in duplicate, of course, like all modern air engines,\nand there were three magnetos, and double spark plugs. Bell drained\nthe crankcase beneath a sun that grew more and more hot and\nblistering, catching the oil in a gasoline can that he was able to\nempty into the main tanks. He washed out innumerable small oil pipes\nwith gasoline, and flushed out the crankcase itself, and had at the\nend of his working as many small scraps of metal as would half fill a\nthimble. He showed then to Paula.\n\n\"And the stars in their courses fought against Sisera,\" he quoted\ndryly. \"Any one of these, caught in just the right place, would have\nlet us down into the jungle last night.\"\n\nShe smiled up at him.\n\n\"But they didn't.\"\n\n\"No.... God loves the Irish,\" said Bell. \"What's that thing?\"\n\nPaula was fishing, sitting on a fallen tree in the cloud of smoke from\na smudge fire Bell had built for her. She was wearing the oily flying\nsuit he had found in the shed with the plane, and had torn strips from\nher discarded dress to make a fishing line. The hook was made out of\nthe stiff wire handle of one of the extra gasoline tins. \"Hook and\nleader in one,\" Bell had observed when he made it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was pointing to a flat bodied fish with incredible jaws that lay on\nthe grass, emitting strange sounds even in the air. It flapped about\nmadly. Its jaws closed upon a stick nearly half an inch thick, and cut\nit through.\n\n\"It is a _piranha_,\" said Paula. \"The same fish that bit your hand. It\ncan bite through a copper wire fastened to a hook, but this hook is so\nlong....\"\n\n\"Pleasant,\" said Bell. Something large and red passed before his eyes.\nHe struck at it instinctively.\n\n\"Don't!\" said Paula sharply.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It's a _maribundi_ wasp,\" she told him \"And its sting.... Children\nhave died of it. A strong man will be ill for days from one single\nsting.\"\n\n\"Still more pleasant,\" said Bell. \"The jungle is a charming place,\nisn't it?\" He wiped the sweat off his face. \"Any more little pets\nabout?\"\n\nShe looked about seriously.\n\n\"There.\" She pointed to a sapling not far distant. \"The _palo santo_\nyonder has a hollow trunk, and in it there are usually ants, which are\ncalled fire-ants. They bite horribly. It feels like a drop of molten\nmetal on your flesh. And it festers afterwards. And there is a fly,\nthe _berni_ fly, which lays its eggs in living flesh. The maggot eats\nits way within. I do not know much about the jungle, but my father\nhas--had a _fazenda_ in Matto Grosso and I was there as a child. The\n_camaradas_ told me much about the jungle, then.\"\n\nBell winced, and sat down beside her. She had Ribiera's pearl handled\nautomatic within easy reach. She saw him looking at it.\n\n\"I do not think there is any danger,\" she said with a not very\nconvincing smile, \"but there are _cururus_--water snakes. They grow\nvery large.\"\n\n\"And I asked you to fish!\" said Bell. \"Stop it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe hauled the line ashore, with a flapping thing on the end of it.\nBell took the fish off and regarded her catch moodily.\n\n\"I'd been thinking,\" he said moodily, \"that Ribiera suspects we're\ndead. I'd been envisioning ourselves as marooned, yes, but relatively\nsafe as long as we were thought to be dead. And I'd thought that if we\nlived a sort of castaway existence for a few weeks we'd be forgotten,\nand would have a faint chance of getting out to civilization without\nbeing noticed. But this....\"\n\n\"I will stay,\" she said steadily. \"I will stay anywhere or go\nanywhere, with you.\"\n\nBell's hand closed on her shoulder.\n\n\"I believe it,\" he said heavily. \"And--if you noticed--I had been\nthinking of letting down the Trade. I'd been thinking of not trying to\nfight The Master any longer, but only of getting you to safety. In a\nsense, I was thinking of treason to my job and my government. I\nsuspect\"--he smiled rather queerly--\"I suspect we love each other\nrather much, Paula. I'd never have dreamed for anyone else. Go over to\nthe plane and don't fish any more. I'll rustle the food for both of\nus.\"\n\nShe stood up obediently, smiling at him.\n\n\"But kill that _piranha_ before you try to handle it,\" she advised\nseriously.\n\nBell battered the savage thing until it ceased to move. He picked it\nup, then, and sniffed the air. Paula had been in a cloud of acrid\nsmoke. She could not have detected the taint in the air he discovered.\nHe went curiously, saw a broken branch overhead, and then saw\nsomething on the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe came back to the plane presently, looking rather sick.\n\n\"Give me one of the machetes, Paula,\" he said quietly. \"We brought\nthem, I think.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\nHe took the wide-bladed woods knife.\n\n\"A man,\" he said, nauseated. \"He either fell or was thrown from\nsomewhere high above. From a plane. He was United States Secret\nService. There's a badge in his clothes. Don't come.\"\n\nHe went heavily over to the spot beyond the smudge fire. He worked\nthere for half an hour. When he came back there were earth stains on\nhis hands and clothing, and he carried a very small brown package in\nhis hand.\n\n\"He had a report ready to send off,\" said Bell grimly. \"I read it.\nIt's in code, of course, but in the Trade....\"\n\nHe set to work savagely on the engine, reassembling it. As he worked,\nhe talked in savage, jerky sentences.\n\n\"The Service man at Asunci\u00f3n. One of the seven who vanished. He'd\nlearned more than we have. He was caught--poisoned, of course--and\npretended to surrender. Told a great deal that he shouldn't, in order\nto convince The Master's deputy. The key men in nearly every republic\nin South America are in The Master's power. Paraguay belongs to him,\nbody and soul. Bolivia is absolutely his. Every man of the official\nclass from the President down knows that he has two weeks or less of\nsanity if The Master's deputy shuts down on him--and he knows that at\nthe crook of the deputy's finger he'll be assassinated before then. If\nthey run away, they go murder mad. If they stay, they have to obey\nhim. It's hellish!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stopped talking to make a fine adjustment. He went on, somberly.\n\n\"Chile's not so bad off, but the deputy has slaves nearly everywhere.\nEcuador--well, the President and half of Congress have been poisoned.\nThe man I found was trying to get a sample of the poison for analysis.\nHe'd learned it was unstable. Wouldn't keep. The Master has to send\nfresh supplies constantly all over the continent. That accounts for\nthe deputies remaining loyal. If The Master had reason to suspect\nthem, he had only to stop their supply.... They couldn't stock up on\nthe deadly stuff for their own use. So they're as abjectly subject to\nThe Master as their slaves are to them. No new slaves are to be made\nin Paraguay or Bolivia, except when necessary. It's believed that in\nsix months the other republics will have every influential man\nsubjected. Every army officer, every judge, every politician, every\noutstanding rich man.... And then, overnight, South America will\nbecome an empire, with that devil of a Master as its overlord.\"\n\nHe lifted one of the oil pumps in place and painstakingly tightened\nthe bolts that held it.\n\n\"Picture it,\" he said grimly. \"Beasts as viceroys, already taking\ntheir pleasure. Caligulas, Neros, on viceregal thrones all over the\ncontinent.... And every man who shows promise, or shows signs of honor\nor courage or decency, either killed or sent mad or....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula was watching his face closely.\n\n\"I think,\" she said soberly, \"that there is something worse.\"\n\nBell was silent for an instant.\n\n\"For me,\" he said bitterly, \"it is. Before The Master dares to make\nhis coup public, he must be sure that there will be no foreign\ninterference. So, he must establish a deputy in Washington. A\nrelatively few chosen men, completely enslaved, could hold back our\nGovernment from any action. Leaders in Congress, and members of the\nCabinet, working, in defense of The Master because his defeat would\nmean their madness.... He would demand no treason of them at first. He\nwould require simply that he should not be interfered with. But his\nplans include the appointment of deputies in the United States later\non. I don't think he can subdue America. I don't think so. But he\ncould--and I think he would--send whole cities mad. And if you think\nof that....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was silent, working. A long, long time later he swung on the\npropeller. The motor caught. He throttled it down and watched it\ngrimly. The motor warmed up to normal, and stayed there.\n\n\"It will run,\" he said coldly. \"Those two plugs in the crankcase may\ncome out at any time. I've tightened them a little. They'd worked\nloose from the vibration. But--well.... That Service man was heading\nfor Asunci\u00f3n. He'd been found out. They probably shot him down in\nmid-air after he'd gotten away. His plane may be crashed anywhere in\nthe jungle within a mile or so. And I've two bearings on the _fazenda_\nwhere Ribiera went, now. One from Asunci\u00f3n through here and one from\nRio. I want to go back there to-night and dump burning gasoline on the\nbuildings, to do enough damage to disorganize things a little. Then\nI'm going to try to make it to a seaport. We can stow away, perhaps.\"\n\nHe shut off the motor.\n\n\"We'll start at dusk. There'll be lights there. This report says it's\nnearly a city--of slaves. We want the darkness for our getaway.\"\n\nPaula looked at the sky.\n\n\"We have three hours,\" she said quietly. \"Let us cook and eat. You\nmust keep up your strength, Charles.\"\n\nShe said it in all seriousness, with the air of one who has entire\nconfidence and is merely solicitous. And Bell, who knew of at least\nthree excellent reasons why neither of them should survive until\ndawn--Bell looked at her queerly, and then grinned, and then took her\nin his arms and kissed her. She seemed to like it.\n\nAnd they lunched quite happily on _piranha_ and _pacu_--which is\nsmaller--and drank water, and for dessert had more _piranha_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe long afternoon wore away slowly. It was hot, and grew blistering.\nInsects came in swarms and tormented them until Bell built a second\nand larger smudge fire. But they fastened upon his flesh when he went\nout of its smoke for more wood.\n\nThey talked, as well as they could for smoke, and looked at each other\nas well as they could for smarting eyes. It was not at all the\nconventional idea of romantic conversation, but it was probably a good\ndeal more honest than most, because they both knew quite well that\ntheir chance of life was small. A plane whose motor was precariously\npatched, flying over a jungle without hope of a safe landing if that\npatched-up motor died, was bad enough. But with the three nearest\nnations subservient to The Master, whose deputy Ribiera was, and all\nthose nations hunting them as soon as they were known to be yet\nalive....\n\n\"Would it not be wise, Charles,\" asked Paula wistfully, \"just for us\nto try to escape, ourselves, and not try--\"\n\n\"Wise, perhaps,\" admitted Bell, \"but I've got to strike a blow while I\ncan.\" He was staring somberly at the little plane, fast upon a mud\nbank, with the tall green jungle all about. \"The deputies and all\ntheir slaves have their lives hanging by a thread--the thread of a\nconstant supply of the antidote to the poison that's administered with\nthe antidote. The deputies--Ribiera, for instance--don't realize that.\nElse they wouldn't dare do the things they do. But let them realize\nthat the thread can be broken, and what their slaves would do to them\nbefore they all went mad.... You see? Let them learn that a blow has\nbeen struck at the center of all the ghastly thing, and they'll be\nfrightened. They'll be close to mutiny through sheer panic. And there\nmay be slip-ups.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was vague, perhaps, but it was true. The subjection of the poisoned\nmen and women was due not only to terror of what would happen if they\ndisobeyed the deputies, but to a belief that that thing would not\nhappen if they did obey. If Bell could do enough damage to the\n_fazenda_ of The Master to shake the second belief, he would have\nshaken the whole conspiracy. And a conspiracy that is not a complete\nsuccess is an utter failure.\n\nIt was close to sunset when they heard a droning noise in the\ndistance. Bell went swiftly to the cockpit of the plane and searched\nthe sky.\n\n\"Don't see it,\" he said grimly, \"and it probably doesn't see us. We're\nall right, I suppose.\"\n\nBut he was uneasy. The droning noise grew to a maximum and slowly died\naway again. It diminished to a distant muttering.\n\n\"What say,\" said Bell suddenly, \"we get aloft now? We'll follow that\ndamned thing home. It's going from Asunci\u00f3n to that place we want to\nfind. This is on that route. Whoever's in it won't be looking behind,\nand it's close to darkness.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula stood up.\n\n\"I am ready, Charles.\"\n\nBell swung out on the floats and tugged at the prop. The motor caught\nand roared steadily. While it was warming up, he stripped off the rest\nof his shirt and tore it into wide strips, and tied the rags in the\nhandles of the gasoline tins in the two cockpits.\n\n\"For our bombs,\" he explained, smiling faintly. \"You'll want to wear\nyour chute pack, Paula. You know how to work it? And we'll divide the\nguns and what shells we have, and stick them in the flying suit\npockets.\"\n\nHe made her show him a dozen times that she knew how to pull out the\nring that would cause the parachute to open. She climbed into the\nfront cockpit and smiled down at him. He throttled down the motor to\nits lowest speed and shoved off from the mud bank. Clambering up,\nwhile the plane moved slowly over the water under the gentle pull of\nthe slow-moving propeller, he bent over and kissed her.\n\n\"For luck,\" he said in her ear.\n\nThe next instant he settled down at the controls, glanced a last time\nat the instruments, and gave the motor the gun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plane lifted soggily but steadily and swept up-stream toward the\nrolling water of the _raudal_, which tumbled furiously about an\nobstacle half of stones and shallows, and half of caught and rotting\ntree trunks. It rose steadily until the trees dropped away on either\nside and the jungle spread out on every hand. It rose to a thousand\nfeet and went roaring through the air to northward, while Bell\nstrained his eyes for the plane on ahead.\n\nIt was ten minutes or more before he sighted it, winging its way\nsteadily into the misty distance above the jungle. Bell settled down\nto follow. The engine roared valorously. For half an hour Bell watched\nit anxiously, but it remained cool and had always ample power. Paula's\nhead showed above the cockpit combing. Mostly she looked confidently\nahead, but once or twice she turned about to smile at him.\n\nThe sun seemed high when they rose from the water, but as it neared\nthe horizon its rate of descent seemed to increase. They had been in\nthe air for no more than three-quarters of an hour when it was twice\nits own disk above the far distant hills. Almost immediately, it\nseemed, it had halved that distance. And then the lower limb of the\nblaring circle was sharply cut off by the hill crests and the sun sank\nwearily to rest behind the edge of the world.\n\nIt seemed as if a swift chill breeze blew over the jungle, in warning\nof the night. The trees became dark. A shadowy dusk filled the air\neven up to where the plane flew thunderously on. And then, quite\nabruptly, stars were shining and it was night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell remembered, suddenly, and switched on the radio as an experiment.\nThe harsh, discordant dashes sounded in his ears through the roaring\nof the motor. A beam of short waves was being sent out from his\ndestination. While he was on the direct path the monotonous signals\ncould be heard. When they weakened or died he would have left the way.\n\nBut they continued, discordant and harsh and monotonous, while the\nlast faint trace of the afterglow died away and night was complete,\nand a roof of many stars glittered overhead, and the jungle lay dark\nand deadly below him.\n\nFor nearly half an hour more he kept on. Twice he switched on the\ninstrument board light to glance at the motor temperature. The first\ntime it appeared a little high. The second time it was normal again.\nBut there was little use in watching instruments. If the motor failed\nthere was no landing field to make for.\n\nA sudden faint glow sprang into being, many miles ahead. The pinkish\nglare of many, many lights turned on suddenly. As the plane thundered\non the glow grew brighter. An illuminated field, for the convenience\nof messengers who carried the poison for The Master to all the nations\nwhich were to be subjected.\n\nThe glow went out as Bell was just able to distinguish long rows of\ntwinkling bulbs, and he saw the harsher, fiercer glow of floodlights.\nHe reached forward and touched Paula's shoulder. Conversation was\nimpossible over the motor's roar. Her hand reached up and pressed his.\n\nThen he saw other lights. Bright lights, as from houses. Arc lights as\nfrom storage warehouses, or something of the sort. A long, long row of\nlighted windows, which might be dormitories or perhaps sheds in which\nThe Master's enslaved secretaries kept the record of his victims.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe earth flung back the roaring of the little plane's motor. Bell had\nbut little time to act before other planes would dart upward to seek\nhim out. He dived, and the wing tip landing lights went on, sending\nfierce glares downward. Twin disks of light appeared upon the earth.\nSheds, houses, a long row of shacks as if for laborers. A drying\nfield, on which were spread out plants with their leaves turning\nbrown. A wall about it....\n\n\"The damned stuff,\" said Bell grimly.\n\nHe swept on. Jungle, only jungle. He banked steeply as lights flicked\non and off below and as--once--the wing tip lights showed men running\nfrantically two hundred feet below.\n\nThen a stream of fire shot earthward, and Bell held up his hand and\narm into the blast of the slip stream. It blew out the blaze that had\nlicked at his flesh. He stared down. The gas can had left a trailing\nstream of fluid behind it as it went spinning down to earth. All that\nstream of inflammable stuff was aflame. The can itself struck earth\nand seemed to explode, and the trailing mass of fire was borne onward\nby the wind and lay across a row of thatch-roofed buildings. An\nincredible sheet of fire spread out. The stuff in the drying yard was\nburning.\n\nBell laughed shortly, and flung over another of his flaming bombs, and\nanother, and the fourth....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe climbed for the skies, then, as rectangles of light showed below\nand planes were thrust out of their lighted hangars. Four huge\nconflagrations were begun. One was close by a monster rounded tank,\nand Bell watched with glistening eyes as it crept closer. Suddenly--it\nseemed suddenly, but it must have been minutes later--flame rushed up\nthe sides of that tank, there was a sudden hollow booming, and fire\nwas flung broadcast in a blazing, pouring flood.\n\n\"Their fuel tank!\" said Bell, his eyes gleaming in the ruddy light\nfrom below. He shut off his landing lights and went upward, steeply.\n\"I've played hell with them now!\"\n\nA thousand feet up. Two thousand. Two thousand five hundred.... And\nsuddenly Bell felt cold all over. The instrument board! The motor was\nhot. Hot! Burning!\n\nHe shut it off before it could burst into flames, but he heard the\nsquealing of tortured, unlubricated metal grinding to a stop. He\nleveled out. It was strangely, terribly silent in the high darkness,\ndespite the roaring of wind about the gliding plane. The absence of\nthe motor roar was the thing that made it horrible.\n\n\"Paula,\" said Bell harshly, \"one of those plugs came out, I guess. The\nmotor's ruined. Dead. The ship's going to crash. Ready with your\nparachute?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was dark, up there, save for the glare of fires upon the under\nsurface of the wings. But he saw her hand, encarmined by that glare,\nupon the combing of the cockpit. A moment later her face. She turned,\nlight-dazzled, to smile back at him.\n\n\"All right, Charles.\" Her voice quavered a little, but it was very\nbrave. \"I'm ready. You're coming, too?\"\n\n\"I'm coming,\" said Bell grimly. Below them was the city of The Master,\nset blazing by their doing. If their chutes were seen descending....\nAnd if they were not.... \"Count ten,\" said Bell hoarsely, \"and pull\nout the ring. I'll be right after you.\"\n\nHe saw the slim little black-clad figure drop, plummetlike, and prayed\nin an agony of fear. Then a sudden blooming thing hid it from sight.\nThick clouds of smoke lay over the lights and fires below.\n\nBell stepped over the side and went hurtling down toward the earth in\nhis turn.\n\n(_To be continued_)\n\n[Advertisement: ]\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavern World\n\n_By James P. Olsen_\n\n[Illustration: _He aimed it, and the Thing gripping him was hurled\nback upon the others._]\n\n[Sidenote: A great oil field had gone dry--and Asher, trapped far\nunder the earth among the revolting Petrolia, learns why.]\n\n\n\"Impossible! What sort of creatures would they be, that could live two\nmiles beneath the surface of the earth? Surely, Asher, you are\njoking!\"\n\nR. Briggs Johns, mighty power back of Stan-America Oil Corporation,\nlooked at Blaine Asher closely, expecting to see the chief geologist\nand scientist of the company laugh. But Blaine Asher did not laugh.\nSerious, his rather thin face grave as he leaned his tall, muscular\nbody above a torsion machine he was adjusting, there was nothing to\nindicate he had the faintest idea of a joke.\n\n\"Why damn it, Asher!\" Johns insisted wrathfully, \"you don't really\nmean that. And\"--he took a nervous turn around the laboratory--\"if\nsuch a wild thing were possible, what has that to do with our trouble?\nYou haven't led me on to spend a million dollars drilling a\nthirty-six-inch hole, just so you could test a fantastic theory?\"\n\n\"You know better than that.\" Asher wiped his hands and leaned against\na table. Johns, looking into the cool gray eyes of the man before him,\ndid know better. Blaine Asher was more than just a geologist or\nscientist. Well he might be termed a master geo-metallurgist. Johns\nnodded, wiping beads of perspiration from his brow.\n\n\"You say impossible--and want to know how those creatures cause this\nfield, the largest oil field in the world, to start going bone dry\nover night. All right:\n\n\"Remember how you laughed when I told you that oil would some day be\nmined instead of pumped or flowed from the earth? You couldn't see how\none central shaft could be sunk, then tunnels run back underneath the\noil strata, tapping the sand from the bottom and letting the oil run\ndown to be pumped out one shaft. Yet, that way, we would get _all_ the\noil, instead of the possible one-eighth of the total amount as we get\nby present methods.\n\n\"Now, you have seen that done. And you said that was impossible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes,\" Johns objected, \"but those test wells we mined were only a few\nhundred feet deep. Wells in this field are eight thousand feet deep!\nThink of the heat, man! You can't do it. And as for people--\"\n\n\"Your great field has suddenly gone dry, almost in a month's time,\"\nAsher stopped him. \"What is happening here can happen elsewhere. Only,\nformations in this field are more suited to there being life--or\nsomething--below us. Stan-America is going broke. Many others have\nalready gone broke. Still, that oil couldn't have gotten away.\n\n\"As for heat--yes, we know that oil is hot when it comes up from the\noil sand at eight thousand feet, or from ordinary wells at three to\nsix thousand feet. But\"--Asher lit a cigarette and inhaled\ndeeply--\"gas coming out of the same well is _cold_! So cold it forms\nfrost inches thick on pipes and tanks.\n\n\"Rock pressure--the pressure of the earth--forcing up the gas, causes\nthat. Why couldn't that same pressure cool great caverns below the\ngranite cap below the oil sands? It could. For that matter, I know\nthat same pressure will generate useful power. I'll show you that in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"All right!\" Johns chewed his cigar almost savagely. \"Say, then, that\nyou can work down there, nearly two miles underground; granted that we\ncan tunnel from beneath the sands and pump more oil from one central\nshaft than we now do from fifty wells--what has that to do with this\ntosh about a race of people?\"\n\n\"They are not people, perhaps.\" Asher grinned at the \"there, I've\nstuck you!\" look on Johns' face. \"Let's say, rather, creatures. Have\nyou ever met Lee Wong, the great Chinese scientist, or his Russian\ngeological collaborator, Krenski? No?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, I have. I met them in Paris in 1935--five years ago. They're\nbrilliant men, and they've prepared some wonderful papers. Brilliant,\nI said: they are also dangerous. They claim, you know, that the\nfossils we now drill up come from a lost race--people who went _into_\nthe earth while man, like us, was coming up onto the earth from the\nwater. Some claim those fossils have been on the surface at one time,\nand were silted over. But eight thousand feet is a lot of silt, Johns:\never thought of that?\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Johns gasped hoarsely. \"You almost make me believe you are\nright. But, supposing there is such a race of things--what will you\ndo?\"\n\n\"This.\" Asher drew back a curtain that was stretched across one end of\nthe laboratory. \"You know I was working on a cage in which to descend\ninto that eight-thousand-foot well you've drilled--the well you're\ngoing to use to try and find why this field is suddenly gone dry. This\nit it.\"\n\nJohns stared, shook his head wonderingly and stared again. Before him,\nready to be transported to the well that was larger than any ever\ndrilled before, stood what Blaine Asher called his Miner, for want of\na better name.\n\nA thick steel tube, it was. Twelve feet long and large enough around\nthat a man might stand inside of it. The top was welded on in much the\nmanner a top is welded on an ordinary hot-water heater, and had\nconnections for hose in it. At the height of a man's eyes heavy\nwindows were set in, and in one side was a door just large enough to\nadmit a man's body. This door sealed tight the minute it closed.\n\n\"It looks like--like some sort of a deep sea diving outfit,\" Johns\nsaid as he walked around the braces that held the Miner upright. \"But\nall those gadgets inside and on the bottom--?\" He indicated the\nstrange instruments that could be seen when the door was opened, and\nthe queer glass tubes that projected from the very bottom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pressure-power units--my own invention,\" Asher told him. \"For ten\nyears I've been working on this. I knew that some day I would want to\nexplore the oil caverns beneath the earth, so I made ready.\n\n\"As I told you, rock pressure, or earth pressure, is a tremendous\nthing. It is power, so I figured how to use it. Under artificial\npressure, I have tried out my Miner and its equipment.\n\n\"Those tubes sticking from the bottom contain something you are\nfamiliar with: non-burning and non-explosive helium gas. I have\ndiscovered a way, by their use, to create power that will melt away\nrock or iron--literally dissolve it into nothing! Not in an hour, or\nminutes. In seconds, Johns!\n\n\"The pressure of the earth acts as my generator. The pressure action\non the filaments of platinum, and several compositions I have no time\nto explain now, causes heat. Call it friction of compressed air, if\nyou wish. As neon gases carry an electric spark, so does this helium\ncarry the power generated by earth pressure. The pressure below earth\nacts on the delicate coils and points of my generator. This bit of\npower is carried into the helium tubes, and by a system of vacuum\npower, is increased millions of times. Thus, the tiny spark of a cigar\nlighter would electrocute a hundred men!\"\n\n\"I--you mean somewhat like a violet ray is increased in the lightning\ntubes?\" Johns strove to grasp the foundation of the thing.\n\n\"Yes, the foundation of it all--with the earth's pressure the power\nmotive,\" Asher nodded. \"So, after my Miner is on the bottom of our\nwell, I can burn--or dissolve--a room as large as this laboratory in a\nfew minutes. The whole thing is no mystery after you learn it--not\nnearly so much as radium, or radio, was. Merely creating a spark of\nelectricity and fanning it through a vacuum and a conductor of massed\ngases.\"\n\n\"But\"--Johns had unconsciously dropped his voice to a whisper--\"what\nof these strange creatures? How would you deal with them? Damn it,\nAsher, I think I'm beginning to believe this nutty idea of yours. Any\nman who can generate power with the pressure of air as it is packed by\nearth must know what he is talking about!\"\n\n\"I have but one protection against anything down there that tries to\nharm me,\" Asher said simply. \"That is this--see?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat he held up looked like an old-fashioned six shooter. It was\nfitted with a platinum-sealed box in the place where a cylinder would\nhave been. The barrel looked like some queer, blue glass.\n\n\"Do you see that test tube?\" Asher pointed to a glass tube on a table\na few feet away. \"Now watch.\"\n\nHe pressed a tiny ratchet under his thumb. A snapping, buzzing noise\nfilled the laboratory. Johns gave an exclamation of wonder and awe.\nQuickly, the test tube started to melt into a pool of molten glass.\nAsher increased the pressure of his ratchet trigger. The tube was\nknocked to the floor.\n\n\"Static electricity--always some form of electricity,\" said Asher\ngrinning at the astonished oil baron. \"Conductor coils here,\" he\ncontinued as he tapped the sealed cylinder, \"are charged much as a\nflash-lamp battery. The charged conductors attract the static\nelectricity of the air, and, in a manner similar to the action of the\npower generator, increase power. There is a slight difference: by\nturning quick power on my static gun, I can cause the charge to knock\ndown and merely electrocute, as I knocked the half-melted tube from\nthe table.\"\n\n\"I can understand that, a little,\" Johns sighed profoundly. \"It's the\nsame juice that causes a gasoline truck to catch fire if you don't\nhave a ground chain on it somewhere. But, just the same, I claim it's\nremarkable.\"\n\n\"Not half as remarkable as what I expect to find two miles down when I\ndescend to-morrow.\" Asher had a dreamy look in his eyes. \"I wonder:\nnew ways to get petroleum wealth ... a strange people....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Men,\"--Asher, a tight-fitting asbestos composition suit covering him\nfrom foot to neck, spoke tersely--\"when you get me on bottom, stop\nevery bit of machinery, and don't dare pull up until I give the\nsignal. If I'm down there the entire day, all right. But\"--he smiled,\ntrying to make light of the danger--\"if I don't signal within\nthirty-six hours, pull up anyhow.\"\n\nFrom the bull-wheels of the drilling rig Asher spooled out some of the\nair-hose cable through which air blown over ice would be pumped into\nthe Miner; then when the long steel cylinder was over the hole and\nready, he turned to the company officials and government scientists\nand engineers around him in the boarded-up derrick.\n\n\"Possibly I can get a survey in an hour. Perhaps I'll have to come\nback to the surface and make adjustments to my equipment. That remains\nto be seen.... Now, let's get low.\"\n\nHe adjusted a helmet over his head. It looked much like the helmet\nworn by a sea diver, except that it had no connecting hose for air.\nThe windows in the helmet, which contained pressure lights, worked on\nthe same principle as the disintegrating rays of the Miner. When Asher\nturned the ratchet that set the little pressure machine into motion, a\nviolet tinged green ray of great lighting power shot out and\nincreased, by weight of air, or atmosphere beneath the earth, the\npower of one tiny spark a million times.\n\nWithout ceremony or farewell, Asher crawled inside his tube. The door\nwas closed and he fastened it from inside. For a moment, wild panic\nassailed him. But he fought it off, becoming again less the feeling\nhuman and more the cold calculator of advanced science. The light from\noutside, coming in through the windows of the Miner, was shut off. The\nlong steel cage clanked against the sides of the special casing in the\nwell, and Blaine Asher was on his trip into a lower world never before\nvisited by man.\n\nThat was what Asher believed. But, had he known what waited for him,\ntwo miles into the bowels of the earth....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt five hundred feet, the descent stopped, giving him time to adjust\nhimself to the pressure change. The gas and oil had been eased out of\nthe hole. That is, the casing had been run on through the producing\nstrata, shutting it off. Asher signaled by buzzer, and a stream of the\nice-washed air flowed down to him.\n\nThree thousand feet! Six thousand feet! More than a mile down! Sweat\npoured from his body in streams, and the air coming into the Miner\nthrough the hose did not relieve him. It was hot--almost unbearably\nso. His ears were roaring. The dark of his tube was relieved as he\nturned on his pressure lamps. He adjusted the pressure discs over his\nears by twisting a thumbscrew on his helmet, and the pounding of his\near-drums ceased.\n\nGasping, he watched the depth meter in front of him. It did not seem\nas if he was moving, but the indicator now showed more than seven\nthousand feet. It moved around slowly and more slowly; trembled at\neight thousand--and stopped.\n\nLike the snapping of a man's fingers, the temperature inside the Miner\nchanged. Asher was now fifty feet below the bottom of the oil and gas\nsands, and if his theory about rock pressure worked.... It _was_\nworking. Frost was forming on the inside of the Miner!\n\n\"I'm right--right--right!\" Asher thought, elated, sending his buzzer\nsignal up to those so far above. The icy air through his hose changed\nto air of normal temperature. He signaled for slack in the lowering\ncable, then prepared for the greatest test of all.\n\nCramped, with hardly room to move, he studied his gages. Helium tubes\nat the proper pressure for compressing the tiny spark of the pressure\ngenerator, so it would flare a million times stronger under the action\nof the vacuum tubes: diamond and cut-glass tubes in the bottom of the\nMiner, thermoed with layers of quicksilver: everything cleared,\neverything ready.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hand shaking, Asher pushed the tiny switch that brought his\nfilament points trembling together under the atmospheric pressure so\nfar underground. A tiny spark danced and throbbed through the tiny\nglass tube before him, beginning to buzz as it started the circuit of\nincreasing coils, and soon humming and vibrating as the helium and\nvacuum tubes swelled it to full power. Spark after spark, increased\nalmost beyond imagination, followed one after another. The Miner\nthrobbed and shook.\n\nWhite-faced, Asher touched the little lever that opened the blasting\noutlets in the bottom. Almost instantly the Miner dropped a full six\ninches--went on, down to a foot. Asher, pride of success choking him,\npulled the lever hard over, which brought some of the tubes beneath\nhim spreading out, to blast away the earth on each side of him.\n\nHe signaled for more and more slack as the depth indicator showed he\nhad burned, or disintegrated, his way down to thirty feet beyond the\noriginal bottom of the hole. He was below the bottom of the protecting\nwall of casing now--at the mercy of the pressure of two miles of\nearth.\n\nSlowly, setting all his bottom tubes to cutting away on all sides of\nhim, he started hollowing out enough room to step out into. His\nlights, when he looked through the windows, showed ghostly on earth\nten feet on each side of him. Ten more minutes and he had created a\nroom nearly twenty-five feet square--a man-made cave, two miles below\nthe surface.\n\nThere was something akin to awe in the feelings of Asher when he\nopened the little door, crawled out and stood erect. The pressure\nlamps in his helmet lit up the room he had made. There were no sounds,\njust a vague, ringing silence.\n\nThen so quickly that it robbed him of his senses, two things happened.\nA hundred yards away from the well in which he had descended, another\nwell, drilled by another oil company, was shot. Three hundred quarts\nof nitro-glycerine were set off in the hole.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAsher screamed and clamped his ear discs down tight. It seemed the\nvery gods of thunder were shrieking and raging in his head; every\nnerve and fiber in his body throbbed and tingled with the hellish\nvibration.\n\nOn his knees, where the shock had thrown him, in darkness beyond\ndescription, Asher realized the lights from the Miner no longer shone\nout. Frantically, he adjusted the small lights in his helmet and got\nthem to sending off their rays again. Then, an icy hand seemed to\nsqueeze his heart, turning his blood to ice-water in his veins. He\ncursed himself for not foreseeing that some company might shoot a well\nclose by, while he was underground.\n\nHe turned. The Miner was all right, but Blaine Asher was trapped! For\nthe walls of the hole below the bottom of the casing had caved. Thirty\nfeet of rock, sand and conglomerate matter were between him and the\nbottom of the pipe.\n\nHe was trapped--two miles below the earth. There was no hope of\nrescue, the hope that miners feel in deep shafts. There could be no\nrescue for Asher. No one could get to him. He cried out his horror,\nfighting to keep from swooning.\n\nThe helmet hampered him. He turned on a small pressure lamp attached\nto the belt at his waist, and chanced taking the helmet off. Dank and\nnauseous was the air that he breathed, since it no longer came through\nthe filters in his helmet. But it was air that would serve,\nnevertheless.\n\nA crackling, rumbling sound caused him to turn quickly. Eyes wide, he\nstared at the long crack that was opening before him.\n\nAsher was between two layers of granite--one layer under him, and\nanother above him, just below the oil sands. Now, as the crack between\nthese two layers widened, he could see it slope downward until it\nended in a great cavern that stretched endlessly away beyond the beams\nof his light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt wasn't this crack that caused Blaine Asher, an iron-hearted man of\nscience, to choke and sag down to a sitting position, his knees\nrefusing to support him. No--it was the terrible, Godless,\nunbelievable _Things_ that scurried around in the smooth rock hall\nthat stretched away into the cavern.\n\nFrozen with soul-chilling fear, Asher stared with eyes that bulged.\nWhat were they? Spawned neither of God nor Satan--what could they be?\nBlack-skinned--or was it skin?--like rubber, with round bodies, like\nblack basket balls inflated to triple size; bodies that seemed to\nripple, distort, swell and contract with life within life.\n\nShort, foot-long stems that must have been legs, ending in round balls\nthat served as feet, no doubt. Tentacles, Asher would have called\nthem, six feet in length, thick as mighty cables and dotted with\nsuckers like the tentacles of an octopus. And heads--Asher gagged and\nvomited!\n\nNot heads. Just masses of the black body substance as large as the two\nfists of a man. In each head was a crooked black gash for a mouth.\nThere were no eyes that Asher could see. Yet, these Things seemed to\nsee one another, and emitted strange, chill, squeaking sounds!\n\nAs Asher watched, the Things sensed his presence. A half hundred of\nthem rose and started toward him. They did not walk, nor did they\ncrawl. Undulating, contorting strangely, they came on with incredible\nspeed, long tentacles waving before them; slithering on the rocky\nfloor of the cavern; making those odd squeaking noises.\n\nAs they neared him, Asher sprang to his feet, backing up against the\npile of cavings beside the Miner. A long tentacle whipped out and\nwrapped around his leg. A short, snout-tentacle quivered toward his\nface. There was strength beyond imagining in the grip on him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith an almost animal snarl the man from the earth's surface moved to\nprotect himself from these creatures, surely of the lowest living\norder. He grabbed into the pocket of his loose asbestos composition\nsuit, and his fingers closed comfortingly around the static gun.\n\nHe aimed it, and the Thing gripping him was hurled back upon the\nothers. Crackling, snapping viciously, the charges of electricity that\nwere drawn from the very earth increased in the gun and spumed out\nlike lightning bolts. The Things squeaked excitedly and surged\nforward. Asher's finger pulled the ratchet trigger full force, and\nlike dew before a strong shaft of sunlight, the gruesome Things were\nknocked away.\n\nHating the sight, Asher changed the charge of his gun, cutting the\nsize of the path the volts covered, thereby increasing the potency of\nthe discharge. The piled bodies sizzled, and to Asher's nose came a\nsulphurous smell. Then, there was nothing at all....\n\nSick, he put the gun back into the deep pocket and leaned on the wall.\nHe turned around again to the pile of cavings that barred his way from\nthe surface, and dug like a madman with his bare hands. The Miner was\nweighed down, and he could not use it anyhow. The blasting tubes were\non the bottom, and could not be shifted to the top.\n\nSuddenly he stopped his crazed work, raised his head and listened. \"My\nGod!\" he gasped hoarsely, \"am I stark mad?\" He thought he must be, for\nthe voice of a human being came to his ears.\n\n\"You will be pleased, Blaine Asher, to turn around! And do not make\nany foolish moves, I warn you.\"\n\n\"Lee Wong! Krenski!\" Asher turned, face to face with the\nsuper-scientists of whom he had spoken to R. Briggs Johns the day\nbefore. Asher shook his head. More of the terrible dream, this meeting\ntwo humans down in the earth's core.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Most right, honorable Asher.\" Lee Wong bowed mockingly. He and\nKrenski were garbed in loose-fitting garments of much the same style\nas Asher. In their hands, they carried static guns. Not the small gun,\nsuch as Asher had concealed in his pocket. More like heavy air drills,\nthey were.\n\nAsher frowned at the lamps they carried. He knew by the dazzling\naction of the rays that they were pressure lamps. But they gave off\nmuch better light than those of his own invention. They had gone him\none better there.\n\n\"Did--did you see them?\" Asher gulped. \"And how--how did you get down\nhere? Tell me!\" He took a step toward Lee Wong, intending to lay his\nhand on the Chinaman, to make sure he was live flesh and blood, and\nnot a figment of his disordered brain.\n\n\"Stand where you are!\" Lee Wong snapped. He held the heavy static gun\nup and Asher felt a light charge tingle his body. \"Those Things of\nwhich you speak--I assume you mean the Petrolia. Ah, yes, we see them.\nEvery day, we see them. For us they work. They work, my dear Blaine\nAsher, tapping upward into the oil sands; sands that are burial places\nof countless millions of generations of Petrolia; of lost races that\nonce ruled supreme over these underground worlds.\n\n\"How simple, to take the oil from below--the oil you want so much\nabove. Someone must do the work. I and Krenski found the Petrolia\nready and willing. Being creatures of feeling, with little sense, we\nwere able to bend their dying wills to do our work. You see, we made\nthem feel we would save them, a dying race, from extinction! They do\nour bidding.\"\n\nAsher was bewildered by the enormity of the thing. \"You mean these\nThings you have called Petrolia actually work for you? And that you\nsaved them from becoming extinct?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Exactly,\" Lee Wong nodded, seeming to be enjoying himself. \"Like\nhumans of the surface, Petrolia live on the dead. I mean, wherever we\nget our living food from the earth, we plant our dead back in that\nearth. Petrolia are spawned in beds of petroleum. Just as eels seek\ndeep water to lay their eggs, so do Petrolia go to the oil strata to\nspawn future tribes.\n\n\"When we pump out the oil, they have no--shall we say\n\"hatching?\"--beds. But now, by tapping and bringing down the oil, we\nhave assured them more spawning pits. They will increase, and we have\nmade them sense it. For that matter, the very oil they breed in, gives\nthem sustenance. That is why they are black fleshed and blooded, and\nhave suckers instead of mouths, as a black man is black through ages\nbeneath hot suns.\n\n\"It's easy for us, who are wiser than other men, to figure what\noilfield might contain such people. We have a rapid elevator\nconnecting us to the surface. And--\"\n\n\"Then,\" Asher almost shouted, \"I'm not trapped!\"\n\n\"No?\" Lee Wong wrinkled his forehead quizzically. \"You should realize\nthat we cannot allow you to go back to the surface--alive, or any\nother way. We intend to increase the Petrolia, spreading them to other\nunderground, yet uninhabited worlds. You would spoil that.\n\n\"No, you will never return to the surface. They cannot haul your tube\nto the top, so they will think you perished in it. And\"--Lee Wong\nshrugged--\"it might have been better if you had, Mr.--\"\n\n\"_I wouldn't!_\" the yellow man snarled. He rolled the ratchet of his\nstatic gun and Asher was hurled to the floor by the heavy shock.\nWisely, he stood up, keeping his hands well away from the pocket in\nwhich his own gun rested. He doubted whether his little static gun\ncould compete with the guns of the others, but it was something. They\nhad not thought to search him--perhaps they might not. It was his only\nhope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLee Wong bowed low again, motioning Asher to go ahead. \"Now you shall\nsee what we have done. We are proud, and we know you can appreciate\nour workings. You will be glad to learn why we do as we are doing; you\nwill be intrigued as a fellow scientist. Then, so sad to say, you must\nperish for having gained that very knowledge.\"\n\nAsher shrugged, and through half-closed lids he eyed Lee Wong and the\nrather small, slender Krenski, of the high brow and large head. Then\nhe walked ahead of them. Head up, shoulders back, he walked carelessly\ndown the wide hall--a hall that led into the main cavern of that\nunderground empire.\n\nIt was large--fully a hundred feet in a rough square. Not fifteen feet\nfrom floor to ceiling at any point, it followed the course of the two\nlayers of granite between which it was sandwiched. Other long halls,\nor crevices, ran in every direction out of this main cavern. In the\nwalls, in niches and cracks, the superior pressure lamps had been\nplaced, throwing a bright, eery light over it all.\n\nAsher recoiled suddenly at the sight of hundreds of Petrolia that\nswarmed the hallways, and they seemed to sense another presence beside\nthat of Lee Wong or Krenski. A choked, gurgling sound came from the\nChinaman, and they disappeared down the halls, squeaking angrily as\nthey went.\n\n\"Our control room,\" explained Lee Wong waving his hand about him. He\npointed to a dozen twenty-four inch pipe-lines that ran along the low\nceiling, coming from as many different halls into the room, but all\ngoing out the same large hall, larger than the rest. \"There are the\narteries of our system. There is the oil that is so--shall we say\nstrangely?--missing in your wells.\" He smiled, a taunting, mocking\nlight in his eyes.\n\n\"You well understand how we do it. Above us, just below the oil\nstrata, is a steel, trough-shaped roof. The oil, tapped from below,\ndrains into these, and then into these pipe-lines. If we were working\nfrom above, now, we would run it to a central shaft, and pump it out.\nWe do not want it on the surface, however.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Then why in the name of hell do you want it?\" Asher barked, a tense\nnote of anger in his voice. \"And what do you do with it?\" These two\nwere humans. At least, they were in man-form, if not in feeling. And\nthe Petrolia could be handled. Asher was getting mad, and his fear\nebbed.\n\n\"Come.\" Lee Wong led the way under the pipe-lines, down the large\nhall. Krenski, his heavy static gun ready, walked at Asher's back.\nThey came out into another cavern that stretched beyond the powerful\nlights. The sound of their voices echoed like thunder of the drums of\nThor, and Asher realized this cavern might stretch away in Stygian\nblackness for hundreds of miles.\n\nAsher marveled, for the floor of this cavern dropped at least five\nfeet below the level of the control room or incoming hallways, forming\na natural reservoir. A reservoir for the big streams of oil that were\npouring into it from the pipe-lines.\n\nThe rumble of the oil as it came in and splashed out in a never-ending\nstream, and the rumble of the oil streams above them as the precious\nfluid flowed down into the plated drain roof, sounded like the tramp\nof the weary feet of the damned, as it echoed back and forth across\nthe mighty cavern.\n\n\"Our storage.\" Lee Wong stood at the edge and explained. \"Also, as you\nmay see, a concentration incubator, or spawning bed and food storage\nfor our Petrolia.\"\n\nBlaine Asher looked again at the rippling oil at his feet. He choked\nbrokenly and stepped back a pace. For the oil near the bank was alive!\nIt rippled and splashed, teeming with life. By the strange alchemy of\nbreeding in oil and living on oil as man lives on bread, that lake of\noil was a mass of growing Petrolia. Millions--yes, countless\nbillions--of them! Hideous, foul Things that would be turned loose\nwith the rest in that nightmare world--that would be taken to other\nburied worlds to start new races.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But why--why?\" Asher almost screamed the words at Lee Wong.\n\n\"Petrolia will be our armies, protecting our underground wealth,\" Lee\nWong answered him. \"They will be our faithful workers, under no\ncommand but mine. For, even Krenski has not mastered the over-control\nit takes to handle them!\n\n\"Gradually, as happened to the field we are now under, all oil fields\nwill go dry. We will be getting the oil from below, and putting it in\nstorage in mother earth. Think, Blaine Asher, what it will mean!\"\nThere was a fanatical light in Lee Wong's beady eyes.\n\n\"A world without petroleum is a world without power. No oil for fuel;\nno gasoline, lubricants or by-products of any sort. No airplanes could\nfly; tanks, tractors, oil-burning trains and ships; mechanical\nappliances--nothing could run. We now take the oil from America.\nLater, when our Petrolia have increased and we have devised means of\nmoving them, we will go to all oil-producing countries.\n\n\"We will secrete the oil and paralyze the world. Now, in Russia and\nChina and India, our societies are organizing and growing. They will\nhandle the weakened, powerless nations, and I shall be ruler of the\nuniverse, surface and beneath, with Krenski to aid me, you see. It it\nwonderful, is it not? And, knowing what you do, having seen what you\nhave, could you call it impossible?\"\n\nBlaine Asher groaned. It was not impossible, he knew. Unreal;\nmonstrous--but never impossible. A region of hideous Petrolia; a world\nstripped of automotive and mechanical power, its fuel held in the\nhands of a few, far underground--it was terrible to think of.\n\nAnd Asher the only one who knew. The only one who could avert such a\nthing. The fate of an entire world was in his hands. And he would soon\ndie.\n\nDie? No! Blaine Asher swore silently to himself that no power in\nexistence should keep him from destroying these two fiends. It had to\nbe done!\n\nHe dared not fail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Wonderful, stupendous thing,\" he forced himself to smile. \"I'd like\nto grasp the hand of the genius who devised and carried out such a\nwonderful thing.\"\n\nHe took a step toward Lee Wong, right hand extended, his left slipping\ntoward the pocket where his own static gun rested.\n\nLee Wong extended his own right band. Something in the chill, flint\nlook of Asher's eyes must have warned him. Even as Asher's fingers\nclosed around his hand, he tried to jerk back.\n\n\"Destroy him!\" he cried out to Krenski.\n\nAsher dropped to one knee, letting his static gun remain in his\npocket. His left hand closed around Lee Wong's wrist as the Oriental\ntried to pull away. Krenski was bringing the heavy, cylinderlike gun\nup and aiming it at Asher.\n\nAsher twisted on one knee, his teeth gritted, braced to receive the\nshock from the gun. He jerked Lee Wong's arm down, heaved and came to\nhis feet. Crying out, arms and legs flailing, the Chinaman catapulted\ntoward Krenski--and just at the instant Krenski fired!\n\nThe sickening smell of cindered flesh was in Asher's nostrils as he\nturned and ran back up the main hallway. He glanced back over his\nshoulder as he ran, and shuddered at the black mass lying at Krenski's\nfeet. Lee Wong was no more. Wide-eyed, the Russian stared at the thing\nat his feet. Then, with a fiendish shriek, turned and brought the gun\ninto line on the fleeing Asher.\n\nA crackling charge of electricity singed the back of Asher's head as\nhe dove head first around the corner of the hall into the control\ncavern. He reasoned that Krenski had sent a full charge after him, and\nhope kindled higher in his breast. For Asher believed his smaller\nstatic weapon was as strong as that of the other. At that, it would be\na test, and Asher dared not take chances.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe crouched in the door of another hallway, waiting. Cursing, Krenski\ndashed into the control cavern. Asher brought his gun up and fired.\nBut even as he pulled the trigger, a long tentacle reached from the\ndark crevice behind him and jerked his arm. His charge snapped by the\nRussian, warning the other that Asher, too, was dealing with powerful\nelectric rays that meant death should they touch.\n\nAsher yielded to the tug of the slimy, sulphur-smelling tentacle,\nletting it pull him into the crevice, the charges of Krenski's weapon\ncrackling by him, leaving his skin dry, and a powdery sensation in his\nmouth.\n\nIn the shelter of the crevice, Asher turned his gun upon the Petrolia\nthat gripped him. The tentacles fell away, fading to nothingness\nbefore the charges that showed quivery blue in the dark. Like\ncatacombs, one crevice opened into another. Asher darted into the next\ncrevice and edged cautiously toward the control cavern.\n\nThe angry buzzing and snapping of Krenski's weapon caused him to duck\ninstinctively, although no deadly charges came his way.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" he heard the Russian's high-pitched voice, agonized,\nwailing, \"they're coming in--they're coming in!\"\n\nA squeaking and slithering, now greater than ever, rose above all\nother sounds. And Asher realized what Krenski meant. Lee Wong had said\nthat only he could control the Petrolia. They were swarming into the\ncontrol room now. That was what Krenski was shooting at.\n\nThe squeaking sounds came up the crevice in which Asher was and a\ncold, clammy sweat broke out all over him. He could blast a thousand\nof them into nothing. But by sheer force, more body than his light\nstatic gun could down, they would overwhelm him.\n\nHis mind raced swiftly. He remembered the location, out in the control\nroom, of the cage elevator that ran to the surface. It had not been\nhurt by the glycerine blast that had trapped Asher. The elevator shaft\nfrom the control room was cased clear into the cavern floor, and the\nblast had not jarred this far.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wheeled and sent another charge of static electricity into the\ncrevice back of him, then lunged out into the control room. It would\nbe his own weapon against Krenski's, and a chance to gain the bottom\nof the shaft.\n\nKrenski--piled, charred heaps of the Petrolia around him, which had\nmomentarily cleared the attack--was running across the control room.\nLike a seething wave, the foul Petrolia undulated from every crevice\nand hallway, coming in to fresh attack. The Russian, terror lending\nhim speed, raced for the cage at the foot of the shaft that led to the\nsurface. At the same time Asher ran out.\n\nNearly a hundred feet apart, on opposite sides of the cavern, they\nstopped. Krenski turned his heavy weapon toward Asher at the same time\nAsher sent his own gun crackling and snapping out blue, fiery flame.\n\nSide-stepping, now crouching, now dodging to this side and that, they\nfought their strange duel. Asher's right arm was burned, his hair\nsinged from his head, and his body jarred again and again as Krenski\ntouched him. Krenski, groaning through gritted teeth, suffered burns\nall over his chest and left leg.\n\nAs the Petrolia came on, and the lightning play of deadly electric\ncharges continued, Asher made a discovery. He noticed that the rays,\nor charges, of the two guns, when they met in mid-air, caused blue\nflame, and that the charge went no farther.\n\nIt did it again. The two charges met, crackled to explosion in the\nair. Krenski, too, noticed it, and he also noticed that the Petrolia\nwere almost upon them again. Coming on in a wave that could not be\nhurled back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked at Asher, and met the dare in Asher's eyes. Straight at each\nother, neither moving, they shot their static charges. Neither would\nmove: it was a challenge from Asher that Krenski had to meet. One of\nthem would have to die before the other would be able to gain the cage\nin the shaft. There could be no compromise, and only one man at a time\ncould go surfaceward. If they continued to dodge and fight, the\nPetrolia would overwhelm them.\n\nPower against power, they fought it out.\n\nAsher's finger tightened on his trigger release until it seemed the\nskin would split; then he caused his hand to tremble just enough to\nmake his electric charges cover the space in which Krenski's charges\ntraveled. Hissing, spitting, flashing explosions, giving off sounds\nand light like big explosions of flash powder, the charges met.\n\nAsher tingled from head to foot, and thrilled to the very marvel of\nthe thing. Two deadly beams of electricity, holding each other off!\n\nIn one long, continuous flash, the contact point of the charges began\nto shift. Closer and closer, as the force of superior charges cleaved\nthrough the other, the contact points neared Krenski. He saw death\nupon him, for in another instant, Asher's charges would hurl his own\nbolts back upon him. The smaller weapon of Blaine Asher, attracting\nmore static electric currents by reason of having a small attracting\nbattery inside, where the larger gun of the other depended upon\nmagnets for attraction, was triumphing.\n\nKrenski's mustache and light beard singed and curled. He cried out,\nstepped back, throwing up his arms as death flashed through his body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis gun playing about him, Asher raced toward the big valves and gates\nthat shut off the drain of the pipe-lines. Burning, reeking of sulphur\nand burned leather, the Petrolia vanished before him. But, as he\nturned, the drainage system that was robbing the field shut off. They\nhad blocked his way again!\n\nToo many to blast away altogether, they pressed in. Asher leaped\nforward, feet kicking, left fist smashing out, static gun crackling as\nif to tell him that nothing could stop them. Tentacles gripped at him,\nthe foul, stinking smell gagged him. But the squeaks of the Petrolia\nmaddened him.\n\n\"Squeak, damn you!\" Asher shouted wildly, kicking, shooting and\nhitting, gaining toward the shaft. \"Squeak--for all the damned Things\nthat ever bred below the earth cannot stop one surface man!\"\n\nHe burned and fought his way through and jumped into the cage as his\ngun electrocuted two of the Petrolia that tried to weave in after him.\nAs he slammed the door, Asher was conscious that something was\nhappening. He hesitated, just long enough to see the cavern start\nbuckling and caving. The pressure of the oil, now shut off, was\nfilling back toward the surface, creating a mighty pressure downward.\nThe surface wells would produce man's power-fuel once more.\n\nAsher slammed the door, turned on the power, and the cage shot upward.\n\nA half hour later, those waiting on the floor of the derrick above the\nhole in which Asher had gone down, started. Asher, burned, wounded,\nblood streaming from his battered body, staggered in and collapsed at\ntheir feet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I can't believe it! Insane! Impossible! Yet, every well in this field\nhas started producing again! And when we went to that old, abandoned\nwildcat well, we found the shaft opening! I had it covered up, as you\nordered.\"\n\nR. Briggs Johns paced up and down the laboratory floor, talking to\nAsher, who had just arisen from his bed, two weeks after he had\ncollapsed at their feet in the derrick. Still bandaged, he was a\ndifferent Blaine Asher. His face was lined, and the hair next to his\nscalp nearly snow white.\n\n\"I'll be able to do some walking around outside in a few days,\" Asher\ndeclared as he cleaned a test tube and placed it in a rack. \"I can\nlocate several wells over that underground storage cavern, and you can\nrecover that oil. But you can't mine this field.\n\n\"Twenty years, perhaps, and you can. But it will take that long for\nthose Petrolia to die out. We've got to get the oil out from below to\na point where they can no longer spawn. We will apply mining in other\nfields--but not here!\"\n\n\"Not here,\" Johns repeated, shuddering.\n\n\"It's up to you to see no one else tries it.\" Asher lit a cigarette\nand nodded at Johns. \"Get control of the field--anything. Tell the oil\nmen something. But don't tell then the truth. They wouldn't believe\nyou. They would call you raving mad.\n\n\"The world does not know. It would not believe. Can we do other than\nremain silent?\"\n\nR. Briggs Johns, sick of thinking of the cavern world and horrible\nthings below them, knew they could not.\n\n\n\n\nBrigands of the Moon\n\n(The Book of Gregg Haljan)\n\nCONCLUSION OF A FOUR PART NOVEL.\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n_The First Encounters_\n\n[Illustration: Like feathers we were blown with it.]\n\n[Sidenote: The besieged Earth-men wage grim, ultra-scientific war with\nMartian bandits in a last great struggle for their radium-ore--and\ntheir lives.]\n\n\nIt seemed, with that first shot from the enemy, that a great relief\ncame to me--an apprehension fallen away. We had anticipated this\nmoment for so long, dreaded it. I think all our men felt it. A shout\nwent up:\n\n\"Harmless!\"\n\nIt was not that. But our building withstood it better than I had\nfeared. It was a flash from a large electronic projector mounted on\nthe deck of the brigand ship. It stabbed up from the shadows across\nthe valley at the foot of the opposite crater-wall, a beam of vaguely\nfluorescent light. Simultaneously the search-light vanished.\n\nThe stream of electrons caught the front face of our main building in\na six-foot circle. It held a few seconds, vanished; then stabbed\nagain, and still again. Three bolts. A total, I suppose, of nine or\nten seconds.\n\nI was standing with Grantline at a front window. We had rigged an\noblong of insulated fabric like a curtain: we stood peering, holding\nthe curtain cautiously aside. The ray struck some twenty feet away\nfrom us.\n\n\"Harmless!\"\n\nThe men in the room shouted it with derision. But Grantline swung on\nthem.\n\n\"Don't think that!\"\n\nAn interior signal-panel was beside Grantline. He called the duty-men\nin the instrument room.\n\n\"It's over. What are your readings?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bombarding electrons had passed through the outer shell of the\nbuilding's double-wall, and been absorbed in the rarefied, magnetized\nair-current of the Erentz circulation. Like poison in a man's veins,\nreaching his heart, the free alien electrons had disturbed the motors.\nThey accelerated, then retarded. Pulsed unevenly, and drew added power\nfrom the reserve tanks. But they had normalized at once when the shot\nwas past. The duty-man's voice sounded from the grid in answer to\nGrantline's question:\n\n\"Five degrees colder in your building. Can't you feel it?\"\n\nThe disturbed, weakened Erentz circulation had allowed the outer cold\nto radiate through a trifle. The walls had had a trifle extra\nexplosive pressure from the room-air. A strain--but that was all.\n\n\"It's probably their most powerful single weapon, Gregg.\" Grantline\nsaid.\n\nI nodded. \"Yes. I think so.\"\n\nI had smashed the real giant, with its ten-mile range. The ship was\nonly two miles from us, but it seemed as though this projector were\nexerted to its distance limit. I had noticed on the deck only one of\nthis type. The others, paralyzing-rays and heat rays, were less\ndeadly.\n\nGrantline commented: \"We can withstand a lot of that bombardment. If\nwe stay inside--\"\n\nThat ray, striking a man outside, would penetrate his Erentz suit\nwithin a few seconds, we could not doubt. We had, however, no\nintention of going out unless for dire necessity.\n\n\"Even so,\" said Grantline. \"A hand-shield would hold it off for a\ncertain length of time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had an opportunity a moment later to test our insulated shields.\nThe bolt came again. It darted along the front face of the building,\ncaught our window and clung. The double window-shells were our weakest\npoints. The sheet of flashing Erentz current was transparent: we could\nsee through it as though it were glass. It moved faster, but was\nthinner at the windows than in the walls. We feared the bombarding\nelectrons might cross it, penetrate the inner shell and, like a\nlightning bolt, enter the room.\n\nWe dropped the curtain corner. The radiance of the bolt was dimly\nvisible. A few seconds, then it vanished again, and behind the shield\nwe had not felt a tingle.\n\n\"Harmless!\"\n\nBut our power had been drained nearly an aeron, to neutralize the\nshock to the Erentz current. Grantline said:\n\n\"If they kept that up, it would be a question of whose power supply\nwould last longest. And it would not be ours.... You saw our lights\nfade down while the bolt was striking?\"\n\nBut the brigands did not know we were short of power. And to fire the\nprojector with a continuous bolt would, in thirty minutes, perhaps,\nhave exhausted their own power-reserve.\n\nThis strange warfare! It was new to all of us, for there had been no\nwars on any of the three inhabited worlds for many years. Silent,\nelectronic conflict! Not a question of men in battle. A man at a\nswitch on the brigand ship was the sole actor so far in this assault.\nAnd the results were visible only in the movement of the needle-dials\non our instrument panels. A struggle, so far, not of man's bravery, or\nskill, or strategy, but merely of electronic power supply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet warfare, however modern, can never transcend the human element.\nBefore this insult was ended I was to have many demonstrations of\nthat!\n\n\"I won't answer them,\" Grantline declared. \"Our game is to sit\ndefensive. Conserve everything. Let them make the leading moves.\"\n\nWe waited half an hour, but no other shot came. The valley floor was\npatched with Earthlight and shadow. We could see the vague outline of\nthe brigand ship backed up at the foot of the opposite crater-wall.\nThe form of its dome over the illumined deck was visible, and the line\nof its tiny hull ovals.\n\nOn the rocks near the ship, helmet-lights of prowling brigands\noccasionally showed.\n\nWhatever activity was going on down there we could not see with the\nnaked eye. Grantline did not use our telescope at first. To connect\nit, even for local range, drew on our precious ammunition of power.\nSome of the men urged that we search the sky with the telescope. Was\nour rescue ship from Earth coming? But Grantline refused. We were in\nno trouble yet. And every delay was to our advantage.\n\n\"Commander, where shall I put these helmets?\"\n\nA man came wheeling a pile of helmets on a little truck.\n\n\"At the manual porte--other building.\"\n\nOur weapons and outside equipment were massed at the main exit-locks\nof the large building. But we might want to sally out through the\nsmaller locks also. Grantline sent helmets there; suits were not\nneeded, as most of us were garbed in them now, but without the\nhelmets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSnap was still in the workshop. I went there during this first\nhalf-hour of the attack. Ten of our men were busy there with the\nlittle flying platforms and the fabric shields.\n\n\"How is it, Snap?\"\n\n\"Almost all ready.\"\n\nHe had six of the platforms, including the one we had already used,\nand more than a dozen hand-shields. At a squeeze, all of us could ride\non these six little vehicles. We might have to ride them! We planned\nthat, in the event of disaster to the buildings, we could at least\nescape in this fashion. Food supplies and water were now being placed\nat the portes.\n\nDepressing preparations! Our buildings uninhabitable, a rush out and\naway, abandoning the treasure.... Grantline had never mentioned such a\ncontingency, but I noticed, nevertheless, that preparations were being\nmade.\n\n\"Only that one shot, Gregg?\"\n\nSnap's voice was raised over the clang of the workmen bolting the\nlittle gravity-plates of the last platform.\n\n\"Four blasts. But just the one projector. Their strongest.\"\n\nHe grinned. He wore no Erentz suit as yet. He stood in torn grimy\nwork-trousers and a bedraggled shirt, with the inevitable red eyeshade\nholding back his unruly hair. Around his waist was the weighted belt\nand there were weights on his shoes for gravity stability.\n\n\"Didn't hurt us much.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"When I get the tube-panels in this thing I'll be finished. It'll take\nanother half-hour. I'll join you. Where are you stationed?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI shrugged. \"I was at a front window with Johnny. Nothing to do as\nyet.\"\n\nSnap went back to his work. \"Well, the longer they delay, the better\nfor us. If only your signal got through, Gregg! We'll have a rescue\nship here in a few hours more.\"\n\nAh, that \"if!\"\n\nI turned away. \"Can't help you, Snap?\"\n\n\"No. Take those shields,\" he added to one of the men.\n\n\"Take them where?\"\n\n\"To Grantline. The front admission porte, or the back. He'll tell you\nwhich.\"\n\nThe shields were wheeled away on a little cart. I followed it.\nGrantline sent it to the back exit.\n\n\"No other move from them yet, Johnny?\"\n\n\"No. All quiet.\"\n\n\"Snap's almost finished.\"\n\nThe brigands presently made another play. A giant heat-ray beam came\nacross the valley. It clung to our front wall for nearly a minute.\n\nGrantline got the reports from the instrument room. He laughed.\n\n\"That helped rather than hurt us. Heated the outer wall. Frank took\nadvantage of it and eased up the motors.\"\n\nWe wondered if Miko knew that. Doubtless he did, for another interval\npassed and the heat-ray was not used again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen came a zed-ray. I stood at the window, watching it, faint sheen\nof beam in the dimness. It crept with sinister deliberation along our\nfront building-wall, clung momentarily to our shielded windows and\npried with its revealing glow into Snap's workshop.\n\n\"Looking us over,\" Grantline commented. \"I hope they like what they\nsee.\"\n\nI knew he did not feel the bravado that was in his tone. We had\nnothing but small hand weapons: heat-rays, electronic projectors, and\nbullet projectors. All for very short-range fighting. If Miko had not\nknown that before, he could at least make a good guess at it after the\ncareful zed-ray inspection. With his ship down there two miles away,\nwe were powerless to reach him.\n\nIt seemed that Miko was now testing the use of all his mechanisms. A\nlight-flare went up from the dome-peak of the ship. It rose in a slow\narc over the valley, and burst. For a few seconds the two-mile circle\nof crags was brilliantly illumined. I stared, but I had to shield my\neyes against the dazzling actinic glare, and I could see nothing. Was\nMiko making a zed-ray photograph of our interiors? We had no way of\nknowing.\n\nHe was testing his short-range projectors now. With my eyes again\naccustomed to the normal Earthlight in the valley, I could see the\nstabs of little electronic beams, the Martian paralyzing-rays and\nheat-beams. They darted out like flashing swords from the rocks near\nthe ship.\n\nThen the whole ship and the crater-wall behind it seemed to shift\nsidewise as a Benson curve-light spread its glow about the ship, with\na projector curve-beam coming up and touching the window through which\nI was peering.\n\n\"Haljan, come look at these damn girls! Commander--shall I stop them?\nThey'll kill themselves, or kill us--or smash something!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe followed the man into the building's broad central corridor. Anita\nand Venza were riding a midget flying platform! Anita, in her boyish\nblack garb; Venza with a flowing white Venus-robe. They lay on the\ntiny, six-foot oblong of metal, one manipulating its side shields, the\nother at the controls. As we arrived, the platform came sliding down\nthe narrow confines of the corridor, lurching, barely missing a\ndoor-grid projection. Up to skim the low vaulted ceiling, then down to\nthe floor.\n\nIt sailed past our heads, rising over us as we ducked. Anita waved her\nhand.\n\nGrantline gasped, \"By the infernal!\"\n\nI shouted, \"Anita, stop!\"\n\nBut they only waved at us, skimming down the length of the corridor,\nseeming to avoid a smash a dozen times by the smallest margin of\nchance, stopping miraculously at the further end, hanging poised in\nmid-air, wheeling, coming back, undulating up and down.\n\nGrantline clung to me. \"By the gods of the airways!\"\n\nIn spite of my astonished horror I could not but share Grantline's\nobvious admiration. Three of four other men were watching. The girls\nwere amazingly skillful, no doubt of that. There was not a man among\nus who could have handled that gravity-platform indoors, not one who\nwould have had the brash temerity to try it.\n\nThe platform landed with the grace of a humming bird at our feet, the\ngirls dexterously balancing so that it came to rest swiftly, without\nthe least bump.\n\nI confronted them. \"Anita, what are you doing?\"\n\nShe stood up, flushed and smiling.\n\n\"Practising.\"\n\nImperturbable girls! The product of their age. Oblivious to the\nbrigand attack, they were in here practising!\n\n\"What for?\" I demanded.\n\nVenza's roguish eyes twinkled at me. Her hands went to her slim hips\nwith a gesture of defiance.\n\nShe asked, \"Are you speaking for yourself or the commander?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI ignored her. \"What for?\" I reiterated.\n\n\"Because we're good at it,\" Anita retorted. \"Better than any of you\nmen. If you should need us....\"\n\n\"We don't. We won't.\" I said shortly.\n\n\"But if you should....\"\n\nVenza put in, \"If Snap and I hadn't come for you, you wouldn't be\nhere, Gregg Haljan. I didn't notice you were so horrified to see me\nholding that shield up over you!\"\n\nIt silenced me.\n\nShe added, \"Commander, let us alone. We won't smash anything.\"\n\nGrantline laughed, \"I hope you won't!\"\n\nA warning call took us back to the front window. The brigand's\nsearch-beam was again being used. It swept slowly along the length of\nthe cliff. Its circle went down the cliff steps to the valley floor,\nand came sweeping up again. Then it went up to the observatory\nplatform at the summit above us, then back and crept over to the\nore-sheds.\n\nWe had no men outside, if that was what the brigand wanted to\ndetermine. The search-beam presently vanished. It was replaced\nimmediately by a zed-ray, which darted at once to our treasure sheds\nand clung.\n\nThat stung Grantline into his first action. We flung our own zed-ray\ndown across the valley. It reached the brigand ship; this zed-ray and\na search-light were our only two projectors of long range.\n\nThe brigand ray vanished when ours flashed on. I was with Grantline at\nan image grid in the instrument room. We saw the deck of the brigand\nship and the blurred interior of the cabins.\n\n\"Try the search-beam, Franck. We don't need the other.\"\n\nThe zed-ray went off. We gazed down our search-light which clung to\nthe dome of the distant enemy vessel. We could see movement there.\n\n\"The telescope,\" Grantline ordered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little dynamos hummed. The telescope-finder glowed and clarified.\nOn the deck of the ship we saw the brigands working with the\nassembling of ore-carts. A deck landing-porte was open. The ore-carts\nwere being carried out through a porte-lock and down a landing\nincline. And on the rocks outside, we saw several of the carts--and\nrail-sections and the sections of an ore-shute.\n\nMiko was unloading his mining apparatus! He was making ready to come\nup for the treasure!\n\nThe discovery, startling as it was, nevertheless was far overshadowed\nby an imperative danger alarm from our main building. Brigands were\noutside on our ledge! Miko's search-beam, sweeping the ledge a moment\nbefore, had carefully avoided revealing them. It had been done just\nfor that purpose, no doubt--making us sure that the ledge was\nunoccupied and thus to guard against our own light making a search.\n\nBut there was a brigand group here close outside our walls! By the\nmerest chance the radiating glow from our search-ray had shown the\nhelmeted figures scurrying for shelter.\n\nGrantline leaped to his feet.\n\nWe rushed for the rear exit-porte which was nearest us. The giant\nbloated figures had been seen running along the outside of the\nconnecting corridor, in this direction. But before we ever got there,\na new alarm came. A brigand was crouching at a front corner of the\nmain building! His hydrogen heat-torch had already opened a rift in\nthe wall!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n_Desperate Offensive_\n\n\"In with you!\" ordered Grantline. \"Get your helmets on! How many? Six?\nEnough--get back there, Williams--you were last. The lock won't hold\nany more.\"\n\nI was one of the six who jammed into the manual exit lock. We went\nthrough it: in a moment we were outside. It was less than three\nminutes since the prowling brigands had been seen.\n\nGrantline touched me just as we emerged. \"Don't wait for orders! Get\nthem!\"\n\n\"That fellow with the torch, the most dangerous--\"\n\n\"Yes! I'm with you.\"\n\nWe went out with a rush. We had already discarded our shoe and belt\nweights. I leaped, regardless of my companions.\n\nThe scurrying Martians had disappeared. Through my visor bull's-eye I\ncould see only the Earthlit rocky surface of the ledge. Beside me\nstretched the dark wall of our building.\n\nI bounded toward the front. The brigand with the torch had been at\nthis front corner. I could not see him from here: he had been\ncrouching just around the angle.\n\nI had a tiny bullet projector, the best weapon for short range\noutdoors. I was aware of Grantline close behind me.\n\nIt took only a few of my giant leaps. I landed at the corner,\nrecovered my balance, and whirled around to the front.\n\nThe Martian was here, a giant misshapen lump as he crouched. His torch\nwas a little stab of blue in the deep shadow enveloping him. Intent\nupon his work, he did not see me. Perhaps he thought his fellows had\nbroken our exits by now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI landed like a leopard upon his back and fired, my weapon muzzle\nramming him. His torch fell hissing with a silent rain of blue fire\nupon the rocks.\n\nAs my grip upon him made audiphone contact, his agonized scream\nrattled the diaphragms of my ear-grids with horrible, deafening\nintensity.\n\nHe lay writhing under me, then was still. His scream choked into\nsilence. His suit deflated within my encircling grip. He was dead; my\nleaden, steel-tipped pellet had punctured the double surface of his\nErentz-fabric, penetrated his chest.\n\nGrantline's following leap landed him over me.\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI climbed from the inert body. The torch had hissed itself out.\nGrantline swung on our building corner, and I leaned down with him to\nexamine it. The torch had fused and scarred the surface of the wall,\nburned almost through. A pressure-rift had opened. We could see it, a\ncurving gash in the metal wall-plate like a crack in a glass\nwindow-pane.\n\nI went cold. This was serious damage! The rarefied Erentz-air would\nseep out. It was leaking now: we could see the magnetic radiance of it\nall up the length of the ten-foot crack. The leak would change the\npressure of the Erentz system, constantly lower it, demanding steady\nrenewal. The Erentz motors would overheat; some might go bad from the\nstrain.\n\nGrantline stood gripping me.\n\n\"Damn bad!\"\n\n\"Yes. Can't we repair it, Johnny?\"\n\n\"No. Have to take that whole plate-section out, shut off the Erentz\nplant and exhaust the interior air of all this bulkhead of the\nbuilding. Day's job--maybe more.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd the crack would get worse, I knew. It would gradually spread and\nwiden. The Erentz circulation would fail. All our power would be\ndrained struggling to maintain it. This brigand who had unwittingly\ncommitted suicide by his daring act had accomplished more than he\nperhaps had realized. I could envisage our weapons, useless from lack\nof power. The air in our buildings turning fetid and frigid: ourselves\nforced to the helmets. A rush out to abandon the camp and escape. The\nbuildings exploding--scattering into a litter on the ledge like a\nchild's broken toy. The treasure abandoned, with the brigands coming\nup and loading it on their ship.\n\nOur defeat. In a few hours now--or minutes. This crack could slowly\nwiden, or it could break suddenly at any time. Disaster, come now so\nabruptly upon us at the very start of the brigand attack....\n\nGrantline's voice in my audiphone broke my despairing rush of\nthoughts. \"Bad. Come on, Gregg; nothing to do here.\"\n\nWe were aware that our other four men had run along the building's\nother side. They emerged now--with the running brigands in front of\nthem, rushing out toward the staircase on the ledge. Three giant\nMartian figures in flight, with our four men chasing.\n\nA bullet projector spat, with its queer stab of exploding powder fed\nby the burning oxygen fumes of its artificial air-chamber--one of our\nmen firing. A brigand fell to the rocks by the brink of the ledge. The\nothers reached the descending staircase, tumbled down it with reckless\nleaps.\n\nOur men turned back. Before we could join them, the enemy ship down in\nthe valley sent up a cautious search-beam which located its returning\nmen. Then the beam swung up to the ledge, landed upon us.\n\nWe stood confused, blinded by the brilliant glare. Grantline stumbled\nagainst me.\n\n\"Run, Gregg! They'll be firing at us.\"\n\nWe dashed away. Our companions joined us, rushing back for the porte.\nI saw it open, reinforcements coming out to help us--half a dozen\nfigures carrying a ten-foot insulated shield. They could barely get it\nout through the porte.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Martian search-ray abruptly vanished. Then almost instantly the\nelectronic ray came with its deadly stab. Missed us at first, as we\nran for the shield. It vanished, and stabbed again. It caught us, but\nnow we were behind the shield, carrying it back to the porte, hiding\nbehind it.\n\nThe ray stabbed once or twice more.\n\nWhether Miko's instruments showed him how serious that damage was to\nour front wall, we never knew. But I think that he realized. His\nsearch-beam clung to it, and his zed-ray pried into our interiors.\n\nThe brigand ship was active now. We were desperate: we used our\ntelescope freely for observation. And used our zed-ray and\nsearch-light. Miko's ore-carts and mining apparatus were unloaded on\nthe rocks. The rail-sections were being carried a mile out, nearly to\nthe center of the valley. A subsidiary camp was being established\nthere, only a mile from the base of our cliff, but still far beyond\nreach of our weapons. We could see the brigand lights down there.\n\nThen the ore-shute sections were brought over. We could see Miko's men\ncarrying some of the giant projectors, mounting them in the new\nposition. Power tanks and cables. Light-flare catapults--little\nmechanical cannons for throwing the bombs.\n\nThe enemy search-light constantly raked our vicinity. Occasionally the\ngiant electronic projector flung up its bolt as though warning us not\nto dare leave our buildings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf an hour went by. Our situation was even worse than Miko could\nknow. The Erentz motors were running hot--our power draining, the\ncrack widening. When it would break we could not tell; but the danger\nwas like a sword over us.\n\nAn anxious thirty minutes for us, this second interlude. Grantline\ncalled a meeting of all our little force, with every man having his\nsay. Inactivity was no longer a feasible policy. We recklessly used\nour power to search the sky. Our rescue ship might be up there; but we\ncould not see it with our disabled instruments. No signals came. We\ncould not--or, at least, did not--receive them.\n\n\"They wouldn't signal,\" Grantline protested. \"They'd know the Martians\nwould be more likely to get the signal than us. Of what use to warn\nMiko?\"\n\nBut he did not dare wait for a rescue ship that might or might not be\ncoming! Miko was playing the waiting game now--making ready for a\nquick loading of the ore when we were forced to abandon our buildings.\n\nThe brigand ship suddenly moved its position! It rose up in a low flat\narc, came forward and settled in the center of the valley where the\ncarts and rail-sections were piled, and the outside projectors newly\nmounted on the rocks. But the projectors only shot at us occasionally.\n\nThe brigands now began laying the rails from the ship toward the base\nof our cliff. The chute would bring the ore down from the ledge, and\nthe carts would take it to the ship.\n\nThe laying of the rails was done under cover of occasional stabs from\nthe electronic projector.\n\nAnd then we discovered that Miko had made still another move. The\nbrigand rays, fired from the depths of the valley, could strike our\nfront building, but could not reach all our ledge. And from the ship's\nnew and nearer position this disadvantage was intensified. Then\nabruptly we realized that under cover of darkness-bombs an electronic\nprojector and search-ray had been carried to the top of the\ncrater-rim, diagonally across and only half a mile from us. Their\nbeams shot down, raking all our vicinity from this new angle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was on the little flying platform which sallied out as a test to\nattack these isolated projectors. Snap and I and one other volunteer\nwent. He and I held the shield; Snap handled the controls.\n\nOur exit-porte was on the lee side of the building from the hostile\nsearch-beam. We got out unobserved and sailed upward; but soon a light\nfrom the ship caught us. And the projector bolts came up....\n\nOur sortie only lasted a few minutes. To me, it was a confusion of\ncrossing beams, with the stars overhead, the swaying little platform\nunder me, and the shield tingling in my hands when the blasts struck\nus. Moments of blurred terror....\n\nThe voice of the man beside me sounded in my ears: \"Now, Haljan, give\nthem one!\"\n\nWe were up over the peak of the rim with the hostile projectors under\nus. I gauged our movement, and dropped an explosive powder bomb.\n\nIt missed. It flared with a puff on the rocks, twenty feet from where\nthe two projectors were mounted. I saw that two helmeted figures were\ndown there. They tried to swing their grids upward, but could not get\nthem vertical to reach us. The ship was firing at us, but it was far\naway. And Grantline's search-beam was going full-power, clinging to\nthe ship to dazzle them.\n\nSnap circled us. As we came back I dropped another bomb. Its silent\npuff seemed littered with flying fragments of the two projectors and\nthe bodies of the men.\n\nWe flew swiftly back and got in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt decided Grantline. For an hour past Snap and I had been urging our\nplan to use the gravity platforms. To remain inactive was sure defeat\nnow. Even if our buildings did not explode--if we thought to huddle in\nthem, helmeted in the failing air--then Miko could readily ignore us\nand proceed with his loading of the treasure under our helpless gaze.\nHe could do that now with safety--if we refused to sally out--for we\ncould not fire our weapons through our windows.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: To fire a projector through the walls or windows would at\nonce wreck the protective Erentz system. The enemy ship has pressure\nportes, constructed for the emission of the weapon-rays. Grantline's\nonly weapons thus mounted were his search-beam and zed-ray.]\n\nTo remain defensive would end inevitably in our defeat. We all knew it\nnow; it was obvious. The waiting game was Miko's--not ours! And he was\nplaying it.\n\nThe success of our attack upon the distant isolated projectors\nheartened us. Yet it was a desperate offensive indeed upon which we\nnow decided!\n\nWe prepared our little expedition at the larger of the exit portes.\nMiko's zed-ray was watching all our interior movements. We made a\nbrave show of activity in our workshop with abandoned ore-carts which\nwere stored there. We got them out, started to recondition them.\n\nIt seemed to fool Miko. His zed-ray clung to the workshop, watching\nus. And at the distant porte we gathered the little platforms, the\nshields, helmets, bombs, and a few hand-projectors.\n\nThere were six platforms--three of us upon each. It left four people\nto remain indoors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI need not describe the emotion with which Snap and I listened to\nVenza and Anita pleading to be allowed to accompany us. They urged it\nupon Grantline, and we took no part. It was too important a decision.\nThe treasure--the life or death of all these men--hung now upon the\nfate of our venture. Snap and I could not intrude our personal\nfeelings.\n\nAnd the girls won. Both were undeniably more skilful at handling the\nmidget platforms than any of us men. Two of the six platforms could be\nguided by them. That was a third of our little force! And of what use\nto go out and be defeated, leaving the girls here to meet death almost\nimmediately afterward?\n\nWe gathered at the porte. A last minute change made Grantline order\nsix of his men to remain guarding the buildings. The instruments--the\nErentz system--all the appliances had to be attended.\n\nIt left four platforms, each with three men, with Grantline at the\ncontrols of one of them. And upon the other two of the six Venza rode\nwith Snap, and I with Anita.\n\nWe crouched in the shadows outside the porte. So small an army,\nsallying out to bomb this enemy vessel or be killed in the attempt!\nOnly sixteen of us. And thirty or so brigands.\n\nI envisaged then this tiny Moon-crater, the scene of this battle we\nwere waging. Struggling humans, desperately trying to kill. Alone here\non this globe. Around us, the wide reaches of Lunar desolation. In all\nthis world, every human being was gathered here, struggling to kill!\n\nAnita drew me down to the platform. \"Ready, Gregg.\"\n\nThe others were rising. We lifted, moved slowly out and away from the\nprotective shadows of the building.\n\nIn a tiny queue the six little platforms sailed out over the valley\ntoward the brigand ship.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n_The Battle in the Crater_\n\nGrantline led us. We held about level. Five hundred feet beneath us\nthe brigand ship lay, cradled on the rocks. When it was still a mile\naway from us I could see all its outline fairly clearly in the\ndimness. Its tiny hull-windows were now dark; but the blurred shape of\nthe hull was visible and above it the rounded cap of dome, with a dim\nradiance beneath it.\n\nWe followed Grantline's platform. It was rising, drawing the others\nafter it like a tail. I touched Anita where she lay beside me with her\nhead half in the small hooded control-bank.\n\n\"Going too high.\"\n\nShe nodded, but followed the line nevertheless. It was Grantline's\ncommand.\n\nI lay crouched, holding the inner tips of the flexible side-shields.\nThe bottom of the platform was covered with the insulated fabric.\nThere were two side-shields. They extended upward some two feet,\nflexible so that I could hold them out to see over them, or draw them\nup and in to cover us.\n\nThey afforded a measure of protection against the hostile rays, though\njust how much we were not sure. With the platform level, a bolt from\nbeneath could not harm us unless it continued for a considerable time.\nBut the platform, except upon direct flight, was seldom level, for it\nwas a frail, unstable little vehicle! To handle it was more than a\nquestion of the controls. We balanced, and helped to guide it, with\nthe movement of our bodies--shifting our weight sidewise, or back, or\nforward to make it dip as the controls altered the gravity-pull in its\ntiny plate-sections.\n\nLike a bird, wheeling, soaring, swooping. To me, it was a precarious\nbusiness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut now we were in straight flight diagonally upward. The outline of\nthe brigand ship came under us. I crouched tense, breathless; every\nmoment it seemed that the brigands must discover us and loose their\nbolts.\n\nThey may have seen us for some moments before they fired. I peered\nover the side-shield down at our mark, then up ahead to get\nGrantline's firing signal. It seemed long delayed. We were almost over\nthe ship. An added glow down there must have warned Grantline that a\nshot was coming. The tiny red light flared bright on his platform.\n\nI hissed on our Benson curve-light radiance. We had been dark, but a\nsoft glow now enveloped us. Its sheen went down to the ship to reveal\nus. But its curving path showed us falsely placed. I saw the little\nline of platforms ahead of us seem to move suddenly sidewise.\n\nIt was everyone for himself now; none of us could tell where the other\nplatforms actually were placed or headed. Anita swooped us sharply\ndown to avoid a possible collision.\n\n\"Gregg--?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm aiming.\"\n\nI was making ready to drop the little explosive globe-bomb. Our\nsearch-light ray at the camp, answering Grantline's signal, shot down\nand bathed the ship in a white glare, revealing it for our aim.\nSimultaneously the brigand bolts came up at us.\n\nI held my bomb out over the shield, calculating the angle to throw it\ndown. The brigand rays flashed around me. They were horribly close;\nMiko had understood our sudden visible shift and aimed, not where we\nappeared to be, but where we had been a moment before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI dropped my bomb hastily at the glowing white ship. The touch of a\nhostile ray would have exploded it in my hand. I could see its\nblue-sizzling fuse as it fell. I saw the others also dropping from our\nnearby platforms. The explosions from them merged in a confusion of\nthe white glare--and a cloud of black light-mist as the brigands out\non the rocks used their occulting darkness bombs.\n\nWe swept past in a blur of leaping hostile beams. Silent battle of\nlights! Darkness bombs down at the ship struggling to bar our camp\nsearch-ray. The Benson radiance-rays from our passing platforms\ncurving down to mingle with the confusion. The electronic rays sending\nup their bolts....\n\nOur platforms dropped some ten dynamitrine bombs in that first\npassage over the ship. As we sped by, I dimmed the Benson's radiance.\nI peered. We had not hit the ship. Or if we had, the damage was\ninconclusive. But on the rocks I could see a pile of ore-carts\nscattered--broken wreckage, in which the litter of two or three\nprojectors seemed strewn. And the gruesome deflated forms of several\nhelmeted figures. Others seemed, to be running, scattering--hiding in\nthe rocks and pit-holes. Twenty brigands at least were outside the\nship. Some were running over toward the base of our camp-ledge. The\ndarkness bombs were spreading like a curtain over the valley floor;\nbut it seemed that some of the figures were dragging their projectors\naway.\n\nWe sailed off toward the opposite crater-rim. I remember passing over\nthe broken wreckage of Grantline's little space-ship, the _Comet_.\nMiko's bolts momentarily had vanished. We had hit some of his outside\nprojectors; the others were abandoned, or being dragged to safer\npositions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a mile we wheeled and went back. I suddenly realized that only\nfour platforms were in the re-formed line ahead of us. One was\nmissing! I saw it now, wavering down, close over the ship. A bolt\nleaped up diagonally from a distant angle on the rocks and caught the\ndisabled platform. It fell, whirling, glowing red--disappeared into\nthe blur of darkness like a bit of heated metal plunged into water.\n\nOne out of six of our platforms already lost! Three men of our little\nforce gone!\n\nBut Grantline led us desperately back. Anita caught his signal to\nbreak our line. The five platforms scattered, dipping and wheeling\nlike frightened birds--blurring shapes, shifting unnaturally in flight\nas the Benson curve-angles were altered.\n\nAnita now took our platform in a long swoop downward. Her tense,\nmurmured voice sounded in my ears:\n\n\"Hold off: I'll take us low.\"\n\nA melee. Passing platform shapes. The darting bolts, crossing like\nancient rapiers. Falling blue points of fuse-lights as we threw our\nbombs.\n\nDown in a swoop. Then rising. Away, and then back. This silent warfare\nof lights! It seemed that around me must be bursting a pandemonium of\nsound. Yet I heard nothing. Silent, blurred melee, infinitely\nfrightening. A bolt struck us, clung for an instant; but we weathered\nit. The light was blinding. Through my gloves I could feel the tingle\nof the over-charged shield as it caught and absorbed the hostile\nbombardment. Under me the platform seemed heated. My little Erentz\nmotors ran with ragged pulse. I got too much oxygen; my head roared\nwith it. Spots danced before my closed eyes. Then not enough oxygen. I\nwas dully smothering....\n\nThen the bolt was gone. I found us soaring upward, horribly tilted. I\nshifted over.\n\n\"Anita! Anita, dear!\"\n\n\"Yes. Gregg. All right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe melee went on. The brigand ship and all its vicinity was enveloped\nin darkness-mist now--a turgid sable curtain, made more dense by the\ndissipating heavy fumes of our exploding bombs which settled low over\nthe ship and the rocks nearby. The search-light from our camp strove\nfutilely to penetrate the cloud.\n\nOur platforms were separated. One went by high over us; I saw another\ndart close beneath my shield.\n\n\"God, Anita!\"\n\n\"Too close! I did not mean that--I didn't see it.\"\n\nAlmost a collision.\n\n\"Oh, Gregg, haven't we broken the ship's dome yet?\"\n\nIt seemed not. I had dropped nearly all my bombs. This could not go on\nmuch longer. Had it been only five minutes? Only that? Reason told me\nso, yet it seemed an eternity of horror.\n\nAnother swoop. My last bomb. Anita had brought us into position to\nfling it. But I could not. A bolt stabbed up from the gloom and\ncaught us. We huddled, pulling the shields up and over us.\n\nBlurred darkness again. Too much to the side now. I had to wait while\nAnita swung us back. Then we seemed too high.\n\nWe swooped. But not too low! Down in the darkness-mist we would\nimmediately have lost direction, and crashed.\n\nI waited with my last bomb. The other platforms were occasionally\ndropping them: I had been too hasty, too prodigal.\n\nHad we broken the ship's dome with a direct hit? It seemed not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe brigands were occasionally sending up catapulted light-flares.\nThey came from positions on the rocks outside the ship. They mounted\nin lazy curves and burst over us. The concealing darkness, broken only\nby the flares of our explosions, enveloped the enemy. Our camp\nsearch-light was still struggling with it. But overhead, where the few\nlittle platforms were circling and swooping, the flares gave an almost\ncontinuous glare. It was dazzling, blinding. Even through the smoked\npane which I adjusted to my visor I could not stand it.\n\nBut there were thoughts of comparative dimness. In a patch where the\nEarthlight struck through the darkness of the rocks, I saw another of\nour fallen platforms! Snap and Venza! Dear God....\n\nIt was not they, but three figures of our men. One was dead. Two had\nsurvived the fall. They stood up, staggering. And in that instant,\nbefore the turgid black curtain closed over them, I saw two brigands\ncome rushing. Their hand projectors stabbed at close range. Our men\ncrumpled and fell.\n\nAnd now I saw why probably we had never yet hit the ship.\n\nIts outline was revealed. \"Now, Gregg--can you fling it from here?\"\n\nWe were in position again. I flung my last missile, watched its light\nas it dropped. On the dome-roof two of Miko's men were crouching. My\nbomb was truly aimed--perhaps one of the few in all our bombardment\nwhich would have landed directly on the dome-roof. But the waiting\nmarksmen fired at it with short-range heat projectors and exploded it\nharmlessly while it was still above them.\n\nWe swung up and away. I saw, high above us, Grantline's platform,\nrecognizing its red signal light. There seemed a lull. The enemy fire\nhad died down to only a very occasional bolt. In the confusion of my\nwhirling impressions I wondered if Miko were in distress? Not that! We\nhad not hit his ship; perhaps we had done little damage indeed! It was\nwe who were in distress. Two of our platforms had fallen--two out of\nsix. Or more, of which I did not know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw one rising off to the side of us. Grantline was over us. Well,\nwe were at least three. And then I saw the fourth.\n\n\"Grantline is calling us up, Gregg.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrantline's signal-light was summoning us from the attack. He was a\nthousand or two thousand feet above.\n\nI was suddenly shocked with horror. The search-ray from our camp\nabruptly vanished! Anita wheeled us to face the distant ledge. The\ncamp-lights showed, and over one of the buildings was a distress\nlight!\n\nHad the crack in our front wall broken, threatening explosion of all\nthe buildings? The wild thoughts swept me. But it was not that. I\ncould see light-stabs from the cliff outside the main building. Miko\nhad dared to send some of his men to attack our almost abandoned camp!\n\nGrantline realized it. His red helmet-light semaphored the command to\nfollow him. His platform soared away, heading for the camp, with the\nother two behind him.\n\nAnita lifted us to follow. But I checked her.\n\n\"No! Off to the right, across the valley.\"\n\n\"But Gregg!\"\n\n\"Do as I say, Anita.\"\n\nShe swung us diagonally away from both the camp and the brigand ship.\nI prayed that we might not be noticed by the brigands.\n\n\"Anita, listen: I've an idea!\"\n\nThe attack on the brigand ship was over. It lay enveloped in the\ndarkness of the powder-gas cloud and its own darkness bombs. But it\nwas uninjured.\n\nMiko had answered us with our own tactics. He had practically unmanned\nthe ship, no doubt, and had sent his men to our buildings. The fight\nhad shifted. But I was now without ammunition, save for two or three\nsmall bullet projectors.\n\nOf what use for our platform to rush back? Miko expected that. His\nattack on the camp was undoubtedly made just for that purpose.\n\n\"Anita, if we can get down on the rocks somewhere near the ship, and\ncreep up on it unobserved in that blackness....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI might be able to open its manual hull-lock, rip it open and let the\nair out. If I could get into its pressure chamber and unseal the inner\nslide....\n\n\"It would wreck the ship, Anita, exhaust all its air. Shall we try\nit?\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, Gregg.\"\n\nWe seemed to be unobserved. We skimmed close to the valley floor, a\nmile from the ship. We headed slowly toward it, sailing low over the\nrocks.\n\nThen we landed, left the platform.\n\n\"Let me go first, Anita.\"\n\nI held a bullet projector. With slow, cautious leaps, we advanced.\nAnita was behind me. I had wanted to leave her with the platform, but\nshe would not stay. And to be with me seemed at least equally safe.\n\nThe rocks were deserted. I thought there was very little chance that\nany of the enemy would lurk here. We clambered over the pitted,\nscarred surface. The higher crags, etched with Earthlight, stood like\nsentinels in the gloom.\n\nThe brigand ship with its surrounding darkness was not far from us.\nThen we entered the cloud.\n\nNo one was out here. We passed the wreckage of broken projectors, and\ngruesome, shattered human forms.\n\nWe prowled closer. The hull of the ship loomed ahead of us. All dark.\n\nWe came at last close against the sleek metal hull-side, slid along it\ntoward where I was sure the manual-porte was located.\n\nAbruptly I realized that Anita was not behind me! Then I saw her at a\nlittle distance, struggling in the grip of a giant helmeted figure!\nThe brigand lifted her--turned, and, carrying her, ran the other way!\n\nI did not dare fire. I bounded after them along the hull-side, around\nunder the curve of the pointed bow, down along the other side.\n\nI had mistaken the hull-porte location. It was here. The running,\nbounding figure reached it, slid the panel. I was only fifty feet\naway--not much more than a single leap. I saw Anita being shoved into\nthe pressure lock. The Martian flung himself after her.\n\nI fired at him, but missed. I came with a rush. And as I reached the\nporte it slid closed in my face, barring me!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n_In the Pressure Lock._\n\nWith puny fists I pounded the panel. A small pane in it was\ntransparent. Within the lock I could see the blurred figures of Anita\nand her captor--and, it seemed, another figure. The lock was some ten\nfeet square, with a low ceiling. It glowed with a dim tube-light.\n\nI pounded, thumped with futile, silent blows. The mechanism was here\nto open this manual; but it was now clasped from within and would not\noperate.\n\nA few seconds only, while I stood there in a panic of confusion,\nraging to get in. This disaster had come so suddenly! I did not plan;\nI had no thought save to batter my way in and rescue Anita. I recall\nthat I beat on the glassite pane with my bullet projector until the\nweapon was bent and useless; and I flung it with a wild, despairing\nrage at my feet.\n\nThey were letting the ship's air-pressure into this lock. Soon they\nwould open the inner panel, step into the secondary chamber--and in a\nmoment more would be within the ship's hull corridor. Anita, lost to\nme!\n\nThe outer panel suddenly opened! I had lunged against it with my\nshoulder; the giant figure inside slid it. I was taken by surprise! I\nhalf-fell inward.\n\nHuge arms went around me. The goggled face of the helmet peered into\nmine.\n\n\"So it is you, Haljan! I thought I recognized that little device over\nyour helmet-bracket. And there is my little Anita, come back to me\nagain!\"\n\nMiko!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was he. His great bloated arms encircling me, bending me\nbackward, holding me almost helpless. I saw over his shoulder that\nAnita was clutched in the grip of another helmeted figure. No giant,\nbut tall for an Earthman--almost as tall as myself. Then the\ntube-light in the room illumined the visor. I saw the face, recognized\nit. Moa!\n\nI gasped, \"So--I've--got you, Miko--\"\n\n\"Got me! You're a fool to the last, Gregg Haljan! A fool to the last!\nBut you were always a fool.\"\n\nI could scarcely move in his grip. My arms were pinned. As he slowly\nbent me backward, I wound my legs around one of his; it was as\nunyielding as a steel pillar. He had closed the outer panel; the\nair-pressure in the lock was rising. I could feel it against my suit.\n\nMy helmeted head was being forced backward; Miko's left arm held me.\nIn his gloved right hand as it came slowly up over my throat I saw a\nknife-blade, its naked, sharpened metal glistening blue-white in the\nlight from overhead.\n\nI seized his wrist. But my puny strength could not hold him. The\nknife, against all my efforts, came slowly down.\n\nA moment of this slow deadly combat--the end of everything for me.\n\nI was aware of the helmeted figure of Moa casting off Anita--and then\nthe two girls leaping together upon Miko. It threw him off his\nbalance, and my hanging weight made him topple forward. He took a step\nto recover himself; his hand with the knife was flung up with an\ninstinctive, involuntary balancing gesture. And as it came swiftly\ndown again, I forced the knife-blade to graze his throat. Its point\ncaught in the fabric of his suit.\n\nHis startled oath jangled in my ears. The girls were clawing at him;\nwe were all four scrambling, swaying. With despairing strength I\ntwisted at his waist. The knife went into his throat. I plunged it\ndeeper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis suit went flabby. He crumpled over me and fell, knocking me to the\nfloor. His voice, with the horrible gurgling rasp of death in it,\nrattled my ear-grids.\n\n\"Not such a fool--are you, Haljan--\"\n\nMoa's helmeted head was close over us. I saw that she had seized the\nknife, jerked it from her brother's throat. She leaped backward,\nwaving it.\n\nI twisted from under Miko's inert, lifeless body. As I got to my feet,\nAnita flung herself to shield me. Moa was across the lock, backed up\nagainst its wall. The knife in her hand went up. She stood for the\nbriefest instant regarding Anita and me holding each other. I thought\nthat she was about to leap upon us; but before I could move, the knife\ncame down and plunged into her breast. She fell forward, her\ngrotesque helmet striking the floor-grid almost at my feet.\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\n\"No! She moved! Get her helmet off! There's enough air here.\"\n\nMy helmet pressure-indicator was faintly buzzing to show that a safe\npressure was in the room. I shut off Moa's Erentz motors, unfastened\nher helmet, raised it off. We gently turned her body. She lay with\nclosed eyes, her pallid face blue-cast from the light in the lock.\n\nWith our own helmets off, we knelt over her.\n\n\"Oh. Gregg, is she dead?\"\n\n\"No. Not quite--but dying.\"\n\n\"Oh Gregg, I don't want her to die! She was trying to help you there\nat the last.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes; the film of death was glazing them. But she saw\nme, recognized me.\n\n\"Gregg--\"\n\n\"Yes, Moa, I'm here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer livid lips were faintly drawn in a smile. \"I'm--so glad--you took\nthe helmets off, Gregg. I'm--going--you know.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Going--back to Mars--to rest with the fire-makers--where I came from.\nI was thinking--maybe you would kiss me, Gregg--?\"\n\nAnita gently pushed me down. I pressed the white, faintly smiling lips\nwith mine. She sighed, and it ended with a rattle in her throat.\n\n\"Thank you--Gregg--closer--I can't talk so loudly--\"\n\nOne of her gloved hands struggled to touch me, but she had no strength\nand it fell back. Her words were the faintest of whispers:\n\n\"There was no use living--without your love. But I want you to\nsee--now--that a Martian girl can--die with a smile--\"\n\nHer eyelids fluttered down: it seemed that she sighed and then was not\nbreathing. But on her livid face the faint smile still lingered to\nshow me how a Martian girl could die.\n\nWe had forgotten for the moment where we were. As I glanced up I saw\nthat through the inner panel, past the secondary lock, the ship's\nhull-corridor was visible, and along its length a group of Martians\nwere advancing! They saw us, and came running.\n\n\"Anita! Look! We've got to get out of here!\"\n\nThe secondary lock was open to the corridor. We jammed on our helmets.\nThe unhelmeted brigands by then were fumbling at the inner panel. I\npulled at the lever of the outer panel. The brigands were hurrying,\nthinking they could be in time to stop me. One of the more cautious\nfumbled with a helmet.\n\n\"Anita, run! Try and keep your feet.\"\n\nI slid the outer panel and pushed at Anita. Simultaneously the\nbrigands opened the inner porte.\n\nThe air came with a tempestuous rush. A blast through the inner\nporte--through the little pressure-lock--a wild rush out to the\nairless Moon. All the air in the ship madly rushing to escape....\n\nLike feathers we were blown with it. I recall an impression of the\nhurtling brigand figures and swift-flying rocks under me. A silent\ncrash as I struck.\n\nThen soundless, empty blackness.\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n_Triumph!_\n\n\"Is he conscious? We'd better take him back, get his helmet off.\"\n\n\"It's over. We can get back now. Venza, dear, we've won--it's over.\"\n\n\"He hears us!\"\n\n\"Gregg!\"\n\n\"He hears us--he's all right!\"\n\nI opened my eyes. I lay on the rocks. Over my helmet other helmets\nwere peering, and faint, familiar voices mingled with the roaring in\nmy ears.\n\n\"--back to the camp and get his helmet off.\"\n\n\"Are his motors smooth? Keep them right, Snap--he must have good air.\"\n\nI seemed unhurt. But Anita....\n\nShe was here. \"Gregg, dear one!\"\n\nAnita safe! All four of us here on the Earthlit rocks, close outside\nthe brigand ship.\n\n\"Anita!\"\n\nShe held me, lifted me. I was uninjured. I could stand; I staggered up\nand stood swaying. The brigand ship, a hundred feet away, loomed dark\nand silent, a lifeless bulk, already empty of air, drained in that mad\nblast outward. Like the wreck of the _Planetara_--a dead, pulseless\nhulk already.\n\nWe four stood together, triumphant. The battle was over. The brigands\nwere worsted, almost the last man of them dead or dying. No more than\nten or fifteen had been available for that final assault upon the camp\nbuildings. Miko's last strategy. I think perhaps he had intended, with\nhis few remaining men, to take the ship and make away, deserting his\nfellows.\n\nAll on the ship, caught unhelmeted by the explosion, were dead long\nsince.\n\nI stood listening to Snap's triumphant account. It had not been\ndifficult for the flying platforms to hunt down the attacking brigands\non the open rocks. We had only lost one more platform.\n\nHuman hearts beat sometimes with very selfish emotions. It was a\ntriumphant ending for us, and we hardly gave a thought that half of\nGrantline's little group had perished.\n\nWe huddled on Snap's platform. It rose, lurching drunkenly, barely\ncarrying us.\n\nAnd as we headed for the Grantline buildings, where still the rift in\nthe wall had not quite broken, there came the final triumph. Miko had\nbeen aware of it, and knew he had lost. Grantline's search-light\nleaped upward, swept the sky, caught its sought-for object--a huge\nsilver cylinder, bathed brightly in the white search-beam glare.\n\nThe police-ship from Earth!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n_My Exit_\n\nMy narrative lies now in this permanently recorded form before you,\nand I prepare my exit bow with the humble hope that I may have given\nyou pleasure. If so, I do beg you to tell me of it. There are some who\nalready have flashed their approval of my discs; I thank them most\nearnestly and gratefully.\n\nMy errors of recording unquestionably are many; and for them I ask\nyour indulgence. There have been, I can readily see, errors of\nomission. I have not mentioned, for instance, the final rescue of the\n_Planetara's_ marooned passengers on the asteroid. You will bear with\nme, since the disc-space has its technical limitations, that such\nomissions have been unavoidable.\n\nSince the passage of the Earth-law by the Federated Board of\nEducation, forcing narrative fiction to cling so closely to sworn\nfacts of actual happening, I need offer no assurance of the truth of\nmy narrative. My witnesses have filed their corroborating\ndeclarations. Indeed, the _Planetara's_ wreck and the brigands' attack\nupon the Moon-treasure were given the widest news-casters' publicity,\nas you all know. Yet I, who was unwittingly involved in those stirring\nevents, may have added a more personal note, making the scenes more\nvivid to your imagination. I have tried to do that. I do hope that in\nsome measure you will think I have succeeded.\n\nThere are many foolish girls now who say that they would like to know\nGregg Haljan. They doubtless would be very disappointed. I really\ncrave no more publicity. And the girls of all the Universe have no\ncharm for me. There is only one, for me--an Earth-girl.\n\nI think that life has very beautifully endowed me with its blessings.\n\n\n\n\nGiants of the Ray\n\n_By Tom Curry_\n\n[Illustration:]\n\n[Sidenote: Madly the three raced for their lives up the shaft of the\nradium mine, for behind them poured a stream of hideous\nmonsters--giants of the ray!]\n\n\n\"I tell you I'm not crazy,\" insisted the tall man. \"Durkin, they got a\nbig mine.\"\n\nBill Durkin laughed roughly, and sneered openly at his partner, Frank\nMaget. \"G'wan, you're drunk.\"\n\n\"Well, I was last night,\" admitted Maget. \"But I'd slept it off this\nmorning. I was lying under that table in the Portuguee's, and when I\nopened my eyes, there were these three birds sitting near me. They\nhadn't spotted me. I heard 'em talking of wealth, how their mine was\nof unbelievable richness and greater than any other deposit in the\nworld. Well, that means something, don't it?\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Durkin. \"But whoever saw a cricket fifteen\ninches long?\"\n\n[Illustration: Its form was that of a gigantic frog, and from its\nthroat sounded the terrific bellowing which rivaled thunder.]\n\n\"Listen. There were three of these guys. One was a hell of a looking\nfellow: his face was piebald, with purple spots. His skin was bleached\nand withered, and one eye looked like a pearl collar button! They\ncalled him Professor, too, Professor Gurlone. Well, he takes out this\ndamn cricket thing and it was sort of reddish purple but alive, and as\nlong as your forearm. This professor guy says his son had taken an\nordinary cricket and made it grow into the one he had. But the mine\nwas what interested me. I kept my mouth shut and my ears open, and\nit's in the Matto Grosso. May be emeralds, diamonds, or gold. Boy, I'm\nheading for it, right now. The old guy's going back to-morrow, get\nme?\"\n\n\"It's a lot of bunk,\" growled Durkin, who was stout and red of\ncountenance.\n\n\"Yeh? Well, Otto Ulrich don't put fifty thousand into bunk.\"\n\nDurkin whistled. \"You mean the German loosened up that much?\" he\nasked, and his eyes showed interest.\n\n\"Sure. He paid this Gurlone fifty thousand dollars--credit, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Well--maybe there's something in the mine story. But boy, you were\ndrunk when you saw that cricket. No cricket ever grew that big. You\nalways see things when you get too much rum in you.\"\n\n\"The hell you say,\" cried Maget. \"I saw it, I tell you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDurkin feigned elaborate politeness. \"Oh, all right, Frank. Have it\nyour own way. You saw a cricket that big and this Gurlone feller took\na couple of pink elephants out of his pocket to pay the check. Sure, I\nbelieve you.\"\n\nBut money never failed to attract the two tropical tramps. They were\nlooking for trouble, not work, and the idea of a raid on a rich mine\nin the Matto Grosso was just what they would enjoy.\n\nAn hour later, they had cornered a small, inoffensive peon named Juan.\nJuan, Maget and Durkin had discovered, had come out of the wilderness\nwith Professor Gurlone, the strange looking gentleman who spoke of a\nfabulously wealthy mine and commanded checks for fifty thousand\ndollars from a reputable banking firm. Such a man was worth watching.\n\nThe two rascals were expert at pumping the little half-breed. They\nknew peons, and the first thing that happened was that Durkin had\nslipped Juan several dollars and had pressed a large glass of whiskey\non the little man.\n\nThe conversation was in broken English and Spanish.\n\n\"Quien sabe?\"\n\nDurkin and Maget had this phrase flung at them often during the course\nof the talk with Juan, and there were many elaborate shrugs.\n\nThere was a mine, way back in the Matto Grosso, said Juan. He thought\nit might contain silver: there had been the shaft of an old mine\nthere. But now they were deep down in the ground, digging out reddish\nbrown ore, and the cavern smoked and smelled so badly a man could work\nbut an hour or two before being relieved. But the pay was very high.\nAlso, Juan, in his rambling way, spoke of grotesque animals. What were\nthese creatures like? asked Durkin. Then came a shrug, and Juan said\nthey were like nothing else on earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDurkin discounted the part of the story having to do with the strange\nanimals. He thought it was peon superstition. But now he was sure\nthere was a rich mine to be raided.\n\n\"It's a tough part of the Grosso,\" he said, turning to Maget.\n\n\"Sure. Hard to carry enough water and supplies to make it. Say, Juan,\nwho was that big Portuguee with Professor Gurlone? He's blind, ain't\nhe? His eyes were white as milk, and his face tanned black as river\nmud. Surely is a great big guy, and tough looking, too.\"\n\nDurkin drummed on the table, considering the matter, while Juan spoke\nof the big Portuguese. The swarthy man with the colorless blind eyes\nwas Espinosa, former owner of the mine. He had sold part of his claim\nto the Gurlones, but had remained with them as an assistant. Though\nblind, he knew the depths of the mine and could feel his way about,\nand direct the peons in their labors.\n\n\"I've got it,\" said Durkin, turning back to Juan and Maget. \"Juan,\nit's up to you. You've got to blaze the trail so we can follow you in.\nAnd you can steal food and cache it for use on the way, see? We'll\ncome along a day or so after the Gurlones.\"\n\nIt took some persuading to make Juan consent to their plot, but the\npeon yielded at last to money and the promise of part of the spoils.\n\"Maybe you can steal Gurlone's samples and they'll give us a line on\nwhat he's up to out there. Whether it's emeralds or diamonds or gold\nthat they're taking out of the mine.\"\n\nJuan was stupid and superstitious, like most of his fellows. He had\nobeyed orders, digging out the red ore, and that was all he knew. But\nprompted by the two tramps, he was ready for trouble, too.\n\nJuan told them that Professor Gurlone carried a small lead case which\nhe seemed to prize greatly.\n\n\"Get it, then,\" ordered Durkin.\n\nThe two tramps saw Gurlone's party start on the morrow. There were\nmany cases of supplies loaded into launches, some marked Glass, Acids,\nand so on. Then there were boxes of food and various things needed in\na jungle camp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJuan, their tool, was working with the other peons, and at ten o'clock\nin the morning the launches set out, pushing into the current of the\nMadeira.\n\nOld Gurlone, of the livid face, was in charge of one boat, and the\ngigantic Portuguese, with his colorless eyes and burned complexion,\nsat beside him.\n\nThat night, the two tropical tramps stole a small boat with a\none-cylinder motor, and started up the river.\n\nIt was a hard journey, but they were used to river and jungle work,\nand the object they had in view was enough to make them discount\ntrouble. They speculated upon what manner of treasure it was they\nwould find in the cavern of the Matto Grosso mine. It might be\nprecious stones, it might be gold. Certainly it was something very\nvaluable.\n\nThey carried little supplies, but they were heavily armed. For food,\nthey might hunt and also depend on the caches left by their friend,\nJuan the peon.\n\nThree hundred miles from Manaos, they came to the landing where old\nGurlone had unloaded his boats. The two tramps drew their own craft up\non shore a quarter of a mile away, keeping out of sight, and hid the\nboat in dense brush. Then they crept up the river bank, keeping out of\nsight of the boatmen, who were preparing for the return voyage, and\ncut into the jungle so as to strike the trail of the caravan ahead.\n\nFor several hours they followed the path easily. They found palm trees\nblazed with new marks, and these they were sure their friend Juan had\nleft for them. But the trail was easy to keep without these. The\nsupplies had been loaded on burros, which had been awaiting the\nboats.\n\nThat night, they camped beside a small stream. They were but\ntwenty-four hours behind Professor Gurlone and his party, and the food\nJuan had cached for them was in good condition.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were up at daybreak, and pressed on, armed to the teeth and ready\nfor a fight.\n\n\"What's that?\" said Durkin, stopping so suddenly that Maget ran into\nhim.\n\nThey had been walking at a swift pace along the jungle path, the giant\ntrees forming a canopy overhead. Monkeys screamed at them, birds\nflitted a hundred feet above them in the roof of the forest.\n\nThe sun beat on the jungle top, but few rays lightened the gloom\nbeneath.\n\nFrom up ahead sounded a frightful scream, followed by a long drawn out\nwailing. Maget glanced at Durkin, and the latter shrugged, and pressed\non. But he gripped his rifle tightly, for the cries were eery.\n\nFrom time to time the two stopped to catch better the direction of the\nwails. At last, they located the spot where the injured person lay.\n\nIt was under a great bombax tree, and on the shaded ground writhed a\nman. The two stopped, horrified at the squirming figure. The man was\ntearing at his face with his nails, and his countenance was bloody\nwith long scratches.\n\nHe cursed and moaned in Spanish, and Durkin, approaching closer,\nrecognized Juan the peon.\n\n\"Hey, Juan, what the hell's the matter? A snake bite you?\"\n\nThe bronzed face of the sturdy little peon writhed in agony. He\nscreamed in answer, he could not talk coherently. He mumbled, he\ngroaned, but they could not catch his words.\n\nAt his side lay a small lead container, and closer, as though he had\ndropped it after extracting it from its case, lay a tube some six\ninches in length. It was a queer tube, for it seemed to be filled\nwith smoky, pallid worms of light that writhed even as Juan writhed.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" asked Durkin gruffly, for he was alarmed at the\nbehavior of the peon. It seemed to both tramps that the man must have\ngone mad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey kept back from him, with ready guns. Juan shrieked, and it\nsounded as though he said he was burning up, in a great fire.\n\nSuddenly the peon staggered to his feet; as he pushed himself up, his\nhands gripped the tube, and he clawed at his face.\n\nPerplexity and horror were writ on the faces of the two tramps. Maget\nwas struck with pity for the unfortunate peon, who seemed to be\nsuffering the tortures of the damned. He was not a bad man, was Maget,\nbut rather a weakling who had a run of bad luck and was under the\nthumb of Durkin, a really hard character. Durkin, while astounded at\nthe actions of Juan, showed no pity.\n\nMaget stepped forward, to try and comfort Juan; the peon struck out at\nhim, and whirled around. But a few yards away was the bank of the\nstream, and Juan crashed into a black palm set with spines, caromed\noff it, and fell face downward into the water. The glass tube was\nsmashed and the pieces fell into the stream.\n\n\"God, he must be blind,\" groaned Maget. \"Poor guy, I've got to save\nhim.\"\n\n\"The hell with him,\" growled Durkin. He grasped his partner's arm and\nstared curiously down at the dying peon.\n\n\"Let go, I'll pull him out,\" said Maget, trying to wrench away from\nDurkin.\n\n\"He's done for. Why worry about a peon?\" said Durkin. \"Look at those\nfish!\"\n\nThe muddy waters of the stream had parted, and dead fish were rising\nabout the body of Juan. But not about the dying man so much as close\nto the spot where the broken tube had fallen. White bellies up, the\nfish died as though by magic.\n\n\"Let's--let's get the hell back to Manoas, Bill,\" said Maget in a\nsickly voice. \"This--this is too much for me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA nameless fear, which had been with Maget ever since the beginning of\nthe venture, was growing more insistent.\n\n\"What?\" cried Durkin. \"Turn back now? The hell you say! That damn peon\ngot into a fight with somebody and maybe got bit by a snake later.\nWe'll go on and get that treasure.\"\n\n\"But--but what made those fish come up that way?\" said Maget, his\nbrows creased in perplexity.\n\nDurkin shrugged. \"What's the difference? We're O. K., ain't we?\"\n\nIn spite of the stout man's bravado, it was evident that he, too, was\ndisturbed at the strange happenings. He kept voicing aloud the\nquestion in his mind; what was in the queer tube?\n\nBut he forced Maget to go on. Without Juan, the peon, to leave them\ncaches of food on the trail, they would have a difficult time getting\nprovender, but both were trained jungle travelers and could find fruit\nand shoot enough game to keep them going.\n\nDay after day they marched on, not far from the rear of the party\nbefore them. They took care to keep off Gurlone's heels, for they did\nnot wish their presence to be discovered.\n\nWhen they had been on the journey, which led them east, for four days,\nthe two rascals came to a waterless plateau, which stretched before\nthem in dry perspective. Before they came to the end of this, they\nknew what real thirst was, and their tongues were black in their\nmouths before they caught the curling smoke of fires in the valley\nwhere they knew the mine must be.\n\n\"That's the mine,\" gasped Durkin, pointing to the smoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was setting in golden splendor at their backs; they crept\nforward, using great boulders and piles of reddish earth, strange to\nthem, for cover. Finally they reached the trail which led to the hills\noverlooking the valley, and a panorama spread before them which amazed\nthem because of its elaborateness.\n\nIt seemed more like a stage scene than a wilderness picture. Straight\nahead of them, as they lay flat on their stomachs and peered at the\nbig camp, yawned the black mouth of a large cavern. This, they were\nsure, was the mine itself. Close by this mouth stood a stone hut. It\nwas clear that this building had something to do with the ore, perhaps\na refining plant, Durkin suggested.\n\nThere were long barracks for the peons, inside a barbed wire\nenclosure, and they could see the little men lounging now about\ncampfires, where frying food was being prepared. Also, there was a\nlong, low building with many windows in it, and houses for supplies\nand for the use of the owners of the camp.\n\n\"Looks like they were ready in case of a fight,\" said Durkin at last.\n\"That fence around the peons looks like they might be havin' trouble.\"\n\n\"Some camp,\" breathed Maget.\n\n\"We got to find somethin' to drink,\" said Durkin. \"Come on.\"\n\nThey worked their way about the rim of the valley, and in doing so\ncaught glimpses of Professor Gurlone, the elderly man they had spotted\nin Manaos, and also saw the big Portuguese with his sightless eyes.\n\nAt the other side of the valley, they came on a spring which flowed to\nthe east and disappeared under ground farther down.\n\n\"Funny water, ain't it?\" said Durkin, lying down on his stomach to\nsuck up the milky water.\n\nBut they were not in any mood to be particular about the fluids they\ndrank. The long dry march across the arid lands separating the camp\nfrom the rest of the world had taken all moisture from their throats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaget, drinking beside his partner, saw that the water glinted and\nsparkled, though the sun was below the opposite rim of the valley. It\nseemed that greenish, silvery specks danced in the milky fluid.\n\n\"Boy, that's good,\" Durkin finally found time to say, \"I feel like I\ncould fight a wildcat.\"\n\nThe water did, indeed, impart a feeling of exhilaration to the two\ntramps. They crept up close to the roof of the parallel shaft which\nthey had seen from the other side of the valley, and looked down into\nthe camp again.\n\nProfessor Gurlone of the livid face and Espinosa the blind Portuguese,\nwere talking to a big man whose golden beard shone in the last rays of\nthe sun.\n\n\"That's the old bird's son,\" said Durkin, \"that Juan told us about.\nYoung Gurlone.\"\n\nA rumbling, pleasant laugh floated on the breeze, issuing from the big\nyouth's throat. The wind was their way, now, and the valley breathed\nforth an unpleasant odor of chemicals and tainted meat.\n\n\"Funny place,\" said Maget. \"Say, I got a hell of a headache, Bill.\"\n\n\"So've I,\" grunted Durkin. \"Maybe that water ain't as good as it\nseemed at first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey lay in a small hollow, watching the activity of the camp. The\npeons were in their pen, and it was evident that they were being\nwatched by the owners of the camp.\n\nAs purple twilight fell across the strange land, the two tramps began\nto notice the dull sounds which came to their ears from time to time.\n\n\"That's funny thunder,\" said Maget nervously. \"If I didn't know it was\nthunder, I'd swear some big frogs were around here.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell. Maybe it's an earthquake,\" said Durkin irritatedly. \"For\nGod's sake, quit your bellyachin'. You've done nothin' but whine ever\nsince we left Juan.\"\n\n\"Well, who could blame me--\" began Maget. He broke off suddenly, the\npique in his voice turned to a quiver of fear, as he grasped Durkin's\narm. \"Oh, look,\" he gasped.\n\nDurkin, seeing his partner's eyes staring at a point directly behind\nhim, leaped up and scrambled away, thinking that a snake must be about\nto strike him.\n\nHe turned round when he felt he was far enough away, and saw that the\nground was moving near the spot where he had been lying.\n\nThe earth was heaving, as though ploughed by a giant share; a blunt,\npurplish head, which seemed too fearful to be really alive, showed\nthrough the broken ground, and a worm began to draw its purple length\nfrom the depths. It was no snake, but a gigantic angleworm, and as it\ncame forth, foot after foot, the two watched with glazed eyes.\n\nMaget swallowed. \"I've seen 'em two feet long,\" he said. \"But never\nlike that.\"\n\nDurkin, however, when he realized that the loathsome creature could\nnot see them and was creeping blindly towards them with its ugly, fat\nbody creasing and elongating, picked up rocks and began to destroy the\nmonstrous worm. He cursed as he worked.\n\nDull red blood spattered them, and a fetid odor from the gashes caused\nthem to retch, but they finally cut the thing in two, and then they\nmoved away from there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dull rumblings beneath them frightened Maget, and Durkin too,\nthough the latter tried to brazen it out.\n\n\"Come on, it's gettin' dark. We can take a look in their mine now.\"\n\nMaget, whimpering, followed. The booming sounds were increasing.\n\nBut Durkin slipped down the hillside, and Maget followed into the\nvalley. They crept past the stone shack, which they noticed was\npadlocked heavily.\n\nDurkin stopped suddenly, and cursed. \"I've cut my foot,\" he said.\n\"These damn shoes are gone, all right, from that march. But come on,\nnever mind.\"\n\nThey crept to the mouth of the cavern and peered in. \"Ugh,\" said\nMaget.\n\nHe drew back with a shudder. The floor of the mine was covered with a\ngrey slush, in which were seething white masses of slugs weaving in\nthe slime. A powerful, rotten odor breathed in their faces, as though\nthey stood in the mouth of a great giant.\n\n\"Ah!\" yelled Durkin, throwing his arms across his face.\n\nThe greenish, ghostly light which emanated from the slime was weaker\nthan moonlight, just enough to see by; a vast shadow hovered above\ntheir heads, as though a gigantic bat flew there. The sweep and beat\nof great wings drove them back, and they fled in terror from such\nawful corruption.\n\nBut the flying monster, with a wing spread of eight feet, dashed past\nthem, and silhouetted against the rising moon like a goblin. Then came\nanother, and finally a flock of the big birds.\n\nDurkin and Maget ran away, passing the stone house which stood near\nthe cavern's mouth. The booming sounds from the bowels of the earth\nfilled their ears now, and it was not thunder; no, it issued from the\ndepths of the mine.\n\n\"We--we got to get somethin' to eat,\" said Durkin, as they paused near\none of the shacks, in which shone a light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSounds of voices came from the interior. They crept closer, and\nlistened outside the window. Inside, they could see Espinosa, Gurlone\nsenior, and the big youth with the golden beard, Gurlone junior.\n\n\"Yes, father,\" the young man was saying. \"I believe we had better\nleave, at once. It's getting dangerous. I've reached the five million\nmark now, with the new process, and it is ready to work with or sell,\njust as we wish.\"\n\n\"Hear that?\" whispered Durkin triumphantly. \"Five million!\"\n\n\"It's all ready, in the stone house,\" said young Gurlone.\n\n\"Why should we leave now?\" said old Gurlone, his livid face working.\n\"Now, when we are just at the point of success in our great\nexperiments? So far, while we have struck many creatures of abnormal\ngrowth, still, we have overcome them.\"\n\n\"Well, father, there is something in the mine now which makes it too\ndangerous to work. That is, until they are put out of the way. You can\nhear them now.\"\n\nThe three inside the shack listened, and so did Durkin and Maget. The\nbooming sounds swelled louder and the earth of the valley shook.\n\n\"I t'ink we better go,\" said Espinosa gruffly. \"I agree with your son,\nProfessor.\"\n\n\"No, no. We can conquer this, what ever it is.\"\n\n\"You see, father, while you were away, we broke through into a natural\ncavern, an underground river. It was then that the trouble started.\nYou know the effect of the stuff on the insects and birds. It enlarged\na cricket one hundred times. You saw that yourself. Six of the peons\nhave disappeared--they didn't run away, either. They went down the\nshaft and never came back.\"\n\n\"Oh, they probably fell into the water and drowned,\" said old Gurlone\nimpatiently. \"Even if they did not, we can kill anything with these\nlarge bore rifles.\"\n\n\"We'd better pull out and let it alone for a while,\" said young\nGurlone gravely. \"The peons have been trying to bolt for several days.\nThey'd be gone now if I hadn't penned them in and electrified the\nfence.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaget put his hand on his friend's shoulder. \"I'm starving,\" he\nwhispered.\n\nDurkin nodded, and they turned away, toward what they had marked as a\nsupply shack. They heard a low murmur from the peons' pen, as they\nbegan to break off the hasps of the lock which held the door of the\nstorehouse.\n\nThey got inside with little trouble, and began to feel about in the\ndark for food. They located biscuits and canned goods which they split\nopen, and these they wolfed hungrily, listening carefully for sounds\nfrom outside.\n\n\"Here they come,\" said Maget, gripping Durkin's arm.\n\nThey looked out the window of the supply shack, and saw old Gurlone\nissue from the building outside which the two tramps had been\nlistening. In one hand, the old Professor, brave as a lion, carried an\nold fashioned double-barreled elephant gun, and the rays from a\npowerful electric torch shone across the barrel.\n\nAt least, they thought the bizarre figure was old Gurlone, from the\nsize. For the man was clad in a black, shiny suit, and over his head\nwas a flapping hood of the same material in which were large eyeholes\nof green glass. Behind this strange form came a larger one, armed also\nwith a big bore rifle and with another powerful flashlight.\n\nThe blind Portuguese was armed, too, but he was not clad in the black\nsuit. He took his stand beside the mouth of the cavern, and waited\nwhile the two Gurlones entered the mine.\n\n\"My foot hurts,\" said Durkin suddenly, breaking the silence.\n\n\"I'm going out and see what happens,\" said Maget.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDurkin limped after Maget, who now took the lead. They crept close as\npossible to the mine opening, and saw the big Portuguese standing\nthere in silence, listening carefully. Any sounds the two might have\nmade were drowned in the great bellowing from within the cavern.\n\nThese noises, so like the croak of bullfrogs but magnified a thousand\ntimes, were terrifying to the heart.\n\nThe sweep of wings sounded on the night air, and Espinosa drew back\nand squatted close to the ground, as immense green creatures, flying\non dusty wings, issued from the mine.\n\n\"God, those are moths,\" breathed Maget.\n\nYes, unmistakably, they were moths, as large as condors. The green\nones, but for their size, were lunar moths, familiar enough to the two\ntramps. More bats came, disturbed by the entrance of the two Gurlones.\n\nDurkin broke, then. \"I'm--I'm--I guess you're right, Maget,\" he\nwhispered, in a terrified voice. \"We should have never come. If my\nfoot wasn't hurt, I'd start for the river now. Curse it, what a\nplace!\"\n\nThe booming, vast croaks filled the whole valley, reverberating\nthrough the hills. Wails sounded from the peon camp.\n\nThe big Portuguese was shouting to the Gurlones. \"Come out, come out!\"\n\nMaget gripped his own rifle, and stood up, bravely. His fear, though\nit was great, seemed to have brought out the better side of the man,\nwhile Durkin, so brave at first, had cracked under the strain.\n\n\"Look out, they'll see you,\" whimpered Durkin.\n\nMaget strode forward. A blast of fetid, stinking air struck his face,\nand he choked. The noises were now ear-splitting, but above the\nbellows came the sounds of the big rifles, the echoes booming through\nthe recesses of the cavern.\n\nThen the two Gurlones, running madly, burst from the mine entrance.\n\n\"Run,\" they screamed. \"Run for your life, Espinosa!\"\n\n\"I'll help you,\" cried Maget, and Durkin could detain him no longer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Gurlones hardly noticed the newcomer, as they ran madly towards\nthe shelter of their houses. Espinosa joined them, going swiftly in\nspite of his blind eyes.\n\nThe croaking made Maget's brain scream with the immensity of the\nsound. Luminous, white disks, three feet in diameter, glared at him,\nand the creature, which progressed with jerky leaps toward him, almost\nfilled the mouth of the mine.\n\nIt was hot in pursuit of the fleeing Gurlones. It squatted and then\njumped, and presently it was out in the night air.\n\nIts form was that of a gigantic frog, but it stood some twenty feet in\nheight, and from its throat sounded the terrific bellowing which\nrivalled the thunder.\n\nMaget bravely stepped forward, and began to fire into the huge, soft\nbody. The great mouth opened, and as the dum-dum bullets tore gashes\nin the blackish green batrachian, the thunderous croaks took on a note\nof pain.\n\nThe odor of the creature was horrible. Maget could scarcely draw his\nbreath as he fired the contents of the magazine into the big animal.\nTwo more jumps brought the frog almost to Maget's feet, and the\ntropical tramp felt a whiskerlike tentacle touch his face, and bad\nsmelling slime covered him.\n\nThe frog was blind, without doubt, from its underground life, but the\ntentacles seemed to be the way it finally located its prey, for it\nturned on Maget and made a final snap at him. The great jaws closed\nlike the flap of hell, and Maget leaped back with a cry of triumphant\nterror.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bullets had finally stopped the big frog, but at its heels came a\nstrange, jellylike creature, not quite as bulky as the frog, but\npushing along on its legs and with a tail some eight feet thick and\nfifteen feet in length. This, too, evidently a polywog, was blind,\nwith whitened discs for eyes, but it slid along at a rapid rate\nbecause of its size. Maget's gun was empty; he turned so flee, but the\npolywog stopped and sniffed at the thick blood of its fellow. Then, to\nMaget's relief, it began to hungrily devour its companion.\n\nUtterly filthy, and ferocious, the polywog in silence snapped great\nchunks from the dead giant frog.\n\n\"Hello. Who are you?\"\n\nMaget turned, having forgotten the amenities of life in the\nexcitement. Professor Gurlone and his son, still clad in their black\nsuits, but with their helmets off, were standing beside him, clutching\ntheir guns and lights.\n\nThe big Portuguese, Espinosa, appeared, and Durkin was beside him.\n\n\"Why,\" said Maget, between gasps, \"we just happened to be out\nexploring, and we saw your camp. We were on our way in when we heard\nthe noises and came to investigate.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said old Gurlone. \"What made you head in this direction, and\nwhere's your outfit?\"\n\n\"Oh, we cached most of it back there,\" said Maget. \"My partner's hurt\nhis foot, so he can't walk well. Isn't that so, Durkin?\"\n\n\"Yeh,\" growled Durkin. \"I got a sore foot, all right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Gurlone was suspicious of the vague story which Maget and Durkin\nconcocted as the explanation of their presence in the valley. But\nevidently the Professor was too worried about the situation in which\nhe and his friends were, to question the two tramps very closely. In\nfact, he seemed rather glad that he had two more pairs of hands to aid\nhim and he thanked Maget for his bravery.\n\nThey dispatched the great polywog as it tore its parent to bits, and\nthen the five men, the two Gurlones, Espinoza, Maget, and the limping,\ncursing Durkin, retired to one of the shacks.\n\nThe living quarters of the Gurlones was quite elaborate. There were\nmany books on rough shelves, and there was a small bench filled with\nglass phials and chemicals, though the main laboratory was in one of\nthe long buildings.\n\nProfessor Gurlone poured drinks for the five, and welcomed Durkin and\nMaget as allies.\n\n\"We'll need every man we can get, if we are to cope with these great\ncreatures,\" said old Gurlone. \"The peons are too frightened to be of\nuse. Luckily, it was a frog we came upon on the banks of the\nsubterranean river. There is no telling how many more creatures of the\nsame or greater size may be down there. We will have to destroy them,\nevery one.\"\n\nMaget and Durkin shuddered. \"Say,\" blurted Durkin, his face working\nnervously, \"how the hell did that frog get so big? I thought I was\nseein' things, Professor.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Professor Gurlone. \"You see, the ore in the mine\ncontains radium, that is, salts of radium. It is a pitchblende\ndeposit, and it happens to be so rich in radium content that\nthroughout the ages it has affected all the life in the cavern. The\narid land surrounding the ore--this has been, generally, one of the\ncharacteristics of radium deposits--has kept most of the jungle\ncreatures away, but underground beings such as reptiles, worms and\nfrogs, have gradually become immune to the effects of the ore and have\ngrown prodigiously and abnormally under the stimulation of the rays\ngiven off by the radium.\n\n\"Now, this is nothing strange in itself, but never before has such a\nrich deposit been discovered, so that the amounts of radium available\nhave been too small to really check its effect on growth in animals.\nThat is our chief scientific object in coming here: we realized, from\nSenor Espinosa's description of the played-out silver mine he had, and\nfrom his loss of sight, that he had stumbled upon a valuable deposit\nof radium. It usually occurs with silver, that is, the uranium mother\nore does, through the disintegration of which radium is formed. The\ncontent of radium per ton in this ore proved unbelievably rich: we\nwere delighted. I have always suspected that the animal cell might be\nstimulated into abnormal growth by exposure to radium salts, for such\na thing already has been hinted at in the scientific world. Not till\nour chance came here, however, has enough radium been available for\nthe experiments.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaget and Durkin listened with open mouths. Radium meant but vague\nthings to them. They had heard of radium paint which shone in the dark\non the dials of watches and clothes, but of the properties of the\nmetal and its salts they were utterly ignorant.\n\n\"That radium stuff is what makes the funny light in that mine, then?\"\nasked Maget.\n\n\"Exactly. The radio-activity of the elements in the ore give off the\nlight. There are three rays, the alpha, beta and gamma, and--\"\n\nThe professor forgot himself in a lecture on the properties of radium.\n\nDurkin, breaking in, asked, slyly. \"Is this radium worth as much as\nsilver?\"\n\nYoung Kenneth Gurlone laughed, and even old Professor Gurlone smiled.\n\"Radium is worth more than gold or diamonds or platinum. Its value is\nfabulous. We have five million dollars worth already, in the form of\nthe chloride.\"\n\n\"Whew,\" whistled Durkin.\n\nHe glanced sidewise at Maget.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor Gurlone, \"five million dollars worth of it!\nThose great monsters who have been developed throughout the ages by\nthe action of the radium rays on their bodies, causing them to grow so\nprodigiously, are but incidents. We must destroy them, so that our\nwork cannot be interfered with. We must use dynamite, blow them to\nbits. They are powerful enough to crush the stone bank by the mine\nmouth and ruin the labors of the past two years, gentlemen.\"\n\nArmed, and once more fortified with whiskey, the five made their way\noutside. The moon was darkened by an immense shadow, as one of the\ngiant bats winged its way over their heads. But there were no more\nmonster frogs. The ugly, bulky shapes of the dead polywog and its\nparent lay before them.\n\n\"We are safe for the moment,\" said Professor Gurlone. \"Go and quiet\nthe peons, Espinosa: they will listen to you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe peons still wailed in terror; the blind Espinosa slipped silently\naway.\n\n\"Come,\" said Professor Gurlone, to his son and to Maget and Durkin. \"I\nwill show you the laboratory, so that you can understand better the\neffects of radium on growth.\"\n\nThe professor led them to the long, low, many-windowed building\nnearby, and flooded it with light. It contained cage after cage in\nwhich were monkeys, pumas, and various jungle folk. These creatures\nset up a chattering and howling at the light and intruders.\n\nMaget glanced curiously about him. He saw shining vials and glassware\nof queer shapes on long black tables, and tubes of chemicals. There\nwere immense screens of dull lead. \"Those are for protection,\" said\nProfessor Gurlone, \"as are the lead-cloth suits we wear. Otherwise we\nwould be burned by radium rays.\"\n\nMaget looked about, to see if his partner was listening, but he had\ngone away.\n\nHowever, Maget was intensely interested. He went from cage to cage as\nProfessor Gurlone, rather in the manner of a man giving a lecture to\nstudents, pointed out animal after animal that had been treated by the\nradium.\n\n\"This,\" said the professor, \"is a monkey which usually attains a\nheight of two feet. You can see for yourself that it is now larger\nthan a gorilla.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe horrible, malformed creature bared its teeth and shook its bars in\nrage, but it was weak, evidently, from the treatment accorded it. Its\nhair was burned off in spots, and its eyes were almost white.\n\nThere was a jaguar, and this beast seemed to have burst its skin in\nits effort to grow as large as three of its kind.\n\n\"You see, we have not so much time as nature,\" said Professor Gurlone.\n\"These beasts cannot be enlarged too rapidly, or they would die. They\nmust be protected from the direct rays of the radium, which is\nrefined. In the ore, the action is more gradual and gentle, since it\nis less concentrated. But the metal itself would burn the vital organs\nout of these creatures, cause them to be struck blind, shrivel them up\ninside and kill them in a few minutes in the quantity we have. We\nexpose them bit by bit, allowing more and more time as they begin to\ngrow immune to the rays. Here, you see, are smaller creatures which\nhave grown some eight or ten times beyond normal size.\"\n\nAll the animals seemed the worse for wear. Maget, his brain reeling,\nyet was beginning to grasp what radium did to one. It was not gold\nthat you could pick up and carry away.\n\n\"If a man touched that radium,\" he asked, \"what would happen to him?\"\n\n\"Just what I said would happen to the animals if we did not give it to\nthem gradually,\" said Gurlone, with a wave of his hand. \"It would kill\nhim, strike him down as though by invisible poison gas. His heart and\nlungs would cease to function, pernicious anemia would set in, as the\nred corpuscles in his blood perished by millions. He would be struck\nblind, fall down and die in agony.\"\n\nTo Maget came the picture of the unfortunate Juan. As though answering\nhis unasked question, Professor Gurlone went on. \"We had a peon coming\nup with us,\" he said. \"His name was Juan. He stole my sample-case,\nwhich contained an ounce of radium chloride, and ran off with it. If\nhe opens it, it will kill him in just that way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaget shivered. \"But--but didn't it hurt you to carry it?\" he asked.\n\n\"No. For it was incased in a lead container some two inches in\nthickness, and the rays cannot penetrate such a depth of lead. They\nare trapped in the metal.\"\n\n\"Father, father, you're wasting time,\" broke in Kenneth Gurlone,\nshaking his yellow head. \"We must act at once. The peons are almost\nmad with fear. Even Espinosa cannot quiet them. And every moment is\nprecious, for the monsters may break forth.\"\n\nBut Maget was looking nervously about for Durkin. Where was he? Durkin\nhad his mind on the treasure, and--\n\nAs they turned toward the door, the professor saying. \"The rays from\nthe ore, which is not so concentrated as the purified metal, do not\nkill--\" Durkin suddenly appeared.\n\nHe carried his rifle at his hip, and he limped and cursed angrily.\n\"Come across,\" shouted Durkin. \"Give me the key to that stone house.\nSnap into it, and no argument.\"\n\n\"The key--to the stone bank?\" repeated old Gurlone.\n\n\"Yes. I'll give you five counts to throw it over--then I'll shoot you\nand take it,\" snarled Durkin savagely. \"I want that treasure, whatever\nit is, and I'll have it. One ... two ... three....\" The tramp sent a\nshot over their heads as a warning.\n\n\"Hey, Bill, easy, easy,\" pleaded Maget. \"That stuff is radium. It'll\nruin you, boy!\"\n\n\"Shut up, you yeller-bellied bum,\" snarled Durkin. \"Four....\"\n\nA tinkle of metal came on the stone floor of the laboratory, as old\nGurlone tossed his keys to Durkin.\n\n\"Don't go in that shack,\" cried young Gurlone. \"It'll be your death,\nman--\"\n\n\"Liars,\" yelled Durkin, and backed out the door.\n\n\"H'm,\" said old Gurlone, turning to Maget. \"So you came to rob us,\neh?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Maget thought of Juan, and then he knew he did not want Durkin, in\nspite of his failings, to perish so. He ran for the door, and across\nthe clearing.\n\n\"Durkin--Bill--wait, it's Frank--\"\n\nGreat bellowings sounded from the bowels of the earth, but Maget\nignored these in his effort to save his partner. Durkin had the\npadlock off the stone shack, and pulled back the door.\n\nAs the door disclosed the interior, Maget could see that a greenish\nhaze filled the entire building. Wan liquid light streamed forth like\nheavy fluid.\n\nBravely, to save his pal from death, Maget ran forward. But Durkin had\nentered the stone shack.\n\nMaget went to the very door of the building. Durkin was inside, and\nMaget could see his partner's thick form as a black object in the\nstrange, thick air.\n\nAn eery scream came suddenly from Durkin's lips; Maget wrung his hands\nand called for help.\n\n\"Come out, Bill, come out,\" he cried.\n\nDurkin evidently tried to obey, for he turned toward the door. But his\nknees seemed to give way beneath him, he threw his arm across his eyes\nas he sank to the ground, crying in agony, incoherent sounds issuing\nfrom his lips.\n\nShriek after shriek the unfortunate man uttered. As Maget made a dash\nforward to take a chance with death and rescue his friend, Professor\nGurlone and his son Kenneth ran up and threw a black cloak over the\ntramp.\n\nThe three entered the shack of death. Maget, not entirely covered,\nfelt his heart give a terrific jump, and he gasped for breath. Durkin\nwas quivering on the floor which was lined with lead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRound vials stood about the room like a battery of search-lights, and\nfrom these emanated the deadly green haze.\n\nBut almost before Maget touched his pal, Durkin was dead. Curled up as\nthough sewed together by heavy cords. Durkin lay in a ball, a shaking\nmass of burned flesh.\n\nThe two Gurlones pushed out ahead of them, and raised their hands.\nThey had on their black suits and their helmets.\n\n\"It is too late to do anything for him now,\" said Kenneth Gurlone\nsadly. \"He was headstrong. You can see for yourself that the five\nmillion dollars takes care of itself. Certain death goes with it if\nyou are unprotected. These lead-cloth suits will keep off the rays for\na short time. We always wear them when we are working with the metal,\neven when we have a lead screen.\"\n\n\"Poor Bill,\" sobbed Maget. \"It's terrible!\"\n\nProfessor Gurlone shrugged. \"It was his own fault. He was a thief and\nhe would not let us stop him. I hope it's been a lesson to you,\nMaget.\"\n\n\"Yes, I want to help you,\" said Maget. \"If you'll keep me with you,\nI'll work for you and be straight. Give me a chance.\"\n\n\"Good. Then shake hands on it,\" said Kenneth, and they clasped hands\nfirmly.\n\nEspinosa appeared from the darkness. \"The peons are mad with terror,\"\nhe said morosely. \"They cannot be held much longer. They will revolt.\"\n\n\"Well, we must kill the creatures in the cavern: that will quiet them\nmore than anything else,\" said Professor Gurlone.\n\n\"Better close the stone shack,\" said Kenneth.\n\nBut as he spoke, a vast shape, another giant frog, appeared in the\nentrance of the shaft.\n\n\"Get some dynamite and fuses,\" ordered Professor Gurlone quietly.\n\"Come on Kenneth, and you, Maget, if you care to risk your life. You\nneed not do so unless you wish to.\"\n\nBravely, the older man led the way towards the croaking monster. The\nground shook at its approach. It was heading for the bodies of the\ndead frog and polywog, bent on a search for food. Evidently these vast\ncreatures were forced to prey upon one another for sustenance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rifles spoke, and Maget and the professor, in their black suits,\nprotected by the lead-cloth and helmets from the rays, advanced. They\npoured bullet after bullet into the frog.\n\nKenneth came running to join them, and Espinosa stood by. Kenneth had\ndynamite bombs with fuses ready for lighting and throwing. He also\nbrought more ammunition, and the three armed themselves to the teeth.\n\nIt was well after midnight when they started into the mine. They knew\nthey must act quickly or retreat, for the bellowing sounded nearer and\nnearer the surface of the earth.\n\nEach man carried big, powerful flashlights, and the three entered the\nmine shaft and walked across the seething slugs into the bowels of the\nearth.\n\n\"Stay close together,\" ordered old Gurlone.\n\nThe mine was easy to descend for the first hundred yards. It led in a\ngentle slope downward. The way, save for a few giant bats and moths,\nand the big maggots, was clear. The greenish haze, not so bright as\nthat in the death shack, enveloped them, but they needed their flashes\nto see clearly.\n\n\"Slowly, take it easy,\" counseled old Gurlone.\n\nThe mine spread out now, and began a steeper descent. The air was\npoor, and it was hard to breathe through the mask. Maget, his heart\nthumping mightily, listened to the roaring within the depths of the\nmine.\n\nNow the ground seemed to drop away before them. Maget could hear the\nrunning of water, the underground river, and every now and then there\ncame an immense splash, as if some great whale had thrown itself about\nin the water.\n\nA terrifically loud hissing filled their ears, and suddenly, before\nthem, showed an utterly white snake with a head as big as a barrel.\nIts white eyes glared sightlessly, but its tongue stuck forth for\nseveral feet.\n\nKenneth Gurlone coolly tossed a lighted bomb at the creature: the\nexplosion shattered their ear-drums, but it also smashed the serpent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe writhing, wriggling coils, bigger than the body of a horse,\nslashed about, dangerously near. They picked themselves up, and pushed\non, keeping close to the right wall.\n\nA great bat smashed against Maget, and knocked the light out of his\nhand, but the blow was a glancing one, and he was able to retrieve his\nlight and hurry on.\n\nThey were far from the entrance now. The hole which had been broken\nthrough by the peons showed before them, and they could see milky\nwater dashing over black rocks.\n\nPallid eyes looked at them, and they knew they gazed upon another of\nthe giant frogs. They tossed a bomb at the creature, and blew a jagged\nhole in his back. No sooner had he begun to die than there came a\nsudden rush of other monsters and a feast began.\n\n\"Throw, all together,\" yelled Kenneth Gurlone.\n\nInto the vast mass of creatures, who crowded one another in the river\nfor their share of the spoils, they threw bomb after bomb. The\ndynamite deafened them, and acrid fumes choked them, but they fired\ntheir rifles at the prodigious animals and there, in the big river\ncavern, was a seething mass of horrible life, dying in agony.\n\nThe bellowings and hissings sounded louder, so loud that the earth\nshook as if actuated by a mighty earthquake.\n\nMaget gripped Kenneth Gurlone's arm. \"My bombs are gone,\" he shouted.\n\nHe had but a few rounds of ammunition left, and still more of the\ngiant reptiles appeared. A centipede with its creeping, horrible legs\ntopped the mass of squirming matter; they could see the terrific sting\nof the creature, so deadly when but a fraction of an inch long, and\nwhich was now at least a foot, armed with poison.\n\nThere came the rush of more bats and moths, a rush that threw the\nthree men off their feet.\n\n\"We must have opened the hole more with our bombs,\" shrieked old\nGurlone. \"The dead bodies attract the other creatures, more and more\nof them are coming. It is impossible; we cannot deal with them all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vast gobbling of the great animals in the river below them was so\nprodigious they could not grasp it. It seemed it must be optical\nillusion. In a few moments, the dead had been eaten, swallowed whole,\nand fights were progressing between the victors.\n\nThey tossed the rest of their bombs, fired the remaining ammunition,\nand as they prepared to retreat, several of the big creatures slopped\nover and started up the river bank into the mine shaft.\n\nThey ran for their lives, the three. Madly, with the earth shaking\nbehind them as they were pursued by a hopping monster of a beetle with\nimmense mandibles reaching out at them, they dashed for the open air.\n\nGiant moths and bats struck at them, and Maget fell down several times\nbefore he reached the outside, and he was bruised and out of breath.\n\n\"Come on, there are too many to fight,\" gasped old Gurlone, throwing\noff the lead suit.\n\nBut there was no need to talk. The creatures, disturbed by the bombs,\nhad collected in one spot and, shown the way out by one of their\nnumber, were coming.\n\nEspinosa, with Kenneth Gurlone holding his hand, ran swiftly for the\nhills surrounding the valley. Maget helped old Professor Gurlone, who\nwas so out of breath that he could scarcely move.\n\nThe great beetle which had been pursuing them was the first to break\nforth into the valley. Turning back for a look over his shoulder,\nMaget saw the thing pause, but the cavern belched forth a vast array\nof monsters, the beasts roaring, hissing, bellowing, in an increasing\nmass of sound.\n\nThey swarmed over the ground, and giant bats and moths winged their\nway about the heads of the monsters.\n\nAt the rim of the valley, the four men paused.\n\n\"God help the peons,\" said Kenneth Gurlone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the horde of monsters swelled more and more; the bats and moths\nwinged in mad frenzy about the open door of the radium shack. There\nwere great beetles, centipedes, ants, crickets, hopping, crawling\nthings, and grotesquely immense in size. Fights progressed here and\nthere, but the majority of them were carried along in the sweep of the\nmultitude.\n\n\"See, the radium kills those who get too close,\" said Professor\nGurlone, in a hushed voice.\n\nThe giant moths and bats were unable to withstand the lure of the\ngreen light. They flew with mad beatings of wings straight for the\nopen door of the death house, and many of the great creatures,\nattracted by the light and urged on by an unexplainable force which\nsent them to death like gnats and moths in a flame, crowded near to\nthe death-dealing radium.\n\nNot until the whole shack was covered with quivering forms of the\ndead, did the other creatures veer off and with hops, creepings and\nmyriad giant legs, begin to cover the whole valley.\n\nThe stone walls of the death shack had crumpled in with the weight;\nthe other buildings, more lightly built, gave at once, with crackings\nand crashings.\n\nThe four men were powerless to assist the unfortunate peons, who were\ntrapped in their barracks. The charged wires stopped many of the big\nbeasts, but soon the electric light was short-circuited, and the\nvalley, in the moonlight, was a seething mass of fighting, dying,\nfeasting monsters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOther sounds, besides those made by the big creatures, came to the\nears of the stricken men on the hillside. The breaking of glass, the\ncries of the jungle animals trapped in their cages, the shrieks of\ndying peons who were eaten at a gulp by the big frogs or stung to\ndeath, impaled on the mandibles of some great stinging centipede.\n\nIn the spot where the radium death shack had been, was a pulpy mass of\nlivid, smoky light.\n\nNow the bowl of the valley was filled as by some vast jelly. The\ncreatures were slopping over the walls, and battling together.\n\nThe shambles was not yet over, but the four could remain no longer.\nThey made their way down the hillside and struck out across the arid\nlands.\n\nMaget, the tramp, became the leader. He was a trained jungle man, and\nit was he who finally brought them safely to the Madeira.\n\nHe was their strong man, the one who found the trail and located roots\nand fruit for the party to subsist on. They nearly perished in the\ntrip for lack of water, but again, Maget was able to supply them with\nroots which kept them from dying in agony.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey lay upon the river bank now, exhausted but alive. Maget had\nassisted old Gurlone, acted as his staff, half carried him the last\nmiles of the trip.\n\nTheir clothes were almost gone, they were burned to crisps by the\ntropic sun. Flies and other insects had taken their toll. But Maget\nhad brought them through.\n\nThe tall, thin fellow's hair had turned utterly white. But so had his\nsoul.\n\n\"You're a good man, Maget,\" said Professor Gurlone. \"You have saved\nus, and you have been brave as a lion.\"\n\nMaget shook his head. \"Professor,\" he said. \"I came into the jungle to\nrob you. Durkin and I bribed Juan to steal that radium, and I feel\nresponsible for his death. We thought you had diamonds or gold in the\nMatto Grosso, and we were after it. That's why I am here.\"\n\n\"You have repaid your debt to us, more than fully,\" said Kenneth,\nholding out his hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Espinosa.\n\n\"Will you keep me with you, then?\" asked Maget anxiously. \"Are--will\nyou go back there?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Gurlone stared at him, and then said, in a surprised tone,\n\"Why, of course!\"\n\n\"But the monsters?\" asked Maget.\n\n\"Many of them will die in the outer air,\" said Gurlone. \"The survivors\nof the battles will start eating the dead. They will finally clear\naway the debris of dead creatures about the radium shack. As each is\nexposed to the rays of the concentrated metal, it will die. The others\nwill eat it, and be killed in turn. Thus, they will be destroyed. If\nthere are any survivors after this evident turn of events, then we\nwill cope with them when we return, reinforced. Dynamite, enough of\nit, will finish them off. And, Maget, in your next pursuit after\nknowledge of strange things, you may get a few earthly riches. The\nradium is still there, and you will share in it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Maget humbly. \"I'm with you to the end.\"\n\n\"You must keep quiet about this,\" cautioned Kenneth Gurlone. \"We do\nnot want the world to know too much of our vast store of radium. It\nwould attract adventurers and we would be annoyed by ignorant men. But\nwe're thankful you lay drunk in that saloon when my father spoke of\nthe millions, Maget.\"\n\nIn Manzos, Maget found himself a changed man. To his surprise, in\nspite of his white hair, brought on by the horror of what he had seen,\nhe found that he had gained two inches in height, and that he was\nlarger of girth. This, Professor Gurlone told him, was the effect of\nthe radium rays.\n\nNever again did Maget lie drunk on the floor of a saloon. The events\nthrough which he had gone had seared the tramp's soul, and he kept\nclose to his new master, Professor Gurlone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Moon Master\n\n_By Charles W. Diffin_\n\n[Illustration: _He laughed loudly and contemptuously._]\n\n[Sidenote: Through infinite deeps of space Jerry Foster hurtles to the\nMoon--only to be trapped by a barbaric race and offered as a living\nsacrifice to Oong, their loathsome, hypnotic god.]\n\n\n\"Now that's a mighty queer noise.\" Jerry Foster told himself. He\ndropped the pack from his shoulders and leaned closer to the canyon\nrim.\n\nMiles behind him was the last beaten trail: Jerry wanted peace and\nsolitude and quiet. And now the quiet of the silent mountains was\ndisturbed.\n\nFrom far below came a steady, muffled roar. Faint it was, and distant,\nbut peculiar in its unvarying, unceasing rush.\n\n\"Not water,\" Jerry concluded; \"not enough down there. Sounds\nlike--like a wind--like a wind that can't quit.\n\n\"Oh well--\" He shrugged his shoulders and slipped into the straps of\nhis pack. Then he went back again to the granite ledge. \"I wonder if\nthere's a way down,\" he said.\n\nThere was, but it took all of Jerry's strength to see him safely\nthrough. On a fan-shaped talus of spreading boulders he stopped. There\nwas a limestone wall beyond. And at its base, from a crevice that was\nalmost a cave, came a furious rush of air and steam.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt touched him lightly a hundred feet away, and he threw himself flat\nto escape the hot blast. Endlessly it came, with its soft, rushing\nroar, a ceaseless, scorching blast from the cold rocks.\n\n\"That's almighty funny,\" mused Foster, and sniffed the air. There was\nno odor.\n\n\"And is it hot!\" he said. \"Nothing like that in my geology book. And\nwhat is beyond? Looks like concrete work, as if someone had plastered\nup the cave.\" He picked his way quickly across the rock slope.\n\nIt was hard going. Below him the rocks and dirt went steep to the\ncanyon floor. At its foot the blast swept diagonally over the slope.\nHe must see what lay beyond....\n\n\"Curious,\" he thought; \"curious if that is nature's work--and a lot\nmore so if it isn't.\"\n\nA rock rolled beneath his feet. Another! He scrambled and fought\ndesperately for foothold in the slipping earth. Then, rolling and\nclawing, he rode helpless on the slide straight toward the mysterious\nblast. He felt it envelop him, hot and strangling. His lungs were dry\nand burning ... the blazing sun faded from the rocks ... the world was\ndark....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDarkness was still about him when he awoke. But it was cool; the air\nwas sweet on his lips. And it was not entirely dark.\n\nHe turned his head. He was in a room. On a rough-hewn table a candle\nwas burning. Its light cast flickering shadows on walls of stone.\nRumbling in his ears was the sound of the blast that had overwhelmed\nhim. It echoed, seemingly, from far back in the stone cliff.\n\nJerry made a move to sit up. He found that his hands and feet were\ntied, his body bound to the rough board bed.\n\nAt the sound of his stirring, a figure came out from the farther\nshadow. It was that of a man. Jerry looked at him in silence. He was\ntall, his thin erectness making him seem abnormal in the low room. The\nlean face was unshaven, and from under a thatch of black hair a pair\nof deep-set eyes stared penetratingly at the figure on the rude bed.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Jerry, at length, \"what's the big idea?\"\n\nThere was no reply. Only the intent, staring eyes.\n\n\"You got me out of that man-trap of yours,\" Jerry continued. \"You\nsaved my life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tall man finally spoke. \"Yes, I saved your life. You missed the\nhottest part of the exhaust. I pumped you full of oxygen.\"\n\n\"Then why tie me up like this?\" Jerry Foster was frankly puzzled.\n\n\"You are lucky to be alive. Spies are not always allowed--\" He\ninterrupted himself abruptly. \"You are a reporter,\" he stated.\n\n\"Wrong,\" said Jerry Foster.\n\n\"Who sent you?\"\n\n\"Nobody sent me. I heard the noise of your infernal blast-furnace and\ncame down to have a look.\"\n\n\"Who sent you?\" repeated the man. \"Goodwin? The Stillwater crowd? Who\nwas it?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about,\" protested Jerry. \"I don't\nknow who your Goodwin or Stillwater people are. I don't know who you\nare--I don't give a damn. Take these ropes off and cut out the\nmelodrama. I'll go on my way, and I don't care if I never see you\nagain.\"\n\n\"That's a lie.\" The tall figure leaned over to shake a bony fist.\n\"You'd report to Goodwin. He stole my last invention. He'll not get\nthis.\"\n\nJerry considered the wild figure carefully. \"He's a nut,\" he thought.\nWhen he spoke, his voice was controlled.\n\n\"Now, see here,\" he said: \"I don't know anything about this. I'm Jerry\nFoster, live in San Francisco--\"\n\n\"So does Goodwin.\"\n\n\"Confound you and your Goodwin! So do a million other people live\nthere! I'm getting away from there; I'm heading into the hills for a\nshort vacation. All I want is to get away from the world. I'm looking\nfor a little peace and quiet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thin man interrupted with a harsh laugh.\n\n\"Come here spying,\" he said, \"and tell me you want to get away from\nthe world.\" Again he laughed shrilly.\n\n\"And I am going to be your little fairy godmother. I wish you were\nGoodwin himself! I wish I had him here. But you'll get your\nwish--you'll get your wish. You'll leave the world, you shall,\nindeed.\"\n\nHe rocked back and forth with appreciation of his humor.\n\n\"Didn't know I was all ready to leave, did you? All packed and ready\nto go. Supplies all stowed away; enough energy stored to carry me\nmillions of miles. Or maybe you did know--maybe there are others\ncoming....\" He hurried across the room to open a heavy door of split\nlogs in the rock wall.\n\n\"I'll fool them all this time,\" he said; \"and you'll never go back to\ntell them.\" The door closed behind him.\n\n\"Crazy as a bed-bug,\" Jerry told himself. He strained frantically at\nthe ropes that bound him. \"Looks bad for me: the old bird said I'd\nnever go back. Well, what if I die now ... or six months from now?\nThough I know that doctor was wrong.\"\n\nHe tried to accept his fate philosophically, but the will to live was\nstrong. And one of his wrists felt looser in its bonds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the room his pack lay on the floor, and in it was a heavy\nforty-five. If he could get the pistol.... A knot pulled loose under\nhis twisting fingers. One hand was free. He worked feverishly at the\nother wrist.\n\nThe ropes were suddenly loose. He pulled himself to his feet, took a\nmoment to regain control of cramped muscles, then flung himself at the\npack. When the heavy door opened he was behind it, his pistol in his\nhand.\n\nThere was no struggle: the lanky figure showed no maniacal fury.\nInstead, the man did a surprising thing. He sank weakly upon the rough\nbunk where Jerry had lain, his face buried in his thin hands.\n\n\"I should have let you die,\" he said slowly, hopelessly. \"I should\nhave let you die. But I couldn't do that.... And now you'll steal my\ninvention for Goodwin.\"\n\nJerry was as exasperated as he was amazed.\n\n\"I told you,\" he almost shouted. \"I never knew anyone named Goodwin! I\ndon't care a hoot about your invention. And as for letting me die--why\ndidn't you? That's a puzzle: you were about to kill me, anyway.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other patiently. \"I wasn't going to kill you.\"\n\n\"You said I'd never go back.\"\n\n\"I was going to take you with me.\"\n\n\"Take me where?\"\n\n\"To the moon,\" said the drooping figure.\n\nJerry Foster stared, open-mouthed. The pistol lagged in his limp hand.\n\"To the moon!\" he gasped.\n\nThen: \"See here,\" he said firmly. \"I've got you where I want you.\"--he\nheld the pistol steady--\"and now I'm going to learn what's back of\nthis. I think you are crazy, absolutely crazy. But, tell me, who are\nyou? What do you think you're doing? What was the meaning of that\nroaring blast?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man looked up. \"You don't know?\" he asked eagerly. \"You really\ndon't?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jerry; \"but I'm going to find out.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the other agreed. \"Yes, you can, now that you've got the\nupper-hand. I guess I was half crazy when I thought I had been spied\nout. But I'll tell you.\"\n\nHe sat erect. \"I am Thomas J. Winslow,\" he said, and made the\nstatement as if it were an explanation in itself.\n\n\"Well,\" said Jerry, \"that's no burst of illumination to my ignorance.\nCome again.\"\n\nThe man called Winslow was ready--anxious--to talk.\n\n\"I am an inventor. I have made millions of dollars\"--Jerry looked at\nthe disheveled apparel of the speaker and smiled--\"for other people.\nThe Stillwater syndicate stole my valveless motor. Then I developed my\ntelevision set. Goodwin beat me out of that: he will have it on the\nmarket inside of a year. I swore they should never profit by this, my\ngreatest invention.\"\n\nJerry was impressed in spite of himself by the man's earnest\nsimplicity.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\n\"I've broken the atom,\" said Winslow. \"First tore the atoms of\nhydrogen and oxygen apart--dissociated them in the molecule of\nwater--and have resolved them into their energy components. That's\nwhat you heard--the reaction. It it self-sustaining, exothermic. That\nhot blast carried off the heat of my retort.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinslow rose from the bunk. Gone was his listless despondency.\n\n\"Put up that gun,\" he said: \"you don't need it now. I think we\nunderstand each other better than we did.\" He crossed with quick\nstrides to the door leading into the cliff.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he told Foster. \"I am leaving to-day. You will not\nstop me. But before I go I will show you something no other man than\nmyself has ever seen.\"\n\nHe led the way through the doorway. There was another room beyond,\nJerry saw. It was a cave. Plainly Winslow had taken these caves in the\nrocks and had made of them a laboratory.\n\nA lantern gave scant illumination: Jerry made out a small electric\ngenerator, and that was all. He felt a keen disappointment. Somehow\nthis thin-faced man had communicated to him something of his own\nbelief, his own earnestness.\n\n\"What kind of a laboratory do you call this?\" he demanded. But the\nother was busy.\n\nIn the wall an opening had been closed with a small iron door, with\ncement around it. Winslow opened it and reached through. He was\nevidently adjusting something.\n\nThe little dynamo began to hum. There was a crackling hiss from beyond\nthe iron doorway. The opening was flooded with a clear blue light.\n\nThen the roar began. It was tremendous, deafening, in the echoing\ncave.\n\n\"You may look now,\" said Winslow, and stood aside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry peered through. There was another cave beyond. In it was a small\nmetal cylinder, a retort of some kind. The blue light came from a\ncrooked bulb beyond. The retort itself was white-hot, despite a\nstream of water flowing upon it. A cloud of steam drove continuously\nout and up through a crevice in the rocks.\n\nThe water flowed steadily from some subterranean stream in the\nlimestone formation. It was diverted for its cooling purposes, but a\nportion also flowed continuously into the retort. Jerry's eyes found\nthis, and he could see nothing else. For, before his eyes, the\nimpossible was occurring.\n\nThe retort was small, a couple of feet in diameter. It had no\ndischarge pipes, could hold but a few gallons. Yet into it, in a\nsteady stream, flowed the icy water. Gallons, hundreds of gallons,\nflowing and flowing, endlessly, into a reservoir which could never\nhold it.\n\nThe inventor watched Foster with complacent satisfaction.\n\n\"Where does it go?\" Jerry asked incredulously.\n\n\"Into nothingness,\" was the reply. \"Or nearly that!\"\n\n\"See?\" He held up a flask of pale green liquid. \"And this,\" he added,\nexhibiting another that was colorless.\n\n\"I have worked here for many months. I have converted thousands of\nthousands of gallons of water. It has flowed into that retort, never\nto return. I have gathered this, the product, a few drops at a time.\n\n\"The protons and the electrons,\" he explained, \"are re-formed. They\nare static now, unmoving. Call this what you will--energy or\nmatter--they are one and the same.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Jerry, gropingly, \"what has all that to do with the\nmoon? You said you were going there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the inventor. I am going, and this is the driving force\nto carry me there. I pass a certain electric current through these two\nliquids. I carry the wires to two heavy electrodes. Between them\nresolution of matter occurs. The current carries these two components\nto again combine them and form what we call matter, the gases\nhydrogen and oxygen.\n\n\"Do I need to tell you of the constant, ceaseless and tremendous\nexplosion that follows?\n\n\"But enough of this! You said I was crazy. I gave you a few bad hours.\nI have shown you this much as a measure of recompense. You have seen\nwhat no other man has ever seen. It is enough.\"\n\nHe motioned Foster through the door. The roaring ceased. The inventor\nreturned shortly, the two flasks of liquid in his hands. He\ntransferred both to two metal containers that were ready for the\nprecious load. He carried them with the utmost care as he went out of\ndoors.\n\nOnce he returned, and Jerry knew by the crashes from the inner room\nthat the laboratory work was indeed done. There would be nothing left\nto tell the secret to whomever might come.\n\nHe followed Winslow outside, trailing him toward a wooded knoll. There\nwas a clearing among the trees. And in it, hidden from all sides, his\neyes found another curious sight.\n\nOn the ground rested a dirigible in miniature. Still, it was small, he\nreasoned, only by comparison with its monster prototype: actually it\nwas a sizable cylinder of aluminum that shone brightly in the sun. It\nwas bluntly rounded at the ends. There were heavy windows, open\nexhaust ports, a door in the side, pierced through thick walls.\nWinslow vanished within, while Jerry watched in pitying wonder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDespite its size, it was a toy, an absurd and pitiful toy. Real genius\nand lunacy had many an over-lapping line, Jerry reflected as he\napproached to look inside. But he found Winslow in a room surrounded\nby a network of curving, latticed struts. The machine was no makeshift\nof a demented builder: it was a beautiful bit of construction that\nJerry Foster examined.\n\n\"How did you ever get it here?\" he marveled. \"What you had in the\ncave you could pack in, but this--all these parts--castings--cases of\nsupplies--\"\n\nThe inventor did not even turn. He was busy with some final\nadjustments.\n\n\"Flew it in,\" he said shortly. \"Built it in an old shop I owned out\nnear Oakland.\"\n\n\"And it flew?\" Jerry was still incredulous.\n\n\"Certainly it flew! On a drop or less of the liquids you saw.\" He\npointed to a heavy casting at the center of the machine. There were\nbraces tying it strongly to the entire structure, braces designed to\nreceive and transmit a tremendous thrust.\n\n\"This is the generator. Blast expelled through the big exhaust at the\nstern. These smaller exhausts go above and below--right and left at\nthe bow. Perfect control!\"\n\n\"And you flew it here!\" Jerry was still trying to grasp that\nincontrovertible fact. \"And you were going to take me to the moon, you\nsaid.\"\n\nHe looked above him where a pale, silvery segment showed dimly in the\nsky. \"But why the moon?\" he questioned. \"Even granting that this will\nfly through space....\"\n\n\"It will,\" the other interrupted. \"I tried it. Went up to better than\nfifty miles.\"\n\nJerry Foster took a minute to grasp that statement, then continued:\n\"Granting that, why go to the moon? There is nothing there, no air to\nspeak of, no water! It's all known.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inventor turned to face the younger man in the doorway.\n\n\"There is _nothing_ known,\" he stated. \"The modern telescopes reach\nout a million light years into space. But the one place they have\nnever seen--can never see--is less than two hundred and fifty thousand\nmiles away. The moon, as of course you know, always keeps the same\nside toward us. The other side of the moon has never been seen.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, and his deep-set eyes were afire with an intense\nemotion. \"The moon is no tiny satellite; it is a sister planet. It is\nwhirled on the end of a rope (we call it gravitation), swung around\nand around the earth. How could there be water or anything fluid on\nthis side? It is all thrown to the other side by the centrifugal\nforce. Who knows what life is there? No one--no one! I am going to\nfind out.\"\n\nJerry Foster was silent. He was thinking hard. He looked about him at\nthe clean hills, the trees, the world he knew. And he was weighing the\nsecure life he knew against a great adventure.\n\nHe took one long breath of the clear air as one who looks his last at\na familiar scene. He exhaled slowly. But he stepped firmly into the\nmachine.\n\n\"Winslow,\" he said, \"have you any rope handy?\"\n\nThe inventor was annoyed. \"Why, yes, I guess so. Why? What do you want\nof it?\"\n\n\"I want you to tie me up again,\" said Jerry Foster. \"I want you to\ncarry me off as you planned. I want to go with you.\"\n\nThe tall man stared at the quiet, determined face before him. Slowly\nhis own strained features smoothed into kindly lines. He grasped tight\nat Jerry's hand.\n\n\"I was dreading that part of it,\" he confessed slowly: \"going alone.\nIt would have been lonely--out there....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shining cylinder of aluminum alloy was hurtling through space. No\nlonger was it a ship of the air; it had thrown itself far beyond that\nthin gaseous envelope surrounding the earth; out into the black and\nempty depths that lay beyond. And in it were two men, each reacting in\nhis own way to an adventure incredible. One was deep in the\ncomputation of astronomical data; the other athrill with a quivering,\nnerve-shaking joy that was almost breath-taking.\n\nA metal grating that had formed the rear wall of their cabin was now\nthe floor. Winslow had thrown the ship into a vertical climb that made\nof their machine a projectile shooting straight out from the earth.\nGravitation held them now to the grating floor. And, stronger even\nthan the earth-pull, was the constant acceleration of motion that made\ntheir weight doubled again and again.\n\nThe inventor moved ponderously, with leaden limbs, to take sights from\nthe windows above, to consult his maps of the sky, check and re-check\nhis figures. But Jerry had eyes only for the earth they had left.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlat on the grating he lay, his eyes over a thick glass in a\nproturbance of the shell that allowed him to stare and stare at what\nlay directly below. He watched the familiar things of earth vanish in\nfleecy clouds; through them there formed the great ball, where oceans\nand continents drew slowly into focus.\n\nAnd now he was filled with a sense of great solitude. The world, in\nits old, familiar companionship, was gone--probably forever. The\nearth--_his_ earth--_his_ world--that place of vast distances on land\nand on sea, of lofty mountain ranges and heaving oceans, of cities,\ncountries, continents--was become but a toy. A plaything from the\nnursery of some baby god, hanging so quiet in space he could almost\nreach and take it in his hands.\n\nBeyond it the sun was blaring, a hard outlined disc in the black sky.\nIts rays made shining brilliance of a polar ice-cap.\n\nJerry Foster closed his eyes and drew back from the glass. Again he\nwas aware of the generator, whose endless roar reverberated in their\ncompartment. A smaller but similar apparatus was operating on one of\nthe liquids from the inventor's laboratory to generate oxygen and\nrelease it inside the room. An escape valve had been set to maintain\none atmosphere of pressure about them. Water dripped from a condenser\nwhere both gases were formed to burn into water vapor and cool to\nliquid form.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the windows below admitted a shaft of direct sunlight; it\nillumined their room with a faint glow. It would never cease, Jerry\nknew. They were in a place of eternal sunshine, yet a realm of an\nendless night. Above him, as Jerry raised his head, the windows framed\nnothing but utter blackness, save where some brilliant point marked\nthe presence of a star. He missed the soft diffusion of light that\nmakes daylight on earth. Here was only the one straight beam that\nentered one window to make a circle of light on the opposite wall.\n\nJerry looked from a window of heavy glass at the side. This had been\nthe bottom of their ship when they left. And he found in the heavens\nthe object of their quest. Clear-cut and golden was half the circle;\nthe rest glowed faintly in the airless void. He tried to realize the\nbewildering fact--the moon, this great globe that he saw, was rushing,\nas were they, to their trysting-place in space.\n\nJerry stared until his eyes were aching. His mind refused to take hold\nupon the truth he knew was true. He was suddenly tired, heavy with\nweariness that was an aftermath of his emotional turmoil. He let his\nheavy body relax where some blankets had piled themselves upon the\ngrated floor. The roar of the generator faded into far silence as he\nslipped into that strange spaceless realm that men call sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe human mind is marvelous in its power of adjustment, its\nadaptability to the new and the strange. The unbelievable is so soon\nthe commonplace. Jerry Foster was to sleep more than once in this tiny\nnew world of Winslow's creating, this diminutive meteor, inside which\nthey lived and moved and thought and talked. The fact of their new\nexistence soon ceased as a topic of wonder.\n\nThey alternated in their rest. And they counted the passage of time by\nthe hours their watches marked, then divided these hours into days out\nthere where there were no days. Seven of them had passed when the hour\ncame that Winslow chose for checking their speed.\n\nThey were driving directly toward the moon, which was assuming\nproportions like those of earth. The pilot admitted a portion of the\nblast to a bow port, and the globe ahead of them gradually swung off.\nThe pilot was reversing their position in space to bring the powerful\nblast of their stern exhaust toward the moon, so as to resist somewhat\nits increasing pull.\n\nNow their stern windows showed the approaching globe. It was slowly\nexpanding. They were falling toward it. The inventor moved a rheostat,\nand from behind them the stern blast rose to a tremendous roar. The\ndeceleration held them with unbearable weight to the rear of the\ncabin.\n\nNo thought now for the shining earth, yellow and brilliant in the\nvelvet sky above. Jerry Foster watched through the slow hours as the\nglobe beneath them enlarged and expanded in ever-increasing slowness.\nSlowly their falling motion slackened as they cushioned against the\nterrific thrust of the exhaust below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe globe ceased to grow and held constant. Winslow cut the exhaust to\na gentler blast. They were definitely within the moon's gravitational\nfield; their last hold upon the earth was severed. The great globe was\nrevolving beneath them.\n\n\"How about it?\" Foster asked breathlessly. \"It doesn't revolve like\nthat--not the moon!\"\n\n\"We have approached from the earth side,\" said the other, \"but we have\novershot it. Say that the moon is revolving, or say that we are\nswinging about it in an orbit of our own--it is all the same thing.\"\n\n\"And soon,\" he added slowly, \"we shall see....\" He faltered and his\nlips trembled and refused to frame the words of a dream that was\ncoming true. \"We shall see ... the lost side of the moon. What will it\nbe ... what--will--it--be...?\"\n\nTo Foster the whole experience had now the unreality of a dream. He\ncould not bring himself into mental focus. His thoughts were blurred,\nhis emotions dead.\n\nThey were approaching the moon, he told himself. It was the moon that\nwas there below them, slowly enlarging now, as their own earth had\nhung below them, but dwindling, when they left.\n\n\"The moon!\" he told himself over and over. \"The moon--it is real!\" But\nthe numbness in his brain would not be shaken off.\n\nHis voice, when he spoke, was casual. He might have been speaking of\nany commonplace--a ball-game, or a good show.\n\n\"The sun is coming from my right,\" he said. \"We are going around\ntoward the dark side of the moon. Shall you land there?\"\n\nWinslow shook his head. \"Wait,\" he said, \"and watch.\"\n\nJerry returned to his circle of glass.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a shading of light on the surface below him. From the right\nthe sun's brilliance threw black shadows and bright beams transversely\nover a wilderness of volcanic waste. And beyond, where the rays could\nnot reach, was a greater desolation of darkness, its blackness\nrelieved only by a dim light. He realized with a start of amazement\nthat the dim light he saw was that of their own earth far above: it\nwas lighting their approach to this sister orb.\n\nTheir side-motion was swift as they drew nearer. Another hour and\nmore, and they were drawing toward an expanse of utter darkness. The\nearth-light was fading where they passed. They were approaching, in\nvery fact, the other side of the moon.\n\nWhat was below? What mysteries awaited them? He shivered, despite the\nwarmth of the generator, cherry-red, that heated the snug cabin;\nshivered with unformed thoughts of unknown terrors. But he forced his\nvoice to calm steadiness when he repeated his question to Winslow.\n\n\"Must we land there?\" he asked. \"In the dark?\"\n\nThe inventor was piloting his ship with ceaseless concentration. Their\nfalling speed was checked; they were close enough so that the\nwhistling of air was heard merging with the thunder of their exhaust.\nHe moved the rheostat under his hand, and the thunder slackened.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"You are forgetting your astronomy. This 'other side'\nis subject to the same conditions as the near side. The sun shines on\nthem alike, but alternately. We are rounding the limb away from the\nsun. We find, as you see, a darkness that is absolute except for the\nlight of the stars. Here the earth never shines, and the sun only\nduring the lunar day. But the sun is creeping down this other side.\nTheir day, equal to fifteen of our days, is beginning. We shall come\ninto the light again. I am checking our motion across the surface. We\nshall land, when it seems best, later on. There will be light.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thin strong hands of the pilot played over the current and valve\ncontrols. Their ship slowly swung and dipped to a horizontal position.\nA blast from below held them off from the moon. A bow port was roaring\nas their speed slowly decreased.\n\nMinutes merged endlessly into long hours as Jerry's eager eyes\nstrained to detect some definite form on the surface beneath. Dimly a\nglow appeared far ahead; slowly the darkness faded. They were moving\nahead, but their wild speed was checked. And slowly the new earth\nbelow took on outline and form as the sun's glow crept over it.\n\nWhat would the light disclose? His mind held irrationally to thoughts\nhis reason would have condemned. He found himself watching for people,\nfor houses, lights gleaming from windows. This, in a region of cold\nthat approached the absolute zero. The reality came as a shock.\n\nThe first rays that crept into vision were silvery fingers of light.\nThey reflected up to the heights in glittering brilliance. They\ngathered and merged as the ship drove on toward the sunrise, and they\nshowed to the watching eyes a wondrous, a marvelous world. A world\nthat was snowbound, weighted and blanketed with a mantle of white.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo Jerry the truth came as a crushing, a horrible blow. He turned\nslowly to look at his companion; to look and be startled anew by the\nhappiness depicted on the lean face.\n\n\"I knew it,\" the pilot was saying. \"I always knew it. But\nnow--now....\" He was speechless with joy.\n\n\"It's terrible!\" said Foster. He almost resented the other's elation.\n\"It's a hell! Just a frozen hell of desolation.\"\n\n\"Man--man!\" was the response, \"can't you see? Look! The whiteness we\nsee is snow, a snow of carbon dioxide. The cold is beyond guessing.\nBut the clear places--the vast fields--it's ice, man, it's ice!\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" Jerry shuddered.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" said the other. \"Marvellous! Think, think what that\nmeans. It means water in the hot lunar day. It means vapor and clouds\nin the sky. It means that where that is there is air--life, perhaps.\nGod alone knows all that it means. And we, too, shall know....\"\n\nThe ship settled slowly to the surface of the new world. Black blobs\nof shadow become distinct craters; volcanoes rose slowly to meet them,\nto drift aside and rise above as they sank to the floor of a valley.\nThey came to rest upon a rocky floor.\n\nOn all sides their windows showed a waste of torn and twisted rock.\nVolcanic mountains towered to the heights, their sides streaked with\nmasses of lava, frozen to stillness these countless years from its\nmolten state. The rising sun, its movement imperceptible, cast long\nslanting rays between the peaks. It lighted a ghostly world, white\nwith thick hoar-frost of solid carbon dioxide. A silent world, locked\nin the stillness of cold near the absolute zero. Not a breath of air\nstirred; no flurry of snow gave semblance of life to the scene. Their\ngenerator was stillen, and the silence, after the endless roaring of\nendless days, was overpowering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Winslow pointed exultantly from one window, where an icy expanse\ncould be seen. \"That will be water,\" he said; \"water, when the sun has\nrisen.\"\n\nHe turned on the generator for warmth. The cold was striking through\nthe thick insulated walls. They sat silent, peering out upon that\nboundless desolation, upon a world's breathless nakedness, exposed for\nthe first time in all eternity to human eyes.\n\nJerry's mind was searching for some means of expression, but the words\nwould not come. There were neither words nor coherent thoughts to give\nvent to the emotions that surged within him.\n\nTheir watches showed the passage of nearly two earth days before they\ndared venture forth. They watched the white mantle of frost vanish\ninto gas. From the darkness that they called \"west,\" winds rushed\nshriekingly into the sunrise.\n\n\"Convection currents,\" Winslow explained; \"off under the sun. In the\ndirect rays the heat grows intense; the air rises. This is rushing in\nto fill the void. It will serve our ends, too. It will churn the air\ninto a mixture we can breathe, dispel the thick layer of CO_2 that\nmust have formed close to the ground.\"\n\nMore hours, and the icy sheet was melting. A film of water rippled in\nthe gusts of wind. Winslow opened the release valve that would permit\nthe escape of air from their chamber, equalizing the pressures within\nand without. The air hissed through the valve, and he closed it so the\nescape was gradual.\n\n\"We must exercise,\" he told Jerry. \"We will decompress slowly, like\ndivers coming up from deep-sea work. But watch yourself,\" he warned.\n\"Remember you are six times as strong as you were on the earth. Don't\njump through the roof.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTHE valve had ceased to hiss when Winslow opened it wide. The air in\ntheir cabin was thin; their lungs labored heavily at first. Jerry felt\nas he had felt more than once at some great elevation on earth. But\nthey lived, and they could breathe, and they were about to do what\nnever man had done--to set foot on this place men called the unknown\nside of the moon.\n\nEarth habits were strong: Jerry brought his pistol and a hunting knife\nout of his pack and hung them at his belt, as the inventor opened the\ndoor and sniffed cautiously of the air.\n\nJerry Foster's blood was racing; the air was cold on his face as he\nrushed out. But it brought to his nostrils odors strange and yet\nstrangely familiar. He was oddly light-headed, irresponsible as a\nchild as he shouted and danced and threw himself high in the air, to\nlaugh childishly at the pure pleasure of his light landing.\n\nThe sun made long shadows of two ludicrous figures that went leaping\nand racing across the rocks. Their strength was prodigious, and they\nwere filled with an upwelling joy of living and the combined urge of\nan eternity of spring-times. The very air tingled with life; there was\noverpowering intoxication in this potent, exhilarating breath from a\nworld new-born.\n\nThe ground that they crossed so recklessly was a vast honeycomb of\ncaves. Between the rocks the soil was soft with the waters from\nmelting ice, and the men laughed as they floundered at times in the\noozing mud. Beyond was a lake, and it was blue with a depth of color\nthat was almost black, a reflection of the deep, velvet blackness of\nthe sky overhead. And beyond that was the sloping side of an extinct\nvolcano.\n\n\"Up--up!\" Jerry shouted. \"From up there we will see the whole\nworld--the whole moon!\" He laughed as he repeated the exultant phrase:\n\"The moon--the whole moon!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDespite their strength which carried them in wild bounds across\nimpassable chasms, their laboring lungs checked them in the ascent.\nThe joyous inebriation was wearing off. Winslow met his companion's\neyes sheepishly as they stopped where a sheer cliff of basalt above\ncaught and held the warmth of the sun's rays. Behind them it rose a\nstraight hundred feet, and before stretched a vast panorama. The sun\nwas mounting now in the sky. It brought into strong relief the welter\nof volcanic waste that extended in bold detail through the clear air\nfar out to the horizon, where, misty and dim, the first vaporous\nclouds were forming from the steaming earth.\n\nAnd as they watched, the depressing bareness and emptiness of that\ngray-black expanse was changing. Far to the east a pink flush was\nspreading on the hills. It wavered and flowed, and it changed, as they\nwatched, to deep areas of orange and red. The delicate pink swept in\nwaves over valleys and hills, a vast kaleidoscopic coloration that\nrioted over a strange world.\n\nIn silence it spilled into the valley below. The slope they had\ntraversed was radiant with color.\n\nAt their feet the ground was in motion: it heaved and rolled in\ncountless places. Rounded shapes in myriads were emerging.\nPlants--mushroom growths--poured up from the earth to drink in the\nsunshine of their brief summer. They burst the earth to show\nunfolding leaves or blunted, rounding heads, that grew before the\nmen's incredulous eyes.\n\nWinslow was the first to recover from the stupefying beauty of the\nspectacle.\n\n\"The machine!\" he gasped. \"Back to the ship! We'll be swamped,\noverwhelmed....\" He rushed madly back down the slope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry was beside him, a revulsion of feeling driving him to frantic\nefforts. The piercing beauty that had enthralled him has become a\nthing of terror. The soft, pulpy, growing things that crushed beneath\nhis feet were a menace in their lust for life.\n\nThey were a mile and more from the machine. Could they ever find it,\nJerry wondered. The whole landscape was changed; bare rocks were\nhalf-hidden now under clinging, creeping vines. Only the sun remained\nas a guide. They must go toward the sun and a little north.\n\nHe followed Winslow, who was circling a huge area of weird growths\nthat already were waist high. They leaped across a gaping chasm and\nfought their way over a low hill, rank with vegetation, only to be\nconfronted by a maze of great stalks--stalks that sprouted as they\nwatched, dismayed, and threw out grotesque and awkward branches.\n\nThey made one futile effort to force their way, but the trunks, though\npliant, were unyielding. To attempt to find their way through the\nlabyrinth was folly.\n\n\"We've got to keep on trying,\" said Jerry Foster. \"We've got to get\nback, or....\"\n\nWinslow, as the look in his eyes showed, needed no ending to that\nsentence. There was the summer of a lunar day ahead; the inventor did\nnot need to be told of the scorching, broiling heat that would wither\nthe land when the sun struck from straight overhead. And in their ship\nwas food and water and a means of transport to the cooler heights\nabove.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Jerry who took charge of the situation. Here was a prodigious\nlaboratory in which Winslow's science was useless, but in fighting\nwith nature--even nature in as weird and terrifying a mood as\nthis--Jerry felt himself not entirely incompetent.\n\nHe looked about him. It had been but an hour since they watched the\nfirst onslaught of this life that engulfed them. And now they were cut\noff. Through an opening, where bare rocks made a rift in the\nvegetation, he saw again the high ground where they had stood. There\nwas more rock there on the volcanic slope: the growing things were in\nclumps--islands, rather than continents of rank growth.\n\n\"We must go back,\" he told Winslow, \"and climb while we can. Get to\nthe high ground, take bearings on the place where we left the ship.\nWe'll look over the ground and figure some way to get there.\"\n\nWinslow nodded. He was plainly bewildered, lost in the new jungle. He\nfollowed Jerry, who bounded across a crevice in the earth. The ground\nwas rotten with the honeycomb of caves and cracks.\n\nJerry forced his way through and over a rock heap, where the thick\ntrunks of nightmare trees were spaced farther apart. There was an\nopening ahead; he started forward, then stopped abruptly and motioned\nthe other to silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom beyond there came sounds. There was rending of soft, pliant\ntissue. The sound came through the thin air from a grove up ahead,\nwhere big plants were waving, though the wind had long since ceased.\nTo their ears came a snoring, blubbering snuffle. A stone was\ndislodged, to come bounding toward them from the hillside; the soft\nplants were flattened before it. The men cowered in the shelter of a\ngiant fungus.\n\nBeyond the rocks, above the mottled reds and yellows of the grotesque\ntrees, a head appeared. It waved at the end of a long, leathery neck.\nAll mouth, it seemed to the watchers, as they saw a pair of short\nforelegs pull the succulent tops of the giant growth into a capacious\nmaw. Below, there was visible a part of a gigantic, grayish body. It\nwas crashing down toward them, eating greedily as it came.\n\n\"Back,\" said Jerry softly. \"Go back to that cave. We will hide there\nin some crack in the ground.\"\n\nThey picked their way noiselessly over the rocks. The cave they had\ncrossed offered a refuge from the beast. It went slantingly down into\nthe ground, a great tunnel, deep in the rock. They dropped into the\nopening and started forward, only to recoil at the fetid stench that\nassailed their nostrils.\n\n\"A bear pit,\" gasped Jerry. \"Great Heavens! What a smell!\"\n\nThey stopped, dismayed. Far below them in the bowels of some\nsubterranean passage was the crashing of loose stone; a scrambling and\nscratching of great claws came echoing to them. They leaped madly for\nthe outer air.\n\n\"Over here,\" Jerry directed, and led the way, crouching, to the\nconcealment of great stalks and vine-covered rocks. He pointed toward\nthe open ground where they had been a few moments before. The\ntree-eater was out in full view. Its flabby, barrel-like body was\nsquatted like that of some unearthly, giant toad, on massive hind\nlegs. It sat erect, its forelegs hung in air, as a hoarse, snarling\ncry came from the cave. The great head, perched on the long leathery\nneck, waved from side to side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe noise from the cave ceased. The rift in the earth was in plain\nsight from where they cowered, and the eyes of the men were upon it.\nOne instant it was empty; the next, in uncanny silence, it was filled\nwith huge hideousness--an enormous, crouching beast.\n\nIt was black, a dull leathery black. Its thick, hairless hide hung in\ncreases and folds on a gaunt frame. Shorter than the tree-eater, it\nwas still a thing of mammoth ugliness. Its hind legs were powerful and\narmed with claws that curved deep into the earth; its front legs\ndisplayed the same fearful weapons. A thick, heavy tail slashed\nforward and back over the ground. And from this to the grinning,\nheavy-toothed jaws and beady eyes where the long neck ended in a warty\nhead, it was an incarnation of pitiless ferocity.\n\nWas the scent of the hidden, shuddering men in its red nostrils? It\nforgot them at the sight of the beast in the clearing. The snarling\ncry echoed hideously in the thin air as the frightful body came erect\nwith neck extended, jaws open and dripping. It hurled itself through\nthe air in one terrific leap.\n\nHad there been any lingering hope in the minds of the men that they\nhad no carnivores to deal with, the ensuing struggle ended it. The\nattacker tore great masses of living flesh from the struggling,\nscreaming body. The first cumbersome brute was helpless before its\ndestroyer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry was trembling and sick at the sight, but he grasped his\ncompanion's arm and drew him after as he slipped quietly away.\n\n\"To the high ground,\" he whispered. \"It's our only hope. Perhaps we\ncan fight them off there--find some steep rock we can climb.\" They\nworked their way desperately through the rubbery, obstructing growth.\n\nAt the foot of the hill there was better going; the bare rock gave\nwinding and twisting passage to the heights. They could have leaped\nover the stunted growths here, could have raced frantically for the\nhigh ground, but they dared not. To leap up into view of those fierce,\nsearching eyes! It was unthinkable. They crouched low as they darted\nfrom their concealment to new shelter, and crawled behind rocks when\nopen ground must be crossed.\n\nThey had dared regain hope when again the paralyzing scream ripped\nthrough the silence. It was answered by another and another from\ndistant points. The valley of the caves was spewing out its loathsome\ndwellers from their winter's sleep.\n\nThe men raced openly now for the heights. As he leaped, Jerry turned\nto see over one shoulder a pursuer appear. It was one of the\nflesh-eaters, head to the ground on their trail. At sight of them its\ncry rang out again. It bounded forward in pursuit. And again there\nwere answering screams from the jungle growth.\n\nThe men threw themselves frantically up the mountainside. Once Winslow\nlanded in a sprawling heap and groaned as he drew himself to his feet.\nThe beast was below them. Jerry seized a great boulder, whose\nearth-weight would have made it immovable. He raised it above his head\nand sent it crashing down the slope.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother and another he threw. One struck the great beast in mid-air;\nit was pure luck that drove the stone crashing against the creature's\nhead. It fell back with a blood-chilling snarl that was half shriek.\nAnother monster appeared, to throw itself upon the first and tear at\nthe crushed, waving head.\n\nJerry took his companion by the arm. His voice came strangled from his\nstraining lungs. \"Are you hurt?\" he gasped. \"Can you run?\"\n\nWinslow nodded breathlessly. Again they gathered themselves for their\nwild, leaping retreat toward the top. An uproar of furious fighting\nbehind them marked where a score of the monsters had gathered for the\nfeast.\n\nJerry watched vainly for some refuge, some pinnacle of rock or\nprecipice they could climb, and from which they could beat down their\nattackers. There was nothing but the welter of volcanic waste: rock\nheaps and boulders and smooth streams of solid lava. Perhaps in the\ncrater, he thought, over the ragged crest of the cone, might be some\nplace of safety.\n\nThe pack was in full cry again as they climbed gaspingly to the top.\nBeyond lay the funnel-shaped crater. Its vast inner slopes were less\nsteep than the hill they had climbed. They were covered with a jungle,\nlike those they had seen--a maze of red toadstools and distorted\ntrees.\n\nJerry turned savagely to face the oncoming brutes. This, he knew, was\nthe end. For this they had hurled themselves through space--to make a\nmorning morsel for these incredible beasts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout the men was a confusion of granite rocks, thrown from the crater\nto provide weapons, crude and futile, for two puny earth-dwellers. The\nmen raised great rocks in the air and threw them with all their\nstrength. Jerry struggled with a mammoth boulder,--Winslow leaping to\nhis aid. They toppled it over to start an avalanche of devastation\nthat swept into the oncoming monsters.\n\nAnd again there was respite for their aching arms, while the\nhunger-crazed brutes tore at the bruised bodies of their fellows.\n\nJerry Foster looked longingly again toward the crater. Should they\nchance the shelter of the jungle growth? Hopeless, he knew when these\nmonsters could crash their way through while the men were impeded at\nevery step. The mottled, orange-green stalks, as he watched them,\nseemed to move. He dashed the sweat from his face--his hair hung\nmatted on his forehead--and passed a grimy hand across his eyes.\nPlainly, one of those stalks crossed a rocky-floored clearing.\n\nWas he dreaming? Was this all a dream--a mad nightmare from which he\ncould force himself to wake? Another moved. He saw definitely a\nmushroom growth pass swiftly to lose itself in a neighboring clump.\nDreaming? No! The screams from behind him and Winslow's hoarse yell\nproved the stark reality of his surroundings.\n\nThe vile creatures were close: Jerry could see their fierce heads\ndripping with blood. He reached for his pistol, knew instantly it was\nuseless against these mammoth brutes, and joined Winslow, who was\nstraining desperately at another great rock. It toppled and fell.\nJerry hurled himself at a heap of smaller boulders and sent them\ncrashing as fast as he could seize them and throw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne quick look behind him showed still the impossible vision he had\nseen. And now there were figures--a mob of them--figures that threw\noff their wrappings of vegetation as they ran, cast to the ground the\ntoadstool disguises that they held. They were caricatures of men that\nwere swarming up the hill....\n\nHe swung again in one last hopeless stand against the first horrible\nenemy. The two men poured a torrent of stones down the slope; they\nwere useless, except for their delaying the advance. The beasts leaped\nand dodged. They were close when the rock-rain increased to a deluge.\n\nJerry was fighting in a red haze through which he saw dimly. He was\naware of the hailstorm of boulders that were thick in the air. He saw\nvaguely the white faces and copper-clad bodies of strange men leaping\nabout him, and he heard the wild bedlam of their shrieks as they\njoined in the mad battle against the common enemy.\n\nThe beasts were swept off in a landslide of loose rock--all but one.\nAbove them, on a high point of stone, it was crouching to spring. A\nwild human figure, its flesh white as chalk, leaped forward with a\ntangle of fibers. The tangle was thrown as the brute was in air. A net\nspread and wrapped around the monster. It fell, clawing and tearing,\nto roll helplessly down the slope.\n\nThe battle was won. Jerry swayed drunkenly on his feet. About him the\nmountains seemed whirling, where unreal figures of men with dead\nwhite skin and shining copper armor danced dizzily.\n\nHe met for an instant the look from Winslow's dazed eyes. Out of the\npast a picture flashed clearly: Winslow--this same Winslow--arguing\nthat the moon might hold mysteries still. He laughed thickly.\n\n\"And I said it was all known,\" he muttered through slack lips.\n\"Nothing on the moon that wasn't known....\"\n\nHe was still laughing in a wild inebriation as a net settled close to\nentangle his swaying figure and bear him helpless to the ground. He\nsaw Winslow similarly bound, saw him lifted to the shoulders of\nshouting, yelling men, whose stupid, pasty faces were wide-eyed with\nexcitement.\n\nHe, too, was raised into the air.... They were being carried toward\nthe crater's mouth....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA fight for life in thin air does not make for clear thinking. Jerry\nFoster knew only that a nightmare world was whirling about him; that\nbeneath him powerful shoulders supported, while the one who carried\nhim leaped at racing speed down the slope.\n\nThey went more slowly down pathways cleared through the rank\nvegetation. Soft, pulpy vines from the grotesque trees brushed his\nface. He tried vaguely to shield himself, but his hands were bound\nfast. He was helpless in the entangling folds of the net.\n\nThe touch of cold stone brought him to his senses. He was lying on\nsmooth rock. They were in a clearing. He turned his head to find\nWinslow, but could not find him.\n\nAcross the open ground were naked men, their bodies, like these\nothers, dead white in the sun's glare. They were dragging giant stalks\nto earth by means of ropes. Trunks and branches, bright in their\ncolors of yellow and orange and flaming red, were hacked to short\nlengths and piled on all sides. The workers, as Jerry watched,\ndropped their implements to race toward him. There was a press of\nflat, white faces above. His captors, in their copper armor, beat the\nnewcomers back. The babel of chattering voices was deafening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain he was lifted into the air--plainly these were no weaklings he\nhad to deal with--and again the warrior band surrounded him as the\nmarch was resumed. The milling, shrieking crowd of workers followed in\nan ear-splitting mob.\n\nThe forest ended, and the men went slowly now down smooth, rocky\nslopes to stop upon a wide, level expanse. Before he was placed on the\nground Jerry had a glimpse of a funnel-shaped pit--the mouth of the\nextinct volcano. And toward it, bound and helpless, was being carried\na struggling form which he thought he recognized.\n\n\"Winslow!\" he shouted. But the bodies in their gleaming copper armor\nclosed about him in a solid throng and cut off his view.\n\nIn the sky the sun had moved slowly upward since first they landed. It\nslanted brightly now into the eyes of the prostrate man and made a\nspectacle of his twisting contortions as he tried to get his hands on\nhis knife in its sheath at his belt. This and his pistol were under\nhis coat. But he could not reach them. He lay panting with his\nexertions.\n\nOne of the warriors seemed to have authority, for his arms alone of\nall the group were sheathed with copper circlets, and the others\nobeyed his orders. Jerry addressed himself to this one. He knew the\nwords were unintelligible, but he pleaded desperately for a chance.\n\n\"Take this off,\" he said. \"We are friendly--friends--friends!\" He\nstruggled to keep himself from shouting, to keep his voice under\ncontrol. \"The other man,\" he said, \"bring him back.\" And again he\nrepeated: \"We are friends.\"\n\nHe scanned his captors' faces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pasty face above him was impassive; the eyes stared\nuncomprehendingly into his. Then the figure barked an order. One of\nthe warriors swung Jerry lightly to his shoulder, and started toward\nthe pit.\n\nAt its edge was a basket, a huge affair of knotted fiber ropes. Dimly,\nJerry saw other baskets standing about: they were filled with the\nfragments of fungus. Still bound, he was placed in the empty\ncontainer. Hands grasped the meshes, and he was swung out over the\nedge. A rope was above him: he was lowered steadily into the dark\nshaft.\n\nJerry breathed a sigh of relief. This was not death--not yet. And\nWinslow? Safe, perhaps, for he had traveled this same road.\n\nThere was figures outlined above against the circle of light, figures\nthat clambered like apes down swaying ropes. The light glinted and\nsparkled from their shining armor. His escort was still with him.\n\nThe circle of light changed to a glowing ring, where only the rim was\nlighted. Above was the deep black of the lunar sky. Then the circle\nfaded to a mere point as he went down into the pit.\n\nThe rope basket came to rest upon a rock floor, and Jerry was lifted\nout. He saw plainly the figures about him, and he wondered vaguely at\nthe light that came from the walls of the cavern. There were long\nlines of soft light, leading off into the dark, lines that marked\nplainly a labyrinth of passageways, leading in all directions.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeyond a narrow entrance was one brighter than the rest, a broad\navenue that led downward still further into the depths. Here he was\ncarried. He tried vainly to keep some mental map of their course. He\nwould return some day--he _must_ return--he and Winslow. They would\nescape.... But the passage turned and twisted; there were many\nbranching corridors, each with its lines of light. Jerry gave up the\nattempt. It was a maze of serpentine streets beyond his power to\nremember and recall.\n\nBefore him the passage was still wider. It was opening into a great\nroom.... Jerry found himself upon the floor. He strained cruelly at\nthe cords about his head as he twisted and turned to get a view of his\nsurroundings.\n\nThe room was a cave, its vast vaulted ceiling sprung high above a\nlevel floor, where the figures of men--odd, plaster-white figures like\nanimated statues--were small in the distance. His eyes were drawn\nquickly to the brilliant glow of the farther wall. There was the\nbright black of basaltic formation, and in it--though he knew the\nimpossibility--was shining the sun.\n\nJerry blinked his eyes to look again and again; the golden circle was\ndazzling. It was set at a point well above the smooth floor, and up to\nit there led a sloping pathway of gold. It was as if they had indeed\ncaptured their god, these worshipers of the sun, had captured and held\nit for the adoration of the grovelling people.\n\nJerry saw them upon the floor. The copper of the armored men gleamed\nbright in the glow from beyond, as they abased themselves and crept\nslowly toward the light. At each side of the dazzling orb was a\nplatform. There were figures upon it, seated figures, Jerry saw, even\nat a distance, that were robed in vestments of the sun. Their forms\ngleamed gold in the light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe leader that Jerry had noted among his captors crept on in advance\nof his men. From among the bright figures on the platform above one\nrose to extend a glowing arm. He spoke, and the tones rolled\nmajestically back from the high vault above. The crawling man below\nhim stopped rigidly where he was. Another word from above, and he rose\nslowly to his feet. He stood full in the glow of the captive sun, to\nbe outlined in black against the brilliance beyond.\n\nHaltingly he spoke. Then, seeming to gain confidence, he launched into\na torrent of words. He gestured and waved, and, to Foster, the sign\nlanguage was plain. He saw reenacted the surprise of the warriors upon\nbeholding these intruders; saw how they had spied out upon them, using\ntrunks and branches of the fungus as a screen; saw in pantomime their\nown battle with the beasts, then the rush of the armed men to the\nrescue. Again the net was thrown, and the gesturing figure turned to\npoint dramatically where Jerry lay bound, then pounded his armored\nchest with unconcealed pride.\n\nHe ceased to speak, and there was utter silence in the room as the\nfigure above crossed to stand before the golden sun. He too abased\nhimself before the sign of their god, then rose, to stand motionless,\nlistening....\n\nFor a breathless interval he waited before the oracle, then prostrated\nhimself again and returned to his place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe repeated, it seemed, a command, congratulation, to judge by the\necstasy of the figure below. The warrior turned once to throw himself\nbefore the image of the sun; he repeated this again and yet again\nbefore he crept back to his fellows. The group arose and rushed\nswiftly toward the bound man.\n\nThey brought him quickly into the presence. With scant ceremony Jerry\nwas unrolled from the net; he lay free and gasping upon the floor. The\nmen scurried like mad from out the pathway of light that shone down\nfrom the false sun. Jerry rose to his feet; the brilliance before him\nalmost blinded, but he saw now whence it came.\n\nThere was a hollow in the wall, a great parabola, deep and wide, and\nit was lined throughout with beaten gold. In a straight path the light\nwas reflected from every point--every point but one for at the far\nend, where the curved sides joined, was a circle of darkness. It\nstared like an eye, evil, portentous. Jerry nerved himself for an\nordeal, unknown but imminent. The black eye glared at him unwinkingly.\n\nBefore him was the pathway of light: it shone brilliantly down the\nsloping ramp where a floor of bright gold led up to the sun god\nitself.\n\nThe figure on the dais raised its hand. Jerry heard the words come\nfrom its lips and roll sonorously back from above. The figure waited\nfor an answer.\n\nJerry's hands slipped beneath his coat to rest reassuringly upon his\nweapons. He withdrew his hands empty and raised one toward the figure\nabove.\n\n\"I do not understand your words,\" he said. \"Your language is strange.\nNo doubt mine is as strange to you. I come as a visitor--I am\nfriendly.\" He held out both his hands, palms upward.\n\n\"We have come, my friend and myself, on a friendly errand.\" He paused\nto look vainly about for Winslow. \"And you have received us as if we\nwere wild animals.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry Foster, of San Francisco, U. S. A., was suddenly resentful of\ntheir treatment. His words were meaningless, but his tones were not.\n\"You have tied us,\" he said, \"bound us--dragged us before you. Is that\nthe way you receive your guests from another world?\"\n\nThe golden-clad figure stood in majestic silence while Jerry was\nspeaking. It waited a moment after his outburst, then crossed again to\nbow low in the floodlight of gold. As before, it seemed listening to\nwords from the black heart of the strange sun, words quite\ninaudible--soundless. He returned quickly and waved Jerry's attention\nto the place of light.\n\nThe sense of a presence there in the central blackness was strong upon\nthe waiting man. In that other life that now seemed so remote--his\nlife on earth--Jerry had once felt the threat of a concealed intruder\nin the dark. He recalled it vividly now. The sensation was the same.\n\nBut it was magnified. There was no denying the reality of a malign\nsomething at the heart of that golden glow. The black center of it\nvibrated with cold and venomous hate. It struck upon the waiting man\nlike a physical force. His head was swimming, his thoughts refused to\nform. He was as if suspended in a great void, where all that was lay\ndeep in the center of that radiant orb. And it drew him irresistibly\non.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a dazed bird, held and stricken in the hypnotic gaze of a snake,\nJerry took one stiff, unconscious forward step. Another, and another.\nHe strove dumbly, helplessly, for realization--there was nothing in\nthe universe but the certain thing ahead.\n\nHis foot was upon the golden incline leading to his doom, when that\nburied something which marks a man--the spark of divinity which sets\nhim apart as one alone--reasserted itself.\n\n\"I am,\" he heard his own voice shouting in strangled tones, \"I am\nJerry Foster! I am I ... I am myself!\"\n\nHe awoke from his stupor with a shock that set every nerve-fiber\nquivering. For long minutes he stood silent. Then, realizing his\nvictory and proving it to his own soul, he looked straight into the\nblack center of the threatening sun god, and he laughed, loudly and\ncontemptuously. Then, turning, and with steady stride, he walked\ncalmly from the light.\n\nThe great hall was silent with a silence that was breathless. Then\npandemonium broke lose. The priests and the god had been defied, and\nscreaming and shouts rang throughout the vast chamber to re-echo\nbatteringly from ceiling and walls. There was tumult and confusion\nwhere the populace thronged. Even the figures above on the dais were\nmilling about in disorder; the rippling gold of their robes made a\nspectacle that forced Jerry's involuntary admiration.\n\nThen one from among them sprang forward. His voice roared above the\nshattering din. The room was still. Another order, and the guard of\narmed fighting men formed in a circle about the defier of their god.\n\nJerry waited. Trouble was about due, he told himself. One hand was on\nhis pistol, tense and ready. As the ranks stood silent and made no\nmove to attack, Jerry Foster did a curious thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not done intentionally, but Jerry Foster had nerves, and they\nhad been under a strain. His hand went unconsciously to his pocket and\nextracted a cigarette. There were matches there, too, and he struck\none and lighted the white cylinder. The match made a tiny flame where\nhe flipped it.\n\nThe whole room whispered and hissed with one loud gasp of amazement,\nbut the moan that followed, that echoed and resounded from the roof,\nwas of nothing but horror. Even the warriors drew back in trembling\ndismay. And before them the stranger they had brought to the very\nportal of their sanctum of holies blew clouds of white smoke that\neddied and whirled as they rose round his head.\n\nThe effect was not lost upon Jerry. And his mind was working. Was fire\nunknown to these strange beings? Here in the deep caverns, far from\nthe surface, was fire a thing of terror to them? He looked back toward\nthe wall.\n\n\"If they rush me,\" he thought, \"there's a good place to be. That will\nfeel mighty comfortable at my back.\"\n\nHe walked slowly, the smoke rising thick about his head. The\ncopper-clad figures before him withdrew, the ranks parting to let him\nthrough. Unharmed he reached the safety of the wall. The enemy now\nformed a semi-circle before him.\n\nThe inertia of the stricken beings on the platform was broken by his\nmove. Again their head priest gave an order; from another side a\nsecond detachment of armed men came on. They were carrying something.\nJerry leaned forward in quivering preparedness as he saw, in the\nfloodlight of radiance, the body of Winslow lying on the floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWas he injured? Dead? The devastating loneliness that swept him at the\nsight of the still body was unnerving. He breathed a long sigh of\nrelief as the lanky figure rose slowly to its feet. Winslow was alive!\nThey would show these beastly, unearthly humans something yet.\n\nThere was no preparation--no preliminaries. Whether Winslow could have\nreacted as Jerry had would never be known. He seemed stunned and\nhelpless, and it was with no resisting hesitation that he began the\nclimb to the unknown.\n\nJerry's crouching tenseness snapped. No thought of the gun as he\nsprang toward the enemy between him and his friend. \"No, Winslow--no!\"\nhe shouted as he leaped at the figures in front of him.\n\nTheir strength had seemed startling to Jerry when they had carried him\nlike a child. He had forgotten his lightness here on this unheavy\nworld. And he had forgotten his own great strength.\n\nNo panting, exhausted, beaten fighter of beasts was this that hurled\nhimself against the ranks before him. One coppery sword flashed upward\nabove his head. Its bearer was seized in two hands that picked him\nbodily from the floor and crashed him, a living projectile, among the\nothers. Jerry waited for no more. There was an opening ahead, and\nbeyond was Winslow, walking stiffly, certainly, up that damnable\nslope. He threw himself in giant leaps across the floor.\n\nHis companion was half-way up the glittering ramp when Jerry seized\nhim. Holding him in his arms, he leaped outward, to land rolling on\nthe floor. He was on his feet in an instant. He dragged Winslow to a\nstanding posture.\n\n\"Wake up, man,\" he was shouting. \"Winslow--wake up!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe onrushing horde was upon them while the tall man was still\nbrushing his hand over weary eyes, and Jerry, for the moment, had the\nfighting to himself.\n\nNo time for anything but parry and strike. He caught one white face on\nthe jaw; the man went bodily through the air. Jerry landed again and\nagain. His weapons were his fists, and they did fearful execution. And\nhe knew, at length, that he was not alone.\n\nThe long arms of the inventor tore a sword from an upraised hand. Its\nowner was thrown, as Jerry had thrown one previously, to catapult\namong its fellows.\n\nThey were clear for an instant. \"Back to the wall!\" shouted Jerry. He\nhad time and room to reach for his pistol, and drew it quickly from\nits holster. They backed hastily to the protection of the stone wall.\nThere were scores upon scores of copper-clad figures that followed\nthem held out of reach. With a flashing of gold, the head priest\nhimself sprang to urge on his men.\n\n\"Ready!\" said Jerry. \"I wish you had a gun! Here! Take this!\" He\nhanded his companion a long-bladed knife, then turned to aim his\npistol with steady hand at the oncoming figure in golden robes.\n\nThe priest stopped for a brief scrutiny of this new menace, then\nscreamed out an order and hurled himself into the sheltering press of\nmen.\n\nJerry fired into the whirl of bodies. The roar of the forty-five tore\nlike a battery of siege guns throughout the great room. But the\ncreatures before them were fighting now in an insane frenzy. Their\nbodies pressed the two men to the wall. Jerry fired again, and the\nfall of a limp, gold-robed body gave him a thrill of delight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inventor was holding a white body as a shield, while he thrust\npast it incessantly with a red blade. There were huddled figures\nbefore them that lay quiet or crept painfully away. The body of the\nhead priest was being carried off.\n\nThe dark mouth of a passage had impressed itself upon Jerry; he\nremembered it now. It offered a means of escape.\n\n\"Off to your right,\" he said. \"Work off to your right. There's a hole\nin the wall--\"\n\nThey fought off the struggling eruption of bodies that drove at them.\nJerry was saving his ammunition, but once more he fired as a sword was\nfalling over Winslow's head. He drove strongly with his left and beat\nat the white skulls with the butt of the gun gripped in his other\nhand.\n\nThe passage was suddenly behind them. One last stand against the\nscreaming, frothing faces, and they backed, panting, into the\nsheltering dark. Jerry stopped and took Winslow by the arm.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" he demanded. The inventor was too breathless for\nreply.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" he panted, after a moment. \"One got me along the\ncheek--you shot him just in time. How about you?\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" was the assurance. \"But, man, I've been hammered!\"\n\n\"What a peach of a fight,\" he added. \"But now what?\"\n\nWinslow laughed mirthlessly in the dark. \"This looks like a one-way\nstreet,\" he said. \"We can't go back.\n\n\"Say,\" he demanded, with sudden, dim recollection. \"I remember\nsomething of a dream--a ghastly sort of thing. I was ... I was ...\nwhere was I when you collared me? Where was I headed?\"\n\n\"For something too damnable for us to imagine,\" Jerry stated\nemphatically.\n\nThey were walking as rapidly as they dared through the dark passage.\nThere were high-pitched voices from the rear. From somewhere ahead\ncame the sound of running water.\n\n\"Too damnable to imagine!\" he repeated. \"But we'll hunt the vile thing\nout if we get a chance, and we'll slaughter--\"\n\nThe words ended in a startled exclamation as the ground fell beneath\ntheir feet. They pitched headlong into nothingness--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was water in Jerry's face as he fell. A torrent engulfed him as\nhe struck into it, pouring in from a lower passageway to plunge\nstraight down the shaft. The roaring crash of water tore madly at his\nbody; his arm was shot through with stabbing pain as Winslow's falling\nbody was torn from his grasp.\n\nHe was conscious only of his bursting lungs when he came to the\nsurface from the depths into which he plunged. With one arm he swam\nweakly, the other trailing at his side, while he gulped greedily at\nthe air.\n\nA voice came hoarsely from a distance. \"Foster,\" it called.\n\"Jerry--where are you, Jerry?\"\n\nAh, the good air in his lungs--he could swim more strongly now. He\nmanaged to gasp an answer: \"Here, Winslow, over here!\" There was a\nsplashing in response to his voice. He heard it over the noise of the\nwaters he had been swept away from the cataract.\n\nA hand was upon him in the dark. \"Hurt?\" asked the welcome voice. \"Can\nyou swim, Jerry?\"\n\n\"A little. One arm's working.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hands fumbled over him quickly, and his good arm was drawn over\nthe other's back. \"Hang on,\" Winslow told him. \"I can swim. I'm half\nfish.\"\n\nJerry clung to the folds of the coat. He was light in the water, he\nfelt--riding high--and the man beside him was swimming with strong\nstrokes. He released his hold on the other as he felt strength ebbing\nback into his body.\n\n\"I can paddle,\" he said: \"but stick around. Where are we going?\"\n\n\"In a circle, probably,\" was the reply, \"though I'm trying to hold a\nstraight course. How big is this lake, I wonder?\"\n\nThey swam slowly, saving their strength, but it was a time that seemed\nlike endless hours before the answer to Winslow's question was found.\nJerry was fighting weakly, exhausted, and the hand supporting him was\nfailing when they felt sharp rocks against their dragging feet. The\nhand that had held him still clung tightly to his shoulder as they\nstruggled upward and fell together where great rocks gave safety in\nthe darkness. In his arm the sharp pain had dwindled to numbness;\nJerry Foster asked only for sleep.\n\nThere was light about him when he awoke. In his stupor he had found\nagain the surroundings he knew so well--the clash and clatter of a\ndistant city--the roaring traffic--signals, and glowing lights. He\ncame slowly back to unwelcome reality. The light was there, but it\nshone in luminous lines along the wall to illumine the hateful\nfamiliarity of the honeycombed rock that composed the moon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt showed, too, a familiar figure, breathing heavily where it lay on\nthe far side of the small room. Winslow's face was pale in the dull\nlight, and his eyes were closed. He was on a thick pallet of soft\nfibers and across his body a cloth was spread, shot through with gold\nin strange designs.\n\nJerry Foster threw aside a robe of the same material that covered him.\nHe stifled an involuntary word as a twinge of pain shot through his\narm, then crossed noiselessly to shake softly at the shoulder of the\nsleeping man. Winslow, too, came slowly from his sleep of complete\nexhaustion, but his eyes were clear when they opened.\n\n\"Where are--\" he began a question, but Jerry's hand was pressed\nquickly against his lips.\n\nThey stared slowly about. The room that held them was in the natural\nrock, but whether hewn out by hands or a natural formation they could\nnot tell. The rock was rotten with perforations, through which air\nflowed in a cool stream.\n\nJerry came softly to his feet to feel cautiously of the glowing,\nluminous mounds along the wall. They were spread upon a ledge. The\nlight was cold to his touch, the material like fine soil in his hands.\n\n\"Fluorescent,\" whispered Winslow. \"Calcium sulphide, possibly; I saw\nthem spreading it above ground in the sun. It absorbs light and gives\nit off slowly.\" Jerry nodded; the source of the endless glowing lines\nhad been puzzling to him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir whispers ceased at a sound beyond a doorway. In the opening a\nfigure appeared, tall and erect, the figure of a girl. Her face was\nwhite like the others of these whose lives were lived below the\nsurface, but there was a kindly softness in the eyes, a refinement and\nintelligence of no low order, that contrasted with the cold eyes of\nthe warriors and the priests. Not beautiful, perhaps, by earth\nstandards, yet it required no straining of chivalry on Jerry's part to\nfind her human and lovely.\n\nIn silence the men stood staring. Then Foster, with unconscious\ngentleness, made a revealing gesture. This woman--this girl--had saved\nthem. He knew it without words, and he was wordless to reply. He\ndropped swiftly to his knees and pressed a bit of the golden robe\nagainst his lips.\n\nA flush of scarlet swept across the white face and receded. The hand\ndropped from its startled poise and rested, gently, questioningly, on\nthe brown head bent before her.\n\nShe murmured unintelligible words in a guarded voice as Jerry arose.\n\"Marahna,\" she said, and touched her breast lightly. \"Marahna.\" Her\nhead was erect, the whole attitude imperious, commanding. She\nquestioned them with swift, liquid words. The men shook their heads in\nutter incomprehension.\n\nAgain she spoke, and again they shook their heads. Jerry felt foolish\nand dumb. He took his turn at questioning, and this time, with a\ntrace of a smile, it was the girl's turn to shake her head. She had\nmastered one sign at least.\n\nPointing toward the great hall they knew was somewhere above, she\nreenacted the scene there; she evidently knew what had transpired. And\nnow Jerry nodded in confirmation. That she approved of the part they\nhad played was evident.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she questioned whence they had come. She pointed down, and her\nfluttering hands and graceful posture spoke eloquently. She showed\nthem more than a trace of fear, too, as she marked them coming from\nthe depths. Jerry shook his head in vehement denial.\n\nHe pointed above, spread his hands wide, tried as best he could to\nindicate vast distance beyond. She stared, wide-eyed, then in her turn\nknelt as if before a god.\n\n\"She thinks we have come down from the sun,\" Winslow surmised. \"Well,\nlet it go at that.\" But Jerry Foster was embarrassed in the strange\nrole of a god; he raised the humbled, kneeling young woman to her\nfeet.\n\nHe pointed to her gold-clad figure and repeated the name she had\ngiven. \"Marahna,\" he said. \"Marahna!\" Then, placing his hand on his\ncompanion, he repeated: \"Winslow--Winslow!\" And, pointing to himself,\nhe completed the introduction with: \"Foster, Jerry--Jerry Foster!\"\n\nThe pale lips formed themselves slowly to the strange and unaccustomed\nsounds.\n\n\"Cherrie,\" she repeated, and smiled in comprehension. \"Cherrie.\"\n\nThis was the first of many lessons, and it was amazing to both men how\nrapidly they learned to get their thoughts across. In turn, they\nlearned to read the messages that the slim hands and graceful,\nundulating body conveyed. Even words were linked one by one with their\nindicated objects and meanings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne syllable the girl used only in a hushed and awe-stricken tone. It\nwas \"Oong\" that she whispered, while her eyes filled with terror and\ndread. And they knew this for the name of the horror that waited in\nthe black center of that unholy place where the pathway of light\nascended. It was later that they learned to read hatred as well as\nsheer terror in the emotions that the word _Oong_ aroused.\n\nThe first lesson ended in a soft exclamation from the girl. She\nwithdrew, to return in a moment with a beaker of hammered gold, filled\nwith cold water. In her hands, too, were strange fruits and branches\nof fungus. She ate bits of them to show they were food. And Jerry, as\nhe watched her, was aware that he was famished. But the two men ate\nsparingly at first of the strange food.\n\nIt was tasteless, they found, except for an elusive flavor, but the\nreception of the food in their gnawing stomachs was satisfactory.\nTheir strength was returning, and with it came hope of release. The\nmoon-people, evidently, were not altogether villainous.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Jerry in a normal tone, \"that was--\" White fingers\ntrembled against his lips to enforce silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl listened intently, then stole softly out into the corridor\nfrom which she had come. She motioned the men to follow, and pointed\nthere in the dim light to a far room.\n\nThere were others, they saw; a group of young women lying at ease on\ntheir pallets, or moving slowly about. The need for quiet was\napparent, more so when the figure of a man appeared as they watched.\nQuickly the girl, Marahna, stepped before them and motioned them back\nto their room.\n\nShe followed and glanced quickly about. In the farther wall was an\nopening, close to the floor, and low, but they managed to work their\nway through at her silent command. A passage, much like the others,\nlay beyond. It widened and grew higher, until they could stand erect.\nBack in the circle of light they saw, for a moment, the man, bowing\nlow in respect before Marahna. He carried a basket of light that shone\nbrightly in the room.\n\n\"Replenishing the supply of sulphide,\" whispered Winslow.\n\nA current of air came cool and refreshing from a branching tunnel in\nthe rock. There was no lack of ventilation, as they well knew,\nthroughout all the tortuous passages, but this came with a scent of\noutdoors that set both men a-tingle with hope. Jerry forgot even the\ndull ache in his arm as he breathed deep of this messenger from the\noutside.\n\nBut exploration must wait. They needed to rest, to learn and to plan.\nThey returned when Marahna called softly from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime had lost all its meaning. They could only guess at the hours that\nhad passed since the hour they left their ship, could only make\nunanswered surmises as to where was the sun or how much was left of\nthe long lunar day. They must escape--they would escape--but their one\nstroke for freedom must not be made when darkness and paralyzing cold\nshould force them back into the hands of the enemy tribes.\n\nMarahna was with them much of the time, and always they struggled and\nstrove with desperate concentration to grasp at the meanings of the\nthoughts she tried to convey. And they learned much.\n\nOf the passage they believed they had found out to the surface, she\nknew little. But she showed them, with doubt in her face, that there\nwas almost hopeless struggle along that path to the freedom above.\nSadly she touched Jerry's injured arm, and she shook her head in\ndejection.\n\nThe arm had had a bad wrench, Jerry found. No fracture, but the\nmuscles and ligaments had been painfully torn. But Jerry set his teeth\nfirm at the thought of a possible escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce, peering along the dark passage that led to the room where the\nothers had been seen, the men noticed the deep bows that unfailingly\nmarked the entrance of Marahna. They questioned her and learned that\nhere was royalty among the people of the moon. This, as they\nconsidered the proud poise of her head and her whole attitude of\nunassuming superiority was not entirely surprising. But they marveled\nthe more at the truth that she finally made plain to them.\n\nMarahna, she told them, as plainly as if she were speaking in their\nown tongue, Marahna was chosen for death. And her white face was\npitiful and her eyes full of horror as she enacted for them the slow\nmarch she must take up the long golden slope and into the horror that\nwaited.\n\n\"A sacrifice to that god!\" Jerry spoke with dismay. \"No, no!\" But the\nface of the Princess Marahna of the moon people was unutterably sad\nwith unspoken thoughts as she touched her breast with one slender\nfinger, then indicated the outer room and showed there were two there\nbeside herself who were to go.\n\n\"Help us to get out,\" Jerry begged, and with fierce eagerness he\nshowed them going through the passage to the outside. \"We will come\nback, and we will find some way to end all this damnable thing.\"\n\nShe gave them to understand the time that was left. The sun, she\nshowed, was long past the meridian and was on its return. The day was\nnow reaching a close. And then, as the sun set, the great sacrifice\nwould be made--had always been made--to insure the return of their\ngod.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir watches were useless, for the water had entered their cases. The\ntwo men waited what they judged was the length of a day, while Jerry\ntried to believe that his arm was improving. Then, putting a small\nsupply of food in their pockets, they were ready for the attempt.\n\nJerry saw that his gun and knife were ready at his belt, and patted a\npocket where his matches were safe in their watertight container. The\nprospect of escape almost unnerved him. To breathe the clear air; to\nstand in the radiant light of the sun--he could understand now how\nthese people made a god of the sun. He turned to Marahna.\n\n\"Good-by,\" he said, \"but not for long. We'll be back. And we'll save\nyou, Marahna, we'll save you. Winslow will figure some way to do\nit.... We'll be back....\"\n\nThe girl was silent. She touched Jerry's arm, and shook her head\nslowly, doubtfully.\n\nHe reached for the hand. It trembled, he felt, in his. The impulse to\ntake the slim form within his arms, to hold her close, was strong upon\nhim. Would he ever see her again ... would he?\n\n\"Won't you say good-by, Marahna?\" he asked.\n\nBut she smiled, instead--a friendly smile, and encouraging. Then\ndropped in silence to her knees to press with both her trembling hands\nhis hand upon her forehead. And, still in silence, she rose to vanish\nfrom the room.\n\nThe men entered the narrow opening to start forward into the dark. But\nJerry Foster was puzzled, puzzled and more than a trifle hurt. Marahna\ncould at least have said good-by. She knew the word, for he had taught\nit to her. And she had let him--them--go....\n\n\"Oh, well,\" he thought, \"how can I know how a princess feels--a\nprincess of the moon? And why should I care--why should she? But....\"\nHe refused to complete the thought. He hurried instead, as best he\ncould, to follow Winslow, fumbling ahead of him in the dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry had used plenty of muttered invective with the massage he had\ngiven his arm, but he cursed his handicap wholeheartedly at the end of\nsome several hours.\n\nThey were standing, he and Winslow, in a dark tunnel. They had climbed\nand clawed their way through the absolute dark, over broken fragments,\nthrough narrow apertures, down and up, and up again through a\ntortuous, winding course. And now they had reached the end. They had\nfound the source of the fresh air, had come within reaching distance,\nit seemed, of sunlight and all that their freedom might mean. And they\nhad come, too, to a precipitous rock wall.\n\nThey stared long and hopelessly at the shaft that reached, vertical\nand sheer, high, high over their heads. And a curse like that of\nTantalus was theirs. For, far at the top, slanting in through some\noff-shooting passage, there was sunlight. It was unmistakable in its\nclear glare, beautiful, glorious--and unattainable.\n\nThere were roughnesses in the wall, footholds, handholds here and\nthere. \"It might be ... it might be....\" Jerry tried to believe, but\nthe ache in his arm made the thought hopeless and incomplete. He\nturned to his companion.\n\n\"I believe you can do it,\" he said steadily.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWinslow's dark eyes were gleaming in the dimness that surrounded.\n\"Possibly,\" he replied, and eyed the ascent with an appraising stare.\n\"Even probably. But you know damn well, Foster, that I'm not going to\ntry.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass.\" Jerry's tone was harsh, but the tall man must have\nknown what emotions lay underneath.\n\n\"We'll play it out together,\" he said.\n\nJerry was silent as he reached in the darkness for Winslow's hand.\n\n\"Of course I knew you were that sort,\" he said. He waited a moment,\nthen added: \"But you're going, old man, you're going. Don't you see\nit's our only hope?\"\n\nWinslow shook his head emphatically. Jerry could see him in the dim\nreflection from that radiance above. \"Nothing doing,\" the calm voice\nassured him. \"Don't bother to think up more reasons why I should\ndesert.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" Jerry gripped roughly at the other's shoulder. \"Listen to\nreason.\n\n\"If you go and I go back there, what will happen? With Marahna gone we\nare helpless, and we will be helpless to save her. The long night is\nahead. How can we live? Where can we live? We will be wiped out as\nsure as we're alive this minute.\n\n\"If you go--and if you make it to the ship--there's a chance. Alone, I\nmay manage to stick it out.\" He knew he was lying, knew that the other\nknew it too, but he went on determinedly. \"You can wait for me up\nabove. My arm will be well--\" Winslow stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"There's a chance,\" the older man was muttering, \"there's a\nchance....\" He swung quickly toward Foster, to grab hard at the good\nright hand.\n\n\"I'm going,\" he stated. \"I'm on my way. I won't say good-by; what's\nthe use--I'll be back soon!\"\n\nHe released his hold on Jerry to leap high in the air for a ledge of\nprojecting rock. He caught it and hung. His foot found a toehold and\nhe drew himself up to where another rough outcrop gave grip for his\nhand.\n\nJerry Foster stood frozen to throbbing stillness. Words were\nstrangling in his throat, an impulse, almost irresistible, to call. If\nthere were only a rope....\n\nHe was still silent when the tiny figure of his companion and friend\nwas lost in the heights, where it vanished into that tunnel from which\ncame the light. He turned blindly, to stumble back into the dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarahna was waiting when he regained the safety of her room. \"Safety!\"\nThe thought was bitter when linked with the certain fate that lay\nahead.\n\nSilently she stroked the bent head of the man who dropped dejectedly\nupon the hard stone floor. Her fingers were gentle, comforting,\ndespite the utter hopelessness and discouragement that lay heavily\nupon him.\n\nThey sat thus, nor counted the flying minutes, while the fog of\ndespair in the mind of the beaten man was clearing. He raised his head\nfinally to meet the look in the dark eyes. And he managed a smile, as\none can who has thought his way through to the bitter end and has\nfaced it. He patted the hand that had stroked his bowed head.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said gently. \"What is to be, will be--and we\ncan't change it. And it's all right somehow.\"\n\nHis sleeping, during their long stay, had been a cause for amusement\nto Marahna, whose habits were tuned to the long days and nights on the\nmoon. And he was sleepy now, sleepy and tired. She spread the robe\nover him as he rested on the soft fiber bed.\n\nHe awoke from a deep sleep with a light heart. For Jerry Foster, as he\nfaced his own certain death, had seen certain things. It was the\nend--that was one fact he couldn't evade. But he grinned cheerfully,\nall by himself in that strange cheerless room, as he thought of what\nelse he had visioned.\n\n\"And it will be just one hell of a fight,\" he said softly aloud.\n\"There will be some of those priests that will know they have been in\na war.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe examined again the knife and the automatic, and counted the\ncartridges left in the magazine. There were more he had found in a\npocket of his coat, enough to replace those he had fired. He slipped\nthe pistol into its holster at the sound of soft footsteps\napproaching.\n\nIt was Marahna who entered, a strange and barbaric Marahna. She was\nclad in a garment of spun gold that enveloped her tall figure. It\ntrailed in rippling beauty on the floor--draped in resplendence her\nslim body, to end in soft folds about a head-dress that left Jerry\nbreathless.\n\nHer face was entirely concealed. The gold helmet covered her head. It\nwas tall, made entirely of hammered gold in which spirals of jewels\nreflected their colors of glittering light. She was quite\nunrecognizable in the weird magnificence.\n\nOnly her voice identified the figure. She murmured chokingly some soft\nwords, then raised her head with its barbaric helmet proudly high as\nshe concluded. There were words become familiar now to Jerry. Together\nwith the spectacle she presented, her meaning was more than plain.\n\n\"The time has come,\" she was telling him. \"The sun ... the hour of\nsacrifice.\"\n\nJerry leaped to his feet. His plans for battle were being revised. An\nidea--a plan, half-formed--was beating in his brain.\n\nA sound was beating upon him, too. There were drums that throbbed in\nsteady unison, that echoed hollowly along resounding walls, that\napproached in loudly increasing cadence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe plan was complete. \"No!\" said Jerry Foster, with a wild laugh. He\nreached to remove the golden helmet.\n\nHe placed it upon his own head, under the startled gaze of the\nwondering girl. He reached out for the robe.\n\n\"You shall not go,\" he told her. \"I will go in your place. And when I\nreach that room....\" His eyes were savage behind the slits in the\ngolden head-dress.\n\n\"No--no!\" the girl protested. Her face showed plainly the complete\nhopelessness of what Jerry proposed. To pit himself against that\nantagonist--she knew how futile was the brave gesture.\n\nJerry was undaunted. \"I've got to die anyway,\" he tried to explain,\n\"and if I can get in one good crack at whatever is there--well, I may\nbe of help.\"\n\nHis hand was taking off the cloak. Marahna's eyes were steady upon\nhim. She ceased to resist. She whipped one of the covers from the\ncouch about her and helped him with the golden robe.\n\nThe throbbing of drums was hammering at Jerry's temples. They were\nclose at hand! Marahna, without a word, rushed frantically back toward\nthe room where the others waited.\n\nAnd again Jerry Foster felt that odd tightening of disappointment\nabout his heart. But what was the difference, he told himself, in a\nhundred years--or a hundred minutes. He set his lips tight and walked\nslowly out and down the passage.\n\nThe room he entered was deathly quiet. There were figures standing\nabout, figures robed in their gold-threaded drapes, that stared\nstrangely, wonderingly, at him, and drew themselves into a huddled\ngroup against the wall. And two there were, who stood apart: the other\nvictims--their sacrificial garments wrapped them round where they\nwaited for the third who was to accompany them. Jerry joined them as a\nguard came in from the outer hall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drums were rolling softly in their rhythmic beat. The priests who\nentered showed annoyance at the delay; they gave a curt order, and\nmotioned the three to follow.\n\nOutside, the corridor was broad, and the double rows of lights on\neither side glowed brightly to illumine a pageant grotesque and\nterrible in its barbaric splendor. The drums throbbed louder. Jerry\nsaw them in their fire of burnished metal, beaten by the bands of\nnaked men. Beyond, a group of warriors waited. Stalwart and strongly\nmuscled, they stood erect in copper armor beside a platform of metal\nbars, whose floor was of latticed gold. The victims were placed upon\nit to stand erect. Jerry balanced himself upon the golden floor as the\nwarriors raised it slowly to their shoulders.\n\nPriests, in robes of heavy golden rope, were ranged about; they formed\na guard and escort ten deep about the living sacrifice. At that the\ndrums increased their volume, and to this was added a nerve-racking,\ndiscordant and rasping jangle, when sheets of copper, paper-thin, were\nstruck with a heavy hand. The pulsing, throbbing pandemonium was\nterrific as the march began.\n\nSlowly they made their way through a winding gallery. Slowly they came\nto where a portal, high-arched, gave entrance upon the great hall.\nSolemnly, proudly, the priests lead the way as they circled the vast\nroom. Their wrappings of gold were a scintillant quiver of light;\nabove each hard face a circle of gold--symbol of the sun--was borne\nimperiously high.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe priestly guard surrounded the platform where the three standing\nfigures were huddled. And behind, and on either side, the men with the\ndrums and the discordant, ringing sheets gave full force to their\nblows. The high vault above thundered and roared to the thunder and\nroar of the drums. And, high over all, a wailing began.\n\nThe thin shrillness beat with the tempo of the drums in a pitch that\nsteadily descended. The glittering procession had come to rest at its\nappointed place in the pathway, of light as the wailing came down to a\nmoan. \"_Oong! Oong!_\" the voices groaned, while the walls re-echoed\nthe despairing tones. Only from the band of warriors did the ear of\nJerry Foster detect anything but misery and despair. The priests were\nsilent, but the warriors, in their shining armor, stood erect and\nroared out the syllables in exultant joy.\n\nThe priests were now upon the dais--the rocky platform, divided by the\ngreat, glowing parabola of light. They stood erect as a new high\npriest, replacing the one Jerry had killed, crossed to bow and grovel\nin the radiance from their god.\n\nThe room was silent with the silence of a great tomb as the march of\ndeath began. Softly, from the silence, the drums resumed the merest\nwhisper of their former thunderous booming. Beside him. Jerry heard\nthe soft sobs of a girl. One of the figures swayed and threatened to\nfall as the platform was lowered to rest upon the floor. The other\npressed close to support the drooping figure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the entire directed ray of light from the round, glowing hole\nstruck full upon them. It blinded and dazzled, yet, plain and\ndistinct, Jerry saw at its heart the circle of blackness, the eye of\nthe mysterious, hypnotic parabola--the entrance to what lay beyond.\n\nThe beat of the drums was hypnotic. As if in a trance he saw, at the\nside of the way they must go, the form of the head priest beckon them\non. The two victims at his side took one step on the path to their\ndeath. And the same stiff rigidity held Jerry as he, too, moved onward\nand up the golden ramp.\n\nThe drums were bearing them on. Louder they throbbed in a steady\ncrescendo, to carry the three rigid figures a step at a time up the\npathway of light.\n\nThe priest, Jerry felt more than saw, was beside them. Close ahead was\nthe blackness that held the set stare of his eyes. One of the golden\nfigures was before him. He saw the priest reach out to take the helmet\nfrom her head.\n\nThe movement aroused him from his numb horror. An impulse to escape\nsurged through him; every nerve was tense and ready for a spring. He\nlooked quickly about. The warriors were behind, the priests ready on\ntheir platform to direct them. And in the doorway, from where he first\nhad seen this chamber, on the only way he knew that led to freedom,\nanother figure, tall in its priestly robes, blocked the passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHopeless, he knew. And then there swept through him a wave of hate. Gone\nwas his horror, and gone the dull deadness of brain and body. There, facing\nhim, was the mouth of the pit, where waited a something--horrible,\nrapacious--demanding the lives of these people ... of Marahna ... of\nothers--more and yet more.\n\nNo thought now of life or escape. For the moment, Jerry Foster's whole\nbeing held nothing but hot hate, and the wish for revenge.\n\nBefore him the priest was stripping the robe from the girl at his\nfeet. She stood like a statue, a carving of purest alabaster, slim and\nerect in her white, slender nakedness. And the face that he saw\nthrough incredulous eyes was that of Marahna.\n\nMarahna! The realization and quick understanding held him spellbound.\nShe had come, had taken the robes from another poor victim ... to be\nwith him in this, the last hour....\n\nMarahna--a princess among these strange folk--was giving her life when\nanother could have been in her place. And she smiled tremulously,\nbravely, as her eyes locked with his, as, speechless and spellbound,\nhe stared through the eyelets of gold.\n\nThe priest was reaching for his head-dress, Jerry tensed. The moment\nhad come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was ready. As the weight left his shoulders, he dropped, with one\nswift movement, his golden disguise. The robe fell in folds at his\nfeet. He stared in silence, through narrowing eyes, at the face of the\nhead priest above him. Then, leaping straight up, he fastened one\nhand, sinewy, sun-browned and strong, on the white neck below the\nwhite face. They crashed back, to land on the ramp and roll,\nstruggling, toward the edge.\n\nJerry's hold never slackened. He felt his fingers sink deep in the\nflesh. He came to his knees, then up, to hold the writhing figure at\narm's length. Then, heaving with all his strength, he whipped the man\ninto the air, to drag him in one leaping bound for the sheltering\ndarkness beyond.\n\nA figure was entering with him--a slim, naked figure, with glowing and\nworshipping eyes.\n\nBehind them the silence was shattered. Jerry saw, as he stepped from\nthe light, the riot of figures that surged in hysterical frenzy\nthrough the great hall. The priests were leaping among them ... the\ntall priest who had guarded the door was fighting his way through the\nmob.\n\nJerry loosed his quivering hand from the throat it held. He cast the\nfigure from him. And he blinked his eyes to make them serve him in the\nblackness all about.\n\nBeside him, a form, invisible in the dark, was stroking at his face,\nand a voice was whispering tremulously: \"Cherrie ... Cherrie!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tumult in the great hall reached them but faintly. Jerry Foster\nstrove desperately to focus his eyes in that darkness of utter night.\nA dim glow from the portal crept softly in to bring faint illumination\nto the farther wall. Slowly his eyes found that which they feared yet\nsought.\n\nOff in the dark, directly opposite the entrance, was a white and\nghostly thing. Formless and vague, it wavered and blurred to his\nstraining eyes. He fumbled clumsily for a match, one of his treasured\nstore. He must see--he must know what was waiting--\n\nThe match flared to a point of brilliance in the murky gloom. It\nshowed, on the floor where they stood, a litter of dried\nvegetation--food, doubtless placed there as an offering. It was dry\nnow, and dusty, and through it there shone the bleak whiteness of\nbones. Beyond was the floor, and beyond that.... The whiteness that\nhad been but a blur grew sharply distinct.\n\nJerry could not have told what he expected the light to disclose.\nCertainly it was not the heaping of coils, milk-white and ghastly,\nthat took shape before his staring eyes. Above them a head hung in\nair. It was motionless--lifeless, almost--like the coiled body that\nheld it. But the eyes, black and staring, in the bloated, bulging\nhead, made its poised stillness the more deadly.\n\nEven in the dark Jerry had sensed the hypnotic spell of unseen eyes.\nVisible, they held him in a rigid, unreasoning terror. Unreal,\nunthinkable, this serpentlike horror, tremendous and ghastly in its\nloathsome whiteness. A dweller in the dark, used by the priests as a\nsymbol and a threat for the ignorant folk who trusted and believed\nthem. And it held him, stilled and stricken, in its evil spell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flame was scorching Jerry's hand that nervelessly opened to\nrelease the match. The man was like a statue, frozen to mental\ndeadness. About his feet a light was playing, unseen. A bit of the dry\nstuff sprang brightly to yellow flame. Neither seeing nor feeling, the\nfigure of Jerry Foster stood, held in the deadly magic of the\nmalignant eyes.\n\nDimly he sensed that the prostrate body on the floor was that of\nMarahna. Vaguely he knew when the form of the priest took a halting\nstep forward. The fire his match had kindled was rising about his\nfeet. The flames seared and stabbed with a pain that reached his\ndulled brain. Quivering and shaken, the body of Jerry Foster reacted\nagain to a conscious thought. He leaped quickly as the deadly witchery\nleft him, and he tore at the smoldering cloth about his legs.\n\nAnd now he knew the thing before him for what it was. Shocking in its\ngigantic size, more so in the concentrated venom of its gaze, it was\nthe flabby, scaly and crusted whiteness of the thing that filled his\nbeing with a deadly nausea. He stared with a sickened fascination at\nthe flabby, drooping pouches beside the mouth, the distorted, bulging\nhead and the short legs, armed with long, curving talons--legs that\nsprang from out the neck to clutch and tear at what the jaws might\nhold.\n\nDeadly and hateful--loathsome beyond all imagining--still Jerry Foster\nfound it was something a man could meet. Its devilish power to\nparalyze and still the soul of him was gone.\n\nHe snatched quickly for the gun at his belt and knelt to aim--then\nchecked his finger on the trigger. The figure of the priest had come\nbetween him and the monster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe golden robe was dragging. It fell to the floor, to gleam dully in\nthe flickering light of the fire. Against the heaping coils of white\nthe priest was outlined, drawn, as Jerry sensed, against the protest\nof every fiber of his being. Yet, one stiff step at a time, he went\nfaltering on. The hair above his white face was torn in disarray. And\nthe face itself, so exultantly fierce in its hour of triumph, now a\nmask of quivering, hopeless terror.\n\nThe head of the monster came slowly to life. It raised and raised into\nthe air. The mouth gaped open with a hoarse, sucking sound, then\nstruck, like a whip of light, at the doomed priest.\n\nHis screams, as the thing descended upon him, rang through the roar of\nthe forty-five. Jerry fired again where the black eyes showed above\nthe writhing body of their prey. The head jerked backward, to tower in\nthe darkness overhead. The mouth disgorged its contents to the floor.\n\nOnly for a shuddering instant did the monster pause. Then it launched\nits great bulk in a counter-attack, while the automatic poured out the\nrest of its futile lead.\n\nThe gun was knocked from his grasp as the great head smashed past,\nswerved from its aim by the blinding bullets. Jerry knew only that his\nknife was in his hand as the great scabrous coils closed\ninevitably about him.\n\nVaguely he heard the shouting from behind as the writhing folds\nengulfed him. He stabbed blindly at the scaly mass; again and again\nhis knife ripped slashingly at the abhorrence that drew him close.\nThen his arm, too, was caught in the crushing loathsome embrace....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe felt no pain--the pressure alone was insufferable. His head was\ndrawn back. Above him the horrible eyes glared into his--there was\nblood dripping from the jaws....\n\nHe saw it in the brilliance of a light that flashed in blue heat\noverhead. There came in his ears a vast roaring of sound, a great\nheat-blast that scorched and burned at his face. The crushing pressure\nwas relaxed. He went reeling to the floor, as the great coils whirled\nhigh into the air.\n\nHe was stunned by the fall, his body inert and relaxed. But he knew\nthrough it all that from somewhere above there was shrieking of\ngas--blue, roaring fires--a flame that tore blastingly into a writhing\ncontortion beyond.\n\nThe tall figure of a priest was bending over him, but it was the voice\nof Winslow that was in his ears--a blessed, human voice--when he\nawoke.\n\n\"Thank God, I made it,\" the voice was saying, over and over. \"Thank\nGod, I found the ship and got back here in time!\"\n\nThere was light within the cavern. The burning fungus was extinguished\nby the smothering coils that had crashed upon it, but beyond was a\nwaving plume of yellow where a blue flame shot against a wall of rock.\n\nAnd Jerry, through the stress and riot of emotion that overwhelmed\nhim, laughed chokingly, wildly, at the words of his companion.\n\n\"It is sodium,\" Winslow was saying in explanation, as he saw Jerry's\neyes resting on the light. \"A hydrogen flame, but there's sodium in\nthe rocks that turns the flame yellow. I rigged up a flame-thrower of\nhydrogen.\"\n\n\"You would,\" Jerry gasped through hysterical laughter. \"You would do\njust that, and make your way back to this hell just to save me--you\ndamn fool inventor!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe clung to Winslow, who was raising him to his feet. Marahna was\nbeside him, robed in the golden garment of the priest. She placed her\nhands beside his face to turn him toward the further wall. The light\nwas fickle, but it showed him, as it rose and fell, the blackened,\nswollen body of the monster, still writhing in its death struggle. And\nbeside it, blasted and charred, the head of the obscene sun god,\nsevered by the cutting, obliterating blast, lay flabby and black in a\nsilent heap.\n\n\"Rather effective,\" said Winslow complacently, \"though I didn't have\nmuch to work with. Two small vials of my liquid and a hand generator\nto furnish the current. A tubular strut from the frame of the ship\nmade the blow-pipe.\"\n\n\"And these?\" Jerry questioned, and pointed to the priest's vestments\nthat Winslow still wore.\n\n\"Oh, it was all quiet up above,\" said the inventor, \"and I came down\nthe rope. But there was one of them waiting at the bottom. He didn't\nneed these any more when I left, so I took them to help get about--\"\n\nHe stopped, to cross quickly and pick up the flame-thrower as the\nflame died away. It roared as he worked at the mechanism, then\ndwindled again. Its light, for an instant, was reflected in a liquid\non the floor.\n\n\"Broken!\" said Winslow in an anguished voice. \"The vials are\ngone--smashed! And I counted on this to hold off the mob, to get us\nsafely out....\"\n\nHe regarded the instrument with silent dismay. The blue flame, as he\nheld it, flickered and died.\n\n\"Not so good!\" said Jerry slowly. He stopped to retrieve the knife.\nThis, he reflected, was their sole weapon of defense. In the dim light\nhis eyes met with Winslow's in mutual comprehension of their plight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were caverns beyond, dark and forbidding. Did they lead to the\nouter world? Or, instead, was it not probable that they went to some\ndeep, subterranean dens, from which this monster had learned to come\nat the priests' summons? Jerry put from his mind all thought of escape\nin that direction.\n\n\"And Marahna, too,\" he told Winslow. \"What will become of her?\"\n\nThe girl got the essence of the question. Fumbling for phrases that\nthey knew, she made them believe that she was safe. Her people, she\ntold them, would protect her.\n\n\"Yes,\" Jerry agreed. \"I guess that's right. She's a princess, you\nknow,\" he reminded Winslow, \"and the great mass of the people look up\nto her. Only the priests and warrior gangs will be opposed. But how\ncan we get through them?\"\n\nThe question was unanswered.\n\n\"We've got to knock them cold some way,\" said the inventor. \"Got to\ngive them a fright that will last till they let us get through. Once\nat the big shaft where we came down, we can make our getaway. But how\nto do it....\" His voice died away in dismal thought.\n\nJerry's eyes were casting about. The priest's robe? No, not good\nenough. It had brought Winslow through, but it couldn't take them\nback. Marahna? No help there: she had enough to do to protect herself\nfrom the fury of the priests.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis eyes rested again on the steaming, blackened mass that still\nshowed the horrible features that had marked the head of the monster.\nThe sun god! There was an idea there.\n\n\"Come!\" he said to Winslow, and walked swiftly across to the severed\nhead.\n\nHe had to steel his nerves before he could lay hands upon the vile\nthing. The paws were still attached behind the head. He took a grip on\none and pulled. The great mass moved.\n\n\"I don't get the idea,\" said Winslow.\n\n\"Nor I,\" Jerry admitted, \"but there's an idea here.\" His thoughts were\nracing in the moment's silence.\n\n\"I've got it,\" he shouted. \"I've got it! If only I can make Marahna\nunderstand!\" He led the girl nearer to the door, where his signs\ncould be seen more plainly.\n\n\"You,\" he told her, \"go out there.\" He pointed to the place where the\npriests had stood. \"Tell your people\"--he took the attitude of the\norator declaiming to his audience--\"we have come here from the sun.\"\nAgain his signs were plain. Marahna nodded. This plainly was literal\ntruth to her.\n\n\"Tell them,\" he continued earnestly, \"we have saved them from this\nthing. Tell them it was no sun god, but a monster that the priests had\nkept. Monster!\" he exclaimed, and pointed to the head and to the body\nthat still writhed and jerked spasmodically. \"No god--no!\" And again\nthe girl showed her understanding. Her eyes were glowing.\n\n\"Then,\" said Jerry, indicating Winslow and himself, \"we will take the\nhead that they have worshipped, and we'll drag it out and throw it to\nthe priests.\" His gestures were graphic. The girl nodded her head in\nan ecstasy of comprehension.\n\n\"And then,\" Jerry added softly for Winslow's hearing, \"we'll beat it.\nAnd, with luck, we'll make it safe.\"\n\n\"There's a chance,\" said Winslow softly, \"there's a chance--and that's\nall we ask.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's up to you, Marahna,\" Jerry told her. His words were meaningless,\nbut the tone sufficed. She drew herself proudly erect, wrapped herself\nclosely in the robe of braided gold, and stepped firmly and fearlessly\nthrough the portal and down toward the platform of the priests.\n\nThe two men watched from the shadows. Beyond the outline of the\nplatform they saw the warrior clans, a phalanx of protecting bodies.\nAnd beyond, drawn back in huddled consternation, were masses of\nwhite-faced people--Marahna's people--who listened, now, in wondering\nsilence to their princess.\n\nMarahna made her way slowly to the platform's edge. Of all the\ncountless ones to have gone that road, she was the first ever to\nreturn. She stood silent, while her eyes found their way scornfully\nover the enemy below. Then looking beyond them, she began to speak.\n\nHer soft voice echoed liquidly throughout the room. She gestured, and\nJerry knew that she was giving them the message.\n\nFrom the priests there came once a hoarse, inarticulate growl of hate\nand unbelief. She silenced them with her hand. She pointed to the\nheavens, and she told them of the sun and of the two who were true\nchildren of the sun, who had come to save them from their false god.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer voice rose as she told her people in impassioned tones that which\nshe had seen. And she was shouting above the tumult of the priests and\npointing directly at them as she made the roof echo with the message:\n\"_Oong devah! Oong devah!_\"\n\n\"The god is dead,\" translated Jerry. \"_Devah_ means death; she said\nthat of herself before we left. Come on!\" he shouted, and laid-hold of\none great claw. \"It's our turn now.\"\n\nWinslow was tugging at the other foot. Between them they dragged into\nthe light the obscene burden. Down the long ramp they took it and off\nupon the platform of the priests, where Marahna waited.\n\nThe priests, as Jerry's quick glance showed, were milling wildly\nabout. It seemed that a charge was soon to follow, but the commotion\nceased as the two men come upon the platform, hauling between them the\ngreat scorched head of \"Oong.\" The vast hall was without movement or\nsound as they made their way out to the front. Jerry stood erect and\nfaced the crowd.\n\nHe pointed, as had Marahna, toward the sun somewhere above those thick\nmasses of rock; he traced it in its course across the sky; he pointed\nto Winslow and himself. And in loudest tones he roared throughout the\nroom his message. \"Oong,\" he shouted, \"_Oong devah!_\"\n\n\"I'll count three,\" he whispered in the utter silence. \"Then let 'er\ngo!\"\n\nAgain he took a firm hold on the flabby paw.\n\n\"One,\" he whispered, and swung his body with the word. \"Two ... and\n_three_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men heaved mightily upon the gruesome horror. The head swung\nghastly in scorched whiteness into the air. The dead jaws fell open as\nit crashed downward among the huddled, stricken priests.\n\n\"This way!\" commanded Winslow. He had been carefully appraising the\nopenings in the crowd. \"And don't hurry! Remember, you're a god to\nthem--or something a darn sight worse.\"\n\nHeads proudly erect, the two strode firmly down the pathway of golden\nlight. The room was silent as the few they met fell back in cringing\nfear. Slowly, interminably, the long triumphal march was made across\nthe rocky cavern of the moon.\n\nNot till they reached the portal did the silence break. The shrieks of\nthe priests and the clashing of copper were behind them, as they\nvanished with steady steps from out the room.\n\n\"Now run!\" ordered Winslow. \"Run as if the devils from hell were after\nyou--and I think they are!\" The two tore madly down the corridor whose\ndouble rows of brightness made possible their utmost speed.\n\nThere was the narrowing of the passage--Jerry remembered it--where\nthey came out at the foot of the great shaft, the dead throat of the\nvolcano. Behind them the shrieks and clamor echoed close. A rope was\ndangling from far up at the top.\n\nJerry leaped for it before he recalled the condition of his arm. In\nthe excitement of the encounter he had forgotten that the arm was\nstill in no shape for a long hand-over-hand climb.\n\n\"I can't make it,\" he said, and looked about quickly. There were\nbaskets of fungus growth, already dried from the heat of the mid-day\nsun that had shone where it grew. He dragged one to the narrow part of\nthe tunnel. Winslow tugged at another and threw it up as a barricade.\nA chalk-white figure in copper sheathing was clambering upon it as he\nworked at another of the nets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJerry let go the fiber basket he was dragging and drew his knife as he\nsprang to meet the assault. A sharp cutting edge was unknown to these\nworkers in copper. Jerry slipped under the raised bludgeoning copper\nweapon to plunge the knife into a white throat. Then, without a look\nat the body he helped Winslow, struggling with another load.\n\nThey completed the barricade. A heap of fungus made a raised place\nwhere Jerry leaped. Commanding the top of the pile that blocked the\nchoked throat of the passage, he was ready for the next figure that\nleaped wildly up.\n\nIt would take them a while, Jerry saw, to learn of this scintillant\ndeath that struck at them from close quarters. His knife flashed again\nand again as he took the men one at a time and let their limp bodies\nroll back to the passage beyond.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe assault was checked when Jerry shouted to his companion. \"Tie the\nrope around me,\" he ordered, \"up under my arms ... then you go on up.\nWhen you get there pull up--and for the Lord's sake pull fast!\"\n\n\"Go on,\" he shouted. \"I can hold them for a while--\" He turned swiftly\nto take a leaping body upon the red point of his knife.\n\nHe felt the rope about him as he fought, knew by its twitching when\nWinslow started the long climb, and prayed dumbly for strength to hold\nhis weak fortress till the other could hoist himself up to the top.\n\nHe was fighting blindly as they came on in endless succession, the\nfigures of frenzied priests leaping grotesquely beyond. Only the\nstrategic position he had taken allowed him to turn the wild assault\nagain and again. They could only reach him by ones and twos, but the\nend must come soon. There were priests tearing at the foot of the\nbarricade.... The cold winds that came down from above revived him,\nbut it helped the figures ripping at the fiber cords. The dry fungus\nfragments whirled gaily away and down the passage in the wind.\n\nThe wind! The draft was blowing from him, directly upon his attackers.\nJerry struggled and clinched with another that bounded beside him, and\nknew as he fought that a weapon was at hand. His knife found the lower\nedge of copper, and the figure screamed as he rolled it down the\nslope. He slipped the knife into his left hand as he fumbled with his\nright.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis precious matches! He struck one on the rock; it broke in his\ntrembling fingers. Another--there were so few left. He drew it with\ninfinite care on the surface of rock. The figures below tore in frenzy\nat the weakening barricade, while yet others stood waiting at this\nsign of some new form of magic.\n\nThey shouted again, as they had when, those long days ago, he had\nlighted a cigarette before their horrified gaze. Jerry shielded the\ntiny blaze in his hand to bring it beneath a papery leaf beside him.\n\nThe flame flashed and dwindled. He dared not drop back to set fire to\nthe base of the heap. But even in the exhaustion and strain of the\nmoment Jerry Foster still knew the value of the showman's tricks in\nreaching the fears of these white-faced fighters.\n\nWith grandiloquent gesture he raised another of the tindery fragments\nand ignited it from the first. Another, and he had the beginning of a\nfire. He lit another piece, and, when he had it blazing, dropped it\nbehind him and kept on with the show.\n\nA large piece became a flaming torch, and he waved it before him and\nlaughed to see the warriors cringe. A cloud of smoke was billowing\nabout him--he leaped to safety through a rising wall of flame.\n\nThe rear slope of the barricade became a furnace; the wind behind him\nswept the smoke clouds down the passage. He heard, and sank back\nweakly on the ground as it came to him, the screaming riot where a mob\nof terrified warriors fought and struck to turn the horde that\nclamored behind them and pushed them on. The blast roared over the\nheaped fuel and poured downward from the crest. The noise of the\nretreat went silent in the distance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpent and exhausted, Jerry Foster lay panting upon the stone floor.\nThe breath of cold and life came down the long shaft from the crater.\nHad Winslow gained the top? Was he equal to the climb? Jerry hardly\nfelt the jerking of the rope about his shoulders, but he knew as, in\nfrantic haste, it drew him scraping up the long side of the shaft.\n\nThe biting cold above revived him, and again a scene of desolation was\nspread before his eyes. Winslow fumbled with the knots and released\nhim from the rope.\n\n\"Come on!\" he shouted, and extended a helping hand as they leaped and\nraced across the rocky floor.\n\nJerry again was vividly, strongly alive as the cold winds swept him.\nHe leaped hugely through the whirling wisps of dried out\nvegetation--the sun had stripped the surface of every living thing.\nAgain the rocky slopes rose naked in the rosy light of evening. The\nsun was hidden below a distant range of jagged hills. The long night\nwas begun.\n\n\"You're going the wrong way,\" Jerry shouted. \"We left it over there.\"\nHe stopped to point where the sun had set. \"See, that's where we\nfought the beasts--\"\n\n\"Come on!\" repeated Winslow. \"Hurry! We mustn't lose out now. I flew\nthe ship over this way while I was up here before.\"\n\nA ridge of rock cut off the view where Winslow pointed. \"Bully for\nyou!\" Jerry shouted and turned to follow. They stopped as the slope\nahead, from its multitude of honeycomb caverns, erupted men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe priests were ahead, and behind them swarmed their men. Vindictive\nand revengeful, the wily enemy was fighting to the end. The two\nstopped in consternation.\n\n\"What's the use!\" demanded Jerry. His voice was tired, utterly\nhopeless. \"And the ship's right over there....\"\n\n\"A million miles away,\" said Winslow slowly, \"as far as we're\nconcerned.\" The army was sweeping down the long slope: they had found\ntheir quarry. There were other figures, too, pouring from the throat\nof the volcano--white, naked figures that swarmed in growing numbers\nand rushed across upon them from the rear.\n\n\"Trapped,\" said Jerry Foster savagely, \"and we almost made it.\" He\nrose wearily to his feet. \"We'll take it standing.\"\n\nThe armored warriors were approaching; in leaping triumph they raced\nto be the first ones at the death. The shouts of the priests were\nringing encouragement in their ears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the leaders from the rear were nearer. One deep breath Jerry drew\nas he turned to meet them. Then stared, astonished, as the figures\nswept past. They streamed by in confusion. They were armed with rocks,\nwith clubs or copper metal--some even carried bars of gold above their\nheads. They came in a great swarm that swept past and beyond them. And\nthey met, like an engulfing wave, the bounding figures of the men in\ncopper. Smothered and lost were the warriors in the horde that poured\nincreasingly on.\n\nThe wave, before Jerry's eyes, swept on over the crest, while he still\nstood in amazed unbelief at the battle that raged.\n\nIt was Marahna who brought understanding. He turned to see her kneel\nin sobbing, thankful abasement at his feet.\n\nMarahna! Her people! She had saved them! There was time needed for the\nfull force of the truth to banish the hopeless despair from his heart.\nThen he stooped to raise the crouching figure with arms that were\nsuddenly strong.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pale rose light of the departed sun above shone softly within a\nrocky valley of the moon. It tipped the tall crags with lavender hues,\nand it touched with soft gleaming reflections a blunted cylinder of\naluminum alloy.\n\nThe valley was silent, save for the hushed whispers of wondering\nthousands who peopled the enclosing hills, and the rushing roar from\nthe cylinder itself where the inventor was testing his machine.\n\nThere were figures in priestly robes--scores of them--and they were\nsurrounded by a white throng that, silent and watchful, held them\ncaptive.\n\nBeyond, in the open, where bare rock made a black rolling floor, there\nwere two who stood alone. The golden figure of a girl, and beside her,\nJerry Foster, in wordless indecision.\n\nBehind him was the ship. Its muffled thunder came softly to his\nunheeding ears. He looked at the girl steadily, thoughtfully.\n\nGone was all trace of her imperious dignity. The Princess Marahna was\nnow all woman. And Jerry, looking into her dark eyes, read plainly the\nyearning and adoration in their depths. The Princess Marahna had\nforgotten her deference to the god in her love for the man. The tale\nwas told in her flushed face, openly, unashamed.\n\nAnd his gray eyes were thoughtful and tender as he gazed into hers. He\nwas thinking, was Jerry Foster, of many things. And he was weighing\nthem carefully. His hand clasped and unclasped at something safely\nhidden in his pocket. He had taken it from his pack; he had wanted\nsomething for Marahna, something she would treasure.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now she was offering him herself. He could take her with him, take\nher to that far-off world that she never dreamed existed. He could\nshow her the things of that world, its wonders and beauties. He could\ntrain her in its ways. He would watch over her, love her.... And she\nwould be miserable and heartsick for the sight of this awful\ndesolation. He knew it--he told himself it was the truth--and he hated\nhimself for the telling.\n\nThe voice of Winslow aroused him. The inventor had come from his ship.\n\"We had better be starting,\" he said.\n\nThe slim figure of the girl in her robe of pure gold trembled visibly.\nShe knew, it was plain, the import of the words. She spoke rapidly,\nbeseechingly, in her own tongue. The words were liquid music in the\nair. Then, realizing their impotence, she resorted to her poor\nvocabulary of their own strange sounds.\n\n\"No!\" she said, and shook her head vehemently. \"No--no!\"\n\nShe motioned to wait, and she called loud and clear across the silence\nto her own people. There was a stir about the priests. One in the\nrobes and head-dress of the high priest was brought forward, led by\ntwo others of her men. They stopped a few steps from her and bowed\nlow.\n\nAgain she called, and the leaders among the vast throng came, too, and\nmade their obeisance before her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe turned then to Jerry. And now it was Marahna, Princess of the\nMoon, who stood quiet and poised before him. The light, he saw, made\nsoft wavelets of radiance in her hair, and her eyes were still glowing\nand tender. She stepped forward toward the priest.\n\nThe helmet of the sun god was upon his head. It marked him, Jerry\nknew, as the master of their world. True, they had bowed in\nsubmission to that other master, whose vile head lay horrible and\nharmless on the floor of the great hall--they had believed in the\ncommands the priests had pretended to receive from him--but this\nemblem on the helmet marked the leader of the race, the master of this\nworld, for these simple folk.\n\nMarahna reached her slim hands and lifted the thing of gold. She\nturned, and held it above the startled eyes of Jerry Foster, and she\nplaced it upon his head with all the dignity that became a queen. A\nword from her, and the men before him dropped in humbleness to the\nground. The Princess Marahna was among them in honoring salutation to\ntheir king.\n\nJerry was beyond speech. Not so Winslow. \"It looks to me,\" he said\ndryly, \"as if you were being offered the kingdom of the earth--I mean\nthe moon. Think it over, Jerry--think it over.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Jerry Foster thought it over, deeply and soberly. He could rule\nthis people, he and Marahna, rule in peace and quiet and comfort. He\ncould bring them knowledge and wisdom of infinite help; he could make\ntheir new civilization a measure of advancement for a whole race. He\ncould teach them, train them, instruct them. And he and Marahna--there\nwould be children who would be princes born--could be happy--for a\ntime. And then ... and then he would be old. Old and lonely for his\nkind, hungering and longing for his own people. As Marahna would be on\nearth, so would he be here....\n\nHis decision was formed. And with it he knew he must not hurt the\nheart of Marahna. She loved him, Jerry Foster, the man. He must leave\nher as Jerry Foster, the god, child of the sun. He stood suddenly to\nhis full height, and who shall say that for a moment the man did not\napproach the stature of divinity--for he was wholly kind.\n\nHe placed a hand upon the head of the kneeling girl before him. He\nheld her in her submissive pose, then, turning to the waiting men, he\nspoke in measured tones.\n\n\"I thank you,\" he said, and the words came from a full heart, \"but my\nplace is not here. I leave with you one more worthy.\"\n\nBefore their wondering gaze he removed the glowing circlet from his\nhead; he leaned to place it on the head of Marahna, humbled before\nhim. With strong hands he raised her to her feet. His look, so tender\nyet reserved, was full of meaning. She followed his every sign.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waved once toward the sun, hidden behind the distant hills: he\npointed again to Winslow and himself and to their shining ship: and\nagain he marked the going of the sun. His meaning was plain--these\nchildren of the sun must return to their far-off home.\n\nHe turned now to Marahna. In his hand was the object he had taken from\nhis pack. It was a treasured thing, this locket of platinum on its\nthin and lacy chain; it had been his mother's, and he thought of her\nnow as he opened the clasp to show his own face framed within the\noval. His mother--she had worn this. And she would have approved, he\nknew, of its disposal.\n\nGravely he faced Marahna. He showed her the picture within the case,\nthen held it aloft where all might see. He closed it and taught her\nthe pressure that released the spring. Then, with gentle dignity that\nmade of the gesture a rite, he placed the chain about the neck of\nPrincess Marahna--Queen, now, of the People of the Moon. And he knew\nthat he gave into her keeping their only relic of a being from the\nsun. It marked her beyond all future question with a symbol of\nmastery. And it made of him a god.\n\nAnd even a queen may not aspire to such an one.\n\nIt was well that Winslow's hand was there to guide him as he walked\nwith unseeing eyes toward the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTime may lose at times all meaning and measure--moments become\ntimeless. It seemed ages to Jerry Foster when Winslow spoke in casual\ntones. \"I'm going straight up,\" he said, above the generator's roar.\n\"Then we'll swing around above the other side. We'll follow the\nsun--make the full circle of the moon before we start.\"\n\nBut Jerry neither thought nor heard. His eyes were close to a window\nof thick glass. Below him was a shrinking, dwindling landscape,\nwind-swept and desolate.\n\nThere was a multitude of faces, turned worshipping toward the sky. On\none, who stood apart in tiny loneliness, his vision centered. He\nwatched and strained his aching eyes until the figure was no more.\nOnly the pale rose of a dying sun, and a torn, volcanic waste that\ntugged strangely at his heart.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered mechanically, \"yes, we'll go round with the sun ...\na couple of sun gods.\"\n\nHe laughed strangely as he regarded his companion.\n\nIf Winslow wondered at the weariness in the voice he made no sign. He\nwas busy with a rheostat that made thunderous roaring of the blast\nbehind their ship: that swung them in a sweeping arc through velvet\nskies, away from the far side of the moon, to follow the path of the\nsetting sun--homeward bound.\n\n\n\n\n_The Readers' Corner_\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_\n\nAstounding Stories\n\n[Illustration:]\n\n\n\"_Second Better Than First_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The second number of Astounding Stories is better than the\n     first. \"Spawn of the Stars,\" by Charles Willard Diffin, was\n     the best story, closely followed by \"Creatures of the\n     Light,\" by Sophie Wenzel Ellis and \"The Beetle Horde,\" by\n     Victor Rousseau. I like stories of vibration as in \"Mad\n     Music,\" and of acceleration, as in \"The Thief of Time.\" I am\n     glad to see Harl Vincent in the pages of Astounding Stories.\n     I have read many good stories by him. Interplanetary stories\n     are my favorites, and the more you have of them the better.\n\n     I wish that you would put Astounding Stories out twice a\n     month or put out a quarterly containing twice as much\n     reading material as the monthly. In this you could put one\n     book-length novel and a few shorter stories.\n\n     Are you going to start a department containing the readers'\n     letters soon?--Jack R. Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Avenue,\n     Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n_Size and Paper_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I certainly am glad to see your magazine appear on the\n     newsstands. I also view with appreciation the fact that you\n     have such brilliant authors as Harl Vincent and Captain S.\n     P. Meek, U. S. A., on your list of contributors. Your\n     stories are of the very highest value in the line of Science\n     Fiction. However, I did not like \"The Corpse on the\n     Grating.\" It did not have an inkling of scientific\n     background. I really am surprised it was published in a\n     Science Fiction magazine. Aside from the fact that the idea\n     of the story was merely a fantastical surmise I was very\n     favorably impressed with the author's style and his use of\n     the English language.\n\n     Why don't you try for some more of the works of the other\n     well-known authors in this line of fiction?\n\n     My main object in writing this letter was that I think you\n     rub the name of Science Fiction in the dust by printing it\n     on such paper and in such a small magazine. If you intend to\n     compete with your several contemporaries, you will almost\n     have to alter your size and quality of your paper.\n\n     You might include a full page Illustration for each story\n     also, but, you will admit, that to combat these other\n     influential Science Fiction magazines, you will have to put\n     your magazine on a par materially with the others in your\n     line.\n\n     I admire the type of stories which you publish and want to\n     see your magazine get ahead.--Warren Williams, 545\n     Dorchester, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_They Will!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am a monthly reader of your Astounding Stories and I am\n     greatly interested in them.\n\n     The best story I have so far read is \"Creatures of the\n     Light.\" It is a story of Super-science indeed. If the author\n     of this story would write more like it, I am sure they would\n     be greatly appreciated.\n\n     Here is hoping that more of their kind appear in the very\n     near future. Yours for more good stories.--Quenton Stockman,\n     245 Dixon Street, Portland, Oregon.\n\n\n\"_Surpasses the First_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished the February issue of your magazine. It\n     surpasses the first issue by far. I am glad to see that you\n     have eight stories in this issue. That is just enough. I\n     like one serial (not too long), one or two novelettes, and\n     five or six short stories in each issue. Tell Captain S. P.\n     Meek to write more adventures of Dr. Bird.\n\n     I have arranged the stories of the first two issues\n     according to my own liking. Excellent: \"The Beetle Horde\"\n     and \"Phantoms of Reality.\" Good: \"The Care of Horror,\"\n     \"Tanks\" and \"Invisible Death.\" Fair: \"The Stolen Mind\" and\n     \"Compensation.\"\n\n     In the second issue: Excellent: \"Creatures of the Light,\"\n     \"Old Crompton's Secret,\" \"The Beetle Horde\" and \"Spawn of\n     the Stars.\" Good: \"The Thief of Time\" and \"Mad Music.\" Fair:\n     \"The Corpse on the Grating\" and \"Into Space.\"\n\n     I hope there will be more stories under \"Excellent\" next\n     month--Ward Elmore, 2012 Avenue J, Ft. Madison, Ia.\n\n\n\"_Only One Trouble_--\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished reading your new magazine and think\n     it's great. The only trouble with it is that it doesn't have\n     enough stories.\n\n     I liked \"Phantoms of Reality,\" by Ray Cummings, best, and\n     \"The Cave of Horror,\" by Capt. S. P. Meek, next best. \"The\n     Beetle Horde,\" and \"Tanks\" were also good.\n\n     Ray Cummings and S. P. Meek are among my favorite Science\n     Fiction authors.\n\n     I like best interplanetary stories and stories of the\n     aircraft of the future. I would like to see a good\n     interplanetary story by R. H. Romans in this magazine pretty\n     soon.\n\n     Other good authors whose stories I would like to read are:\n     Dr. David H Keller, Dr. Miles J. Breuer, Lilith Lorraine, Ed\n     Earl Repp and Walter Kateley.\n\n     In your editorial you mention the fact that some day in the\n     future a person can disintegrate his body in New York and\n     reintegrate it in China. I would like to see a good story\n     about that by either Ray Cummings or S.P. Meek.\n\n     Something else: why not make your magazine a little bigger\n     and include a scientific article or two once in a while?--J.\n     W. Latimer, 1000 East 8th Street, National City, Calif.\n\n\n\"_No Horror Stories_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am taking this opportunity to let you know what I think of\n     Astounding Stories. The worst fault is the tendency to print\n     terror stories. Please don't do this. If I never see another\n     story like \"The Corpse on the Grating\" in your magazine it\n     will be too soon.\n\n     Don't print so many detective stories. Capt. Meek's splendid\n     stories are plenty. Please start a discussion column and put\n     Wesso's drawings inside the magazine, too.\n\n     Are you planning on any reprints? I would like to see some\n     reprints of Ray Cummings', A. Merritt's, H. G. Wells',\n     Garret Smith's and George A. England's stories soon.\n\n     \"Phantoms of Reality,\" \"The Beetle Horde,\" \"The Cave of\n     Horror,\" \"Into Space,\" \"Creatures of the Light,\" and \"Old\n     Crompton's Secret\" were splendid.\n\n     I hope for fewer detective stories and no horror\n     stories.--Joe Stone, 123 20th Street, Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\n_We Liked It, Too!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Just a line to tell you that I bought my first copy of\n     Astounding Stories and they certainly are good, especially\n     \"Creatures of the Light,\" by Sophie Wenzel Ellis. It's the\n     best short story I've read in ages. I hope to read more by\n     her in the future. Yours for success.--F. J. Michaslow,\n     Battery \"D,\" Ft. Hancock, N. J.\n\n\n\"_Strikes a Mystic Chord_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I think that your Astounding Story Magazine is a fine\n     magazine. It seems to strike a mystic cord within me and\n     makes me respond to it.\n\n     One thing lacking--I believe, that is--a department for\n     letters from your readers.\n\n     \"Spawn of the Stars\" is certainly a fine scientific story.\n\n     I wish that the author of \"Into Space\" would write a sequel\n     to his story.--Ronald Bainbridge, Rockford, Illinois.\n\n\n_We're Avoiding Reprints_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am writing again about Astounding Stories. It seems more\n     people are interested in science to-day than ever before,\n     and an easy and interesting way to gain this knowledge is\n     through reading an entertaining science story.\n\n     Regarding stories in your February issue, will list them\n     according to my likes and dislikes. \"Into Space\" and \"Mad\n     Music\" contained science maybe not impossible in the future.\n     \"Spawn of the Stars,\" \"The Beetle Horde,\" \"Creatures of the\n     Light,\" \"The Thief of Time\" and \"Old Compton's Secret\" were\n     very interesting science, and good reading, but \"The Corpse\n     on the Grating\" did not appeal to me.\n\n     I like interplanetary stories and stories of what might be\n     on other planets.\n\n     I notice some familiar names among your authors. Why not\n     print some (not too many) stories from H. G. Wells, E. R.\n     Burroughs and Jules Verne? Some of their stories which were\n     considered just wild dreams of the author at the time of\n     writing have actually become a reality, as, for instance,\n     the submarine. If you keep on as you started or improve I\n     can see only success--C. E. Anderson, 3504 Colfax Avenue\n     South, Minneapolis, Minn.\n\n\n_A Few Favorites_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am an electrical engineer. I read the last two issues of\n     your magazine. I liked it very much. It is thrilling and\n     very well edited. I will buy it regularly.\n\n     I liked \"Invisible Death\" best. \"The Beetle Horde\" was good,\n     \"Phantoms of Reality,\" good. \"Into Space\" and \"Mad Music,\"\n     very good. \"Creatures of the Light,\" \"Old Crompton's Secret\"\n     and \"Spawn of the Stars,\" good.--Adolph Wasserrogel, Gedden\n     Terrace, Waterbury, Conn.\n\n\n\"_Going Some!_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I purchased one of your magazines when I first saw them. I\n     always had a liking for Super-science stories, but your\n     magazine was the best I ever got hold of. Thought I could\n     never wait until the next issue to finish \"The Beetle\n     Horde.\" I believe \"The Cave of Horror\" was the best story in\n     that issue. It really seemed as if it could be true.\n\n     Due respect must be paid the author of \"The Corpse on the\n     Grating,\" for it was exciting and fantastic. \"Phantoms of\n     Reality\" was good.\n\n     All the stories in the second magazine seemed as good as the\n     best of the first number, and that's going some.\n\n     May you succeed in getting the same good and better stories\n     as you have in the first two issues of a magazine that I am\n     sure will grow to fame.--Harold Rakestraw, Box 25, Winthop,\n     Wash.\n\n\n_We Intend To_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Having read the first two issues of your new magazine, I\n     find it has a larger variety of stories than any of the\n     other Science Fiction magazines now found on the newsstands.\n     Why not keep it that way? It will be unique.\n\n     Mr. Wessolowski, your artist, is great. He is one who can\n     draw when it comes to a good scientific background.\n\n     I consider \"Tanks\" your best story as yet, with \"Spawn of\n     the Stars\" close second. \"Invisible Death,\" \"Creatures of\n     the Light\" and \"Mad Music\" were also good. Try to give us\n     some stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and A. Merritt. Did not\n     think much of \"The Beetle Horde\"--too many like it--Ted\n     Shatkowski, 812 Hoffman St., Hammond, Ind.\n\n\n_Some Good Suggestions_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I received the pleasure of purchasing a copy of Astounding\n     Stories the other day, the first copy I have seen. I have\n     not yet read it, but I am unable to wait that long to inform\n     you of my great joy in greeting a new magazine of this type.\n\n     I am a reader of other magazines similar to A. S., Stories\n     of Harl Vincent, Capt. S. P. Meek, Murray Leinster, and\n     others appear in these magazines, also, so I am familiar\n     with your authors.\n\n     But you have asked me what sort of stories I'd like to see\n     in A. S., so here goes. First of all, I would earnestly beg\n     you not to print such stories as those that deal with\n     ghosts, etc., because in my opinion there are far too many\n     good stories available to cast them aside for trash.\n\n     The type of story I prefer is the kind that is fanciful, odd\n     and interesting. Some tales deal with a new invention of\n     some sort, but contain no action or plot. However, I fail to\n     see any like that in the present A. S., unless it's \"Mad\n     Music.\"\n\n     A few utterly impossible stories are so interestingly told\n     that it is worth while to publish them. Some examples are\n     stories by A. Merritt (whose stories are the most\n     fascinating I have ever read). H. P. Lovecraft (master of\n     the bizarre and the grotesque) and G. A. England.\n\n     My letter seems to be mostly composed of suggestions, but\n     that is only because I am interested in anything pertaining\n     to stories of imagination, or Science Fiction, as it is\n     called. However, Astounding Stories seems to be very\n     satisfying to me. I am glad that you have Wessolowski on\n     your artist's staff. I hope that you will have a story\n     contest some time in the future, as they are very\n     interesting, and often uncover hitherto unknown talent in\n     the contestants.\n\n     I sincerely wish you the utmost of success in Astounding\n     Stories and hope that it will live a long, enduring life.\n\n     I hope, as time goes on, you will favor us with more\n     illustrations, for this type of story needs a large amount\n     of drawings so that the readers won't overwork their\n     imaginations.\n\n     Astounding Stories seems to be very shy, for I heard of it\n     from a friend and got the February, 1930 issue only after an\n     exhaustive search. The place where I got it appears to be\n     about the only one in town selling it. I hope more stores\n     will handle your great magazine. (I didn't intend the words\n     \"great magazine\" to be sarcastic. I really think it's\n     great!)\n\n     I hope you will have a department in which the readers may\n     discuss the merits or lacks of stories published. Or at\n     least print excerpts now and then.\n\n     Enclosed find twenty cents in stamps for which please send\n     me the first issue.--A. W. Bernal, 1374 E. 32 Street,\n     Oakland, Calif.\n\n\n\"_Stories I Like Best_--\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The stories I like best in your Astounding Stories of\n     Super-science were \"The Beetle Horde\" by Victor Rousseau,\n     \"The Cave of Horror,\" by Capt. S. P. Meek, \"Compensation,\"\n     by C. V. Tench, \"Invisible Death,\" by Anthony Pelcher. I\n     have just bought your second copy of Astounding Stories. I\n     like the book very much, and expect to buy it every\n     month--Issac Dworkowits, 1262 Valentine Avenue, Bronx, N. Y.\n\n\n\"_Just What Is Needed_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read the first two copies of your new magazine and I\n     would like to make a few comments and criticisms. This\n     magazine is very popular in my community and is just what is\n     needed to instill scientific interest in the mind of the\n     general public. Science Fiction will arouse more interest\n     and will be read by more people than any amount of dry\n     science and cold facts. Since you would like to have a\n     reader's opinion, I will say that \"The Beetle Horde\" is the\n     best story that I have read in a long time and was based on\n     the most excellent science; \"The Thief of Time\" was good;\n     try to get some more stories by Capt. S. P. Meek; one in\n     every copy would not be too many. I could not get all \"het\n     up\" over \"Spawn of the Stars,\" it was a little vague; I do\n     not think the author had a very distinct idea about the\n     nature of the invaders.\n\n     The stories do not have to stick to cold science, but should\n     not violate an established fact without a reasonable\n     explanation, as this might cause a mistaken idea in the\n     minds of the readers. A few good authors are: Dr. Keller, A\n     Hyatt Verrill, Walter Kately and R. H. Romans.--Wayne Bray,\n     Campbell, Missouri.\n\n\n\"_Literature That Typifies New Age_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     As a member of an organization whose existence was founded\n     through the medium of Science Fiction, I have watched your\n     magazine closely, and here are the results:\n\n     It is all Science Fiction, virile, interesting and new.\n\n     A popular edition of these stories with the name of a great\n     publishing house behind it.\n\n     The authors you have acquired are supreme in this field. Ray\n     Cummings and Captain Meek need no introduction. And Harl\n     Vincent is a notable addition whose stories of \"Indefinite\n     Extension\" and interplanetary travel are well known to\n     Science Fiction fans.\n\n     Science Fiction, first introduced by Verne, Poe, Wells,\n     Haggard and other old masters in this line, is a type of\n     literature that typifies the new age to come--the age of\n     science. And, in conclusion, may I say that the Science\n     Correspondence Club extends to your new and most acceptable\n     publication heartiest wishes for continued and increasing\n     success. I subscribe myself to the advancement of science\n     and Science Fiction.--Walter P. Dennis, F. P. S., 4653\n     Addison Street, Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n\"_Keep Up the Good Work_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just completed the perusal of the first issue of\n     Astounding Stories and am immensely pleased. I am a high\n     school senior, and though have only a rudimentary knowledge\n     of science, the subject impresses me and I am eager to gain\n     new facts and food for thought.\n\n     I compliment you on securing the services of such writers of\n     scientifiction as Ray Cummings, Harl Vincent, and R. F.\n     Starzl. They are good! Ray Cummings' impressive style, his\n     vivid imagination, and his knowledge of his subject seem to\n     me invincible. His stories are always welcome.\n\n     Now, concerning the services of other writers of Science\n     Fiction, I think the majority of the readers would be well\n     pleased with the following list: Edgar Rice Burroughs, A.\n     Hyatt Verrill, H.G. Wells, David H. Keller, Otis Adelbert\n     Kline and Stanton Coblentz. The above mentioned, I am sure,\n     would greatly please your readers. I believe it would\n     greatly improve the circulation of your magazine to try to\n     secure the services of such writers (especially E. R.\n     Burroughs).\n\n     I am greatly interested in the future of your magazine and\n     wish it every bit of luck in the world. You have made an\n     astounding start. Keep up the good work.--A. G. Jaweett,\n     Jr., 132 Murdock Avenue, Asheville, N.C.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
