Sometimes, in fact, you can't\n             even be sure you're having or not having one!\n\n\nTo be given paid-up leisure and find yourself unable to create is\nunpleasant for any artist. To be stranded in a cluster of desert\ncabins with a dozen lonely people in the same predicament only makes\nit worse. So Tom Dorset was understandably irked with himself and the\nTosker-Brown Vacation Fellowships as he climbed with the sun into the\nvalley of red stones. He accepted the chafing of his camera strap\nagainst his shoulder as the nagging of conscience. He agreed with the\ndisparaging hisses of the grains of sand rutched by his sneakers, and\nhe wished that the occasional breezes, which faintly echoed the same\ncriticisms, could blow him into a friendlier, less jealous age.\n\nHe had no way of knowing that just as there are winds that blow through\nspace, so there are winds that blow through time. Such winds may be\nstrong or weak. The strong ones are rare and seldom blow for short\ndistances, or more of us would know about them. What they pick up is\nalmost always whirled far into the future or past.\n\nThis has happened to people. There was Ambrose Bierce, who walked\nout of America and existence, and there are thousands of others who\nhave disappeared without a trace, though many of these may not have\nbeen caught up by time tornadoes and I do not know if a time gale blew\nacross the deck of the _Marie Celeste_.\n\nSometimes a time wind is playful, snatching up an object, sporting\nwith it for a season and then returning it unharmed to its original\nplace. Sometimes we may be blown about by whimsical time winds without\nrealizing it. Memory, for example, is a tiny time breeze, so weak that\nit can ripple only the mind.\n\nA very few time winds are like the monsoon, blowing at fixed intervals,\nfirst in one direction, then the other. Such a time wind blows near a\nbalancing rock in a valley of red stones in the American Southwest.\nEvery morning at ten o'clock, it blows a hundred years into the future;\nevery afternoon at two, it blows a hundred years into the past.\n\nQuite a number of people have unwittingly seen time winds in operation.\nThere are misty spots on the sea's horizon and wavery patches over\ndesert sands. There are mirages and will o' the wisps and ice blinks.\nAnd there are dust devils, such as Tom Dorset walked into near the\nbalancing rock.\n\nIt seemed to him no more than a spiteful upgust of sand, against which\nhe closed his eyes until the warm granules stopped peppering the lids.\nHe opened them to see the balancing rock had silently fallen and lay a\nquarter buried--no, that couldn't be, he told himself instantly. He had\nbeen preoccupied; he must have passed the balancing rock and held its\nimage in his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDespite this rationalization he was quite shaken. The strap of his\ncamera slipped slowly down his arm without his feeling it. And\njust then there stepped around the giant bobbin of the rock an\nextraordinarily pretty girl with hair the same pinkish copper color.\n\nShe was barefoot and wearing a pale blue playsuit rather like a Grecian\ntunic. But most important, as she stood there toeing his rough shadow\nin the sand, there was a complete naturalness about her, an absence of\nsharp edges, as if her personality had weathered without aging, just\nas the valley seemed to have taken another step toward eternity in the\nspace of an instant.\n\nShe must have assumed something of the same gentleness in him, for\nher faint surprise faded and she asked him, as easily as if he were a\nfriend of five years' standing, \"Tell now, do you think a woman can\nlove just one man? All her life? And a man just one woman?\"\n\nTom Dorset made a dazed sound.\n\nHis mind searched wildly.\n\n\"I do,\" she said, looking at him as calmly as at a mountain. \"I think\na man and woman can be each other's world, like Tristan and Isolde or\nFrederic and Catherine. Those old authors were wise. I don't see why on\nearth a girl has to spread her love around, no matter how enriching the\nexperiences may be.\"\n\n\"You know, I agree with you,\" Tom said, thinking he'd caught her\nidea--it was impossible not to catch her casualness. \"I think there's\nsomething cheap about the way everybody's supposed to run after sex\nthese days.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that exactly. Tenderness is beautiful, but--\" She pouted.\n\"A big family can be vastly crushing. I wanted to declare today a\nholiday, but they outvoted me. Jock said it didn't chime with our mood\ncycles. But I was angry with them, so I put on my clothes--\"\n\n\"Put on--?\"\n\n\"To make it a holiday,\" she explained bafflingly. \"And I walked here\nfor a tantrum.\" She stepped out of Tom's shadow and hopped back. \"Ow,\nthe sand's getting hot,\" she said, rubbing the grains from the pale and\nuncramped toes.\n\n\"You go barefoot a lot?\" Tom guessed.\n\n\"No, mostly digitals,\" she replied and took something shimmering from\na pocket at her hip and drew it on her foot. It was a high-ankled,\ntransparent moccasin with five separate toes. She zipped it shut with\nthe speed of a card trick, then similarly gloved the other foot. Again\nthe metal-edged slit down the front seemed to close itself.\n\n\"I'm behind on the fashions,\" Tom said, curious. They were walking side\nby side now, the way she'd come and he'd been going. \"How does that\nzipper work?\"\n\n\"Magnetic. They're on all my clothes. Very simple.\" She parted her\ntunic to the waist, then let it zip together.\n\n\"Clever,\" Tom remarked with a gulp. There seemed no limits to this\ngirl's naturalness.\n\n\"I see you're a button man,\" she said. \"You actually believe it's\npossible for a man and woman to love just each other?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis chuckle was bitter. He was thinking of Elinore Murphy at\nTosker-Brown and a bit about cold-faced Miss Tosker herself. \"I\nsometimes wonder if it's possible for anyone to love anyone.\"\n\n\"You haven't met the right girls,\" she said.\n\n\"Girl,\" he corrected.\n\nShe grinned at him. \"You'll make me think you really are a monogamist.\nWhat group do you come from?\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about that,\" he requested. He was willing to forego\nknowing how she'd guessed he was from an art group, if he could be\nspared talking about the Vacation Fellowships and those nervous little\ncabins.\n\n\"My group's very nice on the whole,\" the girl said, \"but at times they\ncan be nefandously exasperating. Jock's the worst, quietly guiding the\nrest of us like an analyst. How I loathe that man! But Larry's almost\nas bad, with his shame-faced bumptiousness, as if we'd all sneaked off\non a joyride to Venus. And there's Jokichi at the opposite extreme,\nforever scared he won't distribute his affection equally, dividing it\nup into mean little packets like candy for jealous children who would\nscream if they got one chewy less. And then there's Sasha and Ernest--\"\n\n\"Who are you talking about?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"My husbands.\" She shook her head dolefully. \"To find five more\ndifficult men would be positively Martian.\"\n\nTom's mind backtracked frantically, searching all conversations at\nTosker-Brown for gossip about cultists in the neighborhood. It found\nnothing and embarked on a wider search. There were the Mormons (was\nthat the word that had sounded like Martian?) but it wasn't the Mormon\nhusbands who were plural. And then there was Oneida (weren't husbands\nand wives both plural there?) but that was 19th century New England.\n\n\"Five husbands?\" he repeated. She nodded. He went on, \"Do you mean to\nsay five men have got you alone somewhere up here?\"\n\n\"To be sure not,\" she replied. \"There are my kwives.\"\n\n\"Kwives?\"\n\n\"Co-wives,\" she said more slowly. \"They can be fascinerously\nexasperating, too.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom's mind did some more searching. \"And yet you believe in monogamy?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Only when I'm having tantrums. It was civilized of you to\nagree with me.\"\n\n\"But I actually do believe in monogamy,\" he protested.\n\nShe gave his hand a little squeeze. \"You are nice, but let's rush now.\nI've finished my tantrum and I want you to meet my group. You can fresh\nyourself with us.\"\n\nAs they hurried across the heated sands, Tom Dorset felt for the first\ntime a twinge of uneasiness. There was something about this girl, more\nthan her strange clothes and the odd words she used now and then,\nsomething almost--though ghosts don't wear digitals--spectral.\n\nThey scrambled up a little rise, digging their footgear into the sand,\nuntil they stood on a long flat. And there, serpentining around two\ngreat clumps of rock, was a many-windowed adobe ranch house with a\nroof like fresh soot.\n\n\"Oh, they've put on their clothes,\" his companion exclaimed with\npleasure. \"They've decided to make it a holiday after all.\"\n\nTom spotted a beard in the group swarming out to meet them. Its cultish\nlook gave him a momentary feeling of superiority, followed by an\nequally momentary apprehension--the five husbands were certainly husky.\nThen both feelings were swallowed up in the swirl of introduction.\n\nHe told his own name, found that his companion's was Lois Wolver, then\nsmiling faces began to bob toward his, his hands were shaken, his\ncheeks were kissed, he was even spun around like blind man's bluff, so\nthat he lost track of the husbands and failed to attach Mary, Rachel,\nSimone and Joyce to the right owners.\n\nHe did notice that Jokichi was an Oriental with a skin as tight as\nenameled china, and that Rachel was a tall slim Negro girl. Also\nsomeone said, \"Joyce isn't a Wolver, she's just visiting.\"\n\nHe got a much clearer impression of the clothes than the names. They\nwere colorful, costly-looking, and mostly Egyptian and Cretan in\ninspiration. Some of them would have been quite immodest, even compared\nto Miss Tosker's famous playsuits, except that the wearers didn't seem\nto feel so.\n\n\"There goes the middle-morning rocket!\" one of them eagerly cried.\n\nTom looked up with the rest, but his eyes caught the dazzling sun.\nHowever, he heard a faint roaring that quickly sank in volume and\npitch, and it reminded him that the Army had a rocket testing range in\nthis area. He had little interest in science, but he hadn't known they\nwere on a daily schedule.\n\n\"Do you suppose it's off the track?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Not a chance,\" someone told him--the beard, he thought. The assurance\nof the tones gave him a possible solution. Scientists came from all\nover the world these days and might have all sorts of advanced ideas.\nThis could be a group working at a nearby atomic project and leading\nits peculiar private life on the side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they eddied toward the house he heard Lois remind someone, \"But you\nfinally did declare it a holiday,\" and a husband who looked like a gay\npharaoh respond, \"I had another see at the mood charts and I found a\nsubtle surge I'd missed.\"\n\nMeanwhile the beard (a black one) had taken Tom in charge. Tom wasn't\nsure of his name, but he had a tan skin, a green sarong, and a fiercely\njovial expression. \"The swimming pool's around there, the landing\nspot's on the other side,\" he began, then noticed Tom gazing at the\nsooty roof. \"Sun power cells,\" he explained proudly. \"They store all\nthe current we need.\"\n\nTom felt his idea confirmed. \"Wonder you don't use atomic power,\" he\nobserved lightly.\n\nThe beard nodded. \"We've been asked that. Matter of esthetics. Why\nwaste sunlight or use hard radiations needlessly? Of course, you might\nfeel differently. What's your group, did you say?\"\n\n\"Tosker-Brown,\" Tom told him, adding when the beard frowned, \"the\nFellowship people, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" the beard confessed. \"Where are you located?\"\n\nTom briefly described the ranch house and cabins at the other end of\nthe valley.\n\n\"Comic, I can't place it.\" The beard shrugged. \"Here come the children.\"\n\nA dozen naked youngsters raced around the ranch house, followed by a\nwoman in a vaguely African dress open down the sides.\n\n\"Yours?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"Ours,\" the beard answered.\n\n\"C'est un homme!\"\n\n\"Regardez des v\u00eatements!\"\n\n\"No need to practice, kids; this is a holiday,\" the beard told them.\n\"Tom, Helen,\" he said, introducing the woman with the air-conditioned\ngarment. \"Her turn today to companion die Kinder.\"\n\nOne of the latter rapped on the beard's knee. \"May we show the stranger\nour things?\" Instantly the others joined in pleading. The beard shot\nan inquiring glance at Tom, who nodded. A moment later the small troupe\nwas hurrying him toward a spacious lean-to at the end of the ranch\nhouse. It was chuckful of strange toys, rocks and plants, small animals\nin cages and out, and the oddest model airplanes, or submarines. But\nTom was given no time to look at any one thing for long.\n\n\"See my crystals? I grew them.\"\n\n\"Smell my mutated gardenias. Tell now, isn't there a difference?\" There\ndidn't seem to be, but he nodded.\n\n\"Look at my squabbits.\" This referred to some long-eared white\nsquirrels nibbling carrots and nuts.\n\n\"Here's my newest model spaceship, a DS-57-B. Notice the detail.\" The\noldest boy shoved one of the submarine affairs in his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTom felt like a figure that is being tugged about in a rococo painting\nby wide pink ribbons in the chubby hands of naked cherubs. Except\nthat these cherubs were slim and tanned, fantastically energetic, and\napparently of depressingly high IQ. (What these scientists did to\nchildren!) He missed Lois and was grateful for the single little girl\nsolemnly skipping rope in a corner and paying no attention to him.\n\nThe odd lingo she repeated stuck in his mind: \"Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o,\nGis-so. Gik-lo, I-o....\"\n\nSuddenly the air was filled with soft chimes. \"Lunch,\" the children\nshouted and ran away.\n\nTom followed at a soberer pace along the wall of the ranch house. He\nglanced in the huge windows, curious about the living and sleeping\narrangements of the Wolvers, but the panes were strangely darkened.\nThen he entered the wide doorway through which the children had\nscampered and his curiosity turned to wonder.\n\nA resilient green floor that wasn't flat, but sloped up toward the\nwhite of the far wall like a breaking wave. Chairs like giants' hands\ntenderly cupped. Little tables growing like mushrooms and broad-leafed\nplants out of the green floor. A vast picture window showing the red\nrocks.\n\nYet it was the wood-paneled walls that electrified his artistic\ninterest. They blossomed with fruits and flowers, deep and poignantly\ncarved in several styles. He had never seen such work.\n\nHe became aware of a silence and realized that his hosts and hostesses\nwere smiling at him from around a long table. Moved by a sudden\nhumility, he knelt and unlaced his sneakers and added them to the pile\nof sandals and digitals by the door. As he rose, a soft and comic\npiping started and he realized that beyond the table the children were\nlined up, solemnly puffing at little wooden flutes and recorders. He\nsaw the empty chair at the table and went toward it, conscious for the\nmoment of nothing but his dusty feet.\n\nHe was disappointed that Lois wasn't sitting next to him, but the food\nreminded him that he was hungry. There was a charming little steak,\nstriped black and brown with perfection, and all sorts of vegetables\nand fruits, one or two of which he didn't recognize.\n\n\"Flown from Africa,\" someone explained to him.\n\nThese sly scientists, he thought, living behind their security curtain\nin the most improbable world!\n\nWhen they were sitting with coffee and wine, and the children had\nfinished their concert and were busy at another table, he asked, \"How\ndo you manage all this?\"\n\nJock, the gay pharaoh, shrugged. \"It's not difficult.\"\n\nRachel, the slim Negro, chuckled in her throat. \"We're just people,\nTom.\"\n\nHe tried to phrase his question without mentioning money. \"What do you\nall do?\"\n\n\"Jock's a uranium miner,\" Larry (the beard) answered, briskly taking\nover. \"Rachel's an algae farmer. I'm a rocket pilot. Lois--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlthough pleased at this final confirmation of his guess, Tom couldn't\nhelp feeling a surge of uneasiness. \"Sure you should be telling me\nthese things?\"\n\nLarry laughed. \"Why not? Lois and Jokichi have been exchange-workers in\nChina the last six months.\"\n\n\"Mostly digging ditches,\" Jokichi put in with a smile.\n\n\"--and Sasha's in an assembly plant. Helen's a psychiatrist. Oh, we\njust do ordinary things. Now we're on grand vacation.\"\n\n\"Grand vacation?\"\n\n\"When all of us have a vacation together,\" Larry explained. \"What do\nyou do?\"\n\n\"I'm an artist,\" Tom said, taking out a cigaret.\n\n\"But what else?\" Larry asked.\n\nTom felt an angry embarrassment. \"Just an artist,\" he mumbled, cigaret\nin mouth, digging in his pockets for a match.\n\n\"Hold on,\" said Joyce beside him and pointed a silver pencil at the tip\nof the cigaret. He felt a faint thrill in his lips and then started\nback, coughing. The cigaret was lighted.\n\n\"Please mutate my poppy seeds, Mommy.\" A little girl had darted to\nJoyce from the children's table.\n\n\"You're a very dirty little girl,\" Joyce told her without reproof.\n\"Hold them out.\" She briefly directed the silver pencil at the clay\npellets on the grimy little palm. The little girl shivered delightedly.\n\"I love ultrasonics, they feel so funny.\" She scampered off.\n\nTom cleared his throat. \"I must say I'm tremendously impressed with the\nwood carvings. I'd like to photograph them. Oh, Lord!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Rachel asked.\n\n\"I lost my camera somewhere.\"\n\n\"Camera?\" Jokichi showed interest. \"You mean one for stills?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"A Leica,\" Tom told him.\n\nJokichi seemed impressed. \"That is interesting. I've never seen one of\nthose old ones.\"\n\n\"Tom's a button man,\" Lois remarked by way of explanation, apparently.\n\"Was the camera in a brown case? You dropped it where we met. We can\nget it later.\"\n\n\"Good, I'd really like to take those pictures,\" Tom said.\n\"Incidentally, who did the carvings?\"\n\n\"We did,\" Jock said. \"Together.\"\n\nTom was grateful that the scamper of the children out of the room saved\nhim from having to reply. He couldn't think of anything but a grunt of\nastonishment.\n\nThe conversation split into a group of chats about something called a\npsych machine, trips to Russia, the planet Mars, and several artists\nTom had never heard of. He wanted to talk to Lois, but she was one of\nthe group gabbling about Mars like children. He felt suddenly uneasy\nand out of things, and neither Rachel's deprecating remarks about her\nsection of the wood carvings nor Joyce's interesting smiles helped\nmuch. He was glad when they all began to get up. He wandered outside\nand made his way to the children's lean-to, feeling very depressed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce again he was the center of a friendly naked cluster, except for\nthe same solemn-faced little girl skipping rope. A rather malicious but\nnot very hopeful whim prompted him to ask the youngest, \"What's one and\none?\"\n\n\"Ten,\" the shaver answered glibly. Tom felt pleased.\n\n\"It could also be two,\" the oldest boy remarked.\n\n\"I'll say,\" Tom agreed. \"What's the population of the world?\"\n\n\"About seven hundred million.\"\n\nTom nodded noncommittally and, grabbing at the first long word that he\nthought of, turned to the eldest girl. \"What's poliomyelitis?\"\n\n\"Never heard of it,\" she said.\n\nThe solemn little girl kept droning the same ridiculous chant: \"Gik-lo,\nI-o, Rik-o, Gis-so.\"\n\nHis ego eased, Tom went outside and there was Lois.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\nShe took his hand. \"Have we pushed ourselves at you too much? Has our\njabbering bothered you? We're a loud-mouthed family and I didn't think\nto ask if you were loning.\"\n\n\"Loning?\"\n\n\"Solituding.\"\n\n\"In a way,\" he said. They didn't speak for a moment. Then, \"Are you\nhappy, Lois, in your life here?\" he asked.\n\nHer smile was instant. \"Of course. Don't you like my group?\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"They make me feel rather no good,\" he said, and then\nadmitted, \"but in a way I'm more attracted to them than any people I've\never met.\"\n\n\"You are?\" Her grip on his hand tightened. \"Then why don't you stay\nwith us for a while? I like you. It's too early to propose anything,\nbut I think you have a quality our group lacks. You could see how you\nfit in. And there's Joyce. She's just visiting, too. You wouldn't have\nto lone unless you wanted.\"\n\nBefore he could think, there was a rhythmic rush of feet and the\nWolvers were around them.\n\n\"We're swimming,\" Simone announced.\n\nLois looked at Tom inquiringly. He smiled his willingness, started to\nmention he didn't have trunks, then realized that wouldn't be news\nhere. He wondered whether he would blush.\n\nJock fell in beside him as they rounded the ranch house. \"Larry's been\ntelling me about your group at the other end of the valley. It's comic,\nbut I've whirled down the valley a dozen times and never spotted any\nsort of place there. What's it like?\"\n\n\"A ranch house and several cabins.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJock frowned. \"Comic I never saw it.\" His face cleared. \"How about\nwhirling over there? You could point it out to me.\"\n\n\"It's really there,\" Tom said uneasily. \"I'm not making it up.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Jock assured him. \"It was just an idea.\"\n\n\"We could pick up your camera on the way,\" Lois put in.\n\nThe rest of the group had turned back from the huge oval pool and the\ndark blue and flashing thing beyond it, and stood gay-colored against\nthe pool's pale blue shimmer.\n\n\"How about it?\" Jock asked them. \"A whirl before we bathe?\"\n\nTwo or three said yes besides Lois, and Jock led the way toward the\nhelicopter that Tom now saw standing beyond the pool, its beetle body\nas blue as a scarab, its vanes flashing silver.\n\nThe others piled in. Tom followed as casually as he could, trying to\nsuppress the pounding of his heart. \"Wonder you don't go by rocket,\" he\nremarked lightly.\n\nJock laughed. \"For such a short trip?\"\n\nThe vanes began to thrum. Tom sat stiffly, gripping the sides of\nthe seat, then realized that the others had sunk back lazily in the\ncushions. There was a moment of strain and they were falling ahead and\nup. Looking out the side, Tom saw for a moment the sooty roof of the\nranch house and the blue of the pool and the pinkish umber of tanned\nbodies. Then the helicopter lurched gently around. Without warning a\nmiserable uneasiness gripped him, a desire to cling mixed with an urge\nto escape. He tried to convince himself it was fear of the height.\n\nHe heard Lois tell Jock, \"That's the place, down by that rock that\nlooks like a wrecked spaceship.\"\n\nThe helicopter began to fall forward. Tom felt Lois' hand on his.\n\n\"You haven't answered my question,\" she said.\n\n\"What?\" he asked dully.\n\n\"Whether you'll stay with us. At least for a while.\"\n\nHe looked at her. Her smile was a comfort. He said, \"If I possibly can.\"\n\n\"What could possibly stop you?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered abstractedly.\n\n\"You're strange,\" Lois told him. \"There's a weight of sadness in you.\nAs if you lived in a less happy age. As if it weren't 2050.\"\n\n\"Twenty?\" he repeated, awakening from his thoughts with a jerk. \"What's\nthe time?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Two,\" Jock said. The word sounded like a knell.\n\n\"You need cheering,\" Lois announced firmly.\n\nAmid a whoosh of air rebounding from earth, they jounced gently down.\nLois vaulted out. \"Come on,\" she said.\n\nTom followed her. \"Where?\" he asked stupidly, looking around at the red\nrocks through the settling sand cloud stirred by the vanes.\n\n\"Your camera,\" she told him, laughing. \"Over there. Come on, I'll race\nyou.\"\n\nHe started to run with her and then his uneasiness got beyond his\ncontrol. He ran faster and faster. He saw Lois catch her foot on a\nrock and go down sprawling, but he couldn't stop. He ran desperately\naround the rock and into a gust of up-whirling sand that terrified him\nwith its suddenness. He tried to escape from the stinging, blinding\ngust, but there was the nightmarish fright that his wild strides were\ncarrying him nowhere.\n\nThen the sand settled. He stopped running and looked around him. He was\nstanding by the balancing rock. He was gasping. At his feet the rusty\nbrown leather of the camera case peeped from the sand. Lois was nowhere\nin sight. Neither was the helicopter. The valley seemed different,\nrawer--one might almost have said younger.\n\nHours after dark he trailed into Tosker-Brown. Curtained lights still\nglowed from a few cabins. He was footsore, bewildered, frightened. All\nafternoon and through the twilight and into the moonlit evening that\nturned the red rocks black, he had searched the valley. Nowhere had he\nbeen able to find the soot-roofed ranch house of the Wolvers. He hadn't\neven been able to locate the rock like a giant bobbin where he'd met\nLois.\n\nDuring the next days he often returned to the valley. But he never\nfound anything. And he never happened to be near the balancing rock\nwhen the time winds blew at ten and two, though once or twice he did\nsee dust devils. Then he went away and eventually forgot.\n\nIn his casual reading he ran across popular science articles describing\nthe binary system of numbers used in electronic calculating machines,\nwhere one and one make ten. He always skipped them. And more than once\nhe saw the four equations expressing Einstein's generalized theory of\ngravitation:\n\n[Illustration: Einstein's equation.]\n\nHe never connected them with the little girl's chant: \"Gik-lo, I-o,\nRik-o, Gis-so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Nice Girl With 5 Husbands, by Fritz Leiber\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NICE GIRL WITH 5 HUSBANDS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51101-8.txt or 51101-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/1/0/51101/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
