Joe Kenmore looked out the plane window past the\nco-pilot's shoulder. He stared ahead to where the sky and cloud bank\njoined--it was many miles away--and tried to picture the job before him.\nBack in the cargo space of the plane there were four big crates. They\ncontained the pilot gyros for the most important object then being built\non Earth, and it wouldn't work properly without them. It was Joe's job\nto take that highly specialized, magnificently precise machinery to its\ndestination, help to install it, and see to its checking after it was\ninstalled.\n\nHe felt uneasy. Of course the pilot and co-pilot--the only two other\npeople on the transport plane--knew their stuff. Every imaginable\nprecaution would be taken to make sure that a critically essential\ndevice like the pilot gyro assembly would get safely where it belonged.\nIt would be--it was being--treated as if it were a crate of eggs instead\nof massive metal, smoothed and polished and lapped to a precision\npractically unheard of. But just the same Joe was worried. He'd seen the\npilot gyro assembly made. He'd helped on it. He knew how many times a\nthousandth of an inch had been split in machining its bearings, and the\nbreath-weight balance of its moving parts. He'd have liked to be back in\nthe cargo compartment with it, but only the pilot's cabin was\npressurized, and the ship was at eighteen thousand feet, flying west by\nsouth.\n\nHe tried to get his mind off that impulse by remembering that at\neighteen thousand feet a good half of the air on Earth was underneath\nhim, and by hoping that the other half would be as easy to rise above\nwhen the gyros were finally in place and starting out for space. The\ngyros, of course, were now on their way to be installed in the\nartificial satellite to be blasted up and set in an orbit around the\nEarth as the initial stage of that figurative stepladder by which men\nwould make their first attempt to reach the stars. Until that Space\nPlatform left the ground, the gyros were Joe's responsibility.\n\nThe plane's co-pilot leaned back in his chair and stretched luxuriously.\nHe loosened his safety belt and got up. He stepped carefully past the\ncolumn between the right- and left-hand pilot seats. That column\ncontained a fraction of the innumerable dials and controls the pilots of\na modern multi-engine plane have to watch and handle. The co-pilot went\nto the coffeepot and flipped a switch. Joe fidgeted again on his\nimprovised seat. Again he wished that he could be riding in back with\nthe crates. But it would be silly to insist on perching somewhere in the\nfreight compartment.\n\nThere was a steady roaring in the cabin--the motors. One's ears got\naccustomed to it, and by now the noise sounded as if it were heard\nthrough cushions. Presently the coffeepot bubbled, unheard. The co-pilot\nlighted a cigarette. Then he drew a paper cup of coffee and handed it to\nthe pilot. The pilot seemed negligently to contemplate some dozens of\ndials, all of which were duly duplicated on the right-hand, co-pilot's\nside. The co-pilot glanced at Joe.\n\n\"Coffee?\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Joe. He took the paper cup.\n\nThe co-pilot said: \"Everything okay with you?\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" said Joe. He realized that the co-pilot felt talkative.\nHe explained: \"Those crates I'm traveling with----. The family firm's\nbeen working on that machinery for months. It was finished with the\nfinal grinding done practically with feather dusters. I can't help\nworrying about it. There was four months' work in just lapping the\nshafts and balancing rotors. We made a telescope mounting once, for an\nobservatory in South Africa, but compared to this gadget we worked on\nthat one blindfolded!\"\n\n\"Pilot gyros, eh?\" said the co-pilot. \"That's what the waybill said. But\nif they were all right when they left the plant, they'll be all right\nwhen they are delivered.\"\n\nJoe said ruefully: \"Still I'd feel better riding back there with them.\"\n\n\"Sabotage bad at the plant?\" asked the co-pilot. \"Tough!\"\n\n\"Sabotage? No. Why should there be sabotage?\" demanded Joe.\n\nThe co-pilot said mildly: \"Not quite everybody is anxious to see the\nSpace Platform take off. Not everybody! What on earth do you think is\nthe biggest problem out where they're building it?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" admitted Joe. \"Keeping the weight down? But there is\na new rocket fuel that's supposed to be all right for sending the\nPlatform up. Wasn't that the worst problem? Getting a rocket fuel with\nenough power per pound?\"\n\nThe co-pilot sipped his coffee and made a face. It was too hot.\n\n\"Fella,\" he said drily, \"that stuff was easy! The slide-rule boys did\nthat. The big job in making a new moon for the Earth is keeping it from\nbeing blown up before it can get out to space! There are a few gentlemen\nwho thrive on power politics. They know that once the Platform's\nfloating serenely around the Earth, with a nice stock of atom-headed\nguided missiles on board, power politics is finished. So they're doing\nwhat they can to keep the world as it's always been--equipped with just\none moon and many armies. And they're doing plenty, if you ask me!\"\n\n\"I've heard----\" began Joe.\n\n\"You haven't heard the half of it,\" said the co-pilot. \"The Air\nTransport has lost nearly as many planes and more men on this particular\nairlift than it did in Korea while that was the big job. I don't know\nhow many other men have been killed. But there's a strictly local hot\nwar going on out where we're headed. No holds barred! Hadn't you heard?\"\n\nIt sounded exaggerated. Joe said politely: \"I heard there was\ncloak-and-dagger stuff going on.\"\n\nThe pilot drained his cup and handed it to the co-pilot. He said: \"He\nthinks you're kidding him.\" He turned back to the contemplation of the\ninstruments before him and the view out the transparent plastic of the\ncabin windows.\n\n\"He does?\" The co-pilot said to Joe, \"You've got security checks around\nyour plant. They weren't put there for fun. It's a hundred times worse\nwhere the whole Platform's being built.\"\n\n\"Security?\" said Joe. He shrugged. \"We know everybody who works at the\nplant. We've known them all their lives. They'd get mad if we started to\nget stuffy. We don't bother.\"\n\n\"That I'd like to see,\" said the co-pilot skeptically. \"No barbed wire\naround the plant? No identity badges you wear when you go in? No\nsecurity officer screaming blue murder every five minutes? What do you\nthink all that's for? You built these pilot gyros! You had to have that\nsecurity stuff!\"\n\n\"But we didn't,\" insisted Joe. \"Not any of it. The plant's been in the\nsame village for eighty years. It started building wagons and plows, and\nnow it turns out machine tools and precision machinery. It's the only\nfactory around, and everybody who works there went to school with\neverybody else, and so did our fathers, and we know one another!\"\n\nThe co-pilot was unconvinced. \"No kidding?\"\n\n\"No kidding,\" Joe assured him. \"In World War Two the only spy scare in\nthe village was an FBI man who came around looking for spies. The\nvillage cop locked him up and wouldn't believe in his credentials. They\nhad to send somebody from Washington to get him out of jail.\"\n\nThe co-pilot grinned reluctantly. \"I guess there are such places,\" he\nsaid enviously. \"You should've built the Platform! It's plenty different\non this job! We can't even talk to a girl without security clearance for\nan interview beforehand, and we can't speak to strange men or go out\nalone after dark--.\"\n\nThe pilot grunted. The co-pilot's tone changed. \"Not quite that bad,\" he\nadmitted, \"but it's bad! It's really bad! We lost three planes last\nweek. I guess you'd call it in action against saboteurs. One flew to\npieces in mid-air. Sabotage. Carrying critical stuff. One crashed on\ntake-off, carrying irreplaceable instruments. Somebody'd put a detonator\nin a servo-motor. And one froze in its landing glide and flew smack-dab\ninto its landing field. They had to scrape it up. When this ship got a\nmajor overhaul two weeks ago, we flew it with our fingers crossed for\nfour trips running. Seems to be all right, though. We gave it the works.\nBut I won't look forward to a serene old age until the Platform's out of\natmosphere! Not me!\"\n\nHe went to put the pilot's empty cup in the disposal slot.\n\nThe plane went on. There wasn't anything underneath but clouds, and\nthere wasn't anything overhead but sky. The clouds were a long way down,\nand the sky was simply up. Joe looked down and saw a faint spot of\nracing brightness with a hint of colors around it. It was the sort of\nnimbus that substitutes for a shadow when a plane is high enough above\nthe clouds. It raced madly over the irregular upper surface of the cloud\nlayer. The plane flew and flew. Nothing happened at all. This was two\nhours from the field from which it had taken off with the pilot gyro\ncases as its last item of collected cargo. Joe remembered how grimly the\ntwo crew members had prevented anybody from even approaching it on the\nground, except those who actually loaded the cases, and how one of the\ntwo had watched them every second.\n\nJoe fidgeted. He didn't quite know how to take the co-pilot's talk. The\nKenmore Precision Tool plant was owned by his family, but it wasn't so\nmuch a family as a civic enterprise. The young men of the village grew\nup to regard fanatically fine workmanship with the casual\nmatter-of-factness elsewhere reserved for plowing or deep-sea fishing.\nJoe's father owned it, and some day Joe might head it, but he couldn't\nhope to keep the respect of the men in the plant unless he could handle\nevery tool on the place and split a thousandth at least five ways. Ten\nwould be better! But as long as the feeling at the plant stayed as it\nwas now, there'd never be a security problem there.\n\nIf the co-pilot was telling the truth, though--.\n\nJoe found a slow burn beginning inside him. He had a picture in his mind\nthat was practically a dream. It was of something big and bright and\nungainly swimming silently in emptiness with a field of stars behind it.\nThe stars were tiny pin points of light. They were unwinking and\ndistinct because there was no air where this thing floated. The\nblackness between them was absolute because this was space itself. The\nthing that floated was a moon. A man-made moon. It was an artificial\nsatellite of Earth. Men were now building it. Presently it would float\nas Joe dreamed of it, and where the sun struck it, it would be\nunbearably bright, and where there were shadows, they would be abysmally\nblack--except, perhaps, when earthshine from the planet below would\noutline it in a ghostly fashion.\n\nThere would be men in the thing that floated in space. It swam in a\nsplendid orbit about the world that had built it. Sometimes there were\nsmall ships that--so Joe imagined--would fight their way up to it,\npanting great plumes of rocket smoke, and bringing food and fuel to its\ncrew. And presently one of those panting small ships would refill its\nfuel tanks to the bursting point from the fuel other ships had\nbrought--and yet the ship would have no weight. So it would drift away\nfrom the greater floating thing in space, and suddenly its rockets would\nspout flame and fumes, and it would head triumphantly out and away from\nEarth. And it would be the first vessel ever to strike out for the\nstars!\n\nThat was the picture Joe had of the Space Platform and its meaning.\nMaybe it was romantic, but men were working right now to make that\nromance come true. This transport plane was flying to a small town\nimprobably called Bootstrap, carrying one of the most essential devices\nfor the Platform's equipment. In the desert near Bootstrap there was a\ngigantic construction shed. Inside that shed men were building exactly\nthe monstrous object that Joe pictured to himself. They were trying to\nrealize a dream men have dreamed for decades--the necessary space\nplatform that would be the dock, the wharf, the starting point from\nwhich the first of human space explorers could start for infinity. The\nidea that anybody could want to halt such an undertaking made Joe\nKenmore burn.\n\nThe co-pilot painstakingly crushed out his cigarette. The ship flew with\nmore steadiness than a railroad car rolls on rails. There was the oddly\ncushioned sound of the motors. It was all very matter-of-fact.\n\nBut Joe said angrily: \"Look! Is any of what you said--well--kidding?\"\n\n\"I wish it were, fella,\" said the co-pilot. \"I can talk to you about it,\nbut most of it's hushed up. I tell you----\"\n\n\"Why can you talk to me?\" demanded Joe suspiciously. \"What makes it all\nright for you to talk to me?\"\n\n\"You've got passage on this ship. That means something!\"\n\n\"Does it?\" asked Joe.\n\nThe pilot turned in his seat to glance at Joe.\n\n\"Do you think we carry passengers regularly?\" he asked mildly.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nPilot and co-pilot looked at each other.\n\n\"Tell him,\" said the pilot.\n\n\"About five months ago,\" said the co-pilot, \"there was an Army colonel\nwangled a ride to Bootstrap on a cargo plane. The plane took off. It\nflew all right until twenty miles from Bootstrap. Then it stopped\nchecking. It dove straight for the Shed the Platform's being built in.\nIt was shot down. When it hit, there was an explosion.\" The co-pilot\nshrugged. \"You won't believe me, maybe. But a week later they found the\ncolonel's body back east. Somebody'd murdered him.\"\n\nJoe blinked.\n\n\"It wasn't the colonel who rode as a passenger,\" said the co-pilot. \"It\nwas somebody else. Twenty miles from Bootstrap he'd shot the pilots and\ntaken the controls. That's what they figure, anyhow. He meant to dive\ninto the construction Shed. Because--very, very cleverly--they'd managed\nto get a bomb in the plane disguised as cargo. They got the men who'd\ndone that, later, but it was rather late.\"\n\nJoe said dubiously: \"But would one bomb destroy the Shed and the\nPlatform?\"\n\n\"This one would,\" said the co-pilot. \"It was an atom bomb. But it wasn't\na good one. It didn't detonate properly. It was a fizz-off.\"\n\nJoe saw the implications. Cranks and crackpots couldn't get hold of the\nmaterials for atom bombs. It took the resources of a large nation for\nthat. But a nation that didn't quite dare start an open war might try to\nsneak in one atom bomb to destroy the space station. Once the Platform\nwas launched no other nation could dream of world domination. The United\nStates wouldn't go to war if the Platform was destroyed. But there could\nbe a strictly local hot war.\n\nThe pilot said sharply: \"Something down below!\"\n\nThe co-pilot fairly leaped into his right-hand seat, his safety belt\nbuckled in half a heartbeat.\n\n\"Check,\" he said in a new tone. \"Where?\"\n\nThe pilot pointed.\n\n\"I saw something dark,\" he said briefly, \"where there was a deep dent in\nthe cloud.\"\n\nThe co-pilot threw a switch. Within seconds a new sound entered the\ncabin. _Beep-beep-beep-beep._ They were thin squeaks, spaced a full\nhalf-second apart, that rose to inaudibility in pitch in the fraction of\na second they lasted. The co-pilot snatched a hand phone from the wall\nabove his head and held it to his lips.\n\n\"Flight two-twenty calling,\" he said crisply. \"Something's got a radar\non us. We saw it. Get a fix on us and come a-running. We're at eighteen\nthousand and\"--here the floor of the cabin tilted markedly--\"now we're\nclimbing. Get a fix on us and come a-running. Over!\"\n\nHe took the phone from his lips and said conversationally: \"Radar's a\ngiveaway. This is no fly-way. You wouldn't think he'd take that much of\na chance, would you?\"\n\nJoe clenched his hands. The pilot did things to the levers on the column\nbetween the two pilots' seats. He said curtly: \"Arm the jatos.\"\n\nThe co-pilot did something mysterious and said: \"Check.\"\n\nAll this took place in seconds. The pilot said, \"I see something!\" and\ninstantly there was swift, tense teamwork in action. A call by radio,\nasking for help. The plane headed up for greater clearance between it\nand the clouds. The jatos made ready for firing. They were the\njet-assisted take-off rockets which on a short or rough field would\ndouble the motors' thrust for a matter of seconds. In straightaway\nflight they should make the plane leap ahead like a scared rabbit. But\nthey wouldn't last long.\n\n\"I don't like this,\" said the co-pilot in a flat voice. \"I don't see\nwhat he could do----\"\n\nThen he stopped. Something zoomed out of a cloud. The action was\ncompletely improbable. The thing that appeared looked absolutely\ncommonplace. It was a silver-winged private plane, the sort that cruises\nat one hundred and seventy-five knots and can hit nearly two-fifty if\npushed. It was expensive, but not large. It came straight up out of the\ncloud layer and went lazily over on its back and dived down into the\ncloud layer again. It looked like somebody stunting for his own private\nlunatic pleasure--the kind of crazy thing some people do, and for which\nthere is no possible explanation.\n\nBut there was an explanation for this.\n\nAt the very top of the loop, threads of white smoke appeared. They\nshould have been unnoticeable against the cloud. But for the fraction of\nan instant they were silhouetted against the silver wings. And they were\nnot misty wisps of vapor. They were dense, sharply defined rocket\ntrails.\n\nThey shot upward, spreading out. They unreeled with incredible,\never-increasing velocity.\n\nThe pilot hit something with the heel of his hand. There was a\nheart-stopping delay. Then the transport leaped forward with a force to\nstop one's breath. The jatos were firing furiously, and the ship jumped.\nThere was a bellowing that drowned out the sound of the engines. Joe was\nslammed back on the rear wall of the cabin. He struggled against the\nforce that pushed him tailward. He heard the pilot saying calmly: \"That\nplane shot rockets at us. If they're guided we're sunk.\"\n\nThen the threads of smoke became the thickness of cables, of columns!\nThey should have ringed the transport plane in. But the jatos had jumped\nit crazily forward and were still thrusting fiercely to make it go\nfaster than any prop-plane could. The acceleration made the muscles at\nthe front of Joe's throat ache as he held his head upright against it.\n\n\"They'll be proximity----\"\n\nThen the plane bucked. Very probably, at that moment, it was stretched\nfar past the limit of strain for which even its factor of safety was\ndesigned. One rocket had let go. The others went with it. The rockets\nhad had proximity fuses. If they had ringed the transport ship and gone\noff with it enclosed, it would now be a tumbling mass of wreckage. But\nthe jatos had thrown the plane out ahead of the target area. Suddenly\nthey cut off, and it seemed as if the ship had braked. But the pilot\ndived steeply, for speed.\n\nThe co-pilot was saying coldly into the microphone: \"He shot rockets.\nLooked like Army issue three point fives with proximities. They missed.\nAnd we're mighty lonely!\"\n\nThe transport tore on, both pilots grimly watching the cloud bank below.\nThey moved their bodies as they stared out the windows, so that by no\npossibility could any part of the plane mask something that they should\nsee. As they searched, the co-pilot spoke evenly into the microphone at\nhis lips: \"He wouldn't carry more than four rockets, and he's dumping\nhis racks and firing equipment now. But he might have a friend with him.\nBetter get here quick if you want to catch him. He'll be the innocentest\nprivate pilot you ever saw in no time!\"\n\nThen the pilot grunted. Something was streaking across the cloud\nformation far, far ahead. Three things. They were jet planes, and they\nseemed not so much to approach as to swell in size. They were coming at\nbetter than five hundred knots--ten miles a minute--and the transport\nwas heading for them at its top speed of three hundred knots. The\ntransport and the flight of jets neared each other at the rate of a mile\nin less than four seconds.\n\nThe co-pilot said crisply: \"Silver Messner with red wing-tips. The\nnumber began----\" He gave the letter and first digits of the vanished\nplane's official designation, without which it could not take off from\nor be serviced at any flying field.\n\nJoe heard an insistent, swift _beep-beep-beep-beep_ which would be the\nradars of the approaching jets. He could not hear any answers that might\nreach the co-pilot as he talked to unseen persons who would relay his\nwords to the jet fighters.\n\nOne of them peeled off and sank into the cloud layer. The others came\non. They set up in great circles about the transport, crossing before\nit, above it, around it, which gave the effect of flying around an\nobject not in motion at all.\n\nThe pilot flew on, frowning. The co-pilot said: \"Yes. Sure! I'm\nlistening!\" There was a pause. Then he said: \"Check. Thanks.\"\n\nHe hung the instrument back where it belonged, above his head and behind\nhim. He thoughtfully mopped his brow. He looked at Joe.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said mildly, \"you believe me when I tell you there's a sort\nof hot war on, to keep the Platform from taking off.\"\n\nThe pilot grunted. \"Here's the third jet coming up.\"\n\nIt was true. The jet that had dived into the clouds came up out of the\ncloud formation with somehow an air of impassive satisfaction.\n\n\"Did they spot the guy?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said the co-pilot. \"He must've picked up my report. He didn't\ndump his radar. He stayed in the cloud bank. When the jet came for\nhim--spotting him with its night-fighter stuff--he tried to ram. Tried\nfor a collision. So the jet gave him the works. Blew him apart. Couldn't\nmake him land. Maybe they'll pick up something from the wreckage.\"\n\nJoe wet his lips.\n\n\"I--saw what happened,\" he said. \"He tried to smash us with rockets.\nWhere'd he get them? How were they smuggled in?\"\n\nThe co-pilot shrugged. \"Maybe smuggled in. Maybe stolen. They coulda\nbeen landed from a sub anywhere on a good many thousand miles of coast.\nThey coulda been hauled anywhere in a station wagon. The plane was a\nprivate-type ship. Plenty of them flying around. It could've been bought\neasily enough. All they'd need would be a farm somewhere where it could\nland and they could strap on a rocket rack and put in a radar. And\nthey'd need information. Probably be a good lead, this business. Only\njust so many people could know what was coming on this ship, and what\ncourse it was flying, and so on. Security will have to check back from\nthat angle.\"\n\nA shadow fell upon the transport ship. A jet shot past from above it. It\nwaggled its wings and changed course.\n\n\"We've got to land and be checked for damage,\" said the co-pilot\nnegligently. \"These guys will circle us and lead the way--as if we\nneeded it!\"\n\nJoe subsided. He still had in his mind the glamorous and infinitely\nalluring picture of the Space Platform floating grandly in its orbit,\nwith white-hot sunshine on it and a multitude of stars beyond. He had\nbeen completely absorbed in that aspect of the job that dealt with the\nmethod of construction and the technical details by which the Platform\ncould be made to work.\n\nNow he had a side light on the sort of thing that has to be done when\nanything important is achieved. Figuring out how a thing can be done is\nonly part of the job. Overcoming the obstacles to the apparently\ncommonplace steps is nine-tenths of the difficulty. It had seemed to him\nthat the most dramatic aspect of building the Space Platform had been\nthe achievement of a design that would work in space, that could be\ngotten up into space, and that could be lived in under circumstances\nnever before experienced. Now he saw that getting the materials to the\nspot where they were needed called for nearly as much brains and effort.\nScreening out spies and destructionists--that would be an even greater\nachievement!\n\nHe began to feel a tremendous respect and solicitude for the people who\nwere doing ordinary jobs in the building of the Platform. And he worried\nabout his own share more than ever.\n\nPresently the transport ship sank toward the clouds. It sped through\nthem, stone-blind from the mist. And then there was a small airfield\nbelow, and the pilot and co-pilot began a pattern of ritualistic\nconversation.\n\n\"Pitot and wing heaters?\" asked the pilot.\n\nThe co-pilot put his hand successively on two controls.\n\n\"Off.\"\n\n\"Spark advance?\"\n\nThe co-pilot moved his hands.\n\n\"Take-off and climb?\" said the co-pilot.\n\n\"Blowers?\"\n\n\"Low.\"\n\n\"Fuel selectors?\"\n\nThe co-pilot moved his hands again to the appropriate controls,\nverifying that they were as he reported them.\n\n\"Main on,\" he said matter-of-factly, \"crossfeed off.\"\n\nThe transport plane slanted down steeply for the landing field that had\nlooked so small at first, but expanded remarkably as they drew near.\n\nJoe found himself frowning. He began to see how really big a job it was\nto get a Space Platform even ready to take off for a journey that in\ntheory should last forever. It was daunting to think that before a space\nship could be built and powered and equipped with machinery there had to\nbe such wildly irrelevant plans worked out as a proper check of controls\nfor the piston-engine ships that flew parts to the job. The details were\ninnumerable!\n\nBut the job was still worth doing. Joe was glad he was going to have a\nshare in it.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nIt was a merely misty day. The transport plane stood by the door of a\nhangar on this military field, and mechanics stood well back from it and\nlooked it over. A man crawled over the tail assembly and found one small\nhole in the fabric of the stabilizer. A shell fragment had gone through\nwhen the war rockets exploded nearby. The pilot verified that the\nfragment had hit no strengthening member inside. He nodded. The mechanic\nmade very neat fabric patches over the two holes, upper and lower. He\nbegan to go over the fuselage. The pilot turned away.\n\n\"I'll go talk to Bootstrap,\" he told the co-pilot. \"You keep an eye on\nthings.\"\n\n\"I'll keep two eyes on them,\" said the co-pilot.\n\nThe pilot went toward the control tower of the field. Joe looked around.\nThe transport ship seemed very large, standing on the concrete apron\nwith its tricycle landing gear let down. It curiously resembled a\nmisshapen insect, standing elaborately high on inadequate supporting\nlegs. Its fuselage, in particular, did not look right for an aircraft.\nThe top of the cargo section went smoothly back to the stabilizing fins,\nbut the bottom did not taper. It ended astern in a clumsy-looking bulge\nthat was closed by a pair of huge clamshell doors, opening straight\nastern. It was built that way, of course, so that large objects could be\nloaded direct into the cargo hold, but it was neither streamlined nor\ngraceful.\n\n\"Did anything get into the cargo hold?\" asked Joe in sudden anxiety.\n\"Did the cases I'm with get hit?\"\n\nAfter all, four rockets had exploded deplorably near the ship. If one\nfragment had struck, others might have.\n\n\"Nothing big, anyhow,\" the co-pilot told him. \"We'll know presently.\"\n\nBut examination showed no other sign of the ship's recent nearness to\ndestruction. It had been overstressed, certainly, but ships are built to\ntake beatings. A spot check on areas where excessive flexing of the\nwings would have shown up--a big ship's wings are not perfectly rigid:\nthey'd come to pieces in the air if they were--presented no evidence of\ndamage. The ship was ready to take off again.\n\nThe co-pilot watched grimly until the one mechanic went back to the side\nlines. The mechanic was not cordial. He and all the others regarded the\nship and Joe and the co-pilot with disfavor. They worked on jets, and to\nsuggest that men who worked on fighter jets were not worthy of complete\nconfidence did not set well with them. The co-pilot noticed it.\n\n\"They think I'm a suspicious heel,\" he said sourly to Joe, \"but I have\nto be. The best spies and saboteurs in the world have been hired to mess\nup the Platform. When better saboteurs are made, they'll be sent over\nhere to get busy!\"\n\nThe pilot came back from the control tower.\n\n\"Special flight orders,\" he told his companion. \"We top off with fuel\nand get going.\"\n\nMechanics got out the fuel hose, dragging it from the pit. One man\nclimbed up on the wing. Other men handed up the hose. Joe was moved to\ncomment, but the co-pilot was reading the new flight instructions. It\nwas one of those moments of inconsistency to which anybody and everybody\nis liable. The two men of the ship's crew had it in mind to be\ninfinitely suspicious of anybody examining their ship. But fueling it\nwas so completely standard an operation that they merely stood by\nabsently while it went on. They had the orders to read and memorize,\nanyhow.\n\nOne wing tank was full. A big, grinning man with sandy hair dragged the\nhose under the nose of the plane to take it to the other wing tank.\nClose by the nose wheel he slipped and steadied himself by the shaft\nwhich reaches down to the wheel's hub. His position for a moment was\nabsurdly ungraceful. When he straightened up, his arm slid into the\nwheel well. But he dragged the hose the rest of the way and passed it on\nup. Then that tank was full and capped. The refueling crew got down to\nthe ground and fed the hose back to the pit which devoured it. That was\nall. But somehow Joe remembered the sandy-haired man and his arm going\nup inside the wheel well for a fraction of a second.\n\nThe pilot read one part of the flight orders again and tore them\ncarefully across. One part he touched his pocket lighter to. It burned.\nHe nodded yet again to the co-pilot, and they swung up and in the\npilots' doorway. Joe followed.\n\nThey settled in their places in the cabin. The pilot threw a switch and\npressed a knob. One motor turned over stiffly, and caught. The second.\nThird. Fourth. The pilot listened, was satisfied, and pulled back on the\nmultiple throttle. The plane trundled away. Minutes later it faced the\nlong runway, a tinny voice from the control tower spoke out of a\nloud-speaker under the instruments, and the plane roared down the field.\nIn seconds it lifted and swept around in a great half-circle.\n\n\"Okay,\" said the pilot. \"Wheels up.\"\n\nThe co-pilot obeyed. The telltale lights that showed the wheels\nretracted glowed briefly. The men relaxed.\n\n\"You know,\" said the co-pilot, \"there was the devil of a time during the\nWar with sabotage. Down in Brazil there was a field planes used to take\noff from to fly to Africa. But they'd take off, head out to sea, get a\nfew miles offshore, and then blow up. We must've lost a dozen planes\nthat way! Then it broke. There was a guy--a sergeant--in the maintenance\ncrew who was sticking a hand grenade up in the nose wheel wells. German,\nhe was, and very tidy about it, and nobody suspected him. Everything\nlooked okay and tested okay. But when the ship was well away and the\ncrew pulled up the wheels, that tightened a string and it pulled the pin\nout of the grenade. It went off.... The master mechanic finally caught\nhim and nearly killed him before the MPs could stop him. We've got to be\nplenty careful, whether the ground crews like it or not.\"\n\nJoe said drily: \"You were, except when they were topping off. You took\nthat for granted.\" He told about the sandy-haired man. \"He hadn't time\nto stick anything in the wheel well, though,\" he added.\n\nThe co-pilot blinked. Then he looked annoyed. \"Confound it! I didn't\nwatch! Did you?\"\n\nThe pilot shook his head, his lips compressed.\n\nThe co-pilot said bitterly: \"And I thought I was security-conscious!\nThanks for telling me, fella. No harm done this time, but that was a\nslip!\"\n\nHe scowled at the dials before him. The plane flew on.\n\nThis was the last leg of the trip, and now it should be no more than an\nhour and a half before they reached their destination. Joe felt a lift\nof elation. The Space Platform was a realization--or the beginning of\nit--of a dream that had been Joe's since he was a very small boy. It was\nalso the dream of most other small boys at the time. The Space Platform\nwould make space travel possible. Of course it wouldn't make journeys to\nthe moon or planets itself, but it would sail splendidly about the Earth\nin an orbit some four thousand miles up, and it would gird the world in\nfour hours fourteen minutes and twenty-two seconds. It would carry\natom-headed guided missiles, and every city in the world would be\ndefenseless against it. Nobody could even hope for world domination so\nlong as it floated on its celestial round. Which, naturally, was why\nthere were such desperate efforts to destroy it before its completion.\n\nBut Joe, thinking about the Platform, did not think about it as a\nweapon. It was the first rung on the stepladder to the stars. From it\nthe moon would be reached, certainly. Mars next, most likely. Then\nVenus. In time the moons of Saturn, and the twilight zone of Mercury,\nand some day the moons of Jupiter. Possibly a landing could be dared on\nthat giant planet itself, despite its gravity.\n\nThe co-pilot spoke suddenly. \"How do you rate this trip by cargo plane?\"\nhe asked curiously. \"Mostly even generals have to go on the ground. You\nrate plenty. How?\"\n\nJoe pulled his thoughts back from satisfied imagining. It hadn't\noccurred to him that it was remarkable that he should be allowed to\naccompany the gyros from the plant to their destination. His family firm\nhad built them, so it had seemed natural to him. He wasn't used to the\nidea that everybody looked suspicious to a security officer concerned\nwith the safety of the Platform.\n\n\"Connections? I haven't any,\" said Joe. Then he said, \"I do know\nsomebody on the job. There's a Major Holt out there. He might have\ncleared me. Known my family for years.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said the co-pilot drily. \"He might. As a matter of fact, he's\nthe senior security officer for the whole job. He's in charge of\neverything, from the security guards to the radar screens and the\njet-plane umbrella and the checking of the men who work in the Shed. If\nhe says you're all right, you probably are.\"\n\nJoe hadn't meant to seem impressive. He explained: \"I don't know him too\nwell. He knows my father, and his daughter Sally's been kicking around\nunderfoot most of my life. I taught her how to shoot, and she's a better\nshot than I am. She was a nice kid when she was little. I got to like\nher when she fell out of a tree and broke her arm and didn't even\nwhimper. That shows how long ago it was!\" He grinned. \"She was trying to\nact grown-up last time I saw her.\"\n\nThe co-pilot nodded. There was a brisk chirping sound somewhere. The\npilot reached ahead to the course-correction knob. The plane changed\ncourse. Sunshine shifted as it poured into the cabin. The ship was\nrunning on automatic pilot well above the cloud level, and at an\neven-numbered number of thousands of feet altitude, as was suitable for\nplanes traveling south or west. Now it droned on its new course,\nforty-five degrees from the original. Joe found himself guessing that\none of the security provisions for planes approaching the Platform might\nbe that they should not come too near on a direct line to it, lest they\ngive information to curious persons on the ground.\n\nTime went on. Joe slipped gradually back to his meditations about the\nPlatform. There was always, in his mind, the picture of a man-made thing\nshining in blinding sunlight between Earth and moon. But he began to\nremember things he hadn't paid too much attention to before.\n\nOpposition to the bare idea of a Space Platform, for instance, from the\nmoment it was first proposed. Every dictator protested bitterly. Even\npoliticians out of office found it a subject for rabble-rousing\nharangues. The nationalistic political parties, the peddlers of hate,\nthe entrepreneurs of discord--every crank in the world had something to\nsay against the Platform from the first. When they did not roundly\ndenounce it as impious, they raved that it was a scheme by which the\nUnited States would put itself in position to rule all the Earth. As a\nmatter of fact, the United States had first proposed it as a United\nNations enterprise, so that denunciations that politicians found good\npolitics actually made very poor sense. But it did not get past the\nGeneral Assembly. The proposal was so rabidly attacked on every side\nthat it was not even passed up to the Council--where it would certainly\nhave been vetoed anyhow.\n\nBut it was exactly that furious denunciation which put the Platform\nthrough the United States Congress, which had to find the money for its\nconstruction.\n\nIn Joe's eyes and in the eyes of most of those who hoped for it from the\nbeginning, the Platform's great appeal was that it was the necessary\nfirst step toward interplanetary travel, with star ships yet to come.\nBut most scientists wanted it, desperately, for their own ends. There\nwere low-temperature experiments, electronic experiments, weather\nobservations, star-temperature measurements, astronomical\nobservations.... Any man in any field of science could name reasons for\nit to be built. Even the atom scientists had one, and nearly the best.\nTheir argument was that there were new developments of nuclear theory\nthat needed to be tried out, but should not be tried out on Earth. There\nwere some reactions that ought to yield unlimited power for all the\nworld from really abundant materials. But there was one chance in fifty\nthat they wouldn't be safe, just because the materials were so abundant.\nNo sane man would risk a two-per-cent chance of destroying Earth and all\nits people, yet those reactions should be tried. In a space ship some\nmillions of miles out in emptiness they could be. Either they'd be safe\nor they would not. But the only way to get a space ship a safe enough\ndistance from Earth was to make a Space Platform as a starting point.\nThen a ship could shoot away from Earth with effectively zero gravity\nand full fuel tanks. The Platform should be built so civilization could\nsurge ahead to new heights!\n\nBut despite these excellent reasons, it was the Platform's enemies who\nreally got it built. The American Congress would never have appropriated\nfunds for a Platform for pure scientific research, no matter what\npeacetime benefits it promised. It was the vehemence of those who hated\nit that sold it to Congress as a measure for national defense. And in a\nsense it was.\n\nThese were ironic aspects Joe hadn't thought about before, just as he\nhadn't thought about the need to defend the Platform while it was being\nbuilt. Defending it was Sally's father's job, and he wouldn't have a\npopular time. Joe wondered idly how Sally liked living out where the\nmost important job on Earth was being done. She was a nice kid. He\nremembered appreciatively that she'd grown up to be a very good-looking\ngirl. He tended to remember her mostly as the tomboy who could beat him\nswimming, but the last time he'd seen her, come to think of it, he'd\nbeen startled to observe how pretty she'd grown. He didn't know anybody\nwho ought to be better-looking.... She was a really swell girl....\n\nHe came to himself again. There was a change in the look of the sky\nahead. There was no actual horizon, of course. There was a white haze\nthat blended imperceptibly into the cloud layer so that it was\nimpossible to tell where the sky ended and the clouds or earth began.\nBut presently there were holes in the clouds. The ship droned on, and\nsuddenly it floated over the edge of such a hole, and looking down was\nvery much like looking over the edge of a cliff at solid earth\nillimitably far below.\n\nThe holes increased in number. Then there were no holes at all, but only\nclouds breaking up the clear view of the ground beneath. And presently\nagain even the clouds were left behind and the air was clear--but still\nthere was no horizon--and there was brownish earth with small green\npatches and beyond was sere brown range. At seventeen thousand feet\nthere were simply no details.\n\nSoon the clouds were merely a white-tipped elevation of the white haze\nto the sides and behind. And then there came a new sound above the\ndroning roar of the motors. Joe heard it--and then he saw.\n\nSomething had flashed down from nowhere. It flashed on ahead and banked\nsteeply. It was a fighter jet, and for an instant Joe saw the distant\nrange seem to ripple and dance in its exhaust blast. It circled\nwatchfully.\n\nThe transport pilot manipulated something. There was a change in the\nsound of the motors. Joe followed the co-pilot's eyes. The jet fighter\nwas coming up astern, dive brakes extended to reduce its speed. It\noverhauled the transport very slowly. And then the transport's pilot\ntouched one of the separate prop-controls gently, and again, and again.\nJoe, looking at the jet, saw it through the whirling blades. There was\nan extraordinary stroboscopic effect. One of the two starboard\npropellers, seen through the other, abruptly took on a look which was\nnot that of mistiness at all, but of writhing, gyrating solidity. The\npeculiar appearance vanished, and came again, and vanished and appeared\nyet again before it disappeared completely.\n\nThe jet shot on ahead. Its dive brakes retracted. It made a graceful,\nwallowing, shallow dive, and then climbed almost vertically. It went out\nof sight.\n\n\"Visual check,\" said the co-pilot drily, to Joe. \"We had a signal to\ngive. Individual to this plane. We didn't tell it to you. You couldn't\nduplicate it.\"\n\nJoe worked it out painfully. The visual effect of one propeller seen\nthrough another--that was identification. It was not a type of signaling\nan unauthorized or uninformed passenger would expect.\n\n\"Also,\" said the co-pilot, \"we have a television camera in the\ninstrument board yonder. We've turned it on now. The interior of the\ncabin is being watched from the ground. No more tricks like the phony\ncolonel and the atom bomb that didn't 'explode.'\"\n\nJoe sat quite still. He noticed that the plane was slanting gradually\ndownward. His eyes went to the dial that showed descent at somewhere\nbetween two and three hundred feet a minute. That was for his benefit.\nThe cabin was pressurized, though it did not attempt to simulate\nsea-level pressure. It was a good deal better than the outside air,\nhowever, and yet too quick a descent meant discomfort. Two to three\nhundred feet per minute is about right.\n\nThe ground took on features. Small gulleys. Patches of coloration too\nsmall to be seen from farther up. The feeling of speed increased. After\nlong minutes the plane was only a few thousand feet up. The pilot took\nover manual control from the automatic pilot. He seemed to wait. There\nwas a plaintive, mechanical _beep-beep_ and he changed course.\n\n\"You'll see the Shed in a minute or two,\" said the co-pilot. He added\nvexedly, as if the thing had been bothering him, \"I wish I hadn't missed\nthat sandy-haired guy putting his hand in the wheel well! Nothing\nhappened, but I shouldn't have missed it!\"\n\nJoe watched. Very, very far away there were mountains, but he suddenly\nrealized the remarkable flatness of the ground over which they were\nflying. From the edge of the world, behind, to the very edge of these\nfar-distant hills, the ground was flat. There were gullies and\ndepressions here and there, but no hills. It was flat, flat, flat....\n\nThe plane flew on. There was a tiny glimmer of sunlight. Joe strained\nhis eyes. The sunlight glinted from the tiniest possible round pip on\nthe brown earth. It grew as the plane flew on. It was half a cherry\nstone. It was half an orange, with gores. It was the top section of a\nsphere that was simply too huge to have been made by men.\n\nThere was a thin thread of white that ran across the dun-colored range\nand reached that half-ball and then ended. It was a highway. Joe\nrealized that the half-globe was the Shed, the monstrous building made\nfor the construction of the Space Platform. It was gigantic. It was\ncolossal. It was the most stupendous thing that men had ever created.\n\nJoe saw a tiny projection near the base of it. It was an office building\nfor clerks and timekeepers and other white-collar workers. He strained\nhis eyes again and saw a motor truck on the highway. It looked\nextraordinarily flat. Then he saw that it wasn't a single truck but a\nconvoy of them. A long way back, the white highway was marked by a tiny\ndot. That was a motor bus.\n\nThere was no sign of activity anywhere, because the scale was so great.\nMovement there was, but the things that moved were too small to be seen\nby comparison with the Shed. The huge, round, shining half-sphere of\nmetal stood tranquilly in the midst of emptiness.\n\nIt was bigger than the pyramids.\n\nThe plane went on, descending. Joe craned his neck, and then he was\nashamed to gawk. He looked ahead, and far away there were white speckles\nthat would be buildings: Bootstrap, the town especially built for the\nmen who built the Space Platform. In it they slept and ate and engaged\nin the uproarious festivity that men on a construction job crave on\ntheir time off.\n\nThe plane dipped noticeably.\n\n\"Airfield off to the right,\" said the co-pilot. \"That's for the town and\nthe job. The jets--there's an air umbrella overhead all the time--have a\nfield somewhere else. The pushpots have a field of their own, too, where\nthey're training pilots.\"\n\nJoe didn't know what a pushpot was, but he didn't ask. He was thinking\nabout the Shed, which was the greatest building ever put up, and had\nbeen built merely to shelter the greatest hope for the world's peace\nwhile it was put together. He'd be in the Shed presently. He'd work\nthere, setting up the contents of the crates back in the cargo space,\nand finally installing them in the Platform itself.\n\nThe pilot said: \"Pitot and wing heaters?\"\n\n\"Off,\" said the co-pilot.\n\n\"Spark and advance----\"\n\nJoe didn't listen. He looked down at the sprawling small town with\nwhite-painted barracks and a business section and an obvious, carefully\ndesigned recreation area that nobody would ever use. The plane was\nmaking a great half-circle. The motor noise dimmed as Joe became\nabsorbed in his anticipation of seeing the Space Platform and having a\nhand in its building.\n\nThe co-pilot said sharply: \"Hold everything!\"\n\nJoe jerked his head around. The co-pilot had his hand on the wheel\nrelease. His face was tense.\n\n\"It don't feel right,\" he said very, very quietly. \"Maybe I'm crazy, but\nthere was that sandy-haired guy who put his hand up in the wheel well\nback at that last field. And this don't feel right!\"\n\nThe plane swept on. The airfield passed below it. The co-pilot very\ncautiously let go of the wheel release, which when pulled should let the\nwheels fall down from their wells to lock themselves in landing\nposition. He moved from his seat. His lips were pinched and tight. He\nscrabbled at a metal plate in the flooring. He lifted it and looked\ndown. A moment later he had a flashlight. Joe saw the edge of a mirror.\nThere were two mirrors down there, in fact. One could look through both\nof them into the wheel well.\n\nThe co-pilot made quite sure. He stood up, leaving the plate off the\nopening in the floor.\n\n\"There's something down in the wheel well,\" he said in a brittle tone.\n\"It looks to me like a grenade. There's a string tied to it. At a guess,\nthat sandy-haired guy set it up like that saboteur sergeant down in\nBrazil. Only--it rolled a little. And this one goes off when the wheels\ngo down. I think, too, if we belly-land----Better go around again, huh?\"\n\nThe pilot nodded. \"First,\" he said evenly, \"we get word down to the\nground about the sandy-haired guy, so they'll get him regardless.\"\n\nHe picked up the microphone hanging above and behind him and began to\nspeak coldly into it. The transport plane started to swing in wide,\nsweeping circles over the desert beyond the airport while the pilot\nexplained that there was a grenade in the nose wheel well, set to\nexplode if the wheel were let down or, undoubtedly, if the ship came in\nto a belly landing.\n\nJoe found himself astonishingly unafraid. But he was filled with a\npounding rage. He hated the people who wanted to smash the pilot gyros\nbecause they were essential to the Space Platform. He hated them more\ncompletely than he had known he could hate anybody. He was so filled\nwith fury that it did not occur to him that in any crash or explosive\nlanding that would ruin the gyros, he would automatically be killed.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe pilot made an examination down the floor-plate hole, with a\nflashlight to see by and two mirrors to show him the contents of a spot\nhe could not possibly reach with any instrument. Joe heard his report,\nmade to the ground by radio.\n\n\"It's a grenade,\" he said coldly. \"It took time to fix it the way it is.\nAt a guess, the ship was booby-trapped at the time of its last overhaul.\nBut it was arranged that the booby trap had to be set, the trigger\ncocked, by somebody doing something very simple at a different place and\nlater on. We've been flying with that grenade in the wheel well for two\nweeks. But it was out of sight. Today, back at the airfield, a\nsandy-haired man reached up and pulled a string he knew how to find.\nThat loosened a slipknot. The grenade rolled down to a new position. Now\nwhen the wheel goes down the pin is pulled. You can figure things out\nfrom that.\"\n\nIt was an excellent sabotage device. If a ship blew up two weeks after\noverhaul, it would not be guessed that the bomb had been placed so long\nbefore. Every search would be made for a recent opportunity for the\nbomb's placing. A man who merely reached in and pulled a string that\narmed the bomb and made it ready for firing would never be suspected.\nThere might be dozens of planes, now carrying their own destruction\nabout with them.\n\nThe pilot said into the microphone: \"Probably....\" He listened. \"Very\nwell, sir.\"\n\nHe turned away and nodded to the co-pilot, now savagely keeping the ship\nin wide, sweeping circles, the rims of which barely touched the\nfarthermost corner of the airport on the ground below.\n\n\"We've authority to jump,\" he said briefly. \"You know where the chutes\nare. But there _is_ a chance I can belly-land without that grenade\nblowing. I'm going to try that.\"\n\nThe co-pilot said angrily: \"I'll get him a chute.\" He indicated Joe, and\nsaid furiously, \"They've been known to try two or three tricks, just to\nmake sure. Ask if we should dump cargo before we crash-land!\"\n\nThe pilot held up the microphone again. He spoke. He listened.\n\n\"Okay to dump stuff to lighten ship.\"\n\n\"You won't dump my crates,\" snapped Joe. \"And I'm staying to see you\ndon't! If you can ride this ship down, so can I!\"\n\nThe co-pilot got up and scowled at him.\n\n\"Anything I can move out, goes. Will you help?\"\n\nJoe followed him through the door into the cargo compartment.\n\nThe space there was very considerable, and bitterly cold. The crates\nfrom the Kenmore plant were the heaviest items of cargo. Other objects\nwere smaller. The co-pilot made his way to the rear and pulled a lever.\nGreat, curved doors opened at the back of the plane. Instantly there was\nsuch a bellowing of motors that all speech was impossible. The co-pilot\npulled out a clip of colored-paper slips and checked one with the\nnearest movable parcel. He painstakingly made a check mark and began to\npush the box toward the doors.\n\nIt was not a conspicuously sane operation. So near the ground, the plane\ntended to waver. The air was distinctly bumpy. To push a massive box out\na doorway, so it would tumble down a thousand feet to desert sands, was\nnot so safe a matter as would let it become tedious. But Joe helped.\nThey got the box to the door and shoved it out. It went spinning down.\nThe co-pilot hung onto the doorframe and watched it land. He chose\nanother box. He checked it. And another. Joe helped. They got them out\nof the door and dropping dizzily through emptiness. The plane soared on\nin circles. The desert, as seen through the opened clamshell doors,\nreeled away astern, and then seemed to tilt, and reeled away again. Joe\nand the co-pilot labored furiously. But the co-pilot checked each item\nbefore he jettisoned it.\n\nIt was a singularly deliberate way to dump cargo to destruction. A\nmetal-bound box. Over the edge of the cargo space floor. A piece of\nmachinery, visible through its crate. A box marked _Instruments_.\n_Fragile_. Each one checked off. Each one dumped to drop a thousand feet\nor more. A small crated dynamo. This item and that. A crate marked\n_Stationery_. It would be printed forms for the timekeepers, perhaps.\nBut it wasn't.\n\nIt dropped out. The plane bellowed on. And suddenly there was a burst of\nblue-white flame on the desert below. The box that should have contained\ntimecards had contained something very much more explosive. As the plane\nroared on--rocking from the shock wave of the explosion--Joe saw a\ncrater and a boiling cloud of smoke and flying sand.\n\nThe co-pilot spoke explosively and furiously, in the blasting uproar of\nthe motors. He vengefully marked the waybill of the parcel that had\nexploded. But then they went back to the job of dumping cargo. They\nworked well as a team now. In no more than minutes everything was out\nexcept the four crates that were the gyros. The co-pilot regarded them\ndourly, and Joe clenched his fists. The co-pilot closed the clamshell\ndoors, and it became possible to hear oneself think again.\n\n\"Ship's lighter, anyhow,\" reported the co-pilot, back in the cabin.\n\"Tell 'em this is what exploded.\"\n\nThe pilot took the slip. He plucked down the microphone--exactly like\nsomebody picking up an interoffice telephone--and reported the waybill\nnumber and description of the case that had been an extra bomb. The ship\ncarrying the pilot gyros had been booby-trapped--probably with a number\nof other ships--and a bomb had been shipped on it, and a special\nsaboteur with a private plane had shot at it with rockets. The pilot\ngyros were critical devices. They had to be on board the Platform when\nit took off, and they took months to make and balance. There had been\nextra pains taken to prevent their arrival!\n\n\"I'm dumping gas now,\" said the pilot into the microphone, \"and then\ncoming in for a belly landing.\"\n\nThe ship flew straightaway. It flew more lightly, and it bounced a\nlittle. When gas is dumped one has to slow to not more than one hundred\nand seventy-five knots and fly level. Then one is supposed to fly five\nminutes after dumping with the chutes in the drain position--and even\nthen there is forty-five minutes of flying fuel still in the tanks.\n\nThe ship swept around and headed back for the now far-distant field. It\nwent slowly lower and lower and lower until it seemed barely to skim the\nminor irregularities in the ground. And low like this, the effect of\nspeed was terrific.\n\nThe co-pilot thought of something. Quickly he went back into the cargo\nspace. He returned with an armful of blankets. He dumped them on the\nfloor.\n\n\"If that grenade does go!\" he said sourly.\n\nJoe helped. In the few minutes before Bootstrap loomed near, they filled\nthe bottom of the cabin with blankets. Especially around the pilots'\nchairs. And there was a mound of blanketing above the actual place where\nthe grenade might be. It made sense. Soft stuff like blankets would\nabsorb an explosion better than anything else. But the pilot thought the\ngrenade might not blow.\n\n\"Hold fast!\" snapped the pilot.\n\nThe wing flaps were down. That slowed the ship a little. It had been\nlightened. That helped. They went in over the edge of the field less\nthan man-height high. Joe found his hands closing convulsively on a\nhandgrip. He saw a crash wagon starting out from the side of the runway.\nA fire truck started for the line the plane followed.\n\nFour feet above the rushing sand. Three. The pilot eased back the stick.\nHis face was craggy and very grim and very hard. The ship's tail went\ndown and dragged. It bumped. Then the plane careened and slid and\nhalf-whirled crazily, and then the world seemed to come to an end.\nCrashes. Bangs. Shrieks of torn metal. Bumps, thumps and grindings. Then\na roaring.\n\nJoe pulled himself loose from where he had been flung--it seemed to him\nthat he peeled himself loose--and found the pilot struggling up, and he\ngrabbed him to help, and the co-pilot hauled at them both, and abruptly\nall three of them were in the open air and running at full speed away\nfrom the ship.\n\nThe roar abruptly became a bellowing. There was an explosion. Flames\nsprouted everywhere. The three men ran stumblingly. But even as they\nran, the co-pilot swore.\n\n\"We left something!\" he panted.\n\nJoe heard a crescendo of booming, crackling noises behind. Something\nelse exploded dully. But he should be far enough away by now.\n\nHe turned to look, and he saw blackening wreckage immersed in roaring\nflames. The flames were monstrous. They rose sky-high, it seemed--more\nflames than forty-five minutes of gasoline should have produced. As he\nlooked, something blew up shatteringly, and fire raged even more\nfuriously. Of course in such heat the delicately adjusted gyros would be\nwarped and ruined even if the crash hadn't wrecked them beforehand. Joe\nmade thick, incoherent sounds of rage.\n\nThe plane was now an incomplete, twisted skeleton, licked through by\nflames. The crash wagon roared to a stop beside them.\n\n\"Anybody hurt? Anybody left inside?\"\n\nJoe shook his head, unable to speak for despairing rage. The fog wagon\nroared up, already spouting mist from its nozzles. Its tanks contained\nwater treated with detergent so that it broke into the finest of\ndroplets when sprayed at four hundred pounds pressure. It drenched the\nburning wreck with that heavy mist, in which a man would drown. No fire\ncould possibly sustain itself. In seconds, it seemed, there were only\nsteam and white vapor and fumes of smoldering substances that gradually\nlessened.\n\nBut then there was a roaring of motorcycles racing across the field with\na black car trailing them. The car pulled up beside the fog wagon, then\nsped swiftly to where Joe was coming out of wild rage and sinking into\nsick, black depression. He'd been responsible for the pilot gyros and\ntheir safe arrival. What had happened wasn't his fault, but it was not\nhis job merely to remain blameless. It was his job to get the gyros\ndelivered and set up in the Space Platform. He had failed.\n\nThe black car braked to a stop. There was Major Holt. Joe had seen him\nsix months before. He'd aged a good deal. He looked grimly at the two\npilots.\n\n\"What happened?\" he demanded. \"You dumped your fuel! What burned like\nthis?\"\n\nJoe said thickly: \"Everything was dumped but the pilot gyros. They\ndidn't burn! They were packed at the plant!\"\n\nThe co-pilot suddenly made an incoherent sound of rage. \"I've got it!\"\nhe said hoarsely. \"I know----\"\n\n\"What?\" snapped Major Holt.\n\n\"They--planted that grenade at the--major overhaul!\" panted the\nco-pilot, too enraged even to swear. \"They--fixed it so--any trouble\nwould mean a wreck! And I--pulled the fire-extinguisher releases just as\nwe hit! For all compartments! To flood everything with CO_2! But it\nwasn't CO_2! That's what burned!\"\n\nMajor Holt stared sharply at him. He held up his hand. Somebody\nmaterialized beside him. He said harshly: \"Get the extinguisher bottles\nsealed and take them to the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n\nA man went running toward the wreck. Major Holt said coldly: \"That's a\nnew one. We should have thought of it. You men get yourselves attended\nto and report to Security at the Shed.\"\n\nThe pilot and co-pilot turned away. Joe turned to go with them. Then he\nheard Sally's voice, a little bit wobbly: \"Joe! Come with us, please!\"\n\nJoe hadn't seen her, but she was in the car. She was pale. Her eyes were\nwide and frightened.\n\nJoe said stiffly: \"I'll be all right. I want to look at those\ncrates----\"\n\nMajor Holt said curtly: \"They're already under guard. There'll have to\nbe photographs made before anything can be touched. And I want a report\nfrom you, anyhow. Come along!\"\n\nJoe looked. The motorcycles were abandoned, and there were already armed\nguards around the still-steaming wreck, grimly watching the men of the\nfog wagon as they hunted for remaining sparks or flame. It was\nnoticeable that now nobody moved toward the wreck. There were figures\nwalking back toward the edge of the field. What civilians were about,\neven to the mechanics on duty, had started out to look at the debris at\nclose range. But the guards were on the job. Nobody could approach. The\nonlookers went back to their proper places.\n\n\"Please, Joe!\" said Sally shakily.\n\nJoe got drearily into the car. The instant he seated himself, it was in\nmotion again. It went plunging back across the field and out the\nentrance. Its horn blared and it went streaking toward the town and\nabruptly turned to the left. In seconds it was on a broad white highway\nthat left the town behind and led toward the emptiness of the desert.\n\nBut not quite emptiness. Far, far away there was a great half-globe\nrising against the horizon. The car hummed toward it, tires singing. And\nJoe looked at it and felt ashamed, because this was the home of the\nSpace Platform, and he hadn't brought to it the part for which he alone\nwas responsible.\n\nSally moistened her lips. She brought out a small box. She opened it.\nThere were bandages and bottles.\n\n\"I've a first-aid kit, Joe,\" she said shakily. \"You're burned. Let me\nfix the worst ones, anyhow!\"\n\nJoe looked at himself. One coat sleeve was burned to charcoal. His hair\nwas singed on one side. A trouser leg was burned off around the ankle.\nWhen he noticed, his burns hurt.\n\nMajor Holt watched her spread a salve on scorched skin. He showed no\nemotion whatever.\n\n\"Tell me what happened,\" he commanded. \"All of it!\"\n\nSomehow, there seemed very little to tell, but Joe told it baldly as the\ncar sped on. The great half-ball of metal loomed larger and larger but\ndid not appear to grow nearer as Sally practiced first aid. They came to\na convoy of trucks, and the horn blared, and they turned out and passed\nit. Once they met a convoy of empty vehicles on the way back to\nBootstrap. They passed a bus. They went on.\n\nJoe finished drearily: \"The pilots did everything anybody could. Even\nchecked off the packages as they were dumped. We reported the one that\nblew up.\"\n\nMajor Holt said uncompromisingly: \"Those were orders. In a sense we've\ngained something even by this disaster. The pilots are probably right\nabout the plane's having been booby-trapped after its last overhaul, and\nthe traps armed later. I'll have an inspection made immediately, and\nwe'll see if we can find how it was done.\n\n\"There's the man you think armed the trap on this plane. An order for\nhis arrest is on the way now. I told my secretary. And--hm.... That\nCO_2----\"\n\n\"I didn't understand that,\" said Joe drearily.\n\n\"Planes have CO_2 bottles to put fires out,\" said the Major impatiently.\n\"A fire in flight lights a red warning light on the instrument panel,\ntelling where it is. The pilot pulls a handle, and CO_2 floods the\ncompartment, putting it out. And this ship was coming in for a crash\nlanding so the pilot--according to orders--flooded all compartments with\nCO_2. Only it wasn't.\"\n\nSally said in horror: \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"The CO_2 bottles were filled with an inflammable or an explosive gas,\"\nsaid her father, unbending. \"Instead of making a fire impossible, they\nmade it certain. We'll have to watch out for that trick now, too.\"\n\nJoe was too disheartened for any emotion except a bitter depression and\na much more bitter hatred of those who were ready to commit any\ncrime--and had committed most--in the attempt to destroy the Platform.\n\nThe Shed that housed it rose and rose against the skyline. It became\nhuge. It became monstrous. It became unbelievable. But Joe could have\nwept when the car pulled up at an angular, three-story building built\nout from the Shed's base. From the air, this substantial building had\nlooked like a mere chip. The car stopped. They got out. A sentry saluted\nas Major Holt led the way inside. Joe and Sally followed.\n\nThe Major said curtly to a uniformed man at a desk: \"Get some clothes\nfor this man. Get him a long-distance telephone connection to the\nKenmore Precision Tool Company. Let him talk. Then bring him to me\nagain.\"\n\nHe disappeared. Sally tried to smile at Joe. She was still quite pale.\n\n\"That's Dad, Joe. He means well, but he's not cordial. I was in his\noffice when the report of sabotage to your plane came through. We\nstarted for Bootstrap. We were on the way when we saw the first\nexplosion. I--thought it was your ship.\" She winced a little at the\nmemory. \"I knew you were on board. It was--not nice, Joe.\"\n\nShe'd been badly scared. Joe wanted to thump her encouragingly on the\nback, but he suddenly realized that that would no longer be appropriate.\nSo he said gruffly: \"I'm all right.\"\n\nHe followed the uniformed man. He began to get out of his scorched and\ntattered garments. The sergeant brought him more clothes, and he put\nthem on. He was just changing his personal possessions to the new\npockets when the sergeant came back again.\n\n\"Kenmore plant on the line, sir.\"\n\nJoe went to the phone. On the way he discovered that the banging around\nhe'd had when the plane landed had made a number of places on his body\nhurt.\n\nHe talked to his father.\n\nAfterward, he realized that it was a queer conversation. He felt guilty\nbecause something had happened to a job that had taken eight months to\ndo and that he alone was escorting to its destination. He told his\nfather about that. But his father didn't seem concerned. Not nearly so\nmuch concerned as he should have been. He asked urgent questions about\nJoe himself. If he was hurt. How much? Where? Joe was astonished that\nhis father seemed to think such matters more important than the pilot\ngyros. But he answered the questions and explained the exact situation\nand also a certain desperate hope he was trying to cherish that the\ngyros might still be repairable. His father gave him advice.\n\nSally was waiting again when he came out. She took him into her father's\noffice, and introduced him to her father's secretary. Compared to Sally\nshe was an extraordinarily plain woman. She wore a sorrowful expression.\nBut she looked very efficient.\n\nJoe explained carefully that his father said for him to hunt up Chief\nBender--working on the job out here--because he was one of the few men\nwho'd left the Kenmore plant to work elsewhere, and he was good. He and\nthe Chief, between them, would estimate the damage and the possibility\nof repair.\n\nMajor Holt listened. He was military and official and harassed and curt\nand tired. Joe'd known Sally and therefore her father all his life, but\nthe Major wasn't an easy man to be relaxed with. He spoke into thin air,\nand immediately his sad-seeming secretary wrote out a pass for Joe. Then\nMajor Holt gave crisp orders on a telephone and asked questions, and\nSally said: \"I know. I'll take him there. I know my way around.\"\n\nHer father's expression did not change. He simply included Sally in his\norders on the phone.\n\nHe hung up and said briefly: \"The plane will be surveyed and taken apart\nas soon as possible. By the time you find your man you can probably\nexamine the crates. I'll have you cleared for it.\"\n\nHis secretary reached in a drawer for order forms to fill out and hand\nhim to sign. Sally tugged at Joe's arm. They left.\n\nOutside, she said: \"There's no use arguing with my father, Joe. He has a\nterrible job, and it's on his mind all the time. He hates being a\nSecurity officer, too. It's a thankless job--and no Security officer\never gets to be more than a major. His ability never shows. What he does\nis never noticed unless it fails. So he's frustrated. He's got poor Miss\nRoss--his secretary, you know--so she just listens to what he says must\nbe done and she writes it out. Sometimes he goes days without speaking\nto her directly. But really it's pretty bad! It's like a war with no\nenemy to fight except spies! And the things they do! They've been known\neven to booby-trap a truck after an accident, so anybody who tries to\nhelp will be blown up! So everything has to be done in a certain way or\neverything will be ruined!\"\n\nShe led him to an office with a door that opened directly into the Shed.\nIn spite of his bitterness, Joe was morosely impatient to see inside.\nBut Sally had to identify him formally as the Joe Kenmore who was the\nsubject of her father's order, and his fingerprints had to be taken, and\nsomebody had him stand for a moment before an X-ray screen. Then she led\nhim through the door, and he was in the Shed where the Space Platform\nwas under construction.\n\nIt was a vast cavern of metal sheathing and spidery girders, filled with\nsound and detail. It took him seconds to begin to absorb what he saw and\nheard. The Shed was five hundred feet high in the middle, and it was all\nclear space without a single column or interruption. There were arc\nlamps burning about its edges, and high up somewhere there were strips\nof glass which let in a pale light. All of it resounded with many noises\nand clanging echoes of them.\n\nThere were rivet guns at work, and there were the grumblings of motor\ntrucks moving about, and the oddly harsh roar of welding torches. But\nthe torch flames looked only like marsh fires, blue-white and eerie\nagainst the mass of the thing that was being built.\n\nIt was not too clear to the eye, this incomplete Space Platform. There\nseemed to be a sort of mist, a glamour about it, which was partly a\nveiling mass of scaffolding. But Joe gazed at it with an emotion that\nblotted out even his aching disappointment and feeling of shame.\n\nIt was gigantic. It had the dimensions of an ocean liner. It was\nstrangely shaped. Partly obscured by the fragile-seeming framework about\nit, there was bright plating in swelling curves, and the plating reached\nup irregularly and followed a peculiar pattern, and above the plating\nthere were girders--themselves shining brightly in the light of many arc\nlamps--and they rose up and up toward the roof of the Shed itself. The\nPlatform was ungainly and it was huge, and it rested under a hollow\nmetal half-globe that could have doubled for a sky. It was more than\nthree hundred feet high, itself, and there were men working on the bare\nbright beams of its uppermost parts--and the men were specks. The far\nside of the Shed's floor had other men on it, and they were merely\njerkily moving motes. You couldn't see their legs as they walked. The\nShed and the Platform were monstrous!\n\nJoe felt Sally's eyes upon him. Somehow, they looked proud. He took a\ndeep breath.\n\nShe said: \"Come on.\"\n\nThey walked across acres of floor neatly paved with shining wooden\nblocks. They moved toward the thing that was to take mankind's first\nstep toward the stars. As they walked centerward, a big sixteen-wheel\ntruck-and-trailer outfit backed out of an opening under the lacy haze of\nscaffolds. It turned clumsily, and carefully circled the scaffolding,\nand moved toward a sidewall of the Shed. A section of the wall--it\nseemed as small as a rabbit hole--lifted inward like a flap, and the\nsixteen-wheeler trundled out into the blazing sunlight. Four other\ntrucks scurried out after it. Other trucks came in. The sidewall section\nclosed.\n\nThere was the smell of engine fumes and hot metal and of ozone from\nelectric sparks. There was that indescribable smell a man can get\nhomesick for, of metal being worked by men. Joe walked like someone in a\ndream, with Sally satisfiedly silent beside him, until the\nscaffolds--which had looked like veiling--became latticework and he saw\nopenings.\n\nThey walked into one such tunnel. The bulk of the Platform above them\nloomed overhead with a crushing menace. There were trucks rumbling all\naround underneath, here in this maze of scaffold columns. Some carried\nready-loaded cages waiting to be snatched up by hoists. Crane grips came\ndown, and snapped fast on the cages, and lifted them up and up and out\nof sight. There was a Diesel running somewhere, and a man stood and\nstared skyward and made motions with his hands, and the Diesel adjusted\nits running to his signals. Then some empty cages came down and landed\nin a waiting truck body with loud clanking noises. Somebody cast off the\nhooks, and the truck grumbled and drove away.\n\nSally spoke to a preoccupied man in shirt sleeves with a badge on an arm\nband near his shoulder. He looked carefully at the passes she carried,\nusing a flashlight to make sure. Then he led them to a shaft up which a\nhoist ran. It was very noisy here. A rivet gun banged away overhead, and\nthe plates of the Platform rang with the sound, and the echoes\nscreeched, and to Joe the bedlam was infinitely good to hear. The man\nwith the arm band shouted into a telephone transmitter, and a hoist cage\ncame down. Joe and Sally stepped on it. Joe took a firm grip on her\nshoulder, and the hoist shot upward.\n\nThe hugeness of the Shed and the Platform grew even more apparent as the\nhoist accelerated toward the roof. The flooring seemed to expand.\nSpidery scaffold beams dropped past them. There were things being built\nover by the sidewall. Joe saw a crawling in-plant tow truck moving past\nthose enigmatic objects. It was a tiny truck, no more than four feet\nhigh and with twelve-inch wheels. It dragged behind it flat plates of\nmetal with upturned forward edges. They slid over the floor like\nsledges. Cryptic loads were carried on those plates, and the tow truck\nstopped by a mass of steel piping being put together, and began to\nunload the plates.\n\nThen the hoist slowed abruptly and Sally winced a little. The hoist\nstopped.\n\nHere--two hundred feet up--a welding crew worked on the skin of the\nPlatform itself. The plating curved in and there was a wide flat space\nparallel to the ground. There was also a great gaping hole beyond.\nThough girders rose roofward even yet, this was as high as the plating\nhad gone. That opening--Joe guessed--would ultimately be the door of an\nair lock, and this flat surface was designed for a tender rocket to\nanchor to by magnets. When a rocket came up from Earth with supplies or\nreliefs for the Platform's crew, or with fuel to be stored for an\nexploring ship's later use, it would anchor here and then inch toward\nthat doorway....\n\nThere were half a dozen men in the welding crew. They should have been\nworking. But two men battered savagely at each other, their tools thrown\ndown. One was tall and lean, with a wrinkled face and an expression of\nintolerable fury. The other was squat and dark with a look of\ndesperation. A third man was in the act of putting down his welding\ntorch--he'd carefully turned it off first--to try to interfere. Another\nman gaped. Still another was climbing up by a ladder from the scaffold\nlevel below.\n\nJoe put Sally's hand on the hoist upright, instinctively freeing himself\nfor action.\n\nThe lanky man lashed out a terrific roundhouse blow. It landed, but the\nstocky man bored in. Joe had an instant's clear sight of his face. It\nwas not the face of a man enraged. It had the look of a man both\ndesperate and despairing.\n\nThen the lanky man's foot slipped. He lost balance, and the stocky man's\nfist landed. The thin man reeled backward. Sally cried out, choking. The\nlanky man teetered on the edge of the flat place. Behind him, the\nplating curved down. Below him there were two hundred feet of fall\nthrough the steel-pipe maze of scaffolds. If he took one step back he\nwas gone inexorably down a slope on which he could never stop.\n\nHe took that step. The stocky man's face abruptly froze in horror. The\nlanky man stiffened convulsively. He couldn't stop. He knew it. He'd go\nback and on over the rounded edge, and fall. He might touch the\nscaffolding. It would not stop him. It would merely set his body\nspinning crazily as it dropped and crashed again and again before it\nlanded two hundred feet below.\n\nIt was horror in slow motion, watching the lean man stagger backward to\nhis death.\n\nThen Joe leaped.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nFor an instant, in mid-air, Joe was incongruously aware of all the\nnoises in the Shed. The murky, girdered ceiling still three hundred feet\nabove him. The swelling, curving, glittering surface of steel\nunderneath. Then he struck. He landed beside the lean man, with his left\narm outstretched to share his impetus with him. Alone, he would have had\nmomentum enough to carry himself up the slope down which the man had\nbegun to descend. But now he shared it. The two of them toppled forward\ntogether. Their arms were upon the flat surface, while their bodies\ndangled. The feel of gravity pulling them slantwise and downward was\npurest nightmare.\n\nBut then, as Joe's innards crawled, the same stocky man who had knocked\nthe lean man back was dragging frantically at both of them to pull them\nto safety.\n\nThen there were two men pulling. The stocky man's face was gray. His\nhorror was proof that he hadn't intended murder. The man who'd put down\nhis welding torch pulled. The man who'd been climbing the ladder put his\nweight to the task of getting them back to usable footing. They reached\nsafety. Joe scrambled to his feet, but he felt sick at the pit of his\nstomach. The stocky man began to shake horribly. The lanky one advanced\nfuriously upon him.\n\n\"I didn' mean to keel you, Haney!\" the dark one panted.\n\nThe lanky one snapped: \"Okay. You didn't. But come on, now! We finish\nthis----\"\n\nHe advanced toward the workman who had so nearly caused his death. But\nthe other man dropped his arms to his sides.\n\n\"I don' fight no more,\" he said thickly. \"Not here. You keel me is okay.\nI don' fight.\"\n\nThe lanky man--Haney--growled at him.\n\n\"Tonight, then, in Bootstrap. Now get back to work!\"\n\nThe stocky man picked up his tools. He was trembling.\n\nHaney turned to Joe and said ungraciously: \"Much obliged. What's up?\"\n\nJoe still felt queasy. There is rarely any high elation after one has\nrisked his life for somebody else. He'd nearly plunged two hundred feet\nto the floor of the Shed with Haney. But he swallowed.\n\n\"I'm looking for Chief Bender. You're Haney? Foreman?\"\n\n\"Gang boss,\" said Haney. He looked at Joe and then at Sally who was\nholding convulsively to the upright Joe had put her hand on. Her eyes\nwere closed. \"Yeah,\" said Haney. \"The Chief took off today. Some kind of\nInjun stuff. Funeral, maybe. Want me to tell him something? I'll see him\nwhen I go off shift.\"\n\nThere was an obscure movement somewhere on this part of the Platform. A\ntiny figure came out of a crevice that would someday be an air lock. Joe\ndidn't move his eyes toward it. He said awkwardly: \"Just tell him Joe\nKenmore's in town and needs him. He'll remember me, I think. I'll hunt\nhim up tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Haney.\n\nJoe's eyes went to the tiny figure that had come out from behind the\nplating. It was a midget in baggy, stained work garments like the rest\nof the men up here. He wore a miniature welding shield pushed back on\nhis head. Joe could guess his function, of course. There'd be corners a\nnormal-sized man couldn't get into, to buck a rivet or weld a joint.\nThere'd be places only a tiny man could properly inspect. The midget\nregarded Joe without expression.\n\nJoe turned to the hoist to go down to the floor again. Haney waved his\nhand. The midget lifted his, in grave salutation.\n\nThe hoist dropped down the shaft. Sally opened her eyes.\n\n\"You--saved that man's life, Joe,\" she said unsteadily. \"But you scared\nme to death!\"\n\nJoe tried to ignore the remark, but he still seemed to feel slanting\nmetal under him and a drop of two hundred feet below. It had been a\nnightmarish sensation.\n\n\"I didn't think,\" he said uncomfortably. \"It was a crazy thing to do.\nLucky it worked out.\"\n\nSally glanced at him. The hoist still dropped swiftly. Levels of\nscaffolding shot upward past them. If Joe had slipped down that rolling\ncurve of metal, he'd have dropped past all these. It was not good to\nthink about. He swallowed again. Then the hoist checked in its descent.\nIt stopped. Joe somewhat absurdly helped Sally off to solid ground.\n\n\"It--looks to me,\" said Sally, \"as if you're bound to make me see\nsomebody killed. Joe, would you mind leading a little bit less\nadventurous life for a while? While I'm around?\"\n\nHe managed to grin. But he still did not feel right.\n\n\"Nothing I can do until I can look at the plane,\" he said, changing the\nsubject, \"and I can't find the Chief until tonight. Could we sightsee a\nlittle?\"\n\nShe nodded. They went out from under the intricate framework that upheld\nthe Platform. They went, in fact, completely under that colossal\nincomplete object. Sally indicated the sidewall.\n\n\"Let's go look at the pushpots. They're fascinating!\"\n\nShe led the way. The enormous spaciousness of the Shed again became\nevident. There was a catwalk part way up the inward curving wall.\nSomeone leaned on its railing and surveyed the interior of the Shed. He\nwould probably be a security man. Maybe the fist fight up on the\nPlatform had been seen, or maybe not. The man on the catwalk was hardly\nmore than a speck, and it occurred to Joe that there must be other\nwatchers' posts high up on the outer shell where men could search the\nsunlit desert outside for signs of danger.\n\nBut he turned and looked yearningly back at the monstrous thing under\nthe mist of scaffolding. For the first time he could make out its shape.\nIt was something like an egg, but a great deal more like something he\ncouldn't put a name to. Actually it was exactly like nothing in the\nworld but itself, and when it was out in space there would be nothing\nleft on Earth like it.\n\nIt would be in a fashion a world in itself, independent of the Earth\nthat made it. There would be hydroponic tanks in which plants would grow\nto purify its air and feed its crew. There would be telescopes with\nwhich men would be able to study the stars as they had never been able\nto do from the bottom of Earth's ocean of turbulent air. But it would\nserve Earth.\n\nThere would be communicators. They would pick up microwave messages and\nretransmit them to destinations far around the curve of the planet, or\nelse store them and retransmit them to the other side of the world an\nhour or two hours later.\n\nIt would store fuel with which men could presently set out for the\nstars--and out to emptiness for nuclear experiments that must not be\nmade on Earth. And finally it would be armed with squat, deadly atomic\nmissiles that no nation could possibly defy. And so this Space Platform\nwould keep peace on Earth.\n\nBut it could not make good will among men.\n\nSally walked on. They reached the mysterious objects being manufactured\nin a row around half the sidewall of the Shed. They were of simple\ndesign and, by comparison, not unduly large. The first objects were\nmerely frameworks of metal pipe, which men were welding together\nunbreakably. They were no bigger than--say--half of a six-room house. A\nlittle way on, these were filled with intricate arrays of tanks and\npiping, and still farther--there was a truck and hoist unloading a\nmassive object into place right now--there were huge engines fitting\nprecisely into openings designed to hold them. Others were being plated\nin with metallic skins.\n\nAt the very end of this assembly line a crane was loading a finished\nobject onto a flat-bed trailer. As it swung in the air, Joe realized\nwhat it was. It might be called a jet plane, but it was not of any type\never before used. More than anything else, it looked like a beetle. It\nwould not be really useful for anything but its function at the end of\nOperation Stepladder. Then hundreds of these ungainly objects would\ncluster upon the Platform's sides, like swarming bees. They would thrust\nsavagely up with their separate jet engines. They would lift the\nPlatform from the foundation on which it had been built. Tugging,\nstraining, panting, they would get it out of the Shed. But their work\nwould not end there. Holding it aloft, they would start it eastward,\nlifting effortfully. They would carry it as far and as high and as fast\nas their straining engines could work. Then there would be one last\nsurge of fierce thrusting with oversize jato rockets, built separately\ninto each pushpot, all firing at once.\n\nFinally the clumsy things would drop off and come bumbling back home,\nwhile the Platform's own rockets flared out their mile-long flames--and\nit headed up for emptiness.\n\nBut the making of these pushpots and all the other multitudinous\nactivities of the Shed would have no meaning if the contents of four\ncrates in the wreckage of a burned-out plane could not be salvaged and\nput to use again.\n\nJoe said restlessly: \"I want to see all this, Sally, and maybe anything\nelse I do is useless, but I've got to find out what happened to the\ngyros I was bringing here!\"\n\nSally said nothing. She turned, and they moved across the long, long\nspace of wood-block flooring toward the doorway by which they had\nentered. And now that he had seen the Space Platform, all of Joe's\nfeeling of guilt and despondency came back. It seemed unbearable. They\nwent out through the guarded door, Sally surrendered the pass, and Joe\nwas again checked carefully before he was free to go.\n\nThen Sally said: \"You don't want me tagging around, do you?\"\n\nJoe said honestly: \"It isn't exactly that, Sally, but if the stuff is\nreally smashed, I'd--rather not have anybody see me. Please don't be\nangry, but--\"\n\nSally said quietly: \"I know. I'll get somebody to drive you over.\"\n\nShe vanished. She came back with the uniformed man who'd driven Major\nHolt. She put her hand momentarily on Joe's arm.\n\n\"If it's really bad, Joe, tell me. You won't let yourself cry, but I'll\ncry for you.\" She searched his eyes. \"Really, Joe!\"\n\nHe grinned feebly and went out to the car.\n\nThe feeling on the way to the airfield was not a good one. It was\ntwenty-odd miles from the Shed, but Joe dreaded what he was going to\nsee. The black car burned up the road. It turned to the right off the\nwhite highway, onto the curved short cut--and there was the field.\n\nAnd there was the wreck of the transport plane, still where it had\ncrashed and burned. There were still armed guards about it, but men were\nworking on the wreck, cutting it apart with torches. Already some of it\nwas dissected.\n\nJoe went to the remains of the four crates.\n\nThe largest was bent askew by the force of the crash or an explosion,\nJoe didn't know which. The smallest was a twisted mass of charcoal. Joe\ngulped, and dug into them with borrowed tools.\n\nThe pilot gyros of the Space Platform would apply the torque that would\nmake the main gyros shift it to any desired position, or else hold it\nabsolutely still. They were to act, in a sense, as a sort of steering\nengine on the take-off and keep a useful function out in space. If a\nstar photograph was to be made, it was essential that the Platform hold\nabsolutely still while the exposure lasted. If a guided missile was to\nbe launched, it must be started right, and the pilot gyros were needed.\nTo turn to receive an arriving rocket from Earth....\n\nThe pilot gyros were the steering apparatus of the Space Platform. They\nhad to be more than adequate. They had to be perfect! On the take-off\nalone, they were starkly necessary. The Platform couldn't hope to reach\nits orbit without them.\n\nJoe chipped away charred planks. He pulled off flame-eaten timbers. He\npeeled off carbonized wrappings--but some did not need to be peeled:\nthey crumbled at a touch--and in twenty minutes he knew the whole story.\nThe rotor motors were ruined. The couplers--pilot-to-main-gyro\nconnections--had been heated red hot and were no longer hardened steel;\ntheir dimensions had changed and they would no longer fit. But these\nwere not disastrous items. They were serious, but not tragic.\n\nThe tragedy was the gyros themselves. On their absolute precision and\nutterly perfect balance the whole working of the Platform would depend.\nAnd the rotors were gashed in one place, and the shafts were bent. Being\nbent and nicked, the precision of the apparatus was destroyed. Its\nprecision lost, the whole device was useless. And it had taken four\nmonths' work merely to get it perfectly balanced!\n\nIt had been the most accurate piece of machine work ever done on Earth.\nIt was balanced to a microgram--to a millionth of the combined weight of\nthree aspirin tablets. It would revolve at 40,000 revolutions per\nminute. It had to balance perfectly or it would vibrate intolerably. If\nit vibrated at all it would shake itself to pieces, or, failing that,\nsend aging sound waves through all the Platform's substance. If it\nvibrated by the least fraction of a ten-thousandth of an inch, it would\nwear, and vibrate more strongly, and destroy itself and possibly the\nPlatform. It needed the precision of an astronomical telescope's\nlenses--multiplied! And it was bent. It was exactly as useless as if it\nhad never been made at all.\n\nJoe felt as a man might feel if the mirror of the greatest telescope on\nearth, in his care, had been smashed. As if the most priceless picture\nin the world, in his charge, had been burned. But he felt worse. Whether\nit was his fault or not--and it wasn't--it was destroyed.\n\nA truck rolled up and was stopped by a guard. There was talk, and the\nguard let it through. A small crane lift came over from the hangars. Its\nnormal use was the lifting of plane motors in and out of their nacelles.\nNow it was to pick up the useless pieces of equipment on which the best\nworkmen and the best brains of the Kenmore Precision Tool Company had\nworked unceasingly for eight calendar months, and which now was junk.\n\nJoe watched, numbed by disaster, while the crane hook went down to\nposition above the once-precious objects. Men shored up the heavy things\nand ran planks under them, and then deftly fitted rope slings for them\nto be lifted by. It was late afternoon by now. Long shadows were\nslanting as the crane truck's gears whined, and the slack took up, and\nthe first of the four charred objects lifted and swung, spinning slowly,\nto the truck that had come from the Shed.\n\nJoe froze, watching. He watched the second. The third did not spin. It\nmerely swayed. But the fourth.... The lines up to the crane hook were\ntwisted. As the largest of the four crates lifted from its bed, it\ntwisted the lines toward straightness. It spun. It spun more and more\nrapidly, and then more and more slowly, and stopped, and began to spin\nback.\n\nThen Joe caught his breath. It seemed that he hadn't breathed in\nminutes. The big crate wasn't balanced. It was spinning. It wasn't\nvibrating. It spun around its own center of gravity, unerringly revealed\nby its flexible suspension.\n\nHe watched until it was dropped into the truck. Then he went stiffly\nover to the driver of the car that had brought him.\n\n\"Everything's all right,\" he said, feeling a queer astonishment at his\nown words. \"I'm going to ride back to the Shed with the stuff I brought.\nIt's not hurt too much. I'll be able to fix it with a man or two I can\npick up out here. But I don't want anything else to happen to it!\"\n\nSo he rode back out to the Shed on the tailboard of the truck that\ncarried the crates. The sun set as he rode. He was smudged and\ndisheveled. The reek of charred wood and burnt insulation and scorched\nwrappings was strong in his nostrils. But he felt very much inclined to\nsing.\n\nIt occurred to Joe that he should have sent Sally a message that she\ndidn't need to cry as a substitute for him. He felt swell! He knew how\nto do the job that would let the Space Platform take off! He'd tell her,\nfirst chance.\n\nIt was very good to be alive.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nThere was nobody in the world to whom the Space Platform was\nmeaningless. To Joe and a great many people like him, it was a dream\nlong and stubbornly held to and now doggedly being made a reality. To\nsome it was the prospect of peace and the hope of a quiet life: children\nand grandchildren and a serene look forward to the future. Some people\nprayed yearningly for its success, though they could have no other share\nin its making. And of course there were those men who had gotten into\npower and could not stay there without ruthlessness. They knew what the\nPlatform would mean to their kind. For, once world peace was certain,\nthey would be killed by the people they ruled over. So they sent grubby,\ndesperate men to wreck it at any cost. They were prepared to pay for or\nto commit any crime if the Space Platform could be smashed and turmoil\nkept as the norm of life on Earth.\n\nAnd there were the people who were actually doing the building.\n\nJoe rode a bus into Bootstrap that night with some of them. The middle\nshift--two to ten o'clock--was off. Fleets of busses rolled out from the\nsmall town twenty miles away, their headlights making a procession of\npaired flames in the darkness. They rolled into the unloading area and\ndisgorged the late shift--ten to six--to be processed by security and\nadmitted to the Shed. Then, quite empty, the busses went trundling\naround to where Joe waited with the released shift milling around him.\n\nThe busses stopped and opened their doors. The waiting men stormed in,\nshoving zestfully, calling to each other, scrambling for seats or merely\nletting themselves be pushed on board. The bus Joe found himself on was\njammed in seconds. He held on to a strap and didn't notice. He was\nabsorbed in the rapt contemplation of his idea for the repair of the\npilot gyros. The motors could be replaced easily enough. The foundation\nof his first despair had been the belief that everything could be\nmanaged but one thing; that the all-important absolute accuracy was the\nonly thing that couldn't be achieved. Getting that accuracy, back at the\nplant, had consumed four months of time. Each of the gyros was four feet\nin diameter and weighed five hundred pounds. Each spun at 40,000 r.p.m.\nIt had to be machined from a special steel to assure that it would not\nfly to pieces from sheer centrifugal force. Each was plated with iridium\nlest a speck of rust form and throw it off balance. If the shaft and\nbearings were not centered exactly at the center of gravity of the\nrotors--five hundred pounds of steel off balance at 40,000 r.p.m. could\nraise the devil. They could literally wreck the Platform itself. And\n\"exactly at the center of gravity\" meant exactly. There could be no\nerror by which the shaft was off center by the thousandth of an inch, or\na ten-thousandth, or even the tenth of a ten-thousandth. The accuracy\nhad to be absolute.\n\nGloating over the solution he'd found, Joe could have hugged himself.\nHanging to a strap in the waiting bus, he saw another bus start off with\na grinding of gears and a spouting of exhaust smoke. It trundled to the\nhighway and rolled away. Another and another followed it. Joe's bus fell\nin line. They headed for Bootstrap in a convoy, a long, long string of\nlighted vehicles running one behind the other.\n\nIt was dark outside. The Shed was alone, for security. It was twenty\nmiles from the town where its work force slept and ate and made merry.\nThat was security too. One shift came off, and went through a security\ncheck, and during that time the Shed was empty save for the security\nofficers who roamed it endlessly, looking for trouble. Sometimes they\nfound it. The shift coming on also passed through a security check.\nNobody could get into the Shed without being identified past question.\nThe picture-badge stage was long since passed on the Space Platform job.\nSecurity was tight!\n\nThe long procession of busses rolled through the night. Outside was dark\ndesert. Overhead were many stars. Inside the jammed bus were swaying\nfigures crowded in the aisle, and every seat was filled. There was the\nsmell of sweat, and oil, and tobacco. Somebody still had garlic on his\nbreath from lunch. There was the noise of many voices. There was an\nargument two seats up the aisle. There was the rumble of the motor, and\nthe peculiar whine of spinning tires. Men had to raise their voices to\nbe heard above the din.\n\nA swaying among the crowded figures more pronounced than that caused by\nthe motion of the bus caught Joe's eye. Somebody was crowding his way\nfrom the back toward the front. The aisle was narrow. Joe clung to his\nstrap, thinking hard and happily about the rebalancing of the gyros.\nThere could be no tolerance. It had to be exact. There had to be no\nvibration at all....\n\nFigures swayed away from him. A hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Hiya.\"\n\nHe swung around. It was the lean man, Haney, whom he'd kept from being\nknocked off the level place two hundred feet up.\n\nJoe said: \"Hello.\"\n\n\"I thought you were big brass,\" said Haney, rumbling in his ear. \"But\nbig brass don't ride the busses.\"\n\n\"I'm going in to try to hunt up the Chief,\" said Joe.\n\nHaney grunted. He looked estimatingly at Joe. His glance fell to Joe's\nhands. Joe had been digging further into the crates, and afterward he'd\nwashed up, but packing grease is hard to get off. When mixed with soot\nand charcoal it leaves signs. Haney relaxed.\n\n\"We mostly eat together,\" he observed, satisfied that Joe was regular\nbecause his hands weren't soft and because mechanic's soap had done an\nincomplete job on them. \"The Chief's a good guy. Join us?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Joe. \"And thanks.\"\n\nA brittle voice sounded somewhere around Haney's knees. Joe looked down,\nstartled. The midget he'd seen up on the Platform nodded up at him. He'd\nsquirmed through the press in Haney's wake. He seemed to bristle a\nlittle out of pure habit. Joe made room for him.\n\n\"I'm okay,\" said the midget pugnaciously.\n\nHaney made a formal introduction.\n\n\"Mike Scandia.\" He thumbed at Joe. \"Joe Kenmore. He's eating with us.\nWants to find the Chief.\"\n\nThere had been no reference to the risk Joe had run in keeping Haney\nfrom a two-hundred-foot fall. But now Haney said approvingly: \"I wanted\nto say thanks anyhow for keeping your mouth shut. New here?\"\n\nJoe nodded. The noise in the bus made any sort of talk difficult. Haney\nappeared used to it.\n\n\"Saw you with--uh--Major Holt's daughter,\" he observed again. \"That's\nwhy I thought you were brass. Figured one or the other'd tell on Braun.\nYou didn't, or somebody'd've raised Cain. But I'll handle it.\"\n\nBraun would be the man Haney had been fighting. If Haney wanted to\nhandle it his way, it was naturally none of Joe's business. He said\nnothing.\n\n\"Braun's a good guy,\" said Haney. \"Crazy, that's all. He picked that\nfight. Picked it! Up there! Coulda been him knocked off--and I'd ha'\nbeen in a mess! I'll see him tonight.\"\n\nThe midget said something biting in his peculiarly cracked and brittle\nvoice.\n\nThe bus rolled and rolled and rolled. It was a long twenty miles to\nBootstrap. The desert outside the bus windows was utterly black and\nfeatureless, but once a convoy of trucks passed, going to the Shed.\n\nPresently, though, lights twinkled in the night. Again the bus slowed,\nin column with the others. Then there were barrackslike buildings,\nsucceeding each other, and then there was a corner and suddenly the\noutside was ablaze with light. The busses drew up to the curb and\nstopped, and everybody was immediately in a great hurry to get out,\nshoving unnecessarily, and Joe let himself be carried along by the\ncrowd.\n\nHe found himself on the sidewalk with bright neon signs up and down the\nstreet. He was in the midst of the crowd which was the middle shift\nreleased. It eddied and dispersed without seeming to lessen. Most of the\nfigures in sight were men. There were very, very few women. The neon\nsigns proclaimed that here one could buy beer, and that this was Fred's\nPlace, and that was Sid's Steak Joint. Bowling. Pool. A store--still\nopen for this shift's trade--sold fancy shirts and strictly practical\nwork clothes and highly eccentric items of personal adornment. A movie\nhouse. A second. A third. Somewhere a record shop fed repetitious music\nto the night air. There was movement and crowding and jostling, but the\nmiddle of the street was almost empty save for the busses. There were\nsome bicycles, but practically no other wheeled traffic. After all,\nBootstrap was strictly a security town. A man could leave whenever he\nchose, but there were formalities, and personal cars weren't practical.\n\n\"Chief'll be yonder,\" said Haney in Joe's ear. \"Come along.\"\n\nThey shouldered their way along the sidewalk. The passers-by were of a\ntype--construction men. Somebody here had taken part in the building of\nevery skyscraper and bridge and dam put up in Joe's lifetime. They could\nhave been kept away from the Space Platform job only by a flat refusal\nby security to let them be hired.\n\nHaney and Joe moved toward Sid's Steak Joint, with Mike the midget\nmarching truculently between them. Men nodded to them as they passed.\nJoe marshaled in his mind what he was going to tell the Chief. He had a\ntrick for fixing the pilot gyros. A speck of rust would spoil them, and\nthey had been through a plane crash and a fire and explosions, but his\ntrick would do, in ten days or less, what the plant back home had needed\nfour months to accomplish. The trick was something to gloat over.\n\nInto Sid's Steak Joint. A juke box was playing. Over in a booth, four\nmen ate hungrily, with a slot TV machine in the wall beside them showing\nwrestling matches out in San Francisco. A waiter carried a huge tray\nfrom which steam and fragrant odors arose.\n\nThere was the Chief, dark and saturnine to look at, with his straight\nblack hair gleaming in the light. He was a Mohawk, and he and his tribe\nhad taken to steel construction work a long time back. They were good.\nThere were not many big construction jobs on which the Chief's tribesmen\nwere not to be found working. Forty of them had died together in the\nworst construction accident in history, when a bridge on its way to\ncompletion collapsed in the making, but there were a dozen or more at\nwork on the Space Platform now. The Chief had essayed machine-tool work\nat the Kenmore plant, and he'd been good. He'd pitched on the plant\nbaseball team, and he'd sung bass in the church choir, but there had\nbeen nobody else around who talked Indian, and he'd gotten lonely. At\nthat, though, he'd left because the Space Platform began and wild horses\ncouldn't have kept him away from a job like that!\n\nHe'd held a table for Haney and Mike, but his eyes widened when he saw\nJoe. Then he grinned and almost upset the table to stand up and greet\nhim.\n\n\"Son-of-a-gun!\" he said warmly. \"What you doin' here?\"\n\n\"Right now,\" said Joe. \"I'm looking for you. I've got a job for you.\"\n\nThe Chief, still grinning, shook his head.\n\n\"Not me, I'm here till the Platform's done.\"\n\n\"It's on the job,\" said Joe. \"I've got to get a crew together to repair\nsomething I brought out here today and that got smashed in the landing.\"\n\nThe four of them sat down. Mike's chin was barely above the table top.\nThe Chief waved to a waiter. \"Steaks all around!\" he bellowed. Then he\nbent toward Joe. \"Shoot it!\"\n\nJoe told his story. Concisely. The pilot gyros, which had to be perfect,\nhad been especially gunned at by saboteurs. An attack with possibly\nstolen proximity-fused rockets. The plane was booby-trapped, and\nsomebody at an airfield had had a chance to spring the trap. So it was\nwreckage. Crashed and burned on landing.\n\nThe Chief growled. Haney pressed his lips together. The eyes of Mike\nwere burning.\n\n\"Plenty of that sabotage stuff,\" growled the Chief. \"Hard to catch the\nso-and-sos. Smash the gyros and the take-off'd have to wait till new\nones got made--and that's more time for more sabotage.\"\n\nJoe said carefully: \"I think it can be licked. Listen a minute, will\nyou?\"\n\nThe Chief fixed his eyes upon him.\n\n\"The gyros have to be rebalanced,\" said Joe. \"They have to spin on their\nown center of gravity. At the plant, they set them up, spun them, and\nfound which side was heavy. They took metal off till it ran smoothly at\nfive hundred r.p.m. Then they spun it at a thousand. It vibrated. They\nfound imbalance that was too small to show up before. They fixed that.\nThey speeded it up. And so on. They tried to make the center of gravity\nthe center of the shaft by trimming off the weight that put the center\nof gravity somewhere else. Right?\"\n\nThe Chief said irritably: \"No other way to do it! No other way!\"\n\n\"I saw one,\" said Joe. \"When they cleaned up the wreck at the airfield,\nthey heaved up the crates with a crane. The slings were twisted. Every\ncrate spun as it rose. But not one wobbled! They found their own centers\nof gravity and spun around them!\"\n\nThe Chief scowled, deep in thought. Then his face went blank.\n\n\"By the holy mud turtle!\" he grunted. \"I get it!\"\n\nJoe said, with very great pains not to seem triumphant, \"Instead of\nspinning the shaft and trimming the rotor, we'll spin the rotor and trim\nthe shaft. We'll form the shaft around the center of gravity, instead of\ntrying to move the center of gravity to the middle of the shaft. We'll\nspin the rotors on a flexible bearing base. I think it'll work.\"\n\nSurprisingly, it was Mike the midget who said warmly, \"You got it! Yes,\nsir, you got it!\"\n\nThe Chief took a deep breath. \"Yeah! And d'you know how I know? The\nPlant built a high-speed centrifuge once. Remember?\" He grinned with the\ntriumph Joe concealed. \"It was just a plate with a shaft in the middle.\nThere were vanes on the plate. It fitted in a shaft hole that was much\ntoo big. They blew compressed air up the shaft hole. It floated the\nplate up, the air hit the vanes and spun the plate--and it ran as sweet\nas honey! Balanced itself and didn't wobble a bit! We'll do something\nlike that! Sure!\"\n\n\"Will you work on it with me?\" asked Joe. \"We'll need a sort of\ncrew--three or four altogether. Have to figure out the stuff we need. I\ncan ask for anybody I want. I'm asking for you. You pick the others.\"\n\nThe Chief grinned broadly. \"Any objections, Haney? You and Mike and me\nand Joe here? Look!\"\n\nHe pulled a pencil out of his pocket. He started to draw on the plastic\ntable top, and then took a paper napkin instead.\n\n\"Something like this----\"\n\nThe steaks came, sizzling on the platters they'd been cooked in. The\noutside was seared, and the inside was hot and deliciously rare.\nIntellectual exercises like the designing of a machine-tool operation\ncould not compete with such aromas and sights and sounds. The four of\nthem fell to.\n\nBut they talked as they ate. Absorbed and often with their mouths full,\nfrequently with imperfect articulation, but with deepening satisfaction\nas the steaks vanished and the method they'd use took form in their\nminds. It wouldn't be wholly simple, of course. When the rotors were\nspinning about their centers of gravity, trimming off the shaft would\nchange the center of gravity. But the change would be infinitely less\nthan trimming off the rotors' rims. If they spun the rotors and used an\nabrasive on the high side of the shaft as it turned....\n\n\"Going to have precession!\" warned Mike. \"Have to have a polishing\nsurface. Quarter turn behind the cutter. That'll hold it.\"\n\nJoe only remembered afterward to be astonished that Mike would know gyro\ntheory. At the moment he merely swallowed quickly to get the words out.\n\n\"Right! And if we cut too far down we can plate the bearing up to\nthickness and cut it down again----\"\n\n\"Plate it up with iridium,\" said the Chief. He waved a steak knife.\n\"Man! This is gonna be fun! No tolerance you say, Joe?\"\n\n\"No tolerance,\" agreed Joe. \"Accurate within the limits of measurement.\"\n\nThe Chief beamed. The Platform was a challenge to all of humanity. The\npilot gyro was essential to the functioning of the Platform. To provide\nthat necessity against impossible obstacles was a challenge to the four\nwho were undertaking it.\n\n\"Some fun!\" repeated the Chief, blissfully.\n\nThey ate their steaks, talking. They consumed huge slabs of apple pie\nwith preposterous mounds of ice cream on top, still talking urgently.\nThey drank coffee, interrupting each other to draw diagrams. They used\nup all the paper napkins, and were still at it when someone came heavily\ntoward the table. It was the stocky man who had fought with Haney on the\nPlatform that day. Braun.\n\nHe tapped Haney on the shoulder. The four at the table looked up.\n\n\"We hadda fight today,\" said Braun in a queer voice. He was oddly pale.\n\"We didn't finish. You wanna finish?\"\n\nHaney growled.\n\n\"That was a fool business,\" he said angrily. \"That ain't any place to\nfight, up on the job! You know it!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Braun in the same odd voice. \"You wanna finish it now?\"\n\nHaney said formidably: \"I'm not dodgin' any fight. I didn't dodge it\nthen. I'm not dodgin' it now. You picked it. It was crazy! But if you\ngot over the craziness----\"\n\nBraun smiled a remarkably peculiar smile. \"I'm still crazy. We finish,\nhuh?\"\n\nHaney pushed back his chair and stood up grimly. \"Okay, we finish it!\nYou coulda killed me. I coulda killed you too, with that fall ready for\neither of us.\"\n\n\"Sure! Too bad nobody got killed,\" said Braun.\n\n\"You fellas wait,\" said Haney angrily to Joe and the rest. \"There's a\nstoreroom out back. Sid'll let us use it.\"\n\nBut the Chief pushed back his chair.\n\n\"Uh-uh,\" he said, shaking his head. \"We're watchin' this.\"\n\nHaney spoke with elaborate courtesy: \"You mind, Braun? Want to get some\nfriends of yours, too?\"\n\n\"I got no friends,\" said Braun. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe Chief went authoritatively to the owner of Sid's Steak Joint. He\npaid the bill, talking. The owner of the place negligently jerked his\nthumb toward the rear. This was not an unparalleled request--for the use\nof a storeroom so that two men could batter each other undisturbed.\nBootstrap was a law-abiding town, because to get fired from work on the\nPlatform was to lose a place in the most important job in history. So it\nwas inevitable that the settlement of quarrels in private should become\ncommonplace.\n\nThe Chief leading, they filed through the kitchen and out of doors. The\nstoreroom lay beyond. The Chief went in and switched on the light. He\nlooked about and was satisfied. It was almost empty, save for stacked\ncartons in one corner. Braun was already taking off his coat.\n\n\"You want rounds and stuff?\" demanded the Chief.\n\n\"I want fight,\" said Braun thickly.\n\n\"Okay, then,\" snapped the Chief. \"No kickin' or gougin'. A man's down,\nhe has a chance to get up. That's all the rules. Right?\"\n\nHaney, stripping off his coat in turn, grunted an assent. He handed his\ncoat to Joe. He faced his antagonist.\n\nIt was a curious atmosphere for a fight. There were merely the plank\nwalls of the storeroom with a single dangling light in the middle and an\nunswept floor beneath. The Chief stood in the doorway, scowling. This\ndidn't feel right. There was not enough hatred in evidence to justify\nit. There was doggedness and resolution enough, but Braun was deathly\nwhite and if his face was contorted--and it was--it was not with the\nlust to batter and injure and maim. It was something else.\n\nThe two men faced each other. And then the stocky, swarthy Braun swung\nat Haney. The blow had sting in it but nothing more. It almost looked as\nif Braun were trying to work himself up to the fight he'd insisted on\nfinishing. Haney countered with a roundhouse blow that glanced off\nBraun's cheek. And then they bore in at each other, slugging without\nscience or skill.\n\nJoe watched. Braun launched a blow that hurt, but Haney sent him reeling\nback. He came in doggedly again, and swung and swung, but he had no idea\nof boxing. His only idea was to slug. He did slug. Haney had been\npeevish rather than angry. Now he began to glower. He began to take the\nfight to Braun.\n\nHe knocked Braun down. Braun staggered up and rushed. A wildly flailing\nfist landed on Haney's ear. He doubled Braun up with a wallop to the\nmidsection. Braun came back, fists swinging.\n\nHaney closed one eye for him. He came back. Haney shook him from head to\nfoot with a chest blow. He came back. Haney split his lip and loosened a\ntooth. He came back.\n\nThe Chief said sourly: \"This ain't a fight. Quit it, Haney! He don't\nknow how!\"\n\nHaney tried to draw away, but Braun swarmed on him, striking fiercely\nuntil Haney had to floor him again. He dragged himself up and rushed at\nHaney--and was knocked down again. Haney stood over him, panting\nfuriously.\n\n\"Quit it, y'fool! What's the matter with you?\"\n\nBraun started to get up again. The Chief interfered and held him, while\nHaney glared.\n\n\"He ain't going to fight any more, Braun,\" pronounced the Chief firmly.\n\"You ain't got a chance. This fight's over. You had enough.\"\n\nBraun was bloody and horribly battered, but he panted: \"He's got\nenough?\"\n\n\"Are you out o' your head?\" demanded the Chief. \"He ain't got a mark on\nhim!\"\n\n\"I ain't--got enough,\" panted Braun, \"till he's got--enough!\"\n\nHis breath was coming in soblike gasps, the result of body blows. It\nhadn't been a fight but a beating, administered by Haney. But Braun\nstruggled to get up.\n\nMike the midget said brittlely: \"You got enough, Haney. You're\nsatisfied. Tell him so.\"\n\n\"Sure I'm satisfied,\" snorted Haney. \"I don't want to hit him any more.\nI got enough of that!\"\n\nBraun panted: \"Okay! Okay!\"\n\nThe Chief let him get to his feet. He went groggily to his coat. He\ntried to put himself into it. Mike caught Joe's eye and nodded\nmeaningfully. Joe helped Braun into the coat. There was silence, save\nfor Braun's heavy, labored breathing.\n\nHe moved unsteadily toward the door. Then he stopped.\n\n\"Haney,\" he said effortfully, \"I don't say I'm sorry for fighting you\ntoday. I fight first. But now I say I am sorry. You are good guy, Haney.\nI was crazy. I--got reason.\"\n\nHe stumbled out of the door and was gone. The four who were left behind\nstared at each other.\n\n\"What's the matter with him?\" demanded Haney blankly.\n\n\"He's nuts,\" said the Chief. \"If he was gonna apologize----\"\n\nMike shook his head.\n\n\"He wouldn't apologize,\" he said brittlely, \"because he thought you\nmight think he was scared. But when he'd proved he wasn't scared of a\nbeating--then he could say he was sorry.\" He paused. \"I've seen guys I\nliked a lot less than him.\"\n\nHaney put on his coat, frowning.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" he rumbled. \"Next time I see him----\"\n\n\"You won't,\" snapped Mike. \"None of us will. I'll bet on it.\"\n\nBut he was wrong. The others went out of the storeroom and back into\nSid's Steak Joint, and the Chief politely thanked the proprietor for the\nloan of his storeroom for a private fight. Then they went out into the\nneon-lighted business street of Bootstrap.\n\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"Where you sleeping?\" asked the Chief hospitably. \"I can get you a room\nat my place.\"\n\n\"I'm staying out at the Shed,\" Joe told him awkwardly. \"My family's\nknown Major Holt a long time. I'm staying at his house behind the Shed.\"\n\nHaney raised his eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"Better get out there then,\" said the Chief. \"It's midnight, and they\nmight want to lock up. There's your bus.\"\n\nA lighted bus was waiting by the curb. Its doors were open, but it was\nempty of passengers. Single busses ran out to the Shed now and then, but\nthey ran in fleets at shift-change time. Joe went over and climbed\naboard the bus.\n\n\"We'll turn up early,\" said the Chief. \"This won't be a shift job. We'll\nlook things over and lay out what we want and then get to work, eh?\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Joe. \"And thanks.\"\n\n\"We'll be there with our hair in braids,\" said Mike, in his cracked\nvoice. \"Now a glass of beer and so to bed. 'Night.\"\n\nHaney waved his hand. The three of them marched off, the two huge\nfigures of Haney and the Chief, with Mike trotting truculently between\nthem, hardly taller than their knees. They were curiously colorful with\nall the many-tinted neon signs upon them. They turned into a diner.\n\nJoe sat in the bus, alone. The driver was off somewhere. The sounds of\nBootstrap were distinctive by night. Footsteps, and the jangling of\nbicycle bells, and voices, and a radio blaring somewhere and a\nrecord-shop loud-speaker somewhere else, and a sort of underriding noise\nof festivity.\n\nThere was a sharp rap on the glass by Joe's window. He started and\nlooked out. Braun--battered, and bleeding from the corner of his\nmouth--motioned urgently for him to come to the door of the bus. Joe\nwent.\n\nBraun stared up at him in a new fashion. Now he was neither dogged nor\nfierce nor desperate to look at. Despite the beating he'd taken, he\nseemed completely and somehow frighteningly tranquil. He looked like\nsomebody who has come to the end of torment and is past any feeling but\nthat of relief from suffering.\n\n\"You--\" said Braun. \"That girl you were with today. Her pop is Major\nHolt, eh?\"\n\nJoe frowned, and reservedly said that he was.\n\n\"You tell her pop,\" said Braun detachedly, \"this is hot tip. Hot tip.\nLook two kilometers north of Shed tomorrow. He find something bad. Hot!\nYou tell him. Two kilometers.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Joe, his frown increasing. \"But look here----\"\n\n\"Be sure say hot,\" repeated Braun.\n\nRather incredibly, he smiled. Then he turned and walked quickly away.\n\nJoe went back to his seat in the empty bus, and sat there and waited for\nit to start, and tried to figure out what the message meant. Since it\nwas for Major Holt, it had something to do with security. And security\nmeant defense against sabotage. And \"hot\" might mean merely\n_significant_, or--in these days--it might mean _something else_. In\nfact, it might mean something to make your hair stand on end when\nthought of in connection with the Space Platform.\n\nJoe waited for the bus to take off. He became convinced that Braun's use\nof the word \"hot\" did not mean merely \"significant.\" The other meaning\nwas what he had in mind.\n\nJoe's teeth tried to chatter.\n\nHe didn't let them.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nMajor Holt wasn't to be found when Joe got out to the Shed. And he\nwasn't in the house in the officers'-quarters area behind it. There was\nonly the housekeeper, who yawned pointedly as she let Joe in. Sally was\npresumably long since asleep. And Joe didn't know any way to get hold of\nthe Major. He assured himself that Braun was a good guy--if he weren't\nhe wouldn't have insisted on taking a licking before he apologized--and\nhe hadn't said there was any hurry. Tomorrow, he'd said. So Joe uneasily\nlet himself be led to a room with a cot, and he was asleep in what\nseemed seconds. But just the same he was badly worried.\n\nIn fact, next morning Joe woke at a practically unearthly hour with\nBraun's message pounding on his brain. He was downstairs waiting when\nthe housekeeper appeared. She looked startled.\n\n\"Major Holt?\" he asked.\n\nBut the Major was gone. He must have done with no more than three or\nfour hours' sleep. There was an empty coffee cup whose contents he'd\ngulped down before going back to the security office.\n\nJoe trudged to the barbed-wire enclosure around the officers'-quarters\narea and explained to the sentry where he wanted to go. A sleepy driver\nwhisked him around the half-mile circle to the security building and he\nfound his way to Major Holt's office.\n\nThe plain and gloomy secretary was already on the job, too. She led him\nin to face Major Holt. He blinked at the sight of Joe.\n\n\"Hm.... I have some news,\" he observed. \"We back-tracked the parcel that\nexploded when it was dumped from the plane.\"\n\nJoe had almost forgotten it. Too many other things had happened since.\n\n\"We've got two very likely prisoners out of that affair,\" said the\nMajor. \"They may talk. Also, an emergency inspection of other transport\nplanes has turned up three other grenades tucked away in front-wheel\nwells. Ah--CO_2 bottles have turned out to have something explosive in\nthem. A very nice bit of work, that! The sandy-haired man who fueled\nyour plane--ah--disappeared. That is bad!\"\n\nJoe said politely: \"That's fine, sir.\"\n\n\"All in all, you've been the occasion of our forestalling a good deal of\nsabotage,\" said the Major. \"Bad for you, of course.... Did you find the\nmen you were looking for?\"\n\n\"I've found them, but--.\"\n\n\"I'll have them transferred to work under your direction,\" said the\nMajor briskly. \"Their names?\"\n\nJoe gave the names. The Major wrote them down.\n\n\"Very good. I'm busy now----\"\n\n\"I've a tip for you,\" said Joe. \"I think it should be checked right\naway. I don't feel too good about it.\"\n\nThe Major waited impatiently. And Joe explained, very carefully, about\nthe fight on the Platform the day before, Braun's insistence on\nfinishing the fight in Bootstrap, and then the tip he'd given Joe after\neverything was over. He repeated the message exactly, word for word.\n\nThe Major, to do him justice, did not interrupt. He listened with an\nexpression that varied between grimness and weariness. When Joe ended he\npicked up a telephone. He talked briefly. Joe felt a reluctant sort of\napproval. Major Holt was not a man one could ever feel very close to,\nand the work he was in charge of was not likely to make him popular, but\nhe did think straight--and fast. He didn't think \"hot\" meant\n\"significant,\" either. When he'd hung up the phone he said curtly: \"When\nwill your work crew get here?\"\n\n\"Early--but not yet,\" said Joe. \"Not for some time yet.\"\n\n\"Go with the pilot,\" said the Major. \"You'd recognize what Braun meant\nas soon as anybody. See what you see.\"\n\nJoe stood up.\n\n\"You--think the tip is straight?\"\n\n\"This isn't the first time,\" said Major Holt detachedly, \"that a man has\nbeen blackmailed into trying sabotage. If he's got a family somewhere\nabroad, and they're threatened with death or torture unless he does\nsuch-and-such here, he's in a bad fix. It's happened. Of course he can't\ntell me! He's watched. But he sometimes finds an out.\"\n\nJoe was puzzled. His face showed it.\n\n\"He can try to do the sabotage,\" said the Major precisely, \"or he can\narrange to be caught trying to do it. If he's caught--he tried; and the\nblackmail threat is no threat at all so long as he keeps his mouth shut.\nWhich he does. And--ah--you would be surprised how often a man who\nwasn't born in the United States would rather go to prison for sabotage\nthan commit it--here.\"\n\nJoe blinked.\n\n\"If your friend Braun is caught,\" said the Major, \"he will be punished.\nSeverely. Officially. But privately, someone will--ah--mention this tip\nand say 'thanks.' And he'll be told that he will be released from prison\njust as soon as he thinks it's safe. And he will be. That's all.\"\n\nHe turned to his papers. Joe went out. On the way to meet the pilot\nwho'd check on his tip, he thought things over. He began to feel a sort\nof formless but very definite pride. He wasn't quite sure what he was\nproud of, but it had something to do with being part of a country toward\nwhich men of wholly different upbringing could feel deep loyalty. If a\nman who was threatened unless he turned traitor, a man who might not\neven be a citizen, arranged to be caught and punished for an apparent\ncrime against a country rather than commit it--that wasn't bad. There\ncan be a lot of things wrong with a nation, but if somebody from another\none entirely can come to feel that kind of loyalty toward it--well--it's\nnot too bad a country to belong to.\n\nJoe had a security guard with him this time, instead of Sally, as he\nwent across the vast, arc-lit interior of the Shed and past the\nshimmering growing monster that was the Platform. He went all the way to\nthe great swinging doors that let in materials trucks. And there were\nguards there, and they checked each driver very carefully before they\nadmitted his truck. But somehow it wasn't irritating. It wasn't scornful\nsuspicion. There'd be snide and snappy characters in the Security force,\nof course, swaggering and throwing their weight about. But even they\nwere guarding something that men--some men--were willing to throw away\ntheir lives for.\n\nJoe and his guard reached one of the huge entrances as a ten-wheeler\ntruck came in with a load of shining metal plates. Joe's escort went\nthrough the opening with him and they waited outside. The sun had barely\nrisen. It looked huge but very far away, and Joe suddenly realized why\njust this spot had been chosen for the building of the Platform.\n\nThe ground was flat. All the way to the eastern horizon there wasn't\neven a minor hillock rising above the plain. It was bare, arid,\nsun-scorched desert. It was featureless save for sage and mesquite and\ntall thin stalks of yucca. But it was flat. It could be a runway. It was\na perfect place for the Platform to start from. The Platform shouldn't\ntouch ground at all, after it was out of the Shed, but at least it\nwouldn't run into any obstacles on its way toward the horizon.\n\nA light plane came careening around the great curved outer surface of\nthe Shed. It landed and taxied up to the door. It swung smartly around\nand its side door opened. A bandaged hand waved at Joe. He climbed in.\nThe pilot of this light, flimsy plane was the co-pilot of the transport\nof yesterday. He was the man Joe had helped to dump cargo.\n\nJoe climbed in and settled himself. The small motor pop-popped\nvaliantly, the plane rushed forward over hard-packed desert earth, and\nwent swaying up into the air.\n\nThe co-pilot--pilot now--shouted cheerfully above the din: \"Hiya. You\ncouldn't sleep either? Burns hurt?\"\n\nJoe shook his head.\n\n\"Bothered,\" he shouted in reply. Then he added, \"Do I do something to\nhelp, or am I along just for the ride?\"\n\n\"First we take a look,\" the pilot called over the motor racket. \"Two\nkilometers due north of the Shed, eh?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"We'll see what's there,\" the pilot told him.\n\nThe small plane went up and up. At five hundred feet--nearly level with\nthe roof of the Shed--it swung away and began to make seemingly erratic\ndartings out over the spotty desert land, and then back. Actually, it\nwas a search pattern. Joe looked down from his side of the small\ncockpit. This was a very small plane indeed, and in consequence its\nmotor made much more noise inside its cabin than much more powerful\nengines in bigger ships.\n\n\"Those burns I got,\" shouted the pilot, staring down, \"kept me awake. So\nI got up and was just walking around when the call came for somebody to\ndrive one of these things. I took over.\"\n\nBack and forth, and back and forth. From five hundred feet in the early\nmorning the desert had a curious appearance. The plane was low enough\nfor each smallest natural feature to be visible, and it was early enough\nfor every shrub or hummock to cast a long, slender shadow. The ground\nlooked streaked, but all the streaks ran the same way, and all were\nshadows.\n\nJoe shouted: \"What's that?\"\n\nThe plane banked at a steep angle and ran back. It banked again. The\npilot stared carefully. He reached forward and pushed a button. There\nwas a tiny impact underfoot. Another steep banking turn, and Joe saw a\npuff of smoke in the air.\n\nThe pilot shouted: \"It's a man. He looks dead.\"\n\nHe swung directly over the small prone object and there was a second\npuff of smoke.\n\n\"They've got range finders on us from the Shed,\" he called across the\ntwo-foot space separating him from Joe. \"This marks the spot. Now we'll\nsee if there's anything to the hot part of that tip.\"\n\nHe reached over behind his seat and brought out a stubby pole like a\nfishpole with a very large reel. There was also a headset, and something\nvery much like a large aluminum fish on the end of the line.\n\n\"You know Geiger counters?\" called the pilot. \"Stick on these headphones\nand listen!\"\n\nJoe slipped on the headset. The pilot threw a switch and Joe heard\nclickings. They had no pattern and no fixed frequency. They were\nclickings at strictly random intervals, but there was an average\nfrequency, at that.\n\n\"Let the counter out the window,\" called the pilot, \"and listen. Tell me\nif the noise goes up.\"\n\nJoe obeyed. The aluminum fish dangled. The line slanted astern from the\nwind. It made a curve between the pole and the aluminum plummet, which\nwas hollow in the direction of the plane's motion. The pilot squinted\ndown and began to swing in a wide circle around the spot where an\napparently dead man had been sighted, and above which puffs of smoke now\nfloated.\n\nThree-quarters of the way around, the random clickings suddenly became a\nroar.\n\nJoe said: \"Hey!\"\n\nThe pilot swung the plane about and flew back. He pointed to the button\nhe'd pushed.\n\n\"Poke that when you hear it again.\"\n\nThe clickings.... They roared. Joe pushed the button. He felt the tiny\nimpact.\n\n\"Once more,\" said the pilot.\n\nHe swung in nearer where the dead man lay. Joe had a sickening idea of\nwho the dead man might be. A sudden rush of noise in the headphones and\nhe pushed the button again.\n\n\"Reel in now!\" shouted the pilot. \"Our job's done.\"\n\nJoe reeled in as the plane winged steadily back toward the Shed. There\nwere puffs of smoke floating in the air behind. They had been ranged on\nat the instant they appeared. Somebody back at the Shed knew that\nsomething that needed to be investigated was at a certain spot, and the\ntwo later puffs of smoke had said that radioactivity was notable in the\nair along the line the two puffs made. Not much more information would\nbe needed. The meaning of Braun's warning that his tip was \"hot\" was\ndefinite. It was \"hot\" in the sense that it dealt with radioactivity!\n\nThe plane dipped down and landed by the great doors again. It taxied up\nand the pilot killed the motor.\n\n\"We've been using Geigers for months,\" he said pleasedly, \"and never got\na sign before. This is one time we were set for something.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Joe. But he knew.\n\n\"Atomic dust is one good guess,\" the pilot told him. \"It was talked of\nas a possible weapon away back in the Smyth Report. Nobody's ever tried\nit. We thought it might be tried against the Platform. If somebody\nmanaged to spread some really hot radioactive dust around the Shed, all\nthree shifts might get fatally burned before it was noticed. _They'd_\nthink so, anyhow! But the guy who was supposed to dump it opened up the\ncan for a look. And it killed him.\"\n\nHe climbed out of the plane and went to the doorway. He took a telephone\nfrom a guard and talked crisply into it. He hung up.\n\n\"Somebody coming for you,\" he said amiably. \"Wait here. Be seeing you.\"\n\nHe went out, the motor kicked over and caught, and the tiny plane raced\naway. Seconds later it was aloft and winging southward.\n\nJoe waited. Presently a door opened and something came clanking out. It\nwas a tractor with surprisingly heavy armor. There were men in it, also\nwearing armor of a peculiar sort, which they were still adjusting. The\ntractor towed a half-track platform on which there were a crane and a\nvery considerable lead-coated bin with a top. It went briskly off into\nthe distance toward the north.\n\nJoe was amazed, but comprehending. The vehicle and the men were armored\nagainst radioactivity. They would approach the dead man from upwind, and\nthey would scoop up his body and put it in the lead-lined bin, and with\nit all deadly radioactive material near him. This was the equipment that\nmust have been used to handle the dud atom bomb some months back. It had\nbeen ready for that. It was ready for this emergency. Somebody had tried\nto think of every imaginable situation that could arise in connection\nwith the Platform.\n\nBut in a moment a guard came for Joe and took him to where the Chief and\nHaney and Mike waited by the still incompletely-pulled-away crates. They\nhad some new ideas about the job on hand that were better than the\noriginal ones in some details. All four of them set to work to make a\ncareful survey of damage--of parts that would have to be replaced and of\nthose that needed to be repaired. The discoveries they made would have\nappalled Joe earlier. Now he merely made notes of parts necessary to be\nreplaced by new ones that could be had within the repair time for\nrebalancing the rotors.\n\n\"This is sure a mess,\" said Haney mournfully, as they worked. \"It's two\ndays just getting things cleaned up!\"\n\nThe Chief eyed the rotors. There were two of them, great four-foot disks\nwith extraordinary short and stubby shafts that were brought to\nbeautifully polished conical ends to fit in the bearings. The bearings\nwere hollowed to fit the shaft ends, but they were intricately scored to\nform oil channels. In operation, a very special silicone oil would be\npumped into the bearings under high pressure. Distributed by the\nchannels, the oil would form a film that by its pressure would hold the\ncone end of the bearing away from actual contact with the metal. The\nrotors, in fact, would be floated in oil just as the high-speed\ncentrifuge the Chief had mentioned had floated on compressed air. But\nthey had to be perfectly balanced, because any imbalance would make the\nshaft pierce the oil film and touch the metal of the bearing--and when a\nshaft is turning at 40,000 r.p.m. it is not good for it to touch\nanything. Shaft and bearing would burn white-hot in fractions of a\nsecond and there would be several devils to pay.\n\n\"We've got to spin it in a lathe,\" said the Chief profoundly, \"to hold\nthe chucks. The chucks have got to be these same bearings, because\nnothing else will stand the speed. And we got to cut out the bed plate\nof any lathe we find. Hm. We got to do our spinning with the shaft lined\nup with the earth's axis, too.\"\n\nMike nodded wisely, and Joe knew he'd pointed that out. It was true\nenough. A high-speed gyro could only be run for minutes in one single\ndirection if its mount were fixed. If a precisely mounted gyro had its\nshaft pointed at the sun, for example, while it ran, its axis would try\nto follow the sun. It would try not to turn with the earth, and it would\nwreck itself. They had to use the cone bearings, but in order to protect\nthe fine channellings for oil they'd have to use cone-shaped shims at\nthe beginning while running at low speed. The cone ends of the shaft\nwould need new machining to line them up. The bearings had to be fixed,\nyet flexible. The----\n\nThey had used many paper napkins the night before, merely envisioning\nthese details. New problems turned up as the apparatus itself was being\nuncovered and cleaned.\n\nThey worked for hours, clearing away soot and charred material. Joe's\nlist of small parts to be replaced from the home plant was as long as\nhis arm. The motors, of course, had to be scrapped and new ones\nsubstituted. Considering their speed--the field strength at operating\nrate was almost imperceptible--they had to be built new, which would\nmean round-the-clock work at Kenmore.\n\nA messenger came for Joe. The security office wanted him. Major Holt's\ngloomy secretary did not even glance up as he entered. Major Holt\nhimself looked tired.\n\n\"There was a man out there,\" he said curtly. \"I think it is your friend\nBraun. I'll get you to look and identify.\"\n\nJoe had suspected as much. He waited.\n\n\"He'd opened a container of cobalt powder. It was in a beryllium case.\nThere was half a pound of it. It killed him.\"\n\n\"Radioactive cobalt,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Definitely,\" said the Major grimly. \"Half a pound of it gives off the\nradiation of an eighth of a ton of pure radium. One can guess that he\nhad been instructed to get up as high as he could in the Shed and dump\nthe powder into the air. It would diffuse--scatter as it sifted down. It\nwould have contaminated the whole Shed past all use for years--let alone\nkilling everybody in it.\"\n\nJoe swallowed.\n\n\"He was burned, then.\"\n\n\"He had the equivalent of two hundred and fifty pounds of radium within\ninches of his body,\" the Major said unbendingly, \"and naturally it was\nnot healthy. For that matter, the container itself was not adequate\nprotection for him. Once he'd carried it in his pocket for a very few\nminutes, he was a dead man, even though he was not conscious of the\nfact.\"\n\nJoe knew what was wanted of him.\n\n\"You want me to look at him,\" he said.\n\nThe Major nodded.\n\n\"Yes. Afterward, get a radiation check on yourself. It is hardly likely\nthat he was--ah--carrying the stuff with him last night, in Bootstrap.\nBut if he was--ah--you may need some precautionary treatment--you and\nthe men who were with you.\"\n\nJoe realized what that meant. Braun had been given a relatively small\ncontainer of the deadliest available radioactive material on Earth.\nMilligrams of it, shipped from Oak Ridge for scientific use, were\nencased in thick lead chests. He'd carried two hundred and fifty grams\nin a container he could put in his pocket. He was not only dead as he\nwalked, under such circumstances. He was also death to those who walked\nnear him.\n\n\"Somebody else may have been burned in any case,\" said the Major\ndetachedly. \"I am going to issue a radioactivity alarm and check every\nman in Bootstrap for burns. It is--ah--very likely that the man who\ndelivered it to this man is burned, too. But you will not mention this,\nof course.\"\n\nHe waved his hand in dismissal. Joe turned to go. The Major added\ngrimly: \"By the way, there is no doubt about the booby-trapping of\nplanes. We've found eight, so far, ready to be crashed when a string was\npulled while they were serviced. But the men who did the booby-trapping\nhave vanished. They disappeared suddenly during last night. They were\nwarned! Have you talked to anybody?\"\n\n\"No sir,\" said Joe.\n\n\"I would like to know,\" said the Major coldly, \"how they knew we'd found\nout their trick!\"\n\nJoe went out. He felt very cold at the pit of his stomach. He was to\nidentify Braun. Then he was to get a radiation check on himself. In that\norder of events. He was to identify Braun first, because if Braun had\ncarried a half-pound of radioactive cobalt on him in Sid's Steak Joint\nthe night before, Joe was going to die. And so were Haney and the Chief\nand Mike, and anybody else who'd passed near him. So Joe was to do the\nidentification before he was disturbed by the information that he was\ndead.\n\nHe made the identification. Braun was very decently laid out in a\nlead-lined box, with a lead-glass window over his face. There was no\nsign of any injury on him except from his fight with Haney. The\nradiation burns were deep, but they'd left no marks of their own. He'd\ndied before outer symptoms could occur.\n\nJoe signed the identification certificate. He went to be checked for his\nown chances of life. It was a peculiar sensation. The most peculiar was\nthat he wasn't afraid. He was neither confident that he was not burned\ninside, nor sure that he was. He simply was not afraid. Nobody really\never believes that he is going to die--in the sense of ceasing to exist.\nThe most arrant coward, stood before a wall to be shot, or strapped in\nan electric chair, finds that astoundingly he does not believe that what\nhappens to his body is going to kill him, the individual. That is why a\ngreat many people die with reasonable dignity. They know it is not worth\nmaking too much of a fuss over.\n\nBut when the Geiger counters had gone over him from head to foot, and\nhis body temperature was normal, and his reflexes sound--when he was\nassured that he had not been exposed to dangerous radiation--Joe felt\ndistinctly weak in the knees. And that was natural, too.\n\nHe went trudging back to the wrecked gyros. His friends were gone,\nleaving a scrawled memo for him. They had gone to pick out the machine\ntools for the work at hand.\n\nHe continued to check over the wreckage, thinking with a detached\ncompassion of that poor devil Braun who was the victim of men who hated\nthe idea of the Space Platform and what it would mean to humanity. Men\nof that kind thought of themselves as superior to humanity, and of human\nbeings as creatures to be enslaved. So they arranged for planes to crash\nand burn and for men to be murdered, and they practiced blackmail--or\nrewarded those who practiced it for them. They wanted to prevent the\nPlatform from existing because it would keep them from trying to pull\nthe world down in ruins so they could rule over the wreckage.\n\nJoe--who had so recently thought it likely that he would die--considered\nthese actions with an icy dislike that was much deeper than anger. It\nwas backed by everything he believed in, everything he had ever wanted,\nand everything he hoped for. And anger could cool off, but the way he\nfelt about people who would destroy others for their own purposes could\nnot cool off. It was part of him. He thought about it as he worked, with\nall the noises of the Shed singing in his ears.\n\nA voice said: \"Joe.\"\n\nHe started and turned. Sally stood behind him, looking at him very\ngravely. She tried to smile.\n\n\"Dad told me,\" she said, \"about the check-up that says you're all right.\nMay I congratulate you on your being with us for a while?--on the\ncobalt's not getting near you?--or the rest of us?\"\n\nJoe did not know exactly what to say.\n\n\"I'm going inside the Platform,\" she told him. \"Would you like to come\nalong?\"\n\nHe wiped his hands on a piece of waste.\n\n\"Naturally! My gang is off picking out tools. I can't do much until they\ncome back.\"\n\nHe fell into step beside her. They walked toward the Platform. And it\nwas still magic, no matter how often Joe looked at it. It was huge\nbeyond belief, though it was surely not heavy in proportion to its size.\nIts bright plating shone through the gossamer scaffolding all about it.\nThere was always a faint bluish mist in the air, and there were the\nmarsh-fire lights of welding torches playing here and there. The sounds\nof the Shed were a steady small tumult in Joe's ears. He was getting\naccustomed to them, though.\n\n\"How is it you can go around so freely?\" he asked abruptly. \"I have to\nbe checked and rechecked.\"\n\n\"You'll get a full clearance,\" she told him. \"It has to go through\nchannels. Me--I have influence. I always come in through security, and I\nhave the door guards trained. And I do have business in the Platform.\"\n\nHe turned his head to look at her.\n\n\"Interior decoration,\" she explained. \"And don't laugh! It isn't\nprettifying. It's psychology. The Platform was designed by engineers and\nphysicists and people with slide rules. They made a beautiful\nenvironment for machinery. But there will be men living in it, and they\naren't machines.\"\n\n\"I don't see----\"\n\n\"They designed the hydroponic garden,\" said Sally with a certain scorn.\n\"They calculated very neatly that eleven square feet of leaf surface of\na pumpkin plant will purify all the air a resting man uses, and so much\nmore will purify the air a man uses when he's working hard. So they\ndesigned the gardens for the most efficient production of the greatest\npossible leaf surface--of pumpkin plants! They figured food would be\nbrought up by the tender rockets! But can you imagine the men in the\nPlatform, floating among the stars, living on dehydrated food and\nstuffing themselves hungrily with pumpkins because that is the only\nfresh food they have?\"\n\nJoe saw the irony.\n\n\"They're thinking of mechanical efficiency,\" said Sally indignantly. \"I\ndon't know anything about machinery, but I've wasted an awful lot of\ntime at school and otherwise if I don't know something about human\nbeings! I argued, and the garden now isn't as mechanically efficient,\nbut it'll be a nice place for a man to go into. He won't smell pumpkin\nplants all the time, either. I've even gotten them to include some\nflowers!\"\n\nThey were very near the Platform. And it was very near to completion.\nJoe looked at it hungrily, and he felt a great sense of urgency. He\ntried to strip away the scaffolding in his mind and see it floating\nproudly free in emptiness, with white-hot sunshine glinting from it, and\nonly a background of unwinking stars.\n\nSally's voice went on: \"And I've really put up an argument about the\nliving quarters. They had every interior wall painted aluminum! I argued\nthat in space or out of it, where people have to live, it's\nhousekeeping. This is going to be their home. And they ought to feel\nhuman in it!\"\n\nThey passed into one of the openings in the maze of uprights. All about\nthem there were trucks, and puffing engines, and hoists. Joe dragged\nSally aside as a monstrous truck-and-trailer came from where it had\ndelivered some gigantic item of interior use. It rumbled past them, and\nshe led the way to a flight of temporary wooden stairs with two security\nguards at the bottom. Sally talked severely to them, and they grinned\nand waved for Joe to go ahead. He went up the steps--which would be\npulled down before the Platform's launching--and went actually inside\nthe Space Platform for the first time.\n\nIt was a moment of extreme vividness for him. Within the past hour he'd\ncome to think detachedly of the possibility of death for himself, and\nthen had learned that he would live for a while yet. He knew that Sally\nhad been scared on his account, and that her matter-of-fact manner was\npartly assumed. She was at least as much wrought up as he was.\n\nAnd this was the first time he was going into what would be the first\nspace ship ever to leave the Earth on a non-return journey.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nNobody could have gone through the changes of emotion Joe had\nexperienced that morning and remained quite matter-of-fact. Seeing a\ndead man who had more or less deliberately killed himself so that he\nwouldn't have to kill Joe--for one--had its effect. Knowing that it was\ncertainly possible the man hadn't killed himself in time had another.\nBeing checked over for radiation burns which would mean that he'd die\nquite comfortably within three or four days, and then learning that no\nburns existed, was something of an ordeal. And Sally--of course her\nfeelings shouldn't have been as vivid as his own, but the fact that\nshe'd been scared for him held some significance. When, on top of all\nthe rest, he went into the Space Platform for the first time, Joe was\ndefinitely keyed up.\n\nBut he talked technology. He examined the inner skin and its lining\nbefore going beyond the temporary entrance. The plating of the Platform\nwas actually double. The outer layer was a meteor-bumper against which\nparticles of cosmic dust would strike and explode without damage to the\ninner skin. They could even penetrate it without causing a leak of air.\nInside the inner skin there was a layer of glass wool for heat\ninsulation. Inside the glass wool was a layer of material serving\nexactly the function of the coating of a bulletproof gasoline tank. No\nmeteor under a quarter-inch size could hope to make a puncture, even at\nthe forty-five-mile-per-second speed that is the theoretical maximum for\nmeteors. And if one did, the selfsealing stuff would stop the leak\nimmediately. Joe could explain the protection of the metal skins. He\ndid.\n\n\"When a missile travels fast enough,\" he said absorbedly, \"it stops\nacquiring extra puncturing ability. Over a mile a second, impact can't\nbe transmitted from front to rear. The back end of the thing that hits\nhas arrived at the hit place before the shock of arrival can travel back\nto it. It's like a train in a collision which doesn't stop all at once.\nA meteor hitting the Platform will telescope on itself like the cars of\na railroad train that hits another at full speed.\"\n\nSally listened enigmatically.\n\n\"So,\" said Joe, \"the punching effect isn't there. A meteor hitting the\nPlatform won't punch. It'll explode. Part of it will turn to\nvapor--metallic vapor if it's metal, and rocky vapor if it's stone.\nIt'll blow a crater in the metal plate. It'll blow away as much weight\nof the skin as it weighs itself. Mass for mass. So that weight for\nweight, pea soup would be just as effective armor against meteors as\nhardened steel.\"\n\nSally said: \"Dear me! You must read the newspapers!\"\n\n\"The odds figure out, the odds are even that the Platform won't get an\nactual meteor puncture in the first twenty thousand years it's floating\nround the Earth.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand two seventy, Joe,\" said Sally. She was trying to tease\nhim, but her face showed a little of the strain. \"I read the magazine\narticles too. In fact I sometimes show the tame article writers around,\nwhen they're cleared to see the Platform.\"\n\nJoe winced a little. Then he grinned wryly.\n\n\"That cuts me down to size, eh?\"\n\nShe smiled at him. But they both felt queer. They went on into the\ninterior of the huge space ship.\n\n\"Lots of space,\" said Joe. \"This could've been smaller.\"\n\n\"It'll be nine-tenths empty when it goes up,\" said Sally. \"But you know\nabout that, don't you?\"\n\nJoe did know. The reasons for the streamlining of rockets to be fired\nfrom the ground didn't apply to the Platform. Not with the same urgency,\nanyhow. Rockets had to burn their fuel fast to get up out of the dense\nair near the ground. They had to be streamlined to pierce the thick,\nresisting part of the atmosphere. The Platform didn't. It wouldn't climb\nby itself. It would be carried necessarily at slow speed up to the point\nwhere jet motors were most efficient, and then it would be carried\nhigher until they ceased to be efficient. Only when it was up where air\nresistance was a very small fraction of ground-level drag would its own\nrockets fire. It wouldn't gain much by being shaped to cut thin air, and\nit would lose a lot. For one thing, the launching process planned for\nthe Platform allowed it to be built complete so far as its hull was\nconcerned. Once it got out into its orbit there would be no more\nworries. There wouldn't be any gamble on the practicability of\nassembling a great structure in a weightless \"world.\"\n\nThe two of them--and the way they both felt, it seemed natural for Joe\nto be helping Sally very carefully through the corridors of the\nPlatform--the two of them came to the engine room. This wasn't the place\nwhere the drive of the Platform was centered. It was where the service\nmotors and the air-circulation system and the fluid pumps were powered.\nOff the engine room the main gyros were already installed. They waited\nonly for the pilot gyros to control them as a steering engine controls\nan Earth ship's rudder. Joe looked very thoughtfully at the gyro\nassembly. That was familiar, from the working drawings. But he let Sally\nguide him on without trying to stop and look closely.\n\nShe showed him the living quarters. They centered in a great open space\nsixty feet long and twenty wide and high. There were bookshelves, and\ntwo balconies, and chairs. Private cabins opened from it on different\nlevels, but there were no steps to them. Yet there were comfortable\nchairs with straps so that when a man was weightless he could fasten\nhimself in them. There were ash trays, ingeniously designed to look like\nexactly that and nothing else. But ashes would not fall into them, but\nwould be drawn into them by suction. There was unpatterned carpet on the\nfloor _and_ on the ceiling.\n\n\"It's going to feel queer,\" said Sally, oddly quiet, \"when all this is\nout in space, but it will look fairly normal. I think that's important.\nThis room will look like a big private library more than anything else.\nOne won't be reminded every second, by everything he sees, that he's\nliving in a strictly synthetic environment. He won't feel cramped. If\nall the rooms were small, a man would feel as if he were in prison. At\nleast this way he can pretend that things are normal.\"\n\nHer mind was not wholly on her words. She'd been frightened for Joe. And\nhe was acutely aware of it, because he felt a peculiar after-effect\nhimself.\n\n\"Normal,\" he said drily, \"except that he doesn't weigh anything.\"\n\n\"I've worried about that,\" said Sally. \"Sleeping's going to be a big\nproblem.\"\n\n\"It'll take getting used to,\" Joe agreed.\n\nThere was a momentary pause. They were simply looking about the great\nroom. Sally stirred uneasily.\n\n\"Tell me what you think,\" she said. \"You've been in an elevator that\nstarted to drop like a plummet. When the Platform is orbiting it'll be\nlike that all the time, only worse. No weight. Joe, if you were in an\nelevator that seemed to be dropping and dropping and dropping for hours\non end--do you think you could go to sleep?\"\n\nJoe hadn't thought about it. And he was acutely conscious of Sally, just\nthen, but the idea startled him.\n\n\"It might be hard to adjust to,\" he admitted.\n\n\"It'll be hard to adjust to, awake,\" said Sally. \"But getting adjusted\nto it asleep should be worse. You've waked up from a dream that you're\nfalling?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Joe. Then he whistled. \"Oh-oh! I see! You'd drop off to\nsleep, and you'd be falling. So you'd wake up. Everybody in the Platform\nwill be falling around the Earth in the Platform's orbit! Every time\nthey doze off they'll be falling and they'll wake up!\"\n\nHe managed to think about it. It was true enough. A man awake could\nremind himself that he only thought and felt that he was falling, and\nthat there was no danger. But what would happen when he tried to sleep?\nFalling is the first fear a human being ever knows. Everybody in the\nworld has at one time waked up gasping from a dream of precipices down\nwhich he plunged. It is an inborn terror. And no matter how thoroughly a\nman might know in his conscious mind that weightlessness was normal in\nemptiness, his conscious mind would go off duty when he went to sleep. A\ncompletely primitive subconscious would take over then, and it would not\nbe satisfied. It might wake him frantically at any sign of dozing until\nhe cracked up from sheer insomnia ... or else let him sleep only when\nexhaustion produced unconsciousness rather than restful slumber.\n\n\"That's a tough one!\" he said disturbedly, and noticed that she still\nshowed signs of her recent distress. \"There's not much to be done about\nit, either!\"\n\n\"I suggested something,\" said Sally, \"and they built it in. I hope it\nworks!\" she explained uncomfortably. \"It's a sort of blanket with a top\nthat straps down, and an inflatable underside. When a man wants to\nsleep, he'll inflate this thing, and it will hold him in his bunk. It\nwon't touch his head, of course, and he can move, but it will press\nagainst him gently.\"\n\nJoe thought over what Sally had just explained. He noticed that they\nwere quite close together, but he put his mind on her words.\n\n\"It'll be like a man swimming?\" he asked. \"One can go to sleep floating.\nThere's no sensation of weight, but there's the feeling of pressure all\nabout. A man might be able to sleep if he felt he were floating. Yes,\nthat's a good idea, Sally! It'll work! A man will think he's floating,\nrather than falling!\"\n\nSally flushed a little.\n\n\"I thought of it another way,\" she said awkwardly. \"When we go to sleep,\nwe go way back. We're like babies, with all a baby's fears and needs. It\n_might_ feel like floating. But--I tried one of those bunks. It feels\nlike--it feels sort of dreamy, as if someone were--holding one quite\nsafe. It feels as if one were a baby and--beautifully secure. But of\ncourse I haven't tried it weightless. I just--hope it works.\"\n\nAs if embarrassed, she turned abruptly and showed him the kitchen. Every\npan was covered. The top of the stove was alnico-magnet strips, arranged\nrather like the top of a magnetic chuck. Pans would cling to it. And the\ncovers had a curious flexible lining which Joe could not understand.\n\n\"It's a flexible plastic that's heatproof,\" said Sally. \"It inflates and\nholds the food down to the hot bottom of the pan. They expected the crew\nto eat ready-prepared food. I said that it would be bad enough to have\nto drink out of plastic bottles instead of glasses. They hung one of\nthese stoves upside down, for me, and I cooked bacon and eggs and\npancakes with the cover of the pan pointing to the floor. They said the\npsychological effect would be worth while.\"\n\nJoe was stirred. He followed her out of the kitchen and said warmly--the\nmore warmly because these contributions to the Space Platform came on\ntop of a personal anxiety on his own account: \"You must be the first\ngirl in the world who thought about housekeeping in space!\"\n\n\"Girls will be going into space, won't they?\" she asked, not looking at\nhim. \"If there are colonies on the other planets, they'll have to. And\nsome day--to the stars....\"\n\nShe stood quite still, and Joe wanted to do something about her and the\nworld and the way he felt. The interior of the Platform was very silent.\nSomewhere far away where the glass-wool insulation was incomplete, the\nsound of workmen was audible, but the inner corridors of the Platform\nwere not resonant. They were lined with a material to destroy reminders\nthat this was merely a metal shell, an artificial world that would swim\nin emptiness. Here and now, Joe and Sally seemed very private and alone,\nand he felt a sense of urgency.\n\nHe looked at her yearningly. Her color was a little higher than usual.\nShe was not just a nice kid, she was swell! And she was good to look at.\nJoe had noticed that before, but now with the memory of her fright\nbecause he'd been in danger, her worry because he might have been\nkilled, he thought of her very absurd but honest offer to cry for him.\n\nJoe found himself twisting at the ring on his finger. He got it off, and\nthere was some soot and grease on it from the work he'd been doing. He\nknew that she saw what he was about, but she looked away.\n\n\"Look, Sally,\" he said awkwardly, \"we've known each other a long time.\nI've--uh--liked you a lot. And I've got some things to do first,\nbut----\" He stopped. He swallowed. She turned and smiled at him. \"Look,\"\nhe said desperately, \"what's a good way to ask if you'd like to wear\nthis?\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes shining a little.\n\n\"That was a good way, Joe. I'd like it a lot.\"\n\nThere was an interlude, then, during which she very ridiculously cried\nand explained that he must be more careful and not risk his life so\nmuch! And then there was a faint, faint sound outside the Platform. It\nwas the yapping sound of a siren, crying out in short and choppy\nululations as it warmed up. Finally its note steadied and it wailed and\nwailed and wailed.\n\n\"That's the alarm,\" exclaimed Sally. She was still misty-eyed.\n\"Everybody out of the Shed. Come on, Joe.\"\n\nThey started back the way they'd come in. And Sally looked up at Joe and\ngrinned suddenly.\n\n\"When I have grandchildren,\" she told him, \"I'm going to brag that I was\nthe very first girl in all the world ever to be kissed in a space ship!\"\n\nBut before Joe could do anything about the comment, she was out on the\nstairs, in plain view and going down. So he followed her.\n\nThe Shed was emptying. The bare wood-block floor was dotted with figures\nmoving steadily toward the security exit. There was no hurry, because\nsecurity men were shouting that this was not an alarm but a\nprecautionary measure, and there was no need for haste. Each security\nman had been informed by the miniature walkie-talkie he wore. By it\nevery guard could be told anything he needed to know, either on the\nfloor of the Shed, or on the catwalks aloft or even in the Platform\nitself.\n\nTrucks lined up in orderly fashion to go out the swing-up doors. Men\ncame down from the scaffolds after putting their tools in proper\nbetween-shifts positions--for counting and inspection--and other men\nwere streaming quietly from the pushpot assembly line. Except for the\ngigantic object in the middle, and for the fact that every man was in\nwork clothes, the scene was surprisingly like the central waiting room\nof a very large railroad station, with innumerable people moving briskly\nhere and there.\n\n\"No hurry,\" said Joe, catching the word from a security man as he passed\nit on. \"I'll go see what my gang found out.\"\n\nThe trio--Haney and Mike and the Chief--were just arriving by the piles\nof charred but now uncovered wreckage. Sally flushed ever so slightly\nwhen she saw the Chief eye Joe's ring on her finger.\n\n\"Rest of the day off, huh?\" said the Chief. \"Look! We found most of the\nstuff we need. They're gonna give us a shop to work in. We'll move this\nstuff there. We're gonna have to weld a false frame on the lathe we\npicked, an' then cut out the bed plate to let the gyros fit in between\nthe chucks. Mount it so the spinning is in the right line.\"\n\nThat would be with the axis of the rotors parallel to the axis of the\nearth. Joe nodded.\n\n\"We'll be able to get set up in the mornin',\" added Haney, \"and get\nstarted. You got the parts list off to the plant for your folks to get\nbusy on?\"\n\nSally said quickly: \"He's sending that by facsimile now. Then----\"\n\nThe Chief beamed in benign mockery. \"What you goin' to do after that,\nJoe? If we got the rest of the day off----?\"\n\nSally said hurriedly: \"We were--he was going off on a picnic with me. To\nRed Canyon Lake. Do you really need to talk business--all afternoon?\"\n\nThe Chief laughed. He'd known Sally, at least by sight, back at the\nKenmore plant.\n\n\"No, ma'am!\" he told her. \"Just askin'. I worked on that Red Canyon dam\njob, years back. That dam that made the lake. It ought to be right\npretty around there now. Okay, Joe. See you as soon as work starts up.\nIn the mornin', most likely.\"\n\nJoe started away with Sally. Mike the midget called hoarsely: \"Joe! Just\na minute!\"\n\nJoe drew back. The midget's seamed face was very earnest. He said in his\nodd voice: \"Here's something to think about. Somebody worked mighty hard\nto keep you from getting those gyros here. They might work hard to keep\nthem from getting repaired. That's why we asked for a special shop to\nwork in. It's occurred to me that a good way to stop these repairs would\nbe to stop us. Not everybody would've figured out how to rebalance this\nthing. You get me?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Joe. \"You three had better look out for yourselves.\"\n\nMike stared at him and grimaced.\n\n\"You don't get it,\" he said brittlely. \"All right. I may be crazy, at\nthat.\"\n\nJoe rejoined Sally. The idea of a picnic was brand new to him, but he\napproved of it completely. They went to the small exit that led to the\nsecurity building. They were admitted. There was remarkable calm and\nefficiency here, even though routine had been upset by the need to stop\nall work. As they went toward Major Holt's office, Joe heard somebody\ndictating in a matter-of-fact voice: \"... this attempt at atomic\nsabotage was defeated outside the Shed, but it never had a chance of\nsuccess. Geiger counters would have instantly shown any attempt to\nsmuggle radioactive material into the Shed....\"\n\nJoe glanced sidewise at Sally.\n\n\"That's for a publicity release?\" he asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"It's true, too. Nothing goes in or out of the Shed without passing\nclose to a Geiger counter. Even radium-dial watches show up, though they\ndon't set the sirens to screaming.\"\n\nJoe said: \"I'll get my order for new parts off on the facsimile\nmachine.\"\n\nBut he had to get Major Holt's secretary to show him where to feed in\nthe list. It would go east to the nearest facsimile receiver, and then\nbe rushed by special messenger to the plant. Miss Ross gloomily set the\nmachine and initialed the delivery requisition which was part of the\ndocument. It flashed through the scanning process and came out again.\n\n\"You and Sally,\" remarked Sally's father's secretary with a morose sigh,\n\"can go and relax this afternoon. But there's no relaxation for Major\nHolt. Or for me.\"\n\nJoe said unhopefully: \"I'm sure Sally'd be glad if you came with us.\"\n\nMajor Holt's plain, unglamorous assistant shook her head.\n\n\"I haven't had a day off since the work began here,\" she said frowning.\n\"The Major depends on me. Nobody else could do what I do! You're going\nto Red Canyon Lake?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Joe. \"Sally thought it might be pleasant.\"\n\n\"It's terribly dry and arid here,\" said Miss Ross sadly. \"That's the\nonly body of water in a hundred miles or more. I hope it's pretty there.\nI've never seen it.\"\n\nShe handed Joe back his original memo from the facsimile machine. An\nexact copy of his written list, in his handwriting, was now in existence\nmore than fifteen hundred miles away, and would arrive at the Kenmore\nPrecision Tool plant within a matter of hours. There could be no\nquestion of errors in transmission! It had to be right!\n\nSally came out, smiled at her father's secretary, and led Joe down to\nthe entrance.\n\n\"I have the car,\" she said cheerfully, \"and there'll be a lunch basket\nwaiting for us at the house. I agreed that the lake was too cold for\nswimming, though. It is. Snow water feeds it. But it's nice to look at.\"\n\nThey went out the door, and the workers on the Platform were just\nbeginning to pile into the waiting fleet of busses. But the black car\nwas waiting, too. Joe opened the door and Sally handed him the key. She\nregarded the men swarming on the busses.\n\n\"There'll be bulletins all over Bootstrap,\" she observed, \"saying that\nBraun tried to dust-bomb the Shed. They'll say that he may have carried\nthe cobalt about with him, and so he may have burned other people--in a\nrestaurant, a movie theater, anywhere--while he was carrying the dust\nand dying without knowing it. So everybody's supposed to report to the\nhospital for a check-up for radiation burns. Some people may really have\nthem. But Dad thinks that since you weren't burned, Braun didn't carry\nit around. If anyone is burned, it'll be the person who brought the\ncobalt here to give him. And--well--he'll turn up because everybody\ndoes, and because he's burned he'll be asked plenty of questions.\"\n\nJoe stepped on the starter. Then he pressed the accelerator and the car\nsped forward.\n\nThey stopped at the house in the officers'-quarters area on the other\nside of the Shed. Sally picked up the lunch basket that her father's\nhousekeeper had packed on telephoned instructions. They drove away.\n\nRed Canyon was eighty miles from the Shed, and the only way to get there\nwas through Bootstrap, because the only highway away from the Shed led\nto that small, synthetic town. It was irritating, though they had no\nschedule, to find that the long line of busses was ahead of them on that\ntwenty-mile stretch. The busses ran nose to tail and filled the road for\na half-mile or more. It was not possible to pass so long a string of\nclose-packed vehicles. There was just enough traffic in the opposite\ndirection to make that impracticable.\n\nThey had to trail the line of busses as far as Bootstrap and crawl\nthrough the crowded streets. Once beyond the town they came to a\nsecurity stop. Here Sally's pass was good. Then they went rolling on and\non through an empty, arid, sun-baked terrain toward the hills to the\nwest. It looked remarkably lonely. Joe thought for the first time about\ngas. He looked carefully at the fuel gauge. Sally shook her head.\n\n\"Don't worry. Plenty of gas. Security takes care of that. When I said\nwhere we were going and that I wanted the car, Dad had everything\nchecked. If I live through this, I'll bet I stay a fanatic about\ncautiousness all my life!\"\n\nJoe said distastefully: \"I suppose it gets everybody. Mike--the midget,\nyou know--called me back just now to suggest that the people who tried\nto spoil the gyros might try to harm the four of us to hinder their\nrepair!\"\n\n\"It's not just foolishness,\" Sally admitted. \"The strain is pretty bad,\nespecially when you know things. You've noticed that Dad's getting gray.\nThat's strain. And Miss Ross is about as tense. Things leak out in the\nmost remarkable way--and Dad can't find out how. Once there was a case\nof sabotage and he could have sworn that nobody had the information that\npermitted it but himself and Miss Ross. She had hysterics. She insisted\nthat she wanted to be locked up somewhere so she couldn't be suspected\nof telling anybody anything. She'd resign tomorrow if she could. It's\nghastly.\" Then she hesitated and smiled faintly: \"In fact, so Dad\nwouldn't worry about me this afternoon----\"\n\nHe took his eyes off the road to glance at her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I promised we wouldn't go swimming and----\" Then she said awkwardly:\n\"There are two pistols in the glove compartment. Dad knows you. So I\npromised you'd put one in your pocket up at the lake.\"\n\nJoe drew a deep breath. She opened the glove compartment and handed him\na pistol. He looked at it: .38, hammerless. A good safe weapon. He\nslipped it in his coat pocket. But he frowned.\n\n\"I was looking forward to--not worrying for a while,\" he said wryly.\n\"But now I'll have to remember to keep looking over my shoulder all the\ntime!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Sally, \"you can look over my shoulder and I'll look over\nyours, and we can glance at each other occasionally.\"\n\nShe laughed, and he managed to smile. But the trace of a frown remained\non his forehead.\n\nJoe drove and drove and drove. Once they came to a very small town. It\nmay have contained a hundred people. There were gas pumps and a\nrestaurant and two or three general stores, which were certainly too\nmany for the permanent residents. But there were cow ponies hitched\nbefore the stores, and automobiles were also in view. The ground here\nwas slightly rolling. The mountains had grown to good-sized ramparts\nagainst the sky. Joe drove carefully down the single street, turning out\nwidely once to dodge a dog sleeping placidly in an area normally\nreserved for traffic.\n\nFinally they came to the foothills, and then the road curved and\nrecurved as it wound among them. And two hours from Bootstrap they\nreached Red Canyon. They first saw the dam from downstream. It was a\nmonstrous structure of masonry, alone in the mountains. From its top a\nplume of falling water jetted out.\n\n\"The dam's for irrigation,\" said Sally professionally, \"and the Shed\ngets all its power from here. One of Dad's nightmares is that somebody\nmay blow up this dam and leave Bootstrap and the Shed without power.\"\n\nJoe said nothing. He drove on up the trail as it climbed the canyon wall\nin hairpin slants. It was ticklish driving. But then, quite suddenly,\nthey reached the top of the canyon wall and the top of the dam and the\nlevel of the lake at once. Here there was a sheet of water that reached\nback among the barren hillsides for miles and miles. It twisted out of\nsight. There were small waves on its surface, and grass at its edge.\nThere were young trees. The powerhouse was a small squat structure in\nthe middle of the dam. Not a person was visible anywhere.\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Sally, when Joe stopped the car.\n\nHe got out and went around to open the door for her. But she was already\nstepping out with the lunch basket in her hand when he arrived. He\nreached for it, and she held on, and they moved companionably away from\nthe car carrying the basket between them.\n\n\"There's a nice place,\" said Sally, pointing.\n\nA small ridge of rock stretched out into the lake, and rose, and spread,\nand formed what was almost a miniature island some fifty feet across.\nThere were some young trees on it. Sally and Joe climbed down the slope\nand out the rocky isthmus that connected it with the shore.\n\nSally let down the lunch box on a stone and laughed for no reason at all\nas the wind blew her hair. It was a cool wind from over the water. And\nJoe realized with a shock of surprise that the air felt different and\nsmelled different when it blew over open water like this. Up to now he\nhadn't thought of the dryness of the air in Bootstrap and the Shed.\n\nThe lunch basket was tilted a little. Joe picked it up and settled it\nmore solidly. Then he said: \"Hungry?\"\n\nThere was literally nothing on his mind at the moment but the luxurious,\nsatisfied feeling of being off somewhere with grass and a lake and\nSally, and a good part of the afternoon to throw away. It felt good. So\nhe lifted the lid of the lunch basket.\n\nThere was a revolver there. It was the other one from the glove\ncompartment of the car. Sally hadn't left it behind. Joe regarded it and\nsaid ironically: \"Happy, carefree youth--that's us! Which are the ham\nsandwiches, Sally?\"\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nNevertheless, the afternoon began splendidly. Joe dunked the bottled\nsoft drinks in the lake to cool. Then he and Sally ate and talked and\nlaughed. Joe, in particular, had more than the usual capacity for\nenjoyment today. He'd been through twenty-four hours of turmoil but now\nthings began to look better. And there was the arrangement with Sally,\nwhich had a solid satisfactoriness about it. Sally was swell! If she'd\nbeen homely, Joe would have liked her just the same--to talk to and to\nbe with. But she was pretty--and she was wearing his ring. She'd wrapped\nsome string around the inside of the band to make it fit.\n\nThe only trouble was that Joe was occasionally conscious of the heavy\nweight in his right-hand coat pocket.\n\nBut they spent at least an hour in contented, satisfying, meaningless\nloafing that nobody can describe but that everybody likes to remember\nafterward. From time to time Joe looked ashore, when the weight in his\npocket reminded him of danger.\n\nBut he didn't look often enough. He was pulling the chilled soft-drink\nbottles out of the lake when he saw a movement out of the corner of his\neye. He whirled, his hand in his pocket....\n\nIt was the Chief, with Haney and Mike the midget. They were striding\nacross the rocky small peninsula.\n\nHaney called sharply: \"Everything okay?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" said Joe. \"Everything's fine! What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Mike had a hunch,\" said the Chief. \"And--uh--I remembered I worked on\nthe job when this dam was built twelve-fifteen years ago.\" He looked\nabout him. \"It looked different then.\"\n\nThen he caught Joe's eye and jerked his head almost imperceptibly to one\nside. Joe caught the signal.\n\n\"I'll see about some more soft drinks,\" he said. \"Come help me fish up\nthe bottles.\"\n\nSally smiled at the other two. She was already inspecting the lunch\nbasket.\n\n\"We still have some sandwiches,\" she said hospitably, \"and some cake.\"\n\nHaney came forward awkwardly. Mike advanced toward her with something of\ntruculence. Joe knew what was in his mind. If Sally treated him like a\nfreak.... But Joe knew with deep satisfaction that she wouldn't. He went\ndown to the water's edge.\n\n\"What's up, Chief?\" he asked in a low tone.\n\n\"Mike hadda hunch,\" rumbled the Chief. \"Somebody tried to smash the\nstuff you brought. They did. But we started gettin' set to mend it. So\nwhat would they do? Polish us off. If they were set to atom-dust the\nwhole Shed an' everybody in it, they wouldn't stop at four more\nmurders.\"\n\nJoe fished for a pop bottle.\n\n\"Mike said something like that back at the Shed,\" he observed.\n\n\"Yeah. But you were the one who figured things out. You'd be first\ntarget. Haney and Mike and me--we'd be hard to knock off in a crowd in\nBootstrap. But you and her headed off by y'selves. Mike figured you\nmightn't be safe. So we checked.\"\n\nJoe brought up one bottle and then another.\n\n\"We're all right. Haven't seen a soul.\"\n\n\"Don't mean a soul hasn't seen you,\" growled the Chief. \"A car left\nBootstrap less than twenty minutes behind you. There were three guys in\nit. It's parked down below the dam, outa sight. We saw it. And when we\ncame up, careful, we spotted three guys hidin' out behind the rocks\nyonder. They look to me like they're waiting for somebody to go\nstrolling back from the shoreline, so's--uh--maybe folks out at the\npowerhouse can't see 'em. That'd be you and her, huh?\"\n\nJoe went cold. Not for himself. For Sally.\n\n\"There's nobody else around,\" said the Chief. \"Who'd they be waiting for\nbut you two? Suppose they got a chance to kill you. They'd take the car\nkeys. They'd drop your two bodies somewheres Gawdknowswhere. There'd be\nconsiderable of a hunt for you two. Major Holt would be upset plenty.\nSecurity might get loosened up. There might be breaks for guys who\nwanted to do a little extra sabotage--besides maybe hamperin' the\nrepairin' of the pilot gyros. Then they could try for Haney and Mike and\nme.\"\n\nJoe said coldly: \"I've got a pistol and so has Sally. Shall we take\nthose pistols and go ask those three if they want to start something?\"\n\nThe Chief snorted.\n\n\"Use sense! It's good you got the pistols, though. I snagged a\ntwenty-two rifle from a shooting gallery. It was all I could get in a\nhurry. But go huntin' trouble? Fella, I want to see that Platform go up!\nI'll take care of things now. Good layout here. They got to come across\nthe open to get near. Don't say anything to Sally. But we'll keep our\neyes open.\"\n\nJoe nodded. He carried the chilled, dripping bottles back to where Haney\nsolemnly ate a sandwich, sitting crosslegged with his back to the lake\nand regarding the shore. The Chief dragged a .22 repeating rifle from\ninside his belt, where it had hung alongside his thigh. He casually\nstrolled over to Mike and dropped the rifle.\n\n\"You said you felt like target practice,\" he remarked blandly. \"Here's\nyour armament. Any more sandwiches, ma'am?\"\n\nSally smilingly passed him the last. She left the top of the basket\nopen. The pistol that had been there was gone. Then Sally's eyes met\nJoe's and she was aware that his three friends had not come here merely\nto crash a picnic. But she took it in stride. It was an additional\nreason for Joe to approve of Sally.\n\n\"Me,\" said the Chief largely, \"I'm goin' to swim. I haven't had any more\nwater around me than a shower bath for so long that I crave to soak and\nsplash. I'll go yonder and dunk myself.\"\n\nHe wandered off, taking bites from the sandwich as he went. He vanished.\nHaney leaned back against a sapling, his eyes roving about the shoreline\nand the rocks and brush behind it.\n\nMike was talking in his crackling, high-pitched voice.\n\n\"But just the same it's crazy! Fighting sabotage when we little guys\ncould take over in a week and make sabotage just plain foolish! We could\ndo the whole job while the saboteurs weren't looking!\"\n\nSally said with interest: \"Have you got the figures? Were they ever\npassed on?\"\n\n\"I spent a month's pay once,\" said Mike sardonically, \"hiring a math\nshark to go over them. He found one mistake. It raised the margin of\nwhat we could do!\"\n\nSally answered: \"Joe! Listen to this! Mike says he has the real answer\nto sabotage, and, in a way, to space travel! Listen!\"\n\nJoe dropped to the ground.\n\n\"Shoot it,\" he said.\n\nHe was grimly alert, just the same. There were men waiting for them to\nstart back to the car. These saboteurs were armed, and they intended to\nmurder Sally and himself. Joe's jaws clamped tautly shut at the grim\nideas that came into his mind.\n\nBut Mike was beginning to speak.\n\n\"Forget about the Platform a minute,\" he said, standing up to\ngesticulate, because he was only three and a half feet high. \"Just\nfigure on a rocket straight to the moon. With old-style rockets they'd\na' had to have a mass ratio of a hundred and twenty to one. You'd have\nto burn a hundred and twenty tons of old-style fuel to land one ton on\nthe moon. Now it could be done with sixty, and when the Platform's up,\nthat figure'll drop again! Okay! You're gonna land a man on the moon. He\nweighs two hundred pounds. He uses up twenty pounds of food and drink\nand oxygen a day. Give him grub and air for two months--twelve hundred\npounds. A cabin seven feet high and ten feet across. Sixteen hundred\npounds, counting insulation an' braces for strength. That makes a pay\nload of a ton an' a half, and you'd have to burn a hundred an' eighty\ntons of fuel--old-style--to take it to the moon, and another hundred an'\ntwenty for every ton the rocket ship weighed. You might get a man to the\nmoon with a twelve-hundred-ton rocket--maybe. That's with the old fuels.\nHe'd get there, an' he'd live two months, an' then he'd die for lack of\nair. With the new fuels you'd need ninety tons of fuel to carry the guy\nthere, and sixty more for every ton the ship weighed itself. Call it six\nhundred tons for the rocket to carry one man to the moon.\"\n\nSally nodded absorbedly.\n\n\"I've seen figures like that,\" she agreed.\n\n\"But take a guy like me!\" said Mike the midget bitterly. \"I weigh\nforty-five pounds, not two hundred! I use four pounds of food and air a\nday. A cabin for me to live in would be four feet high an' five across.\nBein' smaller, it wouldn't need so much bracing. You could do it for two\nhundred pounds. Three hundred for grub and air, fifty for me. Me on the\nmoon supplied for two months would come to five-fifty pounds. Sixteen\ntons of fuel to get me to the moon direct! To carry the weight of the\nship--it's smaller!--fifty tons maximum!\"\n\n\"I--see...,\" said Sally, frowning.\n\nHe looked at her suspiciously, but there was no mockery in her face.\n\n\"It'd take a six-hundred-ton rocket to get a full-sized man to the\nmoon,\" he said with sudden flippancy, \"but a guy my size could do the\nsame job of stranglin' in a fifty-ton job. Counting how much easier it'd\nbe to get back, with atmosphere deceleration, I could make a trip, land,\ntake observations, pick up mineral specimens, and get back--all in a\nsixty-ton rocket. That's just ten per cent of what it'd cost to take a\nfull-sized man one way!\"\n\nHe stamped his foot. Then he said coldly: \"Haney, sittin' still you're a\nsittin' duck!\"\n\nThe comment was just. Joe knew that Sally was on the lakeward side of\nthis small island, and that there were impenetrable rocks between her\nand the mainland. But Haney sat crosslegged where he could watch the\nmainland, and he hadn't moved in a long while. If someone did intend to\ncommit murder from a distance, Haney was offering a chance for a very\nfine target. He moved.\n\n\"Yeah!\" said Mike with fine irony, reverting to his topic. \"I could show\nyou plenty of figures! There are other guys like me! We've got as much\nbrains as full-sized people! If the big brass had figured on us small\nguys, they coulda made the Platform the size of a four-family house an'\nit'd ha' been up in the sky right now, with guys like me running it.\nGuys my size could man the ferry rockets bringin' up fuel for storage,\nand four of us could take a six-hundred-ton rocket an' slide out to Mars\nan' be back by springtime--next springtime!--with all the facts and the\nphotographs to prove 'em! By golly----\"\n\nThen he made a raging, helpless gesture.\n\n\"But that's just the big picture,\" he said bitterly. \"Right now, right\nat this minute, we could make it easy to finish the Platform the way\nit's building in the Shed! There are ferry rockets building somewhere\nelse. You know about them?\"\n\nSally said apologetically: \"Yes. I know there'll be smaller rocket ships\ngoing up to the Platform. They'll carry fuel and stores and exchanges\nfor the crew. Yes, I know there are ferry rockets building.\"\n\n\"Those ferry rockets,\" said Mike sardonically, \"carry four men, plus two\nreplacements for the crew. They'll carry air for ten days. But put four\nof us small guys in a ferry rocket! _We'd_ have air and grub for two\nmonths, almost! Pull out the pay load and put in a hydroponic garden and\ncommunicators and we'd _be_ a Platform, right then! Send up another\nferry rocket to join us, and it could bring guided missiles! The ferry\nrockets could be finished quicker than the Platform! Send up three ferry\nrockets with midgets as crews, an' we could weld 'em together and have a\nSpace Platform in orbit and working--and what'd be the use of sabotaging\nthe big Platform then? The job would be done! There'd be no sense\nsabotaging the big Platform because the little one could do anything the\nbig one could! It'd be up there and working! But,\" he demanded bitterly,\n\"do you think anybody'll do anything as sensible as that?\"\n\nHis small features were twisted in angry rebellion. And he was quite\nright in all his reasoning. Mankind could have made the journey to the\nplanets in a hurry, and it could have had its Space Platform in the sky\nmuch more quickly, if only it could have consented to be represented by\npeople like Mike--who would have represented mankind very valiantly.\n\nSally said distressedly: \"Oh, Mike, it's all true and I'm so sorry!\"\n\nAnd she meant it. Joe liked Sally especially right then, because she\ndidn't patronize Mike, or try to reason him out of his heartbreak.\n\nThen Haney said abruptly: \"Somebody's spotted the Chief.\"\n\nJoe mentally kicked himself. The Chief had said he was going to swim.\nNow--but only now--Joe looked to see what he was doing.\n\nHe was far out from shore, swimming unhurriedly to the powerhouse at the\nmiddle of the dam. He would reach it, and swing up the ladder that could\njust be seen going down the lake side of the dam's top, and he would\nexplain the situation on shore. A telephone call to Bootstrap would\nbring security men rushing at eighty miles an hour, and parachute\ntroopers a good deal faster. But even before they arrived the Chief\nwould lead the powerhouse crew ashore armed with the shotguns they kept\nfor shooting waterfowl in and out of season.\n\nThe men on shore might or might not consider the Chief's swim to be\nproof that he knew their intentions. They were probably discussing the\nmatter in some agitation right now. But they couldn't know that the\nparty on the semi-island was armed.\n\nSuddenly Mike said crisply: \"We're goin' to have visitors.\"\n\nHe lay down carefully on the ground, fifteen feet uphill from Sally,\nwhere he could look over the ridge. He snuggled the .22 target rifle\nprofessionally to his shoulder. He drew a bead.\n\nThree men very casually strolled out of the brushwood on the shore. They\nmoved nonchalantly toward the strand of rocks that led out to the picnic\nspot. They looked like anybody else from Bootstrap. Casual, rough work\nclothing.... Haney bent down and picked up four good throwing stones.\nHis expression was pained.\n\nJoe said: \"We've got pistols, Haney, and Sally's a good shot.\"\n\nThe men came on. Their manner was elaborately casual. Joe stepped up\ninto view.\n\n\"No visitors!\" he called. \"We don't want company!\"\n\nOne of the men held his hand to his ear, as if not understanding. They\ncame on. They made no threatening gestures.\n\nThen Joe took his hand out of his pocket, the pistol Sally'd given him\ngripped tightly.\n\n\"I mean that!\" he said harshly. \"Stand back!\"\n\nOne of the three spoke sharply. On that instant three snub-nosed pistols\nappeared. Bullets whined as the men hurtled forward. The purpose was not\nso much murder at this moment as the demoralizing effect of bullets\nflying overhead while the three assassins got close enough to do their\nbloody job with precision.\n\nA stone whizzed by Joe--Haney had thrown it--and the small target rifle\nin Mike's hands coughed twice. Joe held his fire. He had only six\nbullets and three targets to hit. With a familiar revolver he'd have\nstarted shooting now, but thirty yards is a long range with a strange\npistol at a moving target.\n\nOne of the three killers stumbled and crashed to the ground. A second\nseemed suddenly to be grinning widely on one side of his face. A .22\nbullet had slashed his cheek. The third ran head on into a rock thrown\nby Haney. It knocked the breath out of him and his pistol fell from his\nhand.\n\nJoe fired deliberately at the widely grinning man and saw him spin\naround. Mike's target rifle spat again and the man Joe had hit wheeled\nand ran heavily, making incoherent yells. The one who'd tumbled\nscrambled to his feet and fled, hopping crazily, favoring one leg.\nDeserted, the third man turned and ran too, still doubled over and still\ngasping.\n\nMike's voice crackled. He was in a towering rage because of the way the\ntarget rifle shot. It threw high and to the right. The shooting gallery\npaid off in cigarettes for high scores--so the guns didn't shoot\nstraight.\n\nUntil this moment Joe had been relatively calm, because he had something\nto do. But just then he heard Sally say \"Oh!\" in a queer voice. He\nwhirled. Unknown to him, she had not been waiting under cover, but\nstanding with her pistol out and ready. And her face was very white, and\nshe was plucking at her hair. A strand came away in her fingers. A\nbullet had clipped it just above her shoulder.\n\nThen Joe went sick ... weak ... trembling, and he disgraced himself by\nhalf-hysterically grabbing Sally and demanding to know if she was hurt,\nand raging at her for exposing herself to fire, while his throat tried\nto close and shut off his breath from horror.\n\nThere came loud pop-pop-popping noises. With the peculiar reverberation\nof sound over water, two motorcycles started from the powerhouse along\nthe crest of the dam. They streaked for the shore carrying five men, one\nof whom was the Chief, with a red-checked tablecloth about his middle,\nbrandishing a fire axe in default of other weapons.\n\nThe danger was over.\n\nBut the assassins couldn't be followed immediately. They still had at\nleast two pistols. Eight men and a girl, counting Mike, with an armament\nof only two pistols, a .22 rifle, two shotguns and a fire axe were not a\nproperly equipped posse to hunt down killers. Also by now it was close\nto sunset.\n\nSo the victors did the sensible thing. Joe and Sally and Haney and the\nChief--his clothes retrieved--plus Mike headed back for Bootstrap. Joe\nand Sally rode in the Major's black car, and the other three in the\njalopy they'd rented for the afternoon. On the way into the canyon below\nthe dam, they stopped at the parked car their would-be assassins had\ncome in. They removed its distributor and fan belt. The other men\nreturned to the powerhouse with their shotguns and the fire axe, and\ntelephoned to Bootstrap. The three gunmen who had planned murder became\nfugitives, with no means of transportation but their legs. They had a\ngood many thousand square miles of territory to hide in, but it wasn't\nlikely that they had food or any competence to find it in the wilds. Two\nwere certainly hurt. With dogs and planes and organization, it should be\npossible to catch them handily, come morning.\n\nSo Joe and Sally drove back to Bootstrap with the other car following\nclosely through all the miles that had to be covered in the dark.\nHalfway back, they met a grim search party in cars, heading for the dam\nto begin their man hunt in the morning. After that, Joe felt better. But\nhis teeth still tended to chatter every time he thought of Sally's\nstartled, scared expression as she pulled away a lock of her hair that\nhad been severed by a bullet.\n\nWhen they got back to the Shed, Major Holt looked tired and old. Sally\nexplained breathlessly that her danger was her own fault. Joe'd thought\nshe was safely under cover....\n\n\"It was my fault,\" said the Major detachedly. \"I let you go away from\nthe Shed. I do not blame Joe at all.\"\n\nBut he did not look kindly. Joe wet his lips, ready to agree that any\ndisgrace he might be subjected to was justified, since he had caused\nSally to be shot at.\n\n\"I blame myself a great deal, sir,\" he said grimly. \"But I can promise\nI'll never take Sally away from safety again. Not until the Platform's\nup and there's no more reason for her to be in danger.\"\n\nThe Major said remotely: \"I shall have to arrange for more than that. I\nshall put you in touch with your father by telephone. You will explain\nto him, in detail, exactly how the repair of your apparatus is planned.\nI understand that the gyros can be duplicated more quickly by the method\nyou have worked out?\"\n\nJoe said: \"Yes, sir. The balancing of the gyros can, which was the\nlongest single job. But anything can be made quicker the second time.\nThe patterns for the castings are all made, and the bugs worked out of\nthe production process.\"\n\n\"You will explain that to your father,\" said the Major heavily. \"Your\nfather's plant will begin to duplicate these--ah--pilot gyros at once.\nMeanwhile your--ah--work crew will start to repair the one that is\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And,\" said the Major, \"I am sending you to the pushpot airfield. I\nintend to scatter the targets the saboteurs might aim at. You are one of\nthem. Your crew is another. From time to time you will confer with them\nand verify their work. If any of them should be--disposed of, you will\nbe able to instruct others.\"\n\n\"It's really the other way about, sir,\" objected Joe. \"The Chief and\nHaney are pretty good, and Mike's got brains----\"\n\nThe Major moved impatiently.\n\n\"I am looking at this from a security standpoint,\" he said. \"I am trying\nto make it plainly useless to attack the gyros again. Duplicates will be\nin production at your father's plant. There will be three men repairing\nthe smashed ones. There will be another man in another place--and this\nwill be you--who can instruct new workmen in the repair procedure if\nanything should happen. Thus there will have to be three separate\nsuccessful coups if the pilot gyros are not to be ready when the\nPlatform needs them. Saboteurs might try one. Possibly two. But I think\nthey will look for another weak spot to attack.\"\n\nJoe did not like the idea of being moved away. He wanted to be on the\njob repairing the device that was primarily his responsibility. Besides,\nhe had a feeling about Sally. If she were in danger, he wanted to be on\nhand.\n\n\"About Sally, sir----\"\n\n\"Sally,\" said the Major tiredly, \"is going to have to restrict herself\nto the point where she'll feel that jail would be preferable. But she\nwill see the need for it. She will be guarded a good deal more carefully\nthan before--and you may not know it, but she has been guarded rather\nwell.\"\n\nJoe saw Sally smiling ruefully at him. What the Major had said was\nunpleasant, but he was right. This was one of those arrangements that\nnobody likes, an irritating, uncomfortable, disappointing necessity. But\nsuch necessities are a part of every actual achievement. The difference\nbetween things that get done and things that don't get done is often\nmerely the difference between patience and impatience with tedious\ndetails. This arrangement would mean that Joe couldn't see Sally very\noften. It would mean that the Chief and Haney and Mike would do the\nactual work of getting the gyros ready. It would take all the glamour\nout of Joe's contribution. These deprivations shouldn't be necessary.\nBut they were.\n\n\"All right, sir,\" said Joe gloomily. \"When do I go over to the field?\"\n\n\"Right away,\" said the Major. \"Tonight.\" Then he added detachedly:\n\"Officially, the excuse for your presence there will be that you have\nbeen useful in uncovering sabotage methods. You have. After all, through\nyou a number of planes that would have been blown up have now had their\nbooby traps removed. I know you do not claim credit for the fact, but it\nis an excuse for keeping you where I want you to be for another reason\nentirely. So it will be assumed that you are at the pushpot field for\ncounter-sabotage inspection.\"\n\nThe Major nodded dismissal with an indefinable air of irony, and Joe\nwent unhappily out of his office. He telephoned his father at length.\nHis father did not share Joe's disappointment at being removed to a\nplace of safety. He undertook to begin the castings for an entire new\nset of pilot gyros at once.\n\nA little later Sally came out of her father's office.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Joe!\"\n\nHe grinned unhappily.\n\n\"So am I. I don't feel very heroic, but if this is what has to be done\nto get the Platform out of the Shed and on the way up--it's what has to\nbe done. I suppose I can phone you?\"\n\n\"You can,\" said Sally. \"And you'd better!\"\n\nThey had talked a long time that afternoon, very satisfyingly and\nwithout any cares at all. Neither could have remembered much of what had\nbeen said. It probably was not earth-shaking in importance. But now\nthere seemed to be a very great deal of other similar conversation\nurgently needing to be gone through.\n\n\"I'll call you!\" said Joe.\n\nThen somebody approached to take him to the pushpot airfield. They\nseparated very formally under the eyes of the impersonal security\nofficer who would drive Joe to his destination.\n\nIt was a tedious journey through the darkness. This particular security\nofficer was not companionable. He was one of those conscientious people\nwho think that if they keep their mouths shut it will make up for their\ninability to keep their eyes open. Socially he treated Joe as if he were\na highly suspect person. It could be guessed that he treated everybody\nthat way.\n\nJoe went to sleep in the car.\n\nHe was only half-awake when he arrived, and he didn't bother to rouse\nhimself completely when he was shown to a cubbyhole in the officers'\nbarracks. He went to bed, making a half-conscious note to buy himself\nsome clothes--especially fresh linen--in the morning.\n\nThen he knew nothing until he was awaked in the early morning by what\nsounded exactly like the crack of doom.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nIt was not, however, the crack of doom. When Joe stared out the window\nby the head of his cot, he saw gray-red dawn breaking over the landing\nfield. There were low, featureless structures silhouetted against the\nsunrise. As the crimson light grew brighter, Joe realized that the\nangular shapes were hangars. Improbable crane poles loomed above them.\nOne was in motion, handling something he could not make out, but the\nnoise that had awakened him was less, now. It seemed to circle overhead,\nand it had an angry, droning, buzzing quality that was not natural in\nany motor he had ever heard before.\n\nJoe shivered, standing at the window. It was cold and dank in the dawn\nlight at this altitude, but he wanted to know what that completely\nunbelievable roar had been. A crane beam by the hangars tilted down,\nslowly, and then lifted as if released of a great weight. The light was\ngrowing slowly brighter. Joe saw something on the ground. Rather, it was\nnot quite on the ground. It rested on something on the ground.\n\nSuddenly that unholy uproar began again. Something moved. It ran heavily\nout from the masking dark of the hangars. It picked up speed. It\nacquired a reasonable velocity--forty or fifty miles an hour. As it\nscuttled over the dimly lighted field, it made a din like all the boiler\nfactories in the world and all the backfiring motors in creation trying\nto drown each other's noise out--and all of them being very successful.\n\nIt was a pushpot. Joe recognized it with incredulity. It was one of\nthose utterly ungainly creations that were built around one half of the\nsidewall of the Shed. In shape, its upper part was like the top half of\na loaf of bread. In motion, here, it rested on some sort of wheeled\nvehicle, and it was reared up like an indignant caterpillar, and a\nblue-white flame squirted out of its tail, with coy and frolicsome\nflirtings from side to side.\n\nThe pushpot lifted from the vehicle on which it rode, and the vehicle\nput on speed and got away from under it with frantic agility. The\nvehicle swerved to one side, and Joe stared with amazed eyes at the\npushpot, some twenty feet aloft. It had a flat underside, and a topside\nthat still looked to him like the rounded top half of a loaf of baker's\nbread. It hung in the air at an angle of about forty-five degrees, and\nit howled like a panic-stricken dragon--Joe was getting his metaphors\nmixed by this time--and it swung and wobbled and slowly gained altitude,\nand then suddenly it seemed to get the knack of what it was supposed to\ndo. It started to circle around, and then it began abruptly to climb\nskyward. Until it began to climb it looked heavy and clumsy and wholly\nunimpressive. But when it climbed, it really moved!\n\nJoe found his head out the window, craning up to look at it. Its\nunearthly din took on the indignant quality of an irritated beehive. But\nit climbed! It went up without grace but with astonishing speed. And it\nwas huge, but it became lost in the red-flecked dawn sky while Joe still\ngaped.\n\nJoe flung on his clothes. He went out the door through resonant empty\ncorridors, hunting for somebody to tell him something. He blundered into\na mess hall. There were many tables, but the chairs around them were\npushed back as if used and then left behind by people in a hurry to be\nsomewhere else. There were exactly two people still visible over in a\ncorner.\n\nAnother din like the wailing of a baby volcano with a toothache. It\nbegan, and moved, and went through the series of changes that ended in a\nclimbing, droning hum. Another. Another. The launching of pushpots for\ntheir morning flight was evidently getting well under way.\n\nJoe hesitated in the nearly empty mess hall. Then he recognized the two\nseated figures. They were the pilot and co-pilot, respectively, of the\nfateful plane that had brought him to Bootstrap.\n\nHe went over to their table. The pilot nodded matter-of-factly. The\nco-pilot grinned. Both still wore bandages on their hands, which would\naccount for their remaining here.\n\n\"Fancy seeing you!\" said the co-pilot cheerfully. \"Welcome to the Hotel\nde Gink! But don't tell me you're going to fly a pushpot!\"\n\n\"I hadn't figured on it,\" admitted Joe. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"Perish forbid,\" said the co-pilot amiably. \"I tried it once, for the\ndevil of it. Those things fly with the grace of a lady elephant on ice\nskates! Did you, by any chance, notice that they haven't got any wings?\nAnd did you notice where their control surfaces were?\"\n\nJoe shook his head. He saw the remnants of ham and eggs and coffee. He\nwas hungry.\n\nThere was the uproar to be expected of a basso-profundo banshee in pain.\nAnother pushpot was taking off.\n\n\"How do I get breakfast?\" he asked.\n\nThe co-pilot pointed to a chair. He rapped sharply on a drinking glass.\nA door opened, he pointed at Joe, and the door closed.\n\n\"Breakfast coming up,\" said the co-pilot. \"Look! I know you're Joe\nKenmore. I'm Brick Talley and this is Captain--no less than\nCaptain!--Thomas J. Walton. Impressed?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said Joe. He sat down. \"What about the control surfaces on\npushpots?\"\n\n\"They're in the jet blast!\" said the co-pilot, now identified as Brick\nTalley. \"Like the V Two rockets when the Germans made 'em. Vanes in the\nexhaust blast, no kidding! Landing, and skidding in on their tails like\nthey do, they haven't speed enough to give wing flaps a grip on the air,\neven if they had wings to put wing flaps on. Those dinkuses are things\nto have bad dreams about!\"\n\nAgain, a door opened and a man in uniform with an apron in front came\nmarching in with a tray. There was tomato juice and ham and eggs and\ncoffee. He served Joe briskly and marched out again.\n\n\"That's Hotel de Gink service,\" said Talley. \"No wasted motion, no\nsloppy civilities. He was about to eat that himself, he gave it to you,\nand now he'll cook himself a double portion of everything. What are you\ndoing here, anyhow?\"\n\nJoe shrugged. It occurred to him that it would neither be wise nor\ncreditable to say that he'd been sent here to split up a target at which\nsaboteurs might shoot.\n\n\"I guess I'm attached for rations,\" he observed. \"There'll be orders\nalong about me presently, I suppose. Then I'll know what it's all\nabout.\"\n\nHe fell to on his breakfast. The thunderous noises of the pushpots\ntaking off made the mess hall quiver. Joe said between mouthfuls: \"Funny\nway for anything to take off, riding on--it looked like a truck.\"\n\n\"It is a truck,\" said Talley. \"A high-speed truck. Fifty of them\nspecially made to serve as undercarriages so pushpot pilots can\npractice. The pushpots are really only expected to work once, you know.\"\n\nJoe nodded.\n\n\"They aren't to take off,\" Talley explained. \"Not in theory. They hang\non to the Platform and heave. They go up with it, pushing. When they get\nit as high as they can, they'll shoot their jatos, let go, and come\nbumbling back home. So they have to practice getting back home and\nlanding. For practicing it doesn't matter how they get aloft. When they\nget down, a big straddle truck on caterpillar treads picks them up--they\nland in the doggonedest places, sometimes!--and brings 'em back. Then a\ncrane heaves them up on a high-speed truck and they do it all over\nagain.\"\n\nJoe considered while he ate. It made sense. The function of the pushpots\nwas to serve as the first booster stage of a multiple-stage rocket.\nTogether, they would lift the Platform off the ground and get it as high\nas their jet motors would take it traveling east at the topmost speed\nthey could manage. Then they'd fire their jatos simultaneously, and in\ndoing that they'd be acting as the second booster stage of a\nmultiple-stage rocket. Then their work would be done, and their only\nremaining purpose would be to get their pilots back to the ground alive,\nwhile the Platform on its own third stage shot out to space.\n\n\"So,\" said Talley, \"since their pilots need to practice landings, the\ntrucks get them off the ground. They go up to fifty thousand feet, just\nto give their oxygen tanks a chance to conk out on them; then they barge\naround up there a while. The advanced trainees shoot off a jato at top\nspeed. It's gauged to build them up to the speed they'll give the\nPlatform. And then if they come out of that and get back down to ground\nsafely, they uncross their fingers. A merry life those guys lead! When a\nman's made ten complete flights he retires. One flight a week thereafter\nto keep in practice only, until the big day for the Platform's take-off.\nThose guys sweat!\"\n\n\"Is it that bad?\"\n\nThe pilot grunted. The co-pilot--Talley--spread out his hands.\n\n\"It is that bad! Every so often one of them comes down untidily. There's\nsomething the matter with the motors. They've got a little too much\npower, maybe. Sometimes--occasionally--they explode.\"\n\n\"Jet motors?\" asked Joe. \"Explode? That's news!\"\n\n\"A strictly special feature,\" said Talley drily. \"Exclusive with\npushpots for the Platform. They run 'em and run 'em and run 'em, on\ntest. Nothing happens. But occasionally one blows up in flight. Once it\nhappened warming up. That was a mess! The field's been losing two pilots\na week. Lately more.\"\n\n\"It doesn't sound exactly reasonable,\" said Joe slowly. He put a last\nforkful in his mouth.\n\n\"It's also inconvenient,\" said Talley, \"for the pilots.\"\n\nThe pilot--Walton--opened his mouth.\n\n\"It'd be sabotage,\" he said curtly, \"if there was any way to do it. Four\npilots killed this week.\"\n\nHe lapsed into silence again.\n\nJoe considered. He frowned.\n\nA pushpot, outside the building, hysterically bellowed its way across\nthe runway and its noise changed and it was aloft. It went spiraling up\nand up. Joe stirred his coffee.\n\nThere were thin shoutings outside. A screaming, whistling noise! A\ncrash! Something metallic shrieked and died. Then silence.\n\nTalley, the co-pilot, looked sick. Then he said: \"Correction. It's been\nfive pushpots exploded and five pilots killed this week. It's getting a\nlittle bit serious.\" He looked sharply at Joe. \"Better drink your coffee\nbefore you go look. You won't want to, afterward.\"\n\nHe was right.\n\nJoe saw the crashed pushpot half an hour later. He found that his\nostensible assignment to the airfield for the investigation of sabotage\nwas quaintly taken at face value there. A young lieutenant solemnly\nescorted him to the spot where the pushpot had landed, only ten feet\nfrom a hangar wall. The impact had carried parts of the pushpot five\nfeet into the soil, and the splash effect had caved in the hangar\nwall-footing. There'd been a fire, which had been put out.\n\nThe ungainly flying thing was twisted and torn. Entrails of steel tubing\nwere revealed. The plastic cockpit cover was shattered. There were only\ngrisly stains where the pilot had been.\n\nThe motor had exploded. The jet motor. And jet motors do not explode.\nBut this one had. It had burst from within, and the turbine vanes of the\ncompressor section were revealed, twisted intolerably where the barrel\nof the motor was ripped away. The jagged edges of the tear testified to\nthe violence of the internal explosion.\n\nJoe looked wise and felt ill. The young lieutenant very politely looked\naway as Joe's face showed how he felt. But of course there were the\norders that said he was a sabotage expert. And Joe felt angrily that he\nwas sailing under false colors. He didn't know anything about sabotage.\nHe believed that he was probably the least qualified of anybody that\nsecurity had ever empowered to look into methods of destruction.\n\nYet, in a sense, that very fact was an advantage. A man may be set to\nwork to contrive methods of sabotage. Another man may be trained to\ncounter him. The training of the second man is essentially a study of\nhow the first man's mind works. Then it can be guessed what this\nsaboteur will think and do. But such a trained security man will often\nbe badly handicapped if he comes upon the sabotage methods of a second\nman--an entirely different saboteur who thinks in a new fashion. The\nsecurity man may be hampered in dealing with the second man's sabotage\njust because he knows too much about the thinking of the first.\n\nJoe went off and scowled at a wall, while the young lieutenant waited\nhopefully nearby.\n\nHe was in a false position. But he could see that there was something\nodd here. There was a sort of pattern in the way the other sabotage\nincidents had been planned. It was hard to pick out, but it was there.\nJoe thought of the trick of booby-trapping a plane during its major\noverhaul, and then arming the traps at a later date.... A private plane\nhad been fitted to deliver proximity rockets in mid-air when the\ntransport ship flew past. There was the explosion of the cargo parcel\nwhich was supposed to contain requisition forms and stationery. And the\nattempt to smash the entire Platform by getting an atomic bomb into a\nplane and having a saboteur shoot the crew and then deliver the bomb at\nthe Shed in an officially harmless aircraft....\n\nThe common element in all those sabotage tricks was actually clear\nenough, but Joe wasn't used to thinking in such terms. He did know,\nthough, that there was a pattern in those devices which did not exist in\nthe blowing up of jet motors from inside.\n\nHe scowled and scowled, racking his brains, while the young lieutenant\nwatched respectfully, waiting for Joe to have an inspiration. Had Joe\nknown it, the lieutenant was deeply impressed by his attempt at\nconcentration on the problem it had not been Major Holt's intention for\nJoe to consider. When Joe temporarily gave up, the young lieutenant\neagerly showed him over the whole field and all its workings.\n\nIn mid-morning another pushpot fell screaming from the skies. That made\nsix pushpots and six pilots for this week--two today. The things had no\nwings. They had no gliding angle. Pointed up, they could climb\nunbelievably. While their engines functioned, they could be controlled\nafter a fashion. But they were not aircraft in any ordinary meaning of\nthe word. They were engines with fuel tanks and controls in their\nexhaust blast. When their engines failed, they were so much junk falling\nout of the sky.\n\nJoe happened to see the second crash, and he didn't go to noon mess at\nall. He hadn't any appetite. Instead, he gloomily let himself be packed\nfull of irrelevant information by the young lieutenant who considered\nthat since Joe had been sent by security to look into sabotage, he must\nbe given every possible opportunity to evaluate--that would be the word\nthe young lieutenant would use--the situation.\n\nBut all the time that Joe followed him about, his mind fumbled with a\nhunch. The idea was that there was a pattern of thinking in sabotage,\nand if you could solve it, you could outguess the saboteur. But the\ntrouble was to figure out the similarity he felt existed in--say--a\nprivate plane shooting rockets and overhaul mechanics planting booby\ntraps and faked shippers getting bombs on planes--and come to think of\nit, there was Braun....\n\nBraun was the key! Braun had been an honest man, with an honest loyalty\nto the United States which had given him refuge. But he had been\nblackmailed into accepting a container of atomic death to be released in\nthe Shed. Radioactive cobalt did not belong in the Shed. That was the\nkey to the pattern of sabotage. Braun was not to use any natural thing\nthat belonged in the Shed. He was to be only the means by which\nsomething extraneous and deadly was to have been introduced.\n\nThat was it! Somebody was devising ingenious ways to get well-known\ndestructive devices into places where they did not belong, but where\nthey would be effective. Rockets. Bombs. Even radioactive cobalt dust.\nAll were perfectly well-known means of destruction. The minds that\nplanned those tricks said, in effect: \"These things will destroy. How\ncan we get them to where they will destroy something?\" It was a strict\npattern.\n\nBut the pushpot sabotage--and Joe was sure it was nothing else--was not\nthat sort of thing. Making motors explode.... Motors don't explode. One\ncouldn't put bombs in them. There wasn't room. The explosions Joe had\nseen looked as if they'd centered in the fire basket--technically the\ncombustion area--behind the compressor and before the drive vanes. A jet\nmotor whirled. Its front vanes compressed air, and a flame burned\nfuriously in the compressed air, which swelled enormously and poured out\npast other vanes that took power from it to drive the compressor. The\nexcess of blast poured out astern in a blue-white flame, driving the\nship.\n\nBut one couldn't put a bomb in a fire basket. The temperature would melt\nanything but the refractory alloys of which a jet motor has to be built.\nA bomb placed there would explode the instant a motor was started. It\ncouldn't resist until the pushpot took off. It couldn't....\n\nThis was a different kind of sabotage. There was a different mind at\nwork.\n\nIn the afternoon Joe watched the landings, while the young lieutenant\nfollowed him patiently about. A pushpot landing was quite unlike the\nlanding of any other air-borne thing. It came flying down with\nincredible clumsiness, making an uproar out of all proportion to its\nlanding speed. Pushpots came in with their tail ends low, crudely and\ncruelly clumsy in their handling. They had no wings or fins. They had to\nbe balanced by their jet blasts. They had to be steered the same way.\nWhen a jet motor conked out there was no control. The pushpot fell.\n\nHe carefully watched one landing now. It came down low, and swung in\ntoward the field, and seemed to reach its stern down tentatively to\nslide on the earth, and the flame of its exhaust scorched the field, and\nit hesitated, pointing up at an ever steeper angle--and it touched and\nits nose tilted forward--and leaped up as the jet roared more loudly,\nand then touched again....\n\nThe goal was for pushpots to touch ground finally with the whole weight\nof the flying monstrosity supported by the vertical thrust of the jet,\nand while it was moving forward at the lowest possible rate of speed.\nWhen that goal was achieved, they flopped solidly flat, slid a few feet\non their metal bellies, and lay still. Some hit hard and tried to dig\ninto the earth with their blunt noses. Joe finally saw one touch with no\nforward speed at all. It seemed to try to settle down vertically, as a\nrocket takes off. That one fell over backward and wallowed with its\nbelly plates in the air before it rolled over on its side and rocked\nthere.\n\nThe last of a flight touched down and flopped, and the memory of the\nwreckage had been overlaid by these other sights and Joe could think of\nhis next meal without aversion. When it was evening-mess time he went\ndoggedly back to the mess hall. There was a sort of itchy feeling in his\nmind. He knew something he didn't know he knew. There was something in\nhis memory that he couldn't recall.\n\nTalley and Walton were again at mess. Joe went to their table. Talley\nlooked at him inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes, I saw both crashes,\" said Joe gloomily, \"and I didn't want any\nlunch. It was sabotage, though. Only it was different in kind--it was\ndifferent in principle--from the other tricks. But I can't figure out\nwhat it is!\"\n\n\"Mmmmmm,\" said Talley, amiably. \"You'd learn something if you could talk\nto the Resistance fighters and saboteurs in Europe. The Poles were\nwonderful at it! They had one chap who could get at the tank cars that\ntook aviation gasoline from the refinery to the various Nazi airfields.\nHe used to dump some chemical compound--just a tiny bit--into each\ncarload of gas. It looked all right, smelled all right, and worked all\nright. But at odd moments Hitler's planes would crash. The valves would\nstick and the engine'd conk out.\"\n\nJoe stared at him. And it was just as simple as that. He saw.\n\n\"The Nazis lost a lot of planes that way,\" said Talley. \"Those that\ndidn't crash from stuck valves in flight--they had to have their valves\nreground. Lost flying time. Wonderful! And when the Nazis did uncover\nthe trick, they had to re-refine every drop of aviation gas they had!\"\n\nJoe said: \"That's it!\"\n\n\"That's it? And _it_ is what?\"\n\nThen Joe said disgustedly: \"Surely! It's the trick of loading CO_2\nbottles with explosive gas, too! Excuse me!\"\n\nHe got up from the table and hurried out. He found a phone booth and got\nthe Shed, and then the security office, and at long last Major Holt. The\nMajor's tone was curt.\n\n\"Yes?... Joe?... The three men from the affair of the lake were tracked\nthis morning. When they were cornered they tried to fight. I am afraid\nwe'll get no information from them, if that's what you wanted to know.\"\n\nThe Major's manner seemed to disapprove of Joe as expressing curiosity.\nHis words meant, of course, that the three would-be murderers had been\nfatally shot.\n\nJoe said carefully: \"That wasn't what I called about, sir. I think I've\nfound out something about the pushpots. How they're made to crash. But\nmy hunch needs to be checked.\"\n\nThe Major said briefly: \"Tell me.\"\n\nJoe said: \"All the tricks but one, that were used on the plane I came\non, were the same kind of trick. They were all arrangements for getting\nregular destructive items--bombs or rockets or whatever--where they\ncould explode and smash things. The saboteurs were adding destructive\nitems to various states of things. But there was one trick that was\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said the Major, on the telephone.\n\n\"Putting explosive gas in the CO_2 bottles,\" said Joe painstakingly,\n\"wasn't adding a new gadget to a situation. It was changing something\nthat was already there. The saboteurs took something that belonged in a\nplane and changed it. They did not put something new into a plane--or a\nsituation--that didn't belong there. It was a special kind of thinking.\nYou see, sir?\"\n\nThe Major, to do him justice, had the gift of listening. He waited.\n\n\"The pushpots,\" said Joe, very carefully, \"naturally have their fuel\nstored in different tanks in different places, as airplanes do. The\npilots switch on one tank or another just like plane pilots. In the\nunderground storage and fueling pits, where all the fuel for the\npushpots is kept in bulk, there are different tanks too. Naturally! At\nthe fuel pump, the attendant can draw on any of those underground tanks\nhe chooses.\"\n\nThe Major said curtly: \"Obviously! What of it?\"\n\n\"The pushpot motors explode,\" said Joe. \"And they shouldn't. No bomb\ncould be gotten into them without going off the instant they started,\nand they don't blow that way. I make a guess, sir, that one of the\nunderground storage tanks--just one--contains doctored fuel. I'm\nguessing that as separate tanks in a pushpot are filled up, one by one,\n_one_ is filled from a particular underground storage tank that contains\ndoctored fuel. The rest will have normal fuel. And the pushpot is going\nto crash when that tank, and only that tank, is used!\"\n\nMajor Holt was very silent.\n\n\"You see, sir?\" said Joe uneasily. \"The pushpots could be fueled a\nhundred times over with perfectly good fuel, and then one tank in one of\nthem would explode when drawn on. There'd be no pattern in the\nexplosions....\"\n\nMajor Holt said coldly: \"Of course I see! It would need only one tank of\ndoctored fuel to be delivered to the airfield, and it need not be used\nfor weeks. And there would be no trace in the wreckage, after the fire!\nYou are telling me there is one underground storage tank in which the\nfuel is highly explosive. It is plausible. I will have it checked\nimmediately.\"\n\nHe hung up, and Joe went back to his meal. He felt uneasy. There\ncouldn't be any way to make a jet motor explode unless you fed it\nexplosive fuel. Then there couldn't be any way to stop it. And\nthen--after the wreck had burned--there couldn't be any way to prove it\nwas really sabotage. But the feeling of having reported only a guess was\nnot too satisfying. Joe ate gloomily. He didn't pay much attention to\nTalley. He had that dogged, uncomfortable feeling a man has when he\nknows he doesn't qualify as an expert, but feels that he's hit on\nsomething the experts have missed.\n\nHalf an hour after the evening mess--near sunset--a security officer\nwearing a uniform hunted up Joe at the airfield.\n\n\"Major Holt sent me over to bring you back to the Shed,\" he said\npolitely.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" said Joe with equal politeness, \"I'll check that.\"\n\nHe went to the phone booth in the barracks. He got Major Holt on the\nwire. And Major Holt hadn't sent anybody to get him.\n\nSo Joe stayed in the telephone booth--on orders--while the Major did\nsome fast telephoning. It was comforting to know he had a pistol in his\npocket, and it was frustrating not to be allowed to try to capture the\nfake security officer himself. The idea of murdering Joe had not been\ngiven up, and he'd have liked to take part personally in protecting\nhimself. But it was much more important for the fake security man to be\ncaptured than for Joe to have the satisfaction of attempting it himself.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the fake officer started his getaway the instant\nJoe went to check on his orders. The officer knew they'd be found faked.\nIt had not been practical for him to shoot Joe down where he was. There\nwere too many people around for this murderer to have a chance at a\ngetaway.\n\nBut he didn't get away, at that. Twenty minutes later, while Joe still\nwaited fretfully in the phone booth, the phone bell rang and Major Holt\nwas again on the wire. And this time Joe was instructed to come back to\nthe Shed. He had exact orders whom to come with, and they had orders\nwhich identified them to Joe.\n\nSome eight miles from the airfield--it was just dusk--Joe came upon a\nwrecked car with motorcycle security guards working on it. They stopped\nJoe's escort. Joe's phone call had set off an alarm. A plane had spotted\nthis car tearing away from the airfield, and motorcyclists were guided\nin pursuit by the plane. When it wouldn't stop--when the fake Security\nofficer in it tried to shoot his way clear--the plane strafed him. So he\nwas dead and his car was a wreck, and the motorcycle men were trying to\nget some useful information from his body and the car.\n\nJoe went to the Major's house in the officers'-quarters area. The Major\nlooked even more tired than before, but he nodded approvingly at Joe.\nSally was there too, and she regarded Joe with a look which was a good\ndeal warmer than her father's.\n\n\"You did very well,\" said the Major detachedly. \"I don't have too high\nan opinion of the brains of anybody your age, Joe. When you are my age,\nyou won't either. But whether you have brains or simply luck, you are\nturning out to be very useful.\"\n\nJoe said: \"I'm getting security conscious, sir. I want to stay alive.\"\n\nThe Major regarded him with irony.\n\n\"I was thinking of the fact that when you worked out the matter of the\ndoctored pushpot fuel, you did not try to be a hero and prove it\nyourself. You referred it to me. That was the proper procedure. You\ncould have been killed, investigating--it's clear that the saboteurs\nwould be pleased to have a good chance to murder you--and your\nsuspicions might never have reached me. They were correct, by the way.\nOne storage tank underground was half-full of doctored fuel. Rather more\nimportant, another _was_ full, not yet drawn on.\"\n\nThe Major went on, without apparent cordiality: \"It seems probable that\nif this particular sabotage trick had not been detected--it seems likely\nthat on the Platform's take-off, all or most of the pushpots would have\nbeen fueled to explode at some time after the Platform was aloft, and\nbefore it could possibly get out to space.\"\n\nJoe felt queer. The Major was telling him, in effect, that he might have\nkept the Platform from crashing on take-off. It was a good but upsetting\nsensation. It was still more important to Joe that the Platform get out\nto space than that he be credited with saving it. And it was not\nreassuring to hear that it might have been wrecked.\n\n\"Your reasoning,\" added the Major coldly, \"was soundly based. It seems\ncertain that there is not one central authority directing all the\nsabotage against the Platform. There are probably several sabotage\norganizations, all acting independently and probably hating each other,\nbut all hating the Platform more.\"\n\nJoe blinked. He hadn't thought of that. It was disheartening.\n\n\"It will really be bad,\" said the Major, \"if they ever co-operate!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Joe.\n\n\"But I called you back from the airfield,\" the Major told him without\nwarmth, \"to say that you have done a good job. I have talked to\nWashington. Naturally, you deserve a reward.\"\n\n\"I'm doing all right, sir,\" said Joe awkwardly. \"I want to see the\nPlatform go up and stay up!\"\n\nThe Major nodded impatiently.\n\n\"Naturally! But--ah--one of the men selected and trained for the crew of\nthe Platform has been--ah--taken ill. In strict confidence, because of\nsabotage it has been determined to close in the Platform and get it\naloft at the earliest possible instant, even if its interior\narrangements are incomplete. So--ah--in view of your usefulness, I said\nto Washington that I believed the greatest reward you could be offered\nwas--ah--to be trained as an alternate crew member, to take this man's\nplace if he does not recover in time.\"\n\nThe room seemed to reel around Joe. Then he gulped and said: \"Yes, sir!\nI mean--that's right. I mean, I'd rather have that, than all the money\nin the world!\"\n\n\"Very well.\" The Major turned to leave the room. \"You'll stay here, be\nguarded a good deal more closely than before, and take instructions. But\nyou understand that you are still only an alternate for a crew member!\nThe odds are definitely against your going!\"\n\n\"That's--that's all right, sir,\" said Joe unsteadily. \"That's quite all\nright!\"\n\nThe Major went out. Joe stood still, trying to realize what all this\nmight mean to him. Then Sally stirred.\n\n\"You might say thanks, Joe.\"\n\nHer eyes were shining, but she looked proud, too.\n\n\"I put it in Dad's head that that was what you'd like better than\nanything else,\" she told him. \"If I can't go up in the Platform\nmyself--and I can't--I wanted you to. Because I knew you wanted to.\"\n\nShe smiled at him as he tried incoherently to talk. With a quiet\nmaternal patience, she led him out on the porch of her father's house\nand sat there and listened to him. It was a long time before he realized\nthat she was humoring him. Then he stopped short and looked at her\nsuspiciously. He found that in his enthusiastic gesticulations he had\nbeen gesticulating with _her_ hand as well as his own.\n\n\"I guess I'm pretty crazy,\" he said ruefully. \"Shooting off my mouth\nabout myself up there in space.... You're pretty decent to stand me the\nway I am, Sally.\"\n\nHe paused. Then he said humbly: \"I'm plain lucky. But knowing you\nand--having you like me reasonably much is pretty lucky too!\"\n\nShe looked at him noncommittally.\n\nHe added painfully: \"And not only because you spoke to your father and\ntold him just the right thing, either. You're--sort of swell, Sally!\"\n\nShe let out her breath. Then she grinned at him.\n\n\"That's the difference between us, Joe,\" she told him. \"To me, what you\njust said is the most important thing anybody's said tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe world turned over on its axis with unfailing regularity, and nights\nfollowed mornings and mornings followed nights according to\nwell-established precedent. One man turned up in Bootstrap with\nradiation burns, but he had not offered himself for check over at the\nhospital. He was found dead in his lodging. Since nobody else appeared\nto have suffered any burns at all, it was assumed that he was the\nmessenger who had brought the radioactive cobalt to Braun, who also had\nbeen doomed by possession of the deadly stuff, but who had broken the\nchain of fatality by not dumping it free into the air of the Shed. Under\nthe circumstances, then, three-shift work on the Platform was resumed,\nand three times in each twenty-four hours fleets of busses rolled out of\nBootstrap carrying men to work in the Shed, and rolled back again loaded\nwith men who had just stopped working there.\n\nTrucks carried materials to the Shed, and swing-up doors opened in the\ngreat dome's eastern wall, and the trucks went in and unloaded. Then the\ntrucks went out of the same doors and trundled back for more materials.\nIn the Shed, shining plates of metal swung aloft, and welding torches\nglittered in the maze of joists and upright pipes that still covered the\nmonster shape. Each day it was a little more nearly complete. In a\nseparate, guarded workshop by a sidewall, the Chief and Haney and Mike\nthe midget labored mightily to accomplish the preposterous. They grew\nlean and red-eyed from fatigue, and short of temper and ever more\nfanatical--and security men moved about in seeming uselessness but\nnever-ceasing vigilance.\n\nThere were changes, though. The assembly line of pushpots grew shorter,\nand the remaining monstrosities around the sidewall were plainly near to\ncompletion. There came a day, indeed, when only five ungainly objects\nremained on that line, and even they were completely plated in and\nneeded only a finishing touch. It was at this time that more crates and\nparcels arrived from the Kenmore Precision Tool plant, and Joe dropped\nhis schoolroomlike instruction course in space flight for work of\ngreater immediate need. He and his allies worked twice around the clock\nto assemble the replaced parts with the repaired elements of the pilot\ngyros. They grew groggy from the desperate need both for speed and for\nabsolute accuracy, but they put the complex device together, and\nadjusted it, and surveyed the result through red-rimmed eyes, and were\ntoo weary to rejoice.\n\nThen Joe threw a switch and the reconstituted pilot gyro assembly began\nto hum quietly, and the humming rose to a whine, and the whine went\ndeliberately up the scale until it ceased to be audible at all.\nPresently a dial announced the impossible, and they gazed at a device\nthat seemed to be doing nothing whatever. The gyros appeared quite\nmotionless. They spun with such incredible precision that it was not\npossible to detect that they moved a hairbreadth. And the whole complex\ndevice looked very simple and useless.\n\nBut the four of them gazed at it--now that it worked--with a sudden\npassionate satisfaction. Joe moved a control, and the axis of the device\nmoved smoothly to a new place and stayed there. He moved the control\nagain, and it moved to another position and stayed there. And to another\nand another and another.\n\nThen the Chief took Joe's place, and under his hand the seemingly static\ndisks--which were actually spinning at forty thousand revolutions per\nminute--turned obediently and without any appearance of the spectacular.\nThen Haney worked the controls. And Mike put the device through its\npaces.\n\nMike left the gyros spinning so that the main axis pointed at the sun,\ninvisible beyond the Shed's roof. And then all four of them watched. It\ntook minutes for this last small test to show its results. But visibly\nand inexorably the pilot gyros followed the unseen sun, and they would\nhave resisted with a force of very many tons any attempt to move them\naside by so little as one-tenth of a second of arc, which would mean\nsomething like one three-hundred-thousandth of a right angle. And these\npilot gyros would control the main gyros with just this precision, and\nafter the Platform was out in space could hold the Platform itself with\nthe steadiness needed for astronomical observation past achievement from\nthe surface of the Earth.\n\nThe pilot gyros, in a word, were ready for installation.\n\nJoe and Haney and the Chief and Mike were not beautiful to look at. They\nwere begrimed from head to toe, and their eyes were bloodshot, and they\nwere exhausted to the point where they did not even notice any longer\nthat they were weary. And their mental processes were not at all normal,\nso that they were quarrelsome and arbitrary and arrogant to the men with\nthe flat-bed trailer who came almost reverently to move their work. They\nwent jealously with the thing they had rebuilt, and they were rude to\nengineers and construction workers and supervisors, and they shouted\nangrily at each other as it was hoisted up a shaft that had been left in\nthe Platform for its entrance, and they were very far from tactful as\nthey watched with hot, anxious eyes as it was bolted into place.\n\nIt would be welded later, but first it was tried out. And it moved the\nmain gyros! They weighed many times what the pilot gyros did, but even\nwhen they were spinning the pilot gyros stirred them. Of course the\nmain-gyro linkage to the fabric of the Shed had to be broken for this\ntest, or the gyros would have twisted the giant upon its support and all\nthe scaffolding around it would have been broken and the men on it\nkilled.\n\nBut the gyros worked! They visibly and unquestionably worked! They\ncontrolled the gigantic wheels that would steer the Platform in its\ntake-off, and later would swing it to receive the cargo rockets coming\nup from Earth. The pilot instrument worked! There was no vibration. In\nits steering apparatus the Platform was ready for space!\n\nThen the Chief yawned, and his eyes glazed as he stood in the huge gyro\nroom. And Haney's knees wobbled, and he sat down and was instantly\nasleep. Then Joe vaguely saw somebody--it was Major Holt--holding Mike\nin his arms as if Mike were a baby. Mike would have resented it\nfuriously if he had been awake. And then suddenly Joe didn't know what\nwas going on around him, either.\n\nThere was a definite hiatus in his consciousness. He came back to\nawareness very slowly. He was half-awake and half-asleep for a long\ntime. He only knew contentedly that his job was finished. Then, slowly,\nhe realized that he was in a bunk in one of the Platform sleeping\ncabins, and the inflated cover that was Sally's contribution to the\nPlatform held him very gently in place. Somehow it was infinitely\nsoothing, and he had an extraordinary sensation of peacefulness and\nrelaxation and fulfillment. The pilot gyros were finished and in\nposition. His responsibility to them was ended. And he had slept the\nclock around three times. He'd slept for thirty-six hours. He was\nstarving.\n\nSally had evidently constituted herself a watch over Joe as he slept,\nbecause she faced him immediately when he went groggily out of the cabin\nto look for a place to wash. He was still covered with the grime of past\nlabor, and he had been allowed to sleep with only his shoes removed. He\nwas not an attractive sight. But Sally regarded him with an approval\nthat her tone belied.\n\n\"You can get a shower,\" she told him firmly, \"and then I'll have some\nbreakfast for you. Fresh clothes are waiting, too.\"\n\nJoe said peacefully: \"The gyros are finished and they work!\"\n\n\"Don't I know?\" demanded Sally. \"Go get washed and come back for\nbreakfast. The Chief and Haney and Mike are already awake. And because\nof the four of you, they've been able to advance the Platform's take-off\ntime--to just two days off! It leaked out, and now it's official. And\nyou made it possible!\"\n\nThis was a slight exaggeration, but it was pardonable because of Sally's\npartiality for Joe. He went groggily into the special shower arrangement\nin the Platform. In orbit, there would be no gravity, so a tub bath was\nunthinkable. The shower cabinet was a cubbyhole with handgrips on all\nfour sides and straps into which one could slip his feet. When Joe\nturned handles, needle sprays sprang at him from all sides, and\nsimultaneously a ventilator fan began to run. When in space that fan\ncould draw out what would otherwise become an inchoate mixture of air\nand quite weightless water-drops. In space a man might drown in his own\nshower bath without the fan. The apparatus for collecting the water\nagain was complex, but Joe didn't think about that at the moment. He\nconsidered ruefully that however convenient this system might be out in\nthe Platform's orbit, it left something to be desired on Earth.\n\nBut there were clean clothes waiting when he came out. He dressed and\nfelt brand new and utterly peaceful and rested, and it seemed to him\nvery much like the way he had often felt on a new spring morning. It was\nvery, very good!\n\nThen he smelled coffee and became ravenous.\n\nThere were the others in the Platform's kitchen, sitting in the chairs\nthat had straps on them so the crew needn't float about because of\nweightlessness. There was an argument in progress. The Chief grinned at\nJoe. Mike the midget looked absorbed. Haney was thinking something out,\nrather painfully. Sally was busy at the Platform's very special stove.\nShe had ham and eggs and pancakes ready for Joe to eat.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" she said, \"you are about to eat the first meal ever cooked\nin a space ship--and like it!\"\n\nShe served them and sat companionably down with them all. But her eyes\nwere very warm when she looked at Joe.\n\n\"Leavin' aside what we were arguin' about,\" said the Chief blissfully,\n\"Sally here--mind if I call you Sally, ma'am?--she says the slide-rule\nguys have given our job the works and they say it's a better job than\nthey designed. Take a bow, Joe.\"\n\nSally said firmly: \"When the technical journals are through talking\nabout the job you did, you'll all four be famous for precision-machining\ntechnique and improvements on standard practices.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said the Chief sarcastically, \"is gonna make us feel fine when\nwe're back to welding and stuff!\"\n\n\"No more welding,\" Sally told him. \"Not on this job. The Platform's\nclosed in. They've started to take down the scaffolding.\"\n\nThe Chief looked startled. Haney asked: \"Laying off men yet?\"\n\n\"Not you,\" Sally assured him. \"Definitely not you. You four have the\nvery top super-special security rating there is! I think you're the only\nfour people in the world my father is sure can't be reached, somehow, to\nmake you harm the Platform.\"\n\nMike said abruptly: \"Yeah. The Major thought he had headaches before.\nNow he's really got 'em!\"\n\nMike hadn't seemed to be listening. He'd acted as if he were feverishly\nabsorbing the feel of being inside the Platform--not as a workman\nbuilding it, but as a man whose proper habitat it would become. But Joe\nsuddenly realized that his comment was exact. There'd been plenty of\nsabotage to prevent the Platform from reaching completion. But now it\nwas ready to take off in two days. If it was to be stopped, it would\nhave to be stopped within forty-eight hours by people with plenty of\nresources, who for their own evil ends needed it to be stopped. These\nlast two days would contain the last-ditch, most desperate, most\ncompletely ruthless stepped-up attempts at destruction that could\npossibly be made. And Major Holt had to handle them.\n\nBut the four at table--five, with Sally--were peculiarly relaxed. The\nmatter they'd handled had been conspicuous, perhaps, but it was still\nonly one of thousands that had to be accomplished before the Platform\ncould take off. But they had the infinitely restful feeling of a job\nwell done.\n\n\"No more welding,\" said Haney meditatively, \"and our job on the gyros\nfinished. What are we gonna do?\"\n\nThe Chief said forcefully: \"Me, I'm gonna sweep floors or something, but\nI'm sure gonna stick around and watch the take-off!\"\n\nJoe said nothing. He looked at Sally. She became very busy, making\ncertain the others did not want more to eat. After a long time Joe said,\nwith very careful casualness, \"Come to think of it, I was getting loaded\nup with astrogation theory when I had to stop and pitch in on the gyros.\nHow's that sick crew member, Sally?\"\n\n\"I--wouldn't know,\" answered Sally unconvincingly. \"Have some more\ncoffee?\"\n\nJoe made his face go completely expressionless. There was nothing else\nto do. Sally hadn't said that his chances looked bad for making the crew\nof the Platform when it went out to space. But Sally had ways of knowing\nthings. She would be sure to keep informed on a matter like that,\nbecause she was wearing Joe's ring and it would have taken a great deal\nof discouragement to keep her from finding out good news to tell him.\nShe didn't have any good news. So it must be bad.\n\nJoe drank his coffee, trying to make himself believe that he'd known all\nalong he wasn't going to make the crew. He'd started late to learn the\nthings a crew member ought to know. He'd stopped at the most crucial\npart of his training to work on the gyros, which were more crucial\nstill. He'd slept a day and a half. The platform would take off in\nforty-eight hours. He tried to reason carefully that it was common sense\nto use a man who was fully trained from the beginning for a place in the\ncrew, rather than a latecomer like himself. But it wasn't easy to take.\n\nMike the midget said suddenly: \"I got a hunch.\"\n\n\"Shoot it,\" said the Chief, amiably.\n\n\"I got a hunch I know what kind of sabotage will be tried next--and\nwhen,\" said Mike.\n\nThe others looked at him--all but Joe, who stared at the wall.\n\n\"There hasn't been one set of guys trying to smash the Platform,\" said\nMike excitedly. \"There's been four or five. Joe found a gang sabotaging\nthe pushpots that didn't think like the gang that blackmailed Braun. And\nthe gang that tried to kill us up at Red Canyon may be another. There\ncould be others: fascists and commies and nationalists and crackpots of\nall kinds. And they all know they've got to work fast, even if they have\nto help each other. Get it?\"\n\nHaney growled.\n\n\"I'll buy what you've said so far,\" said the Chief. \"Sure! Those\nso-and-sos will all pile in everything they got at the last minute.\nThey'll even pull together to smash the Platform--and then double-cross\neach other afterward. But what'll they do, an' when?\"\n\n\"This time they'll try outright violence,\" said Mike coldly, \"instead of\nsneaking. They'll try something really rough. For sneaking, one time's\nas good as another, but for really rough stuff, there's just one time\nwhen the Platform hasn't got plenty of guys around ready to fight for\nit.\"\n\nThe Chief whistled softly.\n\n\"You mean change-shift time! Which one?\"\n\n\"The first one possible,\" said Mike briefly. \"After every shift, things\nwill get tighter. So my guess is the next shift, if they can. And if one\ngang starts something, the others will have to jump right in. You see?\"\n\nThat made sense. One attempt at actual violence, defeated, would create\na rigidity of defense that would make others impossible. If a successful\nattempt at violent sabotage was to be made, the efforts of all groups\nwould have to be timed to the first, or abandoned.\n\n\"I could--uh--set up a sort of smoke screen,\" said Mike. \"We'll fake\nwe're going to smash something--and let those saboteurs find it out.\nThey'll see it as a chance to do their stuff with us to run interference\nfor them.--Sally, does your father sure-enough trust us?\"\n\nSally nodded.\n\n\"He doesn't talk very cordially, but he trusts you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Mike. \"You tell him, private, that I'm setting up something\ntricky. He can laugh off anything his security guys report that I'm\nmixed up in. Joe'll see that he gets the whole picture beforehand. But\nhe ain't to tell anybody--not _any_body--that something is getting\nframed up. Right?\"\n\n\"I'll ask him,\" said Sally. \"He is pretty desperate. He's sure some\nlast-minute frantic assault on the Platform will be made. But----\"\n\n\"We'll tip him in plenty of time,\" said Mike with authority. \"In time\nfor him to play along, but not for a leak to spoil things. Okay?\"\n\n\"I'll make the bargain,\" Sally assured him, \"if it can be made.\"\n\nMike nodded. He drained his coffee cup and slipped down from his chair.\n\n\"Come on, Chief! C'mon, Haney!\"\n\nHe led them out of the room.\n\nJoe fiddled with his spoon a moment, and then said: \"The crewman I was\nto have subbed for if he didn't get well--he did, didn't he?\"\n\nSally answered reluctantly: \"Y-yes.\"\n\nJoe said measuredly: \"Well, then--that's that! I guess it will be all\nright for me to stick around and watch the take-off?\"\n\nSally's eyes were misty.\n\n\"Of course it will, Joe! I'm so sorry!\"\n\nJoe grinned, but even to himself his face seemed like a mask.\n\n\"Into each life some rain must fall. Let's go out and see what's been\naccomplished since I went to sleep. All right?\"\n\nThey went out of the Platform together. And as soon as they reached the\nfloor of the Shed it was plain that the stage had been set for stirring\nevents.\n\nThe top five or six levels of scaffolding had already been removed, and\nmore of the girders and pipes were coming down in bundles on lines from\ngiraffelike cranes. There were some new-type trucks in view, too, giants\nof the kind that carry ready-mixed concrete through city streets. They\nwere pouring a doughy white paste into huge buckets that carried it\naloft, where it vanished into the mouths of tubes that seemed to replace\nthe scaffolding along the Platform's sides.\n\n\"Lining the rockets,\" said Sally in a subdued voice.\n\nJoe watched. He knew about this, too. It had been controversial for a\ntime. After the pushpots and their jatos had served as the first two\nstages of a multiple-rocket aggregation, the Platform carried rocket\nfuel as the third stage. But the Platform was a highly special ballistic\nproblem. It would take off almost horizontally--a great advantage in\nfueling matters. This was practical simply because the Platform could be\nlifted far beyond effective air resistance, and already have\nconsiderable speed before its own rockets flared.\n\nMoreover, it was not a space ship in the sense of needing rockets for\nlanding purposes. It wouldn't land. Not ever. And again there was the\nfact that men would be riding in it. That ruled out the use of eight- and\nten- and fifteen-gravity acceleration. It had to make use of a long\nperiod of relatively slow acceleration rather than a brief terrific\nsurge of power. So its very special rockets had been designed as the\nanswer.\n\nThey were solid-fuel rockets, though solid fuels had been long abandoned\nfor long-range missiles. But they were entirely unlike other solid-fuel\ndrives. The pasty white compound being hauled aloft was a self-setting\nrefractory compound with which the rocket tubes would be lined, with the\nsolid fuel filling the center. The tubes themselves were thin\nsteel--absurdly thin--but wound with wire under tension to provide\nstrength against bursting, like old-fashioned rifle cannon.\n\nWhen the fuel was fired, it would be at the muzzle end of the rocket\ntube, and the fuel would burn forward at so many inches per second. The\nrefractory lining would resist the rocket blast for a certain time and\nthen crumble away. Crumbling, the refractory particles would be hurled\nastern and so serve as reaction mass. When the steel outer tubes were\nexposed, they would melt and be additional reaction mass.\n\nIn effect, as the rocket fuel was exhausted, the tubes that contained it\ndissolved into their own blast and added to the accelerating thrust,\neven as they diminished the amount of mass to be accelerated. Then the\nquantity of fuel burned could diminish--the tubes could grow smaller--so\nthe rate of speed gain would remain constant. Under the highly special\nconditions of this particular occasion, there was a notable gain in\nefficiency over a liquid-fuel rocket design. For one item, the Platform\nwould certainly have no use for fuel pumps and fuel tanks once it was in\nits orbit. In this way, it wouldn't have them. Their equivalent in mass\nwould have been used to gain velocity. And when the Platform finally\nrode in space, it would have expended every ounce of the driving\napparatus used to get it there.\n\nNow the rocket tubes were being lined and loaded. The time to take-off\nwas growing short indeed.\n\nJoe watched a while and turned away. He felt very good because he'd\nfinished his job and lived up to the responsibility he'd had. But he\nfelt very bad because he'd had an outside chance to be one of the first\nmen ever to make a real space journey--and now it was gone. He couldn't\nresent the decision against him. If it had been put up to him, he'd\nprobably have made the same hard decision himself. But it hurt to have\nhad even a crazy hope taken away.\n\nSally said, trying hard to interest him, \"These rockets hold an awful\nlot of fuel, Joe! And it's better than scientists thought a chemical\nfuel could ever be!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Fluorine-beryllium,\" said Sally urgently. \"It fits in with the\npushpots' having pressurized cockpits. Rockets like that couldn't be\nused on the ground! The fumes would be poisonous!\"\n\nBut Joe only nodded in agreement. He was apathetic. He was uninterested.\nHe was still thinking of that lost trip in space. He realized that Sally\nwas watching his face.\n\n\"Joe,\" she said unhappily, \"I wish you wouldn't look like that!\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he told her.\n\n\"You act as if you didn't care about anything,\" she protested, \"and you\ndo!\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he repeated.\n\n\"I'd like to go outside somewhere,\" she said abruptly, \"but after what\nhappened up at the lake, I mustn't. Would you like to go up to the top\nof the Shed?\"\n\n\"If you want to,\" he agreed without enthusiasm.\n\nHe followed when she went to a doorway--with a security guard beside\nit--in the sidewall. She flashed her pass and the guard let them\nthrough. They began to walk up an inclined, endless, curving ramp. It\nwas between the inner and outer skins of the Shed. There had to be two\nskins because the Shed was too big to be ventilated properly, and the\nhot desert sunshine on one side would have made \"weather\" inside.\nThere'd have been a convection-current motion of the air in the enclosed\nspace, and minor whirlwinds, and there could even be miniature\nthunderclouds and lightning. Joe remembered reading that such things had\nhappened in a shed built for Zeppelins before he was born.\n\nThey came upon an open gallery, and there was a security man looking\ndown at the floor and the Platform. He had a very good view of all that\nwent on.\n\nThey went around another long circuit of the slanting gallery, dimly\nlighted with small electric bulbs. They came to a second gallery, and\nsaw the Platform again. There was another guard here.\n\nThey were halfway up the globular wall now, and were visibly suspended\nover emptiness. The view of the Platform was impressive. There were an\nastonishing number of rocket tubes being fastened to the outside of that\nhuge object. Three giant cranes, working together, hoisted a tube to the\nlast remaining level of scaffolding, and men swarmed on it and fastened\nit to the swelling hull. As soon as it was fast, other men hurried into\nit with the white pasty stuff to line it from end to end. The tubes\nwould nearly hide the structure they were designed to propel. But they'd\nall be burned away when it reached its destination.\n\n\"Wonderful, isn't it?\" asked Sally hopefully.\n\nJoe looked, and said without warmth, \"It's the most wonderful thing that\nanybody ever even tried to do.\"\n\nWhich was true enough, but the zest of it had unreasonably departed for\nJoe for the time being. His disappointment was new.\n\nHalfway around again, Sally opened a door, and Joe was almost surprised\nout of his lethargy. Here was a watching post on the outside of the\nmonstrous half-globe. There were two guards here, with fifty-caliber\nmachine guns under canvas hoods. Their duties were tedious but\nnecessary. They watched the desert. From this height it stretched out\nfor miles, and Bootstrap could be seen as a series of white specks far\naway with hills behind it.\n\nUltimately Sally and Joe came to the very top of the Shed into the open\nair. From here the steep plating curved down and away in every\ndirection. The sunshine was savagely bright and shining, but there was a\nbreeze. And here there was a considerable expanse fenced in--almost an\nacre, it seemed. There were metal-walled small buildings with\ninnumerable antennae of every possible shape for the reception of every\nconceivable wave length. There were three radar bowl reflectors turning\nrestlessly to scan the horizon, and a fourth which went back and forth,\nrevolving, to scan the sky itself. Sally told Joe that in the very\nmiddle--where there was a shed with a domelike roof which wasn't\nmetal--there was a wave-guide radar that could spot a plane within three\nfeet vertically, and horizontally at a distance of thirty miles, with\ngreater distances in proportion.\n\nThere were guns down in pits so their muzzles wouldn't interfere with\nthe radar. There were enough non-recoil anti-aircraft guns to defend the\nShed against anything one could imagine.\n\n\"And there are jet planes overhead too,\" said Sally. \"Dad asked to have\nthem reinforced, and two new wings of jet fighters landed yesterday at a\nfield somewhere over yonder. There are plenty of guards!\"\n\nThe Platform was guarded as no object in all history had ever been\nguarded. It was ironic that it had to be protected so, because it was\nactually the only hope of escape from atomic war. But that was why some\npeople hated the Platform, and their hatred had made it seem obviously\nan item of national defense. Ironically that was the reason the money\nhad been provided for its construction. But the greatest irony of all\nwas that its most probable immediate usefulness would be the help it\nwould give in making nuclear experiments that weren't safe enough to\nmake on Earth.\n\nThat was pure irony. Because if those experiments were successful, they\nshould mean that everybody in the world would in time become rich beyond\nenvy.\n\nBut Joe couldn't react to the fact. He was drained and empty of emotion\nbecause his job was done and he'd lost a very flimsy hope to be one of\nthe Platform's first crew.\n\nHe didn't really feel better until late that night, when suddenly he\nrealized that life was real and life was earnest, because a panting man\nwas trying to strangle Joe with his bare hands. Joe was hampered in his\nself-defense because a large number of battling figures trampled over\nhim and his antagonist together. They were underneath the Platform, and\nJoe expected to be blown to bits any second.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nJoe sat on the porch of Major Holt's quarters in the area next to the\nShed. It was about eight-thirty, and dark, but there was a moon. And Joe\nhad come to realize that his personal disappointment was only his\npersonal disappointment, and that he hadn't any right to make a nuisance\nof himself about it. Therefore he didn't talk about the thing nearest in\nhis mind, but something else that was next nearest or farther away\nstill. Yet, with the Shed filling up a full quarter of the sky, and a\ngibbous moon new-risen from the horizon, it was not natural for a young\nman like Joe to speak purely of earthly things.\n\n\"It'll come,\" he said yearningly, staring at the moon. \"If the Platform\ngets up day after tomorrow, it's going to take time to ferry up the\nequipment it ought to have. But still, somebody ought to land on the\nmoon before too long.\"\n\nHe added absorbedly: \"Once the Platform is fully equipped, it won't take\nmany rocket pay loads to refill a ship's tanks at the Platform, before\nit can head on out.\"\n\nMathematically, a rocket ship that could leave the Platform with full\nfuel tanks should have fuel to reach the moon and land on it, and take\noff again and return to the Platform. The mathematical fact had a\npeculiar nagging flavor. When a dream is subjected to statistical\nanalysis and the report is in its favor, a dreamer's satisfaction is\nalways diluted by a subconscious feeling that the report is only part of\nthe dream. Everybody worries a little when a cherished dream shows a\nlikelihood of coming true. Some people take firm steps to stop things\nright there, so a romantic daydream won't be spoiled by transmutation\ninto prosaic fact. But Joe said doggedly: \"Twenty ferry trips to pile up\nfuel, and the twenty-first ship should be able to refuel and go on out.\nAnd then somebody will step out on the moon!\"\n\nHe was disappointed now. He wouldn't be the one to do it. But somebody\nwould.\n\n\"You might try for the ferry service,\" said Sally uneasily.\n\n\"I will,\" said Joe grimly, \"but I won't be hoping too much. After all,\nthere are astronomers and physics sharks and such things, who'll be glad\nto learn to run rockets in order to practice their specialties out of\natmosphere.\"\n\nSally said mournfully: \"I can't seem to say anything to make you feel\nbetter!\"\n\n\"But you do,\" said Joe. He added grandiloquently, \"But for your\nunflagging faith in me, I would not have the courage to bear the burdens\nof everyday life.\"\n\nShe stamped her foot.\n\n\"Stop it!\"\n\n\"All right.\" But he said quietly, \"You are a good kid, Sally. You know,\nit's not too bright of me to mourn.\"\n\nShe drew a deep breath.\n\n\"That's better! Now, I want----\"\n\nThere was a gangling figure walking down the concrete path between the\ntrim, monotonous cottages that were officers' quarters at the Shed.\n\nJoe said sharply: \"That's Haney! What's he doing here?\" He called,\n\"Haney!\"\n\nHaney's manner took on purpose. He came across the grass--the lawns\naround the officers' quarters contained the only grass in twenty miles.\n\n\"Hiya,\" said Haney uncomfortably. He spoke politely to Sally. \"Hiya.\nUh--you want to get in on the party, Joe?\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\n\"The party Mike was talkin' about,\" said Haney. \"He's set it up. He\nwants me to get you and a kinda--uh--undercover tip-off to Major Holt.\"\n\nJoe stirred. Sally said hospitably: \"Sit down. You've noticed that my\nfather gave you full security clearance, so you can go anywhere?\"\n\nHaney perched awkwardly on the edge of the porch.\n\n\"Yeah. That's helped with the party. It's how I got here, as far as that\ngoes. Mike's on top of the world.\"\n\n\"Shoot it,\" said Joe.\n\n\"Y'know he's been pretty bitter about things,\" said Haney carefully.\n\"He's been sayin' that little guys like him ought to be the spacemen.\nThere's half a dozen other little guys been working on the Platform too.\nThey can get in cracks an' buck rivets an' so on. Useful. He's had 'em\nall hopped up on the fact that the Platform coulda been finished months\nago if it'd been built for them, an' they could get to the moon an' back\nwhile full-sized guys couldn't an' so on. Remember?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Sally.\n\n\"They've all been beefin' about it,\" explained Haney. \"People know how\nthey feel. So today Mike went and talked to one or two of 'em. An' they\nstarted actin' mysterious, passin' messages back an' forth an' so on.\nLittle guys, actin' important. Security guys wouldn't notice 'em much.\nY'don't take a guy Mike's size serious, unless you know him. Then he's\nthe same as anybody else. So the security guys didn't pay any attention\nto him. But some other guys did. Some special other guys. They saw those\nlittle fellas actin' like they were cookin' up somethin' fancy. An' they\nbit.\"\n\n\"Bit?\" asked Sally.\n\n\"They got curious. So Mike an' his gang got confidential. An' they're\ngoing to have help sabotagin' the Platform when the next shift changes.\nThe midgets gettin' even for bein' laughed at, see? They're pretending\ntheir plan is that when the Platform's sabotaged--not smashed, but just\nmessed up so it can't take off--the big brass will let 'em take a ferry\nrocket up in a hurry, an' get it in orbit, an' use it for a Platform\nuntil the big Platform can be mended an' sent up. Once they're up there,\nthere's no use tryin' to stop the big Platform. So it can go ahead.\"\n\nJoe said dubiously: \"I think I see....\"\n\n\"Mike and his gang of little guys are bein' saps--on purpose. If\nanybody's goin' to pull some fast stuff, next shift change--that's the\ntime everybody's got to! Last chance! Mike and his gang don't know\nwhat's gonna happen, but they sure know when! They're invitin' the real\nsaboteurs to make fools of 'em. And what'll happen?\"\n\nJoe said drily: \"The logical thing would be to feel sorry for the big\nguys who think they're smarter than Mike.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Haney, deadly serious. \"Mike's story is there's half a\ndozen rocket tubes already loaded. They're goin' to fire those rockets\nbetween shifts. The Platform gets shoved off its base an' maybe dented,\nand so on. Mike's gang say they got the figures to prove they can go up\nin a ferry rocket an' be a Platform, and the big brass won't have any\nchoice but to let 'em.\"\n\nSally said: \"I don't think they know how the big brass thinks.\"\n\nHaney and Joe said together, \"No!\" and Joe added: \"Mike's not crazy! He\nknows better! But it's a good story for somebody who doesn't know Mike.\"\n\nHaney said in indignation: \"I came out here to ask the Major to help us.\nThe Chief's gettin' a gang together, too. There's some Indians of his\ntribe that work here. We can count on them for plenty of rough stuff.\nAnd there's Joe and me. The point is that Mike's stunt makes it certain\nthat everything busts loose at a time we can know in advance. If the\nMajor gives us a free hand, and then in the last five minutes takes his\nown measures--so they can't leak out ahead of time and tip off the gangs\nwe want to get--we oughta knock off all the expert saboteurs who know\nthe weak spots in the Platform. For instance those who know that\nthermite in the gyros would mess everything up all over again.\"\n\nJoe said quietly: \"But Major Holt has to be told well in advance about\nall this! That's absolute!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Haney. \"But also he has got to keep quiet--not tell\nanybody else! There've been too many leaks already about too many\nthings. You know that!\"\n\nJoe said: \"Sally, see if you can get your father to come here and talk.\nHaney's right. Not in his office. Right here.\"\n\nSally got up and went inside the house. She came back with an uneasy\nexpression on her face.\n\n\"He's coming. But I couldn't very well tell him what was wanted,\nand--I'm not sure he's going to be in a mood to listen.\"\n\nWhen the Major arrived he was definitely not in a mood to listen. He was\na harried man, and he was keyed up to the limit by the multiplied strain\ndue to the imminence of the Platform's take-off. He came back to his\nhouse from a grim conference on exactly the subject of how to make\npreparations against any possible sabotage incidents--and ran into a\nproposal to stimulate them! He practically exploded. Even if provocation\nshould be given to saboteurs to lure them into showing their hands, this\nwas no time for it! And if it were, it would be security business. It\nshould not be meddled in by amateurs!\n\nJoe said grimly: \"I don't mean to be disrespectful, sir, but there's a\npoint you've missed. It isn't thinkable that you'll be able to prevent\nsomething from being tried at a time the saboteurs pick. They've got\njust so much time left, and they'll use it! But Mike's plan would offer\nthem a diversion under cover of which they could pull their own stuff!\nAnd besides that, you know your office leaks! You couldn't set up a\ntrick like this through security methods. And for a third fact, this is\nthe one sort of thing no saboteur would expect from your security\norganization! We caught the saboteurs at the pushpot field by guessing\nat a new sort of thinking for sabotage. Here's a chance to catch the\nsaboteurs who'll work their heads off in the next twenty-four hours or\nso, by using a new sort of thinking for security!\"\n\nMajor Holt was not an easy man to get along with at any time, and this\nwas the worst of all times to differ with him. But he did think\nstraight. He stared furiously at Joe, growing crimson with anger at\nbeing argued with. But after he had stared a full minute, the angry\nflush went slowly away. Then he nodded abruptly.\n\n\"There you have a point,\" he said curtly. \"I don't like it. But it is a\npoint. It would be completely the reverse of anything my antagonists\ncould possibly expect. So I accept the suggestion. Now--let us make the\narrangements.\"\n\nHe settled down for a quick, comprehensive, detailed plan. In careful\nconsultation with Haney, Joe worked it out. The all-important point was\nthat the Major's part was to be done in completely unorthodox fashion.\nHe would take measures to mesh his actions with those of Mike, the\nChief, Haney, and Joe. Each action the Major took and each order he gave\nhe would attend to personally. His actions would be restricted to the\nlast five minutes or less before shift-change time. His orders would be\ngiven individually to individuals, and under no circumstances would he\ntransmit any order through anybody else. In every instance, his order\nwould be devised to mean nothing intelligible to its recipient until the\ntime came for obedience.\n\nIt was not an easy scheme for the Major to bind himself to. It ran\ncounter to every principle of military thinking save one, which was that\nit was a good idea to outguess the enemy. At the end he said detachedly:\n\"This is distinctly irregular. It is as irregular as anything could\npossibly be! But that is why I have agreed to it. It will be at\nleast--unexpected--coming from me!\"\n\nThen he smiled without mirth and nodded to Joe and to Haney, and went\nstriding away down the concrete walk to where his car waited.\n\nHaney left a moment later to carry the list of arrangements to the Chief\nand to Mike. And Joe went into the Shed to do his part.\n\nThere was little difference in the appearance of the Shed by night. In\nthe daytime there were long rows of windows in the roof, which let in a\nvague, dusky, inadequate twilight. At night those windows were\nshuttered. This meant that the shadows were a little sharper and the\ncontrasts of light and shade a trifle more abrupt. All other changes\nthat Joe could see were the normal ones due to the taking down of\nscaffolding and the fastening up of rocket tubes. It was clear that the\nshape of the Platform proper would be obscure when all its rocket tubes\nwere fast in place.\n\nJoe went to look at the last pushpots, and they were ready to be taken\nover to their own field for their flight test before use. There were\nextras, anyhow, beyond the number needed to lift the Platform. He found\nhimself considering the obvious fact that after the Platform was aloft,\nthey would be used to launch the ferry rockets, too.\n\nThen he moved toward the center of the Shed. A whole level of\nscaffolding came apart and its separate elements were bundled together\nas he watched. Slings lowered the bundles down to waiting trucks which\nwould carry them elsewhere. There were mixing trucks still pouring out\ntheir white paste for the lining of the rocket tubes, and their product\nwent up and vanished into the gaping mouths of the giant wire-wound\npipes.\n\nPresently Joe went into the maze of piers under the Space Platform\nitself. He came to the temporary stairs he had reason to remember. He\nnodded to the two guards there.\n\n\"I want to take another look at that gadget we installed,\" he said.\n\nOne of the guards said good-naturedly: \"Major Holt said to pass you any\ntime.\"\n\nHe ascended and went along the curious corridor--it had handgrips on the\nwalls so a man could pull himself along it when there was no weight--and\nwent to the engine room. He heard voices. They were speaking a\ncompletely unintelligible language. He tensed.\n\nThen the Chief grinned at him amiably. He was in the engine room and\nwith him were no fewer than eight men of his own coppery complexion.\n\n\"Here's some friends of mine,\" he explained, and Joe shook hands with\nblack-haired, dark-skinned men who were named Charley Spotted Dog and\nSam Fatbelly and Luther Red Cow and other exotic things. The Chief said\nexuberantly, \"Major Holt told the guards to let me pass in some Indian\nfriends, so I took my gang on a guided tour of the Platform. None of 'em\nhad ever been inside before. And----\"\n\n\"I heard you talking Indian,\" said Joe.\n\n\"You're gonna hear some more,\" said the Chief. \"We're the first war\nparty of my tribe in longer'n my grandpa woulda thought respectable!\"\n\nJoe found it difficult to restrain a smile. The Chief took him off to\none side.\n\n\"Fella,\" he said kindly, \"it bothers you, this business, because it\nain't organized. That's what this world needs, Joe. Everything figured\nout by slide rules an' such--it's civilized, but it ain't human! What\neverybody oughta be is a connoisseur of chaos, like me. Quit worryin'\nan' get outside and pick up that security guy the Major was gonna send\nto meet you!\"\n\nHe gave Joe an amiable shove and rejoined his fellow Mohawks, each of\nwhom, Joe noticed suddenly, had somewhere on his person a twelve-inch\nStillson wrench or a reasonable facsimile to serve as a substitute\ntomahawk. They grinned at him as he departed.\n\nAt the bottom of the flight of narrow wooden steps there was a third\nsecurity man. He greeted Joe.\n\n\"Major Holt told me to pick you up,\" he observed.\n\nJoe walked to one side with him. Major Holt had promised to send a\nfirst-class man to meet Joe at this place, with orders to take\ninstructions from Joe. Joe said curtly: \"You're to snag as many Security\nmen as you can, place them more or less out of sight under the Platform\nhere, and tell them to turn off their walkie-talkies and wait. No matter\nwhat happens, they're to wait right here until they're needed, right\nhere!\"\n\nHe looked harassedly around him. The Security man nodded and moved\ncasually away. This was close timing. Something made Joe look up. He saw\nthe catwalk gallery nearly overhead. The expected guard was there.\nHaney, though, was with him. There was nothing else in sight. Not yet.\nBut Haney was on the job. Joe saw a Security man step out of sight in\nthe scaffolding. He saw his own assigned security man speak to another,\nwho wandered casually toward the Platform's base.\n\nMinutes passed. Only Joe could have noticed, because he was watching for\nit. There were eight or nine Security men posted within call. They had\ntheir walkie-talkies turned off and would be subject only to his orders\nif an emergency arose.\n\nGongs began to ring all around the edge of the Shed. They set up a\nhorrendous clanging. This was not an alarm, but simply the notice of\nchange-of-shift time.\n\nThere was a marked change in the noises overhead. A crane pulled back.\nHammerings dwindled and stopped. There were the sounds of pipes,\ncombined to form the scaffolds, being taken apart for removal. A\nsling-load of pipe touched the floor and stayed there. The crane's\ninternal-combustion motor stopped. Its operator stepped down to the\nfloor and headed for the exit. Hoists descended and men moved across the\nfloor. Other men scrambled down ladders. The floor became dotted with\nfigures moving toward the doors through which men went out to get on the\nbusses for Bootstrap.\n\nNothing happened. More long minutes passed. The shift brought out by the\nbusses was going through the check-over process in the incoming screen\nroom. Joe knew that Major Holt had, within the past five minutes,\ngathered together a tight-knit bunch of armed security men to be\navailable for anything that might turn up. The men doing the normal\nshift-change screening were shorthanded in consequence.\n\nThe floor next to the exits became crowded, but the central area of the\nfloor was cleared. One truck was stalled at the swing-up truck doors.\nIts driver ground the starter insistently.\n\nSuddenly there was a high-pitched yell away up on the Platform. Then\nthere was a shot. Its echoes rang horribly in the resonant interior of\nthe Shed. Joe's own special security man hurried to him, his face tense.\n\n\"What about that?\"\n\n\"Hold everything,\" said Joe grimly. \"That's taken care of.\"\n\nIt was. That was Mike's gang--miniature humans popping out of hiding to\noffer battle with missiles carefully prepared beforehand against their\nalleged associates in sabotage. One of the associates had drawn a gun\nand fired. But Mike's gang had help. Out of small air locks devised to\nmake the Platform's skin accessible to its crew on every side--provided\nthey wore space suits--dark-skinned men appeared.\n\nThe security man's walkie-talkie under his shoulder made a buzzing\nsound. He reached for it.\n\n\"Forget it!\" snapped Joe. \"That's not for you! You've got your orders!\nStay here!\"\n\nThere was a sudden growling uproar where men were crowding to get out of\nthe Shed. Thick, billowing smoke appeared. There was a crashing\nexplosion. The men eddied and milled crazily.\n\nThe motor of the stalled truck caught. It moved toward the door, which\nopened, swinging up and high. Two trucks came roaring in. They raced for\nthe Platform. And as they raced inside, their camouflaged loads\nclattered off and men showed instead. The guards by the doorway began to\nshoot.\n\n\"That's what we've got to stop!\" snapped Joe.\n\nHe began to run, his pistol out. There was suddenly a small\narmy--gathered by his orders--which materialized in the dim space under\nthe Platform. It raced to guard against this evidently well-planned\ninvasion.\n\nThe harsh, tearing rattle of a machine gun sounded from somewhere high\nup. Joe knew what it was. Mike's whole scheme had been intended to force\nall sabotage efforts to take place at a single instant. Part of the\npreparation was authority for Haney to drag in two machine guns from an\nouter watching-post and mount them to cover the interior of the Shed\nwhen the general attack began.\n\nThose machine guns were shooting at the trucks. Splinters sprang up from\nthe wood-block floor. Then, abruptly, one of the trucks vanished in a\nmonstrous, actinic flash of blue-white flame and a roar so horrible that\nit was not sound but pure concussion. The other truck keeled over and\ncrashed from the blast, but did not explode. Men jumped from it. There\nmust have been screamed orders, but Joe could hear nothing at all. He\nonly saw men waving their arms, and others seized things from the\ntoppled load and rushed toward him, and he began to shoot as he ran to\nmeet them.\n\nNow, belatedly, the sirens of the Shed screamed their alarm, and choppy\nyappings set up as the siren wails rose in pitch. Over by the exit\npistols cracked. Something fell with a ghastly crash not ten feet from\nwhere Joe ran. It was a man's body, toppled from somewhere high up on\nthe structure that was the most important man-made thing in all the\nworld. A barbaric war whoop sounded among the echoes of other tumult.\n\nA Security man shot, and one of the running figures toppled and slid,\nhis burden--which must certainly be a bomb--rolling ridiculously. There\nhad been two trucks that plunged through the swing-up door. They had\nraced for the spaces under the Platform at the exact time when the floor\nwould be clear, because all work had stopped. Under the Platform, the\ntrucks were to have been detonated. At the very least, they would have\nrent and torn it horribly. They might have broken its back. And surely\none truck should have made it. But there should not have been machine\nguns ready trained to shoot. Now the load of desperate men from the\noverturned survivor scurried for the Platform with parts of its cargo.\nIf they could fight their way inside the Platform, they could blast its\nhull open, or demolish its controls or shatter its air pumps and its\ngyros and turn its air tanks into sieves. Anything that could be damaged\nwould delay the take-off and so expose the Platform to further and\nperhaps more successful attack.\n\nThere were more pistol shots. A group of men fought their way out of the\nincoming screening rooms and raced for the center of the Shed. (Later,\nit would be found they had slabs of explosive inside their garments, and\ndetonation caps to set them off.) Somewhere another door opened, and\nSecurity men came out with flickering pistols, Major Holt leading them.\nHe had started out to fight off the truck-borne attack, but he was bound\nto be too late. Joe's followers were trying to take care of that. The\nscuttling men from the incoming rooms were Major Holt's first prey. They\nwere shot as they ran.\n\nJoe stumbled and fell and he heard guns crackling. As he scrambled up he\npitched into a running figure that snarled as Joe hit him. And then he\nwas fighting for his life.\n\nThis was under the Platform and in the middle of confusion many times\nconfounded. Joe caught a wrist that held a gun. He knew his assailant\nhad a bomb slung over one shoulder and right now had one hand free for\ncombat. Joe instinctively tried to batter his enemy with his own pistol,\ninstead of pushing the muzzle against the man's body and pulling the\ntrigger. He struck a flailing blow, and his hand and the weapon struck a\nmetal brace. The blow cut his knuckles and paralyzed his fingers.\nDespairingly he felt the pistol slipping from his grasp. Then his\nassailant brought up his knee viciously, but it hit Joe's thigh instead\nof his groin, and Joe flung his weight furiously forward and they\ntoppled to the ground together.\n\nThere was fighting all around him. The machine guns rasped again--there\nwas a burst of tracer-bullet fire. The panicked men by the exit tried to\nsurge out through the swinging doors. But the tracers marked a line they\nmust not cross. They checked. Once a gun flashed so close by Joe's eyes\nthat it blinded him. And once somebody fell over both himself and his\nantagonist, who writhed like an eel possessed of desperate strength past\nbelief.\n\nJoe could really know only his private part in the struggle down in the\nmurky tangle of the scaffold base. But there was fighting up on the\nPlatform itself. A savagely grinning Mohawk wrestled furiously with a\nman on one of the rocket tubes. An incendiary device in the saboteur's\npocket ignited, and it flamed red-hot and he screamed as it burned its\nway out of his garments. The Mohawk flung the man fiercely clear, to\ncrash horribly on the far-distant floor, and then kicked the incendiary\noff. It fell after the man and hit and burst, and it was thermite which\nsurrounded itself with a column of acrid smoke from seared wood blocks.\n\nThere was fighting by the exit doors. There was an ululating uproar in\nthe incoming screening room, and a war whoop from the top of the\nPlatform. A saboteur tried to crawl into an air-lock entrance, and he\ngot his head and shoulders in, but a copper-skinned Indian held his\nforehead still and chopped down with the side of his hand on that man's\nneck. Underneath the Platform was panting chaos, with pistol shots and\nhand-to-hand struggles everywhere. The force Joe had gathered fought\nvaliantly, but four invaders got to the foot of the wooden steps, where\nthere were two guards. Then there were only two saboteurs left to\nscramble desperately up the steps over the dead guards' bodies and head\ntoward the Platform door, but the Chief appeared swinging a twelve-inch\nStillson. He let it go, precisely like a skillfully flung tomahawk, and\nleaped down sixteen steps squarely onto the body of the other man. A gun\nflashed, but then there was only squirming struggle on the floor.\n\nMike the midget, inside the Platform, found one bloodied, panting,\nsobbing man who somehow had gotten inside. And Mike brought down a\nspanner from a ladder step, and swarmed upon his half-conscious victim,\nand hit him again, and then stayed on guard until somebody arrived who\nwas big enough to carry the saboteur away.\n\nAnd all this while, Joe struggled with only one man. It was a horrible\nstruggle, because the man had a bomb and he might manage to set it off\nor it might go off of itself. It was a ghastly struggle, because the man\nhad the strength and desperation of a maniac--and practiced the tactics.\nJoe pounded the hand that held the gun upon the floor, and it hit\nsomething and exploded smokily and fell clear. But that made things\nworse. While struggling to kill Joe with the revolver, his antagonist\nhad had only five fingers with which to gouge out Joe's eyes or tear\naway his ears or rend his flesh. But with no pistol he had ten, and he\nfought like a wild beast. He even breathed like an animal. He began to\npant--thick, guttural pantings that had the quality of hellish hate. And\nthen there was a surging of bodies--Major Holt's reserve was arriving\nvery late in the center of the Shed--and then a struggling group\ntrampled all over the pair who squirmed and fought on the ground, and a\nheavy boot jammed down Joe's head and he felt teeth sink in his throat.\nThey dug into his flesh, worrying and tearing....\n\nJoe used his knee in a frenzy of revulsion--used his knee as the other\nman had tried to use his in the first instant of battle. The man beneath\nhim screamed as an animal would scream, and Joe jerked his bleeding\nthroat free. In hysterical horror he pounded his antagonist's head on\nthe floor until the man went limp....\n\nAnd then he heard a grim voice saying: \"Quit it or you get your head\nblown off! Quit it----\" And Joe panted: \"It's about time you guys got\nhere! This man came in on that truck. Watch out for that bomb he's got\nslung on him....\"\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nThe incoming shift had a messy clean-up job to do. It was accomplished\nonly because security men abruptly took over the work of gang bosses,\nand all ordinary labor on the Platform was put aside until normal\noperations were again possible. Even that would not have been feasible\nbut for the walkie-talkies the security men wore. As the situation was\nsorted out, it was explained to them, and they relayed the news for the\nsatisfaction of the curiosity of those who worked under them. No\nwork--no explanation. It produced immediate and satisfactory\nco-operation all around.\n\nThere had been four separate and independent attempts to wreck the\nPlatform at the same time. One was, of course, the plan of those\nsympathetic characters who had volunteered to help Mike and his gang win\nthe status of spacemen by firing the Platform's rockets. There were not\nmany of them, and they had lost heavily. They'd had thermite bombs to\ndestroy the Platform's vitals. Ultimately the survivors talked freely,\nif morosely, and that was that.\n\nThere had been a particularly ungifted attempt to cause panic in the\nincoming shift in the rooms where its members were screened before\nadmission to work. Somebody had tried to establish complete confusion\nthere by firing revolver shots in the crowd, expecting the workers to\nbreak through to the floor and assigned gentlemen with slabs of\nexplosive to get to the Platform with them. The gentlemen with the\nexplosives had run into Major Holt's security reserve, and they got\nnowhere. The creators of panic with revolver shots were finally rescued\nfrom their shift-mates and more or less scraped up from the\nscreening-room floor--they were in very bad shape--and carted off to be\npatched up for questioning. The members of this group had been\nimpractical idealists, and besides, some of them had lost their nerve,\nas was evidenced by the discovery of abandoned explosives and detonators\nin the locker room and men's room of the Shed.\n\nThe most dangerous attempt was, of course, that perfectly planned and\nco-ordinated assault which had been merely carried out at its original\ntime, without either being hastened or delayed by Mike's activities.\nThat plan had been beautifully contrived, and it would certainly have\nbeen successful but for the machine-gun bullets from the gallery and the\nfight Joe's followers put up underneath the Platform.\n\nThe exact instant when the whole Shed would be most nearly empty had\nbeen fixed upon, and three separate units had worked in perfect timing.\nThere'd been the man in the stalled truck. He'd delayed his exit from\nthe Shed to the precise fraction of a second to get the doors open at\nthe perfect instant. The explosive-laden trucks had raced in at the\nexact second when they were most certain to get underneath the Platform\nand detonate their cargoes. There'd been a perfect diversion planned for\nthat, too. Smoke bombs and explosions in the outgoing screening rooms\nhad created real panic, and but for Joe's order for his group's\nwalkie-talkies to be turned off would have drawn every security man on\nduty to that spot.\n\nMike's trick, then, had brought some saboteurs into the open, but had\nmerely happened to coincide with the most dangerous and well-organized\ncoup of all. However, it was due to his trick that the Platform was not\nnow a wreck.\n\nThere was also another break that was sheer coincidence. It was a\ndiscovery that could not possibly have turned up save in a situation of\npure chaos artificially induced. Joe had had to react in a personal and\nvengeful way to the manner in which his especial antagonist had fought\nhim. One expects a man to fight fair by instinct, and to turn to\nfouls--if he does--in desperation only. But Joe's personal opponent\nhadn't tried a single fair trick. It was as if he'd never heard of a\nfist blow, but only of murder and mayhem. Joe felt an individual enmity\ntoward him.\n\nJoe didn't consider himself the most urgent of the injured, when doctors\nand nurses took up the work of patching, but Sally was there to help,\nand she went deathly pale when she saw his bloodstained throat. She\ndragged him quickly to a doctor. And the doctor looked at Joe and\ndropped everything else.\n\nBut it wasn't too serious. The antiseptics hurt, and the stitching was\nunpleasant, but Joe was more worried by the knowledge that Sally was\nstanding there and suffering for him. When he got up from the emergency\noperating table, the doctor nodded grimly to him.\n\n\"That was close!\" said the doctor. \"Whoever chewed you was working for\nyour jugular vein, and he was halfway through the wall when he stopped.\nA fraction of an inch more, and he'd have had you!\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Joe. His neck felt clumsy with bandages, and when he\ntried to turn his head the stitches hurt.\n\nSally's hand trembled in his when she led him away.\n\n\"I didn't think I'd ever dislike anybody so much,\" said Joe angrily, \"as\nI did that man while he was chewing my throat. We were trying to kill\neach other, of course, but--confound it, people don't bite!\"\n\n\"Did you--kill him?\" asked Sally in a shaky voice. \"Not that I'll mind!\nI would have hated the thought ordinarily, but----\"\n\nJoe halted. There was a row of stretchers--not too long, at that--in the\nemergency-hospital space. He looked down at the unconscious man who'd\nfought him.\n\n\"There he is!\" he said irritably. \"I banged him pretty hard. I don't\nlike to hate anybody, but the way he fought----\"\n\nSally's teeth chattered suddenly. She called to one of the security men\nstanding guard by the stretchers.\n\n\"I--think my--father is going to want to talk to him,\" she said\nunsteadily. \"Don't--let him be taken away to the hospital until Dad\nknows, please.\"\n\nShe started away, her face dead-white and her hand stone-cold.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded Joe.\n\n\"S-sabotage,\" said Sally in an indescribable tone that had a suggestion\nof heartbreak.\n\nShe went into her father's office alone. She came out again with him,\nand her father looked completely stricken. Miss Ross, his secretary, was\nwith him, too. Her face was like a mask of marble. She had always been a\nplain woman, a gloomy one, a morbid one. But at the new and horrible\nlook on her face Joe turned his eyes away.\n\nThen Sally was crying beside him, and he put his arm clumsily around her\nand let her sob on his shoulder, completely puzzled.\n\nHe didn't find out until later what the trouble was. The man who'd tried\nso earnestly to kill him was Miss Ross's fianc\u00e9. She had met this man\nduring a vacation, as a government secretary, and he was a refugee with\nan exotic charm that would have fascinated a much more personable and\nbeautiful woman than Miss Ross. They had a whirlwind romance. He\nconfided to her his terror of emissaries from his native country who\nmight kill him. And of course she was more fascinated still. When he\nasked her to marry him she accepted his proposal. Then, just two weeks\nbefore her assignment to the Space Platform project, he vanished. Miss\nRoss was desperate and lovesick.\n\nOne day her telephone rang and his anguished voice told her he'd been\nabducted, and if she told the police he would be tortured to death. He\nbegged her not to do anything to cause him more torment than was already\nhis.\n\nShe'd been trying to keep him alive ever since. Once, when she couldn't\nbring herself to carry out an order she'd been given--with threats of\ntorment to him if she failed--she'd received a human finger in the mail,\nand a scrawled and blood-stained note which cried out of unspeakable\ntorment and begged her not to doom him to more.\n\nSo Miss Ross, who was Major Holt's secretary and one of his most trusted\nassistants, had been giving information to one group of saboteurs all\nthe while. She was the most dangerous security leak in the whole\nPlatform project.\n\nBut her fianc\u00e9 wasn't a captive. He was the head of that group of\nsaboteurs. He'd made love to her and proposed to her merely to prepare\nher to supply the information he wanted. He needed only to write a\nsufficiently agonized note, or gasp tormented pleas on a telephone, to\nget what he wanted.\n\nIncidentally, he still had all his fingers when Joe knocked him cold.\n\nSally had recognized him as the subject of a snapshot she'd once seen\nMiss Ross crying over. Miss Ross had hidden it hastily and told her it\nwas someone she had once loved, now dead. And this inadvertent\ndisclosure that Miss Ross was the security leak the Major had never had\na clue to could only have come about through such confusion as Mike had\ninstigated and Haney and the Chief and Joe had organized. But Joe\nlearned those facts only later.\n\nAt the moment, there was still the Platform to be gotten aloft. And\nthere was plenty of work to do. There were two small rips in the\nplating, caused by fragments of the exploded truck. There were some\nbullet holes. The Platform could resist small meteorites at forty-five\nmiles a second, but a high-velocity small-arm projectile could puncture\nit. Those scars of battle had to be welded shut. The rest of the\nscaffolding had to come down and the rest of the rocket tubes had to be\naffixed. And there was cleaning up to be done.\n\nThese things occupied the shift that came on at the time of the multiple\nsabotage assaults. At first the work was ragged. But the policy of\nturning the Security men into news broadcasters worked well. After all,\nthe Platform was a construction job and the men who worked on it were\nnot softies. Most of them had seen men killed before. Before the shift\nwas half over, a definite work rhythm was evident. Men had begun to take\nan even greater pride in the thing they had built, because it had been\nassailed and not destroyed. And the job was almost over.\n\nSally went back to her father's quarters, to try to sleep. Joe stayed in\nthe Shed. His throat was painful enough so that he didn't want to go to\nbed until he was genuinely tired, and he was thoroughly wrought up.\n\nMike the midget had gone peacefully to sleep again, curled up in a\ncorner of the outgoing screening room. His fellow midgets talked\nsatisfiedly among themselves. Presently, to show their superiority to\nmere pitched battles, two of them brought out a miniature pack of cards\nand started a card game while they waited for a bus to take them back to\nBootstrap.\n\nThe Chief's Indian associates loafed comfortably while waiting for the\nsame busses. Later they would put in for overtime--and get it. Haney\nmourned that he had been remote from the scene of action, and was merely\nresponsible for the presence and placing and firing of the machine guns\nthat had certainly kept the Platform from being blown up from below.\n\nIt seemed that nothing else would happen to bother anybody. But there\nwas one thing more.\n\nThat thing happened just two hours before it was time for the shift to\nchange once again, and when normal work was back in progress in the\nShed. Everything seemed fully organized and serene. Everything in the\nShed had settled down, and nothing had happened outside.\n\nThere was ample exterior protection, of course, but the outside-guard\nsystem hadn't had anything to do for a very long time. Men at radar\nscreens were bored and sleepy from sheer inactivity and silence. Pilots\nin jet planes two miles and five miles and eight miles high had long\nsince grown weary of the splendid view below them. After all, one can\nget very used to late, slanting moonlight on cloud masses far\nunderneath, and bright and hostile-seeming stars overhead.\n\nSo the thing was well timed.\n\nA Canadian station noticed the pip on its radar screen first. The radar\nobserver was puzzled by it. It could have been a meteor, and the\nCanadian observer at first thought it was. But it wasn't going quite\nfast enough, and it lasted too long. It was traveling six hundred\nseventy-two miles an hour, and it was headed due south at sixty thousand\nfeet. The speed could have been within reason--provided it didn't stay\nconstant. But it did. There was something traveling south at eleven\nmiles a minute or better. A mile in five-plus seconds. It didn't slow.\nIt didn't drop.\n\nThe Canadian radarman debated painfully. He stopped his companion from\nthe reading of a magazine article about chinchilla breeding in the home.\nHe showed him the pip, still headed south and almost at the limit of\nthis radar instrument's range. They discussed the thing dubiously. They\ndecided to report it.\n\nThey had a little trouble getting the call through. The night\nlong-distance operators were sleepy. Because of the difficulty of making\nthe call, the radarmen became obstinate and insisted on putting it\nthrough. They reported to Ottawa that some object flying at sixty\nthousand feet and six hundred seventy-two miles an hour was crossing\nCanada headed for the United States.\n\nThere was a further time loss. Somebody in authority had to be awakened,\nand somebody had to decide that a further report was justified. Then the\ntrick had to be accomplished, and a sleepy man in a bathrobe and\nslippers listened and said sleepily, \"Oh, of course you'll tell the\nAmericans. It's only neighborly!\" and padded back to his bed to go to\nsleep again. Then he waked up suddenly and began to sweat. He'd realized\nthat this might be the beginning of atomic war. So he set phone bells to\njangling furiously all over Canada, and jet planes began to boom in the\ndarkness.\n\nBut there was only one object in the sky. Over the Dakotas it went\nhigher. It went to seventy thousand feet, and then eighty. How this was\nmanaged is not completely known, because there are still some details of\nthat flight that have never been completely explained. But certainly\njatos flared briefly at some point, and the object reached ninety\nthousand feet where a jet motor would certainly be useless. And then,\nalmost certainly, rockets flared once more and well south of the Dakotas\nit started down in a trajectory like that of an artillery shell, but\nwith considerably higher speed than most artillery shells achieve.\n\nIt was at about this time that the siren in the Shed began its choppy,\nhiccoughing series of warm-up notes. The news from Canada arrived, as a\nmatter of fact, some thirty seconds after the outer-perimeter radar\nscreen around the Platform gave its warning. Then there was no\nhesitation or delay at all. Men were already tumbling out of bed at\nthree airfields, buckling helmets and hoping their oxygen tanks would\nfunction properly. Then the radars atop the Shed itself picked up the\nmoving speck. And small blue-white flames began to rise from the ground\nand go streaking away in the darkness in astonishing numbers.\n\nThe covers of the guns at the top of the Shed slid aside. Miles away,\njet planes shot skyward, and newly wakened pilots looked at their\nnight-fighting instruments and swore unbelievingly at the speed they\nwere told the plunging object was making. The jet pilots gave their\nmotors everything they could take, but it didn't look good.\n\nThe planes of the jet umbrella over the Shed stopped cruising and\nsprinted. And they were the only ones likely to get in front of the\nobject in time.\n\nInside the Shed, the siren howled dismally and all the Security men were\nsnapping: \"Radar alarm! All out! Radar alarm! All out!\"\n\nAnd men were moving fast, too. Some came down from the Platform on\nhoists, dropping with reckless speed to the floor level. Some didn't\nwait for a turn at that. They slid down one upright, swung around the\ncrosspiece on the level below, and slid down another vertical pipe. For\na minute or more it looked as if the scaffolds oozed black droplets\nwhich slid down its pipes. But the drops were men. The floor became\nspeckled and spotted with dots running for its exits.\n\nThe siren ceased its wailing and its noise went down and down in pitch\nuntil it was a baritone moan that dropped to bass and ceased. Then there\nwas no sound but the men moving to get out of the Shed. There were\ntrucks, too. Those that had been loading with dismantled scaffolding\nroared for the doors to get out and away. Some men jumped on board as\nthey passed. The exit doors swung up to let them go.\n\nBut it was very quiet in the Shed, at that. There was no noise but a few\nfleeing trucks, and the murmur which was the voices of the Security men\nhurrying the work crew out. There was less to hear than went on\nordinarily. And it was a long distance across the floor of the Shed.\n\nJoe stood with his fists clenched absurdly. This could only be an air\nattack. An air attack could only mean an atom-bomb attack. And if there\nwas an atom bomb dropped on the Shed, there'd be no use getting outside.\nIt wouldn't be merely a fission bomb. It would be a hell bomb--a bomb\nwhich used the kind of bomb that shattered Hiroshima only as a primer\nfor the real explosive. Nobody could hope to get beyond the radius of\nits destruction before it hit!\n\nJoe heard himself raging. He'd thought of Sally. She'd be in the range\nof annihilation, too. And Joe knew such fury and hatred--because of\nSally--that he forgot everything else.\n\nHe didn't run. He couldn't escape. He couldn't fight back. But because\nhe hated, he had to do something to defy.\n\nHe found himself moving toward the Platform, his jaws clenched. It was\npure, blind, instinctive defiance.\n\nHe was not the only one to have that reaction. Men running toward the\nsidewall exits began to get out of breath from their running. They\nslowed. Presently they stopped. They scowled and raged, like Joe. Some\nof them looked with burning eyes up at the roof of the Shed, though\ntheir thoughts went on beyond it. The security guards repeated, \"Radar\nalarm! All out! Radar alarm! All out!\"\n\nSomeone snarled, \"Nuts to that!\"\n\nJoe saw a man walking in the same direction as himself. He was walking\ndeliberately back to the Platform. Somebody else was headed back too....\n\nVery peculiarly, almost all the men on the floor had ceased to run. They\nbegan to gather in little groups. They knew flight was useless. They\ntalked briefly. Profanely. Here and there men started disgustedly back\ntoward the Platform. Their lips moved in expressions of furious scorn.\nTheir scorn was of themselves.\n\nThere was a gathering of men about the base of the framework that still\npartly veiled the Platform. They tended to face outward, angrily, and to\nclench their fists.\n\nThen somebody started an engine. A man began to climb furiously back to\nwhere he had been at work. Quite unreasonably, other men followed him.\n\nHammers began defiantly and enragedly to sound.\n\nThe work crew in the Shed went defiantly and furiously back to work. A\nclamor was set up that was almost the normal working noise. It was the\nonly possible way in which those men could express the raging contempt\nthey felt for those who would destroy the thing they worked on.\n\nBut there were some other men who could do more. There were three levels\nof jet planes above the Shed, and they could dive. The highest one got\nfirst to the line along which the missile from an unknown place was\nplunging toward the Shed. That plane steadied on a collision course and\nlet go its wing load of rockets. It peeled off and got out of the way.\nSeconds later the others from the jet umbrella were arriving. A tiny\nspray of proximity-fused rockets blazed furiously toward the invisible\nthing from the heights.\n\nOther planes and yet others came hurtling to the line their radars\nbriskly computed for them. There were more rockets....\n\nThe black-painted thing with more than the speed of an artillery shell\nplunged into a miniature hail of rockets. They flamed viciously. Half a\ndozen--a dozen--explosions that were pure futility.\n\nThen there was an explosion that was not. Nobody saw it, because its\npuny detonation was instantly wiped out in a blaze of such incredible\nincandescence that the aluminum paint on jet planes still miles away was\nscorched and blistered instantly. The light of that flare was seen for\nhundreds of miles. The sound--later on--was heard farther still. And the\ndesert vegetation miles below the hell bomb showed signs of searing when\nthe morning came.\n\nBut the thing from the north was vaporized, utterly, some forty-five\nmiles from its target. The damage it did was negligible.\n\nThe work on the preparation for the Platform's take-off went on. When\nthe all-clear signal sounded inside the Shed, nobody paid any attention.\nThey were too busy.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nOn the day of the take-off there were a number of curious side-effects\nfrom the completion of the Space Platform. There was a very small\ncountry on the other side of the world which determined desperately to\nrisk its existence on the success of the Platform's flight. It had to\nchoose between abject submission to a powerful neighbor, or the\npossibility of a revolution in which its neighbor's troops would take on\nthe semblance of citizens for street-fighting purposes. If the Platform\ngot aloft, it could defy its neighbor. And in a grim gamble, it did.\n\nThere was also a last-ditch fight in the United Nations, wherein the\nPlatform was denounced and a certain block of associated countries\nissued an ultimatum, threatening to bolt the international organization\nif the Platform went aloft. And again there had to be a grim gamble. If\nthe Platform did not take to space and so furnish ultimately a guarantee\nof peace, the United Nations would face the alternatives of becoming a\nmilitary alliance for atomic war, or something less than an\ninternational debating society.\n\nOf course there were less significant results. There were already\nfourteen popular songs ready for broadcast, orchestrated and rehearsed\nwith singers ready to saturate the ears of the listening public. They\nranged from _We've Got a Warship in the Sky_, which was more or less\njingoistic, to a boy-and-girl melody entitled _We'll Have a Moon Just\nfor Us Two_. The latter tune had been stolen from a hit of four years\nbefore, which in turn had been stolen from a hit of six years before\nthat, and it had been stolen from a still earlier bit of Bach, so it was\na rather pretty melody.\n\nAnd of course there was a super-colossal motion picture epic in color\nand with musical numbers, champing in its film cans for simultaneous\nfirst-run showings in eight different key cities. It was titled _To the\nStars_, and three separate endings had been filmed, of which the\nappropriate one would of course be used in the eight separate world\n_premi\u00e8res_. One ending had the Platform fail due to sabotage, and the\nhero--played by an actor who had interrupted his seventh honeymoon to\nplay the part--splendidly prepared to build it all over again. The\nsecond ending closed with the Platform headed for Alpha Centaurus--which\nwas hardly the intention of anybody outside of filmdom. The third ending\nwas secret, but it was said that hard-boiled motion-picture executives\nhad cried like babies when it was thrown on preview screens.\n\nThese, of course, were merely sidelights. They were not very important\nin the Shed. There, work went on at a feverish rate although there was\nno longer any construction work to be done. In theory, therefore, the\nmembers of welders and pipe-fitters and steel-construction and\nelectrical and other unions should have retired gracefully to Bootstrap.\nMembers of building-maintenance and rigging and wrecking and other\nassorted unions should have been gathered together in far cities,\nscreened by security, and brought to Bootstrap and paid overtime to pull\nup wood-block flooring and unbolt and jack out the proper sections of\nthe Shed's eastern wall.\n\nBut if there had been anything of that sort tried, it would have\nproduced bloodshed. The men who'd built the Platform were going to see\nit depart this Earth or else. They'd never have a second chance. It\nwould work the first time or it wouldn't work at all.\n\nSo the Platform was made ready for its take-off by the men who had made\nit. A gigantic section--two full gores--of the Shed's wall was unbolted\nin two pieces, and each piece thrust outward at the top and bottom, so\nthat they were offset from the rest of the huge half-globe. There were\nhundreds of wheels at their bottom which for the first time touched the\nsixteen lines of rails laid with unbelievable solidity around the\noutside of the Shed. And then the monstrous sections were rolled aside.\nA vast opening resulted, and morning sunlight smote for the first time\nmankind's very first space craft.\n\nJoe saw the sunlight strike, and his first sensation was of\ndisappointment. The normal shape of the Platform was ungainly, but now\nit was practically hidden by the solid-fuel rockets which would consume\nthemselves in their firing. Also, the floor of the Shed looked strange.\nIt was littered with the clumsy shapes of pushpots, trucked to this\nplace in an unending stream all night long. A very young lieutenant from\nthe pushpot airfield hunted up Joe and assured him that every drop of\nfuel in every pushpot's tanks had been tested twice--once in the storage\ntanks, and again in the pushpots. Joe thanked him very politely.\n\nThere was no longer any scaffolding. There were no trucks left except\ntwo gigantic cranes, which could handle the pushpots like so many toys.\nAnd the effect of sunlight pouring into the Shed seemed strange indeed.\n\nOutside, there were carpenters hammering professionally upon a hasty\ngrandstand of timber. Most of the carpenters would have been handier\nwith rivet guns or welding torches, but it would have been indiscreet to\ncomment. As fast as a final timber was spiked in place, somebody hastily\nwound it with very tawdry bunting. Men were stringing wires to the\ngrandstand, and other men were setting up television and movie cameras.\nTwo Security men grimly stood by each camera amid a glittering\nmiscellany of microphones.\n\nJoe was lucky. Or perhaps Sally pulled wires. Anyhow, the two of them\nhad a vantage point for which many other people would have paid\nastonishing sums. They waited where the circular ramp between the two\nskins of the Shed was broken by the removal of the doorway. They were\nhalfway up the curve of the Shed's roof, at the edge of the great\nopening, and they could see everything, from the pushpot pilots as they\nwere checked into their contraptions, to the sedate arrival of the big\nbrass at the grandstand below.\n\nThere was a reverberant humming from the Shed now. It might have been\nthe humming of wind blowing across its open section. Joe and Sally saw a\ngrim knot of Security men escorting four crew members to a flight of\nwooden steps that led up to a lower air-lock door--Joe had reason to\nremember that door--and watched them enter and close the air lock behind\nthem. Then the security men pulled away the wooden stairs and hauled\nthem completely away. There were a very few highly trusted men making\nfinal inspections of the Platform's exterior. One of them was nearly on\na level with Joe and Sally. Other men were already lowering themselves\ndown on ropes that they later jerked free, but this last man on top did\na very human thing. When he'd finished his check-up to the last least\ndetail, he pulled something out of his hip pocket. It was a tobacco can\nfull of black paint. There was a brush with it. He painted his name on\nthe silvery plates of the Platform, \"C. J. Adams, Jr.,\" and satisfiedly\nbegan his descent to the ground. His name would go up with the Platform\nand be visible for uncounted generations--if all went well. He reached\nthe ground and walked away, contented.\n\nThe cranes began their task. Each one reached down deliberately and\npicked up a pushpot. They swung the pushpots to vertical positions and\npresented them precisely to the Platform's side. They clung there\nridiculously. Magnetic grapples, of course. Joe and Sally, at the end of\nthe corridor in the wall, could see the heads of the pushpot pilots in\ntheir plastic domes.\n\nMusic blared from behind the grandstand. The seats were being filled.\nBut naturally, the least important personages were arriving first. There\nwere women in costumes to which they had given infinite thought--and\nnobody looked at them except other women. There was khaki. There were\ngray business suits--slide-rule men, these, who had done the brain-work\nbehind the Platform's design. Then black broadcloth. Politicians, past\nquestion. There is nothing less impressive from a height of two hundred\nfeet than a pot-bellied man in black broadcloth walking on the ground.\n\nThere were men in uniforms which were not of the United States armed\nforces. They ran heavily to medals, which glittered. There were more\narrivals, and more, and more. The newsreel and TV cameras nosed around.\n\nThe cranes worked methodically. They dipped, and deftly picked up a\nthing shaped like the top half of a loaf of bread. They swung that metal\nthing to the Platform's side. Each time it clung fast, like a snail or\nslug to the surface on which it crawls. Many pushpots clung even to the\nrocket tubes--the same tubes that would presently burn away and vanish.\nSo Joe and Sally saw the pushpots in a new aspect: blunt metal slugs\nwith gaping mouths which were their air scoops.\n\nThe tinny music from below cut off. Somebody began an oration. The men\nwho had built the Platform were not interested in fine phrases, but this\nevent was broadcast everywhere, and some people might possibly tune to\nthe channels that carried the speakers and their orations rather than\nthe channels that showed the huge, bleak, obscured shape of the monster\nthat was headed either for empty space or pure disaster.\n\nThe speaker stopped, and another took his place. Then another. One man\nspoke for less than a minute, and the stands went wild! But the one who\nfollowed made splendid gestures. He talked and talked and talked. The\ncranes cleaned up the last of the waiting pushpots, and the Platform\nitself was practically invisible.\n\nThe cranes backed off and went away, clanking. The orator raised his\nvoice. It made small echoes in the vast cavern that was the Shed.\nSomebody plucked the speaker's arm. He ended abruptly and sat down,\nwiping his forehead with a huge blue handkerchief.\n\nThere was a roar. A pushpot had started its motor. Another roar.\nAnother. One by one, the multitude of clustering objects added to the\ndin. In the open a single jet was appalling. Here, the noise became a\nsound which was no longer a sound. It became a tumult which by pure\nvolume ceased to be anything one's ears could understand. It reached a\npeak and held there. Then, abruptly, all the motors slackened in unison,\nand then roared more loudly. The group controls within the Platform were\nbeing tested. Three--four--five times the tumult faded to the merely\nunbearable and went up to full volume again.\n\nJoe felt Sally plucking at his arm. He turned, and saw a jet plane's\nunderbelly, very close, and its swept-back wings. It was climbing\nstraight up. Then he saw another jet plane streaking for the great\ndome's open door. It moved with incredible velocity. It jerked upward\nand climbed over the Shed's curve and was gone. But there were others\nand others and others.\n\nThese were the fighter ships of the jet-plane guard. For months on end\nthey had flown above the Shed, protecting it. Now they were going aloft\nto relieve the present watchers. They were rising to spread out as an\ninterceptor screen for hundreds of miles in every direction, in case\nsomebody should be so foolish as to try again the exploit of the night\nbefore. They would not see the monster in the Shed again. So in a single\nline which reached to the horizon, they made this roaring run for the\none last glimpse which was their right. Joe saw tiny specks come\nstreaking down out of the sky to queue up for this privileged view of\nthe Platform before it rose.\n\nSuddenly they were gone, and Joe felt that tingling sense of pride which\nnever comes from the sensation of sharing in mere power or splendor or\npompous might, but is so certain when the human touch modifies\nmagnificence.\n\nAnd then the roaring of the pushpot engines achieved an utterly\nimpossible volume. The whole interior of the Shed was misty now, but\nshining in the morning light.\n\nAnd the Platform moved.\n\nAt first it was a mere stirring. It turned ever so slightly to one side,\npivoting on the ways that had supported it during building. It turned\nback and to the other side. The vapor thickened. From each jet motor a\nblast of blue-white flame poured down, and the moisture in the earth was\nturning into steam and stray wood-blocks into acrid smoke. The Platform\nturned precisely and exactly back to its original position, and Joe's\nheart pounded in his throat, because he knew that the turning had been\ndone with the gyros, and they had been handled by the pilot gyros for\nwhich he was responsible.\n\nThen the Platform moved again. It lifted by inches and swayed forward.\nIt checked, and lurched again, and went staggering toward the great\nopening before it. A part of its base gouged a deep furrow in the\nearthen floor.\n\nThe noise increased from the incredible to the inconceivable. It seemed\nas if all the thunders since time began had returned to bellow because\nthe Platform moved.\n\nAnd it floated and bumped out of the Shed. It staggered toward the east.\nIts keel was perhaps, at this point, as much as three feet above the\nground, but the jet motors cast up blinding clouds of dust and smoke and\neven those afoot could not be sure.\n\nThere was confusion. The smoke and vapor splashed out in every possible\ndirection. Joe saw frantic movement, and he realized that the uniforms\nand the frock coats were scrambling to escape the fumes. The\nkhaki-tinted specks which were men seemed to run. The frock coats ran.\nThe carefully-thought-out brighter specks which were women ran gasping\nand choking from the smoke. One stout figure toppled, scrambled up, and\nscuttled frantically for safety.\n\nBut the Platform was in motion now. It was a hundred yards beyond the\nShed wall. Two hundred. Three.... It slowly gathered speed. A half-mile\nfrom the Shed it was definitely clear of the ground. It left a trail of\nscorched, burnt desert behind....\n\nIt moved almost swiftly, now. Two miles from the Shed it was fifteen\nfeet above the earth. Three miles, and a clear strip of sunlight showed\nbeneath it. And it was still accelerating. At four miles and five and\nsix....\n\nIt was aloft, climbing with seemingly infinite slowness, with all the\nhundreds of straining, thrusting, clumsy pushpots clinging to it and\npushing it ever ahead and upward.\n\nIt went smoothly toward the east. It continued to gain speed. It did not\nseem to dip toward the horizon at all. It went on and on, dwindling from\na giant to a spot and then to a little dark speck in the sky that still\nwent on and on until even Joe could not pretend to himself that he still\nsaw it. Even then there was probably a tiny droning noise in the air,\nbut nobody who had watched the take-off could possibly hear it.\n\nThen Joe looked at Sally and she at him. And Joe was grinning like an\nape with excitement and relief and triumph which was at once his own and\nthat of all his dreams. Sally's eyes were shining and exultant. She\nhugged him in purest exuberance, crying that the Space Platform was up,\nwas up, was up....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt sundown they were waiting on the porch of the Major's quarters behind\nthe Shed. The Major was there, and Haney and the Chief and Mike and Joe.\nThe Major's whole look had changed. He seemed to have shrunk, and he\nlooked more tired than any man should ever be allowed to get. But his\njob was done, and the reaction was enough to explain everything. He sat\nin an easy chair with a glass beside him, and he looked as if nothing on\nearth could make him move a finger. But nevertheless he was waiting.\n\nSally came out with a tray. She gravely passed around the glasses and\nthe cakes that went with them. Then she sat down on the porch steps\nbeside Joe. She looked at him and nodded in friendly fashion. And Joe\nwas inordinately approving of Sally, but he felt awkward at showing it\ntoo plainly in her father's presence.\n\nMike said defiantly: \"But still it woulda been easier to get it up there\nif it'd been built for guys like me!\"\n\nNobody contradicted him. He was right. Anyhow every one of them felt too\nmuch relaxed and relieved to enter into argument.\n\nHaney said dreamily: \"Everything broke right. Everything! They got in a\njet stream like they expected, and it gave 'em three hundred miles extra\neast-speed. They were eight miles up when the pushpots fired their\njatos, an' twelve miles up when the pushpots let go--they musta near\nbroke their pilots' necks when they caught their motors again! And the\nPlatform's rockets fired just right, makin' flames a mile long, an' they\nwere goin' then--what were they makin'?\"\n\n\"Who cares?\" asked the Chief peacefully. \"Plenty!\"\n\n\"Six hundred from the pushpots,\" murmured Haney, frowning, \"an' three\nhundred from the jet stream, and then there was the jatos that all let\ngo at once, an' then there was eight hundred from the earth\nrotatin'----\"\n\n\"They had ten per cent of their rockets unfired when they got into their\norbit,\" said Mike authoritatively. \"They were two thousand miles up when\nthey passed over India and now they're four thousand miles up and the\norbit's stable. This is their third round, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Will be,\" said the Chief.\n\nJoe and Sally sat watching the west. The Space Platform went around the\nEarth from west to east, like Earth's natural moon, but because of its\nspeed it would rise in the west and set in the east six times in every\ntwenty-four hours.\n\nMajor Holt spoke suddenly. The austerity had gone out of his manner with\nhis energy. He said quietly: \"You four--you gave me the worst scare I've\never had in my life. But do you realize that that sabotage attempt with\nthe two truck-loads of explosive--do you realize that they'd have gotten\nthe Platform if it hadn't been for that crazy trick you four planned,\nand the precautions we took because of it?\"\n\nJoe said depreciatingly: \"It was just luck that they happened to pick\nthe same time, and that Haney was up there with those machine-gunners at\nthe right moment. It was good luck, but it was luck.\"\n\nThe Major said effortfully: \"There are people called accident prones.\nAccidents happen all around them, and nobody knows why. You\nfour--perhaps Joe especially--are not accident prones. You seem to be\nsomething antithetic to accidents. I would hesitate to credit your\nusefulness to your brains. Especially Joe's brains. I have known him too\nlong. But--ah--Washington does not look at it in exactly the same way.\"\n\nSally touched Joe warningly. But her face was very bright and proud. Joe\nfelt queer.\n\n\"Joe,\" said the Major tiredly, \"was an alternate for membership in the\nPlatform's crew. But for penicillin, or something of the sort that made\na sick man get well quickly, Joe would be up there in the Platform's\norbit now. His--ah--record in the instruction he did take was\nsatisfactory. And--ah--all four of you were very useful in the last\nstages of the building of the Platform. Again Joe especially.\nHis--ah--co-operation with higher authorities has produced--ah--very\nfavorable comments. So it is felt that he should have some recognition.\nAll of you, of course, but Joe especially. So----\"\n\nJoe felt himself going white.\n\n\"Joe,\" said the Major, \"is to be offered an appointment as skipper of\na ferry rocket, carrying supplies and crew reliefs to the Platform.\nHis rocket will carry a crew of four, including himself.\nHis--ah--recommendations for membership in his crew will have\nconsiderable weight.\"\n\nThere was a buzzing in Joe's ears. He wanted to cry and to dance, and\nespecially right then he would have liked very much to kiss Sally. It\nwould have been the only really appropriate way to express his emotions.\n\nMike said in a fierce, strained voice: \"Joe! I can do anything a big\nelephant of a guy can do, and I only use a quarter of the grub and air!\nYou've got to take me, Joe! You've got to!\"\n\nThe Chief said benignly: \"H'm.... I'm gonna be in charge of the engine\nroom, an' Haney'll be bos'n--let Joe try to take off without us!--an'\nthat don't leave you a rating, Mike, unless you're willin' to be just\nplain crew!\"\n\nSlowly Sally turned her face away from Joe and looked up.\n\nThen they all saw it. A telescope, maybe, would have shown it as the\nthing they'd worked on and fought for. But it didn't look like that to\nthe naked eye. It was just a tiny speck of incandescence gliding with\ngrave deliberation across the sky. It was a sliver of sunlight, moving\nas they watched.\n\nThere were a good many millions of people watching it, just then, as it\nfloated aloft in emptiness. To some it meant peace and hope and\nconfidence of a serene old age and a life worth living for their\nchildren and their children's children. To some it was a fascinating\ntechnical achievement. To a few it meant that if wars had ended, and\nturmoil was no longer the norm of life on earth, this thing would be\ntheir destruction. But it meant something to everybody in the world. To\nthe people who had been unable to do anything to help it except to pray\nfor it, perhaps it meant most of all.\n\nJoe said quietly: \"We'll be going up there to visit it. All of us.\"\n\nHe realized that Sally's hand was tightly clasped in his. She said: \"Me\ntoo, Joe?\"\n\n\"Some day,\" said Joe, \"you too.\"\n\nHe stood up to watch more closely. Sally stood beside him. The others\ncame to look. They made a group on the lawn, as people were grouped\neverywhere in all the world to gaze up at it.\n\nThe Space Platform, a tiny sliver of sunshine, an infinitesimal speck of\ngolden light, moved sedately across the deepening blue toward the east.\nToward the night.\n\n\n\n\nTHESE SYMBOLS GUARANTEE THE BEST IN READING\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nPOCKET BOOKS, INC. is the largest publisher of books in the world today\nin terms of the number of copies it has sold and is currently selling.\nOver 400,000,000 copies have carried the symbol of \"Gertrude,\" the\nlittle kangaroo which is the colophon of POCKET BOOKS, INC.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
