Harry Collins--1997\n\n[Illustration: The evils of long and dangerous years finally erupted\nin blood.]\n\n\nThe telescreen lit up promptly at eight a.m. Smiling Brad came on with\nhis usual greeting. \"Good morning--it's a beautiful day in Chicagee!\"\n\nHarry Collins rolled over and twitched off the receiver. \"This I\ndoubt,\" he muttered. He sat up and reached into the closet for his\nclothing.\n\nVisitors--particularly feminine ones--were always exclaiming over the\nadvantages of Harry's apartment. \"So convenient,\" they would say.\n\"Everything handy, right within reach. And think of all the extra\nsteps you save!\"\n\nOf course most of them were just being polite and trying to cheer\nHarry up. They knew damned well that he wasn't living in one room\nthrough any choice of his own. The Housing Act was something you just\ncouldn't get around; not in Chicagee these days. A bachelor was\nentitled to one room--no more and no less. And even though Harry was\nmaking a speedy buck at the agency, he couldn't hope to beat the\nregulations.\n\nThere was only one way to beat them and that was to get married.\nMarriage would automatically entitle him to two rooms--_if_ he could\nfind them someplace.\n\nMore than a few of his feminine visitors had hinted at just that, but\nHarry didn't respond. Marriage was no solution, the way he figured it.\nHe knew that he couldn't hope to locate a two-room apartment any\ncloser than eighty miles away. It was bad enough driving forty miles\nto and from work every morning and night without doubling the\ndistance. If he did find a bigger place, that would mean a three-hour\ntrip each way on one of the commutrains, and the commutrains were\nmurder. The Black Hole of Calcutta, on wheels.\n\nBut then, everything was murder, Harry reflected, as he stepped from\nthe toilet to the sink, from the sink to the stove, from the stove to\nthe table.\n\nPowdered eggs for breakfast. That was murder, too. But it was a fast,\ncheap meal, easy to prepare, and the ingredients didn't waste a lot of\nstorage space. The only trouble was, he hated the way they tasted.\nHarry wished he had time to eat his breakfasts in a restaurant. He\ncould afford the price, but he couldn't afford to wait in line more\nthan a half-hour or so. His office schedule at the agency started\npromptly at ten-thirty. And he didn't get out until three-thirty; it\nwas a long, hard five-hour day. Sometimes he wished he worked in the\nNew Philly area, where a four-hour day was the rule. But he supposed\nthat wouldn't mean any real saving in time, because he'd have to live\nfurther out. What was the population in New Philly now? Something like\n63,000,000, wasn't it? Chicagee was much smaller--only 38,000,000,\nthis year.\n\n_This_ year. Harry shook his head and took a gulp of the Instantea.\nYes, this year the population was 38,000,000, and the boundaries of\nthe community extended north to what used to be the old Milwaukee and\nsouth past Gary. What would it be like _next_ year, and the year\nfollowing?\n\nLately that question had begun to haunt Harry. He couldn't quite\nfigure out why. After all, it was none of his business, really. He had\na good job, security, a nice place just two hours from the Loop. He\neven drove his own car. What more could he ask?\n\nAnd why did he have to start the day like this, with a blinding\nheadache?\n\nHarry finished his Instantea and considered the matter. Yes, it was\nbeginning again, just as it had on almost every morning for the past\nmonth. He'd sit down at the table, eat his usual breakfast, and end up\nwith a headache. Why?\n\nIt wasn't the food; for a while he'd deliberately varied his diet, but\nthat didn't make any difference. And he'd had his usual monthly\ncheckup not more than ten days ago, only to be assured there was\nnothing wrong with him. Still, the headaches persisted. Every morning,\nwhen he'd sit down and jerk his head to the left like this--\n\nThat was it. Jerking his head to the left. It always seemed to trigger\nthe pain. But why? And where had he picked up this habit of jerking\nhis head to the left?\n\nHarry didn't know.\n\nHe glanced at his watch. It was almost nine, now. High time that he\ngot started. He reached over to the interapartment video and dialled\nthe garage downstairs.\n\n\"Bill,\" he said. \"Can you bring my car around to Number Three?\"\n\nThe tiny face in the hand-screen grinned sheepishly. \"Mr. Collins,\nain't it? Gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Collins. Night crew took on a new man,\nhe must have futzed around with the lists, and I can't find your\nnumber.\"\n\nHarry sighed. \"It's one-eight-seven-three-dash-five,\" he said. \"Light\nblue Pax, two-seater. Do you want the license number, too?\"\n\n\"No, just your parking number. I'll recognize it when I see it. But\nGod only knows what level it's on. That night man really--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Harry interrupted. \"How soon?\"\n\n\"Twenty minutes or so. Maybe half an hour.\"\n\n\"Half an hour? I'll be late. Hurry it up!\"\n\nHarry clicked the video and shook his head. Half an hour! Well, you\nhad to expect these things if you wanted to be independent and do your\nown driving today. If he wanted to work his priority through the\noffice, he could get his application honored on the I.C. Line within a\nmonth. But the I.C. was just another commutrain, and he couldn't take\nit. Standing and swaying for almost two hours, fighting the crowds,\nbattling his way in and out of the sidewalk escalators. Besides, there\nwas always the danger of being crushed. He'd seen an old man trampled\nto death on a Michigan Boulevard escalator-feeder, and he'd never\nforgotten it.\n\nBeing afraid was only a partial reason for his reluctance to change.\nThe worst thing, for Harry, was the thought of all those people; the\nforced bodily contact, the awareness of smothered breathing, odors,\nand the crushing confinement of flesh against flesh. It was bad enough\nin the lines, or on the streets. The commutrain was just too much.\n\nYet, as a small boy, Harry could remember the day when he'd loved such\ntrips. Sitting there looking out of the window as the scenery whirled\npast--that was always a thrill when you were a little kid. How long\nago had that been? More than twenty years, wasn't it?\n\nNow there weren't any seats, and no windows. Which was just as well,\nprobably, because the scenery didn't whirl past any more, either.\nInstead, there was a stop at every station on the line, and a constant\nbattle as people jockeyed for position to reach the exit-doors in\ntime.\n\nNo, the car was better.\n\nHarry reached for a container in the cabinet and poured out a couple\nof aspirystamines. That ought to help the headache. At least until he\ngot to the office. Then he could start with the daily quota of\nyellowjackets. Meanwhile, getting out on the street might help him,\ntoo. A shame there wasn't a window in this apartment, but then, what\ngood would it do, really? All he could see through it would be the\nnext apartment.\n\nHe shrugged and picked up his coat. Nine-thirty, time to go\ndownstairs. Maybe the car would be located sooner than Bill had\npromised; after all, he had nine assistants, and not everybody went to\nwork on this first daylight shift.\n\nHarry walked down the hall and punched the elevator button. He looked\nat the indicator, watched the red band move towards the numeral of\nthis floor, then sweep past it.\n\n\"Full up!\" he muttered. \"Oh, well.\"\n\nHe reached out and touched both sides of the corridor. That was\nanother thing he disliked; these narrow corridors. Two people could\nscarcely squeeze past one another without touching. Of course, it did\nsave space to build apartments this way, and space was at a premium.\nBut Harry couldn't get used to it. Now he remembered some of the old\nbuildings that were still around when he was a little boy--\n\nThe headache seemed to be getting worse instead of better. Harry\nlooked at the indicator above the other elevator entrance. The red\nband was crawling upward, passing him to stop on 48. That was the top\nfloor. Now it was moving down, down; stopping on 47, 46, 45, 44, 43,\nand--here it was!\n\n\"Stand back, please!\" said the tape. Harry did his best to oblige, but\nthere wasn't much room. A good two dozen of his upstairs neighbors\njammed the compartment. Harry thought he recognized one or two of the\nmen, but he couldn't be sure. There were so many people, so many\nfaces. After a while it got so they all seemed to look alike. Yes, and\nbreathed alike, and felt alike when you were squeezed up against them,\nand you were always being squeezed up against them, wherever you went.\nAnd you could smell them, and hear them wheeze and cough, and you went\nfalling down with them into a bottomless pit where your head began to\nthrob and throb and it was hard to move away from all that heat and\npressure. It was hard enough just to keep from screaming--\n\nThen the door opened and Harry was catapulted out into the lobby. The\nmob behind him pushed and clawed because they were in a hurry; they\nwere always in a hurry these days, and if you got in their way they'd\ntrample you down like that old man had been trampled down; there was\nno room for one man in a crowd any more.\n\nHarry blinked and shook his head.\n\nHe gripped the edge of the wall and clung there in an effort to avoid\nbeing swept out of the lobby completely. His hands were sticky with\nperspiration. They slipped off as he slowly inched his way back\nthrough the crush of the mob.\n\n\"Wait for me!\" he called. \"Wait for me, I'm going down!\" But his voice\nwas lost in the maelstrom of sound just as his body was lost in the\nmaelstrom of motion. Besides, an automatic elevator cannot hear. It is\nmerely a mechanism that goes up and down, just like the other\nmechanisms that go in and out, or around and around, and you get\ncaught up in them the way a squirrel gets caught in a squirrel-cage\nand you race and race, and the best you can hope for is to keep up\nwith the machinery.\n\nThe elevator door clanged shut before Harry could reach it. He waited\nfor another car to arrive, and this time he stood aside as the crowd\nemerged, then darted in behind them.\n\nThe car descended to the first garage level, and Harry stood gulping\ngratefully in the comparative isolation. There weren't more than ten\npeople accompanying him.\n\nHe emerged on the ramp, gave his number to the attendant, and waved at\nBill in his office. Bill seemed to recognize him; at least he nodded,\nbriefly. No sense trying to talk--not in this sullen subterranea,\nfilled with the booming echo of exhausts, the despairing shriek of\nbrakes. Headlights flickered in the darkness as cars whirled past,\nascending and descending on the loading platforms. The signal systems\nwinked from the walls, and tires screeched defiance to the warning\nbells.\n\nOld-fashioned theologians, Harry remembered, used to argue whether\nthere really was a Hell, and if so, had it been created by God or the\nDevil? Too bad they weren't around today to get an answer to their\nquestions. There _was_ a Hell, and it had been created by General\nMotors.\n\nHarry's temples began to throb. Through blurred eyes, he saw the\nattendant beckoning him down the line to a platform marked _Check-Out\n#3_. He stood there with a cluster of others, waiting.\n\nWhat was the matter with him today, anyway? First the headache, and\nnow his feet were hurting. Standing around waiting, that's what did\nit. This eternal waiting. When he was a kid, the grownups were always\ncomplaining about the long seven-hour work days and how they cut into\ntheir leisure time. Well, maybe they had reason to gripe, but at least\nthere _was_ some leisure before work began or after it was through.\nNow that extra time was consumed in waiting. Standing in line,\nstanding in crowds, wearing yourself out doing nothing.\n\nStill, this time it wasn't really so bad. Within ten minutes the light\nblue Pax rolled up before him. Harry climbed in as the attendant slid\nout from behind the wheel and prepared to leave.\n\nThen a fat man appeared, running along the ramp. He gestured wildly\nwith a plump thumb. Harry nodded briefly, and the fat man hurled\nhimself into the seat beside him and slammed the door.\n\nThey were off. Harry read the signals impatiently, waiting for the\ngreen _Go_. The moment he saw it he gunned his motor and got the car\nup to twenty-two and zipped away.\n\nThat's what he liked, that's what he always waited for. Of course it\nwas dangerous, here in the tunnel system under the garage, but Harry\nalways got a thrill out of speed. The Pax could do thirty-five or even\nforty, probably, on a theoretical open road. Still, twenty-two was\nenough to satisfy Harry.\n\nHe whizzed up the ramp, turned, headed for the street-level, then\nbraked and waited for the signal to emerge.\n\nHarsh sunlight pierced the smog and he felt his eyes watering. Now the\nstreet noises assailed his ears; the grinding of gears, the revving of\nmotors. But at least the total volume was lower, and with the windows\ntightly closed against the acrid air, he could hear.\n\nTurning to the fat man beside him he said, \"Hello, Frazer. What's the\nurgency?\"\n\n\"Got to get downtown before eleven,\" the fat man answered. \"Board\nmeeting today, but I forgot about it. Knew I wouldn't have time to\nwait for the car, and I was hoping I'd find someone who'd give me a\nlift. Lucky for me that you came along when you did.\"\n\nHarry nodded but did not reply. At the moment he was trying to edge\ninto the traffic beyond. It flowed, bumper to bumper, in a steady\nstream; a stream moving at the uniform and prescribed rate of fifteen\nmiles per hour. He released his brakes and the Pax nosed forward until\na truck sounded its horn in ominous warning. The noise hurt Harry's\nhead; he winced and grimaced.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Frazer.\n\n\"Headache,\" Harry muttered. He menaced a Chevsoto with his bumper.\n\"Damn it, I thought they didn't allow those big four-passenger jobs on\nthis arterial during rush hours!\" Gradually he managed to turn until\nhe was in the righthand lane. \"There,\" he said. \"We're off.\"\n\nAnd so they were, for all of three minutes, with the speed set at\nfifteen on autopilot. Then a signal went into action somewhere up\nahead, and the procession halted. Harry flicked his switch. As was\ncustomary, horns sounded indignantly on all sides--a mechanical\nprotest against a mechanical obstruction. Harry winced again.\n\n\"Hangover?\" Frazer asked, solicitously. \"Try aspirystamine.\"\n\nHarry shook his head. \"No hangover. And I've already taken three,\nthanks. Nothing does any good. So I guess it's just up to you.\"\n\n\"Up to me?\" Frazer was genuinely puzzled. \"What can I do about your\nheadaches?\"\n\n\"You're on the Board of City Planners, aren't you?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Well, I've got a suggestion for you to give to them. Tell them to\nstart planning to drop a couple of heavy thermo-nucs on this area.\nClean out twenty or thirty million people. We'd never miss 'em.\"\n\nFrazer chuckled wryly. \"I wish I had a buck for every time I've heard\n_that_ suggestion.\"\n\n\"Ever stop to think why you hear it so often? It's because everybody\nfeels the same way--we can't take being hemmed in like this.\"\n\n\"Well, a bomb wouldn't help. You know that.\" Frazer pursed his lips.\n\"Robertson figured out what would happen, with the chain-reaction.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry glanced sideways at his companion as the car started forward\nonce again. \"I've always wondered about that,\" he said. \"Seriously, I\nmean. Is the story really true, or is it just some more of this\ngovernment propaganda you fellows like to hand out?\"\n\nFrazer sighed. \"It's true, all right. There was a scientist named\nRobertson, and he did come up with the thermo-nuc formula, way back in\n'75. Proved it, too. Use what he developed and the chain-reaction\nwould never end. Scientists in other countries tested the theory and\nagreed; there was no collusion, it just worked out that way on a\npractical basis. Hasn't been a war since--what more proof do you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Well, couldn't they just use some of the old-fashioned hydrogen\nbombs?\"\n\n\"Be sensible, man! Once a war started, no nation could resist the\ntemptation to go all-out. Fortunately, everyone realizes that. So we\nhave peace. Permanent peace.\"\n\n\"I'll take a good war anytime, in preference to this.\"\n\n\"Harry, you don't know what you're talking about. You aren't so young\nthat you can't remember what it was like in the old days. Everybody\nliving in fear, waiting for the bombs to fall. People dying of disease\nand worried about dying from radiation and fallout. All the\ninternational rivalries, the power-politics, the eternal pressures and\nconstant crises. Nobody in his right mind would want to go back to\n_that_. We've come a mighty long way in the last twenty years or so.\"\n\nHarry switched to autopilot and sat back. \"Maybe that's the trouble,\"\nhe said. \"Maybe we've come too far, too fast. I wasn't kidding about\ndropping those thermo-nucs, either. _Something_ has to be done. We\ncan't go on like this indefinitely. Why doesn't the Board come up with\nan answer?\"\n\nFrazer shrugged his heavy shoulders. \"You think we haven't tried,\naren't trying now? We're aware of the situation as well as you\nare--and then some. But there's no easy solution. The population just\nkeeps growing, that's all. No war to cut it down, contagious diseases\nat a minimum, average life-expectancy up to ninety years or better.\nNaturally, this results in a problem. But a bomb won't help bring\nabout any permanent solution. Besides, this isn't a local matter, or\neven a national one. It's global. What do you think those summit\nmeetings are all about?\"\n\n\"What about birth control?\" Harry asked. \"Why don't they really get\nbehind an emigration movement?\"\n\n\"We can't limit procreation by law. You know that.\" Frazer peered out\nat the swarming streams on the sidewalk levels. \"It's more than a\nreligious or a political question--it's a social one. People want\nkids. They can afford them. Besides, the Housing Act is set up so that\nhaving kids is just about the only way you can ever get into larger\nliving-quarters.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they try reverse-psychology? I mean, grant priority to\npeople who are willing to be sterilized?\"\n\n\"They tried it, on a limited experimental scale, about three years ago\nout on the West Coast.\"\n\n\"I never heard anything about it.\"\n\n\"Damned right you didn't,\" Frazer replied, grimly. \"They kept the\nwhole project under wraps, and for a good reason. The publicity might\nhave wrecked the Administration.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"What do you suppose happened? There were riots. Do you think a man\nand his wife and three kids, living in three rooms, liked the idea of\nstanding by and watching a sterilized couple enjoy a four-room place\nwith lawn space? Things got pretty ugly, let me tell you. There was a\nrumor going around that the country was in the hands of\nhomosexuals--the churches were up in arms--and if that wasn't bad\nenough, we had to face up to the primary problem. There just wasn't,\njust isn't, enough _space_. Not in areas suitable for maintaining a\npopulation. Mountains are still mountains and deserts are still\ndeserts. Maybe we can put up housing in such regions, but who can live\nthere? Even with decentralization going full blast, people must live\nwithin reasonable access to their work. No, we're just running out of\nroom.\"\n\nAgain the car halted on signal. Over the blasting of the horns, Harry\nrepeated his query about emigration.\n\nFrazer shook his head, but made no attempt to reply until the horns\nhad quieted and they were under way once more.\n\n\"As for emigration, we're just getting some of our own medicine in\nreturn. About eighty years ago, we clamped down and closed the door on\nimmigrants; established a quota. Now the same quota is being used\nagainst us, and you can't really blame other nations for it. They're\nfacing worse population increases than we are. Look at the African\nFederation, and what's happened there, in spite of all the\nwealth! And South America is even worse, in spite of all the\nreclamation projects. Fifteen years ago, when they cleared out the\nAmazon Basin, they thought they'd have enough room for fifty years to\ncome. And now look at it--two hundred million, that's the latest\nfigure we've got.\"\n\n\"So what's the answer?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"I don't know. If it wasn't for hydroponics and the Ag Culture\ncontrols, we'd be licked right now. As it is, we can still supply\nenough food, and the old supply-and-demand takes care of the economy\nas a whole. I have no recommendations for an overall solution, or even\na regional one. My job, the Board's job, is regulating housing and\ntraffic and transportation in Chicagee. That's about all you can\nexpect us to handle.\"\n\nAgain they jolted to a stop and the horns howled all around them.\nHarry sat there until a muscle in the side of his jaw began to twitch.\nSuddenly he pounded on the horn with both fists.\n\n\"Shut up!\" he yelled. \"For the love of Heaven, shut up!\"\n\nAbruptly he slumped back. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"It's my damned\nheadache. I--I've got to get out of this.\"\n\n\"Job getting you down?\"\n\n\"No. It's a good job. At least everybody tells me so. Twenty-five\nhours a week, three hundred bucks. The car. The room. The telescreen\nand liquor and yellowjackets. Plenty of time to kill. Unless it's the\ntime that's killing me.\"\n\n\"But--what do you _want_?\"\n\nHarry stepped on the accelerator and they inched along. Now the street\nwidened into eight traffic lanes and the big semis joined the\nprocession on the edge of the downtown area.\n\n\"I want out,\" Harry said. \"Out of this.\"\n\n\"Don't you ever visit the National Preserves?\" Frazer asked.\n\n\"Sure I do. Fly up every vacation. Take a tame plane to a tame\ngovernment resort and catch my quota of two tame fish. Great sport! If\nI got married, I'd be entitled to four tame fish. But that's not what\nI want. I want what my father used to talk about. I want to drive into\nthe country, without a permit, mind you; just to drive wherever I\nlike. I want to see cows and chickens and trees and lakes and sky.\"\n\n\"You sound like a Naturalist.\"\n\n\"Don't sneer. Maybe the Naturalists are right. Maybe we ought to cut\nout all this phoney progress and phoney peace that passeth all\nunderstanding. I'm no liberal, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I\nthink the Naturalists have the only answer.\"\n\n\"But what can you do about it?\" Frazer murmured. \"Suppose for the\nsake of argument that they _are_ right. How can you change things? We\ncan't just _will_ ourselves to stop growing, and we can't legislate\nagainst biology. More people, in better health, with more free time,\nare just bound to have more offspring. It's inevitable, under the\ncircumstances. And neither you nor I nor anyone has the right to\ncondemn millions upon millions of others to death through war or\ndisease.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Harry said. \"It's hopeless, I guess. All the same, I want\nout.\" He wet his lips. \"Frazer, you're on the Board here. You've got\nconnections higher up. If I could only get a chance to transfer to Ag\nCulture, go on one of those farms as a worker--\"\n\nFrazer shook his head. \"Sorry, Harry. You know the situation there,\nI'm sure. Right now there's roughly ninety million approved\napplications on file. Everybody wants to get into Ag Culture.\"\n\n\"But couldn't I just buy some land, get a government contract for\nfoodstuffs?\"\n\n\"Have you got the bucks? A minimum forty acres leased from one of the\nfarm corporations will cost you two hundred thousand at the very\nleast, not counting equipment.\" He paused. \"Besides, there's\nVocational Apt. What did your tests show?\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Harry said. \"I'm supposed to be an agency man. An\nagency man until I die. Or retire on my pension, at fifty, and sit in\nmy little room for the next fifty years, turning on the telescreen\nevery morning to hear some loudmouthed liar tell me it's a beautiful\nday in Chicagee. Who knows, maybe by that time we'll have a hundred\nbillion people enjoying peace and progress and prosperity. All sitting\nin little rooms and--\"\n\n\"Watch out!\" Frazer grabbed the wheel. \"You nearly hit that truck.\" He\nwaited until Harry's face relaxed before relinquishing his grip.\n\"Harry, you'd better go in for a checkup. It isn't just a headache\nwith you, is it?\"\n\n\"You're not fooling,\" Harry told him. \"It isn't just a headache.\"\n\nHe began to think about what it _really_ was, and that helped a\nlittle. It helped him get through the worst part, which was the\ndowntown traffic and letting Frazer off and listening to Frazer urge\nhim to see a doctor.\n\nThen he got to the building parking area and let them take his car\naway and bury it down in the droning darkness where the horns hooted\nand the headlights glared.\n\nHarry climbed the ramp and mingled with the ten-thirty shift on its\nway up to the elevators. Eighteen elevators in his building, to serve\neighty floors. Nine of the elevators were express to the fiftieth\nfloor, three were express to sixty-five. He wanted one of the latter,\nand so did the mob. The crushing, clinging mob. They pressed and\npanted the way mobs always do; mobs that lynch and torture and dance\naround bonfires and guillotines and try to drag you down to trample\nyou to death because they can't stand you if your name is Harry and\nyou want to be different.\n\nThey hate you because you don't like powdered eggs and the telescreen\nand a beautiful day in Chicagee. And they stare at you because your\nforehead hurts and the muscle in your jaw twitches and they know you\nwant to scream as you go up, up, up, and try to think why you get a\nheadache from jerking your head to the left.\n\nThen Harry was at the office door and they said good morning when he\ncame in, all eighty of the typists in the outer office working their\nelectronic machines and offering him their electronic smiles,\nincluding the girl he had made electronic love to last Saturday night\nand who wanted him to move into a two-room marriage and have children,\nlots of children who could enjoy peace and progress and prosperity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry snapped out of it, going down the corridor. Only a few steps\nmore and he'd be safe in his office, his own private office, almost as\nbig as his apartment. And there would be liquor, and the yellowjackets\nin the drawer. That would help. Then he could get to work.\n\nWhat was today's assignment? He tried to remember. It was\nWilmer-Klibby, wasn't it? Telescreenads for Wilmer-Klibby, makers of\nwindow-glass.\n\n_Window-glass._\n\nHe opened his office door and then slammed it shut behind him. For a\nminute everything blurred, and then he could remember.\n\nNow he knew what caused him to jerk his head, what gave him the\nheadaches when he did so. Of course. That was it.\n\nWhen he sat down at the table for breakfast in the morning he turned\nhis head to the left because he'd always done so, ever since he was a\nlittle boy. A little boy, in what was then Wheaton, sitting at the\nbreakfast table and looking out of the window. Looking out at summer\nsunshine, spring rain, autumn haze, the white wonder of newfallen\nsnow.\n\nHe'd never broken himself of the habit. He still looked to the left\nevery morning, just as he had today. But there was no window any more.\nThere was only a blank wall. And beyond it, the smog and the clamor\nand the crowds.\n\n_Window-glass._ Wilmer-Klibby had problems. Nobody was buying\nwindow-glass any more. Nobody except the people who put up buildings\nlike this. There were still windows on the top floors, just like the\nwindow here in his office.\n\nHarry stepped over to it, moving very slowly because of his head. It\nhurt to keep his eyes open, but he wanted to stare out of the window.\nUp this high you could see above the smog. You could see the sun like\na radiant jewel packed in the cotton cumulus of clouds. If you opened\nthe window you could feel fresh air against your forehead, you could\nbreathe it in and breathe out the headache.\n\nBut you didn't dare look down. Oh, no, never look _down_, because then\nyou'd see the buildings all around you. The buildings below, black and\nsooty, their jagged outlines like the stumps of rotten teeth. And they\nstretched off in all directions, as far as the eye could attain; row\nafter row of rotten teeth grinning up from the smog-choked throat of\nthe streets. From the maw of the city far below came this faint but\nendless howling, this screaming of traffic and toil. And you couldn't\nhelp it, you breathed _that_ in too, along with the fresh air, and it\npoisoned you and it did more than make your head ache. It made your\nheart ache and it made your soul sick, and it made you close your eyes\nand your lungs and your brain against it.\n\nHarry reeled, but he knew this was the only way. _Close your brain\nagainst it._ And then, when you opened your eyes again, maybe you\ncould see the way things used to be--\n\nIt was snowing out and it was a _wet_ snow, the very best kind for\nsnowballs and making a snowman, and the whole gang would come out\nafter school.\n\nBut there was no school, this was Saturday, and the leaves were russet\nand gold and red so that it looked as if all the trees in the world\nwere on fire. And you could scuff when you walked and pile up fallen\nleaves from the grass and roll in them.\n\nAnd it was swell to roll down the front lawn in summer, just roll\nright down to the edge of the sidewalk like it was a big hill and let\nDaddy catch you at the bottom, laughing.\n\nMamma laughed too, and she said, _Look, it's springtime, the lilacs\nare out, do you want to touch the pretty lilacs, Harry?_\n\nAnd Harry didn't quite understand what she was saying, but he reached\nout and they were purple and smelled of rain and soft sweetness and\nthey were just beyond the window, if he reached a little further he\ncould touch them--\n\nAnd then the snow and the leaves and the grass and the lilacs\ndisappeared, and Harry could see the rotten teeth again, leering and\nlooming and snapping at him. They were going to bite, they were going\nto chew, they were going to devour, and he couldn't stop them,\ncouldn't stop himself. He was falling into the howling jaws of the\ncity.\n\nHis last conscious effort was a desperate attempt to gulp fresh air\ninto his lungs before he pinwheeled down. Fresh air was good for\nheadaches....\n\n\n\n\n2. Harry Collins--1998\n\n\nIt took them ten seconds to save Harry from falling, but it took him\nover ten weeks to regain his balance.\n\nIn fact, well over two months had passed before he could fully realize\njust what had happened, or where he was now. They must have noticed\nsomething was wrong with him that morning at the office, because two\nsupervisors and an exec rushed in and caught him just as he was going\nout of the window. And then they had sent him away, sent him _here_.\n\n\"This is fine,\" he told Dr. Manschoff. \"If I'd known how well they\ntreated you, I'd have gone couch-happy years ago.\"\n\nDr. Manschoff's plump face was impassive, but the little laugh-lines\ndeepened around the edges of his eyes. \"Maybe that's why we take such\ncare not to publicize our recent advances in mental therapy,\" he said.\n\"Everybody would want to get into a treatment center, and then where\nwould we be?\"\n\nHarry nodded, staring past the doctor's shoulder, staring out of the\nwide window at the broad expanse of rolling countryside beyond.\n\n\"I still don't understand, though,\" he murmured. \"How can you possibly\nmanage to maintain an institution like this, with all the space and\nthe luxuries? The inmates seem to lead a better life than the adjusted\nindividuals outside. It's topsy-turvy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Dr. Manschoff's fingers formed a pudgy steeple. \"But then,\nso many things seem to be topsy-turvy nowadays, don't they? Wasn't it\nthe realization of this fact which precipitated your own recent\ndifficulties?\"\n\n\"Almost precipitated me bodily out of that window,\" Harry admitted,\ncheerfully. \"And that's another thing. I was sent here, I suppose,\nbecause I'd attempted suicide, gone into shock, temporary amnesia,\nsomething like that.\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" the doctor echoed, contemplating his steeple.\n\n\"But you didn't give me any treatment,\" Harry continued. \"Oh, I was\nkept under sedation for a while, I realize that. And you and some of\nthe other staff-members talked to me. But mainly I just rested in a\nnice big room and ate nice big meals.\"\n\n\"So?\" The steeple's fleshy spire collapsed.\n\n\"So what I want to know is, when does the real treatment start? When\ndo I go into analysis, or chemotherapy, and all that?\"\n\nDr. Manschoff shrugged. \"Do you think you need those things now?\"\n\nHarry gazed out at the sunlight beyond the window, half-squinting and\nhalf-frowning. \"No, come to think of it, I don't believe I do. I feel\nbetter now than I have in years.\"\n\nHis companion leaned back. \"Meaning that for years you felt all wrong.\nBecause you were constricted, physically, psychically, and\nemotionally. You were cramped, squeezed in a vise until the pressure\nbecame intolerable. But now that pressure has been removed. As a\nresult you no longer suffer, and there is no need to seek escape in\ndeath or denial of identity.\n\n\"This radical change of attitude has been brought about here in just a\nlittle more than two months' time. And yet you're asking me when the\n'real treatment' begins.\"\n\n\"I guess I've already had the real treatment then, haven't I?\"\n\n\"That is correct. Prolonged analysis or drastic therapy is\nunnecessary. We've merely given you what you seemed to need.\"\n\n\"I'm very grateful,\" Harry said. \"But how can you afford to do it?\"\n\nDr. Manschoff built another temple to an unknown god. He inspected the\narchitecture critically now as he spoke. \"Because your problem is a\nrarity,\" he said.\n\n\"Rarity? I'd have thought millions of people would be breaking down\nevery month. The Naturalists say--\"\n\nThe doctor nodded wearily. \"I know what they say. But let's dismiss\nrumors and consider facts. Have you ever read any _official_ report\nstating that the number of cases of mental illness ran into the\nmillions?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't.\"\n\n\"For that matter, do you happen to know of _anyone_ who was ever sent\nto a treatment center such as this?\"\n\n\"Well, of course, everybody goes in to see the medics for regular\ncheck-ups and this includes an interview with a psych. But if they're\nin bad shape he just puts them on extra tranquilizers. I guess\nsometimes he reviews their Vocational Apt tests and shifts them over\ninto different jobs in other areas.\"\n\nDr. Manschoff bowed his head in reverence above the steeple, as if\nsatisfied with the labors he had wrought. \"That is roughly correct.\nAnd I believe, if you search your memory, you won't recall even a\nmention of a treatment center. This sort of place is virtually\nextinct, nowadays. There are still some institutions for those\nsuffering from functional mental disorders--paresis, senile dementia,\ncongenital abnormalities. But regular check-ups and preventative\ntherapy take care of the great majority. We've ceased concentrating on\nthe result of mental illnesses and learned to attack the causes.\n\n\"It's the old yellow fever problem all over again, you see. Once upon\na time, physicians dealt exclusively with treatment of yellow fever\npatients. Then they shifted their attention to the _source_ of the\ndisease. They went after the mosquitoes, drained the swamps, and the\nyellow fever problem vanished.\n\n\"That's been our approach in recent years. We've developed _social_\ntherapy, and so the need for individual therapy has diminished.\n\n\"What were the sources of the tensions producing mental disturbances?\nPhysical and financial insecurity, the threat of war, the aggressive\npatterns of a competitive society, the unresolved Oedipus-situation\nrooted in the old-style family relationship. These were the swamps\nwhere the mosquitoes buzzed and bit. Most of the swamps have been\ndredged, most of the insects exterminated.\n\n\"Today we're moving into a social situation where nobody goes hungry,\nnobody is jobless or unprovided for, nobody needs to struggle for\nstatus. Vocational Apt determines a man's rightful place and function\nin society, and there's no longer the artificial distinction imposed\nby race, color or creed. War is a thing of the past. Best of all, the\nold-fashioned 'home-life,' with all of its unhealthy emotional ties,\nis being replaced by sensible conditioning when a child reaches school\nage. The umbilical cord is no longer a permanent leash, a strangler's\nnoose, or a silver-plated life-line stretching back to the womb.\"\n\nHarry Collins nodded. \"I suppose only the exceptional cases ever need\nto go to a treatment center like this.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"But what makes _me_ one of the exceptions? Is it because of the way\nthe folks brought me up, in a small town, with all the old-fashioned\nbooks and everything? Is that why I hated confinement and conformity\nso much? Is it because of all the years I spent reading? And why--\"\n\nDr. Manschoff stood up. \"You tempt me,\" he said. \"You tempt me\nstrongly. As you can see, I dearly love a lecture--and a captive\naudience. But right now, the audience must not remain captive. I\nprescribe an immediate dose of freedom.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You mean I'm to leave here?\"\n\n\"Is that what you want to do?\"\n\n\"Frankly, no. Not if it means going back to my job.\"\n\n\"That hasn't been decided upon. We can discuss the problem later, and\nperhaps we can go into the answers to those questions you just posed.\nBut at the moment, I'd suggest you stay with us, though without the\nrestraint of remaining in your room or in the wards. In other words, I\nwant you to start going outside again.\"\n\n\"Outside?\"\n\n\"You'll find several square miles of open country just beyond the\ndoors here. You're at liberty to wander around and enjoy yourself.\nPlenty of fresh air and sunshine--come and go as you wish. I've\nalready issued instructions which permit you to keep your own hours.\nMeals will be available when you desire them.\"\n\n\"You're very kind.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I'm prescribing what you need. And when the time comes,\nwe'll arrange to talk again. You know where to find me.\"\n\nDr. Manschoff dismantled his steeple and placed a half of the roof in\neach trouser-pocket.\n\nAnd Harry Collins went outdoors.\n\nIt was wonderful just to be free and alone--like returning to that\nfaraway childhood in Wheaton once again. Harry appreciated every\nminute of it during the first week of his wandering.\n\nBut Harry wasn't a child any more, and after a week he began to wonder\ninstead of wander.\n\nThe grounds around the treatment center were more than spacious; they\nseemed absolutely endless. No matter how far he walked during the\ncourse of a day, Harry had never encountered any walls, fences or\nartificial barriers; there was nothing to stay his progress but the\nnatural barriers of high, steeply-slanting precipices which seemed to\nrim all sides of a vast valley. Apparently the center itself was set\nin the middle of a large canyon--a canyon big enough to contain an\nairstrip for helicopter landings. The single paved road leading from\nthe main buildings terminated at the airstrip, and Harry saw\nhelicopters arrive and depart from time to time; apparently they\nbrought in food and supplies.\n\nAs for the center itself, it consisted of four large structures, two\nof which Harry was familiar with. The largest was made up of\napartments for individual patients, and staffed by nurses and\nattendants. Harry's own room was here, on the second floor, and from\nthe beginning he'd been allowed to roam around the communal halls\nbelow at will.\n\nThe second building was obviously administrative--Dr. Manschoff's\nprivate office was situated therein, and presumably the other\nstaff-members operated out of here.\n\nThe other two buildings were apparently inaccessible; not guarded or\npoliced or even distinguished by signs prohibiting access, but merely\nlocked and unused. At least, Harry had found the doors locked\nwhen--out of normal curiosity--he had ventured to approach them. Nor\nhad he ever seen anyone enter or leave the premises. Perhaps these\nstructures were unnecessary under the present circumstances, and had\nbeen built for future accommodations.\n\nStill, Harry couldn't help wondering.\n\nAnd now, on this particular afternoon, he sat on the bank of the\nlittle river which ran through the valley, feeling the mid-summer sun\nbeating down upon his forehead and staring down at the eddying current\nwith its ripples and reflections.\n\n_Ripples and reflections...._\n\nDr. Manschoff had answered his questions well, yet new questions had\narisen.\n\nMost people didn't go crazy any more, the doctor had explained, and so\nthere were very few treatment centers such as this.\n\n_Question: Why were there any at all?_\n\nA place like this cost a fortune to staff and maintain. In an age\nwhere living-space and areable acreage was at such a premium, why\nwaste this vast and fertile expanse? And in a society more and more\nopenly committed to the policy of promoting the greatest good for the\ngreatest number, why bother about the fate of an admittedly\ninsignificant group of mentally disturbed patients?\n\nNot that Harry resented his situation; in fact, it was almost too good\nto be true.\n\n_Question: Was it too good to be true?_\n\nWhy, come to realize it, he'd seen less than a dozen other patients\nduring his entire stay here! All of them were male, and all of\nthem--apparently--were recovering from a condition somewhat similar to\nhis own. At least, he'd recognized the same reticence and diffidence\nwhen it came to exchanging more than a perfunctory greeting in an\nencounter in an outer corridor. At the time, he'd accepted their\nunwillingness to communicate; welcomed and understood it because of\n_his_ condition. And that in itself wasn't what he questioned now.\n\nBut why were there so _few_ patients beside himself? Why were they all\nmales? And why weren't _they_ roaming the countryside now the way he\nwas?\n\nSo many staff-members and so few patients. So much room and luxury and\nfreedom, and so little use of it. So little apparent purpose to it\nall.\n\n_Question: Was there a hidden purpose?_\n\nHarry stared down into the ripples and reflections, and the sun was\nsuddenly intolerably hot, its glare on the water suddenly blinding and\nbewildering. He saw his face mirrored on the water's surface, and it\nwas not the familiar countenance he knew--the features were bloated,\ndistorted, shimmering and wavering.\n\nMaybe it was starting all over again. Maybe he was getting another one\nof those headaches. Maybe he was going to lose control again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYes, and maybe he was just imagining things. Sitting here in all this\nheat wasn't a good idea.\n\nWhy not take a swim?\n\nThat seemed reasonable enough. In fact, it seemed like a delightful\ndistraction. Harry rose and stripped. He entered the water\nawkwardly--one didn't dive, not after twenty years of abstinence from\nthe outdoor life--but he found that he could swim, after a fashion.\nThe water was cooling, soothing. A few minutes of immersion and Harry\nfound himself forgetting his speculations. The uneasy feeling had\nvanished. Now, when he stared down into the water, he saw his own face\nreflected, looking just the way it should. And when he stared up--\n\nHe saw her standing there, on the bank.\n\nShe was tall, slim, and blonde. Very tall, very slim, and very blonde.\n\nShe was also very desirable.\n\nUp until a moment ago, Harry had considered swimming a delightful\ndistraction. But now--\n\n\"How's the water?\" she called.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nShe nodded, smiling down at him.\n\n\"Aren't you coming in?\" he asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I was looking for you, Harry.\"\n\n\"You know my name?\"\n\nShe nodded again. \"Dr. Manschoff told me.\"\n\n\"You mean, he sent you here to find me?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand. If you're not going swimming, then why--I\nmean--\"\n\nHer smile broadened. \"It's just part of the therapy, Harry.\"\n\n\"Part of the therapy?\"\n\n\"That's right. _Part._\" She giggled. \"Don't you think you'd like to\ncome out of the water now and see what the rest of it might be?\"\n\nHarry thought so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith mounting enthusiasm, he eagerly embraced his treatment and\nentered into a state of active cooperation.\n\nIt was some time before he ventured to comment on the situation.\n\"Manschoff is a damned good diagnostician,\" he murmured. Then he sat\nup. \"Are you a patient here?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Don't ask questions, Harry. Can't you be\nsatisfied with things as they are?\"\n\n\"You're just what the doctor ordered, all right.\" He gazed down at\nher. \"But don't you even have a name?\"\n\n\"You can call me Sue.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHe bent to kiss her but she avoided him and rose to her feet. \"Got to\ngo now.\"\n\n\"So soon?\"\n\nShe nodded and moved towards the bushes above the bank.\n\n\"But when will I see you again?\"\n\n\"Coming swimming tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Maybe I can get away for more occupational therapy then.\"\n\nShe stooped behind the bushes, and Harry saw a flash of white.\n\n\"You _are_ a nurse, aren't you,\" he muttered. \"On the staff, I\nsuppose. I should have known.\"\n\n\"All right, so I am. What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"And I suppose you were telling the truth when you said Manschoff sent\nyou here. This _is_ just part of my therapy, isn't it?\"\n\nShe nodded briefly as she slipped into her uniform. \"Does that bother\nyou, Harry?\"\n\nHe bit his lip. When he spoke, his voice was low. \"Yes, damn it, it\ndoes. I mean, I got the idea--at least, I was hoping--that this wasn't\njust a matter of carrying out an assignment on your part.\"\n\nShe looked up at him gravely. \"Who said anything about an assignment,\ndarling?\" she murmured. \"I volunteered.\"\n\nAnd then she was gone.\n\nThen she was gone, and then she came back that night in Harry's\ndreams, and then she was at the river the next day and it was better\nthan the dreams, better than the day before.\n\nSue told him she had been watching him for weeks now. And she had gone\nto Manschoff and suggested it, and she was very glad. And they had to\nmeet here, out in the open, so as not to complicate the situation or\ndisturb any of the other patients.\n\nSo Harry naturally asked her about the other patients, and the whole\ngeneral setup, and she said Dr. Manschoff would answer all those\nquestions in due time. But right now, with only an hour or so to\nspare, was he going to spend it all asking for information? Matters\nwere accordingly adjusted to their mutual satisfaction, and it was on\nthat basis that they continued their almost daily meetings for some\ntime.\n\nThe next few months were perhaps the happiest Harry had ever known.\nThe whole interval took on a dreamlike quality--idealized,\nromanticized, yet basically sensual. There is probably such a dream\nburied deep within the psyche of every man, Harry reflected, but to\nfew is it ever given to realize its reality. His early questioning\nattitude gave way to a mood of mere acceptance and enjoyment. This was\nthe primitive drama, the very essence of the male-female relationship;\nAdam and Eve in the Garden. Why waste time seeking the Tree of\nKnowledge?\n\nAnd it wasn't until summer passed that Harry even thought about the\nSerpent.\n\nOne afternoon, as he sat waiting for Sue on the river bank, he heard a\nsudden movement in the brush behind him.\n\n\"Darling?\" he called, eagerly.\n\n\"Please, you don't know me _that_ well.\" The deep masculine voice\ncarried overtones of amusement.\n\nFlushing, Harry turned to confront the intruder. He was a short,\nstocky, middle-aged man whose bristling gray crewcut almost matched\nthe neutral shades of his gray orderly's uniform.\n\n\"Expecting someone else, were you?\" the man muttered. \"Well, I'll get\nout of your way.\"\n\n\"That's not necessary. I was really just daydreaming, I guess. I don't\nknow what made me think--\" Harry felt his flush deepen, and he lowered\nhis eyes and his voice as he tried to improvise some excuse.\n\n\"You're a lousy liar,\" the man said, stepping forward and seating\nhimself on the bank next to Harry. \"But it doesn't really matter. I\ndon't think your girl friend is going to show up today, anyway.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? What do you know about--\"\n\n\"I mean just what I said,\" the man told him. \"And I know everything I\nneed to know, about you and about her and about the situation in\ngeneral. That's why I'm here, Collins.\"\n\nHe paused, watching the play of emotions in Harry's eyes.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking right now,\" the gray-haired man\ncontinued. \"At first you wondered how I knew your name. Then you\nrealized that if I was on the staff in the wards I'd naturally be able\nto identify the patients. Now it occurs to you that you've never seen\nme in the wards, so you're speculating as to whether or not I'm\nworking out of the administration offices with that psychiatric no\ngood Manschoff. But if I were, I wouldn't be calling him names, would\nI? Which means you're really getting confused, aren't you, Collins?\nGood!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man chuckled, but there was neither mockery, malice, nor genuine\nmirth in the sound. And his eyes were sober, intent.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Harry asked. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"The name is Ritchie, Arnold Ritchie. At least, that's the name they\nknow me by around here, and you can call me that. As to what I'm\ndoing, it's a long story. Let's just say that right now I'm here to\ngive you a little advanced therapy.\"\n\n\"Then Manschoff did send you?\"\n\nThe chuckle came again, and Ritchie shook his head. \"He did not. And\nif he even suspected I was here, there'd be hell to pay.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want with me?\"\n\n\"It isn't a question of what I want. It's a question of what _you\nneed_. Which is, like I said, advanced therapy. The sort that dear old\nkindly permissive Father-Image Manschoff doesn't intend you to get.\"\n\nHarry stood up. \"What's this all about?\"\n\nRitchie rose with him, smiling for the first time. \"I'm glad you asked\nthat question, Collins. It's about time you did, you know. Everything\nhas been so carefully planned to keep you from asking it. But you\n_were_ beginning to wonder just a bit anyway, weren't you?\"\n\n\"I don't see what you're driving at.\"\n\n\"You don't see what anyone is driving at, Collins. You've been blinded\nby a spectacular display of kindness, misdirected by self-indulgence.\nI told you I knew everything I needed to know about you, and I do. Now\nI'm going to ask you to remember these things for yourself; the things\nyou've avoided considering all this while.\n\n\"I'm going to ask you to remember that you're twenty-eight years old,\nand that for almost seven years you were an agency man and a good one.\nYou worked hard, you did a conscientious job, you stayed in line,\nobeyed the rules, never rebelled. Am I correct in my summary of the\nsituation?\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess so.\"\n\n\"So what was your reward for all this unceasing effort and eternal\nconformity? A one-room apartment and a one-week vacation, once a year.\nCount your blessings, Collins. Am I right?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Then what happened? Finally you flipped, didn't you? Tried to take a\nheader out of the window. You chucked your job, chucked your\nresponsibilities, chucked your future and attempted to chuck yourself\naway. Am I still right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good enough. And now we come to the interesting part of the story.\nSeven years of being a good little boy got you nothing but the promise\nof present and future frustration. Seven seconds of madness, of\nattempted self-destruction, brought you here. And as a reward for\nbucking the system, the system itself has provided you with a life of\nluxury and leisure--full permission to come and go as you please, live\nin spacious ease, indulge in the gratification of every appetite, free\nof responsibility or restraint. Is that true?\"\n\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"All right. Now, let me ask you the question you asked me. What's it\nall about?\"\n\nRitchie put his hand on Harry's shoulder. \"Tell me that, Collins. Why\ndo you suppose you've received such treatment? As long as you stayed\nin line, nobody gave a damn for your comfort or welfare. Then, when\nyou committed the cardinal sin of our present-day society--when you\nrebelled--everything was handed to you on a silver platter. Does that\nmake sense?\"\n\n\"But it's therapy. Dr. Manschoff said--\"\n\n\"Look, Collins. Millions of people flip every year. Millions more\nattempt suicide. How many of them end up in a place like this?\"\n\n\"They don't, though. That's just Naturalist propaganda. Dr. Manschoff\nsaid--\"\n\n\"_Dr. Manschoff said!_ I know what he said, all right. And you\nbelieved him, because you wanted to believe him. You wanted the\nreassurance he could offer you--the feeling of being unique and\nimportant. So you didn't ask him any questions, you didn't ask any\nquestions of yourself. Such as why anybody would consider an\ninsignificant little agency man, without friends, family or\nconnections, worth the trouble of rehabilitating at all, let alone\namidst such elaborate and expensive surroundings. Why, men like you\nare a dime a dozen these days--Vocational Apt can push a few buttons\nand come up with half a million replacements to take over your job.\nYou aren't important to society, Collins. You aren't important to\nanyone at all, besides yourself. And yet you got the red-carpet\ntreatment. It's about time somebody yanked that carpet out from under\nyou. What's it all about?\"\n\nHarry blinked. \"Look here, I don't see why this is any of your\nbusiness. Besides, to tell the truth, I'm expecting--\"\n\n\"I know who you're expecting, but I've already told you she won't be\nhere. Because she's expecting.\"\n\n\"What--?\"\n\n\"It's high time you learned the facts of life, Collins. Yes, the\nwell-known facts of life--the ones about the birds and the bees, and\nbarefoot boys and blondes, too. Your little friend Sue is going to\nhave a souvenir.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it! I'm going to ask Dr. Manschoff.\"\n\n\"Sure you are. You'll ask Manschoff and he'll deny it. And so you'll\ntell him about me. You'll say you met somebody in the woods\ntoday--either a lunatic or a Naturalist spy who infiltrated here under\nfalse pretenses. And Manschoff will reassure you. He'll reassure you\njust long enough to get his hands on me. Then he'll take care of both\nof us.\"\n\n\"Are you insinuating--\"\n\n\"Hell, no! I'm _telling_ you!\" Ritchie put his hand down suddenly, and\nhis voice calmed. \"Ever wonder about those other two big buildings on\nthe premises here, Collins? Well, I can tell you about one of them,\nbecause that's where I work. You might call it an experimental\nlaboratory if you like. Sometime later on I'll describe it to you. But\nright now it's the other building that's important; the building with\nthe big chimney. That's a kind of an incinerator, Collins--a place\nwhere the mistakes go up in smoke, at night, when there's nobody to\nsee. A place where you and I will go up in smoke, if you're fool\nenough to tell Manschoff about this.\"\n\n\"You're lying.\"\n\n\"I wish to God I was, for both our sakes! But I can prove what I'm\nsaying. _You_ can prove it, for yourself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Pretend this meeting never occurred. Pretend that you just spent the\nafternoon here, waiting for a girl who never showed up. Then do\nexactly what you would do under those circumstances. Go in to see Dr.\nManschoff and ask him where Sue is, tell him you were worried because\nshe'd promised to meet you and then didn't appear.\n\n\"I can tell you right now what he'll tell you. He'll say that Sue has\nbeen transferred to another treatment center, that she knew about it\nfor several weeks but didn't want to upset you with the news of her\ndeparture. So she decided to just slip away. And Manschoff will tell\nyou not to be unhappy. It just so happens that he knows of another\nnurse who has had her eye on you--a very pretty little brunette named\nMyrna. In fact, if you go down to the river tomorrow, you'll find her\nwaiting for you there.\"\n\n\"What if I refuse?\"\n\nRitchie shrugged. \"Why should you refuse? It's all fun and games,\nisn't it? Up to now you haven't asked any questions about what was\ngoing on, and it would look very strange if you started at this late\ndate. I strongly advise you to cooperate. If not, everything is likely\nto--quite literally--go up in smoke.\"\n\nHarry Collins frowned. \"All right, suppose I do what you say, and\nManschoff gives me the answers you predict. This still doesn't prove\nthat he'd be lying or that you're telling me the truth.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't it indicate as much, though?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But on the other hand, it could merely mean that you know\nSue _has_ been transferred, and that Dr. Manschoff intends to turn me\nover to a substitute. It doesn't necessarily imply anything sinister.\"\n\n\"In other words, you're insisting on a clincher, is that it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Ritchie sighed heavily. \"You asked for it.\" He reached\ninto the left-hand upper pocket of the gray uniform and brought out a\nsmall, stiff square of glossy paper.\n\n\"What's that?\" Harry asked. He reached for the paper, but Ritchie drew\nhis hand back.\n\n\"Look at it over my shoulder,\" he said. \"I don't want any\nfingerprints. Hell of a risky business just smuggling it out of the\nfiles--no telling how well they check up on this material.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry circled behind the smaller man. He squinted down. \"Hard to\nread.\"\n\n\"Sure. It's a photostat. I made it myself, this morning; that's my\ndepartment. Read carefully now. You'll see it's a transcript of the\nlab report. Susan Pulver, that's her name, isn't it? After due\nexamination and upon completion of preliminary tests, hereby found to\nbe in the second month of pregnancy. Putative father, Harry\nCollins--that's you, see your name? And here's the rest of the\nrecord.\"\n\n\"Yes, let me see it. What's all this about inoculation series? And who\nis this Dr. Leffingwell?\" Harry bent closer, but Ritchie closed his\nhand around the photostat and pocketed it again.\n\n\"Never mind that, now. I'll tell you later. The important thing is, do\nyou believe me?\"\n\n\"I believe Sue is pregnant, yes.\"\n\n\"That's enough. Enough for you to do what I've asked you to. Go to\nManschoff and make inquiries. See what he tells you. Don't make a\nscene, and for God's sake don't mention my name. Just confirm my story\nfor yourself. Then I'll give you further details.\"\n\n\"But when will I see you?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon, if you like. Right here.\"\n\n\"You said he'd be sending another girl--\"\n\nRitchie nodded. \"So I did. And so he'll say. I suggest you beg to be\nexcused for the moment. Tell him it will take a while for you to get\nover the shock of losing Sue this way.\"\n\n\"I won't be lying,\" Harry murmured.\n\n\"I know. And I'm sorry. Believe me, I am.\" Ritchie sighed again. \"But\nyou'll just have to trust me from now on.\"\n\n\"Trust you? When you haven't even explained what this is all about?\"\n\n\"You've had your shock-therapy for today. Come back for another\ntreatment tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd then Ritchie was gone, the gray uniform melting away into the gray\nshadows of the shrubbery above the bank.\n\nA short time later, Harry made his own way back to the center in the\ngathering twilight. The dusk was gray, too. Everything seemed gray\nnow.\n\nSo was Harry Collins' face, when he emerged from his interview with\nDr. Manschoff that evening. And it was still pallid the next afternoon\nwhen he came down to the river bank and waited for Ritchie to\nreappear.\n\nThe little man emerged from the bushes. He stared at Harry's drawn\ncountenance and nodded slowly.\n\n\"I was right, eh?\" he muttered.\n\n\"It looks that way. But I can't understand what's going on. If this\nisn't just a treatment center, if they're not really interested in my\nwelfare, then what am I doing here?\"\n\n\"You're taking part in an experiment. This, my friend, is a\nlaboratory. And you are a nice, healthy guinea pig.\"\n\n\"But that doesn't make sense. I haven't been experimented on. They've\nlet me do as I please.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And what do guinea pigs excel at? _Breeding._\"\n\n\"You mean this whole thing was rigged up just so that Sue and I\nwould--?\"\n\n\"Please, let's not be so egocentric, shall we? After all, you're not\nthe _only_ male patient in this place. There are a dozen others\nwandering around loose. Some of them have their favorite caves, others\nhave discovered little bypaths, but all of them seem to have located\nideal trysting-places. Whereupon, of course, the volunteer nurses have\nlocated _them_.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me the same situation exists with each of the\nothers?\"\n\n\"Isn't it fairly obvious? You've shown no inclination to become\nfriendly with the rest of the patients here, and none of them have\nmade any overtures to you. That's because everyone has his own little\nsecret, his own private arrangement. And so all of you go around\nfooling everybody else, and all of you are being fooled. I'll give\ncredit to Manschoff and his staff on that point--he's certainly\nmastered the principles of practical psychology.\"\n\n\"But you talked about breeding. With our present overpopulation\nproblem, why in the world do they deliberately encourage the birth of\nmore children?\"\n\n\"Very well put. 'Why in the world' indeed! In order to answer that,\nyou'd better take a good look at the world.\"\n\nArnold Ritchie seated himself on the grass, pulled out a pipe, and\nthen replaced it hastily. \"Better not smoke,\" he murmured. \"Be awkward\nif we attracted any attention and were found together.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry stared at him. \"You _are_ a Naturalist, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I'm a reporter, by profession.\"\n\n\"Which network?\"\n\n\"No network. _Newzines._ There are still a few in print, you know.\"\n\n\"I know. But I can't afford them.\"\n\n\"There aren't many left who can, or who even feel the need of reading\nthem. Nevertheless, mavericks like myself still cling to the ancient\nand honorable practices of the Fourth Estate. One of which is\nferreting out the inside story, the news behind the news.\"\n\n\"Then you're not working for the Naturalists.\"\n\n\"Of course I am. I'm working for them and for everybody else who has\nan interest in learning the truth.\" Ritchie paused. \"By the way, you\nkeep using that term as if it were some kind of dirty word. Just what\ndoes it mean? What _is_ a Naturalist, in your book?\"\n\n\"Why, a radical thinker, of course. An opponent of government\npolicies, of progress. One who believes we're running out of living\nspace, using up the last of our natural resources.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose motivates Naturalists, really?\"\n\n\"Well, they can't stand the pressures of daily living, or the\nprospects of a future when we'll be still more hemmed in.\"\n\nRitchie nodded. \"Any more than you could, a few months ago, when you\ntried to commit suicide. Wouldn't you say that _you_ were thinking\nlike a Naturalist then?\"\n\nHarry grimaced. \"I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Don't feel ashamed. You saw the situation clearly, just as the\nso-called Naturalists do. And just as the government does. Only the\ngovernment can't dare admit it--hence the secrecy behind this\nproject.\"\n\n\"A hush-hush government plan to stimulate further breeding? I still\ndon't see--\"\n\n\"Look at the world,\" Ritchie repeated. \"Look at it realistically.\nWhat's the situation at present? Population close to six billion, and\nrising fast. There was a leveling-off period in the Sixties, and then\nit started to climb again. No wars, no disease to cut it down. The\ndevelopment of synthetic foods, the use of algae and fungi, rules out\nfamine as a limiting factor. Increased harnessing of atomic power has\ndone away with widespread poverty, so there's no economic deterrent to\npropagation. Neither church nor state dares set up a legal\nprohibition. So here we are, at the millennium. In place of\ninternational tension we've substituted internal tension. In place of\nthermonuclear explosion, we have a population explosion.\"\n\n\"You make it look pretty grim.\"\n\n\"I'm just talking about today. What happens ten years from now, when\nwe hit a population-level of ten billion? What happens when we reach\ntwenty billion, fifty billion, a hundred? Don't talk to me about more\nsubstitutes, more synthetics, new ways of conserving top-soil. There\njust isn't going to be _room_ for everyone!\"\n\n\"Then what's the answer?\"\n\n\"That's what the government wants to know. Believe me, they've done a\nlot of searching; most of it _sub rosa_. And then along came this man\nLeffingwell, with _his_ solution. That's just what it is, of\ncourse--an endocrinological solution, for direct injection.\"\n\n\"Leffingwell? The Dr. Leffingwell whose name was on that photostat?\nWhat's he got to do with all this?\"\n\n\"He's boss of this project,\" Ritchie said. \"He's the one who persuaded\nthem to set up a breeding-center. You're _his_ guinea pig.\"\n\n\"But why all the secrecy?\"\n\n\"That's what I wanted to know. That's why I scurried around, pulled\nstrings to get a lab technician's job here. It wasn't easy, believe\nme. The whole deal is being kept strictly under wraps until\nLeffingwell's experiments prove out. They realized right away that it\nwould be fatal to use volunteers for the experiments--they'd be bound\nto talk, there'd be leaks. And of course, they anticipated some\nawkward results at first, until the technique is refined and\nperfected. Well, they were right on that score. I've seen some of\ntheir failures.\" Ritchie shuddered. \"Any volunteer--any military man,\ngovernment employee or even a so-called dedicated scientist who broke\naway would spread enough rumors about what was going on to kill the\nentire project. That's why they decided to use mental patients for\nsubjects. God knows, they had millions to choose from, but they were\nvery particular. You're a rare specimen, Collins.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because you happen to fit all their specifications. You're young, in\ngood physical condition. Unlike ninety percent of the population, you\ndon't even wear contact lenses, do you? And your aberration was\ntemporary, easily removed by removing you from the tension-sources\nwhich created it. You have no family ties, no close friends, to\nquestion your absence. That's why you were chosen--one of the two\nhundred.\"\n\n\"Two hundred? But there's only a dozen others here now.\"\n\n\"A dozen males, yes. You're forgetting the females. Must be about\nfifty or sixty in the other building.\"\n\n\"But if you're talking about someone like Sue, she's a nurse--\"\n\nRitchie shook his head. \"That's what she was _told_ to say. Actually,\nshe's a patient, too. They're all patients. Twelve men and sixty\nwomen, at the moment. Originally, about thirty men and a hundred and\nseventy women.\"\n\n\"What happened to the others?\"\n\n\"I told you there were some failures. Many of the women died in\nchildbirth. Some of them survived, but found out about the\nresults--and the results, up until now, haven't been perfect. A few of\nthe men found out, too. Well, they have only one method of dealing\nwith failures here. They dispose of them. I told you about that\nchimney, didn't I?\"\n\n\"You mean they killed the offspring, killed those who found out about\nthem?\"\n\nRitchie shrugged.\n\n\"But what are they actually _doing_? Who is this Dr. Leffingwell?\nWhat's it all about?\"\n\n\"I think I can answer those questions for you.\"\n\nHarry wheeled at the sound of the familiar voice.\n\nDr. Manschoff beamed down at him from the top of the river bank.\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said. \"I wasn't following you with any intent\nto eavesdrop. I was merely concerned about him.\" His eyes flickered as\nhe directed his gaze past Harry's shoulder, and Harry turned again to\nlook at Arnold Ritchie.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little man was no longer standing and he was no longer alone. Two\nattendants now supported him, one on either side, and Ritchie himself\nsagged against their grip with eyes closed. A hypodermic needle in one\nattendant's hand indicated the reason for Ritchie's sudden collapse.\n\n\"Merely a heavy sedative,\" Dr. Manschoff murmured. \"We came prepared,\nin expectation of just such an emergency.\" He nodded at his\ncompanions. \"Better take him back now,\" he said. \"I'll look in on him\nthis evening, when he comes out of it.\"\n\n\"Sorry about all this,\" Manschoff continued, sitting down next to\nHarry as the orderlies lifted Ritchie's inert form and carried him up\nthe slanting slope. \"It's entirely my fault. I misjudged my\npatient--never should have permitted him such a degree of freedom.\nObviously, he's not ready for it yet. I do hope he didn't upset you in\nany way.\"\n\n\"No. He seemed quite\"--Harry hesitated, then went on\nhastily--\"logical.\"\n\n\"Indeed he is.\" Dr. Manschoff smiled. \"Paranoid delusions, as they\nused to call them, can often be rationalized most convincingly. And\nfrom what little I heard, he was doing an excellent job, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"I know.\" A slight sigh erased the smile. \"Leffingwell and I are mad\nscientists, conducting biological experiments on human guinea pigs.\nWe've assembled patients for breeding purposes and the government is\nsecretly subsidizing us. Also, we incinerate our victims--again, with\nfull governmental permission. All very logical, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Harry told him. \"It's just that he said Sue was\npregnant and he was hinting things.\"\n\n\"Said?\" Manschoff stood up. \"_Hinted?_ I'm surprised he didn't go\nfurther than that. Just today, we discovered he'd been using the\noffice facilities--he had a sort of probationary position, as you may\nhave guessed, helping out the staff in administration--to provide\ntangible proof of his artistic creations. He was writing out 'official\nreports' and then photostating them. Apparently he intended to\ncirculate the results as 'evidence' to support his delusions. Look,\nhere's a sample.\"\n\nDr. Manschoff passed a square of glossy paper to Harry, who scanned it\nquickly. It was another laboratory report similar to the one Ritchie\nhad shown him, but containing a different set of names.\n\n\"No telling how long this sort of thing has been going on,\" Manschoff\nsaid. \"He may have made dozens. Naturally, the moment we discovered\nit, we realized prompt action was necessary. He'll need special\nattention.\"\n\n\"But what's wrong with him?\"\n\n\"It's a long story. He was a reporter at one time--he may have told\nyou that. The death of his wife precipitated a severe trauma and\nbrought him to our attention. Actually, I'm not at liberty to say any\nmore regarding his case; you understand, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Then you're telling me that everything he had to say was a product of\nhis imagination?\"\n\n\"No, don't misunderstand. It would be more correct to state that he\nmerely distorted reality. For example, there _is_ a Dr. Leffingwell on\nthe staff here; he is a diagnostician and has nothing to do with\npsychotherapy _per se_. And he has charge of the hospital ward in Unit\nThree, the third building you may have noticed behind Administration.\nThat's where the nurses maintain residence, of course. Incidentally,\nwhen any nurses take on a--special assignment, as it were, such as\nyours, Leffingwell does examine and treat them. There's a new oral\ncontraception technique he's evolved which may be quite efficacious.\nBut I'd hardly call it an example of sinister experimentation under\nthe circumstances, would you?\"\n\nHarry shook his head. \"About Ritchie, though,\" he said. \"What will\nhappen to him?\"\n\n\"I can't offer any prognosis. In view of my recent error in judgment\nconcerning him, it's hard to say how he'll respond to further\ntreatment. But rest assured that I'll do my best for his case. Chances\nare you'll be seeing him again before very long.\"\n\nDr. Manschoff glanced at his watch. \"Shall we go back now?\" he\nsuggested. \"Supper will be served soon.\"\n\nThe two men toiled up the bank.\n\nHarry discovered that the doctor was right about supper. It was being\nserved as he returned to his room. But the predictions concerning\nRitchie didn't work out quite as well.\n\nIt was after supper--indeed, quite some hours afterwards, while Harry\nsat at his window and stared sleeplessly out into the night--that he\nnoted the thick, greasy spirals of black smoke rising suddenly from\nthe chimney of the Third Unit building. And the sight may have\nprepared him for the failure of Dr. Manschoff's prophecy regarding his\ndisturbed patient.\n\nHarry never asked any questions, and no explanations were ever\nforthcoming.\n\nBut from that evening onward, nobody ever saw Arnold Ritchie again.\n\n\n\n\n3. President Winthrop--1999\n\n\nThe Secretary of State closed the door.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\nPresident Winthrop looked up from the desk and blinked. \"Hello, Art,\"\nhe said. \"Sit down.\"\n\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" the Secretary told him. \"I came as soon as I got the\ncall.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" The President lit a cigarette and pursed his lips\naround it until it stopped wobbling. \"I've been checking the reports\nall night.\"\n\n\"You look tired.\"\n\n\"I am. I could sleep for a week. That is, I _wish_ I could.\"\n\n\"Any luck?\"\n\nThe President pushed the papers aside and drummed the desk for a\nmoment. Then he offered the Secretary a gray ghost of a smile.\n\n\"The answer's still the same.\"\n\n\"But this was our last chance--\"\n\n\"I know.\" The President leaned back. \"When I think of the time and\neffort, the money that's been poured into these projects! To say\nnothing of the hopes we had. And now, it's all for nothing.\"\n\n\"You can't say that,\" the Secretary answered. \"After all, we did reach\nthe moon. We got to Mars.\" He paused. \"No one can take that away from\nyou. You sponsored the Martian flights. You fought for the\nappropriations, pushed the project, carried it through. You helped\nmankind realize its greatest dream--\"\n\n\"Save that for the newscasts,\" the President said. \"The fact remains,\nwe've succeeded. And our success was a failure. Mankind's greatest\ndream, eh? Read these reports and you'll find out this is mankind's\ngreatest nightmare.\"\n\n\"Is it that bad?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The President slumped in his chair. \"It's that bad. We can\nreach the moon at will. Now we can send a manned flight to Mars. But\nit means nothing. We can't support life in either place. There's\nabsolutely no possibility of establishing or maintaining an outpost,\nlet alone a large colony or a permanent human residence. That's what\nall the reports conclusively demonstrate.\n\n\"Every bit of oxygen, every bit of food and clothing and material,\nwould have to be supplied. And investigations prove there's no chance\nof ever realizing any return. The cost of such an operation is\nstaggeringly prohibitive. Even if there was evidence to show it might\nbe possible to undertake some mining projects, it wouldn't begin to\ndefray expenses, once you consider the transportation factor.\"\n\n\"But if they improve the rockets, manage to make room for a bigger\npayload, wouldn't it be cheaper?\"\n\n\"It would still cost roughly a billion dollars to equip a flight and\nmaintain a personnel of twenty men for a year,\" the President told\nhim. \"I've checked into that, and even this estimate is based on the\nmost optimistic projection. So you can see there's no use in\ncontinuing now. We'll never solve our problems by attempting to\ncolonize the moon or Mars.\"\n\n\"But it's the only possible solution left to us.\"\n\n\"No it isn't,\" the President said. \"There's always our friend\nLeffingwell.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Secretary of State turned away. \"You can't officially sponsor a\nthing like that,\" he muttered. \"It's political suicide.\"\n\nThe gray smile returned to the gray lips. \"Suicide? What do you know\nabout suicide, Art? I've been reading a few statistics on _that_, too.\nHow many actual suicides do you think we had in this country last\nyear?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand? Two hundred, maybe?\"\n\n\"Two million.\" The President leaned forward. \"Add to that, over a\nmillion murders and six million crimes of violence.\"\n\n\"I never knew--\"\n\n\"Damned right you didn't! We used to have a Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to help prevent such things. Now the big job is merely\nto hush them up. We're doing everything in our power just to keep\nthese matters quiet, or else there'd be utter panic. Then there's the\naccident total and the psycho rate. We can't build institutions fast\nenough to hold the mental cases, nor train doctors enough to care for\nthem. Shifting them into other jobs in other areas doesn't cure, and\nit no longer even disguises what is happening. At this rate, another\nten years will see half the nation going insane. And it's like this\nall over the world.\n\n\"This is race-suicide, Art. Race-suicide through sheer fecundity.\nLeffingwell is right. The reproductive instinct, unchecked, will\noverbalance group survival in the end. How long has it been since you\nwere out on the streets?\"\n\nThe Secretary of State shrugged. \"You know I never go out on the\nstreets,\" he said. \"It isn't very safe.\"\n\n\"Of course not. But it's no safer for the hundreds of millions who\nhave to go out every day. Accident, crime, the sheer maddening\nproximity of the crowds--these phenomena are increasing through\nmathematical progression. And they must be stopped. Leffingwell has\nthe only answer.\"\n\n\"They won't buy it,\" warned the Secretary. \"Congress won't, and the\nvoters won't, any more than they bought birth-control. And this is\nworse.\"\n\n\"I know that, too.\" The President rose and walked over to the window,\nlooking out at the sky-scraper apartments which loomed across what had\nonce been the Mall. He was trying to find the dwarfed spire of\nWashington's Monument in the tangled maze of stone.\n\n\"If I go before the people and sponsor Leffingwell, I'm through.\nThrough as President, through with the Party. They'll crucify me. But\nsomebody in authority must push this project. That's the beginning.\nOnce it's known, people will have to think about the possibilities.\nThere'll be opposition, then controversy, then debate. And gradually\nLeffingwell will gain adherents. It may take five years, it may take\nten. Finally, the change will come. First through volunteers. Then by\nlaw. I only pray that it happens soon.\"\n\n\"They'll curse your name,\" the Secretary said. \"They'll try to kill\nyou. It's going to be hell.\"\n\n\"Hell for me if I do, yes. Worse hell for the whole world if I don't.\"\n\n\"But are you quite sure it will work? His method, I mean?\"\n\n\"You saw the reports on his tests, didn't you? It works, all right.\nWe've got more than just abstract data, now. We've got films for the\ntelescreenings all set up.\"\n\n\"Films? You mean you'll actually _show_ what the results are? Why,\njust telling the people will be bad enough. And admitting the\ngovernment sponsored the project under wraps. But when they _see_,\nnothing on earth can save you from assassination.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. It doesn't really matter.\" The President crushed his\ncigarette in the ashtray. \"One less mouth to feed. And I'm getting\npretty sick of synthetic meals, anyway.\"\n\nPresident Winthrop turned to the Secretary, his eyes brightening\nmomentarily. \"Tell you what, Art. I'm not planning on breaking the\nproposal to the public until next Monday. What say we have a little\nprivate dinner party on Saturday evening, just the Cabinet members and\ntheir wives? Sort of a farewell celebration, in a way, but we won't\ncall it that, of course? Chef tells me there's still twenty pounds of\nhamburger in the freezers.\"\n\n\"Twenty pounds of hamburger? You mean it?\" The Secretary of State was\nsmiling, too.\n\n\"That's right.\" The President of the United States grinned in\nanticipation. \"Been a long time since I've tasted a real,\nhonest-to-goodness hamburger.\"\n\n\n\n\n4. Harry Collins--2000\n\n\nHarry didn't ask any questions. He just kept his mouth shut and\nwaited. Maybe Dr. Manschoff suspected and maybe he didn't. Anyway,\nthere was no trouble. Harry figured there wouldn't be, as long as he\nstayed in line and went through the proper motions. It was all a\nmatter of pretending to conform, pretending to agree, pretending to\nbelieve.\n\nSo he watched his step--_except in the dreams, and then he was always\nfalling into the yawning abyss_.\n\nHe kept his nose clean--_but in the dreams he smelled the blood and\nbrimstone of the pit_.\n\nHe managed to retain a cheerful smile at all times--_though, in the\ndreams, he screamed_.\n\nEventually, he even met Myrna. She was the pretty little brunette whom\nRitchie had mentioned, and she did her best to console him--_only in\ndreams, when he embraced her, he was embracing a writhing coil of\nslimy smoke_.\n\nIt may have been that Harry Collins went a little mad, just having to\npretend that he was sane. But he learned the way, and he managed. He\nsaved the madness (_or was it the reality?_) for the dreams.\n\nMeanwhile he waited and said nothing.\n\nHe said nothing when, after three months or so, Myrna was suddenly\n\"transferred\" without warning.\n\nHe said nothing when, once a week or so, he went in to visit with Dr.\nManschoff.\n\nHe said nothing when Manschoff volunteered the information that\nRitchie had been \"transferred\" too, or suggested that it would be best\nto stay on for \"further therapy.\"\n\nAnd he said nothing when still a third nurse came his way; a woman who\nwas callid, complaisant, and nauseatingly nymphomaniac.\n\nThe important thing was to stay alive. Stay alive and try to learn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took him almost an additional year to find out what he wanted to\nfind out. More than eight months passed before he found a way of\nsneaking out of his room at night, and a way of getting into that\nThird Unit through a delivery door which was occasionally left open\nthrough negligence.\n\nEven then, all he learned was that the female patients did have their\nliving quarters here, along with the members of the staff\nand--presumably--Dr. Leffingwell. Many of the women _were_ patients\nrather than nurses, as claimed, and a good number of them were in\nvarious stages of pregnancy, but this proved nothing.\n\nSeveral times Harry debated the possibilities of taking some of the\nother men in his Unit into his confidence. Then he remembered what had\nhappened to Arnold Ritchie and decided against this course. The risk\nwas too great. He had to continue alone.\n\nIt wasn't until Harry managed to get into Unit Four that he got what\nhe wanted (what he _didn't_ want) and learned that reality and dreams\nwere one and the same.\n\nThere was the night, more than a year after he'd come to the treatment\ncenter, when he finally broke into the basement and found the\nincinerators. And the incinerators led to the operating and delivery\nchambers, and the delivery chambers led to the laboratory and the\nlaboratory led to the incubators and the incubators led to the\nnightmare.\n\nIn the nightmare Harry found himself looking down at the mistakes and\nthe failures and he recognized them for what they were, and he knew\nthen why the incinerators were kept busy and why the black smoke\npoured.\n\nIn the nightmare he saw the special units containing those which were\nnot mistakes or failures, and in a way they were worse than the\nothers. They were red and wriggling there beneath the glass, and on\nthe glass surfaces hung the charts which gave the data. Then Harry saw\nthe names, saw his own name repeated twice--once for Sue, once for\nMyrna. And he realized that he had contributed to the successful\noutcome or issue of the experiments (_outcome? Issue? These horrors?_)\nand that was why Manschoff must have chosen to take the risk of\nkeeping him alive. Because he was one of the _good_ guinea pigs, and\nhe had spawned, spawned living, mewing abominations.\n\nHe had dreamed of these things, and now he saw that they were real, so\nthat nightmare merged with _now_, and he could gaze down at it with\nopen eyes and scream at last with open mouth.\n\nThen, of course, an attendant came running (_although he seemed to be\nmoving ever so slowly, because everything moves so slowly in a dream_)\nand Harry saw him coming and lifted a bell-glass and smashed it down\nover the man's head (_slowly, ever so slowly_) and then he heard the\nothers coming and he climbed out of the window and ran.\n\nThe searchlights winked across the courtyards and the sirens vomited\nhysteria from metallic throats and the night was filled with shadows\nthat pursued.\n\nBut Harry knew where to run. He ran straight through the nightmare,\nthrough all the fantastic but familiar convolutions of sight and\nsound, and then he came to the river and plunged in.\n\nNow the nightmare was not sight or sound, but merely sensation. Icy\ncold and distilled darkness; ripples that ran, then raced and roiled\nand roared. But there had to be a way out of the nightmare and there\nhad to be a way out of the canyon, and that way was the river.\n\nApparently no one else had thought of the river; perhaps they had\nconsidered it as a possible avenue of escape and then discarded the\nnotion when they realized how it ripped and raged among the rocks as\nit finally plunged from the canyon's mouth. Obviously, no one could\nhope to combat that current and survive.\n\nBut strange things happen in nightmares. And you fight the numbness\nand the blackness and you claw and convulse and you twist and turn and\ntoss and then you ride the crests of frenzy and plunge into the\ntroughs of panic and despair and you sweep round and round and sink\ndown into nothingness until you break through to the freedom which\ncomes only with oblivion.\n\nSomewhere beyond the canyon's moiling maw, Harry Collins found that\nfreedom and that oblivion. He escaped from the nightmare, just as he\nescaped from the river.\n\nThe river itself roared on without him.\n\nAnd the nightmare continued, too....\n\n\n\n\n5. Minnie Schultz--2009\n\n\nWhen Frank came home, Minnie met him at the door. She didn't say a\nword, just handed him the envelope containing the notice.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Frank asked, trying to take her in his arms. \"You\nbeen crying.\"\n\n\"Never mind.\" Minnie freed herself. \"Just read what it says there.\"\n\nFrank read slowly, determinedly, his features contorted in\nconcentration. Vocational Apt had terminated his schooling at the old\ngrade-school level, and while like all students he had been taught\nenough so that he could read the necessary advertising commercials,\nany printed message of this sort provided a definite challenge.\n\nHalfway through the notice he started to scowl. \"What kind of monkey\nbusiness is this?\"\n\n\"No monkey business. It's the new law. Everybody that gets married in\nAngelisco takes the shots, from now on. Fella from State Hall, he told\nme when he delivered this.\"\n\n\"We'll see about this,\" Frank muttered. \"No damn government's gonna\ntell me how to run my life. Sa free country, ain't so?\"\n\nMinnie's mouth began to twitch. \"They're coming back tomorra morning,\nthe fella said. To give me the first shots. Gee, honey, I'm scared,\nlike. I don't want 'em.\"\n\n\"That settles it,\" Frank said. \"We're getting out of this place,\nfast.\"\n\n\"Where'd we go?\"\n\n\"Dunno. Someplace. Texas, maybe. I was listening to the 'casts at work\ntoday. They don't have this law in Texas. Not yet, anyway. Come on,\nstart packing.\"\n\n\"Packing? But how'll we get there?\"\n\n\"Fly. We'll jet right out.\"\n\n\"You got prior'ty reservations or something?\"\n\n\"No.\" The scowl returned to Frank's forehead. \"But maybe if I pitch\n'em a sob story, tell 'em it's our honeymoon, you know, then we\ncould--\"\n\nMinnie shook her head. \"It won't work, honey. You know that. Takes six\nmonths to get a prior'ty clearance or whatever they call it. Besides,\nyour job and all--what'll you do in Texas? They've got your number\nlisted here. Why, we couldn't even _land_, like. I bet Texas is even\nmore crowded than Angelisco these days, in the cities. And all the\nrest of it is Ag Culture project, isn't it?\"\n\nFrank was leaning against the sink, listening. Now he took three steps\nforward and sat down on the bed. He didn't look at her as he spoke.\n\n\"Well, we gotta do something,\" he said. \"You don't want those shots\nand that's for sure. Maybe I can have one of those other things\ninstead, those whaddya-call-'ems.\"\n\n\"You mean where they operate you, like?\"\n\n\"That's right. A vas-something. You know, sterilize you. Then we won't\nhave to worry.\"\n\nMinnie took a deep breath. Then she sat down and put her arm around\nFrank.\n\n\"But you wanted kids,\" she murmured. \"You told me, when we got\nmarried, you always wanted to have a son--\"\n\nFrank pulled away.\n\n\"Sure I do,\" he said. \"A son. That's what I want. A _real_ son. Not a\nfreak. Not a damned little monster that has to go to the Clinic every\nmonth and take injections so it won't grow. And what happens to you if\nyou take _your_ shots now? What if they drive you crazy or something?\"\n\nMinnie put her arm around Frank again and made him look at her.\n\"That's not true,\" she told him. \"That's just a lot of Naturalist\ntalk. I know.\"\n\n\"Hell you do.\"\n\n\"But I do, honey! Honest, like! May Stebbins, she took the shots last\nyear, when they asked for volunteers. And she's all right. You seen\nher baby yourself, remember? It's the sweetest little thing, and awful\nsmart! So maybe it wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\n\"I'll ask about being operated tomorrow,\" Frank said. \"Forget it. It\ndon't matter.\"\n\n\"Of course it matters.\" Minnie looked straight at him. \"Don't you\nthink I know what you been going through? Sweating it out on that job\nday after day, going nuts in the traffic, saving up the ration coupons\nso's we'd have extra food for the honeymoon and all?\n\n\"You didn't have to marry me, you know that. It was just like we could\nhave a place of our own together, and kids. Well, we're gonna have\n'em, honey. I'll take the shots.\"\n\nFrank shook his head but said nothing.\n\n\"It won't be so bad,\" Minnie went on. \"The shots don't hurt at all,\nand they make it easier, carrying the baby. They say you don't even\nget morning sickness or anything. And just think, when we have a kid,\nwe get a chance for a bigger place. We go right on the housing lists.\nWe can have two rooms. A real bedroom, maybe.\"\n\nFrank stared at her. \"Is that all you can think about?\" he asked. \"A\nreal bedroom?\"\n\n\"But honey--\"\n\n\"What about the kid?\" he muttered. \"How you suppose it's gonna feel?\nHow'd you like to grow up and _not_ grow up? How'd you like to be a\nmidget three feet high in a world where everybody else is bigger? What\nkind of a life you call _that_? I want my son to have a decent\nchance.\"\n\n\"He will have.\"\n\nMinnie stared back at him, but she wasn't seeing his face. \"Don't you\nunderstand, honey? This isn't just something happening to _us_. We're\nnot special. It's happening to everybody, all over the country, all\nover the world. You seen it in the 'casts, haven't you? Most states,\nthey adopted the laws. And in a couple more years it'll be the only\nway anyone will ever have kids. Ten, twenty years from now, the kids\nwill be growing up. Ours won't be different then, because from now on\nall the kids will be just like he is. The same size.\"\n\n\"I thought you was afraid of the shots,\" Frank said.\n\nMinnie was still staring. \"I was, honey. Only, I dunno. I keep\nthinking about Grandma.\"\n\n\"What's the old lady got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Well, I remember when I was a little girl, like. How my Grandma\nalways used to tell me about _her_ Grandma, when _she_ was a little\ngirl.\n\n\"She was saying about how in the old days, before there even was an\nAngelisco--when her Grandma came out here in a covered wagon. Just\nthink, honey, she was younger than I am, and she come thousands and\nthousands of miles in a wagon! With real horses, like! Wasn't any\nhouses, no people or nothing. Except Indians that shot at them. And\nthey climbed up the mountains and they crossed over the deserts and\nwent hungry and thirsty and had fights with those Indians all the\nway. But they never stopped until they got here. Because they was the\npioneers.\"\n\n\"Pioneers?\"\n\n\"That's what Grandma said _her_ Grandma called herself. A pioneer. She\nwas real proud of it, too. Because it means having the courage to cut\nloose from all the old things and try something new when you need to.\nStart a whole new world, a whole new kind of life.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I always wanted to be a pioneer, like, but I never\nthought I'd get the chance.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? What's all this got to do with us, or\nhaving a kid?\"\n\n\"Don't you see? Taking these shots, having a baby this new way--it's\nsort of being a pioneer, too. Gonna help bring a new kind of people\ninto a new kind of world. And if that's not being a pioneer, like,\nit's the closest I can come to it. It sounds right to me now.\"\n\nMinnie smiled and nodded. \"I guess I made up my mind just now. I'm\ntaking the shots.\"\n\n\"Hell you are!\" Frank told her. \"We'll talk about it some more in the\nmorning.\"\n\nBut Minnie continued to smile.\n\nAnd that night, as she lay in the utility bed, the squeaking of the\nsprings became the sound of turning wheels. The plastic walls and\nceiling of the eightieth-floor apartment turned to billowing canvas,\nand the thunder of the passing jets transformed itself into the\ndrumming hoofbeats of a million buffalo.\n\n_Let Frank talk to her again in the morning if he liked_, Minnie\nthought. _It wouldn't make any difference now. Because you can't stop\nus pioneers._\n\n\n\n\n6. Harry Collins--2012\n\n\nHarry crouched behind the boulders, propping the rifle up between the\nrocks, and adjusted the telescopic sights. The distant doorway sprang\ninto sharp focus. Grunting with satisfaction, he settled down to his\nvigil. The rifle-barrel had been dulled down against detection by\nreflection, and Harry's dark glasses protected him against the glare\nof the morning sun. He might have to wait several hours now, but he\ndidn't care. It had taken him twelve years to come this far, and he\nwas willing to wait a little while longer.\n\n_Twelve years._ Was it really that long?\n\nA mirror might have answered him; a mirror might have shown him the\nharsh features of a man of forty-two. But Harry needed no mirror. He\ncould remember the past dozen years only too easily--though they had\nnot been easy years.\n\nSurviving the river was only the beginning. Animal strength carried\nhim through that ordeal. But he emerged from the river as an animal; a\nwounded animal, crawling through the brush and arroyo outside the\nsouthern Colorado canyon.\n\nAnd it was animal cunning which preserved him. He'd wandered several\ndays until he encountered Emil Grizek and his outfit. By that time he\nwas half-starved and completely delirious. It took a month until he\nwas up and around again.\n\nBut Emil and the boys had nursed him through. They took turns caring\nfor him in the bunkhouse; their methods were crude but efficient and\nHarry was grateful. Best of all, they asked no questions. Harry's\nstatus was that of a hunted fugitive, without a Vocational Apt record\nor rating. The authorities or any prospective employers would inquire\ninto these things, but Emil Grizek never seemed curious. By the time\nHarry was up and around again, he'd been accepted as one of the bunch.\nHe told them his name was Harry Sanders, and that was enough.\n\nTwo months after they found him, he'd signed on with Emil Grizek and\nfound a new role in life.\n\nHarry Collins, advertising copywriter, had become Harry Sanders,\nworking cowhand.\n\nThere was surprisingly little difficulty. Grizek had absentee\nemployers who weren't interested in their foreman's methods, just as\nlong as he recruited his own wranglers for the Bar B Ranch. Nobody\ndemanded to see Apt cards or insisted on making out formal\nwork-reports, and the pay was in cash. Cowhands were hard to come by\nthese days, and it was an unspoken premise that the men taking on such\njobs would be vagrants, migratory workers, fugitives from justice and\ninjustice. A generation or so ago they might have become tramps--but\nthe last of the hoboes had vanished along with the last of the freight\ntrains. Once the derelicts haunted the canyons of the big cities;\ntoday there was no place for them there, so they fled to the canyons\nof the west. Harry had found himself a new niche, and no questions\nasked.\n\nOddly enough, he fitted in. The outdoor life agreed with him, and in a\nmatter of months he was a passable cowpoke; within a year he was one\nof Grizek's top hands.\n\nHe learned to ride a bucking jeep with the best of them, and he could\nspot, single out, and stun a steer in forty seconds flat; then use his\nelectronic brander on it and have the critter back on its feet in just\nunder a minute.\n\nWork was no problem, and neither was recreation. The bunkhouse offered\ncrude but adequate facilities for living; old-fashioned\nair-conditioning and an antique infra-red broiler seemed good enough\nfor roughing it, and Cookie at least turned out real man-sized meals.\nEating genuine beef and honest-to-goodness baked bread was a treat,\nand so was having the luxury of all that space in the sleeping\nquarters. Harry thrived on it.\n\nAnd some of the other hands were interesting companions. True, they\nwere renegades and mavericks, but they were each of them unique and\nindividual, and Harry enjoyed listening to them fan the breeze during\nthe long nights.\n\nThere was Big Phil, who was pushing sixty now. But you'd never know\nit, not unless you got him to talking about the old days when he'd\nbeen a boy in Detroit. His daddy had been one of the last of the Union\nMen, back in the days of what they used to call the Organized Labor\nMovement. He could tell you about wage-hour agreements and the\nRailroad Brotherhood and contract negotiations almost as if he knew of\nthese things through personal experience. He even remembered the\nDemocratic Party. Phil got out when the government took over and set\nup Vocational Apt and Industrial Supervision; that's when he drifted\nwest.\n\nTom Lowery's family had been military; he claimed to have been a\nmember of the last graduating class ever to leave West Point. When the\narmament race ended, his prospects of a career vanished, and he\nsettled down as a guard at Canaveral. Finally, he'd headed for the\nopen country.\n\nBassett was the scholar of the outfit. He could sit around and quote\nold-time book-authors by the hour--classic writers like Prather and\nSpillane. In another age he might have been a college professor or\neven a football coach; he had an aptitude for the arts.\n\nAnd there was Lobo, the misogynist, who had fled a wife and eleven\nchildren back in Monterey; and Januzki, who used to be mixed up with\none of those odd religious cults out on the Coast. He bragged he'd\nbeen one of the Big Daddy-Os in the Beat Generationists, and he argued\nwith Bassett about some old-time evangelist named Kerouac.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBest of all, though, Harry liked talking to Nick Kendrick. Nick's\nhobby was music, and he treasured his second-hand stereophonic unit\nand collection of tapes. He too was a classicist in his way, and there\nwas many a long winter night when Harry sat there listening to ancient\nfolk songs. The quaint atonalities of progressive jazz and the\nchildishly frantic rhythms of \"cool sounds\" were somehow soothing and\nreassuring in their reminder of a simple heritage from a simpler age.\n\nBut above all, these men were wranglers, and they took a peculiar\npride in the traditions of their own calling. There wasn't a one of\nthem who wouldn't spend hours mulling over the lore of the range and\nthe prairie. They knew the Great Names from the Great Days--Eugene\nAutry, Wyatt Earp, the legendary Thomas Mix, Dale Robertson, Paladin,\nand all the others; men who rode actual horses in the era when the\nWest was really an untamed frontier.\n\nAnd like the cowboys they were, they maintained the customs of other\ndays. Every few months they rode a bucking helicopter into some raw\nwestern town--Las Vegas, or Reno, or even over to Palm Springs--to\ndrink recklessly in the cocktail lounges, gamble wildly at the slots,\nor \"go down the line\" with some telescreen model on location for\noutdoor ad-backgrounds. There were still half a dozen such sin-cities\nscattered throughout the west; even the government acknowledged the\nneed of lonely men to blow off steam. And though Ag Culture officially\ndisapproved of the whole cowhand system, and talked grimly of setting\nup new and more efficient methods for training personnel and handling\nthe cattle ranges, nothing was ever done. Perhaps the authorities knew\nthat it was a hopeless task; only the outcasts and iconoclasts had the\ntemperament necessary to survive such loneliness under an open sky.\nCity-dwelling conformists just could not endure the monotony.\n\nBut even Emil Grizek's hands marvelled at the way Harry lived. He\nnever joined them in their disorderly descent upon the scarlet cities\nof the plain, and most of the time he didn't even seem to watch the\ntelescreen. If anything, he deliberately avoided all possible contact\nwith civilization.\n\nSince he never volunteered any information about his own past, they\nprivately concluded that he was just a psychopathic personality.\n\n\"Strong regressive and seclusive tendencies,\" Bassett explained,\nsolemnly.\n\n\"Sure,\" Nick Kendrick nodded, wisely. \"You mean a Mouldy Fig, like.\"\n\n\"Creeping Meatball,\" muttered cultist Januzki. Not being religious\nfanatics, the others didn't understand the reference. But gradually\nthey came to accept Harry's isolationist ways as the norm--at least,\nfor him. And since he never quarreled, never exhibited any signs of\ndissatisfaction, he was left to his own pattern.\n\nThus it was all the more surprising when that pattern was rudely and\nabruptly shattered.\n\nHarry remembered the occasion well. It was the day the Leff Law was\nofficially upheld by the Supremist Courts. The whole business came\nover the telescreens and there was no way of avoiding it--you couldn't\navoid it, because everybody was talking about it and everybody was\nwatching.\n\n\"Now what do you think?\" Emil Grizek demanded. \"Any woman wants a\nbaby, she's got to have those shots. They say kids shrink down into\nnothing. Weigh less than two pounds when they're born, and never grow\nup to be any bigger than midgets. You ask me, the whole thing's plumb\nloco, to say nothing of psychotic.\"\n\n\"I dunno.\" This from Big Phil. \"Reckon they just about have to do\nsomething, the way cities are filling up and all. Tell me every spot\nin the country, except for the plains states here, is busting at the\nseams. Same in Europe, Africa, South America. Running out of space,\nrunning out of food, all over the world. This man Leffingwell figures\non cutting down on size so's to keep the whole shebang going.\"\n\n\"But why couldn't it be done on a voluntary basis?\" Bassett demanded.\n\"These arbitrary rulings are bound to result in frustrations. And can\nyou imagine what will happen to the individual family constellations?\nTake a couple that already has two youngsters, as of now. Suppose the\nwife submits to the inoculations for her next child and it's born with\na size-mutation. How in the world will that child survive as a midget\nin a family of giants? There'll be untold damage to the personality--\"\n\n\"We've heard all those arguments,\" Tom Lowery cut in. \"The Naturalists\nhave been handing out that line for years. What happens to the new\ngeneration of kids, how do we know they won't be mentally defective,\nhow can they adjust, by what right does the government interfere with\nprivate lives, personal religious beliefs; all that sort of thing. For\nover ten years now the debate's been going on. And meanwhile, time is\nrunning out. Space is running out. Food is running out. It isn't a\nquestion of individual choice any longer--it's a question of group\nsurvival. I say the Courts are right. We have to go according to law.\nAnd back the law up with force of arms if necessary.\"\n\n\"We get the message,\" Januzki agreed. \"But something tells me there'll\nbe trouble. Most folks need a midget like they need a monkey on their\nbacks.\"\n\n\"It's a gasser, pardners,\" said Nick Kendrick. \"Naturalists don't dig\nthis. They'll fight it all along the line. Everybody's gonna be all\nshook up.\"\n\n\"It is still a good idea,\" Lobo insisted. \"This Dr. Leffingwell, he\nhas made the tests. For years he has given injections and no harm has\ncome. The children are healthy, they survive. They learn in special\nschools--\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Bassett demanded. \"Maybe it's all a lot of\nmotivationalist propaganda.\"\n\n\"We have seen them on the telescreens, no?\"\n\n\"They could be faking the whole thing.\"\n\n\"But Leffingwell, he has offered the shots to other governments beside\nour own. The whole world will adopt them--\"\n\n\"What if some countries don't? What if our kids become midgets and the\nAsiatics refuse the inoculations?\"\n\n\"They won't. They need room even more than we do.\"\n\n\"No sense arguing,\" Emil Grizek concluded. \"It's the law. You know\nthat. And if you don't like it, join the Naturalists.\" He chuckled.\n\"But better hurry. Something tells me there won't be any Naturalists\naround after a couple of years. Now that there's a Leff Law, the\ngovernment isn't likely to stand for too much criticism.\" He turned to\nHarry. \"What do you think?\" he asked.\n\nHarry shrugged. \"No comment,\" he said.\n\nBut the next day he went to Grizek and demanded his pay in full.\n\n\"Leaving?\" Grizek muttered. \"I don't understand. You've been with us\nalmost five years. Where you going, what you intend to do? What's got\ninto you all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"Time for a change,\" Harry told him. \"I've been saving my money.\"\n\n\"Don't I know it? Never touched a penny in all this time.\" Grizek ran\na hand across his chin. \"Say, if it's a raise you're looking for, I\ncan--\"\n\n\"No, thanks. It's not that. I've money enough.\"\n\n\"So you have. Around eighteen, twenty thousand, I reckon, what with\nthe bonuses.\" Emil Grizek sighed. \"Well, if you insist, that's the way\nit's got to be, I suppose. When you plan on taking off?\"\n\n\"Just as soon as there's a 'copter available.\"\n\n\"Got one going up to Colorado Springs tomorrow morning for the mail. I\ncan get you aboard, give you a check--\"\n\n\"I'll want my money in cash.\"\n\n\"Well, now, that isn't so easy. Have to send up for a special draft.\nTake a week or so.\"\n\n\"I can wait.\"\n\n\"All right. And think it over. Maybe you'll decide to change your\nmind.\"\n\nBut Harry didn't change his mind. And ten days later he rode a 'copter\ninto town, his money-belt strapped beneath his safety-belt.\n\nFrom Colorado Springs he jetted to Kancity, and from Kancity to\nMemphisee. As long as he had money, nobody asked any questions. He\nholed up in cheap airtels and waited for developments.\n\nIt wasn't easy to accustom himself to urbanization again. He had been\naway from cities for over seven years now, and it might well have been\nseven centuries. The overpopulation problem was appalling. The\noutlawing of private automotive vehicles had helped, and the clearing\nof the airlanes served a purpose; the widespread increase in the use\nof atomic power cut the smog somewhat. But the synthetic food was\nfrightful, the crowding intolerable, and the welter of rules and\nregulations attending the performance of even the simplest human\nactivity past all his comprehension. Ration cards were in universal\nuse for almost everything; fortunately for Harry, the black market\naccepted cash with no embarrassing inquiries. He found that he could\nsurvive.\n\nBut Harry's interest was not in survival; he was bent upon\ndestruction. Surely the Naturalists would be organized and planning a\nway!\n\nBack in '98, of course, they'd been merely an articulate minority\nwithout formal unity--an abstract, amorphous group akin to the\n\"Liberals\" of previous generations. A Naturalist could be a Catholic\npriest, a Unitarian layman, an atheist factory hand, a government\nemployee, a housewife with strong prejudices against governmental\ncontrols, a wealthy man who deplored the dangers of growing\nindustrialization, an Ag Culture worker who dreaded the dwindling of\nindividual rights, an educator who feared widespread employment of\nsocial psychology, or almost anyone who opposed the concept of Mass\nMan, Mass-Motivated. Naturalists had never formed a single class, a\nsingle political party.\n\nSurely, however, the enactment of the Leffingwell Law would have\nunited them! Harry knew there was strong opposition, not only on the\nhigher levels but amongst the general population. People would be\nafraid of the inoculations; theologians would condemn the process;\neconomic interests, real-estate owners and transportation magnates and\nmanufacturers would sense the threat here. They'd sponsor and they'd\nsubsidize their spokesmen and the Naturalists would evolve into an\nefficient body of opposition.\n\nSo Harry hoped, and so he thought, until he came out into the cities;\ncame out into the cities and realized that the very magnitude of Mass\nMan mitigated against any attempt to organize him, except as a\ncreature who labored and consumed. Organization springs from\ndiscussion, and discussion from thought--but who can think in chaos,\ndiscuss in delirium, organize in a vacuum? And the common citizen,\nHarry realized, had seemingly lost the capacity for group action. He\nremembered his own existence years ago--either he was lost in a crowd\nor he was alone, at home. Firm friendships were rare, and family units\nsurvived on the flimsiest of foundations. It took too much time and\neffort just to follow the rules, follow the traffic, follow the\nincessant routines governing even the simplest life-pattern in the\nteeming cities. For leisure there was the telescreen and the\nyellowjackets, and serious problems could be referred to the psych in\nroutine check-ups. Everybody seemed lost in the crowd these days.\n\nHarry discovered that Dr. Manschoff had indeed lied to him; mental\ndisorders were on the increase. He remembered an old, old book--one of\nthe very first treatises on sociological psychology. _The Lonely\nCrowd_, wasn't it? Full of mumbo-jumbo about \"inner-directed\" and\n\"outer-directed\" personalities. Well, there was a grain of truth in it\nall. The crowd, and its individual members, lived in loneliness. And\nsince you didn't know very many people well enough to talk to,\nintimately, you talked to yourself. Since you couldn't get away from\nphysical contact with others whenever you ventured abroad, you stayed\ninside--except when you had to go to work, had to line up for\nfood-rations or supplies, had to wait for hours for your check-ups on\noff-days. And staying inside meant being confined to the equivalent of\nan old-fashioned prison cell. If you weren't married, you lived in\n\"solitary\"; if you were married, you suffered the presence of\nfellow-inmates whose habits became intolerable, in time. So you\nwatched the screen more and more, or you increased your quota of\nsedation, and when that didn't help you looked for a real escape. It\nwas always available to you if you searched long enough; waiting at\nthe tip of a knife, in the coil of a rope, the muzzle of a gun. You\ncould find it at the very bottom of a bottle of pills or at the very\nbottom of the courtyard outside your window. Harry recalled looking\nfor it there himself, so many years ago.\n\nBut now he was looking for something else. He was looking for others\nwho shared not only his viewpoint but his purposefulness.\n\nWhere were the Naturalists?\n\nHarry searched for several years.\n\n_The press?_\n\nBut there were no Naturalists visible on the telescreens. The news and\nthe newsmakers reflected a national philosophy adopted many\ngenerations ago by the Founding Fathers of mass-communication in their\ninfinite wisdom--\"_What's good for General Motors is good for the\ncountry._\" And according to them, everything happening was good for\nthe country; that was the cardinal precept in the science of\nautobuyology. There were no Arnold Ritchies left any more, and the\nprinted newzine seemed to have vanished.\n\n_The clergy?_\n\nIndividual churches with congregations in physical attendance, seemed\ndifficult to find. Telepreachers still appeared regularly every\nSunday, but their scripts--like everyone else's--had been processed in\nadvance. Denominationalism and sectarianism had waned, too; all of\nthese performers seemed very much alike, in that they were vigorous,\nforthright, inspiring champions of the _status quo_.\n\n_The scientists?_\n\nBut the scientists were a part of the government, and the government\nwas a one-party system, and the system supported the nation and the\nnation supported the scientists. Of course, there were still private\nlaboratories subsidized for industrial purposes, but the men who\nworked in them seemed singularly disinterested in social problems. In\na way, Harry could understand their position. It isn't likely that a\ndedicated scientist, a man whose specialized research has won him a\nNobel Prize for creating a new detergent, will be worldly enough to\nface unpleasant realities beyond the walls of his antiseptic sanctum.\nAfter all, there was precedent for such isolationism--did the sainted\nBetty Crocker ever enlist in any crusades? As for physicians,\npsychiatrists and mass-psychologists, they were the very ones who\nformed the hard core of Leffingwell's support.\n\n_The educators, then?_\n\nVocational Apt was a part of the government. And the poor pedagogues,\nwho had spent generations hacking their way out of the blackboard\njungles, were only too happy to welcome the notion of a coming\nmillennium when their small charges would be still smaller. Even\nthough formal schooling, for most youngsters, terminated at fourteen,\nthere was still the problem of overcrowding. Telescreening and\nteletesting techniques were a help, but the problem was essentially a\nphysical one. And Leffingwell was providing a physical solution.\nBesides, the educators had been themselves educated, through\nVocational Apt. And while they, and the government, fervently upheld\nthe principle of freedom of speech, they had to draw the line\nsomewhere. As everyone knows, freedom of speech does not mean freedom\nto _criticize_.\n\n_Business men?_\n\nPerhaps there were some disgruntled souls in the commercial community,\nwhose secret heroes were the oil tycoons of a bygone era or the\nold-time Stock Exchange clan united under the totems of the bull or\nthe bear. But the day of the rugged individualist was long departed;\nonly the flabby individualist remained. And he had the forms to fill\nout and the inspectors to contend with, and the rationing to worry\nabout and the taxes to meet and the quotas to fulfill. But in the long\nrun, he managed. The business man worked for the government, but the\ngovernment also worked for him. His position was protected. And if the\ngovernment said the Leff Shots would solve the overpopulation\nproblem--_without_ cutting down the number of consumers--well, was\nthat really so bad? Why, in a generation or so there'd be even _more_\ncustomers! That meant increased property values, too.\n\nIt took Harry several years to realize he'd never find Naturalists\norganized for group action. The capacity for group action had vanished\nas the size of the group increased. All interests were interdependent;\nthe old civic, fraternal, social and anti-social societies had no\npresent purpose any more. And the once-familiar rallying-points--whether\nthey represented idealistic humanitarianism or crass self-interest--had\nvanished in the crowd. Patriotism, racialism, unionism, had all been\nlost in a moiling megalopolitanism.\n\nThere were protests, of course. The mothers objected, some of them. Ag\nCulture, in particular, ran into difficulties with women who revived\nthe quaint custom of \"going on strike\" against the Leff Law and\nrefused to take their shots. But it was all on the individual level,\nand quickly coped with. Government medical authorities met the women\nat checkup time and demonstrated that the Leff Law had teeth in it.\nTeeth, and scalpels. The rebellious women were not subdued, slain, or\nsegregated--they were merely sterilized. Perhaps more would have come\nof this if their men had backed them up; but the men, by and large,\nwere realists. Having a kid was a headache these days. This new\nbusiness of injections wasn't so bad, when you came right down to it.\nThere'd still be youngsters around, and you'd get the same allotment\nfor extra living space--only the way it worked out, there'd be more\nroom and the kids would eat less. Pretty good deal. And it wasn't as\nif the young ones were harmed. Some of them seemed to be a lot smarter\nthan ordinary--like on some of the big quizshows, youngsters of eight\nand nine were winning all those big prizes. Bright little ones. Of\ncourse, these must be the ones raised in the first special school the\ngovernment had set up. They said old Leffingwell, the guy who invented\nthe shots, was running it himself. Sort of experimenting to see how\nthis new crop of kids would make out....\n\nIt was when Harry learned about the school that he knew what he must\ndo.\n\nAnd if nobody else would help him, he'd act on his own. There might\nnot be any help from organized society, but he still had disorganized\nsociety to turn to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe spent the next two years and the last of his money finding a way.\nThe pattern of criminality had changed, too, and it was no easy matter\nto find the assistance he needed. About the only group crime still\nflourishing was hijacking; it took him a long while to locate a small\nunder-cover outfit which operated around St. Louie and arrange to\nobtain a helicopter and pilot. Getting hold of the rifle was still\nmore difficult, but he managed. And by the time everything was\nassembled, he'd found out what he needed to know about Dr. Leffingwell\nand his school.\n\nAs he'd suspected, the school was located in the old canyon, right in\nthe same buildings which had once served as experimental units. How\nmany youngsters were there, Harry didn't know. Maybe Manschoff was\nstill on the staff, and maybe they'd brought in a whole new staff.\nThese things didn't matter. What mattered was that Leffingwell was on\nthe premises. And a man who knew his way about, a man who worked alone\nand to a single purpose, could reach him.\n\nThus it was that Harry Collins crouched behind the boulder that bright\nMay morning and waited for Dr. Leffingwell to appear. The helicopter\nhad dropped him at the upper end of the canyon the day before, giving\nhim a chance to reconnoitre and familiarize himself with the terrain\nonce again. He'd located Leffingwell's quarters, even seen the man\nthrough one of the lower windows. Harry had no trouble recognizing\nhim; the face was only too familiar from a thousand 'casts viewed on a\nthousand screens. Inevitably, some time today, he'd emerge from the\nbuilding. And when he did, Harry would be waiting.\n\nHe shifted behind the rocks and stretched his legs. Twelve years had\npassed, and now he'd come full circle. The whole business had started\nhere, and here it must end. That was simple justice.\n\n_And it is justice_, Harry told himself. _It's not revenge._ Because\nthere'd be no point to revenge; that was only melodramatic nonsense.\nHe was no Monte Cristo, come to wreak vengeance on his cruel\noppressors. And he was no madman, no victim of a monomaniacal\nobsession. What he was doing was the result of lengthy and logical\nconsideration.\n\nIf Harry Collins, longtime fugitive from a government treatment\ncenter, tried to take his story to the people, he'd be silenced\nwithout a hearing. But his story must be heard. There was only one way\nto arrest the attention of a nation--with the report of a rifle.\n\nA bullet in Leffingwell's brain; that was the solution of the problem.\nOvernight the assassin would become a national figure. They'd\nundoubtedly try him and undoubtedly condemn him, but first he'd have\nhis day in court. He'd get a chance to speak out. He'd give all the\nvoiceless, unorganized victims of the Leff Law a reason for\nrebellion--and offer them an example. If Leffingwell had to die, it\nwould be in a good cause. Moreover, he deserved to die. Hadn't he\nkilled men, women, infants, without mercy?\n\n_But it's not revenge_, Harry repeated. _And I know what I'm doing.\nMaybe I was disturbed before, but I'm sane now. Perfectly logical.\nPerfectly calm. Perfectly controlled._\n\nYes, and now his sane, logical, calm, controlled eyes noted that the\ndistant door was opening, and he sighted through the 'scope and\nbrought his sane, logical, calm, controlled hand up along the barrel\nto the trigger. He could see the two men emerging, and the shorter,\nplumper of the two was Leffingwell. He squinted at the high forehead\nwith its receding hairline; it was a perfect target. A little squeeze\nnow and he knew what would happen. In his sane, logical, calm,\ncontrolled mind he could visualize the way the black hole would appear\nin the center of that forehead, while behind it would be the torn and\ndripping redness flecked with gray--\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nHarry whirled, staring; staring down at the infant who stood smiling\nbeside him. It _was_ an infant, that was obvious enough, and implicit\nin the diminutive stature, the delicate limbs and the oversized head.\nBut infants do not wear the clothing of pre-adolescent boys, they do\nnot enunciate with clarity, they do not stare coolly and knowingly at\ntheir elders. They do not say, \"Why do you want to harm Dr.\nLeffingwell?\"\n\nHarry gazed into the wide eyes. He couldn't speak.\n\n\"You're sick, aren't you?\" the child persisted. \"Let me call the\ndoctor. He can help you.\"\n\nHarry swung the rifle around. \"I'll give you just ten seconds to clear\nout of here before I shoot.\"\n\nThe child shook his head. Then he took a step forward. \"You wouldn't\nhurt me,\" he said, gravely. \"You're just sick. That's why you talk\nthis way.\"\n\nHarry leveled the rifle. \"I'm not sick,\" he muttered. \"I know what I'm\ndoing. And I know all about you, too. You're one of them, aren't you?\nOne of the first of Leffingwell's brood of illegitimates.\"\n\nThe child took another step forward. \"I'm not illegitimate,\" he said.\n\"I know who I am. I've seen the records. My name is Harry Collins.\"\n\nSomewhere the rifle exploded, the bullet hurtling harmlessly overhead.\nBut Harry didn't hear it. All he could hear, exploding in his own\nbrain as he went down into darkness, was the sane, logical, calm,\ncontrolled voice of his son.\n\n\n\n\n7. Michael Cavendish--2027\n\n\nMike was just coming through the clump of trees when the boy began to\nwave at him. He shifted the clumsy old Jeffrey .475, cursing the\nweight as he quickened his pace. But there was no help for it, he had\nto carry the gun himself. None of the boys were big enough.\n\nHe wondered what it had been like in the old days, when you could get\nfullsized bearers. There used to be game all over the place, too, and\na white hunter was king.\n\nAnd what was there left now? Nothing but pygmies, all of them,\nscurrying around and beating the brush for dibatags and gerenuks. When\nhe was still a boy, Mike had seen the last of the big antelopes go;\nthe last of the wildebeestes and zebra, too. Then the carnivores\nfollowed--the lions and the leopards. _Simba_ was dead, and just as\nwell. These natives would never dare to come out of the villages if\nthey knew any lions were left. Most of them had gone to Cape and the\nother cities anyway; handling cattle was too much of a chore, except\non a government farm. Those cows looked like moving mountains\nalongside the average boy.\n\nOf course there were still some of the older generation left; Kikiyu\nand even a few Watusi. But the free inoculations had begun many years\nago, and the life-cycle moved at an accelerated pace here. Natives\ngrew old and died at thirty; they matured at fifteen. Now, with the\nshortage of game, the elders perished still more swiftly and only the\nyoung remained outside the cities and the farm projects.\n\nMike smiled as he waited for the boy to come up to him. He wasn't\nsmiling at the boy--he was smiling at himself, for being here. He\nought to be in Cape, too, or Kenyarobi. Damned silly, this business of\nbeing a white hunter, when there was nothing left to hunt.\n\nBut somehow he'd stayed on, since Dad died. There were a few\ncompensations. At least here in the forests a man could still move\nabout a bit, taste privacy and solitude and the strange, exotic\ntropical fruit called loneliness. Even _that_ was vanishing today.\n\nIt was compensation enough, perhaps, for lugging this damned Jeffrey.\nMike tried to remember the last time he'd fired it at a living target.\nA year, two years? Yes, almost two. That gorilla up in Ruwenzori\ncountry. At least the boys swore it was _ingagi_. He hadn't hit it,\nanyway. Got away in the darkness. Probably he'd been shooting at a\nshadow. There were no more gorillas--maybe _they_ had been taking the\nshots, too. Perhaps they'd all turned into rhesus monkeys.\n\nMike watched the boy run towards him. It was a good five hundred yards\nfrom the river bank, and the short brown legs couldn't move very\nswiftly. He wondered what it felt like to be small. One's sense of\nproportion must be different. And that, in turn, would affect one's\nsense of values. What values applied to the world about you when you\nwere only three feet high?\n\nMike wouldn't know. He was a big man--almost five feet seven.\n\nSometimes Mike reflected on what things might be like if he'd been\nborn, say, twenty years later. By that time almost everyone would be a\nproduct of Leff shots, and he'd be no exception. He might stay with\npeople his own age in Kenyarobi without feeling self-conscious,\nclumsy, conspicuous. Pressed, he had to admit that was part of the\nreason he preferred to remain out here at Dad's old place now. He\ncould tolerate the stares of the natives, but whenever he ventured\ninto a city he felt awkward under the scrutiny of the young people.\nThe way those teen-agers looked up at him made him feel a monster,\nrather.\n\nBetter to endure the monotony, the emptiness out here. Yes, and wait\nfor a chance to hunt. Even though, nine times out of ten, it turned\nout to be a wild goose-chase. During the past year or so Mike had\nhunted nothing but legends and rumors, spent his time stalking\nshadows.\n\nThen the villagers had come to him, three days ago, with their wild\nstory. Even when he heard it, he realized it must be pure fable. And\nthe more they insisted, the more they protested, the more he realized\nit simply couldn't be.\n\nStill, he'd come. Anything to experience some action, anything to\ncreate the illusion of purpose, of--\n\n\"_Tembo!_\" shrieked the boy, excited beyond all pretense of caution.\n\"Up ahead, in river. You come quick, you see!\"\n\nNo. It couldn't be. The government surveys were thorough. The last\nrecord of a specimen dated back over a half-dozen years ago. It was\nimpossible that any survivors remained. And all during the safari\nthese past days, not a sign or a print or a spoor.\n\n\"_Tembo!_\" shrilled the boy. \"Come quick!\"\n\nMike cradled the gun and started forward. The other bearers shuffled\nbehind him, unable to keep pace because of their short legs and--he\nsuspected--unwilling to do so for fear of what might lie ahead.\n\nHalfway towards the river bank, Mike halted. Now he could hear the\nrumbling, the unmistakable rumbling. And now he could smell the rank\nmustiness borne on the hot breeze. Well, at least he was down-wind.\n\nThe boy behind him trembled, eyes wide. He _had_ seen something, all\nright. Maybe just a crocodile, though. Still some crocs around. And he\ndoubted if a young native would know the difference.\n\nNevertheless, Mike felt a sudden surge of unfamiliar excitement, half\nexpectancy and half fear. _Something_ wallowed in the river; something\nthat rumbled and exuded the stench of life.\n\nNow they were approaching the trees bordering the bank. Mike checked\nhis gun carefully. Then he advanced until his body was aligned with\nthe trees. From here he could see and not be seen. He could peer down\nat the river--or the place where the river had been, during the rainy\nseason long past. Now it was nothing but a mudwallow under the glaring\nsun; a huge mudwallow, pitted with deep, circular indentations and\ndotted with dung.\n\nBut in the middle of it stood _tembo_.\n\n_Tembo_ was a mountain, _tembo_ was a black block of breathing basalt.\n_Tembo_ roared and snorted and rolled red eyes.\n\nMike gasped.\n\nHe was a white hunter, but he'd never seen a bull elephant before. And\nthis one stood eleven feet at the shoulders if it stood an inch; the\nbiggest creature walking the face of the earth.\n\nIt had risen from the mud, abandoned its wallowing as its trunk curled\nabout, sensitive to the unfamiliar scent of man. Its ears rose like\nthe outspread wings of some gigantic jungle bat. Mike could see the\nflies buzzing around the ragged edges. He stared at the great tusks\nthat were veined and yellowed and broken--once men had hunted\nelephants for ivory, he remembered.\n\nBut how could they? Even with guns, how had they dared to confront a\nmoving mountain? Mike tried to swallow, but his throat was dry. The\nstock slipped through his clammy hands.\n\n\"Shoot!\" implored the boy beside him. \"You shoot, now!\"\n\nMike gazed down. The elephant was aware of him. It turned\ndeliberately, staring up the bank as it swayed on the four black\npillars of its legs. Mike could see its eyes, set in a mass of grayish\nwrinkles. The eyes had recognized him.\n\nThey knew, he realized. The eyes knew all about him; who he was and\nwhat he was and what he had come here to do. The eyes had seen man\nbefore--perhaps long before Mike was born. They understood everything;\nthe gun and the presence and the purpose.\n\n\"Shoot!\" the boy cried, not bothering to hold his voice down any\nlonger. For the elephant was moving slowly towards the side of the\nwallow, moving deliberately to firmer footing, and the boy was afraid.\nMike was afraid, too, but he couldn't shoot.\n\n\"No,\" he murmured. \"Let him go. I can't kill him.\"\n\n\"You must,\" the boy said. \"You promise. Look--all the meat. Meat for\ntwo, three villages.\"\n\nMike shook his head. \"I can't do it,\" he said. \"That isn't meat.\nThat's life. Bigger life than we are. Don't you understand? Oh, the\nbloody hell with it! Come on.\"\n\nThe boy wasn't listening to him. He was watching the elephant. And now\nhe started to tremble.\n\nFor the elephant was moving up onto solid ground. It moved slowly,\ndaintily, almost mincing as its legs sampled the surface of the shore.\nThen it looked up and this time there was no doubt as to the direction\nof its gaze--it stared intently at Mike and the boy on the bank. Its\nears fanned, then flared. Suddenly the elephant raised its trunk and\ntrumpeted fiercely.\n\nAnd then, lowering the black battering-ram of its head, the beast came\nforward. A deceptively slow lope, a scarcely accelerated trot, and\nthen all at once it was moving swiftly, swiftly and surely and\ninexorably towards them. The angle of the bank was not steep and the\nelephant's speed never slackened on the slope. Its right shoulder\nstruck a sapling and the sapling splintered. It was crashing forward\nin full charge. Again it trumpeted, trunk extended like a flail of\ndoom.\n\n\"Shoot!\" screamed the boy.\n\nMike didn't want to shoot. He wanted to run. He wanted to flee the\nmountain, flee the incredible breathing bulk of this grotesque giant.\nBut he was a white hunter, he was a man, and a man is not a beast; a\nman does not run away from life in any shape or size.\n\nThe trunk came up. Mike raised the gun. He heard the monster roar, far\naway, and then he heard another sound that must be the gun's\ndischarge, and something hit him in the shoulder and knocked him down.\nRecoil? Yes, because the elephant wasn't there any more; he could hear\nthe crashing and thrashing down below, over the rim of the river bank.\n\nMike stood up. He saw the boy running now, running back to the bearers\nhuddled along the edge of the trail.\n\nHe rubbed his shoulder, picked up his gun, reloaded. The sounds from\nbelow had ceased. Slowly, Mike advanced to the lip of the bank and\nstared down.\n\nThe bull elephant had fallen and rolled into the wallow once more. It\nhad taken a direct hit, just beneath the right ear, and even as Mike\nwatched, its trunk writhed feebly like a dying serpent, then fell\nforward into the mud. The gigantic ears twitched, then flickered and\nflopped, and the huge body rolled and settled.\n\nSuddenly Mike began to cry.\n\nDamn it, he hadn't _wanted_ to shoot. If the elephant hadn't charged\nlike that--\n\nBut the elephant _had_ to charge. Just as he _had_ to shoot. That was\nthe whole secret. The secret of life. And the secret of death, too.\n\nMike turned away, facing the east. Kenyarobi was east, and he'd be\ngoing there now. Nothing to hold him here in the forests any longer.\nHe wouldn't even wait for the big feast. To hell with elephant-meat,\nanyway. His hunting days were over.\n\nMike walked slowly up the trail to the waiting boys.\n\nAnd behind him, in the wallow, the flies settled down on the lifeless\ncarcass of the last elephant in the world.\n\n\n\n\n8. Harry Collins--2029\n\n\nThe guards at Stark Falls were under strict orders not to talk. Each\nprisoner here was exercised alone in a courtyard runway, and meals\nwere served in the cells. The cells were comfortable enough, and while\nthere were no telescreens, books were available--genuine, old-style\nbooks which must have been preserved from libraries dismantled fifty\nyears ago or more. Harry Collins found no titles dated later than\n1975. Every day or so an attendant wheeled around a cart piled high\nwith the dusty volumes. Harry read to pass the time.\n\nAt first he kept anticipating his trial, but after a while he almost\nforgot about that possibility. And it was well over a year before he\ngot a chance to tell his story to anyone.\n\nWhen his opportunity came, his audience did not consist of judge or\njury, doctor, lawyer or penologist. He spoke only to Richard Wade, a\nfellow-prisoner who had been thrust into the adjoining cell on the\nevening of October 11th, 2013.\n\nHarry spoke haltingly at first, but as he progressed the words came\nmore easily, and emotion lent its own eloquence. His unseen auditor on\nthe other side of the wall did not interrupt or question him; it was\nenough, for Harry, that there _was_ someone to listen at last.\n\n\"So it wasn't a bit like I'd expected,\" he concluded. \"No trial, no\npublicity. I've never seen Leffingwell again, nor Manschoff. Nobody\nquestioned me. By the time I recovered consciousness, I was here in\nprison. Buried alive.\"\n\nRichard Wade spoke slowly, for the first time. \"You're lucky. They\nmight have shot you down on the spot.\"\n\n\"That's just what bothers me,\" Harry told him. \"Why didn't they kill\nme? Why lock me up _incommunicado_ this way? There aren't many prisons\nleft these days, with food and space at such a premium.\"\n\n\"There are _no_ prisons left at all--officially,\" Wade said. \"Just as\nthere are no longer any cemeteries. But important people are still\ngiven private burials and their remains secretly preserved. All a\nmatter of influence.\"\n\n\"I've no influence. I'm not important. Wouldn't you think they'd\nconsider it risky to keep me alive, under the circumstances? If\nthere'd ever be an investigation--\"\n\n\"Who would investigate? Not the government, surely.\"\n\n\"But suppose there's a political turnover. Suppose Congress want to\nmake capital of the situation?\"\n\n\"There is no Congress.\"\n\nHarry gasped. \"No Congress?\"\n\n\"As of last month. It was dissolved. Henceforth we are governed by the\nCabinet, with authority delegated to department heads.\"\n\n\"But that's preposterous! Nobody'd stand still for something like\nthat!\"\n\n\"They did stand still, most of them. After a year of careful\npreparation--of wholesale _exposes_ of Congressional graft and\ncorruption and inefficiency. Turned out that Congress was the villain\nall along; the Senators and Representatives had finagled\ntariff-barriers and restrictive trade-agreements which kept our food\nsupply down. They were opposing international federation. In plain\nlanguage, people were sold a bill of goods--get rid of Congress and\nyou'll have more food. That did it.\"\n\n\"But you'd think the politicians themselves would realize they were\ncutting their own throats! The state legislatures and the governors--\"\n\n\"Legislatures were dissolved by the same agreement,\" Wade went on.\n\"There are no states any more; just governmental districts. Based upon\nsensible considerations of area and population. This isn't the\nold-time expanding economy based on obsolescence and conspicuous\nconsumption. The primary problem at the moment is sheer survival. In\na way, the move makes sense. Old-fashioned political machinery\ncouldn't cope with the situation; there's no time for debate when\ninstantaneous decisions are necessary to national welfare. You've\nheard how civil liberties were suspended during the old wars. Well,\nthere's a war on right now; a war against hunger, a war against the\nforces of fecundity. In another dozen years or so, when the Leff shot\ngeneration is fullgrown and a lot of the elderly have died off, the\ntensions will ease. Meanwhile, quick action is necessary. Arbitrary\naction.\"\n\n\"But you're defending dictatorship!\"\n\nRichard Wade made a sound which is usually accompanied by a derisive\nshrug. \"Am I? Well, I didn't when I was outside. And that's why I'm\nhere now.\"\n\nHarry Collins cleared his throat. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"If you refer to my profession, I was a scripter. If you refer to my\nalleged criminal activity, I made the error of thinking the way you\ndo, and the worse error of attempting to inject such attitudes in my\nscripts. Seems that when Congress was formally dissolved, there was\nsome notion of preparing a timely show--a sort of historical review of\nthe body, using old film clips. What my superiors had in mind was a\ncomedy of errors; a cavalcade of mistakes and misdeeds showing just\nwhy we were better off without supporting a political sideshow. Well,\nI carried out the assignment and edited the films, but when I drafted\na rough commentary, I made the mistake of taking both a pro and con\nslant. Nothing like that ever reached the telescreens, of course, but\nwhat I did was promptly noted. They came for me at once and hustled me\noff here. I didn't get a hearing or a trial, either.\"\n\n\"But why didn't they execute you? Or--\" Harry hesitated--\"is that what\nyou expect?\"\n\n\"Why didn't they execute _you_?\" Wade shot back. He was silent for a\nmoment before continuing. \"No, I don't expect anything like that, now.\nThey'd have done it on the spot if they intended to do so at all. No,\nI've got another idea about people like you and myself. And about some\nof the Congressmen and Senators who dropped out of sight, too. I think\nwe're being stockpiled.\"\n\n\"Stockpiled?\"\n\n\"It's all part of a plan. Give me a little time to think. We can talk\nagain, later.\" Wade chuckled once more. \"Looks as if there'll be ample\nopportunity in the future.\"\n\nAnd there was. In the months ahead, Harry spoke frequently with his\nfriend behind the wall. He never saw him--prisoners at Stark Falls\nwere exercised separately, and there was no group assembly or\nrecreation. Surprisingly adequate meals were served in surprisingly\ncomfortable cells. In the matter of necessities, Harry had no\ncomplaints. And now that he had someone to talk to, the time seemed to\ngo more swiftly.\n\nHe learned a great deal about Richard Wade during the next few years.\nMostly, Wade liked to reminisce about the old days. He talked about\nworking for the networks--the _commercial_ networks, privately owned,\nwhich flourished before the government took over communications media\nin the '80s.\n\n\"That's where you got your start, eh?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Lord, no, boy! I'm a lot more ancient than you think. Why, I'm\npushing sixty-five. Born in 1940. That's right, during World War II. I\ncan almost remember the atomic bomb, and I sure as hell remember the\nsputniks. It was a crazy period, let me tell you. The pessimists\nworried about the Russians blowing us up, and the optimists were sure\nwe had a glorious future in the conquest of space. Ever hear that old\nfable about the blind men examining an elephant? Well, that's the way\nmost people were; each of them groping around and trying to determine\nthe exact shape of things to come. A few of us even made a little\nmoney from it for a while, writing science fiction. That's how I got\nmy start.\"\n\n\"You were a writer?\"\n\n\"Sold my first story when I was eighteen or so. Kept on writing off\nand on for almost twenty years. Of course, Robertson's thermo-nuc\nformula came along in '75, and after that everything went to pot. It\nknocked out the chances of future war, but it also knocked out the\ninterest in speculation or escape-fiction. So I moved over into\ntelevision for a while, and stayed with it. But the old science\nfiction was fun while it lasted. Ever read any of it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harry admitted. \"That was all before my time. Tell me,\nthough--did any of it make sense? I mean, did some of those writers\nforesee what was really going to happen?\"\n\n\"There were plenty of penny prophets and nickel Nostradamuses,\" Wade\ntold him. \"But as I said, most of them were assuming war with the\nCommunists or a new era of space travel. Since Communism collapsed and\nspace flight was just an expensive journey to a dead end and dead\nworlds, it follows that the majority of fictional futures were founded\non fallacies. And all the rest of the extrapolations dealt with\nsuperficial social manifestations.\n\n\"For example, they wrote about civilizations dominated by advertising\nand mass-motivation techniques. It's true that during my childhood\nthis seemed to be a logical trend--but once demand exceeded supply,\nthe whole mechanism of _stimulating_ demand, which was advertising's\nchief function, bogged down. And mass-motivation techniques, today,\nare dedicated almost entirely to maintaining minimum resistance to a\nsystem insuring our survival.\n\n\"Another popular idea was based on the notion of an expanding\nmatriarchy--a gerontomatriarchy, rather, in which older women would\ntake control. In an age when women outlived men by a number of years,\nthis seemed possible. Now, of course, shortened working hours and\nmedical advances have equalized the life-span. And since private\nproperty has become less and less of a factor in dominating our\ncollective destinies, it hardly matters whether the male or the female\nhas the upper hand.\n\n\"Then there was the common theory that technological advances would\nresult in a push-button society, where automatons would do all the\nwork. And so they might--if we had an unlimited supply of raw\nmaterials to produce robots, and unlimited power-sources to activate\nthem. As we now realize, atomic power cannot be utilized on a minute\nscale.\n\n\"Last, but not least, there was the concept of a medically-orientated\nsystem, with particular emphasis on psychotherapy, neurosurgery, and\nparapsychology. The world was going to be run by telepaths, psychosis\neliminated by brainwashing, intellect developed by hypnotic\nsuggestion. It sounded great--but the conquest of physical disease has\noccupied the medical profession almost exclusively.\n\n\"No, what they all seemed to overlook, with only a few exceptions, was\nthe population problem. You can't run a world through advertising when\nthere are so many people that there aren't enough goods to go around\nanyway. You can't turn it over to big business when big government has\nvirtually absorbed all of the commercial and industrial functions,\njust to cope with an ever-growing demand. A matriarchy loses its\nmeaning when the individual family unit changes character, under the\nstress of an increasing population-pressure which eliminates the\nold-fashioned home, family circle, and social pattern. And the more we\nmust conserve dwindling natural resources for people, the less we can\nexpend on experimentation with robots and machinery. As for the\npsychologist-dominated society, there are just too many patients and\nnot enough physicians. I don't have to remind you that the military\ncaste lost its chance of control when war disappeared, and that\nreligion is losing ground every day. Class-lines are vanishing, and\nracial distinctions will be going next. The old idea of a World\nFederation is becoming more and more practical. Once the political\nbarriers are down, miscegenation will finish the job. But nobody\nseemed to foresee this particular future. They all made the mistake of\nworrying about the hydrogen-bomb instead of the sperm-bomb.\"\n\nHarry nodded thoughtfully, although Wade couldn't see his response.\n\"But isn't it true that there's a little bit of each of these concepts\nin our actual situation today?\" he asked. \"I mean, government and\nbusiness _are_ virtually one and the same, and they do use propaganda\ntechniques to control all media. As for scientific research, look at\nhow we've rebuilt our cities and developed synthetics for food and\nfuel and clothing and shelter. When it comes to medicine, there's\nLeffingwell and his inoculations. Isn't that all along the lines of\nyour early science fiction?\"\n\n\"Where's your Underground?\" Richard Wade demanded.\n\n\"My _what_?\"\n\n\"Your Underground,\" Wade repeated. \"Hell, every science fiction yarn\nabout a future society had its Underground! That was the whole gimmick\nin the plot. The hero was a conformist who tangled with the social\norder--come to think of it, that's what _you_ did, years ago. Only\ninstead of becoming an impotent victim of the system, he'd meet up\nwith the Underground Movement. Not some sourball like your friend\nRitchie, who tried to operate on his own hook, without real plans or\nsystem, but a complete _sub rosa_ organization, bent on starting a\nrevolution and taking over. There'd be wise old priests and wise old\ncrooks and wise old officers and wise old officials, all playing a\ndouble game and planning a _coup_. Spies all over the place, get me?\nAnd in no time at all, our hero would be playing tag with the top\nfigures in the government. That's how it worked out in all the\nstories.\n\n\"But what happens in real life? What happened to you, for example? You\nfell for a series of stupid tricks, stupidly perpetrated--because the\npeople in power _are_ people, and not the kind of synthetic\nsuper-intellects dreamed up by frustrated fiction-fabricators. You\nfound out that the logical candidates to constitute an Underground\nwere the Naturalists; again, they were just ordinary individuals with\nno genius for organization. As for coming in contact with key figures,\nyou were actually on hand when Leffingwell completed his experiments.\nAnd you came back, years later, to hunt him down. Very much in the\nheroic tradition, I admit. But you never saw the man except through\nthe telescopic sights of your rifle. That was the end of it. No\nmodern-day Machiavelli has hauled you in to play cat-and-mouse games\nwith you, and no futuristic Freud has bothered to wash your brain or\nsoft-soap your subconscious. You just aren't that important, Collins.\"\n\n\"But they put me in a special prison. Why?\"\n\n\"Who knows? They put me here, too.\"\n\n\"You said something once, about stockpiling us. What did you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, it was just an old science fiction idea, I suppose. I'll tell\nyou about it tomorrow, eh?\"\n\nAnd so the matter--and Harry Collins--rested for the night.\n\nThe next day Richard Wade was gone.\n\nHarry called to him and there was no answer. And he cried out and he\ncursed and he paced his cell and he walked alone in the courtyard and\nhe begged the impassive guards for information, and he sweated and he\ntalked to himself and he counted the days and he lost count of the\ndays.\n\nThen, all at once, there was another prisoner in the adjacent cell,\nand his name was William Chang, and he was a biologist. He was\nreticent about the crime he had committed, but quite voluble about the\ncrimes committed by others in the world outside. Much of what he said,\nabout genes and chromosomes and recessive characteristics and\nmutation, seemed incomprehensible to Harry. But in their talks, one\nthing emerged clearly enough--Chang was concerned for the future of\nthe race. \"Leffingwell should have waited,\" he said. \"It's the\n_second_ generation that will be important. As I tried to tell my\npeople--\"\n\n\"Is that why you're here?\"\n\nChang sighed. \"I suppose so. They wouldn't listen, of course.\nOverpopulation has always been the curse of Asia, and this seemed to\nbe such an obvious solution. But who knows? The time may come when\nthey need men like myself.\"\n\n\"So you were stockpiled too.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nHarry told him about Richard Wade's remarks, and together they tried\nto puzzle out the theory behind them.\n\nBut not for long. Because once again Harry Collins awoke in the\nmorning to find the adjoining cell empty, and once again he was alone\nfor a long time.\n\nAt last a new neighbor came. His name was Lars Neilstrom. Neilstrom\ntalked to him of ships and shoes and sealing-wax and the thousand and\none things men will discuss in their loneliness and frustration,\nincluding--inevitably--their reasons for being here.\n\nNeilstrom had been an instructor under Vocational Apt, and he was at a\nloss to explain his presence at Stark Falls. When Harry spoke of the\nstockpiling theory, his fellow-prisoner demurred. \"It's more like\nKafka than science fiction,\" he said. \"But then, I don't suppose\nyou've ever read any Kafka.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Harry told him. \"Since I came here I've done nothing\nbut read old books. Lately they've been giving me microscans. I've\nbeen studying up on biology and genetics; talking to Chang got me\ninterested. In fact, I'm really going in for self-education. There's\nnothing else to do.\"\n\n\"Self-education! That's the only method left nowadays.\" Neilstrom\nsounded bitter. \"I don't know what's going to become of our heritage\nof knowledge in the future. I'm not speaking of technological skill;\nso-called scientific information is carefully preserved. But the\nhumanities are virtually lost. The concept of the well-rounded\nindividual is forgotten. And when I think of the crisis to come--\"\n\n\"What crisis?\"\n\n\"A new generation is growing up. Ten or fifteen years from now we'll\nhave succeeded in erasing political and racial and religious\ndivisions. But there'll be a new and more dangerous differentiation; a\n_physical_ one. What do you think will happen when half the world is\naround six feet tall and the other half under three?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine.\"\n\n\"Well, I can. The trouble is, most people don't realize what the\nproblem will be. Things have moved too swiftly. Why, there were more\nchanges in the last hundred years than in the previous thousand! And\nthe rate of acceleration increases. Up until now, we've been concerned\nabout too rapid technological development. But what we have to worry\nabout is social development.\"\n\n\"Most people have been conditioned to conform.\"\n\n\"Yes. That's our job in Vocational Apt. But the system only works when\nthere's a single standard of conformity. In a few years there'll be a\ndouble one, based on size. What then?\"\n\nHarry wanted some time to consider the matter, but the question was\nnever answered. Because Lars Neilstrom went away in the night, as had\nhis predecessors before him. And in succeeding interludes, Harry came\nto know a half-dozen other transient occupants of the cell next to\nhis. They came from all over, and they had many things to discuss, but\nalways there was the problem of _why_ they were there--and the memory\nof Richard Wade's premise concerning stockpiling.\n\nThere came a time when the memory of Richard Wade merged with the\nmemory of Arnold Ritchie. The past was a dim montage of life at the\nagency and the treatment center and the ranch, a recollection of lying\non the river bank with women in attitudes of opisthotonos or of lying\nagainst the boulders with a rifle.\n\nSomewhere there was an image of a child's wide eyes and a voice\nsaying, \"My name is Harry Collins.\" But that seemed very far away.\nWhat was real was the cell and the years of talking and reading the\nmicroscans and trying to find a pattern.\n\nHarry found himself describing it all to a newcomer who said his name\nwas Austin--a soft-voiced man who became a resident of the next cell\none day in 2029. And eventually he came to Wade's theory.\n\n\"Maybe there were a few wiser heads who foresaw a coming crisis,\" he\nconcluded. \"Maybe they anticipated a time when they might need a few\nnonconformists. People like ourselves who haven't been passive or\npersuaded. Maybe we're the government's insurance policy. If an\nemergency arises, we'll be freed.\"\n\n\"And then what would _you_ do?\" Austin asked, softly. \"You're against\nthe system, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I'm _for_ survival.\" Harry Collins spoke slowly,\nthoughtfully. \"You see, I've learned something through the years of\nstudy and contact here. Rebellion is not the answer.\"\n\n\"You hated Leffingwell.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, until I realized that all this was inevitable.\nLeffingwell is not a villain and neither is any given individual, in\nor out of government. Our road to hell has been paved with only the\nvery best of intentions. Killing the engineers and contractors will\nnot get us off that road, and we're all on it together. We'll have to\nfind a way of changing the direction of our journey. The young people\nwill be too anxious to merely rush blindly ahead. Most of my\ngeneration will be sheeplike, moving as part of the herd, because of\ntheir conditioning. Only we old-time rebels will be capable of\nplotting a course. A course for all of us.\"\n\n\"What about your son?\" Austin asked.\n\n\"I'm thinking of him,\" Harry Collins answered. \"Of him, and of all the\nothers. Maybe he does not need me. Maybe none of them need me. Maybe\nit's all an illusion. But if the time ever comes, I'll be ready. And\nmeanwhile, I can hope.\"\n\n\"The time has come,\" Austin said, gently.\n\nAnd then he was standing, miraculously enough, outside his cell and\nbefore the door to Harry's cell, and the door was opening. And once\nagain Harry stared into the wide eyes he remembered so well--the same\nwide eyes, set in the face of a fullgrown man. A fullgrown man, three\nfeet tall. He stood up, shakily, as the man held out his hand and\nsaid, \"Hello, Father.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand--\"\n\n\"I've waited a long time for this moment. I had to talk to you, find\nout how you really felt, so that I'd be sure. Now you're ready to join\nus.\"\n\n\"What's happening? What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"We'll talk later.\" Harry's son smiled. \"Right now, I'm taking you\nhome.\"\n\n\n\n\n9. Eric Donovan--2031\n\n\nEric was glad to get to the office and shut the door. Lately he'd had\nthis feeling whenever he went out, this feeling that people were\nstaring at him. It wasn't just his imagination: they did stare. Every\nyounger person over a yard high got stared at nowadays, as if they\nwere freaks. And it wasn't just the staring that got him down, either.\n\nSometimes they muttered and mumbled, and sometimes they called names.\nEric didn't mind stuff like \"dirty Naturalist.\" That he could\nunderstand--once upon a time, way back, everybody who was against the\nLeff Law was called a Naturalist. And before that it had still another\nmeaning, or so he'd been told. Today, of course, it just meant anyone\nwho was over five feet tall.\n\nNo, he could take the ordinary name-calling, all right. But sometimes\nthey said other things. They used words nobody ever uses unless they\nreally hate you, want to kill you. And that was at the bottom of it,\nEric knew. They did hate him, they _did_ want to kill him.\n\nWas he a coward? Perhaps. But it wasn't just Eric's imagination. You\nnever saw anything about such things on the telescreens, but\nNaturalists were being killed every day. The older people were still\nin the majority, but the youngsters were coming up fast. And there\nwere so many _more_ of them. Besides, they were more active, and this\ncreated the illusion that there were Yardsticks everywhere.\n\nEric sat down behind his desk, grinning. _Yardsticks._ When he was a\nkid it had been just the other way around. He and the rest of them who\ndidn't get shots in those early days considered themselves to be the\nnormal ones. And _they_ did the name-calling. Names like \"runt\" and\n\"half-pint\" and \"midgie.\" But the most common name was the one that\nstuck--Yardstick. That used to be the worst insult of all.\n\nBut now it wasn't an insult any more. Being taller was the insult.\nBeing a dirty Naturalist or a son-of-a-Naturalist. Times certainly had\nchanged.\n\nEric glanced at the communicator. Almost noon, and it had not flicked\nyet. Here he'd been beaming these big offers, you'd think he'd get\nsome response to an expensive beaming program, but no. Maybe that was\nthe trouble--nobody liked _big_ things any more. Everything was small.\n\nHe shifted uneasily in his chair. That was one consolation, at least;\nhe still had old-time furniture. Getting to be harder and harder to\nfind stuff that fitted him these days. Seemed like most of the firms\nmaking furniture and bedding and household appliances were turning out\nthe small stuff for the younger generation. Cheaper to make, less\nmaterial, and more demand for it. Government allocated size priorities\nto the manufacturers.\n\nIt was even murder to ride public transportation because of the\nspace-reductions. Eric drove his own jetter. Besides, that way was\nsafer. Crowded into a liner with a gang of Yardsticks, with only a few\nother Naturalists around, there might be trouble.\n\nOh, it was getting to be a Yardstick world, and no mistake. Smaller\nfurniture, smaller meals, smaller sizes in clothing, smaller\nbuildings--\n\nThat reminded Eric of something and he frowned again. Dammit, why\ndidn't the communicator flick? He should be getting some kind of\ninquiries. Hell, he was practically _giving_ the space away!\n\nBut there was only silence, as there had been all during this past\nweek. That's why he let Lorette go. Sweet girl, but there was no work\nfor her here any more. No work, and no pay, either. Besides, the place\nspooked her. She'd been the one who suggested leaving, really.\n\n\"Eric, I'm sorry, but I just can't take this any more. All alone in\nthis huge building--it's curling my toes!\"\n\nAt first he tried to talk her out of it. \"Don't be silly, luscious!\nThere's Bernstein, down on ten, and Saltonstall above us, and Wallaby\nand Son on fourteen, I tell you, this place is coming back to life, I\ncan feel it! I'll beam for tenants next week, you'll see--\"\n\nActually he'd been talking against his own fear and Lorette must have\nknown it. Anyway, she left. And now he was here alone.\n\n_Alone._\n\nEric didn't like the sound of that word. Or the absence of sound\nbehind it. Three other tenants in a ninety-story building. Three other\ntenants in a place that had once held three thousand. Why, fifty years\nago, when this place went up, you couldn't buy a vacancy. Where had\nthe crowds gone to?\n\nHe knew the answer, of course. The Leff shots had created the new\ngeneration of Yardsticks, and they lived in their own world. Their\nshrunken, dehydrated world of doll-houses and miniatures. They'd\ndeserted the old-fashioned skyscrapers and cut the big apartment\nbuildings up into tiny cubicles; two could occupy the space formerly\nreserved for one.\n\nThat had been the purpose of the Leff shots in the first place--to put\nan end to overcrowding and conserve on resources. Well, it had worked\nout. Worked out too perfectly for people like Eric Donovan. Eric\nDonovan, rental agent for a building nobody wanted any more; a\nninety-storey mausoleum. And nobody could collect rent from ghosts.\n\n_Ghosts._\n\nEric damned near jumped through the ceiling when the door opened and\nthis man walked in. He was tall and towheaded. Eric stared; there was\nsomething vaguely familiar about his face. Something about those ears,\nthat was it, those ears. No, it couldn't be, it wasn't possible--\n\nEric stood up and held out his hand. \"I'm Donovan,\" he said.\n\nThe towheaded man smiled and nodded. \"Yes, I know. Don't you remember\nme?\"\n\n\"I thought I knew you from someplace. You wouldn't be--Sam Wolzek?\"\n\nThe towheaded man's smile became a broad grin. \"That's not what you\nwere going to say, Eric. You were going to say 'Handle-head,' weren't\nyou? Well, go on, say it. I don't mind. I've been called a lot worse\nthings since we were kids together.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Eric murmured. \"It's really you! Old Handle-head\nWolzek! And after all these years, turning up to rent an office from\nme. Well, what do you know!\"\n\n\"I didn't come here to rent an office.\"\n\n\"Oh? Then--\"\n\n\"It was your name that brought me. I recognized it on the beamings.\"\n\n\"Then this is a social call, eh? Well, that's good. I don't get much\ncompany these days. Sit down, have a reef.\"\n\nWolzek sat down but refused the smoke. \"I know quite a bit about your\nsetup,\" he said. \"You and your three tenants. It's tough, Eric.\"\n\n\"Oh, things could be worse.\" Eric forced a laugh. \"It isn't as if my\nbucks depended on the number of tenants in the building. Government\nsubsidizes this place. I'm sure of a job as long as I live.\"\n\n\"As long as you live.\" Wolzek stared at him in a way he didn't like.\n\"And just how long do you figure that to be?\"\n\n\"I'm only twenty-six,\" Eric answered. \"According to statistics, that\ngives me maybe another sixty years.\"\n\n\"Statistics!\" Wolzek said it like a dirty word. \"Your life-expectancy\nisn't determined by statistics any more. I say you don't have sixty\nmonths left. Perhaps not even sixty days.\"\n\n\"What are you trying to hand me?\"\n\n\"The truth. And don't go looking for a silver platter underneath it,\neither.\"\n\n\"But I mind my own business. I don't hurt anybody. Why should I be in\nany danger?\"\n\n\"Why does a government subsidy support one rental manager to sit here\nin this building every day--but ten guards to patrol it every night?\"\n\nEric opened his mouth wide before shaping it for speech. \"Who told you\nthat?\"\n\n\"Like I said, I know the setup.\" Wolzek crossed his legs, but he\ndidn't lean back. \"And in case you haven't guessed it, this is a\nbusiness call, not a social one.\"\n\nEric sighed. \"Might have figured,\" he said. \"You're a Naturalist,\naren't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I am. We all are.\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--whether you like it or not, you're a Naturalist, too. As far\nas the Yardsticks are concerned, everyone over three feet high is a\nNaturalist. An enemy. Someone to be hated, and destroyed.\"\n\n\"Think I'd believe that? Sure, I know they don't like us, and why\nshould they? We eat twice as much, take up twice the space, and I\nguess when we were kids we gave a lot of them a hard time. Besides,\noutside of a few exceptions like ourselves, all the younger generation\nare Yardsticks, with more coming every year. The older people hold\nthe key positions and the power. Of course there's a lot of friction\nand resentment. But you know all that.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Wolzek nodded. \"All that and more. Much more. I know that\nup until a few years ago, no Yardstick held any public office or\ngovernment position. Now they're starting to move in, particularly in\nEuropasia. But there's so many of them now--adults, in their early\ntwenties--that the pressure is building up. They're impatient, getting\nout of hand. They won't wait until the old folks die off. They want\ncontrol now. And if they ever manage to get it, we're finished for\ngood.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" Eric said.\n\n\"Impossible?\" Wolzek's voice was a mocking echo. \"You sit here in this\ntomb and when somebody tells you that the world you know has died, you\nrefuse to believe it. Even though every night, after you sneak home\nand huddle up inside your room trying not to be noticed, ten guards\npatrol this place with subatomics, so the Yardstick gangs won't break\nin and take over. So they won't do what they did down south--overrun\nthe office buildings and the factories and break them up, cut them\ndown to size for living quarters.\"\n\n\"But they were stopped,\" Eric objected. \"I saw it on the telescreen,\nthe security forces stopped them--\"\n\n\"Crapola!\" Wolzek pronounced the archaicism with studied care. \"You\nsaw films. Faked films. Have you ever traveled, Eric? Ever been down\nsouth and seen conditions there?\"\n\n\"Nobody travels nowadays. You know that. Priorities.\"\n\n\"I travel, Eric. And I know. Security forces don't suppress anything\nin the south these days. Because they're made up of Yardsticks now;\nthat's right, Yardsticks exclusively. And in a few years that's the\nway it will be up here. Did you ever hear about the Chicagee riots?\"\n\n\"You mean last year, when the Yardsticks tried to take over the\nsynthetic plants at the Stockyards?\"\n\n\"Tried? They _succeeded_. The workers ousted management. Over fifty\nthousand were killed in the revolution--oh, don't look so shocked,\nthat's the right word for it!--but the Yardsticks won out in the end.\"\n\n\"But the telescreen showed--\"\n\n\"Damn the telescreen! I know because I happened to be there when it\nhappened. And if _you_ had been there, you and a few million other\nostriches who sit with your heads buried in telescreens, maybe we\ncould have stopped them.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it. I can't!\"\n\n\"All right. Think back. That was last year. And since the first of\nthis year, what's happened to the standard size meat-ration?\"\n\n\"They cut it in half,\" Eric admitted. \"But that's because of Ag\nshortages, according to the telescreen reports--\" He stood up,\ngulping. \"Look here, I'm not going to listen to any more of this kind\nof talk. By rights, I ought to turn your name in.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\" Wolzek waved his hand. \"It's happened before. I was\nreported when I blasted the Yardsticks who shot my father down when he\ntried to land his jet in a southern field. I was reported when they\nkilled Annette.\"\n\n\"Annette?\"\n\n\"You remember that name, don't you, Eric? Your first girl, wasn't she?\nWell, I'm the guy who married her. Yes, and I'm the guy who talked her\ninto having a baby without the benefit of Leff shots. Sure, it's\nillegal, and only a few of us ever try it any more, but we both agreed\nthat we wanted it that way. A real, life-sized, normal baby. Or\nabnormal, according to the Yardsticks and the stupid government.\n\n\"It was a dirty scum of a government doctor who let her die on the\ntable when he discovered the child weighed seven pounds. That's when I\nreally woke up, Eric. That's when I knew there was going to be only\none decision to make in the future--kill or be killed.\"\n\n\"Annette. She died, you say?\"\n\nWolzek moved over and put his hand on Eric's shoulder. \"You never\nmarried, did you, Eric? I think I know why. It's because you felt the\nway I did about it. You wanted a regular kid, not a Yardstick. Only\nyou didn't quite have the guts to try and beat the law. Well, you'll\nneed guts now, because it's getting to the point where the law can't\nprotect you any more. The government is made up of old men, and\nthey're afraid to take action. In a few years they'll be pushed out of\noffice all over the world. We'll have Yardstick government then, all\nthe way, and Yardstick law. And that means they'll cut us down to\nsize.\"\n\n\"But what can you--we--do about it?\"\n\n\"Plenty. There's still a little time. If we Naturalists can only get\ntogether, stop being just a name and become an organized force, maybe\nthe ending will be different. We've got to try, in any case.\"\n\n\"The Yardsticks are human beings, just like us,\" Eric said, slowly.\n\"We can't just declare war on them, wipe them out. It's not their\n_fault_ they were born that way.\"\n\nWolzek nodded. \"I know. Nothing is anybody's fault, really. This whole\nbusiness began in good faith. Leffingwell and some of the other\ngeniuses saw a problem and offered what they sincerely believed was a\nsolution.\"\n\n\"But it didn't work,\" Eric murmured.\n\n\"Wrong. It worked only too well. That's the trouble. Sure, we\neliminated our difficulties on the physical level. In less than thirty\nyears we've reached a point where there's no longer any danger of\novercrowding or starvation. But the psychological factor is something\nwe can't cope with. We thought we'd ended war and the possibilities of\nwar a long time ago. But it isn't foreign enemies we must fear today.\nWe've created a nation divided into Davids and Goliaths--and David and\nGoliath are always enemies.\"\n\n\"David killed Goliath,\" Eric said. \"Does that mean we're going to\ndie?\"\n\n\"Only if we're as stupid as Goliath was. Only if we wear our\ntelescreens like invincible armor and pay no attention to the\nslingshot in David's hands.\"\n\nEric lit a reef. \"All right,\" he said. \"You don't have to lecture. I'm\nwilling to join. But I'm no Goliath, really. I never had a fight in my\nlife. What could I do to help?\"\n\n\"You're a rental agent. You have the keys to this building. The guards\ndon't bother you by day, do they? You come and go as you please. That\nmeans you can get into the cellars. You can help us move the stuff\ndown there. And we'll take care of the guards some night, after that.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nThe friendly pressure on Eric's shoulder became a fierce grip. \"You\ndon't have to understand. All you do is let us plant the stuff in the\ncellars and let us get rid of the guards afterwards in our own way.\nThe Yardsticks will do the rest.\"\n\n\"You mean, take over the building when it's not protected?\"\n\n\"Of course. They'll take it over completely, once they see there's no\nopposition. And they'll remodel it to suit themselves, and within a\nmonth there'll be ten thousand Yardsticks sitting in this place.\"\n\n\"The government will never stand still for that.\"\n\n\"Wake up! It's happening all over, all the time, and nothing is being\ndone to prevent it. Security is too weak and officials are too timid\nto risk open warfare. So the Yardsticks win, and I'm going to see that\nthey win this place.\"\n\n\"But how will that help us?\"\n\n\"You don't see it yet, do you? And neither will the Yardsticks. Until,\nsome fine day three or four months from now, we get around to what\nwill be planted in the cellars. Somebody will throw a switch, miles\naway, and--boom!\"\n\n\"Wolzek, you couldn't--\"\n\n\"It's coming. Not only here, but in fifty other places. We've got to\nfight fire with fire, Eric. It's our only chance. Bring this thing out\ninto the open. Make the government realize this is war. Civil war.\nThat's the only way to force them to take real action. We can't do it\nany other way; it's illegal to organize politically, and petitions do\nno good. We can't get a hearing. Well, they'll have to listen to the\nexplosions.\"\n\n\"I just don't know--\"\n\n\"Maybe you're the one who should have married Annette after all.\"\nWolzek's voice was cold. \"Maybe you could have watched her, watched\nher scream and beg and die, and never wanted to move a muscle to do\nanything about it afterwards. Maybe you're the model citizen, Eric;\nyou and the thousands of others who are standing by and letting the\nYardsticks chop us down, one by one. They say in Nature it's the\nsurvival of the fittest. Well, perhaps you're not fit to survive.\"\n\nEric wasn't listening. \"She screamed,\" he said. \"You heard her\nscream?\"\n\nWolzek nodded. \"I can still hear her. I'll always hear her.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Eric blinked abruptly. \"When do we start?\"\n\nWolzek smiled at him. It was a pretty good smile for a man who can\nalways hear screaming. \"I knew I could count on you,\" he murmured.\n\"Nothing like old friends.\"\n\n\"Funny, isn't it?\" Eric tried to match his smile. \"The way things work\nout. You and I being kids together. You marrying my girl. And then, us\nmeeting up again this way.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wolzek, and he wasn't smiling now. \"I guess it's a small\nworld.\"\n\n\n\n\n10. Harry Collins--2032\n\n\nHarry's son's house was on the outskirts of Washington, near what had\nonce been called Gettysburg. Harry was surprised to find that it _was_\na house, and a rather large one, despite the fact that almost all the\nfurniture had been scaled down proportionately to fit the needs of a\nman three feet high.\n\nBut then, Harry was growing accustomed to surprises.\n\nHe found a room of his own, ready and waiting, on the second floor;\nhere the furniture was of almost antique vintage, but adequate in\nsize. And here, in an atmosphere of unaccustomed comfort, he could\ntalk.\n\n\"So you're a physician, eh?\" Harry gazed down into the diminutive\nface, striving to accept the fact that he was speaking to a mature\nadult. His own son--his and Sue's--a grown man and a doctor! It seemed\nincredible. But then, nothing was more incredible than the knowledge\nthat he was actually here, in his child's home.\n\n\"We're all specialists in one field or another,\" his son explained.\n\"Every one of us born and surviving during the early experimental\nperiod received our schooling under a plan Leffingwell set up. It was\npart of his conditional agreement that we become wards of the state.\nHe knew the time might come when we'd be needed.\"\n\n\"But why wasn't all this done openly?\"\n\n\"You know the answer to that. There was no way of educating us under\nthe prevailing system, and there was always a danger we might be\nsingled out as freaks who must be destroyed--particularly in those\nearly years. So Leffingwell relied on secrecy, just as he did during\nhis experimentation period. You know how _you_ felt about that. You\nbelieved innocent people were being murdered. Would you have listened\nto his explanations, accepted the fact that his work was worth the\ncost of a few lives so that future billions of human beings might be\nsaved? No, there was no time for explanation or indoctrination.\nLeffingwell chose concealment.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Harry sighed. \"I understand that better now, I think. But I\ncouldn't see it then, when I tried to kill him.\" He flushed. \"And I\nstill can't quite comprehend why he spared me after that attempt.\"\n\n\"Because he wasn't the monster you thought him to be. When I pleaded\nwith him--\"\n\n\"_You_ were the one!\"\n\nHarry's son turned away. \"Yes. When I was told who you really were, I\nwent to him. But I was only a child, remember that. And he didn't\nspare you out of sentimentality. He had a purpose.\"\n\n\"A purpose in sending me to prison, letting me rot all these years\nwhile--\"\n\n\"While I grew up. I and the others like myself. And while the world\noutside changed.\" Harry's son smiled. \"Your friend Richard Wade was\nright, you know. He guessed a great deal of the truth. Leffingwell and\nManschoff and the rest of their associates deliberately set out to\nassemble a select group of nonconformists--men of specialized talents\nand outlooks. There were over three hundred of you at Stark Falls.\nRichard Wade knew why.\"\n\n\"And so he was dragged off and murdered.\"\n\n\"Murdered? No, Father, he's very much alive, I assure you. In fact,\nhe'll be here tonight.\"\n\n\"But why was he taken away so abruptly, without any warning?\"\n\n\"He was needed. There was a crisis, when Dr. Leffingwell died.\"\nHarry's son sighed. \"You didn't know about that, did you? There's so\nmuch for you to learn. But I'll let him tell you himself, when you see\nhim this evening.\"\n\nRichard Wade told him. And so did William Chang and Lars Neilstrom and\nall the others. During the ensuing weeks, Harry saw each of them\nagain. But Wade's explanation was sufficient.\n\n\"I was right,\" he said. \"There was no Underground when we were at\nStark Falls. What I didn't realize, though, was that there was an\nOverground.\"\n\n\"Overground?\"\n\n\"You might call it that. Leffingwell and his staff formed the nucleus.\nThey foresaw the social crisis which lay ahead, when the world became\nphysically divided into the tall and the short, the young and the old.\nThey knew there'd be a need of individuality then--and they _did_\ncreate a stockpile. A stockpile of the younger generation, specially\neducated; a stockpile of the older generation, carefully selected. We\nconspicuous rebels were incarcerated and given an opportunity to think\nthe problem through, with limited contact with one another's\nviewpoints.\"\n\n\"But why weren't we told the truth at the beginning, allowed to meet\nface-to-face and make some sensible plans for the future?\"\n\nHarry's son interrupted. \"Because Dr. Leffingwell realized this would\ndefeat the ultimate purpose. You'd have formed your own in-group, as\nprisoners, dedicated to your own welfare. There'd be emotional ties--\"\n\n\"I still don't know what you're talking about. What are we supposed to\nprepare for now?\"\n\nRichard Wade shrugged. \"Leffingwell had it all planned. He foresaw\nthat when the first generation of Yardsticks--that's what they call\nthemselves, you know--came of age, there'd be social unrest. The young\npeople would want to take over, and the older generation would try to\nremain in positions of power. It was his belief that tensions could be\nalleviated only by proper leadership on both sides.\n\n\"He himself had an important voice in government circles. He set up an\narrangement whereby a certain number of posts would be assigned to\npeople of his choice, both young and old. Similarly, in the various\nprofessions, there'd be room for appointees he'd select. Given a year\nor two of training, Leffingwell felt that we'd be ready for these\npositions. Young men, like your son, would be placed in key spots\nwhere their influence would be helpful with the Yardsticks. Older men\nsuch as yourself would go into other assignments--in communications\nmedia, chiefly. The skillful use of group-psychological techniques\ncould avert open clashes. He predicted a danger-period lasting about\ntwenty years--roughly, from 2030 to 2050. Once we weathered that span,\nequilibrium would be regained, as a second and third generation came\nalong and the elders became a small minority. If we did our work well\nand eliminated the sources of prejudice, friction and hostility, the\ntransition could be made. The Overground in governmental circles would\nfinance us. This was Leffingwell's plan, his dream.\"\n\n\"You speak in the past tense,\" Harry said.\n\n\"Yes.\" Wade's voice was harsh. \"Because Leffingwell is dead, of\ncerebral hemorrhage. And his plan died with him. Oh, we still have\nsome connections in government; enough to get men like yourself out of\nStark Falls. But things have moved too swiftly. The Yardsticks are\nalready on the march. The people in power--even those we relied\nupon--are getting frightened. They can't see that there's time left to\ntrain us to take over. And frankly, I'm afraid most of them have no\ninclination to give up their present power. They intend to use\nforce.\"\n\n\"But you talk as though the Yardsticks were united.\"\n\n\"They are uniting, and swiftly. Remember the Naturalists?\"\n\nHarry nodded, slowly. \"I was one, once. Or thought I was.\"\n\n\"You were a liberal. I'm talking about the _new_ Naturalists. The ones\nbent on actual revolution.\"\n\n\"Revolution?\"\n\n\"That's the word. And that's the situation. It's coming to a head,\nfast.\"\n\n\"And how will we prevent it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Harry's son stared up at him. \"Most of us believe it's\ntoo late to prevent it. Our immediate problem will be survival. The\nNaturalists want control for themselves. The Yardsticks intend to\ndestroy the power of the older generation. And we feel that if matters\ncome to a head soon, the government itself may turn on us, too.\nThey'll have to.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" said Harry, \"we stand alone.\"\n\n\"Fall alone, more likely,\" Wade corrected.\n\n\"How many of us are there?\"\n\n\"About six hundred,\" said Harry's son. \"Located in private homes\nthroughout this eastern area. If there's violence, we don't have a\nchance of controlling the situation.\"\n\n\"But we can survive. As I see it, that's our only salvation at the\nmoment--to somehow survive the coming conflict. Then, perhaps, we can\nfind a way to function as Leffingwell planned.\"\n\n\"We'll never survive here. They'll use every conceivable weapon.\"\n\n\"But since there's no open break with the government yet, we could\nstill presumably arrange for transportation facilities.\"\n\n\"To where?\"\n\n\"Some spot in which we could weather the storm. What about\nLeffingwell's old hideout?\"\n\n\"The units are still standing.\" Harry's son nodded. \"Yes, that's a\npossibility. But what about food?\"\n\n\"Grizek.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Friend of mine,\" Harry told him. \"Look, we're going to have to work\nfast. And yet we've got to do it in a way that won't attract any\nattention; not even from the government. I suggest we set up an\norganizing committee and make plans.\" He frowned. \"How much time do\nyou think we have--a year or so?\"\n\n\"Six months,\" his son hazarded.\n\n\"Four, at most,\" Wade said. \"Haven't you been getting the full reports\non those riots? Pretty soon they'll declare a state of national\nemergency and then nobody will be going anywhere.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Harry Collins grinned. \"We'll do it in four months.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nActually, as it worked out, they did it in just a day or so under\nthree.\n\nFive hundred and forty-two men moved by jetter to Colorado Springs;\nthence, by helicopter, to the canyon hideaway. They moved in small\ngroups, a few each week. Harry himself had already established the\nliaison system, and he was based at Grizek's ranch. Grizek was dead,\nbut Bassett and Tom Lowery remained and they cooperated. Food would be\nready for the 'copters that came out of the canyon.\n\nThe canyon installation itself was deserted, and the only problem it\npresented was one of rehabilitation. The first contingent took over.\n\nThe jetters carried more than their human cargo; they were filled with\nequipment of all sorts--microscans and laboratory instruments and\ndevices for communication. By the time the entire group was assembled,\nthey had the necessary implementation for study and research. It was a\nwell-conceived and well-executed operation.\n\nTo his surprise, Harry found himself acting as the leader of the\nexpedition, and he continued in this capacity after they were\nestablished. The irony of the situation did not escape him; to all\nintents and purposes he was now ruling the very domain in which he had\nonce languished as a prisoner.\n\nBut with Wade and Chang and the others, he set up a provisional system\nwhich worked out very well. And proved very helpful, once the news\nreached them that open revolt had begun in the world outside.\n\nA battered 'copter landed one evening at dusk, and the wounded pilot\npoured out his message, then his life's blood.\n\nAngelisco was gone. Washington was gone. The Naturalists had struck,\nusing the old, outlawed weapons. And it was the same abroad, according\nto the few garbled reports thereafter obtainable only _via_ ancient\nshortwave devices.\n\nFrom then on, nobody left the canyon except on weekly 'copter-lifts to\nthe ranch grazing lands for fresh supplies. Fortunately, that area was\nundisturbed, and so were its laconic occupants. They neither knew nor\ncared what went on in the world outside; what cities were reported\ndestroyed, what forces triumphed or went down into defeat, what\nactivity or radioactivity prevailed.\n\nLife in the canyon flowed on, more peacefully than the river cleaving\nits center. There was much to do and much to learn. It was, actually,\na monastic existence, compounded of frugality, abstinence, continence\nand devotion to scholarly pursuits. Within a year, gardens flourished;\nwithin two years herds grazed the grassy slopes; within three years\ncloth was being woven on looms in the ancient way and most of the\nhomespun arts of an agrarian society had been revived. Men fell sick\nand men died, but the survivors lived in amity. Harry Collins\ncelebrated his sixtieth birthday as the equivalent of a second-year\nstudent of medicine; his instructor being his own son. Everyone was\nstudying some subject, acquiring some new skill. One-time rebellious\nnatures and one-time biological oddities alike were united by the\ncommon bond of intellectual curiosity.\n\nIt was, however, no Utopia. Some of the younger men wanted women, and\nthere were no women. Some were irked by confinement and wandered off;\nthree of the fleet of eleven 'copters were stolen by groups of\nmalcontents. From time to time there would be a serious quarrel. Six\nmen were murdered. The population dwindled to four hundred and twenty.\n\nBut there was progress, in the main. Eventually Banning joined the\ngroup, from the ranch, and under his guidance the study-system was\nformalized. Attempts were made to project the future situation, to\nprepare for the day when it would be possible to venture safely into\nthe outside world once again and utilize newly-won abilities.\n\nNobody could predict when that would be, nor what kind of world would\nawait their coming. By the time the fifth year had passed, even\nshortwave reports had long since ceased. Rumors persisted that\nradioactive contamination was widespread, that the population had been\nvirtually decimated, that the government had fallen, that the\nNaturalists had set up their own reign only to fall victim to internal\nstrife.\n\n\"But one thing is certain,\" Harry Collins told his companions as they\nassembled in the usual monthly meeting on the grounds before the old\nheadquarters building one afternoon in July. \"The fighting will end\nsoon. If we hear nothing more within the next few months, we'll send\nout observation parties. Once we determine the exact situation, we can\nplan accordingly. The world is going to need what we can give. It will\nuse what we have learned. It will accept our aid. One of these days--\"\n\nAnd he went on to outline a carefully-calculated program of making\ncontact with the powers that be, or might be. It sounded logical and\neven the chronic grumblers and habitual pessimists in the group were\nencouraged.\n\nIf at times they felt the situation fantastic and the hope forlorn,\nthey were heartened now. Richard Wade summed it up succinctly\nafterwards, in a private conversation with Harry.\n\n\"It isn't going to be easy,\" he said. \"In the old science fiction\nyarns I used to write, a group like this would have been able to\nprevent the revolution. At the very least, it would decide who won if\nfighting actually broke out. But in reality we were too late to\nforestall revolt, and we couldn't win the war no matter on whose side\nwe fought. There's just one job we're equipped for--and that's to win\nthe peace. I don't mean we'll step out of here and take over the\nworld, either. We'll have to move slowly and cautiously, dispersing in\nlittle groups of five or six all over the country. And we'll have to\nsound out men in the communities we go to, find those who are willing\nto learn and willing to build. But we can be an influence, and an\nimportant one. We have the knowledge and the skill. We may not be\nchosen to lead, but we can _teach_ the leaders. And that's important.\"\n\nHarry smiled in agreement. They _did_ have something to offer, and\nsurely it would be recognized--even if the Naturalists had won, even\nif the entire country had sunk into semi-barbarism. No use\nanticipating such problems now. Wait until fall came; then they'd\nreconnoitre and find out. Wait until fall--\n\nIt was a wise decision, but one which ignored a single, important\nfact. The Naturalists didn't wait until fall to conduct their\nreconnaissance.\n\nThey came over the canyon that very night; a large group of them in a\nlarge jetter.\n\nAnd they dropped a large bomb....\n\n\n\n\n11. Jesse Pringle--2039\n\n\nThey were after him. The whole world was in flames, and the buildings\nwere falling, the mighty were fallen, the Day of Judgment was at hand.\n\nHe ran through the flames, blindly. Blind Samson. Eyeless in Gaza,\ntreading at the mill. The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they\ngrind exceedingly small.\n\nSmall. They were all small, but that didn't matter. They had the guns\nand they were hunting him down to his doom. Day of doom. Doomsday. The\ngreat red dragon with seven heads and ten horns was abroad in the\nland.\n\nThey had unleashed the dragon and his breath was a fire that seared,\nand his tail was a thunder that toppled towers. The dragon was\nsearching him out for his sins; he would be captured and set to labor\nin the mill.\n\nBut he would escape, he must escape! He was afraid of them, small as\nthey were, and great oaks from little acorns grow, it's the little\nthings that count, and he dare not go a-hunting for fear of little\nmen.\n\nJesse crouched against the dock, watching the grain-elevators burn.\nThe whole city was burning, Babylon the mighty, the whole world was\nburning in God's final wrath of judgment.\n\nNobody believed in God any more, nobody read the Bible, and that's why\nthey didn't know these things. Jesse knew, because he was an old man\nand he remembered how it had been when he was a little boy. A little\nboy who learned of the Word of God and the Wrath of God.\n\nHe could see the reflection of the flames in the water, now, and the\nreflection was shimmery and broken because of the black clusters\nfloating past. Large clusters and small clusters. There were bodies in\nthe water, the bodies of the slain.\n\nThunder boomed from the city behind him. Explosions. That's how it had\nstarted, when the Naturalists began blowing up the buildings. And then\nthe Yardsticks had come with their weapons, hunting down the\nNaturalists. Or had it been that way, really? It didn't matter, now.\nThat was in another country and besides, the wench was dead.\n\nThe wench _is_ dead. His wench, Jesse's wench. She wasn't so old. Only\nseventy-two. But they killed her, they blew off the top of her head\nand he could feel it when they did. It was as if something had\nhappened in _his_ head, and then he ran at them and screamed, and\nthere was great slaughter amongst the heathen, the forces of\nunrighteousness.\n\nAnd Jesse had fled, and smote evil in the name of the Lord, for he\nperceived now that the time was at hand.\n\n_How the mighty are fallen._\n\nJesse blinked at the water, wishing it would clear, wishing his\nthoughts would clear. Sometimes for a moment he could remember back to\nthe way things _really_ were. When it was still a real world, with\nreal people in it. When he was just a little boy and everybody else\nwas big.\n\nStrange. Now he was an old man, a big old man, and almost everybody\nelse was little.\n\nHe tried to think what it had been like, so long ago. It was too long.\nAll he could remember about being small was that he had been afraid.\nAfraid of the bigger people.\n\nAnd now he was big, and afraid of the smaller people.\n\nOf course they weren't real. It was just part of the prophecy, they\nwere the locusts sent to consume and destroy. He kept telling himself\nthere was nothing to fear; the righteous need not fear when the day of\njudgment is at hand.\n\nOnly somewhere inside of him was this little boy, crying, \"Mama, Mama,\nMama!\" And somewhere else was this old man, just staring down into the\nwater and waiting for them to find him.\n\nAnother explosion sounded.\n\nThis one was closer. They must be bombing the entire city. Or else it\nwas the dragon, lashing his tail.\n\nSomebody ran past Jesse, carrying a torch. No, it wasn't a torch--his\nhair was on fire. He jumped into the water, screaming, \"They're\ncoming! They're coming!\"\n\nJesse turned and blinked. They were coming, all right. He could see\nthem pouring out of the alleyway like rats. Rats with gleaming eyes,\ngleaming claws.\n\nSuddenly, his head cleared. He realized that he was going to die. He\nhad, perhaps, one minute of life left. One minute out of eighty years.\nAnd he couldn't fool himself any longer. He was not delirious. Day of\njudgment--that was nonsense. And there was no dragon, and these were\nnot rats. They were merely men. Puny little men who killed because\nthey were afraid.\n\nJesse was a big man, but he was afraid, too. Six feet three inches\ntall he was, when he stood up straight as he did now, watching them\ncome--but he knew fear.\n\nAnd he resolved that he must not take that fear with him into death.\nHe wanted to die with something better than that. Wasn't there\nsomething he could find and cling to, perhaps some memory--?\n\nA minute is so short, and eighty years is so long. Jesse stood there,\nswaying, watching them draw nearer, watching them as they caught sight\nof him and raised their weapons.\n\nHe scanned rapidly into the past. Into the past, before the time the\nwench was dead, back to when you and I were young, Maggie, back still\nearlier, and earlier, seeking the high point, the high school, that\nwas it, the high school, the highlight, the moment of triumph, the\ngame with Lincoln. Yes, that was it. He hadn't been ashamed of being\nsix feet three inches then, he'd been proud of it, proud as he raised\nhis arms and--\n\n_Splashed down into the water as the bullets struck._\n\nAnd that was the end of Jesse Pringle. Jesse Pringle, champion\nbasketball center of the Class of '79....\n\n\n\n\n12. Littlejohn--2065\n\n\nThe helicopter landed on the roof, and the attendants wheeled it over\nto one side. They propped the ladder up, and Littlejohn descended\nslowly, panting.\n\nThey had a coasterchair waiting and he sank into it, grateful for the\nrest. Hardy fellows, these attendants, but then they were almost three\nfeet tall. More stamina, that was the secret. Common stock, of course,\nbut they served a purpose. Somebody had to carry out orders.\n\nWhen they wheeled the coasterchair into the elevator, Littlejohn\ndescended. The elevator halted on the first floor and he breathed a\nsigh of relief. Great heights always made him faint and dizzy, and\neven a short helicopter trip took its toll--the mere thought of\nsoaring two hundred feet above the ground was enough to paralyze him.\n\nBut this journey was vital. Thurmon was waiting for him.\n\nYes, Thurmon was waiting for him here in the council chamber. The\ncoasterchair rolled forward into the room and again Littlejohn felt a\ntwinge of apprehension. The room was vast--too big for comfort. It\nmust be all of fifty feet long, and over ten feet in height. How could\nThurmon stand it, working here?\n\nBut he had to endure it, Littlejohn reminded himself. He was head of\nthe council.\n\nThurmon was lying on the couch when Littlejohn rolled in, but he sat\nup and smiled.\n\n\"I greet you,\" he said.\n\n\"I greet you,\" Littlejohn answered. \"No, don't bother to stay seated.\nSurely we don't need to be ceremonious.\"\n\nThurmon pricked up his ears at the sound of the unfamiliar word. He\nwasn't the scholarly type, like Littlejohn. But he appreciated\nLittlejohn's learning and knew he was important to the council. They\nneeded scholars these days, and antiquarians too. One has to look to\nthe past when rebuilding a world.\n\n\"You sent for me?\" Littlejohn asked. The question was purely\nrhetorical, but he wanted to break the silence. Thurmon looked\ntroubled as he replied.\n\n\"Yes. It is a matter of confidence between us.\"\n\n\"So be it. You may speak in trust.\"\n\nThurmon eyed the door. \"Come nearer,\" he said.\n\nLittlejohn pressed a lever and rolled up to the couchside. Thurmon's\neyes peered at him through the thick contact lenses. Littlejohn noted\nthe deep wrinkles around his mouth, but without surprise. After all,\nThurmon was an old man--he must be over thirty.\n\n\"I have been thinking,\" Thurmon said, abruptly. \"We have failed.\"\n\n\"Failed?\"\n\nThurmon nodded. \"Need I explain? You have been close to the council\nfor many years. You have seen what we've attempted, ever since the\nclose of the Naturalist wars.\"\n\n\"A magnificent effort,\" Littlejohn answered politely. \"In less than\nthirty years an entire new world has risen from the ruins of the old.\nCivilization has been restored, snatched from the very brink of a\nbarbarism that threatened to engulf us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Thurmon murmured.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Sheer nonsense, Littlejohn. You're talking like a pedant.\"\n\n\"But I _am_ a pedant.\" Littlejohn nodded. \"And it's true. When the\nNaturalists were exterminated, this nation and other nations were\nliterally destroyed. Worse than physical destruction was the threat of\nmental and moral collapse. But the Yardstick councils arose to take\nover. The concept of small government came into being and saved us. We\nbegan to rebuild on a sensible scale, with local, limited control. The\nlittle community arose--\"\n\n\"Spare me the history lesson,\" said Thurmon, dryly. \"We rebuilt, yes.\nWe survived. In a sense, perhaps, we even made certain advances. There\nis no longer any economic rivalry, no social distinctions, no external\npressure. I think I can safely assume that the danger of future\nwarfare is forever banished. The balance of power is no longer a\nfactor. The balance of Nature has been partially restored. And only\none problem remains to plague mankind.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"We face extinction,\" Thurmon said.\n\n\"But that's not true,\" Littlejohn interrupted. \"Look at history and--\"\n\n\"Look at us.\" Thurmon sighed. \"You needn't bother with history. The\nanswer is written in our faces, in our own bodies. I've searched the\npast very little, compared to your scholarship, but enough to know\nthat things were different in the old days. The Naturalists, whatever\nelse they might have been, were strong men. They walked freely in the\nland, they lived lustily and long.\n\n\"Do you know what our average life-expectancy is today, Littlejohn? A\nshade under forty years. And that only if one is fortunate enough to\nlead a sheltered existence, as we do. In the mines, in the fields, in\nthe radioactive areas, they die before the age of thirty.\"\n\nLittlejohn leaned forward. \"Schuyler touches on just that point in his\n_Psychology of Time_,\" he said, eagerly. \"He posits the relationship\nbetween size and duration. Time is relative, you know. Our lives,\nshort as they may be in terms of comparative chronology, nevertheless\nhave a subjective span equal to that of the Naturalists in their\nheyday.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Thurman said, again. \"Did you think that is what concerns\nme--whether or not we feel that our lives are long or short?\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about the basic elements essential to survival. I'm\ntalking about strength, stamina, endurance, the ability to function.\nThat's what we're losing, along with the normal span of years. The\nworld is soft and flabby. Yardstick children, they tell us, were\nhealthy at first. But _their_ children are weaker. And their\ngrandchildren, weaker still. The effect of the wars, the ravages of\nradiation and malnutrition, have taken a terrible toll. The world is\nsoft and flabby today. People can't walk any more, let alone run. We\nfind it difficult to lift and bend and work--\"\n\n\"But we won't have to worry about such matters for long,\" Littlejohn\nhazarded. \"Think of what's being done in robotics. Those recent\nexperiments seem to prove--\"\n\n\"I know.\" Thurmon nodded. \"We can create robots, no doubt. We have a\nlimited amount of raw materials to allocate to the project, and if we\ncan perfect automatons they'll function quite adequately. Virtually\nindestructible, too, I understand. I imagine they'll still be able to\noperate efficiently a hundred or more years from now--if only they\nlearn to oil and repair one another. Because by that time, the human\nrace will be gone.\"\n\n\"Come now, it isn't that serious--\"\n\n\"Oh, but it is!\" Thurmon raised himself again, with an effort. \"Your\nstudy of history should have taught you one thing, if nothing else.\nThe tempo is quickening. While it took mankind thousands of years to\nmove from the bow and arrow to the rifle, it took only a few hundred\nto move from the rifle to the thermonuclear weapon. It took ages\nbefore men mastered flight, and then in two generations they developed\nsatellites; in three, they reached the moon and Mars.\"\n\n\"But we're talking about _physical_ development.\"\n\n\"I know. And physically, the human race altered just as drastically in\nan equally short span of time. As recently as the nineteenth century,\nthe incidence of disease was a thousandfold greater than it is now.\nLife was short then. In the twentieth century disease lessened and\nlife-expectancy doubled, in certain areas. Height and weight increased\nperceptibly with every passing decade. Then came Leffingwell and his\ninjections. Height, weight, life-expectancy have fallen perceptibly\nevery decade since then. The war merely hastened the process.\"\n\n\"You appear to have devoted a great deal of time to this question,\"\nLittlejohn observed.\n\n\"I have,\" answered the older man. \"And it is not a question. It is a\nfact. The one fact that confronts us all. If we proceed along our\npresent path, we face certain extinction in a very short time. The\nstrain is weakening constantly, the vitality is draining away. We\nsought to defeat Nature--but the Naturalists were right, in their\nway.\"\n\n\"And the solution?\"\n\nThurmon was silent for a long moment. Then, \"I have none,\" he said.\n\n\"You have consulted the medical authorities?\"\n\n\"Naturally. And experiments have been made. Physical conditioning,\nsystems of exercise, experimentation in chemotherapy are still being\nundertaken. There's no lack of volunteers, but a great lack of\nresults. No, the answer does not lie in that direction.\"\n\n\"But what else is there?\"\n\n\"That is what I had hoped you might tell me,\" Thurmon said. \"You are a\nscholar. You know the past. You speak often of the lessons of\nhistory--\"\n\nLittlejohn was nodding, but not in agreement. He was trying to\ncomprehend. For suddenly the conviction came to him clearly; Thurmon\nwas right. It was happening, had happened, right under their smug\nnoses. The world was weakening. It was slowing down, and the race is\nonly to the swift.\n\nHe cursed himself for his habit of thinking in platitudes and\nquotations, but long years of study had unfitted him for less prosaic\nphraseology. If he could only be practical.\n\n_Practical._\n\n\"Thurmon,\" he said. \"There is a way. A way so obvious, we've all\noverlooked it--passed right over it.\"\n\n\"And that is--?\"\n\n\"Stop the Leffingwell injections!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I know what you'll say. There have been genetic mutations. Very true,\nbut such mutations can't be universal. A certain percentage of\noffspring will be sound, capable of attaining full growth. And we\ndon't have the population-problem to cope with any more. There's room\nfor people again. So why not try it? Stop the injections and allow\nbabies to be born as they were before.\" Littlejohn hesitated before\nadding a final word, but he knew he had to add it; he knew it now.\n\"Normally,\" he said.\n\nThurmon nodded. \"So that is your answer.\"\n\n\"Yes. I--I think it will work.\"\n\n\"So do the biologists,\" Thurmon told him. \"A generation of normal\ninfants, reared to maturity, would restore mankind to its former\nstature, in every sense of the word. And now, knowing the lessons of\nthe past, we could prepare for the change to come. We could rebuild\nthe world for them to live in, rebuild it psychically as well as\nphysically. We'd plan to eliminate the rivalry between the large and\nthe small, the strong and the weak. It wouldn't be difficult because\nthere's plenty for all. There'd be no trouble as there was in the old\ndays. We've learned to be psychologically flexible.\"\n\nLittlejohn smiled. \"Then that _is_ the solution?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. Eliminating the Leffingwell injections will give us a good\nproportion of normal children again. _But where do we find the normal\nwomen to bear them?_\"\n\n\"Normal women?\"\n\nThurmon sighed, then reached over and placed a scroll in the scanner.\n\"I have already gone into that question with research technicians,\" he\nsaid. \"And I have the figures here.\" He switched on the scanner and\nbegan to read.\n\n\"The average nubile female, aged thirteen to twenty-one, is two feet,\nten inches high and weighs forty-eight pounds.\" Thurmon flicked the\nswitch again and peered up. \"I don't think I'll bother with pelvic\nmeasurements,\" he said. \"You can already see that giving birth to a\nsix or seven-pound infant is a physical impossibility under the\ncircumstances. It cannot be done.\"\n\n\"But surely there must be _some_ larger females! Perhaps a system of\nselective breeding, on a gradual basis--\"\n\n\"You're talking in terms of generations. We haven't got that much\ntime.\" Thurmon shook his head. \"No, we're stopped right here. We can't\nget normal babies without normal women, and the only normal women are\nthose who began life as normal babies.\"\n\n\"Which comes first?\" Littlejohn murmured. \"The chicken or the egg?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just an old saying. From history.\"\n\nThurmon frowned. \"Apparently, then, that's all you can offer in your\nprofessional capacity as an historian. Just some old sayings.\" He\nsighed. \"Too bad you don't know some old prayers. Because we need them\nnow.\"\n\nHe bowed his head, signifying the end of the interview.\n\nLittlejohn rolled out of the room.\n\nHis 'copter took him back to his own dwelling, back across the\nrooftops of New Chicagee. Ordinarily, Littlejohn avoided looking down.\nHe dreaded heights, and the immensity of the city itself was somehow\nappalling. But now he gazed upon the capital and center of\ncivilization with a certain morbid affection.\n\nNew Chicagee had risen on the ashes of the old, after the war's end.\nUse of thermo-nucs had been limited, fortunately, so radioactivity did\nnot linger, and the vast craters hollowed out by ordinary warheads had\nbeen partially filled by rubble and debris. Artificial fill had done\nthe rest of the job, so that now New Chicagee was merely a flat\nprairie as it must have been hundreds of years ago--a flat prairie on\nwhich the city had been resurrected. There were almost fifty thousand\npeople here in the capital; the largest congregation of population on\nthe entire continent. They had built well and surely this time, built\nfor the security and certainty of centuries to come.\n\nLittlejohn sighed. It was hard to accept the fact that they had been\nwrong; that all this would end in nothingness. They had eliminated\nwar, eliminated disease, eliminated famine, eliminated social\ninequality, injustice, disorders external and internal--and in so\ndoing, they had eliminated themselves.\n\nThe sun was setting in the west, and long shadows crept over the city\nbelow. Yes, the sun was setting and the shadows were gathering, the\nnight was coming to claim its own. Darkness was falling, eternal\ndarkness.\n\nIt was quite dark by the time Littlejohn's 'copter landed on the\nrooftop of his own dwelling; so dark, in fact, that for a moment he\ndidn't see the strange vehicle already standing there. Not until he\nhad settled into his coasterchair did he notice the presence of the\nother 'copter, and then it was too late. Too late to do anything\nexcept sit and stare as the gigantic shadow loomed out of the night,\nsilhouetted against the sky.\n\nThe shadow shambled forward, and Littlejohn gaped, gaped in terror at\nthe titanic figure. He opened his mouth to speak, but words did not\nform; there were no words to form, for how does one address an\napparition?\n\nInstead, it was the apparition which spoke.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you,\" it said.\n\n\"Y-yes--\"\n\n\"I want to talk to you.\" The voice was deep, menacing.\n\nLittlejohn shifted in his coasterchair. There was nowhere to go, no\nescape. He gazed up at the shadow. Finally he summoned a response.\n\"Shall we go inside?\" he asked.\n\nThe figure shook its head. \"Where? Down into that dollhouse of yours?\nIt isn't big enough. I've already been there. What I have to say can\nbe said right here.\"\n\n\"W-who are you?\"\n\nThe figure stepped forward, so that its face was illuminated by the\nfluorescence streaming from the open door which led to the inclined\nchairway descending to Littlejohn's dwelling.\n\nLittlejohn could see the face, now--the gigantic, wrinkled face,\nscarred and seared and seamed. It was a human face, but utterly alien\nto the humanity Littlejohn knew. Faces such as this one had\ndisappeared from the earth a lifetime ago. At least, history had\ntaught him that. History had not prepared him for the actual living\npresence of a--\n\n\"Naturalist!\" Littlejohn gasped. \"You're a Naturalist! Yes, that's\nwhat you are!\"\n\nThe apparition scowled.\n\n\"I am not a Naturalist. I am a man.\"\n\n\"But you can't be! The war--\"\n\n\"I am very old. I lived through your war. I have lived through your\npeace. Soon I shall die. But before I do, there is something else\nwhich must be done.\"\n\n\"You've come here to kill me?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" The looming figure moved closer and stared down. \"No, don't\ntry to summon help. When your servants saw me, they fled. You're alone\nnow, Littlejohn.\"\n\n\"You know my name.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know your name. I know the names of everyone on the council.\nEach of them has a visitor tonight.\"\n\n\"Then it is a plot, a conspiracy?\"\n\n\"We have planned this very carefully, through the long years. It's all\nwe lived for, those few of us who survived the war.\"\n\n\"But the council wasn't responsible for the war! Most of us weren't\neven alive, then. Believe me, we weren't to blame--\"\n\n\"I know.\" The gigantic face creased in senile simulation of a smile.\n\"Nobody was ever to blame for anything, nobody was ever responsible.\nThat's what they always told me. I mustn't hate mankind for\nmultiplying, even though population created pressure and pressure\ncreated panic that drove me mad. I mustn't blame Leffingwell for\nsolving the overpopulation problem, even though he used me as a\nguinea-pig in his experiments. I mustn't blame the Yardsticks for\npenning me up in prison until revolution broke out, and I mustn't\nblame the Naturalists for bombing the place where I took refuge. So\nwhose fault was it that I've gone through eighty years of assorted\nhell? Why did I, Harry Collins, get singled out for a lifetime of\nmisery and misfortune?\" The huge old man bent over Littlejohn's\nhuddled form. \"Maybe it was all a means to an end. A way of bringing\nme here, at this moment, to do what must be done.\"\n\n\"Don't harm me--you're not well, you're--\"\n\n\"Crazy?\" The old man shook his head. \"No, I'm not crazy. Not now. But\nI _have_ been, at times, during my life. Perhaps we all are, when we\nattempt to face up to the complications of an average existence, try\nto confront the problems which are too big for a single consciousness\nto cope with in a single life-span. I've been crazy in the city, and\ncrazy in the isolation of a cell, and crazy in the welter of war. And\nperhaps the worst time of all was when I lost my son.\n\n\"Yes, I had a son, Littlejohn. He was one of the first, one of\nLeffingwell's original mutations, and I never knew him very well until\nthe revolution came and we went away together. He was a doctor, my\nboy, and a good one. We spent almost five years together and I learned\na lot from him. About medicine, but that wasn't important then. I'm\nthinking of what I learned about love. I'd always hated Yardsticks,\nbut my son was one, and I came to love him. He had plans for\nrebuilding the world, he and I and the rest of us. We were going to\nwait until the revolution ended and then help restore sanity in\ncivilization.\n\n\"But the Naturalists flew over and dropped their bomb, and my boy\ndied. Over four hundred of our group died there in the canyon--four\nhundred who might have changed the fate of the world. Do you think I\ncan forget that? Do you think I and the few others who survived have\never forgotten? Can you blame us if we did go crazy? If we hid away\nout there in the western wilderness, hid away from a world that had\noffered us nothing but death and destruction, and plotted to bring\ndeath and destruction to that world in return?\n\n\"Think about it for a moment, Littlejohn. We were old men, all of us,\nand the world had given us only its misery to bear during our\nlifetimes. The world we wanted to save was destroying itself; why\nshould we be concerned with its fate or future?\n\n\"So we changed our plans, Littlejohn. Perhaps the shock had been too\nmuch. Instead of plotting to rebuild the world, we turned our thoughts\nto completing its destruction. Our tools and texts were gone, buried\nin the rubble with the bodies of fine young men. But we had our minds.\nCrazed minds, you'd call them--but aware of reality. The grim reality\nof the post-revolutionary years.\n\n\"We burrowed away in the desert. We schemed and we dreamed. From time\nto time we sent out spies. We knew what was going on. We knew the\nNaturalists were gone, that six-footers had vanished from a Yardstick\nworld. We knew about the rehabilitation projects. We watched your\npeople gradually evolve new patterns of living and learning. Some of\nthe former knowledge was rescued, but not all. Our little group had\nfar more learning than you've ever dreamed of. Fifty of us, between\nourselves, could have surpassed all your scientists in every field.\n\n\"But we watched, and we waited. And some of us died of privation and\nsome of us died of old age. Until, at last, there were only a dozen of\nus to share the dream. The dream of destruction. And we knew that we\nmust act swiftly, or not at all.\n\n\"So we came into the world, cautiously and carefully, moving\nunobtrusively and unobserved. We wanted to contemplate the corruption,\nseek out the weaknesses in your degenerate civilization. And we found\nthem, immediately. Those weaknesses are everywhere apparent, for they\nare physical. You're one of a dying race, Littlejohn. Mankind's days\nare numbered. There's no need for grandiose schemes of reactivating\nwarheads in buried missile-centers, of loosing thermo-nucs upon the\nworld. Merely by killing off the central council here in New Chicagee,\nwe can accomplish our objective. A dozen men die, and there's not\nenough initiative left to replace them. It's as simple as that. And as\ncomplicated.\"\n\nHarry Collins nodded. \"Yes, as complicated. Because the only\nweaknesses we've observed _are_ physical ones. We've seen enough of\nthe ways of this new civilization to realize that.\n\n\"All of the things I hated during my lifetime have disappeared\nnow--the crowding, the competition, the sordid self-interest, the\nbigotry, intolerance, prejudice. The anti-social aspects of society\nare gone. There is only the human race, living much closer to the\nconcept of Utopia than I ever dreamed possible. You and the other\nsurvivors have done well, Littlejohn.\"\n\n\"And yet you come to kill us.\"\n\n\"We came for that purpose. Because _we_ still retained the flaws and\nfailings of our former cultures. We looked for targets to blame, for\nvillains to hate and destroy. Instead, we found this reality.\n\n\"No, I'm not crazy, Littlejohn. And I and my fellows aren't here to\nexecute revenge. We have returned to the original plan; the plan\nLeffingwell had, and my son, and all the others who worked in their\nown way for their dream of a better world. We come now to help you.\nHelp you before you die--before we die.\"\n\nLittlejohn looked up and sighed. \"Why couldn't this have happened\nbefore?\" he murmured. \"It's too late now.\"\n\n\"But it isn't too late. My friends are here. They are telling your\nfellow council-members the same thing right now. We may be old, but we\ncan still impart what we have learned. There are any number of\ntechnological developments to be made. We can help you to increase\nyour use of atomic power. There's soil reclamation and irrigation\nprojects and biological techniques--\"\n\n\"You said it yourself,\" Littlejohn whispered. \"We're a dying race.\nThat's the primary problem. And it's an insoluble one. Just this\nafternoon--\" And he told him about the interview with Thurmon.\n\n\"Don't you understand?\" Littlejohn concluded. \"We have no solution for\nsurvival. We're paying the price now because for a while we wouldn't\nheed history. We tried to defeat Nature and in the end Nature has\ndefeated us. Because we would not render unto Caesar the things which\nare--\"\n\nHarry Collins smiled. \"That's it,\" he said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Caesar. That's the answer. Your own medical men must have records. I\nknow, because I learned medicine from my son. There used to be an\noperation, in the old days, called a caesarean section--used on normal\nwomen and on dwarfs and midgets too, in childbirth. If your problem is\nhow to deliver normal children safely, the technique can be revived.\nGet hold of some of your people. Let's see what data you have on this.\nI'll be glad to furnish instruction--\"\n\nThere was excitement after that. Too much excitement for Littlejohn.\nBy the time the council had assembled in emergency session, by the\ntime plans were formulated and he returned to his own dwelling in the\nhelicopter, he was completely exhausted. Only the edge of elation\nsustained him; the realization that a solution had been found.\n\nAs he sank into slumber he knew that he would sleep the clock around.\n\nAnd so would Harry Collins. The old man and his companions, now guests\nof the council, had been temporarily quartered in the council-chambers.\nIt was the only structure large enough to house them and even so they\nhad to sleep on the floor. But it was sufficient comfort for the moment.\n\nIt was many hours before Harry Collins awoke. His waking was\nautomatic, for the tiny telescreen at the end of the council room\nglowed suddenly, and the traditional voice chirped forth to interrupt\nhis slumber.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said the voice. \"It's a beautiful day in New\nChicagee!\"\n\nHarry stared at the screen and then he smiled.\n\n\"Yes,\" he murmured. \"But tomorrow will be better.\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of This Crowded Earth, by Robert Bloch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THIS CROWDED EARTH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25776.txt or 25776.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/2/5/7/7/25776/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
