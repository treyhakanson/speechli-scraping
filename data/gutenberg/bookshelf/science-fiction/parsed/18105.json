Beam Piper\n\n     FEATURE NOVELET\n     OF LOST WORLDS\n\n\n     Was this ill-fated expedition the end of a proud, old race--or the\n     beginning of a new one?\n\n     There are strange gaps in our records of the past. We find traces\n     of man-like things--but, suddenly, man appears, far too much\n     developed to be the \"next step\" in a well-linked chain of\n     evolutionary evidence. Perhaps something like the events of this\n     story furnishes the answer to the riddle.\n\n\nAboard the ship, there was neither day nor night; the hours slipped\ngently by, as vistas of star-gemmed blackness slid across the\nvisiscreens. For the crew, time had some meaning--one watch on duty and\ntwo off. But for the thousand-odd colonists, the men and women who were\nto be the spearhead of migration to a new and friendlier planet, it had\nnone. They slept, and played, worked at such tasks as they could invent,\nand slept again, while the huge ship followed her plotted trajectory.\n\nKalvar Dard, the army officer who would lead them in their new home, had\nas little to do as any of his followers. The ship's officers had all the\nresponsibility for the voyage, and, for the first time in over five\nyears, he had none at all. He was finding the unaccustomed idleness more\nwearying than the hectic work of loading the ship before the blastoff\nfrom Doorsha. He went over his landing and security plans again, and\nfound no probable emergency unprepared for. Dard wandered about the\nship, talking to groups of his colonists, and found morale even better\nthan he had hoped. He spent hours staring into the forward visiscreens,\nwatching the disc of Tareesh, the planet of his destination, grow larger\nand plainer ahead.\n\nNow, with the voyage almost over, he was in the cargo-hold just aft of\nthe Number Seven bulkhead, with six girls to help him, checking\nconstruction material which would be needed immediately after landing.\nThe stuff had all been checked two or three times before, but there was\nno harm in going over it again. It furnished an occupation to fill in\nthe time; it gave Kalvar Dard an excuse for surrounding himself with\nhalf a dozen charming girls, and the girls seemed to enjoy being with\nhim. There was tall blonde Olva, the electromagnetician; pert little\nVarnis, the machinist's helper; Kyna, the surgeon's-aide; dark-haired\nAnalea; Dorita, the accountant; plump little Eldra, the armament\ntechnician. At the moment, they were all sitting on or around the desk\nin the corner of the store-room, going over the inventory when they were\nnot just gabbling.\n\n\"Well, how about the rock-drill bitts?\" Dorita was asking earnestly,\ntrying to stick to business. \"Won't we need them almost as soon as we're\noff?\"\n\n\"Yes, we'll have to dig temporary magazines for our explosives,\nsmall-arms and artillery ammunition, and storage-pits for our\nfissionables and radioactives,\" Kalvar Dard replied. \"We'll have to have\nsafe places for that stuff ready before it can be unloaded; and if we\nrun into hard rock near the surface, we'll have to drill holes for\nblasting-shots.\"\n\n\"The drilling machinery goes into one of those prefabricated sheds,\"\nEldra considered. \"Will there be room in it for all the bitts, too?\"\n\nKalvar Dard shrugged. \"Maybe. If not, we'll cut poles and build racks\nfor them outside. The bitts are nono-steel; they can be stored in the\nopen.\"\n\n\"If there are poles to cut,\" Olva added.\n\n\"I'm not worrying about that,\" Kalvar Dard replied. \"We have a pretty\nfair idea of conditions on Tareesh; our astronomers have been making\ntelescopic observations for the past fifteen centuries. There's a pretty\nbig Arctic ice-cap, but it's been receding slowly, with a wide belt of\nwhat's believed to be open grassland to the south of it, and a belt of\nwhat's assumed to be evergreen forest south of that. We plan to land\nsomewhere in the northern hemisphere, about the grassland-forest line.\nAnd since Tareesh is richer in water that Doorsha, you mustn't think of\ngrassland in terms of our wire-grass plains, or forests in terms of our\nbrush thickets. The vegetation should be much more luxuriant.\"\n\n\"If there's such a large polar ice-cap, the summers ought to be fairly\ncool, and the winters cold,\" Varnis reasoned. \"I'd think that would mean\nfur-bearing animals. Colonel, you'll have to shoot me something with a\nnice soft fur; I like furs.\"\n\nKalvar Dard chuckled. \"Shoot you nothing, you can shoot your own furs.\nI've seen your carbine and pistol scores,\" he began.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a sudden suck of air, disturbing the papers on the desk. They\nall turned to see one of the ship's rocket-boat bays open; a young Air\nForce lieutenant named Seldar Glav, who would be staying on Tareesh with\nthem to pilot their aircraft, emerged from an open airlock.\n\n\"Don't tell me you've been to Tareesh and back in that thing,\" Olva\ngreeted him.\n\nSeldar Glav grinned at her. \"I could have been, at that; we're only\ntwenty or thirty planetary calibers away, now. We ought to be entering\nTareeshan atmosphere by the middle of the next watch. I was only\nchecking the boats, to make sure they'll be ready to launch.... Colonel\nKalvar, would you mind stepping over here? There's something I think you\nshould look at, sir.\"\n\nKalvar Dard took one arm from around Analea's waist and lifted the other\nfrom Varnis' shoulder, sliding off the desk. He followed Glav into the\nboat-bay; as they went through the airlock, the cheerfulness left the\nyoung lieutenant's face.\n\n\"I didn't want to say anything in front of the girls, sir,\" he began,\n\"but I've been checking boats to make sure we can make a quick getaway.\nOur meteor-security's gone out. The detectors are deader then the Fourth\nDynasty, and the blasters won't synchronize.... Did you hear a big\nthump, about a half an hour ago, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought the ship's labor-crew was shifting heavy equipment in\nthe hold aft of us. What was it, a meteor-hit?\"\n\n\"It was. Just aft of Number Ten bulkhead. A meteor about the size of the\nnose of that rocket-boat.\"\n\nKalvar Dard whistled softly. \"Great Gods of Power! The detectors must be\ndead, to pass up anything like that.... Why wasn't a boat-stations call\nsent out?\"\n\n\"Captain Vlazil was unwilling to risk starting a panic, sir,\" the Air\nForce officer replied. \"Really, I'm exceeding my orders in mentioning it\nto you, but I thought you should know....\"\n\nKalvar Dard swore. \"It's a blasted pity Captain Vlazil didn't try\nthinking! Gold-braided quarter-wit! Maybe his crew might panic, but my\npeople wouldn't.... I'm going to call the control-room and have it out\nwith him. By the Ten Gods...!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe ran through the airlock and back into the hold, starting toward the\nintercom-phone beside the desk. Before he could reach it, there was\nanother heavy jar, rocking the entire ship. He, and Seldar Glav, who had\nfollowed him out of the boat-bay, and the six girls, who had risen on\nhearing their commander's angry voice, were all tumbled into a heap.\nDard surged to his feet, dragging Kyna up along with him; together, they\nhelped the others to rise. The ship was suddenly filled with jangling\nbells, and the red danger-lights on the ceiling were flashing on and\noff.\n\n\"Attention! Attention!\" the voice of some officer in the control-room\nblared out of the intercom-speaker. \"The ship has just been hit by a\nlarge meteor! All compartments between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen are\nsealed off. All persons between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen, put on\noxygen helmets and plug in at the nearest phone connection. Your air is\nleaking, and you can't get out, but if you put on oxygen equipment\nimmediately, you'll be all right. We'll get you out as soon as we can,\nand in any case, we are only a few hours out of Tareeshan atmosphere.\nAll persons in Compartment Twelve, put on....\"\n\nKalvar Dard was swearing evilly. \"That does it! That does it for\ngood!... Anybody else in this compartment, below the living quarter\nlevel?\"\n\n\"No, we're the only ones,\" Analea told him.\n\n\"The people above have their own boats; they can look after themselves.\nYou girls, get in that boat, in there. Glav, you and I'll try to warn\nthe people above....\"\n\nThere was another jar, heavier than the one which had preceded it,\nthrowing them all down again. As they rose, a new voice was shouting\nover the public-address system:\n\n\"_Abandon ship! Abandon ship!_ The converters are backfiring, and\nrocket-fuel is leaking back toward the engine-rooms! An explosion is\nimminent! Abandon ship, all hands!\"\n\nKalvar Dard and Seldar Glav grabbed the girls and literally threw them\nthrough the hatch, into the rocket-boat. Dard pushed Glav in ahead of\nhim, then jumped in. Before he had picked himself up, two or three of\nthe girls were at the hatch, dogging the cover down.\n\n\"All right, Glav, blast off!\" Dard ordered. \"We've got to be at least a\nhundred miles from this ship when she blows, or we'll blow with her!\"\n\n\"Don't I know!\" Seldar Glav retorted over his shoulder, racing for the\ncontrols. \"Grab hold of something, everybody; I'm going to fire all jets\nat once!\"\n\nAn instant later, while Kalvar Dard and the girls clung to stanchions\nand pieces of fixed furniture, the boat shot forward out of its housing.\nWhen Dard's head had cleared, it was in free flight.\n\n\"How was that?\" Glav yelled. \"Everybody all right?\" He hesitated for a\nmoment. \"I think I blacked out for about ten seconds.\"\n\nKalvar Dard looked the girls over. Eldra was using a corner of her smock\nto stanch a nosebleed, and Olva had a bruise over one eye. Otherwise,\neverybody was in good shape.\n\n\"Wonder we didn't all black out, permanently,\" he said. \"Well, put on\nthe visiscreens, and let's see what's going on outside. Olva, get on the\nradio and try to see if anybody else got away.\"\n\n\"Set course for Tareesh?\" Glav asked. \"We haven't fuel enough to make it\nback to Doorsha.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that,\" Dard nodded. \"Tareesh it is; northern\nhemisphere, daylight side. Try to get about the edge of the temperate\nzone, as near water as you can....\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThey were flung off their feet again, this time backward along the boat.\nAs they picked themselves up, Seldar Glav was shaking his head, sadly.\n\"That was the ship going up,\" he said; \"the blast must have caught us\ndead astern.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Kalvar Dard rubbed a bruised forehead. \"Set course for\nTareesh, then cut out the jets till we're ready to land. And get the\nscreens on, somebody; I want to see what's happened.\"\n\nThe screens glowed; then full vision came on. The planet on which they\nwould land loomed huge before them, its north pole toward them, and its\nsingle satellite on the port side. There was no sign of any rocket-boat\nin either side screen, and the rear-view screen was a blur of yellow\nflame from the jets.\n\n\"Cut the jets, Glav,\" Dard repeated. \"Didn't you hear me?\"\n\n\"But I did, sir!\" Seldar Glav indicated the firing-panel. Then he\nglanced at the rear-view screen. \"The gods help us! It's yellow flame;\nthe jets are burning out!\"\n\nKalvar Dard had not boasted idly when he had said that his people would\nnot panic. All the girls went white, and one or two gave low cries of\nconsternation, but that was all.\n\n\"What happens next?\" Analea wanted to know. \"Do we blow, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, as soon as the fuel-line burns up to the tanks.\"\n\n\"Can you land on Tareesh before then?\" Dard asked.\n\n\"I can try. How about the satellite? It's closer.\"\n\n\"It's also airless. Look at it and see for yourself,\" Kalvar Dard\nadvised. \"Not enough mass to hold an atmosphere.\"\n\nGlav looked at the army officer with new respect. He had always been\ninclined to think of the Frontier Guards as a gang of scientifically\nilliterate dirk-and-pistol bravos. He fiddled for a while with\ninstruments on the panel; an automatic computer figured the distance to\nthe planet, the boat's velocity, and the time needed for a landing.\n\n\"We have a chance, sir,\" he said. \"I think I can set down in about\nthirty minutes; that should give us about ten minutes to get clear of\nthe boat, before she blows up.\"\n\n\"All right; get busy, girls,\" Kalvar Dard said. \"Grab everything we'll\nneed. Arms and ammunition first; all of them you can find. After that,\nwarm clothing, bedding, tools and food.\"\n\nWith that, he jerked open one of the lockers and began pulling out\nweapons. He buckled on a pistol and dagger, and handed other\nweapon-belts to the girls behind him. He found two of the heavy\nbig-game rifles, and several bandoliers of ammunition for them. He\ntossed out carbines, and boxes of carbine and pistol cartridges. He\nfound two bomb-bags, each containing six light anti-personnel grenades\nand a big demolition-bomb. Glancing, now and then, at the forward\nscreen, he caught glimpses of blue sky and green-tinted plains below.\n\n\"All right!\" the pilot yelled. \"We're coming in for a landing! A couple\nof you stand by to get the hatch open.\"\n\nThere was a jolt, and all sense of movement stopped. A cloud of white\nsmoke drifted past the screens. The girls got the hatch open; snatching\nup weapons and bedding-wrapped bundles they all scrambled up out of the\nboat.\n\nThere was fire outside. The boat had come down upon a grassy plain; now\nthe grass was burning from the heat of the jets. One by one, they ran\nforward along the top of the rocket-boat, jumping down to the ground\nclear of the blaze. Then, with every atom of strength they possessed\nthey ran away from the doomed boat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ground was rough, and the grass high, impeding them. One of the\ngirls tripped and fell; without pausing, two others pulled her to her\nfeet, while another snatched up and slung the carbine she had dropped.\nThen, ahead, Kalvar Dard saw a deep gully, through which a little stream\ntrickled.\n\nThey huddled together at the bottom of it, waiting, for what seemed like\na long while. Then a gentle tremor ran through the ground, and swelled\nto a sickening, heaving shock. A roar of almost palpable sound swept\nover them, and a flash of blue-white light dimmed the sun above. The\nsound, the shock, and the searing light did not pass away at once; they\ncontinued for seconds that seemed like an eternity. Earth and stones\npelted down around them; choking dust rose. Then the thunder and the\nearth-shock were over; above, incandescent vapors swirled, and darkened\ninto an overhanging pall of smoke and dust.\n\nFor a while, they crouched motionless, too stunned to speak. Then shaken\nnerves steadied and jarred brains cleared. They all rose weakly.\nTrickles of earth were still coming down from the sides of the gully,\nand the little stream, which had been clear and sparkling, was roiled\nwith mud. Mechanically, Kalvar Dard brushed the dust from his clothes\nand looked to his weapons.\n\n\"That was just the fuel-tank of a little Class-3 rocket-boat,\" he said.\n\"I wonder what the explosion of the ship was like.\" He thought for a\nmoment before continuing. \"Glav, I think I know why our jets burned out.\nWe were stern-on to the ship when she blew; the blast drove our flame\nright back through the jets.\"\n\n\"Do you think the explosion was observed from Doorsha?\" Dorita inquired,\nmore concerned about the practical aspects of the situation. \"The ship,\nI mean. After all, we have no means of communication, of our own.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't doubt it; there were observatories all around the\nplanet watching our ship,\" Kalvar Dard said. \"They probably know all\nabout it, by now. But if any of you are thinking about the chances of\nrescue, forget it. We're stuck here.\"\n\n\"That's right. There isn't another human being within fifty million\nmiles,\" Seldar Glav said. \"And that was the first and only space-ship\never built. It took fifty years to build her, and even allowing twenty\nfor research that wouldn't have to be duplicated, you can figure when we\ncan expect another one.\"\n\n\"The answer to that one is, never. The ship blew up in space; fifty\nyears' effort and fifteen hundred people gone, like that.\" Kalvar Dard\nsnapped his fingers. \"So now, they'll try to keep Doorsha habitable for\na few more thousand years by irrigation, and forget about immigrating to\nTareesh.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe, in a hundred thousand years, our descendants will build a\nship and go to Doorsha, then,\" Olva considered.\n\n\"Our descendants?\" Eldra looked at her in surprize. \"You mean, then...?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKyna chuckled. \"Eldra, you are an awful innocent, about anything that\ndoesn't have a breech-action or a recoil-mechanism,\" she said. \"Why do\nyou think the women on this expedition outnumbered the men seven to\nfive, and why do you think there were so many obstetricians and\npediatricians in the med. staff? We were sent out to put a human\npopulation on Tareesh, weren't we? Well, here we are.\"\n\n\"But.... Aren't we ever going to...?\" Varnis began. \"Won't we ever see\nanybody else, or do anything but just live here, like animals, without\nmachines or ground-cars or aircraft or houses or anything?\" Then she\nbegan to sob bitterly.\n\nAnalea, who had been cleaning a carbine that had gotten covered with\nloose earth during the explosion, laid it down and went to Varnis,\nputting her arm around the other girl and comforting her. Kalvar Dard\npicked up the carbine she had laid down.\n\n\"Now, let's see,\" he began. \"We have two heavy rifles, six carbines, and\neight pistols, and these two bags of bombs. How much ammunition,\ncounting what's in our belts, do we have?\"\n\nThey took stock of their slender resources, even Varnis joining in the\ntask, as he had hoped she would. There were over two thousand rounds for\nthe pistols, better than fifteen hundred for the carbines, and four\nhundred for the two big-game guns. They had some spare clothing, mostly\nspace-suit undergarments, enough bed-robes, one hand-axe, two\nflashlights, a first-aid kit, and three atomic lighters. Each one had a\ncombat-dagger. There was enough tinned food for about a week.\n\n\"We'll have to begin looking for game and edible plants, right away,\"\nGlav considered. \"I suppose there is game, of some sort; but our\nammunition won't last forever.\"\n\n\"We'll have to make it last as long as we can; and we'll have to begin\nimprovising weapons,\" Dard told him. \"Throwing-spears, and\nthrowing-axes. If we can find metal, or any recognizable ore that we can\nsmelt, we'll use that; if not, we'll use chipped stone. Also, we can\nlearn to make snares and traps, after we learn the habits of the animals\non this planet. By the time the ammunition's gone, we ought to have\nlearned to do without firearms.\"\n\n\"Think we ought to camp here?\"\n\nKalvar Dard shook his head. \"No wood here for fuel, and the blast will\nhave scared away all the game. We'd better go upstream; if we go down,\nwe'll find the water roiled with mud and unfit to drink. And if the game\non this planet behave like the game-herds on the wastelands of Doorsha,\nthey'll run for high ground when frightened.\"\n\nVarnis rose from where she had been sitting. Having mastered her\nemotions, she was making a deliberate effort to show it.\n\n\"Let's make up packs out of this stuff,\" she suggested. \"We can use the\nbedding and spare clothing to bundle up the food and ammunition.\"\n\nThey made up packs and slung them, then climbed out of the gully. Off to\nthe left, the grass was burning in a wide circle around the crater left\nby the explosion of the rocket-boat. Kalvar Dard, carrying one of the\nheavy rifles, took the lead. Beside and a little behind him, Analea\nwalked, her carbine ready. Glav, with the other heavy rifle, brought up\nin the rear, with Olva covering for him, and between, the other girls\nwalked, two and two.\n\nAhead, on the far horizon, was a distance-blue line of mountains. The\nlittle company turned their faces toward them and moved slowly away,\nacross the empty sea of grass.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThey had been walking, now, for five years. Kalvar Dard still led, the\nheavy rifle cradled in the crook of his left arm and a sack of bombs\nslung from his shoulder, his eyes forever shifting to right and left\nsearching for hidden danger. The clothes in which he had jumped from the\nrocket-boat were patched and ragged; his shoes had been replaced by high\nlaced buskins of smoke-tanned hide. He was bearded, now, and his hair\nhad been roughly trimmed with the edge of his dagger.\n\nAnalea still walked beside him, but her carbine was slung, and she\ncarried three spears with chipped flint heads; one heavy weapon, to be\nthrown by hand or used for stabbing, and two light javelins to be thrown\nwith the aid of the hooked throwing-stick Glav had invented. Beside her\ntrudged a four-year old boy, hers and Dard's, and on her back, in a\nfur-lined net bag, she carried their six-month-old baby.\n\nIn the rear, Glav still kept his place with the other big-game gun, and\nOlva walked beside him with carbine and spears; in front of them, their\nthree-year-old daughter toddled. Between vanguard and rearguard, the\nrest of the party walked: Varnis, carrying her baby on her back, and\nDorita, carrying a baby and leading two other children. The baby on her\nback had cost the life of Kyna in childbirth; one of the others had been\nleft motherless when Eldra had been killed by the Hairy People.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat had been two years ago, in the winter when they had used one of\ntheir two demolition-bombs to blast open a cavern in the mountains. It\nhad been a hard winter; two children had died, then--Kyna's firstborn,\nand the little son of Kalvar Dard and Dorita. It had been their first\nencounter with the Hairy People, too.\n\nEldra had gone outside the cave with one of the skin water-bags, to fill\nit at the spring. It had been after sunset, but she had carried her\npistol, and no one had thought of danger until they heard the two quick\nshots, and the scream. They had all rushed out, to find four shaggy,\nmanlike things tearing at Eldra with hands and teeth, another lying\ndead, and a sixth huddled at one side, clutching its abdomen and\nwhimpering. There had been a quick flurry of shots that had felled all\nfour of the assailants, and Seldar Glav had finished the wounded\ncreature with his dagger, but Eldra was dead. They had built a cairn of\nstones over her body, as they had done over the bodies of the two\nchildren killed by the cold. But, after an examination to see what sort\nof things they were, they had tumbled the bodies of the Hairy People\nover the cliff. These had been too bestial to bury as befitted human\ndead, but too manlike to skin and eat as game.\n\nSince then, they had often found traces of the Hairy People, and when\nthey met with them, they killed them without mercy. These were great\nshambling parodies of humanity, long-armed, short-legged, twice as heavy\nas men, with close-set reddish eyes and heavy bone-crushing jaws. They\nmay have been incredibly debased humans, or perhaps beasts on the very\nthreshold of manhood. From what he had seen of conditions on this\nplanet, Kalvar Dard suspected the latter to be the case. In a million or\nso years, they might evolve into something like humanity. Already, the\nHairy ones had learned the use of fire, and of chipped crude stone\nimplements--mostly heavy triangular choppers to be used in the hand,\nwithout helves.\n\nTwice, after that night, the Hairy People had attacked them--once while\nthey were on the march, and once in camp. Both assaults had been beaten\noff without loss to themselves, but at cost of precious ammunition. Once\nthey had caught a band of ten of them swimming a river on logs; they had\npicked them all off from the bank with their carbines. Once, when Kalvar\nDard and Analea had been scouting alone, they had come upon a dozen of\nthem huddled around a fire and had wiped them out with a single grenade.\nOnce, a large band of Hairy People hunted them for two days, but only\ntwice had they come close, and both times, a single shot had sent them\nall scampering. That had been after the bombing of the group around the\nfire. Dard was convinced that the beings possessed the rudiments of a\nlanguage, enough to communicate a few simple ideas, such as the fact\nthat this little tribe of aliens were dangerous in the extreme.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were Hairy People about now; for the past five days, moving\nnorthward through the forest to the open grasslands, the people of\nKalvar Dard had found traces of them. Now, as they came out among the\nseedling growth at the edge of the open plains, everybody was on the\nalert.\n\nThey emerged from the big trees and stopped among the young growth,\nlooking out into the open country. About a mile away, a herd of game was\ngrazing slowly westward. In the distance, they looked like the little\nhorse-like things, no higher than a man's waist and heavily maned and\nbearded, that had been one of their most important sources of meat. For\nthe ten thousandth time, Dard wished, as he strained his eyes, that\nsomebody had thought to secure a pair of binoculars when they had\nabandoned the rocket-boat. He studied the grazing herd for a long time.\n\nThe seedling pines extended almost to the game-herd and would offer\nconcealment for the approach, but the animals were grazing into the\nwind, and their scent was much keener than their vision. This would\npreclude one of their favorite hunting techniques, that of lurking in the\nhigh grass ahead of the quarry. It had rained heavily in the past few\ndays, and the undermat of dead grass was soaked, making a fire-hunt\nimpossible. Kalvar Dard knew that he could stalk to within easy\ncarbine-shot, but he was unwilling to use cartridges on game; and in\nview of the proximity of Hairy People, he did not want to divide his\nband for a drive hunt.\n\n\"What's the scheme?\" Analea asked him, realizing the problem as well as\nhe did. \"Do we try to take them from behind?\"\n\n\"We'll take them from an angle,\" he decided. \"We'll start from here and\nwork in, closing on them at the rear of the herd. Unless the wind shifts\non us, we ought to get within spear-cast. You and I will use the spears;\nVarnis can come along and cover for us with a carbine. Glav, you and\nOlva and Dorita stay here with the children and the packs. Keep a sharp\nlookout; Hairy People around, somewhere.\" He unslung his rifle and\nexchanged it for Olva's spears. \"We can only eat about two of them\nbefore the meat begins to spoil, but kill all you can,\" he told Analea;\n\"we need the skins.\"\n\nThen he and the two girls began their slow, cautious, stalk. As long as\nthe grassland was dotted with young trees, they walked upright, making\ngood time, but the last five hundred yards they had to crawl, stopping\noften to check the wind, while the horse-herd drifted slowly by. Then\nthey were directly behind the herd, with the wind in their faces, and\nthey advanced more rapidly.\n\n\"Close enough?\" Dard whispered to Analea.\n\n\"Yes; I'm taking the one that's lagging a little behind.\"\n\n\"I'm taking the one on the left of it.\" Kalvar Dard fitted a javelin to\nthe hook of his throwing-stick. \"Ready? Now!\"\n\nHe leaped to his feet, drawing back his right arm and hurling, the\nthrowing-stick giving added velocity to the spear. Beside him, he was\nconscious of Analea rising and propelling her spear. His missile caught\nthe little bearded pony in the chest; it stumbled and fell forward to\nits front knees. He snatched another light spear, set it on the hook of\nthe stick and darted it at another horse, which reared, biting at the\nspear with its teeth. Grabbing the heavy stabbing-spear, he ran forward,\nfinishing it off with a heart-thrust. As he did, Varnis slung her\ncarbine, snatched a stone-headed throwing axe from her belt, and knocked\ndown another horse, then ran forward with her dagger to finish it.\n\nBy this time, the herd, alarmed, had stampeded and was galloping away,\nleaving the dead and dying behind. He and Analea had each killed two;\nwith the one Varnis had knocked down, that made five. Using his dagger,\nhe finished off one that was still kicking on the ground, and then began\npulling out the throwing-spears. The girls, shouting in unison, were\nannouncing the successful completion of the hunt; Glav, Olva, and Dorita\nwere coming forward with the children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was sunset by the time they had finished the work of skinning and\ncutting up the horses and had carried the hide-wrapped bundles of meat\nto the little brook where they had intended camping. There was firewood\nto be gathered, and the meal to be cooked, and they were all tired.\n\n\"We can't do this very often, any more,\" Kalvar Dard told them, \"but we\nmight as well, tonight. Don't bother rubbing sticks for fire; I'll use\nthe lighter.\"\n\nHe got it from a pouch on his belt--a small, gold-plated, atomic\nlighter, bearing the crest of his old regiment of the Frontier Guards.\nIt was the last one they had, in working order. Piling a handful of dry\nsplinters under the firewood, he held the lighter to it, pressed the\nactivator, and watched the fire eat into the wood.\n\nThe greatest achievement of man's civilization, the mastery of the\nbasic, cosmic, power of the atom--being used to kindle a fire of natural\nfuel, to cook unseasoned meat killed with stone-tipped spears. Dard\nlooked sadly at the twinkling little gadget, then slipped it back into\nits pouch. Soon it would be worn out, like the other two, and then they\nwould gain fire only by rubbing dry sticks, or hacking sparks from bits\nof flint or pyrites. Soon, too, the last cartridge would be fired, and\nthen they would perforce depend for protection, as they were already\ndoing for food, upon their spears.\n\nAnd they were so helpless. Six adults, burdened with seven little\nchildren, all of them requiring momently care and watchfulness. If the\ncartridges could be made to last until they were old enough to fend for\nthemselves.... If they could avoid collisions with the Hairy People....\nSome day, they would be numerous enough for effective mutual protection\nand support; some day, the ratio of helpless children to able adults\nwould redress itself. Until then, all that they could do would be to\nsurvive; day after day, they must follow the game-herds.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nFor twenty years, now, they had been following the game. Winters had\ncome, with driving snow, forcing horses and deer into the woods, and the\nlittle band of humans to the protection of mountain caves. Springtime\nfollowed, with fresh grass on the plains and plenty of meat for the\npeople of Kalvar Dard. Autumns followed summers, with fire-hunts, and\nthe smoking and curing of meat and hides. Winters followed autumns, and\nspringtimes came again, and thus until the twentieth year after the\nlanding of the rocket-boat.\n\nKalvar Dard still walked in the lead, his hair and beard flecked with\ngray, but he no longer carried the heavy rifle; the last cartridge for\nthat had been fired long ago. He carried the hand-axe, fitted with a\nlong helve, and a spear with a steel head that had been worked painfully\nfrom the receiver of a useless carbine. He still had his pistol, with\neight cartridges in the magazine, and his dagger, and the bomb-bag,\ncontaining the big demolition-bomb and one grenade. The last shred of\nclothing from the ship was gone, now; he was clad in a sleeveless tunic\nof skin and horsehide buskins.\n\nAnalea no longer walked beside him; eight years before, she had broken\nher back in a fall. It had been impossible to move her, and she stabbed\nherself with her dagger to save a cartridge. Seldar Glav had broken\nthrough the ice while crossing a river, and had lost his rifle; the next\nday he died of the chill he had taken. Olva had been killed by the Hairy\nPeople, the night they had attacked the camp, when Varnis' child had\nbeen killed.\n\nThey had beaten off that attack, shot or speared ten of the huge\nsub-men, and the next morning they buried their dead after their custom,\nunder cairns of stone. Varnis had watched the burial of her child with\nblank, uncomprehending eyes, then she had turned to Kalvar Dard and said\nsomething that had horrified him more than any wild outburst of grief\ncould have.\n\n\"Come on, Dard; what are we doing this for? You promised you'd take us\nto Tareesh, where we'd have good houses, and machines, and all sorts of\nlovely things to eat and wear. I don't like this place, Dard; I want to\ngo to Tareesh.\"\n\nFrom that day on, she had wandered in merciful darkness. She had not\nbeen idiotic, or raving mad; she had just escaped from a reality that\nshe could no longer bear.\n\nVarnis, lost in her dream-world, and Dorita, hard-faced and haggard,\nwere the only ones left, beside Kalvar Dard, of the original eight. But\nthe band had grown, meanwhile, to more than fifteen. In the rear, in\nSeldar Glav's old place, the son of Kalvar Dard and Analea walked. Like\nhis father, he wore a pistol, for which he had six rounds, and a dagger,\nand in his hand he carried a stone-headed killing-maul with a three-foot\nhandle which he had made for himself. The woman who walked beside him\nand carried his spears was the daughter of Glav and Olva; in a net-bag\non her back she carried their infant child. The first Tareeshan born of\nTareeshan parents; Kalvar Dard often looked at his little grandchild\nduring nights in camp and days on the trail, seeing, in that tiny\nfur-swaddled morsel of humanity, the meaning and purpose of all that he\ndid. Of the older girls, one or two were already pregnant, now; this\ntiny threatened beachhead of humanity was expanding, gaining strength.\nLong after man had died out on Doorsha and the dying planet itself had\nbecome an arid waste, the progeny of this little band would continue to\ngrow and to dominate the younger planet, nearer the sun. Some day, an\neven mightier civilization than the one he had left would rise here....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day the trail had wound upward into the mountains. Great cliffs\nloomed above them, and little streams spumed and dashed in rocky gorges\nbelow. All day, the Hairy People had followed, fearful to approach too\nclose, unwilling to allow their enemies to escape. It had started when\nthey had rushed the camp, at daybreak; they had been beaten off, at cost\nof almost all the ammunition, and the death of one child. No sooner had\nthe tribe of Kalvar Dard taken the trail, however, than they had been\npressing after them. Dard had determined to cross the mountains, and had\nled his people up a game-trail, leading toward the notch of a pass high\nagainst the skyline.\n\nThe shaggy ape-things seemed to have divined his purpose. Once or\ntwice, he had seen hairy brown shapes dodging among the rocks and\nstunted trees to the left. They were trying to reach the pass ahead of\nhim. Well, if they did.... He made a quick mental survey of his\nresources. His pistol, and his son's, and Dorita's, with eight, and six,\nand seven rounds. One grenade, and the big demolition bomb, too powerful\nto be thrown by hand, but which could be set for delayed explosion and\ndropped over a cliff or left behind to explode among pursuers. Five\nsteel daggers, and plenty of spears and slings and axes. Himself, his\nson and his son's woman, Dorita, and four or five of the older boys and\ngirls, who would make effective front-line fighters. And Varnis, who\nmight come out of her private dream-world long enough to give account\nfor herself, and even the tiniest of the walking children could throw\nstones or light spears. Yes, they could force the pass, if the Hairy\nPeople reached it ahead of them, and then seal it shut with the heavy\nbomb. What lay on the other side, he did not know; he wondered how much\ngame there would be, and if there were Hairy People on that side, too.\n\nTwo shots slammed quickly behind him. He dropped his axe and took a\ntwo-hand grip on his stabbing-spear as he turned. His son was hurrying\nforward, his pistol drawn, glancing behind as he came.\n\n\"Hairy People. Four,\" he reported. \"I shot two; she threw a spear and\nkilled another. The other ran.\"\n\nThe daughter of Seldar Glav and Olva nodded in agreement.\n\n\"I had no time to throw again,\" she said, \"and Bo-Bo would not shoot the\none that ran.\"\n\nKalvar Dard's son, who had no other name than the one his mother had\ncalled him as a child, defended himself. \"He was running away. It is the\nrule: _use bullets only to save life, where a spear will not serve_.\"\n\nKalvar Dard nodded. \"You did right, son,\" he said, taking out his own\npistol and removing the magazine, from which he extracted two\ncartridges. \"Load these into your pistol; four rounds aren't enough. Now\nwe each have six. Go back to the rear, keep the little ones moving, and\ndon't let Varnis get behind.\"\n\n\"That is right. _We must all look out for Varnis, and take care of\nher_,\" the boy recited obediently. \"That is the rule.\"\n\nHe dropped to the rear. Kalvar Dard holstered his pistol and picked up\nhis axe, and the column moved forward again. They were following a\nledge, now; on the left, there was a sheer drop of several hundred feet,\nand on the right a cliff rose above them, growing higher and steeper as\nthe trail slanted upward. Dard was worried about the ledge; if it came\nto an end, they would all be trapped. No one would escape. He suddenly\nfelt old and unutterably weary. It was a frightful weight that he\nbore--responsibility for an entire race.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, behind him, Dorita fired her pistol upward. Dard sprang\nforward--there was no room for him to jump aside--and drew his pistol.\nThe boy, Bo-Bo, was trying to find a target from his position in the\nrear. Then Dard saw the two Hairy People; the boy fired, and the stone\nfell, all at once.\n\nIt was a heavy stone, half as big as a man's torso, and it almost missed\nKalvar Dard. If it had hit him directly, it would have killed him\ninstantly, mashing him to a bloody pulp; as it was, he was knocked flat,\nthe stone pinning his legs.\n\nAt Bo-Bo's shot, a hairy body plummeted down, to hit the ledge. Bo-Bo's\nwoman instantly ran it through with one of her spears. The other\nape-thing, the one Dorita had shot, was still clinging to a rock above.\nTwo of the children scampered up to it and speared it repeatedly,\nscreaming like little furies. Dorita and one of the older girls got the\nrock off Kalvar Dard's legs and tried to help him to his feet, but he\ncollapsed, unable to stand. Both his legs were broken.\n\nThis was it, he thought, sinking back. \"Dorita, I want you to run ahead\nand see what the trail's like,\" he said. \"See if the ledge is passable.\nAnd find a place, not too far ahead, where we can block the trail by\nexploding that demolition-bomb. It has to be close enough for a couple\nof you to carry or drag me and get me there in one piece.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\" he retorted. \"I have both legs broken. You can't\ncarry me with you; if you try it, they'll catch us and kill us all. I'll\nhave to stay behind; I'll block the trail behind you, and get as many of\nthem as I can, while I'm at it. Now, run along and do as I said.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I'll be back as soon as I can,\" she agreed.\n\nThe others were crowding around Dard. Bo-Bo bent over him, perplexed and\nworried. \"What are you going to do, father?\" he asked. \"You are hurt.\nAre you going to go away and leave us, as mother did when she was hurt?\"\n\n\"Yes, son; I'll have to. You carry me on ahead a little, when Dorita\ngets back, and leave me where she shows you to. I'm going to stay behind\nand block the trail, and kill a few Hairy People. I'll use the big\nbomb.\"\n\n\"The _big_ bomb? The one nobody dares throw?\" The boy looked at his\nfather in wonder.\n\n\"That's right. Now, when you leave me, take the others and get away as\nfast as you can. Don't stop till you're up to the pass. Take my pistol\nand dagger, and the axe and the big spear, and take the little bomb,\ntoo. Take everything I have, only leave the big bomb with me. I'll need\nthat.\"\n\nDorita rejoined them. \"There's a waterfall ahead. We can get around it,\nand up to the pass. The way's clear and easy; if you put off the bomb\njust this side of it, you'll start a rock-slide that'll block\neverything.\"\n\n\"All right. Pick me up, a couple of you. Don't take hold of me below the\nknees. And hurry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hairy shape appeared on the ledge below them; one of the older boys\nused his throwing-stick to drive a javelin into it. Two of the girls\npicked up Dard; Bo-Bo and his woman gathered up the big spear and the\naxe and the bomb-bag.\n\nThey hurried forward, picking their way along the top of a talus of\nrubble at the foot of the cliff, and came to where the stream gushed out\nof a narrow gorge. The air was wet with spray there, and loud with the\nroar of the waterfall. Kalvar Dard looked around; Dorita had chosen the\nspot well. Not even a sure-footed mountain-goat could make the ascent,\nonce that gorge was blocked.\n\n\"All right; put me down here,\" he directed. \"Bo-Bo, take my belt, and\ngive me the big bomb. You have one light grenade; know how to use it?\"\n\n\"Of course, you have often showed me. I turn the top, and then press in\nthe little thing on the side, and hold it in till I throw. I throw it at\nleast a spear-cast, and drop to the ground or behind something.\"\n\n\"That's right. And use it only in greatest danger, to save everybody.\nSpare your cartridges; use them only to save life. And save everything\nof metal, no matter how small.\"\n\n\"Yes. Those are the rules. I will follow them, and so will the others.\nAnd we will always take care of Varnis.\"\n\n\"Well, goodbye, son.\" He gripped the boy's hand. \"Now get everybody out\nof here; don't stop till you're at the pass.\"\n\n\"You're not staying behind!\" Varnis cried. \"Dard, you promised us! I\nremember, when we were all in the ship together--you and I and Analea\nand Olva and Dorita and Eldra and, oh, what was that other girl's name,\nKyna! And we were all having such a nice time, and you were telling us\nhow we'd all come to Tareesh, and we were having such fun talking about\nit....\"\n\n\"That's right, Varnis,\" he agreed. \"And so I will. I have something to\ndo, here, but I'll meet you on top of the mountain, after I'm through,\nand in the morning we'll all go to Tareesh.\"\n\nShe smiled--the gentle, childlike smile of the harmlessly mad--and\nturned away. The son of Kalvar Dard made sure that she and all the\nchildren were on the way, and then he, too, turned and followed them,\nleaving Dard alone.\n\nAlone, with a bomb and a task. He'd borne that task for twenty years,\nnow; in a few minutes, it would be ended, with an instant's searing\nheat. He tried not to be too glad; there were so many things he might\nhave done, if he had tried harder. Metals, for instance. Somewhere there\nsurely must be ores which they could have smelted, but he had never\nfound them. And he might have tried catching some of the little horses\nthey hunted for food, to break and train to bear burdens. And the\nalphabet--why hadn't he taught it to Bo-Bo and the daughter of Seldar\nGlav, and laid on them an obligation to teach the others? And the\ngrass-seeds they used for making flour sometimes; they should have\nplanted fields of the better kinds, and patches of edible roots, and\nreturned at the proper time to harvest them. There were so many things,\nthings that none of those young savages or their children would think of\nin ten thousand years....\n\nSomething was moving among the rocks, a hundred yards away. He\nstraightened, as much as his broken legs would permit, and watched. Yes,\nthere was one of them, and there was another, and another. One rose from\nbehind a rock and came forward at a shambling run, making bestial\nsounds. Then two more lumbered into sight, and in a moment the ravine\nwas alive with them. They were almost upon him when Kalvar Dard pressed\nin the thumbpiece of the bomb; they were clutching at him when he\nreleased it. He felt a slight jar....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen they reached the pass, they all stopped as the son of Kalvar Dard\nturned and looked back. Dorita stood beside him, looking toward the\nwaterfall too; she also knew what was about to happen. The others merely\ngaped in blank incomprehension, or grasped their weapons, thinking that\nthe enemy was pressing close behind and that they were making a stand\nhere. A few of the smaller boys and girls began picking up stones.\n\nThen a tiny pin-point of brilliance winked, just below where the\nsnow-fed stream vanished into the gorge. That was all, for an instant,\nand then a great fire-shot cloud swirled upward, hundreds of feet into\nthe air; there was a crash, louder than any sound any of them except\nDorita and Varnis had ever heard before.\n\n\"He did it!\" Dorita said softly.\n\n\"Yes, he did it. My father was a brave man,\" Bo-Bo replied. \"We are\nsafe, now.\"\n\nVarnis, shocked by the explosion, turned and stared at him, and then she\nlaughed happily. \"Why, there you are, Dard!\" she exclaimed. \"I was\nwondering where you'd gone. What did you do, after we left?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" The boy was puzzled, not knowing how much he looked\nlike his father, when his father had been an officer of the Frontier\nGuards, twenty years before.\n\nHis puzzlement worried Varnis vaguely. \"You.... You are Dard, aren't\nyou?\" she asked. \"But that's silly; of course you're Dard! Who else\ncould you be?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am Dard,\" the boy said, remembering that it was the rule for\neverybody to be kind to Varnis and to pretend to agree with her. Then\nanother thought struck him. His shoulders straightened. \"Yes. I am Dard,\nson of Dard,\" he told them all. \"I lead, now. Does anybody say no?\"\n\nHe shifted his axe and spear to his left hand and laid his right hand on\nthe butt of his pistol, looking sternly at Dorita. If any of them tried\nto dispute his claim, it would be she. But instead, she gave him the\nnearest thing to a real smile that had crossed her face in years.\n\n\"You are Dard,\" she told him; \"you lead us, now.\"\n\n\"But of course Dard leads! Hasn't he always led us?\" Varnis wanted to\nknow. \"Then what's all the argument about? And tomorrow he's going to\ntake us to Tareesh, and we'll have houses and ground-cars and aircraft\nand gardens and lights, and all the lovely things we want. Aren't you,\nDard?\"\n\n\"Yes, Varnis; I will take you all to Tareesh, to all the wonderful\nthings,\" Dard, son of Dard, promised, for such was the rule about\nVarnis.\n\nThen he looked down from the pass into the country beyond. There were\nlower mountains, below, and foothills, and a wide blue valley, and,\nbeyond that, distant peaks reared jaggedly against the sky. He pointed\nwith his father's axe.\n\n\"We go down that way,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo they went, down, and on, and on, and on. The last cartridge was\nfired; the last sliver of Doorshan metal wore out or rusted away. By\nthen, however, they had learned to make chipped stone, and bone, and\nreindeer-horn, serve their needs. Century after century, millennium\nafter millennium, they followed the game-herds from birth to death, and\nbirth replenished their numbers faster than death depleted. Bands grew\nin numbers and split; young men rebelled against the rule of the old and\ntook their women and children elsewhere.\n\nThey hunted down the hairy Neanderthalers, and exterminated them\nruthlessly, the origin of their implacable hatred lost in legend. All\nthat they remembered, in the misty, confused, way that one remembers a\ndream, was that there had once been a time of happiness and plenty, and\nthat there was a goal to which they would some day attain. They left the\nmountains--were they the Caucasus? The Alps? The Pamirs?--and spread\noutward, conquering as they went.\n\nWe find their bones, and their stone weapons, and their crude paintings,\nin the caves of Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi and Altimira and Mas-d'Azil; the\ndeep layers of horse and reindeer and mammoth bones at their\nfeasting-place at Solutre. We wonder how and whence a race so like our\nown came into a world of brutish sub-humans.\n\nJust as we wonder, too, at the network of canals which radiate from the\npolar caps of our sister planet, and speculate on the possibility that\nthey were the work of hands like our own. And we concoct elaborate jokes\nabout the \"Men From Mars\"--_ourselves_.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED\n\nThe following typographical errors in the text were corrected as\ndetailed here.\n\nIn the text: \"... an automatic computer figured the distance to the\nplanet,...\" the word \"computor\" was corrected to \"computer.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Then, with every atom of strength they possessed they ran\naway ...,\" the word \"posessed\" was corrected to \"possessed.\"\n\nIn two places in the text \"Anelea\" was corrected to \"Analea.\"\n\nIn the text: \"If they could avoid collisions with the Hairy People...\"\nthe word \"collisons\" was corrected to \"collisions.\"\n\nIn the text: \"Some day, an even mightier civilization than the one he\nhad left would rise here ...\" the word \"that\" was corrected to \"than.\"\n\nIn the text: \"There had been a quick flurry of shots that had felled all\nfour of the assailants, and Seldar Glav had finished...\" the word \"Klav\"\nwas corrected to \"Glav.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Genesis, by H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
