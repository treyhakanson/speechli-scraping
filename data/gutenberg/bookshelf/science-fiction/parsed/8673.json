You\nsmile because you have never heard his name, for, until now, his\nbiography has not been written. And this is not truly a biography; it is\nonly the story of the crowning event in Stonewall's career.\n\nReally it humbles one's pride of race to see how ignorant the world is of\nits true heroes. Many a man who cuts a great figure in history is, after\nall, a poor specimen of humanity, slavishly following old ruts, destitute\nof any real originality, and remarkable only for some exaggeration of the\ncommonplace. But in the case of Edmund Stonewall the world cannot be\nblamed for its ignorance, because, as I have already said, his story\nremains to be written, and hitherto it has been guarded as a profound\nsecret.\n\nI do not wish to exaggerate; yet I cannot avoid seeming to do so in\nsimply telling the facts. If Stonewall's proceedings had become\nMatter  of common knowledge the world would have been--I must speak\nplainly--revolutionized. He held in his hands the means of realizing the\nwildest dreams of power, wealth, and human mastery over the forces of\nnature, that any enthusiast ever treasured in his prophetic soul. It was\na part of his originality that he never entertained the thought of\nemploying his advantage in any such way. His character was entirely free\nfrom the ordinary forms of avidity. He cared nothing for wealth in\nitself, and as little for fame. All his energies were concentrated upon\nthe attainment of ends which nobody but himself would have regarded as of\nany practical importance. Thus it happened that, having made an invention\nwhich would have put every human industry upon a new footing, and\nmultiplied beyond the limits of calculation the activities and\nachievements of mankind, this extraordinary person turned his back upon\nthe colossal fortune which he had but to stretch forth his hand and\ngrasp, refused to seize the unlimited power which his genius had laid at\nhis feet, and used his unparalleled discovery for a purpose so eccentric,\nso wildly unpractical, so utterly beyond the pale of waking life, that to\nany ordinary man he must have seemed a lunatic lost in an endless dream\nof bedlam. And to this day I cannot, without a nervous thrill, think how\nthe desire of all the ages, the ideal that has been the loadstar for\nthousands of philosophers, savants, inventors, prophets, and dreamers,\nwas actually realized upon the earth; and yet of all its fifteen hundred\nmillion inhabitants but a single one knew it, possessed it, controlled\nit--and he would not reveal it, but hoarded and used his knowledge for\nthe accomplishment of the craziest design that ever took shape in a human\nbrain.\n\nNow, to be more specific. Of Stonewall's antecedents I know very little.\nI only know that, in a moderate way, he was wealthy, and that he had no\nimmediate family ties. He was somewhere near thirty years of age, and\nheld the diploma of one of our oldest universities. But he was not, in a\ngeneral way, sociable, and I never knew him to attend any of the reunions\nof his former classmates, or to show the slightest interest in any of the\nevents or functions of society, although its doors were open to him\nthrough some distant relatives who were widely connected in New York, and\nwho at times tried to draw him into their circle. He would certainly have\nadorned it, but it had no attraction for him. Nevertheless he was a\nmember of the Olympus Club, where he frequently spent his evenings. But\nhe made very few acquaintances even there, and I believe that except\nmyself, Jack Ashton, Henry Darton, and Will Church, he had no intimates.\nAnd we knew him only at the club. There, when he was alone with us, he\nsometimes partly opened up his mind, and we were charmed by his variety\nof knowledge and the singularity of his conversation. I shall not\ndisguise the fact that we thought him extremely eccentric, although the\nidea of anything in the nature of insanity never entered our heads. We\nknew that he was engaged in recondite researches of a scientific nature,\nand that he possessed a private laboratory, although none of us had ever\nentered it. Occasionally he would speak of some new advance of science,\nthrowing a flood of light by his clear expositions upon things of which\nwe should otherwise have remained profoundly ignorant. His imagination\nflashed like lightning over the subject of his talk, revealing it at the\nmost unexpected angles, and often he roused us to real enthusiasm for\nthings the very names of which we almost forgot amidst the next day's\noccupations.\n\nThere was one subject on which he was particularly\neloquent--radioactivity; that most strange property of matter whose\ndiscovery had been the crowning glory of science in the closing decade of\nthe nineteenth century. None of us really knew anything about it except\nwhat Stonewall taught us. If some new incomprehensible announcement\nappeared in the newspapers we skipped it, being sure that Edmund would\nmake it all clear at the club in the evening. He made us understand, in a\ndim way, that some vast, tremendous secret lay behind it all. I recall\nhis saying, on one occasion, not long before the blow fell:\n\n\"Listen to this! Here's Professor Thomson declaring that a single grain\nof radium contains in its padlocked atoms energy enough to lift a million\ntons three hundred yards high. Professor Thomson is too modest in his\nestimates, and he hasn't the ghost of an idea how to get at that energy.\nNeither has Professor Rutherford, nor Lord Kelvin; _but somebody will get\nat it, just the same_.\"\n\nHe positively thrilled us when he spoke thus, for there was a look in his\neyes which seemed to penetrate depths unfathomable to our intelligence.\nYet we had not the faintest conception of what was really passing in his\nmind. If we had understood it, if we had caught a single clear glimpse of\nthe workings of his intellect, we should have been appalled. And if we\nhad known how close we stood to the verge of an abyss of mystery about to\nbe lighted by such a gleam as had never before been emitted from the\nhuman spirit, I believe that we would have started from our chairs and\nfled in dismay.\n\nBut we understood nothing, except that Edmund was indulging in one of his\neccentric dreams, and Jack, in his large, careless, good-natured way\nbroke in with:\n\n\"Well, Edmund, suppose _you_ could 'get at it,' as you say; what would\nyou do with it?\"\n\nStonewall's eyes gleamed for a moment, and then he replied, with a\ncurious emphasis:\n\n\"I might do what Archimedes dreamed of.\"\n\nNone of us happened to remember what it was that Archimedes had dreamed,\nand the subject was dropped.\n\nFor a considerable time afterwards we saw nothing of Stonewall. He did\nnot come to the club, and we were beginning to think of looking him up,\nwhen one evening, quite unexpectedly, he dropped in, wearing an unusually\ncheerful expression. We had greatly missed him, and we now greeted him\nwith effusion. His animation impressed us all, and he had no sooner\nshaken hands than he said, with suppressed excitement in his voice:\n\n\"Well, I've 'got at it.'\"\n\n\"Got at what?\" drawled Jack.\n\n\"The inter-atomic energy. I've got it under control.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have!\" said Jack.\n\n\"Yes, I've arrived where a certain professor dreamed of being when he\naverred that 'when man knows that every breath of air he draws has\ncontained within itself force enough to drive the workshops of the world\nhe will find out some day, somehow, some way of tapping that energy.' The\nthing is done, for I've tapped it!\"\n\nWe stared at one another, not knowing what to say, except Jack, who,\ninspired by the spirit of mischief, drawled out:\n\n\"Ah, yes, I remember. Well then, Edmund, as I asked you before, what are\nyou going to do with it?\"\n\nThere was not really any thought among us of poking fun at Edmund; we\nrespected and admired him far too much for that; nevertheless, catching\nthe infection of banter from Jack, we united in demanding, in a manner\nwhich I can now see must have appeared most provoking:\n\n\"Why, yes, Edmund, tell us what you are going to do with it.\"\n\nAnd then Jack added fuel by mockingly, though with perfectly good-natured\nintention, taking Edmund by the hand and swinging him in front of us\nwith:\n\n\"Gentlemen, Archimedes junior.\"\n\nStonewall's eyes flashed and his cheek darkened, but for a moment he said\nnothing. Presently, with a return of his former affability, he said:\n\n\"I wish you would come over to the laboratory and let me show you what I\nam going to do.\"\n\nOf course we instantly assented. Nothing could have pleased us better\nthan this invitation, for we had long been dying to see the inside of\nEdmund's laboratory. We all got our hats and started out with him. We\nknew where he lived, occupying a whole house though he was a bachelor,\nbut none of us had ever seen the inside of it, and our curiosity was on\nthe _qui vive_. He led us through a handsome hallway and a rear apartment\ndirectly into the back yard, half of which we were surprised to find\ninclosed and roofed over, forming a huge shanty, like a workshop. Edmund\nopened the door of the shanty and ushered us in.\n\nA remarkable object at once concentrated our attention. In the center of\nthe place was the queerest-looking thing that you can well imagine. I can\nhardly describe it. It was round and elongated like a boiler, with\nbulging ends, and seemed to be made of polished steel. Its total length\nwas about eighteen feet, and its width ten feet. Edmund approached it and\nopened a door in the end, which was wide and high enough for us to enter\nwithout stooping or crowding.\n\n\"Step in, gentlemen,\" he said, and unhesitatingly we obeyed him, all\nexcept Church, who for some unknown reason remained outside, and when we\nlooked for him had disappeared.\n\nEdmund turned on a bright light, and we found ourselves in an\noblong chamber, beautifully fitted up with polished woodwork, and\nleather-cushioned seats running round the sides. Many metallic knobs and\nhandles shone on the walls.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Edmund, \"and I will tell you what I have got here.\"\n\nHe stepped to the door and called again for Church but there was no\nanswer. We concluded that, thinking the thing would be too deep to be\ninteresting, he had gone back to the club. That was not what he had done,\nas you will learn later, but he never regretted what he did do. Getting\nno response from Church, Edmund finally sat down with us on one of the\nleather-covered benches, and began his explanation.\n\n\"As I was telling you at the club,\" he said, \"I've solved the mystery of\nthe atoms. I'm sure you'll excuse me from explaining my method\" (there\nwas a little raillery in his manner), \"but at least you can understand\nthe plain statement that I've got unlimited power at my command. These\nknobs and handles that you see are my keys for turning it on and off, and\ncontrolling it as I wish. Mark you, this power comes right out of the\nheart of what we call matter; the world is chock full of it. We have\nknown that it was there at least ever since radioactivity was discovered,\nbut it looked as though human intelligence would never be able to set it\nfree from its prison. Nevertheless I have not only set it free, but I am\nable to control it as perfectly as if it were steam from a boiler, or an\nelectric current from a dynamo.\"\n\nJack, who was as unscientific a person as ever lived, yawned, and Edmund\nnoticed it. But he showed no irritation, merely smiling, and saying, with\na wink at me and Henry:\n\n\"Even this seems to be rather too deep, so perhaps I had better show you,\ninstead of telling you, what I mean. Excuse me a moment.\"\n\nHe stepped out of the door, and we remained seated. We heard a noise\noutside like the opening of a barn door, and immediately Edmund\nreappeared and closed the door of the chamber in which we were. We\nwatched him with growing curiosity. With a singular smile he pressed a\nknob on the wall, and instantly we felt that the chamber was rising in\nthe air. It rocked a little like a boat in wavy water. We were startled,\nof course, but not alarmed.\n\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed Jack. \"What kind of a balloon is this?\"\n\n\"It's something more than a balloon,\" was Edmund's reply, and as he spoke\nhe touched another knob, and we felt the car, as I must now call it, come\nto rest. Then Edmund opened a shutter at one side, and we all sprang up\nto look out. Below us we saw roofs and the tops of two trees standing at\nthe side of the street.\n\n\"We're about a hundred feet up,\" said Edmund quietly. \"What do you think\nof it now?\"\n\n\"Wonderful! wonderful!\" we exclaimed in a breath. And I continued:\n\n\"And do you say that it is inter-atomic energy that does this?\"\n\n\"Nothing else in the world,\" returned Edmund.\n\nBut bantering Jack must have his quip:\n\n\"By the way, Edmund,\" he demanded, \"what was it that Archimedes dreamed?\nBut no matter; you've knocked him silly. Now, what are you going to do\nwith your atomic balloon?\"\n\nEdmund's eyes flashed:\n\n\"You'll see in a minute.\"\n\nThe scene out of the window was beautiful, and for a moment we all\nremained watching it. The city lights were nearly all below our level,\nand away off over the New Jersey horizon I noticed the planet Venus, near\nto setting, but as brilliant as a diamond. I am fond of star-gazing, and\nI called Edmund's attention to the planet as he happened to be standing\nnext to me.\n\n\"Lovely, isn't she?\" he said with enthusiasm. \"The finest world in the\nsolar system, and what a strange thing that she should have one side\nalways day and the other always night.\"\n\nI was surprised by his exhibition of astronomic lore, for I had never\nknown that he had given any attention to the subject, but a minute later\nthe incident was forgotten as Edmund suddenly pushed us back from the\nwindow and closed the shutter.\n\n\"Going down again so soon?\" asked Jack.\n\nEdmund smiled. \"Going,\" he said simply, and put his hand to one of the\nknobs. Immediately we felt ourselves moving very slowly.\n\n\"That's right, Edmund,\" put in Jack again, \"let us down easy; I don't\nlike bumps.\"\n\nWe expected at each instant to feel the car touch the cradle in which it\nhad evidently rested, but never were three mortals so mistaken. What\nreally did happen can better be described in the words of Will Church,\nwho, you will remember, had disappeared at the beginning of our singular\nadventure. I got the account from him long afterwards. He had written it\nout carefully and put it away in a safe, as a sort of historic document.\nHere is Church's narrative, omitting the introduction, which read like a\nlaw paper:\n\n\"When we went over from the club to Stonewall's house, I dropped behind\nthe others, because the four of them took up the whole width of the\nsidewalk. Stonewall was talking to them, and my attention was attracted\nby something uncommon in his manner. He had an indefinable carriage of\nthe head which suggested to me the suspicion that everything was not just\nas it should be. I don't mean that I thought him crazy, or anything of\nthat kind, but I felt that he had some scheme in his mind to fool us.\n\n\"I bitterly repented, after things turned out as they did, that I had not\nwhispered a word to the others. But that would have been difficult, and,\nbesides, I had no idea of the seriousness of the affair. Nevertheless, I\ndetermined to stay out of it, so that the laugh should not be on me at\nany rate. Accordingly when the others entered the car I stayed outside,\nand when Stonewall called me I did not answer.\n\n\"When he came out to open the roof of the shed, he did not see me in the\nshadow where I stood. The opening of the roof revealed the whole scheme\nin a flash. I had had no suspicion that the car was any kind of a\nballoon, and even after he had so significantly thrown the roof open, and\nthen entered the car and closed the door, I was fairly amazed to see the\nthing began to rise without the slightest noise, and as if it were\nenchanted. It really looked diabolical as it floated silently upward and\npassed through the opening, and the sight gave me a shiver.\n\n\"But I was greatly relieved when it stopped at a height of a hundred feet\nor so, and then I said to myself that I should have been less of a fool\nif I had stayed with the others, for now they would have the laugh on me\nalone. Suddenly, while I watched, expecting every moment to see them drop\ndown again, for I supposed that it was merely an experiment to show that\nthe thing would float, the car started upward, very slowly at first, but\nincreasing its speed until it had attained an elevation of perhaps five\nhundred feet. There it hung for a moment, like some mail-clad monster\nglinting in the quavering light of the street arcs, and then, without\nwarning, made a dart skyward. For a minute it circled like a strange bird\ntaking its bearings, and finally rushed off westward until I lost sight\nof it behind some tall buildings. I ran into the house to reach the\nstreet, but found the outer door locked, and not a person visible. I\ncalled but nobody came. Returning to the yard I discovered a place where\nI could get over the fence, and so I escaped into the street. Immediately\nI searched the sky for the mysterious car, but could see no sign of it.\nThey were gone! I almost sank upon the pavement in a state of helpless\nexcitement, which I could not have explained to myself if I had stopped\nto reason; for why, after all, should I take the thing so tragically. But\nsomething within me said that all was wrong. A policeman happened to\npass.\n\n\"'Officer! officer!' I shouted, 'have you seen it?'\n\n\"'Seen what?' asked the blue-coat, twirling his club.\n\n\"'The car--the balloon,' I stammered.\n\n\"'Balloon in your head! You're drunk. Get long out o' here!'\n\n\"I realized the impossibility of explaining the matter to him, and\nrunning back to the place where I had got over the fence I climbed into\nthe yard and entered the shed. Fortunately the policeman paid no further\nattention to my movements after I left him. I sat down on the empty\ncradle and stared up through the opening in the roof, hoping against hope\nto see them coming back. It must have been midnight before I gave up my\nvigil in despair, and went home, sorely puzzled, and blaming myself for\nhaving kept my suspicions unuttered. I finally got to sleep, but I had\nhorrible dreams.\n\n\"The next day I was up early looking through all the papers in the hope\nof finding something about the car. But there was not a word. I watched\nthe news columns for several days without result. Whenever the coast was\nclear I haunted Stonewall's yard, but the fatal shed yawned empty, and\nthere was not a soul about the house. I cannot describe my feelings. My\nfriends seemed to have been snatched away by some mysterious agency, and\nthe horror of the thing almost drove me crazy. I felt that I was, in a\nmanner, responsible for their disappearance.\n\n\"One day my heart sank at the sight of a cousin of Jack Ashton's\nmotioning to me in the street. He approached, with a troubled look. 'Mr.\nChurch,' he said, 'I think you know me; can you tell me what has become\nof Jack? I haven't seen him for several days.' What could I say? Still\nbelieving that they would soon come back, I invented, on the spur of the\nmoment, a story that Jack, with a couple of intimate friends, had gone\noff on a hunting expedition. I took a little comfort in the reflection\nthat my friends, like myself, were bachelors, and consequently at liberty\nto disappear if they chose.\n\n\"But when more than a week had passed with out any news of them I was\nthrown into despair. I had to give up all hope. Remembering how near we\nwere to the coast, I concluded that they had drifted out over the sea and\ngone down. It was hard for me, after the lie I had told, to let out the\ntruth to such of their friends as I knew, but I had to do it. Then the\npolice took the matter in hand and ransacked Stonewall's laboratory and\nthe shanty without finding anything to throw light on the mystery. It was\na newspaper sensation for a few days, but as nothing came of it everybody\nsoon forgot all about it--all except me. I was left to my loneliness and\nmy regrets.\n\n\"A year has now passed with no news from them. I write this on the\nanniversary of their departure. My friends, I know, are dead--somewhere!\nOh, what an experience it has been! When your friends die and are buried\nit is hard enough but when they disappear in a flash and leave no\ntoken--! It is almost beyond endurance!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nA TRIP OF TERROR\n\nI take up the story at the point where I dropped it to introduce Church's\nnarrative.\n\nAs minute after minute elapsed and we continued in motion we changed our\nminds about the descent, and concluded that the inventor was going to\ngive us a much longer ride than we had anticipated. We were startled and\npuzzled but not really alarmed, for the car traveled so smoothly that it\ngave one a sense of confidence. On the other hand, we felt a little\nindignation that Edmund should treat us like a lot of boys, without wills\nof our own. No doubt we had provoked him, though unintentionally, but\nthis was going too far on his part. I am sure we were all hot with this\nfeeling and presently Jack flamed out:\n\n\"Look here, Edmund,\" he exclaimed, dropping his customary good-natured\nmanner, \"this is carrying things with a pretty high hand. It's a good\ndeal like kidnapping, it seems to me. I didn't give you permission to\ncarry me off in this way, and I want to know what you mean by it and what\nyou are about. I've no objection to making a little trip in your car,\nwhich is certainly mighty comfortable, but first I'd like to be asked\nwhether I want to go or no.\"\n\nEdmund shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. He was very busy just\nthen with the metallic knobs. Suddenly we were jerked off our feet as if\nwe had been in a trolley driven by a green motorman. Edmund also would\nhave fallen if he had not clung to one of the handles. We felt that we\nwere spinning through the air at a fearful speed. Still Edmund uttered\nnot a word, but while we staggered upon our feet, and steadied ourselves\nwith hands and knees on the leather-cushioned benches like so many\ndrunken men, he continued pulling and pushing at his knobs. Finally the\nmotion became more regular and it was evident that the car had slowed\ndown from its wild rush.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Edmund, then, quite in his natural manner, \"the thing\nis new yet and I've got to learn the stops by experience. But there's no\noccasion for alarm.\"\n\nBut our indignation had grown hotter with the shake-up that we had just\nhad, and as usual Jack was spokesman for it:\n\n\"Maybe there is no occasion for alarm,\" he said excitedly, \"but will you\nbe kind enough to answer my question, and tell us what you're about and\nwhere we are going?\"\n\nAnd Henry, too, who was ordinarily as mute as a clam, broke out still\nmore hotly:\n\n\"See here! I've had enough of this thing! Just go down and let me out. I\nwon't be carried off so, against my will and knowledge.\"\n\nBy this time Edmund appeared to have got things in the shape he wanted,\nand he turned to face us. He always had a magnetism that was\ninexplicable, and now we felt it as never before. His features were\nperfectly calm, but there was a light in his eyes that seemed electric.\nAs if disdaining to make a direct reply to the heated words of Jack and\nHenry he began in a quiet voice:\n\n\"It was my first intention to invite you to accompany me on a very\ninteresting expedition. I knew that none of you had any ties of family or\nbusiness to detain you, and I felt sure that you would readily consent.\nIn case you should not, however, I had made up my mind to go alone. But\nyou provoked me more than you knew, probably, at the club, and after we\nhad entered the car, and, being myself hot-tempered, I determined to\nteach you a lesson. I have no intention, however, of abducting you. It is\ntrue that you are in my power at present, but if you now say that you do\nnot wish to be concerned in what I assure you will prove the most\nwonderful enterprise ever undertaken by human beings, I will go back to\nthe shed and let you out.\"\n\nWe looked at one another, in doubt what to reply until Jack, who, with\nall his impulsiveness had more of the milk of human kindness in his heart\nthan anyone else I ever knew, seized Edmund's hand and exclaimed:\n\n\"All right, old boy, bygones are bygones; I'm with you. Now what do you\nfellows say?\"\n\n\"I'm with you, too,\" I cried, yielding to the spur of Jack's enthusiasm\nand moved also by an intense curiosity. \"I say go ahead.\"\n\nHenry was more backward. But his curiosity, too, was aroused, and at\nlength he gave in his voice with the others.\n\nJack swung his hat.\n\n\"Three cheers, then, for the modern Archimedes! You won't take that amiss\nnow Edmund.\"\n\nWe gave the cheers, and I could see that Edmund was immensely pleased.\n\n\"And now,\" Jack continued, \"tell us all about it. Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Jack,\" was Edmund's reply, \"but I'd rather keep that for a\nsurprise. You shall know everything in good time; or at least everything\nthat you can understand,\" he added, with a slightly malicious smile.\n\nFeeling a little more interest than the others, perhaps, in the\nscientific aspects of the business, I asked Edmund to tell us something\nmore about the nature of his wonderful invention. He responded with great\ngood humor, but rather in the manner of a schoolmaster addressing pupils\nwho, he knows, cannot entirely follow him.\n\n\"These knobs and handles on the walls,\" he said, \"control the driving\npower, which, as I have told you, comes from the atoms of matter which I\nhave persuaded to unlock their hidden forces. I push or turn one way and\nwe go ahead, or we rise; I push or turn another way and we stop, or go\nback. So I concentrate the atomic force just as I choose. It makes us go,\nor it carries us back to earth, or it holds us motionless, according to\nthe way I apply it. The earth is what I kick against at present, and what\nI hold fast by; but any other sufficiently massive body would serve the\nsame purpose. As to the machinery, you'd need a special education in\norder to understand it. You'd have to study the whole subject from the\nbottom up, and go through all the experiments that I have tried. I\nconfess that there are some things the fundamental reason of which I\ndon't understand myself. But I know how to apply and control the power,\nand if I had Professor Thomson and Professor Rutherford here, I'd make\nthem open their eyes. I wish I had been able to kidnap them.\"\n\n\"That's a confession that, after all, you've kidnapped us,\" put in Jack,\nsmiling.\n\n\"If you insist upon stating it in that way--yes,\" replied Edmund, smiling\nalso. \"But you know that now you've consented.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'll treat us to a trip to Paris,\" Jack persisted.\n\n\"Better than that,\" was the reply. \"Paris is only an ant-hill in\ncomparison with what you are going to see.\"\n\nAnd so, indeed, it turned out!\n\nFinally all got out their pipes, and we began to make ourselves at home,\nfor truly, as far as luxurious furniture was concerned, we were as\ncomfortable as at the Olympus Club, and the motion of the strange craft\nwas so smooth and regular that it soothed us like an anodyne. It was only\nthose unnamed, subtle senses which man possesses almost without being\naware of their existence that assured us that we were in motion at all.\n\nAfter we had smoked for an hour or so, talking and telling stories quite\nin the manner of the club, Edmund suddenly asked, with a peculiar smile:\n\n\"Aren't you a little surprised that this small room is not choking full\nof smoke? You know that the shutters are tightly closed.\"\n\n\"By Jo,\" exclaimed Jack, \"that's so! Why here we've been pouring out\nclouds like old Vesuvius for an hour with no windows open, and yet the\nair is as clear as a bell.\"\n\n\"The smoke,\" said Edmund impressively, \"has been turned into atomic\nenergy to speed us on our way. I'm glad you're all good smokers, for that\nsaves me fuel. Look,\" he continued, while we, amazed, stared at him,\n\"those fellows there have been swallowing your smoke, and glad to get\nit.\"\n\nHe pointed at a row of what seemed to be grinning steel mouths, barred\nwith innumerable black teeth, and half concealed by a projecting ledge at\nthe bottom of the wall opposite the entrance, and as I looked I was\nthrilled by the sight of faint curls of smoke disappearing within their\ngaping jaws.\n\n\"They are omnivorous beasts,\" said Edmund. \"They feed on the carbon from\nyour breath, too. Rather remarkable, isn't it, that every time you expel\nthe air from your lungs you help this car to go?\"\n\nNone of us knew what to say; our astonishment was beyond speech. We began\nto look askance at Edmund, with creeping sensations about the spine. A\nformless, unacknowledged fear of him entered our souls. It never occurred\nto us to doubt the truth of what he had said. We knew him too well for\nthat; and, then, were we not here, flying mysteriously through the air in\na heavy metallic car that had no apparent motive power? For my part,\ninstead of demanding any further explanations, I fell into a hazy reverie\non the marvel of it all; and Jack and Henry must have been seized the\nsame way, for not one of us spoke a word, or asked a question; while\nEdmund, satisfied, perhaps, with the impression he had made, kept equally\nquiet.\n\nThus another hour passed, and all of us, I think, had fallen into a doze,\nwhen Edmund aroused us by saying:\n\n\"I'll have to keep the first watch, and all the others, too, this night.\"\n\n\"So then we're not going to land to-night?\"\n\n\"No, not to-night, and you may as well turn in. You see that I have\nprepared good, comfortable bunks, and I think you'll make out very well.\"\n\nAs Edmund spoke he lifted the tops from some of the benches along the\nwalls, and revealed excellent beds, ready for occupancy.\n\n\"I believe that I have forgotten nothing that we shall really need,\" he\nadded. \"Beds, arms, instruments, books, clothing, furs, and good things\nto eat.\"\n\nAgain we looked at one another in surprise, but nobody spoke, although\nthe same thought probably occurred to each--that this promised to be a\npretty long trip, judging from the preparations. Arms! What in the world\nshould we need of arms? Was he going to the Rocky Mountains for a bear\nhunt? And clothing, and furs!\n\nBut we were really sleepy, and none of us was very long in taking Edmund\nat his word and leaving him to watch alone. He considerately drew a shade\nover the light, and then noiselessly opened a shutter and looked out.\nWhen I saw that, I was strongly tempted to rise and take a look myself,\nbut instead I fell asleep. My dreams were disturbed by visions of the\ngrinning nondescripts at the foot of the wall, which transformed\nthemselves into winged dragons, and remorselessly pursued me through the\nmeasureless abysses of space.\n\nWhen I woke, windows were open on both sides of the car, and brilliant\nsunshine was streaming in through one of them. Henry was still asleep,\nJack was yawning in his bunk, and Edmund stood at one of the windows\nstaring out. I made a quick toilet, and hastened to Edmund's side.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said heartily, taking my hand. \"Look out here, and\ntell me what you think of the prospect.\"\n\nAs I put my face close to the thick but very transparent glass covering\nthe window, my heart jumped into my mouth!\n\n\"In Heaven's name, where are we?\" I cried out.\n\nJack, hearing my agitated exclamation, jumped out of his bunk and ran to\nthe window also. He gasped as he gazed out, and truly it was enough to\ntake away one's breath!\n\nWe appeared to be at an infinite elevation, and the sky, as black as ink,\nwas ablaze with stars, although the bright sunlight was streaming into\nthe opposite window behind us. I could see nothing of the earth.\nEvidently we were too high for that.\n\n\"It must lie away down under our feet,\" I murmured half aloud, \"so that\neven the horizon has sunk out of sight. Heavens, what a height!\"\n\nI had that queer uncontrollable qualm that comes to every one who finds\nhimself suddenly on the edge of a soundless deep.\n\nPresently I became aware that straight before us, but afar off, was a\nmost singular appearance in the sky. At first glance I thought that it\nwas a cloud, round and mottled, But it was strangely changeless in form,\nand it had an unvaporous look.\n\n\"Phew!\" whistled Jack, suddenly catching sight of it and fixing his eyes\nin a stare, \"what's _that?_\"\n\n\"_That's the earth!_\"\n\nIt was Edmund who spoke, looking at us with a quizzical smile. A shock\nran through my nerves, and for an instant my brain whirled. I saw that it\nwas the truth that he had uttered, for, as sure as I sit here, his words\nhad hardly struck my ears when the great cloud rounded out and hardened,\nthe deception vanished, and I recognized, as clearly as ever I saw them\non a school globe, the outlines of Asia and the Pacific Ocean!\n\nIn a second I had become too weak to stand, and I sank trembling upon a\nbench. But Jack, whose eyes had not accommodated themselves as rapidly as\nmine to the gigantic perspective, remained at the window, exclaiming:\n\n\"Fiddlesticks! What are you trying to give us? The earth is down below, I\nreckon.\"\n\nBut in another minute he, too, saw it as it really was, and his\nastonishment equaled mine. In fact he made so much noise about it that he\nawoke Henry, who, jumping out of bed, came running to see, and when we\nhad explained to him where we were, sank upon a seat with a despairing\ngroan and covered his face. Our astonishment and dismay were too great to\npermit us quickly to recover our self-command, but after a while Jack\nseized Edmund's arm, and demanded:\n\n\"For God's sake, tell us what you've been doing.\"\n\n\"Nothing that ought to appear very extraordinary,\" answered Edmund, with\nuncommon warmth. \"If men had not been fools for so many ages they might\nhave done this, and more than this long ago. It's enough to make one\nashamed of his race! For countless centuries, instead of grasping the\npower that nature had placed at the disposal of their intelligence, they\nhave idled away their time gabbling about nothing. And even since, at\nlast, they have begun to do something, look at the time that they have\nwasted upon such petty forces as steam and 'electricity,' burning whole\nmines of coal and whole lakes of oil, and childishly calling upon winds\nand tides and waterfalls to help them, when they had under their thumbs\nthe limitless energy of the atoms, and no more understood it than a baby\nunderstands what makes its whistle scream! It's inter-atomic force that\nhas brought us out here, and that is going to carry us a great deal\nfarther.\"\n\nWe simply listened in silence; for what could we say? The facts were more\neloquent than any words, and called for no commentary. Here we _were_,\nout in the middle of space; and _there_ was the earth, hanging on\nnothing, like a summer cloud. At least we knew where we were if we didn't\nquite understand how we had got there.\n\nSeeing us speechless, Edmund resumed in a different tone:\n\n\"We made a fairly good run during the night. You must be hungry by this\ntime, for you've slept late; suppose we have breakfast.\"\n\nSo saying, he opened a locker, took out a folding table, covered it\nwith a white cloth, turned on something resembling a little electric\nrange, and in a few minutes had ready as appetizing a breakfast of eggs\nand as good a cup of coffee as I ever tasted. It is one of the\ncompensations of human nature that it is able to adjust itself to the\nmost unheard-of conditions provided only that the inner man is not\nneglected. The smell of breakfast would almost reconcile a man to\npurgatory--anyhow it reconciled us for the time being to our unparalleled\nsituation, and we ate and drank, and indulged in as cheerful good\ncomradeship as that of a fishing party in the wilderness after a big\nmorning's catch.\n\nWhen the breakfast was finished we began to chat and smoke, which\nreminded me of those gulping mouths under the wainscot, and I leaned down\nto catch a glimpse of their rows of black fangs, thinking to ask Edmund\nfor further explanation about them; but the sight gave me a shiver, and I\nfelt the hopelessness of trying to understand their function.\n\nThen we took a turn at looking out of the window to see the earth. Edmund\nfurnished us with binoculars which enabled us to recognize many\ngeographical features of our planet. The western shore of the Pacific was\nnow in plain sight, and a few small spots, near the edge of the ocean, we\nknew to be Japan and the Philippines. The snowy Himalayas showed as a\ncrinkling line, and a huge white smudge over the China Sea indicated\nwhere a storm was raging and where good ships, no doubt, were battling\nwith the tossing waves.\n\nAfter a time I noticed that Edmund was continually going from one window\nto the other and looking out with an air of anxiety. He seemed to be\nwatching for something, and there was a look of mingled expectation and\napprehension in his eyes. He had a peephole at the forward end of the car\nand another in the floor, and these he frequently visited. I now recalled\nthat even while we were at breakfast he had seemed uneasy and\noccasionally left his seat to look out. At last I asked him:\n\n\"What are you looking for, Edmund?\"\n\n\"Meteors.\"\n\n\"Meteors, out here!\"\n\n\"Of course. You're something of an astronomer; don't you know that they\nhang about all the planets? They didn't give me any rest last night. I\nwas on tender hooks all the time while you were sleeping. I was half\ninclined to call one of you to help me. We passed some pretty ugly\nfellows while you slept, I can tell you! You know that this is an\nunexplored sea that we are navigating, and I don't want to run on the\nrocks.\"\n\n\"But we seem to be a good way off from the earth now,\" I remarked, \"and\nthere ought not to be much danger.\"\n\n\"It's not as dangerous as it was, but there may be some of them yet\naround here. I'll feel safer when we have put a few more million miles\nbehind us.\"\n\n_A few more million miles!_ We all stood aghast when we heard the words.\nWe had, indeed, imagined that the earth looked as if it might be a\nmillion miles away, but, then, it was merely a passing impression, which\nhad given us no sense of reality; but now when we heard Edmund say that\nwe actually had traveled such a distance, the idea struck us with\noverwhelming force.\n\n\"In the name of all that's good, Edmund,\" cried Jack, \"at what rate are\nwe traveling, then?\"\n\n\"Just at present,\" Edmund replied, glancing at an indicator, \"we're\nmaking twenty miles a second.\"\n\n_Twenty miles a second!_ Our excited nerves had another shock.\n\n\"Why,\" I exclaimed, \"that's faster than the earth moves in its orbit!\"\n\n\"Yes, a trifle faster; but I'll probably have to work up to a little\nbetter speed in order to get where I want to go before our goal begins to\nrun away from us.\"\n\n\"Ah, there you are,\" said Jack. \"That's what I wanted to know. What is\nour goal? Where are we going?\"\n\nBefore Edmund could reply we all sprang to our feet in affright. A loud\ngrating noise had broken upon our ears. At the same instant the car gave\na lurch, and a blaze of the most vicious lightning streamed through a\nwindow.\n\n\"Confound the things!\" shouted Edmund, springing to the window, and then\ndarting to one of his knobs and beginning to twist it with all his force.\n\nIn a second we were sprawling on the floor--all except Edmund, who kept\nhis hold on the knob. Our course had been changed with amazing quickness,\nand our startled eyes beheld a huge misshapen object darting past the\nwindow.\n\n\"Here comes another!\" cried Edmund, again seizing the knob.\n\nI had managed to get my face to the window, and I certainly thought that\nwe were done for. Apparently only a few rods away, and rushing straight\nat the car, was a vast black mass, shaped something like a dumb-bell,\nwith ends as big as houses, tumbling over and over, and threatening us\nwith annihilation. If it hit us, as it seemed sure that it would do, I\nknew that we should never return to the earth, unless in the form of\npulverized ashes!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTHE PLANETARY LIMITED\n\nBut Edmund had seen the meteor sooner than I, and as quick as thought he\nswerved the car, and threw us all off our feet once more. But we should\nhave been thankful if he had broken our heads, since he had saved us from\ninstant destruction.\n\nThe danger, however, was not yet passed. Scarcely had the immense\ndumb-bell (which Edmund declared must have been composed of solid iron,\nso great was its effect on his needles) disappeared, before there came\nfrom outside a blaze so fierce that it fairly slapped our lids shut.\n\n\"A collision!\" Edmund exclaimed. \"The thing has struck another big\nmeteor, and they are exchanging fiery compliments.\"\n\nHe threw himself flat on the floor, and stared out of the peephole. Then\nhe jumped to his feet and gave us another tumble.\n\n\"They're all about us,\" he faltered, breathless with exertion; then,\nhaving drawn a deep inspiration, he continued: \"We're like a boat in a\nraging freshet, with rocks, tree trunks, and cakes of ice threatening it\non all sides. But we'll get out of it. The car obeys its helm as if it\nappreciated the danger. Why, I got away from that last fellow by setting\nup atomic reaction against it, as a boatman pushes with his pole.\"\n\nEven in the midst of our terror we could not but admire our leader. His\nresources seemed boundless, and our confidence in him grew with every\nescape. While he kept guard at the peepholes we watched for meteors from\nthe windows. We must have come almost within striking distance of a\nthousand in the course of an hour, but Edmund decided not to diminish\nour speed, for he said that he could control the car quicker when it was\nunder full headway.\n\nSo on we rushed, dodging the things like a crow in a flock of pestering\njays, and we really enjoyed the excitement. It was more fascinating sport\nthan shooting rapids in a careening skiff, and at last we grew so\nconfident in the powers of our car and its commander that we were rather\nsorry when the last meteor passed, and we found ourselves once more in\nopen, unimpeded space.\n\nAfter that the time passed quietly. We ate our meals and went to bed and\nrose as regularly as if we had been at home. In one respect, however,\nthings were very different from what they were on the earth. We had no\nnight! The sun shone continually, although the sky was black and always\nglittering with stars. None of us needed to be told by our conductor that\nthis was due to the fact that we no longer had the shadow of the earth to\nmake night for us when the sun was behind it. The sun was now never\nbehind the earth, or any other great opaque body, and when we wished to\nsleep we made an artificial night, for our special use, by closing all\nthe shutters. And there was no atmosphere about us to diffuse the\nsunlight, and so to hide the stars. We kept count of the days by the aid\nof a calendar clock; there seemed to be nothing that Edmund had\nforgotten. And it was a delightful experience, the wonder of which grew\nupon us hour by hour. It was too marvelous, too incredible, to be\nbelieved, and yet--_there we were!_\n\nOnce the idea suddenly came to me that it was astonishing that we had not\nlong ago perished for lack of oxygen. I understood, of course, from what\nEdmund had said, that the mysterious machines along the wall absorbed the\ncarbonic acid, but we must be constantly using up the oxygen. When I put\nmy difficulty before Edmund he laughed.\n\n\"That's the easiest thing of all,\" he said. \"Look here.\"\n\nHe threw open a little grating.\n\n\"In there,\" he continued, \"there's an apparatus which manufactures just\nenough oxygen to keep the air in good condition. It is supplied with\nmaterials to last a month, which will be much longer than this expedition\nwill take.\"\n\n\"There you are again,\" exclaimed Jack. \"I was asking you about that when\nwe ran into those pesky meteors. What _is_ this expedition? Where are we\ngoing, anyway?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Edmund replied, \"since we have become pretty good shipmates, I\ndon't see any objection to telling you. We are going to Venus.\"\n\n\"Going to Venus!\" we all cried in a breath.\n\n\"To be sure. Why not? We've got the proper sort of conveyance, haven't\nwe?\"\n\nThere was no denying that. Our conveyance had already brought us some\nmillions of miles out into space; why, indeed, should it not be able to\ncarry us to Venus, or any other planet?\n\n\"How far is it to Venus?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"When we quit the earth,\" Edmund answered, \"Venus was rapidly approaching\ninferior conjunction. You know what that is,\" addressing me, \"it's when\nthe planet comes between the sun and the earth. The distance from the\nearth is not always the same at such a conjunction, but I figured out\nthat on this occasion, after allowing for the circuit we should have to\nmake, there would be just twenty-seven million miles to travel. At an\naverage speed of twenty miles a second we could do that distance in\nfifteen days, fourteen and one half hours. But, of course, I had to lose\nsome time going slow through the earth's atmosphere, for otherwise the\ncar would have taken fire, like a meteor, on account of the friction.\nThen, too, I shall have to slow up on entering the atmosphere of Venus,\nwhich appears to be very deep and dense; so, upon the whole, I don't\ncount on landing upon Venus in less than sixteen days from the time of\nour departure. We've already been out five days, and within eleven more I\nexpect to introduce you to the inhabitants of another world.\"\n\nThe inhabitants of another world! Again Edmund had thrown out an idea\nwhich took us all aback.\n\n\"Do you believe there are any inhabitants on Venus?\" I asked at length.\n\n\"Certainly. I know there are.\"\n\n\"For sure,\" put in Jack, stretching out his legs and pulling at his pipe.\n\"Who'd go twenty-seven million miles to pay a visit if he didn't know\nthere was somebody at home?\"\n\n\"Then that's what you put the arms aboard for,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yes, but I hope we shall not have to use them.\"\n\n\"Strikes me that this is a sort of pirate ship,\" said Jack. \"But what\nkind of arms have you got, Edmund?\"\n\nFor answer Edmund threw open a locker and showed us a gleaming array of\nautomatic guns and pistols and even some cutlasses.\n\n\"Decidedly piratical!\" exclaimed the incorrigible Jack. \"You'd better\nhoist the black flag. But, see here, Edmund, with all this inter-atomic\nenergy that you talk about, why in the world didn't you invent something\nnew--something that would just knock the Venustians silly, and blow their\nold planet up if necessary? Automatic arms are pretty good at home, on\nthat unprogressive earth that you have spurned with your heels, but\nthey'll likely be rather small pumpkins on Venus.\"\n\n\"I didn't prepare anything else,\" Edmund replied, \"because, in the first\nplace, I was too busy with more important things, and in the second place\nbecause I don't really anticipate that we shall have any use for arms. I\nonly took these as a precaution.\"\n\n\"You mean to try moral suasion, I suppose,\" drawled Jack. \"Well, anyhow,\nI hope they'll be glad to see us, and since it is Venus that we are going\nto visit, I don't look for much fighting. I'm glad you made it Venus\ninstead of Mars, Edmund, for, from all I've heard of Mars with its\nfourteen-foot giants, I don't think I should like to try the pirate\nbusiness in that direction.\"\n\nWe all laughed at Jack's fancies; but there was something tremendously\nthrilling in the idea. Think of landing on another world! Think of\nmeeting inhabitants there! Really, it made one's head spin.\n\n\"Confound it, this is all a dream,\" I said to myself. \"I'm on my back in\nbed with a nightmare. I'll kick myself awake.\"\n\nBut do what I would I could make no dream of it. On the contrary, I felt\nthat I had never been quite so much awake in all my life before.\n\nAfter a while we all settled down to take the thing in earnest. And then\nthe charm of it began to master our imaginations. We talked over the\nprospects in all their aspects. Edmund said little, and Henry nothing,\nbut Jack and I were stirred to the bottom of our romantic souls. Henry\nwas different. He had no romance in his make-up. He always looked at the\nmoney in a thing. To his mind, going to Venus was playing the fool, when\nwe had at our command the means of owning the earth.\n\n\"Edmund,\" he said, after mumbling for a while under his breath, \"this is\nthe most utter tomfoolery that ever I heard of. Here you've got an\ninvention that would revolutionize mechanics, and instead of utilizing it\nyou rush off into space on a hairbrained adventure. You might have been\ntwenty times a billionaire inside of a year if you had stayed at home and\ndeveloped the thing. Why, it's folly; pure, beastly folly! Going to\nVenus! What can you make on Venus?\"\n\nEdmund only smiled. After a little he said:\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry for you, Henry. But then you're cut out on the ordinary\npattern. But cheer up. When we go back, perhaps I'll let you take out a\npatent, and you can make the billions. For my part, Venus is more\ninteresting to me than all the money you could pile up between the\nAtlantic Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. Why,\" he continued, warming up,\nand straightening with a certain pride which he had, \"am I not the\nColumbus of Space?--And you my lieutenants,\" he added, with a smile.\n\n\"Right you are,\" cried Jack enthusiastically. \"The Columbus of Space,\nthat's the ticket! Where's old Archimedes now? Buried, by Jo! _He_\ncouldn't go to Venus! And what need we care for your billionaires?\"\n\nEdmund patted Jack on the back, and I rather sympathized with his\nenthusiasm myself.\n\nThe time ran on, and we watched anxiously the day-hand of the calendar\nclock. Soon it had marked a week; then ten days; then a fortnight. We\nknew we must be getting very close to our goal, yet up to this time\nneither Jack, nor Henry, nor I had caught a glimpse of Venus. Edmund,\nhowever, had seen it, but he told us that in order to do so he had been\nobliged to alter our course because the planet was directly in the eye of\nthe sun. In consequence of the change of course we were now approaching\nVenus from the east--flanking her, so to speak--and Edmund described her\nappearance as that of an enormous crescent. Finally he invited us to take\na look for ourselves.\n\nI shall never forget that first view! It was only a glimpse, for Edmund\nwas nervous about meteors again, and would allow us only a moment at the\npeephole because he wished to be continually on the watch himself. But,\nbrief as was the view, that vast gleaming sickle hanging in the black sky\nwas the most tremendous thing I ever looked upon!\n\nSoon afterwards Edmund changed the course again, and then we saw her no\nmore. We had not come upon the swarms of meteors that Edmund had expected\nto find lurking about the planet, and he said that he now felt safe in\nrunning into her shadow, and making a landing on her night hemisphere.\nYou will allow me to remind you that Schiaparelli had long before found\nout that Venus doesn't turn on her axis once every twenty-four hours,\nlike the earth, but keeps always the same face to the sun; the\nconsequence being that she has perpetual day on one side and perpetual\nnight on the other. I asked Edmund why he should not rather land on the\ndaylight side; but he replied that his plan was safer, and that we could\neasily go from one side to the other whenever we chose. It didn't turn\nout to be so easy after all, but that is another part of the story.\n\n\"I hardly expect to find any inhabitants on the night side,\" Edmund\nremarked, \"for it must be fearfully cold there--too cold for life to\nexist, perhaps; but I have provided against that as far as we are\nconcerned. Still, one can never tell. There _may_ be inhabitants there,\nand at any rate I am going to find out. If there are none, we'll just\nstop long enough to take a look at things, and then the car will quickly\ntransport us to the daylight hemisphere, where life certainly exists. By\nlanding on the uninhabited side, you see, we shall have a chance to\nreconnoiter a little, and can approach the inhabitants on the other side\nso much the more safely.\"\n\n\"That sounds all right enough,\" said Jack, \"but if Venus is correctly\nnamed, I'm for getting where the inhabitants are as quick as possible.\"\n\nWhen we swung round into the shadow of the planet we got her between the\nsun and ourselves, and as she completely hid the sun, we now had\nperpetual night about the car. Out of the peephole she looked like a\nstupendous black circle, blacker than the sky itself, but round the rim\nwas a beautiful ring of light.\n\n\"That's her atmosphere,\" Edmund explained, \"lighted up by the sun from\nbehind. But, for the life of me, I cannot tell what those immense flames\nmean.\"\n\nHe referred to a vast circle of many-colored spires that blazed and\nflickered like a burning rainbow at the inner edge of the ring of light.\nIt was one of the most awful, and yet beautiful, sights that I had ever\ngazed upon.\n\n\"That's something altogether outside my calculations,\" Edmund added. \"I\ncan't account for it at all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they are already celebrating our arrival with fireworks,\"\nsuggested Jack, always ready to take the humorous view of everything.\n\n\"That's not fire,\" Edmund responded earnestly. \"But what it is I confess\nI can't imagine. We'll find out, however, for I haven't come all this\ndistance to be scared off.\"\n\nAnd here I must try to explain a very curious thing which had puzzled our\nsenses, though not our understanding (because Edmund had promptly\nexplained it), throughout the voyage, and that was--levitation.  On our\nfirst day out from the earth, we began to notice the remarkable ease with\nwhich we handled things, and the strange tendency we had to bump into one\nanother because we seemed to be all the time employing more strength than\nwas necessary and almost to be able to walk on air. Jack declared that he\nfelt as if his head had become a toy balloon.\n\n\"It's the lack of weight,\" said Edmund. \"Every time we double our\ndistance from the earth we lose another three quarters of our weight. If\nI had thought to bring along a spring dynamometer, I could have shown\nyou, Jack, that when we were 4,000 miles above the earth's surface the\n200 good pounds with which you depress the scales at home had diminished\nto 50, and that when we had passed about 150,000 miles into space you\nweighed no more than a couple of ounces. From that point on, it has been\nthe attraction of the sun to which we have owed whatever weight we had,\nand the floor of the car has been toward the sun, because, at that\ndistance from the earth, the latter ceases to exercise the master force,\nand the pull of the sun becomes greater than the earth's. But as we\napproach Venus the latter begins to restore our weight, and when we\narrive on her surface we shall weigh about four fifths as much as when we\nstarted from the earth.\"\n\n\"But I don't look as if I had lost any avoirdupois,\" said Jack, glancing\nat his round limbs. \"And when you give us a fling I seem to strike pretty\nhard, though in other respects I confess I do feel a good deal like an\nangel.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Edmund, laughing, \"that's the _inertia of mass_. Your mass is\nthe same, although your weight has almost disappeared. Weight depends\nupon the distance from the attracting body, but mass is independent of\neverything.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that angels are massive?\"\n\n\"They may be as massive as they like provided they keep well away from\ngreat centers of gravitation.\"\n\n\"But Venus is such a center--then there can't be any angels there.\"\n\n\"I hope to find something better than angels,\" was Edmund's smiling\nreply.\n\nNow, as we drew near to Venus, the truth of Edmund's statements became\napparent. We felt that our weight was returning, and our muscular\nactivity sinking back to the normal again. We imagined that every minute\nwe could feel our feet pressing more heavily upon the floor.\n\nOur approach was so rapid that the immense black circle grew visibly\nminute by minute. Soon it was so large that we could no longer see its\nboundaries through the peephole in the floor.\n\n\"We're now within a thousand miles,\" said Edmund, \"and must be close to\nthe upper limits of the atmosphere. I'll have to slow down, or else we'll\nbe burnt up by the heat of friction.\"\n\nHe proceeded to slow down a little more rapidly than was comfortable. It\nwas jerk after jerk, as he dropped off the power, and put on the brakes,\nbut at last we got down to the speed of a fast express train. Soon we\nwere so close that the surface of the planet became dimly visible, simply\nfrom the starlight. We were now settling down very cautiously, and\npresently we began to notice curious shafts of light which appeared to\nissue from the ground, as if the surface beneath us had been sprinkled\nwith iron founderies.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried Edmund, \"I believe there _are_ inhabitants on this side\nafter all. Those lights don't come from volcanoes. I'm going to make for\nthe nearest one, and we'll soon know what they are.\"\n\nAccordingly we steered for one of the gleaming shafts. It was a thrilling\nmoment, I can tell you--that when we first saw another world than ours\nunder our feet! As we approached the light it threw a pale illumination\non the ground around. Everything appeared to be perfectly flat and level.\nIt was like dropping down at night upon a vast prairie. But the features\nof the landscape were indistinguishable in the gloom. Edmund boldly\ncontinued to approach until we were within a hundred feet of the shaft of\nlight, which we could now perceive issued directly from the ground.\nSuddenly, with the slightest perceptible bump, we touched the soil, and\nthe car came to rest. We had landed on Venus!\n\n\"It's unquestionably frightfully cold outside,\" said Edmund, \"and we'll\nnow put on these things.\"\n\nHe dragged out of one of his many lockers four suits of thick fur\ngarments, and as many pairs of fur gloves, together with caps and shields\nfor the face, leaving only narrow openings for the eyes. When we had got\nthem on we looked like so many Esquimaux. Finally Edmund handed each of\nus a pair of small automatic pistols, telling us to put them where they\nwould be handy in our side pockets.\n\n\"Boarders all!\" cried the irrepressible Jack. \"Pirates, do your duty!\"\n\nOur preparations being made, we opened the door. The air that rushed in\nalmost hardened us into icicles!\n\n\"It won't hurt you,\" said Edmund in a whisper. \"It can't be down to\nabsolute zero on account of the dense atmosphere. You'll get used to it\nin a few minutes. Come on.\"\n\nHis whispering gave us a sense of imminent danger, but nevertheless we\nfollowed as he led the way straight toward the shaft of light. On nearing\nit we saw that it came out of an irregularly round hole in the ground.\nWhen we got yet nearer we were astonished to see rough steps which led\ndown into the pit. The next instant we were frozen in our tracks! For a\nmoment my heart stopped beating.\n\nStanding on the steps, just below the level of the ground, and intently\nwatching us, with eyes as big and luminous as moons, was a creature\nshaped like a man, but more savage than a gorilla!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nTHE CAVERNS OF VENUS\n\nFor two or three minutes the creature continued to stare at us,\nmotionless; and we stared at him. It was so dramatic that it makes my\nnerves tingle now when I think of it. His eyes alone were enough to\nharrow up your soul. Huge beyond belief, round and luminous as full\nmoons, they were filled with the phosphorescent greenish-yellow glare\nthat sometimes appears in the expanded pupils of a cat or a wild beast.\nThe great hairy head was black, but the stocky body was as white as a\npolar bear. The arms were apelike and very long and muscular, and the\nentire aspect of the creature betokened immense strength and activity.\n\nEdmund was the first to recover from the stupor of surprise, and\ninstantly he did a thing so apparently absurd but so marvelous in its\ncalculated effect that no brain but his could have conceived it. It\nshakes me at once with laughter and recollected terror when I recall it.\n\n\"WELL, HELLO YOU!\" he called out in a voice of such stentorian power that\nwe jumped as at a thunderclap. The effect on the strange brute was\nelectric. A film shot across the big eyes, he leaped into the air,\nuttering a squeak that was ridiculous, coming from an animal of such size\nand strength, and instantly disappeared, tumbling down the steps.\n\nBut we were as much frightened as the ugly monster himself. We stared at\nEdmund, speechless in our amazement. Never could I have believed it\npossible for such a voice to issue from the human throat. It was not the\nvoice of our friend, nor the voice of a man at all, but an indescribable\nclangor; and the words I have quoted had been scarcely distinguishable,\nso shattered were they by the crash of sound that whirled them into our\nastonished ears. Edmund, seeing us gaping in speechless wonder, laughed\nwith such an appearance of hearty enjoyment as I had never known him to\nexhibit--and his merriment produced another thunderous explosion that\nshook the air.\n\nThen the truth burst upon me, and I exclaimed:\n\n\"It's the atmosphere!\"\n\nI had not spoken very loudly, but the words seemed to reverberate in my\nmouth, as if to testify to the correctness of my explanation.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edmund, taking pains to moderate his voice, \"you've hit it,\nit's the atmosphere. I had calculated on an effect of the kind, but the\nreality exceeds all that I had anticipated. Spectroscopic analysis as\nwell as telescopic appearances demonstrated long ago that the atmosphere\nof Venus was extraordinarily extensive and dense, from which fact I\ninferred that we should encounter some wonderful acoustic phenomena here,\nand this was in my mind when, on stepping out of the car, I addressed you\nin a whisper. The reaction even of the whisper on my organs of speech\ntold me that I was right, and showed me what to expect if the full power\nof the voice were used. When we caught sight of the creature at the top\nof the pit I had no desire to shoot him, and I saw that he was too\npowerful to be captured alive. In a second I had decided what to do. It\nran through my mind that, in a world where the density, and probably\nsomething also in the peculiar constitution of the air, had the effect of\nvastly magnifying sound, the phonetic and acoustic organs of the\ninhabitants would be modified, and that the sounds uttered by them would\nbe much fainter than those that we are accustomed to hear from living\ncreatures on the earth. That being so, I argued that a very great and\nheavy sound coming from a strange animal would produce in the creature\nbefore us a paralyzing terror. You have seen that it did so. I expect\nthat this will give us an immense advantage to begin with. We have\nalready inspired so great a fear that I believe that we can now safely\nfollow the creature into its habitation, and encounter without danger any\nof its congeners that may be there. Nevertheless, I shall not ask you to\nrun any risks, and I will alone descend into the pit.\"\n\n\"If you do, may I be hanged for sheep stealing!\"\n\nYou will guess at once that it was Jack who had spoken thus.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he continued, \"if you go, we all go. Isn't that so, boys?\"\n\nIn answer to an appeal thus put, neither Henry nor myself could have hung\nback even if we had had the disposition to do so. But I believe that we\nall instinctively felt that our place was by Edmund's side, wherever he\nmight choose to go.\n\n\"Go ahead, then, Edmund,\" Jack added, seeing that we consented, \"we're\nwith you.\" And then his enthusiasm taking fire, as usual, he exclaimed:\n\"Hurrah! Columbus forever! We've conquered a hemisphere with a blank\nshot.\"\n\nAnd so we began our descent into the mysterious pit. The strange light\nthat came from it, and formed a shaft in the dense atmosphere above like\nsunlight in a haymow, was accompanied by a considerable degree of heat,\nwhich was very grateful to our lungs after the frigid plunge that we had\ntaken from the comfortable car. As we descended, the temperature\ncontinually rose until we were glad to throw off our Arctic togs, and\nleave them on a shelf of rock to await our return. But, fortunately, we\ndid not forget to take the pistols from the pockets before leaving the\ngarments. I am very uncertain what would have been the future course of\nour history if we had neglected this precaution.\n\nIt was an awful hole for depth. The steps, rudely cut, wound round and\nround the sides like those in a cathedral tower, but the pit was not\nperfectly circular. It looked like a natural formation, such as the\nvertical entrance to a limestone cavern, or the throat of a sleeping\nvolcano. But whatever the nature of the pit might be, I was convinced\nthat the steps were of artificial origin. They were reasonably regular in\nheight and broad enough for two, or even three, persons to go abreast.\n\nWhen we had descended perhaps as much as two hundred feet, we suddenly\nfound ourselves in a broad cavern with a surprisingly level floor. The\ntemperature had been steadily rising all the time, and here it was as\nwarm as in an ordinary living room. The cavern appeared to be about\ntwenty yards broad and eight or ten feet in height, with a flat roof of\nrock. It was dimly illuminated by a small heap of what seemed to be hard\ncoal, burning in a very roughly constructed brazier, which, as far as\nlooks went, one would have said was constructed of iron.\n\nYou will imagine our surprise upon seeing these things. The appearance of\nthe gorilla-like beast with the awful eyes had certainly not led us to\nanticipate the finding in his lair of any such evidences of human\nintelligence, and we stood fast in our tracks for a minute or two, nobody\nspeaking a word. Then Edmund said:\n\n\"This is far better than I hoped. I had not thought about caverns, though\nI ought to have foreseen the probability of something of the kind. It is\nhard to drive out life as long as a world has solid foundations, and air\nfor breathing. I shall be greatly surprised now if these creatures do not\nturn out to be at least as intelligent as our African or Australian\nsavages.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"the fellow that we saw surely cannot have more\nintelligence than a beast. There must be some more highly developed\ncreatures living here.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" Edmund responded. \"Looks go for nothing in\nsuch a case. He had arms and hands, and his brain may be well organized.\"\n\n\"If his brain is as big as his eyes,\" Jack put in, \"he ought to be able\nto give odds to old Solomon and beat him easy. My, but I'd like to see\ntheir spectacles--if they ever wear any!\"\n\nJack's humor recalled us from our meditation, and we began to look about\nmore carefully. There was not a living creature in sight, but over in a\ncorner I detected a broad hole, down which the steps continued to\ndescend.\n\n\"Here's the way,\" said Edmund, discovering the steps at the same moment.\n\"Down we go.\"\n\nHe again led the way, and we resumed the descent. As we stumbled along\ndownward we began to talk of a strange but agreeable odor which we had\nnoticed in the cavern. Edmund said that it was due, perhaps, to some\npeculiar quality of the atmosphere.\n\n\"I think,\" he continued, \"that it is heavily charged with oxygen. You\nhave noticed that none of us feels the slightest fatigue, notwithstanding\nthe precipitancy of our long descent.\"\n\nI reflected that this might also be the cause of our rising courage, for\nI was sure that not one of us felt the slightest fear in thus pushing on\ntoward dangers of whose nature we could form no idea. The steps,\nprecisely like those above, wound round and round and led us down I\nshould say as much as three hundred feet before we entered another\ncavern, larger and loftier than the first.\n\nAnd there we found them!\n\nThere was never another such sight! It made our blood run cold once more,\nrather with surprise than fear, though the latter quickly followed.\n\nRanged along the farther side of the cavern, and visible in the light of\nanother glowing heap in the center, were as many as thirty of those huge\nhairy creatures, standing shoulder to shoulder, their great eyes glaring\nlike bull's-eye lanterns. But the thing that filled us with terror was\ntheir motions.\n\nYou have read, with thrilling nerves, how a huge cobra, reared on his\ncoils, sways his terrible head from side to side before striking. Well,\nall those black heads before us were swaying in unison, but with a\nsickening circular movement, which was regularly reversed in direction.\nThree times by the right and then three times by the left those heads\ncircled, in rhythmic cadence, while the luminous eyes seemed to leave\nphosphorescent rings in the air, intersecting one another in consequence\nof the rapidity of the motion.\n\nIt was such a spectacle as I had never beheld in the wildest dream. It\nwas baleful. It was the charm of the serpent fascinating his terrified\nprey. In an instant I felt my brain turning, and I staggered in spite of\nmy utmost efforts. A kind of paralysis stiffened my limbs.\n\nPresently, all moving together, and uttering a hissing, whistling sound,\nthey began slowly to approach us, keeping in line, each shaggy leg lifted\nat the same moment, like so many soldiers on parade, while the heads\ncontinued to swing, and the glowing eyes to cut linked circles in the\nair. But for Edmund we should certainly have been lost. Standing a little\nto the fore, he spoke to us over his shoulder, in a low voice:\n\n\"Take out your pistols, but don't shoot unless they make a rush. Then\nkill as many as you can. I'll knock over the leader in the center, and I\nthink that will be enough.\"\n\nWe could as easily have stirred our arms if we had been marble statues,\nbut he promptly raised his pistol, and the explosion followed on the\ninstant. The report was like an earthquake. It shocked us into our senses\nand almost out of them again. The weight of the air and the confinement\nof the cavern magnified and concentrated the sound so that it was awful\nbeyond belief. The fellow in the center was hurled back as if shot from a\ncatapult, and the others fell at flat as he, and lay there groveling,\ntheir big eyes filming and swaying, but no longer in unison.\n\nThe charm was broken, and as we saw our fearful enemies prostrate, our\ncourage returned at a bound.\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Edmund coolly. \"But I'm sorry now that I aimed\nat that fellow; the sound alone would have sufficed. It was not necessary\nto take life. However, we should probably have had to come to it\neventually, and now we have them thoroughly cowed. Our safety consists in\nkeeping them terrified.\"\n\nThus speaking, Edmund boldly approached the groveling row, and pushed\nwith his foot the furry body of the one he had shot. The bullet had gone\nthrough his head. At Edmund's approach the creatures sank lower on the\nrocky floor, and those nearest him turned up their moon eyes with an\nexpression of submission and supplication that was grotesque. He motioned\nus to join him and, imitating him, we began to pat and smooth the\nshrinking bodies until, understanding that we would not hurt them, they\ngradually acquired confidence.\n\nIn the meantime the crowd in the cavern increased, others coming in\nthrough side passages, and exhibiting the utmost astonishment at the\nspectacle which greeted them. It was clear that those who had taken part\nin the opening scene imparted to the newcomers a knowledge of the\nsituation of affairs, and we could see that our prestige was thoroughly\nestablished. It remained to utilize our advantage, and we looked to\nEdmund to show how it should be done. He was equal to the undertaking,\nbut I shall not trouble you with the details of his diplomacy. Let it\nsuffice to say that by a combination of gentleness and firmness he\nquickly reduced almost the entire population of the caverns (for, as we\nafterwards discovered, there were a dozen or more of these underground\ndwellings connected by horizontal passages through the rocks) into\nsubjection to his will. I say \"almost,\" because, as you will see in a\nlittle while, there were certain members of this extraordinary community\nwho possessed a spirit of independence too strong to be so easily\nsubdued.\n\nAs we became better acquainted with the cave dwellers we found that they\nwere by no means as savage as they looked. Their appearance was certainly\ngrotesque, and even unaccountable. Why, for instance, should their heads\nhave been covered with coarse black disordered hair while their bodies,\nfrom the neck down, were almost beautiful with a natural raiment of\ngolden white, as soft as silk and as brilliant as floss? I never could\nexplain it, and Edmund was no less puzzled by this peculiarity. The\nimmense size of their eyes did not seem astonishing after we began to\nreflect upon the consequences of the relative lack of light in their\nworld. It was but a natural adjustment to their environment; with such\neyes they could see in the dark better than cats. Their feet were bare\nand covered on the soles with thick soft skin, while the insides of their\nlong hands were almost as white and delicate as those of a human being.\n\nTheir intelligence was sufficiently demonstrated by the construction of\nthe hundreds of rocky steps leading from the caverns to the surface of\nthe ground, and by their employment of fire, and manufacture of the\nmetallic braziers which contained it. But this was not all. We found that\nin some of the winding passages connecting the caverns they cultivated\nfood. It consisted entirely of vegetables of various kinds, and all\nunlike any that I ever saw on the earth. Water dripped from the roofs of\nthese particular passages, and the almost colorless vegetation thrived\nthere with astonishing luxuriance. They had many simple ways of cooking\ntheir food, and it was evident that they possessed some form of salt,\nthough we did not discover the deposit from which they must have drawn\nit. They collected water in cisterns hollowed in the rock.\n\nAlthough we still had abundance of food in the car, Edmund insisted on\ntrying theirs, and it proved to be very palatable.\n\n\"This is fortunate, though hardly surprising,\" said Edmund. \"If we had\nfound the food on Venus uneatable, we should indeed have been in a fine\nfix. While we remain here we will eat as the natives eat, and save our\nown supplies for future need.\"\n\nThe only brute animals that we saw in the caverns were some doglike\ncreatures, about as large as terriers, but very furry, which showed the\nutmost terror whenever we appeared.\n\nOne of the first things that we discovered outside the main cavern where\nwe had made our debut was the burial ground of the community. This\nhappened when they came to dispose of the fellow that Edmund had shot.\nThey formed a regular procession, which greatly impressed us, and we\nfollowed them as they bore the body through several winding ways into a\nlarge cavern, at a considerable distance from any of the others. Here\nthey had dug a grave, and, to our astonishment, there appeared to be\nsomething resembling a religious ceremony connected with the interment.\nAnd then, for the first time, we distinguished the females from the\nothers. But a still greater surprise awaited us. It was no less than\nplain evidence of regular family relationship.\n\nAs the body was lowered into the grave one of the females approached with\nevery sign of distress and sorrow. Jack declared that he saw tears\nrunning down her hairy cheeks. She held two little ones by the hand, and\nthis spectacle produced an astonishing effect upon Edmund, revealing an\nentirely new side of his character. I have told you that he expressed\nregret for having killed the fellow in the cavern, but now, at the sight\nbefore him, he seemed filled with remorse.\n\n\"I wish I had never come here!\" he said bitterly. \"The first thing I have\ndone is to kill an inoffensive and intelligent creature.\"\n\n\"Intelligent, perhaps,\" said Jack, \"but inoffensive--not by a long shot!\nWhere'd we have been if you hadn't killed him? They'd have made mincemeat\nof us.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Edmund, sorrowfully shaking his head, \"it wasn't necessary.\nThe noise would have sufficed; and I ought to have known it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you shout, then? That scared the first one,\" put in Henry,\nwhose soul, it must be said, was not overflowing with sympathy.\n\n\"I did what I thought was best at the moment,\" Edmund replied, with a\nbroken voice. \"They were so many and so threatening that I imagined my\nvoice alone might not be effective. But I'm sorry, sorry!\"\n\n\"Henry, you're a fool!\" cried the sympathetic Jack. \"Come now, Edmund,\"\nhe continued, kindly laying a hand on his shoulder, \"what you did was the\nonly thing under heaven that could have been done. You're wrong to blame\nyourself. By Jo, if you hadn't done it I would!\"\n\nBut Edmund only shook his head, as if refusing to be comforted. It was\nthe first sign of weakness that we had seen in our incomparable leader,\nbut I am sure it only increased our respect for him--at least that's true\nof Jack and me. After that I noticed that Edmund was far more gentle than\nbefore in his relations with the people of the caverns.\n\nNot long after this painful incident we made a discovery of extreme\ninterest. It was nothing less than a big smithy! Edmund had foretold that\nwe should find something of the kind.\n\n\"Those braziers and cooking pots,\" he had said, \"and the tools that must\nhave been needed to build the steps and to dig their graves, prove that\nthey know how to work in iron. If it is not done in these caverns, then\nthey get it from some other similar community. But I think it likely that\nwe shall come upon some signs of the work hereabouts.\"\n\n\"Maybe they import it from Pittsburg,\" was the remark that fun-loving\nJack could not refrain from making.\n\n\"Well, you'll see,\" said Edmund.\n\nAnd, as I have already told you, he was right. We did find the smithy,\nwith several stout fellows pounding out rude tools with equally rude\nhammers of iron. Of course we could ask them no questions, for their\nlanguage was only a kind of squeak, and they seemed to converse mostly by\nmeans of expressive signs. But Edmund was not long in drawing his\nconclusions.\n\n\"This,\" he said, after closely examining the metal, \"is native iron.\nThere's nothing remarkable in the fact that it should be here. All the\nsolid planets, as you know\" (turning to me), \"are very largely composed\nof iron, and Venus, being nearer the center of the system, may have\nproportionally more of it than the earth. And these fellows have found\nout its usefulness, and how to work it. There's nothing surprising in\nthat, either, for some of our savages have done as much on the earth. Now\nI'll make another prediction--we are going to find coal here. That is\ninevitable, since we know that they burn it in the caverns. I shouldn't\nwonder if it were close at hand, from the look of these rocks.\"\n\nHe approached the wall of the cavern containing the smithy, and\nimmediately exclaimed:\n\n\"Look here! Here it is!\"\n\nAnd sure enough, on joining him we saw a seam of as fine anthracite as\nPennsylvania ever produced.\n\n\"A Carboniferous Age on Venus!\" Edmund continued. \"What do you think of\nthat? But, of course, it was sure to be so; all the planets that are old\nenough have been through practically the same stages. Think of it! The\nplants that gave origin to this coal must have flourished here when Venus\nstill rotated on her axis rapidly enough to have day and night succeeding\none another on all sides of her, for now no vegetation except the\ninsignificant plants that grow in these caverns can live on this\nhemisphere. And think, too, of the countless ages that must have been\nconsumed in slowing down her rotation by the friction of her ocean\ntides.\"\n\n\"Has Venus got any oceans?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I haven't a doubt of it; but we shall find none on this side, although\nthey must once have been here.\"\n\nWe all mused for a time on the subject that Edmund had started, when\nsuddenly his face lighted up with the greatest animation, and he\nexclaimed, but as if speaking to himself rather than to us:\n\n\"Capital! It couldn't have happened better!\"\n\n\"What's capital?\" drawled Jack.\n\n\"Why, this smithy, and these Tubal Cains here. Unconsciously they have\nsolved for me a problem that has given me considerable trouble. Almost as\nsoon as we got acquainted with the people of the caverns the idea\noccurred to me that I should like to take some of them with us when we\nvisit the other hemisphere. There are many interesting observations that\ntheir presence on that side of Venus would give rise to, and, besides,\nthey might be of great use to us. Of course I meant to bring them back to\ntheir home. But the puzzling question has been how to transport them. The\ncar has a full load already.\"\n\n\"They've got good legs; make 'em walk,\" said Jack.\n\nEdmund burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Why, Jack,\" he asked, \"how far do you think it is to the other side of\nVenus?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Jack, \"but I suppose it's not very far round her.\nHow far is it?\"\n\n\"Five thousand miles, at least, to the edge of the sunlit hemisphere.\"\n\nJack whistled.\n\n\"By Jo! I wouldn't have believed it.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a fact,\" said Edmund, \"and of course I don't propose to take\nseveral months to make the journey. Now the sight of these fellows at\nwork has shown me just how it can be done in short order. It's this way:\nI'll have iron sleds made, put the natives that I propose to take along\nupon them, hitch them by wire cables, which luckily I've got, to the car,\nand away we'll spin. The power of the car is practically unlimited, and,\nas you have observed, the ground is as flat and smooth as a prairie, and,\nmoreover, is coated with an icy covering.\"\n\nJack glowed with enthusiasm over this project, and was about to indulge\nin one of his characteristic outbreaks, when there came an interruption\nwhich ended in a drama that put silver streaks among my coal-black locks!\nSome one came in where we were and called off the workmen, who went out\nwith the others in great haste. Of course we followed at their heels. On\nreaching the principal cavern, we found a singular scene. Two natives,\nwhom we had never seen before, were evidently in charge of some kind of a\nceremony. They wore tall, conical hats made of polished metal and covered\nwith hieroglyphics, and carried staves of iron in their hands.\n\n\"Priests,\" Edmund immediately whispered. \"Now we'll see something\ninteresting.\"\n\nThe \"priests\" marshaled all the others, numbering several hundreds, into\na long column, and then began a slow, solemn march up the steps. The\nleaders produced a squeaking music by blowing into the ends of their\nstaves. Women were mingled with men, and even the children were there,\ntoo. We followed at the tail of the procession, our curiosity at the\nhighest pitch. At the rate we went it must have taken nearly an hour to\nmount the steps, but at last all emerged in the open air, where the cold\nstruck to our marrow. The natives didn't seem to mind it, but we ran back\nand donned our furs. Then we re-ascended and stepped out into the Arctic\nnight, finding the crowd assembled not far from the entrance to the\ncavern. The frosty sky was ablaze with stars, and directly overhead shone\na planet of amazing size and splendor with a little one beside it.\n\n\"The earth and the moon!\" exclaimed Edmund.\n\nI cannot describe the flood of feeling that went over me at that sight!\nBut in a moment Edmund interrupted my meditation by saying, in a quick,\nnervous way:\n\n\"_Look at that!_\"\n\nThe natives had formed themselves in a circle with the two priests\nstanding alone in the center. All but these two had dropped on their\nknees, while the leaders, elevating their long arms toward the zenith,\ngazed upward, uttering a kind of chant in their queer, squeaking voices.\n\n\"Don't you see what they're about?\" demanded Edmund, twitching me\nirritably by the sleeve. \"They're worshipping the earth!\"\n\nIt was the truth--the amazing truth! They were worshipping our planet in\nthe sky! And, indeed, she looked worth worshipping. Never have I seen so\nsplendid a star. She was twenty times as bright as the most brilliant\nplanet that any terrestrial astronomer ever beheld; and the moon, glowing\nbeside her like an attendant, redoubled the beauty of the sight.\n\n\"It's just the moment of the conjunction,\" said Edmund. \"This is their\nreligion; the earth is their goddess, and when she is nearest and\nbrightest they perform this ceremony in her honor. I wouldn't have missed\nthis for a world.\"\n\nSuddenly the two priests began to pirouette, and as they whirled more and\nmore rapidly, their huge glowing eyes made phosphorescent circles in the\ngloom like those that had so alarmed and fascinated us in the cavern.\nThey gyrated round the ring of worshipers with accelerated speed, and all\nthose poor creatures fell under the fascination and drooped with heads to\nthe ground. Now for the first time I caught sight of an oblong object\nrising a couple of feet above the ground in the center of the circle. I\nwas wondering what it might be when the spinning priests, who had\ngradually drawn closer to the ring of worshipers, dived into the circle,\nand, catching each a native in his arms, ran with their captives to the\ncurious object that I have just described.\n\n\"It's a sacrificial stone!\" exclaimed Edmund. \"They're going to kill them\nas an offering to the earth and her child the moon.\"\n\nI was frozen with horror at the sight, but just as the second priest\nreached the altar, where the first victim had already been pinned with\nthe sharp point of the sacrificial staff, his captive, suddenly\nrecovering his senses, and terrified by the awful fate confronting him,\nuttered a cry, wrenched himself loose, and, running like the wind, leaped\nover the circle and disappeared in the darkness. The fugitive passed\nclose by us, and Jack shouted as he darted past:\n\n\"Good boy!\"\n\nThe enraged priest was after him like lightning, and as he came near us\nhis awful eyes seemed to emit actual flames. But the runner had vanished.\nWithout an instant's hesitation the priest shot out his great arm and\ncaught _me_ by the throat! In another second I felt myself carried in a\nbound, as if a tiger had seized me, over the drooping heads of the\nworshipers and toward the horrible altar.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nOFF FOR THE SUN LANDS\n\nDreadful as the moment was, I did not lose my senses. On the contrary, my\nmind was fearfully clear and active. There was not a horror that I\nmissed. The strength and agility of my captor were astounding. I could no\nmore have struggled with him than with a lion. Only one thing flashed\nupon me to do; I yelled with all the strength of my lungs. But they had\nbecome accustomed to our voices now, and the maddened creature was so\nintent upon his fell purpose that a cannon-shot would not have diverted\nhim from it.\n\nHe got me to the altar, where the preceding victim already lay with his\nheart torn out, and, pressing me against it with all his bestial force,\nraised the pointed staff to transfix me. With dying eyes I saw the earth\ngleaming, magnificent, directly over my head, and my heart bounded with\nunreasoning hope at the sight. It was my mother planet, powerful to save!\n\nAll this passed in a second, while the dreadful spear was poised for its\nwork. Even in that fraction of time I noticed the bunching muscles of the\nmurderer's hairy arm, and then I pressed my eyes shut.\n\n_Bang!_\n\nSomething touched me, and I felt the warm blood gushing. Then I knew no\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the midst of a dream of boyhood scenes a murmur of familiar voices\nawoke me. I opened my eyes, but as I could not make out where I was,\nclosed them again.\n\nThen I heard Edmund saying:\n\n\"He's coming out all right.\"\n\nThereupon, I reopened my eyes, but still the scene puzzled me. I saw\nEdmund's face, and behind those of Jack and Henry, wearing anxious looks.\nBut this was not my room! It seemed to be a cave, with faint firelight\nreflections on the walls.\n\n\"Where am I?\" I asked.\n\n\"Back in the cavern, and coming along all right,\" said Edmund.\n\nBack in the cavern! What did he mean? Then, suddenly, memory returned.\n\n\"So he didn't sacrifice me!\" I cried.\n\n\"Not on your life!\" Jack's hearty voice responded. \"Edmund was too quick\nfor that.\"\n\n\"But only by a fraction of a second!\" said Edmund, smiling.\n\n\"What happened, then?\" I asked, my recollections coming back stronger and\nstronger.\n\n\"A mighty good shot happened,\" said Jack. \"The best I ever saw.\"\n\nI looked inquiringly at Edmund. He saw that I could bear it, and he\nbegan:\n\n\"When that fellow snatched you up and leaped inside the circle I had my\nfurs wrapped so closely around me, not anticipating any danger, that for\nquite ten seconds I was unable to get out my pistol. I tore the garment\nopen just in time, for already he was pressing you against the accursed\naltar with his spear poised. I didn't waste any time finding my aim, but\neven as it was the iron point had touched you when the bullet crashed\nthrough his brain. The shock swerved the weapon a little and you were\nonly wounded in the shoulder. You got a scratch which might have been\nserious but for your Arctic coat. The fellow fell dead beside you, and\nunder the circumstances I felt compelled to shoot the other one also, for\nhe was insane with the delirium of their bloody rite, and I knew that our\nlives would never be safe if he remained ready for mischief.\n\n\"I'm sorry to have had to begin killing right and left again, but I guess\nthat's the lot of all invaders, wherever they may go. It's the second\nlesson for these savages, and I believe it will prove final. When their\npriests were dead and the others had no fight in them, even if they had\nintended any harm to us.  Nobody knows to what those chaps might have led\nthem, and my conscience is easy this time.\"\n\n\"How long have I been here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Two days by the calendar clock?\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Yes, two days,\" Edmund assented. \"I never saw a man so knocked out by a\nshock, for the wound wasn't much; I fixed that up in five minutes. But I\ndon't blame you. In your place I should have been scared to the bottom of\nmy soul also. But look at yourself.\"\n\nHe held a pocket mirror before me, and then I saw that my hair was\nstreaked with gray!\n\n\"But we haven't been idle in the meanwhile,\" Edmund went on. \"I've got\ntwo sleds nearly completed, and to-morrow at midnight--earth time--I mean\nto set out for the sunny lands of Venus.\"\n\n\"How in the world could you have worked so fast?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"Because I had certain tools in the car which vastly facilitated the\noperation; but I must admit that the savage blacksmiths worked well, too,\nand showed surprising intelligence in comprehending my directions.\nPerhaps that was because I had learned their language.\"\n\n\"Learned their language!\" I exclaimed, staring in amazement.\n\n\"Well, perhaps that's putting it a little too strong; but I have learned\nenough to establish a pretty good understanding with them. There's\nnothing like working together to make intelligent creatures comprehend\none another.\"\n\n\"But what kind of a language is it, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"A language to make your hair stand on end,\" put in Jack. \"The language\nthat ghosts speak, I reckon! Not that I understand the least little bit\nof it, but I judge from what Edmund says.\"\n\nWith increasing bewilderment I looked at our leader. He smiled, and then\nlooked thoughtful for a moment before again speaking. At last he said:\n\n\"It's a subject that I may be better able to discuss after I have learned\nmore about it. All I can say at present is that it appears to be a kind\nof telepathy. You know that their voices seem hardly more cultivated, or\ncapable of regular articulation, than those of mere brutes; and, besides,\nthey have a certain horror of sound. These smiths wear coverings over\ntheir ears to minify the noise of their hammering. Yet they are able to\nconverse, partly by physical signs, but more, I am sure, by some means\nwhich they possess of transferring thought without the mediation of any\nsenses familiar to us. Sometimes I imagine that their extraordinary eyes\nplay a large part in the phenomenon. But, however that may be, they\ncertainly are able to read some of my thoughts, when we are in close\nrelations and working together. One of them is especially gifted in this\nway, and what do you think? I have discovered his name!\"\n\n\"Now, Edmund--\" I began incredulously.\n\n\"Yes,\" he persisted, \"it's a fact. You are to remember that they do\ninterchange some of their ideas by means of sounds, and they have certain\nwords, among which I am disposed to think are their individual\ndesignations. One of these words particularly attracted my attention\nbecause I observed that it was always addressed to the person I have just\nspoken of, and I finally concluded that it was his name. As near as I can\nimitate it, it sounds something like 'Juba.' So that's what I call him,\nand he's going to be the chief of the party that I propose to take with\nus. His services may be invaluable to us.\"\n\nA great deal more was said on this curious subject, but since we did not\narrive at a complete understanding of it until after we had reached the\nother side of the planet, I shall postpone any further explanation to the\nchapters which will be devoted to our astonishing adventures on that part\nof Venus.\n\nMy wound, as Edmund had said, was very slight, and the effects of the\nshock having passed off during the period of my unconsciousness, I was\nsoon busy with the others in making the final preparations for our\ndeparture. The sleds were, of course, very rude affairs, but they were\nalso very strong. Among the innumerable stores which Edmund's foresight\nhad led him to put into the car were a number of exceedingly strong but\nlight metallic cables. With these the two sleds were hitched, one behind\nthe other, and a line about a hundred feet long connected them with the\ncar. The latter could thus rise to a considerable height without lifting\nthe sleds from the ground.\n\nThe sleds were provisioned from the stores of the natives, and we also\ntook some of their food in the car, not only to eke out our own but\nbecause we had come to like it.\n\nEdmund had already chosen the fellows who were to accompany us, and among\nthem were two of the smiths besides Juba. In all they were eight. How he\nsucceeded in persuading them I do not know, but not the slightest\nobjection was apparent on their part, or on the part of their compatriots\nin the caverns. We were all ready at the predetermined time, and the\nscene at our departure was a strange one.\n\nAt least five hundred natives had assembled in a furry crowd around the\nentrance to the caverns to see us off. When we started, the fellows on\nthe sleds, being unused to the motion, clung together like so many\nawkward white bears taking a ride in the circus. Their friends stood\nabout the ill-omened sacrificial altar, waving their long arms, while\ntheir huge eyes goggled in the starlight.\n\nJack, in a burst of enthusiasm, fired four or five parting shots from his\npistol. As the reports crashed through the heavy air, you should have\nseen the crowd vanish down the hole! The sight made me wince, for they\nmust have gone down like a cataract, all heaped together. But they were\ntough, and I trust no heads were broken. The effect on the eight fellows\non the sleds came near being disastrous. I expected to see them leap off\nand run, which no doubt they would have done if Edmund had not taken, for\nother reasons, the precaution to tie them fast. But they strained at\ntheir bonds, and squealed in terror.\n\n\"Give me your pistol!\" commanded Edmund, in a voice of thunder, and with\nblazing eyes.\n\nJack was almost twice his size, but he handed over the pistol with the\nair of a rebuked schoolboy.\n\n\"When you learn how to use it, I'll give it back to you,\" said Edmund\nsternly, and that closed the incident.\n\nThen we began gradually to put on speed, and as the ground was icy smooth\nand entirely unobstructed, we were soon traveling at the rate of sixty\nmiles an hour. The plan of the sleds worked like magic, and after their\nfirst terror had passed away it was plain to be seen that the natives\nenjoyed the new sensation immensely. And, indeed, it was a glorious spin!\n\nBut in a little while a danger developed which we had not thought of. It\narose from the existence of other caverns whose mouths opened upon the\nplain. To have precipitated the sleds into these would have been fatal.\nLuckily, shafts of light issued from all of them, and warned by these, we\nmanaged to avoid the danger. But it was not entirely passed before we had\ntraveled at least a hundred miles. It was like an immense city of prairie\ndogs without mounds. The cavern that we had discovered on our arrival was\nevidently situated on the outskirts of the group, and now we were passing\nthrough the center of it. Occasionally we saw a huge white form disappear\nin one of the holes as we swiftly approached, but that was all we beheld\nof the inhabitants. But the spectacle of the shafts of light rising all\naround us was amazing. When we were in the midst of it Edmund hesitated\nfor a moment, muttering that we had been too hasty and should have\nremained longer to study the peculiarities of this wonderful world of\nnight; but finally he decided to keep on, and soon afterwards we saw the\nlast of the caverns. Then, as there appeared to be no obstructions of any\nkind, the speed was worked up to a hundred miles an hour. Going straight\nahead as we did, there was no danger of the sleds being overturned.\n\nHaving, as Edmund had calculated, about five thousand miles to go before\nreaching the edge of the sun-illuminated hemisphere, it was evident that,\nat our present rate of progress, we should arrive there in a little over\ntwo days by the calendar clock. We guided our course by the stars, and\nfor me one of the most interesting things was to see the earth sinking\ntoward the horizon, accompanied by the stars, as if the heavens were\nrevolving in a direction opposed to our line of travel. We smoked and\ntalked and ate and slept in the old way, while the marvelous mouths in\nthe wall resumed their strange deglutition. Thus the time passed, without\nennui, until, unexpectedly, a new phenomenon captured our attention.\n\nAhead, through the peephole, Edmund had descried again the flaming spires\nwhich had so astonished us on our approach to Venus. But now their\nappearance was splendid and imposing beyond words. Above them rose an arc\nof pearly light which grew higher every hour. And with the arc of light\nrose the flames also. At the same time they seemed to spread to the right\nand the left, until they were simultaneously visible from both of the\nside windows of the car. Their colors were wonderful--red, green, purple,\norange--all the hues of the prism.\n\n\"There is the old mystery again,\" exclaimed Edmund, \"and I can no more\nexplain it now than I could when we first saw it on nearing the planet.\nThe arc of light above is natural enough; it's simply the dawn. The sun\nnever rises on this side of Venus, but it will rise for us because we are\napproaching it, and the light is the first indication that we are getting\nnear enough to the border between day and night for some of the sun's\nrays to be bent over the horizon by refraction. But those flames! See how\nsteady they are as a whole, and yet how they change color like a slowly\nturning prism.\"\n\n\"Don't, for God's sake, run us into a conflagration,\" said Jack. \"I'm\nready to believe anything of this topsy-turvy old planet, and I shouldn't\nbe surprised if the other side is all fire as this one is all frost.  I\ncan stand these hairy beasts, but I'll be hanged if I want to be\nintroduced among salamanders.\"\n\n\"That's not real fire,\" said Edmund. \"When we get a little nearer we can\nsee what it is. In the meantime I'll try to think it out.\"\n\nThe result of Edmund's meditations, when he announced it to us, an hour\nlater, awoke as much amazement in our minds as anything that had yet\noccurred. He had been sitting silent in his corner, occasionally taking a\nglimpse through the peephole, or one of the windows, when suddenly he\nslapped his thigh, and springing to his feet, exclaimed:\n\n\"They're mountains of crystal!\"\n\n\"Mountains of crystal!\" we echoed.\n\n\"Nothing else in the world, and I am ashamed not to have foreseen the\nthing. It's plain enough when you come to think about it. Remember that\nVenus being a world lying half in the daylight and half in the night, is\nnecessarily as hot on one side as it is cold on the other. All of the\nclouds and floating vapors are on the day side, where the sunbeams act.\nThe heated air charged with moisture rises over the sunward hemisphere,\nand flows off above, on all sides, toward the night side, while from the\nlatter cold air flows in beneath to take its place. Along the junction of\nthe two hemispheres the clouds and moisture are condensed by the intense\ncold, and fall in ceaseless snowstorms. This snow descending for ages has\npiled up in mountainous masses whose height may be increased in some\nplaces by real mountain ranges buried beneath. The atmospheric moisture\ncannot pass very far into the night hemisphere without being condensed,\nand so it is all arrested within a ring, or band, extending completely\naround the planet, and marking the division between perpetual day and\nperpetual night. The appearance of gigantic flames is produced by the\nsunbeams striking these mountains of ice and snow from behind and\nbreaking into prismatic fire.\"\n\nWe listened to this explanation, so simple and yet so wonderful, with\nmingled feelings of astonishment and admiration. And then we turned again\nto regard the phenomenon, which now, with our nearer approach, had become\nsplendid and awful beyond description.\n\nIn a few minutes Edmund addressed us again. \"I foresee now,\" he said,\n\"considerable trouble for us. There has been a warning of that, too, if I\nhad but heeded it. I've noticed for some time that a wind, getting\ngradually stronger, has been following us, sometimes dying out and then\ncoming on again stronger than before. It is likely that this wind gets to\nbe a perfect hurricane in the neighborhood of those strange mountains. It\nis the back suction, caused, as I have already told you, by the rising of\nthe heated air on the sunny side of the planet. It may play the deuce\nwith us when we get into the midst of it. I shall have to be cautious.\"\n\nHe immediately reduced the speed to not more than ten miles an hour, and\nat once we noticed the wind of which he had spoken. It came now in great\ngusts from behind, rapidly increasing in frequency and fury. Soon it was\nstrong enough to drive the sleds without any pull upon the cable, and\nsometimes they were forced directly under the car, and even ahead of it,\nthe natives clinging to one another in the utmost terror. Edmund managed\nto govern the motions of the car for a time, holding it back against the\nstorm, but as he confessed, this was a contingency he had made no\nprovision for, and eventually we became almost as helpless as a ship in a\ntyphoon.\n\n\"Of course I could cut loose from the sleds and run right out of this,\"\nsaid Edmund, \"but that would never do. I've taken them into my service\nand I'm bound to look out for them. If there was room for them in the car\nit would be all right. Let's see. Yes! I've got it. I'll fetch up the\nsleds and fasten them underneath the car, like baskets to a balloon, and\nso carry the whole thing. There's plenty of power; it's only room that's\nwanting.\"\n\nNo sooner said than done with Edmund. By this time we were getting into\nthe ice, huge hills of which surrounded us. Edmund dropped the car in the\nlee of one of these strange hummocks. Here the force of the wind was\nbroken, and the sky directly over us was free from clouds, but a short\ndistance ahead we could see them whirling and tumbling in mighty masses\nof tumultuous vapor. Lashing the two sleds together we attached them\nabout ten feet below the bottom of the car. Then the natives, who had\nbeen unbound, and had stood looking on in utter bewilderment, were\nsecurely fastened on the sleds. We entered the car and the power was\nturned on.\n\n\"We'll rise straight up,\" said Edmund, \"and as soon as we are out of the\nwind current we will sail over the mountains and come down on the other\nside as nice as you please. Strange that I didn't think of carrying the\nsleds in this way to begin with.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful program that Edmund had outlined, and we had complete\nconfidence in our leader's ability to carry it through; but it didn't\nwork as expected. Even his genius had met its match this time.\n\nNo sooner had we risen out of the protection of the hill of ice than the\nhurricane caught us. It was a blast of such power and ferocity that in an\ninstant it had the car spinning like a teetotum, and then it shot us\nahead, banging the sleds against the car as if they had been tassels. It\nis a wonder of wonders that the poor creatures on them were not flung\noff, but fortunately we had taken particular pains with their lashings,\nand as for knocks, they could stand them like so many bears.\n\nIn the course of twenty minutes we must have traveled twice as many\nmiles, perfectly helpless to arrest our mad rush because, Edmund said,\nthe atomic reaction partly refused to work, and he could not rise as he\nhad expected to do. We were pitched hither and thither, and were\nsprawling on the floor more than half the time. The noise was awful, and\nnobody tried to speak after Edmund had shouted his single communication\nabout the power, which would have filled us with dismay if we had had\nleisure to think.\n\nThe shutters were open, and suddenly I saw through one of the windows a\nsight which I thought must surely be my last. The car had been sweeping\nthrough a dense cloud of boiling vapors, and these had without warning\nsplit open before my eyes--and there, almost in contact with the car, was\na glittering precipice of solid ice, gleaming with wicked blue flashes,\nand we were rushing upon it as if shot out of a cannon!\n\nThe next instant came a terrific shock, which I thought must have crushed\nthe car like an eggshell, and down we fell--down and down!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nLOST IN THE CRYSTAL MOUNTAINS\n\nIf we had seen the danger earlier, and had not been so tumbled about by\nthe pitching of the car, it is possible that Edmund would have prevented\nthe collision, in spite of the partial disablement of his apparatus. The\nblow against the precipice of ice was not as severe as it had seemed to\nme, and the car was not smashed; but the fall was terrible! There was\nonly one thing which saved us from destruction. At the base of the mighty\ncliff against which the wind had hurled the car an immense deposit of\nsnow had collected, and into this we plunged. We were all thrown together\nin a heap, the car and the sleds being entangled with the wire ropes.\n\nFortunately the stout glass windows were not broken, and after we had\nstruggled to our feet Edmund managed to open the door. Before emerging he\nbade us put on our furs, but even with them we found the cold outside all\nbut unendurable. Yet the natives paid no attention to it. Not one of them\nwas seriously hurt, although they were firmly attached to the sleds, and\nunable to undo their fastenings. We set them loose, and then began\nseriously to examine the situation.\n\nAbove us towered the vertical precipice disappearing in the whirling\nclouds, and the wind drove square against it with the roar of Niagara.\nThe air was filled with snow and ice dust, and at intervals we could not\nsee objects three feet away from our noses. Our poor furry companions\nhuddled together, and being of no use to themselves or us, suffered more\nfrom the noise, and from the terror inspired by the snow than from any\ninjuries that they had received.\n\n\"We've got to get out of this mighty quick,\" shouted Edward. \"Hustle now\nand repair ship.\"\n\nWe got to work at once, Juba aiding us a little under Edmund's direction,\nand soon we had the sleds out of the tangle and properly attached. Then\nwe replaced the natives on their seats, and entered the car. Edmund began\nto fumble with his apparatus. After some ten minutes' work he said, in an\nevasive way, that the damage was not serious enough to prevent the\nworking of the car, but I thought I caught an expression of extreme\nanxiety in his face. Still, his manner indicated that he considered\nhimself master of the situation.\n\n\"You notice,\" he said, \"that this wind is variable, and there lies our\nchance. When the blasts weaken, the air springs back from the face of the\ncliff and then whirls round to the right. I've no doubt that there is a\npassage in that direction through which the wind finds its way behind\nthis icy mountain, and if we can get there, too, we shall undoubtedly\nfind at least partial shelter. I'm going to take advantage of the first\nlull.\"\n\nIt worked out just as he had predicted. As the wind surged back after a\nparticularly vicious rush against the great blue cliff, we cut loose and\nwent sailing up into it, rushing past the glittering wall so swiftly that\nit made our heads swim. In two or three minutes we rounded a corner, and\nthen found ourselves in a kind of atmospheric eddy, where the car simply\nspun round and round, with the sleds whirling below it.\n\n\"Now for it!\" shouted Edmund. \"Hang on!\"\n\nHe touched a knob, and instantly we rose with immense speed. We must have\nshot up a couple of thousand feet, when the wind, coming over the top of\nthe icy barrier we had just flanked, caught us again, and swept us off on\na horizontal course. Then, suddenly, the air cleared all round about, as\nif a magic broom had swept away the clouds. The spectacle that was\nrevealed--but why try to describe it! No language could do it. Yet I must\ntell you what we saw.\n\nWe were in the heart of the _Crystal Mountains!_ They towered round us on\nevery side, and stretched away in interminable ranges of shining\npinnacles. Such shapes! Such colors! Such flashing and blazing of\ngigantic rainbows and prisms! There were mountains that looked to my\namazed eyes as lofty as Mont Blanc, and as massive, every solid mile of\nwhich was composed of crystalline ice, refracting and reflecting the\nsunbeams with iridescent splendor. For now we could begin to see a part\nof the orb of the sun itself, prodigious in size, and poised on the edge\nof the gem-glittering horizon, where the jeweled summits split its beams\ninto a thousand haloes.\n\nThere was one mighty peak, still ahead of us, but toward which we were\nrushed sidewise by the wind, which surpassed all the others in\nmarvelousness. It towered majestically above our level--a superb,\nstupendous, coruscating _Alp of Light_! On every side it darted blinding\nrays of a hundred splendid hues, as if a worldful of emeralds, rubies,\nsapphires, and diamonds had been heaped together in one gigantic pile and\ntransfused with a sunburst. Even Edmund was for a moment speechless with\nastonishment at this wildly magnificent sight. But presently he spoke,\nvery calmly, though what he said changed our amazement to terror.\n\n\"The trouble with the apparatus is very serious. I am unable to make the\ncar rise higher. It will no longer react against an obstacle. We are\nentirely at the mercy of the wind. If it carries us against that\nglittering devil no power under heaven can save us.\"\n\nIf my hair had not whitened before it surely would have whitened now!\n\n[Illustration: \"We were in the heart of the _Crystal Mountains_!\"]\n\nWhen we were swept against the first icy precipice the danger had come\nunexpectedly, out of a concealing cloud, and anticipation was swallowed\nup in the event. But now we had to bear the fearful strain of\nexpectation, with the paralyzing knowledge that nothing that we could do\ncould aid us in the least. I thought that even Edmund's face paled with\nfear.\n\nOn we rushed, still borne sidewise, so that the spectacle was burned into\nour eyes, as, with the fascination of impending death, we gazed helpless\nout of the window. Now we were upon it! Instinctively I threw myself\nbackward; but the blow did not come. Instead there was a wild rush of ice\ncrystals sweeping the thick glass.\n\n\"Look!\" shouted Edmund. \"We are safe! See how the particles of ice are\nswept from the face of the peak by the tempest. They leap toward us, and\nare then whirled round the mountain. The compacted air forms a buffer. We\nmay yet touch the precipice, but the wind, having free vent on both\nsides, will carry us one way or the other without a serious shock.\"\n\nHe had hardly finished speaking, in a voice that had risen to a shriek\nwith the effort to make himself heard, when the crisis came. We did just\ntouch a projecting ridge, but the wind, howling past it, carried us in an\ninstant round the obstruction.\n\n\"Scared ourselves for nothing,\" said Edmund, in a quieter voice, as the\nroar died down. \"We were really as safe all the time as a boat in a deep\nrapid. The velocity of the current sheered us off.\"\n\nOur hearts beat more steadily again, but there was a greater danger, of\nwhich he had warned us, but which we had not had time to contemplate. I,\nat least, began to think of it with dismay when the scintillant peak was\nleft behind, and I saw Edmund again working away at his machinery.\nPresently it was manifest that we were rapidly sinking.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I cried. \"We seem to be going down.\"\n\n\"So we are,\" he replied quietly, \"and I fear that we shall not go up\nagain very soon. The power is failing all the time. It will be pretty\nhard to have to stop indefinitely in this frightful place, but I am\nafraid that that is our destiny.\"\n\nLost and helpless in these mountains of ice and this world of gloom and\nstorm! The thought was too terrible to be entertained. Yet it was forced\ninto our minds even more by our leader's manner than by his words. Not\none of us failed to comprehend its meaning, and it was characteristic\nthat, while talkative Jack now said not a word, uncommunicative Henry\nburst into a brief fury of denunciation. I was startled by the energy of\nhis words:\n\n\"Edmund Stonewall,\" he cried, agitating his arms, \"you have brought me to\nmy death with your infernal invention! May you be--\"\n\nBut he never finished the sentence. His face turned as white as a sheet,\nand he sank in a heap upon the floor.\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" said Edmund, pityingly. \"Would to God that he instead of\nChurch had remained at home. But I'll get him and all of us out of this\ntrouble; only give me a little time.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Jack and I had restored Henry to his senses, but he was\nas weak as a child, and remained lying on one of the cushioned benches.\nIn the meantime the car descended until at last it rested upon the snow\nin a deep valley, where we were protected from the wind. In this profound\ndepression a kind of twilight prevailed, for the sun, which we had\nglimpsed when we were on the level of the peaks, was at least thirty\ndegrees below our present horizon. Henry having recovered his nerve, we\nall got out of the car, unloosed the natives, and began to look about us.\n\nThe scene was more disheartening than ever. All about towered the crystal\nmountains, their bases leaden-hued and formless in the ghostly gloom,\nwhile their middle parts showed deep gleams of ultramarine, brightening\nto purple higher up, and a few aspiring peaks behind us sparkled\nbrilliantly where the sunlight touched them. It was such a spectacle as\nthe imagination could not have conceived, and I have often tried in vain\nto reproduce it satisfactorily in my own mind.\n\nWas there ever such a situation as ours? Cast away in a place wild and\nwonderful beyond description, millions of miles from all human aid and\nsympathy, millions of miles from the world that had given us birth! I\ncould, in bitterness of spirit, have laughed at the suggestion that there\nwas any hope for us. And yet, at that very moment, not only was there\nhope, but there was even the certainty of deliverance. But, unknown to\nus, it lay in the brain of the incomparable man who had brought us\nhither.\n\nI have told you that it was twilight in the valley where we lay. But\nwhen, as frequently happened, tempests of snow burst over the mountains,\nand choked the air about us, the twilight turned to deepest night, and we\nhad to illumine the lamps in the car. By great good fortune, Edmund said,\nenough power remained to furnish us with light and heat, and now I looked\nupon those mysterious black-tusked muzzles in the car with a new\nsentiment, praying that they would not turn to mouths of death.\n\nThe natives, being used to darkness, needed no artificial illumination.\nIn fact, we had observed that whenever the sunlight had streamed over\nthem their great eyes were almost blinded, and they suffered cruelly from\nan affliction so completely outside of all their experience. Edmund now\nbegan to speak to us of this, saying that he ought to have foreseen and\nprovided against it.\n\n\"I shall try to find some means of affording protection to their eyes\nwhen we arrive in the sunlit hemisphere,\" he said. \"It must be my first\nduty.\"\n\nWe heard these words with a thrill of hope.\n\n\"Then you think that we shall escape?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course we shall escape,\" he replied cheerfully. \"I give you my word\nfor it, but do not ask me for any particulars yet. The exact means I have\nnot yet found, but find them I will. We may have to stay where we are for\na considerable time, and our companions must be made comfortable. Even\nunder their furry skins they'll suffer from this kind of weather.\"\n\nFollowing his directions we took a lot of extra furs from the car, and\nconstructed a kind of tent, under which the natives could huddle on the\nsleds. There being but little wind in the valley, this was not so\ndifficult an undertaking as it may seem. And the poor fellows were very\nglad of the shelter, for some of them were shivering, since, not knowing\nwhat to do, they were less active than ourselves. No sooner were they\nhoused than they fell to eating ravenously. Both the car and the sleds\nhad been abundantly provisioned, so that there was no immediate fear of a\nfamine among us.\n\nInside the car we soon had things organized very much as they were during\nour voyage from the earth. We read, talked, and smoked to our hearts'\ncontent, almost forgetting the icy mountains that tottered over us, and\nthe howling tempest which, with hardly an intermission, tore through the\ncloud-choked air a thousand or two thousand feet above our heads. We\ntalked of our adventure with the meteors, which seemed an event of long\nago, and then we talked of home--home twenty-six million miles away! In\nfact, it may have been thirty millions by this time, for Edmund had told\nus that Venus, having passed conjunction while we were at the caverns,\nwas now receding from the earth.\n\nBut while we thus strove to kill the time and banish thoughts of our\nactual situation, Edmund sat apart much of the time absorbed in thought,\nand we respected his privacy, knowing that our only chance of escape lay\nin him. One day (I speak always of \"days,\" because we religiously counted\nthe passage of time by our clock) he issued alone from the car and was\nabsent a long time, so that we began to be concerned, and, going outside\nlooked everywhere for signs of him. At length, to our infinite relief, he\nappeared stumbling and crawling along the foot of an icy mountain. As he\ndrew nearer we saw that he was smiling, and as soon as he was within easy\nearshot he called out:\n\n\"It's all right. I've found the solution.\"\n\nThen upon joining us he continued:\n\n\"We'll get out all right, but we shall have to be patient for a while\nlonger.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" we asked eagerly. \"What have you found out?\"\n\n\"Peter,\" he said, turning to me, \"you know what libration means; well,\nit's libration that is going to save us. As Venus travels round the sun\nshe turns just once on her axis in making a complete circuit, the\nconsequence being, as you already know, that she has one side on which\nthe sun never rises while the other half is in perpetual daylight. But,\nsince her orbit is not a perfect circle, she travels a little faster than\nthe average during about half of her year and a little slower during the\nother half, but, at the same time, her steady rotation on her axis never\nvaries. This produces the phenomenon that is called libration, the result\nof which is that, along the border between the day and night hemispheres\nthere is a narrow strip where the sun rises and sets once in each of her\nyears, which are about two hundred and twenty-five of our days in length.\nWithin this strip the sun shines continuously for about sixteen weeks,\ngradually rising during eight weeks and sinking during the following\neight. Then, during the next sixteen weeks, the strip lies in unceasing\nnight.\n\n\"Now the kind fates have willed that we should fall just within this\nlucky strip. By the utmost good fortune after we passed the blazing peak\nwhich so nearly wrecked us, we were carried on by the wind so far, before\nthe ascensional power of the car gave out, that we descended on the\nsunward side of the crest of the range. The sun is now just beginning to\nrise on the part of the strip where we are, and it will get higher for\nseveral weeks to come. The result will be that a great melting of ice and\nsnow will occur here, and in this deep valley a river will form, flowing\noff toward the sunward hemisphere, exactly where we want to go. I shall\ntake advantage of the torrent that will flow here and float down with it\nuntil we are out of the labyrinth. It's our only chance, for we couldn't\npossibly clamber over the hummocky ice and drag the car with us.\"\n\n\"Why not leave the car here?\" asked Henry.\n\nEdmund looked at him and smiled.\n\n\"Do you want to stay on Venus all your life?\" he asked. \"I thought you\ndidn't like it well enough for that. How could we ever get back to the\nearth without the car? I can repair the mechanism as soon as I can find\ncertain substances, which I am sure exist on this planet as well as on\nthe earth. But it is no use looking for them in this icy wilderness. No,\nwe can never abandon the car. We must take it with us, and the only\npossible way to transport it is with the aid of the coming river.\"\n\n\"But how will you manage to float?\" I asked.\n\n\"The car, being air-tight, will float like a buoy.\"\n\n\"But the natives, will you abandon them?\"\n\n\"God forbid. I'll contrive a way for them.\"\n\nThe effects of libration on Venus were not new to me, but they were to\nJack and Henry, who had never studied such things, and they expressed\nmuch doubt about Edmund's plan, but I had confidence in it from the\nbeginning, and it turned out just as he had predicted, as things always\ndid. Every twenty-four hours we saw, with thankful hearts, that the sun\nhad perceptibly risen, and as it rose, the sky gradually cleared, while\nthe sunbeams, falling uninterruptedly, grew hotter and hotter. Soon we no\nlonger had any use for furs, or for artificial heat. At the same time the\nmelting of the ice began. It formed, in fact, a new danger, by bringing\ndown avalanches into the valley, yet we watched the process joyously,\nsince it fell so entirely within Edmund's program. While we were awaiting\nthe flood, Edmund had prepared screens to protect the eyes of the\nnatives.\n\nWe were just at the bottom of the trough of the valley, near its head. It\nwound away before us, turning out of sight beyond an icy bulwark. Streams\nwere soon pouring down from the heights all around, and uniting, they\nformed a little torrent, which flowed swiftly over the smooth, hard ice.\nEdmund now completed his plan.\n\n\"I'll take Juba in the car with us,\" he said. \"There's just room for him.\nAs for the others, we'll fasten the sleds on each side of the car, which\nwill be buoyant enough to float them, and they'll have to take their\nchances outside.\"\n\nWe made the final arrangements while the little torrent was swelling to a\nriver. Before it became too broad and deep we managed to place the car\nacross the center of its course, the sleds forming outriders. Then all\ntook their places and waited. Higher and higher rose the waters, while\navalanches, continually increasing in size and number, thundered down the\nheights, and vast cataracts leaped and poured from the precipices. It was\na mercy that we were so situated that the avalanches could not reach the\ncar. But we received some pretty hard knocks before the stream became\ndeep and steady enough to float us off. Shall I ever forget that moment?\n\nThere came a sudden wave, forced onward by a great slide of ice, which\nlifted car and sleds on its crest, and away we went! The car proved more\nbuoyant than I had believed possible. The sleds, fastened on each side,\ntended to give it extra stability, and it did not sink deeper than the\nmiddle of the windows. The latter, though formed of very thick glass,\nmight have been broken by the tossing ice if they had not been divided\ninto small panes separated by bars of steel, which projected a few inches\noutside.\n\n\"I made that arrangement for meteors,\" said Edmund, \"but I never thought\nthat they would have to be defended against ice.\"\n\nThe increasing force of the current sent us spinning down the valley with\naccelerated speed. We swept round the nearest ice peak on the left, and\nas we passed under its projecting buttresses a fearful roar above\ninformed us that an avalanche of unexampled magnitude had been unchained.\nWe could not withdraw our eyes from the window on that side of the car,\nand almost instantly immense masses of ice appeared crashing into the\nwater, throwing it over us in floods and half drowning the unfortunate\nwretches on the sleds. Still, they clung on, fastened together, and we\ncould do nothing to aid them. The uproar grew worse, and the ice came\nplunging down faster and faster, accompanied with a deluge of water from\nthe heights above. The car pitched and rolled until we were all flung off\nour feet. Poor Juba was a picture of abject terror. He hung moaning to a\nbench, his huge eyes aglow with fright.\n\nSuddenly the car seemed to be lifted clear from the water, and then it\nfell back again and was submerged, so that we were buried in night.\nSlowly we rose to the surface, and Edmund, springing to a window,\nshouted:\n\n\"They're gone! Heaven have pity on them--and on me!\"\n\nIn spite of their fastenings the water had swept every living soul from\nthe sled on the left. We rushed to the other window. It was the same\nstory there--the sled on that side was also empty. I saw a furry body\ntossed in the torrent alongside, but in a second it disappeared beneath\nthe raging water. At the same time Edmund exclaimed:\n\n\"God forgive us for bringing those poor creatures here only to meet their\ndeath!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nTHE CHILDREN OF THE SUN\n\nBut the situation was too critical to permit us to think of the\nunfortunates whose death we had undoubtedly caused. There seemed less\nthan an even chance of our getting through with our own lives. As we\ntossed and whirled onward the water rose yet higher, and blocks of ice\nassailed us on all sides. First the sled on the left was torn loose; then\nthe other followed it, leaving the car to fight its battle alone. But the\nloss of the sleds was a good thing now that their occupants were gone,\nfor it eased off the weight and the car rose much higher in the water.\nMoreover, it gave way more readily when pressed by the ice. To be sure,\nit rolled more than before, but still, being well ballasted, it did not\nturn turtle, and most of the time we were able to keep on our feet by\nholding fast to the inside window bars.\n\nOnce we took a terrible plunge, over a vertical fall of not less than\ntwenty or thirty feet. But the water below the fall was very deep, a\nprofound hole having been quickly scooped out in the unfathomable ice\nbeneath, so that we did not strike bottom, as I had feared, but came\nbobbing to the top again like a cork. Below this fall there was a very\nlong series of rapids, extending, it seemed, for miles upon miles, and we\nshot down them with the speed of an express train, lurching from side to\nside, and colliding with hundreds of ice floes. It must not be supposed\nthat we went through this experience without suffering any injuries. On\nthe contrary, our hands were all bleeding, our faces cut, Henry had one\neye closed by a blow, and our clothing, for we were not wearing our\nArctic outfit, was badly used up. Yet none of our injuries was really\nserious, although we looked as if we had just come out of the toughest\nkind of a street brawl.\n\nBut there is no use in prolonging the story of this awful ride. It seemed\nto us to last for days upon days, though, in fact, the worst of it was\nover within twelve hours after we were lifted from our moorings in the\nvalley. The tumbling stream gradually broadened out as it left the region\nof the high mountains, and then we found ourselves in a district covered\nwith icy hills of no great elevation. But we could still see, by glances,\nas the stream curved this way and that, the glittering peaks behind. It\nwas an appalling thing to watch many of the nearer hills as they suddenly\nsank, collapsed, and disappeared, like pinnacles of loaf sugar melting\nand falling to pieces in a basin of water.\n\nEdmund said that all of the ice-hills and mounds through which we were\npassing no doubt owed their existence to pressure from behind, in the\nbelt where the sun never rose, and where the ice was piled up in actual\nmountains. These foothills were, in fact, enormous glaciers thrust out\ntoward the sunward hemisphere.\n\nAfter a long time the now broad river widened yet more until it became a\ngreat lake, or bay. The surface of the planet around appeared nearly\nlevel, and, as far as we could see, was mostly covered by the water. Here\nvast fields of ice floated, and the water was not muddy, as it would have\nbeen if it had passed over soil, but of crystal purity and wonderfully\nblue in places where shafts of sunlight penetrated to great depths--for\nnow the sun was high above the horizon ahead, and shining in an almost\nclear sky. Presently we began to notice the wind again. It came fitfully,\nfirst from one quarter and then another, rapidly increasing until, at\ntimes, it rose into a tempest. It lifted the water in huge combing waves,\nbut the car rode them like a lifeboat.\n\n\"There is peril for us in this,\" said Edmund, at last. \"We are being\ncarried by the current into a region where the contending winds may play\nhavoc. It is the place where the hot air from the sunward side begins to\nbe chilled and to descend, meeting the colder air from the night side. It\nmust form a veritable belt of storms, which may be as difficult to pass,\ncircumstanced as we are, as the crystal mountains themselves.\"\n\n\"Suppose it should turn out that there is nothing but an ocean on this\nside of the planet,\" I suggested.\n\n\"That I believe to be impossible,\" Edmund responded. \"This hemisphere\nmust be, as a whole, broken up into highlands and depressions. The\ngeological formation of the other side, as far as I could make it out\nfrom the appearance of the rocks in the caverns, indicates that Venus has\nundergone the same experience of upheavals and fracturings of the crust\nthat the earth has been through. If that is true of one side it must be\ntrue of the other also, for during a large part of these geological\nchanges she undoubtedly rotated rapidly on her axis like the earth.\"\n\n\"But we traveled five thousand miles on the other side without\nencountering anything but a frozen prairie,\" I objected.\n\n\"True enough, and yet I would lay a wager that all of that side of the\nplanet is not equally level. Remember the vast plains of Russia and\nSiberia.\"\n\n\"Well,\" put in Jack, whose spirits were beginning to revive, \"if there's\na shore somewheres, let's find it. I want to see the other kind of\ninhabitants. These that we've met don't accord with my ideas of Venus.\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" responded Edmund, \"and I think I can promise you\nthat they will not disappoint your expectations.\"\n\nYet there seemed to be nothing in our present situation to warrant the\nconfidence expressed by our leader's words and manner. The current that\nhad carried us out of the crystal mountains gradually disappeared in a\nvast waste of waters, and we were driven hither and thither by the\ntempestuous wind. Its force increased hour by hour, and at last the sky,\nwhich at brief intervals had been clear and exquisitely blue, became\nchoked with black clouds, sweeping down upon the face of the waters, and\noften whirled into great _trombes_ by the tornadic blasts. Several times\nthe car was deluged by waterspouts, and once it was actually lifted up\ninto the air by the mighty suction. An ordinary vessel would not have\nlived five minutes in that hell of winds and waters. But the car, if it\nhad been built for this kind of navigation, could not have behaved\nbetter.\n\nI do not know how long all this lasted. It grew worse and worse.\nSometimes a flood of rain fell, and then would come a storm of lightning,\nand a downpour of gigantic hailstones that rattled upon the steel shell\nof the car like a rain of bullets from a battery of machine guns. Half\nthe time one window or the other was submerged by the waves, and when we\ngot an opportunity to glance out, we saw nothing but torn streamers of\ncloud whipping the face of the waters. But when the change came at last,\nit was as sudden as the dropping of a curtain. The clouds broke away, a\nsoft light filled the atmosphere, the waves ceased to break and rolled in\nlong undulations, and a marvelous dome appeared overhead.\n\nThat dome, at its first dramatic appearance, was one of the most\nastonishing things that we saw in the whole course of our adventures. It\nwas not a cerulean vault like that which covers the earth in halcyon\nweather, but an indescribably soft, pinkish-gray concavity that seemed\nnearer than the sky and yet farther than the clouds. Here and there, far\nbeneath it, but still at a vast elevation, floated delicate gauzy\ncurtains, tinted like sheets of mother-of-pearl. The sun was no longer\nvisible, but the air was filled with a delicious luminousness, which\nbathed the eyes as if it had been an ethereal liquid.\n\nBelow each window was a steel ledge, broad enough to stand on, with\nconvenient hold-fasts for the hands. These had evidently been prepared\nfor some such contingency, and Edmund, throwing open the windows, invited\nus to go outside. We gladly accepted the invitation, and all, except\nJuba, issued into the open air. The temperature was that of an early\nspring day, and the air was splendidly fresh and stimulating. The rolling\nof the car had now nearly ceased, and we had no difficulty in maintaining\nour positions. For a long while we admired, and talked of, the great dome\noverhead, which drew our attention, for the time, from the sea that had\nso strangely brought us hither.\n\n\"There,\" said Edmund, pointing to the dome, \"is the inside of the shell\nof cloud whose exterior, gleaming in the sunshine, baffles our\nastronomers in their efforts to see the surface of Venus. I believe that\nwe shall find the whole of this hemisphere covered by it. It is a shield\nfor the inhabitants against the fervors of an unsetting sun. Its presence\nprevents their real world from being seen from outside.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jack, laughing, \"I never heard before that Venus was fond of\na veil.\"\n\n\"Not only can they not be seen,\" continued Edmund, \"but they cannot\nthemselves see beyond the screen that covers them.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse!\" exclaimed Jack. \"The astronomers have certainly made a\nmistake in naming this bashful planet Venus.\"\n\nWe continued for a long time to gaze at the great dome, admiring the\nmagnificent play of iridescent colors over its vast surface, until\nsuddenly Jack, who had gone to the other side of the car, called out to\nus:\n\n\"Come here and tell me what this is.\"\n\nWe hurried to his side and were astonished to see a number of glittering\nobjects which appeared to be floating in the atmosphere. They were\narranged in an almost straight row, at an elevation of perhaps two\nthousand feet, and were apparently about three miles away. After a few\nmoments of silence, Edmund said, in his quiet way:\n\n\"Those are air ships.\"\n\n\"Air ships!\"\n\n\"Yes, surely. An exploring expedition, I shouldn't wonder. I anticipated\nsomething of that kind. You know already how dense the atmosphere of\nVenus is. It follows that balloons, and all sorts of machines for aerial\nnavigation, can float much more easily here than over the earth. I was\nprepared to find the inhabitants of Venus skilled in such things, and I'm\nnot surprised by what we see.\"\n\n\"Venus with wings!\" cried Jack. \"Now, Edmund, that sounds more like it. I\nguess we've struck the right planet after all.\"\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"you spoke of an exploring expedition. How in the world do\nyou make that out?\"\n\n\"It seems perfectly natural to me,\" replied Edmund. \"Remember the two\nsides of the planet, so wonderfully different from one another. If we on\nthe earth are so curious about the poles of our planet, simply because\nthey are unlike other parts of the world, don't you think that the\ninhabitants of Venus should be at least equally curious concerning a\nwhole hemisphere of their world, which differs _in toto_ from the half on\nwhich they live?\"\n\n\"That does seem reasonable,\" I assented.\n\n\"Of course it's reasonable, and I imagine that we, ourselves, are about\nto be submitted to investigation.\"\n\n\"By Jo!\" exclaimed Jack, running his hands through his hair, and\nsmoothing his torn and rumpled garments, \"then we must make ready for\ninspection. But I'm afraid we won't do much honor to old New York. Can I\nget a shave aboard your craft, Edmund?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Edmund replied, laughing. \"I didn't forget soap and razors.\"\n\nBut Jack would have had no time to make his toilet even if he had\nseriously thought of it. The strange objects in the air approached with\ngreat rapidity, and we soon saw that Edmund had correctly divined their\nnature. They were certainly air ships, and I was greatly interested in\nthe observation that they seemed to be constructed somewhat upon the\nprinciples upon which our inventors were then working on the earth. But\nthey were neither aeroplanes nor balloons. They bore a resemblance to\nmechanical birds, and seemed to be sustained and forced ahead by a\nwing-like action.\n\nThis, of course, did not escape Edmund's notice.\n\n\"Look,\" he said admiringly, \"how easily and gracefully they fly. Perhaps\nwith our relatively light atmosphere we shall never be able to do that\non the earth; but no matter,\" he added, with a flush, \"for with the\ninter-atomic energy at our command, we shall have no need to imitate the\nbirds.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they have made that discovery here, too,\" I suggested.\n\n\"No, it is evident that they have not, else they would not be employing\nmechanical means of flight. Once let me get the car fixed up and we'll\ngive them a surprise.\"\n\n\"Yes, and if you had used common sense,\" growled Henry, nursing his\ninjured eye, \"you would not be here fooling away your time and ours, and\nrisking our lives every minute, but you'd be making millions and\nrevolutionizing life at home.\"\n\n\"And where'd the Columbus of Space be then?\" demanded Jack. \"Hanged if\nEdmund is not right! I'd rather be here meeting these doves of Venus than\ngrinding out dollars on the earth. And can't we go back and scoop in the\nmoney when we get ready?\"\n\nThe discussion went no further, for, by this time, two of the air ships\nwere close at hand. And now we perceived, for the first time, the beings\nthat they carried. Our surprise at the sight was even greater than that\nwhich we had experienced upon meeting the inhabitants of the dark\nhemisphere. The latter were extraordinary--but we were looking for\nextraordinary things. Indeed they were, except for certain peculiarities,\nmuch more like some members of our own race than we should have deemed\npossible. How great, then, was our astonishment upon seeing the two air\nships apparently in charge of _real human beings_!\n\nAt least that was our first impression. In the midst of the strange\napparatus, which evidently fulfilled the function of wings for the air\nships, we saw decks, spacious enough to contain twenty persons, and\nsurmounted with deck houses, and along the railings inclosing the decks\nwere gathered the crews, among whom we believed that we could recognize\ntheir officers. The two vessels had approached within a hundred yards\nbefore being suddenly arrested. Then they settled gracefully down upon\nthe water, where they floated like swans.\n\nAt first, as I have said, the resemblance of their crews to inhabitants\nof the earth seemed complete. One would have said that we had met a\nyachting party, composed of tall, well-formed, light-complexioned,\nyellow-haired Englishmen, the pick of their race. At a distance their\ndress alone appeared strange, though it, too, might easily be imitated on\nthe earth. As well as I can describe it, it bore some resemblance, in\ngeneral effect, to the draperies of a Greek statue, and it was specially\nremarkable for the harmonious blending of soft hues in its texture.\n\nDuring a space of at least five minutes we gazed at them, and they at us.\nProbably their surprise was greater than ours, because we had been on the\nlookout for strange sights, being, of our own volition, in a foreign\nworld, while they could have had no expectation of such an encounter,\neven if, as Edmund had conjectured, they were engaged in exploration. We\ncould read their astonishment in their gesticulations. Slowly the car and\nthe nearer of the two air ships drifted closer together. When we were\nwithin less than fifty yards of one another, Jack suddenly called out:\n\n\"A woman! By Jo, it's Venus herself!\"\n\nHis excited voice rang like a rattle of musketry in the heavy air, and\nthe beings on the air ship started back in alarm. But although, like the\ninhabitants of the dark hemisphere, they were, evidently, unaccustomed\nto hearing sounds of such forcefulness issue from a living creature no\nlarger than themselves, they were not faint-hearted, and the air ship did\nnot, as we half expected it would, take flight. The momentary commotion\nwas quickly quieted, and our visitors continued their inspection. All of\nus immediately recognized the personage whom Jack had singled out as the\nsubject of his startling exclamation. It was clear that he had rightly\nguessed her sex, and she appeared worthy of his admiring designation.\nEven at the distance of a hundred feet we could see that she was very\nbeautiful. Her complexion was light, with a flame upon the cheeks; her\nhair a chestnut blond; and her large, round eyes were sapphire blue, and\nseemed to radiate a light of their own. This last statement (about the\neyes) must not be taken for a conventional exaggeration, such as writers\nof fiction employ in describing heroines who never existed. On the\ncontrary, it expresses a literal fact; and moreover, as the reader will\nsee further on, this peculiarity of the eyes was shared, in varying\ndegrees, by all these people of Venus, and was connected with the most\namazing of all our discoveries on that planet. I should say here that,\nwhile the eyes of the inhabitants of the day side were larger than ours,\nthey did not, in respect of size, resemble the extraordinary organs of\nvision possessed by the compatriots of Juba.\n\nIn a few minutes we became aware that the beautiful creature we had been\nadmiring was not the only representative of the female sex on the air\nship. Several others surrounded her, and the fact quickly became manifest\nthat they recognized her as a superior. Still more surprising was the\ndiscovery, which we were not long in making, that she was actually the\ncommander of the craft. We could see that the orders which determined its\nmovements emanated from her.\n\n\"Amazons!\" exclaimed Jack, taking pains this time to moderate his voice.\n\"And what a queen they've got!\"\n\nDuring all this time the car and the air ship were slowly drifting nearer\nto one another, drawn by that strange attraction which seems to affect\ninanimate things when in close neighborhood, and when they were not more\nthan fifteen yards apart the personage we had been watching slowly lifted\nher arm, revealing a glittering bracelet, and, with an ineffably winning\nsmile, made a gesture which said plainer than any words could have done:\n\n\"Welcome, strangers.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nLANGUAGE WITHOUT SPEECH\n\n\"That breaks the ice,\" said the irrepressible Jack. \"We're introduced! Now\nfor the conquest of Venus.\"\n\nWe had all instinctively returned the smile of our beautiful\ninterlocutor, with bows and gestures of amity, and it looked as though we\nmight soon be within touch of her hand, for the vessels continued to\ndrift nearer, when suddenly Juba clambered out of the window and stood\nbeside us, his moon eyes blinking in the unaccustomed light. The greatest\nagitation was immediately manifest among the crowd on the deck of the air\nship. They seemed to be even more startled than they had been by the\nsound of Jack's voice. They interchanged looks, and, apparently, a few\nwords, spoken in very low voices, and glanced from Juba to us in a way\nwhich plainly showed that they were astonished at our being together.\n\nEdmund, whose perspicacity never deserted him, immediately penetrated\ntheir thoughts.\n\n\"It is clear,\" he said, \"that these people recognize Juba as an\ninhabitant of the dark hemisphere, while, as to us, they are puzzled, and\nall the more so now that Juba has made his appearance. I think it certain\nthat they have never actually met any representative of Juba's race\nbefore, but no doubt he bears, to their eyes, ethnological\ncharacteristics which escape our discernment, and it is likely that\ntradition has handed down to them facts about the inhabitants of the\nother side of their planet which accord with his appearance.\"\n\n\"Then, they must conclude that we have come from the other side, and\nbrought Juba along as a captive,\" I said.\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"And what must they think of us--that we are inhabitants of the dark\nhemisphere also?\"\n\n\"What else can they think?\"\n\nI do not know into what train of speculation this might have led us if a\nnew incident had not suddenly changed the current of our thoughts.\nUnnoticed by us the second air ship had drawn near. Signals were\ninterchanged between it and the first, and we observed that she who\nseemed to be the commander in chief gave orders that the second air ship\nshould lay us aboard. The order was no sooner given than executed, and we\nfound ourselves face to face with a dozen of the blond-haired natives,\nled by one who was clearly their captain. The deck of the air ship\ntouched the side of the car, and, as if instinctively recognizing our\nleader, the captain laid his hand on Edmund's arm, but with a smile which\ngave assurance that no violence was intended.\n\n\"Come,\" said Edmund, in a low voice, \"it is best that we should go aboard\ntheir craft. We are in their hands, and luckily so, for they will take us\nwhere we want to go.\"\n\nAccordingly, all, including Juba, passed upon the deck of the air ship.\nYou will readily imagine the intensity of interest with which we studied\nthe faces and forms of those whom I will call our captors. Now that we\nwere in contact with them we could better observe their resemblances to,\nand differences from, ourselves. In all the main features of body they\nwere human beings, but of a somewhat superior stature. Noses and mouths\nwere small and delicate; hair long, silken, and either light gold or rich\nchestnut in color; skin white and smooth; ears small and peculiarly\nformed, with a curious mobility; and eyes large, round, invariably light\nblue, and possessing that strange luminousness of which I have already\nspoken. One could not look directly into these eyes without a certain\nshrinking, for some wonderful power seemed to radiate from them, and one\nhad the feeling that the intelligence behind them could dip to the bottom\nof his mind. We were gently treated and could perceive no indication of\nperil to ourselves. Nevertheless, we were glad to feel our pistols in our\npockets. There were seats on the deck to which we were civilly conducted,\nbut Edmund refused to sit.\n\n\"I must see the commander herself,\" he whispered. \"These are only\nsubordinates, and I cannot deal with them. It will not do to leave the\ncar here at the mercy of the waves. I must find the means of making them\nunderstand that it is to go with us.\"\n\nAccordingly, he approached the captain, and we watched him with beating\nhearts, not being able to divine what an attempt to dictate terms on our\npart might lead to. Jack shook his head, and put his hand on his pistol,\nwhich Edmund had restored to him while we were in the ice mountains.\n\n\"I'll drop the jackanapes in his tracks if he shows up ugly,\" he said.\n\n\"You'd better keep quiet,\" I whispered, \"and don't let them see your\nweapon. They appear to have no arms, and you should trust to Edmund to\nmanage the affair. When he gives the word it will be time enough to begin\nshooting.\"\n\nJack grumbled, but kept the pistol in his pocket, although he did not\nwithdraw his hand from it.\n\nI have already told you how, at the caverns, Edmund had discovered that\nthe inhabitants there possessed a means of converse which he likened to\ntelepathy, and from what I had seen of the people here I was convinced\nthat they had the same mysterious power, and probably in a higher degree.\nTo be sure, they used words occasionally, but for the most part they\ncommuned together in some other way. I felt sure that Edmund was now\nabout to apply what he had learned, and his actions quickly demonstrated\nthat my conjecture was well founded. Just what he did, I do not know, but\nthe result of his conference was promptly apparent.\n\nThe first air ship had withdrawn a short distance when the other boarded\nthe car, but now the two mutually approached until it was possible to\nstep from one deck to the other. As soon as they touched, Edmund was\nconducted by the captain, at whose side he had remained standing, to the\npresence of the important personage whom Jack had begun to designate as\nthe queen. We remained where we were, watching with all eyes, while Jack\npersisted in keeping his hand on the pistol in his pocket. A crowd\nimmediately surrounded Edmund and we were unable to see exactly what went\non, a fact that rendered Jack so much the more impatient. But it turned\nout that there was no cause for alarm. In about ten minutes the crowd\nopened and Edmund appeared. Uninterfered with, he came to the edge of the\ndeck, close by us, and said:\n\n\"It is all arranged. The car will be towed by one of the air ships. I am\nto stay here and you will remain where you are until we reach our\ndestination.\"\n\n\"Have you had a talk with her?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Not in any language that you understand,\" Edmund responded, smiling.\n\"But I have made good use of what I learned in the caverns. These people\nare intellectually vastly superior to the others, and, as I guessed, they\npossess a more perfect command of the sort of telepathy that I told you\nabout. I have not found much difficulty in making my wish understood, and\nyour amazon is a very obliging person. It is only necessary to be\ndiscreet and we shall have no trouble.\"\n\n\"But why are you to be separated from us?\" asked Jack anxiously. \"That\nlooks bad, for it is exactly what they would do if they meant to kill us\none at a time.\"\n\n\"Why should they kill us?\" retorted Edmund.\n\n\"And why should we be separated?\" persisted Jack. \"I tell you, Edmund, I\ndon't like it.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" Edmund said, after a moment's thought; \"if that's the\nway you feel about it, I'll see what I can do. It will be another\nexercise for me in this new kind of language. But, mark this, if I\nsucceed in persuading the chieftainess to keep us together, you will have\nto acknowledge that your fears were groundless. Perhaps it's worth trying\non that very account.\"\n\nHe disappeared from our eyes again--for as soon as he approached their\nleader the people of the air ship crowded close around as if to afford\nher protection--and, after another ten minutes' conference, came back\nsmiling to the edge of the deck.\n\n\"Dismiss your fears, friend Jack,\" he said cheerfully. \"You are all to\ncome aboard here with me. So you see there could have been no thought of\ntreachery; but I'm glad that we are not to be separated, and I thank you\nfor your solicitude on my account.  I'm sure that the original\narrangement was made only because of lack of room aboard this craft, and\nyou'll see that that was the reason.\"\n\nHe was right, for immediately half a dozen of the crew of the principal\nair ship were sent aboard ours while we were transferred to take their\nplace.\n\nWe now had an opportunity to study the countenance of the \"amazon\"\ncommander, and we found her to be an even more remarkable personage than\nshe had appeared at a distance. Of the beauty of her features and form I\nshall say no more, but about her eyes I could write a chapter. The\npupils, widely expanded amidst their circles of sky-blue iris, seemed to\nspeak. I can describe the impression that they made in no other way. I no\nlonger wondered at Edmund's ability to converse with her, for I felt\nthat, with a little instruction, and more of our leader's mental\npenetration, I could do it myself. At times I shrank from encountering\nher gaze, for I verily believed that she read my inmost thoughts. And I\ncould see that _thought came out of her eyes_, but it escaped all my\nefforts to grasp it; it was too evanescent, or I was too dull. Sometimes\nI imagined that the meaning was at the threshold of comprehension, but\nyet it evaded me, like forgotten words whose general sense dimly\nirradiates the mind, while they refuse to take a definite shape, and keep\nflitting just beyond the reach of memory. Still, charity and good will\nshone out so plainly that anybody could read them, and I do not know how\nto express the feeling that came over me at this evidence of friendliness\nexhibited by an inhabitant of a world so far from our own. It was as if a\ndim sense of ultimate fraternity bound her to us. Jack's enthusiasm, as\nyou may guess, was without bounds, and strangely enough it rendered him\nalmost speechless.\n\n\"By Jo!\" he kept repeating to himself in an undertone, without venturing\nupon any further expression of his feelings.\n\nHenry, as usual, was silent, but I know that he felt the influence no\nless than the rest of us. Edmund, too, said nothing, but it was plain\nthat he was continually studying the phenomenon, and I felt sure that his\nanalytic mind would find a more complete explanation than we yet\npossessed. Of course you are not to suppose that the power that I have\nbeen trying to describe was peculiar to this woman. On the contrary, as I\nhave already intimated, it was common to all of them; but with her it\nseemed to have reached a higher development, and, what was of special\ninterest, she alone exhibited a marked benevolence toward us.\n\nThe car was attached by a cable to the air ship that we had just quitted,\nand our voyage into a new unknown began. The other air ships, which had\nbeen hovering about, moved up into line, and, with the exception of the\none which towed the car, all rose to an elevation of perhaps a thousand\nfeet, and moved rapidly away from a row of dark clouds which we could now\nsee low on the horizon behind. We found the air ship splendidly fitted\nup, with everything that could contribute to the comfort of its inmates.\nAnd what a voyage it was! \"Yachting on Venus,\" as Jack called it. We sat\non the deck, with a pleasant breeze, produced by the swift, steady\nmotion, fanning our faces; the temperature was delightful; the air was\nwonderfully stimulating; the light, softly and evenly diffused from the\ngreat shell-like dome of the sky, seemed to bewitch the eyesight; and the\nsea beneath us, reflecting the dome, was a marvel of refluent colors.\n\nWe had left the calendar clock in the car, but, with our watches, which\nwe had never ceased to wind up regularly, we were able to measure the\ntime. The voyage lasted about seventy-two hours, but could, perhaps, have\nbeen performed in less time if we had not been somewhat delayed by the\ntowing of the car. They had on the air ship ingenious clocks, driven by\nweights, and governed by pendulums, but the divisions of time were unlike\nours, and there was nothing corresponding to our days. This, of course,\narose from the fact that there was never any night, and, being unable to\nsee either sun or stars, they had no measure of the year. With them time\nwas simply endless duration, with no return in cycles.\n\n\"What interests me most,\" said Edmund, \"is the fact that they should have\nestablished any chronological measure at all. It would puzzle some of our\nmetaphysicians on the earth to account for the origin of their sense of\ntime. To me it seems evident that the consciousness of duration is\nfundamental in all intelligent life, and does not necessarily demand\nnatural recurrences, like the succession of day and night, and the\npassage of sun and stars across the meridian, to give it birth. Did you\never read St. Augustine's reply to the question, 'What is time'--'I know\nif you don't ask me'?\"\n\n\"If they haven't any years,\" said Jack, \"how do they know when they are\nold enough to die?\"\n\n\"They have the years, but no measure for them,\" replied Edmund, and then\nadded quizzically, \"Perhaps they _don't_ die.\"\n\n\"Well, I shouldn't wonder,\" Jack returned, \"for this seems to me to be\nParadise for sure.\"\n\nWhen we felt sleepy, we imitated the natives themselves, and, just as we\nhad done during the voyage from the earth, created an artificial night by\nshutting ourselves up in the cabins that had been assigned to us. Rest\nwas taken by all of them in this manner as regularly as it is taken at\nnight on the earth.\n\nOne subject which we frequently discussed during the voyage was the\nastonishing resemblance of our hosts to the _genus homo_. Influenced by\nspeculations which I had read at home about the probable unlikeness to\none another of the inhabitants of different planets, I was particularly\ninsistent upon this point, and declared that the facts as we found them\nwere utterly inexplicable.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Edmund averred. \"It is perfectly natural, and quite as I\nexpected. Venus resembles the earth in composition, in form, in physical\nconstitution, and in subordination to the sun, the great ruler of the\nentire system. Here are the same chemical elements, and the same laws of\nmatter. The human type is manifestly the highest possible that could be\ndeveloped with such materials to work upon. Why, then, should you be\nsurprised to find that it prevails here as well as upon our planet?\nIntelligent life could find no more suitable abode than in a human body.\nThe details are simply varied in accordance with the environment--a\nprinciple that works on the earth also.\"\n\nI was not altogether satisfied with the reasoning--but as to the facts,\nwe had to believe our eyes.\n\nPalatable food was served to us, and during the waking time Edmund was\nfrequently engaged in his mysterious conversation with the \"queen.\"\nWithin forty-eight hours after we had set out in the air ship, he came to\nus, wearing one of his enigmatic smiles, and said:\n\n\"I've got another aphroditic word for you to remember. It is the name of\nour hostess--Ala.\"\n\nWe were not so much surprised by this news as we should have been but for\nwhat had occurred at the caverns, where he had discovered the patronymic\nof Juba.\n\n\"Good!\" cried Jack, \"it's a fine name. I was going to call her Aphrodite,\nmyself, but this is better as well as shorter.\"\n\n\"But, Edmund,\" I said, \"how does it happen that these people, if they\nconverse by 'telepathy' as you say, and as I fully believe, nevertheless\noccasionally use sounds and words? I should think it would be all one\nthing or all the other.\"\n\n\"Think a moment,\" he replied. \"Is it so with us? Do we not use signs and\ngestures as well as words? And what do we mean by 'silent converse,' when\nmind speaks to mind and soul to soul without the intervention of spoken\nlanguage? We have the potentiality of telepathic intercommunication, but\nwe have not yet developed it into a kinetic form as these people have\ndone. Ah, when will men begin to appreciate _what mind means?_\"\n\nI made no reply, and after a moment's musing, he continued:\n\n\"I suspect that here, too, speech preceded the higher form of converse,\nand that the spoken language remains only as a survival, presenting\ncertain advantages for particular cases. But we shall learn more as time\ngoes on.\"\n\nThere was no disputing Edmund's conclusions. He was the greatest accepter\nand defender of facts as he found them that I have ever known.\n\nIt was written that before this voyage ended we should have another phase\nof language without speech presented for our wonderment. It came about\nnear the end of the trip. We were standing apart in a group, greatly\ninterested and excited by the discovery, which had just been made, of\nland ahead. Far in advance we could see a curving, yellow shore line,\nand, dim in the distance behind it, a range of mountains. Edmund had just\ncalled our attention to these, with the remark that now I must admit that\nhe had reasoned correctly about the existence of elevated regions on this\nside of Venus, when Jack, always the first to note a new phenomenon,\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Hurrah! Here they come! We're going to have a royal reception.\"\n\nHe pointed toward the land in a different direction from that in which we\nhad been gazing, and immediately we beheld an extraordinary assemblage of\nair ships, perhaps ten miles off, but rapidly making toward us. More were\ncoming up from behind, as if rising out of the land, and soon they\nresembled flocks of large birds all converging to a common center. In a\nlittle while they became almost innumerable, but their number soon ceased\nto be as great a cause of surprise to us as their peculiar appearance.\nViewed with our binoculars they showed an infinite variety of shapes and\nsizes. Chinese kites could not, for a moment, be compared in\ngrotesqueness with the forms which many of them presented. Some soared in\nvast circles at a great height, with the steady flight of eagles; others\nspread out to right and left, as if to flank us on either hand; and in\nthe center, directly ahead, about a hundred advanced in column deployed\nin a semicircle, each keeping its place with the precision of a soldier\nin line of battle.\n\nAs we continued to gaze, fascinated by the splendor and strangeness of\nthe spectacle, suddenly the air was filled with fluttering colors. I do\nnot mean flags and streamers, but _colors in the air itself_! Colors the\nmost exquisite that ever the eye looked upon! They changed, flickered,\nmelted, brightened, flowed over one another in iridescent waves, mingled,\nseparated, turned the whole atmosphere into a spectral kaleidoscope. And\nit was evident that, in some inexplicable way, the approaching squadrons\nwere the sources of this marvelous display. Presently from the craft that\ncarried us, answering colors flashed out, as if the air around us had\nsuddenly been changed to crystal with a thousand quivering rainbows shot\nthrough it, their beautiful arches shifting and interchanging so rapidly\nthat the eye could not follow them.\n\nThen I began to notice that all this incessant play of colors was based\nupon an unmistakable rhythm. I can think of no better way to describe it\nthan to say that it was as if a great organ should send forth from its\nkeys harmonic vibrations consisting not of concordant sounds but of even\nmore perfectly related undulations of color. The permutations and\ncombinations of this truly chromatic scale were marvelous and magical in\ntheir infinite variety. It thrilled us with awe and wonder. But none was\nso rapt as Edmund himself. He gazed as if his soul were in his eyes, and\nfinally he turned to us, with a strange look, and said, almost under his\nbreath:\n\n\"This, too, is language, and more than that--it is music!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"No, not impossible, since it _is_. They are not only exchanging\nintelligence in this way, but we are being greeted with a great anthem\nplayed in the heaven itself!\"\n\nThere was the force of enthusiastic conviction in Edmund's words, and we\ncould only look at him, and at one another, in silent astonishment.\n\n\"Oh, what a people! What a people!\" he muttered. \"And yet I am not\nsurprised. I dimly fore-read this in Ala's eyes.\"\n\nEven Jack's levity was subdued for the time, but after a while he said to\nme with a shrug, half in earnest, half in derision:\n\n\"Well, this Yankee-doodling in the air gets me! I'd prefer a little plain\nEnglish and the Old Folks at Home.\"\n\nAfter about ten minutes the display ceased as suddenly as it had begun,\nand the nearer of the approaching air craft began to circle around us.\nFinally one of them ran so close alongside that an officer of high rank,\nfor such he seemed to be, leaped aboard us, and was quickly at Ala's\nside. There was a rapid interchange of communications between them, and\nthen the newcomer was, I may say, presented. Ala led him to where we were\nstanding, and I could read in his eyes the astonishment that the sight of\nsuch strangers produced in him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nAN AMAZING METROPOLIS\n\nIf I should undertake to describe in detail all the events that now\nfollowed in rapid succession, this history would take a lifetime to\nwrite. I must choose only the more significant facts.\n\nThe newcomer, whose remarkable face had immediately impressed me, and not\naltogether favorably, proved to be a personage of very great importance,\nsecond only, as we could see, to Ala herself. And, what was particularly\nimportant for us, he showed none of her friendly disposition. I do not\nmean to suggest that he seemed inclined to any active hostility, but\nevidently we were, in his eyes, no better than savages, and consequently\nentitled to no special consideration, and especially to no favors. Jack,\nwho, with all his careless ways, had a penetrating mind for the\nperception of character, whispered to me, within five minutes after the\nfellow came aboard:\n\n\"If that galoot had his way, we'd make our entry in irons. Mark my words,\nthere's mischief in him. Hang him! I'm going to keep my pistol handy when\nhe's around.\"\n\nEdmund, who happened to overhear Jack's remark, interposed:\n\n\"See here, Master Jack, this is no time to be talking of pistols. I trust\nthat we are done with shooting.\"\n\nWe were not done with it; but that comes later.\n\nIt was not long before Edmund had discovered a name for the newcomer\nalso; he called him Ingra. It was singular, he said, that all the names\nseemed to be characterized by the prevalence of vowels sounds, but he\nthought it likely that this arose from the greater ease with which they\ncould be enunciated. They were like Spanish words, which are the easiest\nof all for foreigners, and probably also for natives, to pronounce.\n\nAfter we reached the coast we descended to the ground, at Edmund's\nrequest, I believe, because he wished to superintend the loading of the\ncar upon one of the largest air ships, and it was an unforgettable sight\nto watch him managing the work as coolly and effectively as if he had\nbeen in charge of a gang of workmen at home! And, while I looked, I found\nmyself again doubting if, after all, this was not a dream. The workers\nhurrying about, Edmund following them, pointing, objecting, urging and\ndirecting, with his derby hat, which had come through all our adventures\n(though somewhat damaged), stuck on the back of his head--and all this on\nthe planet Venus! No! I could not be awake. But yet I was.\n\nWhen we started again, we were escorted by a hundred air ships, forming a\ncomplete circle about us. Now I noticed, what had escaped attention\nduring the extraordinary atmospheric display, viz., that these craft were\npainted in colors that I should call gorgeous if they had not been so\nperfectly harmonious and pleasing. Every one looked like the careful\ncreation of an artist, and the variety of tints exhibited was incredible.\nOur own air ship, and its consorts, on the other hand, were very plain in\ntheir decorations. I called Edmund's attention to this and immediately he\nsaid:\n\n\"Remember what I told you--this has been an exploring expedition, and the\ncraft taking part in it have been fitted up for rough work. That reminds\nme that I have not yet made the inquiries that I intended on that\nsubject. I shall go to Ala now and see what I can learn.\"\n\nShe was standing on the deck near the other end, with Ingra beside her.\nAs Edmund approached them, Jack nudged me:\n\n\"Look at that fellow,\" he said. \"Wasn't I right?\"\n\nThere was no doubt about it; Ingra scowled and showed every sign of\ndispleasure at Edmund's presence. But Ala greeted him graciously, and,\napparently, Ingra did not dare to interfere. I could see that Jack was\ngrasping his pistol again, but I did not anticipate that there would be\nany occasion to use it. Nevertheless, I watched them closely for a time,\nhoping to discover Edmund's method of reading her meaning; as to her\ncomprehension of his I had no question about that. But I got no light on\nthe subject, and, as it soon became evident, even to Jack, that there was\nno danger this time, we fell to examining the land over which we were\npassing.\n\nWe flew at a height of about two thousand feet, so that the range of\nvision was very wide. The sea behind us curved into the land in three\ngreat scallops, separated by acuminate promontories, whose terminal\nbluffs of sand were as yellow as gold. Away ahead the line of mountains,\nthat we had noticed before, appeared as a dark sierra, and between it and\nthe sea the country seemed to be very little broken by hills. Large\nforests were visible, but from our elevation it was impossible to tell\nwhether the trees composing them bore any resemblance to terrestrial\nforms. The open land was about equally divided in area between bare\nyellowish soil (or what we took to be soil) and bright green expanses\nwhose color suggested vegetation. Scattered here and there we saw what\nappeared to be habitations, but we could not be sure of their nature;\nand, upon the whole, the land seemed to us to be very thinly populated.\n\nMany birds accompanied us in our flight, frequently alighting on the deck\nand other parts of the air ship. They were remarkably tame, allowing us\nto approach them closely, and we were delighted by their beautiful\nplumage and their singular forms. This reminds me to say that the motion\nof the craft was extremely curious--a kind of gentle rising and falling,\nwhich was very agreeable when once we were accustomed to it, and which\nresembled what one would suppose to be the movement of a bird in flight.\nThis, of course, arose from the structure of the air ship, which, as I\nhave before said, seemed to be modeled, as far as its motive parts were\nconcerned, upon the principle of wings rather than of simple aeroplanes.\nBut the mechanism was very complicated, and I never arrived at a full\ncomprehension of it.\n\nEdmund remained a long time in conference with Ala, Ingra staying\nconstantly with them, and when he had apparently finished his\n\"conversation\" we were surprised to see them begin a tour of inspection\nof the air ship, finally descending into the interior. This greatly\nexcited Jack, who was for following them at once.\n\n\"I can't be easy,\" he declared. \"Nobody can tell what may happen to him\nif they get him alone.\"\n\nBut I succeeded in persuading him that there could be no danger, and that\nwe ought to trust to Edmund's discretion. They were gone so long,\nhowever, that at last I became anxious myself, and was on the point of\nsuggesting to Jack that we try to find them, when they reappeared, and\nEdmund at once came to us, his face irradiated with smiles.\n\n\"I have plenty of news for you,\" he said, as soon as he had joined us.\n\"Never in my life have I spent two hours more delightfully. In the first\nplace, I have found out practically all that I wished to know about this\nexpedition, and, second, I have thoroughly examined the mechanism of the\nship. Its complication is only apparent, and the management of it is so\nsimple that a single man can pilot it easily. I could do it myself.\"\n\nWe did not appreciate at the time what the knowledge that Edmund had thus\nacquired meant for us.\n\n\"Well, what about the expedition?\" asked Jack. \"And where are we going?\"\n\n\"From what I can make out,\" replied Edmund musingly, \"Ala is really what\nyou called her, Jack, a queen. But such a queen! If we had some like her\non the earth, monarchy might not be such a bad thing after all. She is a\n_savant_.\"\n\n\"Bluestocking,\" put in Jack. \"This is a new kind of amazon.\"\n\nEdmund did not smile.\n\n\"I am in earnest,\" he continued. \"Of course you understand that most of\nmy conclusions are really based upon inference. I cannot grasp all that\nshe tries to tell me, but her gestures are so speaking, and her eyes so\nfull of a kind of meaning which seems to force its way into my mind, I\ncannot tell how, that I am virtually sure of the correctness of my\ninterpretation. The expedition, which I am certain was planned by her,\nwas intended to explore the outskirts of the dark hemisphere. Perhaps\nthey meant to penetrate within it, but, if so, the stormy belt that we\ncrossed was too serious an obstacle for them to overcome. Our\nencountering them was the greatest stroke of good fortune that we have\nyet had. It places us right at the center of affairs.\"\n\n\"Where are they going now?\"\n\n\"Evidently back to their starting point; which is likely to be a great\ncity--the capital and metropolis, most probably. The more I think of it\nthe stronger becomes my conviction that Ala is really, at least in power\nand influence, a queen. And you can see for yourselves that it must be a\ngreat and rich empire that she rules, for remember the extraordinary\nreception with which she was greeted, the innumerable air ships, the\nsplendor of everything.\"\n\n\"But are we to be well treated? Is there no danger for us in accompanying\nthem?\"\n\n\"If there were danger, it would be hard for us to escape from it now; but\nwhy should there be danger? We did not kill the Esquimaux that our polar\nexplorers brought from the Arctic regions, and for these people, we are a\ngreater curiosity than ever the Esquimaux, or the Pygmies of Africa, were\nfor us. Instead of encountering any danger, I anticipate that we shall be\nvery well treated.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they'll put us in a cage,\" said Jack, with a ludicrous grimace,\n\"and tote us about as a great moral show for children. If there's a\nBarnum on Venus, our fate is sealed.\"\n\nJack's humorous suggestion struck home, for there seemed to be\nprobability behind it, and Henry groaned, while, for my part, I confess\nthat I felt rather uncomfortable over the prospect. But Edmund did not\npursue the conversation, and soon we fell to regarding again the\nlandscape beneath and far around us. We were gradually nearing the\nmountains, although they were still distant, and presently we caught\nsight of what resembled, as much as anything, gigantic cobwebs glittering\nwith dew, and rising out of the plain between us and the mountains.\n\n\"There, Edmund,\" said Jack, \"there's another chance to exercise your\ngenius for explaining mysteries. What are those things?\"\n\nEdmund watched the objects for several minutes before replying. At length\nhe said, with the decision characteristic of him:\n\n\"Palaces.\"\n\nJack burst out laughing.\n\n\"Castles in Spain, I reckon,\" he said. \"But, really, Edmund, what do you\nthink they can be?\"\n\n\"I have already told you, palaces, or castles, if you prefer.\"\n\n\"You are serious?\" I asked.\n\n\"Perfectly so. They cannot be anything else.\"\n\nSeeing our astonishment and incredulity, Edmund added:\n\n\"Since they retain their places, it is evident that they are edifices of\nsome kind, attached to the ground. But their great height and aerial\nstructure indicate that they are erected in the air--floating, I should\nsay, but firmly anchored at the bottom. Really, I cannot see anything\nastonishing about it; it accords with everything else that we have seen.\nYour minds are too hidebound to terrestrial analogies, and you do not\ngive your imaginations sufficient play with the new materials that are\nhere offered.\n\n\"This atmosphere,\" he continued, after a pause, \"is exactly suited for\nsuch things. It is a region of atmospheric calm. If we were not moving,\nyou would hardly feel a breeze, and I doubt if there is ever a high wind\nhere. To build their habitations in the air and make them float like\ngossamers--could any idea be more beautiful than that, or more in harmony\nwith the nature of this planet, which is the favorite of the sun, for\nfirst he inundates it with a splendor unknown to the earth, and then\ngenerously covers it with a gorgeous screen of cloud which cuts off his\nscorching beams but suffers the light to pass, filtered to opalescent\nether?\"\n\nWhen Edmund spoke like that, as he sometimes did, suffusing his words\nwith the fervor of his imagination, even Henry, I believe, felt his soul\nlifted to unaccustomed heights. We hung upon his lips, and, without a\nword, waited for him to continue. Presently he murmured, in an undertone:\n\n\"Yes, all this I foresaw in my dream. A world of crystal, houses that\nseemed not made with hands, reaching toward heaven, and a people,\nbeautiful beyond compare, dwelling in the aerial home of birds\"; and\nthen, addressing us, in his ordinary tones: \"You will see that the\ncapital, which we are unquestionably approaching, is to a large extent\ncomposed of this airy architecture.\"\n\nAnd it turned out to be as he had said--when, indeed, was it ever\notherwise? As we drew nearer, the aerial structures which we had first\nseen began to tower up to an amazing height, just perceptibly swaying and\nundulating with the gentle currents of air that flowed through their\ntraceried lattices, while behind them began to loom an immense number of\nfloating towers, rising stage above stage, like the steel monsters of New\nYork before they have received their outer coverings, but incomparably\nlighter in appearance, and more delicate and graceful; truly fairy\nconstructions, bespangled with countless brilliant points. Yet nearer,\nand we could see cables attached to the higher structures, and running\ndownward as if anchored to the ground beneath, but the ground itself we\ncould not see, because now we had dropped lower in the air, and a long\nhill rose between us and the fairy towers, whose slight sinuous motion,\naffecting so many together, produced a trifling sense of dizziness as we\ngazed. Still nearer, and we believed that we could see people in the\nbuoyant towers. A minute later there was no doubt about their presence,\nfor the _colors_ broke forth, and that marvelous interchange of chromatic\nsignals, which had so astonished us as we drew near the coast, was\nresumed.\n\n\"It is my belief,\" said Edmund, \"that, notwithstanding the buoyancy of\nthe heavy atmosphere, those structures cannot be maintained at such\nelevations without mechanical aid. You will see when we get nearer that\nevery stage is furnished with some means of support, probably vertical\nscrews reacting upon the air.\"\n\nAgain he had guessed right, for in a little while we were near enough to\nsee the screws, working in a maze of motion, like the wings of a\nmultitude of insects. The resemblance was increased by their gauzy\nstructure, and, as they turned, they flashed and glittered as if\nenameled. (The supernatant structures that they maintained were, as we\nafterwards ascertained, framed of hollow beams and trusses--a kind of\nbamboo, of great strength and lightness.)\n\nNow we rose over the intervening hill, and as we did so a cry burst from\nour lips. A vast city made its appearance as by magic, a magnified\ncounterpart of the aerial city above it. Put all the glories of\nConstantinople, Damascus, Cairo, and Bombay, with all their spires,\ntowers, minarets, and domes together, and multiply their splendor a\nthousand times, and yet your imagination will be unable to picture the\nscene of enchantment on which our eyes rested.\n\n\"It is the capital of Venus,\" exclaimed Edmund. \"There can be nothing\ngreater than this!\"\n\nIt must, indeed, be the capital, for in the midst of it rose an edifice\nof unparalleled splendor, which could only be the palace of a mighty\nmonarch. Above this magnificent building, which gleamed with metallic\nreflections, although it was as light and airy in construction as\nfrostwork, rose the loftiest of the aerial towers, a hundred, two\nhundred--I cannot tell you how many stories in height, for I never\nsucceeded in counting them.\n\nThe other air ships now dropped back, and ours alone approached this\nstupendous tower, making apparently for its principal landing stage.\nAlong the sides of the tower a multitude of small air ships ran up and\ndown, stopping at various stages to discharge their living cargoes.\n\n\"Elevators,\" said Edmund.\n\nGlancing round we saw that similar scenes were occurring at all the\ntowers. They were filling up with people, and the continual rising and\ndescending of the little craft that bore them, the holiday aspect of the\ngay colors everywhere displayed, and the brilliancy of the whole\nspectacle moved us beyond words. But the most astonishing scene still\nawaited us.\n\nJust before our vessel reached the landing stage, the enormous tower,\nfrom foot to apex, broke out with all the hues of the rainbow, like an\nenchanted rose tree covered with millions of brilliant flowers at the\ntouch of a wand. The effect was overwhelming. The air became tremulous\nwith rippling colors, whose vibrant waves, with quick succession of\nconcordant tints afforded to the eye an exquisite pleasure akin to that\nwhich the ear receives from a carillon of bells. Our companions, and the\npeople crowded on the towers, seemed to be transported with ecstatic\ndelight.\n\n\"Again the music of the spectrum!\" cried Edmund. \"The diapason of color!\nIt is their national hymn, or the hymn of their race, written on a\nprismatic, instead of a sonometric, staff. And, mark me, this has a\nsignificance beyond your conjectures!\"\n\nI believe that our enjoyment of this astonishing spectacle was hardly\nless than that of the natives themselves, but the pleasure was suddenly\nbroken off by a tragedy that struck cold to our hearts.\n\nWe had nearly touched the landing, when we observed that a discussion was\ngoing on between Ala and Ingra, and it quickly became evident that we\nwere the subject of it. Before we could exchange a word, they approached\nus, and Ingra, in a threatening manner, laid his hand on Edmund's\nshoulder. In a second Jack had his pistol covering Ingra. Edmund saw the\nmotion, and struck Jack's arm aside, but the weapon exploded, and,\nclutching her breast, Ala fell at our feet!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nIMPRISONMENT AND A WONDERFUL ESCAPE\n\nThe shock of this terrible accident, the full import of which must have\nflashed simultaneously through the mind of every one of us, drove the\nblood from Edmund's face, while Jack staggered, uttering a pitiful moan,\nHenry collapsed, and I stood trembling in every limb. The report of the\npistol produced upon the natives the effect that was to have been\nexpected. Ingra sprang backward with a cry like that of a startled beast,\nand many upon the deck fell prostrate, either through terror or the\neffect of collision with one another in their wild flight. What occurred\namong the waiting crowd on the tower I do not precisely know, but a wind\nof fear seemed to pass through the air--a weird, heart-quaking _shadow of\nsound_.\n\nFor a few moments, I believe, no one but ourselves understood what had\nhappened to Ala. Ingra may have thought, if he thought at all in his\nterror and surprise, that she had fallen as the result of nervous shock.\nThis moment of paralysis on the part of those whom we had now to regard\nas our enemies, whatever they may have been before, afforded the\nopportunity for escape--if there had been any way to escape. But we were\ncompletely trapped; there was no direction in which we could flee. Yet I\ndoubt if the thought of flight occurred to any of us. Certainly it did\nnot to Edmund, who was the first to recover his self-command.\n\n\"_We have shot down our only friend!_\" he said with terrible emphasis,\nand, as he spoke, he lifted Ala in his arms and laid her on a seat. Her\nbreast was stained with blood.\n\nAt the sight of this, a flash of comprehension passed over the features\nof Ingra; then, instantly, his face changed to a look of fury, and he\nsprang upon Edmund. With trembling hand, I tried to draw my pistol, but\nbefore I could get it from my pocket there was a rush, a hairy form\ndarted past me, and Ingra lay sprawling on his back. Over him, with foot\nplanted on his breast, stood the burly form of Juba, with his muscular\narms uplifted, and his enormous eyes blazing fire!\n\nGod only knows what would have happened next, but at this instant Ala--to\nmy amazement, for I had thought that the bullet had gone through her\nheart--rose to an upright posture, and made a commanding gesture, which\narrested those who were now hurrying to take a part in the scene. All,\nnatives as well as ourselves, stood as motionless as stone. Her face was\npale and her eyes were wonderful to look upon. With a gasp of\nthankfulness, I noticed that the blood on her breast was but a narrow\nstreak Juba, staring at her, slowly withdrew his foot from his prostrate\nopponent, and Ingra first sat up, and then got upon his feet. Ala, who\nhad been seated, rose at the same moment, and looked Ingra straight in\nthe face. I saw Edmund glancing from one to the other, and I knew he was\ntrying to follow the communication that was taking place between them.\n\nThe general sense of it I could follow, myself. Ingra, metaphorically,\nstormed and Ala commanded. That she was defending us was plain, and it\nwas but natural that my admiration for this wonderful woman should rise\nto the highest pitch. I thanked God, in my heart, that her wound could be\nno more than a scratch--and yet it was a wound, inflicted upon the person\nof her who, there could be no doubt, was the ruler of a powerful empire.\nIt was less majesty, or worse, and she, herself, might not be able to\nprotect us against its consequences.\n\nAt last, it became evident that a decision had been made. Ala turned to\nus with a smile, which we took for an assurance of encouragement, at\nleast, and started to leave the deck. Edmund instantly stepped in front\nof her, and pointed to the stain of blood, with a gesture and a look\nwhich meant, at the same time, an inquiry as to the nature of the wound\nand an expression of the wish to do something to repair the injury. She\nshook her head and smiled again, in a manner which clearly said that the\nhurt was not serious and that she understood that it was an accident.\nThen, surrounded by her female attendants, she passed out of our sight in\nthe crowd on the landing. Edmund turned to us:\n\n\"We shall probably get out of it all right,\" he said, \"but not without\nsome difficulty. They will surely imprison us. Make no resistance. Leave\nall to me. Jack's pistol will, no doubt, be seized, but if the rest of\nyou keep yours concealed, they may not search for them, as they know\nnothing about the weapons.\"\n\nEdmund had spoken hurriedly, and had hardly finished when a dozen stout\nfellows, under Ingra's directions, took us in charge, Juba included, and\nwe were led from the deck, through the vast throng on the platform, who\nmade room for our passage, while devouring us with curious, though\nfrightened eyes. In a minute we embarked on one of the \"elevators,\" and\nmade a thrillingly rapid descent. Arrived at the bottom, we were\nconducted, through long, stone-walled passages, into a veritable dungeon.\nAnd there they left us. I wondered if this had been done at Ala's order,\nor in defiance of her wishes. After all, I reflected, what claim have we\nupon her?\n\nIn the absolute darkness where we now found ourselves, we remained silent\nfor a minute or two, feeling about for one another, until the quiet voice\nof Edmund said:\n\n\"Fortune still favors us.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a light dazzled our eyes. He had turned on a pocket electric\nlamp. We looked about and found that we were in a square chamber, about\nfifteen feet on a side, with walls of heavy stone.\n\n\"They make things solid enough down here,\" said Jack, with some return of\nhis usual spirits, \"however airy and fairy they may be above.\"\n\n\"All the better for us,\" returned Edmund enigmatically.\n\nHenry sank upon the floor, the picture of dejection and despair. I\nexpected another outbreak from him, but he spoke not a word. His heart\nwas too full for utterance, and I pitied him so much that I tried to\nreanimate his spirits.\n\n\"Come, now,\" I said, \"don't take it this way, man. Have confidence in\nEdmund. He has never yet been beaten.\"\n\n\"I reckon he's got his hands full this time,\" put in Jack. \"What do you\nthink, Edmund, can your atomic energy bore a hole through these walls?\"\n\n\"If I had it here, you'd see,\" Edmund replied. \"But there's no occasion\nto worry, we'll come out all right.\"\n\nIt was his unfailing remark when in difficulties, and somehow it always\nenheartened us. Juba, more accustomed to such situations, seemed the\nleast disturbed member of the party. He rolled his huge eyes around the\napartment once or twice, and then lay down on the floor, and seemed at\nonce to fall asleep.\n\n\"That's a good idea of Juba's,\" said Edmund, smiling; \"it's a long time\nsince we have had a nap. Let's all try a little sleep. I may dream of\nsome way out of this.\"\n\nIt was a fact that we were all exhausted for want of sleep, and, in spite\nof our situation, I soon fell into deep slumber, as peaceful as if I had\nbeen in my bed at home. Edmund had turned out the lamp, and the silence\nand darkness were equally profound.\n\nI dreamt that I was at the Olympus Club on the point of trumping an ace,\nwhen a flash of light in the eyes awoke me. I started up and found Edmund\nstanding over me. The others were all on their feet. Edmund immediately\nwhispered:\n\n\"Come quietly; I've found a way out.\"\n\n\"What have you found?\"\n\n\"Something extremely simple. This is no prison cell, but a part of what\nappears to be the engine rooms--probably it is an unused storeroom. They\nhave put us here for convenience, trusting more to the darkness than to\nthe lock, for the corridors outside are as black as Erebus and as crooked\nas a labyrinth.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because, while you were all asleep, I made an exploration. The lock was\nnothing; the merest tyro could pick it. Fortunately they never guessed\nthat I had a lamp. In this world of daylight, it is not likely that\npocket lamps have ever been thought of. Just around the corner, there is\nanother door opening into a passage that leads by a power house. That\npassage gives access to a sort of garage of air craft, and when I stole\ninto it five minutes ago, there was not a soul in sight. We'll simply\nslip in there, and if I can't run away with one of those fliers, then I'm\nno engineer. To tell the truth, I'm not altogether sure that it is wise\nfor us to escape, for I have a feeling that Ala will help us; still, when\nProvidence throws one a rope, it's best, perhaps, to test its strength.\nCome on, now, and make no noise.\"\n\nAccompanied by Juba, we stepped noiselessly outside, extinguishing the\nlight, and, led by Edmund, passed what he had called the power house,\nwhere we saw several fellows absorbed in their work, lighted somehow from\nabove. Then we slipped into the \"garage.\" Here light entered from\nwithout, through a large opening at the side. There may have been twenty\nsmall air ships resting on cradles. Edmund selected one, which he\nappeared to have examined in advance, and motioning us to step upon its\nlittle deck, he began to manipulate the mechanism as confidently as if it\nhad been his own invention.\n\n\"You see that I did not waste my time in examining the air ship that\nbrought us,\" he whispered, and never before had I admired and trusted him\nas I did now. In less than a minute after we had stepped aboard, we were\ncircling in the air outside. We rose with stunning rapidity, swooping\naway in a curve like an eagle.\n\nAt this instant we were seen!\n\nThere was a quick flashing of signals, and two air craft shot into sight\nabove us.\n\n\"Now for a chase!\" cried Edmund, actually laughing with exultation.\n\nWe darted upward, curving aside to avoid the pursuers. And then they\nswooped after us. We rose so rapidly that within a couple of seconds we\nwere skirting the upper part of the great tower. Then others saw us, and\njoined in the chase. Jack's spirits soared with the excitement:\n\n\"Sorry to take rogue's leave of these Venuses,\" he exclaimed. \"But no\ndungeons for us, if you please.\"\n\n\"We're not away, yet,\" said Edmund over his shoulder; and, indeed, we\nwere not!\n\nThe air ships swarmed out on every side like hornets; the atmosphere\nseemed full of them. I gave up all hope of escape, but Edmund was like a\nracer who hears the thud of hoofs behind him. He put on more and more\nspeed until we were compelled to hang on to anything within reach in\norder to save ourselves from being blown off by the wind which we made,\nor whirled overboard on sharp turns.\n\nCrash! We had run straight into a huge craft that persisted in getting in\nour way. She dipped and rolled like a floating log. I saw the fellows on\nher tumble over one another, as we shot by, and I glanced anxiously to\nsee if any had gone overboard. We could afford to do no killing if we\ncould avoid it; for, in case of recapture, that would be another\nindictment against us. I saw no one falling from the discomfited air\nship, and I felt reassured. Occupied as he was, dodging and turning,\nEdmund did not cease to address a few words to us occasionally.\n\n\"There's just one chance to beat them,\" he said, \"and only one. I'm going\nto try it as soon as I can get out of this press.\"\n\nI had no notion of what he meant, but a few minutes later I divined his\nintention. I had observed that all the while he was working higher and\nhigher, and this, as you will presently see, was the key to his plan.\n\nUp and up we shot, Edmund making the necessary circles as short as\npossible, and so recklessly did he turn on the speed that it really began\nto look as if we might get away after all. Two thirds of our pursuers\nwere now far below our level, but none showed a disposition to give up\nthe chase, and those which were yet above tried to cross our bow. While I\nsaw that Edmund's idea was to hold a skyward course, I was far from\nguessing the particular reason he had for doing so, and, finally, Jack,\nwho comprehended it still less, exclaimed:\n\n\"See here, Edmund, if you keep on going up instead of running off in one\ndirection or another, they'll corner you in the middle of the sky. Don't\nyou see how they have circled out on all sides so as to surround us? Then\nwhen we get as high as we can go, they'll simply close in, and we'll be\ntrapped.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, we won't,\" Edmund replied.\n\n\"I don't see why.\"\n\n\"Because they can't go as high as we can.\"\n\n\"The deuce they can't! I guess they understand these ships as well as you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Can a fish live out of water?\" asked Edmund, laughing.\n\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Why, it's plain enough. These people are used to breathing an atmosphere\nsurcharged with oxygen and twice as dense as that of the earth. It\ndoesn't trouble our breathing, simply giving us more energy; but we can\nlive where they would gasp for breath. Air impossibly rare for them is\nall right for us, and that's what I am in search of, and we shall find it\nif we can get high enough.\"\n\nThe beauty and simplicity of this unexpected plan struck us all with\nadmiration, and Jack, his doubts instantly turning to enthusiasm, cried:\n\n\"By Jo, Edmund, you're a trump! I'd like to get a gaff into the gills of\nthat catfish, Ingra, when he begins to blow. By Jo, I'd pickle him and\nmake a present of him to the Museum of Natural History. '_Catfishia\nVenusensis_, presented by Jack Ashton, Esq.'--how'd that look on a label,\nhey?\"\n\nAnd Jack hugged himself with delight over his conceit.\n\nIn a short time the accuracy of Edmund's conjecture became apparent. Our\npursuers, one by one, dropped off. Their own strategy, to which Jack had\ncalled attention, was simply a playing into our hands. They had really\nthought to catch us in the center of a contracting circle, when, to their\namazement, we rose straight up into air so rare that they could not live\nin it. Edmund roared with laughter when he saw the assured success of his\nmaneuver.\n\nBut there was one thing which even he had overlooked, and it struck to\nour hearts when we became aware of it. Poor, faithful Juba, who had so\nrecently proved his devotion to us, could endure this rare air no better\nthan our pursuers. Already, unnoticed in the excitement, he had fallen\nupon the deck, where he lay gasping.\n\n\"Good God, he's dying!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"He shall not die!\" responded Edmund, setting his lips, and turning to\nhis machinery.\n\n\"But, you're not going back down there!\"\n\n\"I'll run beyond the edge of the circle, and drop down far enough to\nrevive him. Then we can keep dodging up and down just out of their reach,\nand so be out of danger both ways.\"\n\nNo sooner said than done. We ran rapidly on a horizontal course until we\nhad cleared the air ships below, and then dropped like a shot. Juba came\nto his senses in a few moments after we entered the denser air. But now\nour pursuers, thinking, no doubt, that we had found it impracticable to\nremain where they knew they could not go, began to close in upon us. I\nreflected that here was the only mistake that Edmund had made--I mean the\nbringing along with us of the natives of the dark hemisphere. It was only\ntheir presence that had prevented us from sailing triumphantly over the\ncrystal mountains; it was because of them that we had wrecked the car;\nand now it was Juba who baffled our best chance of escape. And yet--and I\nam glad to be able to say it--I could not regret his presence, for had he\nnot made himself one of us; had he not proved himself entitled to all the\nprivileges of comradeship?\n\nBut Henry (I am sorry to write it) did not share these feelings.\n\n\"Edmund,\" he said, \"why do you insist upon endangering our lives for the\nsake of this--this--animal here?\"\n\nNever have I beheld such a blaze of anger as that which burst from\nEdmund's eyes as he turned upon Henry:\n\n\"You cowardly brute!\" he shouted. \"I ought to throw you overboard!\"\n\nHe seemed about to execute his threat, dropping the controller from his\nhand as he spoke, and Henry, with ashen face, ran from him like a madman.\nI caught him in my arms, fearing that he would tumble overboard in his\nfright, and Edmund, instantly recovering his composure, turned back to\nhis work.\n\nFinding Juba sufficiently recovered, although yet weak and almost\nhelpless, he rose again, but more cautiously than before. And now our\npursuers, plainly believing that these maneuvers could have but one\nending, began to set their net, and I could not help admiring their plan,\nwhich would surely have succeeded if they had not made a fundamental\nerror in their calculations, but one for which they were not to blame.\nThere was such a multitude of their craft, fresh ones coming up all the\nwhile, that they were able to form themselves into the shape of a huge\nbag net, the edge of which was carried as high as they dared to go, while\nthe sides and receding bottom were composed of air ships so numerous that\nthey were packed almost as closely as meshes. Edmund laughed again as he\nlooked down into this immense net.\n\n\"No, no,\" he shouted. \"We're no gudgeons! You'll have to do better than\nthat!\"\n\n\"See here, Edmund,\" Jack suddenly exclaimed, \"why don't you make off and\nleave them? By keeping just above their reach we could easily escape.\"\n\n\"_And leave the car?_\" was the reply.\n\n\"By Jo,\" returned Jack, \"I never thought of that. But, then, what did you\nrun away for at all?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Edmund quietly, \"I thought it better to parley than to\nlie in prison.\"\n\n\"Parley! How are you going to parley?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen; but I guess we'll manage it.\"\n\nWe were now, as far as I could estimate, five or six miles high. When we\nwere highest, the great cloud dome seemed to be but a little way above\nour heads, and I thought, at first, that Edmund intended to run up into\nit and thus conceal our movements. The highest of our pursuers were about\nhalf a mile below us. They circled about, and were evidently parleying on\ntheir own account, for waves of color flowed all about them, making a\nspectacle so brilliant and beautiful that sometimes I almost forgot our\ncritical situation in watching it.\n\n\"I suppose you'll play them a prismatic symphony,\" said Henry mockingly.\n\nI looked at him in surprise. Evidently his fear of Edmund had vanished;\nno doubt because he knew in his heart the magnanimity of our great\nleader.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Edmund replied. \"I've no doubt the materials are aboard, and\nif I had been here a month, I'd probably try it. As things stand, we\nshall have to resort to other methods.\"\n\nWhile we were talking, Edmund did not relax his vigilance, and two or\nthree times, when he had dropped to a lesser elevation for Juba's sake,\nhe baffled a dash of the enemy. At last we noticed a movement in the\ncrowd which betokened something of importance, and in a moment we saw\nwhat it was. A splendid air ship, by far the most beautiful that we had\nyet seen, was swiftly approaching from below.\n\n\"It's the queen,\" said Edmund. \"I thought she'd come.\"\n\nThe approaching ship made its way straight toward us, and, without the\nslightest hesitation, Edmund dropped down to meet it. Those who had been\nour pursuers now made no attempt to interfere with us; they recognized\nthe presence of a superior authority. Soon we were so near that we could\nrecognize Ala, who looked like Cleopatra in her barge on the charmed\nwaves of Cydnus. Beside her, to the intense disappointment of Jack and\nmyself, stood Ingra.\n\n\"Confound him!\" growled Jack. \"He's always got to have his oar in the\npuddle. Blamed if I'm not sorry Edmund spoiled my aim. I'd have had his\nscalp to hang up at the Olympus to be smoked at!\"\n\nOf what now occurred, I can give no detailed account, because it was all\nbeyond my comprehension. We approached almost within touch, and then\nEdmund stood forth, fearless and splendid as Caesar, and conducted his\n\"parley.\" When it was over, there was a flashing of aerial colors between\nAla's ship and the others, and then all, including ours, set out to\nreturn to the capital. After a while Edmund, who had been very\nthoughtful, turned to us and said:\n\n\"You can make your minds easy. Of course you'll understand there is a\ncertain amount of guesswork in what I tell you, but you can depend upon\nthe correctness of my general conclusions. I believe that I have made it\nperfectly clear that we intended no harm, and that we are not dangerous\ncharacters. At least Ala understands it perfectly. As for Ingra, perhaps\nhe doesn't want to understand it. I can't make out the cause of his\nenmity, but it is certain that he doesn't like us, and if it all depended\nupon him, it would go hard with us. I believe that we shall have to stand\na trial of some kind, but remember that we've got a powerful advocate. I\ndon't regret our running off, for, as I anticipated, it afforded us the\nopportunity to establish some sort of terms. The mere fact that we return\nwillingly when they know that we might have fled beyond their reach\nshould count in our favor, for, as I have always insisted, these are\nhighly intelligent people, with civilized ideas. If I had not been sure\nof that I should have continued the flight and depended upon some other\nmeans of recovering the car--or constructing a new one.\"\n\nWe had become so much accustomed to accept Edmund's decisions as final\nthat none of us thought of objecting to what he had done; unless it might\nhave been Henry, but he kept his thoughts to himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nBEFORE THE THRONE OF VENUS\n\nWhile we were dropping down toward the city, with a great fleet of air\nships attending, Edmund opened his mind upon another curious difficulty\nbesetting us.\n\n\"You, of course, noted,\" he said, \"how close we approached at one time to\nthe cloud dome. The existence of that sky screen is a circumstance which\nmay possibly be decisive in the determination of our fate.\"\n\n\"Favorable or unfavorable?\" I asked.\n\n\"Unfavorable, for this reason. If these people could be made to\nunderstand that we are visitors from another world, and not inhabitants\nof the other side of their own planet, they might treat us with greater\nconsideration, and even with a certain superstitious deference. The\nimagination is doubtless as active with them as with terrestrial beings,\nand if you can once touch the imagination, even of the most intelligent\nand instructed persons, you can do almost anything you choose with them.\nBut how am I to convey to them any idea of this kind? Seeing neither sun,\nnor moon, nor stars, they can have no conception of such a thing as\nanother world than their own.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you persuade them,\" said Jack, \"that we come from the upper\nside of the cloud dome? You could pretend that it's very fine living up\nthere--plenty of sunshine and good air.\"\n\nEdmund laughed.\n\n\"I'm afraid, Jack, that they are too intelligent to believe that a person\nof your avoirdupois could walk on the clouds. You're not quite angelic\nenough for that. I'm sure that they know perfectly well what the dome\nconsists of.\"\n\n\"The presence of Juba with us is another difficulty,\" I suggested. \"If,\nas you suppose, they recognize certain racial characteristics in him,\nwhich convince them that he belongs to the other side of Venus, then they\nare sure to believe that we belong there, too.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But I must find some way round the difficulty. I depend upon\nthe intelligence of Ala. If she had been killed, nothing could have saved\nus. We have had an unpleasant escape from something too closely\nresembling the misfortune of Oedipus.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, we reached the capital and disembarked on the great\ntower. To our intense surprise and delight, instead of being reconducted\nto prison, we were led into a magnificent apartment, with open arches\nfacing toward the distant mountains, and a repast was spread before us.\nJuba, to our great contentment, was allowed to accompany us. I think that\nJack was the most pleased member of the party at the sight of the food.\nWe sat at a round table, and I observed that the eatables consisted, as\nwith Juba's people, exclusively of vegetables, except that there were\nbirds, of species unknown to us, but of most exquisite flavor, and a\nlight, white wine, the most delicious that I ever tasted.\n\nWhen we had finished eating, we fell to admiring the view, and Jack\npulled out his pipe, and, aided by Edmund's pocket lamp, which possessed\nan attachment for cigar lighting, began to smoke, leaning back\nluxuriously in his seat, with as much nonchalance as if he had been in\nthe smoking room at the Olympus. I think I may say that we all exhibited\na _sang froid_ amidst our novel surroundings that would have astonished\nus if we had stopped to analyze our feelings, but in that respect Jack\nwas often the coolest member of the party, although he had not the iron\nnerves of Edmund. On this occasion, he was not long in producing a\nsensation. No sooner had the smoke begun to curl from his lips than the\nattendants in the room were thrown into a state of laughable\nconsternation. Evidently they thought, like the servant of Walter\nRaleigh, that the smoke must come from an internal fire. Their looks\nshowed alarm as well as astonishment.\n\n\"Keep your pipe concealed,\" whispered Edmund. \"Take a few strong whiffs,\nand hide it in your pocket before they observe whence the smoke really\ncomes. This may do us some good; it will, at least, serve to awake their\nimagination, and that is what we need.\"\n\nJack did as requested, first filling his mouth with smoke, and then\nslowly letting it out in puffs that more and more astonished the\nonlookers, who kept at a respectful distance, and excitedly discussed the\nphenomenon. Suddenly, Jack, with characteristic mobility of thought,\nturned to Edmund and demanded:\n\n\"Edmund, why didn't those fellows shoot us when we were running away?\nThere were enough of them to bring us down with the wildest sort of\nshooting.\"\n\n\"They didn't shoot,\" was the reply, \"because they had nothing to shoot\nwith. I have made up my mind that they are an unwarlike people. I don't\nbelieve that they have the slightest idea what a gun is. Yet they are no\ncowards, and they'll fight if there is need of fighting, and no doubt\nthey have weapons of some kind; only they are not natural slaughterers\nlike ourselves, and I shouldn't be surprised if war is unknown on Venus.\n\n\"All the same,\" said Jack, \"I wish I had my pistol back. I tried to hide\nit, but those fellows had their eyes on it, and it's confiscated. I'm\nglad you think they don't know how to use it.\"\n\n\"And I'm glad,\" returned Edmund, \"that you haven't got your pistol.\nYou've been altogether too handy with it. Now,\" he continued, \"let us\nconsider our situation. You see at a glance that we have gained a great\ndeal as a result of the parley; the way we have just been treated here\nshows plainly enough that we shall, at least, have a fair trial, and we\ncouldn't have counted on that before. You can never make people listen to\nreason against their inclination unless you hold certain advantages, and\nour advantage was that we clearly had it in our power to continue our\nflight. My only anxiety now is in regard to the means of holding them to\nthe agreement--for agreement it certainly was--and of impressing them not\nonly with a conviction of our innocence but with a sense of our reserve\npower, and the more mysterious I can make that power seem to them, the\nbetter. That is why I welcomed even the incident of Jack's smoking. We\nshall surely be arraigned before a court of some kind, and I imagine that\nwe shall not have long to wait. What I wish particularly is that all of\nyou shall desist from every thought of resistance, and follow strictly\nsuch instructions as I may have occasion to give you.\"\n\nHe had hardly ceased speaking when a number of official-looking persons\nentered the room where we were.\n\n\"Here come the cops,\" said Jack. \"Now for the police court.\"\n\nHe was not very far wrong. We were gravely conducted to one of the little\ncraft which served for elevators, and after a rapid descent, were led\nthrough a maze of passages terminating in a vast and splendid apartment,\napparently perfectly square in plan, and at least three hundred feet on a\nside. It was half filled with a brilliant throng, in which our entry\ncaused a sensation. Light entered through lofty windows on all four\nsides. The floor seemed to be of a rose-colored marble, with inlaid\ndiapering of lapis lazuli, and the walls and ceiling were equally rich.\nBut that which absolutely fascinated the eye in this great apartment was\na huge circle high on the wall opposite the entrance door, like a great\nclock face, or the rose window of a cathedral, from which poured\ntrembling streams of colored light.\n\n\"Chromatic music, once more,\" said Edmund, in a subdued voice. \"Do you\nknow, that has a strange effect upon my spirits, situated as we are. It\nis a prelude that may announce our fate; it might reveal to us the\ncomplexion of our judges, if I could but read its meaning.\"\n\n\"It is too beautiful to spell tragedy,\" I said.\n\n\"Ah, who knows? What is so fascinating as tragedy for those who are only\nlookers-on?\"\n\n\"But, Edmund,\" I protested, \"why do you, who are always the most hopeful,\nnow fall into despondency?\"\n\n\"I am not desponding,\" he replied, straightening up. \"But this soundless\nmusic thrills me with its mysterious power, and sometimes it throws me\ninto dejection, though I cannot tell why. To me, when what I firmly\nbelieve was the great anthem of this wonderful race, was played in the\nsky with spectral harmonies, there was, underlying all its mystic beauty,\nan infinite sadness, an impending sense of something tragic and\nterrible.\"\n\nI was deeply surprised and touched by Edmund's manner, and would have\nquestioned him further, but we were interrupted by the officials, who now\nled us across the vast apartment and to the foot of a kind of throne\nwhich stood directly under the great clock face. Then, for the first\ntime, we recognized Ala, seated on the throne. Beside her was a person of\nmajestic stature, with features like those of a statue of Zeus, and long\ncurling hair of snowy whiteness. The severity of his aspect struck cold\nto my heart, but Ala's countenance was smiling and full of encouragement.\nAs we were led to our places a hush fell upon the throng of attendants,\nand the colors ceased to play from the circle.\n\n\"Orchestra stopped,\" whispered the irrepressible Jack. \"Curtain rises.\"\n\nThe pause that followed brought a fearful strain upon my nerves, but in a\nmoment it was broken by Ala, who fixed her eyes upon Edmund's face as he\nstood a little in advance of the rest of us. He returned her regard\nunflinchingly. Every trace of the feeling which he had expressed to me\nwas gone. He stood erect, confident, masterful, and as I looked, I felt a\nthrill of pride in him, pride in his genius which had brought us hither,\npride in our mother earth--for were we not her far-wandering children?\n\n[Illustration: \"'Who and what are you, and whence do you come?'\"]\n\nI summoned all my powers in the effort to understand the tongueless\nspeech which I knew was issuing from Ala's eyes. And I did understand it!\nAlthough there was not a sound, I would almost have sworn that my ears\nheard the words:\n\n\"Who and what are you, and whence do you come?\"\n\nBreathlessly I awaited Edmund's answer. He slowly lifted his hand and\npointed upward. He was, then, going at once to proclaim our origin from\nanother world; to throw over us the aegis of the earth!\n\nThe critical experiment had begun, and I shivered at the thought that\nhere they knew no earth; here no flag could protect us. I saw perplexity\nand surprise in Ala's eyes and in those of the stern Zeus beside her.\nSuddenly a derisive smile appeared on the latter's lips, while Ala's\nconfusion continued. God! Were we to fail at the very beginning?\n\nEdmund calmly repeated his gesture, but it met with no response; no\nindication appeared to show that it awakened any feeling other than\nuncomprehending astonishment in one of his judges and derision in the\nother. And then, with a start, I caught sight of Ingra, standing close\nbeside the throne, his face made more ugly by the grin which overspread\nit.\n\nI was almost wild; I opened my mouth to cry I know not what, when there\nwas a movement behind, and Juba stepped to Edmund's side, dropped on his\nknees, rose again, and fixed his great eyes upon the judges!\n\nMy heart bounded at the thoughts which now raced through my brain. Juba\nbelonged to their world, however remote the ancestral connection might\nbe; he possessed at least the elements of their unspoken language; and\n_it might be a tradition among his people, who we knew worshipped the\nearth-star, that it was a brighter world than theirs_. Had Edmund's\ngesture suddenly suggested to his mind the truth concerning us--a truth\nwhich the others had not his means of comprehending--and could he now\nbear effective testimony in our favor?\n\nWith what trembling anxiety I watched his movements! Edmund, too, looked\nat him with mingled surprise and interest in his face. Presently he\nraised his long arm, as Edmund had done, and pointed upward. A momentary\nchill of disappointment ran through me--could he do no more than that?\nBut he _did_ more. Half unconsciously I had stepped forward where I could\nsee his face. _His eyes were speaking._ I knew it. And, thank God! there\nwas a gleam of intelligence answering him from the eyes of our judges.\n\nHe had made his point; he had suggested to them a thought of which they\nhad never dreamed!\n\nThey did not thoroughly comprehend him; I could see that, for he must\nhave been for them like one speaking a different dialect, to say nothing\nof the fundamental difficulty of the idea that he was trying to convey,\nbut yet the meaning did not escape, and as he continued his strange\ncommunication, the wonder spread from face to face, for it was not only\nthe judges who had grasped the general sense of what he was telling them.\nEven at that critical moment there came over me a feeling of admiration\nfor a language like this; a truly universal language, not limited by\nrules of speech or hampered by grammatical structure. At length it became\nevident that Juba had finished, but he continued standing at Edmund's\nside.\n\nAla and her white-headed companion looked at one another, and I tried to\nread their thoughts. In her face, I believed that I could detect every\nsign of hope for us. Occasionally she glanced with a smile at Edmund. But\nthe old judge was more implacable, or more incredulous. There was no\nkindness in his looks, and slowly it became clear that Ala and he were\nopposed in their opinion.\n\nSuddenly she placed her hand upon her breast, where the bullet must have\ngrazed her, and made an energetic gesture, including us in its sweep,\nwhich I interpreted to mean that she had no umbrage against those who had\nunintentionally injured her. It was plain that she insisted upon this\npoint, making it a matter personal to herself, and my hopes rose when I\nthought that I detected signs of yielding on the part of the other. At\nthis moment, when the decision seemed to hang in the balance, a new\nelement was introduced into the case with dramatic suddenness and\noverwhelming force.\n\nFor several minutes I had seen nothing of Ingra, but my thoughts had been\ntoo much occupied with more important things to take heed of his\nmovements. Now he appeared at the left of the throne, leading a file of\nfellows bearing a burden. They went direct to the foot of the throne, and\ndeposited their burden within a yard of the place where Edmund was\nstanding. They drew off a covering, and I could not repress a cry of\nconsternation.\n\nIt was the body of one of their compatriots, and a glance at it sufficed\nto show the manner in which death had been inflicted. It had been crushed\nin a way which could probably mean nothing else than a fearful fall. The\ntruth flashed upon me like a gleaming sword. The victim must have been\nprecipitated from the air ship which we had struck at the beginning of\nour flight!\n\nAnd there stood our enemy, Ingra, with exultation written on his\nfeatures. He had made a master stroke, like a skillful prosecutor.\n\n\"Hang him!\" I heard Jack mutter between his teeth. \"Oh, if I only had my\npistol!\"\n\n\"Then you would make matters a hundred times worse,\" I whispered. \"Keep\nyour head, and remember Edmund's injunction.\"\n\nThe behavior of the latter again awoke my utmost admiration.\nContemptuously turning his back upon Ingra, he faced Ala and old Zeus,\nand as their regards mingled, I knew well what he was trying to express.\nThis time, since his meaning involved no conception lying utterly beyond\ntheir experience, he was more successful. He told them that the death of\nthis person was a fact hitherto unknown to us, and that, like the injury\nto Ala, it had been inflicted without our volition. I believed that this\nplea, too, was accepted as valid by Ala; but not so with the other. He\nunderstood it perfectly, and he rejected it on the instant. My reason\ntold me that nothing else could have been expected of him, for, truly,\nthis was drawing it rather strong--to claim twice in succession immunity\nfor evils which had undeniably originated from us.\n\nOur case looked blacker and blacker, as it became evident that the\nopposition between our two judges had broken out again, and was now more\ndecided than before. The features of the old man grew fearfully stern,\nand he rejected all the apparent overtures of Ala. He had been willing to\npardon the injury and insult to her person, since she herself insisted\nupon pardon, but now the affair was entirely different. Whether purposely\nor not, we had caused the death of a subject of the realm, and he was not\nto be swerved aside from what he regarded as his duty. My nerves shook at\nthe thought that we knew absolutely nothing about the social laws of this\npeople, and that, among them, the rule of an eye for an eye, and blood\nfor blood, might be more inviolable than it had ever been on the earth.\n\nAs the discussion proceeded, with an intensity which spoken words could\nnot have imparted to it, Ala's cheeks began to glow, and her eyes to\nglitter with strange light. One could see the resistance in them rising\nto passion, and, at last, as the aged judge again shook his head, with\ngreater emphasis than ever, she rose, as if suddenly transformed. The\nmajestic splendor of her countenance was thrilling. Lifting her jeweled\narm with an imperious gesture, she commanded the attendants to remove the\nbier, and was instantly obeyed. Then she beckoned to Edmund, and without\nan instant's hesitation, he stepped upon the lower stage of the throne.\nWith the stride of a queen, she descended to his side, and, resting her\nhand on his shoulder, looked about her with a manner which said, as no\nwords could have done:\n\n\"It is the power of my protection which encircles him!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nMORE MARVELS\n\nIt was not until long afterwards that we fully comprehended all that Ala\nhad done in that simple act; but I will tell you now what it meant. By\nthe unwritten law of this realm of Venus, she, as queen, had the right to\ninterpose between justice and its victim, and such interposition was\nalways expressed in the way which we had witnessed. It was a right rarely\nexercised, and probably few then present had ever before seen it put into\naction. The sensation which it caused was, in consequence, exceedingly\ngreat, and a murmur of astonishment arose from the throng in the great\napartment, and hundreds pressed around the throne, staring at us and at\nthe queen. The majestic look which had accompanied her act gradually\nfaded, and her features resumed their customary expression of kindness.\nThe old judge had risen as she stepped from her place beside him, and he\nseemed as much astonished as any onlooker. His hands trembled, he shook\nhis head, and a single word came from his mouth, pronounced with a\ncurious emphasis. Ala turned to him, with a new defiance in her eyes,\nbefore which his opposition seemed to wither, and he sank back into his\nseat.\n\nBut there was at least one person present who accepted the decision with\na bad grace--Ingra. He had been sure of victory in his incomprehensible\npersecution of us, he had played a master card, and now his\ndisappointment was written upon his face. With surprise, I saw Ala\napproach him, smiling, and I was convinced that she was trying to\npersuade him to cease his opposition. There was a gentleness in her\nmanner--almost a deference--which grated upon my feelings, while Jack's\ndisgust could find no words sufficient to express itself:\n\n\"Beauty and the beast!\" he growled. \"By Jo, if _he's_ got any influence\nover her, I'm sorry for her.\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't worry about him,\" I said. \"He's played his hand and\nlost, and if you were in his place, you wouldn't feel any better about\nit.\"\n\n\"No, I'd go and hang myself, and that's what he ought to do. But isn't\n_she_ a queen, though!\"\n\nAla now resumed her place upon the throne, and issued orders which\nresulted in our being conducted to apartments that were set aside for us\nin the palace. There were four connecting rooms, and Juba had one of\nthem. But we immediately assembled in the chief apartment, which had been\nassigned to Edmund. There was much more deference in the manner of our\nattendants than we had observed before, and as soon as they left us we\nfell to discussing the recent events. Jack's first characteristic act was\njoyously to slap Juba on the back:\n\n\"Bully old boy!\" he exclaimed. \"Edmund, where'd we have been without\nJuba?\"\n\n\"I ought to have foreseen that,\" said Edmund. \"If I had been as wise as I\nsometimes think myself, I'd have arranged the thing differently. Of\ncourse it should have been obvious all the while that Juba would be our\ntrump card. I dimly saw that, but I ought to have instructed him in\nadvance. As it was, his own intelligence did the business. He understood\nmy claim to an origin outside this planet, when they could not. It must\nhave come over him all at a flash.\"\n\n\"But do you think that they understand it now?\" I asked.\n\n\"To a certain extent, yes. But it is an utterly new idea to them, and all\nthe better for us that it is so. It is so much the more mysterious; so\nmuch the more effective with the imagination. But this is not the end of\nit; they will want to know more--especially Ala--and now that Juba has\nbroken the ice, it will be comparatively easy to fortify the new opinion\nwhich they have conceived of us.\"\n\n\"But Ingra nearly wrecked it all,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Yes, that was a stunning surprise. How devilish cunning the fellow is;\nand how inexplicable his antipathy to us.\"\n\n\"I believe that it is a kind of jealousy,\" I said.\n\n\"A kind of natural cussedness, _I_ guess,\" put in Jack.\n\n\"Why should he be jealous?\" asked Edmund.\n\n\"I don't know, exactly; but you know we are not simple barbarians in\ntheir eyes, and Ingra may have conceived a prejudice against us, somehow,\non that very account.\"\n\n\"Very unlikely,\" Edmund returned, \"but we shall find out all about it in\ntime; in the meanwhile, do nothing to prejudice him further, for he is a\npower that we have got to reckon with.\"\n\nThe conversation then turned upon the mysterious language that had been\nemployed at what we called the trial. I expressed the admiration which I\nhad felt for such a means of communication when I had observed the effect\nthat Juba had been able to produce.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edmund, \"it seems as wonderful as it is beautiful, but there\nis no reason why it should not have been acquired by the inhabitants of\nthe earth. We have the elements, not merely in what we call telepathy, or\nmind reading, but in our everyday converse. Try it yourself, and you will\nbe astonished at what the eyes, the looks, are able to convey. Even\nabstract ideas are not beyond their reach. Often we abandon speech for\nthis better method of conveying our meaning. How many a turn in the\nhistory of mankind has depended upon the unspoken diplomacy of the eyes;\nhow many a crisis in our personal lives is determined, not by words, but\nby looks.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Jack, \"more matches are made with eyes than with\nlips.\"\n\nEdmund smiled and continued: \"There's nothing really mysterious about it.\nIt has a purely physical basis, and only needs attention and development\nto become the most perfect mode of mental communication that intellectual\nbeings could possibly possess.\"\n\n\"And the music and language of color?\" I asked. \"How has that been\ndeveloped?\"\n\n\"As naturally as the silent speech. We have it, and we feel it, in\npictures, in flower gardens, and in landscapes; only with us it is a\nfrozen music. Living music exists on the earth only in the form of\nsonorous vibrations because we have not developed our sense of the\nharmony of colors except when they lie dead and motionless before us. A\ngreat painting by Raphael or Turner is to one of these color hymns of\nVenus like a printed score, which merely suggests its harmonies, compared\nwith the same composition when poured forth from a perfect instrument\nunder the fingers of a master player.\"\n\n\"Well, Edmund,\" interposed Jack, \"I've no doubt it's all as you say, and\nI'd like to know just enough of their speechless speech to tell Ingra\nwhat he ought to hear; and if I understood their music, I'd play him a\ndead march, sure.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Edmund, disregarding Jack's interruption, \"mark me,\nthere's something else behind all this. I have a dim foreglimpse of it,\nand if we have luck, we'll know more before long.\"\n\nI find that the enthusiasm which these wonderful memories arouse, as they\nflood back into my mind, is leading me to dwell upon too many details,\nand I must sum up in fewer words the story of the events which\nimmediately followed our acquittal, although it involves some of the most\nastonishing discoveries that we made in the world of Venus.\n\nAs Edmund had surmised, Ala lost no time in seeking more light upon the\nmystery surrounding us. Within twenty-four hours after the dramatic scene\nin the hall of judgment, we were summoned before her, in a splendid\napartment, which was apparently an audience chamber, where we found her\nsurrounded by several of her female attendants, as well as by what seemed\nto be high officers of the court; and among them, to our displeasure, was\nIngra. He, in fact, appeared to be the most respected and important\npersonage there, next to the queen herself, and he kept close by her\nside. Edmund glanced at him, and half turning to us, shook his head. I\ntook his meaning to be that we were not to manifest any annoyance over\nIngra's presence.\n\nThe queen was very gracious, and seats were offered to us. Immediately\nshe began to question Edmund, as I could see; but with all my efforts I\ncould make out nothing of what was \"said.\" But Juba evidently was able to\nfollow much of the conversation, in which he manifested the liveliest\ninterest. The conference lasted about an hour, and at its conclusion, we\nretired to our apartments. There we eagerly questioned Edmund concerning\nwhat had occurred.\n\nHe seemed to be greatly impressed and pleased. He told us that he had\nlearned more than he had communicated, but that he had succeeded, as he\nbelieved, in making clearer to Ala our celestial origin. Still, he\ndoubted if she fully comprehended it, while as for Ingra, he was sure\nthat the fellow rejected our claim entirely, and persisted in regarding\nus as inhabitants of the dark hemisphere.\n\n\"Bosh!\" cried Jack. \"He's too stupid to understand anything above the\nlevel of his nose, and I'd like to flatten that for him!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Edmund, \"he's not stupid, but I'm afraid he's malicious. If he\nwere a little more stupid, it would be the better for us.\"\n\n\"But does Ala comprehend the difference between us and Juba--I mean in\nregard to origin?\" I asked.\n\n\"I think so. In fact Juba bears unmistakable signs that he is of their\nworld, although so different in physical appearance. His remarkable\ncomprehension of their method of mental communication is alone sufficient\nto stamp him as ancestrally one of them. And yet,\" Edmund continued,\nmusing, \"think of the vast stretch of ages that separates the inhabitants\nof the two sides of this planet, the countless eons of evolution that\nhave brought about the differences now existing! I am delighted to\nfind that Ala has some understanding of all this. She has had good\nteachers--do not smile--for what you have seen of their mechanical\nachievements proves that science exists and is cultivated here; and from\nher savants she has learned--what our astronomers have deduced--that\nformerly Venus turned rapidly on her axis, and had days and nights\nswiftly succeeding one another. But they do not know the scientific\nreasons as completely as we do. With them this is knowledge based largely\nupon tradition, 'ancestral voices' echoing down through periods of time\nso vast that our most ancient legends seem but tales of yesterday.\nWhatever may be the measure of man's antiquity on the earth, I am certain\nthat here intellectual life has existed for millions upon millions of\nyears, and its history stretches back beyond the time when the brake of\ntidal friction had so far destroyed the rotation of the planet that its\nsurface became permanently divided between the reigns of day and night.\"\n\nI listened with amazement and could not help exclaiming:\n\n\"But, Edmund, how could you learn all this in so short a time?\"\n\n\"Because,\" he replied, smiling, \"the language of the mind, unhampered by\ndragging words and blundering sentences, plays back and forth with the\nquickness of thought. There is another thing, too, which I have learned,\na thing so amazing that it daunts me. I have found, I believe, the\nexplanation of that minor note of infinite sadness which, as I told you,\nI always feel, even in the most joyous-seeming paeans of their color\nmusic. I think it is due to their forereaching science, which assures\nthem that this world has entered upon the last stage of its existence\nwhich began with the arrest of its axial rotation, and which will end\nwith the total extinction of life through the evaporation of all the\nwaters under the never-setting sun, and the consequent complete\ndesiccation of this now so beautiful land.\"\n\n\"But,\" I objected, \"you have said that they never see the sun.\"\n\n\"That was, I believe, a mistake, I am sure that they never see the stars\nor the planets, but I think that sometimes they see the sun, or, at least\nthat there is a tradition of its having been seen. The whole thing is yet\nobscure to me, but I have received an inkling of something very, very\nstrange in that regard.\"\n\n\"Then, Ala may think that it is from the sun that we claim to come,\" I\nsaid, disregarding his last remark, which had a significance which even\nhe could not then have appreciated.\n\n\"I am not sure; we must wait for further light. But I have still another\ncommunication not so instinct with mystery. We are to be shown the\nsources of their mechanical power--the means by which they run all their\nmotors.\"\n\n\"Hurrah,\" cried Jack. \"Now, that's something I like! I can understand a\nmachine--if you don't ask me to run it--but as for this talking through\nthe eyes, and playing Jim Crow with rainbows, it's too much for me.\"\n\nIt was not many hours later when we were conducted by Ala, accompanied as\nusual by the inevitable Ingra, and a brilliant cort\u00e8ge of attendants,\nupon our first excursion through the capital. We embarked in a gorgeous\nair ship, and flying low at first, skirted the roofs of the innumerable\nhouses which constituted the bulk of the city resting on the ground. The\noriental magnificence of the views which we caught in the winding streets\nand frequent squares crowded with people, excited our interest to the\nutmost. But we kept on without descending or stopping until, at length,\nwe passed the limits of the immense metropolis, and, flying more rapidly,\nand at a greater elevation, soon approached what, at a distance, appeared\nto be a waterfall, greater than Niagara, pouring out of the air!\n\n\"What marvel can this be?\" I asked.\n\n\"A fountain,\" responded Edmund.\n\n\"A cataract turned upside down,\" exclaimed Jack. \"Well, I've ceased to be\nsurprised at anything I see here. I wouldn't be astonished now to find\nthat their whole old planet was hollow, and full of gnomes, or whatever\nyou call 'em.\"\n\nWhen we got nearer we saw that Edmund's description was substantially\ncorrect. The vast mass of water gushed from the top of a broad plateau,\nin the form of a gigantic vertical fountain, with a roar so stupendous\nthat Ala and her attendants immediately covered their ears with\nprotectors, and we should not have been sorry to follow their example,\nfor our eardrums were almost burst by the billowing force of the sound\nwaves. The water shot upward four or five hundred feet with geyser-like\nplumes reaching a thousand feet, and then descended in floods on all\nsides. But the slope of the ground was such that eventually it was all\ncollected in a river, which flowed away with great swiftness, past the\ndistant city, and disappeared in the direction of the sea from which we\nhad come. The solid column of rising water must have been, at its base,\nthree hundred feet in diameter!\n\nBut our amazement was redoubled when we recognized, at various points of\nvantage, squat, metallic towers of enormous strength, which caught the\ndescending water, allowing it to issue in roaring torrents from their\nbases.\n\n\"Those,\" shouted Edmund in our ears, \"are power houses. I knew already\nthat these people had learned the mechanical uses of electricity; and if\nwe have seen no electric lights as yet, it is because, in a world of\nperpetual daylight, they have little or no use for them. They employ the\npower for other purposes.\"\n\n\"But how do you account for this incredible fountain?\" I asked.\n\n\"It must be due to geological causes, if I may use a terrestrial term.\nYou observe that the land all has a slope hitherward from the distant\nrange of mountains, and that between us and the sea there is a chain of\nhills. The metropolis lies at the lower edge of a vast basin, and it must\nbe that the relatively porous surface, over many thousands of square\nmiles, is underlain by an almost unbroken shell of rock, impermeable to\nwater. The result is that the drainage of this whole immense region,\nafter being collected under ground, flows together to this point, where\nthe existence of a huge vent in the upper layer offers it a way of\nescape, and it comes spouting out of the great crater with the\nconsequences which you behold.\"\n\nMany objections to Edmund's theory occurred to my mind; but he spoke so\nconfidently, the course of things on this strange planet had so often\nfollowed his indications, and I felt myself so incapable of suggesting a\nmore satisfactory hypothesis, that I made no reply, as a geologist,\nperhaps, would have done. At any rate the wonderful phenomenon existed\nbefore our eyes, explanation or no explanation. We learned afterwards\nthat the river formed by the giant fountain passed through a gap in the\nhills to the seaward, and the more I reflected upon Edmund's idea the\nmore acceptable I found it.\n\nA great deal of the water was led away from the foot of the plateau out\nof which the fountain issued by ditches constructed to irrigate the rich\ngardens surrounding the metropolis and the open agricultural country for\nmany miles around. At the queen's invitation, although she did not\naccompany us, we inspected one of the power houses, and Edmund found the\ngreatest delight in studying the details of the enormous dynamos and the\nsystem of cables by which, quite in our own manner, the electric power\nwas conveyed to the city. We noticed that everywhere the most ingenious\ndevices were employed for killing noise.\n\n\"I knew we should find all this,\" said Edmund--\"although I did not\nprecisely anticipate the form that the natural supply of energy would\ntake--as soon as I saw the aerial screws that give buoyancy to the great\ntowers. In fact, I foresaw it as soon as I found, in inspecting the\nmachinery of the air ship which brought us from the sea, that their\nmotors were driven by storage batteries. It was obvious, then, that they\nhad some extraordinary source of energy.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, you knew it all!\" muttered Henry under his breath. \"But\nif you were as omniscient as you think yourself, you'd not be in this\nfool's paradise.\"\n\n\"What's that you're saying?\" demanded Jack, partly catching the import of\nHenry's remark, and beginning to ruffle his feathers.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" mumbled Henry, and I shook my head at Jack to keep quiet.\nWe all felt at times Edmund's assumption of superiority, but Jack and I\nwere willing to put up with it as one of the privileges of genius. If\nEdmund had not believed in himself, he would never have brought us\nthrough. And besides, we always found that he was right, and if he\nsometimes spoke rather boastingly of his knowledge and foresight, at\nleast it was real knowledge and genuine foresight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nWE FALL INTO TROUBLE AGAIN\n\nIt was not long after our visit to the marvelous fountain when Jack\nproposed to me that he and I should make a little excursion on our own\naccount in the city. Edmund was absent at the moment, engaged in some\ninquiries which interested him, under the guidance of Ala and her\ncustomary attendants. I forget why Jack and I had stayed behind, since\nboth Juba and Henry had accompanied Edmund, but it was probably because\nwe wished to make some necessary repairs to our garments for I confess\nthat I shared a little of the coquettishness of Jack in that matter. At\nany rate, we grew weary of being alone, and decided to venture just a\nlittle way in search of adventure. We calculated that the tower of the\npalace, which was so conspicuous, would serve us as a landmark, and that\nthere was no danger of getting lost.\n\nNobody interfered with us at our departure, as we had feared they might,\nand in a short time we had become so absorbed in the strange spectacles\nof the narrow streets, lined with shops and filled with people on foot,\nwhile small air ships continually passed just above the roofs, that we\nforgot the necessity of keeping our landmark constantly in view, and were\nlost without knowing it.\n\nOne thing which immediately struck us was the entire absence of beasts of\nburden--nothing like horses or mules did we see. There were not even\ndogs, although, as I have told you, some canine-like animals dwelt with\nthe people of the caverns. Everybody went either on foot or in air ships.\nThere were no carriages, except a kind of palanquin, some running on\nwheels and others borne by hand.\n\n\"I should think they would have autos,\" said Jack, \"with all their\nscience and ingenuity which Edmund admires so much.\"\n\nBut there was not a sign of anything resembling an auto; the silence of\nthe crowded streets was startling, and made the scene more dreamlike.\nEverybody appeared to be shod with some noise-absorbing material. We\nstrolled along, turning corners with blissful carelessness, staring and\nbeing stared at (for, of course, everybody knew who we were), peering\ninto open doors and the gaping fronts of bazaars, chattering like a\ncouple of boys making their first visit to a city, and becoming every\nmoment more hopelessly, though unconsciously, lost, and more interested\nby what we saw. The astonishing display of pleasing colors and the\nbrilliancy of everything fascinated us. I had never seen anything\ncomparable to this in beauty, variety, and richness. We passed a market\nwhere we saw some of the bright-plumaged birds that we had eaten at our\nfirst repast hung up for sale. They had a way of serving these birds at\ntable with the brilliant feathers of the head and neck still attached, as\nif they found a gratification even at their meals in seeing beautiful\ncolors before them.\n\nOther shops were filled with birds in gilded cages, which we should have\ntaken for songsters but for the fact that, although crowds gathered about\nand regarded them with mute admiration, not a sound issued from their\nthroats--at least we heard none. A palanquin stopped at one of these\nshops, and a lady alighted and bought three beautiful birds which she\ncarried away in their cages, watching them with every indication of the\nutmost pleasure, which we ascribed to the splendor of their plumage and\nthe gracefulness of their forms. As a crowd watched the transaction\nwithout interference on the part of the shopkeeper, or evidence of\nannoyance on that of the lady, we took the liberty of a close look\nourselves. Then we saw their money.\n\n\"Good, yellow gold,\" whispered Jack.\n\nSuch, indeed, it seemed to be. The lady took the money, which consisted\nof slender rings, chased with strange characters, from a golden purse,\nand the whole transaction seemed so familiar that we might well have\nbelieved ourselves to be witnessing a purchase in a bazaar of Cairo or\nDamascus. This scene led to a desire on Jack's part to buy something\nhimself.\n\n\"If I only had some of their money,\" he said, \"I'd like to get some\ncuriosities to carry home. I wonder if they'd accept these?\" and he drew\nfrom his pocket some gold and silver coins.\n\n\"No doubt they'd be glad to have a few as keepsakes,\" I said.\n\n\"By Jo! I think I'll try it,\" said Jack, \"but not here. I'm not a bird\nfancier myself. Let's look a little farther.\"\n\nWe wandered on, getting more and more interested, and followed by a\nthrong of curious natives, who treated us, I must say, much more\nrespectfully than we should have been treated in similar circumstances at\nhome. Many of the things we saw, I cannot describe, because there is\nnothing to liken them to, but all were as beautiful as they were strange.\nAt last we found a shop whose contents struck Jack's fancy. The place\ndiffered from any that we had yet seen; it was much larger, and more\nrichly fitted up than the others, and there were no counters, the things\nthat it contained being displayed on the inner walls, while a single\nkeeper, of a grave aspect, and peculiarly attired, all in black, occupied\na seat at the back. The objects on view were apparently ornaments to be\nhung up, as we hang plaques on the wall. They were of both gold and\nsilver, and in some the two metals were intermixed, with pleasing\neffects. What seemed singular was the fact that the _motif_ of the\nornaments was always the same, although greatly varied in details of\nexecution. As near as I could make it out, the intention appeared to be\nto represent a sunburst. There was invariably a brilliant polished boss\nin the center, sometimes set with a jewel, and surrounding rays of\ncrinkled form, which plunged into a kind of halo that encircled the\nentire work. The idea was commonplace, and it did not occur to me amidst\nmy admiration of the extreme beauty of the workmanship that there was any\ncause for surprise in the finding of a sunburst represented here. Jack\nwas enthusiastic.\n\n\"That's the ticket for me,\" he said. \"How would one of those things look\nhanging over the fireplace of old Olympus? You bet I'm going to persuade\nthe old chap to exchange one for a handful of good solid American money.\"\n\nI happened to glance behind us while Jack was scooping his pocket, and\nwas surprised to see that the crowd of idlers, which had been following\nus, had dispersed. Looking out of the doorway, I saw some of them\nfurtively regarding us from a respectful distance. I twitched Jack by the\nsleeve:\n\n\"See here,\" I said, \"there's some mistake about this. I don't believe\nthat this is a shop. You'd better be careful, or we may make a bad\nbreak.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw!\" he replied; \"it's a shop all right, or if it isn't exactly a\nshop that old duffer will be glad to get a little good money for one of\nhis gimcracks.\"\n\nMy suspicion that all was not right was not allayed when I noticed that\nthe old man, whose complexion differed from the prevailing tone here, and\nwho was specially remarkable by the possession of an eagle-beaked nose, a\npeculiarity that I had not before observed among these people, began to\nfrown as Jack brusquely approached him. But I could not interfere before\nJack had thrown a handful of coin in his lap, and, reaching up, had put\nhis hand upon one of the curious sunbursts, saying:\n\n\"I guess this will suit; what do you say, Peter?\"\n\nInstantly the old fellow sprang to his feet, sending the coins rolling\nover the polished floor, and with eyes ablaze with anger, seized Jack by\nthe throat. I sprang to his aid, but in a second four stout fellows,\ndarting out of invisible corners, grappled us, and before we could make\nany effective resistance, they had our arms firmly bound behind our\nbacks! Jack exerted all his exceptional strength to break loose, but in\nvain.\n\n\"I tried to stop you, Jack--\" I began, in a tone of annoyance, but\nimmediately he cut me off:\n\n\"This is on _me_, Peter; don't you worry. _You_ haven't done anything.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's on all of us,\" I replied. \"The whole party, Edmund and\nall, may have to suffer for our heedlessness.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks,\" he returned. \"I haven't got his old ornament, but he's\ngot my coin. This looks like a skin game to me. What in thunder did he\nhang the things up for if he didn't want to sell 'em?\"\n\n\"But I told you this wasn't a shop.\"\n\n\"No, I see it isn't; it's a trap for suckers, I guess.\"\n\nJack's indignation grew hotter as we were dragged out into the street,\nand followed by a crush of people drawn to the scene, were hurried along,\nwe knew not whither. In fact, his indignation swallowed up the alarm\nwhich he ought to have experienced, and which I felt in full force. I\nbeat my brains in vain to find some explanation for the merciless\nseverity with which we were treated so out of all proportion to the\nvenial fault that had unconsciously been committed, and my perplexity\ngrew when I saw in the faces of the crowd surrounding us, and running to\nkeep up, a look of horror, as if we had been guilty of an unspeakable\ncrime. We were too much hurried and jolted by our captors to address one\nanother, and in a short time we were widely separated, Jack being led, or\nrather dragged, ahead, as if to prevent any communication between us.\nOnce in a while, to my regret, I observed him exerting all his force to\nbreak his bonds and slinging his custodians about; but he could not get\naway, and at last, to my infinite comfort, he ceased to struggle, and\nwent along as quietly as the rapid pace would permit.\n\nPresently an air ship swooped down from above, and alighted in a little\nsquare which we had just entered. Immediately we were taken aboard, with\nsmall regard to our comfort, and the air ship rose rapidly, and bore off\nin the direction of the great tower of the palace which we could now see.\nUpon our arrival we were taken through the inevitable labyrinth of\ncorridors, and finally found ourselves in a place that was entirely new\nto us.\n\nIt was a round chamber, perhaps two hundred feet in diameter, lighted,\nlike the Roman Pantheon, by a huge circular opening in the vaulted roof,\nthrough which I caught a glimpse of the pearl-tinted cloud dome, which\nseemed infinitely remote. No opposition was made when I pushed ahead in\norder to be at Jack's side, and as a throng quickly hedged us round, our\nconductors released their hold, although our arms remained bound. When at\nlast we stood fast we were in front of a rich dais, containing a\nthronelike seat occupied by a personage attired in black, the first\nglimpse of whose face gave me such a shock as I had not experienced since\nthe priest of the earth-worshipers seized me for his prey. I have never\nseen anything remotely resembling that face. It was without beard, and of\na ghastly paleness. It was seen only in profile, except when, with a\nlightning-like movement, it turned, for the fraction of a second, toward\nus, and was instantly averted again. It made my nerves creep to look at\nit. The nose was immense, resembling a huge curved beak, and the eyes, as\nblack and glittering as jet, were roofed with shaggy brows, and seemed\ncapable of seeing crosswise.\n\nSometimes one side of the face and sometimes the other was presented, the\ntransition being effected by two instantaneous jerks, with a slight pause\nbetween, during which the terrible eyes transfixed us. At such moments\nthe creature--though he bore the form of a man--seemed to project his\ndreadful countenance toward the object of his inspection like a monstrous\nbird stretching forth its neck toward its prey. The effect was\nindescribable, terrifying, paralyzing! The eyes glowed like fanned\nembers.\n\n\"In God's name,\" gasped Jack, leaning his trembling shoulder upon me,\n\"what is it?\"\n\nI was, perhaps, more unmanned than he, and could make no reply.\n\nThen there was a movement in the throng surrounding us, and the old man\nof the sunbursts appeared before the throne, and, after dropping on his\nknees and rising again, indicated us with his long finger, and, as was\nplain, made some serious accusation. The face turned upon us again with a\nlonger gaze than usual, and we literally shrank from it. Then its owner\nrose from his seat, towering up, it seemed, to a height of full seven\nfeet, shot his hand out with a gesture of condemnation, and instantly sat\ndown again and averted his countenance. There seemed to have been a world\nof meaning in this brief act to those who could comprehend it. We were\nseized, even more roughly than before, and dragged from the chamber, and\nat the end of a few minutes found ourselves thrown into a dungeon, where\nthere was not the slightest glimmer of light, and the door was locked\nupon us.\n\nIt was a long time before either of us summoned up the courage to speak.\nAt length I said faintly:\n\n\"Jack, I'm afraid it's all over with us. We must have done something\nterrible, though I cannot imagine what it was.\"\n\nBut Jack, after his manner, was already recovering his spirits, and he\nreplied stoutly:\n\n\"Nonsense, Peter, we're all right, as Edmund says. Wait till he comes and\nhe'll fix it.\"\n\n\"But how can he know what has happened? And what could he do if he did?\nMore likely they will all be condemned along with us.\"\n\nJack felt around in the dark and got me by the hand, giving it a hearty\npressure.\n\n\"Remember Ala,\" he said. \"She's our friend, or Edmund's, and they'll\nbring us out of this. You want to brace up.\"\n\n\"Remember Ingra!\" I responded with a shiver, and I could feel Jack start\nat the words.\n\n\"Hang him!\" he muttered. \"If I'd only finished him when I had the drop!\"\n\nAfter that neither spoke. If Jack's thoughts were blacker than mine he\nmust have wished for his pistol to blow out his own brains. At no time\nsince our arrival on the planet had I felt so depressed. I had no courage\nleft; could see no lightening of the gloom anywhere. In the horror of the\ndarkness which enveloped us, the _horror of space_ came over my spirit.\nOne feels a little of that sometimes when the breadth of an ocean\nseparates him from home, and from all who really care for him--but what\nis the Atlantic or the Pacific to millions upon millions of leagues of\ninterplanetary space! To be cast away among the inhabitants of another\nworld than one's own! To have lost, as we had done (for in that moment of\ndespair I was _sure_ Edmund could never repair the car), the only\npossible means of return! To have offended, just _because_ we were\nstrangers, and _could_ not know better, some incomprehensible social law\nof this strange people, who owned not a drop of the blood of our race, or\nof any race whatsoever dwelling on the earth! To lie under the\ncondemnation of that goblin face, without the possibility of pleading\neven the mercy that our hearts instinctively grant to the smallest mite\nof fellow life on our own planet! To be alone! friendless! forsaken!\ncondemned!--in a far-off, kinless world! I could have fallen down in\nidolatry before a grain of sand from the shore of the Atlantic!\n\nIn the murkiest depth of my despair a sound roused me with a shock that\nmade my heart ache. In a moment the door opened, light streamed in, and\nEdmund stood there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nTHE SUN GOD\n\nStrangely enough, I, who have an exceptional memory for spoken words,\ncannot, by any effort, recall what Edmund said, as his face beamed in\nupon us. I have only a confused recollection that he spoke, and that his\nwords had a marvelous effect upon my broken spirit. But I can see, as if\nit were yet before me, the smile that illumined his features. My heart\nbounded with joy, as if a messenger had come straight from the earth\nitself, bearing a reprieve whose authority could not be called in\nquestion.\n\nJack's joy was no less than mine, although he had not suffered mentally\nas I had done. And the sight of Ala was hardly less reassuring to us, but\nto find Ingra, too, present was somewhat of a shock to our confidence in\nspeedy delivery from trouble. And, in fact, we were not at once\ndelivered. We had to spend many weary hours yet in our dark prison, but\nthey were rendered less gloomy by Edmund's assurance that he would save\nus. The confidence that he always inspired seems to me to have been\nanother mark of his genius. We had an instinct that he could do in any\ncircumstances what was impossible to ordinary men.\n\nAt last the welcome moment came, and we were led forth, free, and\nrejoined Edmund, Henry, and Juba in our apartments. Then, for the first,\nwe learned what we had done, and how narrow had been our escape from a\nterrible doom. It was a new chapter of wonder that Edmund opened before\nus. I shall tell it in his own words.\n\n\"When I returned to the palace and found you missing I was greatly\nwrought up. Immediately I applied to Ala for aid in finding you. She was\nquickly informed of all the circumstances of your arrest, and I saw at\nonce, by the expression of her features, that it was a matter of the\nutmost gravity. I was not reassured by Ingra's evident joy. I could read\nin his face the pleasure that the news gave him, and I perceived that\nthere was again opposition between him and Ala, and that she was trying,\nwith less success than I hoped for, to bring him round to her view.\n\n\"With no little trouble I finally discovered the nature of your offense.\nI understood it the more readily because I had already begun to suspect\nthe existence among these people of a strange form of idolatry, in some\nrespects akin to the earth-worship of the cavern dwellers. I have told\nyou that certain things had led me to think that they occasionally see\nthe sun here. It is a phenomenon of excessive rarity, and whole\ngenerations sometimes pass without its recurrence. It is due to an\nopening which at irregular periods forms for a brief space of time in the\ncloud dome. I imagine that it may be in some way connected with sunspots,\nbut here they have no notion of its cause, and look upon it as entirely\nmiraculous.\n\n\"Whenever this rare event occurs it gives rise to extraordinary religious\nexcitement, and ceremonies concerning which there is some occult mystery\nthat I have not yet penetrated. I suspect that the ceremonies are not\naltogether unlike the Bacchanalian festivals of ancient Greece. At any\nrate the momentary appearance of the sun at these times is regarded as\nthe avatar of a supreme god, and their whole religious system is based\nupon it. So universal and profound is the superstition to which it gives\nrise that the most instructed persons among them are completely under its\ndominion. The eagle-beaked individual who condemned you, and whom I have\nsince seen, is the chief priest of this superstition, and within his\nsphere his power is unlimited. It is solely to the belief--which, through\nAla, I have succeeded in impressing upon him--that we are _children of\nthe sun_ that I owe the success of my efforts in your behalf. Without\nthat you would surely have been sacrificed, and we with you.\n\n\"One of the forms which this superstition takes is a belief that the\nanger of the sun god can be mollified by offerings of images, made in his\nlikeness, which are first consecrated by the chief priest, and then hung\nup on the walls of certain small temples, which are scattered through the\ncity, and are always kept open to the air under the guard of a minor\npriest and his attendants. A whole family, as I understand it, deems\nitself protected by one of these images, which are made by artists who\nnever touch any other work, and which are only granted to those who have\nundergone a painful series of purifications in the great temple. The\npreliminary ceremonies finished, the images are suspended, and at certain\ntimes those to whom they belong go and kneel and pray before them, as\nbefore their guardian saints.\"\n\n\"What a fool I was not to understand it,\" I murmured.\n\n\"You will understand now,\" Edmund continued, \"how serious was Jack's\noffense in insulting a priest, and laying impious hands upon a sacred\nimage, belonging, no doubt, to a family whose antiquity of descent would\nmake our oldest pedigrees on the earth seem as ephemeral as the existence\nof a May fly; for I am convinced that here life has gone on,\nuninterrupted by wars and changes of dynasty, for untold ages.\n\n\"It is a marvel that you escaped, for already they were preparing the\nawful sacrifice. The chief priest was amazed when an interposition was\nmade on your behalf. Such a thing had never been known, and, as I have\nsaid, it was only by acting upon his superstition that I succeeded, with\nAla's assistance, in obtaining a reprieve. As the case stands, we find\nourselves occupying a dangerous eminence, which it may be difficult for\nus to maintain. I must beseech you to be on your guard, and to act only\nunder my direction. It is all the more serious for us because I am\nconvinced that Ingra has no faith whatever in the legend which protects\nus. He persists in believing that we are simply interlopers from the dark\nhemisphere, and the opposition between him and Ala has now become so\nsharp that he would gladly witness our destruction. I am sure that he\nwill do his utmost to unmask us, and thus send us to our death.\"\n\n\"But--\" I began.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Edmund, \"I have not yet finished. I must now tell\nyou who Ingra is. _He is the destined consort of Ala._ That explains his\ninfluence over her. From what I can make out, it appears that he is of\nthe royal blood, and that the marriage of the queen is arranged, not by\nher preference, but by an unwritten law, administered by the chief\npriest. She has no choice in the matter.\"\n\n\"I should say not,\" broke in Jack. \"She never would have chosen that\njackanapes! If you hadn't spoiled my aim I'd have relieved her of the\nburden.\"\n\n\"Not another word of that!\" said Edmund severely. \"In no manner, not even\nby a look, are you ever to express your dislike of him. And remember, you\nmust govern your very thoughts, for here they lie open, as legible as\nprint.\"\n\n\"Hang me,\" growled Jack, \"if I like a world where a man can't even think\nhis own thoughts because his mind goes bare! Take me back where you have\nto speak before you are understood.\"\n\n\"When you have wicked thoughts don't look them in the eyes,\" said Edmund,\nhalf smiling, \"and then you will run no danger. It is through the eyes\nthat they read. Now, to resume what I was saying, I am more than ever\nanxious to recover the car, and to find the materials that will enable me\nto repair its machinery. With it in our possession, and in good shape, we\nshall be in a position to run away whenever it may seem necessary to do\nso, and in the meantime to impose our legend upon them by the possession\nof so apparently miraculous a means of conveying ourselves through space.\nIt will be overwhelming proof of the truth of our assertion of an origin\noutside their world, and perhaps, upon the whole, it is just as well that\nthey should think that we belong to the sun, of whose existence they have\nsome knowledge, rather than to the earth, of which they know nothing, in\nspite of the inkling that Juba succeeded in conveying to them.\"\n\n\"The car is here, isn't it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, it is in the great tower, but it is useless in its present\ncondition.\"\n\n\"And what materials do you want to find?\"\n\n\"Primarily nothing but uranium. They understand chemistry here. They have\nthe apparatus that I need, but they do not know how to use it as I do.\nThe uranium certainly exists somewhere. They mine gold and silver, and\nother things, and when I can find their mines, without exciting their\nsuspicion, and can get the use of a laboratory in secret, I shall soon\nhave what I need. But I must be very circumspect, for it would not do to\nlet them perceive that chemistry really lies at the basis of our miracle.\nIt is this necessity for secrecy which troubles me most. But I shall find\na way.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, find it quick,\" Henry burst out. \"And then get away from\nthis accursed planet.\"\n\nEdmund looked at him a moment before replying:\n\n\"We shall go when the necessity for going arises, and not before. We have\nnot yet seen all the interesting things of this world.\"\n\nI believe that even Jack and I shared to some extent Henry's\ndisappointment on hearing this announcement. We should have been glad to\nknow that we were to start on the return journey as soon as the car was\nin shape to transport us. But the event proved that Edmund's instinct\nwas, as usual, right, and that the things which were yet to be seen and\nexperienced were well worth the fearful risk we ran in remaining.\n\nWhile Edmund undertook the delicate inquiries which were necessary in\norder to determine the direction that his search for uranium should take,\nand to enable him to conduct his chemical processes without awaking\nsuspicion as to his real purpose, we were left much of the time in charge\nof a party of attendants who, by his intercession, had been selected to\nact as our guides when we wished to examine the wonders of the palace and\nthe capital. Sometimes he accompanied us; but more often he was with Ala\nand her suite, including her uneludable satellite, Ingra.\n\n\"I bless my stars that he doesn't favor _us_ with his delightful\ncompany,\" was Jack's comment, when he saw Ingra tagging along after Ala\nand Edmund.\n\nI privately believed that Ingra had his spies among our attendants, but I\nwas careful not to mention my suspicions to Jack.\n\nBut, oh, the delight of those excursions! Those streets; and those aerial\ntowers, which rose like forests of coral in a gulf of liquid ether! They\nshine often in my dreams. A thousand times I have tried to put into\nwords, simply for my own satisfaction, a description of the things that\nwe saw, and the impressions that they made on my mind--but it is\nimpossible. I understand now why the tales of travelers into strange\nlands never convey a tithe of what is in the writers' minds; they\nsimply cannot; the necessary words and analogies do not exist. I can only\nuse general terms, ransacking the vocabulary of adjectives--\"beautiful,\"\n\"wonderful,\" \"fascinating,\" \"marvelous,\" \"indescribable,\" \"magical,\"\n\"enchanting,\" \"amazing,\" \"inexplicable,\" \"_sans pareil_\"--what you\nwill--but all that says nothing except to my own mind. Only the language\nof Venus could describe the charms and the wonders of Venus!\n\nThere was one thing, however, which was sufficiently comprehensible--_the\ngreat library_. Edmund was not with us when we paid our first visit to\nit; but he had predicted its existence during one of our conversations,\nwhen we were talking of the silent language.\n\n\"This people,\" he had said, \"has a great history behind it, extending\nover periods which would amaze our disinterrers of human antiquity, but\nan intelligent race cannot make history without also keeping records of\nit. Tradition alone, handed on from mind to mind, would not answer their\nrequirements. The possession of the power to communicate thought without\nspoken language does not presuppose a power of memory any more perfect\nthan we have. The brain forgets, the imagination misleads, with them as\nwith us, and consequently they must have books of some kind--which\nimplies a written or printed language. It is probable that this language\ndoes not correspond with the very meager one of which we occasionally\nhear them pronounce a few words. The latter is, I am convinced, used only\nfor names and interjections, and sometimes to call the attention of the\nperson addressed, while the former must be a rich and carefully\nelaborated system of literary expression, which may not be phonetic at\nall. We shall find that this is so; and there are unquestionably\nlibraries--probably a great imperial library--devoted to history and\nscience. There must be schools also.\"\n\nThus Edmund had spoken, and thus we found it to be. The great library was\nin a building separate from the palace. It was admirably lighted from\nwithout, and its nature was apparent the moment we were led into it. The\n\"books\" were long scrolls, which might have been taken for parchment or\npapyrus, and the characters written on them resembled those of the\nChinese language, but worked out in exquisite colors, which might\nthemselves have had a meaning. The rolls were kept in proper receptacles\nunder the charge of librarians, and we saw many grave persons at desks\nporing over them. Absolute silence reigned, and as I gazed at the scene I\nfound admiration for this extraordinary people taking the place of the\nprejudice which I had recently been led to feel against them.\n\nJack, unusually impressed, whispered to me that Edmund must have been\nplaying us some Hindoo bedevilment trick, for he could not believe that\nwe were actually in a foreign world. The same impression came over me.\nThis was too earthlike; too much as if, instead of being on the planet\nVenus, we had been transported to some land of antique civilization in\nour own world. But, after all, we _knew where we were_, and as the\nrealization of that fact came to us we could only stare with increasing\nastonishment at the scene before us. I may say here that Edmund\nsubsequently visited this great library, and also some of the schools,\nand I know that he made notes of what he discovered and learned in them,\nwith the purpose, as I supposed, of writing upon the subject after his\nreturn. But the expected book, which would have supplemented and\nclarified much of what I have undertaken to tell, with but a half\nunderstanding of what we saw, never appeared.\n\nOur wonderful excursions came to an end when Edmund at length announced\nthat he had obtained the information he needed, and that we were about to\nmake a trip to some of the mines of Venus.\n\n\"I have discovered,\" he said, \"that Venus is exceedingly rich in the\nprecious metals, as well as in iron and lead. They mine them all, and\nwe shall visit the mines under Ala's escort. My real purpose, of\ncourse, is to find uranium, of whose properties, strangely--and for us\nluckily--enough, they seem to have no knowledge. Nevertheless, they are\ncapital chemists as far as they go, and possess laboratories provided\nwith all that I shall need. They refine the metals at the mines\nthemselves, so that I am sure of finding everything necessary to do my\nwork right on the ground. The substance which I obtain from uranium is so\nconcentrated that I can carry in my pocket all that will be required to\nrepair the damage done to the transformers in the car. A careful\nexamination, which I have made of the car, proves that the terrific\nshocks the machinery suffered in the crystal mountains caused an atomic\nreadjustment which destroyed the usefulness of the material in the\ntransformers, and while I might, by laboratory treatment, possibly\nrestore its properties, I think it safer to obtain an entirely fresh\nsupply. We shall start with the queen's ship within a few hours; so you\nhad better make your preparations at once.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nAT THE MERCY OF FEARFUL ENEMIES\n\nIf we could have foreseen what was to happen during this trip, even\nEdmund, I believe, would have shrunk from undertaking it. But we all\nembarked upon it gladly, because we had conceived the highest\nexpectations of the delight that it would afford us; and at the news that\nwe were to visit mines of gold richer than any on the earth, Henry\nexhibited the first enthusiasm that he had shown since our departure from\nhome.\n\nEmbarked on Ala's splendid \"yacht,\" as Jack called it, and attended by\nher usual companions, we rapidly left the city behind, and sped away\ntoward the purple mountains, so often seen in the distance. The voyage\nwas a long one, but at length we drew near the foothills, and beheld the\nmountains towering into peaks behind. Lofty as they looked, there was no\nsnow on their summits. We now descended where plumes of smoke had for\nsome time attracted our attention, and found ourselves at one of the\nmines. It was a gold mine. The processes of extracting the ore,\nseparating the metal, etc., were conducted with remarkable silence, but\nthey showed a knowledge of metallurgy that would have amazed us if we had\nnot already seen so much of the capacity of this people. Yet similarly to\nthe scene in the library, its earth-likeness was startling.\n\n\"This sort of thing is uncanny,\" said Jack, as we were led through the\nworks. \"It makes me creep to see them doing things just as we do them at\nhome, except that they are so quiet about it. If everything was different\nfrom our ways it would seem more natural.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" I replied, \"we may take it as a great compliment to ourselves,\nfor it shows that we have found out ways of doing things which cannot be\nimproved even in Venus.\"\n\nI should like to describe in detail the wonders of this mine, but I have\nspace for only a few words about it. It was, Edmund learned, the richest\non the planet, and was the exclusive property of the government,\nfurnishing the larger part of its revenues, which were not comparable\nwith those of a great terrestrial nation because of the absence of all\nthe expenditures required by war. No fleets and no armies existed here,\nand no tariffs were needed where commerce was free. This great mine was\nthe Laurium of Venus. The display of gold in the vaults connected with it\nexceeded a hundredfold all that the most imaginative historian has ever\nwritten of the treasures of Montezuma and Atahualpa. Henry's eyes fairly\nshone as he gazed upon it, and he could not help saying to Edmund:\n\n\"You might have had riches equal to this if you had stayed at home and\ndeveloped your discovery.\"\n\nEdmund contemptuously shrugged his shoulders, and turned away without a\nword.\n\nWe were afterwards conducted to a silver mine, which we also inspected,\nand finally to a lead mine in another part of the hills. This was in\nreality the goal at which Edmund had been aiming, for he had told us that\nuranium was sometimes found in association with lead. Our joy was very\ngreat when, after a long inspection, he informed us that he had\ndiscovered uranium, and that it now remained only to submit it to certain\noperations in a laboratory in order to prepare the substance that was to\ngive renewed life to those lilliputian monsters in the car, which fed\nupon men's breath and begot power illimitable.\n\n\"I must now contrive,\" said Edmund, \"to get admission to the laboratory\nconnected with the mine, and to do my work without letting them suspect\nwhat I am about.\"\n\nHe managed it somehow, as he managed all things that he undertook, and\nwithin forty-eight hours after our arrival he was hard at work, evidently\nexciting the admiration of the native chemists by the knowledge and skill\nwhich he displayed. At first they crowded around him so that he was\nhampered in his efforts to conceal the real object of his labors; but at\nlast they left him comparatively alone, and I could see by his expression\nwhenever I visited the laboratory that things were going to his liking.\nBut the work was long and delicate. Edmund had to fabricate secretly some\nof the chemical apparatus he needed, destroying it as fast as it served\nits purpose, so that weeks of time rolled by before he had what he called\nthe \"thimbleful of omnipotence\" that was to make us masters of our fate.\nAs fast as he produced it he put it in a metal box, shaped like a\nsnuffbox, and covertly he showed it to us. It consisted of brilliant\nblack grains, finer than millet seeds.\n\n\"Every one of those minute grains,\" he told us, \"is packed with as much\npotential energy as that of a ton's weight suspended a mile above the\nearth.\"\n\nBut while the little box was being gradually filled with crystallized\npowder, we, who could lend no aid in the fabrication of Edmund's miracle,\nimproved the opportunity to make acquaintance with the beauties of the\nsurrounding country. Ala had returned to the capital, leaving an air ship\nat our disposal, and, of all persons in the world, _Ingra in command_! We\nrefused all invitations to accompany him in the air ship, preferring to\nmake our excursions on foot, accompanied at first by some of the\nattendants that Ala had left. Edmund did not share our fears that Ingra\nmeditated mischief.\n\n\"He doesn't dare,\" was his reply to all our representations. But nothing\ncould induce Jack and me to trust to Ingra's tender mercies.\n\nAmong the favorite spots which we had found to visit in the neighborhood\nof the mine was a little knoll crowned with a group of the most beautiful\ntrees that I ever saw, and washed at its base by a brook of exquisitely\ntransparent water which tinkled over a bed of white and clear-yellow\npebbles, sparkling like jewels. More than once at the beginning I fished\nsome of them out in the belief that they were nuggets of pure gold\npolished by the water. In a pool under the translucent shadow of the\noverhanging trees played small fish so splendid in their varied hues that\nthey looked like miniature rainbows darting about beneath the water.\nBirds of vivid color sometimes flitted among the branches overhead. There\nwas but one \"rainy day\" while we were at the mine; all the rest of the\ntime not a cloud appeared under the great dome, and a scented zephyr\ncontinually drew down from the mountains and fanned us. Here, then, we\npassed many hours and many days, chatting of our adventures and our\nchances, drowsily happy in the pure physical enjoyment which this\ncharming spot afforded.\n\nWhen at last Edmund informed us that his box was full, and he was ready\nto return to the capital, we would not let him go without first\nconducting him to our little paradise. All together, then, with the\nexception of Juba, who, by some interference of an overlooking\nprovidence, was left at the mine, we set out in the highest spirits to be\nfor once our leader's leaders in the exploration of some of the charms of\nVenus. Edmund was no less delighted than we had been with the place, and\nyielding to its somnolent influences we were soon stretched side by side\non the spreading roots of a giant tree, and sleeping the sleep of\nsensuous languor.\n\nOur waking was as terrible as it was sudden. I heard a cry, and at the\nsame instant felt an irresistible hand grasping me by the throat. As I\nopened my eyes I saw that the whole party were prisoners. Nearby an air\nship was quivering, as, held in leash, it lightly touched the ground; and\na dozen gigantic fellows, whipping our hands behind our backs, hurried us\naboard, the great mechanical bird, which instantly rose, describing a\ncircle that carried us above the treetops. I did not try to struggle, for\nI felt how vain would be any effort that I could make.\n\nGlancing about me, the very first features I recognized were those of\nIngra. At last he had us in his power!\n\nI looked at Edmund, but his face was set in thought, and he did not\nreturn my glance. Henry, as usual, had plunged into silent hopelessness,\nand Jack was a picture of mingled rage and despair. Although we were\nloosely fastened side by side to a rail on the deck, neither of us spoke\nfor perhaps half an hour. In the meantime the air ship rose to a height\ngreater than that of the nearby mountains, and then more slowly\napproached them. At last it began to circle, as if an uncertainty\nconcerning the route to be chosen had arisen, and I observed, for we\ncould look all about in spite of our bonds, that Ingra and one who\nappeared to be his lieutenant were engaged in an animated discussion.\nThey pointed this way and that, and the debate grew every moment more\nearnest. This continued for a long time, while the ship hovered, running\nslowly in the wide circles. We could not then know how much this\nhesitation meant for us. If Ingra had been as rapid in his decision now\nas he was in the act of taking us prisoners, this history would never\nhave been written. I watched Edmund, and saw that his attention was\nabsorbed by what our captors were about, and even in that emergency I\nfelt a touch of comfort through my unfailing confidence in our leader.\n\nFinally a decision seemed to have been reached, and we set off over the\ncrest of the range. As its huge peaks towered behind us and we descended\nnearer the ground, my heart sank again, for now we were cut off from the\nworld beyond, and in the improbable event of any pursuit, how could the\npursuers know what course we had taken, or where to look for us? And,\nthen, who would pursue? Juba could do nothing, Ala was far away at the\ncapital, even supposing that she should be disposed to set out in search\nof us, and hours, perhaps days, must elapse before she could be informed\nof what had happened. Not even when Jack and I were in the dungeon had\nour case seemed so desperate.\n\nBut how the gods repent when they have sunk men in the blackest pit of\ndespair, sending them a messenger of hope to steady their hearts!\n\nGood fortune had willed that we should be so placed upon the deck that we\nfaced most easily sternward. Suddenly, as I gazed despondently at the\nserrated horizon receding in the distance, a thrill ran through my nerves\nat the sight of a dark speck in the sky, which seemed to float over one\nof the highest peaks. A second look assured me that it was moving; a\nthird gave birth to the wild thought that it was in chase. Then I turned\nto Edmund and whispered:\n\n\"There is something coming behind us.\"\n\n\"Very well, do nothing to attract attention,\" he returned. \"I have seen\nit. They are following us.\"\n\nI said nothing to Jack or Henry, who had not yet caught sight of the\nobject; but I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Sometimes I persuaded\nmyself that it was growing larger, and then, with the intensity of my\ngaze, it blurred and seemed to fade. At last Jack spied it, and\ninstantly, in his impetuous way, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Edmund! Look there!\"\n\nHis voice drew Ingra's attention, and immediately the latter observed the\ndirection of our glances, and himself saw the growing speck. He turned\nwith flushed face to his lieutenant and in a trice the vessel began\nfairly to leap through the air.\n\n\"Ah, Jack,\" said Edmund reproachfully, but yet kindly, \"if only you could\nalways think before you speak! It is certain from Ingra's alarm that we\nare pursued by somebody whom he does not wish to meet. Most likely it is\nthe queen, although it seems impossible that she could so quickly have\nlearned of our mishap. Peter and I have been watching that object, which\nis unquestionably an air ship, in silence for the last twenty minutes,\nduring which it has perceptibly gained upon us. But for your lack of\ncaution it might have come within winning distance before it was\ndiscovered by Ingra, but now--\"\n\nThe rebuke was deserved, perhaps, but yet I wished that Edmund had not\ngiven it, so painful was the impression that it made upon Jack's\ngenerous heart. His countenance was convulsed, and a tear rolled down his\ncheek--all the more pitiful to see because his arms were pinioned, and he\ncould do nothing to conceal his agitation. Edmund was stricken with\nremorse when he saw the effect of his words.\n\n\"Jack,\" he said, \"forgive me; I am sorry from the bottom of my heart. I\nshould not have blamed you for a little oversight, when I alone am to\nblame for the misfortunes of us all.\"\n\n\"All right, Edmund, all right,\" returned Jack in his usual cheerful\ntones. \"But, see here, I don't admit that you are to blame for anything.\nWe're all in this boat together and hanged if we won't get out of it\ntogether, too, and you'll be the man to fetch us out.\"\n\nEdmund smiled sadly, and shook his head.\n\nMeanwhile Ingra, with the evident intention of concealing the movements\nof the vessel, dropped her so low that we hardly skipped the tops of the\ntrees that we were passing over, for now we had entered a wide region of\nunbroken forest. Still that black dot followed straight in our wake, and\nI easily persuaded myself that it was yet growing larger. Edmund declared\nthat I was right, and expressed his surprise, for we were now flying at\nthe greatest speed that could be coaxed out of the motors. Suddenly a\nshocking thought crossed my mind. I tried to banish it, fearing that\nIngra might read it in my eyes, and act upon it. Suppose that he should\nhurl us overboard! It was in his power to do so, and it seemed a quick\nand final solution. But he showed no intention to do anything of the\nkind. He may have had good reasons for refraining, but, at the time I\ncould only ascribe his failure to take a summary way out of his\ndifficulty to a protecting hand which guarded us even in this extremity.\n\nOn we rushed through the humming air, and still the pursuing speck chased\nus. And minute by minute it became more distinct against the background\nof the great cloud dome. Presently Edmund called our attention to\nsomething ahead.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"is Ingra's hope and our despair.\"\n\nI turned my head and saw that in front the sky was very dark. Vast clouds\nseemed to be rolling up and obscuring the dome. Already there was a\ntwilight gloom gathering about us.\n\n\"This,\" said Edmund, \"is apparently the edge of what we may call the\ntemperate zone, which must be very narrow, surrounding in a circle the\ngreat central region that lies under the almost vertical sun. The clouds\nahead indicate the location of a belt of contending air currents,\nresembling that which we crossed after floating out of the crystal\nmountains. Having entered them, we shall be behind a curtain where our\nenemy can work his will with us.\"\n\nWas it knowledge of this fact which had restrained Ingra from throwing us\noverboard? Was he meditating for us a more dreadful fate?\n\nIt was, indeed, a land of shadow which we now began to enter, and we\ncould see that ahead of us the general inclination of the ground was\ndownward. I eagerly glanced back to see if the pursuers were yet in\nsight. Yes! There was the speck, grown so large now that there could be\nno doubt that it was an air ship, driven at its highest speed. But we had\nentered so far under the curtain that the greater part of the dome was\nconcealed, the inky clouds hanging like a penthouse roof far behind. We\ncould plainly perceive the chasers; but could they see us? I tried to\nhope that they could, but reason was against it. Still they were\nevidently holding the course.\n\nBut even this hope faded when Ingra cunningly changed our course, turning\nabruptly to the left in the gloom. He knew, then, that we were invisible\nto the pursuers. But not content with one change, he doubled like a\nhunted fox. We watched for the effect of these maneuvers upon those\nbehind us, and to our intense disappointment, though not to our surprise,\nwe saw that they were continuing straight ahead. They surely could not\nhave seen us, and even if they anticipated Ingra's ruse, how could they\nbaffle it, and find our track again? At last the spreading darkness\nswallowed up the arc of illuminated sky behind, and then we were alone in\nthe gloom.\n\nThis, you will understand, was not the deep night of the other side of\nthe planet; it was rather a dusky twilight, and as our eyes became\naccustomed to it, we could begin to discern something of the character of\nour surroundings. We flew within a hundred yards of the ground, which\nappeared to be perfectly flat, and soon we were convinced by the\npitchy-black patches which frequently interrupted the continuity of the\numbrageous surface beneath, that it was sprinkled with small bodies of\nwater--in short, a gigantic Dismal Swamp, or Everglade. I need hardly say\nthat it was Edmund who first drew this inference, and when its full\nmeaning burst upon my mind I shuddered at the hellish design which Ingra\nevidently entertained. Plainly, he meant to throw us into the morass,\neither to drown in the foul water, whose miasma now assailed our\nnostrils, or to starve amidst the fens! But his real intention, as you\nwill perceive in a little while, was yet more diabolical.\n\nThe bird ship stooped lower, just skimming the tops of strange trees, the\nmost horrible vegetable forms that I have ever beheld. And then, without\nwarning, we were seized and pushed overboard, while the vessel, making a\nbroad swoop, quickly disappeared. Henry alone uttered a loud cry as we\nfell.\n\nWe crashed through the clammy branches and landed close together in a\nswamp. Fortunately the water was not deep, and we were able to struggle\nupon our feet and make our way to a comparatively dry open place, perhaps\nhalf an acre in extent. No sooner were we all safe on the land than I\nnoticed Edmund struggling violently and then he exclaimed:\n\n\"Here, quick! Hold a hand here!\"\n\nAs he spoke he backed up to me.\n\n\"Take a match from this box which I have twisted out of my pocket, and\nwhile I hold the box, scratch it, and hold the flame against the bonds\naround my wrists.\"\n\nI managed to get out a match, and scratched it. But the match broke.\nEdmund, with the skill of a prestidigitator, got out another match, and\npushed it into my fingers. It failed again.\n\n\"It's got to be done!\" he said. \"Here, Jack, you try.\"\n\nAgain he extracted a match, as Jack backed up in my place. Whether his\nhands happened to be less tightly bound, or whether luck favored him,\nJack, on a second attempt, succeeded in illuminating a match.\n\n\"Don't lose it,\" urged Edmund, as the light flashed out; \"burn the cord.\"\n\nJack tried. The smell of burning flesh arose, but Edmund did not wince.\nIn a few seconds the match went out.\n\n\"Another!\" said Edmund, and the operation was repeated. A dozen separate\nattempts of this kind had been made, and I believe that I felt the pain\ninflicted by them more than Edmund did, when, making a tremendous effort,\nhe burst the charred cord. His hands and wrists must have been fearfully\nburned, but he paid no attention to that. In a flash he had out his knife\nand cut us all loose. It was a mercy that they had not noticed the flame\nof the matches from the air ship, for if they had, unquestionably Ingra\nwould have returned and made an end of us.\n\nAfter our release we stood a few moments in silence, awaiting our\nleader's next move. Presently a sonorous sign startled us, followed by a\nsticky, tramping sound.\n\n\"In God's name, what's that?\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n[Illustration: \"It curled itself over the edge of the hovering air ship\nand drew it down.\"]\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Edmund quietly, and threw open his pocket lantern.\n\nAs the light streamed out there was a rustle in the branches above us,\nand the form of an air ship pushed into view.\n\nIngra!\n\nNo, it was not Ingra! Thank God, there was the bushy head of Juba visible\non the deck as the ship drifted over us! And near him stood Ala and a\nhalf dozen attendants.\n\nAs one man we shouted, but the sound had not ceased to echo when, out of\nthe horrible tangle about us, rose, with a swift, sinuous motion, a\nmonstrous anacondalike arm, flesh pink in the electric beam, but covered\nwith spike-edged spiracles! It curled itself over the edge of the\nhovering air ship and drew it down.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nDREADFUL CREATURES OF THE GLOOM\n\nThe deck of the air ship was tipped up at an angle of forty-five degrees\nby the pressure, and with inarticulate cries most of those on board\ntumbled off, some falling into the water and some disappearing amidst the\ntangled vegetation. Ala was visible, as the machine sank lower, and\ncrashed through the branches, clinging to an upright on the sloping deck,\nwhile Juba, who hung on like a huge baboon, was helping her to maintain\nher place.\n\nAlmost at the same moment I caught sight of the head of the monstrous\nanimal which had caused the disaster. It was as massive as that of an\nelephant or mammoth; and the awful arm resembled a trunk, but was of\nincredible size. Moreover, it was covered with sucking mouths or disks.\nThe creature apparently had four eyes ranged round the conical front of\nthe head where it tapered into the trunk, and two of these were visible,\nhuge, green, and deadly bright in the gleam of the lantern.\n\nFor a moment we all stood as if petrified; then the great arm was thrown\nwith a movement quick as lightning round both Ala and Juba as they clung\nto the upright! My heart shot into my mouth, but before the animal could\nhaul in its prey, a series of terrific reports rattled like the discharge\nof a machine gun at my ear. The monstrous arm released the victims, and\nwaved in agony, breaking the thick, clammy branches of the vegetation,\nand the vast head disappeared. Edmund had fired all the ten shots in his\nautomatic pistol with a single pressure of the double trigger and an\nunvarying aim, directed, no doubt, at one of the creature's eyes.\n\n\"Quick!\" he shouted, as the air ship, relieved from the stress, righted\nitself; \"climb aboard.\"\n\nThe vessel had sunk so low, and the vegetation was so crowded about it,\nthat we had no great difficulty in obeying his commands. He was the last\naboard, and instantly he grasped the controlling apparatus, and we rose\nout of the tangle. We could hear the wounded monster thrashing in the\nswamp, but saw only the reflection of its movements in the commotion of\nthe branches.\n\nI had expected that Edmund would immediately fly at top speed away from\nthe dreadful place, but, instead, as soon as we were at a safe elevation,\nhe brought the air ship to a hover, circling slowly above the\ncomparatively open spot of dry ground at the edge of the swamp.\n\n\"We cannot leave the poor fellows who have fallen overboard,\" he said, as\nquietly as if he had been safely aboard his own car. \"We must stay here\nand find them.\"\n\nSoon their cries came to our ears, and turning down the light of the\nlantern we saw five of them collected together on the solid ground, and\ngesticulating to us in an agony of terror. Edmund swept the ship around\nuntil we were directly over the poor fellows, and then allowed it to\nsettle until it rested on the ground beside them. I trembled with\napprehension at this bold maneuver, but Edmund was as steady as a rock.\nAla instantly comprehended his intention, and encouraged her followers,\nwho were all but paralyzed with fright, to clamber aboard. A momentary\ncommunication of the eyes took place between Edmund and Ala, and I\nunderstood that he was demanding if all had been found.\n\nThere was another--and not a trace of him could be seen.\n\n\"We must wait a moment,\" said Edmund, reloading the chamber of his pistol\nwhile he spoke. \"I'll look about for him.\"\n\n\"In God's name, Edmund! You don't think of going down there!\"\n\n\"But I do,\" he said firmly, and before I could put my hand on his arm he\nhad dropped from the deck. The gigantic creature that he had wounded was\nstill thrashing about a little distance off, occasionally making horrible\nsounds, but Edmund seemed to have no fear. We saw him, with amazement,\nwalk collectedly round the ground encircled by the swamp, peering into\nthe tangle, and frequently uttering a call. But his search was vain, and\nafter five minutes of the most intense nervous strain that I ever\nendured, I thanked Heaven for seeing him return in safety, and come\nslowly aboard. There was another consultation with Ala, which evidently\nrelated to the ability of the engineer of the ship to resume his\nfunctions. This had a satisfactory result, for the fellow took his place,\nand the vessel finally quitted the ground. But, at Edmund's request, it\nrose only to a moderate height, and then began again to circle about. He\nwould not yet give up the search.\n\nWe flew in widening circles, Edmund keeping his lantern directed toward\nthe ground, and the full horror of these interminable morasses now became\nplain. I was in a continual shudder at the evidence of Ingra's pitiless\nscheme for our destruction. He had meant that we should be the prey of\nthe unspeakable inhabitants of the fens, and had believed that there was\nno possibility of escape from them. We became aware that there was a\ngreat variety of them in the swamps and thickets beneath through the\nnoises that they made--heart-quaking cries, squealing sounds, gruntings,\nand, most trying of all, a loud, piercing whistle whose sibilant\npulsations penetrated the ear like thrusts of a needle. I pictured to\nmyself a colossal serpent as the most probable author of this terrifying\nsound, but the error of my fancy was demonstrated by a tragedy which\nshook even Edmund's iron nerves.\n\nAlways circling, and always watching what was below by the light of the\nlantern, which was of extraordinary power for so small an instrument, we\nsaw occasionally a curling trunk uplifted above the vegetation, as if its\nowner imagined that the strange light playing on the branches was some\ndelicate prey that could be grasped, and sometimes a gliding form whose\ndetails escaped detection, when, upon passing over a relatively open\nplace, like that where our adventure had occurred, a blood-curdling sight\nmet our eyes.\n\nDirectly ahead, in the focus of the reflector of the lantern, and not\nmore than a hundred feet distant, stood a prodigious black creature, on\neight legs, rolling something in its mandibles, which were held close to\nwhat seemed to be its mouth.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" cried Jack. \"It's a tarantula as big as a buffalo!\"\n\n\"It has caught the missing man!\" said Edmund. \"Look!\"\n\nHe pointed to a shred of garment dangling on a thorny branch. I felt sick\nat heart, and I heard a groan from Jack. After all, these people were\nlike us, and our feelings would not have been more keenly agitated if the\nvictim had been a descendant of Adam.\n\n\"He is beyond all help,\" I faltered.\n\n\"But he can be avenged,\" said Edmund, in a tone that I had never heard\nhim use before.\n\nAs he spoke he whipped out his pistol, and crash! crash! crash! sounded\nthe hurrying shots. As their echo ceased, the giant arachnid dropped his\nprey, and then there came from him--clear, piercing, quivering through\nour nerves--that arrowy whistle that had caused us to shudder as we\nunwillingly listened to it darting out of the gloom of the impenetrable\nthickets.\n\nThen, to our horror, the creature, which, if touched at all by the shots,\nhad not been seriously injured, picked up its prey and bounded away in\nthe darkness. Edmund instantly turned to Ala, and I knew as well as if he\nhad spoken, what his demand was. He wished to follow, and his wish was\nobeyed. We swooped ahead, and in a minute we saw the creature again. It\nhad stopped on another oasis of dry land, and it still carried its\ndreadful burden. Its head was toward us, and it appeared to be watching\nour movements. Its battery of eyes glittered wickedly, and I noticed the\nbristle of stiff hairs, like wires, that covered its body and legs.\n\nAgain Edmund fired upon it, and again it uttered its stridulous pipe of\ndefiance, or fear, and leaped away in the tangle. We sped in pursuit, and\nwhen we came upon it for the third time it had stopped in an opening so\nnarrow that the bow of the air ship almost touched it before we were\naware of its presence. This time its prey was no longer visible. There\nwas no question now that its attitude meant defiance. Cold shivers ran\nall over me as, with fascinated eyes, I gazed at its dreadful form. It\nseemed to be gathering itself for a spring, and I shrank away in terror.\n\nCrash! bang! bang! bang! sounded the shots once more, and in the midst of\nthem there came a blinding tangle of bristled, jointed legs that thrashed\nthe deck, a thud that shook the air ship to its center, and a cry from\nJack, who fell on his back with a crimson line across his face.\n\n\"Give me your pistol!\" shouted Edmund, snatching my arm.\n\nI hardly know how I got it out of my pocket, I was so unnerved, but it\nwas no sooner in Edmund's hand than he was leaning over the side of the\ndeck and pouring out the shots. When the pistol was emptied he\nstraightened up, and said simply:\n\n\"_That_ devil is ended.\"\n\nThen he turned to where Jack lay on the deck. We all bent over him with\nanxious hearts, even Ala sharing our solicitude. He had lost his senses,\nbut a drop from Edmund's flask immediately brought him round, and he rose\nto his feet.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he said, with a rather sickly smile; \"but,\" drawing his\nhand across his brow and cheek, \"he got me here, and I thought it was a\nhot iron. Where is he now?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" said Edmund.\n\n\"Jo, I'd have liked to finish him myself!\"\n\nWe were worried by the appearance of the wound, like a long, deep\nscratch, on Jack's face, but, of course, we said nothing about our\nworriment to him. Edmund bound it up, as best he could, and it afterwards\nhealed, but it took a long time about it, and left a mark that never\ndisappeared. There was probably a little poison in it.\n\nEdmund himself needed the attention of a surgeon, for his wrists had been\ncruelly burned by the matches, but he would not allow us to speak of his\nsufferings, and putting on some slight bandages, he declared that it was\ntime now to get out of this wilderness of horrors. He communicated with\nAla, and in a few minutes we were speeding, at a high elevation, toward\nthe land of the opaline dome. So far above the morasses we no longer\nheard the brute voices of its terrible inhabitants, nor saw the swaying\nof the branches as they looked about in search of prey.\n\n\"This,\" said Edmund, \"exceeds everything that I could have imagined. I do\nnot know in what classification to put any of the strange beasts that we\nhave seen. They can only be likened to the monsters of the early dawn on\nthe earth, in the age of the dinosaurs. But they are _sui generis_, and\nwould make our anatomists and paleontologists stare. I am only surprised\nthat we have encountered no flying dragons here.\"\n\n\"But was it really a--a giant spider that captured Ala's man?\" I asked\nwith a shudder.\n\n\"God knows what it was! It had the form of a spider, and it leaped like\none. If it had been armored I could never have killed it. I think the\nshock of its impact against the air ship helped to finish it.\"\n\nIt was only after we had issued from under the curtain of twilight that\nwe learned the story of the chase which had brought our salvation. Edmund\nfirst obtained it from Ala and Juba, filling out the outlines of their\nwordless narrative with his ready power of interpretation, and then he\ntold it to us.\"\n\n\"We owe our lives to Juba,\" he said. \"Ala had just returned to the mine\nfrom the capital when our abduction took place. Juba, who had wandered\nout on our track, saw from a distance the seizure, and a few minutes\nafterwards Ala's air ship arrived. He instantly communicated the facts to\nher, and without losing an instant the chase was begun. Ingra's delay in\nchoosing his course was the thing that saved us. They knew that they must\nnot lose sight of us for an instant, and their motors were driven to\ntheir highest capacity. Fortunately, Ala's vessel is one of the\nspeediest, and they were able to gain on us from the start. Slowly they\ndrew up until the border of the twilight zone was reached. Then as we\nentered under the clouds we were swallowed from the sight of all except\nJuba. But for his wonderful eyes, there would have been no hope of\ncontinuing the chase. He had lived all his life in a land of darkness and\nnow he began to feel himself at home. Throwing off the shades which he\nhas worn since our arrival, he had no difficulty in following the\nmovements of Ingra, even after our vessel had completely faded from the\nview of all the others. So, without abating their fearful speed, they\nplunged into the gloom straight upon our track. The nose of the\nbloodhound is not more certain in the chase than were Juba's eyes in that\nterrible flight through the darkness. When Ingra changed his course and\ndoubled, Juba saw the maneuver and turned the dodge against its inventor,\nfor now Ingra could not see them, and did not know that they were still\non his track. They cut off the corners, and gained so rapidly that they\nwere close at hand when Ingra rose from the swamp after pitching us\noverboard. They had heard Henry's cry, which served to tell them what had\nhappened, and to direct them to the spot. But even Juba could not discern\nus in the midst of the vegetation, and it was the sudden flashing out of\nour lamp which revealed our location when they were about to pass\ndirectly over us.\"\n\nI need not say with what breathless attention we listened to this\nremarkable story, which Edmund's scientific imagination had constructed\nout of the bones of fact that he had been able to gather.\n\n\"Jo,\" said Jack, \"our luck is simply outlandish!\"\n\nThen he broke out in one of his fits of enthusiasm. Slapping Juba on the\nshoulder, he danced around him, laughing joyously, and exclaiming:\n\n\"Bully old boy! Oh, you're a trump! Wait till I get you in New York, and\nI'll give you the time of your life! Eh, Edmund, won't we make him a\nmember of Olympus? Golly, won't he make a sensation!\"\n\nAnd Jack hugged himself again with delight. His reference to home threw\nus into a musing. At length I asked:\n\n\"Shall we ever see the earth again, Edmund?\"\n\n\"Why, of course we shall,\" he replied heartily. \"I have the material I\nneed, and it only remains to repair the car. I shall set about it the\nmoment we reach the capital. Do you know,\" he continued, \"this adventure\nhas undoubtedly been a benefit to us.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"By increasing our prestige. They have seen the terrible power of the\npistols. They have seen us conquer monsters that they must have regarded\nas invincible. When they see what the car can do, even Ingra will begin\nto fear us, and to think that we are more than mortal.\"\n\n\"But what will Ala think of Ingra now?\"\n\n\"Ah, I cannot tell; but, at any rate, he cannot have strengthened himself\nin her regard, for it is plain that she, at least, has no desire to see\nus come to harm. But he is a terrible enemy still, and we must continue\nto be on our guard against him.\"\n\n\"I should think that he would hardly dare to show himself now,\" I\nremarked.\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that. After all, we are interlopers here, and he\nhas all the advantages of his race and his high rank. Ala is interested\nin us because she has, I believe I may say, a philosophical mind, with a\ngreat liking for scientific knowledge. It was she who planned and\npersonally conducted the expedition toward the dark hemisphere. From me\nshe has learned a little. She appreciates our knowledge and our powers,\nand would ask nothing better than to learn more about us and from us. Her\nprompt pursuit and interference to save us when she must have understood,\nperfectly, Ingra's design, shows that she will go far to protect us; but\nwe must not presume too much on her ability to continue her protection,\nnor even on her unvarying disposition to do so. For the present, however,\nI think that we are safe, and I repeat that our position has been\nstrengthened. Ingra made a great mistake. He should have finished us out\nof hand.\"\n\n\"His leaving us to be devoured by those fearful creatures showed an\ninexplicable cruelty on his part; he chose the most horrible death he\ncould think of for us,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Edmund. \"Did you ever see a laughing boy\nthrow flies into a spider's den? It is my idea that he simply wished to\nhave us disappear mysteriously, and then _he_ would never have offered an\nexplanation, unless it might have been the malicious suggestion that we\nhad suddenly decamped to return to the world we pretended to have come\nfrom. And but for Ala's unexpected return to the mine he would have\nsucceeded. No doubt his crew were pledged to secrecy.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nEARTH MAGIC ON VENUS\n\nWe were no sooner installed again at the capital than Edmund began his\n\"readjustment of the atomic energies.\"\n\n\"Blessed if I know what he means,\" said Jack; \"but he gets the goods, and\nthat's enough for me.\"\n\nIn reality I did not understand it any better than Jack did, only I had\nmore knowledge than he of the nature of the forces that Edmund employed.\nWe went with him to the place in the great tower where the car had been\nstored, and where it seemed to be regarded with a good deal of\nsuperstitious awe. But they had not yet the least idea of its marvelous\npowers. We were preparing for them the greatest surprise of their lives,\nand our impatience to see the effect that would be produced when we made\nour first flight grew by day, while Edmund, shut up alone in the car,\nlabored away at his task.\n\n\"I wonder what they think he is doing in there,\" I said, the third day\nafter our return, as we sat on a balcony of the floating tower, with our\nfeet nonchalantly elevated on a railing, and our eyes drinking in the\nmagnificent prospect of the vast city, as brilliant in variegated colors\nas a flower garden, while a soft breeze, that gently swayed the gigantic\ngossamer, soothed us like a perfumed fan.\n\n\"Worshipping the sun god, I reckon,\" laughed Jack. \"But, see here, Peter,\nwhat do you make of this religion of theirs, anyway?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to make of it,\" I replied. \"But if the sun really does\nappear to them once in a lifetime, or so, as Edmund thinks, it seems to\nme natural enough that they should worship it. We have done more\nsurprising things of the kind on the earth.\"\n\n\"Not civilized people like these.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. The Egyptians were civilized, and the Romans, and they\nworshipped all sorts of strange things that struck their fancy. And what\ncan you say to the Greeks--they were civilized enough, and look what a\ncollection of gods they had.\"\n\n\"But the wise heads among them didn't really believe in their gods.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure of that; at any rate they had to pretend that they\nbelieved. No doubt there were some who secretly scoffed at the popular\nbelief, and it may be the same here. I shouldn't wonder if Ingra were one\nof the scoffers. Edmund has a great opinion of his intelligence, and if\nhe really doesn't believe in the thing, he is all the more dangerous for\nus, because you know that now we are depending a good deal on their\nsuperstition for our safety.\"\n\n\"But Ala is very intelligent, a regular wonder, I should think, from what\nEdmund says; and yet she accepts their superstition as gospel.\"\n\n\"Lucky for us that she does believe,\" I said. \"But there's some great\nmystery behind all this; Edmund has convinced me of that. We don't begin\nto understand it yet, and there are moments when I think that Edmund is\nafraid of the whole thing. He seems dimly to foresee some catastrophe\nconnected with it, though what it may be I cannot imagine, and I think he\ndoesn't know himself.\"\n\nHenry listened to our conversation without proffering a remark--quite the\nregular thing with him--and at this point Jack, yielding to the\noverpowering sense of well-being, and the soothing influence of the\ndelicious air and delightful view, closed his eyes for a nap.\n\nPresently Edmund came and roused us all up with the remark that he had\nfinished his work. Jack was instantly on his feet:\n\n\"Hurrah!\" he exclaimed. \"Now for another trip that will open the eyes of\nthese Venusians. Where shall we go, Edmund?\"\n\n\"We shall go nowhere just at present. I want first to make sure by a\ntrial trip that everything is in perfect shape. For that purpose I shall\nwait for the hours of repose when there will be nobody to watch us.\"\n\nI must here explain more fully what I have already said--that in this\nland of unceasing daylight, everybody took repose as regularly as on the\nearth. That is a necessity for all physical organisms. When they slept,\nthey retired into darkened chambers, and passed several hours in peaceful\nslumber. We had learned the time when this periodical need for sleep\nseized upon the entire population, and although, naturally, there were a\nfew wide-awakes who kept \"late hours,\" yet within a certain time after\nthe habitual hour for repose had arrived it was a rare thing to see\nanybody stirring. We had, then, only to wait until \"the solemn dead of\nnight\" came on in order that Edmund might try his experiment with almost\na certainty of not being observed. This was the easier, since latterly\nthere had been no guard kept over our movements. We were not confined in\nany way, and could go and come as we pleased. Evidently, if anybody\nthought of such a thing as an attempt to escape on our part, they trusted\nto the fact that we had no means of getting away, for after our first\nexploit of that kind, all the air ships were carefully guarded, and\nplaced beyond our reach. As to the car, there was nothing about it to\nsuggest that it could fly, and probably they took it simply for some kind\nof boat, since they had seen us employ it only in navigating the sea. I\nhave often thought, with wonder, of their unsuspiciousness in permitting\nEdmund to spend so much time alone and undisturbed in the car. Possibly,\nthere was something in Jack's suggestion, that they supposed it to be\nconnected with our religious observances. Anyhow, so it was; and I can\nonly ascribe the fact to the kindness of that overlooking Power which so\noften interfered in our behalf, making it no disparagement of our claim\nupon its protection that we had abandoned our mother earth and ventured\nso far away into space!\n\nOne thing decidedly in our favor was that, since our return from the mine\n(the adventure in the land of bogs and monsters was, as far as Edmund\ncould ascertain, unknown at the capital, except by those who had taken\npart in it), we had been accustomed to pass the hours of repose in the\ntower. We should thus be close to the car when we got ready to start.\nAnother equally favorable circumstance--and perhaps it was even more\nimportant--was the absence of Ingra, who, either because he did not care\njust now to face Ala, or because he had gone off somewhere after throwing\nus to the animals and was not yet aware of our escape, had not shown\nhimself. If he had been present it might not have been so easy for Edmund\nto make his preparations.\n\nNever had the great city seemed to me so long in quieting down for its\nperiodical rest as on this occasion. After all was deserted in the\nstreets below, people were still moving about on the tower, and it did\nseem as if they had taken a fit of wakefulness expressly to annoy us and\ninterfere with our plans. We kept stealing out of our sleeping room, and\nlooking cautiously about, for at least two hours, but always there was\nsome one stirring in the immediate neighborhood. At last a tall fellow,\nwho had been standing an interminable time at the rail directly in front\nof the storage place of the car, and whom Jack had half seriously\nthreatened to throttle if he stood there any longer, turned and went\nyawning away. No sooner was he out of sight than Edmund led the way, and\nwith the slightest possible noise, aided by Juba, who was as strong as\nthree men, we got the car out on the platform. I was in a fever lest\nthere should be a squeak from the little wheels that carried it. But they\nran as still as rubber.\n\n\"Get in,\" whispered Edmund; and we obeyed him with alacrity.\n\nWould it go?\n\nEven Edmund could not answer that question. He pulled a knob, and I held\nmy breath. There was the slightest perceptible tremor. Was it going to\nbalk? No, thank Heaven! It was under way. In a few seconds we were off\nthe tower in the free air. Edmund pressed a button, and the speed\ninstantly increased. The gorgeous tower seemed to be flying away from us\nlike a soap bubble. Jack, in ecstasy, could hardly repress a cheer.\n\n\"Hurrah, if you want to,\"' said Edmund.\n\n\"They won't hear you, and now I don't care if they do. The apparatus is\nall right, and we'll give them something to wake up for. My only anxiety\nwas lest they should witness a failure, which might have led to\ndisagreeable consequences. There must be no dropping of knives in our\njuggling.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried Jack. \"Then let's give 'em a salute.\"\n\nEdmund smiled and nodded his head:\n\n\"The guns are in the locker,\" he said.\n\nJack had one of the automatic rifles out in a hurry.\n\n\"Shoot high,\" said Edmund, \"and off toward the open country. The\nprojectiles fly far, and I guess we can take the risk.\"\n\nHe threw both windows open, and Jack aimed skyward and began to pull the\ntrigger.\n\nBang! bang! bang! Heavens, what a noise it was! The car must have seemed\na flying volcano. And it woke them up! The sleeping city poured forth its\nmillions to gaze and wonder. Surely they had never heard such a\nthundering. Within five minutes we saw them on the roofs and in the\ntowers. Many were staring at us through a kind of opera glasses which\nthey had. Then from a dozen aerial pavilions the colors broke forth and\nquivered through the air.\n\n\"Saluting us!\" exclaimed Jack, delighted.\n\n\"Asking one another questions, rather,\" said Edmund.\n\nThey certainly asked enough of them, and I wondered what answers they\nreturned.\n\n\"Probably they think we're off for good,\" said I.\n\n\"And aren't we?\" asked Henry anxiously.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Edmund replied, and Henry's countenance fell.\n\nThe car turned and approached the great tower again. We swept round it\nwithin a hundred yards, and could see the amazement in the faces that\nwatched us. But if they were astonished they were not terror-stricken.\nWithin ten minutes twenty air ships were swiftly approaching us. Edmund\nallowed them to come within a few yards, and then darted away, rushed\nround the whole city like a flying cloud, and finally rose straight up\nwith dizzying velocity, which made the vast metropolis shrink to a\ncolored patch, as if we had been viewing it through the wrong end of a\ntelescope.\n\n\"I'll go right up through the cloud dome now,\" he said. \"Nothing could\nmore impress them with a sense of our power than that; and when we come\nback again they will know that we have no fear, and the very act will be\na proof of origin from the sky.\"\n\nWhen we were in the midst of the mighty curtain of vapor, I was\ninterested in noticing the peculiar quality of the light that surrounded\nus. We seemed to be immersed in a rose-pink mist.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" I said to Edmund, \"how this dome is maintained at\nso great an elevation, and in apparent independence of the rain clouds\nwhich sometimes form beneath. No rain ever falls from the dome itself,\nand yet it consists of true clouds.\"\n\n\"I think,\" he replied, \"that the dome is due to vapors which assemble at\na general level of condensation, and do not form raindrops, partly\nbecause of the absence of dust to serve as nuclei at this great height,\nand partly because of some peculiar electrical condition of the air,\narising from the relative nearness of Venus to the sun, which prevents\nthe particles of vapor from gathering into drops heavy enough to fall.\nYou will observe that there is a peculiar inner circulation in the vapor\nsurrounding us, marked by ascending and descending currents which are\ndoubtless limited by the upper and lower surfaces of the dome. The true\nrain clouds form in the space beneath the dome, where there seems to be\nan independent circulation of the winds.\"\n\nOn entering the cloud vault Edmund had closed the windows, explaining\nthat it was not merely the humidity which led him to do so, but the\ndiminishing density of the air which, when we had risen considerably\nabove the dome, would become too rare for comfortable breathing. In a\nlittle while his conjecture about a peculiar electrical condition was\njustified by a pale-blue mist which seemed to fill the air in the car;\nbut we felt no effects and the mechanism was not disturbed. Owing to our\nlocation on Venus, still at a long distance from the center of the\nsunward hemisphere, the sun was not directly overhead, but inclined at a\nlarge angle to the vertical, so that when we began to approach the upper\nsurface of the vault, and the vapor thinned out, we saw through one of\nthe windows a pulsating patch of light, growing every moment brighter and\nmore distinct, until as we shot out of the clouds it instantly sharpened\ninto a huge round disk of blinding brilliance.\n\n\"The sun! The sun!\" we cried.\n\nWe had not seen it for months. When it had gleamed out for a short time\nduring our drift across the water from the land of ice into the belt of\ntempests, we had been too much occupied with our safety to pay attention\nto it; but now the wonder of it awed us. Four times as large and four\ntimes as bright and hot as it appears from the earth, its rays seemed to\nsmite with terrific energy. Juba, wearing his eye shades, shrank into a\ncorner and hid his face.\n\n\"It is well that we are protected by the walls of the car and the thick\nglass windows,\" said Edmund, \"for I do not doubt that there are solar\nradiations in abundance here which scarcely affect us on the earth, but\nwhich might prove dangerous or even mortal if we were exposed to their\nfull force.\"\n\nEven at the vast elevation which we had now attained there was still\nsufficient air to diffuse the sunlight, so that only a few of the\nbrightest stars could be glimpsed. Below us the spectacle was magnificent\nand utterly unparalleled. There lay the immense convex shield of Venus,\nmore dazzling than snow, and as soft in appearance as the finest wool. We\ngazed and gazed in silent admiration, until suddenly Henry, who had shown\nless enthusiasm over the view than the rest of us, said, in a doleful\nvoice:\n\n\"And now that we are here--free, free, where we can do as we like--with\nall means at our command--oh! why will you return to that accursed\nplanet? Edmund, in the name of God, I beseech you, go back to the earth!\nGo now! For the love of Heaven do not drag us into danger again! Go home!\nOh, go home!\"\n\nThe appeal was pitiful in its intensity of feeling, and a shade of\nhesitation appeared on Edmund's face. If it had been Jack or I, I believe\nthat he would have yielded. But he slowly shook his head, saying in a\nsympathetic tone:\n\n\"I am sorry, Henry, that you feel that way. But I _cannot_ leave this\nplanet yet. Have patience for a little while and then we will go home.\"\n\nI doubt whether afterwards, Edmund himself did not regret that he had\nrefused to grant Henry's prayer. If we had gone now when it was in our\npower to go without interference, we should have been spared the most\ntragic and heart-rending event of all that occurred during the course of\nour wandering. But Edmund seemed to feel the fascination of Venus as a\nmoth feels that of the candle flame.\n\nWhen we emerged again on the lower side of the dome we were directly over\nthe capital. We had been out of view for at least three hours, but many\nwere still gazing skyward, toward the point where the car had\ndisappeared, and when we came into sight once more there were signs of\nthe utmost agitation. The prismatic signals began to flash from tower to\ntower, conveying the news of the reappearance of the car, and as we drew\nnear we saw the crowds reassembling on every point of vantage. We went\nout on the window ledges to watch the display.\n\n\"Perhaps they think that we have been paying a visit to the sun,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Well, if they do I shall not undeceive them,\" said Edmund, \"although it\ngoes against the grain to make any pretense of the kind. Ala,\nparticularly, is so intelligent, and has so genuine a desire for\nknowledge, that if I could only cause her to comprehend the real truth it\nwould afford me one of the greatest pleasures of my life.\"\n\n\"I hope old Beak Nose is getting his fill of this show,\" put in Jack.\n\"He'll be likely to treat us with more respect after this. By the way, I\nwonder what's become of my money. I think I'll sue out a writ of replevin\nin the name of the sun to recover it.\"\n\nNobody replied to Jack's sally, and the car rapidly approached the great\ntower.\n\n\"Are you going to land there?\" I asked.\n\n\"I certainly shall,\" Edmund responded with decision.\n\n\"But they'll seize the car!\" exclaimed Henry in affright.\n\n\"No, they won't. They are too much afraid of it.\"\n\nAny further discussion was prevented by a sight which arrested the eyes\nof all of us. On the principal landing of the tower, whence we had\ndeparted with the car, stood Ala with her suite, and by her side was\nIngra!\n\nHis sudden apparition was a great surprise, as well as a great\ndisappointment, for we had felt sure that he was not in the city, and I,\nat least, had persuaded myself that he might be in disgrace for his\nattempt on our lives. Yet here he was, apparently on terms of confidence\nwith her whom we had regarded as our only sure friend.\n\n\"Hang him!\" exclaimed Jack. \"There he is! By Jo, if Edmund had only\ninvented a noiseless gun of forty million atom power, I'd rid Venus of\n_him_, in the two-billionth part of a second!\"\n\n\"Keep quiet,\" said Edmund, sternly, \"and remember what I now tell you; in\nno way, by look or act, is any one of us to indicate to him the slightest\nresentment for what he did. Ignore him, as if you had never seen him.\"\n\nBy this time the car had nearly touched the landing. Edmund stepped\ninside a moment and brought it completely to rest, anchoring it, as he\nwhispered to me, by \"atomic attraction.\" When the throng on the tower saw\nthe car stop dead still, just in contact with the landing, but manifestly\nsupported by nothing but the air--no wings, no aeroplanes, no screws, no\nmechanism of any kind visible--there arose the first _voice of a crowd_\nthat we had heard on the planet. It fairly made me jump, so unexpected,\nand so contrary to all that we had hitherto observed, was the sound. And\nthis multitudinous voice itself had a quality, or timbre, that was unlike\nany sound that had ever entered my ears. Thin, infantine, low, yet\nmultiplied by so many mouths to a mighty volume, it was fearful to listen\nto. But it lasted only a moment; it was simply a universal ejaculation,\nextorted from this virtually speechless people by such a marvel as they\nhad never dreamed of looking upon. But even this burst of astonishment,\nas Edmund afterwards pointed out, was really a tribute to their\nintelligence, since it showed that they had instantly appreciated both\nthe absence of all mechanical means of supporting the car and the fact\nthat here was something that implied a power infinitely exceeding any\nthat they possessed. And to have produced in a world where aerial\nnavigation was the common, everyday means of conveyance, such a sensation\nby a performance in the _air_ was an enormous triumph for us!\n\nNo sooner had we gathered at the door of the car to step out upon the\nplatform than an extraordinary thing occurred. The front of the crowd\nreceded into the form of a semicircle, of which the point where we stood\nmarked the center, and in the middle of the curve, slightly in advance of\nthe others, stood forth the tall form of the eagle-beaked high priest\nwith the terrible face, flanked on one side by Ala and on the other by\nthe Jovelike front of the aged judge before whom our first arraignment\nhad taken place. Directly behind Ala stood Ingra. The contrast between\nthe three principal personages struck my eye even in that moment of\nbewilderment--Ala stately, blonde, and beautiful as a statue of her own\nVenus; the high priest ominous and terrifying in aspect, even now when we\nfelt that he was honoring us; and the great judge, with his snow-white\nhair and piercing eyes, looking like a god from Olympus.\n\n\"Do you note the significance of that arrangement?\" Edmund asked, nudging\nme. \"Ala, the queen, yields the place of honor to the high priest. That\nindicates that our reception is essentially a religious one, and proves\nthat our flight sunward has had the expected effect. Now we have the head\nof the religious order on our side. Human nature, if I may use such a\nterm, is the same in whatever world you find it. Touch the imagination\nwith some marvel and you awaken superstition; arouse superstition and you\ncan do what you like.\"\n\nIt would be idle for me to attempt to describe our reception because\nEdmund himself could only make shrewd guesses as to the meaning of what\nwent on, and you would probably not be particularly interested in his\nconjectures. Suffice it to say that when it was over, we felt that, for a\ntime at least, we were virtually masters of the situation.\n\nOnly one thing troubled my mind--what did Ingra think and what would he\ndo? At any rate, he, too, for the time being, seemed to have been carried\naway with the general feeling of wonder, and narrowly as I watched him I\ncould detect in his features no sign of a wish to renew his persecution.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWILD EDEN\n\nThe next day after our return from the trip above the cloud dome, and our\nastonishing reception (you will, of course, understand the sense in which\nI use the term \"day\"), Edmund sprang another surprise upon us.\n\n\"I have persuaded Ala,\" he said, \"to make a trip in the car.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, and I am sure she will be delighted.\"\n\n\"But she is not going alone?\"\n\n\"Surely no; she will be accompanied by one of her women--and by Ingra.\"\n\n\"_Ingra_!\"\n\n\"Of course. Did you suppose that he would consent to be left behind? Ala\nherself would refuse to go without him.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, with deep disappointment, \"he has resumed all his\ninfluence over her.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure he ever lost it,\" returned Edmund. \"You forget his rank,\nand his position as her destined consort. Whatever we do we have got to\ncount him in.\"\n\nJack raged inwardly, but said nothing. For my part, I almost wished\nJack's bullet had not gone astray at that first memorable shooting.\n\n\"Now,\" Edmund continued, \"the car, as you know, has but a limited amount\nof room. I do not wish to crowd it uncomfortably, but I can take six\npersons. Ala's party comprises three, so there is room for just two\nbesides myself. You will have to draw lots.\"\n\n\"Is Juba included in the drawing?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm half inclined to take him anyway, and let you three draw\nfor the one place remaining.\"\n\n\"You can count me out,\" said Henry. \"If there is another to stay with me\nI prefer to remain.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Edmund, \"then Peter and Jack can draw lots.\"\n\n\"Since we can't all go,\" said Jack, \"and since that fellow is to be of\nthe party, I'll stay with Henry.\"\n\nSo it was settled without an appeal to chance, and I went with Edmund and\nJuba. As usual Edmund immediately put his project into execution. It\nshowed an astonishing confidence in us that Ala should consent to make\nsuch a trip, and that her people, and especially Ingra, should assent to\nit, and I could not sufficiently wonder at the fact. But we were now at\nthe summit of favor and influence, and it is impossible to guess what\nthoughts may have been in their minds. At any rate, it showed how\ncompletely Edmund had established himself in Ala's esteem, and I suspect\nthat her woman's curiosity had played a large part in the decision. There\nwas another thing which astonished me yet more, and, in fact, awakened a\ngood deal of apprehension in my mind. I could not but wonder that Edmund,\nafter all the precautions that he had previously taken, should now think\nof admitting these people into the car, where they could witness his\nmanipulations of the mechanism. I spoke to him about it. \"Rest your mind\neasy about that,\" he said. \"Now that everything goes like a charm, they\nwill suspect nothing. It will be all a complete mystery to them. Even the\ngods used natural agencies when they visited the earth without shaking\nthe belief of mankind in them. I employ no force of which they have the\nleast idea, and if they see me touch a button, or pull a knob, what can\nthat convey to their minds except an impression of mysterious power?\"\n\nI said no more, but I was not convinced, and the sequel proved that, for\nonce, Edmund had made a serious mistake, the more amazing because he had\nbeen the first to detect the exceptional intelligence and shrewdness of\nIngra. But, no doubt, in the exultation of his recent triumph, he counted\nupon the strength of the superstitious regard in which we were held.\n\nOur departure from the tower was the signal for the assembling of great\ncrowds of spectators again, and we sailed away with the utmost _\u00e9clat_.\nAla at once showed all the eager excitement of a child over so novel and\nenjoyable an experience. The motion of the car was entirely unlike that\nof the air ships. Perfectly steady, it skimmed along at a speed which\nfilled her with amazement and delight. The city, with its towers, seemed\nto fly away from us by magic, and the trees and fields beneath ran into\nstreaming lines. The windows were thrown wide open, and all stood by\nthem, watching the scene. Finally Ala wished to go out on the window\nledges, where one was perfectly secure if he kept a firm hold on the\nsupports. Edmund was most of the time with us outside, only stepping\nwithin when he wished to change the course. I thought that he showed a\ndisposition to conceal his manipulations as much as possible, as if what\nI had said had made an impression. But all were so much occupied with\ntheir novel sensations that, for the time at least, there was no danger\nof their taking note of anything else.\n\nI believe that it must have been some intimation from Ala which finally\nled Edmund to hold his course toward the mountains, but in a direction\ndifferent from that which led to the mines. When he had once chosen this\ndirection he worked up the speed to fully a hundred miles an hour, and\nall were compelled to go inside on account of the wind created by our\nrush through the air. We held on thus for five hours. During this time\nEdmund spread a repast made up of dishes chosen from the supplies in the\ncar, and, of course, utterly strange to our guests. They found them to\ntheir taste, however, and were delighted with Edmund's entertainment. We\nspent a long time at our little table, and I was surprised at the variety\nof delicious things which Edmund managed to extract from his stores.\nThere was even some champagne, and I noticed that Edmund urged it upon\nIngra, who, nothing loth, drank enough to make him decidedly tipsy, a\nfact which was not surprising since we had found that the wines of Venus\nwere very light, and but slightly alcoholized.\n\nAt length we began to approach what proved to be the goal of our journey.\nBefore us spread a vast extent of forest composed of trees of the most\nbeautiful forms and foliage. Some towered up to a great height, spreading\ntheir pendulous branches over the less aspiring forms, like New England\nelms; others were low and bushy, and afire with scarlet blossoms, whose\nperfume filled the air; a few resembled gigantic grasses or great timothy\nstems, surmounted with nodding plumes of golden leaves, streaming out\nlike gilt gonfalons in the breeze; but there was one species, as tall and\nmassive as oaks, and scattered everywhere through the forest, that I\ncould liken to nothing but enormous rose bushes in the full bloom of\nJune. When we began to pass above this strange woodland, Ala made some\ncommunication to Edmund which caused him to slow down the movement of the\ncar. By almost imperceptible touches he controlled the motive power, and\npresently we came to rest above a delightful glade, where a small stream\nran at the foot of a gravelly slope, crowned with grass and overhung by\ntrees.\n\nHere the car was allowed to settle gently upon the ground, and all\nalighted. Ingra, over whom the influence of the champagne had been\ngrowing, tottered on his legs in a way that would have filled Jack with\nuncontrollable delight, but Edmund gravely helped him out of the car and\nsteadied him to a seat on the soft turf under the tree. I saw Ala\nregarding Ingra with a puzzled look, and no wonder, for Edmund had been\ncareful that no one else should take enough of the wine to produce more\nthan the slightest exhilaration of spirits. It is possible that Edmund\nhad plied Ingra with the idea of rendering him less observant, and it\nprobably had that effect; but it resulted, as you will see presently, in\na revelation which finally put Edmund on guard against the very danger to\nwhich he had seemed so insensible when I mentioned it to him before our\nstart.\n\nThe place where we now were was, beyond comparison, the most charming\nthat we had yet seen. A very Eden it seemed, wild, splendid, and remote\nfrom all cultivation. The air was loaded with indescribable fragrance\nshed from the thousands of strange blossoms that depended from trees and\nshrubs, and starred the rich grass. I learned afterwards from Edmund, who\nhad it from Ala, that the spot was famous for its beauty and other\nattractions, and was sometimes visited in air ships from the capital. But\nfor them, what took us but a few hours was a trip extending over several\ndays of time. One would have said that the forest was imbedded in a\ngarden of the most extraordinary orchids. The shapes of some of the\nflowers were so fantastic that it seemed impossible that Nature could\nhave produced them. And their colors were no less unparalleled,\ninimitable, and incredible.\n\nThe flowery bank on which we had chosen our resting place was removed a\nfew yards from the spot where the car rested, and the latter was hidden\nfrom view by intervening branches and huge racemes of gorgeous flowers,\nhanging like embroidered curtains about us. A peculiarity of the place\nwas that little zephyr-like breezes seemed to haunt it, coming one could\nnot tell whence, and they stirred the hanging blossoms, keeping them in\nalmost continual rhythmic motion. The effect was wonderfully charming,\nbut I observed that Ala was especially influenced by it. She sat with her\nmaid beside her, and fixed her eyes, with an expression of ecstasy, upon\nthe swinging flowers. I whispered to Edmund to regard her singular\nabsorption. But he had already noticed it, and seemed to be puzzling his\nbrain with thoughts that it suggested to him.\n\nThus as we sat, the leaves of a tree over our heads were lightly stirred,\nand a bird, adorned with long plumes more beautiful than those of a bird\nof paradise, alighted on a branch, and began to ruffle its iridescent\nfeathers in a peculiar way. With every movement waves of color seemed to\nflow over it, merging and dissolving in the most marvelous manner. As\nsoon as this bird appeared, Ala gave it all her attention, and the\npleasure which she experienced in watching it was reflected upon her\ncountenance. She seemed positively enraptured. After a few moments the\nconviction came to me that she was _listening!_ Her whole attitude\nexpressed it. And yet not an audible sound came from the bird. At last I\nwhispered to Edmund:\n\n\"Edmund, I believe that Ala hears something which we do not.\"\n\n\"Of course she does,\" was his reply. \"There is music here, such music as\nwas never heard on earth. That bird is _singing_, but our ears are not\nattuned to its strain. You know the peculiarity of this atmosphere with\nregard to sound, and that all of these people have a horror of loud\nnoises. But their ears detect sounds which are beyond the range of the\nvibrations that affect ours. If you will observe the bird closely you\nwill perceive that there is a slight movement of its throat. But that is\nnot the greatest wonder, by any means. I am satisfied that there is _a\ndirect relation here between sounds and colors_. The swaying of the\nflowers in the breeze and the rhythmic motion of the bird's plumage\nproduce harmonious combinations and recombinations of colors which are\ntransformed into sounds as exquisite as those of the world of insects. A\ncluster of blossoms, when the wind stirs them, shake out a kind of\naeolian melody, and it was that which so entranced Ala a few moments ago.\nShe hears it still, but now it is mastered by the more perfect harmonies\nthat come from the bird, partly from its throat but more from the\nagitation of its delicate feathers.\"\n\nYou may imagine the wonder with which I listened to this. It immediately\nrecalled what Jack and I had observed at the shop of the bird fancier,\nand when the lady carried off her seemingly mute pets in the palanquin.\n\n\"But,\" I said, after a moment of reflection, \"how can such a thing be? To\nme it seems surely impossible.\"\n\n\"I can only try to explain it by an analogy,\" said Edmund. \"You know how,\nby a telephone, sounds are first transmuted into electric vibrations and\nafterwards reshaped into sonorous waves. You know, also, that we have\nused a ray of light to send telephonic messages, through the\nsensitiveness of a certain metal which changes its electric resistance in\naccord with the intensity of the light that strikes it. Thus with a beam\nof light we can reproduce the human voice. Well, what we have done\nawkwardly and tentatively by the aid of imperfect mechanical\ncontrivances, Nature has here accomplished perfectly through the peculiar\ncomposition of the air and some special adjustment of the auditory\napparatus of this people.\n\n\"Light and sound, color and music, are linked for them in a manner\nentirely beyond our comprehension. It is plain to me now that the music\nof color which we witnessed at the capital, was something far more\ncomplete and wonderful than I then imagined. Together with the pleasure\nwhich they derive from the harmonic combinations of shifting hues, they\ndrink in, at the same time, the delight arising from sounds which are\nassociated with, and, in many cases, awakened by, those very colors. It\nis probable that all their senses are far more fully, though more\ndelicately, developed than ours. The perfume of these wonderful flowers\nis probably more delightful to Ala than to us. As there are sounds which\nthey hear though inaudible to us, and colors visible to them which lie\nbeyond the range of our vision, so there may be vibrations affecting the\nolfactory nerves which make no impression upon our sense of smell.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" I exclaimed, \"this seems appropriate to Venus.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edmund with a smile, \"it is appropriate; and yet I am not\nsure that some day we may not arrive at something of the kind on the\nearth.\"\n\nI was about to ask him what he meant when there came an exciting\ninterruption. Ingra, who had fallen more and more under the influence of\nthe champagne, had stumbled to the other side of the little glade,\nvirtually unnoticed, and Juba had wandered out of sight. Suddenly there\ncame from the direction of the car the sound of a struggle mingled with\ninarticulate cries. We sprang to our feet, and, running to the car, found\nboth Ingra and Juba inside it. The former had his hands on one of the\nknobs controlling the mechanism, and Juba had grasped him round the waist\nand was trying to drag him away. Ingra was resisting with all his\nstrength, and uttering strange noises, whose sense, if they had any, we,\nof course, did not comprehend. Just as we reached the door, Juba\nsucceeded in wrenching his opponent from his hold, and immediately gave\nhim a fling which sent him clear out of the car, tumbling in a heap at\nour feet. Juba's eyes were ablaze with a dangerous light, but the moment\nhe encountered Edmund's gaze he quietly walked away and sat down on the\nbank. Ala was immediately by our side, and I thought that I could read\nembarrassment as well as surprise in her looks. Fortunately the knob that\nIngra had grasped had been thrown out of connection; else he and Juba\nmight have made an involuntary voyage through space.\n\nWe picked up Ingra, found a seat for him, and Edmund, going down to the\nbrook, filled a pocket flask with water and flung it in the fellow's\nface. This was repeated several times with the effect of finally\nstraightening out his muddled senses sufficiently to warrant us in\nembarking for the return trip. All the way home Ingra was in a sulky\nmood, like any terrestrial drunkard after a debauch, but he kept his eyes\non all Edmund's movements with an expression of cunning, which he had not\nsufficient self-command to conceal, and which could leave no doubt in our\nminds as to the nature of the quest which had led him into the car. As to\nJuba--although his interference had been of no practical benefit, since\nIngra, especially in his present state, could surely have made no\ndiscovery of any importance--the devotion which he had again shown to our\ninterests endeared him the more to us. Ala's manner showed that she was\ndeeply chagrined, and thus our trip, which had opened so joyously, ended\nin gloom, and we were glad when the car again touched the platform, and\nour guests departed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nTHE SECRET OF THE CAR\n\nJack and Henry were overjoyed to see us again, for after our departure\nthey had fallen into a despondent mood, and began to imagine all sorts of\nevil.\n\n\"Jo!\" was Jack's greeting; \"I never was so glad to see anybody in my\nlife. Edmund, don't you ever go off and leave any of us alone again.\"\n\n\"I'll never leave you again,\" responded Edmund. \"You can count on that.\"\n\nThen we told them the story of what we had seen, and of what had happened\nin the wild Eden that we had visited. They were not so much interested in\nthe most wonderful thing of all--the combination of sound and color--as\nthey were in the conduct of Ingra. Jack laughed until he was tired over\nIngra's drunkenness, but he drew a long face when he heard of the\nadventure in the car.\n\n\"Edmund,\" he said earnestly, \"I am beginning to be of Henry's opinion;\nyou had better get away from here without losing a moment.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Edmund, \"we'll not go yet. The time hasn't come to run away.\nWhat difference does it make even if Ingra does suspect that the car is\nmoved by some mechanism instead of by pure magic? He could not understand\nit if I should explain it to him.\"\n\n\"But you have said that he is extraordinarily intelligent.\"\n\n\"So he is, but his intelligence is limited by the world he lives in, and\nwhile there are many marvelous things here, nobody has the slightest\nconception of inter-atomic force. They have never heard even of\nradioactivity. At the same time I don't mean that they shall go nosing\nabout the car. I'll take care of that.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Jack, \"it grinds me to see that brute Ingra get off scot-free\nafter trying to murder us. And what has he got against us, anyway? But\nfor him we should never have had any trouble. He was against us from the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was particularly _against_ us at the start,\" said\nEdmund. \"Only he was for treating us with less consideration than Ala was\ndisposed to show. But after the first accidental shooting, and the\ndrubbing that Juba gave him, naturally his prejudices were aroused, and\nhe could hardly be blamed for thinking us dangerous. Then, when he found\nhimself defeated, and his wishes disregarded, on all sides, he began to\nhate us. It is easy enough to account for his feelings. Now, since our\nrecent astonishing triumph, being himself incredulous about our celestial\norigin, he will try to undermine us by showing that our seeming miracle\nis no miracle at all.\"\n\n\"And you gave him the chance by taking him in the car!\" I could not help\nexclaiming.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Edmund, with a smile. \"I admit that I made a mistake. I\ncounted too much upon the influence of the sense of mystery. But it will\ncome out all right.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" I persisted. \"He will never rest now until he has found out\nthe secret.\"\n\nNothing more was said on the subject, but Edmund was careful not to leave\nthe car unguarded. It was always kept afloat, though in contact with the\nlanding. The expenditure of energy needed to keep it thus anchored\nwithout support was, Edmund assured us, insignificant in comparison with\nthe quantity stored in his mysterious batteries.\n\nWe were not long in finding, on all sides, evidence that our trip up\nthrough the cloud dome had been a master stroke, and that the presumable\nincredulity of Ingra with regard to our claims was not shared by others.\nHe might have his intimates, who entertained prejudices against us\nresembling his own, but if so we saw nothing of them. In fact, Ingra was\nmuch less in evidence than before, but I did not feel reassured by that;\non the contrary, it made me all the more fearful of some plot on his\npart, and Jack was decidedly of my opinion.\n\n\"Hang him!\" he said, \"he's up to some mischief, and I know it. Much as I\ndetest him, I'd rather have him _in_ sight than _out_, just now. He makes\nme feel like a snake in a bush; if he'd only show his ugly head, or\nspring his rattle, I'd be more comfortable.\"\n\nBut the kindness and deference with which we were treated, and the new\nwonders that were shown to us in the capital, gradually drove Ingra from\nour minds. Now we were permitted to enter the temples without opposition,\nour presence there according with our new character of \"children of the\nsun.\" We saw the worship that was offered before the solar images by\nfamily parties, and attended, as favored guests, the periodical\nceremonies in the great temple. Edmund confessed that the high priest\ngreatly embarrassed him by staring into his eyes, and plainly assuming\nthat he knew things of which he was profoundly ignorant.\n\n\"The hardest thing I ever undertook,\" he said, \"is to hold my mind in\nsuspense during these trying interviews, when he endeavors to read the\ndepths of my soul, and I to throw a veil over them which he cannot\npenetrate.\"\n\nIn some way, Edmund discovered that the high priest and all the priests\nconnected with the sun worship (and they certainly bore a family\nlikeness) belonged to a special race, whose roots ran back into the most\nremote antiquity, and about whose persons clung a sacredness that placed\nthem, in some respects, above the royal family itself. We frequently\nvisited the great library, where Edmund undertook a study of the language\nof the printed rolls, though what he made of it I never clearly\nunderstood. I do not think that he succeeded in deciphering any of it. He\nalso spent much time studying their mechanics and engineering, for which\nhe professed great admiration.\n\nBut most interesting of all to us was what Edmund himself accomplished. I\nhave told you of his remark about the color-sound music, viz., that he\nthought it not impossible that even human senses might be enabled to\nappreciate it. Well, he actually realized that wildly improbable dream!\nHe fitted up a laboratory of his own in which he labored sometimes for\ntwenty hours at a stretch, and at last he brought to us the astonishing\ninvention he had made.\n\nI can make no pretense of understanding it; although Edmund declared\nthat, in substance, it was no more wonderful than a telephone. The\nmachine consisted of a little metal box. (He made three of them, and I\nhave mine yet, but it will not work on the earth, and it lies on my table\nas I write, serving for the most wonderful paper weight that a man ever\npossessed.) When this box was pressed against the ear in front of one of\nthe revolving disks that threw out blending colors, or in the presence of\na \"singing\" bird, the most divine harmonies seemed to awake _in the\nbrain_. I cannot make the slightest approach to a description of the\nmarvelous phenomenon. One felt his whole being infused with ecstatic\njoy. It was the very soul of music itself, celestial, ineffable! The\nwonder-box also enabled us to catch many sounds peculiar to the\natmosphere of Venus, formed of vibrations, as Edmund had explained, that\nlie outside our gamut. But to these, apart from the music, I could never\nlisten. They were _too_ abnormal, filling one with inexplicable terror,\nas if he had been snatched out of nature and compelled to listen to the\nsounds of a preternatural world. The only sound that I ever heard with my\nnatural ear which bore the slightest resemblance to these was the awful\npiercing whistle of the monster that killed Ala's man.\n\nYet we derived immense pleasure from the possession of those little\nboxes. With their aid, we could appreciate the exquisite melodies that\nwere played everywhere--in great halls where thousands were assembled, in\nthe temples great and small, and in the homes of the people, to which we\nwere often admitted. In every house there was on one of the walls a\n\"musical rose,\" whose harmonies entranced the visitor. And the variety of\nmusical _motifs_ seemed to be absolutely without limit. One was never\ntired of the entertainment because there was so little repetition.\n\nOn one ever-memorable occasion we heard the great national, or, as Edmund\npreferred to call it, \"racial\" hymn, played in the air from the principal\ntower. When we had only beheld the play of colors characterizing this\ncomposition we had found it altogether delightful, although, as I have\nsaid, Edmund detected, even then, some underlying tone of sadness or\ndespair; but when its _sounds_ broke into the brain the effect was\noverwhelming. The entire thing seemed to have been \"written in a minor\nkey,\" of infinite world-embracing pathos. The listener was plunged into\ndepths of feeling that seemed unfathomable, eternal--and unendurable.\n\n\"Heavens!\" whispered Jack to me in an awed voice, dropping the box from\nhis ear, \"I can't _stand_ it!\"\n\nI saw tears running down his face, and felt them on my own. Edmund and\nHenry were equally affected, and could not continue to listen. Edmund\nsaid nothing, but I recalled his words about the traditional belief of\nthis people that their world had entered upon the last stage of its\nexistence. Then I watched the countenances about us; they wore an\nexpression of solemnity, and yet there was something which spoke of an\nuplifting pride, awakened by the great paean, and swelling the heart with\nmemories of interminable ages of past glory.\n\n\"Come,\" said Edmund at last, turning away, \"this is not for us. The\nmeasureless sadness we feel, but the triumphant reflection of ancestral\ngreatness is for them alone. Heavens! what an artist he must have been\nwho composed this!--if it be not like the Iliad, the work of an age\nrather than of a man.\"\n\nWe almost forgot the passage of time in the enjoyment of our now\ndelightful and untroubled existence, but there came at last a rude\nawakening from this life, which had become for us like a dream.\n\nAs I have said, we had ceased to worry about Ingra, whom we seldom saw,\nand who, when we did see him, gave no indication of continued enmity. At\nfirst we had kept the car under continual surveillance, but as time went\non we became careless in this respect, and at last we did not guard it at\nall.\n\nOne day, during the time of repose, I happened to be, with Juba, in our\nroom on that stage of the great tower where the car was anchored, while\nEdmund and the others were below in the palace. Juba was already asleep,\nand I was lying down and courting drowsiness, when a slight noise outside\nattracted my attention. I stepped softly to the door and looked out. The\ndoor of the car was open! Supposing that Edmund was there I approached to\nspeak to him. By good fortune I was wearing the soft slippers worn by\neverybody here, and which we had adopted, so that my footsteps made no\nsound.\n\nAs I reached the car door and looked in, I nearly dropped in the\nintensity of my surprise and consternation. There, at the farther end,\nwas Ingra, on his knees before the mechanical mouths which swallowed the\ninvisible elements of power from the air; and beside him was another,\nalso on his knees, and busy with tools, apparently trying to detach the\nthings. The explanation flashed over my mind; Ingra had brought a skilled\nengineer to aid him in discovering the secret of the car, and, no doubt,\nto rob it of its mysterious mechanism. They seemed to fear no\ninterruption, because Ingra had undoubtedly informed himself of the fact\nthat for a day or two past we had abandoned the use of our room in the\ntower, and taken our repose in our apartments in the palace. It was by\nmere chance that Juba and I had, on this occasion, remained so long aloft\nthat I had decided to take our sleep in the tower room.\n\nAnticipating no surveillance, Ingra was not on his guard, and had no idea\nthat I was behind him. Instinctively I grasped for my pistol but\ninstantly remembered that it was with my coat in the room. I tiptoed\nback, awoke Juba, making him a sign to be noiseless, got the pistol, and\nreturned, without a sound, to the open door of the car with Juba at my\nheels. They were yet on their knees, with their heads under the shelf,\nand I heard the slight grating made by the tool that Ingra's assistant\nwas using. The pistol was in my hand. What should I do? Shoot him down\nwithout warning, or trust to the strength of Juba to enable us to\novercome them both and make them prisoners?\n\nWhile I hesitated, and it was but a moment, Ingra suddenly rose to his\nfeet and confronted us. An exclamation burst from his lips, and the other\nsprang up. I covered Ingra with the pistol and pulled the trigger. There\nwas not a sound! The sickening remembrance then burst over me that I had\nnot reloaded the pistol since Edmund had emptied its whole chamber in the\nclosing fight with the tarantula of the swamps. Ingra, followed by his\nman, sprang upon me like a tiger. In a twinkling I lay on my back, and\nbefore I could recover my feet, I saw Juba and Ingra in a deadly\nstruggle, while the other ran away and disappeared. Jumping up I ran to\nJuba's assistance, but the fight was so furious, and the combatants\nwhirled so rapidly, that I could get no hold. I saw, however, that Juba\nwas more than a match for his opponent, and I darted into the car to get\none of the automatic rifles, thinking that I could use it as a club to\nput an end to the struggle if the opportunity should offer. But the\nlocker was firmly closed and I could not open it. After a minute of vain\nefforts I returned to the combatants and found that Juba had nearly\ncompleted his mastery. He had Ingra doubled over his knee and was\nendeavoring to pinion his hands.\n\nAt this instant, when the victory seemed complete, and our enemy in our\npower, Juba uttered a faint cry and fell in a heap. Blood instantly\nstained the floor around him, and Ingra, with a bound, dropping a long\nknife, attained the door of a nearby chamber, and was out of sight before\nI could even start to pursue him. Nevertheless, I ran after him, but\nquickly became involved in a labyrinth where it was useless to continue\nthe search, and where I nearly lost my way.\n\nI then returned to see how seriously Juba had been wounded. He had\ncrawled into the car. I bent over him--he was dead! The knife had\ninflicted a fearful wound, and it seemed wonderful that he could have\nmade his way unassisted even over the short distance from where he was\nstruck down to the door of the car.\n\n_Juba dead!_ I felt faint and sick! But the critical nature of the\nemergency helped to steady my nerves by giving me something else to think\nof and to do. Edmund must be called at once. There were no \"elevators\"\nrunning regularly during the general hours of repose, and I did not know\nthe way up and down the tower by the ladder-like stairways which\nconnected the stages. But there were signals by which the little craft\nthat served as elevators could be summoned in case of necessity, and I\npulled one of the signal cords. It seemed an age before the air ship\ncame, and another before I could reach Edmund.\n\nHis great self-control enabled him to conceal his grief at my news, but\nJack was overcome. He had really loved Juba almost as if he had been\nhuman and a brother. The big-hearted fellow actually sobbed as if his\nheart would break. Then came the reaction, and I should never have\nbelieved that Jack Ashton could exhibit such malevolent ferocity. His\nlips all but foamed, as he fairly shouted, striking his big fists\ntogether:\n\n\"This'll be _my_ job! Edmund! Peter! You hear me! Don't either of you\ndare to lay a hand on _that devil!_ He's _mine!_ Oh! I'll--\" But he could\nnot finish his sentence for gnashing his teeth.\n\nWe calmed him as best we could and then summoned an air ship. While we\nwaited, Edmund suddenly put his hand in his pocket, and withdrawing it\nquickly, said, with a bitter smile:\n\n\"What a fool I have been in my carelessness. Ingra has had the key\nabstracted from my pocket by some thief. That explains how he got the car\nopen.\"\n\nThe moment the ship came we hurriedly ascended to the platform. When\nEdmund saw poor Juba's body lying in the car and learned how he had made\nhis way there to die, he was more affected than when he first heard of\nhis death.\n\n\"He has died for us,\" he said solemnly; \"he has crawled here as to a\nrefuge, and here he shall remain until I can bury him among his people in\nhis old home. Would to God I had never taken him from it!\"\n\n\"Then you will start at once for the dark hemisphere?\" I asked.\n\n\"At the earliest possible moment; and it shall be on the way to our own\nhome.\"\n\nBut we were not to depart before even a more terrible tragedy had\ndarkened over us, for now the tide of fate was suddenly running at flood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nTHE CORYBANTIA OF THE SUN\n\nI have several times mentioned Edmund's half-formed impression that there\nwas some very remarkable ceremony connected with the cyclical apparition\nof the sun before the eyes of its worshipers. He had said, you may\nrecall, that it seemed probable that the religious rites on these rare\noccasions bore some resemblance to the _bacchanalia_, or _dionysia_, of\nancient Greece. How he had derived that idea I do not know, but it proved\nto have been but too well founded---only he had not guessed the full\ntruth. The followers of Dionysus made themselves drunken with the wine of\ntheir god and then indulged in the wildest excesses. Here, as we were now\nto learn, the worshipers of the sun were seized with another kind of\nmadness, leading to scenes that I believe, and hope, have never had their\nparallel upon the earth.\n\nWith our hearts sore for Juba, we had completed our preparations for\ndeparture within six hours after his tragic death. Ala had been informed\nof the tragedy, and had visited the car and looked upon the dead form,\nwhich I thought greatly affected her. Edmund held little communication\nwith her, but it was evidently with her cooperation that he was able to\nprocure a kind of coffin, in which we placed Juba's body. I do not know\nwhether Edmund informed her of his purpose to quit the planet, but she\nmust have known that we were going to convey our friend somewhere for\ninterment.\n\nWe were actually on the point of casting loose the car, Ala and a crowd\nof attendants watching our movements, when there came the second great\nsound of united voices which we had heard in this speechless world. It\nrose like a sudden wail from the whole city. There was a rushing to and\nfro, Ala's face grew as pale as death, and her attendants fell upon their\nknees and began to lift their hands heavenward, with an expression of\nterror and wild appeal.\n\nAt the same time we noticed a sudden brightening about us, and Edmund\nstepping out on the platform, immediately beckoned, with the first signs\nof uncontrollable excitement that I had ever seen him display. I was\ninstantly at his side, and a single glance told the story.\n\nHigh in the heavens, the sun had burst forth in all its marvelous\nsplendor!\n\nA vast rift was open in the cloud dome, through which the gigantic god of\nday poured down his rays with a fierceness that was inconceivable. The\nheat was like the blast of a furnace, and I felt my head beginning to\nswim.\n\n\"Quick!\" cried Edmund, grasping my sleeve and pulling me into the car.\n\"These rays are fatal! My God, what a sight!\"\n\nAs by magic the atmosphere had become crowded with air ships, and throngs\nof thousands were pouring from them upon the great platform and the other\nstages, as well as upon the surrounding towers. Every available space was\nfilling up with people hastening from below. As fast as they arrived they\nthrew themselves into the most extraordinary postures of adoration,\nlifting hands and eyes to the sun. I remember thinking, in a flash, that\nthe intense glare of light must burn to the very sockets of their\neyes--but they did not flinch. It was evident, however, that those who\nlooked directly in the sun's face were blinded.\n\nI looked round for Ala, and noticed with a thrill that her beautiful eyes\nwere wide open and glancing with an expression that I cannot describe,\nover her kneeling people. Beside her was the towering form of the great\npriest, who was staring straight at the sun--and yet, although his eyes\nwere open, it was evident that they were not rendered altogether\nsightless even by that awful light. They burned like coals. He was making\nstrange gestures with his long arms, and in unison with his every\nmovement a low, heart-thrilling sound came from the throats of the\nmultitude.\n\nEdmund, at my shoulder, muttered under his breath:\n\n\"Shall I try to save her from this?--But to what good?\"\n\nFor a moment he seemed to hesitate, and I thought that he was about to\nrush out upon the platform and seize Ala in order to rescue her from some\ndanger that he foresaw; when, all at once, the multitude rose to its\nfeet, staggering, and began to rush to and fro, colliding with one\nanother, falling, rising again, grappling, struggling, uttering terrible\ncries--and then I saw the flash of knives.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" shouted Edmund. \"It is the ultraviolet rays! They have\ngone mad!\"\n\nIn the meantime the gigantic high priest whirled upon his heel, swinging\nhis arms abroad and uttering a kind of chant which was audible above the\ndreadful clamor of the rabid multitude. Though he had no weapon, he\nseemed the inspirer of this Aceldama, and around him its fury raged.\nPresently he drew close to Ala, who still stood motionless, as if\npetrified by the awful scene. I felt Edmund give a violent start, and\nbefore I comprehended his intention, he had dashed from the car, and was\nforcing his way through the struggling throng toward the queen.\n\n\"Edmund!\" I shouted. \"For God's sake, come back!\"\n\nJack started to follow him, but I held him back with all my strength.\n\n\"Let me go!\" he yelled. \"Edmund will be killed!\"\n\n\"And you, too!\" I answered. \"Break open the locker and get the guns!\"\n\nJack threw himself upon the door of the locker, and strove to wrench it\nopen. Meanwhile, half paralyzed with excitement, I remained standing at\nthe door. I saw Edmund hurl aside those who attacked him, and push on\ntoward his goal. But a minute later a knife reached him, and he fell.\n\n\"Quick, Jack, quick!\" I shouted; \"Edmund is down!\"\n\nHe had not got the locker open, but he darted to my side, and together we\nrushed out into the press. Shall I ever forget that moment! We were\npushed, hustled, struck, hurled to and fro; but we had only a few steps\nto go, and we reached our leader where he lay. Seizing him, we succeeded\nsomehow in carrying him into the car. Our clothes were torn, our hands\nand faces were bleeding, and there was blood on Jack's shoulder. Edmund\nwas alive. We placed him on a bench, and then the fascination of the\nspectacle without again enchained us.\n\nSuddenly my eyes fell upon Ingra, who had not previously made his\nappearance. He was as insane as the others, and like many of them had a\nknife in his hand. In a moment he pushed his way toward Ala, and my heart\nrose in my throat, for I did not know what mad thought might be in his\nmind. If I had had a weapon, I believe I should have shot him, but before\nhe had arrived within three yards of the queen there came an explosion of\nflame--I do not know how else to describe it, for it was so sudden--and\nthe great platform was instantly wrapped in licking tongues of fire.\n\nThe wickerwork caught like tinder, and the gauzy screws threw off streams\nof sparks like so many Fourth of July pinwheels. The gush of heat from\nthe conflagration was terrible, and I turned my eyes in horror from the\nstricken multitude which seemed to have been shocked back into sanity by\nthe sudden universal danger only to find itself a helpless prey to the\nflames.\n\n\"It's all over with them!\" cried Jack.\n\nHis words awoke me to our own danger. We must get away instantly. Knowing\nthe proper button to touch to throw the mechanism into action, I pushed\nit forcibly and pulled out a knob which I had often seen Edmund\nmanipulate in starting the car. It responded immediately, and in a second\nwe were afloat, and clear of the tower. Seeing that the direction which\nthe car was taking would remove us from the reach of the flames, and that\nthere was nothing ahead to obstruct its progress, and knowing that Edmund\noften left it to run of itself when the speed was slow, and there was no\noccasion to change its course, I now hurried with Jack to Edmund's side.\nHenry all this time had been lying on a bench like one in a trance.\n\nJack and I stripped off Edmund's coat, and at once saw the nature of his\nwound. A knife had penetrated his side, and there was considerable\neffusion of blood, but I was surgeon enough to feel sure that the wound\nwas not mortal. He roused up as he felt us working over him, and opening\nhis eyes, said faintly:\n\n\"You will find bandages under the locker. What has happened? We are\nmoving.\"\n\n\"The tower is all in flames!\" exclaimed Jack, before I could interrupt\nhim, for I should have preferred not to tell Edmund the real situation\njust at that moment.\n\nJack's words roused him like an electric shock. He pushed us aside, and\nstruggled to his feet. Then he sprang to a knob, and brought the car to\nrest.\n\nWe had been moving slowly, and had not gone more than a quarter of a mile\nfrom the tower. The car had swung round so that the fire was not visible\nfrom the open door, but now, as Edmund arrested its progress, it swayed\nback again and the spectacle burst into view. The heat smote us in the\nface even at this distance. In the few minutes since I had last seen the\ntower the flames had made incredible progress. The whole of the immense\nstructure was blazing. Spires of flame leaped and swayed from its summit,\npartitions were falling, platforms giving way, and hundreds of air ships\ncaught by the sheets of fire were crumpling and falling in swooping\ncurves like birds whose wings had been seared. I was thankful that we\ncould not see the unfortunates who were perishing in that furnace. It was\nbut too evident that not a soul on the tower could have escaped.\n\nI glanced at Edmund's face. It was pale and set--the face of a man gazing\nupon an awful tragedy with which he is absolutely powerless to interfere.\nHis breath came quick, but he did not utter a word. Then came the\nreaction, and, staggering, he leaned on my shoulder, and I led him to the\nbench from which he had risen. For a moment I thought he had fainted, but\nwhen I put a flask to his lips he swallowed a mouthful and immediately\nrecovered sufficient strength to sit up, resting his head on his hand.\n\n\"Had we not better go on?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ye-es,\" he replied, after a moment's hesitation. \"We can do nothing.\nThey are all gone; the queen has perished with the rest! Pull out that\nknob on the right, but gently, and then push this button. We must circle\nround the outskirts until we see whether the fire will seize upon the\nother towers and extend to the city below.\"\n\nI followed his directions, and, as we started our circuit, the vast tower\nsuddenly swayed aside, and then, tumbling in upon itself, it went down in\na whirl of smoke and eddying sparks.\n\nAs far as we could see none of the other aerial structures had caught\nfire. The entire absence of wind was no doubt the favorable circumstance\nthat saved them. But all the towers were swaying under the impulse\nimparted to them by the excited multitudes that crowded their platforms.\nAlthough the light of the conflagration faded as soon as the principal\ntower fell, the others continued to shine brilliantly in the solar rays,\nbut suddenly, as we watched, the splendor failed, and the subdued\nillumination characteristic of the endless daylight under the great dome\ntook its place. The rift in the clouds above had closed as unexpectedly\nas it had recently opened, and the sun was no longer visible. It had been\nin view less than an hour, but in that brief space what scenes had been\nenacted!\n\nPresently Edmund, shaking his head sadly, said:\n\n\"It is useless to stay longer. Even if the conflagration should spread we\ncould do nothing to help the unfortunates. They must depend upon\nthemselves.\"\n\nHe then gave me directions for changing our course to a direct line away\nfrom the city, at the same time increasing the speed. In the meantime he\nhimself aided in binding up his wound.\n\n\"If there were the slightest chance that Ala could have escaped,\" he\nsaid, after a few minutes, \"I would remain here, and search for her, but\nit is only too clear what her fate has been. She was really our only\nfriend, and now that she is gone, we must get away from the sight and\nmemory of these things as quickly as possible.\"\n\nSeeing that his strength was gradually coming back to him, and secretly\nrejoicing that he bore this terrible blow so stoically, I felt that we\nmight now converse about the catastrophe which we had witnessed.\n\n\"What do you think was the cause of the sudden outburst of fire?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"It could hardly have been the direct action of the sunlight,\" he\nreplied. \"It must have resulted from some accidental concentration of the\nsolar rays upon an inflammable substance by a mirror.\"\n\n\"I recall seeing a large concave glass on the principal platform in which\nthey were fond of looking at their magnified images,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, and no doubt that was the instrument chosen by fate to bring about\nthis terrible end. The power of the sunbeams is twice as great here as\nupon the earth, and the heat in the focus of a mirror a couple of feet in\ndiameter would suffice to set fire to the flimsy materials which abounded\non the tower. Once started in such a place it ran like sparks in a train\nof gunpowder.\"\n\n\"But the madness that seized the multitude before the catastrophe--what\ndid you mean by saying that it was the ultraviolet rays?\"\n\n\"I used the term,\" Edmund replied slowly, \"without attaching a very clear\nmeaning to it. It simply expressed the general thought that was in my\nmind. It may be some other form of solar radiation to which we are not\naccustomed on the earth, but which is specially effective here when the\nsun is uncovered because of the greater nearness of Venus. This\natmosphere, notwithstanding its density, may well be diaphanous to the\nultraviolet rays, owing to some peculiarity in its composition which I\nhave not had time to study. At any rate, it is evident, from what we have\nseen, that the rays of the unclouded sun almost instantly affect the\nbrain. I, myself, felt them as if a thousand needles had been thrust\nthrough my skull; and I believe that they are responsible, rather than\nthe shock of the wound in my side, for my present weakness.\"\n\n\"And did you foresee the consequences of the uncovering of the sun?\"\n\n\"Not altogether. I had been led to think that something extraordinary\nmust accompany the periodical appearances of the great orb, and if I\ncould have known that an apparition was at hand I might have made\npreparations for it and we might have been able to save Ala. When I saw\nwhat was going on, I tried to reach her, and you know the result.\"\n\n\"But is it not incredible that a people of so peaceable a disposition\nshould be seized with such murderous instincts when driven out of their\nsenses by the effect of the rays?\"\n\n\"No, it does not seem so to me. You know the general tendency of sudden\nmadness, which usually produces a complete reversal of the ordinary\ninstincts of the demented persons, making them dangerous to their dearest\nfriends. But why talk longer of this? It is too painful--too\noverwhelming. What can man do against the great forces of Nature? At this\nmoment I solemnly declare to you that I regret that I ever entered upon\nthis expedition.\"\n\nWhile we had been talking, the car had receded to a great distance from\nthe city, and now all but the tops of a few of the airy pinnacles were\nlost to our sight forever. But as we gazed, straining our sight for a\nlast look, we perceived a familiar flickering of prismatic lightning on\nthe horizon. We glanced at each other meaningly. It was the color speech\nagain. But, oh, what must be the burden of their communications now!\nSuddenly, Edmund, whose eyes were fixed with intensity upon the scene,\nremarked, half shuddering:\n\n\"It is the great Paean.\"\n\nSeized with curiosity, I pressed the magic box to my ear, and faintly\nthere echoed in my brain a few disconnected strains of that solemn music.\nBut now, more than ever, it was insufferable to me, and I dropped the box\nwith a crash.\n\nAs Edmund recovered his strength he once more took charge of the car, and\nin a little while he had risen to a great height in order to take\nadvantage of the easier going in the lighter atmosphere above. Thus we\nran on for several hours until we began to catch sight of the sea, which\nwas soon beneath us, while far ahead we saw the tumbling clouds marking\nthe location of the belt of tempests behind which we knew lay the range\nof the crystal mountains. At length we issued from beneath the cloud\ndome, and then we saw the sun again, and the storms whipping the waters,\nwhose waves occasionally flashed up at us through rifts in the streaming\nclouds beneath. And at last the icy peaks began to glitter on the\nhorizon, and we knew that we were nearing the world of eternal night and\nfrost. It was with strange feelings that we once more beheld the crystal\nmountains, for our minds were filled with the recollection of the scenes\nthat had occurred among them when we were helpless in the grasp of their\ntempests. But now there was a certain exhilaration in the thought that\nthis time we could safely sail over their summits. As we passed over them\nwe looked eagerly for landmarks that might show where our former passage\nhad occurred, and as Edmund purposely dropped as close to their summits\nas it was safe to go, I at last believed that I recognized the mighty\npeak of rainbows that had so nearly wrecked us.\n\nWhen we had left the mountains behind and entered into the region of\nnight, I asked Edmund how he would proceed in order to find the location\nof the caverns.\n\n\"I shall go by the stars,\" he said. \"I noted the bearing of the place,\nand I have no doubt that I can find it again.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTHE EARTH\n\nEdmund's reference to the stars instantly drew my attention to the\nheavens. They were ablaze with amazing gems, but at first I could not see\nthe earth among them.\n\n\"I know what you are looking for,\" said Edmund. \"Here, look through the\npeephole in the bow. From our present position the earth appears but\nlittle elevated above the horizon, but when we reach the caverns, which\nare in the center of the dark hemisphere, we shall see her overhead.\"\n\nI knelt at the peephole, and my heart was in my throat. There was our\nglorious planet, oh, so bright! and close beside her the moon. At the\nsight, an irrepressible longing arose in me to be once more at home. Jack\nand Henry took their turns at looking, and they were no less affected\nthan I had been. But Edmund retained a perfect self-command:\n\n\"Do you know,\" he asked with an odd smile (for now the lamps were\nglowing, and we had plenty of light in the car), \"how long we have been\nabsent from home?\"\n\nNot one of us had kept a record.\n\n\"It is just six hundred and four days,\" he continued, \"since we left New\nYork. We were sixteen days on our way to Venus; six days after our\narrival at the caverns occurred the conjunction of the earth, and the\nceremonies that Peter will not forget as long as he refrains from hair\ndye; two days later we departed for the sun lands; and since then five\nhundred and eighty days have passed. Now, between one conjunction of the\nearth and Venus to the next, five hundred and eighty-four days elapse.\nAlready five hundred and eighty-two of those days have passed, so that\nwithin two days another conjunction will occur, and if we are then at the\ncaverns we shall doubtless witness another sacrifice to the earth and the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"I feel as you do,\" said Edmund. \"We have seen enough of such things. In\norder, then, to hasten our arrival at the caverns, where we must bury\nJuba, for on that I insist, I am going to rise up out of the atmosphere,\nin order that we may fly with planetary speed. We can thus reach the\ncaverns, traversing the five thousand miles of distance that yet remain,\nin something like an hour, for some time must be lost in rising out of\nand returning into the atmosphere, and in the meantime I must make\nobservations to determine our location. Having found the caverns we will\ncomplete our rites at Juba's grave, and get away for good before the\nsacrificial ceremonies begin.\"\n\nIt was a programme that suited us all, and it was quickly carried out. I\nhad not thought that my admiration of Edmund's ability could be\nincreased, but it was carried a notch higher when I saw how easily,\nguiding himself by the ever-visible stars, he located the caverns. When\nhe knew that he was directly over them he dropped the car swiftly, and we\ncould not repress a cry as we saw directly beneath us the familiar shafts\nof light issuing from the ground.\n\n\"We may have to do a little searching,\" said Edmund, as we approached the\nlights, \"for, of course, my observations are not accurate enough to\nenable me to locate the exact spot where we landed before.\"\n\nBut fortune favored us marvelously, and the very first opening that we\napproached was at once recognized, for there stood the sacrificial altar.\n\nWe anchored the car near the shaft, and carried out Juba's coffin.\n\n\"Wait here,\" said Edmund, \"while I descend.\"\n\n\"No, you're not going alone,\" exclaimed Jack. \"I'll go with you.\"\n\nEdmund made no objection and he and Jack descended the steps. Half an\nhour elapsed before they returned, accompanied by a dozen of the natives,\nstolid, and not exhibiting the signs of surprise over our return which I\nhad expected to see. Edmund had now made so much progress in their\nstrange means of communication that he had little difficulty in causing\nthem to comprehend what was wanted. They easily carried the coffin, and\nall of us followed down into the depths. It was the strangest funeral\nprocession that ever a man saw!\n\nWhile the grave was being prepared in the underground cemetery where we\nhad witnessed the interment of the first victim of our pistols, Henry and\nI remained as a sort of guard of honor for Juba in the lower of the two\ngreat chambers which have been described in the earlier chapters of this\nhistory, and there a most singular thing occurred. We were startled by a\nlow whining, and looking about saw one of the doglike creatures which\nappeared to be the only inhabitants of the caverns except the natives\nseated on its haunches close to the coffin, and exhibiting exactly the\nsigns of distress that a dog sometimes displays over its dead master.\nThat we were taken aback by this scene I need not assure you. We had\nnever observed, during our former visit, that either Juba or any of his\npeople was followed by these creatures; in fact, they had always fled at\nour approach, and we had paid little attention to them.\n\nBut now, if the poor animal could have spoken, he could not more plainly\nhave told us that, by means of the mysterious instinct which beings of\nhis kind possess, he had recognized the presence of his old master, and\nwas mourning for him. It was truly a touching spectacle, and Henry was\nhardly less moved by it than I. When Edmund and Jack came back, having\nsuperintended the preparations, Jack was cut to the heart by the sight.\nImmediately he declared that the \"dog\" must accompany us in the car, and\nEdmund assented by a grave inclination of the head. The animal followed\nus to the grave, and remained there watching us intently. He seemed to\nhave dismissed his fear, as if he comprehended that we were friends of\nhis master.\n\nThere were not more than twenty of the natives present at the interment,\nand none of them showed signs of sorrow. And when the grave was closed\nand we turned away, the little creature followed at our heels. Edmund had\ncarved on a flat stone the word \"JUBA,\" and left it lying on the grave,\nand Jack, having nothing else, threw a silver dollar on top of it. The\nnatives probably regarded these things as talismans, or religious\nsymbols, for they treated them with the greatest deference, and no doubt\nthey lie there yet, and will continue to lie there through all the eons,\nfor in those dry caverns the progress of decay can hardly be perceptible\neven after the passage of ages. It was a singular fact, noted by Edmund,\nthat the natives exhibited not the slightest curiosity concerning their\ncomrades who had been lost in the crystal mountains, and I really doubt\nwhether they knew what the coffin contained.\n\nWhen we had paid the last honors to Juba, we began to think of our final\ndeparture. This place had become disagreeable to us. After the brilliant\nscenes that we had witnessed on the other side of the planet, the gloom\nhere, and the absence of all that had made the land of perpetual daylight\nseem a paradise of beauty, were intensely oppressive to our spirits. But\nEdmund still wished to make some investigations, and we were compelled to\nawait his movements. What the nature of his investigations was I do not\nknow, for I was devoured by the desire to get away, and did not inquire.\nBut fully twenty-four hours had elapsed before our leader was ready to\ndepart. In the meanwhile \"Juba's dog\" had become firmly attached to Jack,\nwho petted it as probably no creature of its race had ever been petted\nbefore. It was a strange-looking animal; about as large as a terrier,\nwith a big square head, covered with long black hair, while, in startling\nimitation of the hirsute adornment of the natives themselves, its body\nwas clothed with a golden-white pelt of silky texture. It would eat\nanything we offered it, and seemed immensely pleased with its new master,\nas it had every reason for being.\n\nDuring the last hours of our stay we noticed unmistakable indications of\npreparation for the dreaded ceremonies of the conjunction, and our\ndeparture was hastened on that account. The priests, whom Edmund had been\ncompelled to put out of the way of further mischief on the former\noccasion, had been replaced by others, and we thought that, perhaps, this\nbeing the first opportunity for the display of their functions, they\nwould try to make it memorable--which presented a still stronger reason\nwhy we should not delay. But, with one thing and another, we were held\nback until the very eve of the ceremonies.\n\nWhen we finally stood ready to enter the car, with Juba's dog at Jack's\nheels, the procession up the steps had already begun. Edmund decided to\nwait until the multitude had all assembled. They came trooping up into\nthe starlight, and I am sure that they had no idea of what we intended to\ndo. Undoubtedly they must have recalled what had happened on the other\noccasion, but they showed no sign of either regret or anxiety on that\naccount. They arranged themselves in a dense circle, as before, and the\npriests took their place in the center. At this moment Edmund gave the\nword to enter the car. We sprang into it, and immediately Jack and I went\nout on a window ledge in order to get a better view of the scene. Edmund\nstarted the car, and we rose straight toward the earth which glowed in\nthe zenith. Our movement was unexpected, and we at once arrested the\nattention even of the priests. The beginning of the ceremony was stopped\nshort. All eyes were evidently drawn to us, and when they saw the\ndirection that we were taking a low murmur arose.\n\n\"Let me give them a parting salute,\" said Jack.\n\nEdmund thought a moment, and then said:\n\n\"Very well, take a gun, but don't fire at them. If it terrifies them into\nabandoning their sacrifice we shall have done one good thing in this\nworld.\"\n\nJack instantly had the gun roaring, and although we were now high above\ntheir heads, we could see that they were seized with consternation,\nrising from their knees, and running wildly about. Whether the noise and\nthe sight of us flying toward the earth, had the effect which Edmund had\nhoped for, will never be known; but the last sight we had of living\nbeings on Venus was the spectacle of those white forms darting about in\nthe starry gloom.\n\nOur long journey home was interrupted by one more almost tragic episode.\nWhen we had been ten days in flight, and the earth had become like a\nround moon of dazzling brilliance, Juba's dog, which had grown feeble and\nrefused to eat, died. Jack was broken-hearted, and protested when Edmund\nsaid that the body of the animal must be thrown out. He would have liked\nto try to stuff the skin, but Edmund was firm.\n\n\"But if you open a window,\" I said, \"the air will escape.\"\n\n\"Some of it will undoubtedly escape,\" Edmund replied. \"But, luckily, this\nis the air of Venus which we are carrying, and being very dense, we can\nspare a little of it without serious results. I shall be quick, and there\nwill be no danger.\"\n\nIt was as he had said. When the window was partially opened, for only a\nsecond or two, we distinctly felt a lowering of the atmospheric pressure\nthat made us gasp for a moment, but instantly Edmund had the window\nclosed again, and we were all right. As we shot away we saw the little\nwhite body gleaming in the sunlight like a thistledown, and then it\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"It is a new planet born,\" said Edmund, \"and the law of gravitation will\npay it as much attention as if it were a Jupiter. It may wander in space\nfor untold ages, and sometime it may even fall within the sphere of the\nearth's attraction, and then Jack's wish will have been fulfilled; but it\nwill be but a flying spark, flashing momentarily in the heavens as it\nshoots through the air.\"\n\n       *      *       *       *       *\n\nOur home-coming was a strange one. For some reason of his own Edmund did\nnot wish to take the car to New York. He landed in the midst of the\nAdirondack woods, far from any habitation, and there, concealed in a\nswamp, he insisted upon leaving the car. We made our way out of the\nwilderness to the nearest railway station, and our first care was to\nvisit a barber and a clothing merchant. Probably, as we carried some of\nthe guns, they took us for a party of hunters who wished to furbish up\nbefore revisiting civilization.\n\nOn reaching New York, we went, in the evening, straight to the Olympus\nClub, where our arrival caused a sensation. We found Church in the old\ncorner, staring dejectedly at a newspaper. He did not see who was\napproaching him. Jack slapped him on the shoulder, and as he looked up\nand recognized us he fell back nearly fainting, and with mouth open,\nunable to utter a word.\n\n\"Come, old man,\" said Jack, \"so we've found you! What did you run away\nfor? Let me introduce you to the Columbus of Space, and don't you forget\nthat I'm one of his lieutenants.\"\n\nI don't think that Church has ever fully believed our story. He thinks,\nto this day, that we lost our \"balloon,\" as he calls it, and invented the\nrest. We purposely allowed the newspaper reporters to take the same view\nof the case, but when we four were alone we unburdened our hearts, and\nrelived the marvelous life of Venus. I use the past tense, because I have\nyet to tell you most disquieting news.\n\nEdmund has disappeared.\n\nWithin three months after our return he bade us good night at an\nunusually early hour and we have never seen him since, although more than\na year has now elapsed since he went out of the room at the Olympus. Jack\nand I have made every effort to find a trace of him, without avail. Led\nby a natural suspicion, we have ransacked the Adirondack woods, but we\ncould never satisfy ourselves that we had found the place where the car\nwas left. Henry persists in the belief that Edmund is trying in secret to\ndevelop his invention, with the intention of \"revolutionizing industry\nand making himself a multibillionaire.\" But Jack and I know better!\nWherever he may be, whatever may occupy his wonderful powers, we feel\nthat the ordinary concerns of the earth have no interest for him. Yet we\nare sure that if he is alive he often thinks of us.\n\nLast night as Jack and I were walking to the club with my completed\nmanuscript under my arm, a falling star shot across the sky.\n\n\"Do you know what that recalls to me?\" asked Jack, with a far-off\nexpression in his eyes.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Juba's dog.\"\n\nNeither of us spoke again before we reached the clubhouse steps, but I am\ncertain that through both our minds there streamed a glittering\nprocession of such memories as life on this planet could never give birth\nto. And they ended with a sigh.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Columbus of Space, by Garrett P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
