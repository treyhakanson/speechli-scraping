I let myself into the apartment, which\nhad an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown\ntemperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but\naccording to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got\ndressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my\nwife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.\n\nWhat do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumed\nthe carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! The\nashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the\nplace looked wife-deserted.\n\nIt had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'd\nhad to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I\nwrite for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella\nwhen I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost\ntropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a\nwoman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.\n\n\"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said.\n\n\"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go\non grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac.\nYou'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\"\n\nIf possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over\nmy hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held\nme up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,\njust in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one\nwhich exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing\nhappened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain\nhad stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where\nthey were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the\nusual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular,\na man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay.\nWhile I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was\nable to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size\nof an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight,\nand then his chattering drill hit it.\n\nThere was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on\nhis back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the\nmoment of the explosion--if so feeble a thing can be called one--I\nfelt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my\nhand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the\nbleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some\npink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I\nfound that I had missed the story conference.\n\nDuring the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase \"I'm just\nspitballing\" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite,\n\"The whole ball of wax,\" twelve times. However, my story had been\naccepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the\nconference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World,\nthe Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which\nrung of the ladder you have achieved.\n\nThe subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the\napartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing\nthere talking to the doorman.\n\nHe said, \"Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it\nat your office building.\" I looked blank and he explained, \"We just\nheard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed\nat the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it.\"\n\nAnything can happen in advertising, I thought. \"That's right, Danny, I\njust missed it,\" I said, and went on in.\n\nPsychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the\nother hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and\nexcept for the alarm clock, I'd had no control over what had been going\non.\n\nI went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the\ndirections Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until\nshe got back from her mother's in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days.\nHow to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and\nsuch. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced\nthat I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the\nreasons she supposes.\n\nI opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: \"When\nyou take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door,\ntoo.\"\n\nIntimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in\nfront of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate\nme from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.\nWhen I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the\nmanuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The\npencil was standing on its end.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear\nabout, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank\nsome of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the\nmuggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter\nto try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last\nsentence.\n\nDamn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.\nMy drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's\nnotes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed\none that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: \"Garbage\npicked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I\nlove you.\" What can you do when the girl loves you?\n\nI made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window\nat the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was\nexercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be\nallowed to perch, but were not allowed to.\n\nPigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that\ntheir wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking\nabout this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn,\nthey seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all\nwanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and\nfell.\n\nThe man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and\npicked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,\nstroking its feathers.\n\nMy speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were\ninterrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is\nusually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like\nan incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that\nof my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has\nnever, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late\nafternoon.\n\n\"You can't say a thing like that to me!\" I heard him shout. \"I tell you\nI got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started\nto play!\"\n\nSeveral other loud voices started at the same time.\n\n\"Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!\"\n\n\"Yeah, and only when you were dealer!\"\n\nThe tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the\ndoor to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting\nhim, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the\nimpulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he\nlooked stunned.\n\n\"Here!\" he said, holding out a deck of cards, \"For Pete's sake, look at\n'em yourselves if you think they're marked!\"\n\nThe nearest man struck them up from his hand. \"Okay, Houdini! So\nthey're not marked! All I know is five straight....\"\n\nHis voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards\non the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the\nrest face up--all red.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomeone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and\nthe four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence,\ngot in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly\narranged cards.\n\n\"Judas!\" he said, and started to pick them up. \"Will you look at that!\nMy God, what a session....\"\n\nI helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it,\nbut I had an idea what I would hear.\n\nAfter a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.\n\n\"Never seen anything to equal it,\" he said. \"Wouldn't have believed\nit. Those guys _didn't_ believe it. Every round normal, nothing\nunusual about the hands--three of a kind, a low straight, that sort\nof thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be _my_\ndeal. Brother! Straight flush to the king--every time! And each time,\nsomebody else has four aces....\"\n\nHe started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There\nwas one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top\nbroke and glass chips got into the bottle.\n\n\"I'll have to go down for more soda,\" I said.\n\n\"I'll come, too. I need air.\"\n\nAt the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in\nwhat must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the\ntop of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the\ntile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from\nat least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and\nI was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth\nopen and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his\nmouth open.\n\nOn the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie\nhis shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi\nswerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded,\nits rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign\ncars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any\nside-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to\nrest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that\nmoment.\n\nThe sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and\nthe taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged\ncrosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either\nforward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi\nto a lamp.\n\nAlthough rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at\nall, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues.\nEveryone was honking his horn.\n\nDanny was furious--more so when he tried to put through a call to his\nstation house from the box opposite.\n\nIt was out of order.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUpstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the\nwindows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had\nbrightened up considerably.\n\n\"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said.\n\"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned\nand nodded toward the pandemonium.\n\nWhen he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk\nlamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except\none. That was tied in three knots.\n\nAll _right_, I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had\ncome for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call\nMcGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university\nuptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he\nknows everything.\n\nWhen I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,\n_more_ trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's\nvoice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were\nconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for\nyou to work on.\"\n\n\"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly--\"\n\n\"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\"\n\n\"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\n\nWhile I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of\nmy novel--perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a\npoint where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it\nwas too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\n\"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to\nthe side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\n\nThis was absolutely not my day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" McGill said, \"nothing you've told me is impossible or\nsupernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against\nthat poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him.\nIt's all those other things....\"\n\nHe got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight\nwhile I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.\n\n\"Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at\nwhat I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely,\nand the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that\nyou're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.\" I started\nto get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. \"I know, but don't\nyou see that that is far more likely than....\" He stopped and shook\nhis head. Then he brightened. \"I have an idea. Maybe we can have a\ndemonstration.\"\n\nHe thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. \"Have you any\nchange on you?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" I said. \"Quite a bit.\" I reached into my pocket. There\nmust have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. \"Do you think\nthey'll each have the same date, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Did you accumulate all that change today?\"\n\n\"No. During the week.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you\ncould have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that\nwould be _actually_ impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll\ntell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if\nthey all come up heads.\"\n\nI moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the\nfloor. They clattered and bounced--and bounced together--and stacked\nthemselves into a neat pile.\n\nI looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a\nhandful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.\n\nThese coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,\nthe adjacent ones touching.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"what more do you want?\"\n\n\"Great Scott,\" he said, and sat down. \"I suppose you know that\nthere are two great apparently opposite principles governing the\nUniverse--random and design. The sands on the beach are an example\nof random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions\nof the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so\nmany of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of\nThermodynamics--quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;\nit's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other\nhand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes\nagainst it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental\nmanifestation.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" I asked in some confusion, \"that some form of life is\ncontrolling the coins and--the other things?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. All I mean is that improbable things usually\nhave improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,\nI don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the\nbook of rules. Something--I don't know what--is going on, and it seems\nto involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you\nstill in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?\"\n\n\"I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left.\"\n\n\"Hm. You're the center, all right. But why?\"\n\n\"Center of what?\" I asked. \"I feel as though I were the center of an\nelectrical storm. Something has it in for me!\"\n\nMcGill grinned. \"Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be\nanthropomorphic.\"\n\n\"Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life.\"\n\n\"On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are\nbeing rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it's a\nnon-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder.\" He had a faraway,\nfrowning look.\n\nI was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off.\n\n\"Let's go out and eat,\" I said, \"There's not a damn thing in the\nkitchen and I'm not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee.\"\n\nWe put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we\ncould hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were,\nby this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we\nheard one of them say to Danny, \"I don't know what the hell's going\non around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it.\nThey can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen\nanything like it.\"\n\nNear us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they\ntried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let\nthe other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had\nembarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were\nreplaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.\n\n\"All right, smart guy!\" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,\nonly to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches\nwhich met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts\never witnessed--a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything\nelse, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical\nexcuses and threats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDanny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right,\nMr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don't know what's going on around here, but\never since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\"\nhe shouted--he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over\nhere!\"\n\nThree women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas\nintertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over\nfenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the\nladies seemed not to be.\n\n\"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my\numbrella and we'll say no more about it!\"\n\n\"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\n\nThe third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also\ncaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the\nother two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,\nbut the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was\nMolly. My nurse-wife.\n\n\"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all\nright?\" Was _I_ all right!\n\n\"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to\nthink.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm all right. But why....\"\n\n\"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's\nnumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced\nand it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a\nbusy signal. Oh, dear, are you _sure_ you're all right?\"\n\nI put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.\nThen I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast\nto it.\n\n\"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\n\nWhen we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\n\"And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.\"\n\nHe did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was\na jump ahead of him.\n\n\"In other words, you think it's something organic?\"\n\n\"Well,\" McGill said, \"I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.\nI'm not doing so well,\" he confessed.\n\n\"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it's mere probability, and\nwithout any over-all pattern.\"\n\n\"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMolly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. \"Do you\n_feel_ all right, darling?\" she asked me. I nodded brightly. \"You'll\nthink this silly of me,\" she went on to McGill, \"but why isn't it\nsomething like an overactive poltergeist?\"\n\n\"Pure concept,\" he said. \"No genuine evidence.\"\n\n\"Magnetism?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't\nmagnetic--and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,\nand a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has\nmainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,\nall you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of\niron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay\nthere, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than\nthat--they go on moving.\"\n\n\"Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?\"\n\n\"Only an analogy,\" said McGill. \"A crystal resembles life in that it\nhas a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree\nthis--thing--has no discernible shape and motion _is_ involved, but\nplants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but\nit does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a\nnon-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and\nit has a nucleus and it seems to be growing--at least in what you might\ncall improbability.\"\n\nMolly frowned. \"Then what _is_ it? What's it made of?\"\n\n\"I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about\nthe atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to\nbe forming around a nucleus not of its own material--the way a speck\nof sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of\ncrystallization.\"\n\n\"Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,\" Molly said, and gave me an\nimpertinent look.\n\n\"Why,\" I asked McGill, \"did you say the coins couldn't have the same\ndate? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way.\"\n\n\"Because I don't think this thing got going before today and\neverything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions\nhere and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would\nrequire retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book.\nThat telephone now--\"\n\nThe doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone\nrepairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.\n\n\"I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister,\" he said with strong\ndisapproval.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I said. \"Is it broken?\"\n\n\"Not exactly _broken_, but--\" He shook his head and took it apart some\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally\nthe man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried\nto explain to me what had happened with the phone.\n\n\"You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the\nreceiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open.\"\n\n\"But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long\ntime! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her\nnearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay.\"\n\n\"Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the\nfloor--something like that--just happened to cause the right induction\nimpulses. Yes, I know how you feel,\" he said, seeing my expression.\n\"It's beginning to bear down.\"\n\nMolly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was\nso pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.\n\n\"I'm in no mood to cook,\" she said. \"Let's get away from all this.\"\n\nMcGill raised an eyebrow. \"If all this, as you call it, will let us.\"\n\nIn the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.\n\n\"I've been put on the story--who could be better?--I live here. So far,\nI don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,\nbut he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in\nsome mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?\"\n\n\"He's got a theory,\" said Molly. \"Come and eat with us and he'll tell\nyou all about it.\"\n\nSince we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth\nAvenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than\nbefore and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,\nand when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the\nlieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.\n\n\"If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham,\" Danny said, \"it's at the\nstation house. What there's left of it, that is.\"\n\nMolly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt\nthe speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of\ncigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I\nhappened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before\nI could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the\nsidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but\nsaid nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool--although it\ndidn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door\nand ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the\nnext table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green\nevening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter\nreturned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold\ncuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait\nfor the fat lady.\n\nI tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used\ninstead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and\nmade faces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to\nthe bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted\none of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled\nexpression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a\nrow of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.\n\nThat is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing\ncame out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again.\nStill nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his\npick, his face pink with exasperation.\n\nI had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice _is_ a\ncrystal, I thought to myself.\n\nThe other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing\nhappened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar\ncrowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back,\nbaffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the\nkitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls,\nwhich he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had\ngrown larger.\n\nMolly lit a cigarette and said, \"I suppose this is all part of it,\nAlec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here.\"\n\nIt was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter--a background noise\nhad stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of\nthe air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made\na gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her\ncigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring\nvichyssoise.\n\n\"Hey! What's the idea?\" snarled the sour-looking man.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry,\" I said. \"It was an accident. I--\"\n\n\"Throwing cigarettes at people!\" the fat lady said.\n\n\"I really didn't mean to,\" I began again, getting up. There must have\nbeen a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff\nbuttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely\nset tables, I pulled everything--tablecloth, silver, water glasses,\nashtrays and the vichyssoise-\u00e0-la-nicotine--onto the floor.\n\nThe fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man\nlicked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The\nowner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us\nwith a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I\nwas outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the waiters came up to the owner and tapped him on the shoulder\nand started to tell him about the air-conditioner, thus creating a\nmomentary diversion, which did not, however, include the fat lady.\n\n\"He must be drunk!\" she told her companion, who nodded contemptuously.\nA man carrying a stepladder came down the aisle from the back, his eye\non the air-conditioner, but not, it seemed, on the stepladder, which\nbumped the owner of the restaurant on the shoulder just as he was\nturning back to me.\n\nIt was not a hard bump, but it threw him off balance, so that he more\nor less embraced the waiter. Then he turned around and it was obvious\nhe thought I had struck him. The room was now divided into two groups:\nourselves and our audience, and those who were too far away or intent\non other matters to have noticed the fracas, the chief of these being\nthe man with the stepladder, who was paying undivided attention to the\nair-conditioner. The owner was very angry with me.\n\n\"Mister, I think _you'd_ better leave!\" he said.\n\n\"He will not!\" Molly said. \"It was an accident, and _you_,\" she added\nto the fat lady who was about to interrupt, \"keep quiet! We'll buy you\nsome more soup!\"\n\n\"Maybe it was an accident like you say,\" the owner declared, \"but no\none's going to push me when my back is turned! Out you go, mister! The\ndrinks are on the house.\"\n\n\"We haven't had any drinks yet,\" I said. \"There was salt in them.\"\n\n\"What d'you mean, salt? My bartenders--\"\n\nThe air-conditioner suddenly let out a loud whirring and I glanced\nup. The stepladder which the man was on began to slide open like an\nacrobatic dancer doing a split. I stepped past the angry restaurateur\nand put out my hand to stop it, but as I did, the extension-bar that\nwas supposed to hold it together parted and it came down with a rush,\nknocking over several tables. The repairman pulled part of the works\nout with him as he fell and the fan-belt broke. The motor raced and\nblack smoke poured out.\n\n\"What're you trying to _do_!\" the owner yelled at me over the loud\nwhine of the machinery. \"Goddam it, haven't you done _enough_ already?\"\n\nI took two steps back, in dismay at what I was accused of, and stepped\non the skirt of the fat lady's green evening gown. She in turn took two\nsteps and was, as it were, laid bare.\n\nThe previous hubbub was as nothing to what now resulted and the smoke\nwas becoming thicker. Then the door opened and, to my horror, Danny and\nhis lieutenant came in, and I was the first thing their eyes fastened\non. Everyone started shouting at once and pointing at me.\n\nThen the sprinkler system went on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cell was clean, although very hot, and I was not treated badly.\nThere was, in fact, an air of superstitious respect, almost. A cop gave\nme some magazines and, against regulations, a late paper, but it was\nnot late enough to carry the story of the restaurant mob-scene. In it,\nhowever, was a garbled account of our traffic jam and a reference to\nthe six elevators simultaneously and unaccountably stuck in the I.T.V.\nBuilding, but no connection was suggested.\n\nMy mind was in too much of an uproar to read, and I paced up and\ndown. It seemed hours since McGill had called my lawyer Vinelli; some\nfantastic mishap must be holding him up, I thought. Then I happened to\nbump into the door of the cell and found the lock hadn't caught.\n\nMore of the same! But there didn't seem any point in trying to escape.\nWhere would I go? Besides, I would have to leave through the desk room,\nwhere there would be at least the desk lieutenant and a sergeant on the\nphone. I began to wonder what effect it would have if I were to call\nout and tell them.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by a blast from the\nradio in the squad room. It died down immediately; someone must have\nhit a loud spot on the dial. I had an idea.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted again, and again was drowned out. I opened the barred\ndoor and looked up and down the corridor. No one was in sight. Without\nmaking any unnecessary noise, but not stealthily, either, I walked as\nnaturally as I could past the door to the squad room, where all heads\nwere turned away, listening to the sensational pronouncements of Bill\nBart, the radio gossip.\n\n\"... and in your commentator's view, this man is dangerous! After\nattacking a woman and setting fire to a restaurant, he was arrested and\nis being held for investigation, but I predict that the double-domes\nand alleged scientists will come up with some more gobbledegook and\nwe ordinary citizens will be left in the dark as to why or how Graham\nis causing all this trouble. So far, fortunately, no one has been\nseriously injured, but I predict....\"\n\nI left and went on down the corridor.\n\nSo Bill Bart was giving me a play! What kind of crazy guess-work was\nhe foisting on his public, I wondered, and came to the desk room.\nI looked in at the door. On one side, a sergeant was talking to an\nelderly worried-looking couple and never turned his head. On the other,\na gray-haired lieutenant sitting at the raised desk dropped his glasses\nas I came in. They fell on the floor and smashed.\n\n\"Mother of God!\" he muttered and gave me a cursory glance. \"Good night,\nDoctor,\" he said. \"Not that there's anything good about it.\" He was\nfumbling in the desk as I walked out of the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the other side of the street, in the shadows, was a man who crossed\nover as I came down the steps. It was McGill.\n\n\"I had a hunch this might happen,\" he said, taking my arm. \"The car's\nup ahead. Vinelli came here as quick as he could, but he slipped coming\nalong the street and broke his ankle.\"\n\n\"Judas!\" I said. \"I _am_ sorry! I feel responsible. Where are we going?\"\n\nHe didn't answer me at first; he just kept hurrying me along. One of\nthose New York siroccos was pretending to cool the city, and at the\ncorner I saw his old coupe with the parking lights on. A saloon next to\nus was closing up and a few late customers came out onto the sidewalk.\nOne customer, on seeing me, stopped and turned to the others.\n\n\"That's the guy I was telling you about! That's Graham!\"\n\nI saw then that it was our telephone repairman from the afternoon. He\nlooked reasonably sober, but his friends did not.\n\n\"Oh, yeah?\" one of these said, eying me belligerently. \"I thought we\njust heard Bill Bart broadcast the cops had him.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said another of them. \"He's escaped! I'll hold him and you go\non in and phone 'em.\"\n\n\"Nah, the joint's closed. Police station's right around the corner.\nI'll go tell 'em. Hold onto him now!\"\n\nThe repairman and three of his pals began to advance warily and the\nother one ran down Charles Street, but at that moment we heard excited\nyapping and a small dog chasing a cat came tearing up the street. The\ncat had a fish head in its mouth and, ignoring us, ran through the\nmiddle of the group, dropping the fish head. The dog followed almost\ninstantly, only he ran between the repairman's legs, upsetting him.\nIn falling, the repairman tripped his neighbor, who fell on him, and\nanother one fell on top of them. The remaining one stepped on the fish\nhead.\n\n\"Black cat!\" he cried as he joined the others on the sidewalk. \"Crossed\nmy path!\"\n\nWe got into McGill's car and he pulled away fast. As I looked back, the\nfour men were flailing around, but they saw the direction we took. I\nalso thought I saw the street lamp behind us go out.\n\n\"That was a lucky break!\" I said. \"I mean the cat and dog.\"\n\n\"Don't give it a thought,\" McGill said, driving fast but carefully up\nHudson Street. \"You're being watched over and protected. We're going up\nto my office and have a conference and we're going to drive like hell.\nI have an idea this thing may not be able to do much more than hang\nonto you. Maybe we can even shake it.\"\n\n\"Hang onto me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you're the nucleus.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were at the top of the ramp to the Westside Highway and he abruptly\nput on more speed: no traffic was in sight.\n\n\"But what is it?\" I asked a little wildly. \"How's it doing it? Why pick\non me?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I'd say it picked you as the nucleus because you had\njust been the subject of various flukes--the taxi and subway and so\non--so you represented a sample of what it's made of--flukes. I have a\nhunch you'll continue to be protected.\"\n\n\"Did you happen to catch Bill Bart's broadcast?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did. On the car radio coming over. Not good. He said--\"\n\nIn the rear-view mirror, I saw a police car overhauling us. We were\ndoing a good sixty-five. \"Here come the cops,\" I interrupted, but\nbefore McGill could answer, there was a faint pop and the police car\nwobbled and slowed to a stop, and was quickly out of sight.\n\n\"Blowout,\" I said.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" McGill answered, and turned on two wheels into the\n125th Street exit. Then he added, \"Molly's waiting for us in my office.\"\n\nI felt better.\n\nWe drove through some immortal gateway and McGill moderated his speed.\nHe pulled up in front of a darkened building and we climbed the steps.\nIt seemed cooler here and the wind was very strong. McGill tried the\ndoor, but it was locked. Then he felt in his pocket and swore.\n\n\"No key?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head and then shook the door, and went through his pockets\nagain. I reached forward and shook the door, too. The lock clicked\nand we went in. I made an apologetic gesture and McGill raised his\neyebrows.\n\nWe climbed a flight of stairs, all dark except for a faint glow that\ncame in from the campus lights, and then along an echoing hallway to\nan office in which were Molly and some unimportant items, among them a\ndesk radio that she turned off as we came in.\n\nShe gave me her professional nurse's smile and I sat down next her.\nMolly's professional nurse's smile is not a phony \"Everything's going\nto be all right,\" but a signal. It's supposed to mean \"Never mind what\nthese cretins are saying about you. You're okay.\"\n\nI was a little puzzled that she showed no surprise to see me.\n\n\"Well,\" McGill said, \"my hunch was right. He got out.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" said Molly, smiling at me proudly. \"What happened? Knock\nover one of the jailers?\"\n\nI shook my head and told her, including the cat-and-dog episode and the\npolice car blowout.\n\n\"Don't forget the lock downstairs,\" McGill said, and when I told her\nthat, too, he added, \"You see, I think it's beginning to take sides. I\nthink it's watching out for its nucleus. Alec ought to be rather lucky\nright now.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't feel it,\" I said. \"I feel hemmed in.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMolly glanced at me anxiously and turned back to him. \"What do we do\nnow?\"\n\n\"First, before any more funny stuff happens, I want to rig up a few\ntests and see what's with Alec, if anything. I'll even test for EMF,\nMolly, just for the sake of satisfying you.\"\n\n\"For what?\" I asked.\n\n\"Electromagnetic force. Come and give me a hand, Molly. Alec, you stay\nput and relax. We'll call you when we get set. I only hope to God the\ncops and the news-hawks don't tumble to where we are.\"\n\nThey left and I went to the window and looked out at the wind blowing\npapers and dust into miniature tornadoes in the dim light, and wondered\nwhether it was going to storm. A few belated students on the way to\ntheir dormitories evidently were wondering the same thing, for they\nwere all looking up at the sky. I went to the desk and turned the radio\non, low.\n\n\"... are doing all they can, which doesn't seem much,\" Bill Bart was\nsaying breathlessly. \"He was last seen speeding uptown on the Westshore\nDrive, but the cops lost him. The town is gripped in superstitious\nfear--it is now known that Graham was responsible for the elevators\njamming in the I.T.V. Building this morning--but how did he do it?\nI ask you: how? And how has he turned off all the electric power in\nGreenwich Village? I contacted the power company for an explanation,\nbut I was put off with the usual doubletalk. I say, and I repeat, _this\nman must be caught_! He is....\"\n\nI turned him off. So that was what the street light going off had meant.\n\nIn a little while, Molly came back. \"All right, duck, come and be\nmeasured. He's got galvanometers and electronic devices and stuff,\nand he'll be able to detect anything you're emanating down to a\nmilli-micro-whisker.\"\n\nI followed her into the lab where I was sat down, taped up and\nsurrounded with gadgets. McGill tried various things and read various\ndials. There were buzzing sounds and little lights blinked on and off,\nbut at the end he shook his head.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he announced, \"You're married to a non-ferrous,\nnon-conducting, non-emanating, non-magnetic writer, Molly.\"\n\n\"He is, too!\" she said. \"He's as magnetic as the dickens.\"\n\n\"Possibly, but he isn't emanating anything. The damn thing apparently\njust likes him. As a nucleus, I mean.\"\n\n\"Is that bad?\" Molly asked. \"Could it be dangerous?\"\n\n\"It's bad,\" I put in morosely.\n\n\"Also it could be good,\" McGill said, with a gleam of scientific\nenthusiasm, \"Why, it wouldn't surprise me, Alec, if you could do\nanything you wanted to that involved chance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI didn't like the guinea-pigs'-eye view of him I got, and told him so.\n\"Except for a couple of minor escapes, it's been highly inconvenient,\"\nI said. \"I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I wish it would go and\nhelp somebody else.\"\n\n\"But, my God, man! Do you realize if you went to the track tomorrow,\nyour horse probably couldn't lose?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't get that far,\" I grumbled.\n\n\"And I bet if somebody threw a knife at you, it would miss!\" McGill\nwent on, ignoring me. \"Here, I'd like to try an experiment....\"\n\n\"Now, hold on!\" I said.\n\n\"_McGill!_ Are you _crazy_?\" Molly cried, but he ignored her also and\nopened his desk drawer, from which he took a pair of dice.\n\n\"Roll me some sevens, Alec,\" he said, handing them to me.\n\n\"I thought we came here for a conference,\" I protested. \"And I don't\nknow whether you know about it, but there's been a Village-wide\nelectric power failure and I'm being blamed, according to Bill Bart.\"\n\n\"Holy cow! When did you hear that?\"\n\n\"On your radio just now. Furthermore, he says the whole town is\ngripped in 'superstitious terror.'\"\n\n\"That could be true,\" McGill answered. \"Most people haven't progressed\nbeyond the Dark Ages. Look what happened with Orson Welles' broadcast\nabout the Martians.\"\n\n\"Maybe we ought to leave town for a while.\" Molly said. \"We could go to\nOyster Bay or somewhere.\" Then she glanced up. \"What's that noise?\"\n\nOutside, I now noticed, mingled with the soughing of the wind, a\nsusurrus of many voices. We went to the lab windows. A crowd of two or\nthree hundred people was standing in the campus, staring up at the sky\nover us.\n\n\"What are they looking at?\" McGill asked. \"No one can possibly know\nwe're here.\"\n\nI started to lean out of the window, twisting up my head to see what it\ncould be.\n\n\"Don't do that, Alec! They'll see you!\" McGill warned, and I pulled my\nhead in.\n\n\"Can we get on the roof?\" I asked, but Molly suddenly said, \"Look who's\nhere.\" Three squad cars drove up and several policemen got out.\n\n\"Perhaps we ought to sort of very gently turn the lights off,\" I\nsuggested.\n\nMolly immediately snapped off the shaded bench lamp, which was all\nthat was on in the lab. This left McGill's office light, and I started\ntoward it.\n\n\"Hadn't we better run for it?\" Molly said, but a loud banging on the\nfront door downstairs answered her.\n\n\"I hope that damn lock doesn't give again!\" McGill breathed.\n\n\"They'll break it down!\" Molly gasped.\n\n\"Like hell. It's University property and they can't possibly have\ngotten a search warrant so quickly at this time of night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom outside came a loud voice: \"Alec Graham! Are you in there?\"\n\n\"Don't answer,\" said McGill. \"And keep away from the windows. I guess\nthey saw the light in my office.\" He leaned out. \"What do you want?\" he\nshouted.\n\n\"This is the police. Open up!\"\n\n\"I won't unless you have a warrant!\"\n\nThere was no more shouting. They seemed to be parlaying among\nthemselves, but the crowd had a menacing sound. A brilliant light\nsuddenly hit our windows, illuminating the lab ceiling--a police\nsearchlight. I saw that Molly had disappeared and I assumed she had\ngone into McGill's office.\n\n\"These guys mean business,\" he said, \"but what the hell brought them?\"\n\n\"Something on the roof. That's what they're all looking at, so why\ndon't we go up and see?\"\n\n\"All right, but you'd better stay down here. There's no parapet and\nthey'll see you.\"\n\nHe started for the door and I decided to follow--at least as far as the\ntrapdoor, or whatever gave onto the roof--when Molly came in from the\nhall. She looked scared.\n\n\"My God! I climbed an iron ladder and took a look outside. There's a\nsmall cyclone over us--a ton of torn papers and dust and junk whirling\naround like a waterspout! They'd be able to see it for blocks!\"\n\n\"Oh, great,\" McGill groaned. \"Now it's playing tricks with the wind.\nThat's how they spotted us.\"\n\n\"We've got to get out of here, McGill,\" said Molly.\n\n\"Maybe the best thing would be for me to give myself up to the cops,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"I don't know whether they'd be able to get you through that mob,\"\nMcGill replied. \"Just listen to them. I only wish I could think of some\nway to satisfy the damn crystal or whatever it is. I have the feeling\nit wants something. It can't be merely fooling around for no reason.\nBut there doesn't seem to be any motive beyond the fact that it's\napparently on your side. How did it start? That's what I wish I knew.\"\n\nHe absently turned the bench lamp on again. I shrugged unhappily and\nscratched my cheek. In so doing, I pulled the piece of pink adhesive\ntape loose and it began to bleed again.\n\n\"Cut yourself shaving, darling?\" Molly asked me.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"As a matter of fact, it was a kind of freak accident.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" McGill lifted his head interestedly. \"Anything involving you and\na fluke I want to hear about. Tell Papa.\"\n\nI did and McGill began to get his dedicated look. \"You say this piece\nof glass just blew up? What did it look like? How big was it?\"\n\n\"I only saw it for a second. It was dirty and I'd say about two feet\nacross--more or less round and with flat places all over it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMcGill came toward me in a state of great excitement. \"That piece that\nhit your cheek--did it merely nick you or is it embedded? If it _is_\nembedded....\" He picked up a bottle of alcohol and a piece of cotton\nand took a lens out of a drawer. \"Molly, there's a pair of tweezers in\nmy desk. Will you fetch them?\" He tilted the light up onto my face and\ndabbed the cut with the alcohol.\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\n\"Keep still. It'll sting a little.... Yes, I think I can see it.\" He\ntook the tweezers from Molly, who had returned, and neatly removed\nsomething from the cut. He held it under the light and looked at it\nthrough the lens. Then he rinsed it under the water faucet, dried it on\na piece of filter-paper and looked at it again. \"Well, it looks like\nglass. I don't know. Maybe it's the nucleus of the glass chunk and....\"\nHis voice trailed off and he frowned at nothing in particular, putting\nthe fragment down on the filter-paper.\n\nI picked it up. It seemed like a bit of sand, only brighter.\n\nMcGill's concern over this new object of interest had been so intent\nthat for a few minutes our attention was diverted, but now Molly began\nto pace up and down. There didn't seem to be anything for us to do, and\nunlike most nurses, waiting makes her nervous. She was looking at the\ndisplay of various chemicals and reagents on the shelves.\n\n\"What's that stuff?\" she asked, pointing to a large jar of black powder\nlabeled Deflocculated Graphite. \"I bet those cops have gone for a\nsearch warrant.\"\n\n\"Finely divided carbon,\" McGill said. \"Damn, I wish I could think of\nsomething! A chunk of glass ... blowing up....\"\n\n\"Graphite is carbon?\" Molly said. \"You don't think they'd actually\n_do_ anything to Alec, do you?\"\n\n\"It's another form of carbon. A diamond is still another: the rare\ncrystalline form,\" he said. \"I wouldn't put it past that mob to do\nanything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I remember that in chemistry,\" Molly said. \"But the police\nwouldn't let them, McGill, would they?\"\n\n\"I've got an idea--\" I tried to break in.\n\n\"They might not be able to stop them,\" McGill replied.\n\n\"We've got to get _out_ of here!\" Molly said for the second time.\n\n\"If a diamond--\" I began.\n\n\"With a helicopter, we might,\" McGill said. \"Right now, we're\nsurrounded.\"\n\n\"How about hiding Alec?\" Molly asked. \"You and I could act innocent.\"\n\n\"I don't _want_ to be hidden,\" I objected. \"My idea is--\"\n\n\"Or better yet, we could act guilty. That would appeal to them,\nwouldn't it, McGill?\"\n\n\"They'd tear the place apart if they got in,\" McGill said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took a surreptitious look out of the windows again. It seemed to hit\nme that our being surrounded was an exaggeration; most of the crowd was\ncentered about the police car directly in front of the main door. They\nhad an ugly look, and while I didn't like the idea of being alone,\nneither did I relish the thought of my presence possibly causing my\nwife and my best friend to be the victims of mob violence, for although\nthe police might, in the absence of a warrant, refrain from breaking\nin, the mob might not. So I decided to leave, confident that some\nbizarre manifestation would lead them away from the lab, and that no\nmatter where I went, I could hardly be worse off. To keep moving was my\nbest bet.\n\nMolly and McGill were still discussing the situation as I tip-toed\ninto the hall. There surely would be a back door--probably in the\nbasement--and I went down three flights to a cement-floored corridor.\nThen, with lighted matches, I found my way to a door at the back of the\nbuilding, at the end. I opened it and peered out, to see a retaining\nwall and stone steps leading up to ground level. I eased out into the\nareaway and pulled the door shut, noticing that I still held the folded\nfilter-paper with the fragment in it. The lock clicked and I realized\nthat my bridge was, as they say, burned behind me.\n\nTwo cops were talking together a little way to my right, but their\nbacks were turned and they were looking up. I, too, looked and saw\nthe whirlpool of debris, which was exactly as Molly had described and\nquite as attention-calling. Clutching the filter-paper like a talisman,\nI climbed the steps and gumshoed away to the left, but as I got to the\ncorner, I met a group of young men, also looking up.\n\nOne of these was saying, \"That's a lynch mob, if ever I saw one! I\ndon't get it.\"\n\n\"Mob psychology, that's the answer,\" explained another.\n\nMy heart congealed, but they walked right by me. It suddenly occurred\nto me that any newspapers that had carried the story would scarcely\nhave been able to dig up a photograph of me yet. All I had to do was to\nwalk out of the campus, for who would recognize me? Where I would go\nthen was something I could decide later.\n\nSo I started out with more assurance, but I took the precaution to act\nlike an onlooker by glancing up over my shoulder now and then at the\nairborne maelstrom.\n\nAs I got to the other side of the open space, I had another shock. A\nfew yards ahead was another group of policemen, one of whom, I saw with\ndismay, was the lieutenant from Charles Street, and he was beginning to\nturn around. I barely had time to duck into a doorway to avoid being\nseen. I had the feeling of a member of the I.R.A. in Dublin during the\nTroubles, and I crouched against the door.\n\nI could now hear the lieutenant's voice: \"Of course he's up there!\nMaddigan'll be here with a warrant any minute now and we'll ....\" His\nvoice faded away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind me, the door suddenly opened and I almost fell. A young student\nholding some notebooks emerged.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said, and walked toward the crowd.\n\nThe door had not yet closed and I slipped in, with my heart\nirretrievably contracted to the size of a buckshot. I could just make\nout in the dim light that I was at the bottom of the fire stairs, so I\nclimbed to the third floor and went into a classroom, then on into an\noffice somewhat like McGill's, that faced toward the lab building.\n\nFrom here, I had a perfect view of the crowd, the police, the upper\nfacade of the labs, brightly lit by the searchlight and, over all, the\nspinning papers and dust, which even as I looked began to die down. I\nwas unable to see Molly or McGill and wondered whether they had noticed\nmy absence and were worrying.\n\nI saw a phone on the desk at my side and considered calling up McGill's\noffice, but first I wanted to think over my new idea. I pulled down\nthe shades and turned on the reading lamp, by the light of which\nI re-examined the fragment I had been carrying around all day. It\nsparkled brilliantly. On the desk, beside an onyx pen-set, a golf\ntrophy and a signed golf ball, was a leather-framed photograph of a\nblank-faced young woman holding a pudgy little boy. I picked it up and\nrubbed the glass with the tiny fragment. It left a faint but undeniable\nscratch. So I was right about one thing.\n\nThen I called McGill's office. In a few moments, I heard the receiver\nlifted, but no voice. \"This is the nucleus,\" I said, and I heard of\nsigh of relief from McGill.\n\n\"Where in hell are you?\"\n\n\"Across the way. Look, out of your window and I'll turn my light off\nand on again.\" I did so.\n\n\"You're in Professor Crandal's office. Why did you leave?\"\n\n\"We'll go into that later. McGill, that fragment is a diamond.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"At any rate, it scratches glass.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me that before? And where is it? I couldn't find\nit anywhere.\"\n\n\"I was sidetracked. I've got it here. Now my idea--\"\n\n\"A diamond! I begin to see light. Give with the idea, Alec.\"\n\n\"Well, there was all this talk of crystals and then you were telling\nMolly about carbon and diamonds, and it occurred to me that what we\nhave is something trying to crystallize--something that once _was_ a\ncrystal, and got broken up and wants to re-form. It keeps trying with\nplaying cards and pigeons and automobiles, but it's no go. Why don't we\ngive it some carbon to play with, McGill?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a short silence. I looked across at the office, but I\ncouldn't see him. I noticed a piece of dirty newspaper that had fallen\nout of the maelstrom and had caught on a thick wire that stretched from\none of the lab windows to immediately below mine--some kind of aerial,\nI imagined. Then I saw that the maelstrom, rather than breaking up, as\nI had thought, was moving over in my direction. I would be pointed out\nagain.\n\n\"You mean the graphite, I suppose,\" McGill said. \"Why in hell did you\nleave and take the fragment with you?\"\n\n\"I forgot it was in my hand,\" I said, dodging the first part of the\nquestion. \"Nobody on the campus recognized me, so I guess I can walk\nback.\" Then I remembered the locked basement door and the fact that\nI could scarcely be let in by McGill, with the cops standing around,\nbut I was feeling light-headed and damage-proof. It was protecting\nits nucleus, which, even if I wasn't any more, I had in my hand. My\ncrystalline rabbit's foot.\n\n\"Hold on a second,\" I said. \"I've got another idea.\"\n\nI put down the receiver, and picked up the golf ball from the desk,\nand put it on the floor. I stood up and put my right foot on it and,\nholding my breath, I raised my other foot. In any event, I would not\nhave far to fall--but I did not fall. I remained upright, holding\nthe filter-paper and wobbling a little. Then I relaxed and closed my\neyes--still I did not fall. The rabbit's foot was working, just as\nMcGill said. I stepped down two inches and picked up the phone.\n\n\"I'm coming across,\" I said. \"That is, if the wire that runs over here\nfrom the lab is strong enough to hold me.\"\n\n\"Alec! You're nuts!\" McGill said, and I hung up. (Diamonds of the\nworld, unite! You have nothing to lose but your nucleus.)\n\nI took a look over the sill at the wire. It was held by a powerful\nsteel eye-bolt, securely attached to the brickwork. Clutching the\ndiamond fragment in its paper, I climbed over the sill and put a foot\non the wire and felt immediately seasick. The wire vibrated like a\nharp-string, but did not give noticeably, and I put my other foot on\nit. Then I almost blacked out and closed my eyes.\n\nWhen I opened them again, I found I had progressed some distance into\nthe void. Nothing was holding me from over-balancing, but my body\nseemed to right itself automatically, as if I were a veteran tightrope\nwalker.\n\nIn a frozen daze, I edged along, keeping my eyes fixed on the distant\nwindow in which I could see McGill and Molly watching me with white\nfaces.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was about half way, the crowd caught sight of me and yelled. A\nman with a broad-brimmed hat ran out from the others and, to my horror,\npulled out a gun. Another man picked up a stone, wound himself up like\na sand-lot pitcher, and hurled it just before the other pulled his\ntrigger. They were excellent shots: the stone was hit by the bullet and\nboth disintegrated. The man's gun jammed at his second try and the two\nheroes were grabbed by the police.\n\nWith my heart pounding, I kept going, until, about four yards from\nsafety, my foot caught, and I looked down again. There was a splice\nin the wire, sticking up from which was a sharp end. I staggered and\nrighted myself ... and let go of the filter-paper.\n\nBy now, the maelstrom was directly over me and my talisman was caught\nin the up-draught. It did not fall, but I did. After a sickening\ninstant, I was brought up with a jerk that nearly strangled me. The\nback of my coat had caught on the projecting wire and I swung there\nlike an unused marionette.\n\nThe crowd shouted and milled around, and the cops called out directions\nto each other. One order was to send for the Fire Department. I found I\ncould breathe, but I could not look down.\n\nThe all-important paper was fluttering around near the lab window\nand McGill was making grabs at it. Then it suddenly blew right in by\nhim. His head reappeared and he shook his clasped hands at me. Molly\nremained at the window, her eyes round, the fingers of each hand\ncrossed. I essayed a debonair smile, which she tried to answer. In the\ndistance, I heard the owl-sound of approaching fire engines.\n\nFrom behind Molly there suddenly came an intense blue light, which\nrapidly increased until she became a dark silhouette, and I could just\nmake out McGill looking at the glare, his eyes shielded by what I took\nto be a deep-blue bottle. His stance suggested elation. There appeared\nto be a terrific in-draught--all the window shades were blowing\nstraight into the lab and Molly's red hair streamed behind her.\n\nIn what was actually almost no time, I heard the Fire Department turn\ninto the campus, and one piece of equipment skidded to a stop directly\nunder me. There was the sound of a winch and then I felt something\ntouch my foot. At that moment, my jacket gave way with a tearing sound,\nMolly closed her eyes, and I landed like an oversize tarantula on top\nof the fireman's ladder.\n\nFiremen and cops were climbing toward me, alternated like meat and\ntomatoes on a shish-kebab. First to reach me was my friend the\nlieutenant. He re-arrested me and pulled. I shook my head to his\nearnest entreaties and hung on with the tenacity of the unbrave. It\nseems to be impossible to detach a determined man from a ladder when\nyou are also on it.\n\nHe and his friends gave up finally and ordered the ladder lowered, but\none last fluke intervened--if it was a fluke. The machinery refused to\nwork and we drove away, with me swaying grandly on my perch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lieutenant had the hook-and-ladder driven to a distant police\nstation, where in due course Vinelli, the lawyer, arrived with his\nfoot in a cast, and I was bailed out. The cops showed me surprising\nconsideration; it turned out they were furious at the irresponsible\nriding they had been getting from Bill Bart. A scientific big-shot\nthat McGill knew, named Joe Stein, convinced them I was in no way to\nblame, and the case was dropped. Professor Stein gave a wonderfully\nincomprehensible but tranquilizing statement to the press, and Molly\nand I went to Oyster Bay.\n\n\"In two weeks, everybody'll have forgotten all about it,\" the\nlieutenant told us. \"You may even be a hero. I don't know.\"\n\nBefore we left, we went with McGill to the lab and saw the diamond. It\nsat on a bench, gleaming brilliant, smooth-faceted and without a flaw.\nIt was at least two feet across, about the same as the chunk of \"glass\"\non Fifty-first Street.\n\n\"The cops never recognized what it was,\" McGill said, \"it being so big.\"\n\n\"Who would?\" Molly asked. \"McGill, I've got an idea--\"\n\n\"All I had to do,\" McGill said, ignoring her, \"was to put the graphite\non some cinder blocks and the fragment on the graphite. Then I turned\na bunsen flame on it and it caught fire with a terrifically bright\nflame--very small--I guess you saw it.\" I nodded. \"It didn't give off\nany heat,\" he went on. \"Adiabatic process. And it got its necessary\npressure from the random motions together of the graphite particles.\nSome random motions! When that was used up, it started on the cinder\nblocks and then the CO_{2} in the air. That's what caused the suction:\nthe blinds were blown straight in. You probably missed that.\" I shook\nmy head. \"Anyway, this thing--\"\n\n\"McGill,\" Molly interrupted, \"I've got an _idea_!\"\n\n\"--this thing has got to be dumped out at sea.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Molly said, looking crest-fallen. \"I was just going to say why\ndon't we break a piece off and sell it in Amsterdam?\"\n\n\"Good God, no! That would only start it up all over again!\"\n\n\"Just a _little_ piece, McGill?\"\n\n\"NO!\"\n\nWith Stein's help, McGill convinced the police that the thing had to\nbe dumped, and we dropped it off a police launch beyond Sandy Hook, to\ntheir bored perplexity. They would have been still more puzzled if\nthey had known what it was.\n\nMcGill came down to Oyster Bay for the weekend and we played a game of\ngin rummy--a truly memorable game, because the cards behaved and I even\nlost a little.\n\nHe congratulated me in a pre-occupied way, which annoyed me. \"I should\nthink you'd be gladder than that,\" I told him.\n\n\"I am,\" he said. \"But there's something else--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Molly, worried.\n\n\"The schools of fish are traveling head to tail. I'm wondering if\nthat's just the beginning of another mess.\"\n\nWe went back to playing gin rummy, but our minds weren't on what we\nwere doing. They haven't been since. Just yesterday, an ocean liner\nchased its berthing tugboats away and went sightseeing up the Hudson\nRiver.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of I Am A Nucleus, by Stephen Barr\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK I AM A NUCLEUS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51330-8.txt or 51330-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/3/3/51330/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
