THIEME\n\nIllustrated by George Schelling\n\n\n\"What do you call it?\" the buyer asked Jenkins.\n\n\"I named it 'Journey Home' but you can think up a better name for it if\nyou want. I'll guarantee that it sells, though. There's nothing like it\non any midway.\"\n\n\"I'd like to try it out first, of course,\" Allenby said. \"Star-Time uses\nonly the very best, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Jenkins said. He had heard the line before, from almost\nevery carnival buyer to whom he had sold. He did not do much business\nwith the carnivals; there weren't enough to keep him busy with large or\nworthwhile rides and features. The amusement parks of the big cities\nwere usually the best markets.\n\nAllenby warily eyed the entrance, a room fashioned from a side-show\nbooth. A rough red curtain concealed the inside. Over the doorway, in\ncrude dark blue paint, was lettered, \"Journey Home.\" Behind the doorway\nwas a large barnlike structure, newly painted white, where Jenkins did\nhis planning, his building, and his finishing. When he sold a new ride\nit was either transported from inside the building through the large,\npull-away doors in back or taken apart piece by piece and shipped to the\npark or carny that bought it.\n\n\"Six thousand's a lot of money,\" the buyer said.\n\n\"Just try it,\" Jenkins told him.\n\nThe buyer shrugged. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Let's go in.\" They walked through\nthe red curtain. Inside the booth-entrance was a soft-cushioned\neasy-chair, also red, secured firmly in place. It was a piece of salvage\nfrom a two-engine commercial airplane. A helmet looking like a Flash\nGordon accessory-hair drier combination was set over it. Jenkins flipped\na switch and the room became bright with light. \"I thought you said this\nwasn't a thrill ride,\" Allenby said, looking at the helmetlike structure\nominously hanging over the chair.\n\n\"It isn't,\" Jenkins said, smiling. \"Sit down.\" He strapped the buyer\ninto place in the chair.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute,\" Allenby protested. \"Why the straps?\"\n\n\"Leave everything to me and don't worry,\" Jenkins said, fitting the\nheadgear into place over the buyer's head. The back of it fitted easily\nover the entire rear of the skull, down to his neck. The front came just\nbelow the eyes. After turning the light off, Jenkins pulled the curtain\nclosed. It was completely black inside.\n\n\"Have a nice trip,\" Jenkins said, pulling a switch on the wall and\npushing a button on the back of the chair at the same time.\n\nCurrents shifted and repatterned themselves inside the helmet and were\nfed into Allenby at the base of his skull, at the medulla. The currents\nof alternating ions mixed with the currents of his varied and random\nbrain waves, and the impulses of one became the impulses of the other.\nAllenby jerked once with the initial shock and was then still, his mind\nand body fused with the pulsating currents of the chair.\n\nSuddenly, Roger Allenby was almost blinded by bright, naked light.\nAllenby's first impression was one of disappointment at the failure of\nthe device. Jenkins was reliable, usually, and hadn't come up with a\nfluke yet.\n\nAllenby got out of the chair and called for Jenkins, holding on to the\narm of the chair to keep his bearings. \"Hey! Where are you? Jenkins!\" He\ntried to look around him but the bright, intense light revealed nothing.\nHe swore to himself, extending his arms in front of him for something to\ngrasp. As he groped for a solid, the light became more subdued and\nshifted from white into a light, pleasant blue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShapes and forms rearranged themselves in front of him and gradually\nbecame distinguishable. He was in a city, or on top of a city. A\npanoramic view was before him and he saw the creations of human beings,\nobviously, but a culture far removed from his. A slight path of white\nbegan at his feet and expanded as it fell slightly, ramplike, over and\ninto the city. The buildings were whiter than the gate of false dreams\nthat Penelope sung of and the streets and avenues were blue, not gray.\nThe people wore white and milled about in the streets below him. They\nshouted as one; their voices were not cries but songs and they sang his\nname.\n\nHe started walking on the white strip. It was flexible and supported his\nweight easily. Then he was running, finding his breath coming in sharp\ngasps and he was among the crowds. They smiled at him as he passed by\nand held out their hands to him. Their faces shone with a brilliance of\nawareness and he knew that they loved him. Troubled, frightened, he kept\nrunning, blindly, and, abruptly, there were no people, no buildings.\n\nHe was walking now, at the left side of a modern super-highway, against\nthe traffic. Autos sped by him, too quickly for him to determine the\nyear of model. Across the divider the traffic was heavier, autos\nspeeding crazily ahead in the direction he was walking; none stopped. He\nhalted for a moment and looked around him. There was nothing on the\nsides of the road: no people, no fields, no farms, no cities, no\nblackness. There was nothing. But far ahead there was green etched\naround the horizon as the road dipped and the cars sped over it. He\nwalked more quickly, catching his breath, and came closer and closer to\nthe green.\n\nAllenby stopped momentarily and turned around, looking at the highway\nthat was behind him. It was gone. Only bleak, black and gray hills of\nrock and rubble were there, no cars, no life. He shuddered and continued\non toward the end of the highway. The green blended in with the blue of\nthe sky now. Closer he came, until just over the next rise in the road\nthe green was bright. Not knowing or caring why, he was filled with\nexpectation and he ran again and was in the meadow.\n\nAll around him were the greens of the grasses and leaves and the yellows\nand blues of the field flowers. It was warm, a spring day, with none of\nthe discomfort of summer heat. Jubilant, Roger spun around in circles,\ninhaling the fragrance of the field, listening to the hum of insect life\nstirring back to awareness after a season of inactivity. Then he was\nrunning and tumbling, barefoot, his shirt open, feeling the soft grass\ngive way underfoot and the soil was good and rich beneath him.\n\nHe saw a stream ahead, with clear water melodiously flowing by him. He\nwent to it and drank, the cold, good water quenching all his thirst,\nclearing all the stickiness of his throat and mind. He dashed the water\non his face and was happy and felt the coolness of it as the breeze\npicked up and swept his hair over his forehead. With a shake of his head\nhe tossed it back in place and ran again, feeling the air rush into his\nlungs with coolness and vibrance unknown since adolescence. No nicotine\nspasms choked him and the air was refreshing.\n\nThen up the hill he sped, pushing hard, as the marigolds and dandelions\nparted before him. At the top he stopped and looked and smiled\necstatically as he saw the green rolling land and the stream, curving\naround from behind the house, his house, the oaks forming a secret lair\nbehind it, and he felt the youth of the world in his lungs and under his\nfeet. He heard the voice calling from that house, his house, calling him\nto Saturday lunch.\n\n\"I'm coming!\" he cried happily and was tumbling down the hill, rolling\nover and over, the hill and ground and sky blending blues and greens and\nnothing had perspective. The world was spinning and everything was black\nagain. He shook his head to clear the dizziness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well?\" Jenkins said. \"How was it?\"\n\nAllenby looked up at him as Jenkins swung the helmet back and unhooked\nthe seatbelt. He squinted as Jenkins flipped the light switch and the\nbrightness hit him.\n\nHis surroundings became distinguishable again very slowly and he knew he\nwas back in the room. \"Where was I?\" he asked.\n\nJenkins shrugged. \"I don't know. It was all yours. You went wherever you\nwanted to go, wherever home is.\" Jenkins smiled down at him. \"Did you\nvisit more than one place?\" he asked. The buyer nodded. \"I thought so.\nIt seems that a person tries a few before finally deciding where to go.\"\n\nThe buyer stood up and stretched. \"Could I please see the barn?\" he\nasked, meaning the huge workshop where Jenkins did the construction\nwork.\n\n\"Sure,\" Jenkins said and opened the door opposite the red curtain into\nthe workshop. It was empty.\n\n\"You mean it was all up here? I didn't move at all?\" He tapped his\ncranium with his index finger.\n\n\"That's right,\" Jenkins said anxiously. \"Do you want it or not?\"\n\nAllenby stood looking into the empty room. \"Yes ... yes, of course,\" he\nsaid. \"How long did the whole thing last?\"\n\n\"About ten seconds,\" Jenkins said, looking at his watch. \"It seems much\nlonger to the traveler. I'm not sure, but I think the imagined time\nvaries with each person. It's always around ten seconds of actual time,\nthough, so you can make a lot of money on it, even if you only have one\nmachine.\"\n\n\"Money?\" Allenby said. \"Money, yes, of course.\" He took a checkbook from\nhis inside pocket and hurriedly wrote a check for six thousand dollars.\n\"When can we have it delivered?\" he asked.\n\n\"You want it shipped the usual way?\"\n\n\"No,\" Allenby said, staring at the red-cushioned chair. \"Send it air\nfreight. Then bill us for the expense.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say,\" Jenkins said, smiling, taking the check. \"You'll\nhave it by the first of the week, probably. I'll put a complete parts\nand assembly manual inside the crate.\"\n\n\"Good, good. But maybe I should test it again, you know. Star-Time can't\nreally afford to make a mistake as expensive as this.\"\n\n\"No,\" Jenkins said quickly. Then, \"I'll guarantee it, of course. If it\ndoesn't work out, I'll give you a full refund. But don't try it again,\ntoday. Don't let anyone have it more than once in one day. Stamp them on\nthe hand or something when they take the trip.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nJenkins looked troubled. \"I'm not sure, but people might not want to\ncome back. Too many times in a row and they might be able to stay\nthere ... in their minds of course.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with\nyou, Mr. Jenkins. I hope to see you again soon.\" They walked back to\nAllenby's not-very-late model car and shook hands. Allenby drove away.\n\nOn the way back to the hotel, and as he lay for a long time in the\nbathtub, letting the warmness drift away from the water, the thought ran\nover and over in his mind. They might be able to stay there, Allenby\nsaid to himself. They might be able to stay there. He smiled warmly at a\ncrack in the plaster as he thought of the first of the week and the\nfragrant meadow.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact & Fiction_\n    November 1963.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
