SMITH\n\n _You can keep a good man down, if\n you've got enough headstart, are alert\n and persistent ... so long as he limits\n himself to acting like a good man...._\n\nIllustrated by Martinez\n\n\nIt was 047-63-10 when he opened the door. Before his superior could chew\nhim for prepunctuality, Huvane said as the chief looked up and opened\nhis mouth to start:\n\n\"Sorry, but you should know. Terra is at it again.\"\n\nChelan's jaw snapped shut. He passed a hand over his face and asked in a\ntone of pure exasperation. \"The same?\" and as Huvane nodded, Chelan went\non, \"Why can't they make a mistake and blow themselves out of our hair?\nHow far did they get this time?\"\n\n\"All the way.\"\n\n\"And out?\"\n\nHuvane sat down shaking his head slowly. \"Not yet, but they're over the\nhump, you know.\" Huvane's face brightened ever so slightly. \"I can't be\ncriticized for not counting them, chief. But I'll estimate that there\nmust be at least a couple of hundred atoms of 109 already. And you know\nthat nobody could _make_ 109 if they hadn't already evolved methods of\nmeasuring the properties of individual atoms. So as soon as they find\nthat their boom-sample doesn't behave like the standard mess out of a\nbombardment chamber, they won't rest until they find out why. They'll\nfind out. Then it'll be 109, 109, 109 until we're forced to clobber them\nagain.\"\n\nBitterly Chelan looked up. \"I don't think I need the lecture. I admire\ntheir tenacity. I admire their ambition. I admire their blasphemous,\nconsignatory, obscenity attitude of acting as if the Great Creator had\nconcocted the whole glorious Universe for their own playground. Yes,\"\nsaid the chief wearily, \"singly they aren't bad traits. Boiled down into\nthe self-esteem of a single race, I don't admire them any more. I'm\nsimply scared.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well, we've got time.\"\n\n\"Not much. What's their space potential this time?\"\n\n\"Still scragged on the mass-inertia-relativity barrier. Tailburners ...\ner, chemical reaction engines. Manned and unmanned orbital flights. Half\na dozen landings on their sister planet. No,\" said Huvane as he saw the\nchief's puzzlement, \"I don't mean Number Two ... the one they call Venus\nthis time. I mean their co-orbital companion. _The_ Moon. They still\ncall it that.\"\n\nThe chief looked up wonderingly. \"Do you suppose,\" he asked solemnly,\n\"that there is really something called a 'racial memory'?\"\n\n\"It's against all the theory,\" objected Huvane. \"But there seems to\nbe--\" his voice trailed off absently. It returned after some thought:\n\"I've tried to sort it out, just as if I were one of them. The\nrecurrence of their ... er ... 'names of antiquity' as they call them,\nseem to recur and recur. Their Planet Two, now called Venus, was called\nAstarte last time, and before that it was Ishtar.\"\n\n\"Other way around.\"\n\n\"No matter. The names are still being used and, according to their\nbelief, merely parallel names culled out of local pagan religious\nbeliefs.\"\n\nThe chief nodded. \"That's only part of the parallelism. The big thing is\nthe way they follow the same pattern. Savage, agrarian, urban, right on\nup the ladder according to the rules of civic science but squabbling and\nbattling all the way right on up and out into space. Hell, Huvane,\nwarfare and conflict I can both understand and cope with, but not the\nTerran flavor. They don't come out bent on conquest or stellar\ncolonialism. They come out with their little private fight still going\non and each side lines up its volume of influence and pits one against\nthe other until the whole section of that spiral arm is glittering like\na sputtering spark along a train of black powder. I wish,\" he said\nsavagely, \"that we could cut off that arm and fling it deep into\nextragalactic space.\"\n\nHuvane shook his head. \"And leave the problem for our children to\nsolve?\"\n\n\"They'll have one to solve, I think,\" said Chelan. \"In another twenty\nthousand years the Terrans will be right back doing business at the same\nold stand. Unless we can solve it for once and for all right now.\"\n\nHuvane looked around as if he were seeking another door to the chief's\noffice. \"How?\" he asked sarcastically. \"The first time we greeted them\nand they took both our welcome and us for everything they could before\nwe pulled the rug out from under them. The second time we boxed them off\nand they broke out after converting the isolation screen into an\noffensive weapon. The third time we tried to avoid them and they ran\nwild exploiting less ambitious races. The fourth time we missed the boat\nand they were chewing at our back door before we knew about them;\ncontaining them was almost a nova job. The fifth time we went in and\ntried to understand them, they traded us two for one. Two things they\ndidn't want for one they did,\" Huvane's lips curled, \"and I'm not sure\nthat they didn't trade us the other way around; two they needed for one\nthey declared useless. Sixth? that was the last time and they just came\nout shooting as if the whole galaxy automatically objected. This time?\nWho knows?\" Huvane sat down again and put his hands between his knees.\n\n\"They don't operate like _people_. Sensible folk settle their own\nproblems, then look for more. Terra? One half of the globe is against\nthe other half of the globe. Fighting one another tooth and nail, they\nstill find time to invent and cross space to other planets and continue\ntheir fight on unknown territory.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'd better just admit that we don't know the solution. Then we\ncan clobber Terra back to the swamp, juggle the place into another ice\nage, put the details down in History, and hope that our remote progeny\nwill be smarter than we.\"\n\n\"Like maybe we're smarter than our remote ancestors?\" jeered Huvane.\n\n\"Got a better idea?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Has anybody really taken a couple of them and _analyzed_ them?\"\n\n\"It's inhumane.\"\n\n\"I agree, but--?\"\n\n\"Get me a healthy, well-balanced specimen of somewhat\nbetter-than-average education and training. Can do?\"\n\n\"Can do. But how are you going to keep him?\"\n\n\"I don't intend to study him like I'd study a bug under a microscope.\nThis one won't get away. Make it in fourteen versaids, Huvane.\"\n\n\"Make it in ten plus or minus a radite or two. So long!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe beast at Cape Canaveral stood three hundred and fifteen feet tall\ndwarfing her creators into microscopic proportions. Swarming up and down\nthe gantry, bug-sized humans crawled in and out of check ports with\ninstrument checks, hauling hoses, cables, lines. Some thousand feet\naway, a puff-bomb of red smoke billowed out and a habit-flattened voice\nannounced: \"At the mark, X Minus Fifteen Minutes ... ... ... Mark! X\nMinus Fifteen Minutes!\"\n\nJerry Markham said, \"That's me!\" He looked up at the lofty porthole and\nalmost lost his balance over backwards sighting it. He was a healthy\nspecimen, about twenty-four and full of life. He had spent the day going\nthrough two routines that were sometimes simultaneous and at other times\nserially; one re-stating his instructions letter by letter including the\nvarious alternatives and contingencies that involved his making\ndecisions if the conditions on Venus were according to this theory or\nthat. The other was a rigorous medical checkup. Neither of them showed\nthat Jerry Markham had spent the previous night in activities not\nrecommended by his superiors but nothing that would bounce him if they\nknew. He could hardly be broken for living it up at a party.\n\nHe shook hands with the boss and stepped into the elevator. It was not\nhis idea of a proper send-off. There should be bands playing and girls\nthrowing paper tape, flowers and a few drinks. Sally should send him off\nwith a proud smooch of lipstick and a tearful promise to wait. Instead\nit was all very military and strict and serious--which is why he'd\nwhooped it up the night before. He'd had his good night and good by with\nSally Forman, but now eighteen hours later he was fit and raring for a\nreturn match.\n\nJerry's mind was by no means concerned with this next half hour, which\nwould be the most perilous part of his flight. Tomorrow would take care\nof itself. The possibility that thirty minutes from now he might be dead\nin a flaming pyre did not cross his mind, the chance that an hour from\nnow he could be told that his bird was off-course and his fate\nstarvation if it obtained an untrue orbit or abrupt destruction if it\ndidn't orbit at all--nothing bothered him.\n\nHe sat there chanting the count down with the official timer and braced\nhimself when the call came:\n\n\"Zero! Fire!\"\n\nInwardly, Jerry Markham's mind said, \"We're off!\" and he began to look\nforward to his landing on Venus. Not the problems of landing, but what\nhe would find there when he soared down through the clouds.\n\nDetermined to hold up through the high-G even though nobody watched, he\nwent on and on and up and up, his radio voiced the progress tinnily.\nShock followed roaring pressure, release followed shock. Orientation was\nlost; only logic and intellect told him where he was and which way he\nwas going.\n\nThen he was free. Free to eat and drink and read and smoke one cigarette\nevery three hours and, in essence, behave in about the same way as a\nprisoner confined in solitary. The similarity did not bother Jerry\nMarkham, for this was honor, not punishment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuvane collected him with the ease of a fisherman landing a netted crab.\nEasily, painlessly. Shockingly, for the crab doesn't exactly take to the\nnet with docility.\n\nHuvane collected the whole shebang, man and machinery; then opened the\nspacecraft with the same attitude as a man peeling the lid from a can of\nsardines. He could have breached the air lock, but he wanted the Terran\nto understand the power behind the act.\n\nJerry Markham came out blinking; very mildly wondering about the air. It\nwas good. Without considering the rather high probability that nobody\nspoke the language, he blurted:\n\n\"What gives?\"\n\nHe was not very much surprised when one of them in uniform said curtly,\n\"This way and make it snappy, Terran!\"\n\nNo, he was not surprised. He was too stunned to permit anything as\nsimple as surprise. And through the shock and the stun, his months of\ntraining came through. Jerry Markham worried his first worry: _How was\nhe going to get the word back home?_\n\nConfinement in the metal cell of his top-stage hadn't bothered him. The\nconcept of landing on a planet that couldn't come closer to home than\nsome twenty-seven million miles was mere peanuts. Isolation for a year\nwas no more than a hiatus, a period of adventure that would be rewarded\nmany-fold. Sally? So she might not wait but there were others; he'd\nenvisioned himself fighting them off with a club after his successful\nreturn. Hell, they'd swarmed him before his take-off, starting with the\nmoment his number had come up as possible candidate.\n\nNo, the meeting with competence in space did not shock him greatly. What\nbothered him was his lack of control over the situation. Had he seen\nthem and passed on about his business, he recounted the incident.\n\nAs it was, his desire to tell somebody about it was cut off. As he sat,\nalone and helpless, it occurred to him that he did not mind so much the\ndying, if that was to be his lot. What mattered was the unmarked grave.\nThe mourning did not move him; the physical concept of \"grave\" and its\nfill of moldering organic substances was nothing. It was mere symbol. So\nlong as people knew how and where, it made little difference to Jerry\nMarkham whether he was planted in a duridium casket guaranteed to\npreserve the dead flesh for a thousand years or whether he went out in a\nbright swift flame that glinted in its tongues of the color-traces of\nincandescent elements of human organic chemistry.\n\nSo long as people knew. Where and how. Vague, vague, mass-volumized\nconcept. Granite tomb was one idea, here was a _place_. Point a\nspread-fingered hand in a waving sweep across the sky that encompasses\nthe Plane of The Ecliptic and say, \"It is there,\" and another _place_ is\nidentified. Lost on Venus is no more than a phrase; from Terra Haute or\nTimes Square, Venus is a tiny point in the sky smaller to the vision\nthan the granite of Grant's Tomb.\n\nImagination breeds irritation. Would they call it pilot error or\nequipment unreliability? Dying he could face. Goofing would be a\ndisgrace that he would have to meet in fact or in symbol. Hardware\ncrackup was a matter of the laws of probability. Not only his duty\ndemanded that he report, his essence cried out for a voice to _let them\nknow_.\n\nAnybody.\n\nJust the chance to tell one other human soul.\n\nChelan asked, \"Who are you? Your name and rank?\"\n\nHe said sullenly, \"Go to hell.\"\n\n\"We have ways and means.\"\n\nHe said, \"Use 'em.\"\n\n\"If we said that we mean no harm; if we asked what we could do to prove\nit, what would be your reply?\"\n\n\"Take me back and let me go.\"\n\n\"Who are you? Will you identify yourself?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Stubborn Terran!\"\n\n\"I know my rights. We are not at war. I'll tell you nothing. Why did you\ncapture me?\"\n\n\"We'll ask the questions, Terran.\"\n\n\"You'll get no answers.\" He sneered at them angrily. \"Torture me--and\nthen wonder whether my screamings tell the truth. Dope me and wonder\nwhether what I truly believe is fact or fantasy.\"\n\n\"Please,\" said Chelan, \"we only want to understand your kind. To know\nwhat makes you tick.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you ask?\"\n\n\"We've tried and we get no answers. Terran, the Universe is a vastness\nbeyond comprehension. Co-operate and give us what we want to know and a\npiece of it is yours.\"\n\n\"Nuts!\"\n\n\"Terran, you have friends.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't?\"\n\n\"Why can't we be your friends?\"\n\nAngrily, resentfully, \"Your way isn't friendly enough to convince me.\"\n\nChelan shook his head. \"Take him away,\" he directed in his own tongue.\n\n\"Where? And how shall we keep him?\"\n\n\"To the place we've prepared. And keep him safe.\"\n\nHuvane asked, \"Safe? Who knows what is safe? One bribed his guards. One\nseduced her guards. One dug his way out scratch by scratch. Disappeared,\ndied, dead, gone, mingled off with the myriad of worlds--did one get\nhome, perhaps, to start their legend of the gods in the sky; the legend\nthat never dies through the rise and fall of culture from savagery to\n... to ... to Element 109?\"\n\nChelan looked at Jerry Markham, the Terran looked back defiantly as if\nhe were guest instead of captive. \"Co-operate,\" breathed Chelan.\n\n\"I'll tell you nothing. Force me. I can't stop that.\"\n\nChelan shook his head sorrowfully. \"Extracting what you know would be\nless than the play of a child,\" he said. \"No, Terran. We can know what\nyou know in the turn of a dial. What we need is that which you do not\nknow. Laugh? Or is that a sneer? No matter. What you know is worthless.\nYour problems and your ambitions, both racial and personal, are minor.\nWe know them already. The pattern is repetitive, only some of the names\nare changed.\n\n\"But why? Ah, that we must know. Why are you what you are? Seven times\nin History Terra has come up from the mud, seven times along the same\nroute. Seven times a history of ten thousand years from savage to\nsavant, from beast to brilliance and always with the same will to\ndo--to do what? To die for what? To fight for what?\"\n\nChelan waved Huvane to take the Terran away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuvane said, \"He's locked in air-tight with guards who can be trusted.\nNow what do we do with him?\"\n\n\"He will co-operate.\"\n\n\"By force?\"\n\n\"No, Huvane. By depriving him of the one thing that Life cannot exist\nwithout.\"\n\n\"Food? Safety?\"\n\nChelan shook his head. \"More primitive than these.\" He lowered his\nvoice. \"He suffers now from being cut off from his kind. Life starts,\ncomplaining about the treatment it receives during the miracle of birth\nand crying for its first breath of air. Life departs gasping for air,\nwith someone listening for the last words, the last message from the\ndying. Communication, Huvane, is the primary drive of all Life, from\nplant to animal to man--and if such exists, superman.\n\n\"Through communication Life goes on. Communication is the prime\nrequisite to procreation. The firefly signals his mate by night, the\nhuman male entices his woman with honeyed words and is not the gift of a\njewel a crystalline, enduring statement of his undying affection?\"\n\nChelan dropped his flowery manner and went on in a more casual vein:\n\"Huvane, boil it down to the least attractive form of simplification, no\nlife stands alone. And no viable life goes on without communication, I\nshall shut off the Terran's communication.\"\n\n\"Then he will go rank staring, raving mad.\"\n\n\"No, for I shall offer him the alternative. Co-operate, or molder in\nutter blankness.\"\n\nHuvane shrugged. \"Seems to me that any Terran locked in a duralim cell\nso far from home the distance means nothing is already cut from\ncommunication.\"\n\n\"Deeper, deeper, Huvane. The brain lies prisoner within a cell of bone.\nIts contact with the Outside world lies along five channels of sensory\ncommunication. Everything that the brain believes about the Universe is\nthe product of sensory information carried inward by sight, touch,\nsound, taste and smell. From five basic bits of information, knowledge\nof the Great Truth is formed through logic and self-argument.\nEverything.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Oh, now stop. I am not expressing my own singular opinion. I believe a\nrather great proportion of the things that I was taught, and I was\ntaught through the self-same five sensory channel.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m.\"\n\n\"Good. Just plain 'Um-m-m.' Now we shall shut off the Terran's channels\nof communication until he consents as an alternative. This, Huvane,\nhasn't been tried before. It may bring us the final important bit of\ninformation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly the lights went out. Jerry Markham was prepared for dark\nisolation, he could do nothing about it so he accepted it by the simple\nprocess of assuring himself that things were going to get worse before\nthey got better.\n\nThe darkness became--absolute. Utter. Complete. Not even the dots and\nwhorls and specks that are technically called \"Visual noise\" occurred. A\nlevel of mental alertness niggled at him; for nearly twenty-four years\nit had been a busy little chunk of his mind. It was that section that\ninspected the data for important program material and decided which was\ntrivial and which was worthy of the Big Boy's attention. Now it was out\nof a job because there wasn't even a faint background count of\nplateau-noise to occupy its attention.\n\nThe silence grew--vast. Brain said that the solid walls were no more\nthan ten feet from him; ears said that he was in the precise middle of\nabsolutely nowhere. Feeling said that the floor was under his feet, ears\nsaid that upward pressure touched his soles. Deeper grew the deadening\nof his ears, and orientation was lost. Feeling remained and he felt his\nheart beating in a hunting rhythm because the sound-feedback through the\near was gone, and the hortator had lost his audible beat.\n\nFeeling died and he knew not whether he stood or sat or floated askew.\nFeeling died and with it went that delicate motor control that directs\nthe position of muscle and limb and enables a man to place his little\nfinger on the tip of his nose with his eyes closed.\n\nAside from the presence of foreign matter, the taste of a clean mouth\nis--tasteless. The term is relative. Jerry Markham learned what real\ntastelessness was. It was flat and blank and--nothingness.\n\nChemists tell us that air is tasteless, colorless, and odorless, but\nwhen sense is gone abruptly one realizes that the air does indeed have\nits aroma.\n\nIn an unemployed body the primitive sensors of the mind had nothing to\ndo, and like a man trained to busy-ness, loafing was their hardest task.\nGone was every sensory stimulus. His heart pumped from habit, not\ncontrolled by the feedback of sound or feeling. He breathed, but he did\nnot hear the inrush of air. Brain told him to be careful of his mouth,\nthe sharp teeth could bite the dead tongue and he could bleed to death\nnever feeling pain nor even the swift flow of salty warmth.\nHabit-trained nerves caused a false tickle in his throat; he never knew\nwhether he coughed or whether he thought that he coughed.\n\nThe sense of time deserted him when the metronome of heartbeat died.\nDetermined Brain compromised by assuming that crude time could be kept\nby the function of hunger, elimination, weariness. Logical Brain pointed\nout that he could starve to death and feel nothing; elimination was a\nsensory thing no more; weariness was of the body that brought no\ninformation anyway--and what, indeed was sleep?\n\nBrain considered this question. Brain said, I am Jerry Markham. But is\nit true that no brain can think of nothing? Is it possible that \"Sleep\"\nis the condition that obtains when the body stops conveying reliable\ninformation to the brain, and then says to Hell with Everything and\ndecides to stop thinking?\n\nThe Brain called Jerry Markham did not stop thinking. It lost its time\nsense, but not completely. A period of time passed, a whirlwind of\nthoughts and dreamlike actions went on, and then calmness came for a\nwhile.\n\nDreams? Now ponder the big question. Does the brain dream the dream as a\nsensory experience--or is a dream no more than a sequence of assorted\nmemories? Would a dying brain expire in pleasure during a pleasant\ndream--or is the enjoyment of a pleasant dream only available to the\nafter-awakened brain?\n\nWhat is Man but his Memories?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn one very odd manner, the brain of Jerry Markham retained its\nintellectual orientation, and realized that its physical orientation was\nuncontrollable and undetectable and therefore of no importance. Like the\nlighthouse keeper who could not sleep when the diaphone did not\nwrneeee-hrnawwww for five seconds of each and every minute, Jerry\nMarkham's brain was filled with a mild concern about the total lack of\nunimportant but habitual data. There was no speckle of light to classify\nand ignore, no susurrus of air molecules raining against the eardrum.\nBlankness replaced the smell and taste and their absence was as\ndisturbing as a pungence or a poison. And, of course, one should feel\nsomething if it is no more than the tonus of muscle against the mobile\nbones.\n\nCommunication is the prime drive of life. Cut off from external\ncommunication entirely, section A, bay 6, tier 9, row 13 hollered\nover to box Q, line 23, aisle F and wanted to know what was going\non. The gang on the upper deck hailed the boiler room, and the\ncrew in the bleacher seats reported that the folks in charge of\nC.I.C.--Communication Information Center--were sitting on their hands\nbecause they didn't have anything to do. One collection of bored brain\ncells stirred. They hadn't been called upon since Jerry Markham sang\n\"_Adeste Fidelis_\" in memorized Latin some fifteen years earlier and so\nthey started the claque. Like an auditorium full of people impatient\nbecause the curtain had not gone up on time, bedlam broke loose.\n\nBedlam is subject to the laws of periodicity, stochastic analysis, and\nwith some rather brilliant manipulation it can be reduced to a Fourier\nSeries. Fourier says that Maxwell is right and goes on to define exactly\nwhen, in a series of combined periodicities of apparently random motion,\nall the little particles will be moving in the same direction.\nStochastic analysis says that if the letter \"U\" follows the letter \"Q\"\nin most cases, words beginning with \"Q\" will have \"U\" for a second\nletter.\n\nJerry Markham began to think. Isolated and alone, prisoner in the cell\nof bone, with absolutely nothing to distract him, the Brain by common\nconsent pounded a gavel, held a conference, appointed a chairman and\nsettled down to do the one job that the Brain was assembled to do. In\nunison, ten to the sixteenth storage cells turned butter side up at the\nsingle wave of a mental flag.\n\nHe thought of his father and his mother; of his Sally. He thought of his\ncommanding officer and of the fellows he liked and disliked. The\nprimitive urge to communicate was upon him, because he must first\nestablish communication before he could rise from the stony mineral\nstage to the exalted level of a vegetable. Bereft of his normal senses,\nundistracted by trivia such as noise and pain and the inestimable\nvastness of information bits that must be considered and evaluated, his\nbrain called upon his memory and provided the background details.\n\nThe measured tread of a company of marching soldiers can wreck a bridge.\n\nThe cadence of ten to the sixteenth brain cells, undivided by the\ndistraction of incoming information, broke down a mental barrier.\n\nAs vividly as the living truth, Jerry Markham envisioned himself\nsauntering down the sidewalk. The breeze was on his face and the\npavement was beneath his feet, the air was laden with its myriad of\nsmells and the flavor of a cigarette was on his tongue. His eyes saw\nSally running toward him, her cry of greeting was a welcome sound and\nthe pressure of her hug was strong and physical as the taste of her\nlips.\n\nReal.\n\nShe hugged his arm and said, \"Your folks are waiting.\"\n\nJerry laughed. \"Let the general wait a bit longer,\" he said. \"I've got a\nlot to tell him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHuvane said, \"Gone!\" and the sound of his voice re-echoed back and forth\nacross the empty cell.\n\n\"Gone,\" repeated Chelan. \"Utterly incomprehensible, but none the less a\nfact. But how--? Isolated, alone, imprisoned--cut off from all\ncommunication. All communication--?\"\n\n\"I'll get another specimen, chief.\"\n\nChelan shook his head. \"Seven times we've slapped them down. Seven times\nwe've watched their rise--and wondered how they did it. Seven times they\nwould have surpassed us if we hadn't blocked them. Let them rise, let\nthem run the Universe. They're determined to do that anyway. And now I\nthink it's time for us to stop annoying our betters. I'd hate to face\nthem if they were angry.\"\n\n\"But chief, he was cut off from all communication--?\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Chelan, \"not!\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ March\n    1959.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
