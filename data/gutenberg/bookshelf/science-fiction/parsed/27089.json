WESTLAKE\n\n\nMister Henderson called me into his office my third day back in\nTangiers. That was a day and a half later than I'd expected. Roving\nclaims investigators for Tangiers Mutual Insurance Corporation don't\nusually get to spend more than thirty-six consecutive hours at home\nbase.\n\nHenderson was jovial but stern. That meant he was happy with the job I'd\njust completed, and that he was pretty sure I'd find some crooked\nshenanigans on this next assignment. That didn't please me. I'm\nbasically a plain-living type, and I hate complications. I almost wished\nfor a second there that I was back on Fire and Theft in Greater New\nYork. But I knew better than that. As a roving claim investigator, I\navoided the more stultifying paper work inherent in this line of work\nand had the additional luxury of an expense account nobody ever\nquestioned.\n\nIt made working for a living almost worthwhile.\n\nWhen I was settled in the chair beside his desk, Henderson said, \"That\nwas good work you did on Luna, Ged. Saved the company a pretty pence.\"\n\nI smiled modestly and said, \"Thank you, sir.\" And reflected to myself\nfor the thousandth time that the company could do worse than split that\nsaving with the guy who'd made it possible. Me, in other words.\n\n\"Got a tricky one this time, Ged,\" said my boss. He had done his\nback-patting, now we got down to business. He peered keenly at me, or at\nleast as keenly as a round-faced tiny-eyed fat man _can_ peer. \"What do\nyou know about the Risk Profession Retirement Plan?\" he asked me.\n\n\"I've heard of it,\" I said truthfully. \"That's about all.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Most of the policies are sold off-planet, of course. It's a\nform of insurance for non-insurables. Spaceship crews, asteroid\nprospectors, people like that.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, unhappily. I knew right away this meant I was going to\nhave to go off-Earth again. I'm a one-gee boy all the way. Gravity\nchanges get me in the solar plexus. I get g-sick at the drop of an\nelevator.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Here's the way it works,\" he went on, either not noticing my sad face\nor choosing to ignore it. \"The client pays a monthly premium. He can be\nas far ahead or as far behind in his payments as he wants--the policy\nhas no lapse clause--just so he's all paid up by the Target Date. The\nTarget Date is a retirement age, forty-five or above, chosen by the\nclient himself. After the Target Date, he stops paying premiums, and we\nbegin to pay him a monthly retirement check, the amount determined by\nthe amount paid into the policy, his age at retiring, and so on. Clear?\"\n\nI nodded, looking for the gimmick that made this a paying proposition\nfor good old Tangiers Mutual.\n\n\"The Double R-P--that's what we call it around the office here--assures\nthe client that he won't be reduced to panhandling in his old age,\nshould his other retirement plans fall through. For Belt prospectors, of\ncourse, this means the big strike, which maybe one in a hundred find.\nFor the man who never does make that big strike, this is something to\nfall back on. He can come home to Earth and retire, with a guaranteed\nincome for the rest of his life.\"\n\nI nodded again, like a good company man.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Henderson, emphasizing this point with an upraised\nchubby finger, \"these men are still uninsurables. This is a retirement\nplan only, not an insurance policy. There is no beneficiary other than\nthe client himself.\"\n\nAnd there was the gimmick. I knew a little something of the actuarial\nstatistics concerning uninsurables, particularly Belt prospectors. Not\nmany of them lived to be forty-five, and the few who would survive the\nBelt and come home to collect the retirement wouldn't last more than a\nyear or two. A man who's spent the last twenty or thirty years on\nlow-gee asteroids just shrivels up after a while when he tries to live\non Earth.\n\nIt needed a company like Tangiers Mutual to dream up a racket like that.\nThe term \"uninsurables\" to most insurance companies means those people\nwhose jobs or habitats make them too likely as prospects for obituaries.\nTo Tangiers Mutual, uninsurables are people who have money the company\ncan't get at.\n\n\"Now,\" said Henderson importantly, \"we come to the problem at hand.\" He\nruffled his up-to-now-neat In basket and finally found the folder he\nwanted. He studied the blank exterior of this folder for a few seconds,\npursing his lips at it, and said, \"One of our clients under the Double\nR-P was a man named Jafe McCann.\"\n\n\"Was?\" I echoed.\n\nHe squinted at me, then nodded at my sharpness. \"That's right, he's\ndead.\" He sighed heavily and tapped the folder with all those pudgy\nfingers. \"Normally,\" he said, \"that would be the end of it. File closed.\nHowever, this time there are complications.\"\n\nNaturally. Otherwise, he wouldn't be telling _me_ about it. But\nHenderson couldn't be rushed, and I knew it. I kept the alert look on my\nface and thought of other things, while waiting for him to get to the\npoint.\n\n\"Two weeks after Jafe McCann's death,\" Henderson said, \"we received a\ncash-return form on his policy.\"\n\n\"A cash-return form?\" I'd never heard of such a thing. It didn't sound\nlike anything Tangiers Mutual would have anything to do with. We _never_\nreturn cash.\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"It's something special in this case,\" he explained. \"You see, this\nisn't an insurance policy, it's a retirement plan, and the client can\nwithdraw from the retirement plan at any time, and have seventy-five per\ncent of his paid-up premiums returned to him. It's, uh, the law in plans\nsuch as this.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. That explained it. A law that had snuck through the World\nFinance Code Commission while the insurance lobby wasn't looking.\n\n\"But you see the point,\" said Henderson. \"This cash-return form arrived\ntwo weeks after the client's death.\"\n\n\"You said there weren't any beneficiaries,\" I pointed out.\n\n\"Of course. But the form was sent in by the man's partner, one Ab\nKarpin. McCann left a hand-written will bequeathing all his possessions\nto Karpin. Since, according to Karpin, this was done before McCann's\ndeath, the premium money cannot be considered part of the policy, but as\npart of McCann's cash-on-hand. And Karpin wants it.\"\n\n\"It can't be that much, can it?\" I asked. I was trying my best to point\nout to him that the company would spend more than it would save if it\nsent me all the way out to the asteroids, a prospect I could feel coming\nand one which I wasn't ready to cry hosannah over.\n\n\"McCann died,\" Henderson said ponderously, \"at the age of fifty-six. He\nhad set his retirement age at sixty. He took out the policy at the age\nof thirty-four, with monthly payments of fifty credits. Figure it out\nfor yourself.\"\n\nI did--in my head--and came up with a figure of thirteen thousand and\ntwo hundred credits. Seventy-five per cent of that would be nine\nthousand and nine hundred credits. Call it ten thousand credits even.\n\nI had to admit it. It was worth the trip.\n\n\"I see,\" I said sadly.\n\n\"Now,\" said Henderson, \"the conditions--the circumstances--of McCann's\ndeath are somewhat suspicious. And so is the cash-return form itself.\"\n\n\"There's a chance it's a forgery?\"\n\n\"One would think so,\" he said. \"But our handwriting experts have worn\nthemselves out with that form, comparing it with every other single\nscrap of McCann's writing they can find. And their conclusion is that\nnot only is it genuinely McCann's handwriting, but it is McCann's\nhandwriting at age fifty-six.\"\n\n\"So McCann must have written it,\" I said. \"Under duress, do you think?\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" said Henderson complacently. \"That's what you're\nsupposed to find out. Oh, there's just one more thing.\"\n\nI did my best to make my ears perk.\n\n\"I told you that McCann's death occurred under somewhat suspicious\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, \"you did.\"\n\n\"McCann and Karpin,\" he said, \"have been partners--unincorporated, of\ncourse--for the last fifteen years. They had found small rare-metal\ndeposits now and again, but they had never found that one big strike all\nthe Belt prospectors waste their lives looking for. Not until the day\nbefore McCann died.\"\n\n\"Ah hah,\" I said. \"_Then_ they found the big strike.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And McCann's death?\"\n\n\"Accidental.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"What proof have we got?\"\n\n\"None. The body is lost in space. And law is few and far between that\nfar out.\"\n\n\"So all we've got is this guy Karpin's word for how McCann died, is that\nit?\"\n\n\"That's all we have. So far.\"\n\n\"Sure. And now you want me to go on out there and find out what's\ncooking, and see if I can maybe save the company ten thousand credits.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Henderson.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe copter took me to the spaceport west of Cairo, and there I boarded\nthe good ship _Demeter_ for Luna City and points Out. I loaded up on\ng-sickness pills and they worked fine. I was sick as a dog.\n\nBy the time we got to Atronics City, my insides had grown resigned to\ntheir fate. As long as I didn't try to eat, my stomach would leave me\nalone.\n\nAtronics City was about as depressing as a Turkish bath with all the\nlights on. It stood on a chunk of rock a couple of miles thick, and it\nlooked like nothing more in this world than a welder's practice range.\n\nFrom the outside, Atronics City is just a derby-shaped dome of\nnickel-iron, black and kind of dirty-looking. I suppose a transparent\ndome would have been more fun, but the builders of the company cities in\nthe asteroids were businessmen, and they weren't concerned with having\nfun. There's nothing to look at outside the dome but chunks of rock and\nthe blackness of space anyway, and you've got all this cheap iron\nfloating around in the vicinity, and all a dome's supposed to do is keep\nthe air in. Besides, though the Belt isn't as crowded as a lot of people\nthink, there _is_ quite a lot of debris rushing here and there, bumping\ninto things, and a transparent dome would just get all scratched up, not\nto mention punctured.\n\nFrom the inside, Atronics City is even jollier. There's the top level,\ndirectly under the dome, which is mainly parking area for scooters and\ntuggers of various kinds, plus the office shacks of the Assayer's\nOffice, the Entry Authority, the Industry Troopers and so on. The next\nthree levels have all been burned into the bowels of the planetoid.\n\nLevel two is the Atronics plant, and a noisy plant it is. Level three is\nthe shopping and entertainment area--grocery stores and clothing stores\nand movie theaters and bars--and level four is housing, two rooms and\nkitchen for the unmarried, four rooms and kitchen plus one room for each\nchild for the married.\n\nAll of these levels have one thing in common. Square corners, painted\nolive drab. The total effect of the place is suffocating. You feel like\nyou're stuck in the middle of a stack of packing crates.\n\nMost of the people living in Atronics City work, of course, for\nInternational Atronics, Incorporated. The rest of them work in the\nservice occupations--running the bars and grocery stores and so on--that\nkeep the company employees alive and relatively happy.\n\nWages come high in the places like Atronics City. Why not, the raw\nmaterials come practically for free. And as for working conditions,\nwell, take a for instance. How do you make a vacuum tube? You fiddle\nwith the innards and surround it all with glass. And how do you get the\nair out? No problem, boy, there wasn't any air in there to begin with.\n\nAt any rate, there I was at Atronics City. That was as far as _Demeter_\nwould take me. Now, while the ship went on to Ludlum City and Chemisant\nCity and the other asteroid business towns, my two suitcases and I\ndribbled down the elevator to my hostelry on level four.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHave you ever taken an elevator ride when the gravity is practically\nnon-existent? Well, don't. You see, the elevator manages to sink faster\nthan you do. It isn't being _lowered_ down to level four, it's being\n_pulled_ down.\n\nWhat this means is that the suitcases have to be lashed down with the\nstraps provided, and you and the operator have to hold on tight to the\nhand-grips placed here and there around the wall. Otherwise, you'd clonk\nyour head on the ceiling.\n\nBut we got to level four at last, and off I went with my suitcases and\nthe operator's directions. The suitcases weighed about half an ounce\neach out here, and I felt as though I weighed the same. Every time I\nraised a foot, I was sure I was about to go sailing into a wall. Local\ncitizens eased by me, their feet occasionally touching the iron pavement\nas they soared along, and I gave them all dirty looks.\n\nLevel four was nothing but walls and windows. The iron floor went among\nthese walls and windows in a straight straight line, bisecting other\n\"streets\" at perfect right angles, and the iron ceiling sixteen feet up\nwas lined with a double row of fluorescent tubes. I was beginning to\nfeel claustrophobic already.\n\nThe Chalmers Hotel--named for an Atronics vice-president--had received\nmy advance registration, which was nice. I was shown to a second-floor\nroom--nothing on level four had more than two stories--and was left to\nunpack my suitcases as best I may.\n\nI had decided to spend a day or two at Atronics City before taking a\nscooter out to Ab Karpin's claim. Atronics City had been Karpin's and\nMcCann's home base. All of McCann's premium payments had been mailed\nfrom here, and the normal mailing address for both of them was GPO\nAtronics City.\n\nI wanted to know as much as possible about Ab Karpin before I went out\nto see him. And Atronics City seemed like the best place to get my\ninformation.\n\nBut not today. Today, my stomach was very unhappy, and my head was on\nsympathy strike. Today, I was going to spend my time exclusively in bed,\ntrying not to float up to the ceiling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Mapping & Registry Office, it seemed to me the next day, was the\nbest place to start. This was where prospectors filed their claims, but\nit was a lot more than that. The waiting room of M&R was the unofficial\nclub of the asteroid prospectors. This is where they met with one\nanother, talked together about the things that prospectors discuss, and\nmade and dissolved their transient partnerships.\n\nIn this way, Karpin and McCann were unusual. They had maintained their\npartnership for fifteen years. That was about sixty times longer than\nmost such arrangements lasted.\n\nSearching the asteroid chunks for rare and valuable metals is basically\npretty lonely work, and it's inevitable that the prospectors will every\nonce in a while get hungry for human company and decide to try a team\noperation. But, at the same time, work like this attracts people who\ndon't get along very well with human company. So the partnerships come\nand go, and the hatreds flare and are forgotten, and the normal\nprospecting team lasts an average of three months.\n\nAt any rate, it was to the Mapping & Registry Office that I went first.\nAnd, since that office was up on the first level, I went by elevator.\n\nRiding _up_ in that elevator was a heck of a lot more fun than riding\ndown. The elevator whipped up like mad, the floor pressed against the\nsoles of my feet, and it felt almost like good old Earth for a second or\ntwo there. But then the elevator stopped, and I held on tight to the\nhand-grips to keep from shooting through the top of the blasted thing.\n\nThe operator--a phlegmatic sort--gave me directions to the M&R, and off\nI went, still trying to figure out how to sail along as gracefully as\nthe locals.\n\nThe Mapping & Registry Office occupied a good-sized shack over near the\ndome wall, next to the entry lock. I pushed open the door and went on\nin.\n\nThe waiting room was cozy and surprisingly large, large enough to\ncomfortably hold the six maroon leather sofas scattered here and there\non the pale green carpet, flanked by bronze ashtray stands. There were\nonly six prospectors here at the moment, chatting together in two groups\nof three, and they all looked alike. Grizzled, ageless, watery-eyed,\ntheir clothing clean but baggy. I passed them and went on to the desk at\nthe far end, behind which sat a young man in official gray, slowly\nturning the crank of a microfilm reader.\n\nHe looked up at my approach. I flashed my company identification and\nasked to speak to the manager. He went away, came back, and ushered me\ninto an office which managed to be Spartan and sumptuous at the same\ntime. The walls had been plastic-painted in textured brown, the iron\nfloor had been lushly carpeted in gray, and the desk had been covered\nwith a simulated wood coating.\n\nThe manager--a man named Teaking--went well with the office. His face\nand hands were spare and lean, but his uniform was immaculate, covered\nwith every curlicue the regulations allowed. He welcomed me politely,\nbut curiously, and I said, \"I wonder if you know a prospector named Ab\nKarpin?\"\n\n\"Karpin? Of course. He and old Jafe McCann--pity about McCann. I hear he\ngot killed.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\"And that's what you're here for, eh?\" He nodded sagely. \"I didn't know\nthe Belt boys could get insurance,\" he said.\n\n\"It isn't exactly that,\" I said. \"This concerns a retirement plan,\nand--well, the details don't matter.\" Which, I hoped, would end his\ncuriosity in that line. \"I was hoping you could give me some background\non Karpin. And on McCann, too, for that matter.\"\n\nHe grinned a bit. \"You saw the men sitting outside?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Then you've seen Karpin and McCann. Exactly the same. It doesn't matter\nif a man's thirty or sixty or what. It doesn't matter what he was like\nbefore he came out here. If he's been here a few years, he looks exactly\nlike the bunch you saw outside there.\"\n\n\"That's appearance,\" I said. \"What I was looking for was personality.\"\n\n\"Same thing,\" he said. \"All of them. Close-mouthed, anti-social,\nfiercely independent, incurably romantic, always convinced that the big\nstrike is just a piece of rock away. McCann, now, he was a bit more\nrealistic than most. He'd be the one I'd expect to take out a retirement\npolicy. A real pence-pincher, that one, though I shouldn't say it as\nhe's dead. But that's the way he was. Brighter than most Belt boys when\nit came to money matters. I've seen him haggle over a new piece of\nequipment for their scooter, or some repair work, or some such thing,\nand he was a wonder to watch.\"\n\n\"And Karpin?\" I asked him.\n\n\"A prospector,\" he said, as though that answered my question. \"Same as\neverybody else. Not as sharp as McCann when it came to money. That's why\nall the money stuff in the partnership was handled by McCann. But Karpin\nwas one of the sharpest boys in the business when it came to mineralogy.\nHe knew rocks you and I never heard of, and most times he knew them by\nsight. Almost all of the Belt boys are college grads--you've got to know\nwhat you're looking for out here and what it looks like when you've\nfound it--but Karpin has practically all of them beat. He's _sharp_.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\n\"Sounds like a good team,\" I said.\n\n\"I guess that's why they stayed together so long,\" he said. \"They\ncomplemented each other.\" He leaned forward, the inevitable prelude to a\nconfidential remark. \"I'll tell you something off the record, Mister,\"\nhe said. \"Those two were smarter than they knew. Their partnership was\nnever legalized, it was never anything more than a piece of paper. And\nthere's a bunch of fellas around here mighty unhappy about that today.\nJafe McCann is the one who handled all the money matters, like I said.\nHe's got IOU's all over town.\"\n\n\"And they can't collect from Karpin?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon. He was sharp and\ncheap, but he was honest. If he'd lived, he would have repaid all his\ndebts, I'm sure of it. And if this strike they made is as good as I\nhear, he would have been able to repay them with no trouble at all.\"\n\nI nodded, somewhat impatiently. I had the feeling by now that I was\ntalking to a man who was one of those who had a Jafe McCann IOU in his\npocket. \"How long has it been since you've seen Karpin?\" I asked him,\nwondering what Karpin's attitude and expression was now that his partner\nwas dead.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, not for a couple of months,\" he said. \"Not since they went\nout together the last time and made that strike.\"\n\n\"Didn't Karpin come in to make his claim?\"\n\n\"Not here. Over to Chemisant City. That was the nearest M&R to the\nstrike.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" That was a pity. I would have liked to have known if there had\nbeen a change of any kind in Karpin since his partner's death. \"I'll\ntell you what the situation is,\" I said, with a false air of\ntruthfulness. \"We have some misgivings about McCann's death. Not\nsuspicions, exactly, just misgivings. The timing is what bothers us.\"\n\n\"You mean, because it happened just after the strike?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" I answered frankly.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I wouldn't get too excited about that, if I were\nyou,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be the first time it's happened. A man makes\nthe big strike after all, and he gets so excited he forgets himself for\na minute and gets careless. And you only have to be careless once out\nhere.\"\n\n\"That may be it,\" I said. I got to my feet, knowing I'd picked up all\nthere was from this man. \"Thanks a lot for your cooperation,\" I said.\n\n\"Any time,\" he said. He stood and shook hands with me.\n\nI went back out through the chatting prospectors and crossed the echoing\ncavern that was level one, aiming to rent myself a scooter.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI don't like rockets. They're noisy as the dickens, they steer hard and\ndrive erratically, and you can never carry what _I_ would consider a\nsafe emergency excess of fuel. Nothing like the big steady-g\ninterplanetary liners. On those I feel almost human.\n\nThe appearance of the scooter I was shown at the rental agency didn't do\nmuch to raise my opinion of this mode of transportation. The thing was a\ngood ten years old, the paint scraped and scratched all over its\negg-shaped, originally green-colored body, and the windshield--a silly\nterm, really, for the front window of a craft that spends most of its\ntime out where there isn't any wind--was scratched and pockmarked to the\npoint of translucency by years of exposure to the asteroidal dust.\n\nThe rental agent was a sharp-nosed thin-faced type who displayed this\nrefugee from a melting vat without a blush, and still didn't blush when\nhe told me the charges. Twenty credits a day, plus fuel.\n\nI paid without a murmur--it was the company's money, not mine--and paid\nan additional ten credits for the rental of a suit to go with it. I\nworked my way awkwardly into the suit, and clambered into the driver's\nseat of the relic. I attached the suit to the ship in all the necessary\nplaces, and the agent closed and spun the door.\n\nMost of the black paint had worn off the handles of the controls, and\ninsulation peeked through rips in the plastic siding here and there. I\nwondered if the thing had any slow leaks and supposed fatalistically\nthat it had. The agent waved at me, stony-faced, the conveyor belt\ntrundled me outside the dome, and I kicked the weary rocket into life.\n\nThe scooter had a tendency to roll to the right. If I hadn't kept\nfighting it back, it would have soon worked up a dandy little spin. I\nwas spending so much time juggling with the controls that I practically\nmissed a couple of my beacon rocks, and that would have been just too\nbad. If I'd gotten off the course I had carefully outlined for myself,\nI'd never have found my bearings again, and I would have just floated\naround amid the scenery until some passerby took pity and towed me back\nhome.\n\nBut I managed to avoid getting lost, which surprised me, and after four\nnerve-wracking hours I finally spotted the yellow-painted X of a\nregistered claim on a half-mile-thick chunk of rock dead ahead. As I got\ncloser, I spied a scooter parked near the X, and beside it an inflated\nportable dome. The scooter was somewhat larger than mine, but no newer\nand probably even less safe. The dome was varicolored, from repeated\npatching.\n\nThis would be the claim, and this is where I would find Karpin, sitting\non his property while waiting for the sale to go through. Prospectors\nlike Karpin are free-lance men, working for no particular company. They\nregister their claims in their own names, and then sell the rights to\nwhichever company shows up first with the most attractive offer. There's\na lot of paperwork to such a sale, and it's all handled by the company.\nWhile waiting, the smart prospector sits on his claim and makes sure\nnobody chips off a part of it for himself, a stunt that still happens\nnow and again. It doesn't take too much concentrated explosive to make\ntwo rocks out of one rock, and a man's claim is only the rock with his X\non it.\n\nI set the scooter down next to the other one, and flicked the toggle for\nthe air pumps, then put on the fishbowl and went about unattaching the\nsuit from the ship. When the red light flashed on and off, I spun the\ndoor, opened it, and stepped out onto the rock, moving very cautiously.\nIt isn't that I don't believe the magnets in the boot soles will work,\nit's just that I know for a fact that they won't work if I happen to\nraise both feet at the same time.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI clumped across the crude X to Karpin's dome. The dome had no viewports\nat all, so I wasn't sure Karpin was aware of my presence. I rapped my\nmetal glove on the metal outer door of the lock, and then I was sure.\n\nBut it took him long enough to open up. I had just about decided he'd\njoined his partner in the long sleep when the door cracked open an inch.\nI pushed it open and stepped into the lock, ducking my head. The door\nwas only five feet high, and just as wide as the lock itself, three\nfeet. The other dimensions of the lock were: height, six feet six;\nwidth, one foot. Not exactly room to dance in.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nWhen the red light high on the left-hand wall clicked off, I rapped on\nthe inner door. It promptly opened, I stepped through and removed the\nfishbowl.\n\nKarpin stood in the middle of the room, a small revolver in his hand.\n\"Shut the door,\" he said.\n\nI obeyed, moving slowly. I didn't want that gun to go off by mistake.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Karpin demanded. The M&R man had been right. Ab Karpin\nwas a dead ringer for all those other prospectors I'd seen back at\nAtronics City. Short and skinny and grizzled and ageless. He could have\nbeen forty, and he could have been ninety, but he was probably somewhere\nthe other side of fifty. His hair was black and limp and thinning,\nruffled in little wisps across his wrinkled pate. His forehead and\ncheeks were lined like a plowed field, and were much the same color. His\neyes were wide apart and small, so deep-set beneath shaggy brows that\nthey seemed black. His mouth was thin, almost lipless. The hand holding\nthe revolver was nothing but bones and blue veins covered with taut\nskin.\n\nHe was wearing a dirty undershirt and an old pair of trousers that had\nbeen cut off raggedly just above his knobby knees. Faded slippers were\non his feet. He had good reason for dressing that way, the temperature\ninside the dome must have been nearly ninety degrees. The dome wasn't\nreflecting away the sun's heat as well as it had when it was young.\n\nI looked at Karpin, and despite the revolver and the tense expression on\nhis face, he was the least dangerous-looking man I'd ever run across.\nAll at once, the idea that this anti-social old geezer had the drive or\nthe imagination to murder his partner seemed ridiculous.\n\nApparently, I spent too much time looking him over, because he said\nagain, \"Who are you?\" And this time he motioned impatiently with the\nrevolver.\n\n\"Stanton,\" I told him. \"Ged Stanton, Tangiers Mutual Insurance. I have\nidentification, but it's in my pants pocket, down inside this suit.\"\n\n\"Get it,\" he said. \"And move slow.\"\n\n\"Right you are.\"\n\nI moved slow, as per directions, and peeled out of the suit, then\nreached into my trouser pocket and took out my ID clip. I flipped it\nopen and showed him the card bearing my signature and picture and right\nthumb-print and the name of the company I represented, and he nodded,\nsatisfied, and tossed the revolver over onto his bed. \"I got to be\ncareful,\" he said. \"I got a big claim here.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" I told him. \"Congratulations for it.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, but he still looked peevish. \"You're here about\nJafe's insurance, right?\"\n\n\"That I am.\"\n\n\"Don't want to pay up, I suppose. That doesn't surprise me.\"\n\nBlunt old men irritate me. \"Well,\" I said, \"we do have to investigate.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"You want some coffee?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You can sit in that chair there. That was Jafe's.\"\n\nI settled gingerly in the cloth-and-plastic foldaway chair he'd pointed\nat, and he went over to the kitchen area of the dome to start coffee. I\ntook the opportunity to look the dome over. It was the first portable\ndome I'd ever been inside.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nIt was all one room, roughly circular, with a diameter of about fifteen\nfeet. The sides went straight up for the first seven feet, then curved\ngradually inward to form the roof. At the center of the dome, the\nceiling was about twelve feet high.\n\nThe floor of the room was simply the asteroidal rock surface, not\ncompletely level and smooth. There were two chairs and a table to the\nright of the entry lock, two foldaway cots around the wall beyond them,\nthe kitchen area next and a cluttered storage area around on the other\nside. There was a heater standing alone in the center of the room, but\nit certainly wasn't needed now. Sweat was already trickling down the\nback of my neck and down my forehead into my eyebrows. I peeled off my\nshirt and used it to wipe sweat from my face. \"Warm in here,\" I said.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" he muttered, which I found hard to believe.\n\nHe brought over the coffee, and I tasted it. It was rotten, as bitter as\nthis old hermit's soul, but I said, \"Good coffee. Thanks a lot.\"\n\n\"I like it strong,\" he said.\n\nI looked around at the room again. \"All the comforts of home, eh? Pretty\ningenious arrangement.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he said sourly. \"How about getting to the point, Mister?\"\n\nThere's only one way to handle a blunt old man. Be blunt right back.\n\"I'll tell you how it is,\" I said. \"The company isn't accusing you of\nanything, but it has to be sure everything's on the up and up before it\npays out any ten thousand credits. And your partner just happening to\nfill out that cash-return form just before he died--well, you've got to\nadmit it is a funny kind of coincidence.\"\n\n\"How so?\" He slurped coffee, and glowered at me over the cup. \"We made\nthis strike here,\" he said. \"We knew it was the big one. Jafe had that\ninsurance policy of his in case he never did make the big strike. As\nsoon as we knew this was the big one, he said, 'I guess I don't need\nthat retirement now,' and sat right down and wrote out the cash-return.\nThen we opened a bottle of liquor and celebrated, and he got himself\nkilled.\"\n\nThe way Karpin said it, it sounded smooth and natural. _Too_ smooth and\nnatural. \"How did this accident happen anyway?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I'm not one hundred per cent sure of that myself,\" he said. \"I was\npretty well drunk myself by that time. But he put on his suit and said\nhe was going out to paint the X. He was falling all over himself, and I\ntried to tell him it could wait till we'd had some sleep, but he\nwouldn't pay any attention to me.\"\n\n\"So he went out,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"He went out first. After a couple minutes, I got lonesome in\nhere, so I suited up and went out after him. It happened just as I was\ngoing out the lock, and I just barely got a glimpse of what happened.\"\n\n       *       *       *\n\nHe attacked the coffee again, noisily, and I prompted him, saying, \"What\ndid happen, Mister Karpin?\"\n\n\"Well, he was capering around out there, waving the paint tube and such.\nThere's a lot of sharp rock sticking out around here. Just as I got\noutside, he lost his balance and kicked out, and scraped right into some\nof that rock, and punctured his suit.\"\n\n\"I thought the body was lost,\" I said.\n\nHe nodded. \"It was. The last thing in life Jafe ever did was try to\nshove himself away from those rocks. That, and the force of air coming\nout of that puncture for the first second or two, was enough to throw\nhim up off the surface. It threw him up too high, and he never got back\ndown.\"\n\nMy doubt must have showed in my face, because he added, \"Mister, there\nisn't enough gravity on this place to shoot craps with.\"\n\nHe was right. As we talked, I kept finding myself holding unnecessarily\ntight to the arms of the chair. I kept having the feeling I was going to\nfloat out of the chair and hover around up at the top of the dome if I\nwere to let go. It was silly of course--there was _some_ gravity on that\nplanetoid, after all--but I just don't seem to get used to low-gee.\n\nNevertheless, I still had some more questions. \"Didn't you try to get\nhis body back? Couldn't you have reached him?\"\n\n\"I tried to, Mister,\" he said. \"Old Jafe McCann was my partner for\nfifteen years. But I was drunk, and that's a fact. And I was afraid to\ngo jumping up in the air, for fear _I'd_ go floating away, too.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" I said, \"I'm no expert on low gravity and asteroids. But\nwouldn't McCann's body just go into orbit around this rock? I mean, it\nwouldn't simply go floating off into space, would it?\"\n\n\"It sure would,\" he said. \"There's a lot of other rocks out here, too,\nMister, and a lot of them are bigger than this one and have a lot more\ngravity pull. I don't suppose there's a navigator in the business who\ncould have computed Jafe's course in advance. He floated up, and then he\nfloated back over the dome here and seemed to hover for a couple\nminutes, and then he just floated out and away. His isn't the only body\ncircling around the sun with all these rocks, you know.\"\n\nI chewed a lip and thought it all over. I didn't know enough about\nasteroid gravity or the conditions out here to be able to say for sure\nwhether Karpin's story was true or not. Up to this point, I couldn't\nattack the problem on a fact basis. I had to depend on _feeling_ now,\nthe hunches and instincts of eight years in this job, hearing some\npeople tell lies and other people tell the truth.\n\nAnd my instinct said Ab Karpin was lying in his teeth. That dramatic\nlittle touch about McCann's body hovering over the dome before\ndisappearing into the void, that sounded more like the embellishment of\nfiction than the circumstance of truth. And the string of coincidences\nwere just too much. McCann just coincidentally happens to die right\nafter he and his partner make their big strike. He happens to write out\nthe cash-return form just before dying. And his body just happens to\nfloat away, so nobody can look at it and check Karpin's story.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nBut no matter what my instinct said, the story was smooth. It was smooth\nas glass, and there was no place for me to get a grip on it.\n\nWhat now? There wasn't any hole in Karpin's story, at least none that I\ncould see. I had to break his story somehow, and in order to do that I\nhad to do some nosing around on this planetoid. I couldn't know in\nadvance what I was looking for, I could only look. I'd know it when I\nfound it. It would be something that conflicted with Karpin's story.\n\nAnd for that, I had to be sure the story was complete. \"You said McCann\nhad gone out to paint the X,\" I said. \"Did he paint it?\"\n\nKarpin shook his head. \"He never got a chance. He spent all his time\ndancing, up till he went and killed himself.\"\n\n\"So you painted it yourself.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"And then you went on into Atronics City and registered your claim, is\nthat the story?\"\n\n\"No. Chemisant City was closer than Atronics City right then, so I went\nthere. Just after Jafe's death, and everything--I didn't feel like being\nalone any more than I had to.\"\n\n\"You said Chemisant City was closer to you _then_,\" I said. \"Isn't it\nnow?\"\n\n\"Things move around a lot out here, Mister,\" he said. \"Right now,\nChemisant City's almost twice as far from here as Atronics City. In\nabout three days, it'll start swinging in closer again. Things keep\nshifting around out here.\"\n\n\"So I've noticed,\" I said. \"When you took off to go to Chemisant City,\ndidn't you make a try for your partner's body then?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"He was long out of sight by then,\" he said. \"That\nwas ten, eleven hours later, when I took off.\"\n\n\"Why's that? All you had to do was paint the X and take off.\"\n\n\"Mister, I told you. I was drunk. I was falling down drunk, and when I\nsaw I couldn't get at Jafe, and he was dead anyway, I came back in here\nand slept it off. Maybe if I'd been sober I would have taken the scooter\nand gone after him, but I was _drunk_.\"\n\n\"I see.\" And there just weren't any more questions I could think of to\nask, not right now. So I said, \"I've just had a shaky four-hour ride\ncoming out here. Mind if I stick around a while before going back?\"\n\n\"Help yourself,\" he said, in a pretty poor attempt at genial\nhospitality. \"You can sleep over, if you want.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"I think I'd like that.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't happen to play cribbage, would you?\" he asked, with the\nfirst real sign of animation I'd seen in him yet.\n\n\"I learn fast,\" I told him.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"I'll teach you.\" And he produced a filthy deck of\ncards and taught me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter losing nine straight games of cribbage, I quit, and got to my\nfeet. I was at my most casual as I stretched and said, \"Okay if I wander\naround outside for a while? I've never been on an asteroid like this\nbefore. I mean, a little one like this. I've just been to the company\ncities up to now.\"\n\n\"Go right ahead,\" he said. \"I've got some polishing and patching to do,\nanyway.\" He made his voice sound easy and innocent, but I noticed his\neyes were alert and wary, watching me as I struggled back into my suit.\n\nI didn't bother to put my shirt back on first, and that was a mistake.\nThe temperature inside an atmosphere suit is a steady sixty-eight\ndegrees. That had never seemed particularly chilly before, but after\nthe heat of that dome, it seemed cold as a blizzard inside the suit.\n\nI went on out through the airlock, and moved as briskly as possible in\nthe cumbersome suit, while the sweat chilled on my back and face, and I\naccepted the glum conviction that one thing I was going to get out of\nthis trip for sure was a nasty head cold.\n\nI went over to the X first, and stood looking at it. It was just an X,\nthat's all, shakily scrawled in yellow paint, with the initials \"J-A\"\nscrawled much smaller beside it.\n\nI left the X and clumped away. The horizon was practically at arm's\nlength, so it didn't take long for the dome to be out of sight. And then\nI clumped more slowly, studying the surface of the asteroid.\n\nWhat I was looking for was a grave. I believed that Karpin was lying,\nthat he had murdered his partner. And I didn't believe that Jafe\nMcCann's body had floated off into space. I was convinced that his body\nwas still somewhere on this asteroid. Karpin had been forced to concoct\na story about the body being lost because the appearance of the body\nwould prove somehow that it had been murder and not accident. I was\nconvinced of that, and now all I had to do was prove it.\n\nBut that asteroid was a pretty unlikely place for a grave. That wasn't\ndirt I was walking on, it was rock, solid metallic rock. You don't dig a\ngrave in solid rock, not with a shovel. You maybe can do it with\ndynamite, but that won't work too well if your object is to keep anybody\nfrom seeing that the hole has been made. Dirt can be patted down.\nBlown-up rock looks like blown-up rock, and that's all there is to it.\n\nI considered crevices and fissures in the surface, some cranny large\nenough for Karpin to have stuffed the body into. But I didn't find any\nof these either as I plodded along, being sure to keep one magnetted\nboot always in contact with the ground.\n\nKarpin and McCann had set their dome up at just about the only really\nlevel spot on that entire planetoid. The rest of it was nothing but\njagged rock, and it wasn't easy traveling at all, maneuvering around\nwith magnets on my boots and a bulky atmosphere suit cramping my\nmovements.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nAnd then I stopped and looked out at space and cursed myself for a\nring-tailed baboon. McCann's body might be anywhere in the Solar System,\nanywhere at all, but there was one place I could be sure it wasn't, and\nthat place was this asteroid. No, Karpin had not blown a grave or\nstuffed the body into a fissure in the ground. Why not? Because this\nchunk of rock was valuable, that's why not. Because Karpin was in the\nprocess of selling it to one of the major companies, and that company\nwould come along and chop this chunk of rock to pieces, getting the\nvaluable metal out, and McCann's body would turn up in the first week of\noperations if Karpin were stupid enough to bury it here.\n\nTen hours between McCann's death and Karpin's departure for Chemisant\nCity. He'd admitted that already. And I was willing to bet he'd spent at\nleast part of that time carrying McCann's body to some other asteroid,\none he was sure was nothing but worthless rock. If that were true, it\nmeant the mortal remains of Jafe McCann were now somewhere--_anywhere_--in\nthe Asteroid Belt. Even if I assumed that the body had been hidden on an\nasteroid somewhere between here and Chemisant City--which wasn't\nnecessarily so--that wouldn't help at all. The relative positions of\nplanetoids in the Belt just keep on shifting. A small chunk of rock that\nwas between here and Chemisant City a few weeks ago--it could be almost\nanywhere in the Belt right now.\n\nThe body, that was the main item. I'd more or less counted on finding it\nsomehow. At the moment, I couldn't think of any other angle for\nattacking Karpin's story.\n\nAs I clopped morosely back to the dome, I nibbled at Karpin's story in\nmy mind. For instance, why go to Chemisant City? It was closer, he said,\nbut it couldn't have been closer by more than a couple of hours. The way\nI understood it, Karpin was well-known back on Atronics City--it was the\nnormal base of operations for he and his partner--and he didn't know a\nsoul at Chemisant City. Did it make sense for him to go somewhere he\nwasn't known after his partner's death, even if it _was_ an hour closer?\nNo, it made a lot more sense for a man in that situation to go where\nhe's known, go someplace where he has friends who'll sympathize with him\nand help him over the shock of losing a partner of fifteen years'\nstanding, even if going there does mean traveling an hour longer.\n\nAnd there was always the cash-return form. That was what I was here\nabout in the first place. It just didn't make sense for McCann to have\nheld up his celebration while he filled out a form that he wouldn't be\nable to mail until he got back to Atronics City. And yet the company's\nhandwriting experts were convinced that it wasn't a forgery, and I could\npretty well take their word for it.\n\nMulling these things over as I tramped back toward the dome, I suddenly\nheard a distant bell ringing way back in my head. The glimmering of an\nidea, not an idea yet but just the hint of one. I wasn't sure where it\nled, or even if it led anywhere at all, but I was going to find out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKarpin opened the doors for me. By the time I'd stripped off the suit he\nwas back to work. He was cleaning the single unit which was his\ncombination stove and refrigerator and sink and garbage disposal.\n\nI looked around the dome again, and I had to admit that a lot of\ningenuity had gone into the manufacture and design of this dome and its\ncontents. The dome itself, when deflated, folded down into an oblong box\nthree feet by one foot by one foot. The lock itself, of course, folded\nseparately, into another box somewhat smaller than that.\n\nAs for the gear inside the dome, it was functional and collapsible, and\nthere wasn't a single item there that wasn't needed. There were the two\nchairs and the two cots and the table, all of them foldaway. There was\nthat fantastic combination job Karpin was cleaning right now, and that\nhad dimensions of four feet by three feet by three feet. The clutter of\ngear over to the left wasn't as much of a clutter as it looked. There\nwas a Geiger counter, an automatic spectrograph, two atmosphere suits, a\ntorsion densimeter, a core-cutting drill, a few small hammers and picks,\ntwo spare air tanks, boxes of food concentrate, a paint tube, a doorless\njimmy-john and two small metal boxes about eight inches cube. These last\nwere undoubtedly Karpin's and McCann's pouches, where they kept whatever\nletters, money, address books or other small bits of possessions they\nowned. Back of this mound of gear, against the wall, stood the air\nreconditioner, humming quietly to itself.\n\nIn this small enclosed space there was everything a man needed to keep\nhimself alive. Everything except human company. And if you didn't need\nhuman company, then you had everything. Just on the other side of that\ndome, there was a million miles of death, in a million possible ways. On\nthis side of the dome, life was cozy, if somewhat Spartan and very hot.\n\nI knew for sure I was going to get a head cold. My body had adjusted to\nthe sixty-eight degrees inside the suit, finally, and now was very\nannoyed to find the temperature shooting up to ninety again.\n\nSince Karpin didn't seem inclined to talk, and I would rather spend my\ntime thinking than talking anyway, I took a hint from him and did some\ncleaning. I'd noticed a smeared spot about nose-level on the faceplate\nof my fishbowl, and now was as good a time as any to get rid of it. It\nhad a tendency to make my eyes cross.\n\nMy shirt was sodden and wrinkled by this time anyway, having first been\nused to wipe sweat from my face and later been rolled into a ball and\nleft on the chair when I went outside, so I used it for a cleaning rag,\nbuffing like mad the silvered surface of the faceplate. Faceplates are\nsilvered, not so the man inside can look out and no one else can look\nin, but in order to keep some of the more violent rays of the sun from\ngetting through to the face.\n\nI buffed for a while, and then I put the fishbowl on my head and looked\nthrough it. The spot was gone, so I went over and reattached it to the\nrest of the suit, and then settled back in my chair again and lit a\ncigarette.\n\nKarpin spoke up. \"Wish you wouldn't smoke. Makes it tough on the\nconditioner.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"Sorry.\" So I just sat, thinking morosely about non-forged\ncash-return forms, and coincidences, and likely spots to hide a body in\nthe Asteroid Belt.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nWhere would one dispose of a body in the asteroids? I went back through\nmy thinking on that topic, and I found holes big enough to drive\nKarpin's claim through. This idea of leaving the body on some worthless\nchunk of rock, for instance. If Karpin had killed his partner--and I was\ndead sure he had--he'd planned it carefully and he wouldn't be leaving\nanything to chance. Now, an asteroid isn't worthless to a prospector\nuntil that prospector has landed on it and tested it. _Karpin_ might\nknow that such-and-such an asteroid was nothing but worthless stone, but\nthe guy who stops there and finds McCann's body might _not_ know it.\n\nNo, Karpin wouldn't leave that to chance. He would get rid of that body,\nand he would do it in such a way that nobody would _ever_ find it.\n\nHow? Not by leaving it on a worthless asteroid, and not by just pushing\nit off into space. The distance between asteroids is large, but so's the\ntravel. McCann's body, floating around in the blackness, might just be\nfound by somebody.\n\nAnd that, so far as I could see, eliminated the possibilities. McCann's\nbody was in the Belt. I'd eliminated both the asteroids themselves and\nthe space around the asteroids as hiding places. What was left?\n\nThe sun, of course.\n\nI thought that over for a while, rather surprised at myself for having\nnoticed the possibility. Now, let's say Karpin attaches a small rocket\nto McCann's body, stuffed into its atmosphere suit. He sets the rocket\ngoing, and off goes McCann. Not that he aims it toward the sun, that\nwouldn't work well at all. Instead of falling into the sun, the body\nwould simply take up a long elliptical orbit _around_ the sun, and would\ncome back to the asteroids every few hundred years. No, he would aim\nMcCann _back_, in the direction opposite to the direction or rotation of\nthe asteroids. He would, in essence, slow McCann's body down, make it\npractically stop in relation to the motion of the asteroids. And then it\nwould simply _fall_ into the sun.\n\nNone of my ideas, it seemed, were happy ones. If McCann's body were even\nat this moment falling toward the sun, it was just as useful to me as if\nit were on some other asteroid.\n\nBut, wait a second. Karpin and McCann had worked with the minimum of\nequipment, I'd already noticed that. They didn't have extras of\nanything, and they certainly wouldn't have extra rockets. Except for one\nfast trip to Chemisant City--when he had neither the time nor the excuse\nto buy a jato rocket--Karpin had spent all of his time since McCann's\ndeath right here on this planetoid.\n\nSo that killed that idea.\n\nWhile I was hunting around for some other idea, Karpin spoke up again,\nfor the first time in maybe twenty minutes. \"You think I killed him,\ndon't you?\" he said, not looking around from his cleaning job.\n\nI considered my answer. There was no reason at all to be overly polite\nto this sour old buzzard, but at the same time I am naturally the\nsoft-spoken type. \"We aren't sure,\" I said. \"We just think there are\nsome odd items to be explained.\"\n\n\"Such as what?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Such as the timing of McCann's cash-return form.\"\n\n\"I already explained that,\" he said.\n\n\"I know. You've explained everything.\"\n\n\"He wrote it out himself,\" the old man insisted. He put down his\ncleaning cloth, and turned to face me. \"I suppose your company checked\nthe handwriting already, and Jafe McCann is the one who wrote that\nform.\"\n\nHe was so blasted sure of himself. \"It would seem that way,\" I said.\n\n\"What other odd items you worried about?\" he asked me, in a rusty\nattempt at sarcasm.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"there's this business of going to Chemisant City. It\nwould have made more sense for you to go to Atronics City, where you\nwere known.\"\n\n\"Chemisant was closer,\" he said. He shook a finger at me. \"That company\nof yours thinks it can cheat me out of my money,\" he said. \"Well, it\ncan't. I know my rights. That money belongs to me.\"\n\n\"I guess you're doing pretty well without McCann,\" I said.\n\nHis angry expression was replaced by one of bewilderment. \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"They told me back at Atronics City,\" I explained, \"that McCann was the\nmoney expert and you were the metals expert, and that's why McCann\nhandled all your buying on credit and stuff like that. Looks as though\nyou've got a pretty keen eye for money yourself.\"\n\n\"I know what's mine,\" he mumbled, and turned away. He went back to\nscrubbing the stove coils again.\n\nI stared at his back. Something had happened just then, and I wasn't\nsure what. He'd just been starting to warm up to a tirade against the\ndirty insurance company, and all of a sudden he'd folded up and shut up\nlike a clam.\n\nAnd then I saw it. Or at least I saw part of it. I saw how that\ncash-return form fit in, and how it made perfect sense.\n\nNow, all I needed was proof of murder. Preferably a body. I had the rest\nof it. Then I could pack the old geezer back to Atronics City and get\nproof for the part I'd already figured out.\n\nI'd like that. I'd like getting back to Atronics City, and having this\nall straightened out, and then taking the very next liner straight back\nto Earth. More immediately, I'd like getting out of this heat and back\ninto the cool sixty-eight degrees of--\n\nAnd then it hit me. The whole thing hit me, and I just sat there and\nstared. They did not carry extras, Karpin and McCann, they did not carry\none item of equipment more than they needed.\n\nI sat there and looked at the place where the dead body was hidden, and\nI said, \"Well, I'll be a son of a gun!\"\n\nHe turned and looked at me, and then he followed the direction of my\ngaze, and he saw what I was staring at, and he made a jump across the\nroom at the revolver lying on the cot.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nThat's what saved me. He moved too fast, jerked his muscles too hard,\nand went sailing up and over the cot and ricocheted off the dome wall.\nAnd that gave me plenty of time to get up from the chair, moving more\ncautiously than he had, and get my hands on the revolver before he could\nget himself squared away again.\n\nI straightened with the gun in my hand and looked into a face white with\nfrustration and rage. \"Okay, Mister McCann,\" I said. \"It's all over.\"\n\nHe knew I had him, but he tried not to show it. \"What are you talking\nabout? McCann's dead.\"\n\n\"Sure he is,\" I said. \"Jafe McCann was the money-minded part of the\nteam. He was the one who signed for all the loans and all the equipment\nbought on credit. With this big strike in, Jafe McCann was the one who'd\nhave to pay all that money.\"\n\n\"You're babbling,\" he snapped, but the words were hollow.\n\n\"You weren't satisfied with half a loaf,\" I said. \"You should have been.\nHalf a loaf is better than none. But you wanted every penny you could\nget your hands on, and you wanted to pay out just as little money as you\npossibly could. So when you killed Ab Karpin, you saw a way to kill your\ndebts as well. You'd _become_ Ab Karpin, and it would be Jafe McCann who\nwas dead, and the debts dead with him.\"\n\n\"That's a lie,\" he said, his voice getting shrill. \"_I'm_ Ab Karpin, and\nI've got papers to prove it.\"\n\n\"Sure. Papers you stole from a dead man. And you might have gotten away\nwith it, too. But you just couldn't leave well enough alone, could you?\nNot satisfied with having the whole claim to yourself, you switched\nidentities with your victim to avoid your debts. And not satisfied with\n_that_, you filled out a cash-return form and tried to collect your\nmoney as your own heir. _That's_ why you had to go to Chemisant City,\nwhere nobody would recognize Ab Karpin or Jafe McCann, rather than to\nAtronics City where you were well-known.\"\n\n\"You don't want to make too many wild accusations,\" he shouted, his\nvoice shaking. \"You don't want to go around accusing people of things\nyou can't prove.\"\n\n\"I can prove it,\" I told him. \"I can prove everything I've said. As to\nwho you are, there's no problem. All I have to do is bring you back to\nAtronics City. There'll be plenty of people there to identify you. And\nas to proving you murdered Ab Karpin, I think his body will be proof\nenough, don't you?\"\n\nMcCann watched me as I backed slowly around the room to the mound of\ngear. The partners had had no extra equipment, no extra equipment at\nall. I looked down at the two atmosphere suits lying side by side on the\nmetallic rock floor.\n\n_Two_ atmosphere suits. The dead man was supposed to be in one of those,\nfloating out in space somewhere. He was in the suit, right enough, I was\nsure of that, but he wasn't floating anywhere.\n\nA space suit is a perfect place to hide a body, for as long as it has to\nbe hid. The silvered faceplate keeps you from seeing inside, and the\nsuit is, naturally, a sealed atmosphere. A body can rot away to ashes\ninside a space suit, and you'll never notice a thing on the outside.\n\n       *       *       *\n\nI'd had the right idea after all. McCann had planned to get rid of\nKarpin's body by attaching a rocket to it, slowing it down, and letting\nit fall into the sun. But he hadn't had an opportunity yet to go buy a\nrocket. He couldn't go to Atronics City, where he could have bought the\nrocket on credit, and he couldn't go to Chemisant City until the claim\nsale went through and he had some money to spend. And in the meantime,\nKarpin's body was perfectly safe, sealed away inside his atmosphere\nsuit.\n\nAnd it would have been safe, too, if McCann hadn't been just a little\nbit too greedy. He could kill his partner and get away with it;\npolicemen on the Belt are even farther apart than the asteroids. He\ncould swindle his creditors and get away with it; they had no way of\nchecking up and no reason to suspect a switch in identities. But when he\ntried to get his own money back from Tangiers Mutual Insurance; _that's_\nwhen he made his mistake.\n\nI studied the two atmosphere suits, at the same time managing to keep a\nwary eye on Jafe McCann, standing rigid and silent across the room.\nWhich one of those suits contained the body of Ab Karpin?\n\nThe one with the new patch on the chest, of course. As I'd guessed,\nMcCann had shot him, and that's why he had the problem of disposing of\nthe body in the first place.\n\nI prodded that suit with my toe. \"He's in there, isn't he?\"\n\n\"You're crazy.\"\n\n\"Think I should open it up and check? It's been almost a month, you\nknow. I imagine he's pretty ripe by now.\"\n\nI reached down to the neck-fastenings on the fishbowl, and McCann\nfinally moved. His arms jerked up, and he cried, \"Don't! He's in there,\nhe's in there! For God's sake, don't open it up!\"\n\nI relaxed. Mission accomplished. \"Crawl into your suit, little man,\" I\nsaid. \"We've got ourselves a trip to make, the three of us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHenderson, as usual, was jovial but stern. \"You did a fine job up there,\nGed,\" he said, with false familiarity. \"Really brilliant work.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" I said. I was holding the last piece of news for\na minute or two, relishing it.\n\n\"But you brought McCann in over a week ago. I don't see why you had to\nstay up at Atronics City at all after that, much less ten days.\"\n\nI sat back in the chair and negligently crossed my legs. \"I just thought\nI'd take a little vacation,\" I said carelessly, and lit a cigarette. I\nflicked ashes in the general direction of the ashtray on Henderson's\ndesk. Some of them made it.\n\n\"A vacation?\" he echoed, eyes widening. Henderson was a company man, a\n_real_ company man. A vacation for him was purgatory, it was separation\nfrom a loved one. \"I don't believe you have a vacation coming,\" he said\nfrostily, \"for at least six months.\"\n\n\"That's what you think, Henny,\" I said.\n\nAll he could do at that was blink.\n\nI went on, enjoying myself hugely. \"I don't like this company,\" I said.\n\"And I don't like this job. And I don't like you. And from now on, I've\ndecided, it's going to be vacation all the time.\"\n\n\"Ged,\" he said, his voice faint, \"what's the matter with you? Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n\n\"I feel well,\" I told him. \"I feel fine. Now, I'll tell you why I spent\nan extra ten days at Atronics City. McCann made and registered the big\nstrike, right?\"\n\nHenderson nodded blankly, apparently not trusting himself to speak.\n\n\"Wrong,\" I said cheerfully. \"McCann went to Chemisant City and filled\nout all the forms required for registering a claim. But every place he\nwas supposed to sign his name he wrote _Ab Karpin_ instead. Jafe McCann\n_never did make a legal registration of his claim_.\"\n\nHenderson just looked fish-eyed.\n\n\"So,\" I went on, \"as soon as I turned McCann over to the law at Atronics\nCity, I went and registered that claim myself. And then I waited around\nfor ten days until the company finished the paperwork involved in buying\nthat claim from me. And then I came straight back here, just to say\ngoodbye to you. Wasn't that nice?\"\n\nHe didn't move.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" I said.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ March 1961.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
