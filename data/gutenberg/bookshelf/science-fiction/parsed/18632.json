Beam Piper\n\n\n  No wonder he'd been so interested in the talk of whether our\n  people accepted these theories!\n\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nReaders who remember the Hon. Stephen Silk, diplomat extraordinary, in\nLONE STAR PLANET (FU, March 1957), later published as A PLANET FOR\nTEXANS (Ace Books), will find the present story a challenging\ndeparture--this possibility that the history we know may not be\nabsolute....\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCROSSROADS OF DESTINY\n\n\nI still have the dollar bill. It's in my box at the bank, and I think\nthat's where it will stay. I simply won't destroy it, but I can think of\nnobody to whom I'd be willing to show it--certainly nobody at the\ncollege, my History Department colleagues least of all. Merely to tell\nthe story would brand me irredeemably as a crackpot, but crackpots are\ntolerated, even on college faculties. It's only when they begin\nproducing physical evidence that they get themselves actively resented.\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I went into the club-car for a nightcap before going back to my\ncompartment to turn in, there were five men there, sitting together.\n\nOne was an Army officer, with the insignia and badges of a Staff\nIntelligence colonel. Next to him was a man of about my own age, with\nsandy hair and a bony, Scottish looking face, who sat staring silently\ninto a highball which he held in both hands. Across the aisle, an\nelderly man, who could have been a lawyer or a banker, was smoking a\ncigar over a glass of port, and beside him sat a plump and slightly too\nwell groomed individual who had a tall colorless drink, probably\ngin-and-tonic. The fifth man, separated from him by a vacant chair,\nseemed to be dividing his attention between a book on his lap and the\nconversation, in which he was taking no part. I sat down beside the\nsandy-haired man; as I did so and rang for the waiter, the colonel was\nsaying:\n\n\"No, that wouldn't. I can think of a better one. Suppose you have\nColumbus get his ships from Henry the Seventh of England and sail under\nthe English instead of the Spanish flag. You know, he did try to get\nEnglish backing, before he went to Spain, but King Henry turned him\ndown. That could be changed.\"\n\nI pricked up my ears. The period from 1492 to the Revolution is my\nspecial field of American history, and I knew, at once, the enormous\ndifference that would have made. It was a moment later that I realized\nhow oddly the colonel had expressed the idea, and by that time the plump\nman was speaking.\n\n\"Yes, that would work,\" he agreed. \"Those kings made decisions, most of\nthe time, on whether or not they had a hangover, or what some court\nfavorite thought.\" He got out a notebook and pen and scribbled briefly.\n\"I'll hand that to the planning staff when I get to New York. That's\nHenry the Seventh, not Henry the Eighth? Right. We'll fix it so that\nColumbus will catch him when he's in a good humor.\"\n\nThat was too much. I turned to the man beside me.\n\n\"What goes on?\" I asked. \"Has somebody invented a time machine?\"\n\nHe looked up from the drink he was contemplating and gave me a grin.\n\n\"Sounds like it, doesn't it? Why, no; our friend here is getting up a\ntelevision program. Tell the gentleman about it,\" he urged the plump man\nacross the aisle.\n\nThe waiter arrived at that moment. The plump man, who seemed to need\nlittle urging, waited until I had ordered a drink and then began telling\nme what a positively sensational idea it was.\n\n\"We're calling it _Crossroads of Destiny_,\" he said. \"It'll be a series,\none half-hour show a week; in each episode, we'll take some historic\nevent and show how history could have been changed if something had\nhappened differently. We dramatize the event up to that point just as it\nreally happened, and then a commentary-voice comes on and announces that\nthis is the Crossroads of Destiny; this is where history could have been\ncompletely changed. Then he gives a resum\u00e9 of what really did happen,\nand then he says, '_But_--suppose so and so had done this and that,\ninstead of such and such.' Then we pick up the dramatization at that\npoint, only we show it the way it might have happened. Like this thing\nabout Columbus; we'll show how it could have happened, and end with\nColumbus wading ashore with his sword in one hand and a flag in the\nother, just like the painting, only it'll be the English flag, and\nColumbus will shout: 'I take possession of this new land in the name of\nHis Majesty, Henry the Seventh of England!'\" He brandished\nhis drink, to the visible consternation of the elderly man beside him.\n\"And then, the sailors all sing _God Save the King_.\"\n\n\"Which wasn't written till about 1745,\" I couldn't help mentioning.\n\n\"Huh?\" The plump man looked startled. \"Are you sure?\" Then he decided\nthat I was, and shrugged. \"Well, they can all shout, 'God Save King\nHenry!' or 'St. George for England!' or something. Then, at the end, we\nintroduce the program guest, some history expert, a real name, and he\ntells how he thinks history would have been changed if it had happened\nthis way.\"\n\nThe conservatively dressed gentleman beside him wanted to know how long\nhe expected to keep the show running.\n\n\"The crossroads will give out before long,\" he added.\n\n\"The sponsor'll give out first,\" I said. \"History is just one damn\ncrossroads after another.\" I mentioned, in passing, that I taught the\nsubject. \"Why, since the beginning of this century, we've had enough of\nthem to keep the show running for a year.\"\n\n\"We have about twenty already written and ready to produce,\" the plump\nman said comfortably, \"and ideas for twice as many that the planning\nstaff is working on now.\"\n\nThe elderly man accepted that and took another cautious sip of wine.\n\n\"What I wonder, though, is whether you can really say that history can\nbe changed.\"\n\n\"Well, of course--\" The television man was taken aback; one always seems\nto be when a basic assumption is questioned. \"Of course, we only know\nwhat really did happen, but it stands to reason if something had\nhappened differently, the results would have been different, doesn't\nit?\"\n\n\"But it seems to me that everything would work out the same in the long\nrun. There'd be some differences at the time, but over the years\nwouldn't they all cancel out?\"\n\n\"_Non, non, Monsieur!_\" the man with the book, who had been outside the\nconversation until now, told him earnestly. \"Make no mistake; 'istoree\ncan be shange'!\"\n\nI looked at him curiously. The accent sounded French, but it wasn't\nquite right. He was some kind of a foreigner, though; I'd swear that he\nnever bought the clothes he was wearing in this country. The way the\nsuit fitted, and the cut of it, and the shirt-collar, and the necktie.\nThe book he was reading was Langmuir's _Social History of the American\nPeople_--not one of my favorites, a bit too much on the doctrinaire\nside, but what a bookshop clerk would give a foreigner looking for\nsomething to explain America.\n\n\"What do you think, Professor?\" the plump man was asking me.\n\n\"It would work out the other way. The differences wouldn't cancel out;\nthey'd accumulate. Say something happened a century ago, to throw a\npresidential election the other way. You'd get different people at the\nhead of the government, opposite lines of policy taken, and eventually\nwe'd be getting into different wars with different enemies at different\ntimes, and different batches of young men killed before they could marry\nand have families--different people being born or not being born. That\nwould mean different ideas, good or bad, being advanced; different books\nwritten; different inventions, and different social and economic\nproblems as a consequence.\"\n\n\"Look, he's only giving himself a century,\" the colonel added. \"Think of\nthe changes if this thing we were discussing, Columbus sailing under the\nEnglish flag, had happened. Or suppose Leif Ericson had been able to\nplant a permanent colony in America in the Eleventh Century, or if the\nSaracens had won the Battle of Tours. Try to imagine the world today if\nany of those things had happened. One thing you can be sure of--any\nerrors you make in trying to imagine such a world will be on the side of\nover-conservatism.\"\n\nThe sandy-haired man beside me, who had been using his highball for a\ncrystal ball, must have glimpsed in it what he was looking for. He\nfinished the drink, set the empty glass on the stand-tray beside him,\nand reached back to push the button.\n\n\"I don't think you realize just how good an idea you have, here,\" he\ntold the plump man abruptly. \"If you did, you wouldn't ruin it with such\ntimid and unimaginative treatment.\"\n\nI thought he'd been staying out of the conversation because it was over\nhis head. Instead, he had been taking the plump man's idea apart,\nexamining all the pieces, and considering what was wrong with it and how\nit could be improved. The plump man looked startled, and then\nangry--timid and unimaginative were the last things he'd expected his\nidea to be called. Then he became uneasy. Maybe this fellow was a\ntypical representative of his lord and master, the faceless abstraction\ncalled the Public.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"Misplaced emphasis. You shouldn't emphasize the event that could have\nchanged history; you should emphasize the changes that could have been\nmade. You're going to end this show you were talking about with a shot\nof Columbus wading up to the beach with an English flag, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Well, that's the logical ending.\"\n\n\"That's the logical beginning,\" the sandy-haired man contradicted. \"And\nafter that, your guest historian comes on; how much time will he be\nallowed?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe three or four minutes. We can't cut the dramatization too\nshort--\"\n\n\"And he'll have to explain, a couple of times, and in words of one\nsyllable, that what we have seen didn't really happen, because if he\ndoesn't, the next morning half the twelve-year-old kids in the country\nwill be rushing wild-eyed into school to slip the teacher the real\ninside about the discovery of America. By the time he gets that done,\nhe'll be able to mumble a couple of generalities about vast and\nincalculable effects, and then it'll be time to tell the public about\nWidgets, the really safe cigarettes, all filter and absolutely free from\ntobacco.\"\n\nThe waiter arrived at this point, and the sandy-haired man ordered\nanother rye highball. I decided to have another bourbon on the rocks,\nand the TV impresario said, \"Gin-and-tonic,\" absently, and went into a\nreverie which lasted until the drinks arrived. Then he came awake again.\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" he said. \"Most of the audience would wonder what\ndifference it would have made where Columbus would have gotten his\nships, as long as he got them and America got discovered. I can see it\nwould have made a hell of a big difference. But how could it be handled\nany other way? How could you figure out just what the difference would\nhave been?\"\n\n\"Well, you need a man who'd know the historical background, and you'd\nneed a man with a powerful creative imagination, who is used to using it\ninside rigorously defined limits. Don't try to get them both in one; a\ncollaboration would really be better. Then you work from the known\nsituation in Europe and in America in 1492, and decide on the immediate\neffects. And from that, you have to carry it along, step by step, down\nto the present. It would be a lot of hard and very exacting work, but\nthe result would be worth it.\" He took a sip from his glass and added:\n\"Remember, you don't have to prove that the world today would be the way\nyou set it up. All you have to do is make sure that nobody else would be\nable to prove that it wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Well, how could you present that?\"\n\n\"As a play, with fictional characters and a plot; time, the present,\nunder the changed conditions. The plot--the reason the coward conquers\nhis fear and becomes a hero, the obstacle to the boy marrying the girl,\nthe reason the innocent man is being persecuted--will have to grow out\nof this imaginary world you've constructed, and be impossible in our\nreal world. As long as you stick to that, you're all right.\"\n\n\"Sure. I get that.\" The plump man was excited again; he was about half\nsold on the idea. \"But how will we get the audience to accept it? We're\nasking them to start with an assumption they know isn't true.\"\n\n\"Maybe it is, in another time-dimension,\" the colonel suggested. \"You\ncan't prove it isn't. For that matter, you can't prove there aren't\nother time-dimensions.\"\n\n\"Hah, that's it!\" the sandy-haired man exclaimed. \"World of alternate\nprobability. That takes care of that.\"\n\nHe drank about a third of his highball and sat gazing into the rest of\nit, in an almost yogic trance. The plump man looked at the colonel in\nbafflement.\n\n\"Maybe this alternate-probability time-dimension stuff means something\nto you,\" he said. \"Be damned if it does to me.\"\n\n\"Well, as far as we know, we live in a four-dimensional universe,\" the\ncolonel started.\n\nThe elderly man across from him groaned. \"Fourth dimension! Good God,\nare we going to talk about that?\"\n\n\"It isn't anything to be scared of. You carry an instrument for\nmeasuring in the fourth dimension all the time. A watch.\"\n\n\"You mean it's just time? But that isn't--\"\n\n\"We know of three dimensions of space,\" the colonel told him, gesturing\nto indicate them. \"We can use them for coordinates to locate things, but\nwe also locate things in time. I wouldn't like to ride on a train or a\nplane if we didn't. Well, let's call the time we know, the time your\nwatch registers, Time-A. Now, suppose the entire, infinite extent of\nTime-A is only an instant in another dimension of time, which we'll call\nTime-B. The next instant of Time-B is also the entire extent of Time-A,\nand the next and the next. As in Time-A, different things are happening\nat different instants. In one of these instants of Time-B, one of the\nthings that's happening is that King Henry the Seventh of England is\nfurnishing ships to Christopher Columbus.\"\n\nThe man with the odd clothes was getting excited again.\n\n\"Zees--'ow you say--zees alternate probabeelitay; eet ees a theory\nzhenerally accept' een zees countree?\"\n\n\"Got it!\" the sandy-haired man said, before anybody could answer. He set\nhis drink on the stand-tray and took a big jackknife out of his pocket,\nholding it unopened in his hand. \"How's this sound?\" he asked, and hit\nthe edge of the tray with the back of the knife, _Bong_!\n\n\"Crossroads--of--_Destiny_!\" he intoned, and hit the edge of the tray\nagain, _Bong_! \"This is the year 1959--but not the 1959 of our world,\nfor we are in a world of alternate probability, in another dimension of\ntime; a world parallel to and coexistent with but separate from our own,\nin which history has been completely altered by a single momentous\nevent.\" He shifted back to his normal voice.\n\n\"Not bad; only twenty-five seconds,\" the plump man said, looking up from\nhis wrist watch. \"And a trained announcer could maybe shave five seconds\noff that. Yes, something like that, and at the end we'll have another\nthirty seconds, and we can do without the guest.\"\n\n\"But zees alternate probibeelitay, in anozzer dimension,\" the stranger\nwas insisting. \"Ees zees a concept original weet you?\" he asked the\ncolonel.\n\n\"Oh, no; that idea's been around for a long time.\"\n\n\"I never heard of it before now,\" the elderly man said, as though that\ncompletely demolished it.\n\n\"Zen eet ees zhenerally accept' by zee scienteest'?\"\n\n\"Umm, no,\" the sandy-haired man relieved the colonel. \"There's\nabsolutely no evidence to support it, and scientists don't accept\nunsupported assumptions unless they need them to explain something, and\nthey don't need this assumption for anything. Well, it would come in\nhandy to make some of these reports of freak phenomena, like mysterious\nappearances and disappearances, or flying-object sightings, or reported\nfalls of non-meteoric matter, theoretically respectable. Reports like\nthat usually get the ignore-and-forget treatment, now.\"\n\n\"Zen you believe zat zeese ozzer world of zee alternate probabeelitay,\nzey exist?\"\n\n\"No. I don't disbelieve it, either. I've no reason to, one way or\nanother.\" He studied his drink for a moment, and lowered the level in\nthe glass slightly. \"I've said that once in a while things get reported\nthat look as though such other worlds, in another time-dimension, may\nexist. There have been whole books published by people who collect\nstories like that. I must say that academic science isn't very\nhospitable to them.\"\n\n\"You mean, zings sometimes, 'ow-you-say, leak in from one of zees ozzer\nworlds? Zat has been known to 'appen?\"\n\n\"Things have been said to have happened that might, if true, be cases of\nthings leaking through from another time world,\" the sandy-haired man\ncorrected. \"Or leaking away to another time world.\" He mentioned a few\nof the more famous cases of unexplained mysteries--the English diplomat\nin Prussia who vanished in plain sight of a number of people, the ship\nfound completely deserted by her crew, the lifeboats all in place;\nstories like that. \"And there's this rash of alleged sightings of\nunidentified flying objects. I'd sooner believe that they came from\nanother dimension than from another planet. But, as far as I know,\nnobody's seriously advanced this other-time-dimension theory to explain\nthem.\"\n\n\"I think the idea's familiar enough, though, that we can use it as an\nexplanation, or pseudo-explanation, for the program,\" the television man\nsaid. \"Fact is, we aren't married to this Crossroads title, yet; we\ncould just as easily all it _Fifth Dimension_. That would lead the\npublic, to expect something out of the normal before the show started.\"\n\n      *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat got the conversation back onto the show, and we talked for some\ntime about it, each of us suggesting possibilities. The stranger even\nsuggested one--that the Civil War had started during the Jackson\nAdministration. Fortunately, nobody else noticed that. Finally, a porter\ncame through and inquired if any of us were getting off at Harrisburg,\nsaying that we would be getting in in five minutes.\n\nThe stranger finished his drink hastily and got up, saying that he would\nhave to get his luggage. He told us how much he had enjoyed the\nconversation, and then followed the porter toward the rear of the train.\nAfter he had gone out, the TV man chuckled.\n\n\"Was that one an oddball!\" he exclaimed. \"Where the hell do you suppose\nhe got that suit?\"\n\n\"It was a tailored suit,\" the colonel said. \"A very good one. And I\ncan't think of any country in the world in which they cut suits just\nlike that. And did you catch his accent?\"\n\n\"Phony,\" the television man pronounced. \"The French accent of a Greek\nwaiter in a fake French restaurant. In the Bronx.\"\n\n\"Not quite. The pronunciation was all right for French accent, but the\ncadence, the way the word-sounds were strung together, was German.\"\n\nThe elderly man looked at the colonel keenly. \"I see you're\nIntelligence,\" he mentioned. \"Think he might be somebody up your alley,\nColonel?\"\n\nThe colonel shook his head. \"I doubt it. There are agents of unfriendly\npowers in this country--a lot of them, I'm sorry to have to say. But\nthey don't speak accented English, and they don't dress eccentrically.\nYou know there's an enemy agent in a crowd, pick out the most normally\nAmerican type in sight and you usually won't have to look further.\"\n\nThe train ground to a stop. A young couple with hand-luggage came in and\nsat at one end of the car, waiting until other accommodations could be\nfound for them. After a while, it started again. I dallied over my\ndrink, and then got up and excused myself, saying that I wanted to turn\nin early.\n\nIn the next car behind, I met the porter who had come in just before the\nstop. He looked worried, and after a moment's hesitation, he spoke to\nme.\n\n\"Pardon, sir. The man in the club-car who got off at Harrisburg; did you\nknow him?\"\n\n\"Never saw him before. Why?\"\n\n\"He tipped me with a dollar bill when he got off. Later, I looked\nclosely at it. I do not like it.\"\n\nHe showed it to me, and I didn't blame him. It was marked _One Dollar_,\nand _United States of America_, but outside that there wasn't a thing\nright about it. One side was gray, all right, but the other side was\ngreen. The picture wasn't the right one. And there were a lot of other\nthings about it, some of them absolutely ludicrous. It wasn't\ncounterfeit--it wasn't even an imitation of a United States bill.\n\nAnd then it hit me, like a bullet in the chest. Not a bill of _our_\nUnited States. No wonder he had been so interested in whether our\nscientists accepted the theory of other time dimensions and other worlds\nof alternate probability!\n\nOn an impulse, I got out two ones and gave them to the porter--perfectly\ngood United States Bank gold-certificates.\n\n\"You'd better let me keep this,\" I said, trying to make it sound the way\nhe'd think a Federal Agent would say it. He took the bills, smiling, and\nI folded his bill and put it into my vest pocket.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" he said. \"I have no wish to keep it.\"\n\nSome part of my mind below the level of consciousness must have taken\nover and guided me back to the right car and compartment; I didn't\nrealize where I was going till I put on the light and recognized my own\nluggage. Then I sat down, as dizzy as though the two drinks I had had,\nhad been a dozen. For a moment, I was tempted to rush back to the\nclub-car and show the thing to the colonel and the sandy-haired man. On\nsecond thought, I decided against that.\n\nThe next thing I banished from my mind was the adjective \"incredible.\" I\nhad to credit it; I had the proof in my vest pocket. The coincidence\narising from our topic of conversation didn't bother me too much,\neither. It was the topic which had drawn him into it. And, as the\nsandy-haired man had pointed out, we know nothing, one way or another,\nabout these other worlds; we certainly don't know what barriers separate\nthem from our own, or how often those barriers may fail. I might have\nthought more about that if I'd been in physical science. I wasn't; I was\nin American history. So what I thought about was what sort of country\nthat other United States must be, and what its history must have been.\n\nThe man's costume was basically the same as ours--same general style,\nbut many little differences of fashion. I had the impression that it was\nthe costume of a less formal and conservative society than ours and a\nmore casual way of life. It could be the sort of costume into which ours\nwould evolve in another thirty or so years. There was another odd thing.\nI'd noticed him looking curiously at both the waiter and the porter, as\nthough something about them surprised him. The only thing they had in\ncommon was their race, the same as every other passenger-car attendant.\nBut he wasn't used to seeing Chinese working in railway cars.\n\nAnd there had been that remark about the Civil War and the Jackson\nAdministration. I wondered what Jackson he had been talking about; not\nAndrew Jackson, the Tennessee militia general who got us into war with\nSpain in 1810, I hoped. And the Civil War; that had baffled me\ncompletely. I wondered if it had been a class-war, or a sectional\nconflict. We'd had plenty of the latter, during our first century, but\nall of them had been settled peacefully and Constitutionally. Well, some\nof the things he'd read in Lingmuir's _Social History_ would be\nsurprises for him, too.\n\nAnd then I took the bill out for another examination. It must have\ngotten mixed with his spendable money--it was about the size of\nours--and I wondered how he had acquired enough of our money to pay his\ntrain fare. Maybe he'd had a diamond and sold it, or maybe he'd had a\ngun and held somebody up. If he had, I didn't know that I blamed him,\nunder the circumstances. I had an idea that he had some realization of\nwhat had happened to him--the book, and the fake accent, to cover any\nmistakes he might make. Well, I wished him luck, and then I unfolded the\ndollar bill and looked at it again.\n\nIn the first place, it had been issued by the United States Department\nof Treasury itself, not the United States Bank or one of the State\nBanks. I'd have to think over the implications of that carefully. In the\nsecond place, it was a silver certificate; why, in this other United\nStates, silver must be an acceptable monetary metal; maybe equally so\nwith gold, though I could hardly believe that. Then I looked at the\npicture on the gray obverse side, and had to strain my eyes on the fine\nprint under it to identify it. It was Washington, all right, but a much\nolder Washington than any of the pictures of him I had ever seen. Then I\nrealized that I knew just where the Crossroads of Destiny for his world\nand mine had been.\n\nAs every schoolchild among us knows, General George Washington was shot\ndead at the Battle of Germantown, in 1777, by an English, or, rather,\nScottish, officer, Patrick Ferguson--the same Patrick Ferguson who\ninvented the breech-loading rifle that smashed Napoleon's armies.\nWashington, today, is one of our lesser national heroes, because he was\nour first military commander-in-chief. But in this other world, he must\nhave survived to lead our armies to victory and become our first\nPresident, as was the case with the man who took his place when he was\nkilled.\n\nI folded the bill and put it away carefully among my identification\ncards, where it wouldn't a second time get mixed with the money I spent,\nand as I did, I wondered what sort of a President George Washington had\nmade, and what part, in the history of that other United States, had\nbeen played by the man whose picture appears on our dollar\nbills--General and President Benedict Arnold.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Crossroads of Destiny, by Henry Beam Piper\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CROSSROADS OF DESTINY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 18632-8.txt or 18632-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/6/3/18632/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geetu Melwani and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
