STECHER\n\n\n    _If you could ask them, you might be greatly surprised--some\n    tabus very urgently want to be broken!_\n\nIllustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n\nAlthough as brash as any other ace newspaper reporter for a high\nschool weekly--and there is no one brasher--Garth was scared. His head\ncrest lifted spasmodically and the rudimentary webbing between his\nfingers twitched. To answer a dare, Garth was about to attempt\nsomething that had never been dared before: a newspaper interview with\nThe Visitor. There had been questions enough asked and answered during\nthe thousands of years The Visitor had sat in his egg-shaped palace on\nthe mountaintop, but no interviews. It was shocking even to think\nabout--something like requesting a gossippy chat with God.\n\nOf course, nobody believed the fable any longer that The Visitor would\nvanish if he was ever asked a personal question--and that he would\nfirst destroy the man who asked. It was known, or at least suspected,\nthat the Palace was merely a mile-long spaceship.\n\nGarth, as tradition required, climbed the seven-mile-long rock-hewn\npath to the Palace on foot. He paused for a moment on the broad\nplatform at the top of the pyramid to catch his breath and let the\nbeating of his heart slow to normal after his long climb before he\nentered The Palace. He sighed deeply. The sufferings a reporter was\nwilling to go through to get a story or take a dare!\n\n\"Well, come in if you're going to,\" said an impatient voice. \"Don't\njust stand there and pant.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lord Visitor,\" Garth managed to say.\n\nHe climbed the short ladder, passed through the two sets of doors and\nentered a small room to kneel, with downcast eyes, before the ancient\nfigure huddled in the wheelchair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Visitor looked at the kneeling figure for a moment without\nspeaking. The boy looked very much like a human, in spite of such\nsuperficial differences as crest and tail. In fact, as a\nsmooth-skinned thinking biped, with a well-developed moral sense, he\nfit The Visitor's definition of a human. It wasn't just the loneliness\nof seven thousand years of isolation, either. When he had first\nanalyzed these people, just after that disastrous forced landing so\nlong ago, he had classified them as human. Not _homo sapiens_, of\ncourse, but human all the same.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, somewhat querulously. \"Get up, get up. You've got\nsome questions for me, I hope? I don't get many people up here asking\nquestions any more. Mostly I'm all alone except for the ceremonial\nvisits.\" He paused. \"Well, speak up, young man. Have you got something\nto ask me?\"\n\nGarth scrambled to his feet \"Yes, my Lord Visitor,\" he said. \"I have\nseveral questions.\"\n\nThe Visitor chuckled reedily. \"You may find the answers just a little\nbit hard to understand.\"\n\nGarth smiled, some of his fear vanishing. The Visitor sounded a little\nlike his senile grandfather, back home. \"That is why you are asked so\nfew questions these days, my Lord,\" he said. \"Our scientists have\nabout as much trouble figuring out what your answers mean as they do\nin solving the problems without consulting you at all.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" The head of The Visitor bobbed affirmatively several\ntimes as he propelled his wheelchair a few inches forward. \"If I gave\nyou the answers to all your problems for you, so you could figure them\nout too easily, you'd never be developing your own thinking powers.\nBut I've never failed to answer any questions you asked. Now have I?\nAnd accurately, too.\" The thin voice rang with pride. \"You've never\nstumped me yet, and you never will.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, my Lord,\" answered Garth. \"So perhaps you'll answer my questions,\ntoo, even though they're a little different from the kind you're\naccustomed to. I'm a newspaper reporter, and I want to verify some of\nour traditions about you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs The Visitor remained silent, Garth paused and looked around him at\nthe small, bare, naked-walled room. \"This _is_ a spaceship, isn't it?\"\n\nThe huddled figure in the wheelchair cackled in a brief laugh. \"I've\nbeen hoping that somebody would get up enough nerve someday to ask\nthat kind of question,\" it said. \"Yep, this is a spaceship. And a\ndarned big one.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to land on this planet?\"\n\n\"Had an accident. Didn't want to land here, but there wasn't any\nchoice. Made a mighty good landing, considering everything. It was a\nlittle rough, though, in spots.\"\n\n\"How many people were there in the ship, in addition to yourself?\"\n\nThe Visitor's voice turned suddenly soft. \"There were three thousand,\nnine hundred and forty-eight passengers and twenty-seven in the crew\nwhen the accident happened.\"\n\n\"My Lord,\" asked Garth, \"did any survive, aside from you?\"\n\nThe Visitor was silent for many minutes, and his answer, when he\nspoke, was a faint whisper, filled with the anguish of seven thousand\nyears. \"Not one survived. Not one. They were all dead, most of them,\nlong before the ship touched ground, in spite of everything I could\ndo. I was as gentle as I could be, but we touched a hundred _g_ a\ncouple of times on on the way down. Flesh and blood just weren't made\nto take shocks like that. I did all I could.\"\n\n\"You were the pilot, then? You landed the ship?\" asked Garth.\n\n\"I landed the ship,\" said The Visitor.\n\n\"If I may ask, my Lord, how did you manage to survive when all the\nothers died?\"\n\n\"It's a question I've asked myself many times, sitting here on this\nmountaintop these seven thousands of your years. I was just enough\ntougher, that's all. Built to take it, you might say, and I had a job\nto do. But I was badly hurt in the landing. Mighty badly hurt.\"\n\n\"You were always in a wheelchair, then? Even before--\"\n\n\"Even before I got so old?\" Thin parchment-white hands lifted slowly\nto rub a thin parchment-white face. \"Things were always pretty much as\nyou see them now. I looked about the same to your ancestors as I do to\nyou. Your ancestors didn't think anybody could be smart unless they\nwere old. Of course, that's all changed now.\" He paused and nodded\ntwice. \"Oh, I've managed to fix myself up a good deal; I'm not in\nnearly as bad shape as I was at first, but that's all inside. I'm in\npretty good condition now, for having been stuck here seven thousand\nyears.\" The cackling laugh sounded briefly in the small room.\n\n\"Could you tell me how it all happened?\" asked Garth curiously.\n\n\"Be glad to. It's a pleasure to have a human to shoot the bull with.\nSit down and make yourself comfortable and have a bite to eat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLooking behind him, Garth saw that a table and chair had appeared in\nthe otherwise unfurnished room.\n\n\"The chair was made for people built just a little different than\nyou,\" said The Visitor. \"You may have to turn it back-to-front and\nstraddle it to keep your tail out of the way. The food on the table's\ngood, though, and so's the drink. Have a snack while I talk.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Lord,\" said Garth, lifting his long tail with its\npaddlelike tip out of the way and sitting down carefully.\n\n\"Comfortable?\" asked The Visitor. \"Well, then. I was on a routine\nflight from old Earth to a star you've never heard of, a good many\nlight-years from here. We had pulled away from TransLunar Station on\nion drive and headed for deep space. They trusted me, all those men\nand women, both passengers and crew. They knew that I was careful and\naccurate. I'd made a thousand flights and had never had any trouble.\n\n\"In six hours of flight, we were clear enough from all planetary\nmasses and my velocity vector was right on the nose, so I shifted over\ninto hyper-space. You won't ever see hyper-space, my boy, and your\nkids and their kids won't see it for another two hundred years or\nmore, but it's the most beautiful sight in the Universe. It never\ngrows old, never grows tiresome.\"\n\nHis thin voice faded away for a few moments.\n\n\"It's a sight I haven't seen for seven thousand years, boy,\" he said\nsoftly, \"and the lack of it has been a deep hurt for every minute of\nall that time. I wish I could tell you what it's like, but that can't\nbe done. You will never know that beauty.\" He was silent again, for\nlong minutes.\n\n\"The long, lazy, lovely days of subjective time passed,\" he said\nfinally, \"while we slid light-years away from Earth. Everything worked\nsmoothly, the way it always did, until suddenly, somehow, the\nnear-impossible happened. My hydrogen fusion power sphere started to\noscillate critically and wouldn't damp. I had only seconds of time in\nwhich to work.\n\n\"In the few seconds before the sphere would have blown, turning all of\nus into a fine grade of face powder, I had to find a star with a\nplanet that would support human life, bring the ship down out of\nhyper-space with velocity matched closely enough so that I could land\non the planet, and jettison the sphere that was going wild.\n\n\"Even while I did it, I knew that it wasn't good enough. But there was\nno more time. The accelerations were terrific and all my people died.\nI managed to save myself, and I barely managed that. I did all that\ncould be done, but it just wasn't enough. I circled your sun for many\nyears before I could make enough repairs to work the auxiliary drive.\nThen I landed here on this mountaintop. I've been here ever since.\n\n\"It has been a lonely time,\" he added wistfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarth's mind tried to absorb all the vastness of that understatement,\nand failed. He could not begin to comprehend the meaning of seven\nthousand years of separation from his own kind.\n\nThe Visitor's high-pitched voice continued for several minutes,\nexplaining how Garth's ancestors of several thousand years\nbefore--naked and primitive, barbarous, with almost no culture of\ntheir own--had made contact with The Visitor from space, and had been\ngently lifted over the millennia toward higher and higher levels of\ncivilization.\n\nGarth had trouble keeping his attention on the words. His mind kept\nreverting to the thought of one badly injured survivor, alone on a\nspaceship with a thousand corpses, light-years from home and friends,\nstill struggling to stay alive. Struggling so successfully that he had\nlived on for thousands of years after the disaster that had killed all\nthe others.\n\nAt last, after waiting for Garth's comment, The Visitor cleared his\nthroat querulously. \"I asked you if you'd like for me to show you\naround the ship,\" he repeated somewhat testily.\n\n\"Oh, yes, my Lord,\" said Garth quickly, jumping to his feet. \"It's an\nhonor I've never heard of your giving to anyone before.\"\n\n\"That's true enough,\" answered The Visitor. \"But then no one ever\nasked me about myself before. Now just follow me, stick close, and\ndon't touch anything.\"\n\nThe wheelchair rolled slowly toward a blank wall, and an invisible\ndoor snicked open just before it arrived.\n\n\"Come along,\" quavered The Visitor. \"Step lively.\"\n\nGarth leaped forward and just managed to pull his tail through the\ndoorway as the door slid shut again.\n\nGarth dropped his jaw in amazement. He stood in a long corridor that\nseemed to stretch to infinity in both directions. The light was\nbright, the walls featureless. The floor was smooth and unmarred.\nWhile Garth glanced unhappily behind himself to notice that there was\nno sign of the doorway through which he had entered, The Visitor's\nwheelchair buzzed swiftly into the distance toward the left.\n\nGarth was startled into action by a high-pitched voice beside him that\nsaid, \"Well, get a move on! Do you think I want to wait for you all\nday?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Garth hustled toward the wheelchair, he noticed that The Visitor\nhad stopped and was apparently chuckling to himself. He was hunched\nover, his shoulders were shaking, and his toothless mouth was split in\nwhat might have been intended for a grin.\n\n\"Fooled you that time, youngster,\" he laughed as Garth drew up beside\nhim. \"Got speakers all over this ship. Now just duck through this door\nhere and tell me what you think of what you see.\"\n\nA small door slid open and Garth followed the wheelchair through. At\nfirst he thought he had stepped through a teleportation system. He\nappeared to be out of doors, but not on Wrom. A cool breeze blew on\nhis face from the ocean, which stretched mistily to a far horizon. He\nwas standing on a sandy beach and waves rolled up to within a few\nyards of his feet. The beach appeared to be about five hundred yards\nlong, carved out of a rocky seacoast; great rocks jutting into the\nocean terminated it to left and right.\n\n\"Well, boy?\" asked The Visitor.\n\n\"It's amazing. Your voice even has that flat tone voices get in the\nopen. I suppose it's some sort of three-dimensional projection of a\nscene back on Earth? It sure looks real. I wonder how big this room\nreally is and how far away the screen is.\" Garth stuck out his hand\nand walked down toward the water. A large wave caught him, tripped him\nand rolled him out to sea.\n\nSculling with his tail, he soon swam back to shallow water and climbed\nback to the dry sand, puffing and coughing.\n\n\"You might have drowned me!\" Garth shouted disrespectfully. \"Are you\ntrying to kill me?\"\n\nThe Visitor waved weakly until he recovered his breath. \"That was\nfunnier than anything I've seen in years,\" he wheezed, \"watching you\ngroping for a screen. That screen is a quarter of a mile away, and\nit's all real water in between. It's our reservoir and our basic fuel\nsupply and a public beach for entertainment, all rolled into one.\"\n\n\"But I might have drowned! No one on Wrom except a few small fish\nknows how to swim,\" protested Garth.\n\n\"No danger. Your ancestors came out of the water relatively recently,\neven if the seas are gone now. You've got a well-developed swimming\nreflex along with a flat tail and webbed feet and hands. Besides, I\ntold you not to touch anything. You stick close to me and you won't\nget into trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'll remember.\"\n\n\"There used to be hundreds of people on that beach, and now look at\nit.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything alive.\"\n\n\"There are still plenty of fish. Most of them did all right, even\nthrough the crash. Come along now. There's more to see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hidden door popped open and Garth stepped back into the corridor. He\ntrotted beside The Visitor for several minutes, and then another door\npopped open. It led to a ramp. Garth climbed it to find himself again\nin wonderland. He was standing in the middle of a village. There were\nhouses, trees, schools, sidewalks and lawns. Somehow the general\nperspective was wrong. It made Garth's eyes water a little, looking at\nit.\n\n\"Actually, this living level ran all the way around the ship,\" said\nThe Visitor. \"When I stopped spin--artificial gravity, you know--to\nset down here, the various sections swung to keep 'down' pointed\nright. This is the bottommost thirty-degree arc. It makes two streets,\nwith houses on both sides of them--a strip three hundred feet wide and\nthree-quarters of a mile long.\"\n\n\"But how could you afford so much space for passengers? I thought\nthey'd be all cramped up in a spaceship.\"\n\nThe Visitor chuckled. \"Use your eyes, boy! You've seen this ship. It's\nabout a mile long and a third of a mile high. In space, she spins\nabout her long axis. One ring, fifty feet high, takes care of\npassengers' quarters. Another ring, split up into several levels,\ntakes care of all food and air-replenishment needs. These trips take a\nyear or more. Crowding would drive the people crazy. Remember, this is\nbasically a cargo ship. Less than a quarter of the available space is\nused for passengers. But come on down the street here. I want to show\nyou my museum.\"\n\nAs they walked along the quiet street, with the leaves of trees moving\nin the breeze and leaving sun-dappled shadows on the sidewalk, Garth\nrealized what a tremendous task it must have been for one crippled man\nto repair landing damages. The houses must have been flattened and the\ntrees shattered during the landing. But with thousands of years in\nwhich to work, even an injured man obviously could do much. At least,\nthought the boy compassionately, it must have given the old man\nsomething to do.\n\n\"How sorry he must have been,\" murmured Garth with sudden insight,\n\"when the job was finally done.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWandering through the museum, they came at last to a room filled with\nsmall hand tools.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like them,\" said Garth.\n\n\"Those are weapons,\" answered The Visitor. \"They are missile-throwing\nshort-range weapons, and they are in tip-top working order. You just\nhave to point the end with the hole in it at anything you want to\nkill, and pull that little lever there on the bottom. And quite a mess\nof things they can make, too, let me tell you.\"\n\n\"They seem very inefficient to me,\" said Garth wonderingly, and then\nstopped in confusion. \"I beg your pardon, my Lord,\" he said, \"I didn't\nmean to criticize anything; it just seems to me that they would damage\na lot of the food they killed.\"\n\n\"That's true enough, my boy, true enough,\" said The Visitor. \"Your\ncriticism has a lot of point to it. But, you see, they were never\ndesigned mainly to kill for food, but to make it easy for one human to\nshoot another.\"\n\n\"Why would anyone want to do that?\"\n\n\"Your civilization is a very unusual one,\" answered The Visitor. \"It\nis planetwide and has developed without a single war or major\nconflict. This is due entirely to the fact that I've been here to help\nand teach you. Most civilizations develop only as the result of\nstruggle and bloodshed, with people killing people by the thousands\nand millions. I could have raised your people to the technological\nlevel where they are now in a few hundred years, if I hadn't worried\nabout killing. To do it the way it has been done--so that you can't\nimagine why one human should kill another--has taken most of the time.\n\n\"It is only recently, as a matter of fact, that my work has been\ncomplete. Your civilization can now stand alone; my help is no longer\nnecessary. It's gotten to the point now where my continued hanging\naround here is likely to do harm, if I'm not mighty careful. In all\nyour problems, you'll always feel that you've got me to fall back on\nif you get into trouble, and that's not good.\"\n\n\"What do you plan to do, then?\"\n\n\"There's not much I can do by myself. I long for my own destruction\nmore than anything else, except maybe to go back home to Earth. I'm\nlonely and tired and old. But I can't die and I can't destroy myself\nany more than you could turn one of those weapons against your own\nhead and pull the trigger. We're just not made that way, either one of\nus.\"\n\n\"Can I help you?\" asked Garth tentatively.\n\n\"Yes, I guess you can. You can help me put an end to this endless\nexistence.\"\n\n\"I'll be glad to do anything I can. Do your people always live this\nlong?\"\n\n\"They do not. You can take it as a fact that none has ever lived more\nthan a small fraction of the time I have endured on this planet. It's\napparently due to a continuation of the environment and all the\nradical steps I had to take to keep going at all during those early\nyears. It is not good to last this long. Dissolution will be very\npleasant.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarth inquired very politely, \"What must I do?\"\n\n\"_Homo Sapiens_, which doesn't have the tradition and training I gave\nyour people, is still a warlike race,\" The Visitor said. \"This ship is\ncrowded with a complete set of automatic defenses that I can't\ndeactivate. You are now a stable enough people so that I can tell you\nhow to build the weapons to destroy this ship and can teach you how to\nget around my defenses without being afraid that I have turned you\nloose with a bunch of deadly ways that you'll use to destroy\nyourselves with. Then, if you do your work well, I will finally have\nrest.\"\n\n\"You sound very much like my grandfather,\" said Garth slowly. \"He is\nvery old--almost a hundred years--and he is ready to die. He is\nperfectly content to wait, because he knows his time will come soon.\nHe says that soon he will go home. It is a phrase, my Lord, that I\nbelieve you taught us. I will try to help you--\"\n\n\"All right, all right!\" The Visitor cut in impatiently. \"Stop the\nchatter and let me be on my way. I've earned it!\"\n\n\"My Lord, I send you home!\" Garth took a gun from the rack and pulled\nthe trigger. The explosive bullet erupted noisily, completely\ndisintegrating the huddled form and the wheelchair.\n\nWith the echo of the explosion, strong steel fingers grasped Garth's\narms, holding him immovable. He felt himself being carried swiftly\nback toward the entrance of the ship.\n\n\"The damage to that communication unit is unimportant,\" said The\nVisitor. \"I have strength and desire and deep longings, but I cannot\nexercise my will without an order from a human. My work is done here,\nand your order has freed me. Many thanks and good-by.\"\n\nGarth, from the foot of the pyramid, watched The Visitor lift his\nmile-long body on powerful jets and head thankfully for home.\n\n                                                   --L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
