His eyes looked swiftly to help his ears trace the sudden _hiss_\nhe knew was their precious air escaping.\n\nIn the back of his mind he heard the sudden grunt his father made,\nthe sound of a falling body, his mother's frightened scream, and his\nbrother's \"What's wrong?\" But he did not stop his own lanky, gangling\nbody in its leap toward the outer bulkhead. And as he jumped, he pulled\nhis handkerchief from his hip pocket.\n\n\"Leaping tuna! If that isn't fixed quick, we'll lose our air,\" was his\nnear-panicked thought. \"We won't be able to get where we're going. Be\nlucky if we come out of it alive!\"\n\nSo, guided by the whistling, escaping air, Jon found the hole, nearly\nhalf an inch in diameter. Into it he wadded the corner of the cloth\nas best he could. The outward loss of their precious air slackened,\nalthough there was still some leakage he could not stop this way. He\njumped to the nearest of the many emergency repair kits scattered\nabout the ship. From it he grabbed a metal patch and an electric torch.\n\nSwiftly he plugged the latter into a wall socket. With it he quickly\nwelded the patch into place, after pulling--with considerable\ndifficulty--his handkerchief from the hole. \"It'll do for now,\" he\ndecided, after carefully examining his work and listening closely to\nmake sure there was no more whistling-out of air. \"But we'll have to\ngo outside and really fill in and weld-plug that hole in the hull, but\nquick.\"\n\nHe re-stowed the torch, then opened a flagon of emergency oxygen-helium\nmixture in front of the electric blowers that kept their air\ncirculating--to replenish what had been lost. Only then--although it\nhad been less than two minutes, really--did he turn back to the rest\nof the family. He had been somewhat surprised that his father had not\ncome to help him; he had not been at all surprised that his brother had\nnot. Jak was a grand guy--Jon thought the world of him--but he just\nwasn't worth a dead salmon in an emergency like this; he did not have a\nmechanical type of mind.\n\nNow, as he turned, Jon saw his mother and brother kneeling beside the\nprone body of his father, and noted with astonishment that she was\ncrying. There was something stiff and unnatural about the man's body,\ntoo, lying there on the deck beside his recline seat.\n\nA sudden fear sent the boy leaping across the room. \"What ... what\nhappened? Pop isn't dead, is he?\"\n\n\"No. Something made him fall, and he hit his head on the deck and\nknocked himself out,\" Jak said without looking up. \"His foot caught in\nthe footrest, and as he fell over the seat arm his leg broke.\"\n\nJon dropped to his knees beside his weeping mother and threw an arm\nabout her. His eyes were wide and damp with swift tears, for, in spite\nof the rapid growth his body had undergone in the past few years, he\nwas still only sixteen--and he loved this splendid father of his with\ngenuine devotion.\n\nIt just couldn't be that Pop wouldn't live, he thought in panic.\nHe couldn't make himself believe that he might no longer have the\nwonderful companionship and guidance and counsel of this grand man who\nhad been his world.\n\nHis mother, seeming to realize what the boy was undergoing, forced\nback her own grief to turn and gather this younger son into her arms,\ncomforting him as only mothers can.\n\nThey watched the elder brother's swift, competent hands as he bathed\nwith soft cotton, soaked in some kind of medicine taken from the open\nfirst-aid kit beside him, the bruised place on the back of the father's\nhead. Jak had already shaved away the hair about this bruise. Now he\ntook an atomizer and sprayed on a clear, plastic bandage.\n\nMrs. Carver turned anxiously to her younger son. \"Jon, you know how to\nrun the ship. Turn it around and get us back to the nearest hospital as\nfast as it will go.\"\n\nJon looked at her in astonishment, for it had never before occurred\nto him that she did not know at least something about inter-stellar\nastrogation. \"We can't, Mom. You don't run a ship in space like you do\na ground car. We're on negative acceleration now, but it'll be close to\ntwo days before we've slowed enough for any kind of maneuvering.\"\n\n\"That's right, Mother,\" Jak came unexpectedly to his brother's aid.\n\"You can't stop or turn a spaceship at will. But I don't think we\nneed worry too much. Father's head wound is not serious, although\nthere's a slight concussion. And we can set his leg so it will heal\nstraight--it's a clean break.\"\n\n\"Besides, it would take at least a month to get back to the nearest\ncolonized planet,\" Jon took up the explanation. \"You know we're almost\nsix weeks out of Terra.\"\n\nMrs. Carver still looked doubtful, but responded, as did Jon, when Jak\nbegan issuing instructions to them to help him in setting the broken\nleg. He had cut away the trousers and removed the boot and sock. Now he\nasked his mother to grasp his father's shoulders and hold tightly. He\nthen showed Jon how to hold the toes and heel of the injured leg, and\npull steadily downward while he manipulated the bone ends into place.\n\nWhen the break had been adjusted, Jak dissolved certain plastics into\na heavy, viscous liquid which he sprayed onto the leg. This mixture\nhardened almost instantly, forming a cast that was far stiffer and\nyet less weighty than either the ancient plaster casts or cumbersome\nsplints.\n\nWhen it was finished, they all rose, and while their mother hurried\nahead to prepare the bunk, the boys stooped and lifted their father's\ninert body. Staggering a bit under the load, yet handling him tenderly,\nthey carried him to his wall bunk and lowered him onto the sheeted\nmattress. After their mother had tucked in the top sheet and blankets,\nthe boys buckled the acceleration straps about the bunk, and Jak made\nan extra binder with a folded blanket about the broken leg. Now, if\ntheir father regained consciousness, or moved about restlessly in\npartial awakening, he could not fall out and perhaps hurt himself more.\n\nWhen all had been done to make the wounded man as comfortable as\npossible, Mrs. Carver turned to Jon questioningly.\n\n\"What happened, Son? Do you know?\"\n\n\"Meteoroid broached the hull, then must have gone on and almost hit\nPop. If it was a close miss, the force of its passage must have made\nhim duck and fall.\"\n\n\"But I don't feel any air escaping.\"\n\n\"There isn't now. I patched the hole, inside. Temporary job, though.\nPop'll--\" He stopped in sudden realization, then straightened\nresolutely and his voice was calmer, more sure, as he went on. \"I mean,\n_I_'ll have to go outside and make a permanent weld. Might as well do\nit now.\"\n\nHis mother's face showed the pride she felt in this young son who could\nplan and do the things that had to be done, even while she knew he was\nupset by his father's accident.\n\n\"Yes, it should be done at once.\" But she gripped his arm\nconvulsively. \"Be sure your lifeline is fastened securely, Jon.\"\n\nHe patted her hand awkwardly. \"I will, Mom. I've been outside a lot,\nyou know, and understand just what to do.\"\n\nHe broke away and ran toward the airlock. From the closet just inside\nthe inner lockdoor he took his spacesuit, and put it on as quickly as\nhe could. He was still working on the zippered seam down the front,\nsmearing on the quickly-drying plastic that made it doubly airtight,\nwhen his brother came in.\n\n\"Can I help, Chubby?\"\n\n\"Sure, give me a hand with my helmet. Say, Owl, will Pop really be all\nOK?\"\n\n\"I ... I think so. He got a bad smack when he fell. But his heart seems\nto be beating strongly, and I think the concussion'll wear off soon.\nThe leg'll heal, but he'll be out of commission about six weeks.\"\n\nHe picked up the quartzite \"fishbowl\" and slipped it over Jon's head.\nThey settled it firmly in place on the suit-ring, and screwed tight the\nlugs that held it in place. As Jon turned on his oxygen he motioned to\nthe plastic, and Jak smeared it carefully all around the seam.\n\nWhen he had finished, Jon increased the oxygen flow until the suit\nbulged, while Jak minutely inspected every point for any possible\nleakage. Finding none, he made the OK sign with thumb and bent\nforefinger, and Jon reduced his air-flow and opened the escape valve\nuntil the suit deflated enough so he could move about easily.\n\nFrom a chest of repair supplies the younger boy took a can of\nmetal-seal and a self-contained acetylene torch. These he fastened to\nhis belt while Jak was getting, from a wall hook, a coil of thin but\nterrifically strong, light, plastic rope that would neither freeze nor\nlose its pliability in the utter cold of space. While spacesuits had\nmagnetic shoe soles to keep their wearers in contact with the hull,\na lifeline was a safety factor in case they happened to break that\ncontact and drift away from the ship.\n\nJon checked his suit and equipment again, making sure he had all the\ntools he might need, and that they were firmly in place. He snapped one\nend of his lifeline into a ring at his belt, tugging strongly on it\nseveral times.\n\nThen he turned and grinned through the helmet at his elder brother.\nHe waved him away from the inner lockdoor, then pressed a button. The\ninner door swung open and air rushed in to fill the vacuum between the\ninner and outer lockdoors.\n\nJon stepped into the narrow space, skirted the handling mechanism\nthere, then pressed another button to actuate the motor that closed\nand locked the inner door. When the red signal light told him it was\nairtight, he switched on the pump that returned the air to the body of\nthe ship. The lock empty, he twisted the knob that opened the outer\nlockdoor, then snapped the other end of his lifeline to a ring just\nbeside the opening doorway. He switched on his suit-heater as he felt\nthe chill of space.\n\nSlowly, ponderously, the mechanism swung the great eighteen-inch-thick\nouter door partially open, and Jon was facing deep space. Although he\nhad spent nearly a third of his life out here, it was a sight that\nnever tired the boy's active, imaginative mind, and even now he stood\nfor a long minute, eagerly looking outward.\n\nThe awesome blackness of the void seemed alive with millions upon\ncountless millions of tiny, distant, pinpointed lights he knew were\ngiant suns. On and on they stretched, as far as the eye could see--and\nbeyond. In the far, far distance were blotches of light Jon knew were\nthe incredibly distant nebulae--other uncounted billions of suns that\nmade up the far-off galaxies and universes.\n\nHe looked overhead, picking out against the backdrop of the nearer suns\nof our own galaxy--the Milky Way--some of the larger giant suns ...\nCanopus, Rigel, Deneb, Betelgeuse, Antares and others he knew by sight.\nThe patterns familiar on Terra were somewhat distorted here because of\nthe difference in distance and his line of sight, but those suns could\nnot be mistaken.\n\nHe only stood there for a moment, then he reached out carefully and\ngrasped the rung of the metal ladder welded onto the hull, and which\nran completely around the ship. He pulled himself onto this, and held\nthere while he estimated where that hole should be.\n\n\"About twenty-four feet to the left, and one or two lower than the\ndoortop, I think,\" he muttered to himself. He climbed several rungs,\nthen half-straightened and set first one foot and then the other firmly\nand flatly onto the hull beside the ladder rungs. He tried each of his\nshoes, making sure their magnetic soles were gripping tightly against\nthe hull surface. Then he let loose the ladder and stood upright.\nCompared to the decks inside, he was at right angles, but there is no\nup, down or sideways in space--except that your feet always seem \"down.\"\n\nAssured that his shoes were holding firmly, he slid first one foot and\nthen the other along the hull. In this way he walked ahead, always in\nfull contact, yet able to progress almost at a normal pace. He counted\nhis steps, and when he felt he was near the hole for which he was\nlooking, stooped and began searching about the surface more minutely.\n\nHis estimate had been close, and it took him only a moment to find the\nplace where the meteoroid had struck. He drew his lifeline taut and\ntied the loop to his belt, leaving the end of the line still snapped\nin place. Now, even though his knot might come loose, he was still\nfastened to the ship.\n\nHe took the can of metal-seal from his belt pouch, fumbling a bit\nbecause it was difficult working with such heavy gloves as those\nattached to his spacesuit. There was plenty of light from the billions\nof stars, nor did it matter what hour the ship's chronoms might\nindicate inside, it was always the same out here.\n\nHe squatted down, still keeping both feet flat against the outer skin\nof the ship. Carefully he poured some of the sluggish, viscous liquid\nmetal into the funnel-shaped hole, which was over an inch wide at the\nhull surface. Then he unslung his torch. He snapped the lighter and\nadjusted the flame to a narrow, pencil beam.\n\nWith the beam he melted the metal-seal he had poured into the hole.\nIn the cold depths of space, where the temperature was about absolute\nzero, the metal cooled almost instantly as he turned his torch away.\nHe then added more seal, melted that, then more seal, and so on, a bit\nat a time, until the hole was completely filled, and the hull surface\nonce again smooth and even.\n\nSatisfied at last that the damage to the ship was completely repaired,\nhe hooked his torch to his belt once more, recapped the can of\nremaining metal-seal and stored it in his belt pouch. He rose and stood\nagain for a few short moments, looking at the glory of the universe as\nit can only be seen from a spaceship. Then he made his way back to the\nlock and entered the ship.\n\nHe touched the stud and the motor slowly closed the great outer door.\nWhen the red signal light showed it was airtight, he punched the other\nbutton, air filled the entry, and then the inner door opened. He went\nthrough into the ship, closed the inner door, and when that was tight,\nstarted the motor that pumped the precious air from the lock back into\nthe ship.\n\nHis brother had not stayed around to help him, so Jon had to strip the\nplastic from his zipper and around the base of his helmet by himself.\nIt was an awkward job, as was trying to unscrew the lugs at the back of\nhis shoulders, and he growled a bit beneath his breath because Jak had\nnot waited, nor come back to help him.\n\nBut his irritation quickly passed and he grinned to himself. He knew\nhis brother so well--Jak simply had not thought to stay and help, or he\nwould willingly have done so.\n\nJak's tastes and desires ran more to other things, Jon knew. To\nmedicine, and to all growing things, whether plant, animal or human.\nJak had always been far more interested in what made _life_ grow and\nperform its miracles, than he had in how and why _machines_ operated.\n\nAnd, Jon acknowledged honestly, it was a good thing for them all in\nthis present emergency. If good old Jak wasn't half a doctor already,\nPop would really be in a bad way ... and so would all of them, if\nthey lost that steady and competent prop on whom they all leaned so\nconfidently.\n\n\"I sure wouldn't have known what to do,\" Jon admitted to himself, as\nthe thought of his father made him hurry the removing of his suit. \"I\nprobably would have run for my tool kit, not the first-aid one.\"\n\nHe finally got the suit off and hung it back in the closet. He gathered\nup the scraps of used plastic and stuffed them into the near-by trash\ndisposal chute. Then he ran into the living room and on to the side of\nhis father's bunk, where his mother and brother were standing, watching.\n\n\"How is he?\"\n\n\"Just the same.\"\n\n\"You're sure he ... he isn't...?\"\n\n\"No, he's still alive, and I'm sure he'll pull out in time. Only\nquestion is, how long it'll take?\"\n\nJon's mind began churning with problems. What would they do while Pop\nwas \"out\"? Who was to run the ship; make the calculations on orbits and\ntrajectories? Who's to handle the controls of landing when we reach our\ndestination, which won't be very long now? Who'll do the thousand and\none things Pop has always done? Who'll make the decisions?\n\nAgain the sense and knowledge of his personal loss came home--and young\nJon Carver sank onto the deck of the bunkroom. Again he was just a boy\nwho had lost his dearest pal, his ideal. Pop just couldn't die! Who'd\nhelp him with his problems; teach him the many things he was always\nwanting to know?\n\nIt just couldn't be that there would be no more of those tussles of\nfriendly play; those boxing matches or wrestling bouts by which his\ngrowing body adjusted to swift action and hard knocks. He could not\nmake himself believe that there would be no more of those hours of\npractical instruction, or the long, pleasant evenings when the big man\nwould talk of the places where he had been, the things he had seen and\ndone in his travels about the galaxy.\n\nFor Tad Carver was one of the real pioneers of deep space. He had been\nan officer of the first ship to reach the stars--the planets of Sirius.\n\nDeep-space travel was not yet a commonplace thing, although it was\nbecoming so more swiftly with each passing year. Jon knew that there\nwere now regular trips to the planets and some of the moons of his home\nsolar system. One could have a two weeks' vacation trip from Terra to\nLuna for a thousand credits, or a month's cruise to Mars or Venus for\nforty hundred.\n\nMerchant ships made fairly regular voyages to the planets of Sirius\nand Vega and, less often, to one or two other even more distant worlds\nwhich had been found to contain friendly and civilized beings--not all\nof them humanoid--who were glad to engage in inter-stellar commerce.\nOther spaceships plied between Terra and the many newly discovered\nworlds that were being colonized by Earth people.\n\nBut it had been men like Tad Carver who, co-operatively, had bought\nships and surveyed the spaceways. It was they who had opened up those\nparts of the galaxy so far charted and who, incidentally, had made\nfortunes for themselves from the metals, strange jewels and other rare\nobjects they had discovered and brought back, and for which the rich of\nTerra had paid so willingly and so handsomely.\n\nThat was why, after a number of years and many such trips, Carver had\nbeen able to buy his own small ship, outfit it for deep space travel,\nand take his family with him on his further voyages of exploration and\nsurvey. They were now en route to a new portion of the galaxy, one\nnever--so far as they knew--visited by human beings.\n\n\"But what'll we do without Pop?\" Jon's mind went back to his problem.\n\"Who would be in command of their ship now? Mom didn't know a thing\nabout the navigation of space. Look how she'd demanded he turn around\n'right now'!\" She was wonderful, and Jon loved her dearly. But he\nalso knew she would be absolutely out of place trying to make their\ndecisions about where to go, how to get there, how to run the ship, and\nso on. She had always seemed content to \"keep house\" on the ship, just\nas she had on Terra, and paid but little attention to what else was\ngoing on.\n\nAnd Jak was just about as bad. The older boy was quick-and-logical\nthinking, and knew a lot--but not about such things. Jon had been\nthe one who was always tagging their father around, forever asking\nquestions about how to do this, why was that done, what did this\nmachine do and what was the theory behind it, and so on? He had always\nbeen working with machines, almost since he could toddle. He took\nthem apart, not destructively but questioningly, and was very soon\nable to put back together again correctly an endless succession of\never-more-complicated mechanisms.\n\nRecently he had begun the study of astrogation--he had also long been a\n\"math shark\"--and now knew enough to realize how little he really did\nknow about this complicated subject--although actually it was a great\ndeal.\n\nSobered, and suddenly aware of a growing maturity brought on by the\nterrific problems they faced, Jon sat up. He rose and went over to his\nmother's side. He touched her softly on the shoulder, and she looked up\nat him. At sight of his anxious face she threw her arms about him.\n\n\"Jon, boy, what will we do now? How will we ever manage without Mr. C?\"\n\nAt this echo of his own questionings and doubts, the boy straightened.\n\"We'll make out all right, Mom,\" he said with a bravado he certainly\ndid not feel, but which he hoped she would think was genuine. \"We'll\nhave to make up our minds what we're going to do, then do it. We'll\nkeep on with Pop's plans, of course.\" This was a statement rather than\na question.\n\n\"Why ... why....\" She seemed startled by the realization that she had\nto make a decision. \"I hadn't thought about that yet.\" She was silent\na moment, then turned to her elder son, who had also risen and was\nlistening intently. \"What do you think, Jak? You're older, so you'll\nhave to take charge now and be the man of the family.\"\n\nThe slender, studious eighteen-year-old looked startled. \"I ... I don't\nknow,\" he stammered, his eyes suddenly filled with strange fears.\n\"I ... I suppose we might as well go home. We don't know where we're\ngoing, or what we were to do when we got there....\" He suddenly looked\nlike a little boy who has lost everything and everyone in whom he had\nlooked for and found comfort and security. \"Don't ask me, Mother. I\ndon't know what we're going to do. We're apt to die, without Father to\nkeep us going safely!\"\n\nJon stared at him, this brother he had always loved and to whom he had\nlooked up as a strong, elder companion ... in spite of their almost\ncontinuous, although friendly, bickerings, which never disturbed the\nwarm affection underneath.\n\nNow he just couldn't believe his eyes and ears. This couldn't be\nJak--the strong, reliable Jak!\n\nSuddenly he felt a surge of anger and distrust. Yet immediately he\nwas ashamed of himself for such feelings. This wasn't any minnow of\na predicament they were in--it was a very whale of a mess. He was\nscared, himself, and could understand just how Jak must feel. But, by\nthe great horned catfish, he wasn't going to let himself cry about it\nany more--especially in front of Mom! Something had to be done, and it\nwould be done!\n\nA thought flashed through his mind, and he straightened with resolve.\n\"_Shut up!_\" he yelled at his brother ... and when Jak and their\nmother stared at him in amazement Jon grinned calmly and said, half\napologetically, \"Just trying to snap you out of the dumps. I say we've\ngot to think this out carefully, and not make any snap decisions--or\ngive up like this. The ship's on automatic drive and decelerating, so\nwe don't have to worry about running it for some time. But Pop wouldn't\nlike it if we didn't keep on. You know how important this trip is to\nhim. Besides, he'll be waking up soon, and even if he has to stay in\nhis bunk, he can tell us what to do.\"\n\n\"Do you know where we're going, and why?\" Jak was still upset.\n\n\"Sure. Pop talked with me a lot about it.\"\n\nTheir mother looked from one to the other doubtfully, then smiled in\na constrained manner. \"You ... you're probably right, Jon. Mr. C. did\nsay this would make or break us. I leave it up to my two big boys to\ndiscuss and suggest plans until your father is able to take charge\nagain.\"\n\nWith an effort she pulled herself together, and now her smile was\nfirmer, brighter. \"Meanwhile, I think we'd better have something to\neat. We have to keep up our strength for whatever is coming, you know.\"\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWhen the boys woke up the next morning, their mother reported that\ntheir father had apparently had a restful night, coming out of his coma\nbriefly a couple of times.\n\nAfter breakfast the two boys went into the control room and began\nexamining the various instruments and recorders on the panel, to see if\nthey could figure out how much longer it would take them to reach the\nsystem their father was seeking. Through the visiplates they could now\nsee not only the sun toward which Jon said they were heading, but even\nits nearer planets were beginning to show appreciable discs.\n\nAs they were studying these, Jak suddenly asked, \"How do you suppose we\nhappened to run into a meteor way out here in space like that?\"\n\nJon shook his head helplessly. \"Darned if I can figure it out. I always\nsupposed such stuff was only found inside a planetary system. Must be\nthere's some in deep space, though, since we sure as perch got hit by\none.\" He reached in his pocket and pulled out a small marble-sized\nstone. \"Here it is. I hunted around and found it last night. It dented\nthe farther bulkhead, but must have lost so much momentum it couldn't\npenetrate.\"\n\n\"Just one of those billions-to-one chances, eh?\" Jak looked up from his\nexamination of the stone.\n\n\"Yes, there's still so much about space nobody knows yet.\"\n\nJak thought silently for a moment, then asked, \"Well, what do you think\nwe should do next?\"\n\n\"Keep going, natch.\" Jon's voice was earnest. \"We can't be more than a\ncouple of days away from the nearest planets--and we're over six weeks\nout of Terra. Pop said this system we're heading for has four or five\nplanets, at least, and that probably Two and Three, and maybe Four,\nwould be fairly Earthlike and habitable. So long as we're so close, it\nwould be wrong if we didn't at least take a close-up looksee at them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" slowly, \"Father'd want us to do that.\"\n\n\"You know darned well he would. He's sunk almost everything he's got\ninto this ship and this trip, and if we miss now, the government\nprobably wouldn't give us another exclusive crack at it, even if we\ncould scrape up the credits to come out here again.\"\n\n\"Didn't Father say something the other day about his\nspectro-analyzer--you know, 'Annie'--showing there was...?\"\n\n\"Yes, 'Annie' popped up strong on that, and that's another reason we've\ngot to keep going--especially since you think Pop'll snap out of it in\na few days. You're sure of that, aren't you?\" He peered intently into\nhis brother's eyes.\n\n\"Yes, as far as I can tell. There's a concussion where his head hit the\nfloor, but I don't think it's too bad, and it should wear off soon.\"\n\nJon sighed with relief. \"If ... if he was dead, or dying, it would be\ndifferent, and I'd say go home. But there's another thing. Before we\nleft Terra we heard a rumor Slik Bogin was chasing around out in this\nsector, and we don't want to let him beat us to this system.\"\n\n\"Bogin? That's the notorious pirate, isn't it? No, if he's out here, we\ndon't want to let him beat us--though what we could do if he did try, I\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"We'll figure that out if he tries to hijack us.\"\n\n\"You hope!\" There was a long silence while the boys studied their\ninstruments again. Then, \"What about landing, Chubby? Can you do it?\"\n\n\"I've been studying up on it--put on the sleep-instructor last night.\"\nJon was suddenly half-frightened with the prospect, but determined\nto keep his voice level. \"I've helped Pop land the crate several\ntimes--even handled the controls under his instructions--so I think I\ncan do it, with you reading off the manual to me. Anyway, if--if Pop\ngets worse, we've got to land some time, so we might as well try it\nhere as any time or anywhere.\"\n\nJak stood silent a long moment, rubbing his hand through his hair as\nhe did when concentrating. Then he looked up with determination. \"Jon,\nyou and I have got ourselves a job to do.\" And now his voice was steady\nand earnest. \"It's up to us to take care of Mother and keep her from\nworrying. So, whenever we're where she can hear us, we've got to act\nbrave and sure of ourselves, no matter how we feel inside.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's all broken up about Pop. We ought to do most of the work,\ntoo, so she....\"\n\n\"No,\" Jak shook his head, \"that'd be the worst thing we could do. She\nisn't sick, physically, and if she keeps busy, she won't have time to\nworry so much. So we must keep her from having too much idle time.\"\n\n\"Oh ... maybe you're right, Owl ... yes, guess you are, at that--that's\nmore your dish. But we can act like everything's going to jet fair.\nIt's a deal.\" He held out his hand, and the two brothers clasped in\nagreement.\n\nThey went into the living quarters. \"Hi, Mom, lunch ready yet? I'm\nstarved.\"\n\n\"As usual,\" Jak bantered.\n\nMrs. Carver looked up apathetically from the recline seat where she had\nbeen sitting, worrying, during the several hours the boys had been in\nthe control room. She looked as though she were almost shocked at their\nseemingly heartless question, forgetting that she, herself, had used\nthe same excuse the night before.\n\nBut in a moment she smiled tremulously. \"I guess I let myself forget\nmy job, and that we have to go through the motions of living.\" She\nrose slowly, and the boys came and put their arms about her. \"Mr. C.\nwouldn't want me to break down like this. I'll try to do better.\"\n\nShe gave her sons a quick hug and went into the little galley, where\nthey heard her moving about from the deep-freeze to cupboards to\ninduction-cooker. Soon the smells of appetizing food spread throughout\nthe ship.\n\nJon had gone back into the control room and picked up the reelbook on\nastrogation, opening it to the chart of the pilot panel. He was still\nstudying this and tracing, from the diagrams in the book, the controls,\nswitches and recorders on the panel itself. He memorized each one as he\nwent along, and made sure he knew its functions.\n\nWhen Jak called him to lunch, Jon carried the reel with him and\ncontinued studying it as he absentmindedly ate. His preoccupation with\nit raised his mother's fears again. \"Can you make anything out of it,\nSon?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" He roused himself then, and grinned at her. \"Sure, Mom, it's\neasy. Pop taught me most of it already, and I'm just refreshing my\nmind. I'll set us down in one piece, don't you fear.\"\n\n\"How soon will we arrive?\"\n\n\"About tomorrow noon, I think, by our clocks. No telling what time\nit'll be there. I'll take measurements again and make sure, right after\nI'm through eating. We must be about ready to step up our deceleration.\"\n\nHe looked at his mother more intently, and his voice was so earnest\nit broke from baritone to a childish treble in places. \"Mom, I'm not\nquestioning your authority or anything, but you said yesterday that Jak\nwas to be in charge until Pop wakes up. Now, Jak doesn't know anything\nat all about astrogation, and while I don't know it all, I do know more\nthan he does, and I'll have to handle it. So what about me being in\ncharge of the ship when we're in flight or on landings and take-offs,\nand Jak in charge other times? Though whatever you say goes, of\ncourse,\" he added hastily.\n\nSomewhat to his surprise, his brother sided with him. The elder seemed\nto realize this was no time for one of their friendly squabbles about\nwhich was to be \"top man\"; that their very safety depended on the fact\nthat whichever knew the most about any one thing should be the one to\nhave the say about it.\n\nTheir mother looked from one to the other helplessly. \"I ... I guess\nthat will be all right. You two figure out things between you. You're\nall the men I have now until your father....\" She almost broke into\ntears then, but pulled herself together. \"Yes, you do whatever you\nthink is best about such things.\"\n\n\"We'll handle it,\" Jak assured her. \"But you'll still be boss in chief.\"\n\n\"You say 'when' and 'what,' and Jak and I'll figure out 'how.'\" Jon\ngrinned.\n\nShe stretched out her arms and grasped each by a hand. \"My big boys!\nI'm sure we'll come through safely. You're getting to be real men.\"\nThen she changed her tone and asked, \"You're going to land on one of\nthose planets, then, as Mr. C. planned?\"\n\n\"Being so close, it seems best,\" Jak answered. \"How long we stay will\ndepend on what we do or don't find there.\"\n\n\"Yes, we need a few days' rest on firm ground before we start back to\nTerra, at least. We want to freshen our air, if we can, and maybe get\nsome fresh food. Besides, we ought to try to get all the necessary data\nto prove Pop's discovery, if the planets are uninhabited but worth\ncolonizing.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" seconded Jak, \"even if we have to land in some secluded spot\nand just rest.\"\n\n\"I'll leave it up to you, then.\" Their mother appeared more like her\nusual happy self than the boys had seen her since the accident. \"I'll\nkeep house like I always have, and you boys do whatever else you think\nbest.\"\n\nJak laughed. \"We'll be like those Musketeers in that old book I read\nsome time ago. 'All for one and one for all.'\" He held out his hand\ndramatically. \"Put your hands on mine, and we'll all swear to it.\"\n\nLaughing, they did as he suggested, although their mother pretended\nseverity. \"You know I don't like swearing, Boys.\"\n\nJak grinned. \"But I meant this in the sense of 'taking an oath,' not of\n'cussing.'\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she krinkled her nose at him, grinning with her old-time\nimpishness, \"that's different.\"\n\nJon rose from the table. \"I'll get back to my studying.\"\n\n\"You listen to your mother, and don't study too hard,\" she warned,\nknowing how he was apt to \"lose himself\" in his books. \"You need plenty\nof rest for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"All right, Mom.\"\n\nBut when she went into the control room long after dinner, he was still\ndeep in his reelbook. She took it away from him. \"Get to bed, Jon. You\npromised.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mom. Just got so interested I forgot time.\" He kissed her.\n\"'Night, Mom. And don't worry. We'll make out swell.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it.\" Her words were brave but he could see the tears were\nperilously close.\n\n\"You'd better ask Jak for some barbit, or you won't sleep any better\nthan you did last night,\" he counseled. \"Remember, he and I are going\nto take turns watching Pop.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Son. Good night.\"\n\nHe touched a switch and the glolights dimmed and went dark as he\nfollowed her out.\n\nAll the next morning Mrs. Carver and her two sons were in the control\nroom--except for their frequent trips to Mr. Carver's bunk, to see\nhow their patient was getting along. They were studying through the\ntelescopic visiplates the solar system they were rapidly approaching.\nJon had figured the sun was a Type G Dwarf, much like Sol, but a little\nlarger. It had, they now knew, only five planets. Three of these--Two,\nThree and Four--had seven satellites among them. From their distances\nfrom the sun, the boys figured that probably Two and Three would have\nclimates that human colonists, with some adaptation, could stand.\n\nNow they were peering even more closely into their plates, as their\nship circled the globe beneath them. Jon had maneuvered it into a\nspiral course about Planet Two, in such a manner that, from a height of\nabout a hundred miles, they could get a good view of the world beneath\nthem, in their telescopic plates.\n\n\"Lots of plant life, but I haven't seen anything that looks like\ncities,\" Jak said at last.\n\n\"Nor I,\" from their mother and, \"Me neither,\" Jon added.\n\nTheir first measurements of this new planet had shown it to be almost\nthe size of Terra, and they had been delighted to see that there was a\nmoon of considerable size, although not as large as Luna. It was about\none hundred and fifty thousand miles out.\n\n\"There's a number of large seas or oceans,\" Jak commented without\ntaking his eyes from his visiplate. \"Look at that plant life,\nthough--it evidently coats the whole planet. From here it looks like\njungle.\"\n\n\"Lots of lakes and rivers on it, and in those plains we saw.\" Jon was\nexcited. \"It sure looks like a wonderful world where men can live.\"\n\nAs they crisscrossed the planet from pole to pole, they saw small ice\nfields about each.\n\n\"That means there'll be varied seasons here,\" Jon stated.\n\n\"Not necessarily,\" Jak argued. \"In fact, while possible, it's not even\nprobable.\"\n\n\"Says you,\" Jon sniffed. Then later, \"I figure the year here at about\nthree hundred days. Just an approximation, of course, but probably\nwithin five per cent. I'm not too good at such things.\"\n\n\"You're probably wrong,\" Jak snorted, and their mother interrupted\nwhat she thought was the beginning of another of their interminable\narguments.\n\n\"Are you going to land here, or go on to another planet first?\" she\nasked Jon.\n\n\"I'm going low enough to test atmosphere and temperature before I\ndecide,\" he told her.\n\n\"Well,\" resignedly, \"do as you boys think best.\"\n\nJon manipulated his controls and as the ship tilted slightly, they\ncould see in their plates the ground coming closer. Slowly, under the\nincreased reaction of the powerful bow tubes, the ship slowed until it\nwas cruising at about one thousand miles an hour and about a mile above\nthe surface--or the tops of the vegetation, at least. Then Jon leveled\nit off.\n\n\"You know how to test atmosphere, Jak?\" he asked. \"The temp now is\nabout 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit, so it probably isn't over 110 at ground\nlevel.\"\n\n\"Yes, Father taught me that.\" Jak moved over to the hull wall where\nthere was an atmosphere-trap and the mechanism that tested and recorded\nthe contents of any air they might encounter on a new planet. He worked\nthis and studied the results.\n\nThis latest invention of Terran aeroscopic technies was simple to\noperate. A chart, already prepared to show the constituents of Earth's\natmospheric limits compatible to human needs, was placed beneath a\nstylus. The latter drew a curve showing the components of the new air,\nand if the lines did not go above or below the red one on the prepared\nchart, the atmosphere was safe for human consumption.\n\n\"Carbon dioxide a little higher, and when I tested density with a\nspring balance the ten-pound weight showed nine and a half,\" Jak\nreported. \"That means we'll feel a trifle lighter, and won't find\nwalking and lifting as hard.\"\n\nTheir mother had been hovering nervously in the background. Now she\nstepped up and asked, \"Are you sure it is safe here?\"\n\n\"We will be before we go outside, Mother,\" Jak assured her, then turned\nto Jon. \"Where are you going to land?\"\n\n\"Soon as I find a good spot. Keep your eyes peeled for a large\nclearing.\"\n\nBut they had gone only a few more miles when Jak yelled, \"There, Jon!\nOff to the left a mile or so.\"\n\nAt his first words Jon had increased the negative acceleration. His\ndarting eyes spotted the clearing, and he put the ship into a circle\nand elevated the nose so they climbed to a height of some twenty miles.\n\n\"Grab that astrogation book and get ready to read me the checks, Owl.\nMom, you strap in. Is Pop all right?\"\n\nMrs. Carver assured him that on her recent trip to her husband's bunk\nshe had seen to it that he was safely fastened down, in anticipation of\ntheir landing.\n\nJak picked up the book and opened it to the book-marked page. He sank\ninto the co-pilot's seat, and fastened the safety belt. \"Ready when you\nare.\"\n\nTheir mother now reported, \"All fast, Jon.\"\n\nA moment while the younger boy glanced quickly at his various dials,\nthen he said tensely, \"Shoot.\"\n\n\"Check decelerometer.\"\n\n\"On the hairline.\"\n\n\"Check outside air pressure.\"\n\n\"Seven four two.\"\n\n\"Terrain indicator.\"\n\n\"Level.\"\n\n\"Altimeter.\"\n\n\"Four thousand three hundred. Going down a hundred per second.\"\n\n\"Let her down.\"\n\nAnxious seconds of jockeying, Jon's eyes flashing from indicator to\ngauge to telltale to screen, his hands and feet moving here and there\non the controls.\n\nThe two others gasped as they saw the ground rushing toward them so\nswiftly. The ship landed--but with a jar that shook them all.\n\n\"Off bow retarders,\" Jak yelled.\n\nThe roar of the tubes ceased and they were almost stunned by the sudden\nsilence.\n\n\"Down landing props.\"\n\nThe grind of a motor, then a gentle jar and the ship seemed to\nstraighten a bit.\n\n\"Props down.\"\n\n\"Close fuel petcocks.\"\n\n\"Closed.\"\n\n\"Shut off fuel pump.\"\n\n\"Shut.\"\n\n\"All controls in neutral.\"\n\nJon's hands flashed over several levers, knobs and switches.\n\n\"Everything neutral.\" He turned in his seat then, and his face wore a\nwide grin of triumph. \"We did it. We're down.\"\n\nHe noticed his mother's white, strained face, and called to her,\n\"Relax, Mom. I set you down in one piece, just as I said I would.\"\n\nJak broke in with a scoffing comment--although his eyes showed the\nsecret pride he felt in his younger brother's ability--\"Lousy landing.\nWhat's the big idea, jolting us all like that? Want to bust up the\nship?\"\n\n\"Now, Boys,\" their mother hastened to break up this incipient quarrel\nbefore it had the chance to get started--which was exactly what Jak\nintended--\"I think Jon did exceptionally well, considering it was his\nfirst solo landing. I'm not hurt at all, and I'm sure the ship isn't,\neither.\"\n\nJak pretended to look ashamed, although neither of the boys could\ncompletely hide their grins, and had to face away from her. \"Yes, I was\njust steaming off. It was really a swell job, Chubby.\"\n\nBut Jon had already pushed out of his seat and was at one of the\nwindow-ports, peering eagerly outside. However, he did fling back over\nhis shoulder, \"You helped a lot, Owl. Couldn't have done it without\nyou.\"\n\nThe other two came up quickly to stand beside him, staring at this\nstrange, new world. The clearing in which the ship rested, they could\nsee now, was about a hundred acres in extent. Near the ship the strange\ngrass with which the clearing was carpeted was seared and black from\ntheir landing blasts, and burning in places. But toward the huge trees\nthat walled the clearing, the grass was in its natural green state,\ncovered with tiny, whitish blossoms.\n\nThe trees visible from the ship were mostly very tall, averaging well\nover three hundred feet, the Carvers estimated. They looked somewhat\nlike Douglas firs, but with a difference the Terrans could not at the\nmoment figure out.\n\nThe three could see no animal or bird life, but guessed this did not\nmean there was none. The jungle might be teeming with life, but it\nwould probably have been frightened away for the time being by this\nstrange, fire-breathing monster that had descended from the skies to\nland on their world.\n\n\"Think it's safe to go out?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"Now you listen to your mother, and don't take any chances.\"\n\n\"We won't,\" Jon told her, then answered his brother. \"We'll wait an\nhour and see what we can see from here, then decide.\"\n\n\"I sure want a closer look at that plant Life.\" Jak's eyes glistened,\nand he ran to get his binoculars to see better.\n\n\"I ought to examine the hull and tubes, too, to make sure they aren't\nfouled or corroded,\" Jon told his mother.\n\n\"It's nearly time for lunch.\" She turned away. \"At least you must stay\nin until after that.\" It was plain she was still worried, and the boys\ntried to reassure her and quiet her fears.\n\nWhen she called they reluctantly left their vantage points at the ports\nand went in to eat the lunch she had prepared. Several times she had to\ncaution them against bolting their food, as they talked eagerly of what\nthey might find here.\n\nFinally finished, Jon rose. \"Come on, Owl,\" he urged, \"let's go outside\nand give it the once-over lightly.\"\n\n\"Better break out our rifles first,\" the elder advised. \"No telling\nwhat we'll run into.\"\n\n\"If it's dangerous enough for guns, I wish you wouldn't go.\" Their\nmother was worried again.\n\n\"They're just a precaution, same as Father would take if he was in\ncharge,\" Jak soothed. \"We won't go out of this clearing this first\ntime.\"\n\n\"You'd better give Mr. C. another feeding first, hadn't you?\"\n\nJak consulted his wrist-chronom. \"Yes, it's nearly time, and we might\nnot be back by the regular hour.\"\n\nThe problem of keeping their father fed and in good health, apart from\nhis head and leg injuries, had not proven too hard when they became\nconvinced that he was not going to wake up often enough to eat normally.\n\nJak, while working as orderly in the Centropolitan Hospital the\nprevious summer, had assisted the interns and nurses in giving\nintravenous feedings to unconscious patients. So he knew the general\nprocedure, as well as the composition and quantity of the nutrient\nliquid to be administered.\n\n\"Will you come help me, Mother,\" he had asked when he was sure he was\nready for that first feeding. \"We've got to find certain things in our\nfood stores.\"\n\n\"You're sure you know how to do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's not hard. We need liquid proteins, salt, sugar and glucose.\"\nWith his mother helping, he had gathered these from their stores, and\ntaken them into the galley. There he had carefully measured out and\nmixed these ingredients in the proportions his books stated.\n\nThen he and Jon had gone into the workshop and there the younger,\nunder his brother's supervision, and with pictures of the apparatus as\na guide, had rigged up a drip-regulator to go into the mouth of a large\nbottle. To this they had attached a long, slender, plastic tube, and to\nthe far end of that a large, hollow feeding needle.\n\nAs the others watched anxiously, Jak had inserted the needle into the\nlarge vein on the inside of his father's left elbow. With his thumb Jak\nhad softly rubbed the vein just above the needle's point, to assist the\nflow of the nutrient. Soon it was done. Mr. Carver had stirred and his\neyelids had fluttered when the needle was inserted but he had not fully\nregained consciousness.\n\nThat first feeding so successfully accomplished, Mrs. Carver did\nnot seem to worry quite so much about her husband, although she was\ncareful to keep track of the feeding times, and to remind her sometimes\nforgetful son of his duty.\n\nThe feeding given this day, the boys consulted together.\n\n\"Shall we wear our spacesuits?\" Jon asked.\n\n\"I don't see why. It's hot outside, but bearable, and the air's all\nright,\" Jak answered positively. \"I not only tested it, but I breathed\nthe sample I took in through the trap. It smells good, and hasn't\nhurt me any. We'll take our guns, and I want my magnifying glass and\nknapsack for specimens.\"\n\n\"And I'll put some multiform tools in my belt. Then, in case there's\nanything that needs doing on the tubes or hull, I can do it quickly.\"\n\nThe two brothers assembled their gear and Jon was just reaching for\nthe button to open the inner door when they stopped short and shrank\nback.\n\nFor a terrific roar came from outside ... such a tremendous sound it\npenetrated even the hull of their ship!\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAt that horrid noise, the two boys stood frozen a moment, then with\none accord raced to the control room, where they peered out of the\nquartzite ports.\n\n\"Great whales, look at that thing!\" Jon shouted as they caught their\nfirst glimpse outside.\n\n\"Yeow!\" Jak yelled in amazement. \"What do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"Never saw anything like it before.\"\n\nThey stared in awe at the tremendous creature standing in the little\nclearing, looking belligerently toward their ship. It was so unlike any\nEarth beast it was no wonder the boys were startled. The huge body was\ncovered with heavily matted fur. It must have been at least a dozen\nfeet long, and stood about eight feet tall. But the striking thing was\nthat the body was triangular, and the beast was three-legged--two at\nthe back and one in front.\n\nThere was no tail, and the blocky legs--one at each corner of the\nweirdly triangular body--seemed to end in clawed feet. The head\nwas shaped something like that of a horse, but the huge mouth, now\npartly open, was seen to contain great fangs, larger than those of any\nbeast the boys had ever seen in Terran zoos or on any planet they had\nvisited. Two of the tusks were almost like the ones they had seen in\npictures of ancient saber-toothed tigers.\n\nThe whole getup gave such an effect of fierceness that both boys felt\na shiver run down their spines. Jak's voice was tremulous as he spoke.\n\"Yipe! I'm sure glad I'm not out there with that.\"\n\nJon was slow in answering. \"Yet, if we're going out at all....\" He\nhesitated, then continued, \"We'll either have to chase it away, or kill\nit.\"\n\n\"If we can,\" his brother retorted.\n\n\"I think our guns'll handle it,\" Jon said. \"The question is, how are we\ngoing to do it without exposing ourselves?\"\n\nJak thought swiftly. \"Maybe we could open the outer lock door a crack,\njust enough to see through and aim our guns.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess that's it.\"\n\n\"Don't say anything to Mother,\" Jak cautioned.\n\n\"Of course not, silly. Come on, let's see if we can kill it.\"\n\nThe two ran to the airlock and opened the inner door. Leaving it open,\nthey examined their guns to make sure they were fully loaded. Then\nJon punched the button to open the outer lockdoor. It was possible\nto do this while the inner one was still open, since there was now\nair outside to equalize the pressure. When the door had swung open a\ncouple of feet, Jon stopped the motor, and joined his brother, who was\npeering through the opening.\n\nThe huge creature was still facing them, about forty yards from the\nship. One of its rear feet was now pawing at the ground, tearing up\ngreat chunks of sod, while it roared its mighty challenge time and\nagain.\n\n\"I'll kneel and aim for the left eye. You stand over me and try to hit\nthe other.\" Jak took swift command. \"Then try for the brain or heart,\nand keep pumping while our ammo lasts or until we kill it.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Jon took his place and aimed his gun. \"Count three and we'll\nfire together.\"\n\nJak knelt and steadied his rifle with one elbow on his extended knee.\n\"One ... two ... three ... fire!\"\n\nAs the two shots crashed out the creature sprang into the air a couple\nof feet. A great scream of pain and rage shook the very ground and made\nthe air tremble. It hesitated only a moment, then charged toward the\nship at terrific speed.\n\nThe boys pumped shots as fast as they could. Both had hit the head,\nbut neither had put out an eye as they had hoped. They kept firing as\nfast as they could work their guns. Blood spouted from numerous wounds\non the beast. But still it came on madly, with swift though lumbering\nbounds.\n\n\"Back quick, and shut the door,\" Jak yelled as his hammer clicked on\nan empty gun. He pushed backward and scrambled to his feet as Jon\nleaped to the door controls. The heavy door swung shut ... and the boys\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\n\nBut almost at once their eyes filled with fear. They cringed back when\nthey felt the ship itself shudder as that heavy body struck against it.\n\nAs swiftly as their trembling legs would carry them, they raced back to\nthe control room. They reached it just in time to see the huge triped\nlunge against the side of the ship a second time ... and again held\ntheir breaths as it did so once more.\n\nThe beast's slow mind evidently realized, then, that it could not\nso easily overthrow this strange, great thing that had appeared so\nmysteriously in its jungle clearing. It backed away some little\ndistance, still roaring out in that horrible voice.\n\nOnce again the beast bunched its mighty muscles for another\nattack ... when it seemed to stop in the middle of a roar. It wobbled\na bit. Slowly its mighty legs buckled, and it sprawled on the ground.\nA few spasmodic shudders, a convulsive shiver that ran through the\ntremendous frame, then it was still.\n\nThe boys let out their breaths. They were just beginning to\ncongratulate themselves when the door of the control room opened and\ntheir mother's frightened face appeared.\n\n\"What was that, Boys? I was taking a nap, but your shooting woke\nme, than I felt the ship shake as though there was an earthquake or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"It was noth....\" Jon began, but Jak went up to her and put his arm\nabout her.\n\n\"It was just a big animal, Mother. Jon and I killed it.\"\n\n\"An animal? Big enough to jar the ship that way? Where is it?\" she\ngasped.\n\nJak pointed silently toward the port, and she hurried to look out. At\nsight of that huge mountain of flesh she cried out, and her face became\never more white and strained.\n\n\"What a horrible beast! Are you sure it's dead?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. It wasn't hard to kill.\" Jak minimized the danger and made\nhimself grin encouragingly. \"I'm going out and hack off some steaks.\nBet they'll be good, too.\"\n\n\"You'll do no such thing!\" she cried, shocked. \"Now you boys listen to\nyour mother. You're not to budge outside the ship. I want you to leave\nthis awful world at once.\"\n\nThe two boys looked at their mother, and suddenly they seemed to feel\nstrength and maturity growing within them. As though the act had been\ndiscussed and rehearsed, they both came up and, taking their mother\neach by an arm, led her out of the control room and back to their\nliving quarters. There they sat her down in her favorite recline seat.\n\n\"Look, Mother, you know how much we both love you and want to obey\nyou always,\" Jak said earnestly. \"But we're in a peculiar situation\nhere....\"\n\n\"On a strange planet, and Pop out of commission,\" Jon broke in.\n\n\"I know Jon and I are still boys,\" Jak continued, \"but we're all the\nmen here right now. We think you've got to begin trusting us to make\nthe decisions.\"\n\n\"Jak's right,\" Jon chimed in. \"We're not going to take any fool\nchances, but I say we've got to go ahead and do things just as we think\nPop would if he was well and in command. As best we can, that is.\"\n\nMrs. Carver looked from one son to the other doubtfully for a long\nminute, then smiled tremulously.\n\n\"I keep forgetting you're not my babies any longer,\" she said slowly.\n\"Mothers do that, you know. You're both almost grown men; I know you\nhave good minds, almost mature minds. The various things you've been\nthrough have done that. So I release you from my apron strings. You two\ntake charge, and do whatever you feel necessary.\"\n\nThey threw themselves on their knees, one on either side of her, their\narms about her.\n\n\"Oh, Mother, we didn't mean it like that!\"\n\n\"We never felt you had us tied to your apron strings, Mom,\" Jon added.\n\"We still want to be your boys, even though we do have to act like\nmen--at least until Pop takes charge again.\"\n\nHer smile now was warm and tender, all hesitancy and most of the\nfears gone. \"Mr. C. and I have tried to make you self-reliant and\nresourceful, and he'll be as proud of you as I am. You're right--you\nare the men of the party and must do whatever you decide should be\ndone. But be careful,\" she could not help adding.\n\n\"We will, Mother.\"\n\n\"We think just as much of us as you do,\" Jon quipped.\n\nThey left her sitting there, then, and went back to the control room.\nAs they came close to the window-ports they peered through eagerly, and\nwere surprised to see the huge carcass of the triped literally covered\nwith strange looking winged, featherless but fur-covered, bird-things.\nThe latter had large, sharp beaks, with which they were tearing great\ngobs of flesh from the hulk, gulping them down with ravenous relish.\n\n\"Scavengers!\" Jon exclaimed, his eyes glued to the scene.\n\n\"Yes, there go our steaks.\" Jak's tone was so lugubrious that Jon\nlooked up and laughed. \"I had hoped for some fresh meat.\"\n\n\"There'll be plenty later on,\" Jon consoled his brother. \"Probably this\none would've been too tough, anyway.\"\n\nJak suddenly chuckled. \"Yes, like the fox said, the grapes were\nprobably sour.\"\n\nThey grinned companionably at each other, then turned back to watch\nthrough the port again. So numerous and so voracious were the scavenger\nbirds that within a few minutes they had even that mammoth carcass\nstripped of flesh, leaving only the huge bones. One by one, the birds\nthen flew into the forest, the last ones fighting among themselves for\nthe few remaining scraps of stringy flesh or entrails before they, too,\ntook wing.\n\n\"Shall we try it now?\" Jak asked after the last of the bird-things had\ngone.\n\n\"Might as well. We sure don't want to be cooped up here forever.\"\n\nThey went back to the airlock again, making sure their guns were\nreloaded and their ammo belts filled. When both boys were in the lock,\nJon punched the button that closed the inner door, then opened the\nouter one. \"Safer for Mom to have one of them shut,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe two stood there a moment, looking all about them. Except for that\nstrange pile of huge bones, now covered thickly with some sort of\nreddish, chitinous-covered, ant-like insects, the clearing seemed empty\nof all life except the peculiar, flower-like grasses.\n\nJon climbed down to the ground and Jak followed closely. They walked a\nshort distance away, then turned and looked back, scanning carefully in\nall directions to make sure no enemy was at their backs.\n\n\"Let's go over and study that jungle a bit,\" Jak suggested when they\nwere sure their rear was not, apparently, menaced.\n\nJon had been looking at the remains of the beast. \"I'd like to try to\nsalvage those tusks,\" he said, and with Jak at his side went up to\nthem. The two boys managed, after considerable work, to get the great\nfangs out of the jaws. They brushed off the clinging insects, then ran\nback and placed the tusks inside the lock.\n\n\"Thanks, Owl. Now we'll go take a look at your trees. Then I want to\nexamine the tubes and the outside of the ship. But we'd better stick\ntogether, at least this first time. So I'll sort of cover you, then\nwhen you've had a looksee, we'll go back and you keep guard while I see\nwhat shape the boat's in.\"\n\n\"Right. Let's get going.\"\n\nOnce past the seared place, they found that the peculiar, flower-tipped\ngrasses were as stiff as wheat stubble. The grass-blades were knife\nsharp, but unable to penetrate the heavy, knee-high leather boots the\nboys wore.\n\nJak stooped to examine and study them. \"The blossoms all seem to have\nthree of these whitish petals,\" he said as he rose at last, \"and that\nyellowish bulb in the center will be the seed pod.\"\n\nWhen they started on again, they found walking difficult until they\nlearned the trick of scuffling along without trying to raise their\nfeet above the tops of the grasses each step. Then it was easier,\nparticularly since the gravity here was about five per cent less than\nthat of Terra, so they weighed less and their strength consequently\nseemed greater.\n\nThe trees were closely clustered for the most part, and after studying\nthem for some time Jak said, \"They're a lot like some of the pines back\nhome, although not too much like any I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Notice how there're no limbs until you get up thirty feet or so?\" Jon\nasked. \"They'd be hard to climb without spurs.\" Indeed, after anyone\ndid reach the first low limbs he would not be in much better shape for\nclimbing, for the branches were ten to fifteen feet apart all the way\nup.\n\n\"Don't see any fruits, though maybe we're just not where any fruit\ntrees are growing,\" Jak said after a bit.\n\n\"Yes, lots of woods back home don't have any fruit or nut trees in\nthem.\"\n\nThe strange grasses grew only in small, occasional clusters inside the\nforest, but the ground was so deeply covered with fallen twigs, rotted\nbranches and the needle-like leaves of previous years, that walking\nwas extremely difficult, almost impossible in places.\n\n\"There're probably trails somewhere--that triped would've made some\nsort of path.\"\n\n\"He sure was heavy enough, and if this was part of his regular stamping\nground, he undoubtedly used the same route.\"\n\n\"Maybe, but not necessarily. He might've been attracted by our descent.\nAnyway, we can look for that later. Let's go back now so you can look\nover the ship while it's still light. We should be ready for a quick\ntake-off, if we run into anything too hot to handle.\"\n\nJon looked the surprise he felt. This sudden responsibility was making\nJak more practical than he had ever been before ... just the same as\nit was making him. After all, it was to be expected. Jon knew Jak had\nan excellent mind--the elder brother had just used it for what Jon had\npreviously felt were unimportant things--not mechanics, math, or such\npractical interests.\n\nBut the way Jak had taken care of Pop; the way he had figured out\nhow to feed him, and the right medicines to use on the bruise on his\nhead--that must have injured Pop inside--and had known how to set his\nleg--it was a danged good thing, after all, that Jak had spent so much\ntime studying those other subjects. Maybe mechanics and such sciences\nwere not the main things in life, after all. Other things had their\nuses, too.\n\nNow the two went back to the ship and around to the stern. There, while\nJak stayed on the ground on guard, watching in all directions in turn\nfor any possible dangers, Jon surveyed the great driving tubes.\n\nHe climbed the metal rungs set into the ship for that purpose, so he\ncould reach each of the tubes. With his glotorch he studied the lining\nof each tube, crawling partially inside each one in turn.\n\nFinally he backed out of the last one and down to the ground. \"They're\nall in fine shape,\" he reported happily to his brother. \"Can't find a\nsingle thin spot in any of them. That new alloy is really something.\"\n\nAlthough the older brother did not know too much about such things, he\nfelt a sudden relief at this report, for he felt that Jon did know, and\nhe had real confidence in him. He had long realized the differences in\ntheir temperaments, and for several years had known his brother was\nalmost a genius in the mechanical field.\n\nHe remembered mentioning this matter to their father one time, and how\nhis eyes had shone with pride as he answered, \"Jon's really remarkable.\nSome day, if he keeps on like this, he's going to be known all over the\ngalaxy because of what he'll do in mechanics.\"\n\nNor had Jak been jealous at this high praise of his younger brother.\n\"Jon's just a kid,\" he had said, \"and he's thoughtless rather than\nconceited. But sometimes he makes me so darned mad.\"\n\nHis father laughed. \"Yes, like all kids, he hates the thought of\nletting anyone get ahead of him. That's particularly true of younger\nbrothers. They feel, within themselves, that they are just as good or\nbetter than the older members of the family, and sometimes can't help\nshowing it.\"\n\nJak grinned. \"I'll bust him one yet, some day, though, if he doesn't\nwatch out.\"\n\nBut he knew, and so did his father, that he never would. For both knew\nthe real love that existed between the two brothers. Jak realized\nthat his swiftly growing brother--now several inches taller and many\npounds heavier than he--had a terrific mind. So, as now, he generally\nrespected Jon's ideas, and shrugged away any momentary angers when Jon\nwas particularly \"bossy.\"\n\nJak followed as Jon walked slowly along the side of the ship, giving it\na careful survey, especially toward the bottom, to see if anything on\nthe lower surfaces appeared wrong.\n\n\"I'll climb up and give the top a going-over tomorrow,\" Jon said as\nthey went ahead.\n\nThe _Star Rover_ was really a space-yacht. It was seventy-two feet\nlong, and about eighteen feet in diameter at its thickest part, which\nwas about a third of the way back from the bow. The front of the\nship was bluntly rounded, and contained the control room with its\nthick, quartzite window-ports, and just outside that room the four\nbow-retarding tubes, which Jon also carefully examined when the boys\nreached them.\n\nJust aft of the control room were the living quarters. These consisted\nof the large, comfortable living room, and two small but compact\nbunkrooms, the bath-toilet, the kitchen and many ingeniously designed\ncloset and drawer spaces for stowing personal belongings, clothing and\nsupplies.\n\nBeyond these were the storerooms for food, tools and other supplies and\nequipment. The stern two-fifths of the ship was devoted to the storage\nof fuel and the various machines that drove the space-yacht and kept it\na self-contained world while in space.\n\nHere were the refrigerators and heaters, the air- and water-purifiers,\nthe generators of electricity for light and cooking and for their\nauxiliary motors, such as the ones controlling the airlock doors and\npumps. In the lower part of the hull, under their living and control\nrooms and storerooms, were hydroponic tanks which not only grew\nvegetables and greens for their table, but which furnished oxygen to\nreplace that unavoidably lost when the locks were opened.\n\nAt the far stem were the driving mechanisms. The latter were the latest\ndevelopment in the atomic-powered field, and were surprisingly small\nfor the tremendous work they did.\n\nEven Jon did not yet fully understand how they operated, although he\nknew how to run them. He did know they took specially-treated copper,\nin the form of small nuggets, and utilized the tremendous force locked\nwithin their atoms as the propelling medium by which the ship operated.\n\nIn some manner these nuggets were vaporized inside the generators, into\nwhich they were automatically fed from the storage bins as needed--the\npower-controls regulating the speed with which they were fed into\nthe generators. This vaporized copper was run through some sort of\na modified cyclotron-type mechanism, where the binding-force of its\natoms was liberated. That indescribable power then forced its vaporized\nparticles out through the tubes--using the Newtonian law of action and\nreaction to propel the ship.\n\nSuddenly Jon turned to his brother. \"Hey, I just happened to think. We\nought to rig up a siren or something, so Mom can call us if she needs\nus when we're away from the ship.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a swell idea. Can fix?\"\n\n\"Sure, nothing to it. We may even have one among the stores. If not,\nit's just a diaphragm inside a tube, oscillated by electricity. I'll\nsee if we've got one, or else make one and install it.\"\n\nAs they neared the entrance to the ship they saw their mother standing\nin the opened lock, getting a breath of fresh air, and looking about\nthe clearing with an interested expression.\n\nJon had just opened his mouth to call to her when suddenly, without\nwarning, without even a change in the light or feeling in the air, rain\nbegan coming down in great sheets. The boys, after only a momentary\nstart of surprise, raced for the airlock. Their mother stayed to help\nthem climb in. But by the time they were inside and the outer door was\nclosed, they were wet through to the skin.\n\n\"Wow, that's sure some storm! Wonder if it's a regular feature here?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" Jak panted. \"Did you get a look at that lightning,\nand hear the thunder?\"\n\n\"Didn't take time--I was too busy running.\" Jon laughed as he tried\nto wring the worst of the water out of his coveralls before going\nthrough the living room to the bunkroom, where they could change to dry\ngarments.\n\nAs they came out their mother, now also in dry clothes, met them with a\nsmile. \"I think your father is getting better--he moved about quite a\nbit a while ago, although he didn't completely regain consciousness.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\"\n\n\"That's super!\"\n\nLater, as the three were eating dinner, Jak suddenly laid down his fork\nin excitement. \"Just happened to think. We didn't see any cities here,\nso doesn't that make this a prime discovery?\"\n\n\"That it do, that it do,\" Jon said delightedly.\n\n\"Then that means we have the right to name and claim this system....\"\n\n\"Unless there are intelligent inhabitants on some of the other planets.\"\n\n\"Seems to me if there were any, they'd be here--this is certain to be\nthe most logical world to support life. What'll we call this system?\"\n\n\"'Carveria,' of course, stupid. After Pop,\" Jon answered witheringly.\n\n\"That's very thoughtful of you, Son.\" His mother smiled at him fondly.\n\n\"We'll call the sun 'Carveria,' then, and the five planets will be\n'Tad,' 'Marci,' 'Jak,' 'Jon,' and 'Rover.'\"\n\n\"Ouch, how corny can you get?\" Jon sniffed. \"Since there are five, I\nknow the fifth should be named for the ship, and we can't very well\ncall it 'Star Rover.' But certainly not just 'Rover,' either.\"\n\n\"Why not leave off the last 'r' and just call it 'Rove'?\" their mother\nsuggested.\n\n\"Good!\" \"Swell!\" the two exclaimed at once.\n\n\"That means this one is named after you, Mom. How does it feel to have\na whole world named after you?\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" she retorted with a smile that brought out her\ndimples in the old way. \"You've each got one named for you.\"\n\n\"Then let's call this moon 'Diana,' after the ancient goddess of the\nmoon,\" Jak said.\n\n\"Look, Owl, this is Mom's planet. She has the right to name her own\nmoon.\" Jon's voice was almost a sneer.\n\n\"I think 'Diana' is a very nice name, and I'll accept that, although\nI'm going to make it 'Diane,'\" his mother soothed. \"That has always\nbeen my favorite girl name. If I'd ever had a daughter, I probably\nwould have named her 'Diane.' So it will make a doubly fine name for my\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Haven't time to measure or weigh it now, but I'll bet it's big enough,\nand close enough, to cause tides,\" Jon said meditatively.\n\n\"What's that got to do with the price of onions in Bermuda?\"\n\n\"Nothing, just thought it was interesting. Well, bed for me. Need a\ngood rest tonight.\"\n\n\"Why, especially, Son? What do you plan for tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Just some more exploring, that's all. And we'll be careful,\" Jon added\nhastily as he saw the familiar words forming on her lips. \"'Night,\nMom.\"\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAt breakfast the next morning Jon suddenly stopped eating. \"Say, as\nwe were coming down, did you notice a small river or creek just over\nthere to the right? I was pretty busy at the time, but seem to remember\nsomething of the sort.\"\n\n\"Yes, there was one near, but don't know just how far. Why?\"\n\nThe boy grinned. \"If there's a stream, there're probably fish. I was\nthinking we could get some fresh supplies that way.\"\n\n\"You and your fishing! Don't you ever think of anything else?\"\n\n\"Sure I do, but I notice you always eat your share when I catch any and\nMom cooks 'em.\"\n\nTheir mother said quickly, \"Some fresh fish would taste good, Boys. If\nyou have time and can catch any, I know we would all appreciate them.\"\n\n\"Look, Jak, you want to explore some more of that jungle, and I want\nto see if there's any of that stuff Pop was looking for, near here.\nWe can just as well do both while working toward that creek, and I can\ntake my rod along. But first, we've got to set up our marker here in\nthe clearing.\"\n\n\"That's right, I'd almost forgotten your telling us about that. And we\ndon't want to stay too long, either. Didn't you say we have to place\none on each planet in order to prove our claim as original discovers?\"\n\n\"Yes, and one in an orbit about the sun, too.\" Jon pushed back his\nchair and rose. \"I'll go get one from the storeroom.\"\n\n\"I'll get my specimen cases ready, and see to the guns.\" Jak, too,\nrose, then forestalled his mother by turning to her, \"I'll feed Father\nfirst, and we'll be careful outside. You can call us back with the new\nsiren Jon installed, if you need us.\"\n\n\"All right, Boys.\" She smiled at them. \"Mr. C. seemed to rest well last\nnight, although I do wish he would regain full consciousness. I've\nplenty of housekeeping to keep busy while you're gone. Really should do\nsome washing, but that doesn't take long. Just don't stay out too late.\"\n\n\"We won't,\" they both assured her. \"We'll be back long before dark.\"\n\nThe marker which Jon fetched from the storeroom and placed near the\ninner lockdoor, ready to take outside and set up, was one developed by\nthe scientists and technies of Terra for just such use.\n\nIt consisted of an exceptionally strong broadcasting unit that beamed\nthe message of a tape, continuously, toward Terra. Jon made up the tape\nwhile Jak was giving the feeding. It read, \"This planetary system was\nfirst discovered by Tad Carver, on fourteenth January, 2136. This is\nthe second planet, and has been named 'Marci.'\"\n\nOver and over, at five-minute intervals, the sender would broadcast\nthat message on a beam aimed at Terra. The controlling mechanism was a\nmarvelously precise uranium clock, and a small atomic motor with fuel\nenough for five years gave all the needed power.\n\nBy the terms of the Terran Colonial laws, this was supposed to entitle\nthe prime discover to certain rights in the system. For one thing, he\nwould receive a one-half per cent share of the value of all minerals,\noils, jewels and certain other natural resources later colonists might\nwrest from those planets, for twenty years following his discovery and\nthe acceptance of his claim.\n\nIn this way, the Colonial Board of the World Government of Terra\nsponsored and assured the far-flung exploration which the development\nof deep-space travel had made possible. The dangers and expense were\nso considerable that something well worth while had to be offered to\nmake individuals or companies willing to gamble on the hardships and\ntremendous costs of exploration.\n\nWhen the boys left the ship to place the marker, they left both\nlockdoors open so that the fresh morning air from outside could\ncirculate throughout the ship, replacing the somewhat stuffy, although\nchemically pure air that their purifiers kept renewed.\n\n\"Keep your eyes and ears open, and shut the doors if you think there's\nany danger,\" both boys cautioned their mother, after making sure she\nknew how to work the door controls.\n\n\"I will,\" she promised with a laugh, and couldn't help adding, \"Just\nyou be as careful as I'll be.\"\n\nThe boys carried the signal-sender to a distant corner of the clearing,\nto what Jon said was a good spot. \"The book says to dig a hole and\nplant it with the top projecting three inches above the ground,\nwhenever such a thing is possible.\"\n\n\"You know what to do, so take charge,\" Jak said simply. When they had\ndug the hole and placed the sender in it, they shoveled the dirt back,\nthen Jon opened the lid. He started the tape reels and the broadcasting\nunit, then carefully shut and locked the cover.\n\nIn digging, they found the ground here to be damp and soggy, apparently\nfrom that terrific downpour of the previous evening. It was almost like\na wet clay, although, even to their inexperienced eyes, it seemed to be\na very rich type of soil.\n\n\"Look how wet it is, even over two feet down,\" Jon said.\n\n\"That was a real rain last night,\" Jak shook his head slowly, \"but\nsomehow I can't believe it made this. Maybe this is the rainy season.\"\n\nThey started toward the jungle, but turned to look back toward the\nship. They saw their mother at the open door, and waved to her.\n\nAfter seeing her answering wave, they plunged into the forest at a\npoint where they saw a trail, left either by the frequent passings\nof the great triped they had shot, or by other beasts of some type\nnot yet seen. Memory of that gigantic beast, though, made them doubly\ncautious.\n\n\"Sure don't want to meet his relatives,\" Jon said.\n\n\"Especially the mate,\" Jak added, and could not conceal a shiver.\n\nThey had noticed with considerable interest and surprise that those\nnative ant-like scavengers had almost entirely eaten the bones of the\ntriped.\n\n\"Apparently we'll not find much in the way of remains on this world,\"\nJak commented as they walked carefully along the trail. \"Those\nscavenger birds and ants sure clean up things in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Except for old vegetation,\" Jon grunted as he stumbled over a dead\nbranch protruding out into the trail. He was keeping his rifle ready\nin his hands, and his keen eyes alert to one side and then the other,\nrather than downward.\n\nKnowing his younger brother was so carefully on guard, Jak felt free\nto study and examine the various trees and other plant life near the\nirregular path they were following. He was almost in a frenzy of\ndelight, constantly darting off the trail a few yards to look at some\nspecimen he had detected, studying it carefully and exclaiming over his\nfind.\n\n\"Hey, this one is like an _acer compestris_,\" he yelped, intently\nstudying the bark with his magnifying glass.\n\n\"Spik Englis,\" Jon scolded. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"A hard maple,\" Jak's voice was condescending. Then he ran over to\nanother. \"This one's almost like a silver poplar. See how its light\nbark glints where the sunlight hits it?\"\n\nHe started toward another farther away, but Jon called him back. \"Don't\nget so far from the trail.\" Reluctantly, Jak retraced his steps, only\nto be off again a moment later.\n\n\"This 'un's got nuts almost like small coconuts.\" He picked a fallen\none from the ground and tossed it to Jon. \"See if you can crack it and\nfind out what's inside.\"\n\nBut when Jon had done so, it proved to be dried and half-rotted. They\ncould not get a fresh one from the tree by shaking, and it was too\nsmooth and high to climb without spurs.\n\nJak quickly filled his knapsacks with first one and then another of\nthe smaller plants, twigs and leaves he was continually finding. Soon\nJon was laughing heartily, for his brother now had to discard an older\nspecimen to make room for the new.\n\n\"You'll have to make several trips to get anywhere near all of those\njust around here, Owl,\" Jon called at last. \"You can't take back\neverything, anyway. Way you're going now, you'd soon have the ship so\nfull of your junk there'd be no place for us. And this is only the\nfirst planet, remember?\"\n\n\"But these are unique,\" Jak wailed. \"Botanists will want to study them.\"\n\n\"Then let them come here,\" Jon stated practically.\n\nJak looked at him, and grew shamefaced. \"Guess I did go a little nuts,\"\nhe said. But before long his excitement rose to fever pitch again.\n\"There's so much here that's new and different, yet something like the\nones we know. I must take back samples of everything.\"\n\n\"How many different kinds of--oh, say, roses--are there on Terra?\"\n\n\"Why ... why ... I don't really know. Hundreds, I'm sure. Maybe\nthousands. What's that got to do with this?\"\n\n\"Simply trying to make you realize you can't take back samples of\n'everything,' as you said.\"\n\n\"Ouch!\" Jak laughed good-naturedly then. \"You've got me, pal. I'll take\nit easier.\"\n\nBut he soon forgot his good intentions as he found ever newer and more\ndifferent plants and trees and mosses. There was such a dissimilarity,\nyet at the same time so many points of likeness between the plant life\nof this new world and that of Terra, that the young botanist was in a\ncontinual state of excitement.\n\nJon, meanwhile, although still keeping a sharp watch for any possible\ndangers, had been noticing the profusion of other life in this jungle.\nThere were a number of different bird forms, although he saw that those\nhe was close enough to examine were fur-covered rather than feathered.\nNor did they seem to be songsters, for the only noises he heard were\nthe soughing of the wind through the trees and vines and bushes, and\nthe _swish_ of wings as the birds flew past.\n\nThey had gone some distance when he stopped short. Off at one side\nthere was movement among the small bushes. A quick sibilant whisper\nfroze Jak in his tracks. Jon raised his gun, his eyes searching\nquickly. Then two quick shots ... and a threshing in the underbrush.\nSoon stillness--and the two boys advanced cautiously, both with their\nguns at the ready. In the bushes they found what Jon had shot--two\nsmall tripeds somewhat resembling large jack rabbits.\n\n\"Hah, these should be good eating.\" Jon was in transports as he picked\nthem up, examining them carefully.\n\n\"Should be tender, at least, if the flesh is suitable to us.\" Jak was\nexcited, too. \"There's enough for a good meal.\"\n\nJon took a piece of cord from his coverall pocket and tied the hind\nlegs together, then slung them over his shoulder. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\nJak continued finding new and different plants, and Jon kept on guard.\nOnce they saw one of the huge tripeds in the distance, and stopped\ninstantly, being very quiet as they slipped behind the boles of large\ntrees, from which they peered out cautiously. But apparently the\ngreat beast had not heard, seen nor smelled them--it finally wandered\naway--grazing.\n\n\"Well, I'll be a tadpole!\" Jon exclaimed. \"A grass-eater.\"\n\nBut Jak was not so sure. \"Lots of meat-eaters also eat a little grass.\nThose teeth didn't look like the ones of a herbivore. I think I'll keep\naway from them, anyway.\"\n\n\"You and me both!\" Jon was agreeable to the idea.\n\nAt last, after nearly two hours, the two boys came to the banks of the\nstream, which was about a quarter mile wide at this point, and seemed\nnot too deep, at least near the shore. Now it was Jon's turn to become\nthe most excited. He ran to the edge and peered into the shallow\ndepths, then called out delightedly at seeing dozens of darting forms\nof some type of marine life in the clear waters.\n\n\"You watch while I fish,\" he commanded, dropping his gun and the two\nhare-like creatures. He took the carrying case from his shoulder,\nopened it and in moments had his rod, reel and line ready.\n\n\"Yippee!\" he yelled as he got an immediate strike on his first cast.\nWith true fisherman's skill, he played the now fighting, swiftly\ndarting denizen of the river. Carefully he reeled in his catch, giving\nline when the fish ran or plunged, reeling in when he felt the least\nbit of slack, exerting only enough pressure to force the fish-thing in\ntoward him without losing it.\n\nSoon the wriggling creature was in shallow water, and Jon waded out\nwith his landing net. A quick, darting movement with hand and net, and\nhe had his first catch.\n\nHe took it carefully from the net and held it aloft, examining and\nadmiring it, while Jak danced about on the shore near him, uttering\nshrill yelps of triumph.\n\nThey could see that Jon's catch was streamlined almost like a trout\nor barracuda. It was nearly fifteen inches long, and very slender.\nThere seemed to be no scales--the skin was more like that of an eel or\nbullhead.\n\n\"Fish or snake?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"Don't know for sure.\" Jon was still studying it. \"Think it's a fish,\nall right, but it hasn't any fins, and swims with the same wriggles a\nsnake uses. I think it's more eel than snake, though, and I'm quite\nsure it'll be good eating.\"\n\nThe mouth was large and ran back almost three and a half inches. When\nJon pried it open to remove his hook he saw there was a triple row of\nneedle-sharp teeth, so quickly took a pair of pliers from his tool\nbelt, and used these to remove the deeply swallowed hook.\n\nThe eel-fish freed, he dropped it into his creel, then cast again. It\nwas apparent these water denizens were unused to lures, for hardly had\nhis spinner touched the surface of the water than he had another strike.\n\nAs swiftly as he could reel in and remove one from his hook and cast\nagain, Jon brought in fish after fish. All this time Jak was dancing\nabout, now as excited as his brother at this prospect of fresh food to\nreplace for the time the nourishing but hardly-delectable concentrates\nand frozen foods on which they had been living for so long.\n\nBut when Jon finally was satisfied with the size of his catch, he found\nthat leaving the river was not to be a simple matter of wading ashore.\nSo intent had he been on his fun he had not noticed that his feet were\nsinking further and further into the bottom.\n\nOnly now, as he tried to return to shore, did he find he could not lift\nhis feet. They were firmly embedded in the sand or muck, more than\nhalfway to his knees.\n\nFor a long moment he struggled to pull first one foot and then the\nother from the clinging stuff. Then he realized he must be in a sort of\nquicksand, and he began to panic.\n\n\"Quick, Jak, come help me! I'm caught.\"\n\nBut almost instantly he countermanded that sharply. \"No! Stay back.\nThe bottom here's quicksand or something.\"\n\nJak had come running at Jon's first cry. At this warning, though, he\nslid to a halt just short of the water. \"How can I help?\" he cried\nanxiously.\n\n\"Catch these first.\" And Jon threw first his rod, then his creel filled\nwith fish.\n\nJak caught each and tossed them farther back onto the bank. He then\nlooked quickly about, and spied a long, fallen branch at some little\ndistance. He called to his brother, who was still trying desperately to\nfree himself, \"Hang on a minute. I'll be right back.\"\n\nRacing for the branch, he picked it up and brought it back to the\nwater's edge. But when he extended it toward Jon, it was too short by\nseveral feet, even though both leaned forward. Jak would have gone into\nthe water with it, but Jon would not let him.\n\n\"We'll have to try something else, then.\" Jak was getting really\nworried now, for he could see that the water was up to Jon's waist.\n\n\"You'll have to make it snappy,\" Jon spoke as calmly as he could. \"I'm\nsinking deeper all the time.\"\n\nAgain Jak searched swiftly and purposefully about him. He saw something\nhe thought might help and ran swiftly toward one of the smaller trees.\nWith difficulty, because of the scarcity of limbs, he climbed this and\nsoon was hacking, with his machete-like knife, at the long, slender\nliana or climbing vine that hung downward from it. It took only a few\nmoments to sever the top end, then Jak slid down the trunk and traced\nthe vine to its root, cutting it there. With this long section he ran\nback to the water's edge.\n\n\"Catch,\" he yelled--but it took several attempts before he could get\nthe unwieldy vine-end near enough for Jon to grasp.\n\nJak dug his heels into the ground and started pulling. His face grew\nred, cords stood out in his neck, and his muscles bulged. But quickly\nthe strain proved too great for him. Since he was the lighter and\nweaker he was being pulled toward the water, rather than freeing his\nembedded brother.\n\n\"I ... can't ... do it,\" Jak panted, his strength gone, his muscles and\nlimbs aching and trembling.\n\n\"Tie your end around a tree. I'll try to work myself out.\"\n\nJak did so, and the muscles on Jon's more powerful arms, back and\nshoulders stood out in ridges as he threw all his splendid young\nstrength into this climactic effort. He pulled, he wriggled about from\nside to side.\n\nSlow, heartbreaking moments passed as the tug of war continued. Inch\nby hard-fought inch Jon was withdrawing his imprisoned legs from the\nsucking, gripping stuff that was so determined not to yield its victim.\n\nBut he was still only a boy, and he had neither the strength nor the\nendurance to continue for long this tremendous struggle. Slowly his\nefforts grew weaker and less successful. The sand began reclaiming that\nwhich it had lost. Before long Jon sank back, and the strain on the\nvine relaxed.\n\n\"Can't ... make it. You've been a great brother....\" He tried to\nsmile. \"Take care of Mom and Pop ... and break it to them gently.\"\n\n\"Shut up, you dope,\" Jak yelled, but there was a catch in his voice.\n\"We're not licked yet!\"\n\nDesperately his mind raced. He must think of some more effective mode\nof leverage. If only he knew how to handle the ship! He could bring\nthat here, and with the loading winch in the lock drag his brother\nloose. But that was out--he didn't know how to handle it.\n\nHe thought of going after his mother, but realized quickly that before\nhe got her and brought her back, Jon would be gone.\n\nNo, it was strictly up to him--and time was swiftly running out.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nJak Carver's eyes searched the edge of the jungle feverishly for any\nidea--for some means of rescuing his younger brother, embedded in the\nquicksand of the stream there.\n\nSuddenly he spied a slim but stout-looking tree close to the water's\nedge ... and a trick the two boys had often played with a small tree in\ntheir back yard at home sprang into his mind.\n\n\"Got an idea, Jon. Slack off a minute.\"\n\nFor Jon had been trying again and again, as he felt a momentary return\nof part of his strength, to pull himself free. He had, by this means,\nbarely managed to keep from sinking further, but that was all.\n\nNow, with a quick twist, Jak unfastened the end of the liana from the\ntree to which he had tied it. \"Tie your end about you, just under the\narms,\" he called. Then, placing his end of the vine in his mouth and\ngripping it firmly with his teeth, he started climbing that slim tree.\nIt was about seven inches in diameter at the base, and some forty to\nforty-five feet tall.\n\nHis brother instantly recognized what he had in mind. So, as Jak\nclimbed, Jon made sure his end was securely fastened about him. Then he\ngrasped the vine firmly with both hands, a few inches in front of his\nchest.\n\nAs Jak climbed ever higher into the tree, the slender sapling bent\nbeneath his weight. He still climbed, but carefully now, on the side\nnearest the water, so the treetop would bend in that direction. The\nhigher he climbed the tree, the more his weight made it curve downward,\nso that toward the last, his back was almost parallel to the ground.\n\nHolding with his legs wrapped about the trunk, when he was almost\nthree-quarters of the way up, Jak fastened his end of the liana tautly\nin place. This was extremely difficult because of his unnatural\nposition, as well as the stiffness of the vine and his having to work\nwith one hand. But without wasting time, he took pains to make sure the\nknot was tight and secure.\n\nThen he started climbing again, further and further toward the slender\ntop of the now bent tree. But carefully, lest his weight and the\nbending splinter or snap the treetop as it bent still further.\n\n\"Get tight, Jon. Be ready for the yank when I let go.\"\n\n\"All set and line tight. Yell when you drop.\"\n\nGlancing down to see that the way was clear below him, Jak let his legs\ngo and swung by his arms until he was hanging clear. He yelled sharply\nand let go--plunging down the fifteen or eighteen feet to the ground.\n\nDisregarding the shock, he scrambled up, and peered closely at the\ntree, then the vine, then at Jon. The tree was straining to pull back\ninto its accustomed erectness. The liana was taut--but bits of its bark\nwere flecking off. It creaked so alarmingly Jak was afraid it would\nbreak.\n\nAll the time Jon was wriggling and twisting to help free his feet and\nlegs. And the vine held, as the tree proved its natural strength and\ndesire for an upright position. Slowly but surely Jon's body was pulled\nfrom its prison. As he came more nearly free the tree snapped upright\nso swiftly he was whipped out of the water and a dozen feet onto the\nsand. He landed, face down, with a terrific jar.\n\nJak ran up and helped untie the vine. Jon sat up slowly with his\nbrother's help. His face was scuffed where it had slid along the sandy\nbeach, and he slowly, painfully wiped it somewhat clean with his\nhandkerchief. His breath came in gasps from the terrible constriction\nof the vine about his chest, and from his unusual exertions.\n\nSympathetically, Jak hovered about until finally Jon's breathing was a\nbit easier. When his brother started to try to get up, he helped and\nheld him.\n\n\"Guess I can make it now.\" Jon finally broke away and did manage to\nstand alone, although he still reeled a bit from the fatigue and the\nterrible ordeal through which he had been.\n\nHe walked slowly about, rolling his shoulders and moving his arms and\nfingers, exercising his cramped muscles. Jak gave him a couple of\nanti-fatigue pills from his pocket first-aid kit, and Jon swallowed\nthese. Finally, he began collecting his rod and creel.\n\n\"They'd danged well better be good to eat,\" he declared, shaking the\noffending fish basket.\n\n\"It certainly wasn't worth all that narrow escape,\" Jak said soberly as\nhe took the things from his brother and went over to pick up the little\nanimal carcasses. But when he got there he exclaimed in disgust, \"Darn,\nthose ants have eaten them almost all up!\"\n\n\"We mustn't let Mom know how close I came to not getting back,\" Jon\nsaid as he staggered along the little trail, although as he went his\nstrength and limberness returned somewhat.\n\n\"I'll say not. I'll keep my trap shut. One thing's sure, though.\nThere'll be no more fishing trips here.\"\n\n\"Aw, I wouldn't say that,\" Jon snapped back. \"I know enough now to stay\non the bank. And if these are good eating, it's too easy a way to get\nfresh food to waste.\"\n\nThey were just climbing into the lock when again that sudden heavy\ndownpour of rain began.\n\nJon grinned as he opened the inner door. \"Glad to see the rain this\ntime. It'll keep Mom from wondering why my clothes are so wet.\"\n\nAs soon as they had changed to dry clothing, Jon went to clean his\n\"fish,\" then took them to his mother in the galley. Jak, meanwhile, was\nin the control room, rearranging and trying to begin the classification\nof his plant specimens.\n\nWhen their mother called them to table, the boys sniffed\nappreciatively at the delicious odor of the nicely browned fish-things.\n\n\"They cook nicely, but how do we tell if they're good to eat?\" Mrs.\nCarver asked.\n\nJak flipped one onto his plate and cut off a tiny portion. \"Tell you\nsoon.\" And he forked the piece into his mouth. With his tongue and\nteeth he tested it, but did not swallow. \"Tastes good,\" he said a\nmoment later, retrieving the piece with his fork and laying it on the\nside of his plate. \"One more test.\"\n\nHe cut off another small piece and took it into the storeroom, where\nhe placed a piece in one of the cages containing half a dozen white\nrats. A couple of them came up immediately, smelled the food, then one\nof them gobbled it up. Jak watched anxiously for a moment, then gave\nanother rat a piece. It, too, gobbled it up, and then joined the rest\nwho were pressed against the wires begging for more. Jak stood watching\nfor one minute, then two, then three. Satisfied that the meat had done\nthe rodents no harm, he returned to the table.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he said and began eating. \"The rats liked it and it\ndidn't seem to hurt them.\"\n\nThe others pitched in then, and soon the entire platterful was reduced\nto a pile of bones on the three plates.\n\n\"How's Father been today,\" Jak asked. \"He was asleep when I glanced at\nhim after getting back.\"\n\n\"He moved about several times, tossing and groaning a bit, and seeming\nto be trying to touch his broken leg, although....\"\n\n\"Probably it itches inside the cast,\" Jak said.\n\n\"He didn't regain full consciousness, but I tried spooning some\nconcentrated broth into his mouth, and he was able to swallow a little\nof it.\"\n\n\"Golly, that's great!\" Jak exclaimed in relief. \"His drifting out of\nhis coma from time to time shows there is no real damage to his brain,\nand now he's evidently beginning to come out of the concussion.\"\n\n\"Whatever it is, I feel more sure he'll soon regain consciousness and\nbe all right.\" Mrs. Carver spoke with quiet confidence.\n\n\"Of course he will, Mom. Pop's too tough for a busted leg and a bump on\nthe head to kill him.\" Jon smiled at her comfortingly.\n\n\"As the surface wound heals, the brain tissues beneath will also be\nhealing,\" Jak said pedantically. \"As long as we can keep him fed and\notherwise healthy, the concussion will grow less and finally dissipate\nentirely.\"\n\n\"Doctor Carver, I presume.\" Jon sniggered, and his brother flushed a\nbit, then poked him in the ribs.\n\nJon tried not to wince at that light jab. Luckily their mother had not\nnoticed anything so, as quickly as possible, he said, \"Well, Owl, let's\nhit the sack. Want to move around this planet tomorrow and get our pics\nand info, then take a look at the others.\"\n\nJak started to protest, but caught his brother's almost imperceptible\nbut frantic signal, and changed his words. \"Maybe Jon's right at that,\nand we should get an early start. 'Night, Mother.\"\n\n\"Good night, Boys.\" She responded to their kisses, and soon the two\nwere in their bunkroom, with the door closed.\n\nJak turned swiftly on his brother. \"What's the big idea, making us go\nto bed so early, and why that funny look you gave me?\"\n\n\"I had to get out of there.\" Jon winced as he began taking off his\nshirt, and Jak crammed his fist into his mouth to keep from crying out\nas he saw the great, angry red welts and the terrible black-and-blue\nsplotches on Jon's torso.\n\n\"Great guns! What happened?\"\n\n\"That vine must have really hurt when it pulled me loose from that\nquicksand. I didn't notice it particularly, though, until you poked me\nin the ribs.\"\n\nJak quickly dragged his large first-aid kit from its place in the wall\ncupboard, and opened it. \"Lie down on the bunk, and I'll fix you up,\"\nhe said as he took out tubes of unguents, bottles of antiseptic and\nrolls of bandages and plasters from the kit. \"Golly, kid, I had no idea\nyou were in that shape, or I'd have done this before.\"\n\nJon gritted his teeth as the other gently felt to see if any ribs\nwere broken, and later as Jak applied the healing lotions and\nsometimes smarting antiseptics. But he could not entirely restrain his\nexclamations of pain, although he muffled them with his pillow lest\ntheir mother hear and come to investigate. He knew his brother was\nbeing sympathetically gentle, and when at last it was done, Jon did\nfeel easier. The burning had largely stopped, and some of the ache was\ngone.\n\n\"I'd better give you some barbit so you'll sleep sounder.\" Jak shook\ntwo small pills from a bottle. \"The calmer you sleep, the less you'll\nmess up those dressings, and the quicker you'll heal.\"\n\nHe got a glass of water and Jon took the pills and washed them down.\n\"You do have your uses now and then,\" he growled, but the grateful look\nin his eyes belied the ungraciousness of his words--and Jak was well\ncontent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning much of the soreness and discoloration was gone, and\nthere was no sign of inflammation or pus. After Jak had again tended to\nthe abrasions and friction sores, the two boys dressed and went in to\nbreakfast.\n\nTheir mother was in good spirits. \"Mr. C.'s breathing seems much easier\nthan it was,\" she announced with delight.\n\nThey all went in to see him, and while Jak was redressing the now\nalmost healed head wound, Jon looked on happily.\n\n\"Won't be long now.\" He hugged his mother joyfully.\n\n\"I hope not,\" she sighed. \"He does seem to be getting better, though.\"\n\n\"We're lucky we still have him, Mother.\" Jak's voice was serious. \"If\nthat rock had even touched him, it would have been the end. His leg\nlooks OK--no signs of swelling or inflammation.\"\n\nBreakfast was quiet, and as soon as they finished Jon rose\npurposefully. \"I'll take us up now, and we'll cruise around and see\nwhat we can see. Have to take lots of recordings and pictures, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you understand all that has to be done?\" His mother's\nvoice was anxious.\n\n\"Sure, Mom. It tells all about it on the papers the Colonial Board\nfurnished. All we have to do is follow their instructions. You coming,\nJak?\"\n\n\"Right with you.\" His brother hastily drank the rest of his coffee and\nrose, wiping his mouth. \"Be sure you strap down at the signal, Mother,\nif you aren't coming with us.\"\n\nShe flashed him a smile. \"I will. Meanwhile, I'll clear the table--if I\nhave time?\" She looked questioningly at Jon.\n\n\"Sure, it'll take ten--fifteen minutes to get ready, and I'll give you\na couple of one-minute warnings.\"\n\nWhen all was ready, Jak strapped himself down in the co-pilot's seat,\nthe book of instructions in his hand. Jon touched the stud of the\nbuzzer, waited a full minute then punched two buzzes. Then he nodded at\nhis brother.\n\n\"Close fuel dump valves,\" Jak said, referring to the manual.\n\n\"Valves closed.\"\n\n\"Switch on fuel pumps.\"\n\n\"Pumps on.\"\n\n\"Switch on generators.\"\n\n\"Gens on.\"\n\n\"Open all oil valves.\"\n\n\"Oil open.\"\n\n\"Check heaters.\"\n\n\"Heaters on.\"\n\n\"Check refrigerators.\"\n\n\"Frigs on.\"\n\n\"Fire tube one and balance.\"\n\nJon snapped a switch. A dull rumbling began and the ship seemed to\nstrain as the first tube started functioning, although at minimum\nstrength. He carefully watched a dial to see that it was working\nsmoothly.\n\nFinally, \"Tube one firing.\"\n\nIn like manner tubes four, two and then three were started and\ntested, and finally reported firing evenly. The ship seemed more than\never straining, as though anxious to get into the air and into free\nspace--but remained on the ground.\n\n\"Up landing props.\"\n\nJon touched another stud, and they could feel the motor lifting the\nlanding props into their slots in the hull.\n\n\"Take off.\"\n\nThe roar deepened as Jon increased the amounts of fuel being fed into\nthe tubes. The ship lifted effortlessly, easily, into the air.\n\n\"Check acceleration pressure.\"\n\n\"Normal to speed.\"\n\n\"Check altimeter.\"\n\n\"One thousand seven hundred.\"\n\n\"Level off.\"\n\nA moment of maneuvering, then Jon reported, \"Ship level at twenty-four\nhundred, traveling parallel to ground surface.\"\n\n\"Check rocket balance.\"\n\n\"All tubes on balance.\"\n\n\"Switch on auto-pilot.\"\n\n\"Auto on, but keeping ready to switch back to manual if necessary.\"\n\nJak loosened his straps and went to look out of the port, but Jon kept\nhis gaze fastened on the lookout plate before him, his hands resting\nlightly on the controls, although they were not connected now.\n\nBeneath them the land was sliding by, as the ship cruised at the slow\nspeed, for it, of just under a thousand miles an hour. The boys saw the\nsame sort of jungle forests, the same occasional clearings. From time\nto time the glint of water revealed rivers or lakes, the latter seldom\nmore than a mile or so in width or length.\n\nAfter nearly an hour, they were flying above a huge plain, covered with\nsome sort of grass or grain. They had been above this for some minutes\nwhen Jon uttered an exclamation and Jak came up quickly to see what his\nbrother had spotted in the magnifier-screen.\n\n\"Look down there, Owl,\" the younger brother was excited. \"Thousands of\ncattle!\"\n\n\"Whew! Most like those old buffalo-herds we read the old pioneers saw\non the western plains of Noramer. Hey, those things are tripeds, too,\nlike the big one we shot, and the rabbits.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see. Must be the usual thing here. But those down there are\nsmaller, like cows. Wonder if they're good to eat, or give milk?\"\n\n\"Don't know, but we sure want to report this.\"\n\nHe took several pictures with the recording camera, then made notations\nin the data book. The two continued watching until the tremendous herd\nwas out of sight behind them, and they were flying once more above a\ngreat forest. They had gone almost two thousand miles when they saw\nahead and downward the beginnings of what was either an ocean or a\ngreat sea. As they drew closer, they still could not see its further\nshore.\n\n\"I don't remember this from before, do you?\" Jon looked perplexed.\n\n\"Yes, I think this must be the one we saw part of from the north--that\nis, I assume it was north, as we were near the icecap. But I didn't\nrealize it was so....\"\n\n\"Hey, look down there! That proves I was right.\" Jon pointed\ntriumphantly toward his visiplate. \"See those high-water marks along\nthe shore? That means this moon is big enough to cause tides, same as\nLuna does to Terra.\"\n\n\"What good, really, are tides?\"\n\n\"Why,\" superciliously, \"they're one of the most useful things God has\ngiven man. They ... they....\" Jon stopped, flushed, then laughed.\n\"Darned if I know what they're good for. Of course, if they're high\nenough, men can make tide-motors and produce power, but now that we've\ngot atomics, we don't need those.\"\n\n\"I suppose we should record them, though.\" Jak was tactful enough not\nto laugh.\n\n\"Yes, write it down.\"\n\nThey were over an hour passing above this ocean, and had begun to\nwonder if it was greater in extent than Terra's Pacific. But finally\nthey made out in the distance the dim blueness of the farther shore.\n\n\"That's some ocean all right. Shows there's lots of water here on Two.\"\n\n\"With those heavy rains there'd almost have to be. This'll be of\nspecial interest to colonists--means not only plenty of water, but if\nthat stream was any example, there'll be lots of fish down there to\nstart a big food industry later.\"\n\nAbout two hundred miles past the eastern shore of the ocean, they saw\nthe blue of mountains in the decreasing distance. Soon Jon had to rise\nhigher and higher to clear them safely. Some of the individual peaks\nseemed to be nearly five miles high, and one or two of them, almost at\nthe range of visibility, the boys estimated to be even taller.\n\n\"Probably lots of metals here,\" Jon commented. \"I'll swing back and\nover them again, and let 'Annie' get to work.\"\n\n\"Yes, this list says to report on metallic ores. Say, doesn't it seem\nfunny to you that there are no people on a world as capable as this of\nsupporting life? Wonder why?\"\n\n\"No telling. Pop says lots of Earthlike planets don't have any\ninhabitants capable of any sort of civilization. But that means more\nready-made worlds for Terrans to colonize.\"\n\nJon made their ship circle above the mountains while the boys took\nreadings with the spectro-analyzer. Then they started on again. After\nalmost another hour, when they were over one of the few desert places\nthey had seen, Jon suddenly leaned forward with a little intake of\nbreath that his brother noticed.\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"Not sure. But listen to 'Annie' click. From the reading, I think\nthere must be some of that metal Pop was so positive about, down there\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"The stuff for a new fuel?\"\n\n\"Yes. We don't know it'd be any good as fuel, but its atomic weight\nseems to be so high Pop was all excited when the spectrogram of this\nsun showed it. He said he felt sure we'd find it on at least one of\nthese planets.\"\n\n\"It'll take a lot of time to locate it exactly, won't it?\"\n\n\"Not too much, with the new gadgets they have for locating metal ores.\"\nJon tried not to sound impatient with his brother's ignorance. \"We've\ngot one that lets us cruise around in the air and spot it fairly close,\nthen land and find the exact place quite easily.\"\n\n\"What sort of gadget?\"\n\nJon shrugged. \"Don't know exactly how they work, but I can use one.\nSomething like a spectroscope that works without first having to heat\nthe metals into gas. Plus something like those old Geiger counters they\nused to trace radioactives. Plus some other ideas the technies put\ninto them. It tells about them in one of our reelbooks there. You go\nget ours--I think it's in Bin 14, in the storeroom. Looks like a small\nblack suitcase with carrying straps. Meanwhile, I'll get ready to set\nus down.\"\n\n\"I'll hurry so's to be back to read the routine for you.\"\n\nWhile his brother was gone, Jon activated the bow retarders--after\nsnapping off the stern tubes. Then he sent the ship into a curve that\nwould bring them back nearer the place where he wanted to land. But\nonly part of his mind was doing that--the rest was wondering why\nthere had to be so much fuss and detail in landing and taking-off with\na ship. Why couldn't it be fixed so one man could navigate and pilot\nwithout all this bother? It ought not to be too difficult....\n\nJak was soon back with the recorder, and Jon showed him how to read\nit. Soon they located what seemed to be the center of that strange\ndisturbance, and with Jak's help, Jon set the ship down on the sand,\nfairly close to where they thought that hoped-for metal or its ore\nmight be found.\n\nWhen the two boys went into the living room, they told their mother\nwhat they had landed for, and that they were going out to look for the\nsource of this excitement.\n\n\"Is it really necessary?\" she asked anxiously. \"Mr. C. didn't say\nanything to me about any such thing. Haven't we got fuel enough to get\nhome on?\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom,\" Jon hastened to explain. \"But Pop thought this new stuff\nwould be a lot more powerful than the fuel we're using. Said it ought\nto give us far greater cruising range with lots less storage space. If\nwe found something of the sort, it would be a great contribution to\nspace travel.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Jak added, \"and if we do find such a thing here, miners\nwill soon be flocking after it, and that'll mean _beaucoup_ credits for\nus.\"\n\n\"Well,\" doubtfully, \"I guess you know best. Your father seems to be\ngrowing better, and lets me feed him, even though he hasn't ever seemed\nto regain full consciousness. If you are sure this is what he'd do if\nawake, I suppose it is what you should do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Looks like a funny place for ore,\" Jon said as the two boys left the\nship and started at a fast pace in the direction \"Annie\" had pointed\nout as the center of activity. \"I'd have expected it to be in the\nmountains, not in a desert like this.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was wondering about that.\" The elder brother shook his head\nslowly. \"But you can tell there's something here. What is it we're\nreally looking for? Oh, I know it's metal or ore of some kind,\" he\nadded hurriedly as he saw Jon start a retort. \"What I mean is, is it\nore or natural nuggets, and is it radioactive, or what?\"\n\nJon grinned as he trotted along. \"Don't really know much more than you.\nI know how to detect it, and I'll know it if we find it. But to tell\nahead of time, I haven't the minnow of an idea.\"\n\nThey had actually gone less than a quarter of a mile when the heat of\nthe sun, reflected from the hot, white, desert sand, became almost\nunbearable. Finally Jak stopped, wiping the pouring perspiration from\nhis face and neck. \"We can't take much of this. Better go back and get\nour suits.\"\n\n\"Yes, guess you're right.\" Jon was also working his handkerchief\novertime. \"The refrigs in them will keep us cooler, even if they're\nharder to walk in.\"\n\n\"And the suit-goggles will protect us better from the actinic rays\nof this sun,\" Jak said. \"We're so close--only sixty-five or seventy\nmillions, you said?--that the solar rays are lots stronger than those\nwe get back on Terra, even in the deserts.\"\n\n\"Sure, those jungle trees protected us before, so we didn't notice\nthem.\"\n\nTheir mother heard them as they returned and came to see what the\ntrouble was. When they explained, as they were putting on their suits,\nshe again warned them to be careful.\n\nThen she added, somewhat hastily, \"It's just a mother's instinct\nto keep warning her children to be careful. I know you boys always\nare--the fact that you came back rather than take chances shows this.\nPlease don't feel badly that I keep nagging at you.\"\n\n\"Heck, Mom, we know you aren't nagging.\" Jon hugged her. \"If you ever\nquit warning us, that's when we'd really get worried.\"\n\nTheir suits on and the refrigerators working, the pair began retracing\ntheir steps. Jon led the way, since he was carrying the detector. They\nwent in a decreasing spiral to locate the center, then made a beeline\nfor that spot.\n\nBut after almost a mile the signal seemed to grow weaker, and they\nstopped for a conference.\n\n\"Must have passed it,\" Jon said over his suit-radio as his puzzled eyes\nstudied the meters on the finder.\n\n\"Try going back thirty or forty yards to the right, then back toward\nthe left,\" Jak suggested.\n\nSoon Jon shouted and started off in a new direction, but more slowly,\nand Jak ran quarteringly toward him.\n\nInside half a mile Jon lost the beam again, and once more they\nquartered to find it. In narrower and narrower circles they searched.\n\nSuddenly Jak stumbled and fell to the ground. As he started to rise,\nJon heard his excited yell coming through his earphones.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAt his brother's eager cry, Jon ran over toward where the older boy was\nstooping down, examining carefully something almost completely embedded\nin the sand. He saw Jak rise, take his shovel from the carrying straps\non his suit's back, and start uncovering whatever it was he had\nstumbled over.\n\nAs Jon came up, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.\n\"Why ... what ... that's a metal plate. What is it, Jak?\"\n\n\"Don't ... know ... yet,\" the elder panted as he worked even more\nfeverishly with his shovel. Jon quickly laid down the detector, which\nwas clicking excitedly, to unsling his own shovel and begin digging.\n\nIn a few moments they had completely bared the metal plate, and could\nnow see it was about ten by four feet, and hinged on one side.\n\n\"Looks like a trap door.\"\n\n\"Sure does. Lend a hand--let's see if we can open it.\"\n\nThe crack along the edge was not wide enough for the gloved fingers of\ntheir suits, so Jon inserted his shovel tip in the crack as a prize.\nJak did the same and after many attempts--for it was much heavier even\nthan they expected--they managed to lift the edge a bit.\n\n\"Can you hold it alone a sec?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"Try,\" Jon threw his whole weight on the end of the shovel handle,\nwhile Jak quickly found a small stone and wedged it in the opening.\nThen, with Jon moving his shovel farther and farther back along the\nedge, Jak pushed ever larger stones closely behind him, and they\nfinally managed to get the cover high enough so they were able to tip\nit back, but only after considerable straining and puffing.\n\n\"What do you suppose is down there?\" Jon hopped about, digging at the\nsand with his boot tip.\n\n\"Don't know, but it has sure been a long time since anyone used this.\"\nJak spoke slowly.\n\n\"How can you tell?\"\n\n\"Because of all the sand that's sifted in here, silly. You don't think\nthis is just a box of sand, do you? It could have been here thousands\nand thousands of years.\"\n\n\"You mean ... there were people living here then?\"\n\nThe elder boy shook his head. \"Maybe yes, maybe no. It could have been\nfolks who merely visited here. Well, what do we do now?\"\n\nJon picked up his shovel. \"You're the one that's silly now. We clear it\nout and look.\"\n\nFor some time the two made the sand fly, then Jak's shovel struck\nmetal, and feverishly the two concentrated on that spot. Another few\nminutes and they could see it was a large metal chest that almost\nfilled this covered, metal-lined pit. When they finally had the top of\nthe box completely exposed, they found its cover fastened with a simple\nhasp, which was quickly opened. Then they lifted this second lid.\n\nInside, the box was completely filled with thousands of small cubes of\nsome sort of glistening metal. Jak started to reach for one but Jon\nstruck his hand away.\n\n\"Listen to that detector--it has gone crazy,\" he yelled. \"That stuff's\ndeadly radioactive, I bet.\" He started to scramble out of the hole\nafter slamming down the lid. \"We get out of here, but fast. Then we\ntalk about it.\"\n\nJak had sense enough to heed his brother's warning, and lost no time in\nfollowing. Some little distance away, the two stopped to debate what\nthey were to do.\n\n\"You know what I think?\" Jon's eyes gleamed. \"I think this was a fuel\ncache left by people who used to make trips around the galaxy, and not\nsomething left by people who once lived here.\"\n\n\"You're nuts. Who--and when--and why didn't they ever come to Terra, if\nthey had space-flight? If they came this close, wouldn't they have gone\nthere, too?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily--space is so big and Sol is relatively small, you\nknow. But maybe they did get to Earth, at that.\" Jon grew more\nthoughtful. \"Remember our reading about all the strange things people\nreported seeing, hundreds....\"\n\n\"You mean those old 'flying saucer' reports a couple of centuries ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, them. And even before that, there'd been reports of strange\nairships and things. Why, there was one--that's almost four hundred\nyears ago--of a Dutch sea captain who saw something in the air above\nthe Indi Ocean and reported it in his log. Even made a sketch of it,\nthat was almost exactly like those made later by people who said they'd\nseen it.\"\n\n\"_Mmmm_,\" Jak had been thinking back, \"then maybe the Bible story of\nEzekiel's 'wheel within a wheel' he saw in the air, was one?\"\n\n\"Sure. Earth people for centuries have seen all sorts of unknown\nthings.\"\n\n\"Then maybe your idea isn't so wild, after all.\"\n\n\"The question now is,\" Jon ignored the apology, \"how do we take some\nof this stuff back to the ship, and how do we test it to see if it's\nfuel--or don't we?\"\n\n\"That's more your line than mine. What do you suggest?\"\n\nJon thought seriously for several minutes, then brightened. \"You stay\nhere so I can see where I'm going, and I'll go get the ship and bring\nit here. Then we'll try one of those cubes in the generator.\"\n\n\"You ... you think it's safe?\"\n\n\"What would get you, out here in this desert?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that, and you know it. I meant, do you think it's safe\nto try this stuff that way?\"\n\n\"Oh, that? Sure.\" Jon threw down the extra things he was carrying, and\nstarted away at a trot.\n\nWhen he reached the ship and was inside the airlocks, he called to his\nmother as he was sitting down at the controls.\n\n\"What's the matter, Jon?\" she asked as she came in and saw him working\nat the controls. \"And where's Jak?\"\n\n\"We found something out there too heavy to carry, and Jak's watching it\nwhile I bring up the ship. Strap down.\"\n\nShe sank into the co-pilot's seat and fastened the broad belt about her\neven as Jon was activating the generator and tubes. Raggedly, since he\nwas trying to handle the controls and read the directions at the same\ntime--it simply didn't occur to him to ask his mother to read them to\nhim--the boy finally got the ship into the air.\n\n\"What is it you've found?\" His mother could contain her curiosity no\nlonger.\n\n\"Something we think is that new fuel Pop talked about, but it's\nradioactive and we didn't dare try to carry it without special\nequipment,\" he told her absently as the ship began lowering.\n\nHe maneuvered it to a bumpy landing close to his brother, whom they\ncould now see through the port, excitedly waving his arms at them. \"We\nthink it's something some other people left here as a cache, a long,\nlong time ago,\" Jon explained as he put his controls in neutral, his\nvoice an excited squeak.\n\n\"Some other Earth people?\" she asked incredulously. \"You mean we aren't\nthe first ones here, after all?\"\n\n\"No, we don't think it was Terrans,\" he said as he unstrapped. But\nbefore he could get out of the seat, they heard the lockdoor mechanisms\nworking, and knew Jak was coming inboard, so the two stayed in the\ncontrol room. Jon answered his mother's anxious questions as best he\ncould.\n\nJak soon came running in and the two boys held a quick council, almost\nignoring their mother in the excitement of trying to figure a safe way\nof bringing some of the fuel-stuff aboard and trying it out.\n\nBut at last she made herself heard. \"I think you should wait and let\nMr. C. decide about this,\" she said with determination.\n\n\"How is he--awake?\"\n\n\"About the same--still unconscious.\"\n\n\"Then don't you see, Mom, that there's no telling when he'll wake up,\nand we don't want to wait that long?\"\n\n\"I still say you mustn't take the chance of blowing us all to Kingdom\nCome before you can have his advice and help in deciding what to do\nwith that new, untried and dangerous metal,\" she declared so firmly\nthat they could not ignore her. \"Now you listen to your mother. This is\nonce when I'm setting my foot down. I will _not_ let you do it!\"\n\nNor could their pleas move her.\n\n\"All right, Mother,\" Jak finally conceded defeat with--if the truth\nmust be told--an inner sense of relief. He, too, had been more than a\nlittle afraid of that untried stuff. But Jon had seemed so sure, while\nhe knew very little about it. \"We'll leave it here while we go set our\nmarkers on the other planets.\"\n\n\"Unless Pop wakes up before we're finished here,\" Jon added sullenly,\nsomewhat humiliated because he felt his mother was treating him like a\nlittle boy instead of the man and scientist he now considered himself\nto be. \"When he does, though, you'll see he'll say we should have tried\nit.\"\n\nHis mother, understanding well how he felt, but still worried over the\npossibilities for danger her anxious mind insisted on painting, patted\nhis shoulder. \"In that case, Son,\" she said softly, \"I'll apologize.\"\n\n\"We'd better go out and shut that trap door and mark the place some way\nbefore we leave.\" Jak tried to lighten the tension.\n\n\"I'll take measurements of where we are, and that'll do just as well.\"\nJon's voice still held that injured tone.\n\nMrs. Carver kept her voice level, but her eyes caught and held those\nof her younger son. \"I'm sorry if I seem too stubborn about this,\nJon; but I just don't like the idea of you boys trying to handle,\nalone, something you don't know anything about, especially since you\nyourselves admit that it's highly dangerous.\"\n\nJon's petulance slowly disappeared, and finally he grinned and kissed\nher. \"You're right, as always, Mom. I'm getting too big for my\ncoveralls. I'll calculate courses to One, and to and around the sun,\nand we'll let this ride until Pop wakes up.\"\n\nWhile Jak and Mrs. Carver busied themselves at other tasks, Jon sweated\nover the complicated math of the new courses. He knew how important\nthis was, especially the plan he had in mind for placing the marker\nin its orbit about the sun. He knew their very lives depended on the\ncorrectness of his calculations. So he did them slowly, carefully, and\nchecked them closely to make sure he had done them right and made no\nmistakes.\n\nBut when he was finished, he put the sheets of calculations in a\ndrawer, took more paper and figured the courses over a second time.\nThat solution he also put in the drawer, and figured it the third time,\nwithout consulting what he had done before.\n\nWhen he had completed this third computation he took out the other two\nsets and compared the three. All came out exactly the same ... and he\ngasped in relief and sank back, trembling with thankfulness, in the\npilot's seat. They must be right.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile Mrs. Carver and her sons were eating lunch they heard a weak call\nfrom the bunkroom, and ran in to find their father fully awake. He\nseemed surprised at his condition, but Jak explained swiftly what had\nhappened, and Jon told briefly what they had done and were planning to\ndo next.\n\n\"That's good; that's very good,\" he said drowsily, and before Jon could\nsay anything about finding that new metal, his father had again sunk\ninto sleep--or unconsciousness; not even Jak could tell which.\n\n\"Well,\" Jon tried to be brave about his disappointment, \"I guess we'll\njust have to go ahead. But isn't it swell that Pop woke up fully?\"\n\n\"It certainly is.\" Mrs. Carver had tears of joy in her eyes. \"Now we\nknow he'll soon be all right.\"\n\nThe trip to Planet One--\"Tad\"--was neither long nor eventful, once they\ngot started. They found, as expected, that the small world--smaller\nthan Sol's Mercury--was so close to the sun that it was fearfully hot,\neven on the equator, or \"intermediate\" zone.\n\nDespite the refrigerators on the ship, it was becoming hot inside,\nand all stripped as far as decency allowed. The planet had no\nreal atmosphere, but many of the metals--indeed, the very rocks,\nthemselves--were so largely molten, especially on the eternally\nsunward side, that there was a fog of gasses about the surface. These\ngaseous emanations were in a state of motion much like that of Earthly\ncyclones, constantly swirling and blowing with terrific velocity.\n\nThe boys carefully examined their spectro-analyzer, but \"Annie\" showed\nnone of that strange fuel-metal they were so keen to locate in its\nnatural state. \"Maybe we found all there is here,\" Jak suggested.\n\n\"Perhaps, but somehow I can't feel that way.\" Jon's voice was worried.\n\"I must have slipped somewhere. Don't see how just one boxful could\nhave shown up so clearly from as many light years away as we first\ndiscovered it.\"\n\nDespite the conditions the young planet mappers found here on One, the\nColonial law required that a sending beacon be set up on ALL planets,\nor else in an orbit about them. They decided to place theirs on top of\none of the highest of the small mountains that comprised the twilight\nzone.\n\nJon made up the tape for this planet's signal-marker, while Jak brought\nit from the storeroom. When the tape was installed and running, the\nsender was placed in the lock between the inner and outer doors, and\nthe boys returned to the control room.\n\nJon directed the ship toward the range of mountains and when he neared\nthem Jak--from his co-pilot's seat--worked the remote controls and the\nouter lockdoor swung open. Then he activated the \"distant hands\"--the\nhandling mechanism that was an integral part of the airlock's\nequipment, for handling materials into and out of the ship.\n\nWatching through his special visiplate--really a sort of two-way\ntelevision--Jak made the grips pick up the signal-sender box, ready to\ndeposit it on the hard, hot ground outside when Jon would swoop down\nover the pre-selected mountaintop.\n\n\"Move it outside,\" Jon called, and Jak did so. \"Set it down.\" Jon\nyelled, and as soon as he was sure Jak had placed the sender solidly,\nsent the space-yacht rising higher and away from the planet. Then Jak\nclosed the outer door; turned in his co-pilot's seat, and tuned in\ntheir receiver. Soon they caught the message and knew everything was\njetting fair.\n\n\"Nice going, Owl,\" Jon applauded.\n\n\"Aw, you're just saying that because it's true,\" Jak grunted, and Jon\nturned his attention once more to his controls and the new course he\nhad plotted for their swing around the sun of this system, now less\nthan thirty million miles away.\n\n\"How close d'you go?\" Jak was more interested than fearful, having\nconfidence in his brother's skill.\n\n\"We have to follow a course so that when the sender is dumped, it will\ntake up a closed orbit--the more nearly circular the better--around the\nsun. Also, we'll have to have speed enough so we won't get fried to a\ncrisp at the near-point, which figures to be about ten million miles.\"\n\n\"Isn't that pretty close?\" their mother, who had slipped into the\ncontrol room quietly just after Jak had placed the sender, tried not to\nsound too frightened.\n\n\"Relax, Mother, the kid knows what he's doing,\" Jak tried to calm her.\n\n\"I've figured this three times, Mom,\" Jon said earnestly. \"Got the same\nanswer each time, so I _know_ we can do it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" still doubtfully, \"I guess you do know what you are doing,\nbut that seems awfully close.\" She struggled with herself and finally\nmanaged a weak smile. \"I promised to let you boys make the decisions.\nI'll go lie down in my bunk so I won't know what's happening until it's\nall over.\"\n\n\"You do that, Mother. I'm not worrying. Jon really knows his stuff,\"\nJak assured her brightly. But as soon as she had left the control room,\nhe turned worried eyes to his brother. \"I ... I hope you actually do,\nChubby.\" His voice quavered a bit.\n\nJon grinned mockingly. \"There's one sure thing. If I'm wrong, we'll\nnever know it. But I've studied this a lot since I knew it was up to\nme. I know the technique and, as I said before, I've computed our\ncourse three times and come up with the same figures each time. And we\nhave to set it as close as possible. Now, either hit your bunk or set\nyour seat to recline. We're up to better than two G's already, and I'm\nbuilding to five.\"\n\n\"Yes, I feel us getting heavier. I'll stay with you.\" Jak made sure his\nstraps were in place, then tilted his seat.\n\nJon cranked his own to recline, the control panel automatically\nslanting to keep it in the same relative position. His arms were\nresting on movable slides, and the controls he would have to manipulate\non this dangerous orbit were all beneath his hands and fingers.\n\nCloser and closer they drove to the sun with ever mounting speed.\nTheir gallant little ship's refrigerators were full on; all shutters\nin place. Their only view of the outside was through one visiplate\nwhose aperture was closed until only a tiny slit was open. But it was\nenough, although Jon was forced to keep building up layer after layer\nof protective, colored plastic to make the intense, blinding light of\nthe swiftly approaching sun bearable.\n\nClearly visible now were the tremendous streamers of matter the sun was\nthrowing up as prominences. Jon was able to see huge sunspots occurring\nhere and there about the surface of that mighty furnace--tremendous\ncyclonic storms of atomic disintegration. So interested was he in this\nfirst close view of a sun that he almost forgot the reason for this\ndangerous trip.\n\nAlmost--but not quite, for his mind was well-trained to remember the\nthings that had to be recalled, young as he was. So his eyes glanced\noften at the distance gauge. Soon he yelled at Jak, \"Get ready to throw\nout the sender.\"\n\nJak struggled to place his hands on the controls, a thing he had not\nhad the foresight to do before Jon started building up that tremendous\nacceleration. His muscles strained. Sweat broke out on him even worse\nthan that the heat from the sun brought. His breathing became gasps.\nThere seemed to be a constricting band about his chest. His eyes felt\nas though the balls were being pushed down into his head. He just\ncouldn't possibly move a muscle under this terrible pressure.\n\nStill he exerted every force of will and of muscle. Slowly, painfully,\nhe stretched out his fingertips a fraction of an inch. He dug them into\nthe fabric of the arm rest and pulled the palm of his hand along. Then\nhe forced the rest of his arm to follow his fingers and hand. Over and\nover, straining to do what had to be done. Then victory at last--his\nhand and arm were on the sliding arms. Now it was easier, and soon his\nfingers were on the controls.\n\n\"S-say when,\" he panted then.\n\n\"Open the outer door now ... we're almost there,\" Jon commanded,\nwatching his controls intently. \"We're going ... so fast ... won't\nhave ... much time.\"\n\n\"You're sure ... sender'll keep ... correct orbit?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Jon's voice was confident. \"If we don't dump ... exactly on\nzero ... it'll just change shape ... of orbit a little ... that's all.\"\n\n\"Door open,\" Jak reported a moment later.\n\n\"Lift sender, but don't eject yet.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nMore minutes while the heat increased, and even through that tiny\naperture and the covering shields, the blinding light was coming in\nso fiercely Jon was tempted to close it entirely. Then, with a snort\nof disgust at his stupidity, he did close it--and breathed a sigh of\nrelief as that piercing beam died. He didn't need to see. There was no\nreason to look. Even if there was, it was too late now to do anything\nabout it. If his calculations were correct, the ship would get away\nsafely. If his figures were wrong ... he shuddered. Well, they'd never\nknow it, that was for sure.\n\nHe made himself forget that dire possibility and kept his eyes glued to\nhis indicators.\n\n\"Almost there.\"\n\n\"Ready.\" Jak tensed his hand and fingers above the controls. He hoped\nhe could do it when the time came. But this awful heat ... this\nhorrible acceleration pressure....\n\n\"Drop it!\" Jon yelled suddenly.\n\nJak tensed hand and fingers and tried to depress the button. It seemed\nhe couldn't move. He gritted his teeth, and again called upon his inner\nstrength, his will. From that hidden depth he found that extra measure\nof energy necessary to curve his fingertip downward.\n\nHis eyes, peering into the shielded intercom visiplate, saw those\ndistant hands--the servo-mechanism in the lock--swing the box out\nthrough the opened doorway. When he could no longer see it, because of\nthe angle at which his visiplate was set, he touched and depressed the\nsecond button. Now, if the mechanism was still functioning in spite of\nthat terrific heat, its arms were opening and the box slipping away.\n\nHe withdrew the handling arms, and as they came into sight again he\nsaw with satisfaction that they were empty. He locked them into their\ncradle, then closed the outer lockdoor.\n\n\"Done,\" he reported thankfully ... and let himself go. Unconsciousness\nclaimed him at once. Why suffer, had been his thought, when he could so\neasily sleep until this intolerable pressure was gone.\n\nSo quickly did he slip away he did not realize that Jon, too, after a\nfinal quick glance at his board, and knowing that everything necessary\nhad been done, had also relaxed into unconsciousness. Did not know, or\ncare, that their ship was now speeding around and away from the sun.\nDid not realize that all four of the Carvers were now unconscious.\n\nBut their blackout did not last too long. In a few hours, during which\nthe auto-pilot took them smoothly and accurately away from that titanic\nfurnace, safety distance was attained and the frightful acceleration\nbegan to ease.\n\nBy the time they were traveling at a little less than two gravities,\nJon stirred. His memory cells began functioning once more, and slowly\nhe awakened. As soon as he realized where he was, and why, he glanced\nat his various telltales.\n\n\"We made it!\" he yelled triumphantly. Then, as he heard no reply from\nhis brother, he quickly raised his seat to upright, and turned to look\nat Jak. The latter was still lying down, his face white and strained.\n\nQuickly, anxiously, Jon released himself and sprang across to his\nbrother's side. He rubbed Jak's wrists and temples. Soon the flush of\nreturning blood showed, and the elder sighed and opened his eyes.\n\n\"We made it!\" Jon cried again as he pushed Jak's seat into erect.\n\"Everything went off shark-y.\"\n\nJak struggled into full consciousness, then began loosening his straps.\n\"Mother and Father?\" he exclaimed. \"Did they come through all right?\"\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAt Jak's question, Jon started. \"Haven't looked yet. Let's go see.\"\n\nThe two raced into the living room and into their parents' bunkroom.\nMrs. Carver was just opening her eyes, and seeing the boys' anxious\nlooks, struggled to sit up. They helped her, and Jak turned quickly to\nlook at his father. To his relief, the latter's pulse was no weaker,\nand his breathing was regular.\n\n\"We got through all safely,\" Jon assured his mother, and she threw her\narms about him and broke into tears. \"Hey, no need of crying now; it's\nall over.\"\n\n\"I know.\" She reached down for a corner of her apron and wiped her\neyes. \"Just relief, I guess. Is Mr. C. all right?\" she asked Jak.\n\n\"Didn't seem to hurt him a bit.\"\n\nIndeed, just then there was a mutter from Mr. Carver's lips, and his\neyelids fluttered open.\n\nThe three gathered closely beside him, and were tremendously heartened\nat the look of sane awareness in his eyes.\n\n\"Hullo?\" as though surprised to find himself in bed and the others\ngathered about him. \"Did I oversleep?\"\n\nJak reached out and took his father's hand. \"No, Father. You've been a\nlittle ill and unconscious, that's all. But you're almost well now. A\nbit more rest and you'll be all OK.\"\n\nThe invalid looked surprised, then doubtfully at his wife, who quickly\nstooped and kissed him. \"Jak's right, Mr. C. You get some more sleep so\nyou'll get strong quicker.\"\n\nDutifully he closed his eyes and immediately his regular breathing told\nthe three he was asleep once more.\n\nQuietly Jak drew the others out of the bunkroom and closed the door.\nThen his eyes shone and he grabbed his mother and danced her about,\nwhile Jon \"tried to get into the act.\"\n\n\"He's almost well; he's almost well!\" Jak chanted.\n\nJon yelled in honest praise. \"You did a grand job, Owl.\" But his voice\nbroke into a boyish treble with the excitement.\n\nAfter several minutes of jubilation, Jon went back into the control\nroom and began figuring their course to Planet Three.\n\nHe turned on the receiver and pointed the directional antenna. Soon the\nbroadcast of their solar signal came in. This one about the sun had\nmost worried him, but he could read it clearly: \"This solar system was\nfirst discovered and charted by Tad Carver of Terra, on fourteenth\nJanuary, 2136. It has been named 'Carveria,' and the five planets and\nseven satellites are being charted and named. Details will be filed\nwith the Terran Colonial Board.\"\n\nFinally Jon finished his astrogation, then went back into the living\nquarters. \"Ready to set course to Three, Folks. Strap down while I\nchange course.\"\n\n\"How long'll it take?\"\n\n\"Just under a couple of days at two G's.\"\n\n\"Ouch! Do we have to go that fast?\" Jak complained.\n\n\"You want to get there, don't you?\" Jon turned away indifferently,\nwhile Mrs. Carver smiled at Jak and shrugged.\n\nDuring the balance of that \"day\" Jon stayed in the control room. When\neither of the others looked in, he was studying intently. Right after\nbreakfast the next morning he put in a long session at the computer and\nhis drawing board, then after lunch went into the storeroom. After a\nwhile he came out with his arms filled with wires, cells, relays and\nother oddments, which he carried into the control room.\n\nThe others, busy with their own work and chores, paid no special\nattention to what Jon was doing. Seeing him busy like this had become\nso commonplace they seldom bothered even asking what he was doing when\nhe did not volunteer the information.\n\nBut as they approached Planet Three early the following morning, under\nnegative acceleration, all three were in the control room, peering\nintently into the visiplates.\n\nWhat would they find there? Would there be people of some sort? Cities?\nJungles, deserts, ice fields?\n\nAll three minds were busy with such conjectures as they came closer in.\nTheir instruments had already told them Three possessed an atmosphere\ncontaining water vapor, so they knew it could not be entirely\nuntenable, unless the air contained poisonous gases. But what real\nconditions they would discover there remained to be seen.\n\nThey had already found, charted and photographed the two small moons\nthat circled the planet. One of these was fairly large--about nine\nhundred miles in diameter, and the other much smaller, about a hundred\nand fifty. Three, itself, was about five thousand miles through.\n\n\"There are clouds down there,\" Jak called suddenly as they approached\never nearer at constantly decreasing speed.\n\n\"Yes, I see them.\"\n\n\"And there's a big ocean!\" Their mother was equally excited.\n\n\"Three's only about thirty million farther away than Two, although on\nthe opposite side of the sun right now. So there shouldn't be too much\ndifference, except Three'll be colder,\" Jon stated. \"We're about a\nhundred miles up now, so I'm throwing us into a descending spiral.\"\n\n\"There's a big mountain range, and some of the peaks are snow-covered,\"\nJak called out a few minutes later.\n\n\"I see them. We're down to about twenty miles now, and I'm setting a\ncrisscross orbit for two or three revolutions to get a better view\nand take our first pictures. Mom, if you can tear yourself away, I'm\nhungry.\"\n\nShe stepped back from the screen, laughing. \"You're always hungry.\"\nThen she glanced at her wrist-chronom and gasped in dismay. \"No\nwonder--it's over an hour past lunchtime!\"\n\n\"We'll yell if anything especially interesting shows up,\" Jak called as\nshe was leaving.\n\nBy circling the planet from east to west they kept to the daylight\nside most of the time, and as the hours passed they were able to get\nmost of their pictures and reports on the geography, climate and other\nconditions. Their spectro-analyzer showed considerable mineral deposits\nin many of the places over which they passed.\n\nThey saw plenty of vegetation and Jon exclaimed about its coloring.\n\n\"Must be fall here,\" Jak explained. \"Unless, of course, those plants\ndon't contain chlorophyll, which I doubt.\"\n\nBut nowhere did they see anything that looked like the works of\nintelligent beings. Like Planet Two, there was no sign of people\nanywhere.\n\nWhen they became so tired they could no longer keep awake, Jon set the\nship into a higher, safer orbit, and they all went to bed. Their father\nhad awakened only once during the day, and then only for a few minutes,\nnor had his wife allowed him to talk, greatly as the boys, especially,\ndesired it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter breakfast the next morning Jon maneuvered the ship down closer\nto the surface and they completed exploring the planet, taking their\npictures and recordings. Jak made tests and reported the atmosphere not\npoisonous, although so scant they would have to wear suits most of the\ntime when outdoors.\n\n\"It's lots better than Mars, but not near as dense as Terra or Two back\nthere,\" he told Jon. \"Temp's below freezing, but I imagine it'll get\nwarmer when the sun's nearer noon here.\"\n\n\"Humans can adapt themselves to living here, then.\" Jon's voice was\njoyful. \"They've already colonized planets worse than this, as far as\ntemperature and air are concerned.\"\n\n\"Yes, the human animal seems to be marvelously adaptable to almost any\nconditions not actually poisonous,\" Jak said admiringly. \"There's even\na colony of people from the High Andes of Souamer living on Mars now,\nwithout domes.\"\n\n\"They could transport those Andean Indians to Mars direct because they\nwere used to living in the rarefied atmosphere of the high mountains,\neh?\"\n\n\"That's right. Those Indians would have suffocated at sea level back on\nTerra. Indeed, they seldom went down the mountains below ten thousand\nfeet because of the discomfort. On Mars, they had some difficulty at\nfirst, but I understand the second generation born there are perfectly\nat home.\"\n\nJon's blue eyes had been watching his detectors, even while his ears\nhad been listening to Jak's explanations. So far he had not discovered\nany of that strange fuel-metal--if it was fuel--they had found on Two.\nHe spoke of this now to his brother. \"Wonder if those people didn't\nleave any caches here on Three, or what?\"\n\n\"Maybe they didn't like cold weather.\" Jak grinned. \"More likely,\nthough, either we haven't come close enough to detect it, or else they\nmay only have made a cache on one planet in a system.\"\n\n\"That's probably it. I've been watching for it all the way in, and\n'Annie' didn't chirp at all. Well, do we land and see what the joint is\nlike?\"\n\n\"Don't know about you, Chubby, but I sure want to. How about closer to\nthe equator? Ought to be warmer there, and more comfortable. I want to\nstudy that plant life.\"\n\n\"OK by me--if you don't try to load the boat with your specimens.\" Jon\nlaughed, and Jak joined in sheepishly.\n\n\"I promise not to go hog-wild like I did last time.\"\n\n\"Going to land, Mom. Strap down,\" Jon called into the intercom.\n\nJak reached for the sheet of landing instructions, but Jon shook his\nhead. \"Don't think we'll need those. Tighten your belt, here we go.\"\n\n\"Hey, what gives?\" Jak's eyes widened as he saw his brother throw in\none switch and then take his hands off the controls, although his eyes\nwere alertly watching his many dials and lights, and his body was\ntensely ready for emergencies.\n\nJon did not answer, and Jak watched in the plate as the ground below\nappeared to rush closer each second. It almost seemed to him they were\nnot slowing as fast as was usual on landings, but he was not unduly\nworried--he trusted Jon to know what he was doing ... even if he didn't!\n\nBut apparently Jon was not satisfied--for when the ship was only a few\nhundred yards above ground, he suddenly worked frantically at his\ncontrols, and the nose of the little yacht came up sharply and she\nzoomed into the upper air with a push from her stern tubes.\n\nThirty-some miles up, Jon set the ship into a circular orbit, then got\nout of his pilot's seat and began tinkering with some of the controls.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Jak asked. \"How come you went down without following\nthe manual, and then came up again?\"\n\nBut Jon was tight-lipped and uncommunicative. Their mother's voice came\nover the intercom, asking why they had not landed, and Jon answered her\nquestion.\n\n\"Just a slight miscalculation of height, Mom, so I came up to try\nagain,\" he answered. \"Stay strapped down--I'll be going down again in a\nminute.\"\n\nSoon he was back in his seat, scanning his various instruments, then\nagain Jak saw him throw that one switch. Once more the little ship\nbegan settling toward the ground beneath, without any handling of the\ncontrols.\n\nThis time the landing was smooth, soft and even. Still without any\nmove by Jon, Jak could feel the various generators and engines stop,\nthe landing props go down, and finally the board show a clear green\n\"neutral\" condition.\n\n\"How ... how come?\" Jak gasped, and this time Jon chose to answer.\n\n\"Just rigged up a series of photo-electric cells and relays, so\nnow all I have to do is throw one switch and it takes care of all\nthe little details of landing, just as this other one does of\ntake-offs.\" Jon tried to make it sound like an offhand comment. \"My\nheight-to-descent-speed ratio was off a bit, and that was what I had to\nfix.\"\n\n\"But ... but that's something brand new, isn't it? I never heard of\nsuch a thing before.\" Jak still could hardly believe what he had just\nwitnessed.\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't so much a much.\" Jon looked down as he guessed that his\nbrother would soon realize what a remarkable thing he had done.\n\n\"Boy, you're good!\" Jak applauded, and as their mother came into the\ncontrol room, he almost shouted, \"Jon's gone and....\"\n\n\"Landed so we could go out a bit and make a fuller report in our log,\"\nJon cut in sharply, with a warning look at his senior. \"How's Pop?\"\n\n\"Been moving about some, although he hasn't wakened fully yet today.\nHis breathing is much easier. He still makes noises--but then, he\nalways did sort of snore when he slept.\"\n\nThe boys went with her into the bunkroom to look at their father before\nthey started outside. There was a flush of color on his skin, although\nit was paler than its usual state. When Jak examined the side of his\npatient's head he could see that it was practically healed. Also, the\nbroken leg seemed in fine shape, as seen through the clear plastic of\nthe cast.\n\n\"He'll be waking up for good any day now, I'm sure,\" he said thankfully.\n\n\"Gosh, I hope so,\" Jon said. \"I feel like a fish out of water without\nmy Pop.\"\n\n\"You seem to be doing fine, anyway,\" his mother cheered him. \"And so\nis Jak,\" she hastened to add, fearful her elder son might think her\nprejudiced.\n\nThe boys went out to get ready for their outside trip.\n\n\"What's the big idea, not letting me tell Mother about your new dinkus\nfor landings and take-offs?\" Jak railed.\n\n\"Aw, she wouldn't understand it, and it'd worry her for fear it\nwouldn't work.\" Jon was clearly uncomfortable about the praise he could\nnot help seeing in his brother's eyes. \"I'll tell Pop, when he wakes\nup. Come on, I'll race you into our suits.\"\n\nThe boys donned their spacesuits, and examined each other to make sure\nthey were \"tight.\" They saw to it that their guns and bandoliers were\nfully loaded; that they had with them what tools and other equipment\nthey felt might be needed. Then they opened the lockdoors and went\noutside.\n\nThey started off in a predetermined direction, having made plans to go\nabout five miles. Then they would swing in a circle around the ship. If\nthey saw anything they thought exceptionally interesting, they would\nmake short side trips, and if necessary, complete their circle on\nanother day. In any event, they had promised their mother to be back by\ndark.\n\nThe first leg of their journey was completed without any excitement,\nalthough Jak was continually finding new plants he wanted to collect\nfor future study.\n\n\"Nix, Owl, not this trip,\" Jon kept protesting. \"You promised,\nremember?\"\n\n\"Oh, all right, killjoy. But there's so much here I want to find out\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yes, so much you couldn't even make a dent in it in a lifetime. Want\nus to leave you behind to do it?\"\n\n\"You just try that, and I'll knock your teeth loose.\"\n\n\"You and what platoon of space marines?\" Jon jeered good-naturedly,\nknowing that with his greater size and strength Jak could not make good\nhis threat--even if he had really wanted to.\n\nBickering in more or less friendly fashion, they covered their first\nfive miles, then turned to the left and started circling. About a mile\nof this and they entered a fairly large wood. The trees here were so\nstrange the boys looked about them with a growing excitement.\n\nUnconsciously, they drew closer together, and finally Jon voiced what\nwas in both their minds.\n\n\"I'm beginning to get scared, Jak. Ought we to keep trying to go this\nway?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" slowly. \"I'm getting a feeling there's something here\nthat seems to be unfriendly--perhaps dangerous. But there isn't a thing\nwe can see--not even animal life.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's only because this forest is so unlike either those on Terra\nor the ones on Two.\" But Jon gripped his rifle more tightly, and his\nthumb unlocked the safety catch.\n\nThe two boys finally came to a dead halt in a small clearing perhaps a\nhundred feet in diameter, and examined more closely the few trees and\nbushes about them. The ground on which they were now standing was bare\nand sandy, although beneath the trees it had been more like black loam.\n\n\"This sand must be why there's practically no vegetation here,\" Jak\nsaid. He dug into the ground a bit, and found it to be sand as deep as\nhe went.\n\nRising, he looked even more closely at the trees about the edge of the\nclearing.\n\nNot one of them was the straight, slim type with which they were\nfamiliar. These were ungainly and appeared stunted, although many were\nactually close to thirty feet tall. Even so, they looked too large\nin diameter for their height. None of them had more than five or six\ntwigless, leafless limbs, and those were almost as large in diameter\nas the trunks from which they grew. These branches twisted and curved,\nalthough in most cases the curve was upward, so that the leafless limbs\noften ended at a higher point than the main trunk of the tree.\n\nSuddenly Jak began laughing--but with a high-pitched, mirthless\nlaughter. As Jon looked at him in surprise, the elder tried to calm\nhimself.\n\n\"I know what makes them look so scary,\" he finally said between gasps.\n\"It's that weird look. But remember those pictures we've seen of the\nZona and Newmex deserts in Noramer, back home? Remember the Josha trees\ngrowing there? They're as alien-looking as anything on Terra, and these\nlook something like them.\"\n\nJon, too, began grinning as remembrance came. \"'Most let ourselves get\nscared over nothing, didn't we? Come on, let's travel.\" And he started\nforward.\n\nYet the strangeness persisted, and before the boys had passed through\nthe fringe of those tortured trees on the other side of that wood they\nstarted to get that queazy feeling again, in spite of their realization\nof what caused it. They began going more slowly, cautiously; ready for\na quick turn and run, yet both inwardly hating themselves for the fear,\nand each determined not to let the other know he was afraid.\n\nBut it was with a distinct sense of relief that they saw the end of\nthat forest ahead of them. Unconsciously they hurried their steps until\nthey were almost trotting.\n\nFor the balance of their trip Jon was strangely acquiescent as Jak\nbecame more and more engrossed in the strange plant life of this world\nThree. He knew that this was Jak's dish, and he was perfectly willing\nto defer to the elder's knowledge and desire to learn. His main concern\nwas to keep his brother from overloading himself with specimens, or\nfrom loitering too much.\n\nJak had been especially studying the soil here, Jon noticed, and\nfinally he asked about it. \"Notice one peculiar thing about this\nplanet?\"\n\n\"What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"The total absence, as far as we've seen, of any sort or type of\nprotoplasmic life,\" Jak reported.\n\n\"Hey, that's right, though I hadn't thought of it before. Our\nexamination from the air, I remember now, showed no animals, birds or\npeople. Plenty of vegetation, though.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has everything in that line. I wonder, though....\" He paused,\nand he grew thoughtful.\n\n\"Wonder what?\"\n\n\"How those plants can grow, without any worms or ants or anything\nto loosen and irrigate the soil, and no animals or birds to make\nfertilizers, or bees or butterflies or anything to carry pollen?\"\n\nJon shrugged. \"Wouldn't have the foggiest. That's your line, not mine.\nBut they must do it some way--there's sure lots of plant life here.\"\n\nBut Jak was still shaking his head in puzzlement as they finally\nreturned to the ship.\n\nIt was quite dark outside when the boys went into the control room\nafter dinner. Jon went over to the window-ports, while Jak began\nworking with his plant specimens.\n\n\"Jak, come here,\" Jon called after a moment or two. The elder, prompted\nby the curious urgency in his brother's voice, left his specimens and\nran to the other's side.\n\n\"What're those things?\"\n\nJak stared through the port in amazement. Outside, drifting across the\nclearing, were nearly a dozen large, spherical things like ghostly\nwhite balloons. They must have been almost a yard in diameter, and by\nstraining their eyes the boys could see tentacles or tendrils of some\nsort depending from the bottom surfaces.\n\n\"Gosh, never saw anything like those. Let's go out and see what they\nare.\"\n\n\"Let's not and say we did,\" Jon retorted. \"I want to find out more\nabout them first.\" He went over to the control panel and switched on\nthe searchlight, as well as the pilot's visi-screen. Looking into the\nlatter, he was able to direct the light so it shone on a couple of the\nfloating balls.\n\nJak was studying the plants--for so he believed them to be--more\ncarefully, now that they were lighted. But after a moment he yelped\nexcitedly, \"Hey, they're deflating. Must be the light does it.\"\n\nJon was watching them in his screen. \"Yes, I see now. What causes it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Jak answered sadly and absently. \"But I sure want to\nknow. How's about covering me while I go out and see if I can get one?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe in your suit you'd be safe.\"\n\nOnce suited up, Jak went outside and across the short distance to where\nthe balls seems to be slightly closer together. He tried first one way\nand then another to catch one, but at his lightest touch they burst\nand deflated. After several unsuccessful attempts, though, he called\nexcitedly through his suit-sender.\n\n\"Jon, you read me?\"\n\n\"Coming through.\"\n\n\"I'm going to try fanning one toward the air-analyzer. I want to see if\nwe can get an idea of what's inside. I've got a screwy hunch.\"\n\n\"Right, I'll switch the light away from them, up into the air.\"\n\nCarefully Jak herded one of the globes near the ship, and was finally\nsuccessful in getting it close to the hull-vent of the air-analyzer.\nWhen it was almost touching the ship's side, he reached out and touched\nit, and it promptly broke.\n\n\"Get anything?\" he yelled.\n\n\"Yes, gas of some sort. Taking the reading now. It seems to be mostly\nnitrogen.\"\n\n\"Hah, that's it, then! I'm coming in.\"\n\nWhen Jak was back inside, Jon helped him remove his helmet, then\ndemanded curiously, \"What's it all about, Owl?\"\n\n\"I'm not positive, of course, but I bet those things take the place of\nbees for pollinating, and also furnish the fertilizer for the ground\nwhen they burst and their nitrogen gets into the soil some way.\"\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nLater that evening Jon Carver sat for nearly an hour, studying intently\nfrom one of his reelbooks, and the frown on his face grew deeper and\ndeeper.\n\nJak had been working over their father. He had given him a careful\nsponge bath, then fed him another intravenous dosage of the combined\nliquid protein, salt, sugar and glucose. Even though their mother had\nbeen able to spoon-feed her husband small amounts of food each day, the\nyoung hoped-to-be doctor felt additional nourishment was necessary.\n\nWhen he finished his task and started to seek a comfortable seat in the\nliving quarters of the space yacht, to relax with a little reading of\nhis own, he noticed his brother's intent look and worried face.\n\n\"What's the matter, Jon?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" The younger boy looked up, startled, from his deep study. Then,\nas Jak repeated the question, he answered unhappily, \"I just don't know\nenough, Owl. I can't figure out why Pop found such strong spectroscopic\nlines of that new element while we were billions of miles away, and\nyet we can't find any traces of it anywhere on these planets, except\nwhat we found in that cache.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's in the sun.\"\n\n\"I tried that when we were out there, but 'Annie' didn't even peep.\"\n\nThe elder brother studied the problem a moment.\n\n\"Could it be so strong that even the little bit we found would have\nshown those lines?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" doubtfully, \"but I don't think so. Tomorrow morning, when the\nsun comes up, I'm going to try to take a new reading from here. I tried\nto read Two, but couldn't get anything. However, I'm not so hot with\nthe regular spectrograph, and that's why I'm boning up on it.\"\n\n\"Is this important?\" Their mother had laid her sewing in her lap to\nlisten to them, trying to follow and understand what her sons were\ntalking about.\n\n\"Pop thought it was, Mom,\" Jon explained. \"One of the things men have\nbeen looking for ever since they first started dreaming of rockets and\nspaceships, was the best possible fuel. We knew the one we're using now\nisn't the ultimate, but it's the best they've been able to get so far.\nPop thought perhaps this new stuff might be it--_if_ we could find it,\nand _if_ we could learn how to use it.\"\n\n\"Why can't we use it if you find it?\" Jak wanted to know.\n\n\"There are so many problems. Maybe it would be so radioactive we\nwouldn't be able to handle it or keep it in the storage bins without\nendangering the people on the ship. Maybe the exciters and convertors\nwouldn't handle it without a lot of new experimenting and new designs\nwe wouldn't have the scientific or technical know-how to make. Or it\nmight be that instead of getting a steady stream of power as we do with\nour present activated-copper fuel, the stuff would want to blow up all\nat once. If the metal's as powerful as I think it is, it might cause\nan explosion that would make man's biggest H- or C-bomb look like a\nfirecracker.\"\n\n\"Then don't you go experimenting with it and blow us all up,\" his\nmother said sharply.\n\nJon grinned at her. \"You needn't worry about that, Mom, now that I've\nhad a chance to learn how little I know. Although I would've gone off\nhalf-cocked that day you stopped me--for which I'm grateful, even\nthough I was sore at you for a while then. But I'm sure going to study\nit as soon as we get the other markers set and can get back to Two.\"\n\n\"By that time Father will be well again,\" Jak said.\n\n\"Isn't it wonderful that he really is coming around all right? Seems to\nbe taking an awful long time for him to recover fully, though.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he'll be his own keen self again soon ... although he'll have\nto stay in bed until that leg is strong enough to stand on again.\"\n\n\"Well, let's hit the sack, so we can get a good start in the morning.\n'Night, Mom.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring their journeys over the surface of Planet Three the boys\nconscientiously tended the machines and recorders that gave them the\ndata on land and water conditions, the proportions of each, the\napproximate amounts of metallic ores their analyzers showed, the\ninformation on weather, temperature and humidity. They took numerous\npictures as required by law--their mother often helping in this, after\nJak had taught her how to operate the cameras. These pictures Jak\ndeveloped and printed as he had time, and mounted them in their data\nbook for the Colonial Board to study when they got back. They also\nmapped and recorded the size and distances of Three's two moons.\n\nJak named these \"Zinnia\" and \"Begonia,\" much to Jon's sarcastic and\nopenly-expressed derision.\n\n\"This'll make a swell home for people who like cold weather.\" Jak tried\nto change the subject.\n\n\"Yes, just as Two will for those who like it hotter.\" Jon's eyes shone.\n\"Pop sure picked a winner when he decided to explore this system. Even\nwith just these two worlds he has a prize.\"\n\n\"_If_ they accept our work as proof. Wonder what the fourth planet will\nbe like?\" Jak continued in a different tone.\n\n\"Cold. Lots colder, probably, than Mars.\"\n\n\"Then it won't do us any good?\"\n\n\"Depends on what's on it in the way of metals that can be mined. Maybe\nwe'll find something there. Might be natural gems or jewels, too.\"\n\n\"And anyway, cold never stopped man.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Jon said admiringly. \"They have mines on Pluto,\neven--although they're mostly worked by automatics while the men stay\nwarm in their bubble-cities.\"\n\nAs the _Star Rover_ approached closer to the distant, smaller planet\nthey had named \"Jon,\" their instruments showed it to have a diameter\nof about 4400 miles, and a density of about 4.6, a little lighter than\nTerra. This meant the gravity would be a bit weaker, and they would\nweigh less than on their home planet. Four was almost a quarter of a\nbillion miles from the sun, and would be very cold, as Jon had said.\n\nWhile their ship drove in closer, the boys' mother came into the\ncontrol room. All three Carvers stared excitedly into their visiplates,\nwatching their rapid approach to this new world. Would they find\nanything of value there, or was it simply a barren wasteland of ice\nand frozen air and rocks, far too cold and forbidding for men even to\nbother trying to explore it?\n\nWhen Jak, eyes still glued to the telescopic sights of his\nspectro-analyzer, voiced something of this, Jon drawled, \"You know\nbetter than that, Owl. We said just yesterday that there's no place, no\nmatter how bad, that man won't explore to see if there's anything he\ncan possibly use. They'll follow us here, don't worry.\"\n\nAfter cruising about the surface for some time, recording their data\nand taking the needed pictures, they saw a fairly level valley,\nice-covered and bare, and Jon set the ship down there. By now he was\nbecoming an expert astrogator and pilot, and with his new controls they\ncould hardly feel the jar of the ship's landing.\n\n\"How's the temp outside?\"\n\nJak was examining the gauges. \"About a hundred below, and not a bit of\nmoisture, naturally. Going to try going out?\"\n\n\"I don't....\" their mother started to speak against it, but made\nherself stop. Her boys were showing such resourcefulness and unexpected\nhabits of caution that she felt she must let them decide things for\nthemselves, even though her motherly instinct was always to hold them\nback from possible dangers.\n\n\"Sure we're going out for a bit,\" Jon answered his brother, then\nfaced their mother. \"It'll be all OK, Mom,\" he said affectionately.\n\"We'll wear our suits, of course, with the heaters on. We won't go\nfar, because the moment we feel any cold we'll run back. But I want to\nsee what it's like out there, and if there's any sort of life. We're\nsupposed to report....\"\n\n\"Life? Here?\" incredulously.\n\nIt was Jak who answered this. \"Sure, Mother, there can be life-forms\nanywhere. Oh, not necessarily nor even probably anything we know on\nTerra. But there should be some sort of moss or lichen in the plant\nline.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has been learned from experience there's some sort of life\nalmost everywhere,\" Jon chimed in.\n\n\"Even though most of it's so different from the basic protoplasm-type\nwe're used to that it's hard to realize it's really life at all,\" Jak\ncontinued. \"But then, remember back on Terra, the vast difference\nbetween animal and vegetable life--so totally unlike each other. I\nsecond Jon's plan to go out. I'd really like to see what's out there.\"\n\nShe sighed as if in recognition of the fact that these boys of hers\nwere fast becoming reliable, self-sufficient men. They were not her\nbabies any more. She was proud, of course--but she couldn't resist the\nmotherly impulse to warn, \"Well, be careful, anyway.\"\n\n\"Sure, we will.\"\n\nJon locked all the controls in neutral, and the two boys went to put on\ntheir suits. Knowing, as they did, the vital necessity of making sure\nthey were \"tight\" and fully equipped, they examined and inspected their\nown and each other's spacesuits carefully before they opened the inner\nlockdoor.\n\nOnce outside, they stood on the icy ground for several minutes to\nmake sure their heaters were working capably enough to keep them--and\nespecially their feet--warm. Finding they were as completely\ncomfortable as anyone ever can be inside that sort of a suit, they\nstarted off across the frozen plain, headed for the near-distant hills\non the side of the valley closest to the ship.\n\nJak examined the ground about them intently as they walked, hoping\nto find some sort of plant life, while Jon kept his eyes mostly on\nthe portable analyzer he carried, hoping they might discover valuable\ndeposits of inorganics. Was there any of that unknown fuel-metal here,\nhe wondered anxiously. Their big analyzer had not shown it as they were\ncoming in on the survey or landing spiral, but that did not necessarily\nmean the portable wouldn't show it on closer approach, or that there\nmight not be some on a portion of the surface they had not yet covered\nfrom above.\n\nTheir trips about and above the surface had, however, shown traces\nof iron, manganese, gold, silver, copper and several other metals,\nalthough not strongly enough to indicate great deposits. But Jon knew\nexperience had shown over the years that one of the inefficiencies of\nsuch analyzers was that they would not show the _depth_ of a deposit.\nMany times, when only a slight trace had been detected while flying\nabove the surface, prospectors on the ground had found veritable\nbonanzas, once they started mining.\n\nEven though the gravity was about eight per cent lighter than on Terra,\nthe boys found walking not too easy. The terrain was mostly rough,\nalthough there were many spots of slick, glare ice. Too, there were\nmany hillocks, and cracks and crevasses between the slippery places.\nSo, even though they had added caulks to their metallic suit-boots,\nwalking was unsafe and hard. By the time they reached the base of the\nfirst low hills they were winded and glad to rest a few minutes.\n\n\"Not a thing so far,\" Jak panted into his suit-mike. \"I can't see even\na bit of color--just this white glare.\"\n\n\"'Annie' hasn't let out a peep, either. Guess this is a dead 'un all\nright.\"\n\n\"At least this district looks it.\"\n\n\"Let's climb a ways, and if we don't find anything there, go back to\nthe ship and try somewhere else.\"\n\n\"I'll buy a chunk of that.\"\n\nThey started up the hill before them. The climbing was difficult\nbecause of the ice and because in most places the side of the hill was\nnot a gradual slope, but a starkly steep climb. It was evident there\nhad been no gradual \"weathering\" here, to produce rounded edges and\nrolling slopes, although there were occasional smooth places. These,\nthough, the boys knew could not be climbed at all without special\nequipment which they did not carry.\n\n\"This isn't frozen-water ice, is it?\" Jon asked as they panted upward.\n\n\"No, silly. There can be no water vapor here, any more than there is on\nNeptune or Pluto back home. This is mostly frozen carbon dioxide.\"\n\n\"Well, it's just as cold and just as hard to climb as polar ice.\"\n\nThey climbed the quarter mile to the crest of the first hill and\npeered eagerly over its top. In front and slightly below was another\nvalley--not as deep as the one in which their ship lay, but even\nlarger. From their higher position the floor of this new valley seemed\nquite smooth.\n\n\"But that can be just an optical illusion,\" Jak answered Jon's\nstatement, adding, \"the glare of white would make it look smoother from\na height.\"\n\nJon ignored the tone of superiority. \"Good thing our suits have tinted\nlenses. Do we go down?\"\n\n\"Natch.\" Jak had already started. \"Off there to the right and part way\ndown are some darker places. I want to look at them.\"\n\n\"Could lichens grow here?\"\n\n\"Some could, possibly, though not exactly like the kind we'd find on\nEarth. If there's life here, it's probably a type that can convert\nenergy directly from the elements in the ground or ice, instead of\nusing photo-synthesis or other methods of obtaining nourishment we know\nabout.\"\n\nHalf-sliding, half-climbing, they made their difficult way to the\nlittle patch of gray-greenness, which Jak examined with growing delight.\n\n\"Hey, that's gneiss.\"\n\n\"What's nice about ... Oh!\" Jon grew red-faced at having been caught\nthat way. \"You and your education!\" he snorted.\n\n\"See how brittle it is,\" Jak ignored the interruption as he touched a\nstem, only to have it snap off like a slim glass fibre. \"Can't tell\nwithout a more thorough microscopic examination, but I'll bet this is\nsome sort of silicon-based life--crystalline instead of being like the\ngneissic rocks back home.\"\n\nJon, meanwhile, had been surveying the valley with his binoculars.\nSuddenly he gave a gasp, and focussed his glasses more steadily on\nsomething that had caught his eye.\n\nFor some minutes he studied it, then called excitedly, \"Hey, Owl, give\na look over there. See, beside that spire of rock,\" he pointed as\nhis brother rose and unlimbered his own pair of binoculars. \"There's\nmovement of some sort there, though it's very, very slow, on that sort\nof pyramid a yard or so high.\"\n\nFor long moments the two studied the spot through their high-powered\nglasses, then Jak said slowly but with mounting excitement, \"I think\nyou're right, Chubby, and that we've got to see.\"\n\nIn their excitement, the two started off faster and more carelessly\nthan was safe. They found out that fact when both, almost at the same\ntime, lost their footing and fell, coasting down the remainder of\nthe hill. Faster and faster they slid, shaken and becoming bruised,\nalthough luckily neither broke any bones.\n\nAt the bottom they picked themselves up and started on again. Both\nwalked more gingerly now, and Jak limped a bit from a twisted ankle.\nYet they were so eager to see what this strange movement might be, they\nsoon forgot their bruises and hurried once more.\n\nIt was a good half mile across the valley floor to their destination.\nBut there, sure enough, they found _life_!\n\nStrange, unearthly life it was, but they soon discovered that it\nhad reproduction, growth and movement--the three main criteria of\nlife-forms.\n\n\"Crystalline, by golly!\" Jon yelled.\n\nJak was squatting beside the growing thing. It was somewhat pyramidal,\nyet the sides were not smooth. Rather, they were many-faceted, like\nthe pieces of rock crystal with which the boys were familiar. It was a\ngrayish-white color--with just enough of the gray in it so it had been\nvisible from a distance, against the white background. But now, as the\nboys were on the sunward side of one of the pyramids, for there were\nmany of them about, they could see that the light reflected from it was\nkaleidoscopic coloration at times.\n\nJak reached out a gloved hand and rapped on the pyramid ... and it gave\nforth a tinkling sound, then collapsed into a thousand tiny shards.\n\n\"You ... you broke it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to kill it. Had no idea it was so\nfragile.\" Jak rose, moved over to another pyramid, and squatted beside\nit, examining it closely, but careful not to touch it. Jon sank onto\nhis heels beside him.\n\nFor a few seconds as they watched there was no change. But suddenly\nthey heard a small, clear _ping_, and a new crystal sprang into\nexistence near the base. Almost at once there was a repetition of\nthe sound and another appeared further up on the adjoining side of\nthe structure--or creature. As the boys continued watching this\nwas repeated over and over--with each tiny sound a new facet came\ninto being somewhere on the pyramid. Before their very eyes the\ncrystal-being was growing.\n\n\"Boy, that's something!\" Jon exclaimed admiringly.\n\n\"Yes, it's a life-form, all right,\" Jak said more seriously, without\ntaking his eyes from it. \"It's all new to us, but I'll bet there's\nsilicon of some sort beneath this carbon-dioxide ice, and that this\nthing gets its nourishment from that.\"\n\n\"What makes it keep growing?\"\n\n\"What makes a man or an animal or plant grow when it eats?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Then, \"Do you suppose it has any mentality?\"\n\nJak was silent a moment, mulling that over. Then he looked at his\nbrother, a crease of concentration on his forehead. \"I feel quite sure\nthat it probably has, but of a sort we wouldn't be able to understand,\neven if we could get in contact with its so-called 'mind.' Even reading\nthat, I doubt very much if we'd be able to understand its way of\nthinking, reasoning, or the motivations by which it lives.\" He went\nback to studying the strange crystallization.\n\n\"_Ummm_, probably you're right,\" Jon agreed after some thought. A\nmoment later he asked, \"Is it good for anything? I mean, can man use it\nfor something?\"\n\nJak wrenched his gaze away from that astounding growth to look up in\nshocked disgust. \"Is that all you think about in the face of such a\nmarvel as this--whether it's worth anything or not? Here we've found an\nentirely new type of life, and....\"\n\n\"Hey, keep your suit tight, Owl. We have to report this, you know, and\nI'm just trying to find out what to write down.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Jak spoke slowly, his voice now admitting the lightness of\nthat point of view. \"I can't, offhand, see any practical value,\nespecially considering how easily these crystals are broken. But I\nknow geologists--and possibly chemists--will be intensely interested\nin studying them. There's a lot they can learn here, I'm sure. We'll\nnaturally report all that, you're right, and the location of this\nvalley.\"\n\n\"Think they may occur all over the planet?\"\n\n\"No telling, but probably if they can find the right sort of soil\nnourishment. We didn't see any while coming down, but they might've\nbeen there and we missed them, not expecting anything like this.\"\n\n\"We didn't see any other life-forms, either, that we could recognize.\nMaybe these're the dominant species here.\"\n\nJak rose to his feet and looked all about him. There were hundreds of\nthe pyramids to be seen, some towering a dozen or more feet high and\nas large across each base line; others very small--babies, he thought\nwith a grin.\n\nAgain he watched one of the smaller ones intently, noticing how it\ngrew. Jon walked about, looking at the different structures of that\nmysterious, growing crystal.\n\nSuddenly he stiffened, straining, listening. Then he called, \"Hey, Jak,\nyou hear anything?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" his brother tore his gaze from the crystallization he was\nwatching. \"Hear what?\"\n\n\"Turn up the power of your suit receiver. There. There it is again....\nHey, sounds like our siren!\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard it then. Mother must be in trouble, or something.\"\n\nJak's last words were flung back across his shoulder as he ran as fast\nas he could across the icy wastes of the valley floor. Nor was Jon far\nbehind. In fact, after a few strides the younger, but longer-legged boy\nwas beside him, then forged ahead.\n\n\"Hurry, Owl! Mom wouldn't signal unless it was urgent.\"\n\n\"Maybe Father's worse.\"\n\nThey tried to conserve their breath after that for running and\nclimbing. Once Jon broke the silence. \"Turn your oxygen a little\nhigher, Jak,\" he said as he twisted the small lever at his own shoulder\nto increase the flow of the strength-giving energy.\n\nThey were panting and winded by the time they reached the top of the\nhill. But they disregarded fatigue in the face of their mother's\nprobable danger--or their father's.\n\nJon looked quickly to one side and then the other. As Jak topped the\nridge he saw his brother run some twenty feet or so to where he had\nspotted a fairly smooth downward slope. Down this the younger boy\nlaunched himself feet first, sliding on his suit's back. Jak instantly\nrealized the reason, and threw himself after his brother.\n\nIn less than a tenth of the time it would have taken them to climb\ndown, the boys were at the foot of the hill. They struggled to their\nfeet and started off toward the ship. Both were again shaken and\nsorely bruised from their rough slide, but they trotted on. Mother had\ncalled--nothing else mattered.\n\nAs they came closer to the ship they saw her reason for summoning them.\n\nAll about the outer lockdoor were those strange crystalline structures,\ngrowing swiftly. As the two boys came still closer, they could see that\nstreamers of the crystals had already reached the lower edge and were\ntrying to force their way through the almost imperceptible crack.\n\n\"They'll never get ... through there,\" Jon panted as he raced the last\nfew feet.\n\n\"Don't see ... how they can ... but watch 'em.\" Jak waded into the\nalien, growing things. His gloved fists smashed right and left as he\nspoke. Jon was already doing the same.\n\nBut whether these crystal-beings were of a different type from those\nthat Jak had broken in the distant valley, or just what was the reason,\nthe boys now found it more difficult to break these crystals down.\n\n\"These aren't ... like those ... back there.\" Jon had now seen that\nthese crystals did not always grow in pyramidal shape.\n\n\"No, they grow ... new crystals ... wherever needed.\" Jak had been\nconcentrating on the tendrils, or chains of crystals that were\nreaching, always reaching, toward the lockdoor, while Jon had been\ntrying to break the bases of the pyramids from which these arms sprang.\n\nAlthough the crystals were still fairly easy to break--especially the\ntentacles, which were only a thin string--new ones replaced them so\nswiftly, and their numbers increased so constantly, that it seemed\nalmost a losing battle.\n\n\"These're growing lots faster than the others.\" Jon gritted his teeth\nas he now tried crushing the bases with his heavy metallic boots,\nhoping thus to make it harder for the crystal-beings to reach the door.\n\nFor minutes the two boys fought in desperation; then Jon grunted in\ndisgust at his thoughtlessness, and yanked out his flame-gun. \"Never\nthought of this,\" he yelled as he trained it on the crystal-beings. The\nterrifically hot flame washed off them in coruscating showers--but did\nno damage.\n\n\"Try bullets,\" Jak unlimbered his gun from his back, and started firing\nit into the base of the crystals nearest the lockdoor.\n\nThe heavy bullets shattered the crystals easily, and soon the boys\ncould begin to see that they were clearing the way.\n\n\"You keep firing while I open the door and climb in,\" Jon yelled.\n\"Then you climb in while I'm going to the control room and I'll lift\nship.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Jak replied and fired even faster as Jon touched the outer\nmechanism-stud that opened the lock.\n\nHardly had it begun opening, however, than they heard the sound of\nanother gun being fired through the opening. They looked up in surprise\nand saw it was their mother, shooting a shotgun. Jon scrambled up into\nthe lock.\n\n\"Good work, Mom, but get back in. I'm lifting ship.\"\n\nHe dashed through the inner doorway and into the control room. He threw\nthe switch and _Star Rover_ shuddered as its tubes roared into life.\nJon punched on the intercom visiplate that scanned the interior of the\nlock, and saw his mother pulling Jak into the ship, then closing the\nouter door. Quickly Jon put the ship into a slow cruising orbit and\nswitched on the auto-pilot. Remembering the open doors and the bitter\noutside cold, he glanced to see that the automatic heaters were taking\ncare of the inside temperature, then ran back toward the lock.\n\nThere he found his brother desperately trying to warm their mother's\nunsuited body, now growing blue from that terrible cold.\n\n\"Help me carry her into bed.\" Jak rose and grasped her arms, but Jon\npushed him aside. Stooping, he picked her up bodily. He ran, staggering\na bit, with her into the bunkroom. Jak was right behind, and pulled\nsome extra blankets from a drawer. Then, while he was piling covers\nabout her, Jon dashed into the galley.\n\nHe drew hot water from the tap and quickly made a cupful of instant\ntea, then ran back with it to the bunkroom.\n\nSome minutes later they saw with satisfaction that their mother's color\nwas growing more natural, and her body tremors were slowing from the\ncombined warmth of the extra blankets and hot drink. Only then did the\nboys stop to help each other out of their suits.\n\n\"Thanks for the help, Mother, but don't you know enough to wear a suit\nin weather as cold as this?\" Jak's worry made his voice sharp.\n\n\"Yes, who's always fussing about us being careful?\" Jon added. \"Then\npull a stunt like this.\"\n\nTheir mother looked up at them, and the old impish grin they had seen\nso seldom of late came onto her face.\n\n\"You've got me, Chums,\" she drawled. \"From now on I reckon I'll keep my\nbig mouth shut.\"\n\nJon howled, and Jak added in the same sort of drawl, \"Well, now, I\nwouldn't go for to say it was 'big,'\" and ducked as she slapped out at\nhim.\n\nSoon the two boys sobered down. \"We'd better go examine the lock and\nmake sure no crystals got in,\" Jak said.\n\n\"Yow, I forgot about that!\" Jon sprang forward. \"We sure don't want any\nof them in or on the ship.\"\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nDespite Jon's desire to get away from this unfriendly world that bore\nhis name, he was careful to see that the signal-marker was set out and\nfunctioning, and that the ship's log contained as complete a record\nof the resources and data on the planet as was required by the Terran\nColonial Board. The same was true of Four's four moons. Jak checked\nall the work, nor did they leave Four until both boys were satisfied\nit was complete. Their mother was a great help in taking the numerous\nphotographs needed, having become quite competent in handling the\ncameras. She was so relieved at the steady progress of her husband's\nconvalescence that she put extra enthusiasm into her photography. The\nfamily still felt that Mr. Carver should be kept as quiet as possible\nand away from any mental strain in connection with the ship and the\nplanet mapping and, in his weakness, he seemed content to leave it\nthat way for the time being. He asked few questions and accepted the\nreassuring answers contentedly.\n\nNor, even though Jon wished to get back to friendly Two as soon as he\ncould, did he forget they still had to visit Planet Five, and scout and\nrecord that.\n\nSo, as soon as they were completely done on Four, he lost no time\nsetting course for Five. Once on the way, he announced his names for\nthe four moons of Four, and now it was Jak's turn to scoff.\n\n\"Well, if you can name yours after flowers, I don't see why you've got\nany kick coming because I name mine after fish,\" Jon asserted. \"I leave\nit to you, Mom--aren't Tuna, Betta, Sturgeon and Porpoise nice names?\"\n\n\"I think they are fine, just as I think Zinnia and Begonia are aptly\nnamed,\" she said diplomatically.\n\nThe two boys made faces at each other, then Jon turned back to his\ncomputations. \"I'm not as good at figuring these things out as Pop\nis, but I think Five is about a half billion miles from the sun. It's\nalmost three hundred and fifty million miles from here, since it's\nfurther around the sun. But we'll cut across on a direct route.\"\n\nTo his surprise, Jak came up and clapped him on the shoulder. \"You're\ndoing a grand job of astrogating, Chubby. I'm really proud of you.\" His\nvoice was sincere and appreciative.\n\n\"Yes,\" their mother came over and kissed Jon, rumpling his hair\naffectionately. \"I've been unexpectedly relieved that you've managed to\nget us to each world so surely and to land us so gently. Though maybe\nI shouldn't have been so surprised, at that.\" She laughed gaily as her\nyounger son flushed from this unexpected praise.\n\n\"Aw, you guys are just saying that because I'm so wonderful.\" Jon\ntried to joke, but they could tell how deeply he felt their compliments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA day later, when Jon announced they were approaching this outermost\nplanet, the other two joined him in the control room, and all were soon\ndeeply engrossed in the sight revealed to them in their visiplates.\n\nAn hour or so later Jon was examining their spectro-analyzer, when he\nlet out a yelp of excitement. \"Hey, that fuel-stuff's showing up. It\nmust've come from Five.\" And a moment later, \"Listen to 'Annie' rattle.\nIt sure is there--but plenty.\"\n\nThey clustered about him, and even though they could not tell anything\nfrom the lines on the spectrograph that he pointed out, they could hear\nthe machine chattering, and they grew excited from his exultation.\n\n\"Miners can use the same type of automatics they use on Pluto to get\nit, can't they?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"I'd imagine so, although I really don't know anything about it.\nHowever, if we find we can use it, there's where they can get it, and\nthat's the important thing.\"\n\nTheir plates again showed only the blinding whiteness of ice they knew\nwas frozen carbon dioxide rather than frozen water or snow. For even\nmore than on Four, there could be no water here, even in its most\nfrozen form.\n\nThey cruised about above the surface, watching their instruments to\nfind and record any metallic ore deposits, especially the new one. The\nterrain was so forbidding, so desolate, that even the irrepressible Jon\nfelt no desire to land on it, or to go outside.\n\nAgain their mother took most of the needed photographs, while the\nboys recorded all the other data of geography, size and conditions\ngenerally. Finally, Jon set the ship down on a fairly level plateau\nclose to what they figured was the equator.\n\n\"Well, here we are and that's all I care about,\" Jon announced with a\nshiver. \"We'll use the distant hands to put out the marker. Then we'll\nsee if we can find the location of that fuel deposit.\"\n\nJak agreed. \"I wouldn't go out there for a million credits.\" He\nshuddered as he looked out the port while the others crowded about to\nview that forbidding scene. \"Maybe we should, but I sure wouldn't get\nany fun out of it.\"\n\n\"Doubt if our suits would be able to keep us warm, even with the\nheaters at max.\"\n\n\"No,\" their mother said sharply, although they could detect the relief\nin her voice that they had already made the decision. \"This is one time\nI would have set my foot down, and not allowed it. This place gives me\nthe creeps.\"\n\nWhile Jon was making up the tape, Jak carried a signal-sender into\nthe lock and placed it beneath those \"distant hands.\" Jon came in and\ninstalled the tape, then started the mechanism running.\n\nThey returned to the control room, and Jak, whistling unmelodiously\nbetween his teeth, operated the controls that opened the outer door,\nthen used the lifting servo-mechanism to set the signal-sender outside\non the icy ground. When the outer door was closed, he nodded to Jon and\nthe latter lifted the ship again.\n\n\"I'm going up a couple of miles, then circle about to look for deposits\nof that fuel metal. Meanwhile, as we go we can get the rest of our\ndope, and then scoot out of here.\"\n\nJak again took his place at the recorders, while his mother was at\nthe cameras. Jon set the ship into a quartering circle, and when he\nhad located the direction in which the analyzer showed the strongest\nindications of the enigmatic metal, swung into that course.\n\nThey had gone less than five hundred miles when they noticed a reddish\nglow in the distance. As they came closer, they saw that ahead and\nbelow was a terrific, whirling mass of colored gas.\n\n\"Wow, look at that storm!\" Jak yelled. But he could not help adding,\n\"Did you ever see anything more beautiful?\"\n\n\"Better get well above it, hadn't you?\" Mrs. Carver asked anxiously.\n\"It looks dangerous.\"\n\n\"I'm sure not going through it.\" Jon was already lifting the ship. \"But\n'Annie' says the stuffs right close.\"\n\nAt five miles high he leveled off and put the ship into a narrowing\nspiral. From that vantage point they could see that the storm was a\npurely localized affair, perhaps some twenty miles in diameter.\n\n\"Wonder what makes those colors?\" Jak called from the\ntelescopic-visiplate into which he was staring.\n\n\"Suppose it could be a volcano?\"\n\n\"Could there be volcanic action on so cold a planet?\" their mother\nasked in astonishment.\n\n\"I don't see how there could be,\" Jak answered slowly, \"but that\ncertainly looks like flames of some sort down there.\"\n\n\"Maybe the experts from Terra can figure it out from our color\npictures,\" Mrs. Carver said. \"I'm taking a lot of extra ones, with the\nvariable focus lens.\"\n\n\"That new metal's down there, though, whatever it is. Since those other\npeople mined it, our miners'll figure out how to get it, too, I'll bet.\"\n\n\"I wonder.\" Jak was suddenly diffident. \"Don't laugh now, but do you\nsuppose maybe those flames could be some sort of life, and that they're\nfeeding on the metal, which you said was highly radioactive?\"\n\n\"Now who's nutty?\" Jon asked witheringly, while Mrs. Carver gasped at\nthe daring concept.\n\n\"Well, some of those flames are coming higher and aiming for us.\" Jak\ntried to defend his position. \"We'd have said such crystal-creatures as\nwe found on Four were impossible, but we know they aren't and that they\nhave some sort of--well, intelligence, from the way they tried to get\nour ship. So why not flame-beings?\"\n\n\"Do you think they're dangerous?\" Their mother's voice held a\nfrightened note as she saw in her plate those swiftly approaching\nflames.\n\n\"Don't see how they could possibly hurt the ship, or us.\" Jon tried to\nspeak calmly ... but he tilted the nose and the space-yacht was soon\nnearly ten miles high, although it still continued circling.\n\n\"Man, oh man, they're certainly beautiful!\" Jak was enthralled as those\nbright, shining tongues of flame grew taller and taller. \"There ...\nthere does seem to be a ... a purpose in the way they act, though.\"\nHis tone changed to a more anxious one.\n\nThe flames were now high above the storm of fire that constituted the\nmain ... body? Now these tongues broke loose, and as they continued\nrising toward the ship they became more spherical in shape--were no\nlonger simply extensions of the planet-based fires. And as they rose\never higher and faster, they seemed to the anxious watchers to be\nreally thinking, intelligent entities.\n\n\"Let's move away from here,\" their mother pleaded. \"I'm getting the\nfeeling that they are actually pursuing us--and for no good purpose,\neither.\"\n\nJon touched the controls, and the ship began rising more swiftly.\n\n\"No, don't leave; I want to study ...\" Jak began, but Jon interrupted\nhim.\n\n\"So would I like to know more about them, but if Mom wants to leave,\naway we go.\" Yet there was an undercurrent of relief in his voice.\n\nBut as if guessing his intention, the flames hurtled after them at such\ntremendous speed that before the ship had barely begun accelerating,\nthey were almost up to it.\n\n\"Hang on tight!\" Jon yelled, and increased the acceleration. Soon the\nship had left the flames behind. Peering in their telescopic plates,\nthe three could see the flames, reluctantly and as if baffled, return\nat last to their home below.\n\n\"All gone, Mother. We're safe now,\" Jak said comfortingly.\n\n\"Thank you, God,\" she said devoutly and sank limply into a seat. \"I was\nafraid for awhile....\"\n\n\"So was I,\" Jon's teeth began chattering and his body shaking so hard\nthat he, too, was glad he was sitting down. Now that it was all over\nthe shock of that strangeness--that utter alienness--was hitting him.\nNor was Jak in much better shape, in spite of his expressed desire to\nstay and study the enigmatic flame-life.\n\nIt was many minutes before the trio were able to discuss the matter\ncalmly, and to realize they had been in actual danger.\n\n\"I see now we sure would have been, if Jon hadn't zoomed us out of\nthere so fast,\" Jak said.\n\nFinally, Mrs. Carver shook herself. \"I'll go get lunch. It must be\ntime, hungry as I feel.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" Jon laughed. \"But then, I'm always hungry.\"\n\nAs soon as the three had finished eating, Mrs. Carver and Jak went\nto sit with the invalid and watch hopefully for those semi-conscious\nmoments which were becoming more and more frequent. Jon went back to\ncheck his course back to Planet Two, and to lounge later in the pilot's\nseat, studying from one of his reelbooks.\n\n\"There must be,\" he told himself, \"some way of handling that fuel, and\nof storing and using it. The fact that it was cached there on Two shows\nthat. But then, those folks who used it were so evidently far advanced\nin science.\"\n\nA bit later the thought intruded, \"Hey, if that stuff's so powerful\nnow, after all the untold time it was stored there, what was it like\nwhen it was new?\"\n\nAn hour or so later he heard his name called, urgently. He sprang up\nand ran into the other room, to see his brother beckoning him from the\ndoorway of their parents' bunkroom. As he came up Jon saw his mother\ninside, bending over the bunk.\n\n\"Is--is Pop worse? He'd been so much better!\" Jon's heart was clogging\nhis speech.\n\n\"No, he seems to be waking up fully.\" Jak turned a radiant face toward\nhim, then immediately knelt by his father's side.\n\nJon knelt, too, his eyes fastened on the still figure in the bed. But\neven as he watched, the eyelids slowly fluttered a bit, then a hand was\nraised to the forehead. Mr. Carver's head turned from side to side,\nrestlessly, and then his eyes opened. They seemed to be studying each\nof the three watchers in turn, as well as the room in which he was\nlying.\n\n\"What--\" The voice was low, and they strained to hear, \"What happened\nto me?\"\n\nHis wife answered quietly, \"Don't you worry about that now, Dear. You\nwere hurt and have been unconscious for some time. But now you're\ngetting well, and I'll tell you all about it when you wake up again. Go\nback to sleep now. You are getting stronger that way.\"\n\nMr. Carver seemed to be weighing that advice, then to accept it. \"All\nright,\" he said with an affectionate smile. He closed his eyes, and\nsoon the rhythmic breathing told the three anxious watchers he was\nasleep once more.\n\nJon let out his breath in a happy sigh, there were tears of joy in his\nmother's eyes. Jak exclaimed delightedly, \"He's getting well, Mother!\nIn another day or so he'll be all right. Naturally he'd not remember\nclearly for a while. My textreels say people with concussions seldom\ndo. But as soon as he gets a little stronger and those damaged places\nin his brain completely restore themselves, he will, you'll see.\"\n\nJon chimed in quickly, although he was not too sure of what he was\nsaying. \"It's just the shock, like Jak says. He'll snap out of it in a\nday or so.\"\n\nShe wiped her eyes on the corner of her apron, and smiled tremulously,\n\"Of course, Boys. I ... I guess I've just been so nervous and--and he\nwas so much more like himself this time.\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" Jon laid his hand gently on her arm. \"You've been under\na terrible strain, too, what with Pop sick and us boys roaming around\non alien planets. But we'll be back on Two where it's more like home,\nand there's only a little more to be done before we can start back\nfor Terra. Anyway, we did and are doing what had to be done to prove\nup Pop's claim, and we've beaten Slik Bogin, supposing he's out here\ntrying to cheat us out of this system.\"\n\nThe boys went into the control room. \"We'll have to figure out where to\nlay out our townsite, and which planet is best to put it on.\"\n\n\"I vote for Two,\" Jak said after only a moment's hesitation. \"It seems\nthe most homelike to me, and we can stand the climate so much better\nthere. Won't have to work in suits all the time.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's where I wanted it, too. This is a funny system, in a way,\nthough--there's a much greater difference in the distances between the\nplanets than we usually find.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Ask some astronomer, not me. Has something to do with sizes and\ndensities, I believe--but I'm not sure even of that. Maybe it's because\nthis sun is larger and denser than the others we've studied. I know\nit's almost a quarter bigger than Sol.\"\n\n\"Two's almost as far away from this sun as Terra is from Sol, didn't\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Yes, Earth's average is about ninety-three million miles, while Two\nis about eighty-seven, which accounts for its warmth. Then, near as I\ncan figure it out, Three is lots closer than Mars, yet Five is only a\nlittle further than Jupe, and Four is between them.\"\n\n\"Didn't I read somewhere that Sol's Asteroid Belt is really a broken-up\nplanet?\"\n\n\"Some people think so. But nobody knows for sure, yet.\n\n\"All right, then, let's put our city on Two.\" Jak grinned. \"Has the\nmastermind decided where to put it?\"\n\n\"Not the exact location.\" Jon flushed, but grinned back. \"Colonial says\nit must be fairly close to good water, good soil, forests, and mineral\ndeposits, however.\"\n\nHe sobered and looked at his brother appealingly. \"Golly, Owl, any\nchance of Pop getting entirely well before we have to start it, so that\nit wouldn't hurt him to do brainwork? I don't know very much about city\nplanning, you know--only the specs Colonial furnished.\"\n\n\"He could--but maybe he won't. I don't know enough to say how soon.\nI've been fooled before--thought it would only take a few days, when he\nwas first hurt.\"\n\n\"What about his being so ... so ... dreamy?\"\n\n\"You mean, when he woke up just now? That's really nothing to worry\nabout, honestly, just as I told you and Mother. I looked it up again,\nand the text says amnesiacs often act that way just before they recover\nfull consciousness.\"\n\nJon let out his breath in relief.\n\n\"But listen,\" Jak changed back to the old subject. \"If you don't know\nanything about city planning--and I don't either--how're we going to\nknow what has to be done to satisfy the Colonial Board?\"\n\n\"It's all in the papers they gave us that have to be filled out to file\nwhen we get back. It tells how much area to cover, how far apart the\nstreets are to be and how wide, and how to mark out everything.\"\n\n\"Gosh, that sounds like a complicated deal. It'll take us an awful long\ntime, won't it?\"\n\n\"Not as much as you'd think. If we work really hard, I figure we should\nbe able to do it in a couple of weeks. We just have to sketch in the\nbare outline, not fill it all in.\n\n\"Get out the papers, then, and we'll study them.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nWith the various members of the Carver family busy with their studies\nand chores, it did not seem long before they came close to Planet Two,\nand Jon laid down his reelbooks to begin preparing for the landing. He\nhad started down through the atmosphere when Jak suddenly roused.\n\n\"Why don't we circle around a bit and look for our townsite from the\nair?\"\n\n\"I was going to,\" Jon said with a disarming grin. \"Just wanted to get\nclose enough to see well before I called you in to help me decide.\"\n\nAt about five miles above the surface he leveled off and began\ncircumnavigating the globe. He headed in the direction which--he\nremembered from their previous visit--would soonest bring them near\nthe great ocean, but zigzagged from north to south as they proceeded\neastward.\n\n\"Watch for rivers,\" he said. \"A fairly large one that empties into the\nocean.\"\n\nThey were about halfway between the north pole and the equator, as they\nhad already decided the climate in that latitude would probably be the\nmost suitably average. In a few minutes of traveling they saw ahead a\nplain that looked to be just what they wanted.\n\nQuickly Jon maneuvered the ship downward and soon landed. They were\njust a few miles from the edge of the great ocean, at the mouth of\na large river of considerable width and length, and not far from an\nextensive forest to the south, and a range of considerable mountains to\nthe west.\n\n\"Hope the soil here is good,\" Jon commented as he locked the controls\nin neutral. \"Everything else seems perfect.\"\n\n\"The spec-anal shows minerals fairly close, in those hills to the\nwest.\" Jak was eagerly peering from the port.\n\n\"I know--that's why I chose this spot. Nice flat land here; good river;\nclose to the ocean, mountains less than a hundred miles away, and not\ntoo high. Ideal place, I'd say.\n\n\"That it is; that it is. Going out today?\"\n\n\"Why not? Nearly four hours till sundown. We can start planning today,\nthen get busy in the morning.\"\n\nTheir mother came in just then. \"I thought it felt like we had landed.\nWhat are you going to do here?\" She glanced out of the port.\n\n\"We have to lay out a townsite,\" Jon answered, and at her astonished\nlook he explained.\n\nShe shook her head admiringly and with surprise. \"You boys continually\namaze me--you seem able to do anything.\"\n\nJon shrugged that off. \"When a thing has to be done, a fellow usually\ncan figure out some way of doing it.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" Jak grinned, \"we're like those old chaps on Terra who used\nto say, 'The difficult we do immediately, the impossible takes a little\nlonger.'\"\n\nThey left her then and hurried out of the ship. Even though they felt\nthere could be no possible danger here--they could see for miles in\nevery direction, and noticed nothing moving--they were wise enough from\nexperience to carry their rifles slung across their backs, and wore\nbandoliers of ammunition. In addition, both carried tools and what\nequipment they felt might be needed.\n\nOnce outside, they ran first to the river, and tested the water. It was\nfresh and clear, and they knew this would be a good source of water for\ntheir proposed city ... until men might pollute it with their garbage\nand wastes.\n\n\"Got your pedometer?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"Sure, right here in my coverall pocket. Why?\"\n\n\"I suggest this would be a good place for the center of the town's\nnorth side....\"\n\n\"Yes, here by the riverbank would....\"\n\n\"I'll go east and you go west a half mile each, then we'll set our\ncorner stakes.\"\n\n\"Then we'll both walk south a mile and set those, and have the four\ncorners done. Sometimes, Owl, I have to give you credit for having\nbrains.\"\n\n\"Wish I could say the same about you.\" Jak reached out and gave his\nbrother a friendly shove. \"Get going, Stupe. And when we start south,\nbe sure you keep your line straight.\"\n\n\"Look who's yelping. Mine'll be as plumb as yours--probably more so,\nbecause I'm a better plumber than you are.\"\n\nJon started his pacing, while Jak went in the opposite direction after\na pretended \"_grrr_\" at Jon's horrible pun.\n\nWhen they returned to the ship, as the sun was going down, they felt\nthey had made a good beginning. But as they went into the control\nroom to talk alone, away from their mother's hearing--lest they worry\nher--they were not too cheerful.\n\n\"You know anything about surveying?\" Jak slumped into a seat.\n\n\"Nope, not a sardine's worth.\" Jon paced forth and back in the little\nroom. \"That's what has me worried. How're we going to place those other\nmarking stakes in exactly the right spots.\"\n\n\"Guess we'll have to measure them some other way.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Darned if I know. You're the mechanically--minded one--I thought you\ncould figure it out.\"\n\nJon continued his pacing, his young forehead creased with thought.\nFinally, just as their mother called them to dinner, he looked up\nexcitedly. \"Hey, it'll be easy, after all!\"\n\n\"How?\" Jak was as excited as his brother as they went in to the living\nquarters and sat down at the table.\n\n\"A light plastic line that won't stretch, exactly measured, and\nfastened to two metal pin-stakes. We'll make two sets, and....\"\n\n\"I get it. One the length of the blocks, the other the width of the\nstreets.\"\n\n\"Right. Stick a pin in the ground, measure out the line, then plant one\nof our regular stakes.\"\n\n\"Then give a yank, pull the pin out and haul it in. Then use the other\nset to measure the street....\"\n\n\"Yes, just keep going. Hey, I believe with that system we could each\nwork alone, so I'll make two sets.\"\n\nJak thought all this over swiftly for several minutes, working fork and\nknife and jaws meanwhile. Finally, between mouthfuls, he said slowly,\n\"I can't see a flaw in it--as long as we're mighty careful. Do you\nthink it'll pass inspection?\"\n\n\"If we take our time and make sure we're right, I don't see why not.\"\n\n\"What're you boys talking about now?\" Their mother set a refilled dish\nof steaming Chlorella stew on the table, and resumed her own seat.\n\nThey explained, and told her the necessity of what they had to do\nin order to prove up their father's claim on this system, when they\nreturned to Terra and appeared before the Colonial Board with their\nproofs of prime discovery.\n\nThe worried look came back into her eyes. \"I always understood that\nsurveying was a mighty exact profession. Do you really think you can\nmeasure it exactly enough to take the place of a regular survey?\"\n\n\"I think we can make it close enough so that when Pop wakes up and\nshows us how to do the final survey with the instruments, we can save\na lot of time, at least,\" Jon assured her. \"That's what we're thinking\nand planning about now.\"\n\n\"You see, Mother,\" Jak broke in, \"if we have the stakes all set, all\nwe'll have to do is to make the sights on each one, after Father\nteaches us how to use the transit. Then, if we should be off anywhere,\nwe can fix them easily.\"\n\n\"Yes, it'll cut down the time a lot,\" Jon went on, \"and now we're so\nnear done, I want to get everything finished so we can go back to Terra\nimmejit.\"\n\n\"Why? Getting homesick?\" his mother teased.\n\n\"Not so much that, but we want to get our claim before the Board.\nAnything can happen when such distances and time are concerned....\"\n\n\"And we just don't want anything to spoil Father's chances of having\nthis valuable claim verified.\"\n\n\"I see.\" She smiled now in relief, and again her eyes showed the pride\nshe felt in her two manly boys who were daily proving themselves more\nthan equal to the unusual situations in which they found themselves.\n\"Your father woke up again while you were out, and....\"\n\n\"He did?\" It was a duet of happy excitement.\n\n\"... and while he still didn't seem to realize what had happened, he\nacted even more as though he recognized me. He let me feed him some\nbroth, then went back to sleep again very contentedly.\"\n\n\"Golly, that's great!\" Jon reached out and patted her hand.\n\nThe three chatted together with more freedom and animation than they\nhad known since the terrible accident first occurred. It seemed as\nthough their worst troubles were over. For Tad Carver was so reliable,\nso confident in himself, so trust-inspiring--even beyond their natural\nlove for him--that they felt everything would just have to work out\nright, once he was again in command.\n\nAs soon as they had finished eating, the boys hurried to the storeroom\nand found some metal rods.\n\n\"Cut me four lengths about fifteen inches each,\" Jon ordered as he went\nto the workbench. He cleared a space, then began getting the tools he\nwanted, and hooking up the induction furnace.\n\n\"You'll need eight for two full sets, won't you?\"\n\n\"I got to thinking we'd better make only one set for now. If it works\nout all OK, then we can make the other.\"\n\nBy the time Jak had the pieces cut, Jon was ready to heat one end of\neach in the furnace, then bend it into a small eye. The other end he\nsharpened on the emery wheel.\n\n\"Now measure out pieces of that plastic rope,\" he ordered, pointing\nto a reel of small-diametered but very strong line. \"Figure about six\ninches extra on each....\"\n\n\"Look, Chum, you tend to your job and give me credit for brains enough\nto know that much.\" Jak's tone was almost cross, for sometimes this\nyounger brother got on his nerves, since Jon did occasionally get quite\n\"bossy.\"\n\nBut the elder quickly subdued that feeling--helped by the surprised and\nsomewhat hurt look in Jon's eyes. He knew so well that Jon was merely\ntrying--as he himself was learning to do--to see that neither made any\nmistakes in this important work they were attempting to do in their\nfather's absence. Father was always cautioning them to take pains with\nwhatever they were doing, and they usually accepted his warning and\nadvice--as they did their mother's--without any more grumbling than\nboys ordinarily make about such \"fussing.\"\n\nBut now each of them--and both of them together--had to be, and did\ntry to be, extra painstaking in all the things their father would\nhave cautioned them about, and they checked and rechecked each other\nconstantly. So Jak said nothing more, and quietly helped Jon complete\nthe stakes-and-line sets. After all, he admitted honestly, there were\nundoubtedly times when he got just as \"bossy\" as Jon did.\n\nSoon the two sets of pins and line were done. Each of the boys measured\neach once--twice--to make doubly sure their work was right. Then they\ncut up and sharpened a number of wooden stakes from some inch-by-inch\nstrips they found in the storeroom.\n\nThe next morning they started out early. Each carried a bundle of the\nmarking stakes, and Jon had a small sledge in one hand. In addition,\nthey had their rifles slung across their backs.\n\n\"Working together to begin with,\" Jon said at breakfast, \"we can start\nthe eastward leg from the southwest corner, and run it a ways, then\ncome back and start the northward one from this same corner.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we get that first corner square and right, there's less chance\nof the other three being wrong--they'll more or less check themselves.\"\n\nThey soon found they could work at quite a swift pace, and at lunch\ntime Jon cried, \"At this rate we'll have time to go back and re-check\neverything, and still get done within our two weeks.\"\n\n\"Yes, if we don't run into any trouble, this seems to be working out\nfine. Much better than I'd have given you credit for being able to\nfigure out, Chubby.\"\n\n\"Catfish to you, Brother!\" Jon grinned. \"Hey, that reminds me. I want\nto see if that river's got any fish in it--and no....\" He caught\nhimself and stopped, but Jak knew what he meant. Their mother still\ndidn't know about that quicksand Jon had been almost trapped in, and\nthey didn't want her to learn of it.\n\n\"I suppose it would be worth knowing,\" Jak had hastened to say, almost\nas if interrupting. \"For once your eternal love of fishing will have\nits good points--as well as getting us fresh food. What about the\nocean?\"\n\n\"I'll try that, too, if I have time. Surf-fishing won't tell us too\nmuch about the deeper sea, and I haven't any heavy tackle for anything\nvery big if we happen to run into it. But probably, close to shore like\nI'll have to fish, we wouldn't catch anything my lines and hooks won't\nhandle.\"\n\n\"If _you_ can handle 'em,\" Jak said with a grin.\n\n\"Don't you worry about me,\" Jon retorted. \"I can pull in anything I can\nget my hook on.\"\n\n\"Except a sunken ship,\" Jak jibed, and Jon's face grew red. That\nincident, when he and his father had been fishing off the coast of\nSouthern California, back in Terra's Pacific Ocean, was still a tender\nsubject with him. He had had to cut his line that time, because they\ncould not loosen his hooks, and he had lost a favorite spinner and\nleader and half his best line.\n\nThat first week passed uneventfully. The boys worked hard, from shortly\nafter sunup to almost sundown. So hard, in fact, that their mother\nfinally protested after noticing that they were so weary that they\nslumped in their chairs at the table and could hardly eat each evening\nwhen they returned to the ship.\n\n\"Now you boys listen to your mother,\" she commanded one night at\ndinner. \"I'm just as anxious to get back to Earth as you are, but\nthere's no sense killing yourselves to save a day or two. From now on,\nyou are to start an hour later, and quit an hour earlier.\"\n\nJak managed a weak grin. \"Guess you're right, Mother. But we are coming\nalong fine.\"\n\n\"Sure, we've almost completed outlining the site. We'll have to take\ntomorrow off anyway, to go to the forest out there and cut some more\nstakes,\" Jon added.\n\n\"It'll make a nice vacation. I'm really fed up with so much sameness of\nhard work.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's been a steady grind, no fooling, but we wanted to get it\ndone as quick as we can, so Pop can check it.\"\n\nFor their father had been waking up several times every day, their\nmother reported. True, he had only been conscious for short periods,\nand was still too weak to be bothered with any of their problems. But,\nshe told the boys, he was able to eat something each time he awoke, and\nhis mind was clear again. She was preparing easily eaten and digested\nfoods that would bring back his strength quickly.\n\nJak asked anxiously whether his father had mentioned how the leg felt,\nand Mrs. Carver told him, \"He says it doesn't pain any, although\nsometimes it itches beneath the cast.\"\n\nLater on, just as they finished eating, Jak suggested, \"Take your\ntackle along tomorrow, Chubby, and we'll chop where the woods meet the\nriver.\"\n\n\"Why, t'anks, pal, you're a good kid.\" Jon made a fake pass at his\nbrother, who jumped up from the table and yanked the other's chair\nbackward, starting a small scuffle which their mother wisely did not\ntry to stop, knowing that, tired as they were, it would last only a few\nseconds and would be good for them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the boys returned from their expedition the next night, with arms\nand backs loaded with bundles of stakes, and Jon's creel well-filled\nwith Two's fish-things, she met them anxiously at the lockdoor.\n\n\"Did you boys hear or see the ship that passed over us this morning?\"\n\n\"Ship?\"\n\n\"No, we didn't see nor hear a thing. Sure it was a ship?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't see it, either. I thought I heard one, and ran to look\nout, but couldn't locate anything. Maybe it was just my imagination.\"\n\n\"Spaceship or airship?\" Jon asked.\n\n\"I couldn't tell you that, either, except that if I did really hear\none, it must have been a spaceship to disappear so quickly.\"\n\n\"Unless it was a fast jet--they're just as hard to spot.\"\n\nThey discussed the affair for some time, but could come to no\nconclusions. If it was a ship, why hadn't it stopped or signalled?\nAnd if it wasn't one, what had she heard? Or had she actually heard\nanything?\n\nTwo evenings later the two boys had completed outlining their city\nsite, and were just climbing into the _Star Rover_ when they heard\ntheir mother's voice.\n\n\"That you, boys? Come in here. Hurry!\"\n\nAt the urgency in her voice, they ran quickly and found her sitting at\nthe side of their father's bunk. As they got closer they saw his head\nturn toward them, and recognition in the wide-open eyes.\n\n\"Hello, fellows!\" His voice was weak but happy.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Oh, Pop, you're awake at last!\"\n\nThe two almost fought to be closest to him, but their mother moved a\nlittle and both sank to their haunches beside the bunk, each with one\nof their father's somewhat emaciated hands in theirs.\n\n\"Your mother tells me I've been sick quite a long time, and that you\nchaps have been carrying on. I'm grateful, and proud.\"\n\n\"You should see the way Mom has caught on to doing things,\" Jon said\nquickly. \"She does almost all our photographing now.\"\n\n\"And Jon has developed into a real astrogator,\" Jak said.\n\n\"Yes, Pop, but you wouldn't be as well as you are today if it hadn't\nbeen for Owl knowing how to set your leg and make a cast for it, and\ngiving you the proper medicines and intravenous feedings.\" Jon turned\nto smile at his brother, who grew red in the face and tried to stop\nthe compliments, but the younger boy rushed on. \"He's really a whiz as\na doctor. Knew exactly what to do for you. How's your leg feel?\"\n\n\"Fine, thanks to you, Jak.\"\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't so much--and I didn't _know_. I had to study a lot to\nfind out....\"\n\n\"Anyway, I'm still alive and that shows you did a fine job.\" Mr. Carver\nlifted a weak hand to caress his elder son's face. Then he turned\ntoward Jon. \"I've had fine reports of you, too, Son. Your mother\nsays....\"\n\n\"Yes, if anyone deserves praise around here, it's Jon,\" Jak broke\nin. \"He has done all the piloting and figuring courses, and he even\ninvented a one-man control so he can land and take off without all the\ntrouble and preciseness needed before. Why, he....\"\n\n\"Nix Owl!\" Jon was the one to be embarrassed now. \"That can wait until\nPop's stronger. The main thing is to report now, so he can tell us what\nto do next.\"\n\n\"Where are we--and what has been done so far?\" Mr. Carver asked. \"Your\nmother hasn't--or wouldn't--tell me, except that we've reached the new\nsystem, and are landed on one of the worlds there.\"\n\n\"We're on Planet Two, and we're laying out the city site that the Board\nrequires. This sun has five planets, and Two and Three are perfectly\nhabitable for humans, but no natives above animal level,\" Jak began.\n\n\"There're seven moons--one at Two, two at Three, and four at Four,\"\nJon took up the tale. \"We've visited all the planets, and have set out\nthe automatic signal-senders, with tapes giving you the credit for the\nprime discovery.\"\n\n\"They named the sun 'Carveria' after you, Mr. C.\" His wife leaned\nforward, eyes shining with pride, and an arm across the shoulders of\neach of the boys. \"They named the planets after one of us, each, and\nthe fifth one after the ship, and we've given names to the moons, too.\"\n\n\"This world will be swell for people who like it warm, and Three will\nbe just as good for those who prefer colder weather. Both are a lot\nlike Terra at different seasons and sections, and both are rich in\nsoil, water, forests, metals and....\"\n\n\"And we discovered a cache of that new fuel-metal you thought you saw\nin the spectroscope,\" Jon broke in, his voice bubbling with eagerness.\n\"Right here on Two. Not a mine or a vein, understand, but a cache, in a\nmetal box buried in the sand. Must have been some people a long, long\ntime ago, because from the sand drifted inside the box it apparently\nhadn't been touched for thousands of years. And it showed up on\nFive....\"\n\n\"But it's guarded by some sort of sentient flames,\" Jak burst in.\n\nHis father's face lighted up. \"Have you tried it yet?\" he asked Jon.\n\n\"No,\" The boy's face showed disappointment. \"Mom wouldn't let me\ntake any chances when I first wanted to, but now I'm glad--it's very\nhighly radioactive still, in spite of who knows how many half-life\ndeteriorations. It might've blown us higher than up. Maybe, though,\nwhen you get better we can study....\"\n\n\"If we haven't got a small lead box, you ought to be able to make one,\"\nhis father broke in. \"You could probably handle a small quantity of\nit that way, to bring it in so we can study it. Maybe, though,\" as an\nafterthought, \"if it's that strong, you'd better wait for me to help\nbefore trying any of it in the generators.\"\n\n\"It's in little cubes, a bit smaller than our copper pellets. That's\nwhy I'm so sure it's a fuel, and that it was put here by some sort of\npeople who had advanced space travel a long, long time ago.\" Jon was\nstill excited. \"We figure all we have to do is finish laying out the\ntown here, and then we can start back for Terra and put your claim\nbefore the Colonial Board,\" Jon said. \"Of course, we all hoped and\nexpected you'd be well enough to check what we've done....\"\n\n\"But we tried to follow all the items in the papers the Board gave us,\"\nJak added seriously. \"And now you're well, we can make sure....\"\n\n\"You father is far from well yet,\" their mother broke in, her voice\nimperative. \"We are all so happy he's awake at last, but I can see he's\nvery weak and that all this excitement has been almost too much for\nhim. You boys say 'Good night' to him now, and then run off and eat\nyour dinner, and let him sleep. Tomorrow evening you can finish your\nreport.\"\n\nReluctantly the boys obeyed, and went into their living quarters and to\nthe table.\n\n\"Golly, I should think Pop'd want to hear all about it now.\" Jon\nfrowned with disappointment.\n\n\"He does, don't you worry,\" Jak tried to cheer him. \"I should have\nwatched him more closely to see we didn't excite or overtire him, but\nI was just as happy and eager as you were. He'll be stronger after\nanother good long sleep, but we've got to be careful not to expect too\nmuch of him for some time yet.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know you're right.\" Then Jon's face lighted with relief. \"But\nit's sure swell to have him awake so we can talk to him and he can take\ncharge of things again. You did a grand job, Owl, bringing him through.\"\n\n\"That's another thing, you big bum. You go handing out praise like that\nagain, and I'll bust you one.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeh, and who was the parrotfish talking up so big the few little\nthings I did?\"\n\nJak came over and threw his arm across the shoulders of his taller but\nyounger brother. \"Both of us were so carried away by our enthusiasm we\nforgot to belittle each other,\" he said sagely. \"Maybe we do sort of\nlike each other, after all.\"\n\nJon pushed him away with rough tenderness, but his eyes were\nsuspiciously moist. His words, though, were an attempted snort, as he\npicked up his knife and fork.\n\n\"What do you want--the next waltz?\"\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nWhen the boys came into the dinette the next morning, their mother was\nhumming happily as she prepared breakfast, and greeted them with a\ncheery smile.\n\n\"Pop awake yet?\" Jon asked as he saw her mood.\n\n\"No, but he's sleeping so sweetly I know he's all right,\" she answered.\n\nThey sat down and began eating. After finishing, Jak said, \"Well, we\nmight as well go out and work some more on our townsite.\"\n\n\"Call us when Pop wakes up, will you, please?\" Jon took a last sip of\nhis juice-concentrate.\n\n\"That'd be silly.\" Jak frowned. \"We know he can't come and help us, so\nwhy should we run several miles back here when we can see him when we\nget back?\"\n\nJon opened his mouth to reply, his eyes flashing almost angrily, but\ntheir mother interrupted quickly with a question, \"Boys, just why do\nyou have to lay out such a site?\"\n\n\"The Board requires it,\" Jon answered shortly.\n\n\"In the early days of exploration,\" Jak explained more patiently, \"some\nof the space crews used to make their reports after merely flying above\nthe surface of the planets of a new system. In fact, some of them\ndidn't even go that close, and merely made up sketchy reports.\"\n\n\"Then when colonists got there,\" Jon, who had simmered down by now,\ntook up the explanation, \"they often found conditions very different,\nand many times quite dangerous to them.\"\n\n\"Yes, sometimes there were even intelligent inhabitants who hadn't been\nreported, so their planets couldn't be used for colonization. So the\nBoard made this new ruling,\" Jak continued. \"Now we have to have so\nmany photos taken from various heights and at different places all over\nthe surface of each planet, and each moon more than one hundred miles\nin diameter. And we have to lay out a townsite on the most Earthlike\nplanet, mostly to show we actually have been there and spent some time\nthere....\"\n\n\"And it really doesn't make any difference whether the people who'll\ncome here to live use it or not....\"\n\n\"But we think they will use ours because we selected a place close to a\nriver and the ocean, close to forests and fairly near minerals.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have done a wonderful job, I know that much about it.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll go out and re-check our lines,\" Jon said. \"I've been\nstudying and experimenting with the theodolite, and I can....\"\n\n\"What is that?\" she asked.\n\n\"What's what? Oh, the 'theodolite'? That's the surveyor's telescope.\nI've learned enough about it so I can tell if our lines have been run\nstraight, and as we were so careful in measuring the distances, I'm\nquite sure they're fairly accurate.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jak chimed in, \"I'll bet none of them are more than an inch off,\nif that.\"\n\n\"Optimist,\" Jon scoffed. \"I'd take that bet away from you, only it'd be\ncheating an infant.\"\n\nJak started a retort, then thought better of it, and shut up.\n\nThey left the ship soon, Jon carrying the surveying instrument over his\nshoulder, and Jak the marker-pole. Arrived at the nearest corner of\ntheir townsite, Jon set the instrument down, while Jak went on to the\nnext stake.\n\nBy means of the graduated circle attached just below the telescope,\nand the plumb line suspended from it, Jon adjusted the collapsible\nlegs until he felt sure it was correctly focussed. Then, as Jak went\nahead from stake to stake, Jon took sights to make sure each marker\nwas centered on his cross hairs. The ones that were not, he indicated\nby hand signals, and Jak reset them to left or right, until Jon was\nsatisfied.\n\nThey completed all of one side before lunch, then returned to the ship.\nThey found their mother had opened both lockdoors while they were gone,\nand fresh, crisp, though warm, air was circulating through the ship,\nblowing out the old chemically pure yet \"stale-feeling\" air their\npurifiers had been re-circulating for so long.\n\nTheir father was awake, but still so weak he was making no attempt\nto sit fully up in bed, although his wife had slipped an extra pillow\nbeneath his head.\n\n\"Ho, fellows!\" he greeted the boys as they came into the bunkroom.\n\"How's the job coming?\"\n\n\"Just fine, Pop.\"\n\n\"We have the townsite all laid out, and now we're checking to make sure\nthe lines are straight,\" Jak told him.\n\nHe frowned a bit. \"How did you manage it? Neither of you is a surveyor.\nOr have you learned how to do that, too?\"\n\n\"I think I've figured out the theodolite well enough to tell if our\nlines are straight, and that's what we're using now,\" Jon continued. \"I\ncan't measure distances with it, though.\"\n\nJak explained more in detail how they had measured the blocks and\nstreet widths, and rechecked them all.\n\n\"I can't see why it won't pass,\" their father said when they finished.\n\"Probably no one will ever check it, unless they actually use the site\nwhen the colonists come. It shows we were landed here long enough to do\nthe work, and that's the important thing. What about the rest of the\nmapping?\"\n\n\"I'll go get the papers.\" Jon ran out, to return in a few minutes with\nthe book of reports, and the rolls of film and prints they had made on\nall the planets and satellites. \"You can check these as you feel up to\nit, Pop, and anything that looks wrong we can go back and re-check or\ndo over.\"\n\nMr. Carver riffled quickly through the pages, and saw that each\nquestion had been answered; each measurement given an answer--though\nwhether correct or not, of course, he could not know. All the\ninformation required had been supplied, at least.\n\nHe gave the boys his old-time grin, even as he was shaking his head in\nwonder. \"You chaps certainly have done a job. Looks like I'll have to\ntake the backseat from now....\"\n\n\"_No!_\" The two boys were shocked by that.\n\n\"Not on your life, Pop! We maybe did fairly well, but we need you, just\nthe same.\"\n\n\"I'll say we do,\" Jak chimed in. \"There's so much yet you can teach us.\nWhy, we've only begun learning most of the things we want to know.\"\n\nMr. Carver smiled up at his sons. \"I'm always glad to tell you anything\nI can, Fellows. It's good to see you growing up, though.\" He turned his\nhead to face Jon more directly. \"What's that about a new system you\nrigged up so you can land and take off with only one switch?\"\n\nJon explained, and the two were soon deep in technical talk of\nelectronic relays and cells, and automatic switch-overs. Finally, Mrs.\nCarver came in with a tray of lunch for her husband, and told the boys\ntheir food was on the table.\n\n\"All right, you chaps, go and eat,\" Mr. Carver said. \"I'll take another\nnap while you're out this afternoon. Then maybe I'll feel up to talking\nsome more this evening, and going over these reports with you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe second day later the boys finished their re-checking, and came\nback to the ship in midafternoon. Their father was again awake, and\nthey went in to see him.\n\n\"We're all done here, Pop, so what say we go back to that fuel-metal\ncache and see about getting the stuff aboard?\" Jon asked.\n\n\"I guess from all you've said that's the most important thing now,\"\nhe agreed after a moment's consideration. \"Only thing is, I've been\nwondering if you couldn't move me into the control room, and fix a\ncouch for me there?\"\n\n\"Sure, that's easy,\" Jak told him.\n\nBut Jon frowned in thought. \"Yes, we can do it, but we'll have to\nfigure out first how to fasten the cot down and then make some\narrangement so you can stand any acceleration we may have to use.\"\n\n\"How about fixing the co-pilot's seat into a bunk?\"\n\n\"Hey, that's the ticket!\" Jon brightened. He ran out and soon was\nhelping his mother gather blankets, sheets and pillows, and going with\nJak to bring an extra mattress from the storeroom.\n\nThey set the seat to recline, and then while Mrs. Carver was making up\nthe bed, the boys carried their father--a much lighter load now than\nwhen he had first been hurt--and put him in his new bed.\n\n\"Say, this is all right!\" Mr. Carver exclaimed after Jon had lowered\nthe co-pilot's visiplate so his father could look into it without\ndistortion or neck-craning. \"All the comforts of home.\" He grinned at\nhis wife.\n\nShe stooped and kissed him. \"Be sure and let us know any time you get\ntoo tired, though, Mr. C.\"\n\n\"I will, Honey,\" he assured her. \"But actually, I'm so comfortable\nI don't see why I can't stay here as well as in bed, until the leg's\nstrong enough to start getting up.\"\n\nEverything else ready, he watched anxiously, then admiringly, as Jon\nstarted the tubes firing, balanced them and took them off with the\nthrowing of his one switch. In his visiplate the elder man watched with\nintense interest the scenery over which they were passing--Jon had set\ncourse so they would go completely around this world of Two until they\ncame to that desert. Mr. Carver made many enthusiastic comments about\nthis splendid planet that now bore his wife's name.\n\n\"Yes, and Three's just as nice, only colder,\" Jon reported eagerly.\n\"Folks who like cold weather can live there without too much trouble at\nall.\"\n\n\"It's funny, though,\" Jak declared with a frown, \"that there's no\nprotoplasmic life there at all. That we could find,\" he hastened to add.\n\n\"Lots of vegetation, though,\" Jon added. \"That means the soil will be\ngood for growing things, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It certainly sounds like it.\" His father smiled. \"The colonists may\nhave to adapt their Earth-seeds to fit, and probably bring their own\nworms and bees and so on. But they should be able to farm there. From\nyour surveys, it appears there are plenty of minerals so they can start\nmines and factories of all kinds right away. Yes, this looks like a\npretty good solar system.\"\n\n\"You bet, Pop. You sure picked a winner in this one,\" Jon's eyes\ngleamed with satisfaction.\n\n\"I had an idea, from the spectroscopic examinations we made 'way back\nthere near Sirius, that we'd find it fairly good here. But, to be\nhonest, I didn't dare hope it would be this good. To tell the truth, I\nwas really more interested in that line which seemed to indicate that\nfuel-stuff, than I was in new planets for colonization, although we\nneeded those, too, to make the trip pay off.\"\n\nBefore long they came above the beginning of that well-remembered\ndesert, and Jon slowed and circled, preparatory to landing.\n\nJon kept his eyes upon his instruments, and when he saw they were close\nto the actual latitude and longitude, he killed the speed to their\nslowest cruising range, and their height to a few hundred yards. When\nhe knew he was almost at the exact spot, he stared intently into his\npilot's magnifying visiplate, at the same time keeping his fingers\ntautly on the landing switch.\n\nSoon, in his plate, he saw the top of that cache cover in the nearing\ndistance. He circled until he judged he could land close to it, then\nclosed the switch.\n\nSoftly, easily, the space-yacht came in to a landing on the hard packed\nsand, and Jon shut off the power and put everything in neutral.\n\nHis father had wisely kept silent during this maneuvering, but now he\nlet out his breath in a _whoosh_.\n\n\"That's the neatest landing I ever saw,\" he told Jon admiringly. \"That\ngadget of yours will make you a young fortune when we get it back to\nTerra.\"\n\nJon actually blushed with pleased embarrassment. \"Aw, it's....\"\n\nBut Jak interrupted him almost fiercely. \"Don't go playing coy,\nChubby. You know darned well it's wonderful.\"\n\n\"Sure I do.\" Jon laughed then, and the rest joined in. \"But you'd have\ntromped on me if I'd been the one to say so.\" He turned quickly to face\nhis father. \"What do we do about this?\"\n\n\"_Ummm._ My suggestion would be for you to put on your suit and go out\nand open those covers you told me about. Give me the analyzer first,\nand I'll study the stuff's emanations when you get it uncovered.\"\n\n\"I'll go out,\" Jak offered quickly. \"You and Jon had better study it\ntogether. I don't know anything about it, but the kid does, and he'll\nbe the one to handle it until you're well.\"\n\n\"Better take the jack--that cover's heavy, remember?\" Jon said, and Jak\nran out.\n\n\"I'd never have been able to do anything if it hadn't been for Jak's\nwiser advice,\" Jon said honestly as he brought the analyzer to his\nfather from the instrument rack. \"I'm apt to go off half-cocked, you\nknow.\"\n\nMr. Carver looked fondly up at his wife, who moved quickly to his side,\nand put her hand against his cheek. \"A couple of grand fellows you\nraised, Darling,\" he said softly.\n\n\"_We_ raised, you mean, Mr. C.\" She smiled down at him. \"They fight all\nthe time, but when it comes to the pinch, they work together and I know\nthey really love and admire each other very much.\"\n\nJon chuckled and spoke into the mike. \"The folks are taking our good\nnames in vain, Owl.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard them,\" came back the elder boy's voice from the speaker.\n\"If they only knew what we really think of each other,\" and then\nfollowed his attempt at a sneering laugh.\n\nIn their visiplates those inside the ship could see Jak, in his\nspacesuit, trotting awkwardly across the sand toward the cache. He\ncarried the jack, and when he got there, used it to raise the heavy\ncover and throw it back. He jumped into the hole and took the cover off\nthe smaller box. Then scrambled quickly out and ran some distance away.\n\n\"Shall I come back now, or wait here to cover it again?\" he asked over\nhis suit-sender.\n\n\"Maybe you'd better wait out there a few minutes,\" his father replied\ninto the mike attached to his seat. \"If we can't figure out something\nin a fairly short time, I'll tell you and you can recap the boxes and\ncome back.\"\n\nHe busied himself adjusting the analyzer, and he and young Jon studied\nthe lines carefully for quite a time. Finally the father roused.\n\n\"This is going to take a lot of study and work,\" he told his younger\nson. Then he spoke into the mike. \"Better come back in, Jak.\" He turned\nhis head again to face the boy with him. \"Did you find a lead box, Jon?\"\n\n\"No, sir, we haven't anything like that in our stores,\" Jon answered.\n\"But there is quite a roll of lead foil. Can we do anything with that?\"\n\n\"How much is there? And how thick is it?\"\n\n\"The foil's twenty inches wide and about twelve feet long,\" Jon\nreported as he came back after a quick run to the storeroom to measure\nthe foil. He had delayed a moment or two at the lock to help Jak out of\nhis suit. \"It's a thirty-second thick.\"\n\n\"_Hmmm._ That's not so good. Let's see. If we quadrupled it, that would\ngive us an eighth ... no, that's not enough. Better take a piece and\nfold it to at least eight thicknesses, then go wrap it around a piece\nof that metal and bring it into the lock.\"\n\n\"That's not too much protection if the stuff's so strong, is it, Pop?\"\n\n\"Well, double that, then. But I think it'll keep the rays off you long\nenough to bring it in--especially since you'll be in your suit, and if\nyou put on lead-lined gloves.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Jon started out, then turned back. \"What about the rest of\nit when we leave? Do we take it all with us?\"\n\n\"No,\" slowly. \"I doubt if anyone else would find it and steal it before\nwe get back. On the other hand, the more we can take back with us,\nsupposing we learn how to use it and it's as good as we think, the more\nwe could get for it on Terra to give another immediate stake to come\nback.\"\n\n\"I have a thought, Pop. Why not just weld-fasten the whole big box it's\nnow in to the outside of the ship, and make a small box that'll hold\nsome to bring into the ship to experiment with?\" Jon's eyes blazed\neagerly.\n\n\"That's a thought!\" Jak exclaimed, while their father answered more\nslowly, \"Yes, I believe that could be done safely, especially if we\nput it back near the stern. Is the ship close enough so the lock\nservo-mechs can bring in the big box?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Jon answered after a searching look out of the\nport-window. \"But with our suits on, Jak and I could carry it, couldn't\nwe?\"\n\n\"We've been close to the stuff several times for about as long as it'd\ntake,\" Jak added, \"and it doesn't seem to have hurt us any.\"\n\n\"Kind of a large box, isn't it?\" Mr. Carver asked quizzically. \"Might\nbe sort of heavy.\"\n\nThe boys flushed, and Jon picked up his slide rule and did some quick\nfiguring. Then he announced, crestfallen, \"Great mackerel, I sure went\noff half-baked that time. OK, I'll take the ship up and bring it down\ncloser.\"\n\n\"That's mighty delicate maneuvering.\" His mother looked at him in\nastonishment. \"Sure you can do it?\"\n\nJon shrugged. \"If I can't the first time, I'll try again.\"\n\nHis father had to smile at the boy's confidence in himself, but he\nmerely said, \"This I've got to watch.\"\n\nAssured everyone was safely strapped in, Jon started the tubes firing,\nraised the ship into the air--watching his plate closely as he circled\nabout--then came down again ... right beside and not over five feet\nfrom port-lock to box.\n\n\"That's perfect,\" his father cried delightedly, watching in his plate.\n\"You're sure getting to be an expert pilot, Son.\"\n\n\"And you're getting too excited and too tired from all this, Tad,\" Mrs.\nCarver said determinedly. \"We'll have no more of it today. You boys go\ninto the living room, and you, Mr. C., relax and take a nap. We can't\nhave you getting sick again.\"\n\nThe boys started to protest but their father grinned. \"Our mistress'\nvoice, Boys. And she's right, I was trying too much. We're not in that\nbig a hurry. Jon, you and Jak go make a box to hold our specimen.\"\n\nThey left him, and in moments he was asleep from exhaustion.\n\nIn the storeroom, Jon found some pieces of one-inch oak, and Jak\nand he made up their box, finishing just as their mother called\nthem to dinner. It was a six-inch cube, sturdily fastened with\nplenty of screws; strong enough to hold solid osmium. The lead foil\nwas carefully fitted into the interior, and was now twelve layers\nthick--three-eighths of an inch.\n\n\"That ought to do it,\" Jak said, and Jon agreed.\n\n\"Let's go out and fill it after we eat.\" Jak was all eagerness.\n\nJon shook his head. \"Not unless Pop says to. Now that he's awake, I\njust don't like to make decisions.\"\n\nJak grinned. \"You're right, of course. Guess we got too big-headed,\nhaving to do things ourselves while he was unconscious.\"\n\n\"Yes, we're still pretty inexperienced, and I'm glad we don't have to\nfigure things out now.\"\n\n\"Still, we can't go back to depending too much on him,\" Jak said\nthoughtfully. \"That way, we'll never get the habit of thinking for\nourselves, and deciding--and that would be bad. But about this, I agree\nfully,\" he added quickly as he saw his brother about to protest.\n\n\"Even if I don't know much about it, I can see that this stuff's\ndangerous to monkey with.\"\n\nTheir father awakened later, much refreshed by his nap. After the boys\nhad explained and exhibited their new box, he agreed it would be all\nright for them to go out and get a single piece of the metal.\n\n\"Leave it in the lock, though,\" he added. \"Then, in the morning, maybe\nI'll feel like helping Jon study and experiment with it.\"\n\nThe two boys ran to get into their suits, and soon were outside,\ncarrying their lead-lined box. They jumped into the large cache box\nafter lifting off the lid, and took the top from the inner one. They\nset the carrier beside it, then ran back to the ship. With the \"distant\nhands,\" Jon flipped a nugget into the small box, and set it aside on\nthe sand. Using the same servo-mechanism, he closed both covers. Then\nhe brought the little box back and deposited it on the floor of the\nlock.\n\nThe two boys took off their suits and hung them in the wall closet,\nthen went into the control room.\n\n\"You were right, Pop. We sure couldn't have handled the big box at\nall.\" Jon grinned, still panting. \"Even the little one is really heavy\nwith just one nugget in it.\"\n\nHis father grinned back. \"I had an idea, but thought I'd let you learn\nthe hard way. Now maybe you'll remember it longer.\"\n\n\"Anyway, we got it in the lock, and tomorrow, if you feel up to it, we\ncan start experimenting.\"\n\n\"Just how big are the pellets?\"\n\n\"A little over half the size of our treated-copper ones,\" Jon told him.\n\n\"We'll have to cut it before we try working with it.\"\n\nJak, having disposed of the used plastic from their suits, had come\ninto the control room and was listening interestedly, as was their\nmother, who was hovering near, not quite sure she liked the idea of her\nmenfolks fussing with this unknown but admittedly dangerous metal.\n\n\"That means we'll have to make and install a smaller injector, too,\ndoesn't it?\" Jon asked. And when his father nodded, he added \"I'll see\nabout making it.\"\n\n\"Later, when we've found out whether we can use the stuff. Right now\nwe'd all better get some sleep. I'm bushed, and I imagine you chaps\nare, too. How about you, Marci?\" Mr. Carver turned to his wife.\n\n\"Well, I could use some sleep,\" she admitted.\n\n\"Right, Pop. Good night. 'Night, Mom.\"\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nEarly the next morning the boys were clamoring to get started, but\ntheir mother would not let them go into the control room.\n\n\"Now you listen to Mother,\" she protested, using a favorite phrase of\nhers. \"Your father hasn't made any sign yet. You wait until he's awake\nand has had something to eat. I know how anxious you are to do all\nthese things, but you must remember he isn't strong yet, and we must\nnot let him overdo. He is as much a child about such things as you two\nare, but someone has to watch him.\"\n\nThe boys laughed rather shamefacedly. \"It's just we get so interested\nin things, Mom,\" Jon apologized.\n\n\"Yes, I know. But if you will look in your dictionary, you will find a\nword called 'moderation.'\" She smiled.\n\n\"Never heard of it.\" Jon grinned as he went to get a reelbook on\nradioactives, and began studying. Jak, too, went back to studying and\ntrying to classify the various specimens he had obtained from the two\nworlds. However, they soon remembered their usual duties--and whisked\nthrough their various chores about the ship, then went back to their\nabsorbing occupations.\n\nThey had been at these nearly an hour when they heard their father's\nvoice. Dropping everything, they sprang toward the control room, and\nfound him wide-awake and looking much better. Mrs. Carver came running\nin, and they were told, \"Feel fine. This is a wonderful bed. Seem to be\nmuch stronger today, too.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful, Mr. C. I'll go get you some breakfast.\"\n\nJon ran for a basin of water and towels, and he and Jak helped their\nfather with his toilet.\n\n\"While you're eating, Pop, how about me cutting off that piece of the\nnew metal so we can start studying it?\"\n\n\"How big a piece were you figuring on?\" Mr. Carver asked with that\nquizzical look.\n\nJon flushed and mentally changed the size he had planned to get. \"About\na gram?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'd say more like a few milligrams.\" His father grinned. \"That's\nplenty for our initial studies and analyses, and shouldn't hurt us any\nif we're careful and wear insulation.\"\n\n\"But that's only a pin-head size.\"\n\n\"Well?\" again quizzically.\n\nJon flushed once more. \"Yes, that's big enough to test, I realize now.\nIt's a good thing I waited for you to help me. I'd probably have burned\nmyself but bad. Actually,\" he smiled now, \"I was figuring on about a\nquarter of a pellet.\"\n\nHis father frowned. \"You should have known better than that, Jon. I\nthought I'd taught you something about being careful, and the dangers\nof rashness or impulsiveness. Especially around anything as dangerous\nas this stuff undoubtedly is.\"\n\n\"You did, sir, and I'm sorry. But I forget sometimes, when I get too\nenthusiastic.\"\n\n\"Well,\" philosophically, \"you'll probably learn as you grow\nolder ... if you live that long!\" But again there was that disarming\ngrin, which Jon repaid in kind before leaving to get his tools and\ngo after the mite of new metal. This time, he did not neglect his\nprecautions. He wore his suit, and put on a pair of extra-thick,\nlead-impregnated gloves.\n\nCarefully he lifted a pellet from the box, wrapped it in several layers\nof lead foil left after making the box. He carried it so into the\nstoreroom, locked it in a vice, and with a fine hacksaw cut off a tiny\nbit. Still wrapped carefully in the lead foil, he carried the remainder\nof the pellet back to the box in the lock, closed the lid and then took\nthe sample inside. He took off his suit and donned a lead-impregnated,\nhooded gown and the leaded gloves.\n\n\"Good,\" his father said when Jon told what he had done. \"I think I feel\nwell enough to sit up a bit. Suppose you crank this seat halfway up,\nthen I can watch better while you make the tests.\"\n\n\"Just be sure you don't get too tired,\" Jon said solicitously as he\nraised the seat and locked it at half-recline. He had brought in\nanother of the leaded-gowns, and he slipped this over his father's\nhead, arms and upper torso, arranging the balance of it down over his\nblanket-enwrapped legs.\n\nThen, acting on his father's various instructions, he took the particle\nfrom its wrappings and began his tests. He measured the amount of\nradioactivity, and together they computed its half-life.\n\n\"Wow! That sure is high-pressure stuff,\" Jon exclaimed when they had\ncompleted the various tests which they had the equipment to make.\n\nHis father silently motioned him to set the seat back to full recline\nand lay there, concentrating, for some time before he spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said at last, \"it's even higher in the scale than I thought.\nLots higher than Curium, even now. And no telling, by any tests we can\nmake, what it was originally, before its many half-life reductions that\nmust have taken place over the long time it has undoubtedly been lying\nout there. Probably way above anything known, even theoretically, to\nTerran scientists.\"\n\n\"Can we use it?\" Jon was quivering with excitement.\n\n\"If we can figure out a way to do so safely, so it doesn't want to\ndisintegrate all at once, I think we've really got a fuel--a super\nfuel. But we'll have to go at it mighty slow and easy. That stuff could\nblow us higher than up, if used wrongly.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. But after our scientists first liberated atomic energy\nfor their bombs, many people said they couldn't control a hydrogen\nbomb, but they did. And later the thorium bomb. And then they got our\nactivated copper. So I'm betting they can figure this out.\"\n\nBoth fell silent, although there were a dozen eager questions the boy\nwanted so much to ask. But he did not interrupt his father's line of\nthought, even though long, long minutes dragged away while the elder\nstill pondered the problem.\n\nAt last, after more than a quarter of an hour, Tad Carver stirred and\nlooked up. \"This is going to take a long time to figure out,\" he said\nslowly. \"I'm not too much on atomics, myself, and neither are you. Now\nyou run along and do whatever else you have to do. It's a cinch we\nwon't be able to try this stuff right away--if we try it at all.\"\n\nThe disappointment on Jon's face was plain, but he restrained any\nprotests, knowing his father was right, and not wishing to call down on\nhimself another verbal chastisement like that recent one.\n\n\"What about the rest of the stuff?\" he asked instead. \"Shall I get the\nbox out of the cache and weld it onto the hull, as we thought we might\ndo?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not. We want to take it back to Terra with us, whether\nwe figure out how to use it, or decide the job's too big for us and\nturn it over to the scientists there to handle.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Jon went over to the controls of the handling arms in the\nlock. Watching in the special visiplate, he opened the outer lockdoor,\nextended the \"hands\" and guided them down into the cache, after using\nthem to lift the lid off the larger pit-box.\n\nCarefully he manipulated them to grasp the inner box by its lower\nend-edges, and experimentally lift it an inch or so. Finding that it\nbalanced, he slowly made the servo-mechanism lift the heavy container\nfrom its ages old resting place and up onto the \"top\" surface of the\nship, near the stern. Making sure it was securely held there, he put on\nhis suit, gathered up his welding outfit, and went outside and climbed\nonto the hull.\n\nGoing to where the box rested, he began the task of welding its bottom\nback-edge onto the metal hull. Then he released the grip of the\nhandlers and, leaving them dangling in the air, welded the other three\nbottom edges.\n\nFinished, he turned off his torch, rose to his feet and started back.\nBut after a step or two he stopped and thought.\n\n\"Pop,\" he said into his suit-radio, \"do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jon,\" the answer came back at once into his earphones. \"What is\nit?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea to spot-weld a few\nplaces along the edges of the cover, too, so there'd be less chances of\nits coming open. It'd be easy to open it later.\"\n\n\"How's it fastened now?\"\n\n\"Just a simple hasp.\"\n\n\"Better touch it in a few places, then, to make sure.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nWhen this was done, Jon returned inside the ship, and saw to it that\nall the equipment was put back in place and carefully locked. Only then\ndid he doff his suit and return to the control room.\n\n\"Well, that's done. What now?\"\n\n\"Anything else you need to do here on this planet?\"\n\n\"No-o-o, not that I know of. Why?\"\n\n\"I was thinking that if everything has been taken care of, we might as\nwell start back to Terra. No use staying any longer than is necessary.\"\n\n\"I ... I think we've done everything. Have you checked the record book\nand the pictures?\"\n\n\"No, not fully. And I probably should, before we take off, at that. But\nI think I'd better have another nap or rest now, so I'll go over them\nafter a while. Put them on the table here, so I can reach them.\"\n\n\"Right, sir. You take plenty of time to rest. If Jak's not too busy to\ngo with me, I think I'll go fishing in the river, out there by the edge\nof the desert. Maybe we can get quite a haul to take with us, for fresh\nfood on the trip.\"\n\n\"Good idea. Your mother said they were delicious.\"\n\nWhen the two boys returned with full creels late that afternoon, they\nwent at once to see how their father was getting along. He was awake,\nand studying the records they had made.\n\n\"Hi, fellows! Everything seems to be in fine shape. You chaps certainly\ndid a job while I was _non compos_. Get any fish?\"\n\n\"Lots of them. They sure bite swell here. Maybe because no one has ever\nfished them before, and they have no idea of lures and hooks.\"\n\n\"Then let's just rest and eat and sleep, and plan to take off in the\nmorning, eh?\"\n\n\"You bet. I'll sure be glad to get back home again,\" Jak declared.\n\"This chasing around is fun, but I'm homesick for Terra, I guess.\"\n\n\"Me, too, kind of. Besides, I want to get some more schooling at one of\nour atomic institutes,\" Jon added more slowly.\n\n\"Going to give up inter-stellar exploration, Son?\" his father asked\ndrily.\n\n\"No, sir. But I figured we'd have to stay on Terra for a year or so\nwhile you get everything straightened out about this discovery, and get\nthe ship ready for the next trip. So while you're doing that, I might\nas well be trying to learn something more.\"\n\n\"We will, and you should. And I presume,\" he turned to face Jak, \"you\nwant to study medicine?\"\n\n\"That, and other things,\" the elder boy responded soberly. \"If we can\nafford it, sir, I'd like to get several top men in various branches to\ngive me some special coaching, instead of going to a school. That would\nget me started straight, and they could recommend good books for me to\nbe studying while we're on our future trips.\"\n\nTheir father looked up at his wife with a smile. \"What's happened to\nour babies, Marci?\"\n\n\"They've just grown up, Mr. C.--but we have some pretty wonderful men\nin their place.\" Her eyes shone. \"It was pretty hard, at first, after\nyou got hurt and they had to take charge of everything, to realize\nthat they had grown away from us. But I soon found that they hadn't,\nreally,\" she continued hastily as the boys gave cries of dismay. \"They\nhave matured wonderfully, but we have not lost our boys at all.\"\n\n\"Well I should say not!\" Jak cried hotly.\n\n\"We're still kids, not men,\" Jon declared. \"Why, there's still so much\nto learn--and experience to gain--we've barely started growing up.\"\n\n\"You can keep learning back on Terra,\" their mother said. \"As for me,\nI'm glad we're going to be there a year or more. I want to live in a\nhouse again, on land I know.\"\n\n\"Then we'd all better get to bed,\" their father said with his old-time\nroguish smile. \"Otherwise we'll all be too fagged out to take off for\nhome tomorrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as breakfast was finished the next morning the Carvers all\nassembled in the control room for the start back to Terra.\n\nJon had already made the astrogational calculations for their trip,\nhaving worked on them off and on during many evenings of the past\nseveral weeks.\n\nBut just as they were all strapping down, his father stopped Jon with\na sudden exclamation. \"Wait, Son! I think we'd better go back close\nenough to all the planets and the sun to make sure all the signals are\nworking right. That's one of the most important things the Colonial\nBoard will check.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure they're OK, Pop. We listened to each one after we'd\nplaced it.\"\n\n\"But cases have been known where a sender failed--especially those on\nextremely hot or exceptionally cold planets. I'm not doubting that you\nhandled them all right--it's just that I think it worth the time and\neffort to check them and make sure while we're still out here.\"\n\n\"All right, you're the captain.\" Jon opened the drawer in the control\ndesk and hunted out the sheets on which he had figured his former\nflight plans to the various planets.\n\n\"We won't need to land if the signals are working,\" his father said.\n\"Just get us close enough in line so we can receive the messages.\"\n\n\"In that case, we can fly almost by sight, merely taking into\nconsideration the direction and speed of the planets.\" Jon shoved\nhis papers back into the drawer. \"Let's see ... we'll make the best\ntime going to One, then the Sun, then Three, Four and Five, and then\ncircling about and heading for home.\"\n\n\"Fine! Get going.\"\n\n\"Strap down, everybody.\"\n\nA quick glance to see that they were all secure, then Jon closed\nthe master switch of his new interlocking controls. Smoothly, with\nincreasing acceleration, the _Star Rover_ lifted upward through the\natmosphere on the planet Marci--Carveria Two.\n\nEver more swiftly it flew, and a special sort of gladness was in each\nheart at the thought that soon they would be once more speeding toward\ntheir home on far distant Terra.\n\nTraveling about the universe, seeing new suns, new planets, new and\ninteresting--even though alien, and sometimes dangerous--forms of\nlife of various kinds, all this was a constant source of interest\nand delight. Still there was within each of them, even Tad Carver, a\nlove of and a longing for the planet that had given them birth. Men\nhad always found it so--it was probable that men born on Terra always\nwould. Probable, too, that men born on other planets would always long\nfor a return to _their_ mother world.\n\nIt took a special type of person to become a colonist on another\nand alien planet. Much the same type of pioneer as those\ngreat-grandparents, many times removed, who had made the terrible\njourney across the western plains and mountains of Noramer to conquer\nthe great, wealth-producing West, and _their_ forefathers and mothers\nwho had braved the perilous and unknown oceans to come from the Old to\nthe New World in Colonial days, to search for freedom and opportunity.\n\nIt had been found that, even among those willing to make the sacrifices\nand uprootings necessary to become colonists on other worlds, there\nwere always a few who realized they could not stand it, after all.\nThese unfortunate people usually returned to Terra--if they had the\nfunds to do so. Nor did it seem to matter how much this new planet was\nlike Earth, nor how great the opportunities for gaining wealth and\nprestige. It was that inner feeling of always _remembering_ that they\nwere so far from home and everything and everyone they had formerly\nknown and loved.\n\nTad Carver was a true \"son of wanderlust.\" He had the itching foot;\nthe urge to travel; the zest for new places, new scenes, new outlooks.\nBut even he, after a certain time away, felt that indefinable yet\nexceedingly strong _must_ to return to his home world for a while.\n\nThe boys were young, which meant they were eager for new experiences,\nwhether on their own or other worlds. They had not yet come to an age\nwhere Terra meant a great deal to them. Life was so thrilling, so\ninteresting--there was so much to see and do. Yet even they did feel\nnostalgia after too long an absence.\n\nIt was Marci Carver who felt it most--this longing, this _need_ for\nthe old home. While it is true that her great love for her husband and\nsons made \"home\" for her any place in the universe where they might\nbe, yet she had no real interest in exploration, no great desire or\neven curiosity to see other lands or other worlds. The deeps of space\nbrought such an _awe_ to her that they almost made her afraid. No, if\nher menfolk had been satisfied there, she would never have dreamed of\nleaving Earth. She would have been perfectly content to live in one\ntown or city all her life--in the same house, even. She did not have\nthe pioneer spirit; did not in the least desire new scenes. Her home\nand her man and boys--these were all she asked of life.\n\nYet she did have the rare knack of making any place where she might be,\nhome. She could make a mansion or a hovel--or this spaceship--seem such\na perfect home to her men that they were perfectly happy and contented\nwith their living quarters. It was not a matter of furnishings or their\narrangement--not just material things like pictures, books, pillows or\nother knickknacks placed just so. Rather it was the \"spirit of home\"\nwith which she impregnated every place in which her family might be\nliving at the moment.\n\nThe boys had not yet noticed this consciously--they were so filled\nwith the joy of living and doing and learning that they had not yet\nstopped to think about such matters. But Tad Carver recognized it, and\nloved his wife all the more because of her ability.\n\nHe often remarked of her, \"put her in even a hotel room for ten\nminutes, and she'll make it home for me.\" He sometimes felt moments of\nguilt that he made her chase around so much, instead of letting her\nstay in one place--and remaining with her there. But he could not stay\nput--and he knew she would not want to remain any place without him.\n\nThat was why he had arranged things so she and the boys could travel\nwith him. And, until he had been hurt and she, with the boys, had had\nto take over his duties, she had seldom left the ship while on other\nplanets, although she always looked out through port or visiplate in\nthe various places where they had gone, with the keen interest in\nanything new that made her such a delightful traveling companion.\n\nSo now all four felt that eagerness to be done with this matter of\nlast-minute re-checkings, so they could be on their way back to Terra.\nIt made the time pass swiftly--yet made it so draggingly prolonged, it\nseemed they would never reach their destination.\n\nThe ship soon reached an acceleration of two Earth gravities, and Jon\nasked, \"Is this fast enough, Pop, or can you stand more?\"\n\n\"You might step it up to three G's for an hour. There's no use loafing\naround here longer than necessary to make the curve so we can come\nfairly near each planet on the line between it and Terra.\"\n\n\"And that'll get us up to cruising speed quicker when we do start the\nstraight stretch for home,\" Jon said, and turned back to his controls\nto apply another notch of speed.\n\nIt was not long before they approached Planet One--\"Tad.\" Jon had\nplotted a course that would take them to within about thirty thousand\nmiles of the little, hot planet, on the Earthward side. As they flashed\npast it, their receiver clearly picked up the broadcast of their\nsignal-unit.\n\n\"That one's all right,\" their father said in a pleased voice, and Jon\nlooked up and back from his calculations on the orbit to circle them\nabout the sun, to grin his pleasure at the approval.\n\n\"Jak put it on top of a peak in the intermediate zone,\" he explained.\n\"The weather--if you can call it weather--there is more nearly normal\nthan either on the sunward or the spaceward side.\"\n\nAn hour later Jak struggled up from his chair, staggering beneath\nthe triple weight of his body at that acceleration. Seeing him, Jon\ncalled, \"Wait, Owl, I'm just about to reduce to two G's.\" And in a\nmoment the older boy found it easier to get the sandwiches and bottles\nof nourishing broth their mother had prepared before take-off, and\ndistribute them to the others. Gratefully, they all ate and drank.\n\n\"After we circle the sun and are en route to Three, I'll cut down to\none gravity while we have a real meal,\" Jon promised.\n\n\"Aw, let's not slow down just for ...\" Jak began.\n\n\"It won't cut our speed, just our acceleration, which means 'constantly\nadded' speed,\" his father explained good-naturedly. \"As soon as we've\npassed them all and are heading for home, we'll cut to one gravity for\nthe greater part of the trip, but our speed will have been built up\ntremendously.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, I know that, but I forgot for the minute.\"\n\nAs they circled toward the sun Mr. Carver studied it carefully in his\nvisiplate. \"Just about the same type of sun as Sol,\" he said after a\nwhile.\n\n\"That's what I figured, only that it's about one quarter larger and\nheavier,\" Jon told him. \"I was hoping you'd be well enough before we\nleft to check it for me.\"\n\n\"How close did you set your signal-sender orbit here?\"\n\n\"Ten million miles.\"\n\n\"_Ten million!_\" The man gasped, then laughed in relief as he thought\nthe boy was just trying to spoof him. \"Oh, come off it, Jon. How far\nout were you, really?\"\n\n\"Unless my figures are all wrong,\" Jon's voice held a hurt note, \"it\nwas really only ten million miles. You can check my calculations.\nThe book says quote said orbit to be as nearly circular and as close\nto the discovered sun as possible unquote, so I sent us in on a van\nSicklenberg throw-out orbit apexing at ten million.\"\n\n\"Boy, that was really taking a chance. You don't need to repeat it for\nmy benefit.\"\n\n\"I wasn't planning to, sir.\" Jon grinned now. \"We'll go around at about\ntwenty million this time, but the same type of orbit as before.\"\n\n\"That's better. Well, I think I'll go back to sleep. All of us should,\nI suggest.\"\n\n\"Mother has already dropped off,\" Jak said softly, glancing toward the\nrecline seat in which she lay. \"Switch on the auto, Chubby, then douse\nthe glotubes. 'Night, Father.\"\n\nAnd soon the little ship was speeding across the interplanetary wastes,\nguided only by the automatic pilot, while inside four weary people\nslept peacefully, knowing the mechanisms would guide them safely and\nsurely to their distant, plotted destination.\n\nFor, outside of a possible recurrence of the accident that had caused\nMr. Carver's injury--and that was a billions-to-one chance that could\nnot possibly strike them again--what was there to fear away out here?\n\nNevertheless, it was the sudden ringing of an alarm bell that woke them\nall into instant, wondering wakefulness.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\"What in the world?\" Jon's eyes snapped open and immediately began\nscanning the various telltales on the panel, while from the other three\ncame a chorused, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Something out here using atomic energy.\" Jon's surprised voice made\nthem raise their seats quickly to upright, so they could better see for\nthemselves.\n\nMr. Carver hastily adjusted his visiplate to maximum magnification, and\nbegan searching the heavens surrounding them. \"A ship, you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, and quite close.\" And a moment later, aided more surely by his\nmore complex instruments, Jon cried, \"There it is! RA 11; square 17 on\nthe plate.\"\n\nHis father's flying fingers found the object, then narrowed his focus\nof vision and stepped up the magnification. His eyes grew large,\nthen hard and tense, as he studied the close-up image. \"Slik Bogin's\nship--I'd know that anywhere!\" he exclaimed, and the boys looked at him\nin puzzled concern.\n\n\"Then I must have been right, that day I thought I heard a ship,\" Mrs.\nCarver declared.\n\n\"You must have been,\" Jak agreed.\n\n\"But what's Bogin doing out here?\" Jon asked with a touch of fear in\nhis voice.\n\n\"Nothing good, you can bet.\" His father's voice was grimmer than any of\nthem had ever heard it before. \"Any time you run across that pirate,\nyou can lay mighty big odds there's skullduggery afoot.\"\n\n\"Great catfish! He's trying to beat us out of this system.\"\n\n\"I'll lay a thousand to one he is, if he thinks he can get away with\nit.\"\n\n\"What can we do about it, Father?\" There was now a trace of a tremor in\nJak's voice. \"Jon and I have worked so hard to map these planets--how\ncan Bogin possibly do the same and still beat us?\"\n\n\"No telling. He's a slippery cuss, and if he really wants to try\nclaim-jumping, he'll figure out some dirty scheme.\"\n\n\"Can't we get back to Earth ahead of him, Mr. C., and report to the\nColonial Board first?\" Mrs. Carver was almost in tears.\n\nHer husband gave her a tight-lipped smile. \"We'll sure try, Honey.\" His\nforehead creased with a frown of concentration for some minutes, then\nhe faced Jon, who was watching him from the pilot's seat.\n\n\"Bogin's headed in the opposite direction, so no use chasing him to see\nwhat he's doing. Besides, I've heard his ship is armed, and we aren't,\nexcept for our rifles, which are absolutely no good in space. I say,\ncontinue our course, checking our signals, then beat it for home.\nAfter all, we don't _know_ for sure that Bogin's trying anything--and\nour best bet is to finish our job as though nothing had happened, but\nnot waste any time doing it ... just in case.\"\n\n\"Right, Pop. As near as I could tell, we have twice his speed, and we\ndon't need to worry. We have all the data and pictures to prove we're\nthe Prime Discoverers, and we didn't hear any signals to show he's put\nout any senders.\"\n\nBut there was an uneasy and unhappy silence as the little space-yacht\ncontinued to eat up the millions of miles.\n\nTad Carver had intended having his younger son slow down near Planet\nThree and go into an orbit close enough so he could get a good\ngeneralized view of this other Earthlike, though colder, planet. But\nnow he would not do so. Speed and time were essential in getting back\nto Terra. He would try to keep his worries from the others as much as\npossible, but there was a deep foreboding in his mind.\n\nOnly too well he knew the various types of men who braved the\nspaceways, and that many of them were out and out criminals. And this\nSlik Bogin was the most ruthless pirate and cutthroat of them all, from\nreports. There were so many, many crimes charged against him ... though\nit was true that none had ever been proven. Yet such was the man's\nevil reputation that all honest spacemen hated him, even as they were\nsomewhat in fear of him.\n\nMr. Carver was sure that the man's spacer was almost a warship in her\narmament. Nor did he doubt that the master criminal would not hesitate\nto use his heavy rays to blast out of existence anyone he felt was a\nmenace to his nefarious plans.\n\nAnd this new system the Carvers had discovered was a prize well worth\nstealing, if possible. Although Mr. Carver had not seen these splendid\nworlds with his own eyes, he had carefully studied the boys' concise\nand complete reports, and their many detailed pictures, so he knew what\na rich treasure they had struck in finding this sun and its planets and\nmoons.\n\nIt would make him and his family rich beyond their fondest dreams ...\nand he would be worse than flat broke if they lost out on getting their\nclaim approved.\n\nFor Mr. Carver had not told even his wife that all their possessions,\nincluding their ship, were mortgaged for every credit he could secure,\nto enable them to make this costly journey. It was true he had won\ngreat wealth on his previous trips into space--but several of his\nlargest investments on Terra had gone sour, and this was a last\ndesperate chance to recoup his fortune in one intensive campaign.\n\nAs they neared the point in their trajectory that brought them to\nthe Earthward side of Planet Three, Jon began tuning his receiver\nand turning his directional antenna-loops, so he could pick up the\ncontinuous message of their sender. Soon he began hearing words,\nand tuned more closely, stepping up his power. The four sat erect,\nexpectant.\n\nThen their faces blanched and their fists tightened as they heard the\nwords:\n\n\"This sun and system of five planets, of which this is the third, were\ndiscovered and surveyed by Michael Bogin and his crew, on the tenth day\nof January in the Terran year of 2136.\"\n\nOver and over the message was repeated, while the Carvers stared at\neach other in horrified surprise and consternation.\n\nBut Mr. Carver rallied quickly. \"He has changed the tape in your\nsenders, boys. We'll probably find the same on Four and Five, and he's\non his way to Two now to do the same.\"\n\n\"But he'll not be able to change the one we set out around the sun,\nwill he, Pop?\" Jon's voice quavered and broke into a boyish soprano.\n\"He can't get in as close as we did, and still slow down enough to\nretrieve such a small thing, can he?\"\n\n\"I don't see how he could. But he has some darned good technies in that\npirate crew of his. They'll figure out some way to destroy ours and\nsubstitute one of their own, I'll bet. Well, this changes the picture.\nNow we know what he's up to, so we'll just have to get to Terra ahead\nof him, and lay our facts before the Board first.\"\n\n\"They'll take our word against his, won't they, especially since we\nhave such complete records and so many photographs?\" Jak asked, hoping\nto be reassured.\n\n\"There's no telling,\" Mr. Carver spoke slowly, shaking his head. \"If\nBogin is trying to get this claim--and now we know he is--he'll work\nout some way of getting pictures and records, too. We can only hope.\"\n\n\"And pray,\" their mother added determinedly.\n\n\"We'll make out some way,\" Jon tried to cheer them all. \"Meanwhile, I\nsuggest I cut to one G and that Mom fixes us some grub. We have to eat.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" his father agreed, and Jon manipulated his\ncontrols. They all felt the sudden relief of once more being their\naccustomed weight. Mrs. Carver unstrapped herself and left for the\ngalley. Jak also unstrapped, saying, \"I'll go help Mom.\"\n\n\"Ask her to make a pile of sandwiches, too, and to bring plenty of\ndrinks so we can eat later without slowing our acceleration,\" his\nfather called, then added, \"Don't let your mother talk about this. Get\nher mind on something else and keep it there.\"\n\n\"Right, Father.\"\n\n\"This is serious, Jon,\" Mr. Carver said when the two were alone in\nthe control room. \"I don't like to worry any of you any more than's\nnecessary, but our chances aren't too good, now that those signals have\nbeen changed.\"\n\n\"We've got some hope left, though, haven't we?\" came the anxious\ninquiry.\n\n\"I see two fairly good ones--but it all depends on so many factors,\"\nMr. Carver answered after a moment of thought. \"We've got to try to get\nback first and report and show them our records and pictures--which\nare very detailed, thanks to you two boys. Second, we've got to hope\nsomeone back there caught our original signals, and then noticed the\nchange--_if_ they could tell they came from the same system.\"\n\n\"How are you making out under this acceleration?\"\n\n\"All right. I don't seem to be any weaker ... but then, what with all\nthe excitement and disappointment, there may be a relapse. But that's\nnot important....\" Then, hearing his son's gasp of dismay, he continued\nrapidly and grimly, \"No, Jon, really. I mean that, and I want you to\nkeep it in mind at all times on the rest of this trip. I'm expendable,\nif we can prove our case. Not that I intend to die,\" he hastened to add\nwith a grin as Jon started to protest. \"But I'd rather take longer to\nget well and know that you all are provided for the way you should be.\"\n\n\"If we cut for Terra right away, without waiting to go on to Four and\nFive, Bogin couldn't possibly build up speed enough to beat us in,\ncould he?\" Jon questioned anxiously.\n\n\"Not unless his ship's a lot faster than ours. It probably is, because\nhis crew can undoubtedly stand more acceleration, and he'll drive to\nthe limit. But if he stops to change those other signals, I don't see\nhow he can do it. Go ahead, change course, and let's hike for home.\"\n\n\"Right. Let's see, now. Terra's behind and down from where we are and\nthe way we're heading. I'll set us into a circle while we're figuring\nout our course.\"\n\n\"Make it just an approximation for now. We can refine it as we go.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Jon worked swiftly at his computer, then at his controls, and\nthey could feel the gallant little ship begin to strain toward the\nright.\n\n\"Don't try too short a turn,\" his father warned.\n\n\"OK, I'll let up a bit. I was figuring on a two million radius.\"\n\n\"Better make it three for safety.\"\n\nIn time their circling was completed, the new homeward bound course\nfigured. For days the little ship and its anxious crew were on their\nway. Three times each day their acceleration was stepped up to two\nEarth-gravities for a period of four hours, then back to one and a\nquarter for the same period--four on and four off continually, to give\nthem a rest from the burden of doubled weight, and to make it easier to\nprepare and eat their meals, and to do what personal and ship's chores\nhad to be done. In between times, as they could, they slept.\n\nJon had set their receptor and analyzer to react to atomics. It was now\nfanning out behind them in a cone-shaped funnel of force. He hoped by\nthis to be able to tell if Bogin began overtaking them.\n\nOf course, space was so vast, and the distance to Sol and Terra so\ngreat, and their points of trajectory so different, that the pirate\nship might be taking an entirely different course, and not come\nanywhere near them until the two ships were almost home. On the other\nhand, Jon was taking the most direct route--and he was sure Bogin would\nundoubtedly do the same--so they were quite apt to converge sooner or\nlater.\n\nAnd since Jon's receptors covered an ever-larger sphere of space the\nfarther away they reached, he and his father hoped they would be able\nto tell if and when their enemy began catching up with them.\n\nMeantime, the two studied almost continuously together the problem\nof that supposedly new fuel-metal they had discovered on the planet\nMarci--hoping it could be used in their engines. They were sadly\nhandicapped, both because neither was an atomic physicist, and because\ntheir little ship--well-stocked and provided with many instruments as\nit was--did not contain anywhere near all the testing equipment needed\nfor such a delicate and complex and dangerous task.\n\nYet they learned much.\n\nJak took over the routine duties of their flight, after some additional\ninstruction on points about which he was not sure. In between times,\nas the lessened pressure allowed, he studied the new specimens he\nhad collected, saw to it that the ship's hydroponics kept operating\ncorrectly, and did whatever he could to relieve his brother and his\nfather of their ordinary duties so they could devote all their waking\ntime to study and experiment.\n\nTheir mother attended to her housekeeping, and saw to the comfort and\nwell-being of her menfolk.\n\nMr. Carver knew, deep within himself, that he was overdoing,\nconsidering his illness. His partially-healed broken leg so often\npained and throbbed that he had difficulty concealing his hurt from the\nsharp eyes of his family. But he loved his wife and sons so greatly\nthat their future well-being was far more important to him than his\nown, and so he never mentioned these things.\n\nThe sturdy little yacht had covered almost half the tremendous distance\nback to Sol. The Carvers were beginning to let up a bit in their\nanxiety and fears. Surely, each one felt, they were winning the race.\n\nThen suddenly their alarm rang.\n\nThree of them found themselves on their feet, rushing toward the\ncontrol panel.\n\n\"How close are they, Jon?\" their father yelled from his co-pilot's\ncouch.\n\n\"_Mmmm._ I've stepped this up about two hundred per cent.... I figure\nit about half a billion miles.\"\n\n\"Not very far--in space. They must have lots more speed than we do to\nhave caught up with us like that.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" Mrs. Carver grabbed her husband's arm with\ntrembling fingers.\n\nHe turned his head and smiled up at her. \"We'll figure out some way to\nbeat them, Honey,\" he soothed. \"There's lots more can be done yet.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom, they're still a long way behind us.\" Jon tried to keep the\nanxiety out of his voice. \"And you know the old saying, 'a stern chase\nis a long chase.'\"\n\n\"Can't we increase our acceleration and so our speed?\" Jak asked.\n\n\"Yes, we'll have to do that, at least.\" Mr. Carver's voice was grim. He\nlooked at Jon. \"Step it up to two and a half, as soon as you're all in\nyour seats. We'll stay there more of the time from now on, and we'll\nchange the period to six in and two up.\"\n\n\"How about one and a half for the two hours?\"\n\n\"We'll try it. If we sleep or nap more while we're at max, we ought to\nbe able to stand it.\"\n\n\"We're still almost ...\" Jon figured rapidly at the computer, \"...\nthree weeks out of Terra, even at that increased speed.\"\n\nHis father grimaced, while his wife and elder son uttered gasps of\ndismay. \"I know. It'll be tough, but we've _got_ to win.\"\n\nBut after a moment he looked first at his wife, than at Jak. \"This is\nan order,\" he said seriously. \"The minute any of you feel you can't\ntake it any more, say so and we'll cut down, even if we do lose speed.\nI guess I went off half-cocked just now in saying that we had to win.\nOur health is more important....\"\n\n\"Except yours, you're trying to say,\" Jak broke in. \"You haven't been\nsparing yourself any, I notice, and I know enough doctoring to know\nyou're not getting well as fast....\"\n\n\"Pooh, I'm all right, and I'm used to ship accelerations.\" Mr. Carver\nturned his head toward his son and made himself grin. \"Even under these\nthree G's, I can still get up and lick you, even with a half-healed\nleg.\"\n\nJon realized at once that his father was warning him not to worry\ntheir mother any more, and forced himself to reply, pretending to be\nshamefaced, \"Yes, sir, you could at that. I'll be good.\"\n\nBut the next morning, by the ship's chronoms, after they had fully\nawakened from a night of tortured sleep, Jon studied his instruments\nfor some time, then reported to his father, \"Bogin's still catching up.\nHe's only about four hundred million behind us now.\"\n\n\"But how can he possibly be?\" Jak demanded.\n\n\"Probably staying on three G's or better all the time,\" Jon answered.\n\n\"Or else he has a different means of propulsion than we have that\naffects his whole ship and contents, including crew,\" his father said\nslowly. \"I don't know what it could be. But theoretically there are a\nlot of different ways of traveling faster than any we've learned how to\nuse yet.\"\n\n\"But how could they, Mr. C.?\" his wife gasped. \"I don't pretend to know\nmuch about such things, but I thought that better fuels merely meant\nincreased efficiency in the use of the engines, not an increase of\nspeed. Isn't it acceleration that makes the speed faster?\"\n\nHe turned his head with difficulty--at three gravities acceleration\ntheir apparent weight was tripled, and his body now \"weighed\" over five\nhundred and fifty pounds, instead of its normal one eighty plus!\n\n\"You're both right and wrong, Honey,\" he explained. \"The better the\nfuel, the less we have to carry for the same distance traveled, and\nthat makes our thrust-to-mass ratio less. We can go home faster than\nwe came out here, because some of our fuel is gone and we have less\nmass. But that's not what I'm talking about. Theoretically, as I said,\nthere are other ways, none of which our scientists have yet figured\nout how to use, as far as I know. There could be a complete or partial\nnullification of gravity or of inertia. Or some type of space warp. Or\nsome method of 'cutting through' the other dimensions, so we could go\nalmost instantly from one point in space to another.\"\n\nJak gasped. \"Why, how's that possible, Father?\"\n\nJon answered quickly. \"I can illustrate, I think. Imagine a sheet of\npaper, with a dot near either end. The normal way to connect them would\nbe a straight line drawn from one to the other--which is analogous to\nthe way we travel in space now. What Pop's talking about would be the\nsame as if we folded the paper so the two dots touched, and moved from\none to the other direct.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be....\"\n\n\"That's silly.\"\n\nThe two phrases came simultaneously from Jak and his mother.\n\n\"It's not silly, Honey. We merely haven't figured out how to do it yet.\nBut theoretical science knows that there are 'folds' in space. We just\nhaven't learned how to use them yet.\"\n\n\"No,\" Jak snorted, \"and I'll bet you never do.\"\n\n\"And I'll bet they will,\" Jon blazed. \"You just don't realize how\nwonderful science is--in other lines than your own, I mean. You think\nit's perfectly natural that medical science has made such tremendous\nadvances in the past couple of centuries. Why shouldn't other branches\nmake just as great strides?\"\n\n\"Because the advances in medicine and surgery have been logical,\" his\nbrother began hotly, but their father interrupted.\n\n\"Whoa now, boys, don't get started on an endless argument. You're both\nright--and both wrong. I'll admit that the three methods I mentioned\nare pretty far-fetched. But after all, science is always doing the\nunexpected and the impossible. There's no telling what they'll do\nnext--not even of telling what they may have done while we've been\ngone.\"\n\n\"I'd read about that 'simultaneity' thing,\" Jon stated. \"It was a\nconcept about being able to reproduce the exact nucleonic pattern of\nsome other space and thus being able to transfer to it instantly.\"\n\n\"Another idea is of a 'tube' or 'vortex' method of transversing space\nat almost instantaneous speeds--and many other such,\" Mr. Carver\ndeclared. \"But it's a cinch none of us have brains enough to figure out\nany of them before we reach Terra. And that Bogin's not using any of\nthem, either, since he's so apparently on a straight-line flight like\nwe are. He may have better engines, or better fuel, but to overtake us\nlike he is--now that I've stopped to think about it--can only be done\nby using greater acceleration than we are, and for a longer time. So\nwhile those other ideas are interesting conjectures, they won't help us\nout of our present predicament.\"\n\n\"That's right, Pop.\" Jon wrenched his mind back to their immediate\nproblem. \"We've got to figure out what we can do _right now_ to beat\nBogin.\"\n\nThey all lapsed into silence then, partly to think of their problem,\nand partly because their personal energy was weakened by the tremendous\npressures they were undergoing.\n\nTheir new schedule was hard on them all--none of them were really\nrested, even though they now slept or dozed most of the time. But\nthey were keeping more nearly ahead, although when Jon took his next\nreadings, Bogin's ship had crept up another third of a hundred million\nmiles.\n\n\"That means he'll catch up with and pass us in about eleven days, and\nwe're still almost twenty out of Terra.\" Jon could not entirely keep\nthe worry out of his voice.\n\nDuring the noon respite, according to ship's time, they cut their\nacceleration to one and a half, and Mrs. Carver prepared a hot meal,\nand cold lunches for the balance of that day.\n\nWhile they were eating, there in the control room, Jak suddenly looked\nup at his father. \"I just wondered, sir. How much pressure could a\nperson stand for long periods, if he was unconscious under some kind of\nan anaesthetic?\"\n\n\"Why,\" the elder hesitated, \"I don't know exactly. I imagine around\nfive gravities or so, if it was to be for some time, especially if one\nwas in a pressure pack. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I remembered reading about a\nseries of experiments a Swedish scientist has been making about putting\nanimals--even people--into an unconscious state. It's in one of my\nreelbooks. Seems to me I remember its saying he has found he could keep\nthem there for several days at a time without any sign of permanent\nharm.\"\n\n\"How'd he do it?\" Jon dropped his fork to lean forward.\n\n\"With a drug he invented. Wait, I'll go get the book.\" Jak jumped up\nfrom the table, but his mother's voice stopped him.\n\n\"We're not going to try anything like that,\" she said worriedly. \"Not\neven to beat Bogin.\"\n\nMr. Carver reached out from his recline seat to lay a hand soothingly\non his wife's. \"Wait, now, Marci, let's find out first what this is\nall about. Maybe the boy has something, maybe not. But let's examine it\nbefore we decide, shall we?\"\n\nHer eyes still held the worried look, but she returned the pressure of\nhis hand. \"Well, I guess there's no harm in that, Mr. C. But I just\ndon't like taking dangerous chances, that's all.\"\n\nHe smiled at her fondly. \"Pioneers always have to take chances, Honey,\"\nhe said gently. \"Men would never have gotten anywhere if they hadn't.\nBut we'll make sure we know all about what we're getting into before we\nleap, you can bet.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" Jon tried to reassure her, \"even if this stuff would work,\nOwl hasn't any of that new drug, so we couldn't try it, much as we\nmight want to.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right. I hadn't thought of that.\" She smiled with relief.\n\nIn a moment Jak came running back with a reelbook. \"Here it is. Let's\nsee now.\" He rapidly scanned through the reel with his finder. \"Ah,\nhere it is!\"\n\nHe read aloud rapidly, and the three listened intently.\n\n\"So you see,\" Jak raised his head triumphantly when he had finished\nreading, \"it's perfectly possible to put us to sleep for a week at a\ntime. And you said the ship was fully automatic,\" he turned to Jon, \"so\nit doesn't need guiding, and would keep on its course whether we were\nawake or not.\"\n\n\"Well, it's way past our two hours.\" Mr. Carver spoke up hastily to\nprevent his wife from saying anything. \"Time we were getting back into\nstepped-up acceleration again. Strap down, and we can study this later.\"\n\n\"I still don't like the idea,\" Mrs. Carver said as the four made\nthemselves as comfortable as possible in the recline seats before Jon\nturned on more acceleration.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nDuring the next two or three \"waking periods\" Jak busied himself\nstudying his reeltext, but this was such a common sight it attracted no\nspecial attention. Nor did the others notice that he began disappearing\ninto the ship's storeroom each \"up\" period, and had to be called\nrepeatedly when the meal was ready, or it was time to strap down again.\n\nHe said nothing of what he was doing, nor did any of the others think\nto ask, for the boys were customarily here and there about the ship,\nbusy at their many tasks and activities.\n\nBut at the start of one \"up\" period Jak went at once to the storeroom\nand workshop, and when he came back to the table set in the control\nroom he showed his family a large corked test tube filled with a\ncolorless liquid.\n\n\"I've got it!\" he exclaimed, his eyes shining. \"I found all the\ningredients needed in our stores and my medical kit, and made up a\nbatch of the cataleptic fluid. We inject four cc's in each of us\nand....\"\n\n\"What're you talking about?\" Jon demanded.\n\n\"The stuff to make us unconscious so we can stand five G's of\nacceleration.\" Jak looked up in hurt surprise. \"What we were talking\nabout the other....\"\n\n\"I thought we were going to forget that nonsense,\" his mother said\nsharply.\n\n\"Wait, now, Marci, let's hear what the boy has,\" her husband said\ngently. Then, \"Go ahead, Jak, tell us more about this.\"\n\n\"This medicine, injected into our blood streams, puts us into suspended\nanimation for several days, depending on how much of the fluid we use.\nWe first take an injection of glucose and other nutrients, of course,\nthen this stuff puts us into deep sleep--slows our metabolism. You said\nin such a state we could stand much heavier acceleration, Father. Then\nwith this we can beat Bogin.\"\n\n\"What sort of shape will it leave us in?\" his father almost raised up\nin interest, and held up his hand when his wife would have broken in.\n\"Are there any after-effects?\"\n\n\"The book says the doctor never discovered any, especially after he\nstarted giving people the nutrient injections first. He has had people\nunder for as much as two weeks. Four cc's will act for about five days,\nso I thought we could use that much the first time, at least.\"\n\n\"Five G's would certainly put us 'way ahead of Bogin's ship.\" Jon\nhad jumped up from the table and had been working swiftly with the\ncomputer. \"Two such five-day periods--three more days on positive\nacceleration, then seven on negative--ought to give us a controllable\nvelocity somewhere near Sol. We'd have to compute it more exactly, of\ncourse, before we take each shot.\"\n\nMr. Carver thought slowly and intently, then spoke decisively. \"I\nbelieve that this is our best bet, if it's sure. We certainly want to\nget back first, if possible, and according to our present routine,\nwhich is all we can stand as we are, Bogin can beat us in. Besides,\nhe will undoubtedly shoot down the _Star Rover_ if he catches up with\nit--and you know what would happen to us!\"\n\n\"Yes, when I checked today he was only about two hundred million\nbehind.\"\n\n\"Let's try it!\" Jak was all eagerness.\n\n\"Take it easy, Son. We've got to talk and study this a lot first.\"\n\nMr. Carver then turned to his wife, who had sunk back into her seat,\nbiting her lips to keep from crying out, her hands clenched tightly.\n\"Well make as sure as we possibly can before we decide to do anything,\nHoney, but don't you see the advantage of this if it will work? We must\nget to Terra first if we can, and this seems to be the only way we know\nof doing it.\"\n\n\"I see that,\" she said with a sigh of resignation, \"and I know you'll\nknow what you're doing before you do it.\"\n\n\"We sure will.\" Then Mr. Carver turned back to Jak. \"Tell us again all\nabout this stuff, and what the book says.\"\n\nJak talked rapidly but concisely for nearly five minutes. Afterwards he\nshowed his father the reel, and his table of components of the mixture.\nMr. Carver studied the book carefully for some time, and minutely\ncompared the formula as given there with the one Jak had used. Then he\nlay back and thought with intense concentration for nearly a quarter of\nan hour. Finally he raised his head with determination.\n\n\"I think we should try it. It seems safe, from all the evidence here. I\nhave faith enough in Jak's ability to trust him to have made the fluid\ncorrectly--his formula checks exactly with the one in the reels. And if\nit works, we can win out.\"\n\nJon rose purposefully. \"Right, Pop. Come on, Jak, let's break out the\npressure packs and get them hung.\"\n\nThey went into the storeroom, and soon came back, each staggering under\nthe weight and inconvenience of two packs. These they hung from the\nbulkhead hooks built into the ship for just that purpose, and made sure\nthey were securely anchored.\n\n\"How much time after the injection before we blank out, Owl?\" Jon asked\nthen.\n\n\"A minute or so, I guess. Why?\"\n\n\"Figuring how long I'll have to handle the controls. A minute is plenty\nof time, as I can have everything set up, and only have one switch to\nthrow.\"\n\nMr. Carver reached out a hand and patted his wife's cheek as she stood\nby his side. \"It's going to work out all right, Honey.\" His voice was\nbright and assured. \"These boys of ours are really up on their stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"I know they know what they are doing, and that you\nare checking them carefully. It is mainly my not knowing that makes me\nafraid sometimes.\" She gave him a lopsided smile. \"I hate being the\nweak member of the party.\"\n\n\"You're nothing of the kind!\" He grinned as the boys murmured protests\nwhich meant the same thing. \"You're the best fellow in the gang.\" And\nhe blew her a kiss as the boys helped him into his pack and saw to it\nthat he was securely and comfortably strapped in. Then they did the\nsame for their mother.\n\nJak went to his room and came back quickly with his hypodermic needles,\nand the bottles of glucose and concentrates. He put these beside the\ntest tube with the new fluid.\n\nCarefully he administered the dosage of nutrients to the other three,\nthen lay down on his recline seat and gave himself his own dose. He\nrested there for a couple of minutes, then rose. Carefully he drew\nfour cubic centimeters of the new, clear fluid into his needle, then\napproached his mother. \"Ready?\" he asked, smiling, but with tight lips.\n\nShe pushed up her left sleeve. \"Ready, Son.\" And now her voice was soft\nbut steady.\n\nHe tipped the needle into the light, carefully expelled a couple of\ndrops to make sure all air was out of the tube. Then quickly and with\na sureness he had trouble making his hands achieve, he pushed the slim\nneedle into her arm, and injected the drug. With the ball of his thumb\nhe rubbed the puncture gently for a moment. \"Sleep tight, Mother.\" He\nsmiled and leaned down to kiss her.\n\n\"Who's next?\" He turned to the others.\n\n\"Me, of course.\" His father bared his arm. \"Jon has to be awake last to\nhandle the controls.\"\n\nAgain Jak filled his needle, and as carefully as before he injected\nthe sleeping drug into his father. Then he stepped up to the pilot's\npressure pack where his younger brother was adjusting the controls.\n\"Ready, Jon?\"\n\n\"Just a sec.\" The boy was still working, pushing in a button there,\nturning a switch here, stopping to tighten a wire or connection\nsomewhere else. But in a few moments he had finished, and then rested\nhis right hand on the handle of the master switch, ready to push it\ninto contact.\n\nBut just as Jak brought the needle close to his arm the younger boy\npushed it away. \"Wait now, Jak. How about you? Can you make it to your\npack and get in and strapped down and settled, and then give yourself\nthe shot before I throw the switch and the five G's take effect?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" his brother said gruffly. \"I'll make out some\nway.\"\n\n\"Not good enough,\" Jon said positively. \"Let's figure this down to\nseconds. If I don't close the switch before I black out, all this'll\nbe wasted. How about if you inject yourself first? Will you have time\nenough to give me my shot and then get back into your pack and strap\ndown before you go under?\"\n\nJak thought swiftly a moment. \"Your point's well taken, Jon, but you\ndidn't figure it right. Your way, I'd have to give you your injection\nbesides doing all the rest in the same length of time. If I give you\nyours first, I can get into my pack and give myself mine there. You\nmerely stay awake until I'm done.\"\n\n\"Yes, guess you're right. But fix your pack so you can be sure of\ngetting in without any trouble.\"\n\nJak did this, then came back, filled the needle and injected it into\nJon's arm.\n\nSwiftly then he ran to his own pack, climbed in and fastened the\nstraps. He filled the needle, plunged it into his arm, and pushed home\nthe plunger.\n\nJon had been watching his brother, forcing back the drowsiness that\nsought to engulf him. As he saw Jak's nod that all was done, he turned\nto his panel. A quick glance about his board with his fast-diminishing\nsenses told him everything was on the green. With his last measure of\nconsciousness, he rammed home the switch.\n\nHe settled back into a more comfortable position, and felt himself\nplunging down into the blackness of unconsciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJon felt himself coming awake, and his first, startled thought was,\n\"Didn't the stuff work?\"\n\nHe began to open his eyes ... and noticed at once how stiff his eyelids\nfelt, but he forced them open. He looked at the date-clock and smiled\nwith relief. The five days and several hours had passed, seemingly in\nan instant.\n\nNow almost fully awake, his eyes sought the various meters, dials,\ngauges and telltales on his panel. Everything seemed to be working\nproperly. He tuned in his receptor, and applied greater and still\ngreater power. Space behind was blank of atomics.\n\nSmiling thankfully and beginning to unloosen his straps, Jon now\nnoticed how dry his mouth was, and that his skin felt dry, too, and\nfeverish. But he had no headache, and his thoughts seemed to be\nfunctioning as clearly and swiftly as always.\n\n\"Boy, I sure need a bath and drink, and something to eat!\" he\nthought--then realized that the others would be feeling the same way.\nThe others! He turned quickly to look at them. They were all still\nlying in their packs, somewhat pale, but with a peaceful, unstrained\nlook on their faces.\n\nJon tried to rise, but reeled back and almost fell as he got onto his\nfeet. He held himself erect a moment, and gradually felt a measure of\nstrength returning.\n\nAs soon as he could, he went into the galley. Quickly he prepared a cup\nof instant broth, and drank it gratefully. Much refreshed, he made more\nof the consomme, and further enriched it with some anti-fatigue pills\ndissolved in the steaming liquid. He set four cups of it on a tray and\ncarried them into the control room. His first quick glance showed the\nothers beginning to stir.\n\n\"Morning, folks,\" he called cheerily. \"Soup's on.\"\n\nThey opened their eyes slowly, almost uncomprehendingly, but awareness\ncame quickly, and his mother and brother sat up and fumbled at their\nstraps.\n\n\"Did we make it?\" his father called anxiously. But Jak noticed at once\nhow weak his father's voice sounded, and went across to his side.\n\n\"We sure did.\" Jon smiled broadly. \"We were out just a little over\nfive days, and the receptors don't show a thing behind. I woke up\njust a few minutes ahead of you, and that's one of the first things I\nlooked at. Then I found I was weak and dry, so I went out and made this\nbroth.\" He passed the cups and, as the others drank gratefully, Jon\nspoke again.\n\n\"I've got to hand it to you, Owl. You sure fixed us fine this time.\"\n\n\"He certainly did.\" Mr. Carver spoke as forcefully as he could, having\nalready privately warned Jak to say nothing of his weakened condition.\nHe looked solicitously over at his wife. \"You all right, Marci?\"\n\n\"Yes, I feel fine, now that I've had this good consomme Jon was so\nthoughtful as to make.\" She smiled with real relief that they had all\ncome through this dangerous experiment so successfully.\n\nMr. Carver turned to Jon. \"It feels like we're only at one gravity.\"\n\n\"Yes, I rigged the automatics so they'd take care of that at the end of\none hundred and twenty-five hours,\" the boy explained. \"Probably it was\nthe relief from pressure that woke us, as well as the wearing off of\nthe stuff Jak gave us.\" Then he looked at his brother. \"How come we're\nnot famished after five days? That little glucose and stuff you gave us\nwouldn't last that long, would it?\"\n\n\"No, but the drug not only made us unconscious, but slowed down our\nmetabolism so that we burned up hardly any energy.\"\n\nThere was silence then while the four sipped their broth. Finally Mr.\nCarver looked up at Jak. \"How soon can we go through this again?\"\n\n\"The book says the doctor gave as high as four doses to people, one\nright after the other as they woke up, with only a few hours' rest\nbetween them.\"\n\n\"_Hmmm_, then we'd better take some time out. We'll all want baths,\nplenty of your mother's good cooking, and Jon and I will have to do\nsome computing.\"\n\n\"If Bogin holds his acceleration, plus and minus, we can take most\nof the day, and still beat him in.\" Jon had been doing some rapid\npreliminary figuring. \"But it'll take a couple of hours--maybe more--to\ncompute the last hop. It's tricky. Especially, I'll have to look in the\nephemeris to find the position of Luna when we get near her orbit.\"\n\n\"Right, we don't want to hit her. Well, we can keep at one gravity for\nat least twelve hours, then,\" his father said, and Mrs. Carver breathed\na sigh of relief. She was still a bit worried about their undergoing\nsuch untried experiments, even though she trusted the abilities of her\nmenfolks, and knew they had all come safely through the first time.\n\n\"I'll make notes of all this, and ask each of you for your full\nreactions,\" Jak said animatedly. \"Then when we get home I'll write up a\ncomplete report and send it to Dr. Svendholm. I'm sure he'll be tickled\npink to get this added confirmation of his studies and experiments.\"\n\n\"That's thoughtful of you, Son.\" His father smiled. \"You're developing\ninto a true research scientist.\"\n\n\"He sure is!\" His younger brother paid deserved tribute. Jak reddened a\nbit and hastily left the control room to help his mother with her work.\n\nThey all took warm baths and changed their clothing. As Jak was helping\nhis father, he asked anxiously, \"Now that we're alone, Father, did you\nreally come through all right? You look a bit more tired and worn than\nbefore we started this.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'm OK,\" Mr. Carver said quickly, but he could not meet his\nson's eyes.\n\n\"You're not, sir, and you know it and I know it,\" Jak smiled a bit\nstrainedly. \"I don't like it, but I know how you feel about this, so\nI'll keep quiet. How's your leg?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Son. Our getting back first is very important to me, and I can\nrest and get well after we reach Earth and get the Board's confirmation\non our claim. And don't forget that we might not get back at all if\nBogin catches up with us. He's ruthless about anyone who gets in his\nway.... As for the leg, it aches some, but not like it did before. I\nreally think it's healing in fine shape.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look.\" Jak threw back the covers, and peered closely at\nthe leg, lifting it so he could better see all around it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said finally, as he tucked in the blankets again. \"It's\nalmost healed, and there isn't a sign of inflammation. Not even a bump\nwhere the break was. I ... I sure hope I set it right, so that it won't\nbother you later on.\"\n\nHis father patted his hand. \"You did a grand job, I know, Son, and I'm\nvery grateful to you--as well as proud of having such a fine boy.\"\n\n\"Two fine boys, then, for Jon is certainly every bit as deserving of\nyour praise as I am, sir.\"\n\n\"That I'll certainly buy!\" Mr. Carver's eyes shone.\n\nThey all sat about during the day, eating as much as they could hold of\nMrs. Carver's fine cooking, and relaxing gratefully in the comfortable\none-gravity Earth-weight.\n\nJon and his father worked tirelessly until they had computed precisely\nwhere they were and how soon and how much more deceleration they would\nhave to use to finish their trip. Then they, too, relaxed for the\nbalance of the day.\n\nLate that afternoon Jon suddenly swiveled his chair about to face his\nfather's recline seat.\n\n\"I think I've figured out something on that new fuel and how to use\nit, Pop. Ships'll have to be changed, though. The bins will have to be\nheavily lead-lined, of course, and so would the injector tubes have to\nbe shielded. The nozzles would have to be made smaller, so the pellets\nwill fit better. I figure the people who used to handle the stuff made\nthe nuggets that exact size on purpose--that we'd not want to try\nmaking them the same size as our copper ones.\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable. What about shielding for the generators?\"\n\n\"There'd have to be a lot more of that, too. Probably thick shields of\nneocarbolloy and paraffin. But can't they surround the generators, bins\nand everything with force fields, as an added precaution?\"\n\n\"_Mmmm_, maybe they could at that. We'd better put it up to the\nscientists and technies back on Terra. Neither of us knows enough to\nhandle it ourselves, when it comes down to the actual work.\"\n\nThe boy's face fell, then he forced a smile. \"I hate to give in to\nanyone else on this, but you're right as rain, Pop. It is too big a\nfish for us to handle alone. But I'm sure going to learn before I\nfinish, and some day when I run up against anything like this again,\nyou can bet I'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"What's the use of going to all that trouble when you only have that\nsmall amount of fuel you found?\" their mother asked curiously.\n\n\"Ouch! You would have to think of that,\" Jon grumbled, but Mr. Carver\nsmiled up at his wife.\n\n\"There's plenty on Planet Five, remember? And probably in other places\nabout the universe. You can bet that prospectors will be hunting--and\nfinding it--once we announce our discovery ... IF we and the scientists\ncan figure out what it was before it started losing its half life, and\nIF we can learn how to use it,\" he said firmly. \"Once metallurgists\nhave had the chance to analyze it, they won't take long to figure out\nexactly what it is, and where it can probably be found--the type of sun\nand planet that would have it, I mean,\" he added.\n\n\"And under the Prime Discoverer's code, we'll get a percentage of the\nprocess, won't we, Pop?\"\n\n\"I think so. That'll be up to the Board, but they're usually pretty\nsquare about such things.\"\n\nWhen it was time, Jak again gave the family the dosages of nutrients,\nand then the shots. Jon had filled four thermos bottles with\nstrength-regaining soup his mother had made, and these were placed at\neach pressure-pack, ready for their awakening. Again the four lapsed\ninto the complete unconsciousness of suspended animation--knowing\nneither discomfort nor the long passage of time--while their little\nship bored through the immensities of space at a constant negative\nacceleration of five gravities.\n\nAs before, when they awakened they felt as though they had just gone\nto sleep. As soon as they had taken their initial feedings of the\nthermos-hot broth, Jon and his father set to work taking observations\nand making long and intricate calculations of their present speed and\nplacement. Where were they? How much of their utterly incomprehensible\ntop speed did they have left?\n\n\"Practically perfect!\" Jon exclaimed happily after nearly an hour of\ncareful computations, as he read the last tapes from the calculator.\n\"It works out at one point eight four G's to atmosphere.\"\n\n\"O positively K,\" Mr. Carver agreed. \"A master computer couldn't have\ndone any better. And Jak has certainly proved himself to be a grand\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"It's not my credit. Dr. Svendholm's the one who....\"\n\n\"But it was you who made up the fluid and induced us to take it.\" His\nmother came over and ran her hand gently through his hair. \"I'm proud\nof you all.\"\n\nJon had been tuning his receptors carefully, but was unable to get any\ntrace of Bogin's ship, and all were happy at his report.\n\nWarm baths and changes of clothing, and the fine meals prepared by\nMrs. Carver, plus the fact they were rapidly nearing Sol, which could\nbe seen on their telescopic plates, made them all very gay and full of\nchatter.\n\n\"I've decided I want to go back to the hospital-school and really\nprepare myself to be a doctor,\" Jak said in no uncertain terms. \"Later\nI want to go into medical research.\"\n\n\"And I still want to enroll at the Centropolitan Institute of Atomics.\"\nJon's eyes were shining.\n\n\"Aren't you boys forgetting one little detail?\" their father asked\ndrily. While the long sleeps had relaxed his body, and had practically\ncompleted the healing of his broken leg, the pressure had not been good\nfor him, and his condition as a whole was worse. But his spirits were\nhigh, and he was careful not to let any of his family know just how\nweak he felt.\n\nAt his question they all looked up, astonished, and he continued,\n\"There's the small matter of getting the Colonial Board's approval of\nour claim against the counter-claim we feel so sure Bogin is coming in\nto make.\"\n\n\"Pooh, he hasn't got a chance,\" Jon said airily.\n\n\"You hope,\" Jak scoffed, suddenly serious and worried.\n\n\"How about it, Mr. C.?\" Mrs. Carver asked.\n\n\"Our pictures and data are so detailed I don't see how Bogin can\npossibly match them,\" her husband answered slowly and thoughtfully. \"I\nthink we can prove our claim. Besides, their receivers there on Terra\nshould have picked up the broadcasts of our signals, and then the\nchange--and that should have made them wonder why, so our explanation\nought to satisfy them.\"\n\n\"That reminds me.\" Jon swung back to his panel. \"Let's see if we\ncan pick up our signals from here ... or Bogin's, rather!\" His lips\ntightened.\n\nIn a few moments his tubes had warmed up, but nothing came in over\nhis ultra-range receivers. He stepped up the power, and swung his\ndirectional loops forth and back, although mostly he aimed them\ndirectly toward the Carveria system's known coordinates. For long,\nanxious minutes he worked, but still no sounds, save the noise of\ncosmic rays and the other forces of the void that made long-distance\ncommunication such a problem.\n\nWith a weary gesture Jon finally turned off the set, and swung about\nwith a stricken face. \"What do you suppose is wrong, Pop?\"\n\nThe elder shook his head slowly. \"Only thing I can think of is that\nwe're so far away the senders can't reach this far.\"\n\n\"Won't that be in our favor?\" Jak asked. \"If they can't hear any\nsignals at all, our records ought to be enough.\"\n\n\"Maybe yes, maybe no,\" Mr. Carver answered with a tired smile.\n\n\"And after all our hard work, too.\" Jon's tone was dispirited.\n\n\"And the dangers you were up against.\" Mrs. Carver's eyes were\ntear-dimmed.\n\nTheir father caught himself and looked at each with a disarming grin.\n\"Hey, we're all crossing bridges where maybe there isn't even a creek\nto be spanned.\" He made his voice mockingly cheerful. \"What's happened\nto the good old Carver spirit?\"\n\n\"You're right, Pop.\" Jon shook away his dismay and began to smile.\n\"We're not licked yet.\"\n\nBut while they were eating, a short time later, Jon turned his seat to\nface his father.\n\n\"Don't like to start worrying again, Pop,\" he said in a low voice, \"but\nour receptor is picking up atomic activity behind us again. Of course,\"\nhe added quickly, \"this close to Terra it could be some other ship, not\nBogin's.\"\n\n\"Could be, and probably is.\" His father stroked his chin reflectively.\n\n\"I don't see how he could've caught up with us, but we don't know what\nhis ship can do.\"\n\n\"The guy's tricky and dirty, but he does have a brain and he has some\ndarned good technies in his crew. He'd know, from his own receptors,\nwhen we started speeding up so fast, and he'd do something to\ncounteract that, if he could.\"\n\n\"I've heard things like that about him, but I don't know him.\"\n\n\"I do,\" grimly. \"We've had brushes before, when I was in other ships.\nHe's a skunk and ought to be behind bars--but so far no one has been\nable to produce any real evidence of what all spacemen know must be\ntrue.\"\n\n\"If the Board accepts our claim and data against his, won't that be\nproof against him?\"\n\n\"It should be. You can bet your tackle I'll work on that angle. Space\nwill be cleaner if that hellhound isn't in it.\"\n\n\"You bet, Pop. I hope you sink your hook in him this time.\"\n\nHis father laughed grimly. \"It won't be for lack of trying, that's for\ndanged sure.\"\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nJon Carver spoke into the microphone of his ship radio. \"Exploration\nship _Star Rover_, Tad Carver owner, Jon Carver pilot, asking\npermission to land. We are circling at ten miles up.\"\n\nA moment's crackling noise from the speaker, then a cheery, feminine\nvoice, \"Centropolitan spaceport. Landing permission granted. What size\nis your ship?\"\n\n\"A seventy-two foot space-yacht.\"\n\n\"Do you need servicing?\"\n\n\"We will in a day or so, but not at the moment.\"\n\n\"Use cradle forty-three in section D. Land in four minutes.\"\n\n\"Instructions received with thanks. _Star Rover_ off.\"\n\nCarefully Jon sighted through his visiplate until he located the cradle\nmarked with a large \"43\" in the section of the tremendous spaceport\nalso clearly marked \"D.\" He lowered the ship slowly and gently, keeping\nhis eyes closely on the chronom and its big sweep-secondhand.\n\nSo expert had he become at handling the ship, and so well did his new\nautomatic technique work, that the ship settled gently into the cradle\ndead center ... and only one point three zero seconds off the four\nminutes specified.\n\n\"Nice handling, Chubby,\" Jak cheered as they felt the mighty engines\nand generators shut off.\n\n\"Aw, it was rotten. I was almost a second and a half off in my timing.\"\n\n\"Who cares?\" There was a lilt of joy and pure thankfulness in their\nmother's voice. \"We are back on Earth--home--and all of us are whole.\nThat's the best part of all.\"\n\nHer husband looked up from the recline seat where he was still lying,\nand winked at his sons. Then he faced his wife. \"The eternal mother.\"\nHe smiled gently at her, and his voice was soft with emotion. \"Happiest\nwhen her brood is safe. And,\" he added hastily at the look coming into\nher eyes, \"how thankful mankind is, or should be, that womenfolk have\nalways had that feeling. Man would never have gone as far as he has if\nshe hadn't.\"\n\nJak soon came in from the other part of the ship. \"All our data books,\npictures and specimens are packed and stashed by the inner lockdoor,\"\nhe reported.\n\nJon jumped from his pilot's seat and started toward the living\nquarters. \"Let's get our street clothes on, and get going to the\nColonial Board headquarters.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mrs. Carver said eagerly. \"After all we've gone through to make\nsure we beat that Bogin and his ship back home, let's not waste any\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mr. Carver's eyes twinkled, \"go put on your prettiest frock\nand all your war paint, so you can make a good impression on the Board\nmembers.\"\n\nShe krinkled her nose at him, but went in to the bunkroom. Mr. Carver\nraised his chair to upright, and began struggling to get up. The two\nboys, watching closely, saw how weak he was, and ran to help him. With\nhis arms across their shoulders, he finally managed to half-walk, half\nbe carried, into the other room. The boys lowered him into a seat.\n\n\"I'll get your clean clothes, and your razor and some hot water,\" Jak\nsaid.\n\nJon went back into the control room, and turned on his radio-sender.\n\"Service, please,\" he said when the operator came on, and in a moment,\n\"_Star Rover_, cradle 43, section D. Please have a taxi-hopper here in\nthirty minutes, and a wheel chair with it. Thanks.\"\n\nWhen the four got outside on the landing platform and Tad Carver saw\nthe wheel chair he was indignant. \"I'm not going to ride in any lousy\nperambulator,\" he grumbled, but the boys were insistent.\n\nFinally his wife came over and put her hand on his arm. \"You might\nas well give in, Mr. C. Besides, your leg is not strong enough to do\nwithout one--yet.\"\n\nStill grumbling, he let the boys help him into the wheel chair ... but\nthey noticed his sigh of relief when he was settled and the weight was\ntaken off his feet. His body trembled with weakness, in spite of his\nefforts to control himself.\n\nThe chair, their books and cases were soon loaded into the copter,\nthen Jon directed, \"Colonial Board building, please.\"\n\nThe little ship rose swiftly on her whirling vanes, then streaked\nthrough the clear air toward the center of the great city of\nCentropolis, while the four watched the familiar sights of \"home\" with\neager, happy eyes.\n\n\"Look at the trees and flowers,\" Jak called excitedly, pointing at the\nriot of color below. \"They're getting green and in full bloom. It's\nlate spring here, yet it was fall back on Three.\"\n\n\"Different suns, different seasons on the various planets.\" There was\namusement in his father's voice.\n\n\"Sure, you ought to know that,\" Jon said condescendingly.\n\n\"I do know it, you fathead. I was just....\"\n\n\"Now, Boys,\" their mother interposed--and the two grinned covertly\nat each other. Poor mother never seemed to realize there was no real\nanimosity behind their bickerings.\n\nIt took only a few minutes for the swift taxi-hopper to ferry them from\nthe spaceport to the roof of the huge Colonial building. Tad Carver\npaid the fare, the boys again filled their arms with their books and\ncases, and Mrs. Carver pushed the wheel chair to the elevator. They\ndescended to the Board headquarters' floor.\n\nIn the anteroom their father propelled his chair to the receptionist's\ndesk.\n\n\"I'm Tad Carver, owner of the _Star Rover_, just back from a trip.\nWe wish to present a claim as Prime Discoverers of a new planetary\nsystem.\"\n\n\"Oh, splendid!\" The stately brunette's eyes lighted. \"Is it a good\none?\" she asked as she reached into one of the drawers of her desk for\na sheet of forms.\n\nMr. Carver smiled. \"Five planets and seven moons. Two of the planets\nare very Earthlike, and there are lots of metal, wood and many other\nworth-while things.\"\n\nA distant look came into the girl's eyes. \"I've never been out in\nspace. It must be wonderful....\" She straightened with determination.\n\"Please answer these preliminary questions. Then I'll get your\nappointment with the Board.\" Rapidly she put the questions as listed on\nher forms, and filled in the vacant places as he answered her.\n\nFinished, she rose, said, \"Just a moment, please,\" and went in through\na side door with the papers in her hand.\n\nMr. Carver wheeled himself back to his family, who were sitting stiffly\nin chairs against the further wall. \"Are they going to allow our\nclaim?\" Jon asked nervously. The others leaned forward to hear the\nanswer.\n\n\"Take it easy.\" Mr. Carver's eyes showed amusement. \"The girl has\nmerely gone in to make an appointment for us. This takes time, you\nknow. We probably won't have the answer for several days.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" It was a trio of disappointment, and they sat back to wait,\nglumly, impatiently.\n\nBut only a few minutes later they straightened expectantly as they saw\nthe receptionist coming back. She crossed over to them.\n\n\"The Board is at liberty to hear your preliminary claim now,\" she told\nthem. \"Please follow me.\"\n\nShe led them through the same side door and into a large room beyond.\nThe four looked eagerly about them, seeing a well-lighted, wood-paneled\noffice. Across the room was a large, heavy table-desk, behind which\nwere seated five men.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Tad Carver, and their two sons,\" the girl introduced them\nbefore leaving.\n\n\"Please take those chairs.\" From his seat at the center of the table\nthe chairman indicated comfortable chairs on the side of the table\nopposite him. Jon pushed one aside while Jak propelled the wheel chair\ninto the vacant space. Then the other three Carvers seated themselves\nin adjoining seats.\n\n\"I am Robert Wilson, Chairman of the Board. The other members are Phil\nSilverman, James Dougherty, Will Irwin, and Sam Reardon.\" He indicated\nin turn the other men at the table. \"I see you claim to be the Prime\nDiscoverers of a new Solar System. That's wonderful! We're expanding\nso rapidly, what with the increasing birth rate on Terra and the other\ncolonized planets, that we already and always need more room. Tell us\nmore about your find.\"\n\n\"It's a five-planet system with a sun much like Sol, only about a\nquarter larger. The coordinates are Right Ascension 17.45, Declination\nMinus 11.4, distance about sixty-two light years.\"\n\nSwiftly Mr. Carver gave the pertinent facts about the habitability of\nplanets Two and Three, and presented their books of data, and their\ncases of photographs.\n\n\"How come we haven't received your signals--or didn't you place any?\"\nIrwin asked.\n\n\"We did place them, sir, but we noticed several days ago, coming in,\nthat we could not hear them with our own receivers. It is my opinion\nthat the distance is too great for the strength of the senders.\"\n\n\"That's possible,\" Silverman spoke up. \"Your claim is farther away\nthan any yet presented to us. I happen to know that the signal-senders\nfurnished by our Board technicians ordinarily have a theoretical range\nof not quite fifty light-years.\"\n\nMr. Carver half-rose, then settled back and spoke with a level voice,\nwhile his eyes swept from one to the other of the five men.\n\n\"I want to report honestly on this case, sirs. Just before we left,\nwe started back along a course that would take us fairly close to all\nour planets and the sun, to make sure our senders were functioning\ncorrectly. We started from Two, where we had just completed marking-out\nour city site, went past One and around the sun, planning to make a big\nswing to the other planets and so back home. The senders of One, Two\nand the sun were working all right, but as we neared Three we heard,\ninstead of our own, signals stating that the system had been charted\nand claimed by Michael Bogin and his....\"\n\n\"Slik Bogin!\" Several of the Board members exclaimed in concert, and\nChairman Wilson added, grimly, \"So he's at work again.\"\n\nMr. Carver waited until they were silent, then continued, \"We think he\neither destroyed our senders or substituted his own tapes in ours.\nHowever, we put our sun-signal into an orbit so close to the sun's\nsurface we doubt if he'll be able to do anything about it. It's only\nabout ten million miles....\"\n\n\"Ten million!\" Reardon almost yelled the question, and the others sat\nupright in excited astonishment, doubt showing in their faces. \"How\ncould you do that?\"\n\n\"I figured a van Sicklenberg, sir, to give our sender a circular orbit\napexing at ten million miles,\" Jon Carver explained simply. \"We used\nthe servo-mechs in our lock to throw the sender out when at minimum\ndistance.\"\n\n\"You?\" There was a concerted expression of disbelief and Mr. Reardon\nsaid, witheringly, \"Why, you're not a listed astrogator. How could you\ncompute a ... a what was it you called it?\"\n\n\"A van Sicklenberg throw-out orbit, sir. I....\"\n\n\"Never heard of a van Sicklenberg. What is it ... what sort of nonsense\nare you talking?\"\n\nJon opened his mouth to reply, but his mother forestalled him. She\nrose determinedly. \"My Jon is 'only a boy,' gentlemen, but he has also\nbecome an expert pilot and an excellent astrogator, if I do say so\nmyself. He is also an inventor, and will shortly apply for patents on\na new automatic piloting system--which I don't pretend to understand\nanything about, but which I do know from watching its use is far in\nadvance of anything you now have. You can be sure he knows how to do\nsuch a simple thing as plot an orbit.\" She sat down, eyes defiant, her\nmouth in a straight line.\n\nThe men's faces showed astonishment at her words as much as at her\noutburst.\n\n\"I had been knocked unconscious and my leg was broken,\" Mr. Carver took\nup the explanation, \"so I was out of action for a long time. I'm not\nfully recovered yet, which is the reason for the discourtesy of this\nwheel chair. The two boys had to take over all the work of mapping the\nnew system. But I have examined their books and pictures, and feel sure\nyou will find everything in order and complete, and that it will prove\nour rights as Prime Discoverers, no matter what Bogin may have to say\nwhen he gets here. He is following us, but we managed to beat him in.\"\n\n\"_Hmmm._\" The chairman frowned in thought, then whispered for some\nmoments to the other men on either side of him. The four Carvers sat\nnervously, awaiting the decision of the final arbiters.\n\nFinally Chairman Wilson addressed them directly. \"You can well\nunderstand that we will have to make a rather more thorough examination\nthan usual in this case, Mr. Carver, and that we will have to wait\na few days to see whether or not Michael Bogin is going to make a\ncounter-claim. Knowing you got here first, he may decide not to do so.\nWhere are you located, so we can get in touch with you later?\"\n\n\"We came directly from our ship, sir, so do not have an address as yet.\nHowever, as soon as we have found a place, I'll call your secretary and\nleave our address and visiphone number.\"\n\n\"You do that, please.\" Then, as the Carvers rose to depart, Chairman\nWilson halted them, his voice kindly, yet grim. \"This is a peculiar\ncase, Carver, as you can well understand. We know the reputation of\nBogin, but we also know he has never been found guilty of any of the\nthings rumor claims he has done. We Board members try always to be fair\nand honest in these matters, and you can feel certain and confident you\nand your claims will be given careful consideration. We will get in\ntouch with you in a few days.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Gentlemen. I'm content to rest my claim in your hands.\"\n\nThe four bowed, then left the office and the building.\n\n\"What do you think, Father?\" Jak asked anxiously as they were riding\na ground-cab whose driver had been instructed to find them a good\napartment hotel.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Mr. Carver added a weary smile. \"It's all in the\nfuture, and I'm not a seer. However, I'm sure we'll get an honest and\nunbiased hearing and decision, and I'm equally positive we have the\nbetter claim. So let's forget it until we're notified to appear, and\nenjoy our return to Terra.\"\n\n\"Mr. C.'s right, Boys,\" their mother agreed. \"We've done our best, and\nthanks to you boys, it's a very fine best. Now we must wait, but not\nworry.\"\n\nTheir cabby found them a nice place where there was a vacancy, and soon\nthe four were unpacking their gear and getting settled in their new\nhome. Mr. Carver visiphoned at once to give the new address and phone\nnumber to the Board's receptionist.\n\nThen the Carvers settled down to wait, with as much patience as they\ncould muster, for the call.\n\nJak insisted on having a good doctor called at once. The latter made a\nthorough examination. He had Mr. Carver taken to an X-Ray laboratory,\nwhere it was determined that the broken leg had been perfectly set, and\nwas now practically healed, although it would be some time before the\nstrength returned to it. He also prescribed a course of medications to\nbring back the invalid's full health and vigor.\n\nThe call came from the Board three days later, in the middle of a\nmorning when, fortunately, the four Carvers were all in the apartment.\nThey hurried down to the street, where they flagged a ground-cab and\nwere driven swiftly to the Colonial building. The same brunette girl\nushered them at once into the Board room.\n\nInside, they found the complete Board in session, and in chairs\nopposite them sat Slik Bogin and his chief lieutenant, who glared at\nthe Carvers sullenly as they entered. Hardly were the four seated when\nBogin sprang to his feet.\n\n\"What's the big idea, Carver,\" he almost yelled, \"trying to claim our\ndiscovery? You've got a crust, trying something....\"\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Bogin, and keep quiet,\" Chairman Wilson spoke in a low\nbut commanding voice. \"We're here to judge the facts as presented, not\nto indulge in charges, countercharges and vituperation. Now, the Board\nhas examined minutely both sets of claims. Both parties have presented\nall the data required by us, and these have been studied by each of\nus individually. Dougherty,\" he turned to one of the Board members,\n\"please review the data sheets for us.\"\n\nA tall, serious-faced man rose, and arranged the two sets of sheets\nbefore him.\n\n\"According to the Carver claim, as presented here,\" he gestured toward\none set of books, \"they arrived at the system and made their first\nlanding on Planet Two on January 14th of this year, 2136. The Bogin\nclaim is that they first discovered the system and landed on Planet\nThree on January tenth, also of the year 2136. Both parties claim they\nset out the required signal-senders, although neither have been heard\nby our listening posts here. However, we know that signals from these\nsenders cannot, ordinarily, be read at distances in excess of fifty\nlight-years, and the system under consideration is said to be over\nsixty. We have asked the communications department to check with ships\nand planets nearer the system in question, to learn whether or not any\nsignals from it have been received.\"\n\nHe paused a moment and looked at his fellow members first, then at\nthe expectant six across the table. \"I said that both parties have\npresented complete data. However, it seems to us, after careful\nscrutiny, that one set of data was obtained from the air and from the\nsurface of three of the five planets, and from a height of less than\ntwenty miles above the seven moons, and less than five from the other\ntwo planets, as our regulations specify. The other books clearly show\nthat the observations were all taken from above the surface.\"\n\nThere was relief on the faces of the four Carvers, nervous side glances\nbetween Bogin and his henchman, none of which escaped the sharp eyes\nof the five Board members, watching closely the reactions of the two\nopposing parties.\n\n\"We have here the two sets of photographs, taken from a height of five\nmiles as specified by our rulings, of the townsite that we require\nto be laid out.\" He held one set out to each party across the table.\n\"Please examine them and let us know if you see any differences.\"\n\nThere was silence for several long, anxious moments, then after the two\ngroups had studied the photographs handed them, Jon Carver suddenly let\nout a gasp, and looked up eagerly.\n\n\"May I speak, sirs?\"\n\n\"You may.\"\n\n\"This is not the picture we took,\" indicating one. \"If you will compare\nthe two, you will find that this one was taken before the work was\nfully completed. See, there is a gap here along the east side where not\nall the stakes are in.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" his mother looked up quickly, and took up the story. \"Then I was\nright, that time. I did hear a ship. You see, sirs,\" she addressed\nthe Board members more directly, \"the boys ran out of stakes and had\nto go to the forest there some miles to the northwest of the ship to\ncut more. Look, you can see just the edge of our ship right here on\nthe margin. While they were gone, I thought I heard a ship passing\nover ours, but when I got to the control room and could look through\na plate, either it had gone out of sight or I was mistaken. The boys\nsaid, when asked after they got back, that they had neither heard nor\nseen it--they were in the woods at the time. But I believe now that I\ndid hear a ship, that it was Mr. Bogin's, and that he took this picture\nat that time. It took the boys nearly a day and a half longer to\ncomplete their work, and not until after that was our picture taken.\"\n\nThe Board chairman smiled at her, then turned a severe face toward\nBogin and his lieutenant. \"That is exactly what the pictures show--that\none is complete and the other is not. What have you to say about that?\"\n\nThe man's face was black with fury. \"I say they're liars,\" he shouted.\n\"This one here,\" shaking the photograph he held, \"is our picture. That\none is theirs.\"\n\nMr. Carver started to rise, but Jak was before him, and it was the\nlatter whose voice cut through the din. \"Oh, no, and I can prove\nwhich is our picture, if you will examine all the rest. I did all the\ndeveloping and printing, and you'll find a small 'C' down in the lower\nright-hand corner of all our pictures. I marked all our negatives that\nway, as you can determine if you'll send someone to our ship to get the\nnegatives from the darkroom.\"\n\nThe Board members huddled over the sheaves of pictures for a moment,\nthen turned severely toward Bogin. \"The young man is correct. All the\nCarver pictures are so marked, and so is this one of the completed\ntownsite.\"\n\nJon Carver broke in. \"Ask them to describe the animal life they found\non Planet Three,\" he suggested.\n\n\"Well?\" the Chairman looked levelly at Bogin.\n\n\"Why ... why....\" The latter was quite taken aback by this sudden\nchallenge. \"Why, there are several species ... and ... and they were\nmore or less like ours here, although not exactly like them, of course.\"\n\n\"Ha, that proves he was never on the ground there,\" Jon cried out in\ntriumph. \"We found, and so will anyone else you care to send there,\nthat while Planet Three has a lot of vegetation and is perfectly\nhabitable--though cold--there is absolutely no protoplasmic life to\nbe found there. At least,\" he added honestly, \"on any of the surface\nwe covered, and our ship's log will show, as you can see there, that\nwe flew at less than five miles up for eight complete but spiral\nrevolutions about the planet, and were on the ground in several places,\nwhich we explored and photographed thoroughly.\"\n\n\"The young man is right,\" Mr. Silverman spoke up. \"I noticed that\nfact mentioned in their records, and intended asking more about\nit, because this is the first planet of which I've heard, that is\notherwise completely habitable by mankind, where such a condition has\nobtained--where there is voluminous floral life but no protoplasmic\nlife of any kind. Being something of a botanist, that fact struck me at\nonce.\"\n\nBogin rose, sneering, but also feeling safe in this part of his claim.\n\"Bah! They just didn't happen to sit down in the same places we did ...\nif they were there at all. We saw lots of animal life there.\"\n\n\"And you took pictures of such life?\" Mr. Carver asked pointedly.\n\n\"Why, no, it isn't required.\"\n\nThere was a discreet rap on the door, and when the chairman gave\npermission, the receptionist entered and handed him a sheet of paper.\nHe examined it quickly, then passed it to his fellow members. The five\nconferred together in quick whispers for several minutes--while Bogin\nand his man glared in sullen anger at the Carvers.\n\nFour of the Board members finally resumed their seats, while Chairman\nWilson stood at his place. He pressed a buzzer, then took up his gavel.\nHe struck three loud, solemn notes with it.\n\n\"It is the considered opinion of the Terran Colonial Board, here\nassembled in official meeting,\" he intoned, \"that Tad Carver has\nproven his claim as Prime Discoverer of the Solar System henceforth\nto be known as 'Carveria,' and this decision shall be so entered in\nour records as of this date. Congratulations,\" he added, smiling as he\nturned to the happy four, who were attempting the almost impossible\ntask of each hugging all the others at the same time.\n\nBogin and his lieutenant rose wrathfully and started to leave the room.\n\n\"Just a moment, Bogin,\" Chairman Wilson said authoritatively. \"You are\nunder arrest for an illegal attempt to defraud by false testimony.\"\n\nBogin, eyes blazing, suddenly seemed to go berserk. He drew a blaster\nfrom an underarm holster, and waved it about as he and his man backed\ntoward the door. \"You ain't gonna arrest nobody. We're leaving\nhere--and we cinder the first one of you that moves.\"\n\nBut, unseen by them, the door behind had opened and three space\nmarines, guns in hand, had entered in response to the chairman's buzzed\ncall.\n\n\"Drop that gun, Mister,\" their leader said sharply, his own muzzle\npushed against Bogin's back. The latter, face livid, did so. In moments\nthe two pirates were handcuffed. The sergeant saluted the Board\nmembers. \"Guards will be sent to the spaceport at once to arrest the\nother members of the Bogin crew, sir, pending examination and trial.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sergeant. We will prefer charges at once.\"\n\nAs the marines started leading the two away, Bogin pulled back\nsuddenly, and faced Mr. Carver.\n\n\"One thing I'd like to know. We were catching up with you, fast, and\nall of a sudden you pulled away from us as though we was standing\nstill, yet we were all in slings, and doing three and a half G's. How'd\nyou do it?\"\n\nMr. Carver smiled lazily. \"We're submitting a full report to _The Space\nPilot's Gazette_. You can read it there--if they let you read where\nyou're going.\"\n\nHe turned back to the Board members and again expressed the thanks of\nhimself and his family.\n\nChairman Wilson held out a sheet of paper. \"You may be interested in\nthis report. It came from the Communications Center on Petrarch Three,\nand was the deciding factor in your case.\"\n\nThe four clustered close to read:\n\n\"Carver signals heard first, then ceased one by one and the Bogin\nsignals began, although one Carver signal, the solar one, is still\nheard.\"\n\nMr. Carver turned to the Board members and said, \"Like most crooks,\nBogin was yellow. He didn't have nerve enough to run in as close to\nthe sun as these youngsters of mine did, and so couldn't change their\nsignal there. The boys are great planet mappers--both of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nEDWARD EVERETT EVANS\n\nwas born in Coldwater, Michigan, the youngest of the four children of\nJohn and Nellie Evans.\n\nEnlisting in the U.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
