There was no impression of swimming; the fish shape had neither\nfins nor a tail. It was as though it were hovering in wait for a member\nof some smaller species to swoop suddenly down from nowhere, so that it,\nin turn, could pounce and kill.\n\nBut still it moved and sang.\n\nOnly a being who was thoroughly familiar with the type could have told\nthat this particular fish was dying.\n\nIn shape, the ship was rather like a narrow flounder--long, tapered, and\noval in cross-section--but it showed none of the exterior markings one\nmight expect of either a living thing or a spaceship. With one\nexception, the smooth silver-pink exterior was featureless.\n\nThat one exception was a long, purplish-black, roughened discoloration\nthat ran along one side for almost half of the ship's seventeen meters\nof length. It was the only external sign that the ship was dying.\n\nInside the ship, the Nipe neither knew nor cared about the\ndiscoloration. Had he thought about it, he would have deduced the\npresence of the burn, but it was by far the least of his worries.\n\nThe ship sang, and the song was a song of death.\n\nThe internal damage that had been done to the ship was far more serious\nthan the burn on the surface of the hull. It was that internal damage\nwhich occupied the thoughts of the Nipe, for it could, quite possibly,\nkill him.\n\nHe had, of course, no intention of dying. Not out here. Not so far, so\nvery far, from his own people. Not out here, where his death would be so\nvery improper.\n\nHe looked at the ball of the yellow-white sun ahead and wondered that\nsuch a relatively stable, inactive star could have produced such a\ntremendously energetic plasmoid, one that could still do such damage so\nfar out. It had been a freak, of course. Such suns as this did not\nnormally produce such energetic swirls of magnetohydrodynamic force.\n\nBut the thing had been there, nonetheless, and the ship had hit it at\nhigh velocity. Fortunately the ship had only touched the edge of the\nswirling cloud--otherwise the ship would have vanished in a puff of\nincandescence. But it had done enough. The power plants that drove the\nship at ultralight velocities through the depths of interstellar space\nhad been so badly damaged that they could only be used in short bursts,\nand each burst brought them closer to the fusion point. Even when they\nwere not being used they sang away their energies in ululations of\nwavering vibration that would have been nerve-racking to a human being.\n\nThe Nipe had heard the singing of the engines, recognized it for what it\nwas, realized that he could do nothing about it, and dismissed it from\nhis mind.\n\nMost of the instruments were powerless; the Nipe was not even sure he\ncould land the vessel. Any attempt to use the communicator to call home\nwould have blown his ship to atoms.\n\nThe Nipe did not want to die, but, if die he must, he did not want to\ndie foolishly.\n\nIt had taken a long time to drift in from the outer reaches of this\nsun's planetary system, but using the power plants any more than was\nabsolutely necessary would have been foolhardy.\n\nThe Nipe missed the companionship his brother had given him for so long;\nhis help would be invaluable now. But there had been no choice. There\nhad not been enough supplies for two to survive the long inward fall\ntoward the distant sun. The Nipe, having discovered the fact first, had,\nout of his mercy and compassion, killed his brother while the other was\nnot looking. Then, having disposed of his brother with all due ceremony,\nhe had settled down to the long, lonely wait.\n\nBeings of another race might have cursed the accident that had disabled\nthe ship, or regretted the necessity that one of them should die, but\nthe Nipe did neither, for, to him, the first notion would have been\nfoolish and the second incomprehensible.\n\nBut now, as the ship fell ever closer toward the yellow-white sun, he\nbegan to worry about his own fate. For a while, it had seemed almost\ncertain that he would survive long enough to build a communicator, for\nthe instruments had already told him and his brother that the system\nahead was inhabited by creatures of reasoning power, if not true\nintelligence, and it would almost certainly be possible to get the\nequipment he needed from them. Now, though, it looked as if the ship\nwould not survive a landing. He had had to steer it away from a great\ngas giant, which had seriously endangered the power plants.\n\nHe did not want to die in space--wasted, forever undevoured. At least,\nhe must die on a planet, where there might be creatures with the\ncompassion and wisdom to give his body the proper death rites. The\nthought of succumbing to inferior creatures was repugnant, but it was\nbetter than rotting to feed monocells or ectogenes, and far superior to\nwasting away in space.\n\nEven thoughts such as these did not occupy his mind often or for very\nlong. Far, far better than any of those thoughts were thoughts connected\nwith the desire and planning for survival.\n\nThe outer orbits of the gas giants had been passed at last, and the Nipe\nfell on through the Asteroid Belt without approaching any of the larger\npieces of rock-and-metal. That he and his brother had originally elected\nto come into this system along its orbital plane had been a mixed\nblessing. To have come in at a different angle would have avoided all\nthe debris--from planetary size on down--that is thickest in a star's\nequatorial plane, but it would also have meant a greater chance of\nmissing a suitable planet unless too much reliance were placed on the\nalready weakened power generators. As it was, the Nipe had been\nfortunate in being able to use the gravitational field of the gas giant\nto swing his ship toward the precise spot where the third planet would\nbe when the ship arrived in the third orbit. Moreover, the planet would\nbe retreating from the Nipe's line of flight, which would make the\nvelocity difference that much the less.\n\nFor a while the Nipe had toyed with the idea of using the mining bases\nthat the local life-form had set up in the Asteroid Belt as bases for\nhis own operations, but he had decided against it. Movement would be\nmuch freer and more productive on a planet than it would be in the Belt.\n\nHe would have preferred using the fourth planet for his base. Although\nmuch smaller, it had the same reddish, arid look as his own home\nplanet, while the third planet was three quarters drowned in water. But\nthere were two factors that weighed so heavily against that choice that\nthey rendered it impossible. In the first place, by far the greater\nproportion of the local inhabitants' commerce was between the asteroids\nand the third planet. Second, and even more important, the fourth world\nwas at such a point in its orbit that the energy required to land would\ndestroy the ship beyond any doubt.\n\nIt would have to be the third world.\n\nAs the ship fell inward, the Nipe watched his pitifully inadequate\ninstruments, doing his best to keep tabs on every one of the ships that\nthe local life-form used to move through space. He did not want to be\nspotted now, and even though the odds were against these beings having\nany instrument highly developed enough to spot his own craft, there was\nalways the possibility that he might be observed optically.\n\nSo he squatted there in his ship, a centipede-like thing about five feet\nin length and a little less than eighteen inches in diameter, with eight\narticulated limbs spaced in pairs along his body, each limb ending in a\nfive-fingered manipulatory organ that could be used equally well as hand\nor foot. His head, which was long and snouted, displayed two pairs of\nviolet eyes that kept a constant watch on the indicators and screens of\nthe few instruments that were still functioning aboard the ship.\n\nAnd he waited as the ship fell toward its rendezvous with the third\nplanet.\n\n\n\n\n_[2]_\n\n\nWang Kulichenko pulled the collar of his uniform coat up closer around\nhis ears and pulled the helmet and face-mask down a bit. It was only\nearly October, but here in the tundra country the wind had a tendency to\nbe chill and biting in the morning, even at this time of year. Within a\nweek or so, he'd have to start using the power pack on his horse to\nelectrically warm his protective clothing and the horse's wrappings, but\nthere was no necessity for that yet. He smiled a little, as he always\ndid when he thought of his grandfather's remarks about such \"new-fangled\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"Your ancestors, son of my son,\" he would say, \"conquered the tundra and\nlived upon it for thousands of years without the need of such womanish\nthings. Are there no men any more? Are there none who can face nature\nalone and unafraid without the aid of artifices that bring softness?\"\n\nBut Wang Kulichenko noticed--though out of politeness he never pointed\nit out that the old man never failed to take advantage of the electric\nwarmth of the house when the short days came and the snow blew across\nthe country like fine white sand. And Grandfather never complained about\nthe lights or the television or the hot water, except to grumble\noccasionally that they were old and out of date and that the mail-order\ncatalog showed that much better models were available in Vladivostok.\n\nAnd Wang would remind the old man, very gently, that a paper-forest\nranger only made so much money, and that there would have to be more\nsaving before such things could be bought. He did not--_ever_--remind\nthe old man that he, Wang, was stretching a point to keep his\ngrandfather on the payroll as an assistant.\n\nWang Kulichenko patted his horse's rump and urged her softly to step up\nher pace just a bit. He had a certain amount of territory to cover, and\nalthough he wanted to be careful in his checking he also wanted to get\nhome early.\n\nAround him, the neatly-planted forest of paper-trees spread knotty,\nalien branches, trying to catch the rays of the winter-waning sun.\nWhenever Wang thought of his grandfather's remarks about his ancestors,\nhe always wondered, as a corollary, what those same ancestors would have\nthought about a forest growing up here, where no forest like this one\nhad ever grown before.\n\nThey were called paper-trees because the bulk of their pulp was used to\nmake paper--they were of no use whatever as lumber--but they weren't\nreally trees, and the organic chemicals that were leached from them\nduring the pulping process were of far more value than the paper pulp.\n\nThey were mutations of a smaller plant that had been found in the\ntemperate regions of Mars and purposely changed genetically to grow in\nthe Siberian tundra country, where the conditions were similar to, but\nsuperior to, their natural habitat. They looked as though someone had\nmanaged to crossbreed the Joshua tree with the cypress and then\npersuaded the result to grow grass instead of leaves. And the\nphotosynthesis of those grasslike blades depended on an iron-bearing\ncompound that was more closely related to hemoglobin than to\nchlorophyll, giving them a rusty red color instead of the normal green\nof Earthly plants.\n\nIn the distance, Wang heard the whining of the wind increase, and he\nautomatically pulled his coat a little tighter, even though he noticed\nno increase in the wind velocity around him.\n\nThen, as the whine became louder, he realized that it was not the wind.\n\nHe turned his head toward the sound and looked up. For a long minute he\nwatched the sky as the sound increased in volume, but he could see\nnothing at first. Then he caught a glimpse of motion, a dot that was\nhard to distinguish against the cloud-mottled gray sky.\n\nWhat was it? An air transport in trouble? There were two transpolar\nroutes that passed within a few hundred miles of here, but no air\ntransport he had ever seen made a noise like that. Normally they were so\nhigh up as to be both invisible and inaudible. Must be trouble of some\nsort.\n\nHe reached down to the saddle pack without taking his eyes from the\nmoving speck and took out the radiophone. He held it to his ear and\nthumbed the call button insistently.\n\n_Grandfather!_ he thought with growing irritation as the seconds passed.\n_Wake up! Come on, old dozer, rouse yourself from your dreams!_\n\nAt the same time, he checked his wrist compass and estimated the\ndirection of flight of the dot and its direction from him. He'd at least\nbe able to give the airline authorities some information if the ship\nfell. He wished there were some way to triangulate its height, velocity,\nand so on, but he had no need for that kind of thing, so he hadn't the\nequipment.\n\n\"Yes? Yes?\" came a testy, dry voice through the earphone.\n\nQuickly Wang gave his grandfather all the information he had on the\nflying thing. By now the whine had become a shrill roar and the thing in\nthe air had become a silver-pink fish shape.\n\n\"I think it's coming down very close to here,\" Wang concluded. \"You call\nthe authorities and let them know that one of the aircraft is in\ntrouble. I'll see if I can be of any help here. I'll call you back\nlater.\"\n\n\"As you say,\" the old man said hurriedly. He cut off.\n\nWang was beginning to realize that the thing was a spaceship, not an\nairship. By this time, he could see the thing more clearly. He had never\nactually seen a spacecraft, but he'd seen enough of them on television\nto know what they looked like. This one didn't look like a standard type\nat all, and it didn't behave like one, but it looked and behaved even\nless like an airship, and Wang knew enough to be aware that he did not\nnecessarily know every type of spaceship ever built.\n\nIn shape, it resembled the old rocket-propelled jobs that had been used\nfor the first probings into space more than a century before, rather\nthan the fat ovoids he was used to. But there were no signs of rocket\nexhausts, and yet the ship was very obviously slowing, so it must have\nan inertia drive.\n\nIt was coming in much lower now, on a line north of him, headed almost\ndue east. He urged the mare forward in order to try to keep up with the\ncraft, although it was obviously traveling at several hundred miles an\nhour--hardly a horse's pace.\n\nStill, it was slowing rapidly very rapidly. Maybe ...\n\nHe kept the mare moving.\n\nThe strange ship skimmed along the treetops in the distance and\ndisappeared from sight. Then there was a thunderous crash, a tearing of\nwood and foliage, and a grinding, plowing sound.\n\nFor a few seconds afterward, there was silence. Then there came a soft\nrumble, as of water beginning to boil in some huge but distant samovar.\nIt seemed to go on and on and on.\n\nAnd there was a bluish, fluctuating glow on the horizon.\n\n_Radioactivity?_ Wang wondered. Surely not an atomic-powered ship\nwithout safety cutoffs in this day and age. Still, there was always the\npossibility that the cutoffs had failed.\n\nHe pulled out his radiophone and thumbed the call button again.\n\nThis time there was no delay. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"How are the radiation detectors behaving there, Grandfather?\"\n\n\"One moment. I shall see.\" There was a silence. Then: \"No unusual\nactivity, young Wang. Why?\"\n\nWang told him. Then he asked: \"Did you get hold of the air transport\nauthorities?\"\n\n\"Yes. They have no missing aircraft, but they're checking with the space\nfields. The way you describe it, the thing must be a spaceship of some\nkind.\"\n\n\"I think so too. I wish I had a radiation detector here, though. I'd\nlike to know whether that thing is hot or not. It's only a couple of\nmiles away--maybe a little more--and if that blue glow is ionization\ncaused by radiation, it's much too close for comfort.\"\n\n\"I think any source that strong would register on our detectors here,\nyoung Wang,\" said the old man in his dry voice. \"However, I agree that\nit might not be the pinnacle of wisdom to approach the source too\nclosely.\"\n\n\"Clear your mind of worry, Grandfather,\" Wang said. \"I accept your words\nof wisdom and will go no nearer. Meanwhile, you had best put in a call\nto Central Headquarters Fire Control. There's going to be a blaze if I'm\nany judge unless they get here fast with plenty of fire equipment.\"\n\n\"I'll see to it,\" said his grandfather, cutting off.\n\nThe bluish glow in the sky had quite died away by now, and the distant\nrumbling was fading, too. And, oddly enough, there was not much smoke in\nthe distance. There was a small cloud of gray vapor that rose,\nstreamer-like, from where the glow had been, but even that was\ndissipated fairly rapidly in the chill breeze. Quite obviously there\nwould be no fire. After several more minutes of watching, he was sure of\nit. There couldn't have been much heat produced in the explosion--if it\ncould really be called an explosion.\n\nThen Wang saw something moving in the trees between himself and the spot\nwhere the ship had come down. He couldn't see quite what it was, there\nin the dimness under the hanging, grasslike red strands from the trees,\nbut it looked like someone crawling.\n\n\"Halloo, there!\" he called out. \"Are you hurt?\"\n\nThere was no answer. Perhaps whoever it was did not understand Russian.\nWang's command of English wasn't too good, but he called out in that\nlanguage.\n\nStill there was no answer. Whoever it was had crawled out of sight.\n\nThen he realized it couldn't be anyone crawling. No one could even have\nrun the distance between himself and the ship in the time since it had\nhit, much less crawled.\n\nHe frowned. A wolf, then? Possibly. They weren't too common, but there\nwere still some of them around.\n\nHe unholstered the heavy pistol at his side.\n\nAnd as he slid the barrel free, he became the first human being ever to\nsee the Nipe.\n\nFor an instant, as the Nipe came out from behind a tree fifteen feet\naway, Wang Kulichenko froze as he saw those four baleful violet eyes\nglaring at him from the snouted head. Then he jerked up his pistol to\nfire.\n\nHe was much too late. His reflexes were too slow by far. The Nipe\nlaunched himself across the intervening space in a blur of speed that\nwould have made a leopard seem slow. Two of the alien's hands slapped\naside the weapon with a violence that broke the man's wrist, while\nother hands slammed at the human's skull.\n\nWang Kulichenko hardly had time to be surprised before he died.\n\n\n\n\n_[3]_\n\n\nThe Nipe stood quietly for a moment, looking down at the thing he had\nkilled. His stomachs churned with disgust. He ignored the fading\nhoofbeats of the slave-animal from which he had knocked the thing that\nlay on the ground with a crushed skull. The slave-animal was\nunintelligent and unimportant.\n\nThis was--had been--the intelligent one.\n\nBut so slow! So incredibly slow! And so weak and soft!\n\nIt seemed impossible that such a poorly equipped beast could have\nsurvived long enough on any world to become the dominant life-form.\n\nThen again, perhaps it was not the dominant form. Perhaps it was merely\na higher form of slave-animal. He would have to do more investigating.\n\nHe picked up the weapon the thing had been carrying and examined it\ncarefully. The mechanism was unfamiliar, but a glance at the muzzle told\nhim it was a projectile weapon of some sort. The spiraling grooves in\nthe barrel were obviously intended to impart a spin to the projectile,\nto give it gyroscopic stability while in flight.\n\nHe tossed the weapon aside. Now there was a certain compassion in his\nthoughts as he looked again at the dead thing. It must surely have\nthought it was faced with a wild animal, the Nipe decided. Surely no\nbeing would carry a weapon for use against members of its own or\nanother intelligent species.\n\nHe examined the rest of the equipment on the thing. There was very\nlittle further information. The fabric in which it wrapped itself was\ncrude, but ingeniously put together, and its presence indicated that the\nbeing needed some sort of protection against the temperature. It\nappeared to have a thermal insulating quality. Evidently the creature\nwas used to a warmer climate. That served as additional information to\nhelp substantiate his observation from space that the areas farther\nsouth were the ones containing the major centers of population. The tilt\nof this planet on its axis would tend to give the weather a cyclic\nvariation, but it appeared that the areas around the poles remained\nfairly cold even when the incidence of radiation from the primary was at\nmaximum.\n\nIt would have been good, he decided, if he had stopped the slave-animal.\nThere had been more equipment on the thing's back which would have given\nhim more information upon which to base a judgment as to the level of\ncivilization of the dead being. That, however, was no longer\npracticable, so he dismissed the thought from his mind.\n\nThe next question was, what should he do with the body?\n\nShould he dispose of it properly, as one should with a validly slain\nfoe?\n\nIt didn't seem that he could do anything else, and yet his stomachs\nwanted to rebel at the thought. After all, it wasn't as if the thing\nwere really a proper being. It was astonishing to find another\nintelligent race; none had ever been found before, although the\nexistence of such had been postulated. There were certain criteria that\nmust be met by any such beings, however.\n\nIt must have manipulatory organs, such as this being very obviously did\nhave--organs very much like his own. But there were only two, which\nargued that the being lacked dexterity. The organs for walking were\nencased in protective clothing too stiff to allow them to be used as\nmanipulators.\n\nHe ripped off one of the boots and looked at the exposed foot. The thumb\nwas not opposed. Obviously such an organ was not much good for\nmanipulation.\n\nHe pried open the eating orifice and inspected it carefully. Ah! The\ncreature was omnivorous, judging by its teeth. There were both rending\nand grinding teeth. That certainly argued for intelligence, since it\nshowed that the being could behave in a gentlemanly fashion. Still, it\nwas not conclusive.\n\nIf they _were_ intelligent, it was most certainly necessary for him to\nshow that he was also civilized and a gentleman. On the other hand, the\nslowness and lack of strength of this particular specimen argued that\nthe species was of a lower order than the Nipe, which made the question\neven more puzzling.\n\nIn the end, the question was rendered unnecessary for the time being,\nsince the problem was taken out of his hands.\n\nA sound came from the ground a few yards away. It was an insistent\nbuzzing. Cautiously, the Nipe approached the thing.\n\n_Buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzzzzzz!_\n\nIt was an instrument of some kind. He recognized it as the device that\nhe had seen the dead being speak into while he, himself, had been\nwatching from the concealment of the undergrowth, trying to decide\nwhether or not to approach. The device was obviously a communicator of\nsome kind, and someone at the other end was trying to make contact.\n\nIf it were not answered, whoever was calling would certainly deduce that\nsomething had gone wrong at this end. And, of course, there was no way\nfor it to be answered.\n\nIt would be necessary, then, to leave the body here for others of its\nkind to find. Doubtless they would dispose of it properly.\n\nHe would have to leave quickly. It was necessary that he find one of\ntheir centers of production or supply, and he would have to do it alone,\nwith only the equipment he had on him. The utter destruction of his ship\nhad left him seriously hampered.\n\nHe began moving, staying in the protection of the trees. He had no way\nof knowing whether investigators would come by air or on the\nslave-animals, and there was no point in taking chances.\n\nHis sense of ethics still bothered him. It was not at all civilized to\nleave a body at the mercy of lesser animals or monocells in that\nfashion. What kind of monster would they think he was?\n\nStill, there was no help for it. If they caught him, they might think\nhim a lower animal and shoot him. He would not have put an onus like\nthat upon them.\n\nHe moved on.\n\n\n\n\n_[4]_\n\n\nGovernment City was something of a paradox. It was the largest capital\ncity, in terms of population, that had ever been built on Earth, and\nyet, again in terms of population, it was nowhere near as large as Tokyo\nor London. The solution to the paradox lies in discovering that the term\n\"population\" is used in two different senses, thus exposing the logical\nfallacy of the undistributed middle. If, in referring to London or\nTokyo, the term \"population\" is restricted to those and only those who\nare actively engaged in the various phases of actual government--as it\nis when referring to Government City--the apparent paradox resolves\nitself.\n\nBuilt on the slagged-down remains of New York's Manhattan Island, which\nhad been destroyed by a sun bomb during the Holocaust nearly a century\nbefore, Government City occupied all but the upper three miles of the\nisland, and the population consisted almost entirely of men and women\nengaged, either directly or indirectly, in the business of governing a\nplanet. There were no shopping centers and no entertainment areas. The\nsmall personal flyer, almost the same size as the old gasoline-driven\nautomobile, could, because of its inertia drive, move with the\nthree-dimensional ability of a hummingbird, so the rivers that cut the\nisland off from the mainland were no barrier. The shopping and\nentertainment centers of Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey were only five\nminutes away, even through the thickest, slowest-moving traffic. It was\nthe personal flyer, not the clumsy airplane, that had really eliminated\ndistance along with national boundaries.\n\nThe majority of the government officers' homes were off the island, too,\nbut this commuting did not cause any great fluctuation of the island's\npopulation. A city that governs a planet must operate at full capacity\ntwenty-four hours a day, and there was a \"rush hour\" every three hours\nas the staggered six-hour shifts changed.\n\nPhysically the planet still revolved about the sun; politically, Earth\nrevolved around Government City.\n\nIn one of the towering buildings a group of men sat comfortably in a\nmedium-sized room, watching a screen that, because of the\nthree-dimensional quality and the color fidelity of the scene it showed,\nmight have been a window, except that the angle was wrong. They were\nlooking down from an apparent height of forty feet on a clearing in a\npaper-tree forest in Siberia.\n\nThe clearing was not a natural one. The trees had been splintered,\nuprooted, and pushed away from the center of the long, elliptical area.\nThe center of the area was apparently empty.\n\nOne of the men, whose fingers were touching a control panel in the arm\nof his chair, said: \"That is where the ship made its crash landing. As\nyou can see from the relatively light damage, it was moving at no great\nspeed when it hit. From the little information we have--mostly from a\nmomentary radar recording made when the incoming vessel was picked up\nfor a few seconds by the instruments of Transpolar Airways, when it\ncrossed the path of one of their freight orbits--it is estimated that\nthe craft was decelerating at between fifteen and seventeen gravities.\nThe rate of change of acceleration in centimeters per second cubed is\nunknown, but obviously so small as to be negligible.\n\n\"This picture was taken by the fire prevention flyers that came in\nresponse to an urgent call by the assistant of the forest ranger who was\nin charge of this section.\"\n\n\"There was no fire?\" asked one of the other men, looking closely at the\nimage.\n\n\"None,\" said the speaker. \"We can't yet say what actually happened to\nthe ship. We have only a couple of hints. One of our weather observers,\norbiting at four hundred miles, picked up a tremendous flash of hard\nultraviolet radiation in the area around the three thousand \u00c5ngstrom\nband. There must have been quite a bit of shorter wavelength radiation,\nbut the Earth's atmosphere would filter most of it out.\n\n\"A recording of the radiophone discussion between the ranger and his\nassistant is the only other description we have. The ranger described a\nbluish glow over the site. Part of that may have been due to actual\nblue light given off by the--well, call it 'burning'; that word will do\nfor now. But some of the blue glow was almost certainly due to\nionization of the air by the hard ultraviolet. Look at this next\npicture.\"\n\nThe scene remained the same, and yet there was a definite change.\n\n\"This was taken three days later. If you'll notice, the normal rust-red\nof the foliage has darkened to a purplish brown in the area around the\ncrash site. Now a Martian paper-tree, even in the mutated form, is quite\nresistant to U-V, since it evolved under the thin atmosphere of Mars,\nwhich gives much less protection from ultraviolet radiation than Earth's\ndoes. Nevertheless, those trees have a bad case of sunburn.\"\n\n\"And no heat,\" said a third man. \"Wow.\"\n\n\"Oh, there was some heat, but not anywhere near what you'd expect. The\nnearer trees were rather dry, as though they'd been baked, but only at\nthe surface, and the temperature probably didn't rise much above\none-fifty centigrade.\"\n\n\"How about X rays?\" asked still another man. \"Anything shorter than a\nhundred \u00c5ngstroms detected?\"\n\n\"No. If there was any radiation that hard, there was no detector close\nenough to measure it. We doubt, frankly, whether there was any.\"\n\n\"The 'fire', if you want to call it that, must have stunk up the place\npretty badly,\" said one of the men dryly.\n\n\"It did. There were still traces of ozone and various oxides of nitrogen\nin the air when the fire prevention flyers arrived. The wind carried\nthem away from the ranger, so he didn't get a whiff of them.\"\n\n\"And this--this 'fire'--it destroyed the ship completely?\"\n\n\"Almost completely. There are some lumps of metal around, but we can't\nmake anything of them yet. Some of them are badly fused, but that\ndamage was probably done before the ship landed. Certainly there was not\nenough heat generated after the crash to have done that damage.\" His\nhand moved over the control panel in the armrest of his chair, and the\nscene changed.\n\n\"This was taken from the ground. Those lumps you see are the pieces of\nmetal I was talking about. Notice the fine white powdery ash, which\ncaused the white spot that you could see from the air. That is evidently\nall that is left of the hull and the rest of the ship. None of it is\nradioactive.\n\n\"Random samplings from various parts of the area show that the ash\nconsists of magnesium, lithium, and beryllium carbonates.\"\n\n\"You don't mean oxides?\" said one of the others.\n\n\"No. I mean carbonates. And some silicate. We estimate that the\nremaining ash could not have constituted more than ten percent of the\ntotal mass of the hull of the ship. The rest of it vaporized, apparently\ninto carbon dioxide and water.\"\n\n\"Some kind of plastic?\" hazarded one of the men.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, if you want to use a catchall term like 'plastic'. But\nwhat kind of plastic goes to pieces like that?\"\n\nThat rhetorical question was answered by a silence.\n\n\"There's no doubt,\" said one of them after a moment, \"that\ncircumstantial evidence alone would link the alien with the ship. But\nhave you any more conclusive evidence?\"\n\nThe hand moved, and the scene changed again. It was not a pretty scene.\n\n\"That, as you can see, is a closeup of the late Wang Kulichenko, the\nforest ranger who was the only man ever to see the alien ship before it\nwas destroyed. Notice the peculiar bruises on the cheek and ear--the\nwhole side of the head. The pattern is quite similar on the other side\nof the head.\"\n\n\"It looks--umm--rather like a handprint.\"\n\n\"It is. Kulichenko was slapped--_hard!_--on both sides of his head. It\ncrushed his skull.\" There was an intake of breath.\n\n\"This next picture--\" The scene changed. \"--shows the whole body. If\nyou'll look closely you'll see the same sort of prints on the ground\naround it. All very much like handprints. And that ties in very well\nwith the photographs of the alien itself.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about it,\" said one of the others. \"The connection is\ndefinitely there.\"\n\nThe lecturer's hand moved over the control panel again, and suddenly the\nscreen was filled with the image of an eight-limbed horror with four\nglaring violet eyes. In spite of themselves, a couple of the men gasped.\nThey had seen photographs before, but a full-sized three-dimensional\ncolor projection is something else again.\n\n\"Until three weeks ago, we knew of no explanation for the peculiar\nhappenings in northern Asia. After eight months of investigation, we\nfound ourselves up against a blank wall. Nothing could account for that\npeculiar fire nor for the queer circumstances surrounding the death of\nthe forest ranger. The investigators suspected an intelligent alien\nlife-form, but--well, the notion simply seemed too fantastic. Attempts\nto trail the being by means of those peculiar 'footprints' failed. They\nended at a riverbank and apparently never came out again. We know now\nthat it swam downstream for over a hundred miles. Little wonder it got\naway.\n\n\"Even those investigators who suspected something non-human pictured the\nbeing as humanoid, or, rather, anthropoid in form. The prints certainly\nsuggest those of an ape. There appeared to be four of them, judging by\nthe prints--although frequently there were only three and sometimes only\ntwo. It all depended on how many of his 'feet' he felt like walking\non.\"\n\n\"And then the whole herd of them dived into a river and never came up\nagain, eh?\" remarked one of the listeners.\n\n\"Exactly. You can see why the investigators kept the whole thing quiet.\nNothing more was seen, heard, or reported for eight months.\n\n\"Then, three weeks ago, a non-vision phone call was received by the\nsecretary of the Board of Regents of the Khrushchev Memorial Psychiatric\nHospital in Leningrad. An odd, breathy voice, speaking very bad Russian,\noffered a meeting. It was the alien. He managed to explain, in spite of\nthe language handicap, that he did not want to be mistaken for a wild\nanimal, as had happened with the forest ranger.\n\n\"The secretary, Mr. Rogov, felt that the speaker was probably deranged,\nbut, as he said later, there was something about that voice that didn't\nsound human. He said he would make arrangements, and asked the caller to\ncontact him again the next day. The alien agreed. Rogov then--\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" one of the men interrupted apologetically, \"but did he\nlearn Russian all by himself, or has it been established that someone\ntaught him the language?\"\n\n\"The evidence is that he learned it all by himself, from scratch, in\nthose eight months.\"\n\n\"I see. Excuse my interruption. Go on.\"\n\n\"Mr. Rogov was intrigued by the story he had heard. He decided to check\non it. He made a few phone calls, asking questions about a mysterious\ncrash in the paper forests, and the death of a forest ranger. Naturally\nthose who _did_ know were curious about how Mr. Rogov had learned so\nmuch about the incident. He told them.\n\n\"By the time the alien made his second call, a meeting had been\narranged. When he showed up, those of the Board who were still of the\nopinion that the call had been made by a crank or a psychosis case\nchanged their minds very rapidly.\"\n\n\"I can see why,\" murmured someone.\n\n\"The alien's ability to use Russian is limited,\" the speaker continued.\n\"He picked up vocabulary and grammatical rules very rapidly, but he\nseemed completely unable to use the language beyond discussion of\nconcrete objects and actions. His mind is evidently too alien to enable\nhim to do more than touch the edges of human communication.\n\n\"For instance, he called himself 'Nipe' or 'Neep', but we don't know\nwhether that refers to him as an individual or as a member of his race.\nSince Russian lacks both definite and indefinite articles, it is\npossible that he was calling himself 'a Nipe' or 'the Nipe'. Certainly\nthat's the impression he gave.\n\n\"In the discussions that followed, several peculiarities were noticed,\nas you can read in detail in the reports that the Board and the\nGovernment staff prepared. For instance, in discussing mathematics the\nNipe seemed to be completely at a loss. He apparently thought of\nmathematics as a _spoken_ language rather than a _written_ one and could\nnot progress beyond simple diagrams. That's just one small example. I'm\njust trying to give you a brief outline now; you can read the reports\nfor full information.\n\n\"He refused to allow any physical tests on his body, and, short of\nthreatening him at gunpoint, there was no practicable way to force him\nto accede to our wishes. Naturally, threats were out of the question.\"\n\n\"Couldn't X rays have been taken surreptitiously?\" asked one of the men.\n\n\"It was discussed and rejected. We have no way of knowing what his\ntolerance to radiation is, and we didn't want to harm him. The same\napplies to using any anesthetic gas or drug to render him unconscious.\nThere was no way to study his metabolism without his co-operation\nunless we were willing to risk killing him.\"\n\n\"I see. Naturally we couldn't harm him.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The Nipe had to be treated as an emissary from his home\nworld--wherever that may be. He has killed a man, yes. But that has to\nbe allowed as justifiable homicide in self-defense, since the forester\nhad drawn a gun and was ready to fire. Nobody can blame the late Wang\nKulichenko for that, but nobody can blame the Nipe, either.\"\n\nThey all looked for a moment in silence at the violet eyes that gazed at\nthem from the screen.\n\n\"For nearly three weeks,\" the speaker went on, \"humans and Nipe tried to\narrive at a meeting of minds, and, just when it would seem that such a\nmeeting was within grasp, it would fade away into mist. It was only\nthree days ago that the Russian psychologists and psychiatrists realized\nthat the reason the Nipe had come to them was because he had thought\nthat the Board of Regents of the hospital was the ruling body of that\nterritory.\"\n\nSomeone chuckled, but there was no humor in it.\n\n\"Now we come to yesterday morning,\" said the speaker. \"This is the\nimportant part at this very moment, because it explains why I feel we\nmust immediately take steps to tell the public what has happened, why I\nfeel that it is necessary to put a man like Colonel Walther Mannheim in\ncharge of the Nipe affair and keep him in charge until the matter is\ncleared up. Because the public is going to be scared witless if we don't\ndo something to reassure them.\"\n\n\"What happened yesterday morning, Mr. President?\" one of the men asked.\n\n\"The Nipe got angry, lost his temper, went mad--whatever you want to\ncall it. At the morning meeting he simply became more and more\nincomprehensible. The psychologists were trying to see if the Nipe had\nany religious beliefs, and, if so, what they were. One of them, a Dr.\nValichek, was explaining the various religious sects and rites here on\nEarth. Suddenly, with no warning whatever, the Nipe chopped at\nValichek's throat with an open-hand judo cut, killing him. He killed two\nmore men before he leaped out of the window and vanished.\n\n\"No trace of him was found until late last night. He killed another man\nin Leningrad--we have since discovered that it was for the purpose of\nstealing his personal flyer. The Nipe could be anywhere on Earth by\nnow.\"\n\n\"How was the man killed, Mr. President? With bare hands, as the others\nwere?\"\n\n\"We have no way of knowing. Identification of the body was made\ndifficult by the fact that every shred of flesh had been stripped away.\nIt had been gnawed--literally _eaten_--to the bone!\"\n\n\n\n\n_FIRST INTERLUDE_\n\n\nThe big man with the tiny child on his shoulder pushed through the air\ncurtain that kept the warm humid air out of the shop.\n\n\"There,\" he said to the little boy softly, turning his head to look up\ninto the round, chubby, smiling face. \"There. Isn't that nicer, huh?\nIsn't that better than that hot old air outside?\"\n\n\"Gleefle-ah,\" said the child with a grin.\n\n\"Oh, come on, boy. I've heard you manage bigger words than that. Or is\nit your brother?\" He chuckled and headed toward the drug counter.\n\n\"Hey, Jim!\"\n\nThe big man brought himself up short and turned--carefully, so as not to\njiggle the baby on his shoulder. When he saw the shorter, thinner man,\nhe grinned hugely. \"Jinks! By God! Jinks! Watch it! Don't shake the hand\ntoo hard or I'll drop this infant. God damn, man, I thought you were in\nSiberia!\"\n\n\"I was, Jim, but a man can't stay in Siberia forever. Is that minuscule\nlump of humanity your own?\"\n\n\"Yup, yup. So I've been led to believe. Say hello to your Uncle Jinks,\nyoung 'un. C'mon, say hello.\"\n\nThe child jammed the three fingers of his left hand into his mouth and\nrefused to say a word. His eyes widened with an unfathomable\nbaby-emotion.\n\n\"Well, he's got your eyes,\" said the thinner man. \"Fortunately, he's\ngoing to look like his mother instead of being ugly. He _is_ a he, isn't\nhe?\"\n\n\"That's right. Mother's looks, father's plumbing. I got another just\nlike him, but his mother's taking the other one to the doctor to get rid\nof the sniffles. Don't want this one to catch it.\"\n\n\"Twins?\"\n\n\"Naw,\" said the big man sarcastically, \"Octuplets. The Government took\nseventy-five percent for taxes.\"\n\n\"Ask a silly question, get a silly answer,\" the smaller man said\nphilosophically.\n\n\"Yup. So how's the Great Northern Wasteland, Jinks?\"\n\n\"Cold,\" said Jinks, \"but it's not going to be a wasteland much longer,\nJim. Those Martian trees are going to be a big business in fifteen\nyears. There'll be forests all over the tundra. They'll make a hell of a\nfine income crop for those people. We've put in over five thousand\nsquare miles in seedlings during the past five years. The first ones\nwill be ready to harvest in ten years, and from then on, it will be as\nregular as clockwork.\"\n\n\"That's great. Great. How long'll you be in town, Jinks?\"\n\n\"About a week. Then I've got to head back to Siberia.\"\n\n\"Well, look, could you drop around some evening? We could kill off a few\nbottles of beer after we eat one of Ellen's dinners. How about it?\"\n\n\"I'd love to. Sure Ellen won't mind?\"\n\n\"She'll be tickled pink to see you. How about Wednesday?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm free Wednesday evening. But you ask Ellen first. I'll give\nyou a call tomorrow evening to make sure I won't get a chair thrown at\nme when I come in the door.\"\n\n\"Great! I'll let her do the inviting, then.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Jinks said, \"I've got half an hour or so right now. Let me buy\nyou a beer. Or don't you want to take the baby in?\"\n\n\"No, it's not that, but I've got to run. I just dropped in to get a\ncouple of things, then I have to get on out to the plant. Some piddling\nlittle thing came up, and they want to talk to me about it.\" He patted\nthe baby's leg. \"Nothing personal, pal,\" he said in a soft aside.\n\n\"You taking the baby into an atomic synthesis plant?\" Jinks asked.\n\n\"Why not? It's safe as houses. You've still got the Holocaust Jitters,\nmy friend. He'll be safer there than at home. Besides, I can't just\nleave him in a locker, can I?\"\n\n\"I guess not. Just don't let him get his genes irradiated,\" Jinks said,\ngrinning. \"So long. I'll call tomorrow at twenty hundred.\"\n\n\"Fine. See you then. So long.\"\n\nThe big man adjusted the load on his shoulder and went on toward the\ncounter.\n\n\n\n\n_[5]_\n\n\nTwo-fifths of a second. That was all the time Bart Stanton had from the\nfirst moment his supersensitive ears heard the first faint whisper of\nmetal against leather.\n\nHe made good use of the time.\n\nThe noise had come from behind and slightly to the left of him, so he\ndrew his left-hand weapon and spun to the left as he dropped to a\ncrouch. He had turned almost completely around, drawn his gun, and fired\nthree shots before the other man had even leveled his own weapon.\n\nThe bullets from Stanton's gun made three round spots on the man's\njacket, almost touching each other, and directly over the heart. The man\nblinked stupidly for a moment, looking down at the spots.\n\n\"My God,\" he said softly.\n\nThen he returned his own weapon slowly to its holster.\n\nThe big room was noisy. The three shots had merely added to the noise of\nthe gunfire that rattled intermittently around the two men. And even\nthat gunfire was only a part of the cacophony. The tortured molecules of\nthe air in the room were so besieged by the beat of drums, the blare of\ntrumpets, the crackle of lightning, the rumble of heavy machinery, the\nsquawks and shrieks of horns and whistles, the rustle of autumn leaves,\nthe machine-gun snap of popping popcorn, the clink and jingle of falling\ncoins, and the yelps, bellows, howls, roars, snarls, grunts, bleats,\nmoos, purrs, cackles, quacks, chirps, buzzes, and hisses of a myriad of\nanimals, that each molecule would have thought that it was being shoved\nin a hundred thousand different directions at once if it had had a mind\nto think with.\n\nThe noise wasn't deafening, but it was certainly all-pervasive.\n\nBart Stanton had reholstered his own weapon and half opened his lips to\nspeak when he heard another sound behind him.\n\nAgain he whirled, his guns in his hands--both of them this time--and his\nforefingers only fractions of a millimeter from the point that would\nfire the hair triggers.\n\nBut he did not fire.\n\nThe second man had merely shifted the weapons in his holsters and then\ndropped his hands away.\n\nThe noise, which had been flooding the room over the speaker system,\ndied instantly.\n\nStanton shoved his guns back into place and rose from his crouch. \"Real\ncute,\" he said, grinning. \"I wasn't expecting that one.\"\n\nThe man he was facing smiled back. \"Well, Bart, perhaps we have proved\nour point. What do you think, Colonel?\" The last was addressed to the\nthird man, who was still standing quietly, looking worried and surprised\nabout the three spots on his jacket that had come from the special\nharmless projectiles in Stanton's gun.\n\nColonel Mannheim was four inches shorter than Stanton's five-ten, and\nwas fifteen years older. But in spite of the differences, he would have\nlaughed if anyone had told him five minutes before that he couldn't\noutdraw a man who was standing with his back turned.\n\nHis bright blue eyes, set deep beneath craggy brows in a tanned face,\nlooked speculatively at the younger man.\n\n\"Incredible,\" he said gently. \"Absolutely incredible.\" Then he looked at\nthe other man, a lean civilian with mild blue eyes a shade lighter than\nhis own. \"All right, Farnsworth; I'm convinced. You and your staff have\nquite literally created a superman. Anyone who can stand in a\nnoise-filled room and hear a man draw a gun twenty feet behind him is\nincredible enough. The fact that he could and did outdraw and outshoot\nme after I had started--well, that's almost beyond comprehension.\"\n\nHe looked back at Bart Stanton. \"What's your opinion? Do you think you\ncan handle the Nipe, Stanton?\"\n\nStanton paused imperceptibly before answering, while his ultrafast mind\nconsidered the problem before arriving at a decision. Just how much\nconfidence should he show the colonel? Mannheim was a man with\ntremendous confidence in his own abilities, but who was nevertheless\ncapable of recognizing that there were men who were his superiors in one\nfield or another.\n\n\"If I can't dispose of the Nipe,\" Stanton said, \"no one can.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim nodded slowly. \"I believe you're right,\" he said at\nlast. His voice was firm with inner conviction. He shot a glance at\nFarnsworth. \"How about the second man?\"\n\nFarnsworth shook his head. \"He'll never make it. In another two years we\ncan put him into reasonable shape again, but his nervous system just\ncouldn't stand the gaff.\"\n\n\"Can we get another man ready in time?\"\n\n\"Hardly. We can't just pick a man up off the street and turn him into a\nsuperman. Even if we could find another subject with Bart's genetic\npossibilities, it would take more time than we have to spare.\"\n\n\"No way at all of cutting the time down?\"\n\n\"This isn't magic, Colonel,\" Farnsworth said. \"You don't change a nobody\ninto a physical and mental giant by saying _abracadabra_ or by teaching\nhim how to pronounce _shazam_ properly.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that,\" said the colonel without rancor. \"It's just that I\nkeep feeling that five years of work on Mr. Stanton should have taught\nyou enough to be able to repeat the process in less time.\"\n\nFarnsworth repeated the head-shaking. \"Human beings aren't machines,\nColonel. They require time to heal, time to learn, time to integrate\nthemselves. Remember that, in spite of our increased knowledge of\nanesthesia, antibiotics, viricides, and obstetrics, it still takes nine\nmonths to produce a baby. We're in the same position, if not more so.\nAfter all, we can't even allow for a premature delivery.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Mannheim.\n\n\"Besides,\" Dr. Farnsworth continued, \"Stanton's body and nervous system\nare now close to the theoretical limit for human tissue. I'm afraid you\ndon't realize what kind of mental stability and organization are\nrequired to handle the equipment he has now.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't,\" Colonel Mannheim agreed. \"I doubt if anyone besides\nStanton himself _really_ knows.\" He looked at Bart Stanton. \"That's it\nthen, son. You're it. You're the only answer we've found so far. And the\nonly answer visible in the foreseeable future to the problem posed by\nthe Nipe.\"\n\nThe colonel's face seemed to darken. \"Ten years,\" he said in a low\nvoice. \"Ten years that inhuman monster has been loose on Earth. He's\nbecome a legend. He's replaced Satan, the Bogeyman, Frankenstein's\nmonster, and Mumbo Jumbo, Lord of the Congo, in the public mind. Read\nthe newsfacs, watch the newscasts. Take a look at popular fiction. He's\neverywhere at once. He can do anything. He's taken on the attributes of\nthe djinn, the vampire, the ghoul, the werewolf, and every other horror\nand hobgoblin that the mind of man has conjured up in the past half\nmillion years.\"\n\n\"That's hardly surprising, Colonel,\" Bart Stanton said with a wry smile.\n\"If a human being had gone on a ten-year rampage of robbery and murder,\nshowing himself as callously indifferent to human life and property as\nyou and I would be to the life and property of a cockroach, and if, in\naddition, he proved impossible to catch, such a person would be looked\nupon as a demon too. And if you add to that the fact that the Nipe is\n_not_ human, that he is as frightening in appearance as he is in\nactions, what can you expect?\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Dr. Farnsworth. \"Look at Jack the Ripper and consider\nhow he terrorized London a couple of centuries ago.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"There have been human criminals whose\nactions could be described as 'inhuman', but the Nipe has some touches\nthat few human criminals have thought of and almost none would have the\ncapacity to execute. If he has time to spare, his victims become an\nannoying problem in identification when they're found. He leaves nothing\nbut well-gnawed bones. And by 'time to spare', I mean twenty or thirty\nminutes. The damned monster has a very efficient digestive tract, if\nnothing else. He eats like a shrew.\"\n\n\"And if he doesn't have time, he beats them to death,\" Bart Stanton said\nthoughtfully.\n\nColonel Mannheim frowned. \"Not exactly. According to the evidence--\"\n\nDr. Farnsworth interrupted him. \"Colonel, let's go into the lounge,\nshall we? Aside from the fact that standing around in an empty chamber\nlike this isn't the most comfortable way to discuss the fate of mankind,\nthis room is scheduled for other work.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim grinned, caught up by the touch of lightness that the\nbiophysicist had injected into the conversation. \"Very well. I could do\nwith some coffee, if you have some.\"\n\n\"All you want,\" said Dr. Farnsworth, leading the way toward the door of\nthe chamber and opening it. \"Or, if you'd prefer something with a little\nmore power to it....\"\n\n\"Thanks, no,\" said Mannheim. \"Coffee will do fine. How about you,\nStanton?\"\n\nBart Stanton shook his head. \"I'd love to have some coffee, but I'll\nleave the alcohol alone. I'd just have the luck to be finishing a drink\nwhen our friend, the Nipe, popped in on us. And when I do meet him, I'm\ngoing to need every microsecond of reflex speed I can scrape up.\"\n\nThey walked down a soft-floored, warmly lit corridor to an elevator\nwhich whisked them up to the main level of the Neurophysical Institute\nBuilding.\n\nAnother corridor led them to a room that might have been the common room\nof one of the more exclusive men's clubs. There were soft chairs and\nshelves of books and reading tables and smoking stands, all quietly\nluxurious. There was no one in the room when the three men entered.\n\n\"We can have some privacy here,\" Dr. Farnsworth said. \"None of the rest\nof the staff will come in until we're through.\"\n\nHe walked over to a table, where an urn of coffee radiated soft warmth.\n\"Cream and sugar over there on the tray,\" he said as he began to fill\ncups.\n\nThe cups were filled and the three men sat down in a triangle of chairs\nbefore any of them spoke again. Then Bart Stanton said:\n\n\"I made the remark that if the Nipe doesn't have time to eat his victims\nhe just beats them to death, and you started to say something, Colonel.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim took a sip from his cup before he spoke. \"Yes. I was\ngoing to say that, according to the evidence we have, he _always_ beats\nhis victims to death, whether he manages to eat them or not.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Stanton looked thoughtful.\n\n\"Oh, he's not cruel about it,\" the colonel said. \"He kills quickly and\nneatly. The thing is that he never, under any circumstances, uses any\nweapons except the weapons that nature gave him--hands or feet or claws\nor teeth. He never uses a gun or a knife or even a club. Dr. Yoritomo\nhas some theories about that which I won't go into now. He'll tell you\nabout them pretty soon.\"\n\nStanton thought about the Japanese scientist and smiled. \"I know. Dr.\nYoritomo has threatened to tell me all kinds of theories.\"\n\n\"And believe me he will,\" said Mannheim with a soft chuckle. He took\nanother sip of his coffee and then looked up at Stanton. \"You've been\nthrough five years of hell, Mr. Stanton. In addition, you've been pretty\nmuch isolated here. Dr. Farnsworth, here, has tried to keep you\ninformed, but, as I understand it, it has only been during the last few\nmonths that you've actually been able to absorb and retain information\nreliably. At least, that's the report I get. How do you feel about it?\"\n\nBart Stanton thought for a moment. It was true that he'd been out of\ntouch with what had been going on outside the walls of the Neurophysical\nInstitute for the past five years. In spite of the reading he'd done and\nthe newscasts he'd watched and the TV tapes he'd seen, he still had no\nreal feeling for the situation.\n\nThere had been long hazy periods during that five years. He had\nundergone extensive glandular and neural operations of great delicacy,\nmany of which had resulted in what could have been agonizing pain\nwithout the use of suppressors. As a result of those operations, he\npossessed a biological engine that, for sheer driving power and nicety\nof control, surpassed any other known to exist or to have ever existed\non Earth--with the possible exception of the Nipe. But those five years\nof rebuilding and retraining had left a gap in his life.\n\nSeveral of the steps required to make the conversion from man to\nsuperman had resulted in temporary insanity; the wild, swinging\nimbalances of glandular secretions seeking a new balance, the erratic\nmisfirings of neurons as they attempted to adjust to higher\nnerve-impulse velocities, and the sheer fatigue engendered by cells that\nwere acting too rapidly for a lagging excretory system, all had\ncontributed to periods of greater or lesser abnormality.\n\nThat he was sane now, there was no question. But there were holes in his\nmemory that still had to be filled.\n\nHe admitted as much to Colonel Mannheim.\n\n\"I see.\" The colonel rubbed one hand along the angle of his jaw,\nconsidering his next words. \"Can you give me, in your own words, a\ngeneral summary of the type of thing the Nipe has been doing?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Stanton said.\n\nHis verbal summary was succinct and accurate. The loot that the Nipe had\nbeen stealing had, at first, seemed to be a hodgepodge of everything. It\nwas unpredictable. Money, as such, he apparently had no use for. He had\ntaken gold, silver, and platinum, but one raid for each of these\nelements had evidently been enough, with the exception of silver, which\nhad required three raids over a period of four years. Since then, he\nhadn't touched silver again.\n\nHe hadn't yet tried for any of the radioactives except radium. He'd\ntaken a full ounce of that in five raids, but hadn't attempted to get\nhis hands on uranium, thorium, plutonium, or any of the other elements\nnormally associated with atomic energy. Nor had he tried to steal any of\nthe fusion materials--the heavy isotopes of hydrogen or any of the\nlithium isotopes. Beryllium had been taken, but whether there was any\nsignificance in the thefts or not, no one knew.\n\nThere was a pattern in the thefts and robberies, nonetheless. They had\nbegun small and had increased. Scientific and technical\ninstruments--oscilloscopes, X-ray generators, radar equipment, maser\nsets, dynostatic crystals, thermolight resonators, and so on--were\nstolen complete or gutted for various parts. After a while, he had gone\non to bigger things--whole aircraft, with their crews, had vanished.\n\nThat he had not committed anywhere near all the crimes that had been\nattributed to him was certain; that he _had_ committed a great many of\nthem was equally certain.\n\nThere was no doubt at all that his loot was being used to make\ninstruments and devices of unknown kinds. He had used several of them on\nhis raids. The one that could apparently phase out any electromagnetic\nfrequency up to about a hundred thousand megacycles--including\nsixty-cycle power frequencies--was considered a particularly cute item.\nSo was the gadget that reduced the tensile strength of concrete to about\nthat of a good grade of marshmallow.\n\nAfter he had been operating for a few years, there was no installation\non Earth that could be considered Nipe-proof for more than a few\nminutes. He struck when and where he wanted and took whatever he needed.\n\nIt was manifestly impossible to guard against the Nipe, since no one\nknew what sort of loot might strike his fancy next, and there was\ntherefore no way of knowing where or how he would hit next.\n\nNor could he ever be found after one of his raids. They were plotted and\nfollowed through with diabolical accuracy and thoroughness. He struck,\nlooted, and vanished. And he wasn't seen again until his next strike.\n\nColonel Mannheim, who had carefully puffed a cigar alight and smoked it\nthoughtfully during Stanton's recitation, dropped the remains of the\ncigar into an ash receptacle. \"Accurate but incomplete,\" he said\nquietly. \"You must have made some guesses. I'd like to hear them.\"\n\nStanton finished the last of his coffee and glanced at Dr. Farnsworth.\nThe biophysicist was thoughtfully looking down at his own cup, his\nexpression unreadable.\n\n_All right_, Stanton thought, _he's looking for something. I'll let him\nhave both barrels and see if I hit the target_.\n\n\"I've thought about it,\" he admitted. He got up, went over to the coffee\nurn, and refilled his cup. \"I've got a pet theory of my own. It's just a\nnotion, really. I wouldn't dare reduce it to syllogistic form, because\nit might not hold much water, logically speaking. But the evidence seems\nconclusive enough to me.\"\n\nHe walked back to his seat. Colonel Mannheim was watching him, a look of\ninterest on his face, but he said nothing.\n\n\"To me,\" Stanton said, \"it seems incredible that the combined\nintelligence and organizational ability of the UN Government is\nincapable of finding anything out about one single alien, no matter how\ncompetent he may be. Somehow, somewhere, someone must have gotten a line\non the Nipe. He must have a base for his operations, and someone should\nhave found it by this time.\n\n\"I may be faster and stronger and more sensitive than any other living\nhuman being, but that doesn't mean I have superhuman powers, or that I'm\na magician. And I'm quite certain that you, Colonel, don't credit me\nwith such abilities. You don't believe that I can do in a short time\nwhat the combined forces of the Government couldn't do in ten. Certainly\nyou wouldn't rely too heavily on it.\n\n\"And yet, apparently, you are.\n\n\"To me, that can only mean that you have another ace up your sleeve. You\n_know_ we're going to get the Nipe fairly quickly. You either have a\nsure way of tracing him, or you already know where he is.\n\n\"Which is it?\"\n\nColonel Mannheim sighed. \"We know where he is,\" he said. \"We have known\nfor six years.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[6]_\n\n\nThe Nipe prowled around the huge underground room, carefully checking\nhis alarms. If anyone entered the network of tunnels at any point, the\ninstruments would register that fact. They had to be adjusted, of\ncourse, for the presence of the small, omnivorous quadrupeds that ran\nthrough the tunnels in such numbers, but anything larger than they would\nbe noted immediately.\n\nHe did not like to leave this place. Here, over a period of ten\nrevolutions of this planet about its primary, he had built himself a\nnest that was almost comfortable. Here, too, were his workshops and his\nstorehouses. He had reason to believe that he was safe here, screened\nand protected as he was, but each time he left or entered he ran the\nchance of being observed.\n\nStill, there was no help for it. Thus far, he had been hampered by\ntechnical problems. There were things he needed that he could not make\nfor himself. Even his own vast memory, with its every bit of information\ninstantly available, could only contain what had been acquired over a\nlifetime, and even his long life had not been long enough to acquire\nevery bit of knowledge he needed.\n\nHis work had been long and tedious. There were many things that could\nneither be made in his workshops nor obtained from the natives, things\nhe did not know how to make and which the local species had not yet\nevolved in their own technology. Or, more likely, which had not been\nallowed them. In such cases, he had had to make do with other, lesser\ntechniques, which added to the complexity of his job.\n\nBut now another problem had intruded itself into his schedule.\n\nHe had a name. Colonel Walther Mannheim. The meaning of the verbal\nsymbolism was unknown to him. The patterns of the symbolism were even\nmore evasive than the patterns of the language itself. \"Colonel\" seemed\nsimple enough. It indicated a certain sociomilitary class that was\nrigidly defined in one way and very hazy in another. But the meanings\nand relationships of both \"Walther\" and \"Mannheim\" were beyond him. What\ndifference, for instance, was there between a \"Walther\" and a \"William\"?\nDid a \"Mannheim\" outrank a \"Mandeville\", or the other way around? What\nfunctions differentiated a \"John Smith\" from a \"Peter Taylor\"? He knew\nwhat a \"john\" was and what a \"smith\" was, but \"John Smith\" was not,\napparently, necessarily associated with sanitary plumbing. The meaning\nof some other names eluded him entirely.\n\nBut that made little difference at the moment. The meaning of Colonel\nWalther Mannheim's symbolic nomenclature was secondary in comparison\nwith his known function.\n\nThat required that the Nipe must eventually find and confront Colonel\nWalther Mannheim.\n\nIt meant time lost, of course. It meant that precious time, which should\nbe given to building his communicator, must be given over to what was\nmerely a protective action.\n\nBut there was nothing to do but go on. It would never have occurred to\nthe Nipe to give up, for to quit meant to die. And to die--here,\nnow--was unthinkable.\n\nHis alarms were all functioning, his defenses all set. He could now\nleave his hideaway knowing that if it were broken into while he was away\nhe would be warned in time. But he had no real fear of that. He had done\neverything he could do. And no intelligent creature, to the Nipe's way\nof thinking, would waste time worrying about a situation he could not\nimprove upon.\n\nTaking with him the equipment he needed for the job he had to do, he\nentered the tunnel that ran southward from his base of operations. Once,\nas he moved along, one of the little quadrupeds approached him, its\nteeth bared. With an almost negligent flip of one powerful, superfast\nhand, he slammed it against a nearby wall. It dropped and lay still.\nAnother of its kind approached it cautiously. The Nipe noticed the\napproach with approval. The quadrupeds had no real intelligence, but\nthey had the proper instincts.\n\nAt last the Nipe came to another of the many places where the tunnels\nmet with others of the network. He crossed through several rooms, all\nvery large and cluttered with the dusty, long-dead bones of hundreds of\nthe local intelligent life-form--if (and he was not sure in his own mind\nof this) they could actually be called intelligent. But he moved\ncarefully, stepping over the human bones and the empty, staring skulls.\nThey had apparently been properly devoured, although he could not be\nsure whether it had been done by their own kind or by the little\nquadrupeds. Nonetheless, he would not willingly disturb their repose.\n\nHe went on into the tunnel that led westward and followed it as it began\nto angle down. Finally he came to the water's edge.\n\nTo a human being, the cold expanse of water that gleamed like ink in the\nlight of the Nipe's illuminator would have been a barricade as\nimpenetrable as steel. But to the Nipe the tidal pool was simply another\nof his defenses, for it concealed the only entrance he ever used. He\nwent in after adjusting his scuba mask and began swimming toward the\nopening that led to the estuary of the sea, his eight strong limbs\nworking in unison in a way that would have been the envy of a rowing\nteam.\n\nAt the jagged hole in the tunnel wall, the gap that led into open water,\nhe paused to check his instruments. Only after he was certain that there\nwere no sonar or other detector radiations did he propel himself onward,\nout into the estuary itself.\n\nAn hour later, he was warily circling the spot where his little\nsubmarine was hidden. He pressed a button on a small device in his hand,\nand a signal was sent to the submarine. The various devices within it\nall responded properly. Nothing had been disturbed since the Nipe had\nset those devices weeks before.\n\nThis was the touchiest part of any of his expeditions. There was always\nthe chance, unlikely as it might be, that some one of the bipedal\nnatives had found his machine. He dared not use it too close to his base\nbecause of the possibility of its drive vibrations being detected in the\nnarrow estuary. Out here in the open sea there was far less likelihood\nof that, but leaving his submarine concealed out here increased the\ndanger he exposed himself to every time he left his hidden nest.\n\nSatisfied that the machine was just as he had left it, he entered it and\nstarted its engines. He moved slowly and cautiously until he was well\nout to sea, well away from the continental shelf and over the ocean\ndeeps. Then and only then did he accelerate to full cruising speed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe full moon was in the west, hiding behind an array of low, scudding\nclouds, revealing its radiance in fitful bursts of silvery splendor that\ndied again as another clotted cloud moved before the face of the white\ndisk. The shifting light, shining through the breeze-tossed leaves of\nthe palm trees on the beach below, made strange shadows on the sand,\never-changing patterns of gray and black on a background of white,\nmoonlit sand.\n\nBut the strangest shadow of all was one that did not change as the\nothers did--a great centipede-like shape that seemed to wash slowly\nashore on the receding tide. For a short while, it remained at the\nwater's edge, apparently unmoving in the wash of the waves.\n\nThen, keeping low and balancing himself on his third pair of limbs, the\nNipe moved in across the beach. The specially constructed sandals he\nwore left behind them a set of very human-looking footprints--prints\nthat would remain unnoticed among the myriad of others that were already\non the beach, left there by daytime bathers.\n\nIt required more time yet to reach the city, and still more time to find\nthe place he was looking for. It was almost dawn before he managed to\nfind a storm sewer in which to hide for the day.\n\nIt was partly his difficulty in finding a given spot in a city--almost\nany city--that had convinced the Nipe that the pseudo-intelligence of\nthe bipeds of this planet could not really be called true intelligence.\nThere was no standardized method of orienting oneself in a city. Not\nonly were no two cities alike in their orientation systems, but the same\ncity would often vary from section to section. Their co-ordinate systems\nmeant almost nothing. Part of a given co-ordinate might be a number, and\nthe rest of it a name, but the meanings of the numbers and names were\nnever the same. It was as though some really intelligent outside agency\nhad given them the basic idea of a co-ordinate system, and they, not\nhaving the intelligence to use it properly, had simply jumbled the whole\nthing up.\n\nThat the natives themselves had no real understanding of any such system\nhad long been apparent to him. The dwellers in any one area would\nnaturally be familiar with it; they would know where each place was,\nregardless of what meaningless names and numbers might be attached to\nit. But strangers to that area would not know, and could not know. The\nonly thing they could possibly do would be to ask directions of a local\ncitizen--which, the Nipe had learned, was exactly what they did.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not that simple for the Nipe. There was no way for\nhim to walk up to a native and inquire for an address. He had to prowl\nunseen through the alleys and sewers of a city, picking up a name here,\na number there, by eavesdropping on street conversations. He had found\nthat every city contained certain uniformed individuals whose duty it\nwas to direct strangers, and by focusing a directional microphone on\nsuch men and listening, it was possible to glean little bits of\nknowledge that could eventually be co-ordinated into a whole\nunderstanding of the city's layout. It was a time-consuming process, but\nit was the only way the job could be done. Reconnaissance took a\ntremendous amount of time away from his serious work, but that work\ncould not proceed without materials to work with, and to get those\nmaterials required reconnaissance. The dilemma was unavoidable.\n\nAnd, being what he was, the Nipe accepted the unavoidable and pursued\nhis course with phlegmatic equanimity.\n\nOverhead, the city was beginning to waken. The volume of sound began to\nincrease.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPolice Patrolman John Flanders relieved his fellow officer, Patrolman\nFred Pilsudski, at a few minutes of eight in the morning.\n\nIt was a beautiful day, even for Miami. In the east, the morning sun\nshone brightly through the hard, transparent pressure glass that covered\nthe street, making the smooth, resilient surface of the street itself\nglow with warm light. Overhead, Patrolman Flanders could see the aircars\nin their incessant motion--apparently random, unless one knew what the\ntraffic pattern was and how to look for it. It was Patrolman Flanders'\nimmediate ambition to be promoted to traffic patrol, so that he could be\nin an aircar above the city instead of watching pedestrians down here on\nthe streets.\n\n\"Morning, Fred,\" he said to his brother officer. \"How'd the night go?\"\n\n\"Hi, Johnny. Pretty good. Not much excitement.\" He looked at his\nwristwatch. \"You're a couple minutes early yet.\"\n\n\"Yeah. The baby started singing for his breakfast at a God-awful hour.\nHarriet woke up to feed him, which woke me up, so here I am. If you want\nto give me the call button, I'll take over. You can go get yourself a\ncup of coffee.\"\n\n\"I'm up to here with coffee,\" Pilsudski said, indicating a point just\nbelow his left ear. \"I'll have a beer instead.\"\n\nHe touched a switch at his belt and said: \"Area 37 HQ, this is 13392\nPilsudski.\"\n\nA voice in his helmet phones said: \"37 HQ, go ahead, Pilsudski.\"\n\n\"Time: 0758 hours. I am being relieved by 14278 Flanders.\"\n\n\"Right. Go ahead.\"\n\nPilsudski took off the light, strong helmet, reached inside it, opened a\nsmall sliding panel, and took out an object the size and shape of an\naspirin tablet--the sealed unit that permitted him to understand the\nconversation over the police wave band. Without it, the police calls\nwould have been gibberish.\n\nFlanders accepted the little gadget from the other officer and inserted\nit in his own helmet. Then he replaced the helmet on his head. \"Area 37\nHQ, this is 14278 Flanders. I am relieving 13392 Pilsudski.\"\n\n\"37 HQ,\" said the voice in his ears. \"Okay, Flanders. Transfer\nrecorded.\"\n\nPolice Patrolman John Flanders, Badge Number 14278, was now officially\non duty.\n\nHe looked up into the sky. \"Now there's the place to be on a day like\nthis, Fred. Traffic patrol.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" said Pilsudski. \"Too damn dull. I was on it for six months.\nDamn near drove me nuts. Nobody to talk to but another cop--same cop,\nday after day. He was a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but Christ!\nNothin' to do but watch for people breakin' traffic pattern. Can't even\npull over to the side and watch the traffic go by. It's dull, I'm\ntellin' you, Johnny. I asked for a transfer back to a beat so's I could\nsee some people again.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Flanders. \"I'd still like to try it.\"\n\n\"Ever'body to their own taste, I guess. Mitchell and Warber were in luck\nlast night, though. Excitement.\" He sounded as though he meant the word\nto be sarcastic.\n\n\"What happened?\" Flanders asked.\n\n\"Some boob was having a fight with his wife and his air intake was\ngoofing off at the same time. So, while she's yelling at him, he puts\nhis aircar on hover.\" He pointed upward. \"Right up there, in Level Two.\nHe opens the window of his aircar, mind you. His air intake ain't\nworkin', like I said. Mitchell, in Car 87, spots him and heads for him,\nfiguring there's trouble.\"\n\n\"But no trouble?\" asked Flanders.\n\n\"Trouble enough. The driver's old lady throws a wrench at him, an' it\ngoes out the window.\" He chuckled. \"First I heard about it was when that\ndamn wrench comes down and bounces off the pressure glass, then up to\nthe side of the building there, and back to the pressure glass. Then it\nslides off into the rain gutter.\"\n\nFlanders looked up at the curve of hard, tough, almost invisible\npressure glass that covered the street. \"With all the cars overhead that\nwe got in this city,\" Flanders said philosophically, \"something like\nthat's bound to happen every so often. That's why that glass is up\nthere, besides for keepin' the rain off your head.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Pilsudski said. \"Anyway, Mitchell and Warber got there just as\nshe tossed the wrench. Arrested both of 'em. Now, wasn't that exciting?\"\n\nFlanders grinned. \"Fred, if the rest of their tour of duty was as dull\nas you say it was, then I reckon that must have been real exciting.\"\n\n\"Hah.\" Pilsudski shrugged. \"Well, I'm for that beer. See you tomorrow,\nJohnny.\"\n\n\"Right. Take care o' yourself.\"\n\nAs Pilsudski walked away, Flanders put his hands behind his back,\ngrasping the left in the right. He spread his feet slightly apart. In\nthat time-honored position of the foot patrolman, he surveyed his beat,\nup and down both sides of the street. Everything looked perfectly\nnormal. Another working day had begun.\n\nHe had no idea that he was standing only a few yards from the most hated\nand feared killer on the face of the Earth.\n\nThe only clue that he could possibly have had to that killer's presence\nwas a small ovoid the size and shape of a match head, a dark, dull gray\nin color, which protruded slightly from a sewer grating six feet away,\nsupported on a hair-thin stalk. In one end was a tiny dark opening, and\nthat opening was pointed directly at Officer Flanders' head. When he\nbegan walking slowly down the street, the little ovoid moved, turning\nslowly on its stalk to keep that dark hole pointed steadily. It was so\nsmall, that ovoid, and so inconspicuous, that no one, even looking\ndirectly at it, would have noticed it.\n\nThe Nipe could see and hear without being either seen or heard himself.\n\nAll morning long the tiny ovoid remained in place, watching, listening.\n\nAt 11:24 a woman in a cherry-pink dress walked up to Officer Flanders\nand said: \"Pardon me, Officer. Could you tell me where I could find the\nDonahue Building?\"\n\nAnd while the policeman told her, the Nipe listened carefully. Now he\nknew what street he was on and its location in respect to two other\nstreets. He also had a number. He remembered them all, accurately and\ncompletely. It was a good beginning, he decided. It would not be too\nlong before he would have enough to enable him to locate the address he\nwas looking for. After that, there would only remain the job of\nobserving and making plans to get what he wanted at that address.\n\nHe settled himself to wait for more information. He knew that it would\nbe a long wait.\n\nBut he was prepared for that.\n\n\n\n\n_SECOND INTERLUDE_\n\n\nThe woman's eyes were filled with tears, for which the doctor was\nprivately thankful. At least, he thought to himself, the original shock\nhas worn off.\n\n\"And there's nothing we can do?\" she asked. \"Nothing?\" There was anguish\nin her voice.\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" the doctor told her gently. \"Not yet. There are\nresearch men working on the problem, and one day ... perhaps ...\" Then\nhe shook his head. \"But not yet.\" He paused. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Stanton.\"\n\nThe woman sat there in the comfortable chair and looked at the\nspecialist's diploma on the doctor's wall--and yet, she really didn't\nsee the diploma at all. She was seeing something else--a kind of dream\nthat had been shattered.\n\nAfter a moment, she began to speak, her voice low and gentle, as though\nthe dream were still going on and she were half afraid she might waken\nherself if she spoke too loudly.\n\n\"Jim and I were so glad they were twins. Identical twin boys. He said\n... I remember, he said, 'We ought to call them Ike and Mike.' And he\nlaughed a little when he said it, to show he didn't mean it.\"\n\nThe doctor said nothing, waiting for her to go on.\n\n\"I remember, I was propped up in the bed, the afternoon after they were\nborn, and Jim brought me a new bed jacket, and I said I didn't need a\nnew one because I'd be going right home the very next day, and he said,\n'Hell, kid, you don't think I'd buy a bed jacket just for hospital use,\nnow do you? This is for breakfasts in bed, too.'\n\n\"And that's when he said he'd seen the boys and said we ought to name\nthem Ike and Mike.\"\n\nThe tears were coming down Mrs. Stanton's cheeks heavily now, and the\ngrief made her look older than her twenty-four years, but the doctor\nsaid nothing, letting her spill out her emotions in words.\n\n\"We'd talked about it before, you know--soon as the obstetrician found\nout that I was going to have twins. And Jim ... Jim said that we\nshouldn't name them alike unless they were identical twins or mirror\ntwins. If they were fraternal twins, we'd just name them as if they'd\nbeen ordinary brothers or sisters or whatever. You know?\" She looked at\nthe doctor, her eyes pleading for understanding.\n\n\"I know,\" he said.\n\n\"And Jim was always kidding. If they were girls, he said, we ought to\ncall them Flora and Dora, or Annie and Fanny, or maybe Susie and\nFloozie. He was always kidding about it. You know?\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"And then ... and then when they _were_ identical boys, he was very\nsensible about it. He was always so sensible. 'We'll call them Martin\nand Bartholomew,' he said. 'Then if they want to call themselves Mart\nand Bart, they can, but they won't be stuck with any rhyming names if\nthey don't want them.' Jim was always very thoughtful that way, Doctor.\nVery thoughtful.\"\n\nShe seemed suddenly to realize that she was crying and took a\nhandkerchief out of her sleeve to dab at her eyes and face.\n\n\"I'll have to quit crying,\" she said, trying to sound very brave and\nvery strong. \"After all, it could have been worse, couldn't it? I mean,\nthe radiation could have killed my boy, too. Jim's dead, yes, and I've\ngot to get used to that. But I still have two boys to take care of, and\nthey'll need me.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Stanton, they will,\" said the doctor. \"They'll both need you\nvery much. And you'll have to be very gentle and very careful with both\nof them.\"\n\n\"How ... how do you mean that?\" she asked.\n\nThe doctor settled back in his chair and chose his words carefully.\n\"Identical twins tend to identify with each other, Mrs. Stanton. There\nis a great deal of empathy between people who are not only of the same\nage, but genetically identical. If they were both completely healthy,\nthere would normally be very little trouble in their education at home\nor in school. Any of the standard texts on psychodynamics in education\nwill show you the pitfalls to avoid when dealing with identical\nsiblings.\n\n\"But your sons are no longer identical, Mrs. Stanton. One is normal,\nhealthy, and lively. The other is ... well, as you know, he is slow,\nsluggish, and badly co-ordinated. The condition may improve with time,\nbut, until we know more about such damage than we do now, he will remain\nan invalid.\"\n\nHe had been watching her for further signs of emotional upset. But she\nseemed to be listening calmly enough. He went on.\n\n\"That's the trouble with radiation damage, Mrs. Stanton. Even when we\ncan save the victim's life, we cannot always save his health.\n\n\"You can see, I think, what sort of psychic disturbances this might\nbring about in such a pair. The ill boy tends to identify with the well\none, and, oddly enough, the reverse is also true. If they are not\nproperly handled during their formative years, Mrs. Stanton, both can be\nbadly damaged emotionally.\"\n\n\"I ... I think I understand, Doctor,\" the young woman said. \"But what\nsort of thing should I look out for? What sort of things should I\navoid?\"\n\n\"First off, I suggest you get a good man in psychic development,\" the\ndoctor said. \"I, myself, would hesitate to prescribe. It's out of my\nfield. But I can say that, in general, most of your trouble will be\ncaused by a tendency for the pair to swing into one of two extremes.\n\n\"At one extreme, you will have mutual antagonism. This arises when the\nill child becomes jealous of the other's health, while, on the other\nhand, the healthy one becomes jealous of the extra consideration that is\nshown to his crippled brother.\n\n\"At the other extreme, the healthy boy may identify so closely with his\nbrother that he feels every slight or hurt, real or imagined, which the\nill boy is subjected to. He becomes extremely over-solicitous,\nover-protective. At the same time, the invalid brother may come to\ndepend completely on his healthy twin.\n\n\"In both these situations there is a positive feedback that constantly\nworsens the condition. It requires a great deal of careful observation\nand careful application of the proper educational stimuli to keep the\nsituation from developing toward either extreme. You'll need expert help\nif you want both boys to display the full abilities of which they are\npotentially capable.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the woman said. \"Could you give me the name of a good man,\nDoctor?\"\n\nThe doctor nodded and picked up a book on his desk. \"I'll give you the\nnames of several. You can pick the one you like best, the one with whom\nyou seem to be most comfortable. Try several or all of them before you\ndecide. They're all good men. There are many good women in the field,\ntoo, but in this case I think a man would be best. Of course, if one of\nthem thinks a woman is indicated, that's up to him. As I said, that\nisn't my field.\"\n\nHe opened the small book and riffled through it to find the names he\nwanted.\n\n\n\n\n_[7]_\n\n\nThe image of the Nipe on the glowing screen was clear and finely\ndetailed. It was, Stanton thought, as though one were looking through a\nwindow into the Nipe's nest itself. Only the tremendous depth of focus\nof the lens that had caught the picture gave the illusion a feeling of\nunreality. Everything--background and foreground alike--was sharply in\nfocus.\n\nLike some horrendous dream monster, the Nipe moved in slow motion,\ngiving Stanton the eerie feeling that the alien was moving through a\nthicker, heavier medium than air, in a place where the gravity was much\nless than that of Earth. With ponderous deliberation, the fingers of one\nof his hands closed upon the handle of an oddly shaped tool and lifted\nit slowly from the surface upon which he worked.\n\n\"That's our best-placed camera,\" said Colonel Mannheim, \"but some of the\nothers can always get details that this one doesn't. The trouble is\nthat we'll never really have enough cameras in there--not unless we stud\nthe walls, ceilings, and floors with them, and even then I'm not so sure\nwe'd get everything. It isn't the same as having a trained expert on\ncamera who is _trying_ to demonstrate what he's doing. An expert plays\nto the camera and never obstructs any of his own movements. But the\nNipe ...\" He left the sentence unfinished and shook his head sadly.\n\nStanton narrowed his eyes at the image. To his own speeded-up perceptive\nprocesses, the motion seemed intolerably slow. \"Would you mind speeding\nit up a little?\" he asked the colonel. \"I want to get an idea of the way\nhe moves, and I can't really get the feeling of it at this speed.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" The colonel turned to the technician at the controls.\n\"Speed the tape up to normal. If there's anything Mr. Stanton wants to\nlook at more closely, we can run it through again.\"\n\nAs if in obedience to the colonel's command, the Nipe seemed to shake\nhimself a little and go about his business more briskly, and the air and\ngravity seemed to revert to those of Earth.\n\n\"What's he doing?\" Stanton asked. The Nipe was performing some sort of\noperation on an odd-looking box that sat on the floor in front of him.\n\nThe colonel pointed. \"He's got a screwdriver that he's modified to give\nit a head with an L-shaped cross section, and he's wiggling it around\ninside that hole in the box. But what he's doing is a secret between God\nand the Nipe at this point,\" Colonel Mannheim said glumly.\n\nStanton glanced away from the screen for a moment to look at the other\nmen who were there. Some of them were watching the screen, but most of\nthem seemed to be watching Stanton, although they looked away as soon as\nthey saw his eyes on them. All, that is, except Dr. George Yoritomo,\nwho simply gave him a smile of confidence.\n\n_Trying to see what kind of a bloke this touted superman is_, Stanton\nthought. _Well, I can't say I blame 'em._\n\nHe brought his attention back to the screen.\n\nSo this was the Nipe's hideaway. He wondered if it were furnished in the\nfashion that a Nipe's living quarters would be furnished on whatever\nplanet the multilegged horror had come from. Probably it had the same\nsimilarity as Robinson Crusoe's island home had to a middle-class\nnineteenth-century English home.\n\nThere was no furniture in it at all, as such. Low-slung as he was, the\nNipe needed no tables or workbenches; all his work was spread out on the\nfloor, with a neatness and tidiness that would have surprised many human\ntechnicians. For the same reason, he needed no chairs, and, since true\nsleep was a form of metabolic rest he evidently found unnecessary, he\nneeded no bed. The closest thing he did that might be called sleep was\nhis habit of stopping whatever he was doing and remaining quiet for\nperiods of time that ranged from a few minutes to a couple of hours.\nSometimes his eyes remained opened during these periods, sometimes they\nwere closed. It was difficult to tell whether he was sleeping or just\nthinking.\n\n\"The difficulty was in getting cameras in there in the first place,\"\nColonel Mannheim was saying. \"That's why we missed so much of his early\nwork. There! Look at that!\" His finger jabbed at the image.\n\n\"The attachment he's making?\"\n\n\"That's right. Now, it looks as though it's a meter of some kind, but we\ndon't know whether it's a test instrument or an integral and necessary\npart of the machine he's making. The whole machine might even be only a\ntest instrument for something else he's building. Or perhaps a machine\nto make parts for some other machine. After all, he had to start out\nfrom the very beginning--making the tools to make the tools to make the\ntools, you know.\"\n\nDr. Yoritomo spoke for the first time. \"It's not quite as bad as all\nthat, eh, Colonel? We must remember that he had our technology to draw\nupon. If he'd been wrecked on Earth two or three centuries ago, he\nwouldn't have been able to do a thing.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim smiled at the tall, lean man. \"Granted,\" he said\nagreeably, \"but it's quite obvious that there are parts of our\ntechnology that are just as alien to him as parts of his are to us.\nRemember how he went to all the trouble of building a pentode vacuum\ntube for a job that could have been done by transistors he already had\nhad a chance to get and didn't. His knowledge of solid-state physics\nseems to be about a century and a half behind ours.\"\n\nStanton listened. Dr. Yoritomo was, in effect, one of his training\ninstructors. _Advanced Alien Psychology_, Stanton thought; _Seminar\nCourse. The Mental Whys & Wherefores of the Nipe, or How to Outthink the\nEnemy in Twelve Dozen Easy Lessons. Instructor: Dr. George Yoritomo._\n\nThe smile on Yoritomo's face was beatific, but he held up a warning\nfinger. \"Ah, ah, Colonel! We mustn't fall into a trap like that so\neasily. Remember that gimmick he built last year? The one that blinded\nthose people in Baghdad? It had five perfect emeralds in it, connected\nin series with silver wire. Eh?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" the colonel admitted. \"But they weren't used the way we'd\nuse semiconducting materials.\"\n\n\"Indeed not. But the thing _worked_, didn't it? He has a knowledge of\nsolid-state physics that we don't have, and vice versa.\"\n\n\"Which one would you say was ahead of the other?\" Stanton asked. \"I\ndon't mean just in solid-state physics, but in science as a whole.\"\n\n\"That's a difficult question to answer,\" Dr. Yoritomo said thoughtfully.\n\"Frankly, I'd put my money on his technology as encompassing more than\nours--at least, insofar as the physical sciences are concerned.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"He's got things in that little nest\nof his that--\" He stopped and shook his head slowly, as though he\ncouldn't find words.\n\n\"I will say this,\" Yoritomo continued. \"Whatever his great technological\nabilities, our friend the Nipe has plenty of good, solid guts. And\npatience.\" He smiled a little, and then amended his statement. \"From our\nown point of view.\"\n\nStanton looked at him quizzically. \"How do you mean? I was just about to\nagree with you until you tacked that last phrase on. What does point of\nview have to do with it?\"\n\n\"Everything, I should say,\" said Yoritomo. \"It all depends on the\nequipment an individual has. A man, for instance, who rushes into a\nbuilding to save a life, wearing nothing but street clothes, has\ncourage. A man who does the same thing when he's wearing a nullotherm\nsuit is an unknown quantity. There is no way of knowing, from that\naction alone, whether he has courage or not.\"\n\nStanton thought he saw what the scientist was driving at. \"But you're\nnot talking about technological equipment now,\" he said.\n\n\"Not at all. I'm talking about personal equipment.\" He turned his head\nslightly to look at the colonel. \"Colonel Mannheim, do you think it\nwould require any personal courage on Mr. Stanton's part to stand up\nagainst you in a face-to-face gunfight?\"\n\nThe colonel grinned tightly. \"I see what you mean.\"\n\nStanton grinned back rather wryly. \"So do I. No, it wouldn't.\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Yoritomo continued, \"if you were to challenge Mr.\nStanton, would that show courage on your part, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Not really. Foolhardiness, stupidity or insanity--but not courage.\"\n\n\"Ah, then,\" said Yoritomo with a beaming smile, \"neither of you can\nprove you have guts enough to fight the other. Can you?\"\n\nMannheim smiled grimly and said nothing. But Stanton was thinking the\nwhole thing out very carefully. \"Just a second,\" he said. \"That depends\non the circumstances. If Colonel Mannheim, say, knew that forcing me to\nshoot him would save the life of someone more important than\nhimself--or, perhaps, the lives of a great many people--what then?\"\n\nYoritomo bowed his head in a quick nod. \"Exactly. That is what I meant\nby viewpoint. Whether the Nipe has courage or patience or any other\nhuman feeling depends on two things: his own abilities and exactly how\nmuch information he has. A man can perform any action without fear if he\nknows that it will not hurt him--or if he does _not_ know that it\n_will_.\"\n\nStanton thought that over in silence.\n\nThe image of the Nipe was no longer moving. He had settled down into his\n\"sleeping position\"--unmoving, although the baleful violet eyes were\nstill open. \"Cut that off,\" Colonel Mannheim said to the operator.\n\"There's not much to learn from the rest of that tape.\"\n\nAs the image blanked out, Stanton said, \"Have you actually managed to\nbuild any of the devices he's constructed, Colonel?\"\n\n\"Some,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"We have specialists all over the world\nstudying those tapes. We have the advantage of being able to watch every\nstep the Nipe makes, and we know the materials he's been using to work\nwith. But, even so, the scientists are baffled by many of them. Can you\nimagine the time James Clerk Maxwell would have had trying to build a\nmodern television set from tapes like this?\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"You can see, then, why we're depending on you,\" Mannheim said.\n\nStanton merely nodded. The knowledge that he was actually a focal point\nin human history, that the whole future of the human race depended to a\ntremendous extent on him, was a realization that weighed heavily and, at\nthe same time, was immensely bracing.\n\n\"And now,\" the colonel said, \"I'll turn you over to Dr. Yoritomo. He'll\nbe able to give you a great deal more information than I can.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[8]_\n\n\nThe girl moved with the peculiar gliding walk so characteristic of a\nperson walking under low-gravity conditions, and the ease and grace with\nwhich she did it showed that she was no stranger to low-gee. To the\nthree men from Earth who followed her a few paces behind, the gee-pull\nseemed so low as to be almost nonexistent, although it was actually a\nshade over one quarter of that of Earth, the highest gravitational pull\nof any planetoid in the Belt. Their faint feeling of nausea was due\nsimply to their lack of experience with _really_ low gravity--the\nlargest planetoid in the Belt had a surface gravity that was only one\neighth of the pull they were now experiencing, and only one\nthirty-second of the Earth gravity they were used to.\n\nThe planetoid they were on--or rather, _in_--was known throughout the\nBelt simply as Threadneedle Street, and was nowhere near as large as\nCeres. What accounted for the relatively high gravity pull of this tiny\nbody was its spin. Moving in its orbit, out beyond the orbit of Mars, it\nturned fairly rapidly on its axis--rapidly enough to overcome the feeble\ngravitational field of its mass. It was a solid, roughly spherical mass\nof nickel-iron, nearly two thirds of a mile in diameter and, like the\nother inhabited planetoids of the Belt, honeycombed with corridors and\nrooms cut out of the living metal itself. But the corridors and rooms\nwere oriented differently from those of the other planetoids;\nThreadneedle Street made one complete rotation about its axis in\nsomething less than a minute and a half, and the resulting centrifugal\nforce reversed the normal \"up\" and \"down\", so that the center of the\nplanetoid was overhead to anyone walking inside it. It was that fact\nwhich added to the queasiness of the three men from Earth who were\nfollowing the girl down the corridor. They knew that only a few floors\nbeneath them yawned the mighty nothingness of infinite space.\n\nThe girl, totally unconcerned with thoughts of that vast emptiness,\nstopped before a door that led off the corridor and opened it. \"Mr.\nMartin,\" she said, \"these are the gentlemen who have an appointment with\nyou. Mr. Gerrol. Mr. Vandenbosch. Mr. Nguma.\" She called off each name\nas the man bearing it walked awkwardly through the door. \"Gentlemen,\"\nshe finished, \"this is Mr. Stanley Martin.\" Then she left, discreetly\nclosing the door.\n\nThe young man behind the desk in the metal-walled office stood up\nsmiling as the three men entered, offered his hand to each, and shook\nhands warmly. \"Sit down, gentlemen,\" he said, gesturing toward three\nsolidly built chairs that had been anchored magnetically to the\nnickel-iron floor of the room.\n\n\"Well,\" he said genially when the three had seated themselves, \"how was\nthe trip out?\"\n\nHe watched them closely, without appearing to do so, as they made their\npolite responses to his question. He was acquainted with them only\nthrough correspondence; now was his first chance to evaluate them in\nperson.\n\nBarnabas Nguma, a very tall man whose dark brown skin and eyes made a\nsharp contrast with the white of the mass of tiny, crisp curls on his\nhead, smiled when he spoke, but there were lines of worry etched around\nhis eyes. \"Pleasant enough, Mr. Martin. I'm afraid that steady one-gee\nacceleration has left me unprepared for this low gravity.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Stefan Vandenbosch, \"it really isn't so bad, once you get\nused to it. As long as it's steady, I don't mind it.\" He was a rather\nchubby man of average height, with blond hair that was beginning to gray\nat the temples and pale blue eyes that gave his face an expression of\nalmost childlike innocence.\n\nArthur Gerrol, the third man, was almost as light-complexioned as\nVandenbosch. His thinning hair was light brown, and his eyes were a deep\ngray-blue, and the lines in his hard, blocky face gave him a look of\ngrim determination. \"I agree, Stefan. It isn't the low gravity _per se_.\nIt's the doggone surges. We went from one gee to zero when the ship came\nin for a landing at the pole of Threadneedle Street. Then, as we came\nback down here, the gravity kept going up, and that ... what do you call\nit? Coriolis force? Yeah, that's it. It made my head feel as though the\nwhole room was spinning.\" Then, realizing what he'd said, he laughed\nsharply.\n\nThe man behind the desk laughed with him. \"Yes, it is a bit\ndisconcerting at first, but the spin gives enough gee-pull to make a man\nfeel comfortable, once he's used to it. That's one of the reasons why\nThreadneedle Street was picked. As the financial center of the Belt, we\nhave a great many visitors from Earth, and one-quarter gee is a lot\neasier to get used to than a fiftieth.\" Then he looked quickly at the\nothers and said, \"Now, gentlemen, how can Lloyd's of London help you?\"\n\nHe had phrased it that way on purpose, deliberately making it awkward\nfor them to bring up the subject they had on their minds.\n\nIt was Nguma who broke the short silence. \"Quite simply, Mr. Martin, we\nhave come to put our case before you in person. It is not Lloyd's we\nwant--it is you.\"\n\n\"You refer to our correspondence on the Nipe case, Mr. Nguma?\"\n\n\"Exactly. We feel--\"\n\nThe man behind the desk interrupted him. \"Mr. Nguma, do you have any\nfurther information?\" He looked as though such news would be welcome but\nthat it would not change his mind in the least.\n\n\"That's just it, Mr. Martin,\" said Nguma, \"we don't know whether our\nlittle bits and dribbles of information are worth anything.\"\n\nThe man behind the desk leaned back in his chair again. \"I see,\" he said\nsoftly. \"Well, just what is it you want of me, Mr. Nguma?\"\n\nNguma looked surprised. \"Why, just what I've written, sir! You are\nacknowledged as the greatest detective in the Solar System--bar none. We\nneed you, Mr. Martin! _Earth_ needs you! That inhuman monster has been\nkilling and robbing for ten years! Men, women, and children have been\nslaughtered and eaten as though they were cattle! You've _got_ to help\nus find that God-awful thing!\"\n\nBefore there could be any answer, Arthur Gerrol leaned forward earnestly\nand said, \"Mr. Martin, we don't just represent businessmen who have been\nrobbed. We also represent hundreds and hundreds of people who have had\nfriends and relatives murdered by that horror. Little people, Mr.\nMartin. Ordinary people who are helpless against the terror of a\nsuperhuman evil. This isn't just a matter of money and goods lost--it's\na matter of _lives_ lost. Human lives, Mr. Martin.\"\n\n\"They're not the only ones who are concerned, either,\" Vandenbosch broke\nin. \"If that hellish thing isn't destroyed, more will die. Who knows how\nlong a beast like that may live? What is its life-span? Nobody knows!\"\nHe waved a hand in the air. \"For all we know, it could go on for another\ncentury--maybe more--killing, killing, killing.\"\n\nThe detective looked at them for a moment in silence. These three men\nrepresented more than just a group of businessmen who had grown uneasy\nabout the Government's ability to catch the Nipe; they represented more\nthan a few hundred or even a few thousand people who had been directly\naffected by the monster's depredations. They represented the growing\nfeeling of unrest that was making itself known all over Earth. It was\neven making itself felt out here in the Belt, although the Nipe had not,\nin the past decade, shown any desire to leave Earth. Why hadn't the\nbeast been found? Why couldn't it be killed? Why were its raids always\nso fantastically successful?\n\nFor every toothmark that inhuman thing had left on a human bone, it had\nleft a thousand on human minds--marks of a fear that was more than a\nfear. It was a deep-seated terror of the unknown.\n\nThe number of people killed in ordinary accidents in a single week was\ngreater than the total number killed by the Nipe in the last decade, but\nnowhere were men banding together to put a stop to that sort of death.\nAccidental death was a known factor, almost a friend; the Nipe was stark\nhorror.\n\nThe detective said: \"Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but what I said in my last\nletter still goes. I can't take the job. I will not go to Earth.\"\n\nEvery one of the three men could sense the determination in his voice,\nthe utter finality of his words. There was no mistaking the iron-hard\nwill of the man. They knew that nothing could shake him--nothing, at\nleast, that they could do.\n\nBut they couldn't admit defeat. No matter how futile they knew it to be,\nthey still had to try.\n\nNguma took a billfold from his jacket pocket, opened it, and took out an\nengraved sheet of paper with an embossed seal in one corner. He put it\non the desk in front of the detective.\n\n\"Would you look at that, Mr. Martin?\" he asked.\n\nThe detective picked it up and looked at it. The expression on his face\ndid not change. \"Two hundred and fifty thousand,\" he said, in a voice\nthat showed only polite interest. \"A cool quarter of a million. That's a\nlot of money, Mr. Nguma.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Nguma. \"As you can see, that sum has just been deposited\nhere, in the Belt branch of the Bank of England. It will be transferred\nto your account immediately, as soon as you agree to come to Earth to\nfind and kill the Nipe.\"\n\nThe detective looked up from his inspection of the certificate. He had\nknown that the three men had made a visit to the Bank's offices, and he\nhad been fairly sure of their purpose when he had received the\ninformation. He had not known the sum would be quite so large.\n\n\"A quarter of a million, just to take the job?\" he asked. \"And what if I\ndon't catch him?\"\n\n\"We have faith in you, Mr. Martin,\" Nguma said. \"We know your\nreputation. We know what you've done in the past. The Government police\nhaven't been able to do anything. They're completely baffled, and have\nbeen for ten years. They will continue to be so. This alien's mind is\ntoo devilishly sharp for the kind of men in Government service. We know\nthat when you take this job the finest brain in the Solar System will be\nsearching for that horror. If you can't find him ...\" He spread his\nhands in a gesture that was partly a dismissal of all hope and partly an\nappeal to the man whose services he wanted so desperately.\n\nThe detective put the certificate down on the desk top and pushed it\ntoward Nguma. \"That's very flattering, sir. Really. And I wish there\nwere some more diplomatic way of saying no--but that's all I can say.\"\n\n\"There will be a like sum deposited to your account as soon as you\neither kill or capture the Nipe, or, discovering his hideout, enable the\nGovernment officials to kill or capture him,\" said Nguma.\n\n\"That's half a million in all,\" Gerrol put in. \"We've worked hard to\nraise that money, Mr. Martin. It should be enough.\"\n\nThe detective kept his temper under icy control, allowing just enough of\nhis anger to show to make his point. \"Mr. Gerrol ... it is not a\nquestion of money. Your offer is more than generous.\"\n\n\"It's our final offer,\" Gerrol said flatly.\n\n\"I hope it is, Mr. Gerrol,\" the detective said coldly. \"I sincerely hope\nit is. For the past six months, you and your organization have been\ntrying to get me to take this job. I appreciate the sincerity of your\nefforts, believe me. And, as I said, I am honored and flattered that you\nshould think so highly of me. On the other hand, your method of going\nabout it is hardly flattering. I turned down your first offer of twenty\nthousand six months ago. Since then, you have been going up and up and\nup until you have finally reached twenty-five times the original\namount. You seem to think I have been holding out for more money. I have\nattempted to disabuse you of that notion, but you would not read what I\nput down in my communications, evidently. If I had wanted more money\nthan you offered at first, I would have said so. I would have quoted you\na price. I did not. I gave you an unqualified refusal. I give it to you\nstill. _No._ Flatly, absolutely, and finally ... _no_.\"\n\nNguma was the only one of the three who could find his tongue\nimmediately. \"I should think,\" he said somewhat acidly, \"that you would\nconsider it your duty to--\"\n\nThe detective cut him off. \"My duty, Mr. Nguma, is, at this moment, to\nmy employers. I am a paid investigator for Lloyd's of London, Belt\nbranch. I draw a salary that is more than adequate for my needs and\nalmost adequate for my taste in the little luxuries of life. I am, for\nthe time being at least, satisfied with my work. So are my employers.\nUntil one or the other of us becomes dissatisfied, the situation will\nremain as it is. I will not accept any outside work of any kind except\nat the instructions of, or with the permission of, my employers. I have\nneither. I want neither at this time. That is all, gentlemen. Good day.\"\n\n\"But the money ...\" Nguma said.\n\n\"The money should be withdrawn from the bank and returned to Earth. I\nsuggest you return it to the people who have donated it to your\norganization. If that is impossible, I suggest you donate it to the\nGovernment officials who are working so hard to do the job you want\ndone. I assure you, they are much more capable than I of dealing with\nthe Nipe. Good day, Mr. Nguma, Mr. Vandenbosch, Mr. Gerrol.\"\n\nThey looked hurt, bewildered, and angry. Only Mr. Barnabas Nguma looked\nas if he might have some slight understanding of what had happened. He\nwas the only one who spoke. \"Good day, Mr. Martin. I am sorry we have\ndisturbed you. Thank you for your valuable time,\" he said with dignity.\nAnd then the three men walked out the door, closing it behind them.\n\nThe detective sat behind his desk, looking at the door, almost as if he\ncould see the men beyond it as they moved down the corridor. Several\nminutes later, when his secretary opened the door again, he was still\nstaring thoughtfully at it. She thought he was staring at her.\n\n\"Something the matter, Mr. Martin?\" she asked.\n\n\"What? Oh. No, no. Nothing, Helen; nothing. Just wool-gathering. Did you\nsee our visitors out all right?\"\n\nShe glided in and closed the door behind her. \"Well, none of them fell\nand broke a leg, if that's what you mean. But that Mr. Gerrol looked as\nthough he might break a blood vessel. I take it you turned them down\nagain?\"\n\n\"Yes. For the last time, I think. It's a shame they had to travel out\nhere, all that distance, to be turned down. They looked on me as their\ngreat white hope. They couldn't really believe I would turn them down.\nCouldn't let themselves believe it, I guess. They're scared,\nHelen--bright green scared.\"\n\n\"I know. But if it weren't for the fact that I have certain pretensions\nto being a lady, I would have booted that Gerrol into orbit without a\nspacesuit.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"He implied,\" Helen said angrily, \"that you were a coward. That you were\nafraid to face the Nipe.\"\n\nThe detective chuckled. \"I hope you didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"I wanted to,\" she admitted. \"I wanted to tell him that guns were easy\nto buy, that all he had to do was buy one and go after the Nipe himself.\nI would like to have seen his face if I'd asked him how scared _he_ was\nof the beast. But I didn't say a word. They weren't talking to me,\nanyway; they were talking to each other.\"\n\n\"I'd almost be willing to bet that Nguma disagreed with Gerrol. Nguma\ndidn't think I was a physical coward; he thought I was a moral coward.\"\n\n\"How'd you know?\"\n\n\"Intuition. Just from the way he talked and acted. He felt the failure\nmore than the others because he felt that there was no hope left at all.\nHe was quite certain that I, myself, did not believe the Nipe could be\ncaught--by me or anyone else. He thinks that I turned down the job\nbecause I know I'd fail and I don't want to have a failure on my record.\nNot _that_ big a failure.\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous, of course,\" the girl said angrily.\n\nThe detective noticed a faint note in her voice. _She thinks the same as\nNguma_, he thought, _but she doesn't want to admit it to herself_. He\nmassaged his closed eyes with the tips of his fingers. _Maybe she's\nright_, he thought. _Maybe they're both right._ Aloud, he said, \"Well,\nwe've had our little diversion. Let's get back to work.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. You want the BenChaim file again?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've got to figure that tricky line down to a T, or we may never\nsee that boy again. We haven't much time, either--two weeks at most.\"\n\nShe went over to the file cabinet and took out several heavy folders.\n\"Imagine,\" she said, almost to herself, \"imagine them trying to get you\naway from here when you have a kidnap case to solve. They must be out of\ntheir minds.\"\n\n_There was no kidnap case six months ago_, the detective thought. _She\nknows that's not the reason. She's only trying to convince herself. Why\ndid I turn them down?_\n\nHis mind veered away from the dangerous subject, and for a moment his\nmental processes refused to focus on anything at all.\n\nThe girl put the files down on his desk.\n\n\"Thanks, Helen. Now, let's see ...\" _I'll work on this_, he thought. _I\nwon't even think about the other at all._\n\n\n\n\n_[9]_\n\n\nColonel Walther Mannheim tapped with one thick finger the map that\nglowed on the wall before him. \"That's his nest,\" he said firmly. \"Right\nthere, where those tunnels come together.\"\n\nBart Stanton looked at the map of Manhattan Island and at the gleaming\ncolored traceries that threaded their various ways across it. \"Just what\nwas the purpose of all those tunnels?\" he asked.\n\n\"The majority of them were for rail transportation,\" said the colonel.\n\"The island was hit by a sun bomb during the Holocaust and was almost\ncompletely leveled and slagged down. When the city was completely\nrebuilt afterwards, there was naturally no need for such things, so they\nwere simply all sealed off and forgotten.\"\n\n\"He's hiding directly under Government City,\" Stanton said.\n\"Incredible.\"\n\n\"It used to be one of the largest seaports in the world,\" Colonel\nMannheim said, \"and it very probably still would be if the inertia drive\nhadn't made air travel cheaper and easier than seagoing.\"\n\n\"How did he find out about those tunnels?\" Stanton asked.\n\nThe colonel pointed at the north end of the island. \"After the\nHolocaust, the first returnees to the island were wild animals which\ncrossed over from the mainland to the north. The Harlem River isn't very\nwide at this point, as you can see. There was a bridge right at about\nthis point here--the very tip of the island. It had collapsed into the\nwater, but there was enough of it to allow animals to cross. Because of\nthe rocky hills at this end of the island, there were places which were\nspared the direct effects of the bomb, and grasses and trees began\ngrowing there. That's why it was decided that section should be left as\na game preserve when the Government built the capital on the southern\npart of the island.\" His finger moved down the map. \"The upper three\nmiles of the island, down to here, where it begins to widen, are all\ngame preserve. There's a high wall at this point which separates it from\nthe city, which keeps the animals penned in, and the ruins of the\nbridges which connected with the mainland have been removed, so animals\ncan't get across any more.\n\n\"Two years after he arrived, the Nipe was almost caught. He had managed\nto get here from Asia by stealing a flyer in Leningrad. According to Dr.\nYoritomo and the other psychologists who have been studying the Nipe, he\napparently does not believe that human beings are anything more than\ntrained animals. He was looking then--as he is apparently still\nlooking--for the 'real' rulers of Earth. He expected to find them, of\ncourse, in Government City. Needless to say,\" said the colonel with a\ntouch of irony, \"he failed.\"\n\n\"But he was seen?\" asked Stanton.\n\n\"He was seen. And pursued. But he got away easily, heading north. The\nwhole island was searched, from the southern tip to the wall, and the\npolice were ready to start an inch-by-inch combing of the game preserve\nby the end of the third day after he was seen. But he hit and robbed a\nchemical supply house in northern Pennsylvania, killing two men, so the\nsearch was called off.\n\n\"It wasn't until two years later, after an exhaustive analysis of the\npattern of his raids had given us enough material to work with, that we\ndetermined that he must have found an opening into one of the tunnels up\nhere in the game preserve.\" He gestured again at the map. \"Very likely\nhe immediately saw that no human being had been down there in a long\ntime and that there wasn't much chance of a man coming down there in the\nforeseeable future. It was a perfect place for his base.\"\n\n\"How does he move in and out?\" Stanton asked.\n\n\"This way.\" The colonel traced a finger down one of the red lines on the\nmap, southward, until he came to a spot only a little over two miles\nfrom the southernmost tip of the island. The line turned abruptly toward\nthe western shore of the island, where it stopped. \"There are tunnels\nthat go underneath the Hudson River at this point and emerge on the\nother side, over here, in New Jersey. The one he uses is only one of\nseveral, but it has one distinct advantage that the others do not. All\nof them are flooded now; the sun bomb caved them in when the primary\nshock wave hit the surface of the water. The tunnel he uses has a hole\nin it big enough for him to swim through.\n\n\"In spite of his high rate of metabolism, the Nipe can store a\ntremendous amount of oxygen in his body and can stay underwater for as\nlong as half an hour without breathing apparatus, if he conserves his\nenergy. When he's wearing his scuba mask, he's practically a\nself-contained submarine. The pressure doesn't seem to bother him much.\nHe's a tough cookie.\"\n\n\"I'll remember that,\" said Stanton somberly. \"I won't try to race him\nunderwater.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Colonel Mannheim. \"No, I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"\n\nThey both knew that there was a great deal more to it than that. In\nspite of the near miracle that the staff of the Neurophysical Institute\nhad wrought upon Stanton's nerves and muscles and glands, they could\nonly go so far. They could only improve the functioning of the equipment\nthat Stanton already had; they could not add more.\n\nHis lungs could be, and had been, increased tremendously in efficiency\nof operation, but the amount of air they could actually hold could only\nbe increased slightly. There was no way to add much extra volume to them\nwithout doing so at the expense of other organs. In a breath-holding\ncontest, the Nipe would win easily, since his body had evolved organs\nfor oxygen storage, while the human body had not.\n\nYou cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear if you are limited to\nthe structures and compounds found in sows' ears. The best you can do is\nmake a finer, stronger, more sensitive sow's ear.\n\n\"I understand that the Nipe has his hideout pretty well bugged with all\nkinds of alarms,\" Stanton said. \"How did you get your own bugs in there\nwithout setting off his?\"\n\n\"Well, at first we didn't know for sure what he was up to; we weren't\neven sure he was actually down in those tunnels. But we suspected that\nif he was he'd have alarms set all over the place--perhaps even alarms\nof types we couldn't recognize. But we had to take that chance. We _had_\nto watch him.\"\n\nHe walked over to the nearby table and opened a box some twelve inches\nlong and five-by-five inches in cross-section.\n\n\"See this?\" he said, as he took a furry object from the box.\n\nIt looked like a large rat. Dead, stiff, unmoving.\n\n\"Our spy,\" said Colonel Mannheim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rat moved along the rusted steel rail that ran the length of the\nhuge tunnel. To a human being, the tunnel would have seemed to be in\nutter darkness, but the little eyes of the rat saw the surroundings as\nfaintly luminescent, glowing from the infra-red radiations given out by\nthe internal warmth of the cement and steel. The main source of the\nradiations was from above, where the heat of the sun and the warmth from\nthe energy sources in the buildings on the surface seeped through the\nroof of the tunnel. But here and there were even brighter spots of\nwarmth, spots that moved about on glowing feet and sniffed blindly at\nthe air with tiny glowing noses. Rats.\n\nOn and on moved the rat, its little pinkish feet pattering almost\nsilently on the oxidized metal surface of the rails. Its sensitive ears\npicked up the movements and the squeals of other rats, but it paid them\nno heed. Several times it met other rats on the rail, but most of them\nsensed the alienness of _this_ rat and scuttled out of its way.\n\nOnce, it met a rat who did not give way. Hungry, perhaps, or perhaps\nmerely yielding to the paranoid fury that was a normal component of the\nrattish mind, it squealed its defiance to the rat that was not a rat. It\nadvanced, baring its rodent teeth in a yellow-daggered snarl of hate.\n\nThe rat that was not a rat became suddenly motionless, its sharp little\nnose pointed directly at the oncoming enemy. There came a noise, a tiny\npopping hiss, like that of a very small drop of water striking hot\nmetal. From the left nostril of the not-rat, a tiny, glasslike needle\nsnapped out at bullet speed. It struck the advancing rat in the center\nof the pink tongue that was visible in the open mouth. Then the not-rat\nscuttled backward faster than any real rat could have moved.\n\nFor a second the real rat hesitated, and it may be that the realization\npenetrated into its dim brain that rats did not fight this way. Then, as\nthe tiny needle dissolved in its bloodstream, it closed its eyes and\ncollapsed, rolling limply off the rail to the rotted wooden tie\nbeneath.\n\nThe rat might come to before it was found and devoured by its\nfellows--or it might not. The not-rat moved on, not caring either way.\nThe human intelligence that looked out from the eyes of the not-rat was\nonly concerned with getting to the Nipe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's how we found the Nipe,\" Colonel Mannheim said, \"and that's how\nwe keep tabs on him now. We have over seven hundred of these\nremote-control robots hidden in strategic spots throughout those tunnels\nnow, and we can put more in whenever we want, but it took time to get\neverything set up this way. Now we can follow the Nipe wherever he goes,\nso long as he stays in those tunnels. If he went out through the one\nopen-air exit up in the northern part of the island, we could have him\nfollowed by bird-robots. But\"--he shrugged wryly--\"I'm afraid the\nunderwater problem still has us stumped. We can't get the carrier wave\nfor the remote-control impulses to go very far underwater.\"\n\n\"How do you get your carrier wave underground to those tunnels?\" Stanton\nasked. \"And how do you keep the Nipe from picking up the radiation?\"\n\nThe colonel grinned widely. \"One of the boys dreamed up a real cute\ngimmick. Those old steel rails themselves act as antennas for the\nbroadcaster, and the rat's tail is the pickup antenna. As long as the\nrat is crawling right on the rail, only a microscopic amount of power is\nneeded for control, not enough for the Nipe to pick up with his\ninstruments. Each rat carries its own battery for motive power, and\nthere are old copper power cables down there that we can send direct\ncurrent through to recharge the batteries. And, when we need them, the\ncopper cables can be used as antennas. It took us quite a while to work\nthe system out, but it's running smoothly now.\"\n\nStanton rubbed his head thoughtfully. _Damn these gaps in my memory!_ he\nthought. It was sometimes embarrassing to ask questions that any\nschoolboy should know the answers to.\n\n\"Aren't there ways of detecting objects underwater?\" he asked after a\nmoment.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the colonel, \"several of them. But they all require beamed\nenergy of some kind to be reflected from the object we want to look at,\nand we don't dare use anything like that.\" He sat down on one corner of\nthe table, his bright blue eyes looking up at Stanton.\n\n\"That's been our big problem all along,\" he said seriously. \"We have to\nkeep the Nipe from knowing he's being watched. In the tunnels\nthemselves, we've only used equipment that was already there, adding\nonly what we absolutely had to--small things. A few strands of wire, a\ntiny relay, things that can be hidden in out-of-the-way places and can\nbe made to look as though they were a part of the original old\nequipment. After all, he has his own alarm system in that maze of\ntunnels, and we have deliberately kept away from his detecting devices.\nHe knows about the rats and ignores them. They're part of the\nenvironment. But we don't dare use anything that would tip him off to\nour knowledge of his whereabouts. One slip like that, and hundreds of\nhuman beings will have died in vain.\"\n\n\"And if he stays down there too long,\" Stanton said levelly, \"millions\nmore may die.\"\n\nThe colonel's face was grim as he looked directly into Stanton's eyes.\n\"That's why you have to know your job down to the most minute detail\nwhen the time comes to act. The whole success of the plan will depend on\nyou and you alone.\"\n\nStanton's eyes didn't avoid the colonel's. _That's not true_, he\nthought, _I'll be only one man on a team. And you know that, Colonel\nMannheim. But you'd like to shove all the responsibility off onto\nsomeone else--someone stronger. You've finally met someone that you\nconsider your superior in that way, and you want to unload. I wish I\nfelt as confident as you do ... but I don't._\n\nAloud, he said: \"Sure. Nothing to it. All I have to do is take into\naccount everything that's known about the Nipe and make allowances for\neverything that's not known.\" Then he smiled. \"Not,\" he added, \"that I\ncan think of any other way to go about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n_THIRD INTERLUDE_\n\n\nMrs. Frobisher touched the control button that depolarized the window in\nthe breakfast room, letting the morning sun stream in through the now\ntransparent sheet of glass. Her attention was caught by something across\nthe street, and she said, in a low voice, \"Larry, come here.\"\n\nLarry Frobisher looked up from his morning coffee. \"What is it, hon?\"\n\n\"The Stanton boys. Come look.\"\n\nFrobisher sighed. \"Who are the Stanton boys, and why should I come\nlook?\" But he got up and came over to the window.\n\n\"See--over there on the walkway toward the play area,\" his wife said.\n\n\"I see a boy pushing a wheeled contraption and three girls playing with\na skip rope,\" Frobisher said. \"Or do you mean that the Stanford boys are\ndressed up as girls?\"\n\n\"_Stanton_,\" she corrected him. \"They just moved into the apartment on\nthe first floor.\"\n\n\"Who? The three girls?\"\n\n\"No, silly! The two Stanton boys and their mother. One of them is in\nthat 'wheeled contraption'. It's called a therapeutic chair.\"\n\n\"Oh? So the poor kid's been hurt. What's so interesting about that,\naside from morbid curiosity?\"\n\nThe boy pushing the chair went around a bend in the walkway, out of\nsight, and Frobisher went back to his coffee while his wife spoke.\n\n\"Their names are Mart and Bart,\" she said. \"They're twins.\"\n\n\"I should think,\" Frobisher said, applying himself to his breakfast,\n\"that the mother would get a self-powered chair for the boy instead of\nmaking the other boy push it.\"\n\n\"The poor boy can't control the chair, dear,\" said Mrs. Frobisher, still\nlooking out the window after the vanished twins. \"There's something\nwrong with his nervous system. I understand that he was exposed to some\nkind of radiation when he was only two years old. That's why the chair\nhas to have all those funny instruments built into it. Even his\nheartbeat has to be controlled electronically.\"\n\n\"Shame,\" said Frobisher, spearing a bit of sausage. \"Kind of rough on\nboth of 'em, I'd guess.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, dear?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean, like ... well, for instance, why are they going over to\nthe play area? Play games, right? So the one that's well has got to push\nhis brother over there. Can't just get out and go; has to take the\nbrother along, too. Kind of a burden, see?\"\n\nMrs. Frobisher turned away from the window. \"Why, Larry! I'm surprised\nat you. Really! Don't you think the boy _should_ take care of his\nbrother?\"\n\n\"Oh, now, honey, I didn't mean that. It's hard on _both_ of 'em. The kid\nin the chair has to sit there and watch his brother play baseball or\njai alai or whatever, while he can't do anything himself. Like I say,\nkind of rough on both of 'em.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I suppose it must be. Want some more coffee?\"\n\n\"Thanks, honey. And another slice of toast, hunh?\"\n\n\n\n\n_[10]_\n\n\nLike some horrendous, watchful gargoyle, the Nipe crouched motionlessly\non the shadowed roof of the low building. A short projection from the\nair-conditioning intake was wide enough to keep him from being seen from\nthe air, and the darkness of the roof prevented anyone on the street\nfrom seeing the four violet eyes that kept a careful account of all that\nwent on in the store across the way from his observation post.\n\nThe lights were still on inside the shop, shedding their glareless\nbrightness through the transparent display windows to fall upon the\nstreet outside in large luminous pools. The Nipe knew exactly what each\nman remaining inside was doing, and approximately what each would be\ndoing for the next few minutes, and he watched with the expectation that\nhis prophecies would be fulfilled.\n\nHe had watched long and made a thorough study of this establishment, and\ntonight he expected to attain the goal for which he had worked so\npatiently.\n\nThis raid was important in two ways. There were pieces of equipment he\nhad to get, and they were in that shop. On the other hand, this raid\nwas, and would be, basically a diversionary tactic. Now that he had\nlocated his real target, it was time to create a diversion that would\ndraw his enemy's attention away from his immediate surroundings. This\nwould be a raid that Colonel Walther Mannheim could not ignore!\n\nTwo men came out the front door. They spoke to someone still inside. \"So\nlong.\" \"See you tomorrow.\" Then they walked down the street together,\nconversing in low tones.\n\nThe Nipe waited.\n\nNot until a fifth man stopped after he opened the door and flipped a\nswitch on the inside did the Nipe make any motion. Then he flexed his\nfour pairs of limbs in anticipation--but it wasn't quite time to act\nyet.\n\nThe interior lights of the shop went out. Then the man carefully locked\nthe front door, setting the alarms within the shop. Then, serene in the\nbelief that his establishment was thoroughly protected from burglars,\nhe, too, went down the street.\n\nThe Nipe waited a few minutes longer before he left his observation\npost. All was normal, he decided. The time for action had come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Nipe moved cautiously along the alley toward the rear of the\nbuilding that was his target. The night watchman had returned to his\ncubicle, as he always did after his preliminary inspection of the\nbuilding's alarm system. He would not leave for some time yet, if he\nfollowed his habits. And the Nipe saw no reason why he should not.\n\nCarefully he approached the rear door of the little optical shop.\n\n\n\n\n_[11]_\n\n\nThe two massive objects floating in space looked very much like deeply\npitted pieces of rock. The larger one, roughly pear-shaped and about a\nquarter of a mile in its greatest dimension, was actually that--a huge\nhunk of rock. The smaller--_much_ smaller--of the two was not what it\nappeared to be. It was a phony. Anyone who had been able to conduct a\nvery close personal inspection of it would have recognized it for what\nit was--a camouflaged spaceboat.\n\nThe camouflaged spaceboat was on a near-collision course with reference\nto the larger mass, although their relative velocities were not great.\n\nAt precisely the right time, the smaller drifted by the larger, only a\nfew hundred yards away. The weakness of the gravitational fields\ngenerated between the two caused only a slight change of orbit on the\npart of both bodies. Then they began to separate.\n\nBut, during the few seconds of their closest approach, a third body\ndetached itself from the camouflaged spaceboat and shot rapidly across\nthe intervening distance to land on the surface of the floating\nmountain.\n\nThe third body was a man in a spacesuit. As soon as he landed, he sat\ndown, stock-still, and checked the instrument case he held in his hands.\n\nNo response. Thus far, then, he had succeeded.\n\nHe had had to pick his time precisely. The people who were already on\nthis small planetoid could not use their detection equipment while the\nplanetoid itself was within detection range of Beacon 971, only two\nhundred and eighty miles away. Not if they wanted to keep from being\nfound. Radar pulses emanating from a presumably lifeless planetoid would\nbe a dead giveaway.\n\nOther than that, they were mathematically safe. Mathematically safe they\nwould be if--and only if--they depended upon the laws of chance. No ship\nmoving through the Asteroid Belt would dare to move at any decent\nvelocity without using radar, so the people on this particular lump of\nplanetary flotsam would be able to spot a ship's approach easily, long\nbefore their own weak detection system would register on the pickups of\nan approaching ship.\n\nThe power and range needed by a given detector depends on the relative\nvelocity--the greater that velocity becomes, the more power, the greater\nrange needed. At one mile per second, a ship needs a range of only\nthirty miles to spot an obstacle thirty seconds away; at ten miles per\nsecond, it needs a range of three hundred miles.\n\nThe man who called himself Stanley Martin had carefully plotted the\norbit of this particular planetoid and had let his spaceboat coast in\nwithout using any detection equipment except the visual. It had been\nnecessary, but very risky.\n\nThe Asteroid Belt, that magnificently useful collection of stone and\nmetal lumps revolving about the sun between the orbits of Mars and\nJupiter, is somewhat like the old-fashioned merry-go-round. If every\norbit in the Belt were perfectly circular, the analogy would be more\nexact. If they were, then every rock in the Belt would follow every\nother in almost exactly the way every merry-go-round horse follows every\nother. (The gravitational attraction between the various bodies in the\nBelt can be neglected. It is much less, on the average, than the\ngravitational pull between any two horses on a carousel.) If every orbit\nof those millions upon millions of pieces of rock and metal were\nprecisely circular, then they would constitute the grandest, biggest\nmerry-go-round in the universe.\n\nBut those orbits are not circular. And even if they were, they would not\nremain so long. The great mass of Jupiter would soon pull them out of\nsuch perfect orbits and force them to travel about the sun in elliptical\npaths. And therein lies the trouble.\n\nIf their paths were exactly circular, then no two of that vast number of\nplanetoids would ever collide. They would march about the sun in precise\norder, like the soldiers in a military parade, except that they would\nretain their spacing much longer than any group of soldiers could\npossibly manage to do.\n\nBut the orbits are elliptical. There is a chance that any two given\nbodies _might_ collide, although the chance is small. The one\ncompensation is that if they do collide they won't strike each other\nvery hard.\n\nThe detective was not worried about collision; he was worried about\nobservation. Had the people here seen his boat? If so, had they\nrecognized it in spite of the heavy camouflage? And, even if they only\nsuspected, what would be their reaction?\n\nHe waited.\n\nIt takes nerve and patience to wait for thirteen solid hours without\nmaking any motion other than an occasional flexing of muscles, but he\nmanaged that long before the instrument case that he held waggled a\nmeter needle at him. The one tension-relieving factor was the low\ngravity; the problem of sleeping on a bed of nails is caused by the\nlikelihood of the sleeper accidentally throwing himself off the bed. The\nprobability of puncture or discomfort from the points is almost\nnegligible.\n\nWhen the needle on the instrument panel flickered, he got to his feet\nand began moving. He was almost certain that he had not been detected.\n\nWalking was out of the question. This was a silicate-alumina rock, not a\nnickel-iron one. The group of people that occupied it had deliberately\nchosen it that way, so that there would be no chance of its being picked\nout for slicing by one of the mining teams in the Asteroid Belt.\nGranted, the chance of any given metallic planetoid's being selected was\nvery small--but they had not wanted to take even that chance.\n\nTherefore, without any magnetic field to hold him down, and with only a\nvery tiny gravitic field, the detective had to use different tactics.\n\nIt was more like mountain climbing than anything else, except that there\nwas no danger of falling. He crawled over the surface in the same way\nthat an Alpine climber might crawl up the side of a steep slope--seeking\nhandholds and toeholds and using them to propel himself onward. The only\ndifference was that he covered distance a great deal more rapidly than a\nmountain climber could.\n\nWhen he reached the spot he wanted, he carefully concealed himself\nbeneath a craggy overhang. It took a little searching to find exactly\nthe right spot, but when he did, he settled himself into place in a\nsmall pit and began more elaborate preparations.\n\nSelf-hypnosis required nearly ten minutes. The first five or six minutes\nwere taken up in relaxing from his exertions. Gravity notwithstanding,\nhe had had to push his hundred and eighty pounds over a considerable\ndistance. When he was completely relaxed and completely hypnotized, he\nreached up and cut down the valve that fed oxygen into his suit.\n\nThen--of his own will--he went cataleptic.\n\nA single note, sounded by the instruments in the case at his side, woke\nhim instantly. He came fully awake, as he had commanded himself to do.\n\nImmediately he turned up his oxygen intake, at the same time glancing at\nthe clock dial in his helmet. He smiled. Nineteen days and seven hours.\nHe had calculated it almost precisely.\n\nHe wasn't more than an hour off, which was really pretty good, all\nthings considered.\n\nHe consulted his instruments again. The supply ship was ten minutes\naway. The smile stayed on his face as he prepared for further action.\n\nThe first two minutes were conscientiously spent in inhaling oxygen.\nEven under the best cataleptic conditions, the human body tended to slow\ndown too much. He had to get himself prepared for violent movement.\n\nEight minutes left.\n\nHe climbed out of the little grotto where he had concealed himself and\nmoved toward the spot where he knew the airlock to the caverns\nunderneath the planetoid's surface was hidden.\n\nThen again he concealed himself and waited, while he continued to\nbreathe deeply of the highly oxygenated air in his suit. Five minutes\nbefore the ship landed, he swallowed eight ounces of the nutrient\nsolution from the tank in the back of his helmet. The solution of amino\nacids, vitamins, and honey sugar also contained a small amount of\nstimulant of the dexedrine type and one percent ethanol.\n\nHe waited for another minute for the solution to take effect, then he\nunholstered his gun.\n\nThe supply ship wasn't a big one. He had known it wouldn't be. It was\nonly a little larger than the one he had used to come out here. It\ndropped down to the surface of the small planetoid only ten meters from\nthe hidden trapdoor that led to the airlock beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly he could hear voices in the earphones of his helmet.\n\n_Lasser?_\n\n_Yeah. It's me, Fritz. I got all the supplies and a nice package of good\nnews._\n\nThe airlock trapdoor opened, and a spacesuited figure came out. _How\nabout the deal?_\n\n_That's the good news_, said the second suited figure as it came from\nthe airlock of the grounded spaceboat. _Another five million._\n\nThe detective, hidden behind the nearby crag of rock, listened and\nwatched for a minute or so while the two men began unloading cases of\nfoodstuffs from the spaceboat. Then, satisfied that it was perfectly\nsafe, he aimed his gun and shot twice in rapid succession.\n\nThe range was almost point-blank, and there was, of course, no need to\ntake either gravity or air resistance into account.\n\nThe pellets of the shotgun-like charge that blasted out from the gun\nwere small, needle-shaped, and massive. They were oriented point-forward\nby the magnetic field along the barrel of the weapon. Of the hundreds of\ncharges fired, only a few penetrated the spacesuits of the targets, but\nthose few were enough. The powerful drug in the needle-pointed head of\neach tiny crystal went directly into the bloodstream of each target.\n\nEach man felt an itching sensation. He had less than two seconds to\nthink about it before unconsciousness overtook him and he slumped\nnervelessly.\n\nGun in hand, the detective ran across the intervening space quickly, his\nbody only a few degrees from the horizontal, and his toes paddling\nrapidly to propel him over the rough rock.\n\nHe braked himself to a halt and slapped air patches over the areas where\nhis charges had struck the men's suits, sealing the tiny air leaks, and,\nat the same time, driving more of the tiny needles into their skins.\nThey would be out for a long time.\n\nNeither of them had yet fallen to the ground. That would take several\nminutes under this low gravity. He left them to drop and headed toward\nthe open airlock.\n\nThis was what he had been waiting for all those nineteen days in\ncataleptic hypnosis. He couldn't have cut his way into the hideout from\nthe outside; he had had to wait until it was opened, and that time had\ncome only with the supply ship.\n\nOnce in the airlock, he touched the control stud that would close the\nouter door, pump air into the waiting room, and open the inner door.\nHere was his greatest point of danger--greater, even, than the danger of\ncoming to the planetoid itself, or the danger of waiting nineteen days\nin a cataleptic trance for the coming of the supply ship. If the ones\nwho remained within suspected anything--anything at all!--then his\nchances of coming out of this alive were practically nil.\n\nBut there was no reason why they should suspect. They should think that\nthe man coming in was one of their own. The radio contact between the\nmen outside had been limited to a few micromilliwatts of\npower--necessarily, since radio waves of very small wattage can be\ndecoded at tremendous distances in open space. The men inside the\nplanetoid certainly should not have been able to pick up any more than\nthe beginning of the early conversation before it had been cut\ncompletely off by the intervening layers of solid rock.\n\nThe chamber he entered was a high-speed airlock. Unlike the soundless\ndischarge of his special gun in the outer airlessness, the blast of air\nthat came into the waiting chamber was like a hurricane in noise and\nforce. The room filled with air in a very few seconds.\n\nThe detective held on to the handholds tightly while the brief but\nviolent winds buffeted him. He turned as the inner door opened.\n\nHis eyes took in the picture in a fraction of a second. In an even\nsmaller fraction, his mind assimilated the picture.\n\nThe woman was dark-haired, dark-eyed, and muscular. Her mouth was wide\nand thick-lipped beneath a large nose.\n\nThe man was leaner and lighter, bony-faced, and beady-eyed.\n\nThe woman said: \"Fritz, what--?\"\n\nAnd then he shot them both with gun number two.\n\nNo needle charges this time. Such shots would have blown them both in\ntwo, unprotected as they were by spacesuits. The small handgun merely\njangled their nerves with a high-powered blast of accurately beamed\nsupersonics. While they were still twitching, he went over and jabbed\nthem with a drug needle.\n\nThen he went on into the hideout.\n\nHe had to knock out one more man, whom he found asleep in a small room\noff the short corridor.\n\nIt took a gas bomb to get the two women who were guarding the kid.\n\nHe made sure that the BenChaim boy was all right, then he went to the\nlittle communications room and called for help.\n\n\n\n\n_[12]_\n\n\nSt. Louis hadn't been hit during the Holocaust. It still retained much\nof the old-fashioned flavor of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,\nespecially in the residential districts. The old homes, some of them\ndating clear back to the time of Sam Clemens and the paddle-wheel\nsteamboat, still stood, warm and well preserved.\n\nBart Stanton liked to walk along those quiet streets of an evening, just\nto let the placid peacefulness seep into him.\n\nAnd, knowing it was rather childish, he still enjoyed the small\nHuckleberry Finn pleasure of playing hooky from the Neurophysical\nInstitute.\n\nTechnically, he supposed, he was still a patient there. More, now that\nhe had completely accepted Colonel Walther Mannheim's assignment, he was\npresumably under military discipline. He assumed that if he had asked\npermission to leave the Institute's grounds he would have been given\nthat permission without question.\n\nBut, like playing hooky or stealing watermelon, it was more fun if it\nwas done on the sly. The boy who comes home feeling deliciously wicked\nand delightfully sinful after staying away from school all day can have\nhis whole day ruined completely by being told that it was a holiday and\nthe school had been closed. Bart Stanton didn't want to spoil his own\nfun by asking for permission to leave the grounds when it was so easy\nfor a man with his special abilities to get out without asking.\n\nBesides, there _was_ a chance--a small one, he thought--that permission\nmight be refused for one reason or another, and Stanton was fully aware\nthat he would not disobey a direct request--to say nothing of a direct\norder--that he stay within the walls of the Institute.\n\nHe didn't want to run any risk of losing his freedom, small though it\nwas. After five years of mental and physical hell, he felt a need to get\nout into the world of normal, ordinary, everyday people.\n\nHis legs moved smoothly, surely, and unhurriedly, carrying him aimlessly\nalong the resilient walkway, under the warm glow of the streetlights.\nThe people around him walked as casually and with seemingly as little\npurpose as he did. There was none of the brisk sense of urgency that he\nfelt inside the walls of the Institute.\n\nBut he knew he could never get away from that sense of urgency\ncompletely, even out here. There were times when it seemed that all he\nhad ever done, all his whole life, was to train himself for the one\nsingle purpose of besting the Nipe.\n\nIf he wasn't training physically, he was listening to lectures from Dr.\nGeorge Yoritomo or from Colonel Mannheim. If he wasn't working his\nmuscles, he was laying plans and considering possibilities for the one\ngreat goal that seemed to be the focal point of his whole life.\n\nWhat would happen if he failed?\n\nWhat would happen if he, the great hyped-up superman, found that the\nNipe had only been working at half his normal potential? What would\nhappen if that alien horror simply slashed out with one ultrafast hand\nand showed Colonel Mannheim and all his watching technicians that they\nhad completely underestimated his alien ability?\n\nWhat would happen?\n\nWhy, Bart Stanton would die, of course, just as hundreds of other human\nbeings had died in the past ten years. Stanton would become another\nstatistic. And then Mannheim's Plan Beta would go into effect. The Nipe\nwould be killed eventually.\n\nBut what if he, Stanton, won? Then what?\n\nThe people around him were not a part of his world, really. Their\nthoughts, their motions, their reactions, were slow and clumsy in\ncomparison with his own. Once the Nipe had been conquered, what purpose\nwould there be in the life of Bartholomew Stanton? He was surrounded by\npeople, but he was not one of them. He was immersed in a society that\nwas not his own because it was not, could not be, geared to his\nabilities and potentials. But there was no other society to turn to,\neither.\n\nHe was not a man \"alone, afraid\" in a world he had never made. He was a\nman who had been made for a world, a society, that did not exist.\n\nWomen? A wife? A family life?\n\nWhere? With whom?\n\nHe pushed the thoughts from his mind, the questions unanswered and\nperhaps unanswerable. In spite of the apparent bleakness of the future,\nhe had no desire to die, and there was, psychologically, the possibility\nthat too much brooding of that kind would evoke a subconscious reaction\nthat could slow him down or cause a wrong decision at a vital moment. A\nfeeling of futility could operate to bring on his death in spite of his\nconscious determination to win the coming battle with the Nipe.\n\nThe Nipe was his first duty. When that job was finished, he would\nconsider the problem of himself. Just because he could not now see the\nanswer to that problem did not mean that no answer existed.\n\nHe suddenly realized that he was hungry. He had been walking through\nMemorial Park, past the museum--an old, worn edifice that was still\ncalled the Missouri Pacific Building. There was a small restaurant only\na block away.\n\nHe reached into his pocket and took out the few coins that were there.\nNot much, but enough to buy a sandwich and a glass of milk. Because of\nthe trust fund that had been set up when he had started the treatment at\nthe Neurophysical Institute, he was already well off, but he didn't have\nmuch cash. What good was cash at the Institute, where everything was\nprovided?\n\nHe stopped at a newsvendor, dropped in a coin, and waited for the\nreproducing mechanism to turn out a fresh paper. Then he took the folded\nsheets and went on to the restaurant.\n\nHe rarely read a newssheet. Mostly, his information about the world that\nexisted outside the walls of the Institute came from the televised\nnewscasts. But, occasionally, he liked to read the small, relatively\nunimportant little stories about people who had done small, relatively\nunimportant things--stories that didn't appear in the headlines or the\nnewscasts.\n\nThe last important news story that he had heard had come two nights\nbefore. The Nipe had robbed an optical products company in Miami. The\ncamera had shown the shop on the screen. Whatever had been used to blow\nopen the vault had been more effective than necessary. It had taken the\nwhole front door of the shop and both windows, too. The bent and twisted\nparaglass that had lain on the pavement showed how much force had been\napplied from within.\n\nAnd yet, the results had not been those of an explosion. It was more as\nthough some tremendous force had _pushed_ outward from within. It had\nnot been the shattering shock of high explosive, but some great thrust\nthat had unhurriedly, but irresistibly, moved everything out of its way.\n\nNothing had been moved very far, as it would have been by a blast. It\nappeared that everything had simply fallen aside, as though scattered by\na giant hand. The main braces of the storefront were still there, bent\noutward a little, but not broken.\n\nThe vault door had been slammed to the floor of the shop, only a few\nfeet from the front door. The vault itself had been farther back, and\nthe camera had showed it standing wide open, gaping. Inside, there had\nbeen pieces of fragile glass standing on the shelves, unmoved, unharmed.\n\nThe force, whatever it had been, had moved in one direction only, from a\npoint within the vault, just a few feet from the door, pushing outward\nto tear out the heavy door as though it had been made of paraffin or\nmodeling clay.\n\nStanton had recognized the vault construction type: the Voisier\nconstruction, which, by test, could withstand almost everything known,\noutside of the actual application of atomic energy itself. In a\nwidely-publicized demonstration several years before, a Voisier vault\nhad been cut open by a team of well-trained, well-equipped technicians.\nIt had taken twenty-one hours for them to breach the wall, and they had\nhad no fear of interruption, or of making a noise, or of setting off the\nintricate alarms that were built into the safe itself. Not even a\nborazon drill could make much of an impression on a metal which had been\nformed under millions of atmospheres of pressure.\n\nAnd yet the Nipe had taken that door out in a second, without much\neffort at all.\n\nThe crowd that had gathered at the scene of the crime had not been\nlarge. The very thought of the Nipe kept people away from places where\nhe was known to have been. The specter of the Nipe evoked a fear, a\nprimitive fear--fear of the dark and fear of the unknown--combined with\nthe rational fear of a very real, very tangible danger.\n\nAnd yet, there _had_ been a crowd of onlookers. In spite of their fear,\nit is hard to keep human beings from being curious. It was known that\nthe Nipe didn't stay around after he had struck, and, besides, the area\nwas now full of armed men. So the curious came to look and to stare in\nrevulsion at the neat pile of gnawed and bloody bones that had been the\nnight watchman, carefully killed and eaten by the Nipe before he had\nopened the vault.\n\n_Thus curiosity does make fools of us all, and the native hue of caution\nis crimsoned o'er by the bright red of morbid fascination._\n\nStanton went through the door of the automatic restaurant and walked\nover to the vending wall. The big dining room was only about three\nquarters full of people, and there were plenty of seats available. He\nfed coins into the proper slots, took his sandwich and milk over to a\nseat in one corner and made himself comfortable.\n\nHe flipped open the newspaper and looked at the front page.\n\nAnd, for a moment, his brain seemed to freeze.\n\nThe story itself was straightforward enough:\n\n    BENCHAIM KIDNAPPERS NABBED!\n\n    STAN MARTIN DOES IT AGAIN!\n\n    CERES, June 3 (_Interplanetary News Service_)--The three men and\n    three women who allegedly kidnapped 10-year-old Shmuel BenChaim were\n    brought to justice today through the single-handed efforts of\n    Stanley Martin, famed investigator for Lloyd's of London. The boy,\n    held prisoner for more than ten weeks on a small planetoid, was\n    reported in good health.\n\n    According to Lt. John Vale of the Planetoid Police, the kidnap gang\n    could not have been taken by direct assault on their hideout because\n    of fear that the boy might be killed.\n\n    \"The operation required a carefully planned one-man infiltration of\n    their hideout,\" Lt. Vale said. \"Mr. Martin was the man for the job.\"\n\n    Labeled \"the most outrageous kidnapping in history\", the affair was\n    conceived as a long-term method of gaining control of Heavy Metals\n    Incorporated, controlled by Moishe BenChaim, the boy's father. The\n    details ...\n\nBut Bart Stanton wasn't interested in the details. After only a glance\nthrough the first part of the article, his eyes returned to the picture\nthat had caught his attention. The line of print beneath it identified\nthe picture as being that of a man named Stanley Martin.\n\nBut a voice in Bart Stanton's brain said: _Not Stan Martin! The name is\nMart Stanton!_\n\nAnd Bartholomew felt a roar of confusion in his mind--because he didn't\nknow who Mart Stanton was, and because the face in the picture was his\nown.\n\n\n\n\n_[13]_\n\n\nHe was walking again.\n\nHe didn't quite remember how he had left the automat, and he really\ndidn't even try to remember.\n\nHe was trying to remember other things--further back--before he had ...\n\nBefore he had _what_?\n\nBefore the Institute. Before the beginning of the operations.\n\nThe memories were there, all right. He could sense them, floating in\nsome sort of mental limbo, just beyond the grasp of his conscious mind,\nlike the memories of a dream after one has awakened. Each time he would\ntry to reach into the darkness to grasp one of the pieces, it would\nshatter into smaller bits. The big patterns were too fragile to\nwithstand the direct probing of his conscious mind, and even the\nresulting fragments did not want to hold still long enough to be\nanalyzed.\n\nAnd, while a part of his mind probed frantically after the elusive\nparticles of memory, another part of it watched the process with\nsemi-detached amusement.\n\nHe had always known there were holes in his memory (_Always? Don't kid\nyourself, pal!_), but it was disconcerting to find an area that was as\nfull of holes as a used machine-gun target. The whole fabric had been\npunched to bits.\n\nNo man's memory is completely available at any given time. Whatever the\nrecording process is, however completely every bit of data may be\nrecorded during a lifetime, much of it is unavailable. It may be\nincompletely cross-indexed, or, in some instances, labeled DO NOT SCAN.\nOr, metaphorically, the file drawer may be locked. It may be that, in\nmany cases, if a given bit of data remains unscanned for a long enough\nperiod, it fades into illegibility, never reinforced by the scanning\nprocess. Sensory data, coming in from the outside world as it does, is\nprobably permanent. But the thought patterns originating within the mind\nitself, the processes that correlate and cross-index and speculate on\nand hypothesize about the sensory data, these are much more fragile. A\nman might glance once through a Latin primer and have each and every\npage imprinted indelibly on his recording mechanism and still be unable\nto make sense out of _Nauta in cubitu cum puella est_.\n\nSometimes a man is aware of the holes in his memory. (\"What _was_ the\nname of that fellow I met at Eddie's party? Can't remember it for the\nlife of me.\") At other times, a memory may lay dormant and completely\nunremembered, leaving no apparent gap, until a tag of some kind brings\nit up. (\"That girl with the long hair reminds me of Suzie Blugerhugle.\nMy gosh! I haven't thought of her in years!\") Both factors seemed to be\noperating in Bart Stanton's mind at this time.\n\nIncredibly, he had never, in the past year at least, had occasion to try\nto remember much about his past life. He had known who he was without\nthinking about it particularly, and the rest of his knowledge--language,\nhistory, social behavior, politics, geography, and so on--had been\nreadily available for the most part. Ask an educated man to give the\nproduct of the primes 2, 13, and 41, or ask him to give the date of the\nNorman Conquest, and he can give you the answers very quickly. He may\nhave to calculate the first, which will make him pause for a second\nbefore answering, but the second will come straight out of his memory\nrecords. In neither case does he have to think of where he learned the\nprocess or the fact, or who taught it to him, or when he got the\ninformation.\n\nBut now the picture and the name in the paper had brought forth a\nreaction in Stanton's mind, and he was trying desperately to bring the\ninformation out of oblivion.\n\nDid he have a mother? Surely. But could he remember her? _Yes!_\nCertainly. A pretty, gentle, rather sad woman. He could remember when\nshe died, although he couldn't remember ever having actually attended\nthe funeral.\n\nWhat about his father?\n\nTry as he might, he could find no memory whatever of his father, and, at\nfirst, that bothered him. He could remember his mother--could almost see\nher moving around in the apartment where they had lived in ... in ... in\nDenver! Sure! And he could remember the big building itself, and the\nblock, and even Mrs. Frobisher, who lived upstairs! And the school! And\nthe play area! A great many memories came crowding back, but there was\nno trace of his father.\n\nAnd yet ...\n\nOh, of _course_! That was it! His father had been killed in an accident\nwhen Martinbart were very young.\n\n_Martinbart!_\n\nThe name flitted through his mind like a scrap of paper in a high wind,\nbut mentally he reached out and grasped it.\n\nMartinbart. Martin-Bart. Mart 'n' Bart. Mart _and_ Bart.\n\nThe Stanton Twins.\n\nIt was very curious, he thought, that he should have forgotten his\nbrother. And even more curious that the name in the paper had not\nbrought him instantly to mind.\n\nMartin, the cripple. Martin, the boy with the poor, weak,\nradiation-shattered nervous system. The boy who had had to stay in a\ntherapeutic chair all his life because his efferent nerves could not\ncontrol his body. The boy who couldn't speak. Or, rather, _wouldn't_\nspeak because he was ashamed of the gibberish that resulted.\n\nMartin. The nonentity. The nothing. The nobody.\n\nThe one who watched and listened and thought, but could do nothing.\n\nBart Stanton stopped suddenly and unfolded the newspaper again under the\nglow of the streetlamp. His memories certainly didn't jibe with _this_!\n\nHis eyes ran down the column of type:\n\n    Mr. Martin has, in the years since he has been in the Belt, run up\n    an enviable record, both as an insurance investigator and as a\n    police detective, although his connection with the Planetoid Police\n    is, necessarily, an unofficial one. Probably not since Sherlock\n    Holmes has there been such mutual respect and co-operation between\n    the official police and a private investigator.\n\nThere was only one explanation, Stanton thought. Martin, too, had been\ntreated by the Institute. His memory was still blurry and incomplete, he\nknew, but he did suddenly remember that a decision had been made for\nMartin to take the treatment.\n\nHe chuckled a little at the irony of it. It looked as though they hadn't\nbeen able to make a superman of Martin, but they _had_ been able to make\na normal and extraordinarily capable human being of him, he thought. Now\nit was Bart who was the freak, the odd one.\n\n_Turn about is fair play_, he thought. But somehow it didn't seem quite\nfair.\n\nHe crumpled the newspaper, dropped it into a nearby waste chute, and\nwalked on through the night toward the Neurophysical Institute.\n\n\n\n\n_FOURTH INTERLUDE_\n\n\n\"You understand, Mrs. Stanton,\" said the psychiatrist, \"that a great\npart of Martin's trouble is mental as well as physical. Because of the\nnature of his ailment, he has withdrawn, pulled himself away from\ncommunication with others. If these symptoms had been brought to my\nattention earlier, the mental disturbance might have been more easily\nanalyzed and treated.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I'm sorry, Doctor,\" said Mrs. Stanton. Her manner\nbetrayed weariness and pain. \"It was so ... so difficult. Martin could\nnever talk very well, you know, and he just talked less and less as the\nyears went by. It was so slow and so gradual that I never really noticed\nit.\"\n\n_Poor woman_, the doctor thought. _She's not well, herself. She should\nhave married again, years ago, rather than force herself to carry the\nwhole burden alone. Her role as a doting mother hasn't helped either of\nthe boys to overcome the handicaps that were already present._\n\n\"I've honestly tried to do my very best with Martin,\" Mrs. Stanton went\non unhappily. \"And so has Bart, I know. When they were younger, Bart\nused to take him out all the time. They went everywhere together. Of\ncourse, I don't expect Bart to do that so much any more. He has his own\nlife to live. He can't take Martin out on dates or things like that. He\nhas interests outside the home now, like other boys his age. That's only\nnormal. But when he's at home, Bart helps me with Martin all the time.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the psychiatrist. _This is no time to tell her that\nBartholomew's tests indicate that he has subconsciously resented\nMartin's presence for a long time_, he thought. _She has enough to worry\nabout._\n\n\"_I_ don't understand,\" said Mrs. Stanton, breaking into sudden tears.\n\"I just don't understand why Martin should behave this way! Why should\nhe just sit there with his eyes closed and ignore everybody? Why should\nhe ignore his mother and his brother? Why?\"\n\nThe doctor comforted her in a warmly professional manner, then, as her\ntears subsided, he said, \"We don't understand all the factors ourselves,\nMrs. Stanton. At first glance, Martin's reactions appear to be those one\nwould expect of schizophrenic withdrawal. But there are certain aspects\nof the case that make it unusual. His behavior doesn't quite follow the\npattern we usually expect from such cases as this. His extreme physical\ndisability has drastically modified the course of his mental\ndevelopment, and, at the same time, made it difficult for us to make any\nanalysis of his mental state.\" _If only_, he added to himself, _she had\nfollowed the advice of her family physician, years ago. If she had only\nput the boy under the proper care, none of this would have happened._\n\n\"Is there _any_thing we can do, Doctor?\" she asked.\n\n\"We don't know yet,\" he said gently. He considered for a moment, then\nsaid: \"Mrs. Stanton, I'd like for you to leave both of the boys here\nfor a few days, so that we can perform further tests. That will help us\na great deal in evaluating the circumstances, and help us get at the\nroot of Martin's trouble.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a little surprise. \"Why, yes, of course--if you\nthink it's necessary. But ... why should Bart stay?\"\n\nThe doctor weighed his words carefully before he spoke.\n\n\"Bart will be what we call a 'control', Mrs. Stanton. Since the boys are\ngenetically identical, they should have been a great deal alike, in\npersonality as well as in body, if it hadn't been for Martin's accident.\nIn other words, our tests of Bart will tell us what Martin _should_ be\nlike. That way, we can tell just how much and in what way Martin\ndeviates from what he should ideally be. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I see. All right, Doctor--whatever you say.\"\n\nAfter Mrs. Stanton had left, the psychiatrist sat quietly in his chair\nand stared thoughtfully at his desk top for several minutes. Then,\nmaking his decision, he picked up a small book that lay on his desk and\nlooked up a number in Arlington, Virginia. He punched out the number on\nhis phone, and when the face appeared on his screen he said, \"Hello,\nSidney. Busy right now?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. Not for a few minutes. What's up?\"\n\n\"I have a very interesting case out here that I'd like to talk to you\nabout. Do you happen to have a telepath who's strong enough to take a\nmeshing with an insane mind? If my suspicions are correct, I will need a\nman with an absolutely impregnable sense of identity, because he's going\nto get into the weirdest situation I've ever come across.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[14]_\n\n\nThe Nipe squatted, brooding, in his underground nest, waiting for the\nspecial crystallization process to take place in the sodium-gold alloy\nthat was forming in the reactor.\n\n_How long?_ he wondered. He was not thinking of the complex\ncrystallization reaction; he knew the timing of that to a fraction of a\nsecond. His dark thoughts were, instead, focused inwardly, upon himself.\n\nHow long would it be before he would be able to construct the\ncommunicator that would span the light-years of intervening distance and\nput him in touch with his own race again? How long would it be before he\ncould again hold discourse with reasonable beings? How much longer would\nhe have to be stranded on this planet, surrounded by an insane society\ncomposed of degraded, insane beings?\n\nThe work was going incredibly slowly. He had known at the beginning that\nhis knowledge of the basic arts required to build a communicator was\nincomplete, but he had not realized just how painfully inadequate it\nwas. Time after time, his instruments had simply refused to function\nbecause of some basic flaw in their manufacture--some flaw that an\nexpert in that field could have pointed out at once. Time after time,\nequipment had had to be rebuilt almost from the beginning. And, time\nafter time, only cut-and-try methods were available for correcting his\nerrors.\n\nNot even his prodigious and accurate memory could hold all the\ninformation that was necessary for the work, and there were no reference\ntapes available, of course. They had all been destroyed when his ship\nhad crashed.\n\nHe had long since given up any attempt to understand the functioning of\nthe mad pseudo-civilization that surrounded him. He was quite certain\nthat the beings he had seen could not possibly be the real rulers of\nthis society, but he had no inkling, as yet, as to who the real rulers\nwere.\n\nAs to _where_ they were, that question seemed a little easier to answer.\nIt was highly probable that they were out in space, on the asteroids\nthat his instruments had detected when he was dropping in toward this\nplanet so many years before. He had made an error then in not landing in\nthe Belt, but at no time since had he experienced the emotion of regret\nor wished he had done differently; both thoughts would have been\nincomprehensible to the Nipe. He had made an error; the circumstances\nhad been checked and noted; he would not make that error again.\n\nWhat further action could be taken by a logical mind?\n\nNone. The past was immutable and unchangeable. It existed only as a\nmemory in his own mind, and there was no way to change that indelible\nrecord, even had the Nipe wished to do so insane a thing.\n\nSurely, he thought, the real rulers must know of his existence. He had\ntried, by his every action, to show that he was a reasoning,\nintelligent, and civilized being. Why, then, had they taken no action?\n\nThere was, of course, the possibility that the rulers cared very little\nfor their subjects here on Earth, that they ignored what went on most of\nthe time. Still, it would seem that they would recognize the actions of\none of their own kind and take steps to investigate.\n\nHe was still not absolutely certain about Colonel Walther Mannheim. Was\nhe a Real Person or merely an underling? The information on the man was\npitifully small. It would, of course, be possible to wait, to see how\nColonel Walther Mannheim behaved if and when he discovered the Nipe's\nnest. But if he had not discovered it after all these years--and the\ninformation indicated that he had been looking almost since the\nfirst--then it was unlikely that he was a Real Person. In which case, it\nwould be dangerous to allow him to find the nest.\n\nNo, the best plan of action would be to go to Colonel Walther Mannheim\nfirst.\n\n\n\n\n_[15]_\n\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\nThe action around the handball court was beautiful to watch. The robot\nmechanism behind Bart Stanton would fire out a ball at random intervals\nranging from a tenth to a quarter of a second, bouncing them off the\nwall in a random pattern. Stanton would retrieve the ball before it hit\nthe ground and bounce it off the wall again to strike the target on the\nmoving robot. Stanton had to work against a machine; no ordinary human\nbeing could have given him any competition.\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\n_Pok! Pok!_ PLUNK.\n\n\"One miss,\" Stanton said to himself. But he fielded the next one nicely\nand slammed it home.\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\nThe physical therapist who was standing to one side, well out of the way\nof those hard-slammed, fast-moving drives, glanced at his watch. It was\nalmost time.\n\n_Pok! Pok! Ping!_\n\nThe machine, having delivered its last ball, shut itself off with a smug\nclick. Stanton turned away from the handball court and walked toward the\nphysical therapist, who was holding out a robe for him.\n\n\"That was good, Bart,\" he said. \"Real good.\"\n\n\"One miss,\" Stanton said as he shrugged into the robe.\n\n\"Yeah. Your timing was off a shade there, I guess. It's hard for me to\ntell till I look at the slow-motion photographs. Your arms and hands are\njust blurs to me when they're moving that fast. But you managed to chop\nanother ten seconds off your previous record, anyway.\"\n\nStanton looked at him. \"You reset the timer again,\" he said accusingly.\nBut there was a grin on his face.\n\nThe P.T. man grinned back. \"Yup. Come on, step into the mummy case.\" He\nwaved toward the narrow niche in the wall of the court, a niche just big\nenough to hold a standing man. Stanton stepped in, and various\ninstrument pickups came out of the walls and touched him at various\npoints on his body. Hidden machines recorded his heartbeat, his blood\npressure, his brain activity, his muscular tension, his breathing, and\nseveral other factors.\n\nAfter a minute the P.T. man said, \"Okay, Bart, that's it. Let's hit the\nsteam box.\"\n\nStanton stepped out of the niche and accompanied the therapist to\nanother room, where he took off the robe again and sat down on the small\nstool inside an ordinary steam box. The box closed, leaving his head\nfree, and the box began to fill with steam.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you just what it is that I don't like about that\nmachine?\" Stanton asked as the therapist draped a heavy towel around his\nhead.\n\n\"Nope. Didn't know you had any gripe. What is it?\"\n\n\"You can't gloat after you beat it. You can't walk over and pat it on\nthe shoulder and say, 'Well, better luck next time, old man.' It isn't a\ngood loser, and it isn't a bad loser. The damned thing doesn't even know\nit lost, and even if it did, it wouldn't care.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I see what you mean,\" said the P.T. man, chuckling. \"You beat the\npants off it and what d'you get? Nothing. Not even a case of the sulks\nout of it.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And what's worse, I know perfectly good and well that it's\nonly half trying. The stupid gadget could beat me easily if you just\nturned that knob over a little more.\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. But you're not competing against the machine, anyway,\" the\ntherapist said. \"What you're doing, you're competing against yourself,\ntrying to beat your own record.\"\n\n\"I know. And what happens when I can't do _that_ any more, either?\"\nStanton asked. \"I can't just go on getting better and better forever.\nI've got limits, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the therapist easily. \"So does anybody. So does a golf\nplayer, for instance. You take a golf player, he goes out and practices\nby himself to try to beat his own record.\"\n\n\"Bunk! Hogwash! The real fun in _any_ game is beating someone else! The\nbig kick in golf is winning over the other guy in a twosome.\"\n\n\"How about crossword puzzles or solitaire?\"\n\n\"When you solve a crossword puzzle, you've beaten the guy who made up\nthe puzzle. When you play solitaire, you're playing against the laws of\nchance, and that can become pretty boring unless there's money on it.\nAnd, in that case, you're actually trying to beat the guy who's betting\nagainst you. What I'd like to do is get out on the golf course with\nsomeone else and do my best and then lose. Honestly.\"\n\n\"With a handicap ...\" the therapist began. Then he grinned weakly and\nstopped. On the golf course, Stanton was impossibly good. It had taken\nhim a little while to get the knack of it, but as soon as he got control\nof his club and knew the reactions of the ball, his score started\nplummeting. Now it was so low as to be almost ridiculous. One long drive\nto the green and one putt to the cup. An easy thirty-six strokes for\neighteen holes! An occasional hole-in-one sometimes brought his score\ndown below that; an occasional wormcast or stray wind sometimes brought\nit up.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Stanton. \"A handicap. What kind of a handicap do you want\nme to give you to induce you to make a fifty-dollar bet on a handball\ngame with me?\"\n\nThe physical therapist could imagine himself trying to get under one of\nStanton's lightning-like returns. The thought of what would happen to\nhis hand if he were accidentally to catch one made him wince.\n\n\"We wouldn't even be playing the same game,\" said Stanton.\n\nThe therapist stepped back and looked at Stanton. \"You know,\" he said\npuzzledly, \"you sound bitter.\"\n\n\"Sure I'm bitter,\" Stanton said. \"All I ever get is just exercise. All\nthe fun has gone out of it.\" He sighed and grinned. There was no point\nin upsetting the P.T. man. \"I guess I'll just have to stick to cards and\nchess if I want competition. Speed and strength don't help anything if\nI'm holding two pair against three of a kind.\"\n\nBefore the therapist could say anything, the door opened and a tall,\nlean man stepped into the foggy air of the room. \"You are broiling a\nlobster?\" he asked the P.T. man blandly.\n\n\"Steaming a clam,\" the therapist corrected. \"When he's done, I'll pound\nhim to chowder.\"\n\n\"Excellent. I came for a clambake.\"\n\n\"You're early, then, George,\" Stanton said. He didn't feel much in the\nmood for lightness, and the appearance of Dr. Yoritomo did nothing to\nimprove his humor.\n\nGeorge Yoritomo beamed broadly, crinkling up his narrow, heavy-lidded\neyes. \"Ah! A talking clam! Excellent! How much longer does this fine\nspecimen of clamhood have to cook?\" he asked the P.T. man.\n\n\"About twenty-three more minutes.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Dr. Yoritomo. \"Would you be so good as to return at\nthe end of that time?\"\n\nThe therapist opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again, and\nsaid: \"Sure, Doc. I can get some other stuff done. I'll see you in\ntwenty-three minutes. But don't let him out of there till I get back.\"\nHe went out through the far door.\n\nAfter the door closed, Dr. Yoritomo pulled up a chair and sat down.\n\"There have been new developments,\" he said, \"as you may have surmised.\"\n\nThe physical therapist, like many other of the personnel around the\nInstitute, knew of Stanton's abilities, but he didn't know the purpose\nof the long series of operations that had made him what he was. Such\npersons knew about Stanton himself, but they knew nothing of any\nconnection with the Nipe, although they might suspect. And all of them\nkept their knowledge and their suspicions to themselves.\n\n\"I guessed,\" Stanton said. \"What is it, George?\" He flexed his muscles\nunder the caress of the hot, moist currents in the box.\n\nHe wondered why it was so important that the psychologist interrupt him\nwhile he was relaxing after strenuous exercise. Yoritomo looked excited\nin spite of his attempt to be calm. And yet Stanton knew that, whatever\nit was, it wasn't anything tremendously urgent or Dr. Yoritomo would be\nacting a great deal differently.\n\nYoritomo leaned forward in his chair, his thin lips in an excited smile,\nhis black-irised eyes sparkling. \"I had to come tell you. The sheer,\nutter beauty of it is too much to contain. Three times in a row was\nalmost absolute, Bart. The probability that our hypotheses were correct\nwas computed as straight nines to seven decimals. But now! The fourth\ntime! Straight nines to _twelve_ decimals!\"\n\nStanton lifted an eyebrow. \"Your Oriental calm is deserting you, George.\nI'm not reading you.\"\n\nYoritomo's smile became broader. \"Ah! Sorry. I refer to the theory we\nhave been discussing. About the peculiar mentality of our friend, the\nNipe. You remember?\"\n\nStanton remembered. After six years of watching the recorded actions of\nthe Nipe, Dr. Yoritomo had evolved a theory about the kind of mentality\nthat lay behind the four baleful violet eyes in that snouted alien head.\nIn order that his theory be validated, it was necessary that the theory\nbe able to predict, in broad terms, the future actions of the Nipe.\nEvidently that proof had now come. The psychologist was smiling and\nrubbing his long, bony hands together. For Dr. George Yoritomo, that was\nalmost the equivalent of hysterical excitement.\n\n\"We have been able to predict the behavior of the Nipe!\" he said. \"For\nthe fourth time in succession!\"\n\n\"Great,\" Stanton said. \"Congratulations, George. But how does that fit\nin with the rule you once told me about? You know, the one about\nexperimental animals.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Yoritomo said, nodding his head agreeably. \"The Harvard Law\nof Animal Behavior. 'A genetically standardized strain, under precisely\ncontrolled laboratory conditions, when subjected to carefully calibrated\nstimuli, will behave as it damned well pleases.' Yes. Very true.\"\n\nHe held up a cautionary finger. \"But an animal could not do otherwise,\ncould it? Only as it pleases. Could it do anything else? It could not\nplease to behave as something it is not, could it?\"\n\n\"Draw me a picture,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"What I mean,\" Yoritomo said, \"is that any organism is limited in its\nchoice of behavior. A hamster, for example, cannot choose to behave in\nthe manner of a rhesus monkey. A dog cannot choose to react as a mouse\nwould react. If I prick a white mouse with a needle, it may squeal or\nbite or jump--but it will not bark. Never. Nor will it, under any\ncircumstances, leap to a trapeze, hang by its tail, and chatter curses\nat me. Never.\"\n\nStanton chuckled, but he didn't comment.\n\n\"By observing an organism's reactions,\" the psychologist continued, \"one\ncan begin to see a pattern. After long enough observation, the pattern\nalmost approaches certainty. If, for instance, I tell you that I put an\narmful of hay into a certain animal's enclosure, and that the animal\ntrotted over, ate the hay, and brayed, then you will be able to tell me\nwith reasonable certainty whether or not the animal had long ears. Do\nyou see?\"\n\n\"Sure. But you haven't been able to pinpoint the Nipe's activities that\neasily yet, have you?\" Stanton asked.\n\n\"Ah, no,\" said Yoritomo. \"Not at all. That was merely an analogy, and we\nmust not make the mistake of carrying an analogy too far. The more\nintelligent a creature is, the greater, in general, is its scope of\naction. The Nipe is far from being so simple as a monkey or a hamster.\nOn the other hand--\" He smiled widely, showing bright, white teeth.\n\"--he is not so bright as a human being.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" Stanton looked at him skeptically. \"I wouldn't say he was\nexactly stupid, George. What about all those prize gadgets of his?\" He\nblinked. \"Wipe the sweat off my forehead, will you? It's running into my\neyes.\"\n\nDr. Yoritomo wiped with the towel as he continued. \"Ah, yes. He is quite\ncapable in that respect, my friend. Quite capable. That is because of\nhis great memory--at once his finest asset and his greatest curse.\"\n\nHe draped the towel around Stanton's head again and stepped back, his\nface unsmiling. \"Imagine having a near-perfect memory, Bart.\"\n\nStanton's jaw muscles tightened a little before he spoke. \"I think I'd\nlike it,\" he said.\n\nYoritomo shrugged slightly. \"Perhaps you would. But it would most\ncertainly not be the asset you think. Look at it very soberly, my\nfriend.\n\n\"The most difficult teaching job in the world is the attempt to teach an\norganism something that that organism already knows. True? Yes. If a man\nalready knows the shape of the Earth, it will do you no good to teach\nhim. If he _knows_, for example, that the Earth is flat, but round like\na pancake, your contention that it is round like a ball will make no\nimpression upon his mind whatever. He _knows_, you see. He _knows_.\n\n\"Now. Imagine a race with a perfect memory--a memory that never fades. A\nmemory in which each bit of data is as bright and as fresh as the moment\nit was imprinted, and as readily available as the data stored in a\nrobot's mind. It is, in effect, a robotic memory.\n\n\"If you put false data into the memory banks of a mathematical\ncomputer--such as telling it that the square of two is five--you cannot\ncorrect that error simply by telling it the true fact that the square of\ntwo is four. No. First you must remove the erroneous data. Not so?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"Very good. Then let us look at the Nipe race, wherever it was spawned\nin this universe. Let us look at the race a long time back--way back\nwhen they first became _Nipe sapiens_. Back when they first developed a\ntrue language. Each little Nipe child, as it is born or hatched or\nbudded--whatever it is they do--is taught as rapidly as possible all\nthe things it must know in order to survive. And once a little Nipelet\nis taught a thing, it _knows_. That knowledge is there, and it is\npermanent, and it can be brought instantly to the fore. And if it is\ntaught a falsehood, then it cannot be taught the truth. You see?\"\n\nStanton thought about it. \"Well, yes. But eventually there are going to\nbe cases where reality doesn't jibe with what he's been taught, aren't\nthere? And wouldn't cold reality force a change?\"\n\n\"Ah. In some cases, yes. In most, no,\" said Yoritomo. \"Look: Suppose one\nof these primordial Nipes runs across a tiger--or whatever large\ncarnivore passes for a tiger on their home planet. This Nipe, let us\nsay, has never seen a tiger before, so he does not observe that this\nparticular tiger is old, ill, and weak. It is, as a matter of fact, on\nits last legs. Our primordial Nipe hits it on the head, and it drops\ndead. He drags the body home for the family to feed upon.\n\n\"'How did you kill it, Papa?'\n\n\"'Why, it was the simplest thing in the world, my child. I walked up to\nit, bashed it firmly on the noggin, and it died. That is the way to kill\ntigers.'\"\n\nYoritomo smiled. \"It is also a good way to kill Nipes. Eh?\" He took the\ntowel and wiped Stanton's brow again.\n\n\"The error,\" he continued, \"was made when Papa Nipe made the\ngeneralization from _one_ tiger to _all_ tigers. If tigers were rare,\nthis erroneous bit of lore might be passed on for many generations\nunchecked and spread through the Nipe community as time passed. Those\nwho did learn that most tigers are _not_ conquered by walking up to them\nand hitting them on the noggin undoubtedly died before they could pass\nthis new bit of information on. Then, perhaps, one day a Nipe survived\nthe ordeal. His mind now contained conflicting information which must be\nresolved. He _knows_ that tigers are killed in this way. He also\n_knows_ that this one was not so obliging as to die. What is wrong? Ha!\nHe has the solution! Plainly, _this_ particular beast _was not a\ntiger_!\"\n\n\"How does he explain that to the others?\" Stanton asked.\n\n\"What does he tell his children?\" Yoritomo asked rhetorically. \"Why,\nfirst he tells them how tigers are killed. You walk up to one and bash\nit on the head. But then he warns his little Nipelets that there is an\nanimal around that looks _just like_ a tiger, but it is _not_ a tiger.\nOne should not make the mistake of thinking it _is_ a tiger or one will\nget oneself badly hurt. Now, since the only way to tell the true tiger\nfrom the false is to give it a hit on the head, and since that test may\nprove rather injurious, if not absolutely fatal, to the Nipe who tries\nit, it follows that one is better off if one scrupulously avoids all\nanimals that look like tigers. You see?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Stanton. \"Some snarks are boojums.\"\n\n\"Exactly! Thank you for that allusion,\" Yoritomo said with a smile. \"I\nmust remember to use it in my report.\"\n\n\"It seems to me to follow,\" Stanton said musingly, \"that there would\ninevitably be some things that they'd never learn the truth about, once\nthey had gotten the wrong idea into their heads.\"\n\n\"Ah! Indeed. Absolutely true. It is precisely that which led me to\nformulate my theory in the first place. How else are we to explain that\nthe Nipe, for all his tremendous technical knowledge, is nonetheless a\nmember of a society that is still in the ancient ritual-taboo stage of\ndevelopment?\"\n\n\"A savage?\"\n\nYoritomo laughed softly. \"As to his savagery, I think no one on Earth\nwould disagree. But they are not the same thing. What I do mean is that\nthe Nipe is undoubtedly the most superstitious and bigoted being on the\nface of this planet.\"\n\nThere was a knock on the door of the steam room.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Dr. Yoritomo.\n\nThe physical therapist stuck his head in. \"Sorry to interrupt, but the\nclam is done. I'll have to give him a rubdown, Doc.\"\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" Yoritomo said. \"We had almost finished. Think\nover what I have said, eh, Bart?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure, George,\" Stanton said abstractedly. Yoritomo left, and\nStanton got up on the rubdown table and lay prone. The therapist, seeing\nthat his patient was in no mood for conversation, proceeded with the\nmassage in silence.\n\nStanton lay on the table, his head pillowed in his arms, while the\ntherapist rubbed and kneaded his muscles. The pleasant sensation formed\na background for his thoughts. For the first time, Stanton was seeing\nthe Nipe as an individual--as a person--as a thinking, feeling being.\n\n_We have a great deal in common, you and I_, he thought. _Except that\nyou're a lot worse off than I am._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_I'm actually feeling sorry for the poor guy_, Stanton thought. _Which,\nI suppose, is a hell of a lot better than feeling sorry for myself. The\nonly real, basic difference between us freaks is that you're more of a\nfreak than I am. \"Molly O'Grady and the Colonel's lady are sisters under\nthe skin.\"_\n\n_Where'd that come from? Something I learned in school, no doubt--like\nthe snarks and the boojums._\n\n    _He would answer to_ Hi! _or to any loud cry,\n      Such as_ Fry me! _or_ Fritter my wig!\n\n_Who was that? The snark? No. The snark had a flavor like that of\nwill-o'-the-wisp. And I must remember to distinguish those that have\nfeathers, and bite, from those that have whiskers, and scratch._\n\nDamn _this memory of mine!_\n\n_Or can I even call it mine when I can't even use it?_\n\n_\"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I\nknow in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\"_\n\n_Another jack-in-the-box thought popping up from nowhere._\n\n_The only way I'll ever get all of this stuff straightened out in my\nmind is to get more information. And it doesn't look as though anyone is\ngoing to give it to me on a platter, either. The Institute men seem to\nbe awfully chary about giving information away, even to me. George even\nhad to chase away old rub-and-pound (That feels good!) before he would\ntalk about the Nipe. Can't blame 'em for that, of course. There'd be\nhell to pay for everyone around if the general public ever found out\nthat the Nipe has been kept as a pet for six years._\n\n_How many people has he killed in that time? Twenty? Thirty? How much\nblood does Colonel Mannheim have on his hands?_\n\n    _Though they know not why,\n      Or for what they give,\n    Still, the few must die,\n      That the many may live._\n\n_I wonder whether I read all that stuff complete or just browsed through\na copy of Bartlett's_ Quotations.\n\n_Fragments._\n\n_We've got to get organized around here, brother. Colonel Mannheim's\npuppet is going to have to cut his strings and do a Pinocchio._\n\n\n\n\n_[16]_\n\n\nColonel Walther Mannheim unlocked the door of his small suite of rooms\nin the Officers' Barracks. God! he was tired. It wasn't so much physical\nexhaustion as mental and emotional release from the tension he had been\nunder for the preceding few hours. Or had it been years?\n\nHe dropped his heavy briefcase on a nearby chair, took off his cap and\ndropped it on the briefcase.\n\nHe stood there for a moment, looking tiredly around. Everything was in\norder, as usual. He seldom came to Government City any more. Twenty or\nso visits in the last ten years, and only a dozen of them had been long\nenough to force him to spend the night in his old suite at the World\nPolice Headquarters at the southern end of the island. He didn't like to\nstay in Government City; it made him uneasy, being this close to the\nNipe's underground nest. The Nipe had too many taps into government\ncommunication channels, too many ways of seeing and hearing what went on\nhere in the nerve center of civilization.\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of this whole operation had been the\ncareful balancing of information flow through those channels that the\nNipe had tapped. To stop using them would betray immediately to that\nalien mind that his taps had been detected. The information flow must go\non as usual. There was no way to censor the information, either,\nalthough it was known that the Nipe relied on them for planning his\nraids. But since there was no way of knowing, even after years of\nobservation, what sort of thing the Nipe would be wanting next, there\nwas no way of knowing which information should be removed from the\ntapped channels.\n\nAnd, most certainly, removing _all_ information about every possible\nmaterial that the Nipe might want would make him even more suspicious\nthan simply shutting down the channels altogether. To shut them down\nwould only indicate that the human government had detected his taps; to\ncensor them heavily would indicate that a trap was being laid.\n\nIt was even impossible to censor out news about the Nipe. That, too,\nwould have invited suspicion. So a special corps of men had been set up,\na group whose sole job was to investigate every raid of the Nipe. Every\nraid produced a flurry of activity by this special group. They rushed\nout to look over the scene of the raid, prowled around, and did\neverything that might be expected of an investigative body. Their\nreports were sent in over the usual channels. All the actual data they\ncame up with was sent straight through the normal channels--but the\nconclusions they reached from that data were not. Always, in spite of\neverything, the messages indicated that the police were as baffled as\nbefore.\n\nAll other information relating to the Nipe went through special channels\nknown to be untapped by the Nipe.\n\nAnd yet, there was no way to be absolutely certain of the sum total of\nthe information that the Nipe received. Believing, as he did, in the\nexistence of Real People, he would necessarily assume that _their_\ncommunication systems were hidden from him, and the more difficult they\nwere to find, the more certain he would be that they existed. And it was\nimpossible to know what information the Nipe picked up when he was out\non a raid, away from the spying devices that had been hidden in his\ntunnels.\n\nMannheim walked across the small living room to the sideboard that stood\nagainst one wall and opened a door. Fresh ice, soda, and a bottle of\nScotch were waiting for him. He took one of the ten-ounce glasses,\ndropped in three of the hard-frozen cubes of ice, added a precisely\nmeasured ounce and a half of Scotch, and filled the glass to within an\ninch of the brim with soda. Holding the glass in one hand, he walked\naround the little apartment, checking everything with a sort of\nautomatic abstractedness. The air conditioner was pouring sweet, cool,\nfresh air into the room; the windows--heavy, thick slabs of paraglass\nwelded directly into the wall--admitted the light from the courtyard\noutside, but admitted nothing else. There was no need for them to open,\nbecause of the air conditioning. A century before, some buildings still\nhad fire escapes running down their outsides, but modern fireproofing\nhad rendered such anachronisms unnecessary.\n\nBut his mind was only partly on his surroundings. He went into the\nbedroom, sat down on the edge of the bed, took a long drink from the\ncold glass in his hand, and then put it on the nightstand. Absently he\nbegan pulling off his boots. His thoughts were on the Executive Session\nhe had attended that afternoon.\n\n_\"How much longer, do you think, Colonel?\"_\n\n_\"A few weeks, sir. Perhaps less.\"_\n\n_\"There was another raid in Miami, Colonel. Another man died. We could\nhave prevented that death, Colonel. We could have prevented a great many\ndeaths in the past six years.\"_\n\nAnd what answer was there to that? The Executive Council knew that the\ndeaths were preventable in only one way--by killing the Nipe. And they\nhad long ago agreed that the knowledge in that alien mind was worth the\nsacrifice. But, as he had known would happen when they made the decision\nsix years before, there were some of them who had, inevitably, weakened.\nNot all--not even a majority--but a minority that was becoming stronger.\n\nIt had been, to a great degree, Mannheim's arguments that had convinced\nthem then, and now they were tending to shift the blame for their\ndecision to Mannheim's shoulders.\n\nMost of the Executives were tough-minded, realistic men. They were not\ngoing to step out now unless there were good reason for it. But if the\nsubtle undercutting of the vacillating minority weakened Mannheim's own\nresolve, or if he failed to give solid, well-reasoned answers to their\nquestions, then the whole project would begin to crumble rapidly.\n\nHe had not directly answered the Executive who had pointed out that many\nlives could have been saved if the Nipe had been killed six years ago.\nThere was no use in fighting back on such puerile terms.\n\n_\"Gentlemen, within a few weeks, we will be ready to send Stanton in\nafter the Nipe. If that fails, we can blast him out of his stronghold\nwithin minutes afterwards. But if we stop now, if we allow our judgment\nto be colored at this point, then all those who have died in the past\nsix years will have died in vain.\"_\n\nHe had gone on, exploring and explaining the ramifications of the plans\nfor the next few weeks, but he had carefully kept it on the same level.\nIt had been an emotional sort of speech, but it had been purposely so,\nin answer to the sort of emotionalism that the weakening minority had\nattempted to use on him.\n\nMen had died, yes. But what of that? Men had died before for far less\nworthwhile causes. And men, do what they will, will die eventually. In\nthe back of his mind, he had recalled the battle-cry of some sergeant of\nthe old United States Marines during an early twentieth-century war. As\nhe led his men over the top, he had shouted, \"_Come on, you sons of\nbitches! Do you wanna live forever?_\"\n\nBut Mannheim hadn't mentioned it aloud to the Executive Council.\n\nNor had he pointed out that ten thousand times as many people had died\nduring the same period through preventable accidents. That would not\nhave had the effect he wanted.\n\nThese particular men had died for this particular purpose. They had not\nasked to die. They had not known they were being sacrificed. None of\nthem could be said to have died a hero's death. They had died simply\nbecause they were in a particular place at a particular time.\n\nThey had been allowed to die for a specific purpose. To abort that\npurpose at this time would be to make their deaths, retroactively,\nmurder.\n\nMannheim put his head on the pillow and lifted his feet up on the bed.\nAll he wanted was a few minutes of relaxation. He'd get ready for sleep\nlater. He pressed the control button on the bedframe that lifted the\nhead of the bed up so that he was in a semi-reclining position. He\npicked up his drink and took a second long pull from it.\n\nThen he touched the phone switch and put the receiver to his ear.\n\n\"Beta-beta,\" he said when he heard the tone.\n\nHe heard the hum, and he knew that the ultraprivate phone on the desk of\nDr. Farnsworth, in St. Louis, was signaling. Then Farnsworth's voice\ncame over the linkage.\n\n\"_F_ here.\"\n\n\"_M_ here,\" Mannheim replied. Then he asked guardedly, \"Any sign of our\nboy?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Keep on him,\" Mannheim said. \"Let me know immediately.\"\n\n\"Will do. Any further?\"\n\n\"No. Carry on.\" Mannheim cut off the phone.\n\nWhere the hell had Stanton disappeared to, and why? He had wanted to\nbring the young man to Government City to show him off before the\nExecutives. It would have helped. But Stanton had disappeared.\n\nMannheim was well aware that Stanton had been in the habit of leaving\nthe Institute for long walks during the evenings, but this was the first\ntime he had been gone for twenty-four hours. And even Yoritomo, that\nmaster psychologist, had been unable to give any solid reason for\nStanton's disappearance.\n\n\"You must remember, my dear Colonel,\" Yoritomo had said, \"our young Mr.\nStanton is a great deal more complex in his thinking than is our friend\nthe Nipe.\"\n\n_A hell of a job for a police officer_, Mannheim thought to himself. _I\nknow where the criminal is, but I have to hunt for the only cop on Earth\nwho can arrest him._\n\nHe drained his glass, put it on the nightstand, and closed his eyes to\nthink.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn operator on duty at the spy screens that watched every move of the\nNipe while he was in the tunnels underneath Government City thumbed down\na switch and said, \"All stations alert. Subject is moving southward\ntoward exit, carrying raiding equipment.\"\n\nIt was all that was necessary. The Nipe could not be followed after he\nleft his lair, but the proper groups would be standing by. Somewhere,\nthe Nipe would hit and raid again. Somewhere, there were human lives in\ndanger.\n\nAll anyone could do was wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCautiously and carefully, the Nipe lifted his head out of the cool salt\nwater of the Hudson River, near the point where it widened into New York\nHarbor--still so called after the city that had been the greatest on the\nNorth American continent before the violence of a sun bomb had\ndemolished it forever.\n\nHe looked around carefully to get his bearings, then submerged again.\nThe opening into the ancient sewer was nearby. Once into that network,\nhe would know exactly where he was heading. It had taken weeks to find\nhis way around within the unexplored maze of the old sewers, and he had\nbeen uncertain whether they would lead him to the place he intended to\nvisit, but luck had been with him.\n\nNow he knew exactly where he wanted to go, and exactly what he would\nfind there.\n\nHe had avoided Government City itself since his first appearance there,\nshortly after his arrival, just as he had, as much as possible, avoided\never striking in the same place more than once. But now that it had\nbecome necessary, he went about his work with the same cool\ndetermination that had always marked his activities.\n\nHe knew his destination, too. He knew the two rooms thoroughly, having\nexplored them carefully and gone away undetected. And now that he knew\nthe one he sought was in those rooms, he was ready to make his final\ninvestigation of the man.\n\nHe swam on through the utter blackness of the brackish water until his\nhead broke surface again. Then he went on along the great conduits that\nwere above the level of the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Davidson Greer sat in the gun tower that overlooked the\nOfficers' Barracks and the courtyard surrounding the five-story\nbuilding. He was a tall, solidly built man in his early thirties, with\ndark gray-green eyes and dark blond hair. He didn't particularly care\nfor gun-tower duty, but this sort of thing couldn't be left to anyone\nwho was not in on the secret of the Nipe. As long as Colonel Mannheim\nwas here in Government City, there would be special officers guarding\nhim instead of the usual guard contingent.\n\nNot that Captain Greer was actually expecting the Nipe to make any\nattempt on the colonel's life; that was too remote to be worried about.\nBut the gun towers had been erected fifty or more years before because\nthere were always those who wanted to attempt assassination. Officers of\nthe World Police had not enjoyed great popularity during the\nreconstruction period after the Holocaust. The petty potentates who had\nset themselves up as autocratic rulers in various spots over the Earth\nhad quite often decided that the best way to get the WP off their backs\nwas to kill someone, and quite often that someone was a Police officer.\nDisgruntled nationalists and fanatics of all kinds had tried at various\ntimes to kill one officer or another. The protection was needed then.\n\nEven now there were occasional assassins who attempted to invade World\nPolice Headquarters, but they were usually stopped long before they got\ninto the enclosure itself.\n\nStill, there was always the chance. There had been, in the past few\nyears, an undercurrent of rebellion all over Earth because of the Nipe.\nThe monster hadn't been killed, and there were those who screamed that\nthe failure was due to the inefficiency of the Police.\n\nOne attempt had already been made on the life of a Major Thorensen\nbecause he had failed to get the Nipe after a raid in Leopoldville. The\nwould-be assassin had been cut down just before he threw a grenade that\nwould have killed half a dozen men. Captain Greer had been assigned to\nmake sure that no such attempt would succeed with Colonel Mannheim.\n\nHe could see the length of the hallway that led to Colonel Mannheim's\nsuite. The hallway had been purposely designed for watching from the gun\ntower. To one who was inside, it looked like an ordinary hallway,\nstretching down the length of the building. But it was walled with a\nspecial plastic that, while opaque to visible light, was perfectly\ntransparent to infra-red. To the ordinary unaided eye, the walls of the\nbuilding presented a blank face to the gun tower, but to the eye of an\ninfra-red scope, the hallways of all five floors looked as though they\nwere long, glass-enclosed terraces. And those walls were neither the\nferro-concrete of the main building nor the pressure glass of the\nwindows, but ordinary heavy-gauge plastic. To the bullets that could be\nspewed forth from the muzzle of the heavy-caliber, high-powered machine\ngun in the tower, those walls were practically nonexistent.\n\nCaptain Greer surveyed the hallways with his infra-red binoculars.\nNothing. The halls were empty. He lowered the binoculars and lit a\ncigarette. Then he put his eyes to the aiming scope of the gun and\nswiveled the muzzle a little. The aiming scope showed nothing either.\n\nHe leaned back and exhaled a cloud of smoke.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Mannheim blinked and looked at the ceiling. It took him a minute\nto re-orient himself. Then he grinned rather sheepishly, realizing that\nhe had dozed off with his clothes on. Even worse, the pressure at his\nhip told him that he hadn't even bothered to take his sidearm off. He\nsat up and swung his feet to the floor, then glanced at his wrist. Three\nin the morning.\n\n_And the moral of that, my dear Walther_, he told himself, _is that a\ntired man should put on his pajamas first, before he lies down and\ndrinks a Scotch_.\n\nHe stood up. Might as well put his pajamas on and get to bed. He would\nhave to be back in St. Louis by ten in the morning, so he ought to get\nas much sleep as possible.\n\nThe phone chimed.\n\nHe scooped it up and became instantly awake as he heard the voice of\nCaptain Greer from the gun tower that faced the outer wall. \"Colonel,\nthe Nipe is just outside the wall of your apartment, in the hallway. I\nhave him in my sights.\" He was trying to stay calm, Mannheim could tell\nby his voice, but he rattled the words off with machine-gun rapidity.\n\nMannheim thought rapidly. Whatever the Nipe was up to, it wouldn't\ninclude planting a bomb or anything that might kill anyone accidentally.\nIf there was a life in danger, it was his own, and the danger would come\nfrom the Nipe's hands, not from any device or weapon.\n\nHe was thankful that it was Captain Greer up in that tower, not an\nordinary guard who would have fired the instant he saw the alien through\nthe infra-red-transparent walls. Even so, he knew that the captain's\nfingers must be tightening on those triggers. No human being could do\notherwise with that monster in his sights.\n\nMannheim spoke very calmly and deliberately. \"Captain, listen very\ncarefully. Do _not_--I repeat, do _not_, under any circumstances\nwhatever, fire that gun. Understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\n\"I can't tell, sir. He has some sort of gadget in his hands, but he just\nseems to be squatting there.\"\n\n\"At the door?\"\n\n\"No. To the left of it, at the wall.\"\n\n\"You have your cameras going?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"All right. Get everything that happens. Under no circumstances shoot or\ngive the alarm--_even if he kills me_. Let him go. I don't think that\nwill happen, but if it does, let him go. I think I can talk to him. I\ndon't think there's much danger. I'm going to leave the phone open so\nyou can record everything, and--\"\n\nThere was a muffled noise from the living room. He heard Captain Greer's\ngasp as he turned. He could see through the bedroom door to the wall of\nthe living room. A large section of the ferro-concrete wall had sagged\naway and collapsed, having suddenly lost its tensile strength. On the\ntop of the rubble, frozen for a long instant, stood the Nipe, watching\nwith those four glowing violet eyes.\n\nMannheim let go the phone and turned to face the monster, and in that\ninstant he realized his mistake.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Nipe stared at the human being. Was this, at last, a Real Person? It\nwas surprising that the man should be awake. Only a minute before, the\ninstruments had shown him to be in the odd cataleptic state that these\ncreatures lapsed into periodically, similar to, but not identical with,\nhis own rest state. And yet he was now awake and fully dressed. Surely\nthat indicated--\n\nAnd then the man turned, and the Nipe saw the weapon in the holster at\nhis waist. There was a blinding instant of despair as he realized that\nhis hopes had been shattered--\n\n--and then he launched himself across the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nColonel Mannheim's hand darted toward the gun at his hip. It was purely\nreflex action. Even as he did it, he was aware that he would never get\nthe weapon out in time to bring it to bear on the onrushing monster, and\nhe was content that it should be so.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-five minutes later, the Nipe, after carefully licking off the\nfingers of his first pair of hands, went back into the hallway and\nheaded down toward the sewers again.\n\nThe emotion he felt is inexpressible in human terms. Although he had not\nwished to kill the man, it cannot be said that the Nipe felt contrition.\nAlthough he had had no desire to harm the family, if any, of the late\nColonel Mannheim, it cannot be said that the Nipe felt sadness or\ncompassion.\n\nNor, again, although his stomachs churned and his body felt sluggish\nand heavy, can it be said that he felt any regret for what he had done.\n\nThat is not to say that he felt _no_ emotion. He did. His emotions were\nas strong and as deep as those of a very sensitive human being. His\nemotions could bring him pain and they could bring him pleasure. They\ncould crush him or exalt him. His emotions were just as real and as\neffective as any human emotions.\n\nBut they were _not_ human emotions.\n\nThey were emotions, but not _human_ emotions.\n\nIt is impossible to render into any human terms the simple statement:\n\"The Nipe felt that he had properly rendered homage to a validly slain\nfoe.\"\n\nThat cannot even begin to indicate the emotion the Nipe felt as he moved\ndown toward the sewer and escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCaptain Davidson Greer, his eyes staring with glassy hatred through the\ninfra-red gunsight, was registering a very human emotion. His trigger\nfingers were twitching spasmodically--squeezing, squeezing, squeezing.\n\nBut his fingers were not on the triggers.\n\n\n\n\n_[17]_\n\n\n\"It is not your fault, Bart,\" said George Yoritomo softly. \"You had a\nperfect right to go.\"\n\nBart Stanton clenched his fists and turned suddenly to face the Japanese\npsychologist. \"Sure! Hell, yes! We're not discussing my _rights_,\nGeorge! We're discussing my criminal stupidity! I had the right to leave\nhere any time I wanted to, sure. But I didn't have the right to\nexercise that right--if that makes any sense to you.\"\n\n\"It makes sense,\" Yoritomo agreed, \"but it is not the way to look at it.\nYou could not have been with the colonel every minute of every day.\nThere was no way of knowing--\"\n\n\"Of course not!\" Stanton cut in angrily. \"But I should have been there\n_this_ time. He wanted me there, and I was gone. If I'd been there, he'd\nbe alive at this moment.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" Yoritomo said, \"and then again, possibly not. Sit down over\nthere on your bed, my young friend, and listen to me. Sit! That's it.\nTake a deep breath, hold it, and relax. I want your ears functioning\nwhen I talk to you. That's better.\n\n\"Now. I do not know where you went. That is your business. All you--\"\n\n\"I went to Denver,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"And you found?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Stanton said. \"Absolutely nothing.\"\n\n\"What were you looking for?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Something about my past. Something about myself. I don't\nknow.\"\n\n\"Ah. You went to look up your family. You were trying to fill the holes\nin your memory. Eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you did not succeed.\"\n\n\"No. No. There wasn't anything there that I didn't remember. In general,\nI mean. I found the files in the Bureau of Statistics. I know how my\nfather died now, and how my mother died. And what happened to my\nbrother. But all that didn't tell me anything. I'm still looking for\nsomething, and I don't know what it is. I was stupid to have gone. I\nsuppose I should have asked you or Dr. Farnsworth or the colonel.\"\n\n\"But you thought we wouldn't answer,\" Yoritomo said.\n\n\"I guess that's about it. I should have asked you.\"\n\nYoritomo shook his head. \"Not necessarily. It was actually better that\nyou looked for yourself. Besides, we could not have given you any answer\nif you yourself do not know the question. We still can't.\"\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" Stanton said, \"that you know the question as well as\nthe answer.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps not. But there are some things that every man must\nfind out for himself. You were right to do as you did. If you had asked\nColonel Mannheim for permission, he would have let you go. He would not\nhave asked you to go to Government City with him. We--\"\n\n\"That's the whole damned trouble!\" Stanton snapped. \"I'm the star\nboarder around here, the indispensable man. So I'm babied and I'm\ncoddled, and when I goof off I'm patted on the back.\"\n\n\"And just how did you goof off?\" Yoritomo asked.\n\n\"I should have been here, ready to go with the colonel.\"\n\n\"Very well. Suppose you had gone. Do you think you could have saved his\nlife? He could have saved his own life if he'd wanted to. Instead, he\nspecifically ordered the guard not to shoot under any circumstances. If\nyou had been there, the results would have been the same. He would have\nforbidden you to do anything at all. The time is not yet ripe for you to\nface the Nipe. You would not have been able to protect him without\ndisobeying his orders.\"\n\n\"I might have done just that,\" said Stanton.\n\nYoritomo was suddenly angry. \"Then it is better that you were in Denver,\nyoung fool! Colonel Walther Mannheim believed that no single human life\nis worth the loss of the knowledge in that alien's mind! He proved that\nby sacrificing his own life when that became necessary. I like to think\nthat I would have done the same thing myself. I am certain Dr.\nFarnsworth would. We would rather _all_ be dead than allow that fund of\ndata to be lost to the rest of humanity!\"\n\n\"But--but who will carry on, with him dead?\" Stanton asked. \"He was the\none who co-ordinated everything. You and Farnsworth aren't cut out for\nthat sort of thing. Nor am I.\"\n\n\"No,\" Yoritomo said. \"But that has already been taken care of. Mannheim\nhad a replacement ready. A message is being sent out in Mannheim's name,\nsince we are keeping the colonel's death secret for the time being.\n_You_ are the only indispensable man, Stanton. The rest of us can easily\nbe replaced. The lives of dozens of human beings have been\nsacrificed--five years of your own life have been sacrificed--to put you\nin the right place at the right time. And the job you are to do does not\nand never has included acting as bodyguard for Colonel Mannheim or\nanyone else. Understand?\"\n\nStanton nodded slowly. \"I understand, George. I understand.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[18]_\n\n\nThe detective pushed his way out of the crowded courtroom before the\nrest of the crowd started to move. The members of the jury were still\nfiling in, and he knew that no one else would leave the room until the\nverdict was in.\n\nHe didn't care. He knew what the verdict ought to be. He knew also that\njuries had occasionally been swayed by histrionics on the part of the\ndefense counsel, and had been persuaded to free guilty men. He knew,\ntoo, that prosecutors had railroaded innocent men. But such things as\nthat didn't happen often in the Belt. A man doesn't live too long in\nthe Belt unless he's capable of recognizing Truth when he sees it.\n\nBut even if the wrong verdict had been brought in, there would have been\nnothing he could do about it now. He had done his part. He had done\neverything he could. He had brought them in. He had testified. All the\nrest of it was up to the Jury and the Court--those two enigmatic halves\nof Justice and Judgment.\n\nThe point was that this was the perfect time to leave the courtroom.\nWhen he reached his office, he could, if he wanted--and, he thought\nruefully, he probably _would_ want to, in spite of his pretended\nindifference--call up to find out what the verdict had been. But, during\nthese few moments, all eyes were on the jury box. No one was watching\nwho left quietly by the side door of the big courtroom.\n\nHe moved silently and with assurance in the fractional-gee field of the\nplanetoid. One of the uniformed guards looked at him and smiled,\nthrowing him an informal salute.\n\nThe detective returned both. \"If any of those news reporters ask which\nway I went,\" he said amiably, \"tell 'em I went thataway.\" He gestured\nover his shoulder with a thumb.\n\n\"I ain't even seen you, Mr. Martin,\" said the guard.\n\nThe detective waved his thanks and kept going. It wasn't that he\ndisliked newsmen. Most of them were fairly intelligent, pleasant people.\nBut he didn't want to be asked any questions right now. He had given\nthem interviews aplenty during the trial, and they could use those, now\nthat the end of the trial had lifted the news ban. They had plenty of\nquotations from Stan Martin without asking him what he thought of the\nverdict itself.\n\nTen minutes later, he was in his own office in the Lloyd's Area. Helen,\nhis secretary, was just cutting off the phone as he walked into the\nouter office. She flashed him a big smile.\n\n\"They just gave the verdict, Mr. Martin! Guilty all the way down the\nline--conspiracy, extortion, kidnapping, and all the others. The only\n'not guilty' verdict was a minor one. They decided that Hedgepeth wasn't\ninvolved in the actual kidnapping itself, and therefore wasn't guilty of\nthe physical assault of the guard.\"\n\n\"They're probably right,\" the detective said, \"but, as you said, it's a\nminor point. It doesn't much matter whether he was physically present at\nthe time the boy was taken or not; he was certainly in on the plot.\" He\npaused, frowning. \"That's over and done with, except for a possible\nappeal. And it's unlikely that that would involve us, anyway. Get Mr.\nPelham on the phone, will you? I'll take it in my office.\"\n\n\"The _Morton_ case?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah. There's something fishy about the wreck of the spaceship\n_Morton_, and I want Pelham to let me work on it.\"\n\nHe went on into his office and had barely sat down when the phone\nhummed. \"Yes?\" he said, depressing the switch.\n\n\"Mr. BenChaim would like to speak to you, sir,\" Helen said formally.\n\n\"Oh?\" In order to have gotten here so quickly, BenChaim, too, must have\nleft before the verdict was delivered. He was hardly more than a minute\nbehind the detective. And that was unusual in a man who was waiting at\nthe trial of the kidnappers of his own son. Still, Moishe BenChaim was\nan unusual man.\n\n\"Tell him to come right on in,\" the detective said. \"Oh, and Helen ...\nhold off on that Pelham call for a little while.\" He didn't want to be\ntalking business while BenChaim was in the office.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" she said.\n\nA few seconds later, the door opened, and Moishe BenChaim came in. He\nwas not a big man, but he was broad of shoulder and broad of girth,\nbuilt like a wrestler. He had a heavy, graying beard, and wore it with a\npatriarchal air. He was breathing rather heavily as he came through the\ndoor, and he stopped suddenly to pull a handkerchief from his pocket. He\nbegan coughing--harsh, racking, painful coughs that shook his heavy\nframe.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said after a moment. \"Damn lungs. Shouldn't try to move so\nfast.\" He wiped his lips and put the handkerchief away.\n\nThe detective didn't say anything. He knew that Moishe BenChaim had\ninjured his lungs eighteen years before. An accident in space had\nruptured his spacesuit, and the explosive decompression that had\nresulted had almost killed him. He had saved his own life by holding the\ntorn spot with one hand and turning up the air-tank valve full blast\nwith the other. The rough patch job had held long enough for him to get\nback inside his ship, but his lungs had never been the same, and his\neyes were eternally bloodshot from the ruptured and distended\ncapillaries.\n\n\"I noticed you'd slipped out of the courtroom,\" he went on. \"I hope you\ndon't mind my following you.\"\n\n\"Of course not, Mr. BenChaim,\" the detective said. \"Sit down.\"\n\nBenChaim sat in the chair across the desk from the detective. \"I didn't\nwait for the verdict,\" he said. \"I knew the conviction was certain after\nyou testified.\"\n\n\"Thanks. My secretary got the news just before you came in. Guilty\nstraight across the board. But your son's testimony was a lot more\ntelling than mine.\"\n\n\"Guilty,\" BenChaim repeated with satisfaction. \"Naturally. What else? I\nadmit my son's testimony was good,\" he continued; \"Little Shmuela told\nhis story like a little man up there in the witness-box. Never looked\nscared, never got mixed up. But Shmuela's testimony was your testimony\ntoo, Mr. Martin. If it hadn't been for you, he wouldn't be here to\ntestify, for which I'm grateful to God.\" Then he leaned back and spread\nhis hands apart in a gesture of dismissal.\n\n\"But that's all over and done with,\" he said. \"I came about a different\nmatter.\" Again he paused, as if picking his words carefully. \"Do you\nknow a man named Barnabas Nguma?\"\n\n\"Nguma? Yes; I met him once. Why?\"\n\n\"He was in the courtroom today. He came to see me just before court\nconvened.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" the detective said noncommittally.\n\n\"Yes. He claims to represent an organization on Earth which has been\ntrying to hire you for a job there. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the detective said warily. \"What did he want with you?\"\n\n\"Now, that's a funny thing,\" BenChaim said. \"It seems that he's under\nthe impression that you turned down his job to take on this kidnapping.\nIs that right?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" the detective said tightly. \"I was working on your son's\ncase before he and a couple of other men came out here to talk to me.\nBut they'd written to me long before that.\" He wondered what BenChaim\nwas getting at. He didn't owe any explanations to the industrialist,\nbut, on the other hand, he couldn't be impolite to him.\n\n\"I see,\" BenChaim said, nodding his head slowly. \"Like most Earthies,\nMr. Nguma is suffering under a misapprehension. He seems to think that I\nhave some sort of hold over you, that I was the one who made you turn\ndown his job, so that you'd take _my_ case.\"\n\n\"Oh? Was he angry because you'd put your own selfish interests ahead of\nhis unselfish ones?\" the detective asked with a trace of hard sarcasm in\nhis voice.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said BenChaim. \"Oh, no. Not at all. He said he understood\nperfectly. But he wondered if, now that my boy had been returned safely,\nI might not put a little pressure on you to get you to take his case.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\nMoishe BenChaim scowled. \"I told him exactly where he could head in. I\ntold him that I had no power over you whatever, that I hadn't hired you\nat all, that I didn't even know that you were working on the case until\nafter you rescued Shmuel. I told him that even if I held the power of\nlife and death over you I would never lift so much as a finger against\nyou. I told him that it was just the other way around, in fact. I told\nhim that you have such a power over me because of what you did for\nShmuel that it is _I_ who will jump through _your_ hoop if ordered, not\nthe other way around. I was quite angry.\" BenChaim relaxed a little\nbefore going on. \"Actually, I'm sorry I blew up. He's a well-meaning\nman, I think.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" the detective said. \"Did he tell you what the job was?\"\n\n\"With most heart-rending particulars,\" said BenChaim. \"I was told all\nabout how this Nipe has been killing and eating people, as if I didn't\nknow already. But it wasn't until I heard him talk that I realized how\nscared people are back there on Earth. You know, Martin, we're insulated\nout here. We don't feel that terror, even when we read about it or see\nthe reports on the newscasts. If everybody on Earth is as scared as that\nMr. Nguma is, it's a wonder they haven't all panicked and taken to\nrunning around in circles.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, Mr. BenChaim,\" the detective said levelly, \"they\nhave begun to do just that. Mr. Nguma and his friends have been after me\nfor a long time to take their job. They have pulled every trick they can\nthink of--including this last one with you--to get me to go back to\nEarth and find that monster. I have refused them so often and so firmly\nthat they are convinced I'm afraid to tackle the Nipe. They are\nconvinced that I know I'll fail. And yet they keep after me. If that\nisn't running around in circles, it'll do until a better example comes\nalong.\"\n\n\"They're out of their minds,\" BenChaim said flatly. \"Of _course_ no man\nin his right mind would try to face down that thing! It would be as\nsilly as trying to outrun a bullet or do arithmetic faster than a\ncomputer. That's common sense. That's showing a healthy respect for the\nNipe--not fear. At least, not fear in the way that those men are\nafraid.\"\n\nSuddenly the detective knew why the industrialist had come. He knew that\nMoishe BenChaim wanted to reassure Stanley Martin, to tell him that he\nwas doing the sensible thing in turning down so dangerous an assignment.\nHe could almost have predicted word for word what BenChaim was going to\nsay next.\n\n\"Nguma may be here at any minute,\" said the industrialist. \"He told me\nthat he was going to come as soon as the trial was over. What are you\ngoing to tell him this time? I know it's none of my business, but I'm\nasking, just the same.\"\n\n\"I'm going to tell him _no_,\" the detective said. \"I will not return to\nEarth for any reason whatever.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said BenChaim. \"Good. That's the smart thing to do. And don't\nlet him buffalo you. We know you out here in the Belt, Martin. I've been\nout here for thirty years, and I know what kind of guts it takes to do\nthe things you've done. Those men don't understand space. Nobody\nunderstands space until he's lived in it and worked in it, and had cold\ndeath only a fraction of an inch away from his skin for hours and days\nat a time. No matter what those Earthies say, we know you've got more\nguts than anybody else in the Belt--to say nothing of those\nstay-at-homes on Earth.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I appreciate that,\" the detective said. But they were only\nwords. He knew that BenChaim meant exactly what he said--or thought he\nmeant it. But he also knew that BenChaim and others would always wonder\nwhy he had turned the job down.\n\n_God!_ he thought, _I wish I knew!_ The thought was only momentary.\nThen, as it had done so many times before, his mind veered away from the\ndangerous subject.\n\nMoishe BenChaim stood up. \"Well, that's all I had to say, Mr. Martin. I\njust wanted to warn you that that man might be coming around and to tell\nyou how I felt. Remember what I said about jumping through a hoop. Any\ntime you need me, for anything at all, you just say so. Understand?\"\n\n\"I understand,\" the detective said, forcing a smile. He rose and shook\nthe industrialist's outstretched hand. \"And thanks again,\" he added.\n\nAfter BenChaim had gone, the detective sat thinking, toying with a\npencil on his desk. Moishe BenChaim, like so many others in the Belt,\nhad come out with nothing but his brain and his two hands and the\nequipment necessary to keep him alive. In thirty years, he had parlayed\nthat into one of the biggest fortunes in the Solar System. It was men\nlike that whose respect he valued, and, on the surface, he apparently\nhad that respect. But refusing the Nipe job would dull the bright sheen\nof that respect, and he knew it. BenChaim had talked about how foolish\nit would be to try to beat the Nipe in a face-to-face encounter, but he\nhadn't meant it. He knew perfectly well that all Stanley Martin would be\nexpected to do would be to find out where the Nipe's hideout was. Once\nthat had been accomplished, men and machines--most especially\nmachines--could wipe the monster from the face of the Earth. One\nwell-placed bomb would do it, if the authorities only knew where to\nplace that bomb. If only--\n\nAgain his mind veered away, refusing to consider the Nipe too carefully\nor too closely.\n\nThe intercom on his desk hummed, and he pressed the switch.\n\n\"Yes, Helen?\"\n\n\"That Mr. Nguma was here while Mr. BenChaim was with you, Mr. Martin. I\nfollowed your instructions and told him that you would not see him.\"\n\n\"Fine. Thanks, Helen.\"\n\n\"Also, there's a radiogram for you from Earth.\"\n\n\"If it's from one of Nguma's colleagues,\" the detective said, \"I don't\nwant to see it. File it in the cylindrical file--under _W_.\"\n\n\"I don't think it is,\" the secretary said doubtfully. \"I can't make any\nsense out of it. I'd better bring it in.\"\n\n\"Okay. And then put that call through to Pelham. I want to get going on\nthat _Morton_ spaceship wrecking. I'm getting itchy for action.\"\n\nShe brought in the radiogram and put it on his desk before calling\nPelham. She had already read it, of course. It was her job to read such\nthings.\n\nThe detective picked up the sheet of paper and read it.\n\n    THE OPERATION IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. I NEED\n\n    THE OTHER HALF OF MY FORCEPS. COME HOME\n\n    AND JOIN THE BIG PARADE.\n\n                                 MANNHEIM\n\nIt took a second for the words to really impress themselves on his mind.\nHe read them over again.\n\nAnd the veil began to drop from the closed-off part of his mind.\n\nMemories began to swarm back into his mind--memories that had been\nwalled off and kept away from his conscious mind by the hypnotic\nsuggestion implanted so long ago.\n\nOddly, it did not surprise or shock him. He was an expert at hypnosis,\nespecially self-hypnosis. He recognized the message for exactly what it\nwas: a series of code phrases designed to break the blockage that had\nbeen placed in his mind.\n\nHis only reaction was to laugh aloud. \"By God!\" he said. \"It worked! It\nactually worked! Nearly six years, and I never suspected once!\"\n\nThe phone hummed. He switched it on. \"Mr. Pelham is on the phone, Mr.\nMartin,\" Helen said.\n\nHe watched as the florid, smiling face of Pelham, his superior, appeared\non the screen. \"What can I do for you, Martin?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have a favor to ask, Mr. Pelham.\"\n\n\"Anything within reason,\" Pelham said. \"After this BenChaim affair,\nyou're in good standing around here.\" He chuckled.\n\n\"I want a leave of absence,\" the detective said.\n\nPelham looked a little surprised. \"Well, I guess you deserve it. You\nneed a rest, I imagine.\"\n\n\"No,\" the detective said. \"No, it isn't that. I'm going after bigger\ngame, is all.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"I'm going to Earth to find the Nipe.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[19]_\n\n\nFrom the very moment he had heard that \"Stanley Martin\" had arrived to\ntake charge of the project, Bart Stanton pushed all thoughts of his\nbrother out of his mind. He had fouled up once by thinking of himself\nrather than thinking of what had to be done; he would not make that\nmistake again.\n\nNor, apparently, did Martin have any desire to meet Bart Stanton. He\ntook control of the project smoothly. Apparently Mannheim had taken into\naccount the possibility of his own death and had arranged things\naccordingly. Although Martin was not a member of the World Police, his\nown record showed that he had the ability to handle the job, and an\nExecutive Session had unanimously accepted Colonel Mannheim's wishes in\nthe matter. There was little else they could do; the very fact that\nMannheim had died in the way he had, ordering the guard to hold his\nfire, had stilled those voices on the Executive Council who had been\nwavering before.\n\nMartin had come in to Earth almost secretly, without fanfare, and the\ngeneral public was totally unaware that anything at all had happened.\n\nSpecial messages, going through the channels known to be tapped by the\nNipe, said that it would not be in the public interest to admit that the\nNipe could actually penetrate the defenses of World Police Headquarters,\nso the Nipe was not surprised when the public news channels announced\nquietly that Colonel Walther Mannheim, the man who had been decorated\ntwelve years before for the quelling of the Central Brazilian\nInsurrection, had died peacefully in his sleep. The funeral was quiet,\nbut with full honors.\n\nStanton stopped worrying about such things. Until he had done the job\nthat he had been rebuilt for, he was determined to make that goal his\nsole purpose. As the weeks sped by, he kept determinedly to his regime,\nexercising regularly to keep himself in top physical condition, and\nstudying the three-dimensional motion studies of the Nipe in action.\n\nOnly one of these made him ill the first time he watched it, but it was\nthe only recording of the Nipe actually in the process of killing a\nman, so he watched, over and over again, the shots taken from the gun\ntower when the Nipe attacked Colonel Mannheim.\n\nA full-sized mockup of the Nipe's body had been built, with the best\napproximation possible of the Nipe's bone structure and musculature, and\nStanton worked with it to determine what, if any, were the Nipe's\nphysical limitations.\n\nHis only periods of relative relaxation occurred when he discussed the\npsychological peculiarities of the Nipe mind with George Yoritomo.\n\nOne afternoon, after a particularly strenuous boxing session, he walked\ninto Yoritomo's office with a grin on his face. \"I've been considering\nthe problem of the apparent paradox of a high technology in a\nritual-taboo system.\"\n\nYoritomo grinned back delightedly and waved Stanton to a chair.\n\"Excellent! It is always much better if the student thinks these things\nout for himself. Now, while I fill this hand-furnace with tobacco and\nfire up, you will please explain to me all about it.\"\n\nStanton sat down and settled himself comfortably. \"All right. In the\nfirst place, there's the notion of religion. In tribal cultures, the\nreligion is usually--uh--animistic, I think the word is.\"\n\nYoritomo nodded silently.\n\n\"They believe there are spirits everywhere,\" Stanton said. \"That sort of\nbelief, it seems to me, would grow up in any race that had imagination,\nand the Nipes must have had plenty of that, or they wouldn't have the\ntechnology that we know they do have. Am I on the right track?\"\n\n\"Very good. _Very_ good,\" Yoritomo said in approval. \"But what evidence\nhave you that this technology was not given to them by some other, more\nadvanced race?\"\n\n\"I hadn't thought of that.\" Stanton stared into space for a moment, then\nnodded his head. \"Of course. It would take too long to teach them. It\nwouldn't be worth all the trouble it would take to make them unlearn\ntheir fallacies and learn the new facts. It would take generations to do\nit unless this hypothetical other race killed off all the adult Nipes\nand started the little ones off fresh. And that didn't happen, because\nif it had, the ritual-taboo system would have died out, too. So that\nother-race theory is out.\"\n\n\"The argument is imperfect,\" Yoritomo said, \"but it will suffice for the\nmoment. Go on about the religion.\"\n\n\"Okay. Religious beliefs are not subject to pragmatic tests. That is,\nthe spiritual beliefs aren't. Any belief that _could_ be disproven by\nsuch a test would eventually die out. But beliefs in ghosts or demons or\nangels or life after death aren't disprovable by material tests, any\nmore than they are provable. So, as a race increases its knowledge of\nthe physical world, its religion would tend to become more and more\nspiritual.\"\n\n\"Agreed. Yes. It happened so among human beings,\" said Yoritomo. \"But\nhow do you link this fact with ritual-taboo?\"\n\n\"Well, once a belief gains a foothold,\" Stanton said, \"it is very\ndifficult to wipe it out, even among human beings. Among Nipes, it would\nbe well-nigh impossible. Once a code of ritual and of social behavior\nhad been set up, it became permanent.\"\n\n\"For example?\" Yoritomo urged.\n\n\"Well, shaking hands, for example,\" Stanton said after a pause. \"We\nstill do that, even if we don't have it fixed solidly in our heads that\nwe _must_ do it. I suppose it would never occur to a Nipe not to perform\nsuch a ritual.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" Yoritomo agreed vigorously. \"Such things, once established in\nthe minds of the race, would tend to remain. But it is a characteristic\nof a ritual-taboo system that it resists change. Change is evil. Change\nis wrong. We must use what we know to be true, not try something that\nhas never been tried before. In a ritual-taboo system, a thing which is\nnot ritual is, _ipso facto_, taboo. How, then, can we account for their\nhigh technological achievements?\"\n\n\"The pragmatic engineering approach, I imagine,\" Stanton said. \"If a\nthing works, then go ahead and use it. It is usable. If not, it isn't.\"\n\n\"Approximately,\" said Yoritomo. \"But only approximately. Now it is my\nturn to lecture.\" He put his pipe in an ashtray and held up a long, bony\nfinger. \"Firstly, we must remember that the Nipe is equipped with a\nfunctioning imagination. Secondly, he has in his memory a tremendous\namount of data, all ready at hand. He is capable of working out theories\nin his head, you see. Like the ancient Greeks, he finds no need to test\nsuch theories--_unless_ his thinking indicates that such an experiment\nwould yield something useful. Unlike the Greeks, he has no aversion to\nexperiment. But he sees no need for useless experiment, either.\n\n\"Oh, he would learn, yes. But once a given theory proved workable, how\nresistant he would be to a new theory. Innovators, even in our own\nculture, have a very hard time working against the great inertia of a\nrecognized theory. How much harder it would be in a ritual-taboo society\nwith a perfect memory! How long--how _incredibly_ long--it would take\nsuch a race to achieve the technology the Nipe now has!\"\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of years,\" said Stanton.\n\nYoritomo shook his head briskly. \"Puh! Longer! Much longer!\" He smiled\nwith satisfaction. \"I estimate that the Nipe race first invented the\nsteam engine not less than ten million years ago!\"\n\nHe kept smiling into the dead silence that followed.\n\nAfter a long minute, Stanton said: \"What about atomic energy?\"\n\n\"At least two million years ago,\" Yoritomo said. \"I do not think they\nhave had the interstellar drive more than some fifty thousand years.\"\n\n\"No wonder our pet Nipe is so patient,\" Stanton said with a touch of awe\nin his voice. \"How long do you suppose their individual life-span is?\"\n\n\"Not so long, in comparison,\" said Yoritomo. \"Perhaps no longer than our\nown at the least, or perhaps as much as five hundred years. Considering\nthe tremendous handicaps against them, they have done quite well, I\nthink. Quite well, indeed, for a race of illiterate cannibals.\"\n\n\"How's that again?\" Stanton realized that the scientist was quite\nserious.\n\n\"Hadn't it occurred to you, my friend, that they must be cannibals?\"\nYoritomo asked. \"And that they must be very nearly illiterate?\"\n\n\"No,\" Stanton admitted, \"it hadn't.\"\n\n\"The Nipe, like man, is omnivorous,\" Yoritomo pointed out.\n\"Specialization tends to lead any race up a blind alley, and dietary\nrestrictions are a particularly pernicious form of specialization. A\nlion would starve to death in a wheat field. A horse would perish in a\nbutcher shop full of steaks. A man will survive as long as there is\nsomething around to eat--even if it's another man.\"\n\nYoritomo picked up his pipe and began tapping the ashes out of it.\n\"Also,\" he went on, \"we must remember that Man, early in his career of\nbecoming top dog on Earth, began using a method of removing the unfit.\nRitual traces of it remain today in some societies--the Jewish Bar\nMitzvah, for instance, or the Christian Confirmation. Before and\nimmediately after the Holocaust, there were still primitive societies on\nEarth--in New Guinea, for instance--which still made a rather hard\nordeal out of the Rite of Passage, the ceremony whereby a boy becomes a\nman--if he passes the tests.\"\n\nYoritomo was filling his pipe, a look of somber satisfaction on his lean\nface. \"A few millennia ago, a boy who underwent those tests was killed\noutright if he failed. And was eaten. He had not shown the ability to\noverrule with reason his animal instincts. Therefore, he was not a human\nbeing, but an animal. What better use for a young and succulent animal\nthan to provide meat for the common larder?\"\n\n\"And you think the same process must have been used by the Nipes?\"\nStanton asked.\n\nYoritomo nodded vigorously as he applied a match flame to the tobacco in\nhis pipe. \"The Nipe race must, of necessity, have had some similar\nritualistic tests or they would not have become what they are,\" he said\nwhen he had puffed the pipe alight. \"And we have already agreed that\nonce the Nipes adopted something of that kind, it remained with them.\nNot so? Yes.\n\n\"Also, it can be considered extremely unlikely that the Nipe\ncivilization--if such it can be called--has any geriatric problem. No,\nindeed. No old-age pensions, no old folks' homes, no senility. No, nor\nany specialists in geriatrics, either. When a Nipe becomes a burden\nbecause of age, he is ritually murdered and eaten with all due\nsolemnity.\"\n\nYoritomo pointed his pipestem at Stanton. \"Ah. You frown, my friend.\nHave I made them sound heartless, without the finer feelings of which we\nhumans are so proud? Not so. When Junior Nipe fails his puberty tests,\nwhen Mama and Papa Nipe are sent to their final reward, I have no doubt\nthat there is sadness in the hearts of their loved ones as the honored\nT-bones are passed around the table.\"\n\nHe put the pipe back in his mouth and spoke around it. \"My own\nancestors, not too far back, performed a ritual suicide by disemboweling\nthemselves with a long, sharp knife. Across the abdomen--_so!_--and up\ninto the heart--_so!_ It was considered very bad form to faint or die\nbefore the job was done. Nearby, a relative or a close friend stood with\na sharp sword, to administer the _coup de grace_ by decapitation. It was\nall very sad and very honorable. Their loved ones bore the sorrow with\ngreat pride.\"\n\nHis voice, which had been low and tender, suddenly became very brisk.\n\"Thank goodness it has gone out of fashion!\"\n\n\"But how can you be _sure_ they're cannibals?\" Stanton asked. \"Your\nargument sounds logical enough, but you can't be basing your theory on\nthat alone.\"\n\n\"True! True!\" Yoritomo jabbed the air twice with a rapid forefinger.\n\"Evidence for such a theory would be most welcome, would it not? Very\nwell, I give you the evidence. He eats human beings, our Nipe.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make him a cannibal,\" Stanton objected.\n\n\"Not _strictly_, perhaps. But consider. The Nipe is not a monster. He is\nnot a criminal. No. He is a gentleman. He always behaves as a gentleman.\nHe is shipwrecked on an alien planet. Around him, he sees evidence in\nprofusion that ours is a technological society. But that is a\ncontradiction! A paradox!\n\n\"For _we_ are not civilized! No! We are not rational! We are not sane!\nWe do not obey the Laws; we do not perform the Rituals. We are animals.\nApparently intelligent animals, but animals nevertheless. How can this\nbe?\n\n\"_Ha!_ says the Nipe to himself. These animals must be ruled over by\nReal People. It is the only explanation. Not so?\"\n\n\"Colonel Mannheim mentioned that,\" Stanton said. \"Are you implying that\nthe Nipe thinks there are other Nipes around, running the world from\nsecret hideouts, like the villains in a Fu Manchu novel?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Yoritomo, laughing. \"The Nipe is not at all incapable\nof learning something new. In point of fact, he is quite good at it, as\nwitness the fact that he has learned many Earth languages. He picked up\nRussian in less than eight months simply by listening and observing.\nLike our own race, his undoubtedly evolved a great many languages during\nthe beginnings of its progress--when there were many tribes, separated\nand out of communication with each other. It would not surprise me to\nfind that most of these languages have survived and that our distressed\nastronaut knows them all. A new language would not bother him in the\nleast.\n\n\"Nor would strangely shaped intelligent beings make him unhappy. His\nrace should be aware, by now, that such things must exist. But it is\nvery likely that he equates _true_ intelligence with technology, and I\ndo not think it likely that he has ever met a race higher than the\nbarbarian level before. Such races were not, of course, human--by his\ndefinition. They showed possibilities, perhaps, but they had not by any\nmeans evolved far enough. And, considering the time span involved in\ntheir own progress toward a technological civilization, it is not at all\nunlikely that the Nipe thinks of technology as something that evolves in\na race in the same way that intelligence does--or the body itself.\n\n\"So it would not surprise him to find that the Real People of this\nsystem were humanoid in shape instead of--ah--Nipoid? A bad word, but it\nwill do for the nonce. To find Real People of a different shape is\nsomething new, but he can absorb it because it does not contradict\nanything he _knows_.\n\n\"_But--!_ Any truly intelligent being that did not obey the Law and\nfollow the Ritual _would_ be a contradiction in terms. For our Nipe has\nno notion of a Real Person without those characteristics. Without those\ncharacteristics, technology is, of course, utterly impossible. Since he\nsees technology all around him, it follows that there must be Real\nPeople around somewhere that have those characteristics. Anything else\nis unthinkable.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that you're building an awfully involved theory out of\npretty flimsy stuff,\" Stanton said.\n\nYoritomo shook his head. \"Not at all. Not at all. Every scrap and shred\nof evidence we have points toward it. Why, do you suppose, does the Nipe\nconscientiously devour his victims, often risking his own safety to do\nso? Why do you suppose he never uses any weapon but his own hands to\nkill with?\"\n\nYoritomo leaned forward and speared out at Stanton with a long, bony\nforefinger. \"Why? To tell the Real People that he is a gentleman!\"\n\nHe sat back with a satisfied smile and puffed complacently at his pipe,\nremaining silent while Bart Stanton considered his last remark.\n\n\"Just one thing,\" Stanton said after a minute. \"It seems to me that he\nwould be able to judge that some races have different Laws and Rituals\nthan he does. Wouldn't they have a science comparable to our\nanthropology?\"\n\nYoritomo grinned. \"Nipology, shall we say? Well, he might, but it would\nnot tell him what our anthropology tells us.\n\n\"Consider. How have we learned much of our knowledge of the early\nhistory of Man? By the study of ritual-taboo cultures. The so-called\n'primitive' cultures. It is from these tribes that we have learned the\nmultifarious ways in which a group of human beings can evolve a culture\nand a society. But does the Nipe have any such other tribes to study?\"\n\n\"Why wouldn't he?\" Stanton asked.\n\n\"Because there are none,\" Yoritomo said. \"How could there be? Consider\nagain. Once a race has evolved a fairly high technological level, it is\ncapable of wiping out races which have not achieved that level. If the\ntechnologically advanced tribe is still at the ritual-taboo level, it\nwill consider that all tribes which do not use the same Laws and Rituals\nas it does must be animals--dangerous animals that must be wiped out.\nTake a look at the history of our own race. In a few short centuries, we\nfind that the technologically advanced civilization and culture of\nRenaissance Europe has spread over the whole globe. By military,\neconomic, and religious conquest, it has, in effect, westernized the\nmajority of Mankind.\n\n\"The same process would take place on the Nipe's world, only more\nthoroughly. The weaker tribes would vanish, the stronger would\namalgamate.\"\n\n\"That process would take a lot of time,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"Indeed! Oh, yes, indeed,\" Yoritomo agreed. \"But they have had the time,\nhave they not? Eh? What Western European Man has partially achieved in\nless than a thousand years, surely the Nipe equivalent could have\nachieved in ten thousand thousand. Eh?\"\n\n\"But I'd think that the Nipe would have realized, after ten years, that\nthere is no such race of Real People,\" Stanton said. \"He's had access to\nour records and books and such things. Or does he reject them all as\nlies?\"\n\n\"Possibly he would, if he could read them,\" Yoritomo said. \"Did I not\nsay he was illiterate?\"\n\n\"You mean he's learned to speak our languages, but not to read them?\"\n\nThe psychologist smiled broadly. \"Your statement is accurate, my friend,\nbut incomplete. It is my opinion that the Nipe is incapable of reading\nany written language whatever. The concept does not exist in his mind,\nexcept vaguely.\"\n\nStanton closed one eye and gave Yoritomo the glance askance. \"Aw, come\n_awwn_, George! A technological race without a written language? That's\nimpossible!\"\n\n\"Ah, no. No, it isn't. Ask yourself: What need has a race with a perfect\nmemory for written records? At least, in the sense that we think of\nthem. Certainly not to remember things. What would a Nipe need with a\nmemorandum book or a diary? All of their history and all of their\ntechnology exists in the collective mind of the race.\n\n\"Think, for a moment, of their history. If it is somewhat analogous to\nhuman history--and, as we have seen, there is reason to believe that\nthis is so--then we can, in a way, trace the development of writing.\nWe--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" Stanton held up his hand. \"I think I see what you're\ndriving at.\"\n\n\"Ah. So?\" Yoritomo nodded. \"Very well. Then _you_ expound.\"\n\n\"I can give it to you in two sentences,\" Stanton said. \"One: Their first\nwriting was probably pictographic and was learned only by a select\npriestly class. Two: It still is.\"\n\n\"Ahhhh!\" Yoritomo's eyes lit up. \"Admirable! Most admirable! And\nsuccinctly put, too. And, to top it off, almost precisely correct. That\nis what happened here on Earth; are we wrong in assuming that such may\nhave happened elsewhere in the Universe? (Remembering always, my dear\nBart, that we must not make the mistake of thinking like our friend, the\nNipe, and assuming that everybody else in the Universe has to be like us\nin all things.)\n\n\"You are correct. That is why I hedged when I said he was _almost_\nilliterate. There is a possibility that a written symbology does exist\nfor Nipes. But it is used almost entirely for ritualistic purposes, it\nis pictographical in form, and is known only to a very few. For others\nto learn it would be taboo.\n\n\"Remember, I said that there is only one society, one culture remaining\non the Nipe planet. And remember that history is a very late development\nin our own culture, just as written language is. One important event in\nevery ten centuries of Nipe history would still give a Nipe historian\nten thousand events to remember just since the invention of the steam\nengine. What, then, does Nipe history become? A series of folk chants,\nof _chansons de geste_.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Stanton asked. \"If they have perfect memories, why would\nhistories be distorted?\"\n\n\"Time, my dear boy. Time.\" Yoritomo spread his hands in a gesture of\nfutility. \"When one has a few million years of history to learn, it\n_must_ become distorted, even in a race with a perfect memory.\nOtherwise, no individual would have a chance to learn it all in a single\nlifetime, even a lifetime of five hundred years, much less to pass that\nknowledge on to another. So only the most important events are reported.\nAnd that means that each historian must also be an editor. He must\nexcise those portions which he considers unimportant.\"\n\n\"But wouldn't that very limitation induce them to record history?\"\nStanton asked. \"Right there is your inducement to use a written\nlanguage.\"\n\nYoritomo looked at him with wide-eyed innocence. \"Why? _What good is\nhistory?_\"\n\n\"Ohhh,\" said Stanton. \"I see.\"\n\n\"Certainly you do,\" Yoritomo said firmly. \"Of what use is history to the\nritual-taboo culture? Only to record what is to be done. And, with a\nmemory that can _know_ what is to be done, of what use is a historian,\nexcept to remember the _important_ things. No ritual-taboo culture looks\nupon history as we do. Only the doings of the great are recorded. All\nelse must be edited out. Thus, while the memory of the individual may\nbe, and _is_, perfect, the memory of the race is not. _But they don't\nknow that!_\"\n\n\"What about communications, then?\" Stanton asked. \"What did they use\nbefore they invented radio?\"\n\n\"Couriers,\" Yoritomo said. \"And, possibly, written messages from one\npriestly scribe to another. That last, by the way, has probably survived\nin a ritualistic form. When an officer is appointed to a post, let's\nsay, he may get a formal paper that says so. The Nipes may use symbols\nto signify rank and so on. They must have a symbology for the\ncalibration of scientific instruments.\n\n\"But none of these requires the complexity of a written language. I dare\nsay our use of it is quite baffling to him.\n\n\"For teaching purposes, it is quite unnecessary. Look at what television\nand such have done in our own civilization. With such tools as that at\nhand--recordings and pictures--it is possible to teach a person a great\nmany things without ever teaching him to read. A Nipe certainly wouldn't\nneed any aid for calculation, would he? We humans must use a piece of\npaper to multiply two ten-digit numbers together, but that's because our\nmemories are faulty. A Nipe has no need for such aids.\"\n\n\"Are you really positive of all this, George?\" Stanton asked.\n\nYoritomo shrugged. \"How can we be absolutely positive at this stage of\nthe game? Eh? Our evidence is sketchy, I admit. It is not as solidly\nbased as our other reconstructions of his background, but it appears\nthat he thinks of symbols as being unable to convey much information.\nThe pattern for his raids, for instance, indicates that his knowledge of\nthe materials he wants and their locations comes from vocal\nsources--television advertising, eavesdropping on shipping orders, and\nso on. In other words, he cases the joint by ear. If he could understand\nwritten information, his job would be much easier. He could find his\nmaterials much more quickly and easily. And, too, we have never seen him\neither read a word or write one. From this evidence, we are fairly\ncertain that he can neither read nor write any terrestrial language--or\neven his own.\" He spread his hands again. \"As I said, it is not proof.\"\n\n\"No,\" Stanton agreed, \"but I must admit that the whole thing makes for\nsome very interesting speculation, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Very interesting, indeed.\" Yoritomo folded his hands in his lap, smiled\nseraphically, and looked at the ceiling. \"In fact, my friend, we are now\nso positive of our knowledge of the Nipe's mind that we are prepared to\nenter into the next phase of our program.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Stanton distinctly felt the back of his neck prickle.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Yoritomo. \"Mr. Martin feels that if we wait much longer, we\nmay run into the danger of giving the Nipe enough time to complete his\nwork on his communicator.\" He looked at Stanton and chuckled, but there\nwas no humor in his short laugh. \"We would not wish our friend, the\nNipe, to bring his relatives into this little tussle, would we, Bart?\"\n\n\"That's been our deadline all along,\" Bart said levelly. \"The object all\nalong has been to let the Nipe work without hindrance as long as he did\nnot actually produce a communicator that would--as you put it--bring his\nrelatives into the tussle. Have things changed?\"\n\n\"They have,\" Yoritomo acknowledged. \"Why wouldn't they? We have been\nworking toward that as a _final_ deadline. If it appeared that the Nipe\nwere actually about to contact his confederates out there somewhere, we\nwould be forced to act immediately, of course. Plan Beta would go into\neffect. But we don't want that, do we?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Stanton. \"No.\" He was well aware what a terrible loss it\nwould be for humanity if Plan Beta went into effect. The Nipe would have\nto be literally blasted out of his cozy little nest.\n\n\"No, of course not.\" Yoritomo chuckled again, with as little mirth as he\nhad before. \"Within a very short while, if we are correct, we shall,\nwith your help, arrest the most feared arch-criminal that Earth has ever\nknown. I dare say that the public will be extremely happy to hear of his\ndeath, and I know that the rest of us will be happy to know that he will\nnever kill again.\"\n\nStanton suddenly saw the fateful day for which he had been so carefully\nprepared and trained looming terrifyingly large in the immediate future.\n\n\"How soon?\" he asked in an oddly choked voice.\n\n\"Within days.\" Yoritomo lowered his eyes from the ceiling and looked\ninto Stanton's face with a mild, bland expression.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he said, \"the propaganda phase begins. We will announce to\nthe world that the great detective, Stanley Martin, has come to Earth to\nrid us of the Nipe.\"\n\n\n\n\n_[20]_\n\n\nThe arrival of the great Stanley Martin was a three-day wonder in the\npublic news channels. His previous exploits were recounted, with\nembellishments, several times during the next seventy-two hours. The\n\"arrival\" itself was very carefully staged. A special ship belonging to\nthe World Police brought him in, and he was met by four Government\nofficials in civilian clothes. The entire affair was covered live by\nnews cameras. No one on Earth suspected that he had been on Earth for\nweeks before; a few _knew_ it, but it never even occurred to the rest.\n\nLater, a special interview was arranged. Philip Quinn, a news\ninterviewer who was noted for his deferential attitude toward those whom\nhe had the privilege of interviewing, was chosen for the job.\n\nStanley Martin's dynamic, forceful personality completely overshadowed\nQuinn.\n\nBut in spite of all the publicity, not one word, not one hint about the\nmethod by which Stanley Martin intended to bring the Nipe in was\nreleased. There were all kinds of speculations, ranging from the\nmystically sublime to the broadly comical. One self-styled archbishop of\na California nut cult declared that Martin was a saint appointed by God\nto exorcise the Demon Nipe that had been plaguing Mankind and that the\nMillennium was therefore due at any moment. He was, he said, sending\nStanley Martin a sealed letter which contained a special exorcism prayer\nthat would do the job very nicely. Why hadn't he used it himself?\nBecause if anyone other than a saint or an angel used it, it would\nbackfire on the user and destroy him. Naturally the archbishop did not\nclaim himself to be a saint, but he knew that Martin was because he had\nplainly seen the halo around the detective's head when he saw him on TV.\n\nAn inventor in Palermo, Sicily, solemnly declared that he had sent\nStanley Martin the plans for a device that would render him invisible to\nthe Nipe and therefore make the Nipe easy to conquer. No, there was no\ndanger that the device might fall into the wrong hands and be used by\nhuman criminals, since it did not render a person invisible to human\neyes, only to Nipe eyes.\n\nThe first item was played up big in the newscasts. The second was\nquashed--fast!--for the very simple reason that the Nipe just might have\nbelieved it.\n\nOne note throbbed in the background of every interview with responsible\npersons. It was the unobtrusive note of a soft clarinet played in a\ngreat symphony, all the more telling because it was never played loudly\nor insistently, but it was there all the same. Whenever the question of\nthe Nipe's actual whereabouts came up, the note seemed to ring a trifle\nmore clearly, but never more loudly. That single throbbing note was the\nimpression given by everyone who was interviewed, or who expressed any\nviews on the subject, that the Nipe was hiding somewhere in the\nAmazonian jungles of South America. It was the last place on Earth that\nhad still not been thoroughly explored, and it seemed to be the only\nplace that the Nipe could hide.\n\nOnly a small handful of the vast array of people who were dispensing\nthis carefully tailored propaganda knew what was going on. More than\nninety-nine percent of the newsmen involved in the affair thought they\nwere honestly giving the news as they saw it, and none of them saw the\ninvisible but very powerful hand of Stanley Martin shifting the news\njust enough to give it the bias he wanted.\n\nThe comedians on the entertainment programs let the whole story alone\nfor the most part. There were no clever skits, no farcical takeoffs on\nthe subject of Stanley Martin and the Nipe. One comedian, who was\nplaying the part of a henpecked husband, did remark: \"If my wife gets\nany meaner, I'm going to send Stan Martin after _her_!\" But it didn't\nget much of a laugh. And the Government organization had nothing to do\nwith that kind of censorship; it was self-imposed. Every one of the\nreally great comics recognized, either consciously or subconsciously,\nthat the Nipe was not a subject for humor. Such jokes would have made\nthem about as popular as the Borscht Circuit comedian who told a funny\nstory about Dachau in 1946.\n\nAside from the subtle coloring given it by the small, Mannheim-trained\ngroup of propaganda experts, the news went out straight.\n\nThe detective himself, after that one single interview, vanished from\nsight. No one knew where he was, though, again, there were all kinds of\nspeculations, all of them erroneous. Actually, he was a carefully\nguarded and willing prisoner in a suite in one of the big hotels in\nGovernment City.\n\nOn the fourth day, the big operation began without fanfare. The actual\nmaneuvering to capture the alien that had terrorized a planet began\nshortly after noon.\n\nAt a few minutes before three that afternoon, the man whom the world\nknew as Stanley Martin suddenly suffered a dizzy spell and nearly\nfainted.\n\nThen, almost like a child, he began to weep.\n\n\n\n\n_FINAL INTERLUDE_\n\n\nColonel Walther Mannheim said: \"It will take five years, Stanton.\"\n\nHe was looking at the young man seated in one of the three chairs in the\nsmall, comfortable room. There was a clublike atmosphere about the room,\nbut none of the three men were relaxed.\n\n\"Five years?\" said the young man. He looked at the third man.\n\nDr. Farnsworth nodded. \"More or less. More if it's a partial\nfailure--less if it's a complete failure.\"\n\n\"Then there _is_ a chance of failure?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"There is always a chance of failure in any major surgical undertaking,\"\nDr. Farnsworth said. \"Even in the most routine cases, things can go\nwrong. We're only men, Mr. Stanton. We're neither magicians nor gods.\"\n\n\"I know that, Doctor,\" the young man said. \"Nobody's perfect, and I\ndon't expect perfection. Can you give me a--an estimate on the\nchances?\"\n\n\"I can't even give you any kind of guess,\" said Farnsworth. He smiled\nrather grimly. \"So far, we have had no failures. Our mortality rate is a\nflat zero. We have never lost a patient because we've never had one. As\nI told you, this will be the first time the operation has ever been\nperformed on a human being. Or, rather,\" he corrected himself, \"I should\nsay series of operations. This is not one single--er--cut-and-suture\njob, like an appendectomy.\"\n\n\"All right, then, call it a series of operations,\" the young man said.\n\"I assume each of them has been performed individually?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. Some of them have never been performed on any human being\nsimply because they require not only special conditions, but they\nrequire that the steps leading up to them have already been performed.\"\n\n\"You don't make things sound very rosy, Doctor.\"\n\n\"I'm not trying to. I'm trying to give you the facts. Personally, I\nthink we have a better than ninety percent chance of success. I wouldn't\ntry it if I thought otherwise. With modern mathematical methods of\nanalyzing medical theory, we can predict success for such an intricate\nseries of operations. We can predict what will happen when massive doses\nof hormones and enzymes and such are used. But medicine still remains\nlargely an art in spite of all that.\n\n\"In parallel operations, performed on primates, our results were largely\nsuccessful. But remember that not even every human being has the genetic\nstructure necessary to undergo this particular treatment, and a monkey's\ngene structure is quite different from yours or mine.\"\n\n\"I'll just ask you one question,\" the young man said firmly. \"If _you_\nwere being asked to undergo this treatment, would you do it?\"\n\nDr. Farnsworth didn't hesitate. \"All things considered, yes, I would.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'All things considered'?\"\n\n\"The very fact that the Nipe exists, and that this is the only method of\ndealing with him that is even remotely possible would certainly\ninfluence my opinion,\" Farnsworth said. \"I might not be so quick to go\nthrough it, frankly, if it were not for the fact that the future of the\nentire human race would depend upon my decision.\" He paused, then added:\n\"I would hesitate to go through with it if there were no Nipe threat,\nnot because I would be afraid that the operations might fail, but\nbecause of what I would be afterward.\"\n\n\"Um. Yes.\" The young man caught his lower lip between his teeth and\nthought for a moment. \"Yes, I see what you mean. Being a lone superman\nin a world of ordinary people mightn't be so pleasant.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim, who had been sitting silently during the discussion\nbetween the two men, said: \"Look, Stanton, I know this is tough.\nActually, it's a lot tougher on you than it is on your brother, because\n_you_ have to make the decision. _He_ can't. But I want you to keep it\nin mind that there's nothing compulsory in this. Nobody's trying to\nforce you to do anything.\"\n\nThere was a touch of bitterness in the young man's smile as he looked at\nthe colonel. \"No. You merely remind me of the fact and leave the rest to\nmy sense of duty.\"\n\nColonel Mannheim, recognizing the slightly altered quotation, returned\nhis smile and gave him the next line. \"'Your sense of duty!'\"\n\nThe bitterness vanished, and the young man's smile became a grin.\n\"'Don't put it on that footing!'\" he quoted back in a melodramatic\nvoice. \"'As I was merciful to you just now, be merciful to me! I implore\nyou not to insist on the letter of your bond just as the cup of\nhappiness is at my lips!'\"\n\n\"'We insist on nothing,'\" returned the colonel; \"'we content ourselves\nwith pointing out _your duty_.'\"\n\nDr. Farnsworth had no notion of what the two of them were talking about,\nbut he kept silent as he noticed the tension fading.\n\n\"'Well, you have appealed to my sense of duty,'\" the young man\ncontinued, \"'and my duty is all too clear. I abhor your infamous\ncalling; I shudder at the thought that I have ever been mixed up with\nit; but duty is before all--at any price I will do my duty.'\"\n\n\"'Bravely spoken!'\" said the colonel. \"'Come, you are one of us once\nmore.'\"\n\n\"'Lead on. I follow.'\"\n\nAnd the two of them broke out in laughter while Farnsworth looked on in\ntotal incomprehension. His was not the kind of mind that could face a\ngrim situation with a laugh.\n\nEven after he quit laughing, the smile remained on the young man's face.\n\"All right, Colonel, you win. We'll go through with it, Martin and I.\"\n\n\"Good!\" Mannheim said warmly. \"Do you have the papers, Dr. Farnsworth?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" Farnsworth said, opening a briefcase that was lying on the\ntable. He was glad to be back in the conversation again. He took out a\nthick sheaf of papers and spread them on the table. Then he handed the\nyoung man a pen. \"You'll have to sign at the bottom of each sheet,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe young man picked up the papers and read through them carefully. Then\nhe looked up at Farnsworth. \"They seem to be in order. Uh--about Martin.\nYou know what's the matter with him--I mean, aside from the radiation.\nDo you think he'll be able to handle his part of the job after--after\nthe operations?\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure he will. The operations, plus the therapy we'll give\nhim afterward should put him in fine shape.\"\n\n\"Well.\" He looked thoughtful. \"Five more years. And then I'll have the\ntwin brother that I never really had at all. Somehow that part of it\njust doesn't really register, I guess.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Stanton,\" said Dr. Farnsworth. \"We have a complex\nenough job ahead of us without your worrying in the bargain. We'll want\nyour mind perfectly relaxed. You have your own ordeal to undergo.\"\n\n\"Thanks for reminding me,\" the young man said, but there was a smile on\nhis face when he said it. He looked at the release forms again. \"All\nnice and legal, huh? Well ...\" He hesitated for a moment, then he took\nthe pen and wrote _Bartholomew Stanton_ in a firm, clear hand.\n\n\n\n\n_[21]_\n\n\nCaptain Davidson Greer sat in a chair before an array of TV screens, his\ngray-green eyes watchful. In the center of one of the screens, the\nNipe's image sat immobile, surrounded by the paraphernalia in his hidden\nnest. Other screens showed various sections of the long tunnel that led\nsouth from the opening in the northern end of the island. At the\ncaptain's fingertips was a bank of controls that would allow him to\nswitch from one pickup to another if necessary, so that he could see\nanything anywhere in the tunnels. He hoped that wouldn't be necessary.\nHe did not want any of the action to take place anywhere but in the\nplaces where it was expected--but he was prepared for alterations in the\nplan. In other rooms, nearly a hundred other men were linked into the\nspecial controls that allowed them to operate the little rat spies that\nscuttled through the underground darkness, and the captain's system\nwould allow him to see through the eyes of any one of those rats at an\ninstant's notice.\n\nThe screen which he was watching at the moment, however, was not\nconnected with an underground pickup. It was linked with a pickup in the\nbottom of a basketball-sized sphere driven by a small inertial engine\nthat held the sphere hovering in the air above the game sanctuary on the\nnorthern tip of Manhattan Island. In the screen, he had an aerial view\nof the grassy, rocky mounds where the earth hid the shattered and\npartially melted ruins of long-collapsed buildings. In the center of the\nscreen was a bird's-eye view of a man holding a rifle. He was walking\nslowly, picking his way carefully along the bottom of the shallow gully\nthat had once been upper Broadway.\n\n\"Barbell,\" the captain said. A throat microphone picked up the words and\ntransmitted them to the ears of the man in the screen. \"Barbell, this is\nBarhop. There are no wild animals within sight, but remember, we can't\nsee everything from up here, so keep your eyes open.\"\n\n\"Right, Barhop,\" said a rather muffled voice in the captain's ear.\n\n\"Fine. And if you do meet up with anything, shoot to kill.\" There were\nplenty of wild animals in the game sanctuary--some of them dangerous.\nNot all of the inhabitants of the Bronx Zoological Gardens had been\nkilled on that day when the sun bomb fell. Being farther north, they had\nhad better protection, and some of them, later, had wandered southward\nto the island. Captain Greer knew perfectly well that Stanton,\nbare-handed, was more than a match for a leopard or a lion, but he\ndidn't want Stanton to tire himself fighting with an animal. The rifle\nwould most likely never be used; it was merely another precaution.\n\nIt would have been possible, and perhaps simpler, to have taken Stanton\nto the opening by flyer, but that would have created other\ncomplications. Traffic rules forbade flyers to go over the game\nsanctuary at any altitude less than one thousand feet. One flyer, going\nin low, would have attracted the attention of the traffic police, and\nStanley Martin wanted no attention whatever drawn to this area. Even the\nprocedure of instructing the traffic officers to ignore one flyer would\nhave attracted more attention than he wanted. They would have remembered\nthose instructions afterward.\n\nStanton walked.\n\nCaptain Greer's eye caught something at the edge of the screen. It moved\ntoward the center as the floating eye moved with Stanton.\n\n\"Barbell,\" the captain said, \"there's a deer ahead of you. Just keep\nmoving.\"\n\nStanton rounded the corner of a pile of masonry. He could see the animal\nnow himself. The deer stared at the intruder for a few seconds, then\nbounded away with long, graceful leaps.\n\n\"Magnificent animal.\" It was Stanton's voice, very low. The remark\nwasn't directed toward anyone in particular. Captain Greer didn't\nanswer.\n\nThe captain lit a cigarette and leaned back in his chair, his eyes on\nthe screens. The Nipe still sat, unmoving. He was apparently in one of\nhis \"sleep\" states. The captain wasn't sure that that was the blessing\nthat it might have seemed. He had no way of knowing how much external\ndisturbance it would take to \"wake\" the Nipe, and as long as he was\nsitting quietly, the chances were greater that he would hear movement in\nthe tunnel. If he were active, his senses might be more alert, but he\nwould also be distracted by his own actions and the noises he made\nhimself.\n\nIt didn't matter, the captain decided. One way was as good as another in\nthis case. The point was to get Stanton into an advantageous position\nbefore the Nipe knew he was anywhere around.\n\nHe looked back at the image of Stanton, a black-clad figure in a\nflexible, tough, skin-tight suit. The Nipe would have a hard time biting\nthrough that artificial hide, but it gave Stanton as much freedom as if\nhe'd been naked.\n\nStanton knew where he was going. He had studied maps of the area, and\nhad been taken on a vicarious tour of the route by means of the very\nflying eye that was watching him now. But things look different from the\nground than from the air, and no amount of map study will familiarize a\nperson with terrain as completely as an actual personal survey.\n\nStanton paused, and Captain Greer heard his voice. \"Barhop, this is\nBarbell. Those are the cliffs up ahead, aren't they?\"\n\n\"That's right, Barbell. You go up that slope to your left. The opening\nis in that pile of rock at the base of the cliff.\"\n\n\"They're higher than I'd thought,\" Stanton commented. Then he started\nwalking again.\n\nThe tunnel entrance he was heading for had once been a wide opening,\ndrilled laterally into the side of the cliff, and big enough to allow\neasy access to the tunnels, so that the passengers of those old\nunderground trains could get to the platforms where they stopped. But\nthe sun bomb had changed all that. The concussion had shaken loose rock\nat the top of the cliff and a minor avalanche had obliterated all\nindications of the tunnel's existence, except for one small, narrow\nopening near the top of what had once been a wide hole in the face of\nthe cliff.\n\nStanton walked slowly toward the spot until he was finally at the base\nof the slope of rock created by that long-ago avalanche. \"Up there?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Captain Greer.\n\n\"I think I'll leave the rifle here, Barhop,\" Stanton said. \"No point in\ncarrying it up the slope.\"\n\n\"Right. Put it in those bushes to your left. They'll conceal it, won't\nthey?\"\n\n\"I think so. Yeah.\" Stanton hid the rifle and then began making his way\nup the talus slope.\n\nCaptain Greer flipped a switch. \"Team One! He's coming in. Are those\nalarms deactivated?\"\n\n\"All okay, Barhop,\" said a voice. \"This is Leader One. I'll meet him at\nthe hole.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Captain Greer reversed the switch again. \"Are you ready,\nBarbell?\"\n\nStanton looked into the dark hole. It was hardly big enough to crawl\nthrough, and ended in a seeming infinity of blackness. He took the\nspecial goggles from the case at his belt and put them on. Inside the\nhole, he saw a single rat, staring at him with beady eyes.\n\n\"I'm ready to go in, Barhop,\" Stanton said.\n\nHe got down on his hands and knees and began to crawl through the narrow\ntunnel. Ahead of him, the rat turned and began to lead the way.\n\n\n\n\n_[22]_\n\n\nThe big tunnel inside the cliff was long and black, and the air was\nstale and thick with the stench of rodents. Stanton stood still for a\nminute, stretching his muscles. Crawling through that cramped little\nopening had not been easy. He looked around him, trying to probe the\nluminescent gloom that the goggles he wore brought to his eyes.\n\nThe tunnel stretched out before him--on and on. Around him was the\nsmell of viciousness and death. Ahead ...\n\n_It goes on to infinity_, Stanton thought, _ending at last at zero_.\n\nThe rat paused and looked back, waiting for him to follow.\n\n\"Okay,\" Stanton muttered. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe rat led him down the long tunnel, deep into the cliffside, until at\nlast they came to a stairway that led downward into the long tunnels\nwhere the trains had once run. They came to the platform where\npassengers had once waited for those trains. Four feet below the edge of\nthe platform were the rusted tracks that had once borne those trains.\n\nHe lowered himself over the edge to stand on the rail.\n\n\"Barbell,\" said a voice in his ear, \"Barhop here. Do you read?\"\n\nIt was the barest whisper, picked up by the antennas in his shoes from\nthe steel rail that ran along the floor of the dark tunnel.\n\n\"Read you, Barhop.\"\n\n\"Move out, then. You've got a long stroll to go.\"\n\nStanton started walking, keeping his feet near the rail, in case Greer\nwanted to call again. As he walked, he could feel the slight motion of\nthe skin-tight woven suit that he wore rubbing gently against his skin.\n\nAnd he could hear the scratching patter of the rats.\n\nMostly they stayed away from him, avoiding the strange being that had\ninvaded their underground realm, but he could see them hiding in corners\nand scurrying along the sides of the tunnels, going about their\nunfathomable rodent business.\n\nAround him, six rat-like remote-control robots moved with him, shifting\ntheir pattern constantly as they patrolled his moving figure.\n\nFar ahead, he knew, other rat robots were stationed, watching and\nwaiting, ready to deactivate the Nipe's detection devices at just the\nright moment. Behind him, another horde moved forward to turn the\ndevices on again.\n\nIt had, he knew, taken the technicians a long time to learn how to shut\noff those detectors without giving the alarm to the Nipe's instruments.\n\nThere were nearly a hundred men in on the operation, controlling the\nrobot rats or watching the hidden cameras that spied upon the Nipe.\nNearly a hundred. And every single one of them was safe.\n\nThey were all outside the tunnel and far away. They were with Stanton\nonly by proxy. They could not die here in this stinking hole, no matter\nwhat happened. But Stanton could.\n\nThere was no help for it, no other way it could be done. Stanton had to\ngo in person. A full-sized robot proxy might be stronger, although not\nfaster unless Stanton was at the controls, than the Nipe. But the Nipe\nwould be able to tell that the thing was a robot, and he would simply\ndestroy it with one of his weapons. A remote-control robot could never\nget close enough to the Nipe to do any good.\n\n\"We do not know positively,\" Dr. Yoritomo had said, \"whether he would\nrecognize it as a robot or not, but his instruments would show the metal\neasily enough, and his eyes would be able to tell him that the machine\nwas not covered with human skin. The rats are small enough so that they\ncan be made mostly of plastic, and they are covered with real rat hides.\nIn addition, our friend, the Nipe, is used to seeing them around. But a\nhuman-sized robot? Ah, no. Never.\"\n\nSo Stanton had to go in person, walking southward along the tracks,\nthrough the miles of blackness that led to the nest of the Nipe.\n\nOverhead was Government City.\n\nHe had looked out upon those streets only the night before, and he knew\nthat only a short distance away there was an entirely different world.\n\nSomewhere up there, his brother was waiting, after having run the gamut\nof publicity. He was a celebrity. \"Stanley Martin, the greatest\ndetective in the Solar System,\" they'd called him. Fine stuff, that.\nStanton wondered what the asteroids were like. What would it be like to\nlive out in space, where a man still had plenty of space to move around\nin and could fashion his life to suit himself? Maybe there would be a\nplace in the asteroids for a hopped-up superman.\n\nOr maybe there would only be a place here, beneath the streets of\nGovernment City, for a dead superman.\n\n_Not if I can help it_, Stanton thought with a grim smile.\n\nThe walking seemed to take forever in one way, but, in another way,\nStanton didn't mind it. He had a lot to think over. Seeing his brother's\nimage on the TV had been unnerving yesterday, but today he felt as\nthough everything had been all right all along.\n\nHis memory was still a long way from being complete, and it probably\nalways would be, he thought. He could still scarcely recall any real\nmemories of a boy named Martin Stanton, but--and he smiled a little at\nthe thought--he knew more about him than his brother did, even so.\n\nIt made very little difference now. That Martin Stanton was gone. In\neffect, he had been demolished--what little there had been of him--and a\nnew structure had been built on the old foundation.\n\nAnd yet, it was highly probable that the new structure was very like\nthat that would have developed naturally if the accident so early in\nMartin Stanton's life had never occurred.\n\nStanton kept walking. There was a timeless feeling about his march\nthrough the depths of the ground, as though every step through the\nblackness was exactly like every other step, and it was only the same\nstep over and over again.\n\nHe skirted a pile of rubble on his right. There had been a station here,\nonce; the street above had caved in and filled it with brick, concrete,\ncobblestones, and steel scrap, and then it had been sealed over when\nGovernment City was built.\n\nA part of one wall was still unbroken, though. A sign built of tile said\n125TH STREET, he knew, although it was hard to make it out in the dim\nglow. He kept on walking, ignoring the rats that scampered over the\nrubble.\n\nA mile or so farther on, he whispered: \"Barbell to Barhop. How's\neverything going?\"\n\n\"Barhop to Barbell,\" came the answer. \"No sign of any activity from\nTarget. So far, none of the alarms have been triggered.\"\n\n\"What's he doing?\" Stanton whispered. It seemed only right to keep his\nvoice low, although he was fairly certain that his voice would not carry\nto the Nipe, even through these echoing tunnels. He was still miles\naway.\n\n\"He's still sitting motionless,\" said Captain Greer. \"Thinking, I\nsuppose. Or sleeping. It's hard to tell.\"\n\n\"All right. Let me know if he starts moving, will you?\"\n\n\"Will do.\"\n\n_Poor unsuspecting beastie_, Stanton thought. _Ten long years of hard\nwork, of feeling secure in his little nest, and within a very short time\nhe's going to get the shock of his life._\n\nOr maybe not. There was no way of knowing what kind of shocks the Nipe\nhad taken in the course of his life, Stanton thought. There was no way\nof knowing whether the Nipe was even capable of feeling anything like\nshock, as a matter of fact.\n\nIt was odd, he thought, that he should feel a strong kinship toward both\nthe Nipe and his brother in such similar ways. He had never met the\nNipe, and his brother was only a dim picture in his old memories, but\nthey were both very well known to him. Certainly they were better known\nto him than he was to them.\n\nAnd yet, seeing his brother's face on the TV screen, hearing his voice,\nwatching the way he moved about, watching the changing expressions on\nhis face, had been a tremendously moving experience. Not until that\nmoment, he thought, had he really known himself.\n\nMeeting him face to face would be much easier now, but it would still be\na scene highly charged with emotional tension.\n\nHis foot kicked something that rattled and rolled away from him. He\nstopped, freezing in his tracks, looking downward, trying to pierce the\ndully glowing gloom. The thing he had kicked was a human skull.\n\nHe relaxed and began walking again.\n\nThere were plenty of human bones down here. Mannheim had told him that\nthe tunnels had been used as air-raid shelters when the sun bomb had hit\nthe island during the Holocaust. Men, women, and children by the\nthousands had crowded underground after the warning had come--and they\nhad died by the thousands when the bright, hot, deadly gases had roared\ndown the ventilators and stairwells.\n\nThere were even caches of canned goods down here, some of them still\nperfectly sealed after all this time. The hordes of rats, wiser than\nthey knew, had chewed at them, exposing the steel beneath the thin tin\nplate. And, after a while, oxidation would weaken the can to the point\nwhere some lucky rat could gnaw through the rusty spot and find himself\na meal. Then he would move the empty can aside and begin gnawing at the\nnext in line. He couldn't get through the steel, but he would scratch\nthe tin off, and the cycle would begin again. Later, another rat would\nfind that can weak enough to bite through. It kept the rats fed almost\nas well as an automatic machine might have.\n\nThe tunnel before him was an endless monochromatic world that was both\nartificial and natural. Here was a neatly squared-off mosaic of ceramic\ntile that was obviously man-made; over there, on a little hillock of\nearth, squatted a colony of fat mushrooms. In several places he had to\nskirt little pools of dark, stagnant water; twice he had to climb over\nlong heaps of crumbling rust that had once been trains of subway cars.\n\nHe kept moving--one man, alone, walking through the dark toward a\nsuperhuman monster that had terrorized Earth for a decade.\n\nA drug that would knock out the Nipe would have been very useful, but to\nsynthesize such a drug would have required a greater knowledge of the\nbiochemical processes of the Nipe than any human scientist had. The same\napplied to anesthetic gases, or electric shock, or supersonics. There\nwas no way of determining how much would be required to knock him out or\nhow much would be required to kill. There were no easy answers.\n\nThe only answer was a man called Stanton.\n\n    _Boots! Boots! Boots! Boots! Marchin' up and down again!\n      And there's no discharge in the war!_\n\nStanton hummed the song in his mind. It seemed that he had been walking\nforever through the Kingdom of Hades, while around him twittered the\nghosts of the dead.\n\n_Poor shades_, he thought, entertaining the fancy for a brief moment,\n_will I be one of you in a short while?_\n\nThere was no answer, though the squeaking continued. The sound of his\nfeet and the snarling chirping of the rats were the only sounds in the\nworld.\n\n\"Barhop to Barbell,\" said a voice suddenly, sounding very loud in his\near, \"this is where you have to make your change to the other tunnel.\"\n\n\"Barbell to Barhop. I know. I've been watching the markers.\"\n\n\"Just precaution, Barbell,\" Captain Greer said. \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"I'd like to rest for a few minutes, frankly,\" Stanton said.\n\n\"Feeling tired?\" There was just the barest tinge of alarm in the\ncaptain's voice.\n\n\"No,\" Stanton said. \"I just want to sit down and rest my feet for a few\nminutes.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Then the captain's voice came again. \"Okay, go ahead\nand relax, Barbell. Take ten. But be ready to move fast if I yell. These\nalarm systems are tricky things to hold. And don't start moving again\nwithout letting me know.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nStanton lifted himself out of the trench in which the tunnel ran and sat\non the edge of the boarding platform. It wasn't far now. There was only\none more of the old entranceways between himself and the Nipe. This\nparticular one was a transfer point, where two different parts of the\ntunnel network met and it was possible to transfer from one to another.\nIt required going up a couple of flights of stairs to the next higher\nlevel, and changing to another tunnel going southward.\n\nThere were other ways. This tunnel, the one he had been following for so\nlong, branched a little farther south. If he took one branch, he would\nend up to the east of the Nipe; the other would bring him to a point on\nthe west. From either, he would have to travel laterally through\nanother set of tunnels, but neither route offered anything that this\none didn't have, and the most direct route would be best.\n\n\"Barbell to Barhop,\" he whispered, \"I'm ready to go.\"\n\n\"It's only been five minutes.\"\n\n\"I know. But I rest pretty fast, too. Let's move out.\"\n\nThere were a few seconds of silence, then Captain Greer said: \"All set,\nBarbell. Move out.\"\n\nStanton got to his feet and walked toward the stairway that led up to\nthe next level. Minutes later, he was in another tunnel exactly similar\nto the first one, walking southward again.\n\nBut now he was more careful. He watched the ground carefully, making\nsure that he didn't step on anything that would snap or rattle. The Nipe\nwas still quite a distance away--three-quarters of a mile, or so--but\ntaking the chance that the beast couldn't hear him might be deadly\ndangerous. The robot rat that he was following led him along a path that\nhad been unobtrusively cleared of rubble by the robot rats over a period\nof months, but the robots weren't the only rats in the place. He kept\nhis eyes on the path.\n\nA while later, the voice in his ear said: \"A hundred yards to go,\nBarbell.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Stanton whispered. \"He hasn't moved?\"\n\n\"No. I'll yell if he does. You don't need to talk any more. His ears\nmight pick up even that whisper.\"\n\n_He hasn't moved_, Stanton thought. _Not for all this time. Not since I\ncame down into his private domain. All this time, he has been sitting\nmotionless--waiting. Wouldn't it be funny if he were dead? If his heart\nhad stopped, or something. Wouldn't that be absolutely hilarious?\nWouldn't that be a big joke on everybody? Especially me._\n\nAhead was the large area that had been one of the major junction points\nof the tunnel network. This was the area that the Nipe had taken over to\nbuild his home-away-from-home. Here were his workshops, his\nlaboratories, his storerooms.\n\nAnd somewhere here was the Nipe.\n\nHe came out of the tunnel into another passenger-loading area. Just to\nhis left was another short stairway that led up to a slightly higher\nlevel. He moved slowly and quietly. He didn't want to fight down here on\nthe tracks, and he didn't want to be caught just yet.\n\nCautiously he lifted himself to the platform where long-gone passengers\nhad once waited for long-gone trains.\n\nThe quality of the illumination at the head of the stairs was different\nfrom that which he had been used to for the past three hours. He lifted\noff the infra-red goggles. Enough light spilled over from the Nipe's\nlair to give him illumination to see by. Silently, he put the goggles on\nthe floor of the platform. He wouldn't need them again.\n\nThen, step by step, he walked up the concrete stairway.\n\nAt the head of the stairs, he paused to get his bearings.\n\nThe illumination was not bright, but it was enough to--\n\n\"Barbell! He's heard you! Watch it!\"\n\nBut Stanton had already heard the movement of the Nipe. He jerked off\nthe communicator and threw it down the stairs behind him. He wanted no\nencumbrances now!\n\nHe ran quickly out into the center of the big underground room, away\nfrom the open stairwell.\n\nAnd then, as fast as any express train that had ever moved through these\nsubterranean ways, the Nipe came around a corner thirty feet away, his\nfour violet eyes gleaming, his limbs rippling beneath his centipede-like\nbody.\n\nFrom fifteen feet away, he launched himself through the air, his\noutstretched hands ready to kill.\n\nBut Stanton's marvelous neuromuscular system was already in action.\n\nAt this stage of the game, it would be utter suicide to let the Nipe\nget in close. Stanton couldn't fend off eight grasping hands with his\nown two. He leaped to one side, and the Nipe got his first surprise in\nten years when Stanton's fist slammed against the side of his snouted\nhead, knocking him in the direction opposite that in which Stanton had\nmoved.\n\nThe Nipe landed, turned, and charged back toward the man. This time he\nreared up, using his two rearmost pairs of limbs for locomotion, while\nthe two forward pairs were held out, ready to kill.\n\nHe got surprise number two when Stanton's fist landed on the tip of his\nrather sensitive snout, rocking his head back. His own hands met nothing\nbut air, and by the time he had recovered from the blow, Stanton was\nwell back, out of the way.\n\n_He's so small!_ Stanton thought wonderingly. Even when he reared up,\nthe Nipe's head was only three feet above the concrete floor.\n\nThe Nipe came in again--more cautiously this time.\n\nStanton punched again with a straight right. The Nipe moved his head\naside, and Stanton's knuckles merely grazed the side of the alien's\nhead, just below the lower right eye.\n\nAt the same time, one of the Nipe's hands swung in in a chopping right\nhook that took Stanton just below the ribs. Stanton leaped back with a\ngasp of pain.\n\nThe Nipe didn't use fists. He used his open hand, fingers together, like\na judo fighter.\n\nThe Nipe came forward, and, as Stanton danced back, the Nipe made a grab\nfor his ankle, almost catching it. There were too many hands to watch!\n\nStanton had two advantages: weight and reach. His arms were almost half\nagain as long as the Nipe's.\n\nAgainst that, the Nipe had all those hands; and with his low center of\ngravity and four-footed stance, it would be hard to knock him down. On\nthe other hand, if Stanton lost his footing, the fight would be over\nfast.\n\nStanton lunged suddenly forward and planted a left in the Nipe's right\nupper eye, then followed it with a right uppercut to the Nipe's jaw as\nhis head snapped back. The Nipe's four hands cut inward from the sides\nlike sword blades, but they found no target.\n\nBacking away, Stanton realized he had another advantage. The Nipe\ncouldn't throw a straight jab! His shoulders--if that's what they should\nbe called--were narrow and the upper arm bones weren't articulated\nproperly for such a blow. The alien could throw a mean hook, but he had\nto get in close to deliver it.\n\nOn the other side of the coin was the fact that the Nipe knew plenty\nabout human anatomy--from the bones out. Stanton's knowledge of Nipe\nanatomy was almost totally superficial.\n\nHe wished he knew if and where the Nipe had a solar plexus. He would\nlike to punch something soft for a change.\n\nInstead, he tried for another eye. He danced in, jabbed, and danced out.\nThe Nipe had ducked again, taking the blow on the side of his head.\n\nThen the Nipe came in low, at an angle, trying for the groin. For his\ntroubles, he got a knee in the jaw that staggered him badly. One\ngrasping hand clutched at Stanton's right thigh and grabbed hard.\nStanton swung his fist down like a pendulum and knocked the arm aside.\n\nBut there was a slight limp in his movements as he back-pedaled away\nfrom the Nipe. That full-handed pinch had hurt like the very devil!\n\nStanton was angry now, with the hot, controlled anger of a fighting man.\nHe stepped in quickly and slammed two fast hard jabs into the point of\nthe Nipe's snout, jarring the monster backward. And this time it was\nthe Nipe who scuttled back out of the way.\n\nStanton moved in fast to press his advantage and landed a beaut on the\nNipe's lower left eye. Then he tried a body blow. It wasn't too\nsuccessful. The alien had an endoskeleton, but he also had a tough hide\nthat was somewhat like thick, leathery chitin.\n\nStanton pulled back, getting out of the way of the Nipe's open-handed\njudo cuts.\n\nHis fists were beginning to hurt, and his leg was paining him badly\nwhere the Nipe had clamped onto it. And his ribs were throbbing where\nthe Nipe had landed that single blow.\n\nAnd then he realized that, so far, the Nipe had only landed that one\nblow!\n\n_One punch and one pinch_, Stanton thought with a touch of awe. _The\nonly other damage he's inflicted has been to my knuckles!_\n\nThe Nipe charged in again, then he leaped suddenly and clawed for\nStanton's face with his first pair of hands. The second and third pairs\nchopped in toward the man's body. The last pair propelled him off the\nfloor.\n\nStanton stepped back and drove in a long, hard right, hitting him just\nbelow the jaw, where his throat would have been if he had been human.\n\nThe Nipe arced backward in a half somersault and landed flat on his\nback.\n\nStanton backed up a little more, waiting, while the Nipe wiggled feebly\nfor a moment. _The Marquis of Queensberry should have lived to see\nthis_, he thought.\n\nThe Nipe rolled over and crouched on all eight limbs. His violet eyes\nwatched Stanton, but the man could read no expression on that inhuman\nface.\n\n\"_You did not kill._\"\n\nFor a moment, Stanton found it hard to believe that the hissing,\nguttural voice had come from the crouching monster.\n\n\"_You did not even_ try _to kill._\"\n\n\"I have no wish to kill you,\" Stanton said evenly.\n\n\"_I can see that. Do you ... Are you ..._\" He stopped, as if baffled.\n\"_There are not the proper words. Do you follow the Customs?_\"\n\nStanton felt a surge of triumph. This was what George Yoritomo had\nguessed might happen!\n\n\"If I must kill you,\" Stanton said carefully, \"I, myself, will do the\nhonors. You will not go uneaten.\"\n\nThe Nipe sagged a little, relaxing all over. \"_I had hoped it was so. It\nwas the only thinkable thing. I saw you on the television, and it was\nonly thinkable that you came for me._\"\n\nStanton sighed inwardly. That part of Colonel Mannheim's strategy had\nworked, too. The Nipe had seen all the publicity releases that had been\nso carefully tailored for him.\n\n\"_I knew you were out on the asteroids_,\" the Nipe went on. \"_But I had\ndecided that you had come to kill. Since you did not, what are your\nthoughts, Stanley Martin?_\"\n\n\"That we should help each other,\" Stanton said.\n\nIt was as simple as that.\n\n\n\n\n_[23]_\n\n\nStanton sat in his hotel room, smoking a cigarette, staring at the wall,\nand thinking.\n\nHe was alone again. All the fuss and feathers and foofaraw were over.\nDr. Farnsworth was in another room of the suite, making his plans for a\ncomplete physical examination of the Nipe. Dr. George Yoritomo was\nhaving the time of his life, holding a conversation with the Nipe,\ndrawing the alien out, and getting him to talk about his own race and\ntheir history.\n\nAnd Stanley Martin was plotting the next phase of the capture--the\ncover-up.\n\nStanton smiled a little. Colonel Mannheim had been a great one for\nplanning, all right. Every little detail was taken care of. It had\nsometimes made his plans more complex than necessary, Stanton suspected.\nMannheim had tended to try to account for every possible eventuality,\nand, after he had done that, he had set aside a few reserves here and\nthere, just in case they might be useful if something unforeseen\nhappened.\n\nAll things considered, the Government had certainly done the right\nthing. And, in picking Mannheim, they had picked the right man.\n\nStanton got up, walked over to the window, and looked down at the\nstreets of Government City, eight floors below.\n\nWhat would those people down there think if they were told the true\nstory of the Nipe? What would the average citizen say if he discovered\nthat, at this very moment, the Nipe was being treated almost as an\nhonored guest of the Government? More, what would he say if he suspected\nthat the Nipe--the horrible, murderous, man-eating Nipe--could have been\nkilled easily at any time during the past six years?\n\nWould it be possible for anyone to explain to the common average man\nthat, in the long run, the knowledge possessed by the Nipe was\ntremendously more valuable to the race of Man than the lives of a few\nindividuals?\n\nCould those people down there, and the others like them all over the\nworld, be made to understand that, by his own lights, the Nipe had been\nbehaving in the most civilized and gentlemanly fashion he knew? Could\nthey ever be made to understand that, because of the tremendous wealth\nof priceless information stored in that alien brain, the Nipe's life had\nto be preserved at any cost?\n\nOr would they scream for blood?\n\nDr. Farnsworth assumed that Stanley Martin was going to spread a story\nabout the Nipe's death--a carefully concocted story about how Stanley\nMartin had found the beast and the police had killed it. There might,\nFarnsworth assumed, be a carefully made \"corpse\" for the mob to hiss at.\nMaybe Farnsworth was right. But Stanton had the feeling that Martin and\nGeorge Yoritomo had something else up their collective sleeve.\n\nThe phone hummed. Stanton walked over, thumbed the answer button, and\nwatched George Yoritomo's face take shape on the screen.\n\n\"Bart! I have just had the privilege of viewing the tapes of your fight\nwith our friend, the Nipe. Incredible! I watched the original on the\nscreen, of course, but I had to run the tapes. I wanted to slow it down,\nso that I could see what actually happened. Magnificent, that right of\nyours! _So!_\" He jabbed a fist out, shadowboxing with Stanton over the\nphone circuit.\n\n\"Awww, it weren't nuthin', Maw,\" Stanton drawled. \"I jes' sorta flang\nout a fist an' he got in the way.\"\n\n\"Of course! But such a fling! Seriously, Bart, I want to run those tapes\nover again, and I want you to tell me, as best you can, just what went\non in your mind at each stage of the fight. It will be most\ninformative.\"\n\n\"You mean right now? I have an appointment--\"\n\nYoritomo waved a hand. \"No, no. Later. Take your time. But I am honestly\namazed that you won so easily. I knew you were good, and I was certain\nyou'd win, but I must admit that I honestly expected you to be\ninjured.\"\n\nStanton looked down at his bandaged hands and felt the ache of his\nbroken rib and the pain of the blue bruise on his thigh. In spite of the\nway it looked, he had actually been hurt worse than the Nipe had. That\nboy was _tough_!\n\n\"The trouble was that he couldn't adapt himself to fighting in a new\nway, just as you predicted,\" he told Yoritomo. \"He fought me, I assume,\nin just the way he would have fought another Nipe. And that didn't work.\nI had the reach on him, and I could maneuver faster. Besides, he can't\nthrow a straight punch with those shoulders of his.\"\n\n\"It appeared to me,\" Yoritomo said with a broad grin, \"that you were\nfighting him as you would fight another human being. Eh?\"\n\nStanton grinned back. \"I was, in a modified way. But I wasn't confined\nto a pattern. Besides, I won--the Nipe didn't. And that's all that\ncounts.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed. Well, I'll let you know when I'm ready for your\nimpressions of the fight. Probably tomorrow some time--say, in the\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nGeorge Yoritomo nodded his thanks, and his image collapsed and faded\nfrom the screen.\n\nStanton walked back over to the window, but this time he looked at the\nhorizon, not the street.\n\nGeorge Yoritomo had called him \"Bart\". It's funny, Stanton thought, how\nhabit can get the best of a man. Yoritomo had known the truth all along.\nAnd now he knew that his pupil--or patient--whichever it was--was aware\nof the truth. And still, he had called him \"Bart\".\n\n_And I still think of myself as Bart_, he thought. _I probably always\nwill._\n\nAnd why not? Why shouldn't he? Martin Stanton no longer existed--in a\nsense, he had never existed. And in actual fact, he had never had much\nof a real existence. He was only a bad dream. He had always been a bad\ndream. And now that the dream was over, only \"Bart\" was real.\n\nHe thought back, remembering George Yoritomo's explanation.\n\n\"Take two people,\" he had said. \"Two people genetically identical.\nDamage one of them so badly that he is helpless and useless--to himself\nand to others. Damage him so badly that he is always only a step away\nfrom death.\n\n\"The vague telepathic bond that always links identical twins (they\n'think alike', they say) becomes unbalanced under such conditions.\n\n\"Normally, there is a give-and-take. One mind is as strong as the other,\nand each preserves the sense of his own identity, since the two\ndifferent sets of sense receptors give different viewpoints. But if one\nof the twins is damaged badly enough, then something must happen to that\ntelepathic linkage.\n\n\"Usually it is broken.\n\n\"But the link between you and your brother was not broken. Instead, it\nbecame a one-way channel.\n\n\"What happens in such a case? The damaged brother, in order to escape\nthe intolerable prison of his own body, becomes a receptor for the\nstronger brother's thoughts. The weaker feels as the stronger feels. The\nexperience of the one becomes the experience of the other--the thrill of\nrunning after a baseball, the pride of doing something clever with the\nhands, the touch of a girl's kiss upon the lips--all these become the\nproperty of the weaker, since he is receiving the thoughts of the\nstronger. There is, of course, no flow in the other direction. The\nstronger brother has no way of knowing that his every thought is being\nduplicated in his brother's mind.\n\n\"In effect, the damaged brother ceases to think. The thoughts in his\nmind are those of the healthy brother. The feeling of identity becomes\nalmost complete.\n\n\"To the outside observer, the damaged brother appears to be a cataleptic\nschizophrenic, completely cut off from reality. And, in a sense, he is.\"\n\nStanton walked over to the nightstand by the bed, took another cigarette\nfrom the pack, lit it, and looked at the smoke curling up from the tip.\n\n_So Martin became a cataleptic schizophrenic_, he thought.\n\nThe mind of Martin had ceased to think at all. The \"Bart\" part of him\nhad not wanted to be disturbed by the garbled, feeble sensory\nimpressions that \"Mart's\" body provided. Like many another\nschizophrenic, Martin had been living in a little world cut off from the\nactual physical world around his body.\n\nThe difference between Martin's condition and that of the ordinary\nschizophrenic had been that Martin's little dream world had actually\nexisted. It had been an almost exact counterpart of the world that had\nexisted in the perfectly sane, rational mind of his brother, Bart. It\nhad grown and developed as Bart had, fed by the one-way telepathic flow\nfrom the stronger mind to the weaker.\n\nThere had been two Barts--and no Mart at all.\n\nBut there had been only one human being between them. Bart Stanton had\nbeen a strong, capable, intelligent, active human being. The duplicate\nof his mind was just a recording in the mind of a useless,\nradiation-blasted hulk.\n\nAnd then the Neurophysical Institute had come into the picture. A new\nprocess had been developed by Dr. Farnsworth and his crew, by which a\nhuman being could be reconstructed--made, literally, into a superman.\nAll the techniques had been worked out in careful and minute detail. But\nthere was one major drawback. Any normal human body would resist the\nprocess--to the death, if necessary--just as a normal human body will\nresist a skin graft from an alien donor or the injection of an alien\nprotein.\n\nBut the radiation-damaged body of Martin Stanton had had no resistance\nof that kind. It had long been known that deep-penetrating ionizing\nradiation had that effect on an organism. The ability to resist was\nweakened, almost destroyed.\n\nWith Martin Stanton's body--perhaps--the process might work.\n\nSo Bartholomew Stanton, who had become Martin's legal guardian after the\ndeath of their mother, had given permission for the series of operations\nthat would rebuild his crippled brother.\n\nThe telepathic link, of course, had to be shut off--for a time, at\nleast. If it remained intact, Martin would never be able to think for\nhimself, no matter what was done to his body. Part of that cutting-off\nprocess could be done during the treatment of Martin--but only if\nBartholomew would co-operate. He had done his part. He had submitted to\ndeep hypnosis, and had allowed himself to be convinced that his name was\nStanley Martin, to think of himself as Stanley Martin. The Martin name\nwas one that the real Martin's mind would reject utterly. That mind\nwanted nothing to do with anything named Martin.\n\n\"Stanley Martin,\" then, had gone out to the asteroids. In his mind had\nbeen implanted the further instructions that he was not to return to\nEarth nor to attempt to investigate the Nipe under any circumstances.\nThe simple change of name and environment had been just enough to snap\nthe link during a time when Martin's brain had been inactivated by cold\ntherapy and anesthetics.\n\nOnly the sense of identity had remained. The patient was still\n\"Bart\"--but now he was being forced to think for himself.\n\nMannheim had used them both, naturally. Colonel Mannheim had the ability\nto use anyone at hand, including himself, to get a job done.\n\nStanton looked at his watch. It was almost time.\n\nMannheim had sent for \"Stanley Martin\" when the time had come for him to\nreturn in order to give the Nipe data that he would be sure to\nmisinterpret. A special series of code phrases in the message had\nreleased \"Stanley Martin\" from the hypnotic suggestions that had held\nhim for so long. He knew now that he was Bartholomew Stanton.\n\n_And so do I_, thought the man by the window. _We have a lot to\nstraighten out, we two._\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nStanton walked over and opened it, trying not to think.\n\nIt was like looking into a mirror.\n\n\"Hello, Bart,\" he said.\n\n\"Hello, Bart,\" said the other.\n\nIn that instant, complete telepathic linkage was restored. In that\ninstant, they both knew what only one of them had known before--that,\nfor a time, the telepathic flow had been one-way again, but this time in\nthe opposite direction--that \"Stanley Martin\" had been shaken that\nafternoon when his own mind had become the receptor for the other's\nthoughts, and he had experienced completely the entire battle with the\nNipe. His release from the posthypnotic suggestion had made it possible.\n\nThere was no need for further words.\n\n_E duobus unum._\n\nThere was unity without loss of identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Anything You Can Do ..., by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO ... ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24436-8.txt or 24436-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/4/3/24436/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geoffrey Kidd, Stephen Blundell\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
