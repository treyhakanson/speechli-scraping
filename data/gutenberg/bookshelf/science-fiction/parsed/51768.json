The\nhidden sun beat down from a dead-white sky, pouring heat into the\ncanvas top, reflecting heat back from the parched sand.\n\n\"Stay awake,\" Morrison told himself, pulling the sandcar back to its\ncompass course.\n\nIt was his twenty-first day on Venus's Scorpion Desert, his\ntwenty-first day of fighting sleep while the sandcar rocked across the\ndunes, forging over humpbacked little waves. Night travel would have\nbeen easier, but there were too many steep ravines to avoid, too many\nhouse-sized boulders to dodge. Now he knew why men went into the desert\nin teams; one man drove while the other kept shaking him awake.\n\n\"But it's better alone,\" Morrison reminded himself. \"Half the supplies\nand no accidental murders.\"\n\nHis head was beginning to droop; he snapped himself erect. In front\nof him, the landscape shimmered and danced through the polaroid\nwindshield. The sandcar lurched and rocked with treacherous gentleness.\nMorrison rubbed his eyes and turned on the radio.\n\nHe was a big, sunburned, rangy young man with close-cropped black hair\nand gray eyes. He had come to Venus with a grubstake of twenty thousand\ndollars, to find his fortune in the Scorpion Desert as others had done\nbefore him. He had outfitted in Presto, the last town on the edge\nof the wilderness, and spent all but ten dollars on the sandcar and\nequipment.\n\nIn Presto, ten dollars just covered the cost of a drink in the town's\nonly saloon. So Morrison ordered rye and water, drank with the miners\nand prospectors, and laughed at the oldtimers' yarns about the sandwolf\npacks and the squadrons of voracious birds that inhabited the interior\ndesert. He knew all about sunblindness, heat-stroke and telephone\nbreakdown. He was sure none of it would happen to him.\n\nBut now, after twenty-one days and eighteen hundred miles, he had\nlearned respect for this waterless waste of sand and stone three times\nthe area of the Sahara. You really _could_ die here!\n\nBut you could also get rich, and that was what Morrison planned to do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis radio hummed. At full volume, he could hear the faintest murmur of\ndance music from Venusborg. Then it faded and only the hum was left.\n\nHe turned off the radio and gripped the steering wheel tightly in both\nhands. He unclenched one hand and looked at his watch. Nine-fifteen\nin the morning. At ten-thirty he would stop and take a nap. A man had\nto have rest in this heat. But only a half-hour nap. Treasure lay\nsomewhere ahead of him, and he wanted to find it before his supplies\ngot much lower.\n\nThe precious outcroppings of goldenstone _had_ to be up ahead! He'd\nbeen following traces for two days now. Maybe he would hit a real\nbonanza, as Kirk did in '89, or Edmonson and Arsler in '93. If so, he\nwould do just what they did. He'd order up a Prospector's Special, and\nto hell with the cost.\n\nThe sandcar rolled along at an even thirty miles an hour, and Morrison\ntried to concentrate on the heat-blasted yellow-brown landscape. That\nsandstone patch over there was just the tawny color of Janie's hair.\n\nAfter he struck it rich, he and Janie would get married, and he'd go\nback to Earth and buy an ocean farm. No more prospecting. Just one rich\nstrike so he could buy his spread on the deep blue Atlantic. Maybe some\npeople thought fish-herding was tame; it was good enough for him.\n\nHe could see it now, the mackerel herds drifting along and browsing at\nthe plankton pens, himself and his trusty dolphin keeping an eye out\nfor the silvery flash of a predatory barracuda or a steel-gray shark\ncoming along behind the branching coral....\n\nMorrison felt the sandcar lurch. He woke up, grabbed the steering wheel\nand turned it hard. During his moments of sleep, the vehicle had crept\nover the dune's crumbling edge. Sand and pebbles spun under the fat\ntires as the sandcar fought for traction. The car tilted perilously.\nThe tires shrieked against the sand, gripped, and started to pull the\nvehicle back up the slope.\n\nThen the whole face of the dune collapsed.\n\nMorrison held onto the steering wheel as the sandcar flipped over on\nits side and rolled down the slope. Sand filled his mouth and eyes.\nHe spat and held on while the car rolled over again and dropped into\nemptiness.\n\nFor seconds, he was in the air. The sandcar hit bottom squarely on its\nwheels. Morrison heard a double boom as the two rear tires blew out.\nThen his head hit the windshield.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he recovered consciousness, the first thing he did was look at his\nwatch. It read 10:35.\n\n\"Time for that nap,\" Morrison said to himself. \"But I guess I'll survey\nthe situation first.\"\n\nHe found that he was at the bottom of a shallow fault strewn with\nknife-edged pebbles. Two tires had blown on impact, his windshield was\ngone, and one of the doors was sprung. His equipment was strewn around,\nbut appeared to be intact.\n\n\"Could have been worse,\" Morrison said.\n\nHe bent down to examine the tires more carefully.\n\n\"It _is_ worse,\" he said.\n\nThe two blown tires were shredded beyond repair. There wasn't enough\nrubber left in them to make a child's balloon. He had used up his\nspares ten days back crossing Devil's Grill. Used them and discarded\nthem. He couldn't go on without tires.\n\nMorrison unpacked his telephone. He wiped dust from its black\nplastic face, then dialed Al's Garage in Presto. After a moment, the\nsmall video screen lighted up. He could see a man's long, mournful,\ngrease-stained face.\n\n\"Al's Garage. Eddie speaking.\"\n\n\"Hi, Eddie. This is Tom Morrison. I bought that GM sandcar from you\nabout a month ago. Remember?\"\n\n\"Sure I remember you,\" Eddie said. \"You're the guy doing a single into\nthe Southwest Track. How's the bus holding out?\"\n\n\"Fine. Great little car. Reason I called--\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Eddie said, \"what happened to your face?\"\n\nMorrison put his hand to his forehead and felt blood. \"Nothing much,\"\nhe said. \"I went over a dune and blew out two tires.\"\n\nHe turned the telephone so that Eddie could see the tires.\n\n\"Unrepairable,\" said Eddie.\n\n\"I thought so. And I used up all my spares crossing Devil's Grill.\nLook, Eddie, I'd like you to 'port me a couple of tires. Retreads are\nfine. I can't move the sandcar without them.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Eddie said, \"except I haven't any retreads. I'll have to 'port\nyou new ones at five hundred apiece. Plus four hundred dollars 'porting\ncharges. Fourteen hundred dollars, Mr. Morrison.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Now if you'll show me the cash, or a money order which you\ncan send back with the receipt, I'll get moving on it.\"\n\n\"At the moment,\" Morrison said, \"I haven't got a cent on me.\"\n\n\"Bank account?\"\n\n\"Stripped clean.\"\n\n\"Bonds? Property? Anything you can convert into cash?\"\n\n\"Nothing except this sandcar, which you sold me for eight thousand\ndollars. When I come back, I'll settle my bill with the sandcar.\"\n\n\"_If_ you get back. Sorry, Mr. Morrison. No can do.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Morrison asked. \"You know I'll pay for the tires.\"\n\n\"And you know the rules on Venus,\" Eddie said, his mournful face set in\nobstinate lines. \"No credit! Cash and carry!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I can't run the sandcar without tires,\" Morrison said. \"Are you going\nto strand me out here?\"\n\n\"Who in hell is stranding you?\" Eddie asked. \"This sort of thing\nhappens to prospectors every day. You know what you have to do now, Mr.\nMorrison. Call Public Utility and declare yourself a bankrupt. Sign\nover what's left of the sandcar, equipment, and anything you've found\non the way. They'll get you out.\"\n\n\"I'm not turning back,\" Morrison said. \"Look!\" He held the telephone\nclose to the ground. \"You see the traces, Eddie? See those red and\npurple flecks? There's precious stuff near here!\"\n\n\"Every prospector sees traces,\" Eddie said. \"Damned desert is full of\ntraces.\"\n\n\"These are rich,\" Morrison said. \"These are leading straight to big\nstuff, a bonanza lode. Eddie, I know it's a lot to ask, but if you\ncould stake me to a couple of tires--\"\n\n\"I can't do it,\" Eddie said. \"I just work here. I can't 'port you any\ntires, not unless you show me money first. Otherwise I get fired and\nprobably jailed. You know the law.\"\n\n\"Cash and carry,\" Morrison said bleakly.\n\n\"Right. Be smart and turn back now. Maybe you can try again some other\ntime.\"\n\n\"I spent twelve years getting this stake together,\" Morrison said. \"I'm\nnot going back.\"\n\nHe turned off the telephone and tried to think. Was there anyone else\non Venus he could call? Only Max Krandall, his jewel broker. But Max\ncouldn't raise fourteen hundred dollars in that crummy two-by-four\noffice near Venusborg's jewel market. Max could barely scrape up his\nown rent, much less take care of stranded prospectors.\n\n\"I can't ask Max for help,\" Morrison decided. \"Not until I've found\ngoldenstone. The real stuff, not just traces. So that leaves it up to\nme.\"\n\nHe opened the back of the sandcar and began to unload, piling his\nequipment on the sand. He would have to choose carefully; anything he\ntook would have to be carried on his back.\n\nThe telephone had to go with him, and his lightweight testing kit.\nFood concentrates, revolver, compass. And nothing else but water, all\nthe water he could carry. The rest of the stuff would have to stay\nbehind.\n\nBy nightfall, Morrison was ready. He looked regretfully at the twenty\ncans of water he was leaving. In the desert, water was a man's most\nprecious possession, second only to his telephone. But it couldn't\nbe helped. After drinking his fill, he hoisted his pack and set a\nsouthwest course into the desert.\n\nFor three days he trekked to the southwest; then on the fourth day he\nveered to due south, following an increasingly rich trace. The sun,\neternally hidden, beat down on him, and the dead-white sky was like a\nroof of heated iron over his head. Morrison followed the traces, and\nsomething followed him.\n\nOn the sixth day, he sensed movement just out of the range of his\nvision. On the seventh day, he saw what was trailing him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVenus's own brand of wolf, small, lean, with a yellow coat and long,\ngrinning jaws, it was one of the few mammals that made its home in the\nScorpion Desert. As Morrison watched, two more sandwolves appeared\nbeside it.\n\nHe loosened the revolver in its holster. The wolves made no attempt to\ncome closer. They had plenty of time.\n\nMorrison kept on going, wishing he had brought a rifle with him. But\nthat would have meant eight pounds more, which meant eight pounds less\nwater.\n\nAs he was pitching camp at dusk the eighth day, he heard a crackling\nsound. He whirled around and located its source, about ten feet to his\nleft and above his head. A little vortex had appeared, a tiny mouth in\nthe air like a whirlpool in the sea. It spun, making the characteristic\ncrackling sounds of 'porting.\n\n\"Now who could be 'porting anything to me?\" Morrison asked, waiting\nwhile the whirlpool slowly widened.\n\nSolidoporting from a base projector to a field target was a standard\nmeans of moving goods across the vast distances of Venus. Any inanimate\nobject could be 'ported; animate beings couldn't because the process\ninvolved certain minor but distressing molecular changes in protoplasm.\nA few people had found this out the hard way when 'porting was first\nintroduced.\n\nMorrison waited. The aerial whirlpool became a mouth three feet in\ndiameter. From the mouth stepped a chrome-plated robot carrying a large\nsack.\n\n\"Oh, it's you,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the robot said, now completely clear of the field.\n\"Williams 4 at your service with the Venus Mail.\"\n\nIt was a robot of medium height, thin-shanked and flat-footed, humanoid\nin appearance, amiable in disposition. For twenty-three years it\nhad been Venus's entire postal service--sorter, deliverer, and dead\nstorage. It had been built to last, and for twenty-three years the\nmails had always come through.\n\n\"Here we are, Mr. Morrison,\" Williams 4 said. \"Only twice-a-month\nmail call in the desert, I'm sorry to say, but it comes promptly and\nthat's a blessing. This is for you. And this. I think there's one more.\nSandcar broke down, eh?\"\n\n\"It sure did,\" Morrison said, taking his letters.\n\nWilliams 4 went on rummaging through its bag. Although it was a\nsuperbly efficient postman, the old robot was known as the worst gossip\non three planets.\n\n\"There's one more in here somewhere,\" Williams 4 said. \"Too bad about\nthe sandcar. They just don't build 'em like they did in my youth. Take\nmy advice, young man. Turn back if you still have the chance.\"\n\nMorrison shook his head.\n\n\"Foolish, downright foolish,\" the old robot said. \"Pity you don't have\nmy perspective. Too many's the time I've come across you boys lying in\nthe sand in the dried-out sack of your skin, or with your bones gnawed\nto splinters by the sandwolves and the filthy black kites. Twenty-three\nyears I've been delivering mail to fine-looking young men like you,\nand each one thinking he's unique and different.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot's eyecells became distant with memory. \"But they _aren't_\ndifferent,\" Williams 4 said. \"They're as alike as robots off the\nassembly line--especially after the wolves get through with them. And\nthen I have to send their letters and personal effects back to their\nloved ones on Earth.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Morrison said. \"But some get through, don't they?\"\n\n\"Sure they do,\" the robot said. \"I've seen men make one, two, three\nfortunes. And then die on the sands trying to make a fourth.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" Morrison said. \"I just want one. Then I'm going to buy me an\nundersea farm on Earth.\"\n\nThe robot shuddered. \"I have a dread of salt water. But to each his\nown. Good luck, young man.\"\n\nThe robot looked Morrison over carefully--probably to see what he had\nin the way of personal effects--then climbed back into the aerial\nwhirlpool. In a moment, it was gone. In another moment, the whirlpool\nhad vanished.\n\nMorrison sat down to read his mail. The first letter was from his\njewel broker, Max Krandall. It told about the depression that had hit\nVenusborg, and hinted that Krandall might have to go into bankruptcy if\nsome of his prospectors didn't strike something good.\n\nThe second letter was a statement from the Venus Telephone Company.\nMorrison owed two hundred and ten dollars and eight cents for two\nmonths' telephone service. Unless he remitted this sum at once, his\ntelephone was liable to be turned off.\n\nThe last letter, all the way from Earth, was from Janie. It was filled\nwith news about his cousins, aunts and uncles. She told him about the\nAtlantic farm sites she had looked over, and the wonderful little place\nshe had found near Martinique in the Caribbean. She begged him to give\nup prospecting if it looked dangerous; they could find another way\nof financing the farm. She sent all her love and wished him a happy\nbirthday in advance.\n\n\"Birthday?\" Morrison asked himself. \"Let's see, today is July\ntwenty-third. No, it's the twenty-fourth, and my birthday's August\nfirst. Thanks for remembering, Janie.\"\n\nThat night he dreamed of Earth and the blue expanse of the Atlantic\nOcean. But toward dawn, when the heat of Venus became insistent, he\nfound he was dreaming of mile upon mile of goldenstone, of grinning\nsandwolves, and of the Prospector's Special.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRock gave way to sand as Morrison plowed his way across the bottom of a\nlong-vanished lake. Then it was rock again, twisted and tortured into a\nthousand gaunt shapes. Reds, yellows and browns swam in front of his\neyes. In all that desert, there wasn't one patch of green.\n\nHe continued his trek into the tumbled stone mazes of the interior\ndesert, and the wolves trekked with him, keeping pace far out on either\nflank.\n\nMorrison ignored them. He had enough on his mind just to negotiate the\nsheer cliffs and the fields of broken stone that blocked his way to the\nsouth.\n\nBy the eleventh day after leaving the sandcar, the traces were almost\nrich enough for panning. The sandwolves were tracking him still, and\nhis water was almost gone. Another day's march would finish him.\n\nMorrison thought for a moment, then unstrapped his telephone and dialed\nPublic Utility in Venusborg.\n\nThe video screen showed a stern, severely dressed woman with iron-gray\nhair. \"Public Utility,\" she said. \"May we be of service?\"\n\n\"Hi,\" Morrison said cheerfully. \"How's the weather in Venusborg?\"\n\n\"Hot,\" the woman said. \"How's it out there?\"\n\n\"I hadn't even noticed,\" Morrison said, grinning. \"Too busy counting my\nfortune.\"\n\n\"You've found goldenstone?\" the woman asked, her expression becoming\nless severe.\n\n\"Sure have,\" Morrison said. \"But don't pass the word around yet. I'm\nstill staking my claim. I think I can use a refill on these.\"\n\nSmiling easily, he held up his canteens. Sometimes it worked.\nSometimes, if you showed enough confidence, Public Utility would fill\nyou up without checking your account. True, it was embezzling, but this\nwas no time for niceties.\n\n\"I suppose your account is in order?\" asked the woman.\n\n\"Of course,\" Morrison said, feeling his smile grow stiff. \"The name's\nTom Morrison. You can just check--\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't do that personally,\" the woman said. \"Hold that canteen\nsteady. Here we go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGripping the canteen in both hands, Morrison watched as the water,\n'ported four thousand miles from Venusborg, appeared as a slender\ncrystal stream above the mouth of his canteen. The stream entered the\ncanteen, making a wonderful gurgling sound. Watching it, Morrison found\nhis dry mouth actually was beginning to salivate.\n\nThen the water stopped.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Morrison asked.\n\nHis video screen went blank. Then it cleared, and Morrison found\nhimself staring into a man's narrow face. The man was seated in front\nof a large desk. The sign in front of him read _Milton P. Reade, Vice\nPresident, Accounts_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mr. Morrison,\" Reade said, \"your account is overdrawn. You have been\nobtaining water under false pretenses. That is a criminal offense.\"\n\n\"I'm going to pay for the water,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"As soon as I get back to Venusborg.\"\n\n\"With what,\" asked Mr. Reade, \"do you propose to pay?\"\n\n\"With goldenstone,\" Morrison said. \"Look around here, Mr. Reade. The\ntraces are rich! Richer than they were for the Kirk claim! I'll be\nhitting the outcroppings in another day--\"\n\n\"That's what every prospector thinks,\" Mr. Reade said. \"Every\nprospector on Venus is only a day from goldenstone. And they all expect\ncredit from Public Utility.\"\n\n\"But in this case--\"\n\n\"Public Utility,\" Mr. Reade continued inexorably, \"is not a\nphilanthropic organization. Its charter specifically forbids the\nextension of credit. Venus is a frontier, Mr. Morrison, a _farflung_\nfrontier. Every manufactured article on Venus must be imported from\nEarth at outrageous cost. We do have our own water, but locating it,\npurifying it, then 'porting it is an expensive process. This company,\nlike every other company on Venus, necessarily operates on a very\nnarrow margin of profit, which is invariably plowed back into further\nexpansion. That is why there can be no credit on Venus.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" Morrison said. \"But I'm telling you, I only need a\nday or two more--\"\n\n\"Absolutely impossible. By the rules, we shouldn't even help you out\nnow. The time to report bankruptcy was a week ago, when your sandcar\nbroke down. Your garage man reported, as required by law. But you\ndidn't. We would be within our rights to leave you stranded. Do you\nunderstand that?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Morrison said wearily.\n\n\"However, the company has decided to stretch a point in your favor. If\nyou turn back immediately, we will keep you supplied with water for the\nreturn trip.\"\n\n\"I'm not turning back yet. I'm almost on the real stuff.\"\n\n\"You must turn back! Be reasonable, Morrison! Where would we be if\nwe let every prospector wander over the desert while we supplied his\nwater? There'd be ten thousand men out there, and we'd be out of\nbusiness inside of a year. I'm stretching the rules now. Turn back.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Morrison.\n\n\"You'd better think about it. If you don't turn back now, Public\nUtility takes no further responsibility for your water supply.\"\n\nMorrison nodded. If he went on, he would stand a good chance of\ndying in the desert. But if he turned back, what then? He would be in\nVenusborg, penniless and in debt, looking for work in an overcrowded\ncity. He'd sleep in a community shed and eat at a soup kitchen with\nthe other prospectors who had turned back. And how would he be able to\nraise the fare back to Earth? When would he ever see Janie again?\n\n\"I guess I'll keep on going,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"Then Public Utility takes no further responsibility for you,\" Reade\nrepeated, and hung up.\n\nMorrison packed up his telephone, took a sip from his meager water\nsupply, and went on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sandwolves loped along at each side, moving in closer. Overhead, a\ndelta-winged kite found him. It balanced on the up-drafts for a day and\na night, waiting for the wolves to finish him. Then a flock of small\nflying scorpions sighted the waiting kite. They drove the big creature\nupstairs into the cloud bank. For a day the flying reptiles waited.\nThen they in turn were driven off by a squadron of black kites.\n\nThe traces were very rich now, on the fifteenth day since he had left\nthe sandcar. By rights, he should be walking over goldenstone. He\nshould be surrounded by goldenstone. But still he hadn't found any.\n\nMorrison sat down and shook his last canteen. It gave off no wet sound.\nHe uncapped it and turned it up over his mouth. Two drops trickled down\nhis parched throat.\n\nIt was about four days since he had talked to Public Utility. He must\nhave used up the last of his water yesterday. Or had it been the day\nbefore?\n\nHe recapped the empty canteen and looked around at the heat-blasted\nlandscape. Abruptly he pulled the telephone out of his pack and dialed\nMax Krandall in Venusborg.\n\nKrandall's round, worried face swam into focus on the screen. \"Tommy,\"\nhe said, \"you look like hell.\"\n\n\"I'm all right,\" Morrison said. \"A little dried out, that's all. Max,\nI'm near goldenstone.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Krandall asked.\n\n\"See for yourself,\" Morrison said, swinging the telephone around. \"Look\nat the stone formations! Do you see the red and purple markings over\nthere?\"\n\n\"Traces, all right,\" Krandall admitted dubiously.\n\n\"There's rich stuff just beyond it,\" Morrison said. \"There has to be!\nLook, Max, I know you're short on money, but I'm going to ask you a\nfavor. Send me a pint of water. Just a pint, so I can go on for another\nday or two. We can both get rich for the price of a pint of water.\"\n\n\"I can't do it,\" Krandall said sadly.\n\n\"You can't?\"\n\n\"That's right. Tommy, I'd send you water even if there wasn't anything\naround you but sandstone and granite. Do you think I'd let you die of\nthirst if I could help it? But I can't do a thing. Take a look.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKrandall rotated his telephone. Morrison saw that the chairs, table,\ndesk, filing cabinet and safe were gone from the office. All that was\nleft in the room was the telephone.\n\n\"I don't know why they haven't taken out the phone,\" Krandall said. \"I\nowe two months on my bill.\"\n\n\"I do too,\" said Morrison.\n\n\"I'm stripped,\" Krandall said. \"I haven't got a dime. Don't get me\nwrong, I'm not worried about myself. I can always eat at a soup\nkitchen. But I can't 'port you any water. Not you or Remstaater.\"\n\n\"Jim Remstaater?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He was following a trace up north past Forgotten River. His\nsandcar broke an axle last week and he wouldn't turn back. His water\nran out yesterday.\"\n\n\"I'd bail him out if I could,\" said Morrison.\n\n\"And he'd bail you out if he could,\" Krandall said. \"But he can't and\nyou can't and I can't. Tommy, you have only one hope.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Find goldenstone. Not just traces, find the real thing worth real\nmoney. Then phone me. If you really have goldenstone, I'll bring in\nWilkes from Tri-Planet Mining and get him to advance us some money.\nHe'll probably want fifty per cent of the claim.\"\n\n\"That's plain robbery!\"\n\n\"No, it's just the high cost of credit on Venus,\" Krandall answered.\n\"Don't worry, there'll still be plenty left over. But you have to find\ngoldenstone first.\"\n\n\"OK,\" Morrison said. \"It should be around here somewhere. Max, what's\ntoday's date?\"\n\n\"July thirty-first. Why?\"\n\n\"Just wondering. I'll call you when I've found something.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Morrison sat on a little boulder and stared dully\nat the sand. July thirty-first. Tomorrow was his birthday. His family\nwould be thinking about him. Aunt Bess in Pasadena, the twins in Laos,\nUncle Ted in Durango. And Janie, of course, waiting for him in Tampa.\n\nMorrison realized that tomorrow might be his last birthday unless he\nfound goldenstone.\n\nHe got to his feet, strapped the telephone back in his pack beside the\nempty canteens, and set a course to the south.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wasn't alone. The birds and beasts of the desert marched with him.\nOverhead, the silent black kites circled endlessly. The sandwolves\ncrept closer on his flanks, their red tongues lolling out, waiting for\nthe carcass to fall....\n\n\"I'm not dead yet!\" Morrison shouted at them.\n\nHe drew his revolver and fired at the nearest wolf. At twenty feet, he\nmissed. He went down on one knee, held the revolver tightly in both\nhands and fired again. The wolf yelped in pain. The pack immediately\nwent for the wounded animal, and the kites swooped down for their share.\n\nMorrison put the revolver back in its holster and went on. He could\ntell he was in a badly dehydrated state. The landscape jumped and\ndanced in front of him, and his footing was unsure. He discarded the\nempty canteens, threw away everything but the testing kit, telephone\nand revolver. Either he was coming out of the desert in style or he\nwasn't coming out at all.\n\nThe traces continued to run rich. But still he came upon no sign of\ntangible wealth.\n\nThat evening he found a shallow cave set into the base of a cliff. He\ncrawled inside and built a barricade of rocks across the entrance. Then\nhe drew his revolver and leaned back against the far wall.\n\nThe sandwolves were outside, sniffing and snapping their jaws. Morrison\npropped himself up and got ready for an all-night vigil.\n\nHe didn't sleep, but he couldn't stay awake, either. Dreams and\nvisions tormented him. He was back on Earth and Janie was saying to\nhim, \"It's the tuna. Something must be wrong with their diet. Every\nlast one of them is sick.\"\n\n\"It's the darnedest thing,\" Morrison told her. \"Just as soon as you\ndomesticate a fish, it turns into a prima donna.\"\n\n\"Are you going to stand there philosophizing,\" Janie asked, \"while your\nfish are sick?\"\n\n\"Call the vet.\"\n\n\"I did. He's off at the Blake's place, taking care of their dairy\nwhale.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll go out and take a look.\" He slipped on his face mask.\nGrinning, he said, \"I don't even have time to dry off before I have to\ngo out again.\"\n\nHis face and chest were wet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorrison opened his eyes. His face and chest _were_ wet--from\nperspiration. Staring at the partially blocked mouth of the cave, he\ncould see green eyes, two, four, six, eight.\n\nHe fired at them, but they didn't retreat. He fired again, and\nhis bullet richocheted off the cave wall, stinging him with stone\nsplinters. With his next shots, he succeeded in winging one of the\nwolves. The pack withdrew.\n\nThat emptied the revolver. Morrison searched through his pockets and\nfound five more cartridges. He carefully loaded the gun. Dawn couldn't\nbe far away now.\n\nAnd then he was dreaming again, this time of the Prospector's Special.\nHe had heard about it in every little saloon that bordered the\nScorpion. Bristly-bearded old prospectors told a hundred different\nstories about it, and the cynical bartenders chimed in with their\nversions. Kirk had it in '89, ordered up big and special just for him.\nEdmonson and Arsler received it in '93. That was certain. And other men\nhad had it too, as they sat on their precious goldenstone claims. Or so\npeople said.\n\nBut was it real? Was there such a thing as the Prospector's Special?\nWould he live to see that rainbow-hued wonder, tall as a church\nsteeple, wide as a house, more precious than goldenstone itself?\n\nSure he would! Why, he could almost see it now....\n\nMorrison shook himself awake. It was morning. Painfully, he crawled out\nof the cave to face the day.\n\nHe stumbled and crawled to the south, escorted closely by wolves,\nshaded by predatory flying things. His fingers scrabbled along rock and\nsand. The traces were rich, rich!\n\nBut where in all this desolation was the goldenstone?\n\nWhere? He was almost past caring. He drove his sunburned, dried-out\nbody, stopping only to fire a single shot when the wolves came too\nclose.\n\nFour bullets left.\n\nHe had to fire again when the kites, growing impatient, started diving\nat his head. A lucky shot tore into the flock, downing two. It gave the\nwolves something to fight over. Morrison crawled on blindly.\n\nAnd fell over the edge of a little cliff.\n\nIt wasn't a serious fall, but the revolver was knocked from his hand.\nBefore he could find it, the wolves were on him. Only their greed saved\nMorrison. While they fought over him, he rolled away and retrieved his\nrevolver. Two shots scattered the pack. That left one bullet.\n\nHe'd have to save that one for himself, because he was too tired to\ngo on. He sank to his knees. The traces were rich here. Fantastically\nrich. Somewhere nearby....\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" Morrison said.\n\nThe little ravine into which he had fallen was solid goldenstone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe picked up a pebble. Even in its rough state he could see the deep\nluminous golden glow, the fiery red and purple flecks deep in the\nshining stone.\n\n\"Make sure,\" Morrison told himself. \"No false alarms, no visions, no\nwild hopes. Make sure.\"\n\nHe broke off a chunk of rock with the butt of his revolver. It still\nlooked like goldenstone. He took out his testing kit and spilled a few\ndrops of white solution on the rock. The solution foamed green.\n\n\"Goldenstone, sure as sure,\" Morrison said, looking around at the\nglowing cliff walls. \"Hey, I'm rich!\"\n\nHe took out his telephone. With trembling fingers he dialed Krandall's\nnumber.\n\n\"Max!\" Morrison shouted. \"I've hit it! I've hit the real stuff!\"\n\n\"My name is not Max,\" a voice over the telephone said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"My name is Boyard,\" the man said.\n\nThe video screen cleared, and Morrison saw a thin, sallow-faced man\nwith a hairline mustache.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Boyard,\" Morrison said. \"I must have gotten the wrong\nnumber. I was calling--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter who you were calling,\" Mr. Boyard said. \"I am\nDistrict Supervisor of the Venus Telephone Company. Your bill is two\nmonths overdue.\"\n\n\"I can pay it now,\" Morrison said, grinning.\n\n\"Excellent,\" said Mr. Boyard. \"As soon as you do, your service will be\nresumed.\"\n\nThe screen began to fade.\n\n\"Wait!\" Morrison cried. \"I can pay as soon as I reach your office. But\nI must make one telephone call. Just one call, so that I--\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" Mr. Boyard said decisively. \"_After_ you have paid your\nbill, your service will be turned on immediately.\"\n\n\"I've got the money right here!\" Morrison said. \"Right here in my hand!\"\n\nMr. Boyard paused. \"Well, it's unusual, but I suppose we could arrange\nfor a special robot messenger if you are willing to pay the expenses.\"\n\n\"I am!\"\n\n\"Hm. It's irregular, but I daresay we ... Where is the money?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" Morrison said. \"You recognize it, don't you? It's\ngoldenstone!\"\n\n\"I am sick and tired of the tricks you prospectors think you can put\nover on us. Holding up a handful of pebbles--\"\n\n\"But this is really goldenstone! Can't you see it?\"\n\n\"I am a businessman,\" Mr. Boyard said, \"not a jeweler. I wouldn't know\ngoldenstone from goldenrod.\"\n\nThe video screen went blank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrantically, Morrison tried to reach the operator. There was nothing,\nnot even a dial tone. His telephone was disconnected.\n\nHe put the instrument down and surveyed his situation. The narrow\ncrevice into which he had fallen ran straight for about twenty yards,\nthen curved to the left. No cave was visible in the steep walls, no\nplace where he could build a barricade.\n\nHe heard a movement behind him. Whirling around, he saw a huge old wolf\nin full charge. Without a moment's hesitation, Morrison drew and fired,\nblasting off the top of the beast's head.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Morrison said. \"I was going to save that bullet for myself.\"\n\nIt gave him a moment's grace. He ran down the ravine, looking for an\nopening in its sides. Goldenstone glowed at him and sparkled red and\npurple. And the sandwolves loped along behind him.\n\nThen Morrison stopped. In front of him, the curving ravine ended in a\nsheer wall.\n\nHe put his back against it, holding the revolver by its butt. The\nwolves stopped five feet from him, gathering themselves for a rush.\nThere were ten or twelve of them, and they were packed three deep in\nthe narrow pass. Overhead, the kites circled, waiting for their turn.\n\nAt that moment, Morrison heard the crackling sound of 'porting\nequipment. A whirlpool appeared above the wolves' heads and they backed\nhastily away.\n\n\"Just in time!\" Morrison said.\n\n\"In time for what?\" asked Williams 4, the postman.\n\nThe robot climbed out of the vortex and looked around.\n\n\"Well, young man,\" Williams 4 said, \"this is a fine fix you've gotten\nyourself into. Didn't I warn you? Didn't I advise you to turn back? And\nnow look!\"\n\n\"You were perfectly right,\" Morrison said. \"What did Max Krandall send\nme?\"\n\n\"Max Krandall did not, and could not, send a thing.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here?\"\n\n\"Because it's your birthday,\" Williams 4 said. \"We of the Postal\nDepartment always give special service for birthdays. Here you are.\"\n\nWilliams 4 gave him a handful of mail, birthday greetings from Janie,\nand from his aunts, uncles and cousins on Earth.\n\n\"Something else here,\" Williams 4 said, rummaging in his bag. \"I\n_think_ there was something else here. Let me see.... Yes, here it is.\"\n\nHe handed Morrison a small package.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHastily, Morrison tore off the wrappings. It was a birthday present\nfrom his Aunt Mina in New Jersey. He opened it. It was a large box of\nsalt-water taffy, direct from Atlantic City.\n\n\"Quite a delicacy, I'm told,\" said Williams 4, who had been peering\nover his shoulder. \"But not very satisfactory under the circumstances.\nWell, young man, I hate to see anyone die on his birthday. The best I\ncan wish you is a speedy and painless departure.\"\n\nThe robot began walking toward the vortex.\n\n\"Wait!\" Morrison cried. \"You can't just leave me like this! I haven't\nhad any water in days! And those wolves--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Williams 4 said. \"Do you think I feel _happy_ about it? Even\na robot has some feelings!\"\n\n\"Then help me.\"\n\n\"I can't. The rules of the Postal Department expressly and\ncategorically forbid it. I remember Abner Lathe making much the same\nrequest of me in '97. It took three years for a burial party to reach\nhim.\"\n\n\"You have an emergency telephone, haven't you?\" Morrison asked.\n\n\"Yes. But I can use it only for personal emergencies.\"\n\n\"Can you at least carry a letter for me? A special delivery letter?\"\n\n\"Of course I can,\" the robot postman said. \"That's what I'm here for. I\ncan even lend you pencil and paper.\"\n\nMorrison accepted the pencil and paper and tried to think. If he wrote\nto Max now, special delivery, Max would have the letter in a matter of\nhours. But how long would Max need to raise some money and send him\nwater and ammunition? A day, two days? Morrison would have to figure\nout some way of holding out....\n\n\"I assume you have a stamp,\" the robot said.\n\n\"I don't,\" Morrison replied. \"But I'll buy one from you. Solidoport\nspecial.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the robot. \"We have just put out a new series\nof Venusborg triangulars. I consider them quite an esthetic\naccomplishment. They cost three dollars apiece.\"\n\n\"That's fine. Very reasonable. Let me have one.\"\n\n\"There is the question of payment.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Morrison said, handing the robot a piece of goldenstone worth\nabout five thousand dollars in the rough.\n\nThe postman examined the stone, then handed it back. \"I'm sorry, I can\naccept only cash.\"\n\n\"But this is worth more than a thousand postage stamps!\" Morrison said.\n\"This is goldenstone!\"\n\n\"It may well be,\" Williams 4 said. \"But I have never had any assaying\nknowledge taped into me. Nor is the Venus Postal Service run on a\nbarter system. I'll have to ask for three dollars in bills or coins.\"\n\n\"I don't have it.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry.\" Williams 4 turned to go.\n\n\"You can't just go and let me die!\"\n\n\"I can and must,\" Williams 4 said sadly. \"I am only a robot, Mr.\nMorrison. I was made by men, and naturally I partake of some of their\nsensibilities. That's as it should be. But I also have my limits,\nwhich, in their nature, are similar to the limits most humans have on\nthis harsh planet. And, unlike humans, I cannot transcend my limits.\"\n\nThe robot started to climb into the whirlpool. Morrison stared at him\nblankly, and saw beyond him the waiting wolfpack. He saw the soft glow\nof several million dollars' worth of goldenstone shining from the\nravine's walls.\n\nSomething snapped inside him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith an inarticulate yell, Morrison dived, tackling the robot around\nthe ankles. Williams 4, half in and half out of the 'porting vortex,\nstruggled and kicked, and almost succeeded in shaking Morrison loose.\nBut with a maniac's strength Morrison held on. Inch by inch he dragged\nthe robot out of the vortex, threw him on the ground and pinned him.\n\n\"You are disrupting the mail service,\" said Williams 4.\n\n\"That's not all I'm going to disrupt,\" Morrison growled. \"I'm not\nafraid of dying. That was part of the gamble. But I'm damned if I'm\ngoing to die fifteen minutes after I've struck it rich!\"\n\n\"You have no choice.\"\n\n\"I do. I'm going to use that emergency telephone of yours.\"\n\n\"You can't,\" Williams 4 said. \"I refuse to extrude it. And you could\nnever reach it without the resources of a machine shop.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" said Morrison. \"I plan to find out.\" He pulled out his\nempty revolver.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Williams 4 asked.\n\n\"I'm going to see if I can smash you into scrap metal _without_ the\nresources of a machine shop. I think your eyecells would be a logical\nplace to begin.\"\n\n\"They would indeed,\" said the robot. \"I have no personal sense of\nsurvival, of course. But let me point out that you would be leaving all\nVenus without a postman. Many would suffer because of your anti-social\naction.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Morrison said, raising the revolver above his head.\n\n\"Also,\" the robot said hastily, \"you would be destroying government\nproperty. That is a serious offense.\"\n\nMorrison laughed and swung the pistol. The robot moved its head\nquickly, dodging the blow. It tried to wriggle free, but Morrison's two\nhundred pounds was seated firmly on its thorax.\n\n\"I won't miss this time,\" Morrison promised, hefting the revolver.\n\n\"Stop!\" Williams 4 said. \"It is my duty to protect government property,\neven if that property happens to be myself. You may use my telephone,\nMr. Morrison. Bear in mind that this offense is punishable by a\nsentence of not more than ten and not less than five years in the\nSolar Swamp Penitentiary.\"\n\n\"Let's have that telephone,\" Morrison said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe robot's chest opened and a small telephone extruded. Morrison\ndialed Max Krandall and explained the situation.\n\n\"I see, I see,\" Krandall said. \"All right, I'll try to find Wilkes.\nBut, Tom, I don't know how much I can do. It's after business hours.\nMost places are closed--\"\n\n\"Get them open again,\" said Morrison. \"I can pay for it. And get Jim\nRemstaater out of trouble, too.\"\n\n\"It can't be done just like that. You haven't established any rights to\nyour claim. You haven't even proved that your claim is valuable.\"\n\n\"Look at it.\" Morrison turned the telephone so that Krandall could see\nthe glowing walls of the ravine.\n\n\"Looks real,\" Krandall said. \"But unfortunately, all that glitters is\nnot goldenstone.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" Morrison asked.\n\n\"We'll have to take it step by step. I'll 'port you the Public\nSurveyor. He'll check your claim, establish its limits, and make sure\nno one else has filed on it. You give him a chunk of goldenstone to\ntake back. A big chunk.\"\n\n\"How can I cut goldenstone? I don't have any tools.\"\n\n\"You'll have to figure out a way. He'll take the chunk back for\nassaying. If it's rich enough, you're all set.\"\n\n\"And if it isn't?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we better not talk about that,\" Krandall said. \"I'll get right\nto work on this, Tommy. Good luck!\"\n\nMorrison signed off. He stood up and helped the robot to its feet.\n\n\"In twenty-three years of service,\" Williams 4 said, \"this is the first\ntime anybody has threatened the life of a government postal employee. I\nmust report this to the police authorities at Venusborg, Mr. Morrison.\nI have no choice.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Morrison said. \"But I guess five or ten years in the\npenitentiary is better than dying.\"\n\n\"I doubt it. I carry mail there, you know. You will have the\nopportunity of seeing for yourself in about six months.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Morrison, stunned.\n\n\"In about six months, after I have completed my mail calls around the\nplanet and returned to Venusborg. A matter like this must be reported\nin person. But first and foremost, the mails must go through.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Williams. I don't know how--\"\n\n\"I am simply performing my duty,\" the robot said as it climbed into the\nvortex. \"If you are still on Venus in six months, I will be delivering\nyour mail to the penitentiary.\"\n\n\"I won't be here,\" Morrison said. \"So long, Williams!\"\n\nThe robot disappeared into the 'porting vortex. Then the vortex\ndisappeared. Morrison was alone in the Venusian twilight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found an outcropping of goldenstone larger than a man's head. He\nchipped at it with his pistol butt, and tiny particles danced and\nshimmered in the air. After an hour, he had put four dents in his\nrevolver, but he had barely scratched the highly refractory surface of\nthe goldenstone.\n\nThe sandwolves began to edge forward. Morrison threw stones at them and\nshouted in his dry, cracked voice. The wolves retreated.\n\nHe examined the outcropping again and found a hairline fault running\nalong one edge. He concentrated his blows along the fault.\n\nThe goldenstone refused to crack.\n\nMorrison wiped sweat from his eyes and tried to think. A chisel, he\nneeded a chisel....\n\nHe pulled off his belt. Putting the edge of the steel buckle against\nthe crack, he managed to hammer it in a fraction of an inch. Three more\nblows drove the buckle firmly into the fault. With another blow, the\noutcropping sheared off cleanly. He had separated a twenty-pound piece\nfrom the cliff. At fifty dollars a troy ounce, this lump should be\nworth about twelve thousand dollars--if it assayed out as pure as it\nlooked.\n\nThe twilight had turned a deep gray when the Public Surveyor 'ported\nin. It was a short, squat robot with a conservative crackle-black\nfinish.\n\n\"Good day, sir,\" the surveyor said. \"You wish to file a claim? A\nstandard unrestricted mining claim?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"And where is the center of the aforesaid claim?\"\n\n\"Huh? The center? I guess I'm standing on it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the robot said.\n\nExtruding a steel tape, it walked rapidly away from Morrison. At a\ndistance of two hundred yards, it stopped. More steel tape fluttered as\nit walked, flew and climbed a square with Morrison at the center. When\nit had finished, the surveyor stood for a long time without moving.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Morrison asked.\n\n\"I'm making depth-photographs of the terrain,\" the robot said. \"It's\nrather difficult in this light. Couldn't you wait till morning?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Well, I'll just have to cope,\" the robot said.\n\nIt moved and stood, moved and stood, each subterranean exposure taking\nlonger than the last as the twilight deepened. If it had had pores, it\nwould have sweated.\n\n\"There,\" said the robot at last, \"that takes care of it. Do you have a\nsample for me to take back?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" Morrison said, hefting the slab of goldenstone and\nhanding it to the surveyor. \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Absolutely all,\" the robot said. \"Except, of course, that you haven't\ngiven me the Deed of Search.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorrison blinked. \"I haven't given you the what?\"\n\n\"The Deed of Search. That is a government document showing that\nthe claim you are filing on is free, as per government order, of\nfissionable material in excess of fifty per cent of the total mass to a\ndepth of sixty feet. It's a mere formality, but a necessary one.\"\n\n\"I never heard of it,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"It became a requirement last week,\" explained the surveyor. \"You don't\nhave the Deed? Then I'm afraid your standard unrestricted claim is\ninvalid.\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the robot said, \"you _could_ change your standard unrestricted\nclaim to a special restricted claim. That requires no Deed of Search.\"\n\n\"What does the special restricted part mean?\"\n\n\"It means that in five hundred years all rights revert to the\nGovernment of Venus.\"\n\n\"All right!\" Morrison shouted. \"Fine! Good! Is that all?\"\n\n\"Absolutely all,\" the surveyor said. \"I shall bring this sample\nback and have it assayed and evaluated immediately. From it and the\ndepth-photographs we can extrapolate the value and extent of your\nclaim.\"\n\n\"Send me back something to take care of the wolves,\" Morrison said.\n\"And food. And listen--I want a Prospector's Special.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It will all be 'ported to you--if your claim is of\nsufficient value to warrant the outlay.\"\n\nThe robot climbed into the vortex and vanished.\n\nTime passed, and the wolves edged forward again. They snarled at the\nrocks Morrison threw, but they didn't retreat. Jaws open and tongues\nlolling, they crept up the remaining yards between them and the\nprospector.\n\nThen the leading wolf leaped back and howled. A gleaming vortex had\nappeared over his head and a rifle had fallen from the vortex, striking\nhim on a forepaw.\n\nThe wolves scrambled away. Another rifle fell from the vortex. Then a\nlarge box marked _Grenades, Handle With Care_. Then another box marked\n_Desert Ration K_.\n\nMorrison waited, staring at the gleaming mouth of the vortex. It\ncrossed the sky to a spot a quarter of a mile away and paused there,\nand then a great round brass base emerged from the vortex, and the\nmouth widened to allow an even greater bulge of brass to which the\nbase was attached. The bulge grew higher as the base was lowered\nto the sand. When the last of it appeared, it stood alone in the\nhorizon-to-horizon expanse, a gigantic ornate brass punchbowl in the\ndesert. The vortex rose and paused again over the bowl.\n\nMorrison waited, his throat raw and aching. Now a small trickle came\nout of the vortex and splashed down into the bowl. Still Morrison\ndidn't move.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then it came. The trickle became a roar that sent the wolves and\nkites fleeing in terror, and a cataract poured from the vortex to the\nhuge punchbowl.\n\nMorrison began staggering toward it. He should have ordered a canteen,\nhe told himself thirstily, stumbling across the quarter of a mile of\nsand. But at last he stood beneath the Prospector's Special, higher\nthan a church steeple, wider than a house, filled with water more\nprecious than goldenstone itself. He turned the spigot at the bottom.\nWater soaked the yellow sands and ran in rivulets down the dune.\n\nHe should have ordered a cup or glass, Morrison thought, lying on his\nback with open mouth.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prospector's Special, by Robert Sheckley\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PROSPECTOR'S SPECIAL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51768.txt or 51768.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/6/51768/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
