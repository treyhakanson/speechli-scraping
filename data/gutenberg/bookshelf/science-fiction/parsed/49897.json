GUNN\n\n                         Illustrated by ASHMAN\n\n     [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January\n     1956. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n     copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n     _This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how\n     could he--and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?_\n\n\nThe flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the\nold, orange sun.\n\nIt was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The\nflivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat\ncylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been\nslapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,\nfully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n\nAs it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,\nat the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n\nA moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass\nand knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that\nmade the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver\nrocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n\nThen all was quiet--outside.\n\nInside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the\nair. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing\npractically whipped, too!\"\n\nGrampa was a white-haired 90-year-old who could still go a fast round\nor two with a man (or woman) half his age, but he had a habit of\nlapsing into tantrum when he got annoyed.\n\n\"Now, Grampa,\" Fred soothed, but his face was concerned. Fred, once\ncalled Young Fred, was Grampa's only son. He was sixty and his hair had\nbegun to gray at the temples. \"That landing was pretty rough, Junior.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJunior was Fred's only son. Because he was thirty-five and capable\nof exercising adult judgment and because he had the youngest adult\nreflexes, he sat in the pilot's chair, the control stick between his\nknees, his thumb still over the Off-On button on top. \"I know it,\nFred,\" he said, frowning. \"This world fooled me. It has a diameter\nless than that of Mercury and yet a gravitational pull as great as\nEarth.\"\n\nGrampa started to say something, but an 8-year-old boy looked up from\nthe navigator's table beside the big computer and said, \"Well, gosh,\nJunior, that's why we picked this planet. We fed all the orbital data\ninto Abacus, and Abacus said that orbital perturbations indicated that\nthe second planet was unusually heavy for its size. Then Fred said,\n'That looks like heavy metals', and you said, 'Maybe uranium--'\"\n\n\"That's enough, Four,\" Junior interrupted. \"Never mind what I said.\"\n\nThose were the Peppergrass men, four generations of them, looking\nremarkably alike, although some vital element seemed to have dwindled\nuntil Four looked pale and thin-faced and wizened.\n\n\"And, Four,\" Reba said automatically, \"don't call your father 'Junior.'\nIt sounds disrespectful.\"\n\nReba was Four's mother and Junior's wife. On her own, she was a\nred-haired beauty with the loveliest figure this side of Antares. That\nJunior had won her was, to Grampa, the most hopeful thing he had ever\nnoticed about the boy.\n\n\"But everybody calls Junior 'Junior,'\" Four complained. \"Besides, Fred\nis Junior's father and Junior calls him 'Fred.'\"\n\n\"That's different,\" Reba said.\n\nGrampa was still waving his puzzle circuit indignantly. \"See!\" The\npircuit was a flat box equipped with pushbuttons and thirteen slender\nopenings in the top. One of the openings was lighted. \"That landing\nmade me push the wrong button and the dad-blasted thing beat me again.\"\n\n\"Stop picking on Junior,\" Joyce said sharply. She was Junior's mother\nand Fred's wife, still slim and handsome as she approached sixty, but\nsomehow ice water had replaced the warm blood in her veins. \"I'm sure\nhe did the best he could.\"\n\n\"Anybody talks about gravitational pull,\" Grampa said, snorting,\n\"deserves anything anybody could say about him. There's no such thing,\nJunior. You ought to know by now that gravitation is the effect of the\ncurving of space-time around matter. Einstein proved that two hundred\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"Go back to your games, Grampa,\" Fred said impatiently. \"We've got work\nto do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrampa knitted his bushy, white eyebrows and petulantly pushed the last\nbutton on his pircuit. The last light went out. \"You've got work to\ndo, have you? Whose flivver do you think this is, anyhow?\"\n\n\"It belongs to all of us,\" Four said shrilly. \"You gave us all a sixth\nshare.\"\n\n\"That's right, Four,\" Grampa muttered, \"so I did. But whose money\nbought it?\"\n\n\"You bought it, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\"That's right! And who invented the gravity polarizer and the space\nflivver? Eh? Who made possible this gallivanting all over space?\"\n\n\"You, Grampa,\" Fred said.\n\n\"You bet! And who made one hundred million dollars out of it that the\nrest of you vultures are just hanging around to gobble up when I die?\"\n\n\"And who spent it all trying to invent perpetual motion machines and\nlongevity pills,\" Joyce said bitterly, \"and fixed it so we'd have to\ngo searching for uranium and habitable worlds all through this deadly\ngalaxy? You, Grampa!\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, \"I got a little put away yet. You'll be\nsorry when I'm dead and gone.\"\n\n\"You're never going to die, Grampa,\" Joyce said harshly. \"Just\nbefore we left, you bought a hundred-year contract with that\nLife-Begins-At-Ninety longevity company.\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Grampa, blinking, \"how'd you find out about that?\nWell, now!\" In confusion, he turned back to the pircuit and jabbed a\nbutton. Thirteen slim lights sprang on. \"I'll get you this time!\"\n\nFour stretched and stood up. He looked curiously into the corner by the\ncomputer where Grampa's chair stood. \"You brought that pircuit from\nEarth, didn't you? What's the game?\"\n\nGrampa looked up, obviously relieved to drop his act of intense\nconcentration. \"I'll tell you, boy. You play against the pircuit,\ntaking turns, and you can put out one, two or three lights. The player\nwho makes the other one turn out the last light is the winner.\"\n\n\"That's simple,\" Four said without hesitation. \"The winning strategy is\nto--\"\n\n\"Don't be a kibitzer!\" Grampa snapped. \"When I need help, I'll ask\nfor it. No dad-blamed machine is gonna outthink Grampa!\" He snorted\nindignantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFour shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.\nWithin it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the\npicture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland\nand plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the\nflivver's stern.\n\n\"Look!\" he said suddenly. \"This planet not only has flora--it has\nfauna.\" He rushed to the air lock.\n\n\"Four!\" Reba called out warningly.\n\n\"It's all right, Reba,\" Four assured her. \"The air is within one per\ncent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms\nviable within the Terran spectrum.\"\n\n\"What about macro-organisms--\" Reba began, but the boy was gone\nalready. Reba's face was troubled. \"That boy!\" she said to Junior.\n\"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should\nhave friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy.\"\n\nBut Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart\nroom. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,\nhe asked impatiently. \"Well, what's all the mystery?\"\n\n\"No use bothering the others yet,\" Junior said, his face puzzled. \"You\nsee, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer\nquit.\"\n\n\"Quit!\"\n\n\"That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver--it\nwon't budge!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thing was a featureless blob, a two-foot sphere of raspberry\ngelatin, but it was alive. It rocked back and forth in front of Four.\nIt opened a raspberry-color pseudo-mouth and said plaintively, \"Fweep?\nFweep?\"\n\nJoyce drew her chair farther back toward the wall, revulsion on her\nface. \"Four! Get that nasty thing out of here!\"\n\n\"You mean Fweep?\" Four asked in astonishment.\n\n\"I mean that thing, whatever you call it.\" Joyce fluttered her hand\nimpatiently. \"Get it out!\"\n\nFour's eyes widened farther. \"But Fweep's my friend.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Joyce said sharply. \"Earthmen don't make friends with\naliens. And that's nothing but a--a blob!\"\n\n\"Fweep?\" queried the raspberry lips. \"Fweep?\"\n\n\"If it's Four's friend,\" Reba said firmly, \"it can stay. If you don't\nlike to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room.\"\n\nJoyce stood up indignantly. \"Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes\nme sound as old as that old goat over there!\" She glared malignantly\nat Grampa. \"If you'd rather have that blob than me--well!\" She swept\ngrandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that\nopened out from it.\n\n\"Fweep?\" asked the blob.\n\n\"Sure,\" Four said. \"Go ahead, fweep--I mean sweep.\"\n\nSwiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a\nnarrow path of sparkling clean tile.\n\nGrampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely\nclosed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. \"Good for you, Reba!\"\nhe said admiringly. \"For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never\nhad the nerve.\"\n\n\"Why, thanks, Grampa,\" Reba said, surprised.\n\n\"I like you, gal. Never forget it.\"\n\n\"I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior\nwould have had competition!\"\n\n\"You bet he would!\" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned\nover confidentially toward Reba and whispered, \"Beats me why you ever\nmarried a jerk like Junior, anyhow.\"\n\nReba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. \"Maybe I saw\nsomething in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been\nsubmerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you\nand to himself, too.\" Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. \"And maybe I\nthought he might grow into a man like his grandfather.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrampa turned red and looked quickly toward Four. The boy was staring\nintently at Fweep. \"What you doing, Four?\"\n\n\"Trying to figure out what Fweep does with the sweepings,\" Four said\nabsently. \"The outer inch or two of his body gets cloudy and then\nslowly clears. I think I'll try him with a bigger particle.\"\n\n\"That's the idea, Four. You'll be a Peppergrass yet. How about building\nme a pircuit?\"\n\n\"You get the other one figured out?\"\n\n\"It was easy,\" Grampa said breezily, \"once you understood the\nprinciple. The player who moved second could always win if he used the\nright strategy. Dividing the thirteen lights into three sections of\nfour each--\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Four agreed. \"I can make you a new one by cannibalizing\nthe other pircuit, but I'll need a few extra parts.\"\n\nGrampa pushed the wall beside his chair and a drawer slid out of it.\n\nInside were row after row of nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible\nfree-fall bottles and a battered cigar box. \"Thought you'd say that,\"\nhe said, picking out the box. \"Help yourself.\" With the other hand, he\nlifted out one of the bottles and took a long drag on it. \"Ahhh!\" he\nsighed, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and carefully put\nthe bottle away.\n\n\"What is that stuff you drink, Grampa?\" Four asked.\n\n\"Tonic, boy. Keeps me young and frisky. Now about that pircuit--\"\n\n\"Did you ever work on Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia's puzzle about the three lovely\nbrides, the three jealous husbands, the river and the two-passenger\nrowboat?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Grampa said. \"Too easy.\"\n\nFour thought a moment. \"There's a modern variation with three\nmissionaries and three cannibals. Same river, same rowboat and only one\nof the cannibals can row. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries--\"\n\n\"Sounds good, boy,\" Grampa said eagerly. \"Whip it up for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, Grampa.\" Four looked at Fweep again. The translucent sphere had\npaused at Grampa's feet.\n\nGrampa reached down to pat it. For an instant, his hand disappeared\ninto Fweep, and then the alien creature rolled away. This time its path\nseemed crooked.\n\nIts gelatinous form jiggled. \"Hic!\" it said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs if in response, the flivver vibrated. Grampa looked querulously\ntoward the airlock. \"Flivver shouldn't shake like that. Not with the\npolarizer turned on.\"\n\nThe airlock door swung inward. Through the oval doorway walked Fred,\nfollowed closely by Junior. They were sweat-stained and weary,\nscintillation counters dangling heavily from their belts.\n\n\"Any luck?\" Reba asked brightly.\n\n\"Do we look it?\" Junior grumbled.\n\n\"Where's Joyce?\" asked Fred. \"Might as well get everybody in on this at\nonce. Joyce!\"\n\nThe door to his wife's room opened instantly. Behind it, Joyce was\nregal and slim. The pose was spoiled immediately by her avid question:\n\"Any uranium? Radium? Thorium?\"\n\n\"No,\" Fred said slowly, \"and no other heavy metals, either. There's a\nfew low-grade iron deposits and that's it.\"\n\n\"Then what makes this planet so heavy?\" Reba asked.\n\nJunior shrugged helplessly and collapsed into a chair. \"Your guess is\nas good as anybody's.\"\n\n\"Then we've wasted another week on a worthless rock,\" Joyce complained.\nShe turned savagely on Fred. \"This was going to make us all filthy\nrich. We were going to find radioactives and retire to Earth like\nbillionaires. And all we've done is spent a year of our lives in this\ncramped old flivver--and we don't have many of them to spare!\" She\nglared venomously at Grampa.\n\n\"We've still got Fweepland,\" Four said solemnly.\n\n\"Fweepland?\" Reba repeated.\n\n\"This planet. It's not big, but it's fertile and it's harmless. As\nreal estate, it's worth almost as much as if it were solid uranium.\"\n\n\"A good thing, too,\" Junior said glumly, \"because this looks like the\nend of our search. Short of a miracle, we'll spend the rest of our\nlives right here--involuntary colonists.\"\n\nJoyce spun on him. \"You're joking!\" she screeched.\n\n\"I wish I were,\" Junior said. \"But the polarizer won't work. Either\nit's broken or there's something about the gravity around here that\njust won't polarize.\"\n\n\"It's these '23 models,\" Grampa put in disgustedly. \"They never were\nany good.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and\nrose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable\nspaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that\nthe rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.\n\nGrampa looked up from his pircuit and said, \"If I were you, Junior, I\nwould take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.\n_If_ we get back to Earth,\" he amended. \"You can't be Four's father.\nAll over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the\npolarizer will polarize it.\"\n\n\"That's just supposition,\" Junior said stubbornly. \"The fact is, it\nisn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D.\"\n\n\"Maybe the polarizer is broken,\" Fred suggested.\n\nGrampa snorted. \"Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a\nfew coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know\nthe power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water\nrecirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,\nanyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to.\"\n\n\"Then it goes deeper,\" Junior insisted. \"It goes right to the principle\nof polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?\nBefore we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more\nabout polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?\"\n\nGrampa gave him a sarcastic grin. \"Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't\nbe bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept\nwithout question the blessings that the Good Lord provideth--\"\n\n\"Let's not get up on any pulpits,\" Fred growled. \"Come on, Grampa,\nwhat's the theory behind polarization?\"\n\nGrampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the\njeering grin turned to a smile. \"Well,\" he said, \"at last. You know\nhow light is polarized, eh?\" The smile faded. \"No, I guess you don't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe cleared his throat professorially. \"Well, now, in ordinary light\nthe vibrations are perpendicular to the ray in all directions. When\nlight is polarized by passing through crystals or by reflection or\nrefraction at non-metallic surfaces, the paths of the vibrations are\nstill perpendicular to the ray, but they're in straight lines, circles\nor ellipses.\"\n\nThe faces were still blank and unillumined.\n\n\"Gravity is similar to light,\" he pressed on. \"In the absence of\nmatter, gravity is non-polarized. Matter polarizes gravity in a circle\naround itself. That's how we've always known it until the invention of\nspaceships and later the polarizer. The polarizer polarizes gravity\ninto a straight line. That makes the ship take off and continue\naccelerating until the polarizer is shut off or its angle is shifted.\"\n\nThe faces looked at him silently. Finally Joyce could endure it no\nlonger. \"That's just nonsense! You all know it. Grampa's no genius.\nHe's just a tinkerer. One day he happened to tinker out the polarizer.\nHe doesn't know how it works any more than I do.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute!\" Grampa protested. \"That's not fair. Maybe\nI didn't figure out the theory myself, but I read everything the\nscientists ever wrote about it. Wanted to know myself what made the\nblamed thing work. What I told you is what the scientists said, near\nas I remember. Now me--I'm like Edison. I do it and let everybody else\nworry over 'why.'\"\n\n\"The only thing you ever did was the polarizer,\" Joyce snapped.\n\"And then you spent everything you got from it on those fool\nperpetual-motion machines and those crazy longevity schemes when any\nmoron would know they were impossible.\"\n\nGrampa squinted at her sagely. \"That's what they said about the gravity\npolarizer before I invented it.\"\n\n\"But you don't really know why it works,\" Junior persisted.\n\n\"Well, no,\" Grampa admitted. \"Actually I was just fiddling around with\nsome coils when one of them took off. Went right through the ceiling,\ndragging a battery behind it. I guess it's still going. Ought to be out\nnear the Horsehead Nebula by now. Luckily, I remembered how I'd wound\nit.\"\n\n\"Why won't the ship work then, if you know so much?\" Joyce demanded\nironically.\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa said in bafflement, \"it rightly should, you know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We're stuck,\" Reba said softly. \"We might as well admit it. All we can\ndo is set the transmitter to send out an automatic distress call--\"\n\n\"Which,\" Joyce interrupted, \"might get picked up in a few centuries.\"\n\n\"And make the best of what we've got,\" Reba went on, unheeding. \"If we\nlook at it the right way, it's quite a lot. A beautiful, fertile world.\nEarth gravity. The flivver--even if the polarizer won't work, there's\nthe resynthesizer; it will keep us in food and clothes for years. By\nthen, we should have a good-sized community built up, because out here\nwe won't have to stop with one child. We can have all the babies we\nwant.\"\n\n\"You know the law: one child per couple,\" Joyce reminded her frigidly.\n\"You can condemn yourself to exile from civilization if you wish. Not\nme.\"\n\nJunior frowned at his wife. \"I believe you're actually glad it\nhappened.\"\n\n\"I could think of worse things,\" Reba said.\n\n\"I like your spunk, Reb,\" Grampa muttered.\n\n\"Speaking of children,\" Junior said, \"where's Four?\"\n\n\"Here.\" Four came through the airlock and trudged across the room,\ncarrying a curious contraption made of tripod legs supporting a\nsmall box from which dangled a plumb bob. Behind Four, like a round,\nraspberry shadow, rolled Fweep.\n\n\"Fweep?\" it queried hopefully.\n\n\"Not now,\" said Four.\n\n\"Where've you been?\" Reba asked anxiously. \"What've you been doing?\"\n\n\"I've been all over Fweepland,\" Four said wearily, \"trying to locate\nits center of gravity.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Fred prompted.\n\n\"It shifts.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" said Junior.\n\n\"Not for Fweep,\" Four replied.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Joyce suspiciously asked.\n\n\"It shifted,\" Four explained patiently, \"because Fweep kept following\nme.\"\n\n\"Fweep?\" Junior repeated stupidly.\n\n\"Fweep?\" Fweep said eagerly.\n\n\"He's why the flivver won't work. What Grampa invented was a linear\npolarizer. Fweep is a circular polarizer. He's what makes this planet\nso heavy. He's why we can't leave.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered\nthe nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. \"I got it figured out,\nFour,\" he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. \"A missionary takes\nover a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing\ncannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and--\"\n\n\"Not now, Grampa,\" Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making\nthe grand tour of the cabin.\n\nThe raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,\nabsorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.\n\n\"Rat poison?\" Four asked.\n\nJoyce started guiltily. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"There's no use trying to poison Fweep,\" Four said calmly. \"He's got no\nenzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use\nwhat he 'eats' on a molecular level at all.\"\n\n\"What level does he use?\" Junior wanted to know.\n\n\"Point the scintillation counter at him.\"\n\nJunior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the\npickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum\nrose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.\n\nJunior looked at the counter's dial. \"He's radioactive, all right. Not\nmuch, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?\"\n\n\"He uses ordinary matter,\" Four said. \"He must have used up the few\ndeposits of natural radioactives a long time ago.\"\n\n\"He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?\" Junior said\nunbelievingly.\n\nFour nodded. \"And that 'skin' of his--whatever it is he uses for\nskin--is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several\nfeet of lead.\"\n\nFred studied Fweep thoughtfully. \"Maybe we could feed him enough\nenriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass.\"\n\n\"And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it\nmight be a trifle more than disastrous for us.\" Four giggled at the\nthought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJoyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do\nsomething with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here\nat the whim of a mere blob!\"\n\n\"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what\nhe's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends\nthe space-time continuum around him--conscious or subconscious, I don't\nknow. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the\nflivver won't move.\"\n\n\"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it\nstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,\nwe'll just have to do away with it.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and\nyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so\nyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'\neverything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.\nRight now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower\nhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.\nEither way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n\n\"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around\nand wait for that thing to die?\"\n\n\"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his\nkind on this planet.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Probably he's immortal.\"\n\n\"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n\n\"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.\nReproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal\ncreatures.\"\n\n\"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or\nsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n\n\"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger\nthan when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"\nFred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its\nwater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReba looked at Fweep kindly. \"We can thank the little fellow for that,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"I thank him for nothing,\" Joyce snapped. \"He lured us down here by\nmaking us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go\n_immediately_!\"\n\nFred turned impatiently on his wife. \"Well, try making him understand!\nAnd if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making\nhim do it!\"\n\nJoyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. \"Fred!\" she said in a high,\nshocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.\n\nGrampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. \"Well, boy,\" he said to\nFred, \"I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you.\"\n\nFred stood up apologetically. \"I'd better go calm her down,\" he\nmuttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.\n\n\"Give her one for me!\" Grampa called.\n\nFred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room\ncame the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like\nsome reedy folk music.\n\n\"Makes you think, doesn't it?\" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.\n\"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a\nFweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity\nin circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result.\"\n\n\"What I can't understand,\" Junior said thoughtfully, \"is why the\npolarizer worked for a little while when we landed--long enough to keep\nus from being squashed--and then quit.\"\n\n\"Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or\nwhere it came from,\" Four explained. \"All he knew was he didn't like\nlinear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's\nwhen we dropped.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?\" Grampa said.\n\"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop.\"\n\n\"He's no more improbable than people,\" said Four.\n\n\"Less than some I've known,\" Grampa conceded.\n\n\"If he can eat anything,\" Reba said, \"why does he keep sweeping the\ncabin for dust and lint?\"\n\n\"He wants to be helpful,\" Four replied without hesitation, \"and he's\nlonely. After all,\" he added wistfully, \"he's never had any friends.\"\n\n\"How do you know all these things?\" Joyce asked from her doorway,\nexcitement in her voice. \"Can you talk to it?\"\n\nBehind her, Fred said, \"Now, Joyce, you promised--\"\n\n\"But this is important,\" Joyce cut him off eagerly. \"Can you? Talk to\nit, I mean?\"\n\n\"Some,\" Four admitted.\n\n\"Have you asked it to let us go?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well? What did it say?\"\n\n\"He said he didn't want his friend to leave him.\"\n\nAt the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into\nFour's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.\n\"Fwiend,\" it said.\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, \"that's no\nproblem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep.\"\n\nIn a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, \"That's quite\na sacrifice to ask, but--\"\n\n\"Joyce!\" Reba cried, horrified. \"Grampa was joking, but you actually\nmean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him--\"\n\n\"Never mind, Reba,\" Four said evenly. \"It was just what I was going to\nsuggest myself. It's the one really logical solution.\"\n\n\"Fwiend,\" said Fweep gently.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe land of the Fweep turned like a fat old man toasting himself in\nfront of an open fire, and Junior sat at the computer's keyboard\nswearing in a steady monotone.\n\n\"Junior!\" said Joyce, shocked.\n\nJunior swung around impatiently. \"Sorry, Mother, but this damned thing\nwon't work.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that calling it names won't help, and besides, you shouldn't\nexpect a machine to do something that we can't do. And if it did work,\nit would only say that the logical answer is the one I sug--\"\n\n\"Mother!\" Junior warned. \"We decided not to talk about it any more.\nFour is strange enough without encouraging him to think like a martyr.\nIt's out of the question. If that's the only way we can leave this\nplanet, we'll stay here until Four has a beard as white as Grampa's!\"\n\n\"Well!\" Joyce said in a stiff, offended tone and sat back in her chair.\n\nGrampa lowered the nippled bottle from his lips and chortled. \"Junior,\nI apologize for all the mean things I ever said about you. Maybe you\ngot the makings of a Peppergrass yet.\"\n\nJunior turned back to the keyboard and studied it, his chin in his\nhand. \"It's just a matter of stating the problem in terms the computer\ncan work on.\"\n\n\"I take it all back,\" said Grampa. \"That computer won't help you with\nthis problem, Junior. This ain't a long, complicated calculation; it's\na simple problem in logic. It's a pircuit problem, like the one about\nthe cannibals and the missionaries. We can't leave Fweepland because\nFweep won't let our polarizer work. He won't let our polarizer work\nbecause he doesn't like gravity that's polarized in a straight line,\nand he don't want Four to leave him.\n\n\"Now Fweep ain't the brightest creature in the Universe, so he can't\nunderstand why we're so gosh-fired eager to leave. And as long as he's\ngot Four, he's happy. Why should he make himself unhappy? As a favor\nto Four, he'd let us leave--if we'd leave Four here with him, which we\nain't gonna do.\n\n\"That's the problem. All we got to do is figure out the answer. No use\nmaking a pircuit, because a puzzle circuit is just a miniature computer\nwith the solution built in; if you can build the pircuit, you've\nalready solved the problem. And if you can state the problem to Abacus,\nyou've already got the answer. All you want from it then is decimal\npoints.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" Junior said stubbornly, \"but I still want to know why\nthis computer won't work. It won't even do simple arithmetic! Where's\nFour? He's the only one who understands this thing.\"\n\n\"He's outside, playing in the meadow with Fweep,\" Reba said, her voice\nsoft. \"No, here they come now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the airlock came Four, carrying Fweep on his shoulder like\na raspberry cat without head or tail. Four's thin face glowed with\nexertion and glistened with sweat. Already the orange sun had begun to\npaint his skin tan.\n\n\"We've been playing dodge ball,\" Four panted. \"Fweep was the ball and I\nhad to dodge him.\"\n\n\"There's something wrong with this computer,\" Junior complained. \"Take\na look at it.\"\n\n\"Sure, Daddy,\" Four said promptly, and he took his father's place at\nthe keyboard. After a few moments, he began to frown, then detached\na front panel. He started sorting through the maze of wires and\nelectronic components.\n\nGrampa watched him with a wary eye.\n\nJoyce was unable to restrain herself any longer. \"The way you people\ntalk, a person would think we were never going to leave this\ngodforsaken, miserable, uncivilized planet.\"\n\n\"That seems to be the general idea,\" Grampa chuckled, enjoying her\ndismay.\n\n\"Unless we can build a reaction rocket ship to push us out of Fweep's\nrange,\" Fred said glumly.\n\n\"We've got the iron ore!\" Junior put in eagerly.\n\nGrampa snorted. \"Come on, use your brains. You'd have to build a ship;\nthese flivvers weren't built for the stresses of reaction flight.\nBy the time you've solved all the problems of motors and alloys and\nrocket-tube linings, fuel, ship construction, personnel protection,\nand all the rest of it, this planet would be another Detroit and your\ngreat-great-great-grandchildren would be living in it. You couldn't\nbuild a blast furnace even if you had the complete Congressional\nmicrofilm library! You'd do better trying to figure out how Fweep does\nwhat he does and doing some practicing on that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Junior said peevishly, \"trying to get away is better than\nsitting here talking about it.\"\n\nReba stared thoughtfully at Junior and said, \"Maybe Fweep would go with\nus.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Joyce said excitedly. \"Maybe the dear little thing _would_ go\nwith us. That would solve everything!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout looking around, Four said, \"I asked him already. Fweep's afraid\nto come along.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we would be very good to him,\" Joyce said swiftly. \"I've\nalways liked pets. Why, I once had a goldfish of my very own!\"\n\n\"Which you let die,\" Fred said dryly, \"because you forgot to feed it.\"\n\n\"Oh, he's not afraid of _people_,\" Four told them. \"He's afraid of\nspace and unpolarized gravity and things like that. He's lived here all\nhis life--that's a long time--and it makes him feel awful funny just to\nthink about leaving. He says he can still remember the way our linear\ngravitation felt inside when we landed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Joyce said firmly, \"he'll just have to fight it, that's all.\nIf a person let that kind of neurotic impulse rule his life, he'd be\ncompletely demoralized in no time.\"\n\nFour glanced over his shoulder at Joyce, as if to see if she were\njoking. Shaking his head, he returned to the computer's innards. A\nmoment later, he swung around and stared accusingly at Grampa. \"You've\ncannibalized Abacus!\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa protested, licking his lips nervously. \"You see,\nI--\"\n\n\"That's where you got the parts for the pircuits!\" Four said with\nmerciless logic.\n\nJoyce stood up virtuously and shook her finger at Grampa. \"First you\nentice us out here in this nasty old flivver; then you get us stuck;\nand now you've ruined the computer for your nasty old games!\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa blustered, \"the goldarn thing wouldn't work, would\nit? We didn't need it--not with Four around. He figures everything out\nin his head and we just used Abacus to sort of check him. Ain't that\nright now?\"\n\nFive pairs of eyes stared at him in silence.\n\n\"Well, now,\" Grampa said defensively, \"I got it all worked out anyhow.\nWe can leave here any time we get ready.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe land of the Fweep turned and grew small in the view screen, and\nJunior sat in the pilot's chair, his hand on the control stick, his\neyes fixed on the moving dials in front of him.\n\nThere were three others in the room: Reba, who looked at the dwindling\nFweepland and sighed; Joyce, who sat tautly in her chair, her face\nfixed and unbelieving; and Fred, who looked at Joyce and shook his head.\n\nGrampa opened the door to his room and stepped cockily into the central\ncabin, shutting the door behind him. \"Well?\" he demanded confidently.\n\"Are we heading for Earth?\"\n\nJunior gestured toward the screen. \"If Four's coordinates are right.\"\n\n\"Speaking of coordinates,\" Grampa said briskly, \"make sure we got the\ncoordinates of Fweepland. It'll take a long time for that atmosphere to\ndissipate. A nice little world like that is worth its weight in uranium\nto a good real estate salesman.\"\n\n\"How did you do it?\" Joyce challenged.\n\nGrampa slapped her familiarly on the shoulder. \"A problem of gravity,\"\nhe said gayly, \"but a simple one. Nothing for an old pircuit man like\nme. I guess you folks won't laugh at Grampa and his pircuits any more.\nNot only did Grampa get you out of Fweepland, but he's taking you back\nwith a valuable little subdivision in the third quadrant to file on.\"\n\n\"I hate to spoil the party,\" Fred said, \"but have you thought about\nwhat you're going to do with Fweep?\"\n\n\"Fweep?\" Grampa repeated, puzzled. \"Why should I do anything with\nFweep?\"\n\n\"We can't take him back to Earth with us.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Grampa demanded.\n\n\"In the first place, the Immigration Authority would have to pass on\nhim. That might take years, with Fweep's powers and abilities. More\nimportant, if Fweep got loose on Earth, every flivver would have the\nsame problem there that we had here. And next time Fweep might not be\nso cooperative. I don't know what you did to Fweep in there, but if\nhe's still alive, the I.A. isn't going to take a chance.\"\n\nGrampa considered the prospect without dismay. \"I wonder if we could\nsmuggle him in. With all those flivvers not working, they'd have to pay\nus before they could take off.\"\n\n\"Grampa!\" Fred said sternly. \"That would be blackmail--or worse.\nBesides getting in trouble with the I.A., you'd get it from the W.B.I.\nand the I.C.C.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrampa waved his hand impatiently. \"We'll solve that problem when we\ncome to it. After all, an old pircuit man like me--\"\n\n\"What _did_ you _do_ to Fweep?\" Joyce repeated insistently.\n\nGrampa cleared his throat with pride. \"Well, now, I'll tell you. I\njust happened to notice that Fweep liked my tonic. Every time I took a\nlittle nip, the little beast was around my chair, trying to clean my\nhand for me.\"\n\n\"Tonic!\" Joyce sniffed. \"Liquor, you mean!\"\n\n\"Now that's not right,\" Grampa objected. \"I said tonic and I mean\ntonic. Got a little alcohol in it for a preservative, maybe, but the\nimportant part is the minerals. That's the Longevity Institute's\nsecret. It's what keeps me young. Want a little nip?\" He leered at\nJoyce.\n\n\"You mean you got Fweep drunk?\" Fred exclaimed.\n\n\"Well, now, that was the _effect_, but I can't swear it was the\nalcohol. Not unless Fweep can use the stuff on the molecular level if\nhe wants. On the other hand, maybe it was the minerals in there that\naffected him. Little world like Fweepland, maybe it lacked a few\nthings when it was made. But the way I looked at it, it stood to reason\nthe little fellow could use a drink. Alone all these centuries, he\nmust've got pretty dry. But whatever it was, he sure got high. Lost all\ncontrol.\"\n\n\"Poor Fweep,\" Reba murmured.\n\n\"Poor nothing,\" Grampa said. \"He was the happiest little critter I ever\nsaw. When Four explained to him just what we wanted, he went right to\nwork on that bottle and--\"\n\nGramp's door swung open once more. \"Grampa! Grampa!\" Four shouted.\n\"Fweep! He--I mean--well, we've been calling him by the wrong pronoun.\nLook!\"\n\nFour came running out of the room. Behind him rolled a tiny raspberry\nsphere about the size of a marble. Occasionally it hopped in the air\nand said, \"Fweep?\" in a small, high voice.\n\nBehind it rolled and hopped a second raspberry marble. \"Fweep?\" it\nsaid. Behind it came another and another until the cabin was full of\nthem, rolling, bouncing, calling \"Fweep?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDazedly, Junior counted them. \"One hundred and one, one hundred and\ntwo, one hundred and--\"\n\n\"Oh, Junior,\" Reba said, hugging him excitedly. \"Aren't they cute?\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Grampa asked, as dazed as Junior.\n\n\"Maybe it was the tonic,\" Four said, \"but I suspect it was the the\nunpolarized gravity. All of a sudden, Fweep started splitting like an\namoeba, over and over. Do you suppose that was what made him nervous?\"\n\n\"That's the way the little fellow reproduces, all right,\" said Grampa.\n\"I wonder if he has to wait until a race becomes civilized enough to\ndiscover the polarizer, eh?\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" gasped Joyce, brushing a Fweep out of her lap.\n\nGrampa looked at the cabin and its occupants happily.\n\n\"I'd like to remind you,\" Fred said gravely, \"that this multiplies our\nproblem of what to do with Fweep over one hundred times.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" asked Grampa. \"The only problem we got is how we're\ngonna spend the cash. We're in business--the gravity business. We'll\ncall it Gravity, Incorporated, and we can reclaim every little hunk of\nrock in the Solar System. Each one of those little fellows is worth\na fortune! We'll give the satellites and the asteroids Earth-normal\ngravities and atmospheres and, by golly, we're rich!\"\n\n\"Rich?\" Joyce echoed. A smile slowly replaced the expression of\ndistaste. She snapped her fingers. \"Here, Fweepie,\" she said in her\nmost enticing tone. \"Here, little darlings! Come to dear Joyce!\"\n\nBut they had all hopped to Four and were clustered around him like a\nraspberry bubble bath. Through them, his face peered, thin and happy.\n\nGrampa looked at Reba. She was hugging Junior happily and smiling at\nFour. Grampa looked back at the boy.\n\n\"We'll have to be exclusive, though,\" Grampa said. \"Considering the\nFweeps' likes and dislikes, that is. We'll sell only to people with\nchildren.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gravity Business, by James E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
